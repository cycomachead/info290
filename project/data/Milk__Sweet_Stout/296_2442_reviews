"O: Good beer, I don´t like sweet beers and this is pretty drinkable for me."
""
""
"It's not so good like I want"
""
""
"A very good stout."
""

""

"Good stuff. Good English stout"
""
""
""

""

"This is a pretty good English cream stout, I really enjoyed it. Cool looking bottle, too."
""
""
""
""

"Overall - By and large I do like this beer and will buy it again. It started very well and the middle flagged a little before a very pleasing finish. This is an odd way to describe a beer and I have not had many beers that seemed to drink differently as the bottle goes down. It pares well with dried sausage and Gouda cheese."

"O: I think St Peters make some of the best bottled beer in Britain."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Not my favorite stout by far, but it's pretty good I wouldn't turn it down. I think there are better stouts for the money but definitely worth trying. Sidenote- I found myself not impressed what so ever when I first poured, got exponentially better as it warmed."

"Ode to a Cream Stout: One downfall I noticed immediately was this beer isn't much of a stout, but good none the less! Strong malt and chocolate taste with a dry bitter finish, a great ""dessert"" beer to finish a meal."
""
""
""
"O)  In two minds on how to write this up.  This is like a very good version of Guinness, with no real flaws.  Goes down super easy.  My criticism would be: does it have to be 6.5% to achieve that?  Buy it if you are a general stout fan, you will enjoy it without being blown away.  If you are an stout fan from England looking for our equivalent of Founders et al., this is nowhere near."

"DATE TASTED: April 25, 2014... GLASSWARE: Guinness vintage tulip... OCCASION: celebrating a one-day work week! APPEARANCE: jet black body; pours a fizzy brown head that settles in a hurry; sporadically disperses and forms a thin brown line; lacing is thin as well (gets a bump for the bottle, a quaintly antique shape... AROMA: intense, lactic, almost pungent impact with charcoal, peat and chocolate--a swirl of stoutly aromas... PALATE: mildly smooth; a bit oily and liquidy; active and medium-bodied; a bit soda-esque, but not as creamy as hoped for...TASTE: vanilla and milk mix playfully on the tongue; peaty and a bit smoky too--more complex than expected... OVERALL: a working man's stout, brisk and flat and medium-bodied enough to command attention--a winner, but not among the immortals I've imbibed recently..."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a very pleasing milk stout. I'll definitely have this again."
""
""
"O - world class beer. 2nd best beer I've had to date. Must try for any beer lover. A+"

"Worth once MAYBE on sale, but still, kinda a bad beer. Il probably never try it again, and do not recommend it. Get double cream ale instead, its a far better made brew."
""
""
"Overall: This was my first cream stout, so I didn't know what to expect. It was a lot brighter and hoppier than any other stout I've had, but the tastes came together well, making it enjoyble to drink."
"Pours almost black with just a tad of a beige head which leaves some spotty lacing. Perfect carbonation and not real 'fizzy', like I like them. Smells of sweet chocolate, roasted malts and coffee. The taste is the about same and very easy to drink with NO bitter aftertaste. I simply LOVE this one! This is the best that it gets in my opinion. My favorite ""Cream Stout"" to date!"
""
""
""
""
"O. Great beer, nice to mix it up"
""
"O: This review is old, so notes are pretty minimal. I do remember liking this a lot. Compared to a lot of other beers, it's definitely worth the $4 price tag. Try it if you can find it."
"Reminded me of an Irish beer I used to be able to find in the 90s. Can't remember then exact name, but it started with a W. Something like Warner's. It was a sad day when the nice man at the beer store told me they stopped making it. It was the first stout I had besides Guiness, and I thought it was amazing!"
""
""
"A very pleasant beer to drink- I'll be looking for more."
""
""
""
"to me this a quite light imperial stout, very nice and pleasant, however not a match to e.g. Samuel Smith ..."
""
""
"Pours with a dark brown almost black color and a very small off-color head. There's virtually no bubbles present. The aroma is very gentle, some malts and some alcohol aroma. The taste is contrary to expectations not very strong, pleasantly creamy with quite some roastiness and some little coffee. Due to lack of carbo it has a slightly stale feel, but it's very drinkable and enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Almost like a Foreign Export Stout. Sweet and laced with more alcohol than anticipated. The mouthfeel was pretty good and the taste was certainly one that grew on me although it's unlikely I'll pick this one up again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This was one of my first favorite Stouts. That's probably because it was on the lighter side and leaned to the sweeter side of things. Today, I see it more as a summer-time Stout. Fruity and light; I can definitely envision drinking during a BBQ cookout."
""
""
""
"Not as consistent or smooth and I hoped for, but a fair experience. I will probably give it another good try when I'm in the mood for a stout while not being adventurous enough to try something new."
""
""
""
"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Foamy patches of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and slight char aromas. There is also a bit of a soy sauce aroma that comes out as the beer warms up. Taste is much the same with bittersweet cocoa and char flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that has a solid roasty and cocoa presence that is slightly better in the smell."

"St. Peter's Cream Stout ---4/5."

"O- A solid stout. Not too sweet. Not too dry. Nice creaminess as well."

"3.5 D: Good beer, but I rather like St. P's other offerings more."
""

"This is really a creamy delight. The nice taste of roasted coffee and chocolate coats the tongue. It's an excellent milk stout. I would get this again."
""
""
"This is a remarkably smooth beer. Creamy, silky and velvety, the only offense any beer lover could find is that they might expect more body in a stout. The thing is, this is a full-bodied beer. If you want to be destroyed, pick up a properly made RIS, but it's no real shortcoming here."
""
"O: Kind of a plain cream stout. Not as creamy as I'd like, and not nearly enough roasted malt to back it up. Just kinda meh all around."
""
"RJT"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Rich creamy body but with lively carbonation as well. Lactic sweetness throughout with sweet Chocolate notes and Nutella and grainy toasted biscuit. Finishes with a roast and coffee bitterness. Smooth and nicely balance, not overly sweet with a unique body, I like it."

"Pours nearly black with ruby highlights and a sparse, khaki colored head. Aroma is mild and roasty with a hint of chocolate and alcohol. Roasted malt dominates the flavor profile, but the character is not particularly like coffee or chocolate--just a general roasted flavor. Lactose comes through a bit in the finish and moreso as the beer warms. Some alcoholic warmth is also noticeable, but it's not especially strong. Hop flavor is fairly mild, just enough to lend some balance. Carbonation feels a shade higher than necessary for the style, and the body could be a little fuller. With that said, this remains a safe and drinkable English stout."
""
""
"D heavy but nice, definitely up to snuff as they say.fast"
"Overall- Not a bad brew but calling it a cream stout is a bit misleading in my opinion. It's more of a dark ale with hints of chocolate and fruit. It is fairly on the sweet side but not in a creamy sense. I almost don't know what to say about it, almost reminds me of a wine."
""
""
""
"O- overall an enjoyable brew. Smoky yet sweet with a bitter chocolaty finish. My only complaint was the mouthfeel was a little off for me."
"O: What a great beer. Simple and to the point. This one lacks complexity but complexity isn't what I'm after by coming to a milk stout. St. Peter's delivered."
""
""
""
"a very distinc stout. it pours a mean dense black color with a nearly two inch off white head that leaves nice ring lacing on the glass. the nose is a little sweet, can definitely smell those milk sugars left over, as well as an oddly potent alcohol content for a beer under 7% abv. some dark chocolate and creamy vanilla are in the first flavors i taste. it would be sweet, but the bitter burnt malts temper the sweetness perfectly. there again is that booze towards the end. mouthfeel is a little bit thin in terms of body, but it has a very smooth mouthfeel. carbonation is very light, and this feels traditional to me in some way. also love the packaging. overall a very tasty beer, a nice illustration of the milk stout genre."
"O- Not a super tasty beer but still one that you can drink with ease and great pleasure"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very drinkable. Quite smooth and pleasant Stout. Recommended"
""
""
""
"O: This is a good cream stout. Lots of character and flavor."
"Overall - The flavor and mouthfeel are hard to top, which the smell could've been richer. HOWEVER...it's very easy to overlook it's flaws just because it tastes so damn good! Even if you don't like stouts, you need to try this out!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very smooth mouthfeel and easy drinkability...I find this is the way a Milk Stout should be like. I wish the writing on the label wasn't so small so I could actually read it."
""
"This is entirely too metallic and it stays in the back of your mouth. No me gusta."
""
""
"The hop bite is a bit more predominant in the taste but overall it still embodies a sweet, dark malt, and licorice character. Still, a likable enough beer."
""
"A good beer, very easy to drink. Really good example of the type. Cheap too. Gonna have to get some more of this."
"Pours a nice black & tan as a cream stout should, nothing too strong on the nose. Nice a creamy taste, but surprisingly not as creamy of a feel. There is a touch of carbonation which is odd, but it doesn't really diminish the quality of the stout. It's also not quite as sweet as the style suggests, but the chocolate & coffee flavors are still quite tasty."
""

""

""

"Overall, not quite as good as suggested... dont get the sweetness."

"Picked this up at the biggest beer store in the UK, Beers of Europe Ltd. Dark brown, nearly black pour with a tinge of mahogany when held to the light. One finger head that quickly faded with minimal lacing. The nose definitely leans more towards sweet than roasty with hints of dark fruit, vanilla, milk chocolate, and caramel with just a touch of banana. The taste is a bit more complex than the nose, but still leaning to the sweet side. Dark chocolate, dark fruits, and coffee dominate along with hints of bubblegum, toffee, and vanilla. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and not as creamy as I was expecting, with a nice subtle bitter, smooth finish. Not really all that familiar with the style, and it was a little too sweet for my liking, but a solid offering nonetheless."
""
"Taste is very mellow roasted malts. Nothing exciting. Nothing to clamor about. It gets slightly more sweet as it heats up. A little sweet rum flavor to go with the maltiness. Probably a good introductory beer for someone branching out from macro brews."
""
""
"Poured virtually black, thin dark head that left little/no lacing. Smell was a hard to pick up on, but consisted mostly of the roasted tones and those of alcohol- an almost wine like essence. Tasted good, screamed of roasted malt and bitter chocolate. The overall feel could have been creamier considering the style. Overall good beer, but the job I purchased it for (to pour over vanilla ice cream) was better suited for a stout counterpart."

"Cheers!"

"Black colour, with a brown-coffee head, not too big for a stout, also it doesn't hold as much as other stouts, though it leaves a ring that never dissappears. Fantastic smell, dark fruits, licorice, chocolate,roasted malts, hints of vanilla, caramel, some mocha. Medium body, sweet in tongue. Taste Is kind the same of the aroma: dark fruits, chocolate, caramel, mocha... Maybe to sweet for a stout, but it makes a difference. I think I'll buy some more of this one."

"O - it was ok, almost felt like drinking a wine though. Didn't get the flavor or sweetness I was expecting from a sweet stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Conclusion: I don't know what to make of this beer. It is quite good, and a very fine English stout. My first sip blew me away and I thought it might be a new favorite, but after the glass was drained I wasn't was sure. If anything, I like this beer because it is interesting and different from the usual fare."
"Overall I am not quite sure what i think of this stout. Different? Yes. Bad? No. Will acquire again to see what my thoughts are in the future."
"Overall - A great flavor and a great beer. An everyday beer? Maybe not but great for a winter's night."
""
""
""
""
"Full bodied, light effervescence. A nice warming aspect to it mostly at the back of the mouth and tongue. Finish is smooth and mellow. Nice stuff all around."
"Overall- Enjoyable but it could use a little improvement. Needs a little more carbonation."
""
""
"Overall: Not a bad stout, but I would have liked the taste to be smoother."
"O: a good choice overall. I selected it randomly after seeing it on menu and checking reviews here. Very tasty. Enjoyed it as after dinner treat with my buddy at local pub. Would recommend for someone looking for a flavorfull beer that won't overwhelm the taste buds. Really liked how it meshed well as night was winding down."
"The beer appears a deep, dark brown with a lasting beige head. The aroma brings a light roast, chocolates, English malts. I have always enjoyed this beer. I haven't had it in a while, and I am reminded how much I like it. Silky smooth and creamy feel. Chocolate and a delicate roast character, finishing with a milk chocolate creaminess. Lingering notes of chocolate and mild bittering hops. Light bodied and remarkably easy to drink, though I am a huge fan of this style. Overall, a solid beer to which I will return."

""
"O: This is an above average cream/milk stout, and I love the bottle, but I did like the Sam Adams one better. Areas for improvement are the head and the mouthfeel. Still, a solid beer."
""
""
"Overall: A very good beer overall. A good after dinner beer or a nightcap."
""
"Overall good beer. I will pick this up again."
"O. I really enjoyed this beer. as I said I am new to cream stouts, but I liked it."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a difficult beer for me to rate because it's flavorful and because I find it enjoyable, but it wasn't what I was expecting for a cream stout. It still holds up well for a stout, though."
""
""
""
"D: I don't know the ABV but this is surprisingly quaffable, even though a bit rich."
""
""
"I like this one enough to drink it on tap or for less than the 4.99 I spent on it. I don't think this is really a go to beer and perhaps it isn't meant to be. It is a good example of english flavors in a tout for the American who's not given beers from the other side of the pond a try."
""
"When I worked retail I had a guy who'd come and buy this one three cases at a time, cleaning us out with each visit! He rarely bought anything else. He later ended up as a neighbor, and I discovered that he rarely drank alcoholic beverages of any kind!"
""
"I do not like sweet beer. But this one manages to come off as slightly sweet but not at all sticky, with a nice dry finish. All at once pleasant Fuggles bitterness with a lush creamy chocolate flavor and mouthfeel. Mostly roasty malt in the nose, which is strong in the flavor profile along with the milk chocolate. Vague toffee; I got much less coffee than most other tasters. Not complicated or overly busy, just smooth and delicious. Highly recommended as liquid dessert!"
"Rich and a little naughty I guess but not the icky treat your nose prepares you for, seven thumbs up"
""
""
"O- I am not digging this beer- It's like drinking liquid licorice to me and I don't like licorice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a beer I cared for. Surprising since I did like it at a tasting."
"Poured from bottle into pint glass. Deep brown/mahogony, very close to black. Small 1 finger head that vanishes quickly with some okay spot lacing. Smell is coffee and sweet milk/sugar. Falls in line with a milk stout with some dark chocolate coming through on the end. Some fig notes as well, nice complex taste. Feel is of silk and cream. Iced coffee with a mild hint of carbonation. Good, medium mouthfeel to add to the great smooth taste. Overall- Wow, really a surprise. A very good milk stout with complex flavors and great feel. Not quite a session beer, but could drink a few without a problem. Nice body and a solid all around effort. Very tasty-"
"Overall: Maybe I'm spoiled by American stouts, but I was expecting a little more punch. It's good, but not great."
"O – Not too bad at all. I like the tastes and flavors but would love them to jump out a bit more but definitely tasty."
"O: this brew does nothing great but everything well. Its solid all the way around and a very nice value. Will have it again as I would deem it sessionable, affordable and of good quality."
"O - Not the most multi-dimensional beer out there, but very sessionable and just a great drinking experience."
"A lot going on in this stout, too much for me to be honest, boardering on sickly sweet and just a little to creamy for me."
"Overall: Excellent beer overall. This is the best cream stout I've ever had. I highly recommend this one."
"overall: prime example of a cream stout, no attributes are forced with a good progression and decent mouthfeel despite a notable thickness."
"D ~ Not a bad Milk/Cream/Sweet Stout by any means. Just average; it is what it is."
"Nice enough, but nothing outstanding here - move along."
"St. Peters models itself as the classic image of the English brewery, drawing from its locale and surrounding environment to spin together a truly English brew. It's the image Americans seek as they sojourn around the English countryside, hunting for the uber-local beers that distinguish one pub from another. The bottle and label for St. Peters' line of beers adds to this local and Anglo-Saxon flavor, and to be honest, the flavor too. The flavor is sweet and cloying, though without the dark chocolate malts or roasted flavors I typically associated with stouts and their style off-shoots. This is sweet and light, packed with scents of sugary grapes and cough medicine. For those beer drinkers who enjoy well-operated historical events and museums, this tastes like something you'd receive as a sample to illustrate what the original root beer recipe tasted like. I even imagined it tasting like an old-timey panacea, curing all your aches, pains and even stubborn cases of polio. The flavor has a similar taste, with sassafras and the raw herbal quality of a homemade root beer. It's a singular taste, but one I'm unaccustomed to, with a palate and flavor that distinguish this beer as an old-fashioned flavor looking to impact modern palates."
"Would definitely recommend!"
"Nice - lots of flavour. A stout with plenty of roasted malt character and a hint of lactose sweetness to add balance. The only minus is the body, which could have been a tad more substantial. That said, it's a great beer and well worth sampling."
"O: An average stout."
"Check it out if you want to. Not necessarily a must have, but you can certainly do considerably worse."
"M: Medium to heavy body. Carbonation is good as it was held in check. Good warming. A little alc bite."
"Overall a good beer but not top of the class for me. Not enough of that yummy lactose milky/creaminess you get in other better examples, like Lancaster which is still tops in my book. Good but not great."
"A classic in the sweet stout category, and I can see why. The aroma and the flavor are both mellowly sweet with just enough roast to balance and make me believe that it is in fact a stout. Delicious and smooth-I love it."
"O- With 6.5% Abv this is a great pint if you only have time for one, but it's flavor is not tiring on the palate. tasty cream stout with unique flavors which make up for the smell."
"Overall i was surprised how gd this was! A nice solid stout that i will be having again & again."
"As it stands, it is still a very worthy cream stout. And one that should be tried if found sitting in your local brew store."
"O: Overall the beer was pretty good. It looked great coming out of the bottle, but didnt pack to much with its aroma. The taste was pretty good, with the best part being the malty after taste. I'd recommend checking out this beer."
"D - This has good drinkability. It has a real smooth creamy feel to it that just makes it go down very easily. Overall, I thought this was a really nice beer. I haven't had many milk stouts, but I really enjoyed this. I would drink it again."
"Taste was incrediable smooth. Couldn't help but notice a dry vanilla finish. Delightful for a stout. Will buy again although won't share it with my husband."
"O: I really enjoyed this beer--it was a great treat after my 21-mile hike today. :)"
"Overall, a very characteristic British stout, and a good example of the style. Sweetish and malty, very biscuity. If you're an English dark beer fan, yes. If you're looking for a drier Irish stout (I wasn't) pass."
"Poured into a Leffe goblet, a dark brown-black with not quite a finger of light brown head that receded to a patchy layer. Good aroma, though not very pronounced as I'd imagined it would be; roasty malts and coffee beans, with some hints of dark chocolate. Taste was not what I expected either. Subtle caramel, pumpernickel, bitter dark chocolate and coffee...citrusy notes (?). Much more bitter than is typical for a stout, with a lingering aftertaste, and a finish perhaps more suited to a dry stout. Medium mouthfeel, a lot lighter than it seems it should be; drinkable, but not quite something I'd go out of my way for."
"o - very tasty and refreshing easy drinker. my only real compaint is with the price tag, at $6 USD this beer is too expensive for me to like any more than this."
"I'm having trouble finishing the one bomber I started. I can't imagine trying to down another. In fact, this beer may have ruined me for the night. Was worth a try and had high hopes, but that's where it ends."
"This is a good beer. I wonder if they have this on tap anywhere around here? I wonder if that would add that level of carbonation I am looking for."
"Overall: I'm not heavy on stouts but this is a perfectly balanced attempt at a cream stout. A great starting point for anybody interested in the style!"
"O- do all bottles have this...odd flavor to them? If so, I'm not a huge fan. If not, I need a non-infected bottle to try"
"Haven't had this beer for some time...so my memory may be a little foggy on this one but they no longer sell it where I bought it so I cannot obtain it anymore. Regardless- it has a unique bottle, looks very home made in appearance. I really enjoyed the flavor on this one, as well the mouth feel. It was heavy but extremely smooth. Sweet in all of the right places with raisin type sweetness. I could also taste of chocolate. A much more friendly stout compared to others who do not like the more agressive stouts. It is among my top beers that I have had, highly recomended."
"M- Very creamy and smooth. Could be a bit less carbonated."
"Pours a pitch black with medium head. Smells of lactate since I'm assuming that's what they added since it's a sweet stout. It's sweet so there is no alcohol taste even though it's only 6.5 percent ABV so there shouldn't really be any alcohol taste to begin with. It's a nice smooth stout and the creaminess adds a whole another texture. It's a nice change from the usual immense stouts I drink."
"Supremely disappointed considering what I could've bought with this 4 bucks. Let's hear it for the good ol' u.s.a. - who has proven they are the new stout kings of the planet. This watery, alcohol ridden, oversweet-mess can stay on the other side of the pond for all i care. I just can't get over the sourness of this beer. It's like someone took a good American stout and poured a Coor's Light silver bullet into it..."
"D - Dark and fairly complex with a low level of roasted character. There is a distinct note of licorice present throughout that blends well with the molasses like malt. Some roast character does finally come out in the finish with a light coffee note that helps to balance out the significant sweetness. Not bad, but like everything else that I have had from St. Peter's I can't help but think that many other breweries make a better version of the same beer."
"Overall: This beer is not overly special, at about $5 per bottle it's better to just stick with a $10 four pack of some other cream stout, nice bottle and labeling but overall not worth its price."
"O - this is one helluva stout. take whatever means necessary to acquire one of these and try it as soon as possible."
"Very enjoyable stout. Good roast and balance. It's on the dry side but is very balanced."
"O - A really good beer and probably the best milk stout I've had. I would definitely drink this beer again."
"poured pitch black with brown around the edges and a one finger mocha head. each time i smelled it i got something different. everything from fruit, bread, sweet toffee, to roasted coffee. taste had the fruit up front with the bread followed by a slight smokey flavored coffee taste. mouthfeel was slightly creamy but not tooo much with medium amount of carbonation, went down pretty smooth. my overall impression was this is a decent stout and glad i tried it."
"This stout pours out as a black color with a rich creamy tan head. The aroma is big with roasted malts and a little bit of smokiness in the mix too. The taste is slightly salty from the smokiness, the roasted malts give off a really nice toasted burnt quality that really nice. The beer doesn't have too much in way of hops. The mouthfeel is relatively smooth and creamy. Overall this is a pretty good Milk Stout."
"overall - This turned out to be better than I had anticipated and will definitely be buying it again. I think any stout lover will enjoy it."
"Overall this beer isn't QUITE as smooth or sweet as many milk/cream stouts but is still a very solid beer. The British hops really come through but in a pleasing and delicate way, they aren't overly bitter or intrusive. I have had this before and I will have it again."
"This is definitely very drinkable. I think the bitterness might put off some but the medium body means it's easy to get down."
"This beer was better than I anticipated. It's one of the most balanced cream stouts I've ever had. It's far from a mind-blowing beer, but it is definitely worth a try."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and quite sessionable, particularly since it isn't very filling and any traces of alcohol are well hidden from the taste."
"I haven't tried much cream stouts, but this the best I've ever had. Highly recommended!"
"D-Quite easy to drink in terms of alcohol presence. The taste is good but doesn't leave me asking for more."
"D_Very drinkable. Good example of a cream stout."
"D - Much more drinkable than commercial stouts. I could have a couple of these a night without feeling overpowered."
"St. Peter's makes a drinkable milk stout, but not one that I'd ever seek out with the plethora of great options available. It's good, but there are many that are better."
"Drinkability- Easy to drink for a stout but would only enjoy one at the middle to end of the night. Awesome and would point a stout drinker into the direction of this stout for sure."
"Pours black with a slight head and quite a few moderately-sized bubbles. Head recedes quickly without leaving too much lacing behind. The nose has a pretty strong buttery component; another off flavor is not what I need from this brewery after the Pale Ale. There is some slight roast and chocolate as well, so at least there's something to cover the diacetyl up a bit. I'm not that fortunate with the taste, as this is more buttery than the nose, though there still is a slight roast component that shows up. Somewhat dry finish with a bit of a buttery mouth-coating component. Not something I would try again."
"taste starts a chocolately sweet, then gets roasty and dry in the finish. a bit of hops in there. lower carbonation, very smooth mouthfeel. easy drinkin', classic example of the style."
"Poured from a bottle into a beer mug. The beer is jet black with a decent, mid-brown colored, foamy head. The smell is oaky, sweet, and bitter-fruit. The beer is smooth and light in mouth, and the tastes are heavy in cream, coffee-style bitter flavors, dark chocolate, and a little bit of sour undertones. The beer is quick and light on the finish, with a semi-sweet aftertaste. The light bodiedness for a stout makes it very smooth and easy to drink."
"Drinkability : a very good beer in the style sweet stout."
"Conclusion: the taste was basic, but well put together. I will definitely be revisiting this and other St. Peter's brew"
"Wow this beer is really sweet. It has this candy midpalate and late flavors probably from caramelization of the wort. It's medium in body. I just can't get past that caramel flavor! It's AWESOME! Beer is a joy to drink. This brewery is redeemed in my mind. Green bottles and all...seriously though, buy some brown bottles."
"Drinkability: This one went quite fast - a very drinkable stout that went very well with Welsh Rabbit, and I think would be good with many other meals. Since the alcohol is well hidden, it sneaks up on you making this beer a bit dangerous. And yet I wouldn't mind having another one."
"- Overall quite the flavor packed stout for being so light and watery.... more ester and fig notes in this one rather than chocolate or coffee..."
"Over all this is a solid stout"
"Pint bottle, pours a dark brown with mahogany highlights. Finger of creamy head which leaves a little lacing. Nose is caramel sweetness, hints of roast. Open up in the flavor, bitter chocolate, milky sweetness, nice barley roast, caramel, biscuit. A real nice English stout, remarkably drinkable, drinks more like a 4.5% and yet full flavored. Balanced sweetness, surprised me."
"I recommend to try, but I do not plan on buying again."
"Overall, a decent stout, its a pretty filling drink though."
"D: Rather drinkable, I'll definitely be finishing this one, but I'm not sure I'd rush to get another one right away."
"Drinkability - Relatively so. One of the few cream/milk stouts I've had though I am enjoying it tonight."
"D - well aside from the very classy pirate rum smuggler bottle and the nice feel there's not a whole lot outstanding about this beer. Very drinkable but not worth a special trip."
"Great atmosphere. Deep, dark, intimidating appearance with a churning head. Nose is rich and deep although not complex, but a great mix of components. Flavor is rich, and robust, and creamy, and bitter, and sweet.... what a combo. Done very well, as nothing really tries to take first place. Overall, this is a great quaff."
"M: The mouthfeel is very pleasant. It's very drinkable and has a nice body. The only downside is that the stout aftertaste can be bitter with the higher alcohol content."
"It goes great with a shot of cofee liqueur and a nice apple pie."
"D- goes somethin like this: it's 4am, ready for bed, havin a beer right quick, then i'm out. i figured this one would be bout 4.2-5.0% abv and there was no evidence of alcohol in the aroma or flavor so i just keep chuggin away then i look at their website and see this bad boy is 6.5% and the beer's gettin warmed up by now and i get a whiff of alcohol and my thoughts are beginning to wander and i'm writing meaningless shit like this. the point i'm trying to make is that this is a big brew in every category and it drinks like a guinness or something much less potent. went down so easily that i could easily get into trouble easily after a few pints of this potion, easily. see, i'm already being obnoxious. nite."
"You could never tell when staring at the green bottle that this beer would be pure black when it pours into a clear glass but even when held toward the lght I don't see any ruby highlights. Head is a light tan in color wih a great billowing doughnut texture going on. Lacing is fine and even and I can't get over these medicine bottles, a bit different then they used to be but still unique. Nose has some dark roasted malt a hint of black licorice an some smoked malt or peat kilned malts going on. Also hints of coffee and creamy dark chocolate come out in the aroma. Flavor brings on some acidity between the dark roasted malts and the addition of the lactose, this beer finishes slighty tart and smokey with again peat smoked malts kicking in. Earthy fruitines and subdued bitterness from the fuggles and challenger hop additions. Very fresh tasting this beer just came in at my local, the sharp acidic notes and fruity undertones really make this an interesting experience. Solid cream stout from across the pond medium bodied for a stout but not nearly as heavy as the bruising American or Russian versions of this style. Mellow carbonation works well with the style, this gets better and better as it warms up. Drinkability overall is great, a nice flavorful and easy to consume stout this one won't weight you down like many big stouts on the market."
"Though this may sound a bit odd for its style, this beer is definitely a good option if you are craving Russian Imperial Stout flavor wrapped in a lighter (and lower ABV) package"
"D- Very drinkable if you are into English stouts. It would make a good session beer with the relatively low ABV."
"Exceptionally well bottled and packaged and exceptionally good as well. You can judge the book by the cover here. You will notice the nice bottle and label and when you crack it open, it does not disappoint. The beer itself is relatively light for a stout with lower than usual ABV for a stou, bu it has a HUGE taste! These guys really know how to make a good stout!"
"Balanced beer, good taste and looking."
"Good low carbonation and slick body."
"Perhaps St. Peter's would do better with a darker bottle."
"Just great. It's as English as Monty Python, Black Sabbath and bangers & mash, but in a way that would appeal to beer drinkers who prefer big flavor, lots of depth, and some kind of unique character that no other beer has. This one has all that. If you've ever doubted you're into English beers, this one could very well change your mind..."
"Smells like cola and vanilla. The mouth feel jumps out at you as a bit viscous and slick, but this is the first sweet stout I have had in a long time. Probably the worst part of the experience. I have to admit for someone (me) who normally isn't a big residual sweetness sort of person, this works. No roast or toast, mainly dark malt with a little caramel some fruit and a creamy sweetness that hangs around in your mouth a while. the total experience is quite nice, but I could only drink one at a time."
"All in all, not too much special in this brew. Might be ok to try once, but not worth multiple purchases."
"Rich, full body with a pleasant creamy mouthfeel."
"This beer is sweet, and quite so. However as the luxurious fruity and somewhat cocoa-flavored liquid oozes over my palate I am eventually left with a mild bitter, almost tart, and definitely drying finish, that somehow balances the sweetness and keeps the beer well short of cloying. If there is diacetyl I am not able to identify it as such. If I am quibbling, it is to say that the beer could have more dark/chocolate/roast - stereotypical ""stout"" character, as the fruitiness is pretty dominant. The carbonation is soft, the body medium or higher but never overly filling, and it is creamier than many big stouts. Really, really well done."
"Notes: Best before Nov. 2010. Seems like it is somewhere in between a Milk/Sweet Stout and a normal stout, but it shades closer to a milk/sweet. Nice balance of flavor mixing the earthy/roasted bitterness and the sweetness. Also enjoyable to have the chocolate taste go from dark toward milk chocolate during the taste. Nice beer that is worth a try, especially if you want a sweeter stout, but not one with a lot of sweetness. Worth trying if it is reasonably priced, but not one you necessarily have to try."
"D: As opposed to the porter, this is an excellent brew and a great example of this all to rare style. A very enjoyable pint."
"Drinkability: Very good. Alcohol well hidden. Nice interpretation, very distinct. No apparent flaws. Not coying. Nice price/quality ratio. Had this with a Blue d'Auverne cheese, matched great."
"thsi cream stout just wasnt as creamy as I was hoping for. taste good, I enjoyed it. carbonation is off like some one else said. I agree with him. all in all I liked it. not my favorite."
"This beer was very easy to drink but nothing too special for flavor. i would drink again looking for a good wind-down beer after work."
"... excellent example of a prime Burton-style stout."
"D - the mildness makes it both very drinkable and very passable. Were the flavor a little deeper t would be better."
"Wish this one was a little thicker and creamier. Still a good stout."
"Final Thoughts: Well for the most part, St. Peter's continues to disappoint me. This may be worlds better then their English ale but this offering just doesn't quite do it for me. I think fundamentally, the issue here is it comes off as milky instead of creamy. I sadly would not suggest this one."
"Pours an opaque dark-chocolate brown with a thick, if not persistent, dirty beige head. Aroma is smoky with a strong molasses overtone and hints of chocolate. Flavor has a hickory smoke tone and firm hints of chocolate, toffee and licorice. Texture is rough, edgy and a little thick the way a good stout should be. Worth finding."
"I would try it again, but definitely wouldn't buy it."
"Very easy to drink, you can really lay this one back."
"Aroma of roasted barley, mild coffee. Flavor : a huge roasted barley smack, then a nice mild and full malt body makes its way to your palate. A lingering sweetness is present but balances well with the roast caracter that sticks around as well. Finished quite dry and begs you for another sip. Absolutely delicious. Try it!"
"Pint bottle from Life Source Salem. Very handsome looking ale darkest mahogany, with a small yet persistent tan head. Loved the chocolaty,roasty,toasted aroma on this one. Coffee, brazil nuts, dark choclate, very earthy wonderful scent. taste is much the same..very wonderful. Great creamy mouthfeel to this silky and easy over the taste buds. Overall a very nice Stout indeed. Will buy more."
"Really a bit too sweet for me, but not bad. And a nice bottle."
"This is an interesting beer, but do I feel it's intriguing or just weird? I find it being somewhere between a stout and an imperial stout and, I'm sorry but, I don't like it very much."
"D - A very fine example of a sweet stout, and one I will recommend to all of my friends. St Peter's hit a home run with this brew."
"D easy to drink, would have more than one or a larger format. much better than the english ale"
"D - Pretty drinkable. Tasty and little trace of alcohol. I think that one 25oz bottle is enough for one sitting, but if I had started earlier and had a larger appetite, I could have more."
"D - oh yeah!!"
"I enjoyed this beer as I do 90% of stouts though I didn't find it to be a good representation of the style. I was expecting a higher level of sweetness and a slightly more viscous body."
"Not bad in the drinkability department. This is not so thick or sweet that it couldn't be sessionable. Should go well with any dessert."
"D: Not that great of a beer. Fell short of all my expectations and wasn't that pleasant to drink. It really felt like I was drinking bitter water with some chocolate."
"Pretty nice bottle. I think it would be well paired as dessert with Christmas fruitcake, or with some game with some kind of fruit. I recommend giving a good space between sips, because the aftertaste evolves beautifully."
"I've walked by this beer several times in various grocery stores and flirted with the idea buying it. I finally received it over christmas and I must say that I was incredibly disappointed. It could be that this particular unit that I tried was old and had been sitting on the shelf at New Seasons for too long but somehow I doubt that. The disappointment began with very unimpressive foamy head in that there was very little of it. The smell of the beer reminded me of the smell of rubber dirty car tires. The taste overall was drinkable but very unimpressive, nothing creamy about it in fact. From the start this beer is considerably over-carbonated, however, at the end when the carbonation was significantly less which revealed a flavors that I can only describe as sub-par and actually quite unpleasant. ""Resist the temptation and avoid"" is what I tell my friends about this beer."
"This was an ok drink for me. I wasn't wowed by it but it also wasn't bad at all. The bottle is not flashy, but overall this is worth a pick up to try the cream stout experience."
"Glad I finally tried this one - I've walked past it a few times at the LCBO and finally picked one up. A fine stout and a handsome bottle as well."
"D - Really nice and pleasing to drink. A very solid, restrained, old-fashioned tasting beer in the traditional English style."
"Overal, a nice beer, certainly not the best stout I've had, but certainly not the worst! I'd have this in middle-upper of the pack for me."
"good cream stout, a little more brisk than some the others that i've had which is good, because when it comes to stouts i like a bitter roastiness more than a sweet maltiness. but that's me and i keeps it reals."
"had a fresher bottle and it comes out like a export stout expanded in time. it has a very mild earth... very rich vanilla bean and grape esters. the earth is pure toasted malt of nougat and coffee. the earth is delicate but prevalent. doesn't not subside in comparison to the beer. this is much brought about with the light but fluffy body. one of the best milk stouts i've had."
"A deep black body that shines with dark ruby brilliance when backlit. The tan foam piled atop it doesn't last very long, but leaves a nice sticky lace behind as it goes. Smells of milk chocolate, nuts, and a hint of breakfast roast coffee underneath. Tastes of bittersweet chocolate and fruit, finishing with black coffee. Very mild acidity. It's a little roastier on the tongue than it seems in the nose; roasted bitterness leaves a pleasant aftertaste. Medium bodied with smooth carbonation. Feels soft and slick. Balanced and flavourful, it's very easy to like this stout a lot. This is a fine beer for curling up with on a winters night, especially around the holiday season."
"Pours opaque with cinnamon head that dissipates quickly. Smells milky, creamy, chocolate, some nuts. Creamy in taste with some milk chocolate, raisins. Light-medium body with refreshing traits. Highly quaffable and a good milk stout. One worth checking out."
"decent aroma, a bit of the lactose, malts. appearance is splendid: thick and creamy head, no real lacing though. black body with some ruby highlights on the bottom of the glass. taste is a bit milky, bitter, and a great chocolate malt aspect. the feel is a bit thick and overcarbonated, but the only real complaint is the carbonation level, I think it is fine with this body. the aftertaste is perfectly bittersweet. really is an excellent sessioning beer."
"Taste is sweet and roasty with well-balanced hop bitterness adding just enough flavor for this dark wonder. Mouth is smooth to the finish. This is a very drinkable beer for the style."
"Winter is coming and this is a highly recommended sweet stout for those cold Nebraska nights."
"Notes: I'm drinking this stuff after spending the last week drinking Peche Mortel and St. Ambroise Oatmeal Stout, so, I think the bar got set pretty high, and this stuff makes me feel like another bottle sometime. It was interesting, and approachable and just overall a really solid beer."
"Overall a really solid brew, probably the least sweet milk stout I have had--that just makes it more drinkable than most to me. This went down real easy."
"D: No complaints here, as advertised. One stellar creamy stout indeed. Not one of my favorite types of beers, so this will probably be my last. But it will fade with fond memories."
"D: Very balanced and a very good stout."
"Beer poured with a thick carmel head, that was relatively slow to dissipate. The color of black coffee, this beer was beautiful when freshly poured and aromatic too. This in not an overwhelmingly sweet cream stout, it has a nice balanced body and pleasant aftertaste, although somewhat watery. I have sampled this beer on more than one occasion, and in three states (ny,nj,pa) and found that there was some inconsistency amongst the bottles, mainly that some possessed the watery feel, while others did not. Overall an enjoyable brew. : )"
"If there was an award for best bottles this brewery would prob get 5/5 for their originality,the beer pours a dark cola colour with nice carbonation that leaves a one finger head with subtle lacing,the aroma is very aromatic with hints of caramel fudge and a floral bouquet smell aswell,it has an above average mouthfeel with a strong dark chocolate,expresso taste first up followed by a nice smokey,fruity hop finish but not overly fruity just a perfectly balanced out brew that could drink alot of."
"-Oelergud"
"D: A very nice stout. More balanced due to the sweetness than the dry Irish ones."
"Purchased in a 16.9 ounce cool bottle."
"Pours an almost pitch black, with a very small tan head. Smell is a hint of roasted malts. Taste is bitter coffee and chocolate up front, followed by a sweet malt middle, and an earthy, dry bitter finish. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth, nice low carbonation. Super drinkable for 6.5% ABV, this is a great sweet stout that I plan on drinking again."
"Pours a cola color with two inches of light tan head that had good retention before settling to a thick cap. Heavy sheets of lace first appear before receding to spotty lacing. Has an aroma of roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, and oh yea, those lovely English hops. The flavor is not at all sweet for a so-called sweet stout. Has flavors of roasted malt, moca, charcoal, and finishes with some herbal and floral hop flavors. Definate hop bitterness is noted as well as some alcohol warmth. The body is not that substantial. I would say on the lighter side of medium. Carbonation is low so the beer has a soft texture. Lacks the body to give a good creamy stout feel. This is a wonderful stout that packs some serious English hop action. If I could be assured of getting this fresh, it would be a regular in my rotation. A bit on the edge of actually being a Milk/Sweet Stout, at least compared to ones I have had in the past."
"Either way I am disappointed."
"Absolutely pitch black. Thick tan head which is slow to dissipate and leaves generous lacing all the way down my pint glass. Almost looks too good to drink. Aroma is delicious, roasted malts, coffee and general ""stoutiness."" Flavor and mouthfeel leave nothing to be desired smooth creamy, roasty, malty...yummy. I could drink this all day. Possibly my new favorite stout, but I have three more to try today."
"D: A fantastic cream stout -- easily the best and most flavorful I have ever had. I will be picking this up many more times in the future."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with smoked meet, prunes, and sweet malt clinging to the palate."
"Pours deep dark brown with light amber hues noticeable on the sides. Very thin tan head. Smells of sweet cream and roasted malts. This beer has a medium body which harbors a delicate sweet cream flavor against a deep roasted malt backdrop. Finishes lightly hopy along with burnt coffee and earthy notes making their way forward as well."
"D: I like this one. Very tasty and well balanced. Drinks really easily. Not your biggest stout though, but it's not supposed to be that either."
"mouthfeel/drinkability- body was a bit thin but that only makes it more drinkable - this is a stout you can drink in hot summer weather (like today 90+)"
"D: A pretty drinkable beer due to a nice mouthfeel and taste combination. Pretty solid drinking beer and fairly smooth. Worth a shot if you get the chance."
"Rich smooth and creamy. Very drinkable and a decent overrall milk stout."
"A good brew that was well worth trying, but it's calling itself a cream stout and if I wanted dark fruit I'd have cracked the bottle of Old Rasputin I've got in the fridge."
"It's been a while since I've had a stout like this, and it sure was a pleasure!"
"mouthfeel is a bit grainy or bubbly maybe. the light flavors really make this a drinkable beer though."
"Wonderfully drinkable. Could enjoy this any time of day, any time of year. Highly recommend this one."
"T: smooth almost subdue flavor Starts with a sweet creamyness followed by a small hop bit and finishies with a well roasted malt."
"Another great milk/sweet stout. This is the third time I've had St. Peter's Cream Stout but the first time I've been able to review it; nonetheless, each time has been quite enjoyable.  Decently complex stout with a pleasant mouthfeel makes this a treat to drink. I can definitely recommend this beer."
"This is a supremely drinkable stout. Very smooth feel, with a nice creaminess. Nice, full body. Very good beer."
"Classic glad-I-had-it case for me."
"It's a nice stout. Pleasant characters and a smoothness that makes it pretty drinkable. Just doesn't have the complexity of the interest to make it truly brilliant, unfortunately."
"D- A decent example of the style, but a bit too sweet and British for my tastes."
"Notes from and tasted on: 4/23/09"
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, slightly filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a good stout that's mild but not too mild and is worth drinking for a while."
"A pleasant drinking stout."
"M/D - Nice and sticky. Exactly what I like in a stout. Just the right level of carbonation makes this one drinkable. Not that I would want to slam a bunch of them, but hey, it's a stout. I was really surprised by this beer, and it will probably be my stand-by (non-imperial) stout."
"This is a solid English Stout, though some of the little nuisances make it go down the hatch a little slower."
"Poured nicely into a 20 ounce pint glass- so I could get the whole beer in there. I didn't chill it down too much and I was rewarded with a nice tan creamy head that stayed throughout. Chocolate and caramel aromas, accompanied by a sweet molasses. A slight notice of hops in the back keeps this beer from being too sweet. A very well balanced cream stout- sorta subtle and lets you know that someone really took the time to make this balanced. A creamy texture and the maltiness of it sticks to your lips after each sip. A must try if you like stouts."
"Drinkability is impressive. an exceptional combination of strong flavors, a nice light creaminess, a solid mouthfeel, and a fairly nice looking brew. I'd definitely recommend this one as a solid stout... and a fair example of a cream stout. Definitely worth having again."
"In terms of drinkability: This isn't as heavy as I thought it would be, so it's pretty easy to drink in terms of heaviness...for a cream stout. But it seems like it gives you a buzz easily (is it really just 6.5%?). Overall, it's definitely easy to drink one, but having a second one right afterwards isn't of interest to me."
"One of my favorites beers; have a black color, putting it against the light, there's a reddish very dark color; thefoam is creamy and abundant, looks like ice cream with coke; the smell have essences of prunes, toast malts and blueberries; the taste is exquisite, it's smooth bitter with some coffee, chocolate and blueberries; the mouthfeel is like american coffee; have a great body, a creamy consistency and decent level of alcohol; very good to accompany cookies, and also to take it alone; if i was an english priest, i would always drink this beer."
"Still a drinkable beer though. Goes down smooth, no bitter aftertaste. I might get this once in a while as something different but overall, i have other milk or cream stouts id rather be drinking."
"A drinkable stout. I enjoyed this beer - don't *need* to have one again right away, but would enjoy it if I did."
"Drinkability: Smoky/roasty flavor is overdone and makes this one difficult to drink at first. That flavor eases up a bit with time and gives way to sweeter, flowerier notes. Still, I wasn't a big fan. Seems to be flavored similar to an Irish dry stout."
"D. Very pleased with this beer, as reflected in my scoring. Not a super expensive beer and definitely worth a try."
"What an enjoyable drinkable beer this one is. Pours a nice dark, almost black mahogany with a thin caramel head. The smell is slightly sweet molasses. While others here have complained that this beer is not especially complex, I would agree to a point. While it might not be the most complex beer, I found it was smooth and creamy with a delicious flavor. I could drink many of these happily (and I think I will)."
"D) Goes down smooth but probably couldn't drink it all the time. Overall, it's a good stout that's definitely worth adding to your regular selections."
"Drinkability - not my every day style, but I enjoyed it. I am glad I had someone to split it with, as I'm not sure I would've drank the whole thing in one sitting."
"Overall this does more of the 'stout' and less of the 'cream' - this isn't a bad beer but I've had better cream stouts."
"D - Drinkable, but certainly needed to be throw into a mix. I don't know that I could put more than one down in a night as I tend to like to jump around. It is very good and should be tried by any stout lover. I'll go for one again in the future."
"Pleasantly surprised with this beer. Many flavors dance across the tongue...bitter chocolate, raisins, smoked malt and coffee beans. Smooth, creamy and nicely balanced with a toasty malt and English hop finish. I really enjoyed this beer and look forward to the next time I have it."
"Pours a small head on a black body and minimal lace. Very thick malt smell with hints of chocolate and roasted malts. Extremely smooth and creamy with a large amount of cocoa malt for a sweetness that is always on the palate. Hints of toffee and caramel malt also. The beer is balanced with roasted and some coffee malt for a pleasantly dry backbite, although it is a little too much (I wish the sweetness and creaminess could just taper off on the backend rather than be overpowered). A great session beer."
"This brew is a very good offering from St. Peter's. If I had to log a complaint, it would be that this stout is too thin and less of a cream offering. However, it is full of flavor and easy to drink despite being 6.5% abv."
"Drinkability: As i explore more and more of the styles I like, I stumbled upon this little gem. Well balanced and flavorful, definitely a hit."
"Nose is smoky and malty. Distinctly toasty or burned to taste, dominated by malts with a slightly chalky mouthfeel. This is offset somewhat by a hint of creaminess. Most of the presence of this beerseems to be in its mouthfeel. After that a fairly average stout, well made but not remarkable."
"Dark brown, out of a pint bottle, with a small tan head. The smell was nice. Chocolate with a hint of coffee. The taste started out a very nice chocolate, but after a few sips the bitterness increased, and it had a hint of bitter through the rest. On average, this beer was average. Not bad, but there are others I'd rather drink, but I wouldn't turn it down if someone gave me one either."
"D - Good beer, a little on the creamy side, if you want something different than this would be a good pick"
"The appearance is a dark brown/black with the consistency of a watery stout. The smell is predominantly smoky, which flows into the taste. The taste is the sharp, bitter, smoky taste noted previously, but has a bit of light fruity characteristics, with a bit of a plum and cherry. Does not have enough smoothness for a cream stout, and the finish is a good indicator of this, with a slightly sour, smoky flavor to the tongue."
"It's not bad, but there are better examples of the style."
"D - The bottle is a goner, no problems with drinkability. Wouldn't want more than one at a time though."
"(rated Mar 28, 2007)"
"Pours a dark black color body, with almost no head, tan-colored. Has a strong aroma of coffee, mocha, some chocolate, some hops. Very fizzy, taste of coffe, chocolate, slight pale bitter aftertaste. Light texture, not thick."
"drinkability is nice. fairly balanced. i was pretty excited by the aroma, but the taste fell flat a little. still, overall a nice stout that i've had many times and will happily pick up again."
"I normally hate these organics, but every now and then you get one of these that make it all worthwhile. It makes you wonder why the others are so bad."
"D: Definitely not a standout in the cream stout class, but I wouldn't turn down a glass either."
"Least alone, you gotta love their bottles! While more common now, I still love popping into the Coat of Arms in Portsmouth, where I first discovered this gem. The pour is a bit weak looking & the head is small and now as creamy rich as you might expect. It has a dark-orangey brown appearance and a nice complex taste that is easy to keep drinking. There is a nice chocolate-malt with hint of cinnamon and lemon hops in the taste. While not the 'best' example of cream stout, I still love it."
"Poured dark chocolate brown. White, small bubbly head. Roasted malt and chocolate in the nose. Tastes of the same, smooth and creamy in the mouth. Just enough hops for a nice clean finish. My favorite of their offereings so far. Excellent English Stout."
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a large light brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of dry coffee and light roasted malt. Taste is also dominated by some dry coffee with some roasted malt. Body is somewhat creamy, which I enjoyed, but also too thin with some average carbonation. Not bad but definitely one of the best from this hit or miss brewery."
"A solid cream stout, my only complaint is the breweries ""house flavor," which I can't knock them for too much. I wouldn't drink more than a couple of these in an evening though."
"Pours a very dark black/brown color with hazy brown head. Smells of coffee and chocolate. Mouthfeel is almost like chocolate milk, thick and sweet with roasted chocolate flavors and coffee, very tasty. Definitely one of my favorite cream stouts, I will look for this beer whenever I am in the mood for something dark and heavier. Not quite as flavorful as say, Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout, but definitely up there on my list of Stouts. I enjoyed the less-than-smooth mouthfeel, especially with the complexity this beer offers... I am perfectly fine having it a bit oily/syrupy."
"Pours an opaque black with a one-finger tan head that reduces to a foam slick. Decent lacing. Smells of sweet chocolate/coffee and dark roasted malts. Taste is similar, but with a strong bitter character and some metallic phenols in the background. Mouthfeel is thick and slightly oily. Overall, a nice beer and a refreshingly balanced cream stout."
"So far out of three St. Peter's brews I've had I've felt that all of them could have been a little smoother this one included."
"D - Not a bad beer, but one is all I really want."
"A real old school English stout with lots of depth and no one dominant flavor. At the same time, the strength and mouthfeel would preclude more than one or two in a session."
"500 ml. bottle. Pours a black, with a brownish-red hue with an average creamy light-brown head. Aroma is mainly malts, roasted, nutty, chocolate, and coffee. Flavor is roasted malts, coffee, and a bitter earthy hop finish. Medium bodied with a weird bitter, metallic, and dry finish."
"Didn't seems as sweet as other milk stouts, and veered into more well-trodden territory, but it was a solid beer regardless of style. The flavours are well-melded and mellow, and the smoothness helps to give it excellent drinkability."
"Pours very dark brown almost black color with a thick coffee-colored head. Beautiful aroma of malty chocolate, coffee, toffee, and hints of dark fruits. Wonderful roasted coffee taste mixed with dark chocolate and dark berries. Dry finish. Great beer!"
"This is certainly one of the better Milk Stouts that I've tried but it doesn't quite stack up to Mackeson's in my book. I will be trying the St. Peter's Porter next."
"I had been eyeing this one for a while and was dissapointed when I finaly got to try it. Pour head retention, lousy mouth feel very thing feeling, to much bitter burnt for me, looked black. I realy wish I had a better experience with this one. Would have been nice to have a little more complexity to it. Although I haven't had to many milk/sweet stouts I hop most of them are better than this one."
"I loved this so much I had to go get another bottle! I would definately get this wonderful stout cream again!"
"Bottle from the LCBO- Deep opaque black pour is capped with a thin, but lingering layer of mocha froth. Milk chocolate in the nose leads to musty dark chocolate, some faint grassy hops, black coffee, with a lactic presence. Tastes of semi sweet dark chocolate, a lactic milky blast follows, leading to coffee, anise, and a decent hit of bittering hops. Creamy and bitter finish, with a nice lingering lactic aftertaste. A favourable beverage to ward off this particularly cold October evening."
"If you like a dry stout, you'll find a pretty solid one here. A good call."
"500 ml bottle, at Haket, Göteborg. Served with a Chimay glass. Black colour, low tan head. Nice roasty aroma with strong notes of prunes and chocolate, hints of liquorice and pipe tobacco. The flavour is creamy and mellow, but also distinctly roasty with notes of coffee and chocolate. A very fine beer."
"Future outlook: Repeat business imminent."
"Bottle thanks to mmm///beer. Man thanks big time for this gem. First off, as I have said before I am simply a sucker for a nice English Stout, in my opinion they are some of the best beers in the world. This beer is proof positive. Pours a pure black color, some reddish light tries in to come through, but barely. A nice thick brown head tops the brew. A great aroma of rich brown sugar, roasted malts, hops, some fruit, and some smoky/meaty flavors too. The flavor is top notch; initial sweet chocolate and brown sugar flavors followed by a nice smooth fruitiness. Throughout the roasted malt flavors are dominant. Some vanilla and bitter hops in the finish. Milky and creamy flavors combine with a great creamy and full body to produce and awesome brew. Just great."
"Poured a very dark almost completely black color with no ruby tones that I could detect. Had thin tan head that dissipated quickly. Aroma was nice; chocolate and roasted malts. Flavor also consisted of roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, and caramel. Mouthfeel was good. Flavor improved as it warmed. Drinkability was high."
"Extremely dark body. No ruby tones when held up to the light. Thin tan head. faint burnt toast smell and coffee grounds with a whiff of sweeter caramel or toffee. Complex flavours.A dark chocolate aftertaste. Smooth. Flavour get's more impressive as you drink it. Very good indeed."
"D & Notes: To me, this is basically a higher ABV version of a Samuel Adams Cream Stout (one of my all time favorite beers), but doesn't quite hit the smooth rich mouthfeel that a SA Cream Stout does. That said, this is a good beer, if you are like me, and like a good cream stout (***note to all you Guinness drinkers, this is NOT the same as an Irish Dry Stout). It's an excellent winter splurge, as the high ABV is warming, and all the good flavors I expect in a cream stout are there."
"D - OK, drinkable stout. Not the most flavourful stout. Nice dry, roasty stout."
"Pours an opaque black, some dark red in the edges, very thin big bubbled brown head forms, quickly disappears, no lacing, thin bubbles on the edge, looks okay but head is a disappointment. Smell is nice, cream, roast, chocolate, caramel, cherries and other dark fruits, very creamy smelling, chocolate milk, nice and rich. Taste is nice, very roasty and biscuity, chocolate milk, dark fruit, raisins, caramel, nice bready malt, grainy finish, quite dry and fruity, very creamy. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, very smooth, I really like the dry roastiness in this. Nice to drink, better carbonation would help but otherwise this is a nice stout."
"D: Quite drinkable for its strength."
"This was almost impy-stout like with a good hit of coffee. Sytlistically it's odd. This is best room temperature, the cold really takes away from the sweetness and body."
"I can defnitely see the attraction but it's a bit too heavy duty for me to want often."
"I liked this beer but if you are looking for a milk stout look somewhere else."
"St. Peter's may have mislabeled the beer, but they did a great job brewing; this is a nice stout, whatever you call it. It has just the right level of roast and depth in flavour to keep from boring but is quaffable enough to enjoy two, maybe three, and certainly doesn't let on to the extra percent or two alcohol. All considered, a very nice offering indeed."
"pours a solid black color with a nice 1 inch brown head. nice lacing. the nose is sweet malts, subtle roasted malts, hints of vanilla, some chocolate, oak. the taste is the same as the nose but also with some slight citrus in the finish. Weird! got your traditional watered down English Ale taste. subtle spicy hops, medium to full bodied, low carbo, dry finish."
"This is a fantastic stout. Immensely complex and very easy to drink. Seek this one out."
"Out of the bottle this beer was a classic opaque black with a huge, billowy, brown head. The head displayed very good retention eventually devolving from a rocky cap to a thin layer.Very nice sticky lacing too. Earthy aromas of coffee, rich soil, roasted malt and hints of tobacco. The flavors were rich and dark, unsweetened chocolate and espresso coffee first hit my tongue followed by roasted and charred malt with hints of creamy sweetness in the middle followed by the long bitter finish. The mouthfeel was very smooth but thin for the style which is also a result of the light carbonation. Though the flavors are on and it is quite enjoyable I felt this beer lacked a bit of the weight and assertiveness others in its class posses."
"D - An overall good stout wouldn't be my first choice when picking out a stout to drink but its better than others out there worth trying sometime"
"D: If I was visiting the UK and they had this beer and an open fire, I would be more than happy to sit and drink a good few and get all rosy cheeked next to the flames. Highly recommend it and can't wait to try the St. Peter's Old-Style Porter than is waiting for me."
"Shared this with my father-in-law over the weekend. Poured into a chalice black with a thin, sandy head which disappears soon after initial pour. Aroma is of berries, roasted malt, and chocolate, with lots of sweetness. Mouthfeel is a little slick, a little thin based on the look, medium carbonation balances well. Taste up front is sweet chocolate, some toffee, berries, with a bit of vinous, sour finish. Drinkability was quite high; I would love to try another one of these. This was the first cream stout I have tried, and it tasted completely different from what I was expecting. Overall, a solid brew."
"OVERALL: Very drinkable because it tastes nice and is not overwhelming. Not as tasty as others I've had, but is very enjoyable and looks better once the massive uneven head levels out into a nice thick layer. Definately something I could drink a few of."
"This is a nice cream stout. I wish I could get a brand new fresh bottle in the UK. I can only imagine the difference."
"T-/M/D- Lots of dry bakers chocolate up front, subtle coffee notes and hints of apple and hop bitterness. Fairly light in body for a cream stout, it was lacking the creaminess. Still a damn good beer though, very drinkable."
"very little carbonation. for the most part an enjoyable beer. nothing to write home about but good none the less"
"saved the best til last by the look of the ratings of St Peters beer's, and the last one I had (ipa) made me almost not buy this, i am happy i did... pours a jet black colour, with a proud hearty head, similar to guinness of all things... vanilla, chocolate, guinness aromas ... some nice flavours, alcohol shows abit , nice roastiness and a smooth drinker ... leaves a clean aftertaste ... enjoyable .. ""frank, you rascal"""
"A sweet, smooth, mild flavor gives this beer great drinkability despite its hefty nature. One could certainly, slowly, enjoy a few of these without becoming overwhelmed."
"D - I've tried 3 other St. Peter's brews and was slightly disappointed, but this one surprised me at how tasty it was. It is clearly worth the price."
"D- I think one 16.9 ounce bottle is enough for a sitting."
"I like this one, and could have a couple, but not much more than that. A very intense version of the style, but the heavy layers of flavor make you want to move onto something else, or share the second bottle. Worth a try, by far. Oh, you'll pay ofr this pleasure -- $4.50/bottle, Boston prices."
"bottle: pours a thick black with a tan head which is minimal. Aroma is chocolate, caramel, very malty, licorice, alcohol, and slightly hoppy. Taste is got a nice roastiness to it, chocolate, somewhat nutty, nice and big malt notes, nice and thick, and an alcohol tinge to it. Palate is bitter, not carbonated at all, long and lively. Overall, This is a decent Sweet stout. This is a really solid beer."
"D - A good stout overall. Really nice on the nose, and has some good flavor. Bulk up the body a little and this would be even smoother."
"Pours a ligh black with highlights of prune juice. Just a mediocre head quickly recedes to nothing. The aroma is a tantalizing lactosey cream and bananas mixed withdry roasted malts and coffee beans, with just a touch of smoked peet. The taste is a creamy, yet gypsum dry cream with fruity notes of banana and bubblegum. Dark roasted malts giving off flavors of coffee grounds and light coccoa powderwith a touch of walnut. The dryness and powdery palate feels just stupendus, the finish is actually quite velvety though. My favrite milk stou so far."
"Unlike many ""sweet stouts"" I've had, this one is not sweet at all, and I love it. Bittersweet German chocolate, English hops, and coffee beans all create a wonderfully full and bitter flavor. Don't get me wrong, there is a bit of sweet toasted malts here as well, but it certainly doesn't overtake what is a kickass English stout. Forget those overhopped American stouts; this one shows how to properly give a stout some bite. I really liked this beer and would recommend it highly."
"The appearance was average at best, nothing remarkable. You can't miss the chocolate flavor yet it's not overpowering. Smooth mouthfeel, high drinkability. Nice tan colored lacing around the glass but the head did die off rather soon. At about 7 bucks a bottle, I wish I had bought a few more."
"Drinks easier than a stout should. That's not a defect, I'm just wishing I had another, as it is going away too soon."
"Overall, a great example of Cream stout... smooth almost chewy mouthfeel."
"Medium bodied stout with sweet malt, lactic tartness, and smooth creamy finish. Carbonation provides a nice zest so it doesn't drink too milkshake-like as you'll find with many nitro stouts these days."
"With almost no carbonation, the beer felt delicious on the palate. It lead to a tremendously drinkable brew where 16.9 oz wasn't nearly enough. Despite the jet-black appearance, it's neither thick nor heavy and goes down so smoothly. As I find it hard to say what the best beer I've ever had is between styles, I can without a doubt say that this is one of the single best beers I've ever had - certainly the best in this style - thus the high rating. Highly, highly recommended."
"Taste is roasted with coffee notes. The roast is not sharp and adds a nice maltbitter. Hops are present and add a great earthy hoppiness and bitterness. I am not sure where the cream comes from, but for sure the mouthfeel is smooth. Aftertaste is dry and lingers through with a perfect blend of roast, coffee, bitterness and a complex tartness."
"MF&D- Thin for a cream stout. Didnt coat the mouth too well and didnt leave behind much flavor. Drinkable beer although I wouldnt go out of my way to try it again."
"This poured an opaque brown/black with no head. It smelled like chocolate and raisins with some vanilla and malt. Its flavor was strong coffee bitterness with roast malt for balance. It was oily with no carbonation, and its aftertaste was mild at first but grew more bitter over time. Overall this was not the most flavorful stout, and wasn't very different from their porter, but it was still decent."
"Overall I can't say I hated it, but there was something about it that was a little ""off""; I can't quite put my finger on it, but the raisin-y characteristics were both unexpected and unwanted, and it just wasn't as smooth as I would have hoped for a sweet/milk stout."
"Pours a dark brown/black with a short and sort of thin tan colored head that laces the glass somewhat but not as much as I would have expected for a stout. The aroma is of sweet malts and some very faint chocolate and cream flavors at the end. The taste is the same. A very rich and sweet malty backbone underneath layers of faint cream, chocolate, and toffee and then a little bit of burnt malt in there as well. A complex taste, but not as creamy as I was hoping for. The mouthfeel is good with a very fresh and creamy feel to it. The drinkability is pretty good as I could have another one of these."
"D: A very easy to drink stout. As I drink it, I like it more and more. It's a little filling to have much more than one bottle, but definitely something to enjoy over a longer sitting."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Despite the fact that I don't enjoy the flavor of this beer, it still has a good mouthfeel, spot on for what this style should be. It is creamy and velvet-like on the palate. Carbonation is lower as not to take away from the smoothness of the beer. Finish is somewhat dry with a hint of roasted/black grains. This is a beer I will not buy again, ever. It is just not for me. Every time I go to take a sip that aroma I can only describe as ""cooked vegetable"" makes me want to gag. I am just not into this milk stout. However, it does look appetizing and it also has a great mouthfeel."
"D: Very rich dark and enjoyable for fans of this style."
"This is an excellent Cream Stout in the traditional genre. Obtained from the bottle, it poured pitch black with a nice head. Flavors were initially watery, but finished well with chocolate and roasted malts. The aftertaste was excellent and further defined the flavors."
"O: One and done... not interested in a second, but it was decent while it lasted"
"I've sampled this beer in the past (but a long time ago) and it seems better than remembered. A quality stout I wouldn't mind picking up occasionally."
" Good stuff that I will certainly buy again. Right away? No, but at some point, yes. Buy one."
"1 pint, 0.9 fl oz cyndrilcal bottle copped singly from Bottle King in Parsippany... I heard a lot of good things about St. Peter's Cream Stout, so I was hoping it would live up to its hype... had the brewery's Winter Ale, which was absolutely superb, but this one, which, although wasn't bad, failed to leave the same impressive mark on me... Nice jet-black, ebony appearance with a reddish-tan, frothy head... smell, as expected, contained the usual stout-like elements of cocoa notes and latte, but the flavor was average to say the least - taste didn't complement the aroma as I was anticipating... rather bland and watery and dull without too much flavor or that typical creamy, lactose, sugar-sweet flavor... ""watered-down"" is the best way I can describe it... not too much to brag about here... mouthfeel was decent and drinkability wasn't bad due to the rather modest 6.5% ABV, although I certainly wouldn't make this my session beer for the evening... not bad, worth a try, but I wouldn't break my back seeking this one out..."
"Thicker and creamy on the palate with moderate carbonation but a very fine bubble structure that makes for a distinct brightness at first sip. Just a touch of burnt dryness also. Much more complex than at first impression. A masterful rendition of the style. The fact that it's not too sweet either heightens the drinkablity dramatically in my opinion. Extremely tasty overall."
"Post Note - After looking at the ratings, there are quite a few that are rated higher. It looks like I'll need to do some more research."
"Came in the medicine bottle. Is there any other form? Note to self: these bottles would be great to save for home brewing. Anyway, it poured black as Dr. Pepper with a minimal ring head and some lightly chunky lacing. Aroma is strong on the alcohol esters with an ambience of toasted malt; you can taste the 6.50% ABV. Taste is a bit better than average, and entirely in character for, what you'd expect with this style. Mouthfeel is actually a bit on the thin side. A decent stout, but for the money, I'm hard pressed to say it's better than a draught Guinness or a great domestic stout like Old Rasputin or Big Bear Black Stout."
"D - Excellent beer through and through. Smooth and flavorful, the coffee roasted malts make this truly extraordinary. A true cream stout!"
"The most noticeable thing I remember from this beer was it's creamy taste and texture. It was like drinking a beer flavored cloud, with some coffee and chocolate mixed in for good measure. And not that cheap chocolate you get in the shape of a bunny around Easter. We're talking quality chocolate. Maybe some rich fruity flavors too, but I couldn't quite tell. I will have to try it again."
"Overall quite a good stout that is pretty well balanced with the only major detraction being its syrupy mouthfeel. definitely worth picking up if you spot it."
"D: I do respect the beer though it is not a beer I would drink regularly. I would drink from time to time and not in a social high scene."
"pours a pitch black color with a large medium tan head with a easy pour with lots of sticky lace. aromas od dark chocolate, roasted malts, fresh coffee. taste is same but creamy smooth from front to rear of the palate ending in a slight bitterness that is very pleasing. mouthfeel is full bodied with a very light carbonation which adds to the silky smooth feel. price is a little prohibitive otherwise very drinkable."
"---Update: Well it's winter, time to start buying it up!"
"This is a solid stout, and I'd definitely recommend it to fans of the style"
"·	Drinkability: This is a great beer to sit down and savor, full of character."
"D - Very nice beer but at $9AUS a bottle I had to pay there is many other options I'd go to before this again."
"D: This is a very drinkable stout. Pretty straightforward, but very tasty and drinkable."
"Super drinkable...I could have another...Too bad I only bought one. :("
"This was my first time trying a St. Peter's product. I've passed them by for years, and I'm glad I finally decided to pick one up. Much better than I anticipated. Pours Black with a nice creamy head that eventuallyfades to a ring. No lacing to speak of. Smell is somewhat sweet and definitely creamy with notes of bittersweet chocolate. Very gentle. The flavor is a bit less gentle, but the mouthfeel is soft and creamy. Great notes of cream, bitter chocolate, a slight roastiness seamlessly integrated. Quite a nice cream stout."
"Appearance of this beer was very dark, looking black, with a dark tan head with good lacing. Smell was of sweet chocolate, and some bitter notes. Taste was very sweet at the entry, with good coffee notes at the middle of the palate. It got a bit sweeter as it warmed. Mouthfeel was good, a little more carbonation then I like but didn't take anything away from it. Drinkability is ok, doesn't go down as smooth as I would have liked. Overall this is good stout, and another good offering from this brewery. Will definitely purchase again."
"Overall, excellent!! Perfect. Amazing. Very drinkable. Sessionable. Glad I have another bottle."
"picked up one of the new round bottles since I could be assured it was at least somewhat fresh...Peace Street Market, Raleigh"
"D: Very drinkable beer. On this the first pretty cold day of the Fall, St. Peter's Stout has a nice hearty warm taste. Tis the season for heavier brew."
"D- I would buy this again without hesitation specially during the winter months."
"I had my eye on this one for some time and on a lark took it home for inspection. Poured into pint glass ace of spades black. The smell is quite strong or perhaps mybottle was on the shelf for some time but i lost a few nose hairs after moving away. The hopp taste was almost overpowering. Drink this one fast unless you want to experience the strength of the abv as the clock ticks. While very thin and smooth it had elements of carmel syrup. Only for the strong and brave for this one."
"The cream stout poured out nice, looking like liquid black velvet. It had a nice, cream, tan head with good lacing. Nice scent, too, with just hints of chocolate and coffee coming through, but not as much there, or with the usual stout scent, as I excpected. It has a nice taste, creamy and smooth with hints of chocolate. The first few drinks were the best, but it just doesn't seem to hold up over the whole bottle. Feels nice going down, but nothing spectacular there, either. It's worth a try if you like stout, but there are others I'd recommend first."
"Drinkability: If you like like your beer with tons of dark roasted flavors with a light mouthfeel and it's brewed by a brewery with tons of history to it, then this is your beer. For me, I actually enjoyed this beer. I was expecting a few dark roasted, but that many. It was so good that I might buy this one again and I would like to see what thier other brews will taste like. Even though my bottle was good, I'm still cautious about how the color of the bottle will hold up against the light."
" A subtle aroma of yeast fruitiness and dark malt pervade this example. A round, soft and modestly full mouthfeel make for excellent quaffability. Cream stout is accurate as malt roastiness and chocolatey sweet ale flavor add to the finish. An excellent example of the cream stout style w/ rich body, luxurious mouthfeel, mocha sweetness and subtle hop spice."
"Good stout."
"D- This beer had some nice full flavors but not a great deal of depth. The smoke made me think this was an age-old recipe with wood dried malts. Nice flavor and an interesting twist."
"D: Because of the mouthfeel, I can't picture myself drinking a lot of this. But, in all honesty, the carbonation doesn't burn the tongue, and it does go down pretty smooth."
"Interesting reading the variety of reviews on this one. It sure does look good, from the throw-back vintage bottle look to the dark licorice-black color with its big light brown head and substantial lacing. The smell also suggests licorice along with some chocolate and brown sugar. I find it quite true to its name upon first sampling. Although a little ""lighter"" than I expected, it had a frothy, creamy feel full of sugary licorice and brown sugar. The taste matches the aroma in my book and its pretty good. But I do find this one a bit too sweet and I don't pick up the malt quality I would like. About half through this mugfull I opted for some mild cheddar cheese and it really brought this beer around, and made the cheese taste better than usual, as well! There is a decided smoke finish that becomes more prominent as you go. I like it but I'm not sure that the cheese might be a necessary accessory. Like most all St. Peters stuff, worth a try and I will be happy to do the Cream Stout & cheese extravaganza again any time."
"I was excited about this one- it was a great looking brew on the pour- velvety black with a nice tan head and great aromas- bittersweet chocolate, cool clean malts and a hint of toasted bread. The actual taste was another story- flavors were weak and extremely unappetizing. The malts were not present, snor was there any sweet creaminess, or body to speak of- the body was surpisingly light and watered down. The flavor of burnt chocolate permeated the entire beer from beginning to end- the only departure was a bitter hop splash at the end which could not save this harsh stout. I'll stick to my Mackeson's."
"Note: This is my 400th beer review! Holy crap I drink a lot of beer!"
"This offering pours a dark brown almost black leaving a thick creamy head that sits on top of the beer and clings to the side. The aroma is vanilla, coffee, chocolate, cookies, very nice sweet aroma. The taste is syrupy, great mouthfeel, the flavor moves to chocolate, vanilla, and so sweet and delicious, a slight hop profile, that finishes bland. But this is a solid cream stout, syrupy, coffee, toffee, caramel, great beer."
"A surprisingly good stout from a very decent established brewery. A chocolate black appearance with creamy black head. Bittersweet taste that is balanced. Overall better more enjoyable that the Guinness for Belgiums the night before. Medium plus mouthfeel, understated carbonation.Nicely hopped."
"I feel that this stout is somewhat too bitter in areas. Not as smooth as I hoped as well. Still not too bad but not quite what I had read about in other reviews."
"Pours jet black with dark crimson flecks  large, brown, rocky / foamy head. Thick lacing is left behind. Aroma is a complex potion of red wine, musk, milk chocolate, toffee, and earth / dust. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and fizzy. Flavor is deeply earthy and sour  coffee, grass, red wine  with a sweet undertone of milk chocolate, molasses, squash, and tomato. Dark cocoa in the finish; aftertaste is warm, dry, and lightly bitter."
"Its good enought that I get one once in a while, but its kinda strong (and this is coming from a guy who drinks Victory's Stormking regularly--god I love it.) The alcohol could be better masked somehow. The after taste is pleasant, but goes unappreciated in the initial cold beginning."
"Drank this from the distinctive green St. Peter's Brewery bottle. I tried this once, a couple years ago, with mixed results, and I'm ready to give it another whirl. Poured into a standard pint glass. Thin, off-white head that dissipated fairly quickly. Nice smells of dark roasted coffee, some toasted grains, a touch of syrup. Not too complex, but not bad. Taste is really centered around the bittersweet coffee. Some molasses in there, too. Good, clean finish to it. Mouthfeel is the appropriate creaminess for a good stout. Not super thick, but not watery at all. Definitely an above-average stout. Nice, balanced flavors and aromas. Very pleasant to drink. Well worth checking out."
"Drinks pretty easy for than the ABV, this is much better than first sample!"
"Lacks depth all the way around in the end, which just means it could be better. All in all though, it's pretty easy drinking stout. Easy to enjoy, without having to devote full attention in order to get the most out of it."
"There's a little carbonation and some harshness in the mouthfeel that hurt this beer, but overall the drinkability is pretty good. I wish this was more readily available (I got one of the last bottles at the liquor store). Over a lovely beer."
"Overall, this is a cream stout with lots of guts. The bitterness of a stout is still there, only a notch above the sweet aspect of the creaminess. Great balance, and a classic in my book. I only wish they hadn't changed their bottle to a more classic round shape. I say go back to the old oval flask looking bottle!"
"Overall, this is a pretty drinkable stout. Nothing is super overpowering, making it balanced and tasty. Not my favorite stout, but I would try another one..."
"Pours a dark black color with a small fizzy tan head. The beatifully complex and very roasty aroma shows off it's dark roasted malts, chocolate and coffee. The taste starts out a bit malty but soon opens up to some roastiness and a nice bitter finish that lasts until the next sip. Overall, this is a really solid stout that I thoroughly enjoyed. Recommended."
"- Bottle pour, cellar temperature, into a pint glass -"
"M&D - smooth, as a cream stout should be, with a nice alcohol bite, and background hop profile to lend a very nice balance to it easy down and tasty, a great brew, though may be too sweet for some"
"Poured into a nonic glass. Pours a dark reddish brown with a nice two fingered head. Aroma of the Fuggles(?) and roasted malts. Tastes like expresso,malt, chocolate and fruit. The mouthfeel is average for a stout. Long aftertaste and slightly bitter with a sweet end."
"Really drinkable. Good."
"I was quite surprised. After trying the Golden Ale, which I thought was average at best, I was expecting a mediocre stout. Not the case. This was excellent. Will definitely buy again."
"Mouth: Sweet again, milk chocolate flavors mingle with roasted grains. Chard crust, evaporated milk sweetness. Somewhat too lactic to have a high drinkability rating. A lingering bitter aftertaste tainted by acidic sour milk that I don't particularly like. Hops are almost unperceivable as they're covered by the roasted malt flavors. Mouthfeel is a bit too carbonated for a stout, IMO, and not chewy enough."
"Drinkability: This is a pretty good beer, a bit unusal for the style and not as sessionable because of the more assertive flavors and ABV, but still easy to drink."
"This beer comes in one of the coolest flask style bottles. This stout is dark black (surprise!) with a nice thick tan head that died very quickly. The smell is roasty and very, very enticing. The taste is nice and roasty with a little chocolate but the flavor is very weak overall. The taste does not live up to the smell. It almost teases your tongue and then runs away. The mouthfeel is very smooth and silky. As it warms up the beer really starts to surprise me with a nice flavor. The drinkability is pretty high as this one doesnt seem to high in alcohol. This is a good beer but I am so spoiled by American stouts that it doesnt quite measure up."
"D: Actually, this was a little sweet for my tastes, the other elements made it a decent contender, but seemed like others that I had here in the states, therefore only average. I think of the four, IPA is the winner."
"D: Bizarrely, this is just as easy for me to find as the Sam Adams Cream Stout (and since it's a 16.9 ounce bottle, this is actually cheaper than SA for me). So this is my go-to cream stout. I keep these in a cabinet and drink them at room temperature. Divine."
"all in all i highly recommend this to stout lovers."
"Nice mouthfeel and good drinkability. Tastes lower than 6.5% abv."
"I am going to have to go against the grain here and not recommend this beer. The appearance is very used motor oily with zero head and still less lacing. Smell is worse, a hint of coffee and cocoa malt and then a sour cream smell. (not actual sour cream but cream that went sour). Taste is very similar to the smell, but the with a bit less of the unsugared cocoa taste. Mouthfeel is fine for the style. Drinkability is not there."
"This is a St. Peters offerings sold for $3.85 at my local Northcoast Coop here in Eureka, CA. It poured a nice dark red (almost black) that left a big juicy light tan head that settled quickly and left chucks of lacing on the side of the glass. Attractive pour. Nose of burnt malts. Very rich creamy mouthfeel. Flavors of dark malts, coffee, chocolate, and fruit. Finish was nicely bitter. Excellent brew, and a worthy stout."
"1 pint, .9oz brown bottle from A-1 to-go. Black, almost completely opaque body with only feignt ruby-red high-lights around the edges - one of the darkest beers I've had. A really thin film of light tan head. Smells malty and roasty with a hint of banana or licorice? Tastes mostly like burnt malt, with a fair bit of sweetness, presumably from the cream. Mouthfeel is a bit lighter than expected, a bit aqueous, which helps the drinkability. But the burnt astringency kind of hurts it... Still this is quite a nice little stout. I could see myself getting this sometimes."
"Drinkability is quite high. A great flavor that seems simple at first, possibly due to the thin low-carbonation. But quite complex from beginning to end. Good stuff, and yet anotehr St. Peter's beer that seems immune from clear and green bottles!"
"Dark and sweet, taste hints of bitter chocolate, stronger coffee and lots of malt. Thick, smooth and pretty creamy. Would make a good dessert beer, with chocolate of some sort. Sip it slowly, the flavor increases as it reaches room temp."
"D: A fine beer to have with a stack of pancakes or waffles. Not a session type brew as the abv is slightly high. Good bottle for use for a homebrew!"
"pours an opaque black with a thin dark tan head that disappears quickly. the smell is wonderfully rich with hints of coffee against a deep milk chocolate back. the taste has roasted and sweet elements in the background, but the foreground is a very sour taste that lingeres in the mouth. there's a good deal of sweetness to balance it, but still. it's a study in contrast. the sourness detracts from the mouthfeel, but makes the beer interesting enough for me to drink again."
"could almost slam this but you really shouldn't."
"This is a classic cream stout. Tasty, milky, creamy, but also that touch of interfering rawness. Just a bit too much raw alcohol comes through for style. Still in all a delicious cream stout."
"Presentation: Packaged in a custom light-green glass flask in the style of the late eighteenth century, sealed with a pop-off crown. Served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Nice, drinkable stout. The sourness was a nice change of pace, and really kept my interest from start to finish."
"D- Yup i did serve it too cold, but allowed it to warm. but i couldnt get passed the peaty taste. Hated it. Not for me thanks"
"A superb beer, I'm generally not a fan of milk stouts but this is fantastic"
"Overall, a very nice beer. One i could enjoy very often when looking for a nice full flavored porter or stout."
"A superb Cream Stout! Great bottle too. These St. Peter's brews are quite dandy and I'm gonna have to seek these out from time to time, and more often. Especially this stout. Damn fine stuff!"
"Very dark with clear ruby highlights. Not much head off a hard pour, mostly large, tan bubbles that don't stick around long, but fine bubbles form a thin layer. There's a bit of spotty lacing. Roasty aroma with sweet caramel and milk chocolate notes, plus a subtle smokiness. Mild bitterness from hops, but there is some from the dark grain as well. Roasted malts dominate, giving it some chocolate and burnt character. I think there's a bit of smoke in the finish too, which is definitely a little acidic with a mild nuttiness. Medium bodied with creamy carbonation and a silky texture. Dryness from the roasted barley. Not bad at all. Thanks for picking this up grub!"
"Drinkability is good, this is a nice light stout that stands out in a sea of aggressive beers--one can find heavier porters. I'd wish for the licorice to be a bit more subdued. Finish it before it warms to room temp for best flavor. Recommended."
"Overall a hearty recommendation as a stouter cream stout."
"Very drinkable, and very tasty."
"I really dig the bottles of the St. Peter's line of beers I think this the sixth beer I have had from them,this poured a near pitch black with a few highlights of ruby when held up to the light with a substantial beige head atop that left a broken lace around the Guinness glass.Mmm the aromas are great and complex notes of dark fruit,highly roasted malt,bitter chocolate and even some nuttiness when served at the right temp this brew gives off alot.First off a deep bitter chocolate and brown sugar character hits with a charred dark fruit flavor melding into a pretty dry almost woody finish that lingers for a bit,it really dries out alot in the finish.Not really a creamy mouthfeel wich I was hoping for and it was a bit sharp at first,in saying that it is the only qualm I have with this stout and its not much of one.I liked it alot it would be a good chocolate dessert beer because the roastiness would cut thru the chocolate and it has a little chocolate character in itself,I recommend it for sure."

"D - Pretty good, but it does leave something desired. I imagine there are a lot of cheeses which would provide a simply amazing pairing with this stout. It is a pretty quaffable brew. Of the St Peter's brews which I have tried recently, this is my favorite. I don't particularly care for my stouts to have a charred flavor to them, which seems pretty common to this line up."
"Though St. Peter's Cream Stout is quite dark when poured, it's not nearly as flavorful as one might expect. It's nearly jet black as expected, though with very minimal brown head. The nose is also quite subdued, primarily coffee and roasted malt, though barely detectable. The flavor isn't as creamy as many other cream stouts either. It's a rather mildly flavored stout with the bitter roasted malt flavor smoothed over by the cream. Something of a mix between a traditional stout and what one might think of as a traditional cream stout. Not the best example of the style, but at least pleasant enough. Minimal carbonation and somewhat thin mouthfeel were a bit of a let down too. All in all, it's not bad by any means, just kinda weak."
"If it wasnt so tough to find, this would be a regular in my fridge."
"A very tasty beer that I plan to do a homebrew knockoff of very soon."
"Yum, yup that sums it up. This is a pretty good cream stout. It is the right color and has an ok head for a cream sout anyway. it has a nice roasted, chocolate laced, almost roasted chocolate if there is such a thing. In fact maybe a bit smokey, which translates into the flavor well... The smokey kick is almost like that of a rauchbier. Hmmmm, smoke and bitter dark chocolate, I can get used to that. The body is a bit thin, but other than that it is a pretty good tasting brew that will be in my fridge when I am looking for a decent cream stout."
"D - very tasty! very creamy! very I'd like another!"
"Overall, this is a good ale; I wouldn't turn one down. That said, with all the much better stouts out there, I don't think I will be picking this one up again either. I far prefer the offerings from North Coast, Stone, Brooklyn, or Weyerbacher to St. Peters."
"Full-bodied and (dark) chocolatey, but the main thing I notice is the way my teeth tingle a bit after each mouthful, as if I've just eaten a very rich piece of cake. Apropos for a 'sweet' stout, wouldn't you say? St. Peter's Brewery has its newest disciple."
"DA: This is a really good example of a milk Stout, I dig the style and it's pretty easy to drink at 6 %."
"In my opinion, among the very best in character, flavor, and drinkability."
"D: Almost done with the glass as I typed. I will buy this again and again. Nice job by the people at St. Peters for making this brew. Other than the nasty look of the head this is a top notch beer."
"Poured a deep dark brown with no head at all. Smell of espresso, chocolate and molasses. Didn't taste the higher alcohol at all and the sweetness came through very well. Had the feeling that this one was slightly past the expiration date and would love to try a fresher one but overall enjoyed it."
"St. Peter's Cream Stout, especially given my experience with a handful of this brewery's other offerings, came out of left field. Sorry, too American. It was a right googly, it was. Not only is it the best English stout that I've ever had, it just might be the best English beer period."
"Overall, this isn't quite what I expect from a cream stout. It's good, and there's definitely a good amount of sweetness, but the harsh bitterness is out of place here."
"Overall good brew, with complexity. Definitely worth trying."
"Overall: A good, solid stout. Recommended."
"Dark shit brown, with a fizzy off white head that dissapears quickly. A light coffee and chocolate nose, has some toastyness to it. There's even some faint berry fruit to it as well. The taste is interesting, charred smoke, charcoal, burnt wood, burnt coffee, bunrt chocolate, but all a little wishy washy, like there was no body behind it. A better explanation would be that i's jsut has some huge and bitter tastes, but finishes to dry and so quick that you wonder where everything went. Fairly clean and bubbly mouthfeel, a unique example of the style."
"500 ml green bottle. Black in color, with a surprisingly small head. It had a coffee, dark chocolate aroma. It tasted about the same as it smelled, but could also detect some sweet dark fruit. I thought it was a little thin in my mouth, but still found it to be a very pleasant beer."
"Light, yet oily mouth-feel goes down oh-so-smooth and alcohol is not detected. Except for the distracting soy-sauce flavor, this would be a top- notch stout. I dont remember this character the first time I tasted it, so will have to try it again to see if it's consistent."
"D: I was really pleased with this particular stout. I am a big stout fan and I really thought this one was good. It would be good with sweets after dinner."
"Pours black with a very slight creamy film and lacing. Smells of rounded and deeply toasted coffee and chocolate malts. Taste largely follows the aroma; sweet toasted chocolate and coffee malts interact from beginning to end. The finish is sweet with dark raisins and plums, toasted bread, and a touch of alcohol spice. Medium-to-rich oily body little carbonation and a bit of cream."
"D: Much too sugary and sweet for my tastes. Seems unbalanced and cloying. I like sweet stouts but this is a bit over the top."
"Cheers!"
"Pours to a coal black, with a dark tan head that diminishes fairly quickly, decent acing. Srong malty aroma of chocolate and caramel, with a hint of nuts. Taste was mostly chocolate, and a little watery at first, but alcohol crept in as it warnmed. A nice smooth finish made this a very enjoyable beer."
"When poured it was a dark black and could not see through when held to the light. It had a small creamy head of about 1 inch despite the aggressive pour. The head left a little lace and there were no visible bubbles. The aroma was of toasted grains with a slight hint of dark chocolate and coffee. It tasted just as it smelled a touch of bitter but an almost sweet finish of chocolate and coffee. The feel in the mouth was outstanding and was that of milk or cream. All in all it was a very good choice. I would definitely drink this again and again. I don't drink a lot of cream stouts but this is by far the best I have had to date."
"Black in colour with lower than average carbonation. Aromas of Vienna roast coffee, milk chocolate, and spicy hops. Strong caramel aspects come out in the mouth, along with darker chocolate and more coffee. Heavy bodied, with a long sweet finish. A nice after dinner pint, especially for someone with a sweet tooth."
"Drinkability- Simply tastey. A great dessert beer that would go especially well with vanilla ice-cream."
"A nice drinkable cream ale and a goode session beer. I would definitely do this one again."
"Drinkability: Goes down easily, especially for such a dark and thick beer."
"This is a great beer but due to the high malt content may not be a great session beer but goes well with a hearty meal (huge pieces of steak might be recommended)."
"Regardless, this a full bodied drinkable stout. The flavour and scent are more akin to their honey porter, which is not unpleasant. Off the mark for the style, but very good regardless."
"A damned fine beer. Paired with a bit of Dubliner cheese & some rustic bread, it makes for an excellent ploughman's lunch..."
"The body is not as heavy as I was expecting, the mouthfeel not as creamy as it was bitter, none the less, it's a pretty unique stout that's worth a try."
"Every once in awhile, you have to splurg and bust out a bottle of this stuff! Nice malty creamy head. Good retention. Pours a dark color with the creamy head. Lots of malts with some hoppy goodness in the back. Smells of sweet caramel and toffee. Very drinkable also. Only drawback is it is medium bodied, unlike a lot of other stouts. That being said, I still love this one!"
"Not the best example of the style but also probably not the best example of this brew either. I suspect improper storage, but it is a stout. It could just be a flat brew. MK"
"Pours a nice ink black with a small head. A very nice color on this brew. The smell has a real deep creamy chocolate aroma with some cinnamon. The taste has coffee along with chocolate, cinnamon. The m/f is heavy with a wonderful creamy feel that brings all the flavors together. A very good beer, but it's heavy and I don't think I could have more than 2."
"D - fantastic. I was weary of paying as much money as I did for one pint but it was worth it to find this gem. Like the porter if you can find it do not pass it up. It is a stout everyone should enjoy."
"Pours a very deep mahogany with a very thin tan cap. Almost no cap at all, and left no lacings. Very suprising for this kind of beer. However, the smell was very nice with lots of dark chocolate, vanilla, and a little citrus hops in the nose. Very sweet aroma. Taste is chocolate, very heavy coffee flavor, and fusal bitterness. Not overly complex, but has the main characteristics. Carbonation is mild with medium body. Overal a decent beer, but not on the top of my list for this style"
"this is a tough one. i mean, its not at all a bad beer. really. ok, the pour sucks as far as im concerned. theres no head. i had heard about this headlessness and so wheni poured i made a point to really let it smack the bottom of the glass yknow. but nothing. oh well. the smell IS there but its...well, mediocre. the mouthfeel is a little rough around the edges i would say. the taste, tho, i think is rather nice. very clean on the palate. no strong aftertastes (can be a good or a bad thing), nothing overwhelming at all really. just, there. and not unpleasant. you can see im TRYING to like this beer, what with its gourgeous bottling and all, but im having a hard time i guess. the problem here i would say, is not with the beer itself, its just there is SO much highclass competition around, the lack of head etc really hurts her."
"I'm surprised to find that this brewery is only 10 years old... the brews I've had from them thus far speak of old, cherished tradition."
"D = Very drinkable. But a I think I can only tolerate one or two a day."
"M&D: extremely creamy smooth and surprisingly light on the mouthfeel, almost like coffee-flavoured milk; this full-bodied ale really is one of the smoothest stout I've ever had, even smoother than genuine milk-luctose stouts~~ I'd prefer it to have more hop entrance to balance the almighty malty theme, but the beer as it is already is extremely tasty without going down heavy. St Peter's could as well make some efforts to bottle-condition this beer in a smaller package--which I'm sure will be equally, if not more, successful and appealing."
"Drinkability - a belly-filler, but very tasty and easy drinking."
"Darkest brown with a cocoa foam head that falls to a tiny ring. Smell is tobacco, coffee grounds, and some chocolate. The tobacco flavors come to the fore in the taste, especially at the edges. Coffee brings up the rear with a smattering of dark chocolate in the middle. More complex than I anticipated. Mouthfeel was a bit thin, but not bad by any means. Very tasty and very drinkable. $3.59 for a 500ml bottle."
"Drinkability: really hurt by the mouthfeel the lack of carbs makes it lose pionts tastes good and smells great"
"went into this not expecting much, for what ever reason, and i was pleasantly surprised. more than worth a try if you see this around."
"Poured opaque black , with a very thin head of large bubbles that dissapears and lots of tiny bubbles clinging to the inside/top of the pint glass. Aroma is a milky and soil like blend of coffee, dairy , diacetyl , and some dark cocoa. Taste is creamy/buttery , slight coffee bean , some chocolate , some earthy bite and a bit of herbal/bittering hop balance from the fuggles and challengers. Mouthfeel is smooth ,very little carbonation with a bittersweet and slightly dry finish. A pleasant and aromatic stout , quite drinkable."
"Very stong with the roasted grain to be a Cream Stout, even an English Cream Stout at that. The color is an opaque dark brown with bright ruby around the edges. Aromas release strong malt, roasted grain, and licorice. Tastes boldly malty and roasted with burned toast flavors and actual hop flavors to accompany bittering. Licorice and cocoa flavors hold firm into the finish. Texture is slight of heavy and clean if not for a strong burned grain bite. Fermentation with milk sugars and grain adds a complex sour, fruity note in the finish. A bit charcoal or chalky in the finish. Still a good Stout that will stand up to American counterparts."
"Drinkability: Well, it know it raised the ire of some BAs, but I have to factor in price here. Sure, it's a fairly solid traditional UK sweet stout, and granted the bottle is pretty cool, but four bucks for a pint is a bit steep. I'd be happy with a standard bottle and a $1.99 price tag. Otherwise, a bit dead in the mouth, but tasty."
"I would like to try this on cask if it exists. A very pleasant cream stout which could easily be drunk in multiples - I wish I had another one now. It becomes increasingly drinkable the further into it I go. I would never refrigerate this."
"overall, not a bad beer but not impressive either, much better stouts out there."
"A superb stout. I don't know if I've ever had a stout that managed to be both sweet and bitter and pull it off as well as this does. Good Stuff."
"Anyway, just thought I'd share."
"500 ml bottle. St. Peters Cream Stout pours out just about black, with a small head. Bittersweet chocolate aroma with a little caramel. Chocolatey flavor with hints of licorice. Some coffee flavor, but this beer is only slightly bitter. The finish is fruity and a little sweet. It makes me think of strawberry jam. There is some hop flavor in the finish too. The mouthfeel is not as creamy as it might have been. Still, this is a pretty good milk stout."
"I could nurse one of these for a while happily, although it's a little overbearing for multiple helpings. Not tremendously subtle, but very nice if you're looking for something desserty or for a special occasion."
" Overall, this is hearty, tasty stout with some complex and different notes and an encouraging entry from St Peter's."
"Burnt color with crimson along the sides. Small compact cappucino head. Decent lacing. Aroma of burnt hot chocolate and vinous dark hop fruits. Taste is more creamy than aroma suggests. Begins roasted with black patent malts or something similar but soons smooths out to a sweet lactic milky taste which compliment each other nicely. A bittersweet chocolate finish rounds out this offering. Carbonation is a bit low and dampens the creaminess and maybe doesn't give this beer the smoothness it needs with the flavor qualities. Yet, it was still quite drinkable and enjoyable. Definitely worth a try."
"Several different flavors that are clearly distinguishable but in perfect concert with each other. A well crafted and satisfying brew."
"This beer comes in a 16.9 ounce green bottle (yes, the bottle is cool, but I would prefer brown, even if it's less critical with a dark beer like this). It pours a jet black color, and even with a real turbulent pour the head is but a half an inch. Aroma is choclately, taste is dominated at first by chocolate and then some licorice and has coffee notes in the finish. This has quickly become one of my favorite stouts and I pick up a bottle every time I get to the shop that stocks it (I've noticed a shop closer by has just started stocking this, looks like I'll be enjoying this more often). Stouts are among my favorite styles, and this is one of the most enjoyable ones that I've had lately. Highly recommended, worth seeking out."
"A very refreshing and filling stout."
"A great stout for anyone. Mmmm, very tasty and so...creamy...sweet..."
"In spite of some inconsistent charms across the board, this is still a beer worth trying and enjoying. Very tasty."
"Overall, I'd like this beer a bit more without the drying aspects to the aftertaste. It's still a good beer, and those not into Milk Stouts will probably like this better than Mackeson or Sam Adams, but I'll stick to the more conventional ones for myself. I'll buy it again, though."
"The mouthfeel is nice and robust, and the drinkability remains rather high. Regardless, this one's sort of boring; big marks for subtle creaminess and unanticipated bitterness, but I remain unimpressed. Final narrative says: go with Mackeson the triple threat, but this one's worth a try."
""
"I'd like to get around to trying out more authentic British stouts, and this is certainly a goood start. It's definitely worth a try, even if you just want the bottle. :)"
"More ""Stout"" than Guinness. Not for everybody, but if you are into stouts, give this one a try. Light beer lovers should not even think about it. Comes in a greenish brown flask shaped bottle."
"It poured black with a tan head. The aroma was of sweet and toasted malt and a bit of coffee. The taste was of toasted malt with a nice sweet rounding to it. The feel was heavy and creamy, yet dry. This is a good solid stout that's a bit out of the mainstream. Definately a beer I will have to sample again."
"Pours a solid dark brown to black color with light coming through only at the edges. A very small head dissapears into a very sparse coating over top. Nose is nice, with good chocolate notes and a slight lactic creamyness. I'm liking it. Flavor is also pretty nice. Again, nice chocolate and light coffee to start, moving to a more coffee like finish with a moderate blast of lactic bite and a modest bitter finish. The lactic charater really comes through on the aftertaste. Feel is moderate, with a light carbonation. The beer feels almost velvety smooth. Drinkability is very nice as well. Nothing at all bad about this one. Maybe a little astringent on the finish, but it works with the beer. I'd have it again."
"Taste was very smooth with a hint of chocolate and a heavy amount of coffee like dark malts. Some sourness not as much as I would expect. It did have a rather bitter finish. Wasnt as sweet a bit harsh on the roasted malt flavor for me."
"A nice beer. I really like the creaminess of the mouthfeel and the great chocolate and coffee flavors. A nice surprise as I picked this up on a whim."
"The smell is mostly of dark malts and has just a hint of chocolate. Roasted flavors and a bit of cream come out in the taste, with hops waiting until the very end to make their presence known. The mouthfeel is full while this stays easy to drink."
"Yes. This is a mighty cream stout here. Pours out to a deep black color, with a small brown head. Right below the surface of the beer, shortly after pouring, it looks like a storm is brewing... Nice. Aroma is very strong, with a obvious note of grape bubblegum, with coffee amd dark malts in the background. Flavor is very quaffable; chocolate and coffee dominate, with some malt afterthoughts and mild hints of herbs. Mouthfeel is near perfect. Smooth, creamy, utterly enjoyable; just the way every milk stout should be. Drinkability is pretty good. Not an everyday beer for me, but one I would like to revisit. Recommended."
"Taste; slightly burned coffee, and the earthiness I noted in the smell comes out in the finish along with a little sweet chocolate. Mouthfeel was nicely thick and creamy, with very little carbonation."
"Overall - An exceptional stout, one of my favourites. Highly recommended !!"
"In conclusion, Tug has good taste, and I really didn't mind the $6 after drinking this one. This is a bit expensive (seen it for $3.00 a single) and very filling, but remains a superb stout. Not really something you'd drink regularly, but bi-weekly? Yes please! Try if you can."
"St. Peter's Cream Stout is a delicious offering from St. Peter's Brewery and I am glad to have had the opportunity to review this fine brew."
"Pours dark brown to black with a small head that fades quickly with little lacing. Smell is very present mostly malty with a slight burnt tint at the end of the boquet. The taste is full sweet up front burnt in the middle with hints of alchohol at the finish, slight hop presence balances the alchohol and malt nicely, low on carbonation but not really flat, a different feel, very creamy. A nice drinker. A good beer to have a pint of when reading or sitting by the fireplace. Not an everyday beer, but maybe an every month beer."
"D - not a session beer. good for a cold autumn night, world series baseball and reading about homebrewing! alright i was going to be ranting and raving about this beer to my friends, but about 3/4 of the way through this suddenly i began to loose interest in it. the alcohol isn't very prevelent throughout most of this, but once you hit the last bit of the glass it seems to pick up in a very strong beer and it totally changes the feeling of what was going to be a 100% excellent brew. to bad, i would have had these things all the time, but the end just isn't satisfactory."
"Pours black ruby in color with a bubbly tan head that fades into a thin lace. Alcohol is apparent in the nose with aromas of rum-soaked raisins and some pipe tobacco in the background. Taste begins with bittersweet dark chocolate and coffee followed by smoky wood and charcoal. Moderate in body and slightly oily in texture. A pretty nice brew in an unusual bottle."
"Great beer overall, as are most of St. Peter's offerings. For the $3.79 I paid for a pint (in the odd shaped bottle), it's a great deal, and hard to pass up. If you see it, give it a chance, it's well worth it."
"Pours black with a very small tan head. The aroma is sweet chocolate. The taste begins chocolatey sweet. As it sits, the roasted malt background of a dry stout begins to meld nicely with the sweet beginning. In the swallow and aftertaste, the roasted malt takes center stage and the burnt aspect imparts a nice bitterness that's a welcome change from the sweet beginning. The mouthfeel is creamy (as a cream sout should be) and it is extremely drinkable. A very nice session brew, though it is probably too expensive to make a session of it (and maybe to high in ABV)."
"St. Peter's Cream Stout looks a little scary. Because of the odd bottle design, the beer glugs awkwardly into the glass, pitch black and headless. As it settles, a small, tan head forms and then quickly dissipates, leaving you with a glassful of motor oil. It gets a 4.0 not for being good, but for being intimidating. Here goes. Smells lactose-sweet and roasted/burnt, pretty much exactly like Sam Adam's version of a cream stout. Taste has some upfront sweetness and some coffee--very acrid, burnt coffee--but also an alarming amount of phenol. More like St. Peter's Band-Aid Stout. Mouthfeel is satisfyingly thick, but that burnt coffee-and-band-aids flavor won't go away as long as you're savoring the feel, so who cares?"
"All of these combined to make a great beer even after the not so promising pour."
"One cm of light-brown, bubbly head leaves crazy spots and swoops of lacing. The beer is black with red/brown highlights. Aroma is rich chocolate toffee. Very rich. Almost smoky. Awesome. In the front, there is more rich chocolate toffee, followed by a tangy, fruity, buttery, oily, flattish middle (which is not to say I don't love it). Finish is bitter chocolate with melted popcorn butter. Again, this is really ""old"" tasting. But right up my alley: thick, buttery, chocolate toffee. Very comforting. Just a joy to drink for me."
"St Peter's Cream Stout is a fine beer & all, but the main problem with it is that for $3+ a bottle, it is not a very good deal. This beer doesn't have anything going for it that say, Samuel Adams' Cream Stout doesn't have. Basically, you can find the same caliber cream stout, possibly superior, for a good bit less, and more plentiful (6 pack of something else opposed to St Peter's singles)."
"Mouthfeel is heavier than a typcial stout, decent, nothing to write home about. The alcohol profile hurts the mouthfeel. Overall a good cream stout (I like cream stouts), but probably not my favorite for best of breed."
"pours an impenetrable black with almost no head. there is a light carbonation. smell malt coffee chocolate. i have discovered that i am a sucker for a chocolatey stout. i never want a second though thus the low drinkability score. this is a great finish to a day. heavy rich mouth feel."
"Unique green bottle, looks almost like you picked up a bottle of cough medicine instead of a beer. Pours the usual dark opaque colour of stout with a thin head. Light aroma of coffee and roasted malts. Creamy mouthfeel but feels a little thin. Not a bad beer, but I probably won't pick up another bottle of it now that I've tried."
"Overall this is another good offering from St. Peter's."
"Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated, leaving it not so heavy. Very well-rounded for a stout, much unlike a dry Irish traditional. I wouldn't place it in the milk/sweet stout, though."
"Notes: This is a tasty brew that could benefit from a little more aggressive mouthfeel. I'm not complaining though. I wouldn't turn one of these down anytime. Worth a try."
"This beer gets the 4 in drinkability because of the mouthfeel, I think it really makes the beer for me."
"Beautiful bottle. It pours dark, dark brown with dark red highlights. The carmel-colored head is thin and short-lived. The smell is very sweet--chocolate, butter, vanilla, and raspberries. The taste is much hoppier than expected, and it is indeed very sweet and creamy. VERY rich! Very tingly and spicy in the mouth. This beer is a true delight!"
"This beer is black as night, pouring a 4 finger head that is leaving quite a lacing behind. Nose is very much like most British beers I have sampled, not much there. Taste is an interesting blend of chocolate, coffee, and most noticeably molasses. Mouthfeel is wonderful, creamy as advertised. Overall drinkability is good. I definitely would not refuse one of these!"
"Nice oversized medicinal looking bottle. Pours dark dark dark brown with a dark tan head, a bit thin but stuck well enough. And I mean dark! The nose was like raw cookies with dark chocolate and almonds, just strong enough but no stronger. The taste was about the same with some added light tartness on the finish and a bit of citrus/lemony taste that followed your tongue around but not invasive. Carbonation was almost fantastic with a bit more it'd have been a 4.5/5. Very drinkable, definite revisit for me, hopfully found on tap during one of my trips."
"Deep black in color. No head but seems to be a decnet level of carbonation. Roasted malt seems to dominate the aroma. Theres a nice touch of sweetness to it-almost a slightly ""burnt"" treacle like aroma.. Malty flavor. Notes of molasses and coffee. Has a sweetness in the flavor that quickly mellows to a nice, slightly roasted flavor. Good body. Overall a very enjoyable brew. Dont think I have have had a beer from this brewery I wouldnt try again."
"Very nice balance, perfectly blended."
"Actually, one of the better stouts I've ever tasted. I would come back to this again and again."
"Lovely beer, really. Must be tried."
"Overall I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and finesse of this cream stout. Though not as sweet as other english cream stout's I've tried, it's still 'in-the-pocket' when it comes to respectfully interpreting the style. A fantastic multi-dimensional (I'll say it again) subtle stout with great (I'll say it again) finesse. The higher than avg. ABV is virtually undectectable."
"16.9 ounce interestingly shaped and colored bottle. Pours burnt dark raisin black/brown, very minimal head, indicated very low carbonation and very slight lacing observed. This is a flavorful sweet stout, lots of soggy burnt raisins, dark malts, coffee, burnt grains and vanilla flavor to go around. Nice cold weather sipper. Stout lovers, give it a try. Newbies would probably be turned off by this deeply flavorful and mysterious stout"
"Clear black with chestnut highlights and a creamy brownish head of about a minute's staying power. Dripping fat rings for laces. Malty aroma, milk chocolate and a slight bit of asphalt. Mouthfeel is very nice, about medium but with a coating creamy aspect. Starts with a touch of caramel and light chocolate, the hops are well spread out in this Stout and make up fully for a less roasty character. Finishes with a floral twist and bits of licorice. For me, not as good as the very distinct Porter, but bolder than a lot of the sweeter and less complex Sweet Stouts."
"Slàinte!"
"The appearance is just what you would expect from a well-respected cream stout... a little thick on the pour, extremely dark, and the small head is tinted brown. Even when the glass is held up to the light, nothing breaks through. Smell is of a traditional stout like Guinness or Murphy's. The taste is totally original: almost tastes like coffee, and has the same thick consistency as a warm cup. It has a sweeter taste than most stouts you will taste, hence the ""milk"" or ""cream"" in the title. I myself am not a huge fan of stouts, but would definitely recommend this to anyone who is."
"As we say in Gloucester the third week of every June...""Viva San Pedro!!"""
"Notes: The bottle and labels of the beer are great. you could buy this beer just based on the bottle and labels and would not be disapointed. Very good beer."
"Drinkability: A nice, full-flavored brew though not my favorite example of the style"
"Taste: The creamy milk chocolate and the cocoa that were so prominent in the aroma took a back seat in the taste. Dark chocolate and deeply roasted bitter coffee jumped to the forefront and dominated the flavor along with heavily roasted malt. There was still enough lactose sweetness underneath to remind me that this was a cream stout. A little bit of tart, dark fruit danced along the edges of the tongue."
"St. Peters Cream Stout is not especially sweet and doesnt lean too heavily on lactose. Instead a mellow roastiness defines the flavor. Its a nice beer though not representative of the cream stout style."
"I loved the flavor of the perfectly blended Fuggles and Challenger hops with a blend of 4 barley malts. Flavor and aroma seem to merge as I taste this dark cream stout. When I swallow this medium full mouth feel necter, it provides one of its best features- a bittersweet aftertaste. Some reviewers have described as woody, smokey, and/or roasted. However described - its awesome. Seems to finish so dry it should not be called a sweet stout. My 500 ml. ""flask"" bottle definately contained the right stuff! That is why it was a back to back gold medal winner in the I.B.C ('03 -'04)."
"Drinkability is above average. Solid base of malt but hops don't quite complete the picture."
"This poured just as dark as it should for the style. Looks like a glass of ink. Thin off-white haze in lieu of a head of any sort. Decent lacing. The smell is almost sweet. Plenty of burnt or roasted scents in here. Toffee, chocolate, and coffee. Smells just wonderful. The taste? Just as good as it smells. A bit of a bitter finish, but then a caramalised taste tries to work its way through. Delicious. Everything up until this point has been just smashing, until however, we reach the mouthfeel. This is much too thin for the style. I'm a little disappointed here. Overall, however, it's great stuff."
"Drinkability- I couldn't finish this one, nor could my fiancee. Just too dark for my liking. Dark stout/porter/raushbier fans would probably enjoy this one."
"I really enjoyed this brew. It was cool that I found it in SC, where the beer law only prohibits alcohol content to reach 6%. So, in that aspect, this was a true gem. Aside from that, it was a kick ass beer. I loved the coffeish/creamish taste to it. It actually tasted just like the coffee I like to drink every morn. The smell was coffeeish and chocolately, but also had a little tiny hint of alcohol in it. The alcohol was hardly noticeable in the taste. All in all a great beer. Definately something to try if you get the chance."
"A worthwhile beer to try, uniquely enigmatic: it's thin but full flavored, awful appearance with high carbonation and a decent smell."
"a good solid stout, recommended to try."
"This is an all-day beer. A great brew."
"This is a very good beer. Milk stout is not my favourite stout-brew however."
"Near-complete blackness cut only by a hint of crimson at the edges. Topped off with a couple fingers worth of tight, dark tan head that quickly collapses into persistent foam that laces nicely. Smell is both dry and soft with notes of bittersweet chocolate and lightly toasted malt. Creamy softness at the start fades nicely into a persistently crisp and slightly bitter finish that shows nice balance. This stout lacks some fullness. Mouthfeel is ""wetter"" than expected for such a creamy taste. Nonetheless, this is an eminently drinkable stout."
"Pours to a dark ruby black color and thin beige head. Aroma is chocolatey sweet. Flavor is a nice blend of roasty, malty goodness and sweetness. Finishes chocolatey and bittersweet. I like this stout. Not as an everyday beer, but as a nice treat now and then. Interesting bottle shape, by the way."
"Overall this does more of the 'stout' and less of the 'cream', but I prefer that to the opposite which I've also ran into. If you like stouts at all it's worth a try."
"Drinkability  This one is not a stand out but drinkable nevertheless. It has some sharp flavors but lacks the ultra-creamy mouthfeel that one looks for in the style."
"Glad to know the Limeys are still brewing and exporting tasty stouts ; ) ."
"Flavor begins with creamy, chocolate malts, followed by a walnut flavored, hops bitterness. Roasty flavors abound here, with coffee notes emerging in the middle, and lasting until the finish. The finish and aftertaste are mildly bitter, taking over from the initially sweet chocolate character. My only complaint with this nice stout is that it starts to feel watered down toward the finish, with detracts from drinkability a bit. Overall, a very finely crafted, English stout, with a pleasant hops presence that balances the dark, roasty, malts very well."
"This is a good brew. In some ways, it reminds me of a Synebrychoff Porter with it's woodiness and smoke, but without the dark fruit overtones. I really dig the woody, smoky, roasted aftertaste. Nice stuff...do try it!"
"I really like this beer. Pours a deep chocolate brown, opaque, thin tan head that retreats quickly with solid lace. Malt and more malt in the nose with traces of coffee. Malt and lactose in the taste with a short dry coffee finish ..Nicely balanced. Superb!"
"Pours out of the rather cool flask-type bottle with a rush of large soapy bubbles that calm down to form a fine creamy tan head. Nearly opaque brown liquid. Salty nose with a deep roast malt kick. Bitter roasted malt flavor tasted first then some light coffee, both balanced by a hefty hop addition. Finishes with a wash of liquorice but otherwise roasty and drying, what with the strong hoppiness."
"Fairly drinkable, a nice stout far better than Guinness, but there are better versions."
"Thicker than the St. Peter's Old Style Porter, the Cream Stout really earns that title. This is very much the chocolate shake of beers. The beer is not as bitter as it could have been with such strong coffee and chocolate flavors, but I think that is a good thing. The bitterness is subdued, so it doesn't overpower the other aspects of the chocolate taste. My favorite St. Peter's brew so far."
"This beer pours with some viscosity. A thin and bubbly brown head is formed on this body of dark ruby beer. Aroma is milky, chocolatey and roasty. Nice. The mouthfeel is creamy to a point. Fairly low on CO2. Body's about medium-full. There's a nice lactic sweetness to the flavor, but also some great bittersweet chocolate and roasted bitterness. Java tones accent and even some rustic, earthy hop notes. Pretty good blend of flavors to this stout. I like it."
"Dark jet black in color, has a small creamy brown head, not much lacing. Roasted caramel, chocolate and coffee aromas, sweet and smokey plum-chocolate flavor. Medium-body, mild carbonation with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel, a pretty good easy drinking stout."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" light brown head above the dark brown/black brew. Head showed some resiliency, and lacing was nice. Aroma of dark malts, with sweetness seeming to win out over bitterness, at least in the nose arena. We'll see how it goes in the mouth. Taste is roasty, toasty malts, and a total lack of bitterness. Excellent. Mouthfeel and drinkability are excellent as well. Recommend searching it out."
"I love this bottle, it is very nice. Anyway for not being a huge stout fan I really enjoyed this beer. It started with a nice easy pour and a nice litte head that was thick and foamy. The smell was kind of light, however the first taste was very surprising. I got a kind of pepto bismol feeling in terms of it coating the entire inside of my mouth. The thick mouthfeel was nice, seemed almost like drinking really runny gravy. I was very pleased with how well this beer tasted, the coffee and toffee flavors were nicely fitted to the thickness of this stout. I drank this and all I could think of was man I wish I had bought two."
"Backwash: I had several of these during The Open Championship weekend, finishing off the last during the post-tournament coverage with a great cigar (this is a great cigar beer. It really brought out the espresso & chocolate notes in the cigar). This may be a bit expensive, but I think its one of the rare authentic versions of this beer style around. There are a few American versions, but with Mackesons being made in the USA now and a shadow of itself, this is a nice substitute."
"Taste:...not bad, very thick, sticks in the mouth, gets smoother as we go. Reminds me of an oatmeal, rather than a cream. Easily tossed back into the gullet, but retains a wicked, dark character that rides through the finish. Actually, I look into rescinding my words as it gets silkier and smoother with each subsequent sip, still brimming with dark, chocolatey, coffeeish flavors. Very nice, even very, VERY nice. There, I said it...Mmmmm, me likey..."
"But the first taste was as if someone ( maybe a vile serpent) spat its venom into my mouth and then sloshed in a mouthful of week-old coffee. Maybe I am yet to learn the subtleties of a good cream stout but this concoction had me giving up beer for a week just to let my poor pallet recover and to let the blackness fade from me tongue. I paid 2.89 for a pint bottle of this beverage and I feel as if they may have fleeced the poor old country boy."
"Color of this stout is inky black with a creamy brown head. Aroma is an inviting chocolate and coffee combo. The flavor has a good roasted malt chocolaty bitterness with ahint of coffee in the finish. I like when the roasted malt bitterness has this chocolate presence."
"Mouthfeel is pretty typical for the cream stout style, thicker than your average beer, but thinner than an imperial, not bad though. Drinkability on this seemed decent as well."
"All and all another excellent offering from St. Peters. The second offering I've tried from them and certainly not the last."
"Reminiscent of Dogfish Head Chicory Stout. Definite coffee flavors prevail, with not as much sweetness as expected. A long bitter finish. This is an excellent stout, very complex, though not what I've come to expect from a cream stout."
"It goes down smooth like cream and has a delightful mouthfeel... I really enjoyed this one and prefer it over most other stouts. Will drink again."
"Black, opaque, tan soft head, a very good looking beer. Chocolate milk aromas, low carbonation, creamy moutfeel. nice roastiness, malt to the flavor. More chocolate on the back of the mouth. A decent drinking beer. I tried it, don't know if I would go out of my way to look for it, but I wouldn't turn one down if offered one."
"*and me when I'm drunk and have no food lying around but Iams."
"Nice rich flavors, smooth creamy mouthfeel and good balance all equal excellent drinkability. Cool bottle to boot!"
"I cannot imagine where there are not more cream stouts out there."
"Finally found a bunch of brews from St. Peter's so I was very excited to see the cream stout. I must say, they have kick ass bottles. Pours out black with a tannish head that goes away quickly. Carbonation is still seen around the out edges of the glass. Smell consisted of all sorts of things. Mostly burnt items. Coffee, chocolate, malts and some graininess to it. Taste was almost the same as the nose. Some bittersweet chocolate starts out and gives away to a grain/malt middle and finishes with some coffee flavors that lasts into the aftertaste. Finishes quite dry which was surprising. I was expecting it to be a little more wet aftertaste to it. But a very nice cream stout and worth checking out for sure."
"Mmmm...very good brew. Bottle itself is good eye candy...reminds me of the old cough medicine bottles of my childhood. Great appearance...decent chunky head...nice lacing and almost jet black appearance. Robust smoky malt aroma wafts the nostrils very nicely. Taste is rich, malty and full-bodied, with a hop finish that dries the back of the palate. Mouthfeel is excellent..a combination of smoothness with an astringent dryness that I like in a good stout. Very easy on the drinkability scale...mouthfeel invites you to sip again. Highly recommend."
"And yes, the flask-shaped bottle is very cool."
"The beer as it emerges from the unique flask shaped bottle resides in the glass a pitch-black color with a smallish and bubbly light chocolate head, the lace a velum like sheet to cover the glass. Nose has nice coffee aroma, also hints of bitter-sweet chocolate and sweet malt, start is sweet with a rich in roasted grain profile, the top is middling in its feel. Finish has a meaningful acidity, the hops delectable and a bit spicy, very dry almost vinous aftertaste, a quite nice stout and it compliments the Porter quite nicely."
"This stout is really Stout. The smell and taste is potent, but at the same time very elegant and well balanced. The almost overwhelming flavour and the soft carbon dioxide almost invite you to a really slow drinking experience that could last all night. Pleasant in its own way, but in some cases, it might be just too much."
"It pours an opaque black with a tan head. There is some choclate and grassy hops in the aroms. Roasted malts are at the forefront of the flavor. Bittersweet chocolate and coffee are prevelant. It finishes a tad dry with a lingering roasty quality. I would have liked to see the body a bit bigger, but overall a satisfying beer."
"Not quite what I was expecting from this brew, but it's a pleasant surprise. Rather audacious, especally for a british stout. Well balanced and very tasty."
"The beer pours a deep black color with a thick tan head. The aroma is good. It has a roasted chocolate scent that is very pleasant. It is also full of black malts which add a nice crisp aroma. The taste is good. It has a sweet rich chocolate flavor that finishes creamy. It has a good black malt underbelly. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with low/adequate carbonation. This beer is a real drinker. It has good flavor and a creamy finish; a must with my favorite stouts."
"Poured from the bottle with light carbonation. Completely opaque."
"Beef Notes: I didn't let this warm up enough before I started drinking it, and it was much better once it warmed. Let this be a lesson, don't drink your stouts cold. Gotta love that bottle though."
"The stout, itself, is dark in appearance, roasted barley and cocoa in the nose, medium creamy in mouth-feel and slightly bitter in aftertaste. It's not over-powering in any sense of the word and quite drinkable, but not robust enough to make me search it out as I do other stouts. Overall, not a bad brew by any stretch."
" Pours a dark black colored body and with a rough pour, the head appeared to look a bit like a nice frothy chocolate milk shake. On the nose whiffs of dark chocolate and expresso. On the palate more of the same, dark choclate, coffee, roatiness, sweetness, and a little hops in there for some balance. Mouthfeel is fairly smooth and creamy. Well done...a very good brew."
"Obsidian liquid with only the shadow of a brownish head. Theres very little carbonation. Roast barley aromaground coffee, chocolate, and very faint hops. The foretaste is sweet, with the continuance of the roast barley character. Hops come out in the finish, which seems a little dry for the style. Its decidedly full-bodied, thick, creamy, and almost chewy. This is a solid, well-made, and very enjoyable stout. Although not extraordinarily complex, its very easy to drink and the heft makes it seriously satisfying."
"This strikes me as more as a slow, savoring drinking beer. But then aren't all stouts?"
"16.9 ounce bottle."
"This stout poured an opaque black color with sudsy brown foam that settled but clung to the glass a little bit. The smell was dark malt with notes of chicory, mollasses, roasted barley, and something sweet. The taste was dark, roasted malt with some sweetness (oatmeal? cream?) and a distinct, resinous hop bitterness especially in the finish that reminded me more of an imperial stout than a cream stout. The flavor was best up front, but became too dry and bitter in the finish. The mouthfeel was smooth but with a very bitter finish. The body was medium-full with low carbonation. The finish was dry with an astringent, hoppy aftertaste. This was an OK stout, but not what I expected."
"First things first, I'd buy this beer for the bottle alone. I appreciate a nice label but this beer goes all the way with presentation. It poured up nice producing a tan, frothy head that ligered a bit before fading back to the beer. The color was very nice, a deep red color that at first isn't noticable but comes out when held to the light. A nice aroma that has a hint of a cocoa fragrance. The first taste was very nice. It has a full flavor and a smooth mouthfeel. I was a bit surprised to find out how thin it ended up being. I was expecting more from cream stout. The flavor is good and again has a taste of cocoa in it. Very easy to drink which was evident from the glass always seeming half empty left with some nice lacing. Overall, a very good stout."
"Pours a not-quite-opaque black, brown around the edges. The head is weak and fades into a weather pattern. The aroma is odd. Something like a chocolate-flavored sour cream. That sour cream thing had me concerned, but at the first sip, I noticed no sourness and I never did pick up a sourness in the flavor. The flavor is heavy on the cream, slight coffee and chocolate. The mouthfeel is slick and oily. Quite the interesting beer."
"this one pours a deep black colour, with my only complaint being a lack of head, but most (if not all) sweet/milk stouts i have sampled have had a lack of head so, not a major complaint. it's got (what i see as) a fairly typical english/irish stout smell. sweet, with hints of chocolate, maybe a bit of caramel and malt. coffee in the smell was lacking here. the taste was quite nice. body was full and had a bit of smoke flavour to it with some coffee and perhaps some slight buttery hints. the taste is more dry and bitter than sweet, though the sweetness is definitely here and provides for a creamy brew that may bit a bit over carbonated, thus killing the smoothness a touch. overall, a good ole cream stout that i'd be happy to revisit again."
"I recommend this 100%! Easily one of the best stouts out there."
"Drinkability: One of the best cream/milk stouts I've tried. Flask- shaped bottle is unique as well."
"Smooth and creamy feel, with a black malt acidic bite, a bit syrupy."
"A good English milk stout. A nice changeup from big bitter stouts. Always good to explore stouts of all varieties. Must check out other St. Peter's brews..."
"Overall, St. Peter's Cream Stout is a pretty tasty beer. It has a nice balance and good range of flavors that make it quite easy to drink. Worth a try if you see it."
"This lovely liquid pours out of St. Peter's trademark brown flask a dark ruby reddish brown under a one finger dark tan head that settles to film fairly quickly, but then lasts and lasts and lasts, leaving some nice lace work down the glass. The nose is full of roasted malts and a touch of hops. The mouth is mildly carbonated with a body consistency similar to milk. The taste opens with smooth roasted nuts and thick milk, perhaps half and half. This sensation is followed by a strong coffee-like bitterness. The coffee and milk combination sounds like a cappuccino, but that's not quite right. Perhaps espresso with milk would be closer. The aftertaste is mainly roasted bitter, but the milkiness lingers, too. This beer leaves a very nice impression."
"This beer poured a very dark color with a very small head. The aroma was chocolate, coffee, malts, milk, and several other things. Excellent aroma. The flavor was smooth and enjoyable and not as sweet as expected. The flavor was mostly like the aroma with some sort of fruits hidden as well. Body was medium and drinkability was fairly smooth."
"Pours a four-fingered light brown head that leaves a nice lace. pour SLOWLY. Totally opaque black color. Nose is roasted coffee. Starts with roasted coffee flavor, mouthfeel is incredible smooth. Finishes with a good stout bitterness. Low carbonation and heavy bodied. $4.45 for a 500ml bottle."
"cool bottle. pours very black with a small tan head. strong aroma of dark chocolate, smells like a big strong cappuccino. somewhat crisp yet slighty creamy mouthfeel. small hop bite but the main show is an onslaught of roasted malt/dark chocolate. finishes slightly sweet. this is a damn tastey stout! very drinkable. hearty yet not too filling."
"I dig the bottle! I was able to pour the whole 16 oz into my pint glass because very very little tan head formed on this black black stout. Not very smooth for the style. The creamy flavor is there with a hunk of coffee and hints of coco. A wholesome roasty flavor rounds out this brew. Some hops add balance. I'd drink another, but I want to know where the smooth mouthfeel that I expect from a cream stout went."
"Poured a jet black with a cocoa colored head that had medium to low retention. After dissapting to thin film, this left moderate lacing. Aromas were of burnt chocolate, sweet barley malts and a bitter hoppiness. Flavors included a sweeter chocolate taste, and a strong hop presence along with a roasty maltiness. The carbonation was low, which I like, but the mouthfeel was a little thin and watery. This didn't effect the taste, but I would have prefered it to be a little silkier, smoother. Not a bad stout, but nothing extraordinary."
"Pours with NO head, none, zip, zilch, zero... just a couple bubbles (no more then a glass of apple juice) that all disappear. Color is solid black. The aroma is distinctly of chocolate malts. The palate is quite creamy and chocolaty with strong notes of Irish Cream. The rich flavors along with the lack of carbonation give this brew more of a rich liqueur feel then I would have expected. There are some slight roasted notes towards the end that linger a little bit in the aftertaste as a slight bitterness. Not much hops here, just some subtle hints towards the end. The mouthfeel is flat... no carbonation anywhere. This really makes the beer flop, and Im wondering if I got a bad bottle. Had there even been a slight bit of carbonation here it could have sent this one over the top. This was quite a sweet brew that would definitely be suited as an after dinner or desert beer."
"Eclipse black color, very small head. Enormous chocolaty aroma. A medium bodied stout. Mild malts, kind of smoky. The chocolate flavor is mostly in the aroma. Smooth taste, sort of chocolate milk like. A nice sipping stout. This or Young's D Choc Stout would be a good introduction to the style. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is sweet."
"While the container does not count toward whether I like a beer's flavor or not, this beer does have an interesting olive green flask-style bottle."
"Yum!! Make that two Yums!! I do like this stout. Yum!! Thick black brew with brown head, it has a classic stout look,you know the one, just gazing into the glass makes you want to jump right in and float on top for awhile. Huge sweet roasted coffee aroma that encourages the glass to your lips. Very nice, smooth,creamy, nice medium body that makes the lifting a little easier. This beer just floats on the tongue. Lots of roasted grain flavor with enough sweetness to balance the grains. Did I forget to mention that I enjoyed this beer very much?!!"
"A good rush of chocolate, coffee, and smoke in this nice little stout. Both of these flavors are prominant on the palate, but the finish is long, smooth and pleasing. There is a small amount of bitterness, but that only heightens the coffee flavor and is matched well with a very, very faint sweetness. The color is so opaque it's almost like a black hole...it seems to absorb light! There are very few bubbles and only slight hints of lacing. One of the best imported stouts I've tried."
"Mmmm. Right out of the bottle this one smelled great, like dark chocolate. It poured with a very thin head that settled into a thin ring around the glass. After the first sip, the great coffee flavors hit me first, with a hint of chocolate, followed by a slight bitterness at the end. My only complaint in the flavor department is that the roasted coffee flavor was so good, I wanted more. But you can't have everything eh?. It had a great creamy mouthfeel, but could have been improved with a little more carbonation. Overall, a highly enjoyable brew."
"Says cream stout on the label. The back of the bottle expands this to chocolate cream stout. It's fairly smooth, with the overlying flavour somewhere between chocolate and carob. There's a good touch of coffee/java type flavours. The finish long, with a hint of hop bitterness and lingering carob. Absolutely no head whatsoever on this beer - A very hard pour yielded a few big bubbles, but nothing that stayed. Quite a good beer otherwise."
"I enjoyed this stout and I'm looking forward to trying some of the other St. Peter's beers."
"An English Beer from an American Bottle, that cost me $1.99 from Trader Joes, not bad for the quality, and curiously I noted, cheaper than what I used to pay for it in England - what a truly crazy world we live in?!!?!!?"
"This brew comes in a flask shaped bottle that cries out cheap swill. Upon closer inspection it is from an English microbrewer so I was more than game to try. Pours an incredible deep black, head disappated fairly quickly, lacing was sparse. Taste was very tilted towards chocolate as was the aroma, very inviting actually. Nice semi roasty taste and fairly smooth. Already thinnish mouthfeel lost even more body as the glass emptied. Worth a try."
"The only problem I had with this brew is that it could have used a bit more smoothness, other than that it was quite a tasty brew and paired well with some fresh mocha chocolate chip cookies. Who needs milk …"
