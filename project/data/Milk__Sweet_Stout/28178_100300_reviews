"A very good beer but a bit strong and oily for my personal taste.  Still very tasty though lots of flavor and body and the alcohol isn't overpowering I just prefer the 5-8% range."
"Loved this Batch 545-546 - creamy, rich and smooth!"

"Verdict: A simple, but balanced and enjoyable stout from Pipeworks. The ABV is hidden well and for a bigger beer, this is quite easy to drink, but it almost works against itself as nothing really leaps out off the tongue. Definitely a nice stout for the cold weather."
"O â€“ Another great Pipeworks brew. Tasty and slightly sweet."

"M: Really smooth oily and creamy. Real appealing on the tongue and goes down really well. A bit sweet but expected with a milk stout. Medium-Full body."

"Overall - Better than Jones Dog, but mostly because of all the chocolate in it."

"Taste is also sweet with chocolate up front, and some coffee bitterness in the aftertaste. Lingering roastiness, ok carbonation, though it feels a little thin. Pretty drinkable. I liked imperial Hyper Dog better, but this was pretty good."

"Overall: Milk stouts have never been a favorite of mine but Pipeworks does them well. This one is sweet, almost too much so but drinks well."
"Overall this is one of the better of the dog series in my opinion. Great chocolate complexity offering both creamy and bittersweet chocolate aromas and flavors."

"This is another really solid offering from Pipeworks. It has a really smooth milk chocolate taste with a good malty body. I like the deep dark coloring, and it has a sweet vanilla nose on it. Plus, I'm a huge fan of the label art and love that they incorporated Game Of Thrones like this. Really well done."
"It's a big sweet stout that's drinkable and packed with dessert like flavors. Doesn't get much better than that."
"o: Very tasty milk stout from Pipeworks. I've not had many in this style but it's among the best I have had. On any given sip, the 10% is hardly detectable but it accumulates very nicely over the course of the bottle. Only quibble is I wish the vanilla was more prominent. Nicely done."
"Pipeworks Game Of Jones ---4/5."
""
"O: Overall, a pretty good sweet stout that would make a damn fine dessert beer."

"Poured into Upland snifter. Pours a deep brownish black with medium visual weight. Dark brown head forms upon pour and retains a thin layer. No lacing present. The nose is cacao forward with a strong influence from the lactose sugar presenting a bit of cream. Vanilla comes in at the finish and is paired with a helping of roasted malts. Taste is very chocolatey up front with roastiness picking up in intensity with each sip. The roast provides a little bitterness, but it quickly rounded out by vanilla and cream. There is a slight boozy presence at the very end which will inevitably mellow out once this beer has had a few months on it. Mouthfeel is hearty with moderate carbonation. Another tasty brew from Pipeworks!"
"Incredibly smooth and delicious this beer doesn't even hint at the fact that it's double digit ABV. Great chocolatey taste, pleasant aroma I plan on picking up an extra bottle for the cellar post-haste. I might be presumptuous in saying this right now, but I believe this is the best of the stouts Pipeworks has made."
