3.78,-6.7,3.5,3.5,4,3.75,3.75,"This may be THE classic milk/sweet stout, although technically XXX is a stronger version brewed in Trinidad, not the same exact beer as the lower ABV version from the UK. But whatever. Mackeson XXX pours an inky black hue, maybe just shy of dark brown, with red highlights at the bottom of the glass. Ample mocha colored head but this breaks down quite quickly. Smells like coffee extract, brown toast, iron oxide, a touch of smoke, a whiff of earthy English bittering hops. Palate is chocolate milk, butterscotch toffee, cold coffee, a little raisin and walnut, ample malt character and one can taste those earthy English hops just a bit as well. Silky smooth creamy body but not thick at all, high drinkability for such a dark beer. Finish is sweet and malty but not cloying ... There's a little husky astringency which provides a foil to the other components on the palate. My high ratings may reflect some bias towards sweet dark beers, and this one is super sweet, minimally bitter and not a dark chocolate and coffee bomb like some well-crafted stouts hailing from other styles. A pleasant diversion from my usual quest for hoppy and bitter (or malty and thick ... Although I suppose this one does evoke a chocolate and coffee milkshake).","CalgaryFMC","Dec 05, 2013"

4.67,15.3,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.75,"I personally like stout, and of all the stouts I've ever tasted, because they did not skimp on the malt I like this the most. Huge malt taste dominates significant hops, but not by much. This is a drink that cries out for a very hearty pairing -- smoked meats or fish, robust multi-grained bread with dominating aged cheese such as Roaring Forties Bleu. Like an Islay Single Malt, it is not a beer that anyone will not have an opinion about. I haven't been able to find it in about 2 years, and I am dismayed if it is no longer brewed. If anyone knows something similar, let me know.","Lonestargazer52","Mar 12, 2013"

I picked up a bottle back in April of 2008 and enjoyed it quite a bit. The beer poured out as a really nice black color with a thin tan head on it. The smell of the beer has some creamy wooden barrel aromas coming off of it along with some sweet roasted coffee and chocolate. The taste was creamy and had a very nice flavor all the things I mentioned from the smell. The mouthfeel was slick and creamy. Overall I'll miss this beer, had no clue it was retired till now. Maybe I'll stumble upon some again one day down the road and get to try it again.","Knapp85","Jun 25, 2011"
3.68,-9.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the smooth mouthfeel. As the beer poured it looked inviting, creamy, and bubbly. To this it did not disappoint, with the mouth left coated and satiated. Actually, what is almost even more impressive about this beer is that it is made in the Caribbean. You certainly would not expect a stout to come from this region, and certainly not a decent one, so that was a nice surprise in itself.","TheBrewo","Feb 09, 2011"

3.75,-7.4,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"I wanted to try as many different beers as I could in St. Martin/St. Maarten, and the main choices were pale lagers and stout. Guinness was the stout that most bars on the island featured. But I found this beer for sale at L'Epicierie de la Plage on Boulevard Grand Case for $1.50 each. This was stout #4 that I sampled. Poured into a tall glass. Had a dark appearance with a tan colored head. Smell was like roasted cocoa and coffee. Really liked the taste, but it was a tad on the tame side. Nothing stood out. The other milk stout from Carib that I tried, the Royal Extra Stout, was super sweet but 6.5% abv. Mackeson, which is also a milk/sweet stout from the same brewery, tasted more like an Irish stout, and did not have that sweetness I expected. Plus, the abv is much lower in this beer. So, if you want a sweet stout, my vote is for Royal Extra. If you want a low abv & dry stout, then Mackeson is a good choice down in the Caribbean.","morebeergood","Nov 18, 2010"

The flavor and mouthfeel is lush and creamy, silky smooth, only slightly sweet and an incredible creamy flavor and feel. Milk chocolate notes are first and foremost, only hints of roasted coffee and caramel. This beer is so damn smooth and creamy, it's unbelievable. Low ABV makes this beer incredibly drinkable for stout. I wouldn't mind putting back several of these in one sitting, it's so tasty and so easy to drink.

Poured an opaque black with a half inch, dense, mocha-colored head that dissipated into a broken film in under 30 seconds, leaving behind a tight band around the bowl of the glass. Some spatterings of lacing present during the session. Aromas of dark fruit, toffee and molasses intermingled, as well as something else in the back (perhaps lactose). Flavor profile is difficult to describe. There are elements of the nose present, but the balance seems off and character seems muddled; maybe lactose, maybe coffee, perhaps a hint of vanilla. Mouthfeel is between light- and medium-bodied with ample carbonation and a buttery feel at the finish, but seems a little off-style.

Very mild hops add to the bitter finish which cuts through the sweetness up front. Not alot of hidden fruit flavors. Fairly well carbonated(more than typical stout) but still creamy which gave a nice feel and added a crisper note at the end than expected. Carbonation almost scrubs off the sweet flavor.

In a true """beer clean""" glass, it pours night black with a firm, head approximately 1 1/2""" in height. As it dissipates, it leaves a nice lacy web on the glass. For most people this is going to be a """love it or hate it""" type of brew. Rich, complex flavor that contains a raisiny sweetness with a hint of smoky chocolate. An almost merlot like aftertaste lnspired me to try this with good babrbecued ribs. Outstanding choice to go with the smoky pork. I marked it down a bit on overall drinkability as, to me, this is one of those brews that can become too much of a good thing. That is, after 4 or 5, they start to feel a bit cumbersome.

A fairly good aromatic brew. The taste, for me, was a bit of a let down. I know that this is a sweet stout, but for me it was a little too sweet and that seemed to be the flavor that I kept coming back to. Other flavors that come out are roasted malt, caramel, chocolate, which I think, plays a big part in the sweet flavors and some nuttiness. It seems to be a pretty easy drinking brew, but I can not have more than one of these at a sitting as the sweetness was getting to me and I actually seemed to struggle with the last ¼.","Stimack","Oct 20, 2007"

This took a good long while to settle and by the time it did the entire glass was thickly coated in a tan frothy mess of lace down the sides. The aroma was very pleasant. Lots of notes of chocolate and coffee, but not very sweet, more of a burnt coffee, dark chocolate type of aroma with a hint of some grain like back to it. The taste followed along the same lines. The first initial flavor was a deep roasted malt, which was followed up almost immediately by a burnt coffee type flavor. The finish was very dry and rounded out well with a deep dark chocolate feel. Very thick on this one and also very nicely carbonated. By no means was this at all flat in any way. Good creamy feel and enough body to make this a good sipper. ABV was pretty low, and aside from how filling it was you could have more then one in a session. Overall this was pretty decent for a somewhat macro stout.

4.5,11.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Taste - now that's a good stout. First it's roasty, then it sweet, then its chared, then its syrup...very muli-layered flavors, all of which are from lack of intense hops. As much as I understand the love of hops, generally an notably hoppy beers wind up having the hops take over the flavor of the beer and make it hard for anything but the most dominant charateristic of the malt bill to make a showing unless, there's some brewing voodoo in there.. but with english style stuff, the complexity of the malt bill can shine, as it does here. How did I miss drinking this for so long? Okay, after a few sips the sweetness can get a bit old much like strong hops can, but it's got so many other levels going on here, that it's hard to be bored. So as a style, I think I prefer the dryer standard stouts I have been sipping for a while now over this kind of sweet stout, but man, this is one good stout. Apart from disliking the heavy carbonation level (personal preference), this is syrupy sweet for a 4.9% brew - i'm guessing the low alcohol with lots of sweetness and a thick mouthfeel is due to mashing a temperature that yields a lot of unfermentables, hence the full body and sweeter flavor. Other stouts seem to do the opposite - all sweetness is lost (hence the dry) as every molecule of sugar must have been converted to alcohol and then the brew has been watered down to a relative low alcohol percentage, leaving the light roasted taste, low alcohol and low calorie beer. To sum it up, This is """the biggest session beer I've ever had.""" So long as the sweetness doesn't get to you. A surprise of a find that I'm not sure how I missed up to this point.","Liquids","Feb 17, 2007"

While I don't think it's a great beer, I give it an enthusiastic thumbs-up and most definitely would buy it again and again.","longarm","Feb 10, 2007"
3.85,-4.9,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured into nonic glass it produced a 2 inch tan head. Head became compact but persitent. Very dark brown to black. Initial very sweet malt aroma. Taste was sweet up front. Moderate roastiness followed along with a tad more bittering hop than I expected (a good thing in my book), probably Target or Challenger. Mouthfeel was smooth overall but slightly cloying. Very drinkable. I first had Mackeson when I was in high school and remembered it to taste more like sweet espresso than it does now ; more likely that my taste has changed through the years. Can't get these in cheap 12 packs like Whitbread ($8.99) an InBev stablemate also brewed in Cincinnatti.","alehopman","Feb 01, 2007"

3.6,-11.1,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours inky-black to the eye, like upending a bottle of Kikkoman. Held up to the light it remains opaque - this would appear to the novice as some imposing, weighty stuff! Creamy burnt sienna head is visually impressive while it lasts; it fades to a token ring of lace within a minute or two. The nose is roast malts with notes of cocoa, iodine, and medicinal alcohol. It actually suggests a tangy, bittersweet brew. Yep, this is the brew I remember from some years back (or as near as possible): bittersweet, tangy, roasty, and lactic tang - all on the first sip! I remember what a switch-up this was from a Guinness, back in the days when the only stouts we could find were imported. Sweet, almost *too* sweet, with a partway chalky, partway oily mouthfeel. Somewhat viscous, with its sugary sweet creamyness cut nicely by the lactic tang. Not much alcohol in this one, but what there is of it becomes more apparent in both the nose and aromatics as it warms. Notes of rum, prunes, and dates, with some sour cherry thrown in there for good measure. The cocoa notes on the nose are just as subdued on the palate (as is that touch of iodine!), and both the roasted and dark malts are prominent throughout. Nice carbonation - just enough to keep from ever feeling overbearing. I think of this as a very proper dessert beer, nightcap, or digestif -- the sweetness would keep it from being something I'd want to session, and it would definitely be the last beer I'd drink if I were to have more than a couple, it's just got that treacly, roasty, lactose quality going for it which would no doubt intrude on lighter ales. An old favorite from when it was a true import, I'm glad to see it holds up so well so many years later - unlike the Whitbread.","Chaz","Dec 21, 2006"

Sweet coffee comes out much stronger in the taste with the chocolate taking a back seat. Finish is incredibly smooth with the slightest hint of hops, but leaves an odd tingle in my mouth after a while that only goes away if I take another sip...

Hidden english hops dry out the aftertaste for a good balance and just enough lingering molasses flavor. Finishes mostly dry with only a slight residual sweetness.

Frankly I might call this more of a """milk porter"""; the roast flavor is so low, it's just that I know it's supposed to be there. That said, it's tasty.

Aroma is fresh and fantastic; malts, chocolate, sweet syrup and earth tones blend wonderfully. Taste is very good, but a bit of a let down compared to the lead on the aroma gives. Flavors of roasted malts, cocoa, maple, sweet wood and a touch of bready dough and sugar. Mouthfeel was good for the style, but if it had a more chewy element, this brew could easily be the Sweet Stout to which all others are judged.

Syrupy texture holds soft flavors of coffee, cocoa, roastiness, breadiness, and cream. Lactic acids provide slight souring, but not off-putting.

Sweet tasting, the sweetness almost completely obscures any stout-like bitterness. Nice mouthfeel, a bit of creaminess. I can only liken this to drinking choclate milk with a head on it.

It's literally black, with a dark brown head. It looks like it came from Starbucks. Doesn't really smell like much. The taste isn't so much sweet as it is...alcoholic. Even though the APV isn't very high, the stout body and milky sweetness combine to give it a distinct rum flavor. Other reviews say that this beer is too sweet, but I disagree. I think it is extremely smooth, very easy to drink, but not exactly sweet--just not bitter and acrid. Aftertaste is a bit more roasty as the stout shines through.

A smallish creamy deep brown head tops the body. Strong aroma of coffee grounds, chocolate, and rich roasted malt. Beautiful creamy body, no doubt due in part to the lactose. Palate is redolent of sweet roasted malt, with notes of chicory, the slightest touch of root vegetable, and a hint of a metallic tinge throughout.

Never had a sweet stout before, so the sweetness kind of took me by surprise. First to the palate is a flash of acrid black patent malt, quickly taken up by rich roasted barley and mocha. Then the creamy lactose taste comes in - like coffee with lots of creamer. Even a bit of hops at the very end. Pretty clean finish with a little coffee in it. Mouthfeel is milky creamy and malty smooth, helped along by healthy carbonation. Man this is one easy drinking stout! I wish this was the standard """dark beer""" offered in bars instead of Guinness.

There was a nice 2 finger tan head that fell to coat the beer. The nose was very nice, with a dominant sweet and creamy chocolate. The flavor was right at what I expect a milk stout to be. Sweet and creamy and chocolatey. Not a lot of marshmallowy character, but enough to let me know there is a little there. Well done. The feel was thick and creamy, very drinkable. I will be drinking this one again. I like the balance between extreme and not enough in the flavor and nose.","kmpitz2","Apr 02, 2005"

The smell is of roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, but it's got a distinct sweetness to it. The taste completely belies the appearance of this ale: it looks heavy and bitter, but the taste, while stout, is a bit sweet, with the lactose completely smoothing everything out. There is a strong caramel-toffee taste over the deep roast flavor with coffee and chocolate hints, and a bit of plum and raisin. The yeast is barely evident. The moutfeel is oily but smooth, and with a bit more carbonation could be rated a 4.5. It is not so drinkable because it is so sweet. Almost a dessert beer.","kosmoraios","Feb 13, 2005"

The body of the beer pours out a nice solid black that reveals ruby-red highlights when held up to light. The head is tan; nice and clumpy, with good retention. The nose is nice; nice aroma of dark fruits like plums, I also pick up some berries and roasted coffee. Wow, first thing that jumps out at me is how creamy the mouthfeel isits nice and fluffy, but still goes down rather slickly. In the flavor I get a nice bitter roasty malt, and a puff of smoke as well. The dark fruit and berry flavors are there and I can make out a thin residual sweetness. The mouthfeel tends to thin out as the head dissipates. This beer is quenching, and at under 5% ABV it practically jumps into the session stout category.","FormatKid","Oct 21, 2004"

The tanginess from the lactose is apparent up front, but not overpowering, and it quickly mingles with a sweet burnt chocolate flavor. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy.

3.41,-15.8,3,4.5,3,3.5,3,"Pours with an initially respectable 1/2""" head of dirty brown foam that decays almost instantly to spotty, swirling lace. A ring of the stuff, huddled along the edges of this brownish black liquid, gives a shortish cling. Dusty, yeasty nosefeel encompasses smells of malted milk, cocoa powder, and dark, roasted barley. With warmth, the balance shifts and substantially improves, incorporating hints of cafe au lait and praline. Taste is comforting at first, with dark, sweet, and bready Ovaltine characteristics, before... falling apart into waxy carob and refined sugar. Overall flavors of chocolate soda pop with a touch of shortening do not deliver on the promise of the aromas. Again: rich, waxy mouthfeel with a tingle of carbonation; finally a slightly bitter, coffeeish aftertaste. This would be drinkable as a nightcap or a pick-me-up but I would not care to have more than one.

The scents of dark chocolate, cream and roasted malt make up the majority of the nose and it is quite appetizing. Roasted malt and chocolate hit the palette first with this as a creamy taste comes in after with a nice sweetness. There are notes of espresso in this and it ends with a nice bittersweet finish.

The aroma is promising -- it smells like it could be a rich but balanced stout. Yet without the backbone of hoppiness on the finish, this stout becomes pretty monotone about half way through. I'd say it's a great beer to suggest to non-beer lovers: the kind of folks (unfortunately, many women I am ashamed to admit) who either get the blandest tasting mainstream lite beer or opt for a sweet cocktail just to remain part of the crowd.

This one was a bit way to sweet for my likes.

It's just about opaque with a solid and foamy dark brown head. A nice and mellow aroma of chocolate malts and sweetness helps it to entice. Damn I love this style of stout! This is no schlep in the milk stout department. A wonderful blend of chocolate malts, hops, and a creamy smooth mouthfeel make this one drinkable damn stout. Since I love the US brewed version so much, I can't wait to try the native brewed stout if I ever make it to England.

The chocolate roasted malts hit you fairly strong. The taste is a slice of heaven on earth, a wonderful blend of the chocolate malts, lactose sugar, and hops. This has a moderately heavy mouthfeel but not as heavy as this appears. The overall drinkability of this brew is near perfect.

The first thing you notice is the smoothness of flavor and finishing sweetness. The only problem is this beer has a tendency to be a bit too sweet to drink more than one. My husband used to love it but got sick of it. It finishes with a malt taste in which the black patent malt is evident in the subtle roast finish flavor.","Reneejane","Jan 18, 2004"

A roasted burnt flavor up front which finishes with a sweetness mixed by an acidity from the roast malt character. It is like a strong bitter coffee up front but then finishes like a coffee with a bunch of cream and sugar added. The last sensation, after the beer has left my mouth, is an astringency from the burnt character. The sweetness from the lactose balances the strong roast/ burnt character, which otherwise would overwhelm this beer. I actually like this beer a lot more than I was expecting too.","Gueuzedude","Jan 14, 2004"

The taste is great. It is extremely sweet and smooth with a chocolate flavor. This is really good. It has a really sweet taste, probably achieved by the use of lactose (an unfermentable milk sugar).

Taste: A great mix of bitter sweet the lactose milkiness is amazing in this brew that creamy sugary tone is upfront and I am loving it like a malt or milkshake very good then the bitter deep roasted barley tones come around with the likes of chocolate and coffee tones very nice brew. Mouthfeel: A tad thinner than expected definitely lighter bodied compared to most stouts but this one has that trademark whipped cream like sweetness.

I also detect just a whiff of smoky aroma, too. Taste is very good. Crispy chocolate-covered toffee, roasted coffee, caramel, creamy sweetness, and just a bit of hoppy bitterness are all found within each sip (the wife said it tasted like chocolate milk). Good, full-bodied mouthfeel. Drinkability scores high as this is a very creamy-smooth beer that just massages your palate. Very tasty and easy-to-drink.

Similar notes of roasted malt, caramel, coffee, licorice and dark fruit linger. Mouthfeel is a bit overly carbonated and could stand to be a bit more smooth and oily.

4.07,0.5,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Virtually black, with a flash of clear, deep crimson when held to light. Moderately thick, well retained mud brown head leaves lace. The aroma is comprised of rich, bittersweet chocolate and burnt, carbonized barley contrasted by purely sweet lactose and dark caramel. As it breathes, suggestions of browned butter and treacle surface and add depth. Seductively soft aromawise. Abrupt brash of roasted barley bitterness is promptly tapered by simple, pleasant sweetness both residual and lactose derived. Chocolate malt and gentle hop bitterness arise mid palate in an understated fashion, but synergistically couple with the static sweetness to lend a dominant brown sugared mocha impression. Subdued fruitiness of a raisiny nature adds a slight sweettart contrast late. A notch shy in body to support the firm roasted grain and sugar balance, but certainly passably dextrinous and light on the palate. Akin to lowfat chocolate milk in mouthfeel. Finishes cleanly bittersweet, with fleeting hints of treacle glazed coffee bean. Mackeson XXX is a delightful brew that strikes an enjoyable balance of sweetness and roasted grain character. With a fuller overall body this would be truly delectable.","marc77","Sep 10, 2003"

Wow, two great tastes for the price of one. The color is cool too, so brown it is a tad short of black. Lovely aromas of chocolate malt and some coffee extract. In the mouth all malted milk, well a hint of roasted mocha too. If you love a good malted you will throughly enjoy this stuff. Perhaps one of the best malteds I've had-almost as good as moms!!!

Pours the deepest darkest brown (you'd see more light through a brick wall) with a monstrous mocha head that cascades for minutes making for a circus of bubbles in my glass. The nose is exceedingly sweet--roasted coffe and warm milk undertones give it a very pleasant smell. The first sip was uniquely sweeter than most stouts and pleasingly creamy. The taste reflects the nose with coffee, dark chocolate, and warm milk all balanced perfectly in texture, but is definitely a """sweet stout""". This is one of those stouts that is enjoyable at all temperatures, but I recommend trying it after it has 'freed itself from the repressing chains of refridgeration' as it has and will build more character. One final note this beer rates high in an unseen category and that is value. At $7-8 per six pack it meets the final requirement for a 'session stout'. And yes, in my oh so humble opinion, it is far superior to Guiness.","TripelJ","Jun 08, 2003"

I mean, it combines a sweet malty aroma with those lovely chocolate undertones, I wish they had this scent available at the carwash. The beer drinks smooth, with a coffee chocolate taste.

There was no bitter or over bearing sweet after taste it was crisp and clean on the way down. Felt like I was drinking some chocolate milk to tell you the truth.

It also happened to be the first brew I ever tried from England as well. That was about 13 years ago. It still is one my all time favorites. Just happened to have some left over from a X-mas party so I recently drank away. For me, its the chocolate and coffee tones that put this so high on my scale of yummyness. Great roasty, smokey feel and taste the whole way through. Super smooth and very appetizing. Nice creamy, smoked cocoa flavors with a great balance of roasted barley and hops. Just enough to keep it from biting to much or going to sour. Deep, deep, deep, brown, almost black color with a nice tan head that fades equally across the top pretty quickly which opens nicely into the aromas of the smokey chocolate, coffee smell.

I could imagine this being what the bottom of a coffee pot tastes like. This is a beer I recomend not only for the novelty, but for the fine craft used to brew it!","GreatPondBrewer","Feb 25, 2003"
3.75,-7.4,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured pitch black with nice caramel colored head,very sweet bitter chocolate smell.Very sweet earthy chocolaty taste,maybe a bit to sweet but is very good.Low in strength wich makes it very drinkable,drinking one as I write this.Sweetest beer I think I have ever had.","oberon","Feb 15, 2003"

4.28,5.7,5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"I was poured a 5oz of this by the barkeep, but he wouldn't tell me what it was until after I finished it. Not what I was expecting. Pours out nice and dark with a good head. Tastes like a good stout, but there is a twist. It's sweet. A fruity goodness with just enough dry to keep it in check. This is a solid stout!","scottum","Feb 12, 2003"
3.78,-6.7,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,"Overall, this was not a bad beer. I was disappointed when I read on the side of the bottle that this beer is brewed in Cincinnati and not London. Tricky little bastards . . .","Quaffer","Feb 12, 2003"
4.9,21,5,5,5,5,4.5,"Pours thick and black with only a thin head at first that is quite deceptive. I thought that I was pouring too gently due to the thin head and poured the last third of the beer more aggressively to develop a good head. However, the head continued to slowly grow and grow into a tremendous creamy and rocky brown head well after I had finished pouring and damn near overflowed my glass! Retention is great and the head coats the glass as you drink. Nose is sweet milk chocolate with notes of fresh brewed coffee and caramel. The aroma definitely lets you know that youre in for a real treat! Smooth and oh so creamy in the mouth with a nice full body. Taste is every bit as good as the aroma leads you to believe with flavors of milk chocolate, coffee ice-cream, roasted malts, and chewy toffee. Some fruity notes are also present as well as a trace of hop bitterness. One of the finest stouts I have ever sampled.","Morris729","Feb 07, 2003"

4.83,19.3,5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Pours out as black as the devil's soul. The head is a dark brown also and settles out pretty quick. This is where looks can be deceiving. The taste is awesome - I now have a new favorite stout. Definite notes of coffee in the flavor. Smooth and very clean on the palate. This should be a mandatory try for any serious BA.","AtrumAnimus","Jan 15, 2003"
3.55,-12.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"An above average stout, but nothing to write home about compared to other stouts in my book. The brew is dark brown, nearly black, with a thick rocky head that dies quickly. The aroma is overly sweet for a stout...at first it smells nice, like a box of chocolates, but gets a little too sweet as you drink. Flavor continues to border on the too sweet, but is tolerable with flavors of milk chocolate, coffee, and roasted caramel. Needs more hops! A drinkable stout, but I was a bit let down. Much better stouts to be had out there.","IrishRedRock","Jan 08, 2003"
4.2,3.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"The archetypal black stout color, the head full and frothy in its texture, the lace a latticework of fine bubbles to coat the glass. Roasted grains, sweet milk chocolate, light coffee tones and quite pleasing to the nose. Ambrosial start, the top rich and thick, finish sprightly acidic, hops mellow and perfect for this style. Quite good stout in its own right and one I sample often.","Gusler","Jan 04, 2003"

3.56,-12.1,4,3,4,3,3.5,"Initially, this beer was a pleasant surprise. I'm used to a higher alcohol % from a stout, and thicker body. I'm very sensitive to overly sweet food or drinks (Young's double chocolate stout actually made my teeth hurt - very good beer, nonetheless!!), but I did not find this one to be overly sweet at first. Did seem sweeter after a couple, and more carbonated (almost soda-like). Good taste and goes down easily. Does not provide the overall warming quality of a stronger stout, but really nice to drink. I would not choose this over Shakespeare or Samuel Smith, but certainly worth trying.","JohnnyDuvel","Dec 17, 2002"
4.18,3.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Tasted at the Barrelhouse Brewing Company Microbrew Fest on November 9. One of the best 5 beers of the 50 I tried that evening. Pours an oily black with a thin beige head and minimal lacing. Aroma of chocolate. Smooth and creamy with a complex flavor and a light alcohol finish that made it a rather cozy beer!","Dogbrick","Dec 02, 2002"
2.64,-34.8,4.5,3,2.5,2.5,2,"Awesome jet black color, small creamy tan head, this stuff looks great, sweet chocolate milk aroma, very sweet with some burnt malt bitterness, milky mouthfeel, lactose added. I don't like this stout, too much sweetness and milky feel.","maxpower","Dec 01, 2002"
4.64,14.6,4,5,4.5,5,4.5,"This beer asserts itself immediately with an aroma which is attention-grabbing no matter how cold the beer. Chocolately with big whiffs of chocolate and a hint of cherries. Very liquer-like. The beer pours black with a dark tan head which dissipates almost immediately, leaving just thin wisps on the surface and a lace on the glass. The flavor is rich and starts off wonderfully grainy, rather like a Schwarz beer. As you'd expect from an ale though, this beer develops a much more robust presence in the mouth, very full bodied with a milky sweet main-palate followed by an ever-so slight hop bitterness. Aftertaste is roasty -- mellow and pleasant. Very well-balanced and extremely drinkable.","mzwolinski","Nov 18, 2002"
4,-1.2,4,4,4,3,4.5,"Beer is inky black with a nice brown head.  It recedes to a thin film withnin 30 seconds.  Provides adequate lacing however.  Bittersweet chocolate and roasted tones on the nose. Boy, you can sure taste the milk sugar in this one.  Definitely a sweet character in this one.  There are some subtle bittersweet chocolate tones also.   Roasted nut also comes to mind.  Body is too thin for a stout.  About medium.  Overall this is a nice tasting enjoyable stout......even if it is brewed in Ohio.","Bighuge","Oct 29, 2002"
4.12,1.7,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Mackeson Triple XXX Stout has a deep brown, in a sense almost black color.  It has a brown head that dissipates quickly.  Its nose is one of roasted coffee, and chocolate.  It has a nice sweet flavor, with notes of licorice, chocolate, and coffee.  This milk stout is sweet, malty and full-bodied, with low carbonation that still leaves a nice lace-work on the glass.

The body is thin-medium (much lighter than I remember), with a limited carbonation level and a silky mouthfeel. The flavor is more of sweet caramel and toffee than chocolate or roasted malts. The finish is clean and smooth with a lightly sweet, lingering caramel malt. Very one-sided, and much thinner than I remember. Still, very rich. Makes a nice dessert beer.","NeroFiddled","Sep 10, 2002"
4.63,14.3,4.5,4,5,5,4.5,"Pours practically black as night with a coffee colored head and generous lace. Espresso aroma. Wonderful creamy mouthfeel and taste.

4,-1.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours black but not as opaque or as dark as some. Surprisingly dark tan head. Smell is chocolate milk and burnt toast.

3.98,-1.7,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Black body and thick fuzzy tan head, settled quickly but still fell down the glass nicely. Heavy roasted malt, carmel, chocolate smells. Tasted just fine to me, lots of sweetness, creamy, and smooth. Noticable chocolate flavor on both the sweet and bitter side.  Not as silky smooth as say a guinness, but very drinkable. More bubbly and carbonated than I expected. Not as robust and balanced flavor wise as other stouts, but as a sweet stout, I thought it was really good. The fact that this is contract brewed in the U.S. doesn't matter to me. It's made in my hometown, which is cool with me.","StevieW","Jun 15, 2002"
4.23,4.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Very dark color and dark brown head as well, head of 1/2 inch but decreases pretty quickly.  Low carbonation.  Smell has a touch of blueberry to it.  Starts flavorful, light bodied and fruity sweet -- finishes thicker with a nice coffee and chocolate combination.  One of the better finishes in """beerdom", tasty.

Anyway certainly a serviceable stout, with molasses (not chocolate) and a burnt smoky undercurrent, plus what seems like a bunch of sugar dumped in and stirred around. Is that the result of the lactose? Mouthfeel thinnish and sugary, as if the corners of sugar crystals are slicing your tongue. I do like many things about this stout, including the strong (for the style) hop presence, and lingering finish. Super as a digestif, but for casual drinking it's just too sweet for me - surprising, considering how much I like sweet stouts.","Thrasher","May 29, 2002"
