Smells of sweet malt, roasted malt, oatmeal, chocolate, alcohol, hops, and slight yeast. Fits the style of a Milk / Sweet Stout. Mouth feel is sharp and clean, with an average carbonation level. There is also a noticeable bitterness from the roasted malts. Tastes of roasted malt, sweet malt, hops, hint of yeast, chocolate, hint of oatmeal, and a hint of alcohol. Overall, a complex beer, a little too much hops for my taste, but good chocolate flavors though.","Tone","Jul 13, 2014"

Pouring inky black and foreboding, this chocolate-rich aromatic beer is enticing but it's robust bitter malt flavor leans a little too bitter and harsh-finishing for my taste. I enjoy the complexities of Smoglifter's combination of styles, if you will, but in the end, there's a fine line I teeter on and the lack of sweetness throws me off from really getting into this beer.","BeerFMAndy","May 11, 2014"

4,0.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Pitch black body with a cream tan head, 10% heavy hitting imperial chocolate milk stout. Off the bat the head doesn't stick around very long speckled lacing follows suit. Aromatics, deep dark chocolate, notes of soy sauce, creamy lactose notes, and again big dark chocolate additions the gangs all here folks. As it warms up I'm getting dark fruit notes within the chocolate/milk chocolate notes. Flavor coats the palate with dark chocolate syrup, cream textures of lactic yogurt notes, earthy nutty notes from the cocoa additions...a really great beer as a whole. It gets a bit cloying sweet be sure to share with fellow beergeeks four to eight ounces is enough for me, 22 ounces is unbearable. Mouthfeel mellows out a bit just a touch of booze notes going on, with full bodied malts. Even flowing carbonation going on down through each sip. Overall, it's a nice beer big chocolate malts enough sweetness to induce diabetes disperse this amongst friends.","WVbeergeek","May 06, 2014"

Pours dense pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense dark brown head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big cream, milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toffee, fudge, vanilla, light coffee, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with nice complexity of sweet chocolate/roasted malt notes; with great strength and no booziness. Taste of cream, milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toffee, vanilla, toast, light char, and roasted earthiness. Light roasted coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of cream, milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, vanilla, light char, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and cocoa flavors; with big robustness and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and slightly chalky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent imperial milk stout. All around great balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, cream, and cocoa flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 11, 2014"

4,0.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall I thought this was a pretty good beer and I thought it was a very good example of an Imperial Milk Stout which is what Brash claims it is on the label, it's very similar to a well done Milk Stout, but all the expects are bigger then they would normally be and I think they did a good job of showing what an Imperial Milk Stout is all about. This beer had nice drinkability it was fairly smooth, creamy, a little rich, a little filling and the taste did a good job at holding my attention, a full bomber might be a little too much for me, so I think half the bottle is the perfect amount and it made for a good beer to enjoy on a cold winter night. What I liked the most about this beer was how all the aspects of this beer were kicked up to make it pretty fitting as an Imperial Milk Stout. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there wasn't anything that I disliked or would change, it's good just the way it is. I would buy this beer again when looking for an Imperial Milk Stout, my buddy said it was a little pricey, so I don't think I would get it often. I would recommend this to anyone who likes Milk Stouts or big stouts in general, it seems to fit pretty well in those categories and I think the alcohol is hidden well. All in all I was a little impressed with this beer and it made for a pretty good first impression for Brash Brewing Company, it was just what I wanted and would expect out of a good Imperial Milk Stout and I thought it delivered in all aspects with no weak points. This may be the best Imperial Milk Stout I have had. Great job guys, you can be sure that I will keep an eye out for more of your beers.","StoutHunter","Beers"

Tasty looking brew that pours rich and smooth. Aromas of coffee and bittersweet baker's chocolate, with some hints of booze and earthy highlights. Flavors are rich, roasted, and super smooth. Wow. Bittersweet chocolate, with a creamy backbone, balancing both rich sweetness and bitter notes. Very tasty and very drinkable, doing a good job to blend robust flavors with a kick of booze. The beer is smooth, creamy, and rich in mouth, with a hint of bitterness at the end of the palate, drying slightly.

Smell is sweet and strong at the same time. Mouthfeel is clean and smooth, the lactose comes thru in a welcome, inviting way, makes me want to drink more. Taste is on point, you know you're drinking a big bad high alcohol beer, but semi sweet chocolate, sugar and roasted malts still come through and they smooth out the initial harshness. Overall very well done and something i would pick up again","jkeefe1800","May 31, 2013"

4.71,18.6,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.75,"Poured into a glass mug. The beer pours black with a thin, brown head with some visible carbonation from the side of the glass. The aroma is of milk chocolate and malt with some sweetness in the aroma. The breadiness and roastiness of the malt is more forward in the flavor than it is in the aroma. It blends well with the milk chocolate in the flavor. There's some nice sweetness and some alcohol comes through in the flavor, but it's not overwhelmingly boozy. The body is full with moderate carbonation. The finish leaves a nice roasty aftertaste in the mouth that doesn't linger too long, but it aids the drinkability of this big beer. This is an excellent beer.","acevenom","May 15, 2013"

4.12,3.8,4.5,4.25,4,3.75,4.25,"T: Thick, chewy and loaded with dark flavor. Lots of roasted malt upfront laced with bitter chocolate flavor. There's a hint of sweetness here and there, but it seems to be held back by a lot of roasted bitterness. Some anise and charred wood before a finish of cinnamon and more roasted malt. Mouthfeel is thick and slightly creamy, but I would definitely like a bit more creaminess from a chocolate milk stout. Still, this is good stuff.","notchucknorris","Apr 06, 2013"

This was easily one of the best Milk stouts I ever had. TJ's listed it as an Imperial Milk Chocolate stout. I tend to let this style warm up, but even cold out of the tap, this demonstrated a fine palate pleasing profile.","jimbomill","Mar 31, 2013"
3.77,-5,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Poured a blackish body with decent head that died quick with no lace. Again, a decent but not spectacular aspect of the beer is the aroma, as I pick up hints of roasted malts but not much else in the malts or anything really in the hops department. Beer is smooth, slightly creamy, but unfortunately offbalance for a sweet stout (or any stout, really) in my opinion. I don't know whether it is the alcohol or the strong presence of roasted, even possibly some toasted or coffee malt, maybe toffee, but the bitter chocolate and caramel sugary sweetness is overpowered by a dry, harsh malt tasting sensation and there really isn't much hoppiness to balance or give off that rare fruit flavor. The beer is balanced enough to avoid being sticky, cloying or in this brew's case just too dry and a taste bud killer so I can't say it's that bad and I did enjoy it as a sipper. Just wish they could mellow out the beer a little to let the sweetness come through and then it would be a great beer.","clayrock81","Mar 30, 2013"
3.94,-0.8,3,4,4,4,4,"This poured poured a rich syrupy black color with a thin brown head on top. The retention fades quickly and there is no lacing. The smell of the beer had deep roasted aroma with a good amount of molasses on the nose. The taste is chocolatey, it's rich with dark malts and cocoa. The mouthfeel is thick with a light carbonation. It's creamy and oily. Overall this beer is pretty good, it's not the prettiest looking beer but all and all it's a tasty brew.","Knapp85","Beers"
3.99,0.5,3,4,4,4,4.25,"O: Well, the label describes this as an imperial chocolate milk stout. That's exactly what it is. Pretty one-note, lots of chocolate flavors from start to finish. That doesn't make it bad, in fact it's quite enjoyable. It reminds me a lot of Southern Tier Choklat. Pure chocolate with lots of sweetness. This isn't QUITE so sweet, it actually has a little bitter cocoa aspect but it's close. At the same time, it just doesn't hold up quite the same. Maybe not quite as rich? Mouthfeel seems a little thin compared too. I didn't mean for this to be a comparison element, but if you've ever had Choklat you will understand what I mean.","Dope","0"
