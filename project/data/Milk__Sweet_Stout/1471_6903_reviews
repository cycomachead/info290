"Great roasted, malted aroma. However, it is overly roasted and bitter in flavor. It's not creamy or milky at all. Somewhat disappointed in the overall product."

"Pours thick and rich. A very dark 1-finger head quickly falls. There's a viscous coating on the glass as it's tipped. The aroma is big and enveloping; full of deep fruity smells. The beers taste is what one might expect of a sip of dessert wine, with dry, burnt-coffee notes on the back end. This is a big stout, and I imagine it would be hard to distinguish from many imperials; quite an accomplishment for a 7.5% libation. Mouthfeel lives up to the name."

"Pours a nice light creamy brown head with decent lacing. Smell is chocolate malt, malted milk, roast marshmallows. Taste is subtle chocolate milk, nice smoke presence, with darker chocolate residuals. Overall a very nice stout that is easy to drink."
""
""
""
"Smoky flavor that dominates. Only gets to the typical milk stout sweet creaminess on the finish. But too smoky for my taste."
"The name says it all--too cream. A great stout"
""
""
"Overall, this is an ultra-smooth and drinkable, roasty stout.  One of the more sessionable stouts I’ve come across."
"12oz bottle poured into nonic. This beer is opaque black with a quarter inch of light brown head that settles to a thin ring. Minimal lacing. The aroma is carried by roasted malts and coffee, plus creamy lactose sugar and a hint of milk chocolate. It has a subdued vanilla cream sweetness that rolls in after a strong wave of coffee, molasses, and roasted malt bitterness. Medium-light body and a thin mouthfeel that are disappointing; soft carbonation and a long roasty finish that are quite nice."
"Coffee t t t t"

"Pours darker than I expected, deep dark chocolate color. Almost no head, stronger chocolate in the nose than I anticipated, but not a truly strong chocolate smell. Taste is of chocolate that is slightly sweet, with some maltiness in the background. Reminds me of Boulder Beers' Shake, only this is it's older more intense brother. Imperial Stoutish without the coffee nor the higher alcohol. I could drink a number of these very easily. I will buy again and suggest those who haven't tried it, to seek it out."

"Pours a nice deep black with no light getting through. There's a nice dark brown head that comes with it and settles down quickly, leaving some oily lacing. The aroma is big rich malt, with hints of chocolate and coffee. The taste is a little light, missing the big rich flavors of the aroma but does have a nice light hops finish. The body is also a little light, even for a milk stout, but it has almost no carbonation, so it's got that going for it."
"Very solid brew from these guys"

"Was expecting something a little more in the ""sweet"" sense, but instead this stout has a very distinct smokey oak taste to it.  The aroma isn't as pleasant as I would have liked and very lingering smokey aftertaste.  Not one of my favorites and I like most stouts.  If you are fan of the very earthy oak and smoked flavors you would like, but I've had much better stouts."

"Flavor: Excellent sweet/bitter balance, with the light sweetness overcome by mild bitterness by the finish. Lingering dark roasted malts and black coffee in the aftertaste.  A hint of dark chocolate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is smooth — charred malts and dark fruit duking it out on the palate for dominance. Finishes with more of the bittersweet malts and a hint of alcohol warmth. This is a delicious and smooth stout that approaches some Russian Imperial Stouts, even. Superb."

"Not too heavy on the lactose for a milk stout, but it is sweet - the roast is mild.  Overall, it's a rich, robust, complex, very enjoyable stout."

"This was visually stunning coming out of the bottle and into my glass! It looked like high viscosity engine oil, 40-weight, as it did its pseudo-cascade and then formed a finger of dense, deep-brown head with excellent retention. Color was a deep, dark-brown (SRM = 44) allowing zero light penetration. THIS is their interpretation of a Cream Stout?!? Nose was rich and chocolaty, more towards dark chocolate with a charcoal smokiness. Mouthfeel was big, full and creamy and the taste was incredibly smoky, which while appealing to me, is stylistically incorrect. Why would they make Fore and this? I left a bit in the bottle so as to be able to stir up the lees for an additional pour, but it really did not change things by much, except to intensify the smokiness, if that is possible. Finish was bitter, smoky, dry, all of which adds up to something other than a Milk/Sweet Stout. I am not a style maven, by any stretch, but this was a wolf in sheep's clothing."

"O- I wish this beer had more elements of the aroma in the flavor as it smells wonderful but the taste leaves a bit to be desired. Still it's drinkable enough and there's nothing necessarily wrong with it. Just feel like it could be so much better."
""
""
""
"O: Based on the Appearance and Nose I expected big things. The taste was way off the nose - and not really in a good way. I am desperately sipping and hoping for hints of chocolate and more coffee - but I am just getting smoke. There are other stouts in this series from Dark Horse - I have them and will try them. I *think* there is one that is a smoked porter - I can't imagine something smokier than this!"

"Dark Horse Too Cream Stout ---3.5/5"
""
""
""
""
""
"Of the ""numbers stouts"" in this series that I've had (all but Fore), this ranks #3, behind Tres Blueberry and Plead the 5th, and slightly better than One Oatmeal."
""

""
""
"Not overly bitter or roasty, with a great chocolate presence. The tinge of tartness adds complexity to break the monotony of the chocolate. Very rich malt character."
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottled. Pours pitch black with an average sized, creamy head. Aroma of slightly roasted malt and note of chocolate, light coffee and vanilla. Sweet flavor that ends up quite dry with notes of malt bitterness. Medium bodied, oily to creamy texture and soft carbonation. An excellent stout."

"Overall its a very enjoyable beer that is perfect for the winter months. Big roasty quality will leave you wanting to sip this one all night."
"Quick Edit: I recommend getting the sediment in the bottle, as it thickens up the brew considerably and really pushes it over the top. After doing that, it turned a very good beer into a great one. You gotta get that all in the bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's thick and rich with a moderate viscosity that gives great body and smoothness without sitting like a brick. There's just the slightest crispness, enough to keep it lively and interesting, and the smoothness pulls even into the roasty finish."

"Overall, a great stout, I like them dark and roasty and this one delivers."
""
""
""
"One of the blackest pours i've seen, viscous and thick. Bubbly dark brown body with average retention. Wisps of creamy coffee fill the air as well as dark chocolate and some bitter-sweet variety as well. Strong oatmeal taste, chocolate upfront transforms into smooth, creamy coffee. Medium bodied and overall a nice stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Really loved the look and aroma that this one brought, but was very disappointed once I began to drink it. Chocolate flavors are off, dairy tones are oddly sweet and bitter."
"You can't go wrong with this beer. Perfect for smoking a pipe and reading Turgenev while feeling like a boss, dark, thick head when I poured it into a glass, and the taste was incredible. Chocolates but not overpowering. You could smell the creaminess quite liberally, if that makes sense. Heartily recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A big improvement over One Oatmeal; a nice representative of the cream stout style. But's almost too sweet for my liking."
"Overall, the incredible mouthfeel, especially for a non-imperial stout, elevates this already delicious brew to a level beyond that of an ordinary stout. Bell's Double Cream was quite tasty but this one leaves it in the dust, and is much easier to find to boot. Awesome beer at a bargain price to boot!!"

"really good beer if not the creamiest of the style."
""
""
""

"Solid stout offering, I prefer One Oatmeal to this. It's missing something in the middle, perhaps some lactose sweetness of which I did not get, and its a bit watery. If the Cream aspect was talking about lactose, I did not get much of it. If it was referring to a Cream mouthfeel, it's halfway there but it is not anything like Bell's Double Cream Stout. An interesting stout to try, but I won't be getting this one again."
""
""
""
"12oz bottle. Pours a pitch black color with a cinnamon colored head. The head dissipates quickly and there is minimal lacing. The nose is roasty with hints of chocolate, coffee, and cream. The taste is mostly roasted malt with chocolate and coffee flavors being the most dominant. There is a subdued sweetness and a lingering hop bitterness that I did not expect. The mouthfeel is smooth and this is quite drinkable for the style. Overall I like this beer but I expected it to be a good bit sweeter."

"Bottle picked up recently in Michigan. Pours a silky, oily black with a coffee coloured head that disappears more quickly than I expected given its visual density. Beautiful aroma of both dark and milk chocolate plus roasted dark and chocolate malts. The whole chocolate spectrum, with vanilla and coffee tones lightly riding on the malts. The lactose and silky sweetness in more pronounced in the flavour, which is very suitable for the style but might be challenging to enjoy more than one in a sitting. Nice coffee and hop bitterness to the finish which has a pleasing bite and stops it from becoming cloying."

"Beer is medium bodied with medium-low levels of carbonation, which results in a maintains a gentle foaminess, substantial smoothness, moderate heaviness, and velvety creaminess, providing an excellent mouthfeel. Generally close to, but a bit lighter than Dark Horse's oatmeal stout. Closes dry, with mild stickiness on the palate and mild astringency from the roasted malts."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: My favorite milk stout to date. A really excellent, smooth, chocolate taste combined with the sweetness and slight metallic puckering of the lactose. I was surprised that I liked this one so much ... would definitely drink it again!"
""
""
"Overall, a very solid sweet/milk stout, great mix of chocolate, espresso and roast to create a wonderful tasting and smelling brew."
""
""
"This is where the tannin makes a slight appearance, you can feel its mild character. A creaminess is present, but challenged by a tingle that doesn't let your mouth get too relaxed while enjoying it."

"Beautiful job Dark Horse!"
""
""

"Above average stout, good flavor and body at a not-too-high abv, definitely worth having. Hadn't had a good stout in a while, this hit the spot."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours dark as expected with a minimal bronze head. The smell is very bitter with a kind of tin nose as well. Much like the smell the taste is extremely bitter chocolate. This is not for me but if you are a bitter chocolate fan than you will definitely like this. The upfront taste is not bad but really the downfall of this beer is the aftertaste. Very bitter and leaves a faint harsh taste on the tongue. I don't find this creamy or a milk stout. if there was a bitter stout category this would be a prefect fit. Would not buy this again."
""
""
""
"Pours dark with a tan head. Smells of burnt chocolate. Tastes like bitter chocolate. The mouthfeel is creamy, silky smooth. Overall, a decent beer for the style. If you like your cream stout bitter this is for you. I like it and would drink it again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I would have this higher than a 4, but the taste is way too close to a RIS to really rank it super high in this style. I really enjoyed the beer, just doesn't quite fit as a cream stout to me. That being said, I will purchase more of this and enjoy every drop!"
""
""
""
"O: A good Sweet Stout, however I did like Samuel Smiths Organic Chocolate Stout a bit better. I was getting more bitter than sweet in this beer. A solid stout that I would have again but would seek out..."
""
"O: While it definitely comes off like a cream stout, there are many times drinking this where I think it might be an imperial stout, and a rock-solid one at that. Certainly it's much better than their One oatmeal stout."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'd try this one again at some point, but I wouldn't seek it out. Looking forward to trying all of their other entries."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a thick black with a finger of dark brown head that fades pretty quickly. Creamy mocha coffee nose. Dark chocolate and cocoa powder flavors that mingle with bitter prune and mildy acidic coffee notes as it warms. Hints of licorice and smooth espresso on the dry-ish finish."
""
""
""
"O-Needed more chocolate and vanilla for a Milk stout, the creamy mouthfeel was nice though."
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 11/1/2012. Pours dense pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense very dark brown head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of of huge dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, char, coffee, cream, toffee, smoke, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with nice complexity and balance of big roasted flavors with moderate cream sweetness. Taste of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa, coffee, light char, cream, toffee, light smoke, and roasted earthiness. Light coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, light char, cream, toffee, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark roasted flavors with moderate cream sweetness; with zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice cream stout. Very well balanced with extremely robust roasted flavors and moderate sweetness; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."
""
"O - Meh...This one didn't wow me by any means, not sweet enough. There are many other better examples of the style out there. I enjoy a lot of Dark Horse beers, just not this one."
""
"This is my first review and I felt it had to be for this cream stout because this one was very disappointing. I rarely ever drainpour anything but this one lasted just enough sips to review. Very light body for a cream stout and not nearly sweet enough, the bitterness of the roasted malts and hops drowned out the sweetness a cream stout should have. The smell was present but not strong enough at first smell. Not well done, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who likes milk/sweet/cream stouts."
""
"Pours a very dark, opaque noir with a thin ring of a head, reminiscent of espresso. It's lightly carbonated and there is a small amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma consists mostly of coffee notes, with sweet cream, oatmeal, and a hint of chocolate. The flavor opens very sweetly of vanilla and creme, but gives way to some bitter hops, light tobacco, and bread crust. The finish has very 'charred,' ashy, and burnt characteristics to it. For the mouth feel, it's very light... the ABV is felt slightly on the way down. Pleasant, but the appearance (head) and finish could use some improvement."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, an acceptable cream stout, though a bit thin and not quite sweet enough to suit my palate. Not one I would suggest seeking out, but definitely worth trying if it's sold in your area. A quality brew."
"Two Words: Sour Milk"
"Overall, this is a very good Milk Stout, featuring a very powerful arrangement of finely assorted flavors that will be sure to please fans of the style. The ashy/coffee notes are perhaps a bit too strong here, the sugars not quite able to keep up, and the beer could have used a bit more ABV to add a greater vanilla-bourbon overtone, as well as a little less carbonation. But even without those changes, this is quite drinkable, and very delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Decent, mild and very easy to drink. Balance is good, usually milk stouts are so sweet, this one is more mild and malty. Worth a drink but nothing spectacular."
""
""
""
"Not digging this as I have a sweet tooth and the label does say 'too cream""-not feeling it. Gave it a shot though and I feel I'm a bit generous with the points here.. I guess if you are looking for a less sweet cream stout-this ones for you. It's ok, not great....meh...."
""
""
"O - Overall, Straight forward and to the point. Not a whole lot to say about this one. It's a solid stout, But nothing fantastic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours pitch black with a brown head. Smells of huge roasted coffee and chocolate. Flavor has more bitter bite than I expected up front, but finishes sweet an chocolatey. A bit of prickly carbonation for the style that takes away from its creaminess, but doesn't interfere with the flavor too much. Solid brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Notes: Overall this is quite tasty and drinkable with a nice smooth finish. Cheers."
" Rich, dark coffee hits your tongue as slide down bitter, while taking all your saliva with it. Upon swallowing, the strange odor attacks. Rich, heavy stout."
"This ale's greatest asset is the aftertaste. It lingers nicely with that cream/hops/sweetness. It works nicely. It is not surprising that a great brewery like Dark Horse gets their milk stout right!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a very solid stout. I like sweet stouts a lot, and this one is good. Not quite as sweet as I expected, but pretty well balanced. The head is simply the best I’ve ever seen on a beer. It is still a solid layer of foam on top, so much so that it looks like it’s been nitro poured."
"Pours a black color. 5/4 inch head of a tan color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells of roasted malt, sweet malt, slight alcohol, oatmeal, and slight hop. Fits the style of a Milk/Sweet Stout. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of roasted malt, sweet malt, slight oatmeal, hint of hops, and a hint of coffee. Overall, good appearance, aroma, body, and blend."
"Pours an impressively dark black color with a solid brown head that rapidly dwindles to a slim ring around the edge. The nose is all warm, toasty, roasty malts...bittersweet chocolate, caramelized sugar, coffee, and molasses. Roasted malt flavor with a bit more sweetness, some vanilla bean, and lingering charred wood. A little bread and even a trace of hops far in the back as well. Medium bodied, perhaps a little too much texture and not enough creamy smoothness. Man, I've been enjoying this ""holiday stout series"" so far. I'm hoping the Tres in my fridge continues the trend."
"O: Solid Stout with some good flavors. Accurate for the style and an enjoyable bottle to drink. Would I seek it out again? Depends what else is available."
"O: This beer has a great balance between the flavors of sweet lactose and roasted malts. It's also rather easy to drink because the alcohol is well hidden from the taste."
""
"O: Good stuff."
""
""
"O - If this beer had a bigger body I would be in love, however I will stick with Bell's cream stout as my go-to for this area. I prefer a creamier, fuller body with such flavors."
"Dark brown/black with a mocha head, dense retention and some sheets of lace. Nose has roast, some mocha character, cocoa and some creamy coffee underneath. Taste has a whole load of roast, some balancing creamy sweetness, vanilla and brown sugar in some regards and dark chocolate. Full body, alcohol wasn't perceptible. A nice cream/milk stout, but didn't stand out as exceptional. Very nice nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is an incredibly full beer that's sharp, rough, and exhibits overall burnt character- far greater than the lactose additions can balance."
"Wasn't expecting much from this but it's pretty damn good. The smoked flavors in the middle are subtle, but add a whole other element to the brew, other than just being a generic milk stout. Very tasty."
""
""
"O- This was a nice stout, however I definitely wouldn't say it's my favorite milk stout. There definitely wasn't as much of a milk or creamy flavor as I was expecting. I was also a little bit surprised at the faint smokiness that I encountered (this definitely wasn't the smoked stout though). Overall I really enjoyed drinking this however it isn't as sweet as your typical milk stout and definitely doesn't compare to other top-notch milk stouts such as the Three Hour Tour that I had last week. I recommend trying this out especially if you like bitter chocolate and stouts that aren't overly sweet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Great beer. One of my favorite winter stouts (Along with the other dark horse specialties). However I find that some of my bottles of this beer taste a lot better and more ""cream stout"" than others."
""
""
"O- Very easy drinking. No hint at all of the alcohol. Really nice blend of bitter and sweet. Really wish I could get this in NY."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall. A very nice stout! Not sweet and creamy feeling like many milk stouts, but a nice stout all the same."
""
""
""
"EDIT: As an afterthought, I reckon this would really benefit from aging - going to cellar a couple of these."
"O: a solid beer overall, though I'd like it to be a bit sweeter with a bit more depth."
""
""
"This beer gets much better with age. My buddy gave me a four pack over a year ago and when I tried it it was just ok. I left one of the beers in the fridge and forgot about it. I just found it tonight and tried it .... Fantastic! It is deceptively bitter when I was expecting a milk stout. Strong hints of tobacco and toasted chocolate."
""
"Overall - This is the first milk stout I've ever tried. I'm giving it a good rating because I know that it's good for it's style. I just personally hate coffee lol. But everything else is great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"For a style I don't particularly care for, this one is fantastic."
""
""
""
"My second favorite of the five-part Dark Horse stout series. I loved this and that's saying something from someone who isn't a big fan of cream stouts. Here ye, here ye! 4.0"
""
"Bitter malts take over in the finish, but sweet caramel and toffee notes sweep in to save things. Finishes very nicely, and is definitely the highlight of the beer."
""
"O: Lacks the depth and character of some of the other stouts that Dark Horse brews. It feels a little generic. Very easy to drink though, you wouldn't guess that it's 8% abv. Not a bad buy, especially given the relatively limited selection of milk stouts on the market."
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium in body and a little bitter from the grain on the finish. It is a pretty good beer but not as creamy or as sweet as I expect a milk stout to be. The body is big so I'm not going to mistake this for an FES but I don't quite get milk stout. I like these Dark Horse beers though and I'd have this one again."
""
""
"Overall: I'm not sure if I would go out of my way to buy it again, but it's pretty decent. Worth a try."
""
""
"M. Medium body, light carbonation. That little smidgeon of chalkiness that appears in the finish comes across as slightly awkward when in a Cream Stout... Not quite as 'creamy' in texture as most cream stouts that I've had."
""
""
""
"Quite good and a different take on milk/sweet stouts that I anticipated but should have expected."
""
"Nice roasted flavors in this stout, but heavy on the coffee flavor, which I'm not that into. Excited to try their blueberry stout next."
"If you can’t get it on tap, do yourself a favor and pour your bottle into a nice pint glass of some kind and admire the beautiful java head and enjoy immensely."
""
""
""
"The flavor mimics the smell except that there is more burnt malt taste to it. The body is creamy, but not too sweet like most Cream Stouts. The aftertaste is slightly nutty with a linger coffee ground taste."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very nice addition to the four part series. Can't wait to try out tres next. Dark Horse has yet to dissapoint me with this series."
"Overall: Really solid brew. My first Dark Horse and I really enjoyed it. The taste evolution is great. The aftertaste is fantastic. This is one of those beers that has notes of flavors that you've had before, but is just executed and put together much better than before. I really enjoyed this beer."
"A good milk stout. Solid all the way through, with nothing spectacular, but no real faults either. Definitely on the charred/roasty side, and lower on the sweetness than many milk stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not my favorite of the DH stout series, but still a good one overall."
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Very dark, opaque brown/black in color with a nice inch of foam. Head disappeared after a few minutes. Smell of very roasted malts with the hint of coffee and cocoa. Taste the nice java flavor with just a bit of bitternes to finish. Very smooth and drinkable beer."
""
"C+ to B-"
""
"Overall - I enjoyed One more, but this isn't bad for a milk stout. I try not to hold my opinion of lactose additions against these beers, and this one at least gave me a decent stout behind it."
""
"Hard to get, but seems to be reasonably priced and very accessible in other states. I paired the beer with some Tuscany grilled ham and sharp provolone, which seems to have worked well. I'd recommend the beer to others and I'm glad I received it as an unexpected extra"
"O-i'm pretty impressed with this stout. its solid tasting yet its super smooth and really drinkable, even dangerously drinkable. i would say this borderlines the taste of an american imperial stout...it has the flavor profile. i recommend this and will get this again if i see it."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is very similar to One Oatmeal Stout with a little more malt character. It lacks the sweetness for the style, but makes up for it with a solid malt presence. Well-crafted and creamy."
"Overall: A good big blast of dark roasted malts and lots of complex flavors. A sipping beer, and one is enough, so not really for sessions...but a good one if you just want one big dark malted brew. I would drink one of these again if I'm in the mood for the style."
"O: Nice milk/sweet stout. Good flavors, with an interesting hop presence. A bit of alcohol gives a nice warmth. Solid finish and something I would definitely have again."
""
""
"Overall, this is a real solid entry from Dark Horse. Lots of flavor for the palate, and extremely drinkable. The lack of any milkiness in the taste detracts from its overall rating, for me, as that extra milkiness would have made this one stand out, rather than seeming like another imp. stout, albeit an above average imperial."
""

"A good drinking beer with a bold, smooth and sweet taste."
"O- another very good stout from dark horse!"

"3.5 D: Decent, but nothing to write home about."
""
""
""
"O - love the aftertaste. My favorite part. Pretty good other than that though."
"Not a big fan of this one. The smoke flavor overwhelms a bit and the good creaminess of the milk stout is missing."
""
""
""
"Overall, I like this beer. It's maybe a bit strong for a milk stout but the flavors are pretty great. It's nicely balanced, not too malty and sweet and not too roasted and bitter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It's quite good- Super creamy and decadent. I'll have to try baking with this someday."
""

"o - overall, this one has some time on it as i received it a while back and it tastes pretty fantastic still...seems more RIS to me than milk stout. either way, another fine beer from dark horse. this brewery continues to impress me. word on the street is that they will be hitting NY soon so fingers crossed and can't wait."

"Overall, this is a nice beer with a surprising amount of flavor. The lactic qualities keep it from drinking more than 1-2 at a time, but good to go back to again, especially at a low price."
"Similar to One and Plead the Fifth, very good, not quite elite, but absolutely worth having and a pretty good value."
""
"Looks dark, black. Dark brown head, with good residual lacing left on glass. Roasted chocolate malt aroma. Hints of coffee mixed in. Sweet smell. Taste is very good. Sweet stout flavors. Chocolate and coffee, with roasted malts in the background. Chocolate comes through nicely with a touch of bitterness at the end. Creamy mouthfeel. Full body, moderate carbonation. Very good drink. Just like a milk stout should be. Not to overdone on the flavors, just right. I'll think I will get another!"
""
"o: pretty good cream stout, will buy these when i cant find bell's special double cream this winter. i know it's a milk stout but i wish it had a thicker body to it."
"O: This is, again, a good beer from Dark Horse. However, it has it's flaws. The bitterness in the finish is too high for a milk stout. and the lacto lingers for far too long after."
""
""
""
"O: It seems to be lacking something.... but not sure what."
""

"O: I thought this beer was great, would recommend it. It was a great take on the milk stout. I also thought it was much better then Dark Horse's One."

"Big thanks goes out to my boy aasher for this one! Second in the series and second on the day! Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured pitch black with a minimal light tan head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark chocolate, subtle roasted malt, and slight cream. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, cream, subtle coffee, and subtle smoke. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. The aroma on this one really didn't get me excited about this one very much. However, the flavor proved to be quite nice and complex. I really like the smoke aspect I picked up on as it was definitely a first I have gotten in this style. A well done brew, but could use a few tweeks to be excellent."
"Overall: Excellent aroma and decent flavor, although the sweetness was just a bit one-dimensional at times. Also, the sting from the CO2 detracted from the perception of creaminess in the beer. I think a side-by-side w/ Bell's Double Cream would highlight this fact. Overall, definitely one to try, but not an ""A" level beer in my opinion."
"O - There wasn't anything in this beer that really stood out and made me say wow...it's just another typical stout that has more roast flavors that sweet flavors"
"Overall pretty good for the style. I would drink more if they were available."
"O: Like the other two, I'd revisit this on tap but given my experiences tonight with shipped milk-stouts, I'll wait only until then. If this isn't at least 3x better damned fresh, then it's hard to not say it's a shame."
"Poured this brew into a Cheers Dimpled mug, not really sure why but I liked the way it looked. The beer is very black in color, solid bubbling brown colored head on top. The lacing is nice on this brew. The smell of the beer has a lot of roasted burnt aromas coming off of it along with some lactose sourness on the nose. The taste of this really does have a creamy flavor upfront and in the back it dries out into a bitter burnt toast flavor. The mouthfeel is a pretty thick which I found nice. Overall it's a pretty good tasting stout."
"D - A very solid, very respectable offering from Dark Horse, though probably my least favorite to date from their Stout series... Good bones, but a bit rough around the edges... Not sure I would have pegged this as a milk stout as the roasted malt is really the dominate player... Also not sure that the nitro-pour didn't anything special for this offering..."
"Poured into a Dogfish head snifter. Poured on the thinner side with a one finger quickly diminishing head. Decent nose of roasted malts, bit of choc and coffee. Enjoyed my beer but felt it was a little bit overly roasted, alcohol was well hidden. This drinks like a coffee my girlfriend makes me w/o instructions = a kinda acidic, lightly sweet, thin and weak coffee. Graded on a harder scale than most, I would give it a C+."
"This beer pours like a big, dark, thick stout. There is a very dark brown head, but it dissipates very quickly. Nice, but would be much better with a bit more of a lasting head. Very nice aroma. Roasty, chocolaty, and mildly sweet. Very smooth and The taste is a bit of a letdown after the great aroma. More of an acidic roastyness which overwhelms any chocolate that is present in the aroma. Also a bit of coffee flavor which is a nice addition. Not a ton of sweetness either, which is surprising for an 8% milk stout. Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side with a good amount of carbonation. Very nice beer, a very good offering by dark horse."
" The flavor of Too is very pleasant it seems to combine the sweetness and caramel maltiness with some mild roasted and toast tastes. The flavor of the malt never seems to get cloying and the beer reminds me of sweetened coffee with some silky and creamy tinges that make the bitterness and alcohol levels seem very tame. I like how the mild burnt sugar taste lingers in the backrground adding complexity to the sweet and caramel taste. The beer finishes as it starts semi-dry and fresh. I feel this is a great example of the style -a pretty tasty stout in general, not overly sweet and has nice flavor overall. This is highly drinkable and I recommend trying it if you have the chance."
"O: A bit of a sipper, and in small doses. Not sure what season this comes, but if its fresh, it seems a bit muddled. Good, but the dryness is off putting. So far, not my favorite from dark horse, but glad I got to try it."
"I love this beer, exceptional aroma and taste. Will be on the lookout for more. Shame this is a seasonal release. The best I have had from this great brewery"
"Overall this is quite lackluster compared to many sweet stouts and average if I was going to classify it as a coffee stout. The lactose/creamy mouthfeel and flavors are over-powered by the acrid/roasted malts. Honestly had trouble finishing a 12 oz serving..."
"Overall, a really enjoyable and drinkable milk stout with a nice balanced flavor profile. It's not outstanding, but it certainly is easy to drink. Definitely enjoyed my glass immensely."
"O - Awesome label, and even more awesome brew! Great brew, right on style. The best Milk Stout I've ever had, hands down. I really wish Dark Horse could be found in CO. Thanks AndyAvalance for a killer ship."
"i looked back at what the alcohol level was and was surprised to see it stood at 8%! the alcohol is not noticable at all considering it's approaching imperial stout status. be careful with this one, it's so tasty and apparently high on alcohol, you may end up drunken and disheveled before you know what hit you."
"Skal"
"Poured dark brown to black with a tannish head that lingered pretty well. Coffee and a bit of chocolate in the nose. Taste of roasted coffee and roasty malts, and some semi-sweet chocolate. Heavy-medium mouthfeel, not too strong or thick. Pleasant and drinkable."
"O: Not much cream other than a hint on the nose for being billed as a cream stout, but I enjoyed this quite a bit."
"Bleh."
"D-Overall i wasn't overly impressed with this beer. I love milk stouts but i felt this one was alittle off. Def. drinkable but not that enjoyable. Dark horse makes alot of good beers but this one is just ok in my book"
"Overall –A good beer and I’m sure the age has helped it – I taste no alcohol nor have any warming. A good night cap. Glad I was able to try it."
"This isn't too heavy for a milk stout. Not bad to sip on during a lazy early spring sunday!"
"A finely balanced stout, but closer to an imperial stout than I prefer. Right now, I'm digging some nitro milk stout from Left Hand."
"If you like Sam Adams Cream Stout I would highly recommend this beer!"
"Concluding thoughts: Good cream stout. Alot different than I had anticipated. Really Drinkable for an 8% ABV."
"I would buy this again. Wish it had more head but I'd still buy it again."
"The beer ours a deep black color with a small espresso swirl head. The aroma is big and pungent with some burnt toast and coffee malt character. The flavor follows with a big creamy flavor with some bitter coffee and dark chocolate. In no way is it overly sweet, but the lactose lends a nice complimentary flavor. Palate is big and creamy, wonderful stout."
"I like it better than ""One"" in the series."
"D - I loved this beer at first. Then the aftertaste of burnt popcorn kicked in. That dominated the flavor about half way through the beer. It's a shame because I really enjoyed the first half."
"I finished a pint without a problem, but something I will probably not be coming back to. Nothing bad, but there are plenty of other stouts I will drink before this."
"D- the only thing holding This beer back is the carbonation. Good taste and great smell. A good stout"
"D- Yes, this beer is extremely drinkable. I am a huge milk stout fan and this does not dissapoint. A bit more roasty and full flavored than a lot of others I have had, and thats a great thing! I look forward to getting my hands on the other 4 of the stouts from Dark Horse in this series, especially if they are half as good as Too..."
"smell was roasted malts, earthy dampness and some mild chocolate. the smell really isn't all that appealing. some mild hops lingering in there somewhere. The taste was hoppy, malty and had some unique sweetness. the roasted malts were very prevalent as well. slightly weird. mouthfeel was crisp and clean yet had a creamy milkiness to it. it ends with a malty roasted chocolate aftertaste with a slight amount of bitterness."
"D - Easy going down. Fantastic roasty flavors. Wonder how this would taste on nitro...."
"Pours a solid black color, even a vigorous pour could not coax much of the tan head out of hiding. Smells of roasted malts, huge amounts of coffee and ash on the nose. Sweet lactose burnt sugar, dark caramel in there as well. Taste is what I expected. Hugely roasted malts with burnt coffee, ash, and a lactose sweetness that barely balances any of the roast. Wow this is the most ""burnt"" brew I think I've ever tasted. Reminds me of that coffee pot that got left on the burner empty for too long. Smooth creamy mouthfeel, thick body, light level of carbonation. Kudos to Dark Horse for pushing the burnt boundary. This one actually grew on me as I drank it, its not something I would drink all the time, but I'm glad I got to try it."
"Drinkability: My second favorite in their line so far. This one is less sweet than most in this category. A sipper but could do a four over a long evening. One I would certainly pick up again."
"D: Easy drinking. Another delicious Stout from Dark Horse!"
"Drinkability: Very smooth and creamy Stout. I had expected a titch more from the aroma, but that is a minor gripe. Better than One, not as good as Tres. Awaiting Fore and The Fifth."
"Overall: A decent, but somewhat uninspired brew. If you like the style, seek this one out, you won't be disappointed. Otherwise, move along."
"Finish: Hints of Bitter hops and coffee still on the palate"
"D - Easier than I was expecting for the abv, just a darn tasty beer"
"D - May have to go back in a week and pick up a couple of more. Worth picking up just for the smell and appearance but worth picking more up for the smooth body and solid roasty flavor! Another solid offering from Dark Horse!"
"All in all, this is like a tasty blackhole."
"d - A pretty nice stout. Not a lot of cream in the nose but you can definitely taste it. Glad to try it and would definitely have it again."
"D: This is a very good beer with good flavors, but they are a bit to strong and overpowering to be very drinkable."
"Excellent mouth on this one. Big chewy feel with a smooth coating effect. Excellent for this style. I wish all stouts would take note and do the same. This isn't the sweetest of Sweet Stouts, but it's still a good one. Dark chocolate, roasted coffee, slight acidity, and the faintest of wood notes on the back end. Good, easy-drinking stout here. The alcohol gets to me near the end though, so it's not necessarily an everyday beer. I love me some thick stouts, so I'm glad I have some more bottles of this."
"This bottle poured an oily black with a little head to start but it quickly died off. It's the weakest of their stout series in terms of appearance (One through 5th). The aromas are of a lot of coffee, some chocolate and then this moldy like funk. This milk stout is smelly fishy. It almost has some oak or smoke like qualities (but nothing like the Fore). It's a turn off. The flavor is strange too. There's a lot of smoke and this weird spin on lactic acid. It kind of has this burnt bacon aspect to it as well. At least its silky smooth and the alcohol is well hidden. This beer, in my opinion, is the weakest of their stout series. I don't know what went wrong."
"Great example of the style. Would be more drinkable with less roast, but is still really drinkable. A solid beer from Dark Horse."
"D: love this one regardless so i could drink it all night. delicious."
"Not a fan."
"Best milk stout I've had to date. I find that beers in this style overshoot the lactose and undershoot the roast malt. Too is a near perfect mix of predominantly roast malts with a complimentary sweetness."
"D: The 8% really doesn't come through, but the flavors are big enough to make this a sipper. Good combination of flavors, definitely a good stout, but that smoke is a bit too heavy, and doesn't necessarily combine well with the fruit."
"D - Pretty good, but not as drinkable as ""One Oatmeal Stout"" for me. I didn't really get the impression that this was a cream stout, but it was pretty good regardless and if you like stouts, this is one to try."
"Drink is not that great, fairly heavy and a little syrupy, a bit boozy, and bitterness and minerality linger for a little bit."
"D: The creamy mouthfeel makes it wonderfully drinkable."
"D- A bit too boozy and bitter for a milk stout."
"Excellent beer."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and silky. Easy drinking, good flavors. I am consistantly impressed by Dark Horse Brewing, and this cream stout is no exception."
"Pours with a jet black body, and 1/2 inch of creamy mocha head the settles to a nice cap after a few minutes in my pint glass. Milk and dark chocolates coming through in the nose, as well as some roasted malts, lactose, and coffee. More of a roasted coffee flavor, than the chocolate I got from the aromas. There is a whole lot of roastiness in this stout's flavor profile - maybe bordering on having too much of a roasted character for the style. Slightly above a medium bodied stout, average carbonation, and slightly dry which was a bit unexpected. I did find it fairly drinkable, it drinks more like a 6% American Stout than an 8% Sweet Stout IMO."
"A very nice stout, no sickening rotten molasses here. Good brew"
"Dark Horse Too is a deep dark looking black stout with that signature dark tan, mocha colored head thats about an inch and leaves some stick, never leaving. Smell is more on the roasty side than creamy truthfully, I thought this was a coffee stout initially. If this is a sweet stout, it does not show. Taste is all coffee and with significant warming some vanilla and faint chocolate come out and dance. Coffee bordering on espresso. Feel is silky and a bold medium with a smooth feel, easy going down the hatch, no burn from the eight percent. As with all in this stout series, its a easy drinker, and while it is much off style, too gets points for having class."
"Plenty of chocolate both bitter and sweet in the nose. A hearty dose of roasted malt as well. Thick bodied with a velvety smooth feel that's enhanced by the lactose. I like this beer; it's the rare milk stout that doesn't feel the need to be overly sweet. The smoothness and moderate sweetness work quite well with the lingering dry roast. Really, the roast is so strong as to overshadow the sweeter aspects of the beer, and it seems to be for the better as far as I can tell. Nice beer that goes down easy. 8%? Dangerous stuff."
"D- this is a good cream stout it would be a great coffee stout. That being said I really enjoy this brew and like most of their line up its amazingly easy to drink."
"Pours a very dark, near black brown with a slight reddish tint and a foamy dark brown head. Great aroma, roasted malts, lots of chocolate, a little burnt coffee, touch of hops. Flavor is coffee, Cocoa and cream with a smooth, sweet Malt, and a roasted smoky finish. And a touch of hops to even things out. I think for a Cream Stout, this has more ""Bite"" than usual. But still a very good stout."
"D. This is a good tasting beer that is light to medium bodied that hides its 8.0% ABV very well and not being as thick as I thought it would be and being a smooth flowing easy beer to drink makes this a nice drinkable brew."
"Pours a pitch black color with an extremely dark, milk chocolate head that fizzles away to a ring around the glass. Smells of much roastiness, some lactose, bittersweet chocolate....Taste has sweet malts and lactose up front and goes into a chocolatey flavor which then morphs into a very roasty and milky flavor that grips the tongue for a good while...very lasting roast. Moderate carbonation fights through the creamy textured body. Very tasty but by the end of the pint I prefer to move on as the flavor becomes a bit cloying."
"D: Goes down way too easily: I could drink the four pack tonight quite enjoyably. Dark Horse definitely nailed the style on this one! I highly doubt that this is actually 8% abv, as Dark Horse doesn't release the ABV of their stouts (except Plead the 5th since I think it's high enough that it's required)."
"D- Moderately high, very enjoyable. Dark Horse makes some kick-ass stouts. Worth checking out."
"Updated on 12/13/13 - flavor more balanced with subtle peat smoked malt notes complementing the full mouthfeel of lactose well!"
"D- Good, but not great drinkability. This is due to the warming alcohol finish which catches up with you rather quick. Still, this is a very rich and complex variation of the style. I enjoyed it very much"
"D: If I liked this more, it would be excessively drinkable and I would probably get into trouble after three or four because the alcohol doesn't come through in the taste. However, given my issues with this, it's a beer that I wouldn't turn down if given to me at a friend's house but not one that I'd actively search out."
"What a stout! Dark, very rich and roasty with a lot of body. Coffee and cocoa flavors are slightly covered by the intense roastiness but it's good all around. Don't eat a heavy meal before drinking one because this will leave you full. Not recommended for the sensitive palate."
"A solid brew that, as stated above, is fun for a little bit but a full pour over stays its welcome."
"Pours jet black with a dark chocolate brown head. In the aroma, a roasted malt, coffee, and a small hint of sweet cream. In the taste, roasted coffee and chocolate, with a sweet creaminess in the end. A smooth and medium to big bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry, small creamy coffee in the aftertaste. A really nice stout, and it goes down too easy for 8%."
"DB- An impressively flavorful and rich Milk Stout. If you like roast beer this is the place to go. The aroma is great and the taste is nice. I liked One and I like this Too."
"D: Goes down easily, quite tasty - carbonation may be a bit high, somewhat filling, good kick, and nice representation of style. I really enjoyed this beer!"
"D: I would definitely have this again."
"Though nothing spectacular, Too is solid if a little different than my expectations. Regardless, a cream stout that is light on the cream, heavy on the roast? Works for me."
"Solid cream stout w/ a kick! This one's not too far from being something really special. Anyone who likes stouts should give this one a try."
"Try it out."
"Pours a pitch black hue, absolutely no light makes it through. Big billowing dark moccha tan head forming thick with sporadic bands of lacing forming on my Sammy Smith impy pint. Aroma has an air of nice smokiness amongst the dark chocolate roasted coffee and creamy milk sugar tones going on. Ideal dark stout that competes as up there with some of the best stout I've had from Michigan, that's pretty huge when comparing to Bell's, and Founder's. Flavor is full of dark roasted malt character, dark coffee creamy hints of milk sugars amongs the acrid dark nearly burnt roasted malt flavor. Very good balanced big cream stout, it does finish a bit sour harsh with creamed coffee notes. Mouthfeel was medium bodied soft carbonation mellow on the palate really worked finish was a bit harsh with acrid roasted dark malts. Drinkability overall was very good, alcohol was extremely well hidden the type of brew that you will put a couple away before realizing the potency. Flavor wise you will want to consume a couple of these brews."
"Drinkability -- This would be exceptional if it weren't so burnt tasting. Color, aroma, feel - all great. There are some beers that can taste nearly burnt but still be quite satisfying. This wasn't one of those beers for me."
"drinkability is great - an almost perfect beer - i have had this beer before but not this fresh and it had lost most of the coffee flavors - just a great four pack @ 7.99"
" Body is full and creamy, but not oily or overly thick. The finish is creamy, carrying the rich flavor very well. This is easy-drinking for a strong stout, and a great pair for chocolate mousse or other creamy desserts."
"Poured into a snifter. Pours a very, very dark brown color. Nose brings forward some lightly roasted malt as well as a bit of sugar. Some coffee and chocolate pervade, but are certainly in the background. The taste is pretty plain without much other than a bit of roast. The feel is a bit dry, but has a nice body with the lactose. Drinks quite well overall, though there's not much that stands out about it."
"The mouthfeel is a bit above medium bodied with carbonation being moderate. Drinkability is pretty good, it had some nice flavors to it. It was pretty balanced between the sweetness and roasty flavors which really helped the drinkability and complexity of it. Very nice beer overall and a very good version of the style."
"Drinkability The Sweet/Bitter/tart dance is well done. There's just no part of this that's nasty,boozy,too ""over the top"". It's a tad heavy duty for gulping down more than 3,but for a stout...even considering 3 is unusual. This does not assault with a sledgehammer to the senses or a beasty abv,nor is it gonna kill your wallet at about $2.25 a bottle. Some great Stouts are for me so luxury zone I'm lucky to budget a bottle a month. This one...works well."
"D - not a huge fan of the style in general but this pulls everything off pretty well. nothing really stands out though there are no real flaws. hides its 8% very well, good for a cold night."
"This goes down pretty easily, and is a nice dessert beer. Not the best milk stout I have ever had, but good enough that I am excited to try another stout from this series."
"D-A damn fine brew with lots of flavour and a creamy, lightly sweet, finish that makes it practically poundable. The kind of beer that proves the sum of parts can equate to a mighty fine drinking beverage."
"VDubb thinks I'll like this one, so let's find out how right he is. It pours a straight obsidian topped by merely a few layers of brown bubbles. The nose comprises molasses, roasted malts, light coffee, cinnamon, and some blackened biscuits. The taste follows, but with a slim undertow of vanilla, though this is soon drowned out by the more sinister notes. The body is a heavy medium, with a moderate carbonation and a decently smooth feel. Overall, a very nice, roasty stout; a little light on the ""cream"" aspect, but rather tasty nonetheless. Those Dark Horse folks can make a mean stout."
"Overall i am pretty satisfied with this brew, i like the blueberry more but this one was pretty good, cant wait to try the rest in the series, if i only i could track down some plead the fith."
"drinks ok. many different aspects of this beer, but they don't quite mesh perfectly for me to keep me wanting more. alcohol is integrated well and is not a hindrance by any means. I would like it a bit sweeter and thicker, but it works rather well as it is."
"Overall - A good stout by Dark Horse. I look forward to the next generation..."
"You could down this smooth stout in three pulls if not careful, the ABV is not apparent at all and combined with the nicely creamy, but not heavy, texture, it could make for a two or three bottle adventure...did I mention it hides the ABV well?"
"D - Quite an enjoyable stout. It is one that despite it being a stout and having an 8% abv, I could easily have more than one of in a sitting."
"Overall, this was a good brew. I would gladly have this one again if I can just find more."
"Chewy, slightly viscous medium body with toasty malts as well as hints of bittersweet dark chocolate, toffee, oatmeal, burnt toast and slight nut flavor. There is a sweet lactc cream/milky presencethat balances things out and makes this beer very quaffable. Slightly hoppy with subtle spice. Very complex."
"The body thins a bit on the finish this is an easy drinking brew with a nice malty mix of flavors."
"Very dark brown pour with a small light brown head that leaves almost no lacing. Aroma has a it of chocolate with some roasted undertones, taste is quite similar but with more malty flavors coming through. All in all this is a good beer and a nice representation of the style. Something I would drink again..."
"Mixture of coffee, sweet roasty quality, lactose, creamy body, very good beer."
"D - very sweet. Only had a half bottle and don't think I could get through a full bottle. Too much sweetness for me."
"D: The aftertaste helps carry this one from sip to sip. Very well done."
"D-I'm very impressed with this beer. It has a pleasant lingering taste that does not fade to bitterness or dryness. Well done."
"Notes: Again I am impressed by Dark Horse who are one of my favorite underdog artisan brewers along with Voodoo Brewing Company from Meadville, PA and a few others."
"Overall, this is a great tasting stout. Uniquely different from One, but at the same time, equally as tasty and equally as high quality. This is a well-balanced sweet/bitter stout with the typical, but perfected flavors (coffee, chocolate, roasted malts). I like this one. It's a tad lighter than One, but at the same time it's still hearty and worth the pour."
"M/D - Light to medium body, a touch more thin than expected. Very easy drinking stout. Alcohol provides a nice warming, might be a touch stronger for a beer classified as a sweet stout."
"D - An excellent brew but it seems the ABV is a bit high for the style. That being said, the ABV was quite well hidden until it hits the stomach. I'm very impressed with what Dark Horse did with this brew."
" ~ This is a good beer but not one I could sit down and have more than one or two... or should I say Too?"
"D- Relatively easy to drink and a nice stout for when the weather warms up. Creamy feel makes this refreshing as well."
"Equal parts dark and sweetly chewy, this was a solid Milk Stout with a good feel for a larger beer."
"Lighter body, carbonation seems a bit high. Alcohol is hidden pretty well. A very nice beer. If there was a fuller body, or a creamy feel this would be excellent."
"The palate opens big and bitter with a pronounced roasted malt bitterness with some coffee. The bitterness is almost espresso-like, and it's also got some of the fruitiness that a good espresso has, but not as bright, though. There's hardly any milk or cream character in this beer. There's some sweetness, a blend of brown sugar and molasses to even out the bitterness. Mildly drying on the finish with a lingering bitterness, this beer is medium bodied with a moderate level of carbonation. Quite easy to drink, this is enjoyable. Thanks again, Bill!"
"D: One of my favorite styles, and this is a bit of a different interpretation of it. I really enjoyed the strong coffee and slight creaminess."
"The beer pours a pitch black color with a thick frothy brown head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It smells like a chocolate milkshake. It has a sweet chocolate malt scent with a mild roasted coffee earthiness. The taste is good. It has a smooth black malt earthiness that goes down easy with a light chocolate sweetness. It's easy drinking with incredible balance. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a very good cream stout. I love the subtle coffee-like character."
"D: This is a very good stout and the first beer I've ever gotten to try from Dark Horse. Quite impressed."
"overall this is a great beer. very drinkable as an everyday beer, and has a pretty high ABV that goes undetected."
"D- This is one of the favorites I have had that night. Nice creamy mouthfeel makes this beer a very nice sipper. Actually a little too much of a drinker than a sipper...haha."
"D: The stout doesn't feel like 8%, hiding the strength behind the lactose and roasted malts. The nice finish will keep me coming back."
"Pours a jet black color with no light being able to shine through (not even around the edges.) Initially produces a finger of darkly tanned head that quickly cracks and fades to just a thin lace on top of this beer. Dark roasty aroma has some scents of coffee and chocolate blended with a bit of citrus fruitiness and then a slight note of sweetness in the backend. Taste is roasted coffee, bitter chocolate, minor citrus hops and a nice warming alcohol bite. Finishes with some dry bitter chocolate and burnt grain left lingering in the mouth. It has a medium feel and high amount of carbonation which is a little distracting. This is probably the least sweet of any milk/sweet stout I have ever had and I can honestly say that I like it. It ranks up there as one hell of a stout but a sweet stout? I dont know about that. Give it a try and see what you think."
"This doesn't have the crazy, kick in the face flavors that make me love or despise a beer, but I don't think milk stouts should. What this beer does have is a lovely balance of roastiness and lactose. I would have liked a bit more complexity, but I definitely enjoyed this brew, and think it would be an excellent session beer."
"This beer had some ups and downs for me, and overall I found it to be just an average milk stout. If I were around Michigan, I think I'd opt for Bell's Special Double Cream nine times out of ten."
"This is an excellent stout overall. Dark Horse has really come up as a dark horse recently and has put out some awesome beers."
"The 8% isn't noticeable at all due to its wonderful balance. Good thing this is only a 4 pack."
"D - Enjoyed this one a bit more than One. Too is on the bitter side of the cream stout spectrum, which I enjoyed. The dark chocolates really added a lot of bitter character to this otherwise sweet stout style. I'd drink more."
"D: Would be extremely drinkable except for the russian imperial stout level of alcohol content."
"The mouthfeel is just okay... its super thick, which is good, but its very dry on the palate, and I'm not all that sure that the level of carbonation is right here. The drinkability is below average because it feels like you've dropped a brick into your stomach when you're only halfway through. Not for the lactose intolerant."
"D - Well, the ABV isn't noticeable at all, and I definitely appreciate the copious amounts of roasted malt to counteract the sweetness. This is my second beer(and stout) from Dark Horse, and I'm regretting not picking up extra bottles instead of just singles."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch brown head. Head retention is good, lacing is decent. Aroma is sweet and malty, the beer smells like milk chocolate, roasted malt, vanilla and some toffee. Taste is similar to the aroma, but I can also notice a bit of coffee in the flavor. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit chewy and coating with good carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's not hard to drink at all and it's smooth. The 8% ABV isn't very noticable at all, you'd think you were drinking a beer that wasn't quite as strong as it really is. I thought this was a good overall brew. This was also the last beer in the Dark Horse Holiday Stout series that I hadn't tried until now. I have to say all of them are good!"
"D - This is definitely one of my favorite milk stouts. Dark Horse always come through for me!"
"This beer poured out thick and black like motor oil, with a one inch mocha head that slowly faded away almost entirely. The nose is rich chocolate and roasted malt. The taste is sweet but not heavy on lactose sugars. The body of the taste is more roasted malts, chocolate and some bitter hops. Full bodied and rich, this one coats the mouth as it rolls over the tongue. Chewy and well carbonated, this beer is pretty smooth and drinkable. No real noticeable traces of alcohol. Interesting beer. Not really like other milk/sweet stouts I've had but a very good beer. Good complexity, this one really comes together nicely. Not my favorite milk stout but a solid offering from an excellent brewery."
"D: Dark Horse makes a lot of stouts which all tend to have a very bold and roasty profile which I love... this one is no exception. This is one of the better cream stouts I have tried."
"I'd love to do a side by side comparison between this and Bell's Double Cream Stout."
"Drinkability is good do to the fact its very light. Almost reminds me of a guinness draft. I would call this an above average stout but nothing i would seek out again. On a 100 point scale i'd go 83/100"
"Really high drinkability in my book - the first couple sips take some acclimating to, but once the train leaves the station, you are rollin'."
"Into a pint glass, pours a pretty opaque black with a nice tan head to start off with. Not much lacing, and the head evaporates into nothing. The aroma leaves a little to be desired, a little bit of roasty malts, chocolates, maybe some coffee or something. Pretty tame. The taste is a bit better, and mouth is superb. Fairly stock, it has nice roasties, chocolates, coffees, with the bit of lactose to boot, maybe a bit of berry, but perhaps only because I was trying to look for it. The mouth, as stated, is lovely, very thick, smooth, nicely carbonated. in all, a pretty good beer."
"Nummy. Poured with a small fine tan head and a tiny bit of lace. Color is an opaque oily black. Aroma is very malty, roasty, toffee/burnt sugar sweet and a hint of vanilla. Ditto the taste. Extremely drinkable. Body is luscious and carbonation is good. Finish is super easy, a bit long. Solid beer. Session if you're in this kind of mood."
"Great beer, I enjoyed this."
"Very drinkable. A great example of the style. Will do my best to keep this one stocked!"
"Split a four pack two by two witht the Too and the Tres. The Too pours a dark brown, with little light shining through. Tan head settles slowly, and lacing is very decent. The smell is once again typical of this brewery. Sweet malty character, with caramel, chocolate and coffee. Hops are only slightly present. Taste is more intense than the aroma. Coffee, dried fruit, toast, and earth are present. Drying hops finish off this brew with floral character. Flavors develop more as the beer warms. This stout is medium-bodied, and the flavors, while there, are somewhat faint. Overall, Too is a good beer and worth picking up if it is available. It's easy to drink, and nicely represents what Darke Horse has to offer."
" Get Some!!"
"D-big flavors which are nice, but just a ton of roasted malt that somewhat dominates; but the cocoa bean does come through"
"D- Although the mouth feel isn't what I wanted, it does make this 8%'er more drinkable. One of the higher ABV cream stouts out, but surprisingly one of the more drinkable."
"D- Goes down easy for me, theres just nothing too special about this. Its a decent beer anyway."
"D: I can hardly believe the abv since it goes virtually unnoticed. This is a highly drinkable stout that will please even casual drinkers."
"This brew is good, very tasty and drinkable. Has no taste of alcohol in the flavor. The only strikes against this one is the look and mouthfeel - very light."
"Excellent Beer. Not the creme de la creme, but at the same time not too bad. And for $7 a 4-pack, it's also economical!"
"As I said this beer is drinkable as it warms."
"D: A good stout. Very drinkable and an interesting brew."
"Almost black body with ruby highlights. tan head fades to a thin ring of foam. Aroma has hints of coffee, vanilla, dark chocolate, and warm cream. Flavor is very smoky, like a marshmallow burnt over a camp fire. The beer is not really sweet, but the smoky cream flavor dominates. gradually other roasted malt notes creep through, but the dominant flavor is smoke. Could have done more to balance out the roastiness with more caramel malt sweetness. Mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy, but not as rich as some cream stouts (i.e. Bells). Drinkability is OK - nothing exceptional."
"Taste is odd, and actually quite off-putting. The sweetness is a killer, and there is also a metallic note that is just poor. Not feeling this one at all. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Not drinkable, this one is a chore to drink."
"Pours an incredibly dark color, this one rivals the One in darkness, perhaps its a bit darker. With a nice 2 cm thick head, with kind of loose bubbles, but it stays around and leaves little sticky bits of lacing. And exiting beer to behold I'd say - but if the head was just a little more dense it would look nicer. The smell is very intense. I mean, milk stout, this smells like milk. Just a whole lot of lactose, and a bit of lactic acid in there I think - there's a distinct acidity/tartness in the smell, but I don't think this was infected or oxidized, it's just the milk sugar. There's also a complex roastiness, combining coffee, burnt toast, chocolate (sweet milk chocolate and dark). I don't know how most people feel about the smell here, but I really find it enchanting - a little more roastiness would be nice (and maybe dial down on the lactic acid kind of smell). This has all of the things you expect from a milk stout. Just a little tartness, but really a very nice sweetness layered on top of a kind of dry coffee and toast flavor. The toasty bread I think wins out, with a nice deep burnt flavor coming through, balanced with the lactose sweetness. Then a touch of cocoa powder comes in and it finishes again very milky - almost a bit of week-old milky flavor, when it gets some edge on it. I'm liking this series, that takes it to the extreme of a certain stout ingredient, and I can imagine developing a big craving for these in the future. The mouthfeel here is still very full, I mean good body, but the carbonation, just like with the One, just stings, it's too sharp, I wish that could be dialed down. It's like swallowing syrup with little prickly bits of glass or something in it (not quite that extreme, but you get the idea). Not quite offense in the feeling, but not enticing. This one is fairly enjoyable, but extremely complex and challenging I think. I actually found myself drinking it quicker than expected. The ABV is probably a bit higher than I'd want from a more-than-one-r, but I would call myself a fan of this beer, as far as milk stouts go."
"Enjoyed on-tap at Stub and Herbs in Minneapolis, MN. This beer pours black with a nice tan head. The aroma is reminiscent of burnt sugar and light cream. Light to medium bodied mouthfeel. The flavor is rich, dark roasted malt that go down very smooth."
"Pours like motor oil, a fair bit of sediment left behind. No head. Opaque, jet black, under a very bright light there are miniscule bubbles springs dotting the surface of the brew but you really have to look closely to see them. Smell of chocolate cake, stewed prunes, black forest cake. Initial taste was a bit shocking in that it was very sour to the point of producing a lemon-pucker in this reviewer. As it aired and warmed, the sourness softened somewhat and a prune tort and later a black forest cake with sour cherry taste emerged. Still, sourness persisted with a sour milk effect that was not all that pleasing. Overall, a bit too tart for my liking. The finish was relatively short. Although a most intriguing brew, I found this not to my liking and doubt that I would pick it up again; thankfully, Dark Horse has so many excellent products that it's a priviledge to support their efforts despite my not savouring this particular one."
"Drinkability: An interesting brew, most definitely. A little dry - not for a stout, but for a milk/sweet stout - with a very earthy backbone, but one I can still see enjoying every once in a while. Dark Horse continues to make above average brews and show occasional flashes of genius (Double Crooked Tree, 3 Guys). At the abv% level on this one - unknown, but I'd estimate 5.5%ish - it's quite drinkable, to boot. Recommended."
"In the end, a good but not great cream stout. There's nothing that stands out about it and the flavors are very basic but it's put together well nonetheless."
"Dark Horse Too is more than good but it isn't too great. This is most certainly something I'd have again, or could have more of in a sitting, but it isn't anything I'd go out of my way to hunt down (especially given the quality of this brewery's other offerings). There's very little room to criticize and I liked it but, for whatever reason, I simply wasn't too impressed."
"Reviewed on 07/10/2009. Bottle. Pours an inky black with hardly any head. Aroma of booze, sweet roasted malt, charred malt, and molasses. Flavor of lots of bitter chocolate and roasted malt and roasted chocolate notes. A touch boozy but rather tasty!"
"Bottle courtesy bulletrain76. Pours pitch black with a tan creamy head. Aromas of cinnamon brown sugar, lactose, cocoa, coffee, dark chocolate. Flavor is a big dose of roasted malts with a finish exactly like dark chocolate. Nice bitterness. Doesn't quite live up to the wonderful aroma. Medium-heavy body, dry finish. Pretty darn good."
"D - this is the definition of a sessionable stout. Flavorful enough to be interesting, yet it doesn't burn you out by the end. Can't wait to try more from Dark Horse."
"Drinkability? A nice mix of bitter and sweet going on here so I'm finding it very easy to drink. Another nice brew from Dark Horse."
"Overall impressions are very good. This is my first go at Dark Horse's ""stout series," and I can't wait to try the rest. A lot of flavor and not too thick. That's a winner in my book!"
"D - This was an incredible drink, I love Stouts and Milk Stouts are something we don't get much of, but this was a great drink an looking forward to more Dark Horse beers"
"It's not quite in the 'special' stout category, but it's better than most, as far as being easy-drinking."
"D: The feel really hurts the drinkability for me. I would only buy another to verify my current ratings."
"12oz. Pours black with no transparency. Chocolate colored head that leaves no lacing on the glass. Aromas are of roasted malts, but that's about it. Mouth-feel is smooth and creamy. Flavors are roasted malts with hints of milk chocolate and espresso. Overall, decent milk stout, but there are better ones out there."
"A dark black color body with a brown frothy head,that lingers a bit then fades to a nice lace leaving rim. Aroma of chocolate,dark roasted malt, and a sugary lactic note. Flavor is pretty simple, bitter and milk chocolate, roasted malt and a lactic milky quality,well balanced. Creamy,smooth mouthfeel,medium carbonatrion, and a sweet malty finish,quite drinkable and good.Dark Horse is always a treet."
"D- Very drinkable, this is a tasty beer. Not too much alcohol but more flavor and complexity than your average oatmeal stout, and a bit more enjoyable than some of the other cream stouts I've had."
"A very drinkable and good stout, but not great. The sweet lactose and the richness was missing from this cream stout."
"It pours pitch black in color with a modest reddish tinted head the dissipates fairly quickly leaving a slight ring around the edges and minimal lacing. The aroma is fairly sweet with the scent of baker's chocolate and cream up front and the smell of very dark roasted & slightly bitter coffee in the background. The flavor has a very roasted malt taste up front with a slight bit of dark fruits, unsweetened chocolate and coffee laying underneath. A little hint of bitterness is there but is quickly mellowed out by a sweet cream base. It's not supercrazy in it's complexities but the flavors balance each other well. The finish is a bit lighter than your average stout but not in that weak ass watery Guinness way."
"Drinkability: Impressed. This is not as sweet as you typically find in a milk stout, but does an excellent job of presenting a strong flavor without being overpowering. A good sipper, that also seems to go down fairly easily."
"D: it's smooth and not so heavy like a RIS would be, the sweetness makes this easy to take down"
"Overall a solid, tasty brew, but not worth going crazy over. I set the bar pretty high for this brew, and despite falling short, I'm pleased with the brew. It will be interesting to see how this compares to the rest of the series."
"Notes: cant tell too much difference between this and the oatmeal stout"
"Overall: Okay mouthfeel moderate carbonation but kind of a thin body. Pretty drinkable for the style."
"Great extra from Dbhog. 12oz. bottle served in a standard pint glass. Poured an opaque black with zero light penetration. Quarter inch mocha-colored head immediately dissolved into a soapy slick with a solid band around the perimeter. No lacing on this one. Bold nose-lots of cocoa up front followed by a roasted character at the back. Taste consistent with nose, but also picked up some lactic acid. Mouthfeel feel between light- and medium-bodied with a consistent background effervescence. Really tasty Milk Stout. I continue to be impressed by the quality of brews that Dark Horse puts out."
"Drinkability: Goes down very smooth, and the short-lasting taste makes you keep wanting more. A very sessionable stout. It doesn't really taste like a milk stout, however, as I didn't really get any of the sweetness typically associated with the style. An enjoyable brew, however, and one I'm glad I had the opportunity to try."
"Overall, a rather tasty brew. Decently drinkable but too heavy for a session beer. But, if you want a nice, heavy, strong flavored stout...then this is for you. Definitely worth a try."
"Easy drinking stout. Not a memorable one, really, but the lack of a head makes me think this was old and stale."
"D- A good beer to have one or two of. Definitely not a session brew. Feels to me like this is high abv for the style. Also pretty filling."
"D: Very drinkable beer. I love stouts and the flavors and subtleness of the cream really make it a joy to drink."
"Overall: Really great sweet stout. I wish I had a newer example to compare the flavors with, but will be happy knowing I was pleased with this and Dark Horse doesn't seem to disappoint."
"This beer pours an opaque black color. The head is small, tan, and recedes quickly into sparse lacing. The aroma is roasted malt, dark chocolate, and cream. The taste is full of graham cracker, roasted malt, cocoa powder, and cream. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation which might be a little high for a stout, but it doesn't get in the way of enjoying the beer. Overall, this is a mighty nice cream stout. I will certainly drink this again."
"D - a nice easy drinking cream stout."
"D= This isn't a terrible beer, it just isn't that great either. Still, the coffee maltiness is sort of interesting if you forget that it is supposed to be sweet. Probably not something I will buy again."
"D-Moderate. The roasty blackness takes a clear center-stage in this beer, so it seems to lack somewhat the cream/sweet stout character. I think that the complexity, when I could peel off the layers of roast to see what's underneath, was very enjoyable."
"D - I enjoyed this much more than One. This was dead on for it's style, without being a one note song. It maintained a nice mix of chocolates, along with some nice herbal notes to make this a beer I would look out for."
"This beer is pitch black with a creamy head that looks like blowing bubbles into chocolate milk with a straw. Some average lacing is left on the glass, but this looks perfect for a sweet stout. Nice, semi-sweet aroma, light chocolate and roasty notes, but nothing spectacular. Slight lactic sourness in the background. Flavor is nice chocolatey sweetness, creamy, light roasted flavors, almost no bitterness at all. This beer is incredibly smooth, so creamy on the the tongue, but doesn't quite reach full bodied for such a dark beer. Carbonation is light, but only adds to the silkiness. This is very drinkable and the alcohol can barely be felt. A very nice beer and probably my favorite so far from Dark Horse."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into my Goose Island shaker glass. Appears a super dark brown color with around a finger of creamy, dense, caramel colored foam. Smells of rich, sweet milk chocolate, and coffee liqueur. Tastes of both bittersweet and semi-sweet cocoa, rich roasted grains, and a mild lactic sourness towards the finish. A notch below medium in both body and carbonation. Still, pretty tasty and I would seek it out again."
"The beer poured black, and the brown head/lacing disippated quite quickly. The smell was a mixture of bitter roastness and sweet lactose. The taste seemed a little too sweet, milk chocolatey and kind of one-noted. It doesn't linger after your sip. Not much complexity, and the body was a bit weaker than anticipated. A slightly above average example of the style - drinkable and enjoyable."
"Nearly black pour with a light brown head. Nice roasty aromas, small amount of milk chocolate. Full bodied smooth mouthfeel, nearly creamy. Heavy roasted malt and coffee but balanced with a bit of chocolate milk. Finishes with just a hint of bitterness. I thought this was excellent, but I seem to like many brews I've had of this style. This like the other top of the style really balance out the sweetness, which makes them have a nice amount of complexity."
"Too is a very, very good beer. I've got a small qualm with the style label. Irrespective of that, it is a good beer. I think it could use a little improvement on the nose and it would benefit from a thicker body. Small complaints. Damn good beer that's well worth seeking out."
"This is so damn good, highly recommend."
"M: Medium body; Carbonation is a tiny bit lacking, but soft carbonation is present."
"I would consider using this beer to introduce people to darker beers (although I'd take Left Hand first), and I wouldn't complain about drinking these for an evening, but it wouldn't be my first choice."
"D - This is a very tasty brew. A sweet and delicious milk stout."
"Unimpressive drinkability. Carbonation leaves beer somewhat lacking."
"Overall it's my least favorite of the holiday stout series but it's still pretty good. Not the best cream stout but it's a solid choice."
"This is a fairly enjoyable brew, but I couldn't see drinking more than a couple without wanting to go onto something else with a bit more complexity in flavor. Perhaps with a little more carbonation the rich flavors hinted at in the nose could really come through."
"D- meh, one bottle is enough. maybe my hopes for dark horse were high, but this one didnt impress me. its pretty basic. nothing offense about it, but nothing to make it stand out either."
"Even the purest light cannot penetrate this creamy beer's pitch black exterior. Just a small brown film of suds after the pour that diminishes to nothing very quickly. Very dark roasted aroma. Brings to mind black coffee from 7-11, but with a touch of milk poured in. Well roasted, rich flavored Kona coffe starts the taste of right. Then add some very rich, milk straight from the cows udder. Very raw, creamy texture. Just a little sweetness added to this bitter roasted, black as night malt bomb."
"dark horse too is somewhat of a mixed bag. on the pour it fails to produce any head but on the plus side its one of the darkest stouts i've seen. even while holding it up to direct light its completely pitch black. the nose is roasted malts, graham crackers, and faintly alcoholic. in the mouth its very thin, very still, and has little if any aftertaste... for a cream stout i'd expect a bit more creamy-ness but fortunately it isn't overly sweet. you could definitely drink alot of these and they weren't expensive (8 for 6 i believe). if you're new to stouts you might enjoy this for its mildness."
"For a cream stout, this is not real sweet."
"Well, you can't win 'em all. I'd definitely seek out something else."
"Drinkability- Overall I really enjoyed this brew. It's intensely flavorful and full of roasted maltiness that I didn't even know was possible. Can't wait to try the rest! Big thanks again to Jon."
"Easy and enjoyable to drink. Almost too easy to drink."
"Drinkability: A very pleasant milk stout with a surprisingly fruity/hoppy aspect"
"Pours pitch black with a short-lived mocha head that recedes to a ring leaving very little lacing. Aroma is mostly roasted malts with a hint of lactose in the form of bakers chocolate. The taste has a coffee bitterness up front before giving way to a substantial burnt malt backbone. The finish brings back the bitterness, but in a pretty unpleasant chalky way. The mouthfeel is a tad watery with very little carbonation. This is a pretty average stout and not as enjoyable as the first in the series for me. I'm hoping for more with the rest of the series."
"The thickness and bitterness make this beer a delightful sipper. I would find it very difficult to put more than two of these away at a time."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and goes down easy."
"This pours dark black with a tan head. Roasty malt and cream smell with a similar taste along with a faint smokiness too. Medium to light carbonation and a nice lightly rich body. Solid cream stout."
"Wow. What a beer. It's edgy enough to get your attention, but smooth enough to be a pleasant sipper."
"Bottoms up..."
"Mouthfeel could be thicker, but overall, a very enjoyable beer."
"Pours an oil black color with very tiny tan head that fades almost instantly, leaves very little lacing and a bit of an oily residue. Smells of roasted malt, chocolate, plums, licorice, and coffee. Tastes of bitter baker's cocoa, dark fruit, and molasses with a touch of lactose and coffee finish with a hint of anise. Medium to medium-light in body, low in carbonation. A little metallic and not very creamy due to the bitterness and roastiness throughout. A little disappointing to me, I was expecting more creaminess than it delivered, but I'll revisit this one again next year when I have the chance."
"mouthfeel is creamy and delicious, the name doesn't lie, the head is great to swish."
"Overall I thought this was a n excellent representation of the style and one of the better sweet stouts I have had. Rich in complexity and low in BV, it is the perfect session able stout for the evening. I would be happy t have this one again any day!"
"D: I believe these are about 8%ABV but the bottle doesn't. You really don't taste it, but i feel it hitting me as I write this. Two of these in a sitting would be tops. Overall, a ""good"" beer."
"Overall: There are many great brewers in the Midwest and Dark Horse is often over looked when people start talking about the midwest. They should not be. They brew great beers. As I sample beer after beer I become more amazed. The continually put out top notch beers that many never get to sample. Do yourself a favor and grab some, you will be happy you did."
"D - A damn fine milk stout! I find oatmeal and milk stouts far more drinkable than dry stouts due to the thicker sweetness, and this is no exception. I wouldn't really want to session this one though...it's more of a sipper."
"D-Good stuff,couldn't drink more than one or two but that's the style.Worth checking out."
"D - overall, this is a stout that has a ton of flavor and that is where this beer stands out. However on the whole, I didn't really care for the rest of the beer. It had really no nose which was surprising give all of the flavor in it. The mouthfeel was good but could be a bit thicker. This would be a good stout to have with a big piece of chocolate cake as it has big flavors but it is not heavy at all as you could easily finish the 4 pack of this in no time."
"D: It was thin and light with a dry body. It lacked creaminess and was not particullarily well belened."
"The taste is reminiscent of a mild porter, with the coffee strongly emerging but not overwhelming the caramel and molasses. This is certainly tasty cream stout. It's also a piece of cake to down, smooth and rich. Very good stuff, another hit from Dark Horse. Not quite the equal of Crooked Tree, but this is no lightweight."
"All in all well worth a try. A nice dessert beer"
"D - A decent offering from Dark Horse."
"I cant drink anymore of these. this is less than impressive, and barely toleralble for me. Perhaps if the carbonation were better it would be easier to drink."
"12 oz bottle pours a very dark black body with a small khaki head that quickly falls away. Just a spot or two of patchy lace. Aroma has waves of milk and dark chocolates with just a hint of dark roast. Smooth and creamy body with low carbonation. Taste has a ton of chocolate. Some coffee bitterness from the dark roast and a mild lactic note. A pretty good cream stout."
"Pours an opaque dark brown, thin brown head forms, settles down to a thin collar, leaves behind some lace spots. Smell is rich, chocolate, coffee roast, lactic creaminess, toffee, more chocolate, pretty solid. Taste is milk chocolate, toffee, roast coffee, touch of smoke, molasses, mily roast finish, bit of lactic sourness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, almost feels milk chocolatey."
"Drinkability: Not undrinkable by any means, but this is not a very nuanced or remarkable beer, even for a session."
"You can't see through the pour. Darkness follows in the foamy dark tan head that resists fading. Little lacing present. The smell is interesting because you get that aroma reminiscent of a sauce pan of over cooked milk that's ready for cocoa. The combination of that and a light chocolate note lessens a roasted malt character. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is medium bodied, but first off creamy in nature. Full flavored, the entire business going on in the nose is mirrored in the taste as well. This is really nice! Another one out of the park by the folks at Dark Horse!. Big thanks to BigDaddyWil for the opportunity. Cheers."
"Thanks to jjayjaye for the experience."
"D: Pretty solid, this is a step up from ""one"". Easy drinking and worth checking out."
"Pours a sludgey black with hints of brown on the stream of pour. Quickly settles to an ink black with no head, just a ripple of head that fades as you pour. Nose is dark and broading with hints of anise, toffee and smokey sweet burnt malt. A smokey sweet hue creates a cloudy smooth feel on the mouth on the first sip. Rich, full and biscuit like flavor graces the entire tongue. Hints of dryed cherries and bitter dark chocolate linger around on the mouthfeel. A very dry but not obtrusive bitter is there also. A nice sipping stout for those who enjoy the dark."
"D - Very drinkable, a nice milk stout."
"D: Pretty high on alcohol content and kind of bitter. I give it an average rating for drinkability."
"D - A solid cream stout for a cold winter's day. Alcohol is not too high to be much of a factor, and the flavor stays enjoyable throughout."
"Tastes just as smooth as it smells, and it's smooth all the way through. Can't stress that enough-it's like silk. Tastes fairly rough, though, and the clash is just a little bit offputting. There's some dark chocolate, some harshly roasted malt--burnt more than roasted--and a decent hop finish. Pretty good, but like I said it just clashes a little with the aroma and mouthfeel."
"Very solid cream stout."
"A very drinkable, well made stout. Flavor is quite rich and satisfying."
"D- Great mouthfeel, but the smell and taste aren't the best."
"Overall a great rendition of the style. Although this stout is almost a year old, its been cellaring properly and undisturbed to say the least. I likey mucho! Dark Horse has really made a mark on the Mid-Michigan Micro scene (whew!)."
"Pours near black in color with a thick tan head that reduces to a surface ring around the top of the body. Aroma consists of milk chocolate, cocoa, toffee, caramel, some fruitiness (akin to raisins), and some alcohol that's buried underneath it all. Full-bodied mouthfeel that's smooth in front and carbonated toward the back. Flavors of dark roasted malt and dark chocolate. Many of the same flavors from the nose are layered throughout. Very enjoyable. This doesn't quite have the ""creaminess"" of a milk stout, as it plays more of the roasted flavors, but regardless it's very good."
"Pours a midnight onyx black with a half finger dark tan head that instantly dies down to just about nothing. Well, the just about nothing leaves nothing on the sides...who woulda thunk? Smell is a rich raspberry chocolate aroma with mild oak like scents. Black french roast coffee leaves its mark. But this one is all about the malt...sweet sweet malt in the nose. Taste is a milky caramel malt that covers the french roast flavors. A weak smokey flavor is present throughout entire taste. Somewhat dry aftertaste with a cappuccino-like sweetness. Mouthfeel is almost water-like but with more density. No bubbles in the cheeks at all. No Kalamazoo, but this one doesn't disappoint at all."
"This looks like some really thick stuff as it pours. Pitch black color. Thin dark brown head. Good retention and lace properties. The aroma is pretty damn nice. Some of that smooth oatyness. Also some char and black malt goodness on the nose. The flavor really coats the tongue thoroughly. Big rush of roasted malt goodness mixed with some dark berries and anise oil. Cherries come to mind as well. Actually, more like bitter cherry chocolate. Very pleasing flavor profile. Creamy and velvety mouthfeel. Medium bodied. Very flavorful and very drinkable. One of the better cream stouts I've had in a while."
"had this on tap at the brewery. Served in a shaker pint a dark stouty black/brown with a brown ring of head. Odor is of chocolate and cappuchino, not too complex. Taste is sweet and malty. roasty. smooth dark chocolate. Mouthfeel maybe a bit thin for the style....or maybe not...nice overall. If there's something lacking its that the sweetness and roasty flavor together become distracting."
"12 oz bottle. The brew is as dark as black can be with a niticable lack of head, only mustering a slight ring around the top. Clarity is impossible to judge, and there is no visible carbonation in the beer. The aroma is solid roasty malt base with a moderate pineyness and a lactic acid sharpness apparent when I take a deep sniff over top. The flavor is very nice with a solid and nicely bitter roasted malt that melds into a creamy lacto sweetness that then finishes with a nice ashy roast again. Mouthfeel is moderate, with no carbonation. It has a mild slickness to it. Drinkability is fantastic. The flavors are really well blended; I like how the heavy roast is mellowed by the lacto character. This is a nice brew."
"Cheers!"
"D- This is the kind of sweeter stout I can enjoy in the summer months. I'm not going to session this one, but I could drink more than 1 in a sitting. I would call this a solid sweet stout."
"A good beer, but one would be enough. The taste does get a little much after one."
"Got this one in a trade from emerge077 and I'd like to thank him again for an excellent trade (it included a dark lord). This one pours jet black with a very dark mocha head. It was hard to determine exactly what color the head was because it disappeared very quickly. Roasted malt dominates this fairly weak aroma and is backed up a bit by some coffee. The flavor is predominated by dark chocolate but it is too bitter. There is some coffee in the background. Some astringency that is present is a bit of a turn off. This isn't my favorite of cream stouts in that it isn't very sweet. I do taste some lactose in there I believe though, so I guess the style is correct. An average beer all around."
"D: I couldn't finish it. Bummer."
"Pours a very dark black with little tan head and little retention. Aroma is cocoa, coffee, and roasted sweet malts. Taste is on the sweet side with chocolate, coffee, and dark fruits being the primary components. Very creamy mouthfeel. Not the most drinkable cream stout from Michigan, but a very solid beer."
"Now that I'm halfway through the One, Too, Tres, Fore series of Dark Horse stouts, I have to say that I'm impressed. Too is easily the equal of One and is so drinkable that I've finished the beer before finishing my review; something that doesn't happen very often. Snag this one if you have the opportunity. It's excellent beer."
"Easily one of the darkest beers I've ever seen, Dark Horse's Cream Stout pours an opaque stream of oily black into the glass, steadily raising a frothy dark brown head that drops shortly to a wide collar and whispy surface covering. Its intensity of color, however, is not carried over into the flavor and aroma. The nose is, in fact, more fruity (with a berry-like yeastiness) than it is roasty. Only as it warms does the coffee and dark chocolate character begin to rise. The mouthfeel is certainly full though, leaving it somewhat viscous, supple, and creamy smooth across the palate with a mild, very-fine bubbled natural carbonation from bottle conditioning. In the flavor it's mainly coffee-like, with mild hints of bittersweet chocolate, but no sweetish caramel or nuttiness. And the expected, harsh and bitter, super deep roastiness like an ashtray is entirely missing... this is actually quite smooth and rounded! There's not a lot of complexity to it, but it IS rich, and it lingers in the aftertaste for minutes after it's gone. Quite nice. A great cigar beer!"
"Overall a good stout, right in the meaty part of the curve."
"One is good for me, it's a rare treat..."
"D: Very different for the style. Not surprisingly, Dark Horse chose not to have this constrained within the style guidlines. Very bitter and tart but extremely enjoyable!"
"I get a kick out of the unassuming, boring, white labels Dark Horse uses. It is a great contrast to the liquid gold on the inside."
"Slight roasted malt flavor up front, quickly replaced with sweet milk chocolate and sugary dark fruits. Dries out with notes of coffee, baking chocolate, and peat. Oily mouthfeel with a full body and modest carbonation. Perhaps a little bit rougher than the other holiday stouts by DH, but still not bad at all."
"Pours a clean dark brown/black color, some carbonation, no head or lacing afterwards. The nose is sweet roasted malts, slight vanilla, and some toffee/coffee. The taste pretty much follows the nose, sweet malty, and a nice touch of toffee/coffee. Medium body. Very drinkable, a very nice Milk/Sweet Stout, glad to have a chance to check this brewery out, this is my first, but I do have another from them, and hopefully a couple of other's coming in trade. Recommended."
"Ultra drinkable."
"D- This beer has a pretty light thin body and the taste is pretty dry for this style."
"D - Pretty good. This is an extremely pleasant and hearty milk stout. It is more of a dessert beer, but one could session it (I suspect the abv is too high for that though). Dark Horse impresses me yet again. I should note that this might have had a really strong hop profile or a ton of bitterness - I wouldn't know since I had devil dancer a few hours ago."
"Overall, this is a fine, if unexceptional stout from Dark Horse. It's a moderately bitter sweet stout with all the right elements, but they don't really come together all that well."
"This was a good beer. I picked up a few singles and will seek out a full 6 pack now. Seems to hit the spot if you want something sweet after dinner and want a beer."
"Take the bottle and pour it deep into the glass and when the last bubbles froth and foment at the festering fizz top shake the last drips of the bottle onto the surface of the beer. You'll see little bubbles shoot off the top and slide like electricity to the glass sides and die there. This really has nothing to do with this beer but it's something I've noticed from doing this a few times now. All right...deep hued chocolate, coffee smoke, burnt wood and a mild sweetness in the taste of the dregs at the roof of your mouth. One of the best stouts and cream stouts I've ever had."
"Opaque black color, just as every single Dark Horse stout, but with a thin, and quickly diminishing light tan head. Espresso and chocolate aromas, with hints of vanilla, roast and brownies, quite the vibrant little blend of malt aromatics. Flavor has some oxidation, just like the aroma, but this is also a 2004 example. Body is slightly undercarbonated and it is thin, but not watery. Slightly bitter and astringent malt, but still decadent and enjoyable, with chocolate and cream flavors. Quite the treat."
"drinkability: quite easy drinking"
"Damn, this is one creamy stout! They say its brewed with real milk, and by God, you can tell! Not much of a head (I guess I mean none really), just like their Oatmeal Stout. Deep deep dark in color. The mouthfeel is exquisite! I don't normally like melted milkshakes, but in this case I'll take it! Strangely enough, I had this while eating a slice of Banana Cream Pie. Now, I normally don't care much for Banana Cream Pie, but Holy Cow, did this pairing go awesome together! Really! These guys can make some stouts!"
"Doesnt seem to have as much of the dark vinous fruit qualities present in many of the richer stouts. Instead it hones in on the interplay between the roasted malt and creamy sweetness, and nails it."
"Massive coffee and malt aroma. Pours deep black with no real head. Rich dark bakers chocolate flavors followed by coffee. Other than a marked lack of roastiness this doesnt feel like a sweet stout. Mouthfeel is very creamy so no false advertising here."
"I am hoping to visit this brewery soon and get beer fresh from the tap. This trio was from Corral Liquors Granite City, Ill."
"Another proof the Michigan has perhaps the best micro breweries anywhere in the country. Poured out to a flat, thick black color of day old coffee. Nearly no head or carbonation, only traces of dark reddish brown foam around the edge of the beer and touches of lace of the same. Aromas of roasted malts, wood, bourbon and a definite smoke element. Nice. Taste was very well crafted and complex. Flavors of earth, wood, coffee and dark chocolate, with spice and molassas toward the finish. Mouthfeel was nice and chewy, with a smoothness to it that is almost silk like. A good level of drinkability for being a heavy beer like it is. A Recommended brew."
"Drinkability is nice. Very good brew."
"from the bottle. poured black, with a tan head. aroma sweet dark chocolate, , coffee, caramel, cocoa. flavor the blend of the chocolate and coffee was right on for me than got those nice roasted malts. a little on the chaulky side but good. this is the 2nd dark brew from dark horse I have had, got one more to go and I am looking forward to it"
"Apparently they dont date these puppies! No dating. Pitch chocolate brown with a bit of caramel head in tight form that mainly was a thin ring and a tiny dusting just in the center. Deep, dark, and rich aroma. Thick and heavily scented of coffee, chocolate and hops. Creamy smooth feeling, it just glides along your tongue... schweet. Carbonation is just barely present in the background. Wonderful flavors, deep and dark, roasty and lovely. Black strong coffee, vanilla bean, bittersweet chocolate, hoppiness, caramel malts. Such good flavors and feeling in this. Nice one for the lovers of ports and stouts, as it has a lot to give to you."
"Remarkable for its easy drinkability, especially considering the color. Easily the most drinkable of the Dark Horse black biers and probably the lowest in alcohol."
"Very nice. I like a nice head on beer but everything else is very good."
"Quality milk stout, not top of the pack by any stretch, but worthy of a try."
"Another thanks to trbeer for setting me up with such a fine display of brews!"
"Thanks to trbeer for the beer. A solid cream/milk stout that features a nice lactose bitter taste (hope I'm not lactose intolerant!). Quite good, and one I'd have again."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours midnight black with two fingers of dark brown head, not tan, I mean brown! There is a bit of lacing left on the glass. The smell has a bit of burnt malt, chocolate, and espresso. A little light though. The taste is full of roasted malt, with some black coffee bitterness. It is rounded out by a sweet caramel and chocolate finish. Not too many hops present. The mouthfeel is fairly strong and heavy on the tongue. The drinkability is fairly good as well. Not a bad cream stout!"
"Very good bottle-conditioned mouthfeel gives some life to an otherwise slightly boring midpalate, and helps lengthen the finish. My hope is that this bottle is simply a bit past its prime. Regardless, an interesting beer and worth picking up."
"This is just a good stout. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Very dark with a nice head. The smell came off as coffee with a lot of cream in it. Roasted coffee dominated the taste. Lactose or milk sugar followed. Chocolate and caramel were also there. It had a grainy finish that mixed with the creaminess. Quite enjoyable."
"A 'thank you' goes out to 'Realale' for the bottle."
"At any rate, this thick, oily, completely opaque black beer forms a thin ring of cinnamon-colored bubbles. This appears to be an imperial stout from the looks of it. The aroma is potent...lots of strong dark coffee, maple-syrup, blackstrap molasses, hints of vanilla, and a very subtle cologne note. Wow. Mildly carbonated. The mouthfeel is thick and oily, with a firm, chewy body. The taste starts out with lots of french roast coffee, gobs of black patent and roasted barley astringency (especially in the finish), a very unique whisky character, with some phenolic alcohols and potent grains becoming evident in the long, spicy bitter finish. Dunno what the ABV is, but it packs a punch. Pleasantly surprised. If you like Kzoo's Stouts, try this."
