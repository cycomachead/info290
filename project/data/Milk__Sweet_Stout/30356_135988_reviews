"It's an alright beer, but certainly leaves me wanting more; specifically, more chocolate, caramel, coffee...lots of potential, but ultimately falls a bit flat/short."
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is a thin, almost black coloring with no head. Aromas of roasted coffee, hints of cream, caramel, and toffee sweetness. Decently balanced aromas, with hints of smoke in there, too. Flavors are roasted forward, with a sweet blend of cream and caramel to follow. The backbone is bitter roasted coffee, supporting all the sweetness and making this a layered experience on the palate. Fairly smooth, light, dry bodied, with a sweet cream and caramel-chocolate mocha aftertaste. The finish has a subtle lactose linger on a dry feel. Not bad."
"I want to like this. Almost no aroma. Taste is lactose. There is a light touch of dark cacao, and some stinky oats. Light, almost watery mouthfeel. Ughh keep up the good saison work."

"Lightly sour notes in flavor, perhaps their rogue yeast has had a hand. On the sweet side, seemingly underattenuated, with a slick mouthfeel."

"Thanks, domvan, for the opportunity"

"Dark brown, yellowed edges, a few bubbles, no head. Smell: prune, roast, cocoa. Taste: roasty, dark chocolate, earthy. Languid carb. Thin, flat, dull. Total miss."
""
""
""
"Aroma is dark malts, milk/chocolate and mild earthiness. The flavor is chocolate, milk undertones, dark malts, fruit and a mix of sour and mild acidity in the finish."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, looks alright, smells good, but the flavor is light and mouthfeel is thin and watery, not great."

"Prairie Limo Tint -----3.5/5"
"Had it on draft, and it was just kind of one-note. Really was hoping for more out of it."

"It really doesn't come off like a milk stout so much which probably explains my enjoyment of it is probably far higher than expected.  Decent brew, but the chocolate angle is a little indistinct and buried too, but there's plenty of goodness here."
""
"	In a stout market dominated by Russian Imperials and bourbon-barrel aged monstrosities this sessionable milk stout is a pleasant reminder that beer, even from the latest and greatest breweries, can still be simple and delicious."

"The worst that I've had from prairie. Thin, undercarbonated with no discernable chocolate. Fail."

"O - Just not hitting on all cylinders. I wouldn't reach for this often when compared to other milk stouts."

"i am surprised people are so down on this one. usually it is me who knocks the over hyped prairie stuff, not the other way around. i like this for being a little different, and while i dont think its their best work, its certainly quality beer. what i like about it is the milk stout part, its different in that while you can taste the lactose, it isnt all that sweet, in fact, its quite dry. uncommon for the style to have the flavor there, but have it dry out like that in the finish. i credit a dusty cocoa type malt, unsweetened bakers chocolate notes, and a very hearty yeast strain for this phenomenon. i am used to crazy yeast in their beer, and although this isnt crazy in the usual funked out barny sense of the term, its crazy because of its completeness, even in a sweet stout style. i like the frothy feel and all the body, and i like that its gone on the swallow. a cool release for spring too, as we are now moving away form stout season, but this one seems to fit, prolonging the seasonality of one of my favorite styles. well done this time around from prairie, thanks for making something a little out of your comfort zone!"
"Personally, I felt that this beer is underrated.  As a sucker for stouts, I picked up a bottle despite the sub-par ratings.  Poured black with small head that disappeared quickly.  I picked up a little malt on the nose, but more of the lactose came through.  Taste is smooth and creamy, with a touch of sweetness.  Just a hint of chocolate.  Very easy drinking."

"I loved it. it was extremely smooth and sweet."
"Tan head with a dark complex."
""
"Wow... i really like this beer."
""

"Pours a mocha head of creamy thick foam that lasts on an opaque burnt caramel, dark brown body.  Leaves sheets of shimmering lace as you drink.  Nose is roasty, milky.  Sweet cream on roasted malts.  Leather.  Cocoa powder a nice light chocolate scent.  Taste is smooth and creamy.  A big roasty malt that is so smooth and luscious.  It tiptoes up to a touch of bitterness in that roast but stays shy.  A silken caramel seems to come out of nowhere and glide over the back palate.  The mouthfeel is silken, creamy, soft, medium full and a touch chewy at times.  Finish is sweet cream and roasted grains with chocolate on top."

"Overall: Really disappointed. Maybe I got a bad bottle, because this was slat, watery, and uninspiring. However, the aroma was pretty solid. I'll revise my review if my next bottle is better."

"O: Aside from Prairie's most famous and hyped beers, I've been pretty disappointed with their more normal offerings. I don't know that I'll be paying the hefty price for many more of their beers after feeling like I spent too much on yet another cool looking/ well marketed four pack."
""
""
"Overall: 3.5 - A C beer. This really isn't anything special. Bomb! was awesome, Bible Belt was awesome, Birra was awesome, Standard was awesome...this wasn't. It just tasted like some typical, meh beer. I'm a little disappointed, Prairie. Not gonna lie."
"Seemingly full but reasonably so to the initial taste, its waning memories are dry, toasty and roasty with just enough malt support to resist ash, roast-derived astringency or harsh bitterness. Echoes of baker's chocolate and coffee extend into aftertaste and heighten my cravings for blackened, jerk-seasoned chicken wings."
""
""
"Really disappointed, I almost want to blame the growler, but it popped with a big initial tan head, and I shop at Premium Draught regularly and have never had any issues.  This just seems poorly made."
""
"Can't believe I paid $3 for a 12oz. I would dump this if it was homebrew."
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL:  A decent milk stout the cocoa . For being from Prairie I was hoping for more, yet it was still a perfectly fine milk stout.  I would be interested to see this one with some coffee in it."
""
""

"Taste-Milk chocolate,coffee, a bit thin-bodied. An ok stout."
""
"O: I was expecting more but this disappointed. I paid $4 for a 12 ounce bottle that's $24 a six-pack, way overpriced. I did not get the chocolate I was expecting but it's okay, the price just throws me off, this should run about $9-10 a six-pack, no more. There's better or equal milk stouts on the market for this price."
"compared to others, it's just ""alright"".... but it is decent; nothing to be ashamed of, for sure. decent brew. decent taste. not the best of the milk chocolate stouts, but not bad, either. i'd grab another one of these, if the price was right....."

"A good milk stout but defiantly not one of the best from Prairie."
""
"Chocolate feel that sticks but very light, meant to be a refresher. Tastes good light milky heavy cacao presence with linger"
""
""

"Nothing tastes right here. There's a lack of flavor besides a slight tartness, the mouthfeel's extremely thin. Something went wrong in the brewing process, and shame on Prairie for dropping it on their customers."
""
""
""
""
"Pours black with a slight khaki head that totally recedes before I get around to taking my first sip. Aroma is decent; sweet and slightly roasty with lactose sugars, milk chocolate, and some caramel. Probably the only good thing about this beer. Flavor tastes like water with milk chocolate mixed in.  Mouthfeel is offensively thin and prickly. If the watered down flavor didn't kill the beer, this horrible mouthfeel certainly would. Overall, I don't know what happened here but this one is no good. My impression is that this is the product of bad brewing, not a bad recipe. It will be a struggle to get through this 4 pack, and 2 of the bottles (if not 3) will likely be drainpours."

"12 ounce bottle.  Served in a Prairie Teku, the beer pours dark brown/black with a half inch tan head that fizzled away quickly.  Pretty much no lacing at all.  The brew smells like milk and bittersweet chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt.  Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some dark fruit and a Nestle Quik/chocolate syrup mixed with milk flavor noticeable too.  Just too much of an artificial chocolate flavor.  I liked this when I first started drinking it, but unfortunately it only got worse after the first sip.  Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, seems a bit watery and thin to me.  This isn't a bad brew at all, but I expect better out of Prairie.  However, at $2.99 a bottle I guess I shouldn't complain too much.  Worth a try once, but I won't be trying this again anytime soon."

"Overall - O.K. Nothing to blow you away but a decent stout nonetheless."

"d  what with the low ABV have at it - the the thick richness tend to make me think this is a sipper"
""
"Black as a dark night (or Dark Knight,if you will) and no light seeps through.  A fingernail of khaki covers the rim and about a quarter of the top.  Odd blend of bitter roasted barley and sweet milk chocolate.  The flavor is a complicated blend of bitter roasted/smoked barley and chocolate.  The body is thick and somewhat sticky.   I think there might be a trace of peppers or chilies as there's a touch of heat.  This beer is confusing.  Sweet or bitter.  Pick one."

"This seems like BOMB!'s little under-achieiving brother; every thing that is right with that is pretty much wrong with this; glad I got to try it.  Drinks easy, but not anything you would want to stay on.  This will work with tex-Mex or breakfast better than as a stand-alone beer"

"Very smooth and delicious. Always great things from Prairie"

"Plain, boring, some weird taste on the back end, feels a little thin too. I am not going to buy again."
"Maybe tried a bit cold but still. Very nice example"

"Good try for something different, and the price isn't a huge factor, but you might try to get your hands on one from a friend before you go all out 8 bucks, which is still more than minimum wage in Oklahoma."
