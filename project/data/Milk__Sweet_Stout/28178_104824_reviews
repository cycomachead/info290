"Dark black with a thin, dark brown head.  Just a little bit of lacing.  Smell is complex, with a strong vanilla and oak character, and hints of chocolate and brown sugar.  Taste was semi-sweet chocolate and some hints of coffee, followed by a strong vanilla wave concluding in an oaky alcohol burn.  A little bit thin for a 13% stout, but the taste definitely lingers and coats the tongue.  This definitely lived up to its billing.  An outstanding barrel aged stout."

"Damn glad I was able to get it at an independent store, as the big box chain in the area didn't have it when I called at 2 but somehow got it and sold out by 3:15 the same afternoon."

"Pours dark mahogany/almost black with a nice tan head, good retention and minor amounts of lace. Aroma is sweet rye whiskey, chocolate, molasses and vanilla. Flavor follows aroma - a lot of whiskey, chocolate and vanilla, some sweetness on the back end but finishes dry and boozy - very well balanced - absolutely phenomenal. Mellow carbonation, medium-bodied with some heat and dryness on the finish."

"Would definitely seek this out again and as it warms I'm thinking I may have rated it a bit low."

"This is an excellent barrel aged chocolate stout. Pours dark with a good, light touch of carbonation. Upon opening a wave of bourbon from the Buffalo Trace barrels hits you with a huge boozy aroma. This is a beer to serve at room temperature, where the chocolate and vanilla notes can be felt the best. Outstanding, and worth every penny."

"O: I went into this with low expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised. As I was sipping this I saw that it won an award at FoBAB, so that's cool too. Hopefully my next pdubs experience will be like this one."

"O- Very nice offering from Pipeworks, this is certainly a very good, but not quite excellent, bourbon barrel aged stout. [4]"
"Thin black pour with little head. Aroma is all bourbon. Most whiskey smelling beers I've ever smelled. Taste is milky chocolate with a lot of bourbon. Very good, but very strong."

"O - Quite delicious, wish I had one to age because it wouldve mellowed out a little and blended everything together. Perfect amount of time in the barrels, well done."

"Mouthfeel is really rich and creamy, a nice sipping beer. Completely costs the mouth with sticky sweet goodness."

"Verdict: An absolute stunner from Pipeworks. A textbook example of improving upon a base beer using barrels, adds not only complexity but depth. The balance of flavors is wonderful, everything in harmony, both sweet and earthy. This is easily my favorite Pipeworks beer to date and a remarkably good stout."
""
""

"Really awesome Pipeworks brew. Not suprising as the regular Games of Jones is so good. Tastes like a good barrel aged beer, but with some sweet chocolate flavor. Unique barrel aged offering. Definitely worth a try."

"Overall: Extremely impressed with this. I love that the bourbon characteristics in this brew are so familiar to actually drinking Buffalo Trace. A definite alcohol sting with perfect accents of cherries and oak are all too familiar. I love a big barrel character which this brew brings yet the vanilla and chocolate tones come through very clearly as well. Awesome."
""
"Overall - Glad the bottle was free! Just another mediocre, overpriced beer from these guys."

"Taste has more nuance, though still plenty of whiskey heat packed in. Woody drying aftertaste, much like a sip of bourbon. Middle has notes of earthy roasted malt, toffee, caramel, toasted almond, dry tobacco leaves. Chewy and rich, but not without some sting and numbing alcohol. Overall a little more balance would be nice, though it tastes good."
""
"Pours a deep opaque black with nearly no head. The nose is spirit forward with huge oak and char notes paired with strong vanilla. Next comes some fudgy brownie notes that pair nicely with he barrel notes. The taste is much like the nose with heavy vanilla notes paired with fudge and cocoa. The barrel aging has really smoothed the base out and has intensified the chocolate notes. My only slight issue with the beer is the body doesn't hold up to the big flavors. The flavors are there no doubt, but it is just a little on the thin side. Overall, I like where things are going for pipeworks, will be excited to see what other barrel aged brews are on the horizon."

"O - A very good version of this beer. Also had this at Fobab and it's even better than I remember. Please let this one warm up, its worth it"

"Batch 209."
"Fresh from the oak - this is very barrel forward with tons of whiskey, and in every way fantastic."

"Pours very dark with a light frothy head; looks kind of like a glass of cola. On the nose is pungent alcohol, baker's chocolate, and notable sweetness. Taste is rich and intense: bourbon-soaked raisins and dates, creamy chocolate, and lots of burnt brown sugar. But the barrel character tends to overwhelm those more subtle flavors. It's a milk stout, so mouthfeel is on the thinner side but not too thin: smooth and lightly creamy. Overall, this one suffers from the overpowering barrel character, and all the flavors of the original Jones Dog get snuffed out rather than enhanced."

"Well done. Dispute the price tag I'm glad it's a 12oz serving. It's quite filling but delicious."

"Overall - If you like bourbon-dominated beers, this is for you. If you like to taste the beer back there, this is not for you. I happen to really like bourbon, although I think I would prefer to drink it straight over this."

"I came back to this beer & had to update/edit my review. This beer is perfect!! This stands just as tall as BCBS. If you miss out on this beer it's a shame because this is amazing!!!!"

"Pours with a visible viscosity. Looks flat. Only the tiniest bit of light tan colored head. Very minimal lacing. Aroma is full of chocolate, vanilla, and sweet, syrupy bourbon. Taste is more of the same. Very sweet and very chocolatey. Bourbon and barrel are there too, but the sweetness takes center stage. Full bodied and viscous. Very low carbonation. Creamy smooth."
""
""
"It was very sweet but had a really big kick on the back end. I wouldn't say it was hot, but you could get a good sense of the whiskey influence in this beer. I thought it was very well done and would love another opportunity to try this one."
