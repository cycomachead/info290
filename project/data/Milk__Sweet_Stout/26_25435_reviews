"Overall, a great stout. Not the best stout I've had from FFF, but a solid beer none the less. It reminded me of Blot Out the Sun, only toned down in all aspects. At 6+ months old, I would say any hoppiness this beer had has been muted. It's a delicious beer for sure. I'd like to try one fresh and see if it has any more of a presence."
"It is not one of the wild and crazy Three Floyds' beers, but it is well done and a solid milk stout."

"Deep, dark brown in color with a thin tan head. Great waft of baker’s chocolate and a slight hint of coffee. The mouthfeel is creamy, smooth, flaked oats. Big roasted malts amp up the profile. As close to a chocolate milkshake as you can get here. There is a bitterness that ensures that this stout does not go into the deep end on the sweetness scale."

"Best milk stout I've ever had, hands down, even though I had it on a hot, sticky day in Chicago in August. I wish I could have grabbed a few more bottles of this and held onto it until winter, because if this was that good when it was hot and gross outside, I can't imagine how much I'd like it on a chilly, damp winter evening."

"O- Tasty and easy drinking. It could use more body."

"Popping the cap releases light coffee, large pitted fruit, prune and dried fruit aromas with a suspicion of bacon. Moloko pours inky black with a thin, tan head. The beer attacks the palate with dark dried fruit (dates and fig), cocoa warped around light coffee beans, grain and grainy spice, and a light sweetness all floating in a big, luscious, creamy texture that is a delight to drink. The flavors are rich, complex, layered and well balanced."
""
"Got a weird smokiness off of this beer.  Still a fine, if average, beer, but surprising to find that in a milk stout with no mention of smoked malt or other adjuncts."

"I don't even like sweet stouts but this was awesome. Toasty, roasty, creamy and sweet. Just enough hop bite to balance and a tad bit of alcohol heat to add character without discrediting this work of art. I love this stuff, I will be buying more. Perfect camp fire beer."

"No ABV on bottle, but listed at 8% here. I would swear it to be 4-5. One of my favorite in this style for sure. Just wish it was in 12oz bottles or Lagunitas priced bombers. Paid $12 for this one."

"So this is probably my favorite milk stout. If not (according to my rating), it's close to it. This beer isn't a ""sipper"" by definition, but you're gonna want to enjoy each and every sip of this beer."
"Smoky and tar-like in aroma, with a touch of chocolate. Citrus underlies a lightly roasted malt and chocolate base, with a hint of lactose sweetness."

"The Moloko Stout is another extremely solid offering from 3F! The beer poured an opaque black with thin ecru head that is not leaving much of a lace. The scent carries roast and hints of chocolate and espresso. The taste is much like the scent....roasty with touches of milk chocolate and coffee. The mouthfeel is full in body and very creamy...LUV IT! Overall this is one heck of a solid stout. VERY NICE!!!"

"O- Really sweet and creamy. Easy to drink. One of the sweetest milk stouts I've had."

"This was so good I don't know if I'd want to share. I love sharing good beers but this is one I don't want to tell anyone I have so I can enjoy the entire bottle. Mmmm.... Good work 3 f's."

"O - A great example of a milk stout; one of the best I've had."
"Overall - Really nice, balanced and not sickening sweet like most milk stouts. Has a really nice addition of smokey malts that sets it apart from the others. Nice easy drinker, glad ive got to try."
""
""
""
""
""
"There’s a roasty note under the lactic-tartness, with a full milk-chocolate character. I get an amped up lactic tartness atop a milk chocolaty sweetness. This is an intense and sweet milk stout, one for sipping and sharing."

"Pours dark brown to black with a small cappucino colored head. Smells like chocolate milk with a bit of roast. Slightly prickly carbonation with a smooth finish. Creamy milk chocolate, a bit of coffee, roasted grain with a slight bite. Very nice and not too sweet. Light bodied for the style and pretty easy drinking stout, though the carbonation almost makes it feel like a soda."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Mouthfeel is really thick but it's cut with some moderate small bubble carbonation gives it a velvety smooth feel."
""
""
""
"Thanks to smchenry75 for the trade. Pours inky black with thin, tan head that dissipates quickly. Not much lacing to speak of. Strong coffee notes on the nose; unexpected, but not unpleasant. Cocoa and malt notes follow. Much like the aroma, coffee is the first flavor to hit the palate followed by bittersweet chocolate and brown sugar. There's a faint bitterness throughout the taste, not overwhelming but enough to notice. The flavors evolve as the beer warms, quite complex. Very velvety and smooth, with a full body and light carbonation. Overall, although I'm not a fan of the style, I found this to be a well crafted milk stout. FFF continues to impress!"

" Pours black with a very thin mocha head that disappears quickly. The aroma is mainly milk chocolate and espresso. Some slight dark fruit notes around the edge. The taste is very balanced with heaping helpings of dark chocolate and espresso much like the aroma. Add to that a nice hint of smokey goodness and very soft fig note. Very drinkable but at the same time thick. Very sticky on the palate. ABV is completely hidden. Ive never dug to deep into the milk stout world but I have to say from the milk stouts I've had this one is among the best."
""
"O: 3.75 Milk Stout is my 2nd favorite style behind IPAs, and this one is very good. I don't find it outstanding, but I would definitely have it again."
""
""
""
""
"This is an awesome stout. It's not overly flashy or super unique, but it's just extremely well crafted. There's not much to complain about. They nailed this one. Highly recommended."

"Three Floyds Moloko Milk Stout ---4.5/5"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's definitely a milk stout, no mistaking the style. Probably too sweet for my everyday consumption but I can see why it makes a good base beer. Give it a shot if you're able."

"Adult milk chocolate. Thick, creamy, and sweet with a roasty lingering aftertaste that demands another sip of sweetness. Its black as night and is so dense you cant see through the beer. A night cap? S'mores and A Moloko? I think so... Touché Three Floyds, well done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Very nicely balanced. A great sipper and one of my favorite dessert beers. Not too sweet but some great malted milk ball flavors. Sip and enjoy! /92"

"Overall: This is a yummy brew…I bought it a few months back and even then it was a few months old… I wasn’t sure what to expect pulling this out of the closet, but what I got was very good (no surprise, it is a three floyds)…it’s an easy drinking stout that is a bit light for the class, but brings tremendous flavor that makes up for any mouthfeel flaws…I’ve heard this was one of 3 Floyds more popular seasonals and it’s understandable why…if you see this one floating around your local beer store, it’s definitely worth picking up…stashing a second in the closet for a later date, is also recommended…(4/5)"
"Edit: After sitting a while to breath it did get better."

"O - I usually haven't enjoyed milk stouts in the past because the ones I've had were too sweet. FFF's strikes a really nice balance to offset the sweetness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Solidly balanced, but missing something novel. Doesn't really live up to the Three Floyds pedigree. A solid benchmark."
"This is a solid, solid milk stout. It's a little too sweet, but I realize that is intentional. I don't think I could drink a whole bomber of this, but I would be happy to split another bomber in the future."
""
""
""
"Pours dark brown/black with a two finger tan head. Smell is milk chocolate, some vanilla, marshmallow, smokey. Taste follows the nose, milk chocolate, sweet milk, again some smokeyness. This style usually ends up tasting cheap but this is very good. The texture is silky smooth and its not too sweet. Definitely worth picking up, very drinkable and very enjoyable. Not too complex, just good."

"D- the over the top sweetness was a bit of a let down, but a good beer nonetheless"
""
""
"Overall - Solid brew. This is an older bottle and it still tasted good (August release, and it's now February). I will definitely be trying it fresh later this summer. 8% ABV? You'd never know it. Goes down very smooth. Better be careful with this one."
""

"I had several of these and really love it. I felt this to be so creamy, I experimented and made a beer float with vanilla ice cream-pretty darn tasty as more of the bitterness came through. If you like Left Hand Milk Stout (and I do), I find this to be a notch better as Moloko reveals more chocolate."
""
"22 ounce bottle into signature tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours fairly pitch black color with a nice 2 finger dense dark khaki head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of milk chocolate, caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, dark bread, roasted malt, oats, cream, and light coffee; slight alcohol noticed as it warms. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of roasted flavors. Taste of milk chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, toffee, toast, oats, coffee, cream, dark bread, earth, and light herbal spiciness. Lingering notes of milk chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, toast, toffee, oats, coffee, cream, dark bread, and light herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice flavor balance and complexity; great roasted and sweet flavor balance; and zero cloying sweetness present after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent imperial milk stout. Great balance and complexity of roasted and sweet flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering."
""
""
"Beer is medium-bodied, with carbonation of medium intensity. The result is a beer that is fizzy for a half-second, quickly foaming upon the palate and becoming smooth and creamy. Closes semi-dry, with substantial stickiness lingering across the palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty solid sweet stout. Really surprised by the smokeyness with this one, could almost be a smoke beer. I was expecting a southern teir type beer, and it doesn't do that. It's not the thick excellent imperial stout of ST, instead you get a smokey sweet thinner stout. Good for what it is."
""

"O-really delicious beer worth savoring, could drink this on a regular basis"
""

""
""
""
""

"This is one damn fine milk stout. Packed with smooth cream, sugar and roast, Moloko is pretty much spot-on for the style. If you're a fan of milk stouts this is dedinately worth a try."
""
"a great milk stout, lots of dark roasted flavors perfectly balanced by sweet chocolate notes."
""

"Bomber serve in a weizen glass pours black with a little light on edges, with a one finger khaki head with average retention and average fluffy lacing. Smells of sweet milk cream, roasted malts, chocolate. So sweet and so smooth, milk chocolate, sweet malts, some roasted nature, bakers chocolate and a bit of slightly sour milk finish, no bitterness. The mouthfeel is silky smooth, medium body, my esophagus enjoyed that massage, no alcohol detected. Love it, I've enjoyed all the milk stouts I've tried so far and this one is a big standout for me along with Left Hand's milk stout."

"O: 4.5 great beer and I wish I could give it a 4.75 for overall. This is one of my favorite milk stouts."
""
""
""
"Overall: Delivers for the style though i have had better. It seemed to lack a little oomph but overall is a good pick."
"This has been a want for a while. Glad I got the chance to try it without bias."
"Overall - I don't love lactose stouts and this is way over the top. Too much carbonation too."
""
""
""
""
"This has a great flavor profile, tremendous balance, and great drinkability. It's rich, smooth, and complex. This is a great milk stout that is definitely worth trying."
""
""
"O - Another great beer from FFF. Fantastic flavors of malt and chocolate with great balance and drinkability. The mouthfeel is damn near perfect. Exactly what I was looking for in a beer tonight. This may be the best representation of this style that I have tried. I highly recommend it."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is an outstanding offering from FFF. Nothing short of amazing."
""
""
"O- Just as outstanding as I was expecting. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to watch A Clockwork Orange to celebrate cuz that's how I do."

"O- This was a nice milk stout although probably not my favorite. Personally I'd probably take Left Hand's over this. It was very nice and definitely enjoyable. I would recommend trying it out if you like stouts. Looking forward to trying the cognac version tomorrow!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- this milk/sweet stout is crafted to perfection as most FFF brews are. They allow the craft man to experience a different version of a stout with this one. A must try for stout guys as this one is about the best you can try of this style. It's all around qualities are pure class and I'll have this one every year it's available."
" This one is hard to explain for me. Sweet but not over powering. Milky, but not weird or disgusting. Coffee notes, but not overdone. I have to say that this is a very balanced, wonderful beer. I enjoyed this one so much, I bought out my favorite bottle shops stock."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I really like this beer. Provides a sweetness without being too sweet. Delicious."
"O: A"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"pour is jet black with a caramel brown head. Nose is ashy fudge, light roast and toffee. Taste is fudge, light roast, caramel and toffee and a smidge of ashy coffee. Body is creamy, airy and easy to drink, carbonation is moderately prickly to balance with some lingering roast and bitterness in the finish."
""
""
""
"Verdict: Solid milk stout, very true to the style, which comes as a bit of a surprise from FFF as they love to make ""Not Normal"" beer. Nice roast, ample sweetness, good body, easy to drink, hides the 8% very well, a must try for any stout lover."
""
"Poured with a two finger thin and bubbly head. It looked quite syrupy going into the pint and displays a tar black color. The smell is of faint milk chocolate, burnt chocolate milk, molasses, dry chocolate powder and marshmallow. The flavor is smooth and certainly not overpowering. Light dry cocoa, sweet roasted marshmallow, light char, some toasted malt and a bit of burnt molasses on the tongue."
""
"Fuller body, decent carbonation, sticky and creamy on the tongue. Pleasant, easy drinking and the alcohol is well hidden despite being a little higher for a Milk Stout."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a pretty sweet beer, and I mean that both in taste in as a positive descriptor. Something about Three Floyds and lactose sugar just seems to click (I loved Apocalypse Cow) for me. I could drink this stout pretty often if I had access to it regularly. But for now, very happy to have gotten to try it. Thanks again to Ryan (tut2528) for this extra!"
""
""
""
""
"This is a surprisingly booze-forward sweet stout, whose alcohol sweetness gives the sensation of it being a much bigger beer."
""
"This beer poured out as a very nice looking black color with a light brown head on top. The head had a good retention and a sticky lacing. The smell of the beer is roasted and sweet. The taste is sweet, very nice roasted malt finish with a very nice balance. The mouthfeel is heavy, creamy and slick. Overall this beer is one of my favorites from FFF. A very nice sweet milk stout, I recommend this one to anyone."
"Smells and tastes of roasted malt, milk chocolate, and coffee latte with a semi-dry vanilla bean aspect popping up in the background intermittently. Sweetness levels are just high enough to place the brew as a Milk Stout yet restrained enough by roasted-ness to remain relatively user-friendly for those beer drinkers new to Milk Stouts. Well worth trying."
""
""
""
""
"O: overall, I think this one is quite enjoyable. I think this is a great representation of the style. Even though I find that this brew is very big on the milk/creaminess, I find it well integrated with the chocolate, coffee and hop notes. It leaves me wishing that I had a variant of this one because I think they would be freaking awesome. All in all, another fantastic brew by 3F."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it's an amazing beer. It's the easiest drinking beer I can recall. Everything about it is first rate and it's got good alcohol to boot. Easily one of the 5 best beers I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- This is world class. Definitely my favorite milk stout. The burnt coffee, chocolate, oatmeal and bitter hops work so well then add in the silky mouthfeel and it's so damn drinkable. I'm already a bit sad that this is only a seasonal and the place I bought it only had this one."
""
""
"Served in snifter picked up from Big Red liquors Bloomington, IN. I have had this on tap multiple times and bottled various times as well. Thick head about two finger with a light brown foam. Black medium body. The roasted malt is what stands out for me in the taste. Also have tastes of chocolate milk and nuts. The aroma gives the chocolate, lactose and possibly a nutty flavor. A lot thinner taste than I though the lactose help balance the roasted malts to give a nice balance. Solid beer."
""
""
""
"O- Really nice beer and a classic offering from 3F. One of the best Milk stouts I have had. Awesome bottle art as well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I have been on an IPA kick as of recently and I have to say this is exactly what I needed now. A perfect balance of sweetness, roasted malts and bitterness."
""
"O-Although I didn't get much in the way of lactose, the oats, coffee and chocolate work well together."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I highly recommend this beer. It's not too hard to find and in my opinion is one of FFF best beers."
""
"Overall: Really nice milk stout - will definitely get again."
""
"from bomber to pint glass this beer pours out dark as night. a nice creamy brown colored head stands two inches tall. taste and smell are both very lactic, milky, a little chocolate and a touch of cold coffee bitterness, alochol pokes thru as it warms. mouthfeel is consistent for the style, but i wish it was a little fuller. overall very happy with this milk stout."
"O: Definitely a solid milk stout, albeit one that would benefit from a lower ABV."

"Overall, this is a stout from Three Floyds that gets me excited to eventually try dark lord. Pretty darn good. This is what milk/sweet stouts should model themselves after."

"Shiny black body and served with a one finger dark tan head. Great retention and significant lacing as the head recedes. The smell of roasted malt, notes of cocoa, and a light sweetness. Opens with light roastiness, joined by a mild hint of semi-sweet chocolate and light mild malted milk ball-like sweetness that is perfectly balanced with roasted malt. Medium to full-bodied, extremely creamy and silky smooth. In my opinion, Moloko sets a standard for milk stouts. Extremely balanced between sweetness and roastiness with a velvetly smooth presence on the palate. Just remember it certainly packs a punch with an undetectable 8% abv, higher than might be expected, especially for a milk stout. Its exceptional drinkability can make Moloko deliciously dangerous."

"O - This beer has a flavor that is very unique to Three Floyds, which I also found (to a small degree) in Darklord. Very tasty milk stout."

"Had during the 2nd Annual Redneck Racin’ & Tastin’ while tailgating at the dirt track race! Big thanks goes out to Jzmhector for this one! 2011 vintage! Served from bottle into a NoDa snifter. Poured dark brown with a minimal light tan head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sugar, cream, and dark chocolate. The flavor was of sweet malt, milk, dark chocolate, and milk chocolate. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. This brew is what I think of when someone asks me to describe a good milk stout. All of the right flavors are there in all the right intensities and balances. I really wish that would have tossed something into this one to take it to the next level. Really great brew that I’m glad I got the opportunity to try. I suggest you do the same."

"O: Well now, this one was way better than I expected. Seems they added some oatmeal which gives it a nice silky smooth heartiness. Feels bigger than it actually is, in fact. I happen to love sweet/milk stouts, chocolate stouts and oatmeal stouts. This is all three in one. It's got a perfectly balanced, sweet creamy chocolate character to it. Easily the top milk stout I've ever had. Bravo, Three Floyds."

"Pretty delicious brew. Well crafted flavors that play well with each other. Its not my favorite style but FFF pulled it off pretty well."
"Overall Impression- Very nice brew by FFF! Well blended and didn’t overpower me with hops. The creaminess was my favorite part of this brew. I’m not sure when this was brewed but would love to find again!"
"o - aside from a knock you out amazing smell, this one lacks the lushness for me. very glad i got the taste but not a stand out beer from three floyds in my opinion."

"Dark, deep mohogany brown on the verge of being black...roasted notes fo cocoa, bit of coffe, slight hop presence...tastes of milk chocolate with ground coffee bean residue...touch of sweeetness opens up with a nice sugar base...medium bodied with a creamy touch... tasty!"
""
"Bought at Woodman's in Madison, WI. Super dark pour with a light tan head with tons of lacing. Smell of coffee, chocolate, a tad bit of vanilla. Flavor is chocolate, vanilla, and roasted malts. Really nice and creamy stout. Three Floyds continues to impress."
""
""
"O- I have wanted to try a three floyds beer for so long I never thought this day would come... And now here it is, and it is so good. This is the best commercial milk stout I have had. Hands down. If you can get it, get it."
"O: Had been holding onto this bottle for awhile and just randomly opened it the other night. Really, really impressed, thought it was going to be just average."

"D: Highly drinkable, not a trace of the 8% ABV. This is a nicely balanced beer, starts out a bit sweet and is met with the roasted feel immediately. This is a nice Milk Stout."

""
"FFF Moloko is a pretty decent beer, but not one of their stand-outs. Has a subdued imperial-stout taste; nutty, roasty, grainy (in a good way). Not bad at all, I could drink this all day.. all morning, anyway. I enjoyed the fact that the fermentation allowed for the production of ethanol, which when consumed along with the rest of the beer's constituents, intoxicated me."

"Reminds me of a liquid whopper candy. It's easy drinking with a terrific mouthfeel, making for a very solid milk stout."

"O: A very nicely done imperial milk stout, very high drinkability , showcases the malts, and dark fruit character of this beer."
""
"Overall: I honestly am not impressed with this beer. I found the flavor profile a bit muddled and sweet to the point that it was a more distracting than it was good. I am however glad I got the chance to try this beer but I will not seek it out again"

""
""
""
""
""
"O: I like this. Great balance, enjoyable flavors, fantastic mouthfeel."

""
"D/O: This stout is fairly decadent without feeling overpowering on the palate. Chocolate and sweetness are major themes here, offering dessert-pairing opportunities without the usual attendant heavy booze presence of Russian imperial stouts. Score for flavor may have been even higher if acidity had a smaller presence, but the overall taste is still strongly positive."

"O: I was really looking forward to having this, but it would take a lot for me to try this again. I ended up giving my glass to my husband who just ended up pouring it out. Does not taste, smell, or feel like a milk stout in any way. Very disappointed."

"The mouthfeel strikes me initially as a bit thin, but I have to remember that this isn't an imperial stout, not truly. It's just so flavorful that I want to treat it like a crazy imperial stout. Overall, this is one of the absolute best examples of the milk/sweet stout style that we have."

"O - This should be called a Chocolate Milk Stout. Very smooth, rich, creamy, and extremely drinkable. Thanks again Cy for send this one my way!"
"Moloko Stout pours a black color, with a nice dark tan head. The smell has alot coffe flavors, strong choclate flavors, almost sweet. The taste is nice and malty, sweet, creamy, nice choclate flavors, very rich. There is a bit too much carbonation, but still very enjoyable, and easily drinkable. Overall a VERY good milk stout, very enjoyable."
"O= As I mentioned. A really well made milk stout. Works nicely and is really well made. No complaints with it yet not the most amazing beer I've ever had. Works nicely together."
"Overall, a supreme milk stout. Tastes like a smore, and it goes down waaayyy too easy!"
"O: A very flavorful beer, really enjoyable on a cool fall night. I'm not sure why this is a seasonal though, I would love to drink this stuff year round. Nicely done!"
"Poured from bomber into a pint glass. Pours a typical jet black, with roughly a 2"" crown at the top. Scent is both smokey and sweet. Some burnt caramel and sugar. The taste is also very sweet and smokey. Burnt sugars and fruit dominate the palate. I'm not quite getting the milk part. The mouthfeel is smooth, despite a medium/high level of carbonation. Overall, this is an interesting beer, but not likely something I'd go out of my way to try again."
"cheers"
"O: Fresh pour starts off good, but goes down hill a bit when it warms up."
"O- The flavors on this beer leave your mozg all razrezzed, I mean this beer gives you a solid tolchok full on the rot with its ringy rooker. My humble appypolly loggies for the chepooka nadsat, but seriously this beer is sodding delicious, I'm not big on milk stouts but the flavor on this beer is done perfectly and is highly drinkable, I can't even imagine how good this would be on nitro, but really people who don't try this truly outstanding beer should end up in the staja."
"I'm a big fan of beers from Three Floyds and this beer lived up to my expectations."
"Moloko pours a dark brown to black color with an inch of beautiful light brown head. Great lacing. The nose is wonderful. Chocolate, coffee and dark fruit. Flavors of chocolate and coffee meld wih roasted malt and caramel. The finish is sweet with a mild hop bitterness. Feel is medium to full. Low carbonation lends a creamy texture to the beer. Moloko is an excellent example of a milk stout. Roasty, creamy, smooth and sweet, Three Floyds does a great job with this one."
"Great beer, one to contemplate and consider, intriguing in all its subtleties. And damn, the fantastic Clockwork Orange-inspired label makes even the empty bottle a keeper."
"-JH-"
"Overall, another solid brew from the good people over at Three Floyds."
"An interesting sweet/oat stout. Unfortunately, this one was best cold from the tap and went downhill as it warmed."
"Pours a deep brown/black color with a 2 finger tan head. Smells of deep dark chocolate, roasted malts, and some sweet molasses. Subtle hints of coffee as well. Taste is amazing. Nice sweetness and bitterness from dark chocolate. Roasted malts round out the taste with hints of coffee and sugar in between. Mouthfeel is full bodied. Overall, although a little sweet, this is a great stout."
"Cheers!"
"O - Fantastic beer. This is what a milk stout is all about! Smooth as butter. Wonderfully balanced with just enough hops to keep the sweetness in check. Alcohol is not noticeable at all! Great job 3F!"
"Pours an opaque black with a 1 inch dark khaki head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Thin rings of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, coffee beans, and some milk chocolate aromas. Taste is of dark malt, roasted coffee bean, and some milk chocolate flavors. A very mild roast/cocoa powder bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp but smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good stout from Three Floyds with some awesome smells and tastes as the beer warms. I am really glad I finally got to try this one."
"O- Not a huge milk stout fan, but I really liked this beer. Has a nice blend with the coffee, sweet chocolate, and some tartness of cherries. Only complaint is that it has a little thin feel to it."
"A very good milk stout. Very solid for the style."
"Overall, I really was looking forward to this one and was let down just a bit. I know that this is a Milk Stout, but I was expecting more than just the lactose sugar. Not very complex at all. Not a bad pick up if you can though. Thanks to CruisaC for this trade."
"O- nice milk stout. The taste is nice but the mouthfeel was a little bit off to me. I would love to have this again but woudnt go out of my way to set uo a trade for it."
"O: I think this is an excellent milk stout. The sweetness is definitely there, but the beer is rounded out nicely by the hops."
"Solid milk stout, real horrorshow. Quite sweet and one of the best brews my droogs and I peeted that evening. Couldn't keep me rookers off it. Can't wait to try the starry old barrel aged version."
"This is a prime example of the Milk stout. Creamy, malty, thick and Dark. The extra bit of sweetness at the end pairs wonderfully with chocolates and desserts. By the end of the bottle my class had collected streaks of foam the whole way down. A sure sign of proper carbonation."
"drinks painfully easy with no sign of the 8% abv."
"Overall: This stout goes down exceptionally smooth, but seems overly sweetened. Not a huge fan of milk stouts in general; I found this one to be quite quaffable."
"O: Buy it if you see it."
"Excellent milk stout. One of the best I've had. As creamy as Bell's Double Cream Stout and without the slightest taste of it 8% ABV. It's combination of strong sweetness, rich maltiness, and creamy feel is hard to match in this style."
"O - Good beer, nice taste, pretty easy to get down. Probably one of the better milk stouts I've had."
"D - To tell you the truth, I'm not really much of a sweet stout fan, but I must say that this was truly an enjoyable drink; great blend of roasted malt and lactose flavors keep this beer full of character and palate excitement"
"O – I generally find milk stouts to be too thin but this one is very nice. Has a nice sweet flavor but not cloyingly so. I really enjoyed this one. Nice and drinkable for an 8%er. Well done."
"Overall: Just too sweet for my taste and I wasn't a big fan of the lactose flavor."
"A great milk stout."
"Medium bodied with good carbonation, this is a very smooth-drinking beer. The body is coating and just a tad sticky. The carbonation is a little fizzy but does well to give this beer a nicely creamy mouthfeel."
"cheers."
"Moloko pours a stout black, with a viscous tan crown of foam perched three fingers high atop the beer. It just sits there for a minute and looks like a chunk of caramel colored cake. There's a pretty nice ring of lace that shows where the beer hit its high point, but lacing is a bit spotty below that. The nose takes a minute to really start to shine through, but when it does it smells like what I'd imagine a good, strong coffee does after it's been cut with some cream and sugar. The flavor carries that same general idea. There's a sugary, creamy edge to the coffee flavor, too much so in fact. It's almost as if vanilla is the primary flavor here, and coffee is just a supporting player, when it should be the other way around. The body is superbly creamy, with a nice low level of carbonation that stays out of the way. The result is a very smooth mouthfeel that makes this beer almost like drinking a dessert. I don't know there's just a touch too much lactose, or it's something else, but Moloko is a pretty good milk stout that could be great if a bit more roasty flavors come through."
"I just opened one of these. This beer's name is a reference to the Stanley Kubrick movie *A Clockwork Orange.* I didn't expect to see one today, let alone buy two. It's a very drinkable, complex. Moloko is a rare commodity. They got their new shipment this week (the first two cases in six months) and half the total stock is already gone. If they have any next week I'm buying more. :D"
"O - Overall, this is an excellent milk stout. Not quite as good as Moo Hoo but I really enjoyed this one."
"A bit thin in the mouthfeel detracts a bit. Overall, a solid and enjoyable brew."
"This beer made it to my want list ... probably from searches for sweet beers lacking hop bitterness. It certainly fit those requirements. I taste a simple sweetness which I actually don't care for ... it's like sugar cubes were diluted into the beer prior to bottling. I also taste a roasted flavor, but that's about it. I was expecting some other flavors sneaking in to provide some complexity ... nope ... too bad."
"o: I haven't had many milk stouts but this is a nice offering from FFF. Sweetness was not overwhelming which was good. I'd like to try this on tap next time."
"o: solid sweet stout. plenty of flavors. Nothing too out of the norm, but this is a solid brew and they really did a great job blending all the flavors and closing on a dark fruit note."
"Overall-- this is quite nice, but my opinion of it has changed a little for the worse since my bottle review. Maybe there is a batch variation... Maybe my palate has changed. In either case, I likethis beer, but not as much as I thought I did."
"Dark color with a nice light brown head. Smells of chocolate and dark fruits, smell is surprisingly ale like but heavier. Initial taste is light and crisp with a hint of coffee. To me the mouth feel is not as good as I had hoped with a milk stout, I think it has to much of a carbonation kick and not as creamy. As for the final taste the finish is very good with a lingering taste of chocolate and coffee that is very smooth. Minimal lacing on the glass as I drink."
"O: Another impressive beer from FFF. A great flavor profile with the mouthfeel to back it up."
"O: This really isn't bad, but man if there isn't some really strange flavors to be had in here. I really can't shake the I-just-brushed-my-teeth flavor after I thought of it. This really tastes like I am trying to drink an oatmeal stout after brushing with some toothpaste. Some strange almost chemical dryness that only slightly suggests milk fat or sugars. Some nice carob and chocolate notes that mix well, but the carob wins out where it might be better for the chocolate to. The way the carob lingers accentuates a light hop note. This combines with some dryness makes for a strange mustard-like linger. I don't know what to say, the flavors aren't bad, but where it takes me is questionable. Good but not, decent but miss-able. Easy to drink, but hard to buy."
"Cheers"
"Overall: A delicious, rich sweet stout through the first half of the bottle, but it admittedly gets a bit cloying toward the end. No problems whatsoever in finishing the bottle, though. I highly recommend trying this one, even if you might have to split it with someone else!"
"O - A good stout especially when wanting some dark flavors in the summer months, but don't want to deal with heavy mouthfeel and taste. So in that regard, this beer is perfect for that. So overall, that's what I enjoyed the most. A couple of more flavors integrated in to add some complexity would be about my only gripe."
"Overall: fantastic milk stout by 3F! Yum"
"Overall: While I typically enjoy milk stouts, I especially enjoy Moloko. The roasted malt and slight hop finish balance this ale into a very drinkable milk stout."
"O: I would love to revisit this beer on tap, but until then I figure I won't be seeking out this beer again. My quest for fantastic milk stouts goes on, and leaves moloko behind."
"The cpj"
"O: Great example of the style! I am so glad I have another bottle in the fridge to consume! Would love to get this year-round! If you see it...buy it!"
"Overall I will be drinking this almost religiously when I'm in a mood for a sweet stout, or a stout in general. I have a few 22oz bombers that I will be sampling in the near future when not drinking it fresh on tap. Great offering from FFF."
"22 oz bomber. This beer pours dark and displays little head. Smells of alcohol, lactose. Taste is sweet, nutty and has some Irish-like maltiness. It has a decent mouthfeel; smooth and easy. The finish is clean for a stout. Overall this beer is decent."
"This one pours a very dark brown that has a reddish tint while flowing from the bottle. It settles pretty black with an inch of mocha colored head bubbly lacing is spread throughout the glass. The nose is incredibly roasty with chocolate and oats. Some coffee aromas linger as well. The taste is much the same. Very roasty and full of sweet milk chocoalte. Coffee resonates throughout. Very pleasant flavors. The mouthfeel is a bit thin for such a stout but its super drinkable because of it. Overall, super stoked to have tried this and ill be grabbing more next time I see it."
"O: Great after dinner drink. Leaves you wanting more. Cannot taste the alcohol, but can definitely feel it. I will buy this I find it again.."
"I enjoyed this beer. I have been looking for it locally, and only recently came across it. Nice example of the style, and another great beer from Three Floyds."
"O: For being from a brewery whose motto is ""Not Normal," Moloko is rather normal, and that helps it rate very well. All elements fall handsomely within the style guidelines for a milk stout and exceed those found in an average milk stout. Recommended. "
"Overall this one is a big disappointment for me considering FFF brews are usually superior."
"O: What an impressive stout! Now I know why Three Floyd’s has an entire day dedicated to their biggest, darkest beers. This has been the best monthly release I’ve had yet from Three Floyd’s, and it’s hard to think of it being bested anytime soon. And the funny thing is, it’s the cheapest of them all! Only $7.99 for a bomber! At a price like that, I’ll be drinking this by the gallon if I can get my hands on enough of it."
"A pretty good milk stout but the carbonation seems overdone. My least favorite of all the Three Floyds stouts but still pretty decent."
"O: I didn't know what to expect coming in, other than Seth saying over and over how good it is. I was blown away with the integration from the lactose to soften this flavorful stout. This held it's own a few other big name beers we had that day. I can't wait to see if this makes it to Ohio next month, fingers crossed!"
"O: A very solid milk stout that was a pleasure to drink - Really enjoyed this one - Thanks again Steve , I could drink this one everyday and not get bored with it."
"O- Have had a few milk stouts, but this one is clear cut champion for me. Incredibly creamy and smooth and not excessively sweet. I have to pick up quite a few more when it comes out in the fall again."
"O - Not what I was expecting for some reason, but I enjoyed it."
"O-awesome stuff. will drink it again. but maybe the tap is what made it so awesome."
"D-Overall this was a super tasty Milk stout. HAd great flavors throughout and would love to have a whole bottle of this brew to enjoy. Was not too sweet and not too bland. Just the right amount of everything."
"O: Quite good. Certainly one of the better milk stouts I've had. Second time I've had this now. The first bottle was a gift ( thanks Bigturo) after his trip to Three Floyds, and he brought a bottle back. This review is on a bottle I traded specifically for, to taste for the second time, since I enjoyed it before, and this taste was no exception."
"Creamy, milky, silky, smooth, thick and chewy. Absolutely delicious. Awesome example of a milk stout."
"very dark in color with almost no light shining through here at all. Really very big looking. Nice tan head on top settled down nicely and coated the glass well. Aroma is all coffee and chocolate, this is really all it was at first. Sweet brewed coffee and brown sugar with light hints of molasses. Very nicely done here, reminded me right off the bat of Valdez the first time I ran across it. I was anxious to dive in so I took the first sip and that was all she wrote. Huge coffee flavor, just so sweet and ridiculously smooth. Blended perfectly with a rich brown sugar and vanilla note, with smooth milk chocolate coming in to save it and giving off a wonderful creamy feel. it was like nothing I had before. Not as heavy as some others, but it did not need to be because I would have kept drinking this one all day long."
"Overall: I really think this is my favorite milk stout. It is big for the style, but also isn't afraid to pack a robust flavor profile. Wish this one was available around the corner."
"Ummm....Yum!"
"O- Love this beer, wish i could drink it more."
"O/D - This is a delicious brew. The interplay of the roasted malts and sweetness is very nice. I was able to enjoy back to back glasses from this bomber without the sweetness becoming overbearing. I recommend this one and I will pick it up again."
"O: I'm going to hope that this is just a freshness issue and not a beer issue because I love Three Floyd's and this really fell short. I'm looking forward to trying this guy on tap or when I know it should be fresh."
"O: Not impressive whatsoever. Not a drain pour, but not worth having twice."
"O--This is an ok milk stout, but not one of my favorites. I generally find the style to be too sweet for me, and this one follows suit."
"A very good milk stout. The flavors are well-balanced, the oats give it a nice fullness, and the mouthfeel is great. My main complaint is that the the flavor lacks complexity and depth."
"O- the alcohol is hidden really well on this. It's got a ton of flavor, but some could consider it overpowering. This is a damn solid example of the style"
"Very enjoyable beer, perhaps one of my favorite Milk Stout. The flavor takes a turn away from normal with a hop flavor a bit strong for the style. The flavors work well together, a nice change of pace. Quite drinkable the ABV is hidden rather well. One I would drink semi-often if available in my area."
"Finish: Smooth and clean. Sweetness and mild roastiness are evident on the way down. Everything works together to make an excellent drinking beer."
"Overall, this is one of the better milk stouts I've had. Definitely a lot of flavor going on here. I'd happily accept another bottle of this one."
"A few sips into this im really just not feeling it very much. Although i know milk stouts are generally on the lighter side body wise compared to their big brothers, this one just seems too light, its kind of boring. The only thing that gives it much life is the bit of bitterness left on the tongue after each sip. Watery is the adjective that comes to mind when thinking about the overall body and mouthfeel. Compared to some other great milk stouts, im a rather let down by this one."
"O- Solid Brew, nice coffee aromas and taste, easy drinkability, another great beer form Three Floyds."
"Overall, very creamy clean and smooth, with no apparent alcohol making drinkability very high."
"Overall a amazing milk stout, super sweet and super sessionable. I would pick another bomber up of this if i see it again and for 7.50 you cant go wrong."
"Overall, this beer is certainly a sipper. Otherwise, the sticky sweetness to it could overwhelm. I like this beer a lot though, and it makes me wish FFF was distributed where I am!"
"O: A nice beer for sure, but 3F has beers that are much better than this one, though honestly I would be happy drinking anything they've got."
"Over all I could drink this all day and wish I could, relocation to the windy city wouldn't suck ..."
"The mouthfeel is definitely the best part of this beer; full and creamy like a cup of coffee if you used full old fashion creamer; a lot of creamer. Overall this was a good offering from FFF, I wish the bomber finished as well as it started."
"Drinkability: Nice flavor overall, but a tad too sweet without and accompanying bitterness to balance it out. No matter, as I can't get Three Floyds in Ohio right now anyway."
"D - Very drinkable milk stout. Well blended brew that went down very easy. Easy to drink a bomber by myself but enjoyed sharing it with my brew buddies. Would get this brew again, another good brew from Three Floyds. I recommend it!"
"Quality all over. Even with that weird green guy on the label. Three Floyds Moloko. Run to it."
"Goes down quite smooth."
"DELICIOUS, GET SOME!"
"Great drinkability, another excellent beer from Three Floyds."
"D: Highly drinkable, not a trace of the 8% ABV. This is a nicely balanced beer, starts out a bit sweet and is met with the roasted feel immediately. This is my first FFF, impressed so far, very nice Milk Stout."
"Beer is creamy and medium bodied. Sweet on the lead off and almost no bitterness at the end. the mid-palate region is chocolaty and more sweet. I liked it, I would have it again."
"This is a nice milk stout and very drinkable."
"This is certainly the best milk stout I've had (I enjoyed this more than Four). Great lactose character; well balanced between sweet and roasty. And Clockwork Orange inspired label+name is always plus."
"In a bottle long threatened to be drank but saved for a fortuitous occurrence. Black with a tan hue held to the light, primmed with milk chocolate aroma and little else. There's a bit of alcohol in the flavor, sort of resembles a more delicious Mudslide. Chocolatey, slightly boozy, milky, delicious. Another hit by the good folks of Indy.."
"Poured from a bomber (no date) into a dimpled glass mug. Pours a super dark brown that appears black with a thin layer of head that fizzled immediately to almost nothing. Aroma had a roasteded malt, golden oats, chocolate, lactic sweetness, and a bit of hazelnut. Flavor had a nice roasted malt base, golden oats, milk chocolate, mild coffee, tons of lactic, and light bitterness to it. There was a quite a dose of milkiness, but it seems light on the texture. Mouthfeel is light and silky and the carbonation on the low side. Might had tasted better fresh, perhaps? It had nice flavors and a good example of style, but was too overpowered with that lactose milk sugar for me. I cannot stand beer with too much of that stuff."
"OVERALL: A slightly above average milk stout, and doesn't hold a candle to Surly FOUR, for example. That said, I enjoyed the brew and would gladly have it gain, mostly because I love the imperial milk stout style. The look was the only thing that wasn't up to par, but we don't drink the look, do we? Good beer, and I was really glad to finally try this one. Thanks again thomashardy for the awesome trade!"
"D - Where Moloko shines really. Zero alcohol presence. Neither overbearing nor too subdued, the latter of which is my common gripe with other milk/cream stouts that I've tried. This is by far the best example of the style that I've experienced. Great brew from FFF."
"Moloko milk stout pours a rich ebony, topped with a light chocolate brown head. It is extremely inviting in both appearance and aroma. The smell of the roasty malts is suprisingly delicate, but easy to discern. The flavor is smooth, roasty and refreshing. And the finish is incredibly dry, especially for the amount of mid-palate flavor that lingers strong through each sip. This beer is delicious and easy drinking. Very enjoyable."
"Pours a deep black brown color with a thick brownish tan head and a ton of lacing. Smells of chocolate, coffee, and tons of malts. Tastes of chocolate, coffee, and a lot of malt that is rounded out with a little hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium with a little carbonation. Drinkability is okay."
"Cheers..."
"Overall, an excellent beer that I highly recommend. One of the best in the style for me. Can't wait to try again next year closer to the release date and on-tap after I move to Indy. Not avail here in TX so shipped back from Indy. Rotation - if avail near me this would be in the regular rotation while in season. [R;Y]"
"D-Drinks scary easy for 8.0 ABV. By far the most impressive milk stout I've had. Sweet but not cloying,balanced but never overtaken by the hops,great body but doesn't go overboard. A chocolate lovers delight. Why did I wait this long to try you? Arghhh!"
"SkÅL!"
"Bomber- appearance dark cola, thin chocolate milk head. Nose- black licorice, vanilla, stale coffee, bakers chocolate. Taste- very sweet- milk chocolate, brownies, light roast. More one dimensional then the nose let on. Body is not that heavy and has robust carbonation. Not picking up much booze heat, fairly easy drinking although the flavour profile does get tiring."
"Verdict: Very good, but just short of elite. Makes me pine for Mackeson XXXX."
"drinkability - very smooth and balanced, could be interpreted as bland, overall a decent stout, very true to style, great execution"
"D: it is a little sweet at first, but i could definitely drink an entire bomber of this myself."
"D - This is too sweet without being cloyingly sweet. In an effort not to be THAT GUY that can't finish a bomber, I'll finish this for science, but this would really be better to split with a friend or two. After half a bomber I grabbed some milk chocolate and cranberry cheddar cheese, both paired really nicely with this."
"D: Wonderful milk stout. The mouthfeel is darn near perfect. Flavor isn't bad either. Thanks again Mark for this wonderful brew."
"D-Pretty high. I really like this beer. Could easily drink this all night long. Not overly complex or challenging. This is an easy drinking big beer that doesn't taste or feel big. Perfect for these cooler winter months. I wish I had ready access to this brew."
"Chocolate is evident, yet not forceful. This is so damn easy to drink."
"Really glad that FFF has increased its distribution to KY and that I can regularly find this on the shelves. Another entry in my rapidly growing list of favorite milk stouts and one that will surely find its way into my fridge on many more occasions."
"Drinkability: Overall pretty well-rounded, but it is lacking anything that really puts it over the top."
"This is a unique, delicious stout. The appearance is a nice opaque black with brownish edges. The smell is very coffee. The taste is sweet, almost fruity (think strawberries), some bitterness, citrusy hoppish, cream? I believe so. Almost too sweet at first, as I adjust my perceptions the flavors unite and delight. Mouthfeel is light, thus the drinkability is high. 8% you say? Ridiculous. Almost English in it's stoutness."
"D: Goes down easily, quite tasty, not too filling, mild kick, nice representation of style. Although a little lighter bodied than I would like in a stout, this is definitely wothy of sitting with for a while."
"There's a more commonly seen and popular milk stout out there, but this one needs to be picked up where it can be found to know what it should be."
"O: This is an excellent beer. As I'm not too familiar with the style, I can't say how it holds up against other milk stouts. Very well balanced and is very drinkable for the complexity of this brew. You could drink an entire bottle in a session"
"Really a great example of the style, definately sweet, but not overwhelmingly so like some other sweet/milk stouts."
"D: This is an excellent example of the milk stout style. I had no problem killing a bomber of this, though with an 8% ABV, you need to be careful after a pint or two."
"D - I could have a few."
"For all their ballsy attitude, I also really enjoy the Three Floyds' take on the more subtle styles. This is one of those examples."
"Put this in 12 oz bottles and 6-packs, Floyd Boys, this is your session stout right here."
"Black pour with the faintest tan head that fizzles away. Smells like dark chocolate with a hint of coffee. Faint dark fruit aromas. Nice bitter sweet flavors that interplay on the taste buds. Hint of alcohol also which suprises me for a milk stout. Kind of a funny finish that taste like what I'd imagine roasted Oreo cookies to taste like. Hint of a strong cheap coffee flavor. Good full mouthfeel that is both full and smooth. Easy to drink. Not the best of milk stouts but I would certainly have another."
"Thanks to goodstrongbeer for this one. The pour is pitch black with a medium white head, nice lacing. The aroma is full of roasted malts, almost coffee like. The flavor is big roasted malts with a lingering coffee like finish. The beer has a full creamy mouthfeel, and nice carbonation. A very nice stout, was expecing it too be a little sweeter."
"Drinkability - A very easy beer to drink, or should I say quaff. Great beer to be drinking on this low 50's night while outside watching Inception on my laptop. Not bad...not bad at all."
"Rich creamy mouthfeel. Palate-coating. Subtle carbonation. Fantastic balance with the sweetness coming through with hints of vanilla, sweet milk chocolate, and finishes with a great nutty aftertaste. This is an absolute gulper. The alcohol, though well-hidden in the flavor reveals itself after a few gulps. Be careful: this drinks like a tall glass of chocolate milk. I loved it."
"D: Alcohol is hidden well. I could probably drink another one of these, but I don't know that I'd buy one."
"D: not a fan of milk stouts but this wasn't hard to drink."
"D - This exceeded expectations by a great margin. Sip-able if you can restrain yourself from swallowing huge mouthfuls. I can't."
"drinkability is great - i ? why this is a summer beer? anywho i am glad i found a couple still in the store"
"So far as drinkability goes, if it wasn't for the ABV, I could drink this all day. It's a great tasting stout that doesn't assault your tastebuds with a ""more is better"" philosophy. Instead, this brew adopts a ""balanced can be great too"" attitude and it works. I highly recommend it to anyone fortunate enough to acquire it."
"Overall: This is a great brew. One of my favorite American Imperial stouts. Its delicious through and through. Delightfully complex flavour and an incredible heavy whipping cream mouthfeel. Do not pass this one up. Highly recommended!"
"The smoothness and taste make this very drinkable."
"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass with an oil black appearance with a thick dark tan head that dissapatd to a small film that stayed for the length of the beer. Smell is of chocolate raosted malt and some dark fruit and coffee. Very complex smell. The tast is dominated by he chocolate with a sweetness of a milk stout, flavors are rounded out by small bits of coffee and roasted grain, very light on the hops and is a very smooth beer. Mouthfeel is light and creamy almost slick not heavy like the appearance. Drinkability, for being a 8% beer this beer is very nice and sweet some might be opposed to more than one but given the conditions this is a good beer."
"Poured into a shaped pint glass pitch black with brown edges and a dense chocolate colored two finger head that was gone by the time I had put away my bottle opener, left no lacing. Smelled of coffee and milk chocolate with a little caramel. Taste was very nice. Largely cocoa and cream with vanilla and traces of brown sugar and french roast coffee. Great malt presence and just enough hops to round it out but not enough to be more than barely noticeable. If any flavor lingers on it is dark chocolate, but even that doesn't last for long. Very clean on the palate. Rich and creamy but not overly chewy. Low to medium carbonation and a definitely filmy body. If only I had access to this on a more regular basis! Smells and tastes great, has a good texture and a decent appearance but is one hell of a beer overall."
"Smooth, medium bodied, and somewhat creamy. I like the taste of this beer quite a lot, and will have to buy some more next year."
"Not a lot of detail, just trying to capture first impression."
"An awesome brew from FFF here... Terrific example of the style and above and beyond on the creaminess... Amazing..."
"Dank and dark with not much head from the pour. What head I did get was milk chocolate in color. Body is jet black. Sweet milk in the nose. A bit cold maybe too much to get deep into. But the smell is pretty forward with just the sweet milk and a bit of chocolate. Very sweet rich and creamy in the taste. Has a touch of dark fruit. Taste is very good but I am just not sure it is right for me. Probably take some getting used to since it is my first milk stout. Carbonation is a bit low but I am guessing too much would be weird with this type of beer. All good but I can't see being able to drink much of this. I will have to revisit as my first beer of the night rather than after a hoppy IPA. But still very good and worth checking out."
"mouthfeel is full bodied but not sugary sweet. milk stout isn't a style i typically lose my shit over but this is a pretty good beer. i'd buy it again if it were on tap but not sure if i'd seek out a bottle again."
"Drinkability is very good. This is an impressive take on the style, in my opinion. It's also a well-structured & balanced beer. Keeps getting better as it warms. Recommended. I may have to track down another bottle soon."
"Overall- I may be a FFF fanboy, but they did it again! With this one, they prove they dont need lots of hops to make a delicious beer. Nicely done, Again."
"Moloko poured a thick black with a small head, which dissipated fairly quickly. The malt and alcohol in this one are immediately present to the nose, backed by mexican vanilla, maple syrup, and just a hint of red fruit. The taste is strongly nutty at first, though it opens up into a mix of bittersweet chocolate, earthy malt, and an unexpected note of dark red fruits. The mouthfeel is pretty spot-on for a stout, solid, but not heavy, and mild enough carbonation to bring out the deeper flavors while avoiding being flat or flabby. The mix of sweet chocolate and tangy red fruit keeps this one from being clingy in the least, making it quite a drinking-friendly beer, despite the occasional taste of alcohol."
"Drinks great here- about as smooth as they come- highly ramped up for a milk stout."
"I'm impressed with this one. Excellent."
"Cheers!"
"Rich dark stout with a smooth creamy mouthfeel. Dark and Milky taste that I could drink all night long. Color is dark as night and the head is thin and disappears quickly. Excellent milk stout that I would recommend to anyone and could drink any night of the week."
"Overall, the stout is well balanced. Not as hoppy as other Three Floyds varieties. It is a sweet stout for sure...perhaps milky, I'm assuming from a lactose added at some point. The body is quite nice, and it has an excellent mouthfeel to it. For this one, it is pretty on for its style."
"Drinkablilty is pretty nice here for such a big beer. TF really did a great job here."
"The best beer I have had from 3 floyds so far, have tried robert the bruce, alpha king, and gumball head all just ok. AAah but this for 8 bucks a 24 oz bottle (casanovas hudson wi) pretty steep for someone trying to retire in a few years, a real splurge. This beer was extremely tasty, a real fine sipper, so the 8 bucks was not a total waste like some of the other 3 floyds fare. if cheaper I would definately stock up. No head, yet bubbles are present and emerge in your mouth. Hard to describe, like liquid candy maybe , thick, sweet, dark, complex, caramel, but not syrupy. Smells like bailys irish creme, maybe good quality freshly roasted coffee in as well. Its alcohol content is about half hidden. Drink half a bottle and your head will know. When I get to the bottom of the bottle I will only have pleasant memories of this a fine strong flavorful milk stout."
"This is very drinkable for 8%, a very solid milk stout!"
"D: Very drinkable. I paused my movie and went up to grab a slice of chocolate cake to go with this brew. Excellent pairing. However, I decided to up the ante and dig deeper: I then grab a blonde brownie...Wow!"
"All in all, this is a good brew that I'm glad I got the chance to try. I would definitely trade for another bottle if I got the chance. Good to try if you like dark brews."
"22 oz bottle poured into a Ommegang glass (not sure what style the glass is either). Dark jet black in color with an oil slick of head that resembles the brown bag the bottle is in color wise. I'm having a hard time with the aroma, maybe it will be more apparent as it warms a bit. A light and slightly dry chocolate taste with a creamy milk like finish. Not much of a hop presence in this beer, however the malt profile is well balanced and not overly bitter either. Body is actually fairly light and easy to drink considering the cream component in the beer. Alcohol wise I would guess it to be in the 5-6% range as I occasionally taste a touch of it but its not overpowering. Flavor is in line with what I would expect to be a sweet stout and I would put the sweet finish as being lactose. Milk stout is my guess on this one. This is pairing very nicely against the Velveta Bacon mac'n'cheese with tuna I made for dinner. The salt and sweet are a good contrast with both having a slightly similar cream component."
"Great for a milk stout."
"D - Creamy, smooth and easy drinknig for such a (relatively) high ABV. This is a damn good, albeit high in alcohol, milk stout. I guess that's why it's called Moloko *Plus*."
"D-Really pretty easy drinking, but I could see the thickness and rich qualities of this beer becoming too much after having more than a bomber."
"4/4.5/4.5/5/5"
"A beautiful beer from start to finish, but I'm not used to Milk Stouts displaying such Imperial or hop characteristics."
"This is that beer that as soon as you drink it, you realize you should have bought more. You realize you traded this and should have kept more for yourself. This beer is fantastic. I would drink this all night long. At seven percent, I just might."
"Finally found this beer and got to share it with VDubb86 and a couple other friends. It pours an opaque black-brown topped by about a finger of burnt sienna foam. The nose comprises oat flakes, coffee, dark chocolate, molasses, sweet carob, and a hint of astringent in the back (though not enough to turn me off of sniffing by any real degree). The taste is somewhat similar, holding notes of bitter dark chocolate, maple syrup, molasses, oatmeal, raisins, light coffee, brown sugar, cinnamon sticks, and hot cocoa. The body is a heavy medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a kinda syrupy feel. Overall, a very nice and very tasty milk stout, quite horrorshow in every way (I couldn't resist throwing a bit o' Nadsat in there, me droogies). Get some!"
"Drinkability: This one is too easy to drink. With the dryish finish and perfectly balanced lactose sweetness it's dangerously good."
"I will definitely be grabbing this again when available. Will easily polish off this 650ml bottle. I honestly would be interested in seeing how this would taste with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream. One of the best stouts I've had, personally."
"I poured the last bottle from 2009 into a DFH pint glass. It poured a slightly viscous black tar in color and had a one inch dark khaki head. It looked great. The smell was almost chocolatey sweet and had a good roasted maltiness to it. It even had a little oakyness to it. It drank a little dry and had a good balance of roastiness and sweetness. A very slight amount of alcohol is present in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is superb. It's medium bodied and coats the mouth, exceptionally creamy and smooth. I loved this one. If not for the cost I'd drink it all the time. It's a top notch milk stout."
"YUM!"
"Drinkability -- now *this* is what I was expecting. Rich, deep flavors with a helping of malt and lactose sweetness. Just amazing."
"The flavor, however, resolves all questions of style: lactose dominates delightfully. The malt--oats, it turns out, much more pleasantly rough than the aroma had made me anticipate--is roasted so crazy dark because a really firm, dry bitterness is needed to balance this milky sugar goodness,."
"A nice drinking stout, it kinda goes in two directions at the same time, heavy thick rich high abv stout as well as creamy smooth easy drinking milk stout. It kinda blends the two, and gets some of the better parts of both, BUT it's hard to find where I want it to go. I almost would have liked a touch less on richness, heaviness, and alcohol to make it more sessionable and an amazing drink."
"D: Very drinkable stout, although towards the end the sweetness got to me a little. Good beer which I'm glad to have tried"
"d - I thought this was a very enjoyable stout. I thought it smelt really good and was insanely easy to drink. Would like to try again."
"22 ounce bottle, I guess it's about a year old since I think this brew is usually released sometime in August. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with a half inch brown head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is roasted malt, milk chocolate, coffee, and some cream. The aroma is very sweet. The taste is pretty sweet too, the beer tastes like milk chocolate, lactose, roasted malt, molasses, vanilla, and a bit of caramel. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, it's smooth and very easy to drink. I think this is a very good brew, the age sure hasn't hurt it at all. I'd definitely buy this again the next time I find it."
"Pours a dark brown colour with thin tan head. Smells of sweet milk chocolate and roasted malt. Flavour has tons of sweet chocolate as well as the lactose. Some roasted flavour, but not huge on that. A little bit lighter on carbonation than I'd prefer, but still nice."
"D: I'm not a big stout fan or drinker. It normally takes a while to get through a stout. However this one was different. Had all the characteristics of a stout, but much creamier and easier to handle. Never had a milk stout before, but after this I could easily drink this any day!"
"D: haven't had too many milk stout but I have to say it was very drinkable and everything I had hoped for. Another great offering from FFF I'm glad I got to try it cause I had been chasing it for a couple months now."
"D: Smooth drinkability and complex enough that you keep going back for more. Very tasty brew, wish 3F was closer to the west coast!"
"got lucky with this guy. picked up the last one at a dinky liquor store long past it's release date. pours a murky black with a well defined chocolatey, cinnamon colored head. lots of large bubbles slowly bursting leaving decent lace. smells of strong sweet chocolate, raisins, high alcohol burn, warm milk (mmm), and a bit of sour. the taste is creamy yet slippery, with an almost tart sting up front. surprisingly mellow coming from FFF, ending with bitter chocolate lingering on the palate. lots of skim milk like qualities. im a 2% man myself. low low carbonation. finished this one really quickly. very easy to drink, but not as bold as i tend to lean towards."
"D: The aroma didn't do much for me in this case, and while the flavor was enjoyable it wasn't as complex as I like my stouts. Alcohol is noticeably present in the finish as well, which I found strange since this has been sitting in my cellar for a few months already. I definitely enjoyed it for what it is, an easy drinking stout, but probably wouldn't go out of my way to get some again."
"Bottle from Jon. Big coffee lactose aromas. Black with on inch of beige head, and it is lacey. The taste is very lactose,vanilla,some roast, chocolate and then milk finishes. Creamy mouthfeel. The sour milk offsets the lactose sweetness. Somewhat different, of course, from 3F."
"Myself and the gf grabbed a few bottles of this after the recent DL day. I was pretty excited to break in to it as I love sweet stouts. I have to say though I was a little disappointed with his brew in a few aspects. The color was a solid dark brown/black with no light penetration. The smell gives off a sweet molasses smell with some chocolate and coffee notes. The taste is a little dryer than I expected. I thought it would be a little smoother than what it was. There are other milk stouts I would probably order over this but it is definitely drinkable."
"Another Three Floyds winner! Above average in all categories...just wish it was available in my area!!"
"D: This is hands down one of the best stouts, imperial or not, that I've ever had. Incredibly smooth feel, great balance in the taste, and a pleasant nose that isn't overly big on the coffee. Seek this one out as its one of FFF's best."
"Pours a great dark inky color with some very nice foamy head and good lacing throughout. Excellent scent, deep roasted grains with a wonderful sweet undertone; nice light coffee aromas. Great taste, excellent mixtures of flavors; nice roasted grains/coffee flavor with a great sweet tone to it from the milk sugars. Goes down thick and smooth; a great beer."
"Pours black with a brownish head. Aromas of plum, chocolate, and plenty sweet dark malts. Taste is chocolatey with plum, raisin, and sugary lactose. More dark fruits than I was expecting, but it doesn't really go with the sweetness for me. Medium in body, but not as thick as I would like. Decent enough milk stout, but nothing to write home about."
"The Three Floyds Moloko Stout was a terrific surprise. This may very well be my favorite all around tasting stout. It has a sugary composition but almost a milkshake finish. I highly reccomend this beer, its a must try!! Leave it to Three Floyds, I have yet to try a beer from them that didn't completely blow me away, and shock me with its flavor. This Moloko Stout is a desert in liquid form."
"Would I buy more of it? - absolutely. This is a great stout. I want the shirt to commemorate my experience!"
"D: Keep 'em coming. I have had this beer many times, and I'm still pleasantly surprised at how tasty it is. This beer is dangerously slammable."
"Pours very dark brown and appears black in the glass with half-inch of mocha colored head that slowly settles to a thin cap. Moderate amount of spotty lacing is left on the glass. I expected more from a beer in appearance with oats in the recipe. Does not really have a milk/sweet stout aroma. Rather has a more straight up stout aroma of roasted malt with hints of unsweetened chocolate and espresso. I found things to pick up some in the flavor. Nice chocolate notes before the roasted malt takes over. Just semi-sweet overall. Has a nice mocha finish. A good body but nothing outstanding. Lacks just a little texture to take this to the next level as it feels a touch thin. Good flavor, slightly sweet, and a reasonable ABV makes it a nice, drinkable stout. Not big and ballsy but a reasonable effort from 3F."
"This is a phenomenal milk stout from the brewery that turned me on to stouts. It's smokey, sweet, surprisingly well-hopped, and my goodness does it make a Monday bearable. Great balance. Pours like crude, but doesn't fill you up as easily as its looks may tell you. Another home run by the boys from Muenster."
"Mouthfeel is on the heavier side with moderate carbonation. I really enjoyed this milk stout. I can't say I have a lot of experience with the style but so far this is probably the best one I have had. I can definitely see the appropriateness of the naming of this style after having this beer, since it has a lot of milky characteristics."
"D: While not as sweet as many other examples of the style, I enjoyed the roasted and coffee notes this beer provided. The more milk stouts I drink, the more I enjoy them."
"D: Really easy milk stout to drink. One of my favorite of this selection. Another good job by the boys at FFF."
"Leave it to 3F's to pump up the usually mild-mannered milk stout to a 7% style-crusher. Lactose sugars are well matched against the bold roasted malt, lending a creamyness and smooth finish. This is not a style I usually gravitate toward just because most examples are so bland - but this stands out."
"d - good beer but a bit of a disappointment."
"A great tasting beer, but the sweetness is almost overwhelming. Instead of pairing this with dessert, it should BE dessert."
"Overall, this is a very easy beer to drink. The ABV is well covered up and the fundamental components are present and of good quality."
"Pours a dark black in a pint glass,little tiny lactic acid bubbles disappear quickly leaving little or no carbonation at all,this is a delicate stout,its a tad malty lots of roasted malt but a little thin,the mouthfeel is smooth as a silk pie,exceptional mouthfeel separates this from the rest,It seems bottle conditioned almost homebrew like,I could drink a lot of these,its a real easy drinker"
"Three Floyds continues to roll out an excellent line-up of beer."
"Thick and chewy as hell on the tongue. I cant taste the alcohol but I know its working. This one really warms the face and ears almost immediately. A lovely brew to enjoy on a cold winters day (its going to be about 15F tonight). Thanks again Nate!"
"This one poured a dark black with a very unappealing head that really left nothing after a quick coating and then a thin ring. The smell was heavy roasted malts with a sweet milk chocolate dominating everything. The taste was the same with the lactose and chocolate sweetness making this one helluva great milk stout. The mouthfeel was creamy but also slightly oily but not too thin and not too chewy. There was a small amount of heat and the sweetness got to be a bit unbearable towards the end but it was a great example of the style."
"D- This was a very enjoyable beer to sip on. After the first bomber was done I went on to something else and saved my other for a different time. Glad to see it came back out."
"Good drinkability here for 7% ABV though. No alcohol or heat comes through at all. Moloko Plus is a beer that smells fantastic, tastes pretty good, and overall I am glad I got the chance to try it."
"Drinkability: Love this beer, very drinkable!"
"This thing just wasn't what I was hoping for I guess. Still a good beer, but nothing special. Thanks again Dean!"
"Bottle courtesy photomike. Pours deep coffee brown with a thin tan head. Chocolatey and fruity aroma, maybe cherries and also a certain nuttiness. Flavor is similar with chocolate, light roast, a little acidity, marshmallows, milk. Mouthfeel is a little too milky and weird, body is a little thin for the abv. Messy, incohesive, but not offensive."
"Overall: Along w/the drinkability factor, the super sweetness is also paired w/thickness and roastiness which seems too strong for style. This beer just doesn't quite come together for me."
"Served from a 22 oz. bomber bottle. Pours an opaque coffee brown with a moderate head that quickly becomes a thin cocoa colored layer of foam. Aroma conveys deep chocolate and coffee notes, but they are subdued by a prevailing sense of milky smoothness. Taste features a smooth, milky coffee sensation, but it is overpowered by a predominating alcohol presence: it does take away from the overall character of the beer. Mouthfeel is nice and round, but again, it is a bit overwhelmed by the alcohol presence of this beer. Drinkability is also diminished by the overpowering alcohol presence."
"Inky black body. Bubble brown head. Nice rings of lace as I drink. Roast and chocolate on the nose. Really nice flavor. There's a nice note of lactose sweetness on the palate that I didn't get on the nose. Also nice chocolate and roast characteristics. Lightly carbonated and light-medium to medium in body. This one is going down way too easy. I guess it's about 7 % a/v, wihich is a little jacked up for a milk stout, but I don't get any alcohol notes in this either. Good stuff."
"First off, I really appreciate the clockwork orange reference with this beer. Overall this is a pretty tame, and solid, example of the style. It trends a lot towards the more burnt type stout notes, but besides that its well balanced, and shockingly normal for 3 floyds. A good beer, but not anything I would seek out again."
"Pours an opaque black with a brown head. Very little head, and minimal lacing, which is a bit disappointing. The nose is sweet with roasted barley and coffee as well. I really enjoy the taste of this beer. Huge malty sweetness, chocolate, brown sugar, and figs; all balanced by the roasted malt. Nice creamy finish with a bit of coffee as well. Mouthfeel is great, with a light carbonation and creamy, full texture. Good drinkability, very easy to enjoy throughout the night, but not quite as compelling as some. Overall, very enjoyable."
"Drink-This is a wonderfully crafted beer by 3F but as with most of there products it is a bit on the bitter side. Which lately I have grown tired of the overabundance of hops used in beer lately. A year ago I probably would have given this beer a better score. But right now I dont think I would buy this again. I must say though that this style is very similar to a bourbon barrel porter at half the costs. Similar tastes and textures going on."
"Overall another great beer from FFF. These guys sure know how to make a beer."
"Drinkability: Pretty good brew. I would definitely seek this out again and give it another shot. Based on the small head that developed from my pour, I think I may have had one that was sitting for too long. Would have been better with more in the aroma category."
"Drinkability is wicked high. I just wish FFF would cut the bullshit and offer more of their bomber-only beers in six packs. I can't swing $8.50 for a bomber very often, and if I'm gonna drop that much on a bottle, it's likely to be a Belgian."
"This is about as drinkable as it gets for a stout and it is a great beer to cap the night off with."
"Creamy sweetness permeates the palate immediately; this beer is heavy on the lactose sugar, but there's an equally big roasted malt presence to balance it out. They got the sweetness just right here, it's rich but never cloying. Flavors of chocolate caramel, burnt toast and plums appear mid-palate. The body is thick, yet this is surprisingly quaffable. It finishes sweet and roasty, burnt coffee and caramel lingering on the palate. Easy drinking for such a rich beer, this stuff is great."
"Damn FFF for not distributing in Philly...bring it back!"
"D - Very drinkable - not overly sweet, in fact it seems about perfect to me. I really like this one. One bomber would be plenty for one sitting though."
"D: Pretty good, would be nice in cooler weather, but my first sample came in the Spring."
"D: Very mellow and easy to sip"
"This beer about killed me at the brewery - it is that good."
"Poured a dark brown, almost black, with a one finger head that hung in there for a little while. The aroma wasn't much, but I did get a slight alcohol. The taste was sweet coffee and chocolate. The feel was only medium bodied, but oily and very little carbonation. Drinkability was pretty good due to the relative thinness and a not out of control 7.00 ABV. Moloko was a very good tasting milk stout (the best I've had), which suffers because of low smell and feel scores."
"This is one damn fine brew! Highly recommend. No alcohol in taste or aroma. Goes down smooth and easy. Drinkability is high with this one."
"It's pretty solid. I think the Left Hand and Mackeson's are fine efforts too. Very easy to drink. I don't have lots to say about this one, as it's fairly simple. Rare beer for me that I liked markedly more at a colder temp, as sweetness gets a bit much otherwise."
"A vigorous pour raises only a single finger of mocha head over an ink-black surface. The smell is a bit understated: light whiff of sweet taffy, a bit of caramel creme and some earthiness underneath. The oats and lactose addition give this a smooth, creamy mouthfeel with just a bit of carbonation to complement the sweetness to come. The taste starts with a nice blend of subtle mocha and molasses. The lactose note comes in midway, providing just a slight lemon creme flavor that quickly gets beaten into submission by the espresso roastiness that dominates the finish. For me, this is a good thing: I don't like lactose to take center stage as it tends to provide a tart soy note that seems out of place to me. Might just be the best tasting Milk / Sweet stout I've had."
"Another excellent offering from Three Floyds."
"Overall a delicious milk stout that didn't come off too sweet. Not too complex, but certainly another solid offering from FFF."
"D - easy drinking stout, yet plain at the same time so a bit above average."
"Overall, pretty good. Smooth, sweet and raosted with a nice body and mouth feel."
"Drinkability - Give this one awhile, it's a sipper to me. Not all that drinkable, very wet sticky finish."
"Overall a great beer from Three Floyds. I would probably purchase this regularly if I had it available, especially at the price."
"Another good offering from 3F. Perhaps a tad sweeter than some other milk stouts that I have consumed, but it was still very enjoyable."
"D: Extremely easy to drink, due to the non-challenging nature of the brew."
"Smooth & easy-drinking, a very good beer in a style that isn't one of my favorites. Very nice."
"The description on the bottle reads: ""This milk stout is brewed with a portion of golden naked oats and lactose milk sugar to give it a rounded and full-bodied mouth feel. With a deep roasted and slightly sweet maltinesss"""
"Deep dark black liquid out of the bottle with almost no head. Smells of sweat roasty chocolate. Solid body, not too thin or too thick, tastes almost like chocolate milk. It's like drinking dessert. One of my favorite brews from one if my favorite breweries. Great example of the style. Had this one siting in my fridge for almost 8 months and it was well worth the wait, although it is delicious fresh as well."
"Good stuff. It's overall pretty sweet from the chocolate and lactose, but I was pleased to find just enough roasted notes and spicy hops to keep things in check. Tasty and very drinkable for a 7% Stout. Thanks again Joe!"
"From a trade with Erik in Indiana. This poured from the 22 oz bottle a very dark brown with a small head and very robust lacing rings considering how small the head was. Nose of chocolate and coffee, but mild with no burnt notes. Very rich and creamy mouthfeel. Flavor is mild and very pleasant. Amazingly easy to drink. Outstanding. I liked this a lot."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonation is light. Very drinkable even on a Summer evening. Nice little stout. Flavors are interesting and well balanced. Recommended."
"M/D - Medium to full bodied but finishes weirdly thin. Very high carbonation, can almost feel it bubbling in my mouth. Easy drinking."
"Moloko Plus is a pretty damn impressive Milk Stout. I like it quite a bit. It is sweet and gets just a little too sweet as the bottle goes down. But, that's a small gripe as it really does have an excellent flavor. How could it be better? The only things I believe would materially improve it are a little more body and a stronger nose. Those tweaks would improve the overall experience. But, Moloko Plus is a very fine beer that's well worth seeking out as it is. Check it out."
"One more big thanks to sonicdescent for the trade. 22oz bomber. Pours a very dark brown, near black, with a quickly dwindling head. Smell is very robust, thick and deep welcome stouty aromas of chocolate, coffee, and leather. There is a distinct cholocate milk or hot coco flavor to this one. Quite chocolatey and delicious, I wish some of that deep leathery character came through but it's mostly sweet chocolate tones. Still really a tasty treat, and at 7% plenty of flavor. A little lackluster on the palate, could use a little more oomph maybe but as is it is a great, easy drinking stout. Another solid brew from Three Floyds."
"Drinkability is a bit above average; it's not that there's something lowering the drinkability score, it's just that there isn't enough to raise it. Still, I finished the bomber on my own and it never really felt like a chore."
"The body, flavor and sweetness are all too light for this to be truly great. It's not bad."
"Thanks very much to Ding for bringing this bottle back for me from Indiana. I like a good milk stout and there aren't that many of them around. Pours black with a decent head initially that fades to a thin ring. Smells sweet and like burnt sugar- like a good burnt sugar caramel from spain. Smooth and lactic in taste with a nice hint of roastiness and quite a bit of nuttiness. Nice, and not as sweet as some and roastier than most. Absolutely silky in the mouth, with a touch of mouthcoating lactic acid. Very nice."
"Thanks to a nice dude on eBay who hooked me up with this, which I would have otherwise never been able to try, due to the fact that I'm a Pennsylvanian and not a resident of Indiana or Illinois."
"D - This was a very drinkable beer, more of a treat beer for me, and not a sessionable one, but a Stout I would get as much as possible"
"Overall this is a very fine beer put out by a great brewery. Also, Kudos on the bottle artwork, I love it. I would recommend this to stout newbies and veterans alike."
"Hv"
"Thanks to brewCzar for the opportunity to try this one. 650ml bottle served in a standard pint glass. Poured one shade shy of black with a two inch cocoa-colored head that sizzled and popped as it slowly receded to a one inch cap; no lacing on this one. Big cocoa nose gave impressions of chocolate/coffee milk. Taste consistent with nose, but some acidity comes out as well as a creamy character. Mouthfeel fell between light- and medium-bodied, but background carbonation is a little too aggressive. Nonetheless, this is an enjoyable milk stout. Would have been top notch if the carbonation was cut back a little."
"D: Very good! Nice complexities going on and a well rounded beer overall."
"Low to medium carbonation. Super easy to drink, didn't realize this was 7% until I was ready to upload my review, but the second half of the bomber does begin to taste a little stronger. Pretty decent and tasty overall."
"Completely opaque, thick, dark, two finger creamed coffee colored head, and light lacing. Very nice caramel, coffee, vanilla, and chocolate aroma, lightly sweet and roasty. Smells great! Oh boy, taste is very sweet, lots of lactose sugar, roasty coffee flavor follows the sweetness, which is quite nice, along with some chocolate, burnt caramelized sugar, molasses and vanilla notes. This is a very tasty and sweet beer, but the sweetness is a little cloying and there is a bit of sourness in the background. Mouthfeel is thick and viscous, coats the tongue, goes down very smooth with light carbonation. This is a very tasty beer, but again, the sugar is a bit cloying. I'll finish this bomber and will like it, but couldn't see myself drinking any more. Very good stuff."
"The aroma is good except for a touch of cat food. There is also cream, coffee, chocolate, and toasted malt. The appearance is dark brown with a small head. The flavor is like the aroma minus the cat food. The palate is average for the style. Overall it's a nice tasting, quality beer."
"I've had Young's Double Chocolate Stout (C - ) and Bell's Special Double Cream Stout (A) so I have been both disappointed and delighted with the samples tested. Now, this offering from Three Floyds, a 22 ounce bomber purchased for $9.99 at Delock's Liquors in Munster (just a stone's throw from Three Floyds Brewery) is magical from the start--better than even Bell's offering, if that is possible. I don't know much about this style of beer (more an IPA and Wheat beer fanatic) but I love this one from Three Floyds. American-made makes it even better. Appearance is exceptional, as is smell, taste, mouthful and drinkability. I cannot find fault in anything about this beer.. .. Two hours after the initial pour the beer has warmed up considerably and it's even better. So I suggest to pour and then let it sit two or three hours before drinking. It's scrumptious!!"
"Is it possible that this beer is 7 percent? There is no way! There is absolutely no alcohol in the nose or the taste. The flavors are what are prevelant here. Absolutely amazing. Best thing I've had from FFF. Next on the list - Dark Lord!"
"*Taster's Note: Special thanks to ThomasHardy for sharing this bottle."
"D - Don't care for the acid sour. Pretty good other than that."
"A pretty solid, even if somewhat uninspired, interpretation of a milk stout. The lactose sugars definitely dominate, which I don't mind. As with most milk stouts, I'm not really wanting more than a bomber, but it's definitely enjoyable, easy drinking, and inoffensive on the whole. Worth seeking out if milk stouts are up your alley."
"Pours a thick black color, some carbonation, small fizzy tan head, which dissapates quickly, and leaves some sticky lacing. The nose is big and malty, lots of chocolate/toffee. The taste is a malt bomb, sweet, lots of chocolate/toffe, with some coffee tones. Medium body, very chewy. Drinkable, this is an outstanding brew."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" dark brown head above the opaque dark brown/black brew. Head holds on well, with good lasting lace. Aroma is roasty rich dark grains. Taste is sweet dark malts upfront, some lactic sugar in the middle, and closes with an aftertaste that combines it all. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth, and drinkability is good as well."
"Notes: This is a solid sweet/milk stout that offers some good flavors with a nice chocolatey aftertaste, though the big lactose presence becomes a bit too much after awhile. Mouthfeel was kind of a letdown, but overall it's a very sweet, rather simple yet solid brew that's good as a dessert beer. Good looking out for your brother, Joe!"
"My new Favorite Milk Stout."
"Dark brownish/black poured from a 22oz bottle. The nose brings out a sweet, nice smell with coffee/espresso and some roast. A nice burnt sugar flavor with some vanilla, almost a creme bruelle flavor. Pretty tasty beer. Enjoyed at the stouts tasting, second beer of the event...and quite a hit. Thanks Nelson."
"Pretty drinkable at 7% ABV."
"Nice looking black beer with a thin tan head. Just the faintest red tinge around the edges. Not much in the lace category. Smell of bakers chocolate and coffee notes. A little more punch than I would expect in a milk stout. Taste matches the smell with tons of milk chocolate note. I never thought I would say this about a Three Floyds brew but this one is a little thin on the mouth. This is a good beer that never gets over the hump to great. This has to be the least favorite of all the Three Floyds beers I've had. Again, it's not bad, just dosn't live up to the high standard they've established."
"Easily my favorite of this style so far. Wish I could get FFF in this area as they live up to the hype."
"22oz. Nice black pour with a small amount of cream colored head. Strong aromas of coffee, bakers chocolate. Good roasted flavors of the same, along with roasted malts. Pleasant, somewhat creamy mouthfeel, but could be more full bodied. Finishes with a faint lingering sweetness, but clean. If their intention was to create a drinkable summer stout, I'd say they accomplished that. I think this is a pretty good sweet stout, but not as good as the Bells or Rogue offerings. I think 3F might be given a bit too much credit in it's other brews based on the reputation of the Dark Lord. The 2 I've had of their's(neither Dark Lord) have been a bit of a let down based on the hype for the brewer."
"courtesy of sir lou, the dirty"
"Pours a midnight black with a half finger tan colored head that quickly falls to just about nothing, and this after an aggressive pour. Not much in terms of lacing etiher. Smell consists of milky chocolate, caramel, and Whoppers. Some coffee and smoke in the nose as well, but the aroma is really about the sweet malts. Taste begins with sweet vanilla, chocolate, and toasted almonds. Midway the roasted flavors emerge with a touch of cream. Aftertaste has a good dose of coffee and sugar with some earthy hops in there as well. Full body with a thick and creamy feel, covers the mouth very well. Soft and subtle carbonation that fits well with the style. Definitely one of the better Sweet Stouts that I've had and it improves nicely with some warmth. Thanks again to Joe and Greg for this 3F brew!"
"My expectations where met with a very good stout that is one of the top rated active bottled beers for style."
"recived this from secret santa 08, poured into my duvel tulip glass, poured a rich black that at its thinest point as a glass is tiped back has a hint of red to it, a great 3 finger tan head rose to the top and stayed for a few seconds befor becoming a light lacing around the rim. the smell is a sweet coffie smell with no hop to speek of, the taste is coffiee, bitter choclate, molassas and a hint of hop at the after taste, the mouthfeal is creamy like cream ale only better as this is black, this is a great beer, i would love to try one of these in the middle of summer as an alturnative to lawnmower beers"
"Poured into my Duvel tulip glass a dark brown color with about an inch of ecru colored head. Smells of sweet milk chocolate, roasted grains, and coffee. Tastes of milk and dark chocolate, mocha coffee, caramel, and vanilla. Slightly thin body with medium carbonation. A very tasty version of a milk stout. Certainly worth a try if you see it."
"D - This is a really good milk stout. It was sweet but not overly sweet and relatively easy drinking despite the style and ABV."
"D - Overall, another solid offering from FFF. I have to say that the flavor profile stands up to the moniker of it's not normal as i haven't had that kind of experience with a milk stout before. Great MF and decent nose to it. Happy I picked up a bottle."
"A very tasty sweet stout. Highly recommended! Thanks again Dan!"
"D: A nice milk stout from FFF, really goes after that lactose character, I'm glad I tried it."
"If I ever see it on tap, I may give it another go 'round. Other than that, it was nice to try, good to drink, but I'll probably not get it again in the future. Although on second thought, I'll more than likely get next years release just out of curiosity. Overall impression: good, but not great."
"D-Simply awesome....I wasn't sure what to expect with this one but why would I think FFF would make a dud? Simply one of the most chocolatey, silkiest smooth beers I have ever had the opportunity to imbibe."
"D: wow. that should sum it up. I do prefer other milk/sweet stouts, but this is up there for me. great flavors, wonderful aroma and a very relaxing when it comes to drinkability."
"Somehow this beer is a bit simplistic. I expect a greater malt complexity in both the flavor and the aroma; in the case of the flavor that lactose seems to drown out a lot of notes that might otherwise be noticeable. Not bad, but a bit bland."
"""Roasted peanuts... I'm tellin' ya!"""
"Damn good Milk Stout. Not as intensely sweet as some others. Mackeson's is pretty much my benchmark for this style and though this doesn't quite have the character of XXX, it makes up in drinkability. Maybe that last time I had it my palate was off, but I definitely am enjoying this more three months later."
"Pours a deep black with a thin tannish head. Aroma is surprisingly dry with, roast, chocolate, nutty and lactose. The Flavor boasts plenty of chocolate malt, lactose and a fair amount of hops (it is 3 Floyds!). Finishes more sweet and somewhat long. Medium to full body, creamy texture."
"Drinkability is high. It's very tasty, and well made IMO. Easy to consume, and a pleasure to do so."
"I bought this 22oz bottle at Big Red Liquor in Bloomington, IN."
"Drinkability - the abv is totally hidden. I could drink another bomber without much problem, but I think I'd tend to seek a milk stout with a creamier, fuller body."
"Drinkability: Dastardly good, very drinkable at 7% abv."
"I picked up this bottle at Southwest Liquors in Chicago last week for $6.99. The beer is dark brown and opaque, and a vigorous pour gave 2 fingers of tan foam that lasted maybe 2-3 minutes. The smell is roasty, chocolaty and sweet, maybe I can imagine some lactate (probably not there). The taste is sweet, very chocolaty and roasty, delicious. Worth the time it takes to find this, a very good interpretation by 3F, with no overkill hops. Not that more hops would be bad."
"Overall, a very good milk stout, and worth picking up."
"An interesting take on a stout. The sweetness is surprising but works well for the beer. It's not as thick as the dark opaqueness suggests and is surprisingly drinkable at 7%. Definitely get notes of chocolate and malt. Creamy and medium body."
"Floyd, Floyd and Floyd will always be one of my favorite breweries, even if they overprice their beer. Unfortunately, Moloko Plus is not one of their better efforts. If you want a kick-ass stout, my droogies, go with Black Sun or Dark... something or other. I forgot what it's called."
"Thanks, kirok1999, for the opportunity"
"Pours the color of motor oil with a HUGE foamy dark brown head that fades fairly quickly. Spotty patterns of Belgian lacing left behind. The smell is aggressive and really rich and chocolaty suggesting a very heavy mouthfeel. Full bodied, the mouth is fabulously creamy. Its going down way too fast and easy...and i'm splitting this one with my son. The flavor is chocolaty and malty. It coats like my favorite Double Stouts. My previous samples of style must have used lactose because i had more of a sense of heated milk that you make for hot cocoa. Not so much with this one. The sweet chocolate is the big player with this one. At 7% ABV i could drink these all night long!! Especially since my understanding is that this is the 'diet version'...yeah right! There are some serious quality ingredient at work inside. Another fine FFF product! Highly recommended."
"This is a style I need to explore further. Great introduction, and quite a find out here in California. Stan is the man."
"D: very filling and satisfying beer, probably wouldn't want to drink more than one or two of these at a time."
"Oh bliss! Bliss and heaven! Oh, it was gorgeousness and gorgeousity made flesh. It was like a bird of rarest-spun heaven metal or like silvery wine flowing in a spaceship, gravity all nonsense now. As I slooshied, I knew such lovely pictures!"
"D - Not as good as I remember it at the brewpub in years past before they released bottles."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, I don't usually go for this style but this is a good stout to drink for a long time."
"I found this to be very easy to drink. The alcohol is practically unnoticed and I really enjoyed the flavor profile. I had to make a conscious effort to slow down."
"D- Surprisingly tasty. A very easy drinking stout considering the ABV. I wish I would've gotten more of this."
"Very high on the medium mouthfeel scale, it's lightly carbonated and finishes semi sweet and has a good fairly long lasting aftertaste. Easy drinking and very smooth on the palate, I like this style a lot when done right.. this is another goodie from Three Floyds!"
"22 oz. bomber. Have been looking forward to trying this, and wonder how 3F will interpret a milk stout. Pours pitch black with a 2 finger dark tan head, which quickly dissipates and leaves almost no lacing. This is a little low on alcohol compared to their typical big brews so I expected the head to last longer for the style. Overall, though, I am quite happy with the purchase. Smells a little like a boozy milkshake made with chocolate syrup. Taste is like the smell, only with more roasty notes and little alcohol flavor. Still a bit of a sipper, and a pleasure to drink on a cold November night. Once again, well done, Three Floyds."
"However, FFF does the style justice as I would like to try this on tap. SL Binny's here I come!"
"D- Easy to drink."
"Overall, I am now a big fan of milk stouts. I loved the creamy texture that this beer produced. Combine this with a gentle sweetness and it makes for one great experience."
"Medium body, low carbonation. Good balance. Alcohol is very well hidden. Easy to drink, and very enjoyable."
"Not one of my favorites from tripFloyds. A bit too much of a tart cream flavor. A big subtraction to some otherwise nice qualities."
"D: I had to tell myself to slow this one down. I felt like I was racing through it. Very rewarding and worthy of a year round spot in their line-up."
"Overall: mmm"
"Pretty easy to drink, a nice one to sip on while contemplating the 08 election results"
"Onyx black with a brown coffee colored ring at the edge of the liquid, tan almost mocha foam. Light whiff of cocoa, pretty mild. Milk chocolate, hershey kiss type chocolate mostly, with vague underpinnings of tobacco leaf. Taste brings more of the same, lightly chocolatey bittersweetness. Slightly dry and earthy (hop?), but there isn't much residual taste on cask. Sort of thin, don't mind the lack of carb, but it feels like it needs more body to hold up. Goes down pretty easy, but it didn't hold my attention enough to have two."
"pours a solid deep dark brown with a moderate head of milky tan. smell is balanced; sweet and malty. nice density: light carmel malt qualitys. sweet yet somehow fruity. a light acidity, not lactic but cirtrus from the hops. subtle tart in lactose. as it gets warmer then seems to have a caramel apple quality. very interesting... not the milkiest but quite good."
"Overall: A really good beer...not super great, but one I would definitely purshase again."
"D - easy to drink."
"Decent, but not special."
"The only real downfall for this beer is that it's far too thin and lacking in carbonation for something packing this much flavor. Otherwise, this is a damned tasty brew and one I will certainly purchase again, especially at a reasonable (for 3F's) price."
"drinkability: good"
"One of the better milk stout I remember drinking. Nice roastiness, heavy cream, dark chocolate, fugde, creamy mouthfeel, black fruits on the finish. Good mouthfeel and great drinkibility. Drinks nothing like 7%"
"D: The lighter nature of this drink and the delicious flavor make it a delight to drink. I am biased because I love stouts but I would be happy to drink this stuff until the cows come home. I believe Michael Jackson said that Milk Stouts were ""soothing and restorative"". I think that this brew is a great example of that measure."
"D: Very drinkable and enjoyable during the colder months of the year. Yet another great offering from Three Floyds!"
"All in all, a nice offering from the guys at FFF's. I will definitely have this one again and again. I liked it."
"D: a bomber of this will be no problem, however, a bit sweet for more than that"
"Dark colored black beer with a small tan head. Nose of chocolate, roast, sugar and mocha, complex. As with almost all 3 Floyds beers, they nailed it. Was expecting a hoppy, out of balance beer, but it's a complex, well balanced beer with lots of malt depth. Creamy, with dessert-like malts. Very nice ale."
"Easy to drink, but a touch cloying after a while."
"d: Flows down like a glass of chocolate milk. A boring un-original review? Perhaps. But seriously, this is how it looks, smells, tastes and feels. I promise."
"Maybe a little sweeter then I usually like but definitely something I'll be drinking again and recommending to others."
"D= Though I know that this is bigger than a run of the mill milk stout, yet I still consider this my new standard for the style. Its drinkability is dangerously high!!!"
"Taste is coffee up front, smooth and sweet. The sweetness comes out as it warms up a bit and the coffee note fades. Lightly carbonated and very easy to sip. A fine example of a milk stout, the coffee and chocolate blend very well."
"D: Very drinkable given the lighter body relative to other stouts and a somewhat manageable abv. Wish this stuff was easier to get for a West Coast guy (then again, wish all Three Floyds was)"
"D: Tasty and decently easy to drink. Another good offering from FFF. And it was only $7 at WSL.... by fucking far the cheapest I've ever seen a FFF. Maybe a pricing error?"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and rather smooth. For a stout this has solid drinkability as it is not too heavy. Overall, it's an enjoyable milk stout, maybe just a touch too sweet for me though. A bomber would be more than enough and I shared this one with the girlfriend. Worth a try, but I wouldn't go out of my way."
"D: This is very easy to drink, this bomber should go in no time."
"D: This is a great sweet stout from 3F but getting through the whole bottle really takes some effort due to the huge heavy sweetness. Still, very tasty."
"Pours a very dark brown in color with a bit of a brown head. Smell is roasty, with some coffee notes. There is a really good roasted coffee and chocolate flavor in the mouth. This is unlike any other sweet/milk stout I've ever had. I'm not usually into sweet/milk stouts, but this one is great. Very creamy and full on the mouthfeel. This is a very good beer, and it isn't overhopped in the typical FFF way. Very well done FFF, very well done."
"This beer pours a dark black with just some light brown accents when held up to the light. A very thin brown head appeared only for a few seconds before it dissipated into nothing. The nose on this beer hits pretty well upfront with roasted grain, vanilla, coffee, and bitter chocolate. The flavor profile starts with the lactose sweetness on first sip and quickly balanced out by the chocolate/coffee-like malt. As the beer warmed I got just a touch of dark fruit in the background. The mouthfeel is full bodied and very creamy with plenty of sweetness after the swallow as well. The drinkability at only 7% is really nice, and would be a good entry point for people that may not like stouts. I personally really enjoyed this stout."
"D-This beer is smooth and creamy with a big dark malt flavor that is supported by a nice tartness for balance. Very easy to drink."
"This is the best milk stout I've had to date. To be totally honest I expected a quality beer but nothing like this. I picked up a couple of these for trades and only one for myself. I'll be off to the store tomorrow to remedy that problem. Pick this up if you see it!"
"Easy to drink, and like most stouts not too bubbly so it goes down kinda quick, definitely not a beer you need a fork and knife for.. Good balanced flavor for whats popular these days (coffee, chocolate, milk, oats). I really dig this one - not a session beer but a great to session with. I didn't expect much from this with the c'est super cool label (and I love the Three-Floyds labels) but this one turned out to be pretty good stuff."
"D: Great! A bit sweet (but personally not a bad thing for me), but other than that, this is definitely not a chore to drink. It's great tasting and goes down easy."
"Thanks to David Eddie for the sample."
"Hey hey, this is a good beer! Pours a good, deep black and yields almost no head. Smells of subtle chocolate and roasted malt. One whiff and you know this is a well balanced brew. This tastes excellent. Nice, sweet chocolaty tongue with just a hint of bitterness. mouthfeel is a little light but leaves no aftertaste and is very well rounded. Easily drinkable. It's so nice to share with a friend....if you can!"
"On a sad note, I believe this beer is replacing the Alpha Kong, which was one of my favorite beers, despite the price. The Moloko had big shoes to fill, and although it did not fill them, it is still a respectable effort."
"Drinkability- Well usually when I review a beer about ½ to ¾ of my beer is gone when I finish my review. My entire first glass is gone and about ½ of my second is as well. So I'm going to say drinkability is pretty good. I'm glad this brew isn't overly sweet and it drinks nicely. Another winner from 3 Floyds!"
"D: At 7% for a stout of this quality, it really could convince this IPA fan to switch over to stouts."
"Drinkability: Highly downable. I will be sad when I finish this bottle, and wishing that Three Floyds would expand its distribution."
"Another great brew from Three Floyds."
"D: I think I was just a bit let down by this beer. I went in expecting something different than what came out in the end. Not bad, just a bit one dimensional in my opinion."
"Drink: You could knock back wuite a bit of these which is a nice feat for a 7% stout."
"D ~ Well balanced. Very pleasant & approachable. If Stouts or more specifically Milk Stouts are your preference this is a must try. An interesting detour from Three Floyds trademark hop profiles. I'm gonna pick up a few more before they're gone."
"Overall, a great milk stout to get. I wonder if the bottles even compare?"
"D- not my favorite three floyds beer, but something i enjoyed. glad i was able to pick this one up. wouldnt want more than one in a sitting."
"Mouthfeel is light and smooth, I like it."
"Overall: I love a good milk stout and this is just that. Big on taste and aroma. It goes down so smooth, that you are begging for another. This is a 3 Floyd's masterpiece. Man do I love their brews."
"On tap at the Three Floyds Brewpub, on the nitro-tap. This stout poured a dark brown color with a thick, creamy tan head that lasted forever. The aroma of this stout was very faint roasted malts with some milk chocolate. The flavor was of soft milk chocolate and mild roasted chocolate malts. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied with a creamy, nitro carbonation. This stout had excellent balance, and the heavier alcohol was very well hidden behind the other flavors. Another excellent beer from Three Floyds!"
"Big creamy mouthfeel with a thickness on the palate that is very appetizing and decadent. Low carbonation creates some of the heaviness. Really pleasing."
"A very dark opaque brown color with a small fleating tan head and some lacing. Smells somewhat of roasted nuts and smoke but mostly it was lactose and half & half that I got. Taste went the same way. A bit of a smokyness to it and a nutty base but it was just so strong in the lactose. Quite sweet, too sweet really. And I agree with Hobo, lots of vanilla seemed to be in here. Reminiscent of Mackeson but not quite as good from what I remember of Mackeson. Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for this and I would love to try it again. This was a Milk Stout to the extreme and I credit the brewers but I don't know if doing some styles to the extreme always works."
"Smell was a dry, milky, vannilin zucker. Flavor was a good dry cream, but no acidity. Something I've unfavorably noticed in some cream stouts. Very smooth roasted malts silky swimming down my gullet."
"Poured black, could see some red around the edges, and had a thick tan head that laced the entire way down the glass. Smelled of vanilla, my un beery friend said it smelled like a fruit rollup. Taste was of roasty malts, some coffee and I thought, an intense vanilla. The sweetness was intense in this brew, and made me a little sick to my stomach. As good as I thought it was, I do not know if I can ever have another one again."
"Update in 2011: I've found bottles of this stuff in northwest indiana liquor stores. The bottles are just as good as the growler. As I sip, I can't believe it is an 8% brew. Talk about hiding the alcohol! I also noticed some cocoa in the nose, and, mmm - oop, it's gone now!"
"I dunno. Amazing beer, and many thanks to Flip for sharing at our private tasting..."
"Color was black with bits of ruby showing through at the verrrry edges and a thin cocoa-colored head. I could not get much from smelling the beer, perhaps some sweet roastiness. But the taste was phenomenal and complex with toasted marshmallows, coconut milk, smoke, perhaps even a little dark chocolate coming through. This really is a sweet beverage. This was very easy to drink and felt nice on the palate. I would not hesitate to purchase this if it were available in bottles."
"-UF"
"On tap at the brewery. Milk chocolate and espresso aroma. Pitch black with fine brown head. Tastes like a chocolate malt. Very full bodied and sticky. Reminds me of a Irish Car Bomb. If you are not familiar, get a pint of stout, and drop a shot of Irish Cream in it, the chug. The difference is that I didnt chug this, and it was much more enjoyable."
