"Pretty good coffee stout. Not bad for an everyday offering."

"O: I know there is not a difference really in a stout and a porter but if I were to define it I'd say this would be a porter more than a stout.  I think the thin mouthfeel would classify it as such for me and with a stout it'd be thicker...overall it's a good beer especially if your looking for a coffee stout.  i'm not disappointed and have really wanted to try this but there are better representations of this style on the market.  Alewerks does produce some really good beer and I would pick those over this in their line-up."

"O: Overall a pretty good beer, but I don't think that is has the chew or richness I really want in the style."

"Overall:  This is a good beer!!  It has great flavors of malt and coffee, nicely balanced with some good sweetness.  Very nice!"
"Strong taste of fresh roasted coffee served best at room temperature.  Wonderful expresso aftertaste."
"Wonderful, full bodied flavorful beer with a great taste from beginning to end."
""
"Pours a deep chocolate color with minimal head and lacing. Aroma is nice with hints of coffee and bittersweet chocolate. Taste is slightly milder than I anticipated, with tastes of lightly roasted coffee and some chocolate. Mouthfeel is slightly thin and watery which I have found a lot in milk stouts. Overall, a nicely flavored beer with the good creaminess and mouthful of a milk stout.."
""
""
""

"O: Very easy to drink and it has a low enough ABV to be just about sessionable. I really enjoy coffee beers and this one did not disappoint. Definitely glad that I found it and got the opportunity to try it - and will gladly get it again in the future."

"Pretty decent brew. Full flavored and easy drinking."
""
""
""
"O- A bit disappointed since the aroma and feel are both there but the flavor just does not deliver.  I'm actually starting to believe that the house yeast might be at fault here since I've had similar experiences with other beers of theirs."

"Overall, a great cream stout and one I enjoy having every year. The notes really feeel and taste like a nice cup of coffee."
"It's a good milk stout in my realm, a style I am not usually a fan of. But it's not overly sweet, has a good waffery light cookie quality, and chocolate hints. Strangely though of all the things it should hint at, coffee isn't one of them. But I don't care, it drinks well either way."

"Overall this is a good beer, I was expecting as much sweetness since it was labeled as a coffee stout. It is classified correctly as a milk sweet stout, I believe it would be a much better beer with a touch more coffee."
"O- The smell on this one was deep and complex. The flavor seemed to linger on for a really long time. I could drink this one again, but I wouldn't rank it as outstanding. Just a good solid above average beer."
"O- you don't see a lot of coffee flavored milk stouts, but I think that this one worked well. The sweetness of the milk stout mixes nicely wight he bitterness of the coffee"
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Very nice coffee milk stout that brings a nice sweetness on the backend. Nice VA local beer."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz """pint""" glass. Pours pitch black with a tiny brown head. Smells of coffee and more coffee, and slight raisin. Tastes of coffee with slight fruit taste, such as grapes. Beer is a tad over carbonated but light bodied and finishes well. Overall a good beer."
""
""
""

"Bottle as an awesome extra in trade. Thanks! First Virginia rate pours black with a small light brown or off white head. Huge coffee aroma just like a cup o' joe, some lactose like sweetness, a little cocoa, roasted malts. Mmmm. Flavor is very espresso forward, some lactose sweetness to balance out the super earthy bitter coffee, light chocolate and roast. This is sweet but nicely integrated with the earthy espresso. Loving the coffee and lactose sugar combo. Medium mouthfeel on the thinner side (not a knock, as this isn't an impy--plus I burned the shit out of my mouth today so it may be the carbonation on the burns that make it feel thinner as it is super smooth and rich on my lips and given the low ABV this has a nice body going on) with a nice velvety mouthfeel. There is some nice prickly carbonation on this."
""
""
""
"Dark brown pour - nearly black - with a mid-sized, creamy, taupe head. Excellent mocha aroma with a generous measure of vanilla. Medium-bodied and creamy with lazy carbonation. The flavor is a sweet medley of coffee, chocolate crème and vanilla. Bittersweet mocha finish. It is a little thin but a solid representation of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Despite somewhat lower scores, I see this beer as a session beer. Relatively low ABV for style and easy to drink. I could happily go through several of these in an evening."
""
""
""
"Strong aroma of coffee and chocolate malt. Some cream and roasted malt chime in as well. In the taste, coffee bean and vanilla cream. Mild leafy hop flavor and bitterness. Mostly like a good iced coffee, getting some mocha from this. Medium bodied feel, medium carbonation with waning retention. Overall, this is an enjoyable coffee beer I will have again."
"I really enjoyed the flavor. One try and I was hooked. During a one week visit I Enjoyed two samples and two pints. As I only drink on occasion this is my limit. Wanted to take a growler home and would have if I wasn't traveling so far. I will definitely be looking for a way to get more."

"Overall- I would give it a B-, Pretty good overall beer, the only deficiencies I felt were the mouth feel and I would have liked to have had a little more head retention. Very Drinkable"
""
""
"O: silky texture makes this so easy going down with a roasty freshness makes this a must try."
""
""
""
"12oz bottle purchased at the brewery. This is a little different - a coffee stout that tastes like actual coffee - not roasted espresso aromas, but the bitter, eye opening drip coffee taste. It makes for a nice change of pace from big, high abv stouts, and there is a decent amount of residual sweetness to balance out the bitter. Dark (surprise!) coffee color, light lacing. High points for originality but not necessarily a world-changer."
""
""
""
"O- good coffee stout. I could drink a lot of these in a sitting with the combination of low abv, coffee and chocolate."
""
"mouthfeel is a hair thin but still substantial enough. A very pleasant drink."
""
""
"Overall I may have had better impressions with a fresh batch since this was bottled on 1/13. A few months may have really impacted the deep coffee flavor that MIGHT have been in this beer. May try it again sometime down the road."
""
""
"I like my coffee black and my beer to have a decent malt presence, so coffee stouts are generally right in my wheelhouse. This one makes a fine but common first impression, with the pour producing a deep, nearly-black brown color, but it is topped by only a fine wisp of a coffee-foam head. The aroma drastically improves my expectations, with a rich, roasty, iced-coffee aroma over more subtle notes of bittersweet cocoa and caramel malts. The flavor lets me down, though, by being surprisingly sweet compared to the aroma, with a heavy caramel malt backbone that overwhelms the roast and coffee characteristics. The texture likewise detracts, with a low-level of carbonation that results in a moderately syrupy feel that further enhances the sweetness. Overall, the beer showed promise, but the over-sweetness and under-carbonation were harmful flaws to the experience."
"Nice coffee tones. More of a mellow ride than a blast in the mouth. Consistent, which I appreciate, since a lot of coffee beers seem to drop off too quickly. Feels good going down, though the carbonation was a bit excessive at certain points. Nice drinker. Liked this one."
""
""

"Black with a very fine point rim of light tan foam, black mirror atop otherwise. Smells of coffee, cocoa, more coffee and pretty much just cold coffee. Flavor is coffee, soil, some bitterness, a little bit of bread, some bits of unsweetened chocolate. Medium bodied with hi carb and an off dry finish; a little less body and a little much carb for the style. Overall decent, quite a bit of coffee which makes it one dimensional."

"O - This is a very satisying milk stout that I'll have again. Another solid offerring from Aleworks."
""
""
"O: Pretty solid. Once I realized this wasn't designed to be a coffee-bomb FBS killer, I could appreciate its subtleties a lot more thoroughly. Hardly my favorite coffee beer, but good enough where I'd considering getting a 6 pack of in the future."
""
""
"The best milk stout I have ever tasted after Ma Kesson's Triple Stout from England was retired. Very smooth and no bitter aftertaste. The coffee from Guatemala is an excellent choice to flavor this coffee stout along with the cocoa flavor. Not too high of an alcohol content either...just right. Excellent!"
""
""
"O: Very good coffee stout – not overpowering with the coffee, but rather blended in nicely."
"I had been looking to buy some new stouts to try and a friend of mine told be to pick this one up, I wasn't terribly impressed. A very average to good stout. If your looking for something a little different don't look here. A little flat when it came to taste and feel, they could do better by adding something to give it more of a kick. Thin with almost no head, and I couldn't really taste any of the coffee notes, it was more sour than sweet. AVERAGE is the key word."
""
""
""
""
"I'm a fan of coffee stouts and this one, although passable, is not in the upper tier of this style."
""
""
""
""
"this is an excellent stout. great tasting and goes down TOO easy!"
"Overall a solid coffee stout, I can't say I've every had a coffee milk stout. Nice"
""
"7.9/10"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If you aren't a coffee fan, i wouldn't recommend this beer...."
""
""
""
""
"Not bad, coffee was pretty subdued except in the aroma. I actually like the lactose/milk chocolate notes better than the coffee."
""
"O: Guatemala needs to be noted by craft breweries who want to pump out a sweet and savory coffee stout. The antigua coffee beans put a new characteristic into this brew that is hard to parallel. Its one of my favorite light stouts on the market and the bonus factor goes to that its only an hour from me. Keep pumping out the stouts, AleWerks...they far surpass anything else you make."
""
"Fuller medium body, decent carbonation, creamy and silky on the tongue. Pretty impressive for a milk stout, especially with the coffee adding a completely new dimension to the profile. I'll definitely be drinking this again."
"Overall, this is a solid stout that is worth a look at $10 a six pack."
""
""
""
"O: I really liked this one and it makes me anxious to try to the cafe royale. Definitely would recommend if you are into milk stouts."
""
"O- Not a bad coffee stout. I like it pretty well for a lower ABV stout. First beer I have enjoyed from this brewery. Of course, I have yet to taste Cafe Royale..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not a bad beer, but not particularly memorable. Easy to drink, could use a little bit more coffee flavor if it's calling itself a coffeehouse stout."
""
""
"O: This is no doubt the best low abv-less than 7% abv- coffee stout I've had to date. It tastes like a mini breakfast stout with a milkier body. Outstanding."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A nice coffee Stout. Recommended."
"Medium bodied with medium carbonation; slightly smooth and creamy. Decent enough mouthfeel, not too big though. I really enjoyed this beer, primarily the aroma and first tasting, but was left feeling like it could have been better. Again, the flavor seems to vanish too quickly leaving you wanting something more. A definite recommendation for coffee fans, though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Glad I got to try another Williamsburg beer, I can't thank Hanzo enough."
"O: A good milk stout. Coffee is very strong in the aroma but more balanced in the flavor. Sweet as it should be, but nicely balanced with some more bitter flavors."
""
""
""
"This brewery has made another casked real-ale called """Choco-Latte""" that blew this one out of the water, hope they begin to brew it regularly."
""
"o: not a bad beer at all. Definitely an enjoyable milk stout, though not my favorite. I would love to try this again some time next to some of my favorites."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Just for fun, I mixed a little half & half in with the last couple of ounces, like I would with a strong cup of coffee; it actually helped..."
""
"Overall a very drinkable evening beer that can be enjoyed well into the spring, especially for all of you fellow devout stout fans."
"All in all a decent beer to kick back and relax to, without having to overthink anything about the beer. One was plenty for me. Glad to tick another brewery."
"This is among the best I've had in the style, if not the best. With Cafe Royale selling out so quickly, it's nice to have this beer available as well, since it actually sits on the shelves for a couple weeks/months during the winter."
"I'd like to see the brewer pump this offering up into a double - it would have the potential to be outstanding if Williamsburg kicked it up a notch."
"Seek this out with haste."
""
"Mouthfeel is full-bodied and moderate carbonation. Overall this is quite drinkable and really really good. Williamsburg Alewerks surprises me again (first surprise was their Pumpkin Ale) with another solid beer."
"O: A pretty decent coffee stout overall. It smells great, though the flavor doesn't quite match up to the aroma. Still, it's an enjoyable and drinkable beer."
""
""
""
"Overall: If you're looking for a coffee-forward beer, I would say that this one is slightly above average. The mouthfeel was too thin for me and detracted overall."
""
""
""
""
"O - I have enjoyed every brew that I've tasted from Williamsburg AleWerks and this one continues that trend. While the taste and feel of this beer are solid, the smell is definitely the highlight for me. I have never been one to drink coffee, but I don't think I could ever get sick of this aroma. This is a beer that I will certainly try again, and one that's getting me excited to try another AleWerks offering - Cafe Royale."
""
"The beer is a really deep opaquee brown/black. The smallish head is mocha colored and substaining to a degree. Aroma is rich black coffee beans, roasted malts and hints of cream from the lactose probably. Maybe some bittersweet chocolate. The sweetness of the lactose in this milk stoudt help to mellow out the acidic bitterness. I like that the coffee essence smells like fresh roasted coffee beans instead of black coffee. Richly roasted malts add to the flavor as well as a milky creaminess. It drinks smooth with a velvetty thickness. Pretty good beer more towards a sipper or desert say with a creame burlee."
""
""
"O: Sweet and easy drinking with plenty of coffee notes to go around. This is an excellent Sweet Stout!"
"A decent session ale for those who like their stouts sweet and also like coffee. This could go well in a vanilla milkshake or with some muffins (blueberry would be interesting for some flavor contrast)."
""
""
"O: Overall I think it's a pretty good beer...it tastes more like coffee than anything. Unfortunately it feels over-carbonated but that's about it. I would probably drink it again, but it's a toss-up. It tastes more like a coffee stout than it did last year, but it has a soda-like carbonation which makes it hard to drink."
"O: A solid, likeable, drinkable beer."
"Really overall it's pretty good, but could use a little """more""". I would buy a sixer, probably would be a nice warm weather dark brew."
"I don't know a ton about coffee, but I do know my palate, and these harsh coffee stouts do not agree with me. Maybe a different batch would be better, especially because I have liked all of the other Williamsburg stuff that I have tried."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer says coffee, smells of coffee, and tastes of coffee. My love of coffee may have me biased to think highly of this beer, but wow, i really like it. I truly wish i had bought more than one bottle. I will definitely drink more of this."
"T/M: burnt malts and strong coffee. Honestly, I find it kind of watery in the mouthfeel though and too thin to hold its own."
"O - Man, this is a damn tasty beer! I'm seriously impressed, and this is the first brew I've ever tried by Williamsburg Alewerks. I'll be sure to try some of their other beers in the next few weeks. 4.5"
""
""
"O: This is a very high quality, fairly low octane, coffee brew that is definitely amongst the best I've tried in its style class. Nicely done!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's nice. Not off-the-wall or outstanding, but definitely nice. Decent for the price point, too."
"O: This is a pretty good stout. The nose, taste, and carbonation are well balanced. The mouthfeel could be a bit heavier, but it doesn't detract. It has a pleasant appearance. Over, it's a good beer. I will buy this one again."
"delicious. I wish it had a touch more coffee to it, and a touch less sweet. but I like my coffee black, not loaded with cream and sugar. so maybe that's why I'm not completely sold. That being said, I'd definitely seek this one out if I could."
"The mouth feel is pretty smooth there is very little carbonation. It is surprisingly drinkable do to the lower alcohol and very well balanced flavors."
"D - Very tasty and an easy drinker. Probably the best I've had from the AleWerks and definitely one that I think could compete at a national level."
"Poured a dark brownish black with a small tannish head. Pretty standard coffee stout aroma: dark malts, coffee, dark chocolate. Basic coffee stout taste as well, following the aroma, with roasty malts, coffee, slightly bitter, creamy sweetness. Not quite full-bodied, but still nice and smooth, and very drinkable. Good selection."
"D: I was pleasantly impressed with this beer and would definitely seek it out again. Of the two bottles I bought, there was a noticeable amount of variation. The first was spectacular while the second was only above average. Maybe it was something I ate on the day of the latter."
"Pours a near black color with quick rush of bubbly brown head, gone quickly leaving little spots. Smell combined notes of spent coffee grounds and melted semi-sweet and milk chocolate - not the best notes individually but pleasant. Taste brings an initial dry and roasty coffee character but it is quickly covered up by notes of mocha and chocolate fudge. Fuller side of medium bodied, solid creamy feeling combines with a light powdery quality. A nice sweet stout with some quality flavor notes."
"Overall a solid coffee beer. Definitely worth trying, though if you can afford it Bells Java and FBS are going to be much better options for the coffee beer lover."
"Pours an opaque black with a 1/2 inch dark tan head that fades to an oily film on the top of the beer. Random spots and streaks of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of rich chocolate syrup, chocolate bars, and slight coffee aromas. Taste is of chocolate covered espresso beans covered in chocolate syrup. A nice roasted coffee bean bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. The mouthfeel is a bit thin with a low level of carbonation. Overall, this is a pretty good stout but the mouthfeel is a bit lacking. Still glad I got to try this one though."
"12oz bottle from grape & gourmet. pours slightly thick and utterly black as night with a thin, light beige head and sheet lacing. aroma blew me away. huge dark roasted coffee, praline, cocoa, and a hint of dark fruit. flavor was amazing as well and truly matched the aroma. tastes of rich black coffee, dark chocolate, sweet caramel, and hints of vanilla,with a lingering bitter coffee finish. mouthfeel is thin and a bit watery which is the only true knock on this beer. overall, a delicious brew. like a poor-mans breakfast stout. Geoff is certainly doing solid work at AleWerks and if this one is any indication, i can’t wait for the new brewmasters series. *UPDATE* new batch from January 2010: wow, has this one gotten even better. much more expresso-like on the nose and the flavor boasts new subtleties of toffee, cinnamon, graham cracker, and ash. the palate, which may have been a bit thin in the first batch, is much silkier and rich on the tongue. great work, geoff!"
"O: Pretty impressed with this one, I love the massive dose of coffee"
"O- nice enjoyable beer. Wishing the taste was a little more bold but tasty none the less"
"This brew pours out as a deep rich looking black color. There's a decent brown head that comes and goes within a few minutes. There is a light amount of lacing on the glass. The smell is mostly coffee, there isn't too much else happening on the nose here. The taste is semi sweet upfront but fades into a burnt toast bitterness with a lot of coffee throughout. The mouthfeel of this beer is medium bodied. Overall check it out, you may like it."
"D - A very drinkable brew, the first I've had from this brewery. Solid, and worth a try."
"I prefer both the Left Hand Milk Stout and the Lancaster Milk Stout to this offering"
"I have to say that I am a little disappointed in this beer. It's not bad, it's not cloying or overly sweet, it's just not what I expected given how it was labeled. If you're being introduced to coffee stouts for the first time or find them to be too bitter or over the top usually, this is probably right up your alley. However, if you're like me and want a coffee stout that's big, bold, and has a little bit of a kick to it, pass this one by."
"D - A good offering. Nice job."
"This is not really doing it for me. It's too sweet, especially at the finish. Kind of a one-dimensional beer... If I were in the mood for a sweet, slightly coffee flavored beer, this wouldn't be bad... but it is no where near an A for the style."
"Overall this is a great beer. Some richness problems."
"O - Very nice brew, does everthing as expected. Needs more robust flavor profile to be considered elite."
"Overall: A really awesome brew that exemplifies an underrated brewery. Will drink many times in the future and will definitely recommend to everyone."
"Drinks well. A smooth, easy to drink after dinner type beer."
"Notes: Nothing extraordinary but rather quaffable. The coffee itself without being extraordinary feels good and adequate and all in all it comes together nicely. Glad to have tried this one, in particular in light of some recent flops with coffee stouts."
"Poured nearly jet black except for a garnet tinge in the bottom of the glass,a one finger mocha colored head that was gone in a flash atop,a well formed head it just didnt stick around at all.Aromas of dark roast coffee,vanilla,and light bitter chocolate,not much earthiness wich I expected.If this wasnt a milk stout I would have given it a lower taste score because its quite sweet after awhile,starting out with roasted coffee flavors they are soon taken over by sugary sweet lactose notes in a long finish.To me it gets too sweet after mid glass but the flavors are pretty good."
"O-Yeah, we all like this one a lot. I would like a few."
"This beer pours a black color with not much of a head. The smell is weak, and has a subtle coffee smell. The taste isnt heavy, but is sweet at first then the coffee flavors finish. Could use some more carbonation, but its flavorfull. Overall is good stout, different and deffenlty worth a try."
"o: Very enjoyable. Quality craft beer and it is a local which makes it even better. Very nice sweet, coffee stout. Could easily enjoy a couple of these on a cool evening like tonight."
"Get it!"
"The flavor is not quite good as the nose, but is quite extravagant. The chocolate is layered and reminds me of virtually everything chocolate-related that I could possibly enjoy. Loads of chocolate cake and a good amount of coffee as well. Mouthfeel is quite thick and lovely with lowish levels of carbonation. Love, love, love the fact that this is only 5.4% ABV. Damn is this drinkable and overall, I can't get enough of this."
"O - drinkable but this bottle is not nearly as good as the draft I had a few weeks ago."
"The best part of the taste is the chocolate and malt which is quite plentiful. Downside is the coffee which can be overpowering and also the flat nature of the beer - it just misses on mouthfeel. Overall this one is fine, but not one I would go back to..."
"D- with such a tasty taste and sweet mouthfeel on top of a 6% brew this is a great session stout with lots of flavor"
"I'm digging this newer label, what with the faux wax seal and all. Fancy. The beer inside pours a deep, dark black-brown topped by a half-finger of ashy-ecru foam. The nose comprises a sweet coffee mixed with a velvety rich dark chocolate. Some roasted malts, a clear prerequisite as per usual, finish things up in the back. There may or may not be a small amount of maple syrup in there as well. Just sayin'. The taste leans a bit more toward the chocolate end, but the coffee remains, staunch as ever. It's a very simple combination, but it's done to near perfection here. Very tasty. The body is a sleek medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a decidedly smooth feel. Overall, a very nice coffee stout, straight up."
"The CPJ"
"SkÅL!"
"Pours black as night with a small, short-lived tan head. The nose offers a heavenly blend of coffee, dark chocolate, and toffee. The flavors are good and largely consistent with the nose and also feature roasty notes and perhaps more sweetness than the aromas suggested. Starts out with a lot of coffee and then finishes sweet and cocoa-like. Medium full body is appropriate. Overall, this is very enjoyable beer."
"D: This had a fantastic coffee scent and taste, but weak body. It was easy to drink, but it was ultimately only """really good""". (It would have been among the top of the style if it had fuller body.) Still definitely recommended."
"Overall, I enjoyed the flavor of the beer. It is a good beer for those who appreciate coffee, as the coffee flavor is very prevalent. However the mouthfeel is a bit of a turnoff."
"D: Some coffee-featuring stouts seem a little thin beneath the coffee character, but thankfully this has a nice chocolate and lightly fruity background presence. As a result, we get a balanced, appropriately sweet, approachable stout."
"I would definitely drink again if I were to visit Virgina."
"As a coffee drinker myself, I liked the way this tasted and would buy again."
"Drinkability: If you like coffee beer then you should enjoy this one quite well. It is an easy drinking, good coffee stout with a nice, low ABV."
"I will say upfront that this beer surprised me with being as good as it was. I looked at other reviews in advance along with my thoughts on AleWerks in the first place (decent, but nothing special. This beer poured a sexy looking black abyss into the glass, topped off by a wonderful brown foam that had decent head retention. The smell was of quality coffee, and you can tell from stout to stout which one was made with burnt leftover gas station coffee and who uses the premium stuff. This is premium stuff. Aside from the obvious coffee aroma there was a touch of vanilla and perhaps some nutmeg. The taste was quality like the aroma, but a tad on the sweet side. Much sweeter than I take my coffee, but I'm putting this beer on par with the CW Brewhouse Coffee stout. This thing is up in that pantheon for coffee stouts. The mouthfeel is pretty slick with the standard medium slightly chewy mouthfeel that most stouts should have. This is an easy beer to take down. I wish I had this around me at all times, but alas I have to hope for it in extras. If you see it, buy it, it's that good. And usually I'm pretty picky as to what stouts I find to be quality."
"D: Decent sweet coffee flavor but not much else to recommend it."
"Impression: I am sure to try and get this again. Buy this if you see it, quite tasty!!"
" Above average for sure. Glad i have another bottle."
"D - Great drinkability. There was an excellent balance of coffee and chocolate notes throughout. This is a great coffee beer and I'm glad it's local."
"Overall, this is a nicely balanced coffee stout, and is not too sweet, or dry. I'm almost curious if one were to let this go flat, then heat in a microwave, you could pass it to someone, and they would think it was just a fresh cup of good coffee."
"Overall, I'd buy a 6-pack of this to have a respectable coffee beer around. Good ones like this are hard to find."
"D - Solid coffee stout, although it's on the sweeter side of the spectrum. Still, there is enough of a coffee presence to please. Overall, this was a nice introduction to this brewery."
"D- its tasty but not great. The coke thing puts me off a bit but for a super drinkable coffee stout its pretty solid."
"D - I think I could have this one for breakfast...I enjoyed the coffee presence in the beer...they were strong and straight forward...the only reason I didn't score it higher was because of the slight lactic flavor I was picking up"
"Coffeehouse Stout has great coffee character but lacks the kind of feel that makes great stouts memorable."
"The mouthfeel is a bit above medium bodied but I wouldn't call it heavy. Carbonation is moderate, probably about the maximum I'd like it to be for the style. Drinkability is very good, I really enjoyed it and found it to be an excellent beer overall. The sweetness of the milk stout mixed with the bitterness of the coffee perfectly. I really enjoyed this one a lot more then I anticipated going in and really think it's one of the best coffee flavored beers I've had."
"d - one or two max, I found that this was very very filling."
"D - Loaded with flavor... A relatively low ABV... I could drink several of these in a sitting... I have yet to be let down by a Williamsburg Alewerks offering..."
"D- this is dangerously drinkable...well, not dangerously since the ABV is low, but you get the point. Really, really good."
"easily drinkable."
"D: One of the few beers that I've had from these guys, but this one sort of missed the mark. I wasn't a huge fan of this one, I must say."
"Poured a dark as night black with a thin brown head and left very little lacing sticking to the glass. The aroma definitely had some big coffee notes with burnt char, slight oatmeal grians, and faint chocolate notes. The taste has more chocolatey flavor mixing real good with the coffee notes alongside roasty burnt char and oatmeal grain accents. The brew was medium in body with a low amount of carbonation which had a sweet, roasty burnt char, slight astringent, and silky finish. The beer was more roasty and smokey than anticipated but still drank decent. I still think it would have had a better balance if it had more chocolate flavors."
"D: Wishing I had picked up more than one bottle right about now. A solid milk stout, one of the better ones that I've had on a long time."
"D: Definitely could have this breakfast no doubt. Great beer, but it's main down fall is that the flavor could have been richer. Love it. Could drink a 6 pack easily. If the flavor had been a bit more complex I would say it would have been up there with Surly Coffee Bender."
"Pours a light black into a pint glass with minimal head. The aroma is overwhelmingly coffee and sweetness. The taste is again mostly coffee. It's very sweet, but not very heavy. Certainly a tasty beer, and because of the light body, I could drink several at a time."
"This beer is extremely drinkable for a coffee stout. The bottle went down much too quickly. Great coffee aroma and flavor. Well balanced with a smooth body. Williamsburg has a winner on their hands with this brew. One of the best sessionable coffee stouts I've had."
"Bottle. Pours a very dark brown/black with minimal head. What head there is is a chocolate milk color that dissipates fairly quickly. The beer is brewed with roasted Guatemala Antigua coffee and the aromas of that are pretty evident in the nose. Other aromas include chocolate, vanilla, and leather. Strong coffee flavor to this one for sure! pretty much just like drinking an iced coffee. Bitterness throughout. Medium mouthfeel. Not the best coffee stout our there but definitely a solid performer."
"I think this is a great beer and I was very surprised at the flavor. I have heard horror stories about Williamsburg Ale Works beers, but every one I have tried so far has been fantastic. I am really falling in love with this small brewery. I think their current beers could easily take on the top breweries in the US."
"This is a wonderful coffee stout. Plenty of coffee without tasting like cold, carbonated coffee. Very enjoyable."
"D: Pretty darn good. I'd like more coffee roast in the flavor but it is still good and very drinkable."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and felt it was packed with great character while being easy to drink. I would certainly try this again."
"Overall, a very good stout if you're looking for a flavorsome, drinkable, and refreshing beer. I enjoyed this."
"D: I enjoy this beer. It's great for breakfast or after dinner."
"Drinkability: Straightforward coffee; I rather like that in this beer"
"D - I could easily settle in for a night and have a good number of these. The coffee is the highlight and definitely is what carries this beer...big surprise, given the name."
"D - went back at least 3 times to drink this beer, one of the better ones at the beer fest, coffee was never over powering, great balance, would love to see this barrel aged ala KBS"
"mouth and drink are both really good. I could drink a few. there is some bitter astringent in the finish, but not much."
"Poured a very nice deep brown with some nice head and a bit of lacing. Nice deep scent with roastd grains and a noticable coffee aroma. Good taste, a nice stout with roasted grain flavors; a bit too much coffee for me and it did have some astringency. Went down fine, if slightly dry."
"Tastes strikes a much different balance, however. Sweet, lactose maltiness screams milk stout and combines with the roasty coffee to provide a Frappaccino-esque tasting beverage. Very rich, very creamy and nearly decadent. Chocolate, both dark and milk are there aplenty. Packs a helluva lot of flavor for a 5.4%'er. Interesting and tasty beer, but probably could only tank one in any given sitting."
"D- Smells and tastes like an 8% imperial stout, but drinks like a common English Sweet Stout. This one is very, very quaffable... and deserves a place in the mainstream market."
"d - A pretty good stout. Had a nice sweet vanilla taste that mixed well with the coffee. Would try it again."
"Pours a deep brown with a slight tan head. The aroma rings like a bell - clear and crisp and coffee-like. It smells exactly like a well-roasted dark bean cracked with a hammer. The flavor is sweet and strongly, authentically coffeeish, with a creamy mouthfeel, like an extreme dark roasted cafe au lait. The alcohol and bitterness are in excellent balance, the coffee flavor perfectly counterpoised with the roasted malt. This is an excellent coffee-based beer."
"Great! Pick up a pint or 12."
"Wow!! I poured this black beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was opaque and poured a really dark head. The smell was like pecan pith. The beer tasted like COFFEE. It had great lacing but tasted like COFFEE. Very dry mouthfeel. If you like cold coffee you will like this. I did not."
"Overall, I think I'd enjoy one of these as a regular beer out at the pub with the lads, but more than that would be way too much - and I also think its complexity and nuances would be lost and wasted. This is a beer to sit with. A sipper. A nightcap. A dessert beer. It should be enjoyed slowly. Well worth trying!!!"
"Dark pour with minimal head. Smells strongly of dark roasted malts and a good amount of coffee aroma. Taste is good- very good. Smooth coffee flavor- just a bit of bitterness, but softer than most coffee beers. Not too much. Mouthfeel is medium-thick- a decent stout feel to it. Drinkability is high. Not an overwhelming coffee flavor- very smooth, not too strong of an ABV. A session-coffee-stout."
"Fairly thick, and yet simultaneously light bodied. Something like a soda that gone the teensiest bit flat - which sounds unpleasant but felt appropriate. Pretty easy drinking."
"M + D: I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. It's a tasty example of a coffee stout, and loaded with flavour. Yet it still manages to be a fairly light bodied, smooth and a little slick with a sparkling carbonation. Quite good... I just wish their seasonals were available in individual six-packs, as it's one I'd like to pick up alone from time to time!"
"drinkability: good"
"The rare coffee stout that doesn't ruin your tastesbuds so you can keep drinking it or have something else."
"single bottle from Grape & Gourmet, Virginia Beach, VA"
"Drinkability is extremely high. Such huge taste but pretty low abv. Highly recommended, especially for anyone who likes stouts brewed with coffee. The best thing from Williamsburg AleWerks that I've tasted. I wonder if it's because of the new head brewer."
"I highly recommend this one."
