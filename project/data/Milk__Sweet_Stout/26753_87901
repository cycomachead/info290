The adjunct character is interesting enough, but the base stout is rather weak and the barrel aging is pretty mundane. Still, these pairs are always fun to try and I’d say this one was slightly more interesting than the base beer, so that’s something at least. Cheers again for the brews SiddFinch!","Jeffo","Mar 14, 2015"

It's just slight on the back end. For most people drinking Bourbon BA stouts I could see this being underwhelming but as person that doesn't love bourbon, I thought this was great. The BA added a nice compliment and didn't go to far. Not a 100 but something I'd ISO in the wintertime","Lapalou","0"

The subtle complexity added by the barrels here makes this an improvement over the original, albeit a very slight one.  Bourbon GBS is a remarkable beer, derived from a similarly remarkable beer from a brewery that knows it has a golden goose on its hands and is squeezing every penny they can out of it.  And they should, as this is utterly unique and inspires years' worth of sentiment and fond feelings of Christmases past, present, and to come.","siege06nd","Dec 12, 2014"

Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, gingerbread, Christmas spice, bourbon, and wood aromas. Taste is much the same with dark gingerbread and spice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a great gingerbread and barrel aged presence that comes across much better in the smell to me.","UCLABrewN84","Jul 21, 2013"

Not a particularly robust aroma - hints of ginger cookie, bourbon, spice. The flavor profile opens up a bit with clear defined notes of ginger, molasses, chocolate, coconut, bourbon and the like. To me, the intended flavor profile works a lot better in this version. Not without its flaws though - a bit thin, and 12 weeks in a barrel seems a little rushed.","dirtylou","Beers"

Aromas are cocoa, toffee, gentle roast and toast. Mellow cinnamon, ginger, and spice. Touches of oak, vanilla, more gentle barrel experience, but it still covers up the spice a bit. Initial is sweeter, darker, cocoa and vanilla, gentle spirit. Ginger, cinnamon, some vanilla life. Middle is sweeter, cinnamon and ginger presence, some creamy vanilla and nice sweetness at times. Spirit, toast, toffee. A touch sweet. Cinnamon and spice assert into finish, nice flavors, gingerbread, some spirit, vanilla, gentle spiciness lingers with mellow heat, toffee, and creamy sweetness.

The bottle was open well before I got to it, and thus had a few moments to breathe. Sweet aroma, caramel, cinnamon, ginger, booze, more like flavored vodka than bourbon. As in the regular version, there was a definite cookie taste going on, like a Little Debbie Oatmeal Creme Pie, but it wasn't as pronounced as I would have hoped, and in this version it was also competing with the vanilla/bourbon/booze flavors. Regardless of that, I do think that this version tasted better, and the bourbon aging improved it, though there was still a bitter, woody unpleasant aspect to the beer. Again, like the original, my main beef with this beer was the body. It's quite thin for a stout, and leaning more towards an English stout or brown ale. It would be interesting to see if they tweak GBS and try to improve it in the future, but considering the hype over it, it's probably not going to change. I definitely wouldn't turn it down if someone offered it to me, but it's not worth standing in line for however many hours to get it.","Rifugium","Beers"

4.05,-7.3,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"The beer pours a dark brown with almost no head/lacing. The nose is a pungent nutmeg with none of the other spices or notes of bourbon that I'd expected. The taste brings a lot more ginger and spice forward, but the bourbon still doesn't make an appearance. As I'd expected from the beer's appearance, the mouthfeel is rather thin and mild-medium bodied, but does have a lot more spice, specifically ginger, that lingers in the aftertaste. This beer is quite tasty with great spice and the ginger I was hoping for, but the nose didn't pop with the Christmas season or bourbon as I'd hoped.","ThePorterSorter","Jan 06, 2013"

4.52,3.4,4,5,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Overall: Hardywood makes another crazy awesome beer. Honestly, I hope that GBS and BA GBS are going to be a Winter tradition for the brewers at Hardywood. GBS & BA GBS are the best christmas beers that I have ever had and no other beer even comes remotely close! The barrel really complements the beer; it still lets alot of the flavors of the base beer shine through and accent all of the regular GBS flavors!","4DAloveofSTOUT","Jan 02, 2013"

4.5,3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O - My anticipation was high for this beer as I was curious as to how the gingerbread flavor would react to the introduction of bourbon barrel character. I'm actually pretty floored in how well this turned out! Sure, the ginger flavor is no longer in the spotlight, but a good bit of complexity takes its place to take this beer to a completely new level. If sticking strickly to the holiday theme, the original GBS is probably the better choice. Overall though, I think the Bourbon GBS brings the best overall package/complexity, and is no doubt a fantastic bourbon barrel offering.","TechTriumph","Dec 27, 2012"

4.67,6.9,3.5,4,5,5,5,"O: Blown away by this beer. It is a lot better than GBS, in my opinion. While some of the spices have been lost to the barrel aging, the bourbon has added more than it has taken away. Enough of the base beer remains to be appreciated, which is a key for me with barrel aging. You've outdone yourselves Hardywood. 5","russwbeck","Dec 18, 2012"

The spices are a bit subdued after 12 weeks in a barrel. The mouthfeel, smell, and taste are all great from the bottle. I tried the draft at the release party and didn't like it as much as the bottle version.","mojiboo02","Dec 16, 2012"

The flavor is a step up from the aroma. Lots of holiday spices with only a touch of bourbon. Silky smooth on the palate. Beautifully balanced. Like eating a gingerbread cookie. Sweet but never cloying. A great beer for the holidays.","Huhzubendah","Dec 15, 2012"
