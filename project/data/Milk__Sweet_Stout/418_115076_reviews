"Poured hard out of a bottle, the beer is dark with a nice thick creamy looking head. Tastes very very smooth, very evenly balanced roasted flavors. Feels almost a little bit too thin."
""
"I really liked this one. Really nice milk stout and easily drinkable. Has reallly nice mouthfeel for a milk stout."
""

"Love the nitro affect after you pour upside down. This brew was like an imperial guiness draught imo. Didn't care too much for the guiness but left hand's was delicious. Very smooth and flavorful, bottle was 2.50, give it a shot . ."
"This beer is hands down my all time favorite, bottle or tap it's amazing. On all levels. Try this asap, really swish it around your mouth and enjoy every little nuance this creamy beer has to offer."
""
""
"This was an absolute fun and delicious beer.  You have to pour this beer aggressively to get the effect of the nitro pour.  It worked really well and looked like it was poured from a tap.  The """volcano""" effect settled into a sweet smelling odor of chocolate and roasted coffee.  The taste was as smooth as silk!  It tasted like a milkshake, at times it was hard to remember this was a beer.  The smooth silky flavors coat your mouth and leave a nice feeling and leaving you wanting more.  This is a very nice beer with a sweetness to it.  I suggest pairing this with a desert or after a meal as a desert.  It was really a quality beer."

"My beer/stout world changed forever when I drank my first Left Hand Milk Stout Nitro!  In my opinion, it is the greatest stout on the planet, simply amazing!  Left Hand doesn't distribute here in Sioux Falls yet, so I make state border runs, and stock up.  If you love beer, if you like stouts, THIS beer is AMAZING!  Go with the Nitro, soooooooo smooth!"

"Smooth chocolate notes not highly carbonated"
""

"Incredible. Was not expecting a stout this good. I am usually harsh on stouts because most have added carbonation and I personally feel that stouts are better on their natural, creamy froth like this one. A: black as coffee, and not to thick. Hardly a fingers worth of head that dissipates to a quarter finger that lasts throughout with minimal lacing. S: definitely milky, hints of mocha and chocolate, undertones of bread. and absolutely no hint of hops. T: milk and mocha are strong, chocolate and bread come later, slight dark fruit, hops are completely disguised. F: smooth, milky, and very little carbonation. Have to be careful because of how smooth it is, it goes down quick. O: superb stout. Definitely on my favorite list. It's actually refreshing."
"Pretty good stout, tried the wake up dead and had too much alcohols taste so tried this one the next night and can taste a sweet chocolate beer with a slight bitter after taste."

"FEEL: Smooth and full."
""
""
"Overall:  Easy to drink, but lacking in flavor.  I think this beer has its time and place, but I won't be going out of my way to have another any time soon."

"I rarely invert a bottle of beer, but that is what I was directed to do. Thankfully, all of the inverted Glugs as a part of The CANQuest (tm) left me well-versed in how to pull this off. First, the cascade as the N2 was driven off led to the creation of a finger of dense, deep-tan head with good retention. Color was Black/Opaque (SRM = 44) with cola highlights visible only at the edges. Nose was very chocolaty with a touch of underlying smoke. Mouthfeel was big, full and creamy. The taste was really chocolaty, extremely sweet, especially for this hophead and the combination put me in mind of chocolate pudding or chocolate mousse. Wow! Finish was likewise quite sweet and intensely chocolaty. I would definitely have this as a dessert beer, if I was ever asked about a dessert beer."

"Out of bottle but felt and tasted more like something silky from the tap."

"Poured violently into a tulip glass. Dark brown with tan foam and well sustained lacing. Smell very lightly of sweet malts,, chocolate, vanilla. Taste is sweet throughout, some roasted malts, hint of mocha, hint of cocoa; barest hint of hops to balance out the sweetness.  Mouthfeel pretty light with no signficant carbonation noted. Overall great representative of the milk stout genre - easy drinking, pleasant, not particularly complex but quite enjoyable."

"Smooth Drinking. Need.  One.  Now"
""
"This is an amazing stout and the standard for the style in my book. It's smooth and highly drinkable. One of the few beers I could see myself crushing a 6-pack of in one sitting. Like Guinness Draught in terms of drinkability, but a lot more flavor."
"I'm not a stout Veteran and haven't had too many but this was really good. Smells of chocolate. Real creamy mouthfeel, taste: chocolate, little coffee and bitter up front and and a little sweet twards the end. Excellent. I recommend you do the hard pour that they recommend you do. Stout or pint glass, crack the bottle, and turn it COMPLETELY upside down and let it pour violently into glass. Result was creamy milkshake head that lasted the whole time. Would recommend!"
"Had on tap. Done really well to style.  Really delicious beer. Would recommend if you ever see on draft."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I love stouts, but this one fell short. No head was present upon pouring. The taste was smooth, but unremarkable."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: beautiful looking beer with really nice aromas and flavors;"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I'm not impressed with this beer at all. It's really thin-bodied, unlike most souts. Thickness and heaping flavor are two of the main reasons I love stouts, and this beer had neither. What little taste was there was pretty good. It just left a lot to be desired."
"Very smooth and creamy mouthfil. Alcohol well hidden, would like more bite actually. Would like a little more on the nose and maybe some coffee. Other than that well done."
"Nothing special, regular cream stout, nothing bad to say about though"
"Good taste.  Bit of sweetness.  Expected more froth is all, otherwise pretty tasty."
""
"Like this one about the same as the normal milk stout, would drink again"
"Cool concept having Nitro filled bottles. The pour was beautiful with a thick frothy head that sticks around for the entire beer, typical for any beer on a nitro tap, however this came from a bottle and is really impressive. Like most nitro beers, the nose is non existent and all flavors are muted. Nice creamy mouthfeel. Overall not a bad beer, but I think nitro beers are sucked of all of their smell and taste and this one isn't much of an exception. I'll take the regular version any day."
""
""
"overall I enjoyed this beer but wasn't what I came to expect in a stout, more like milk...as in the name"
"-overall a very impressive milk stout great flavor great finish"
""
"Not sure why but I think I'm the only one who is really disappointed in this beer. The mouthfeel is just far too thin for me to get past. Tastes just fine with some good roasty chocolate notes but the mouthfeel here kind of ruins the beer for me. Sorry Left Hand :("
""
""
""
"Maybe to harsh. I'm just not a stout fan"
"Not bad. Tastes like a Guiness with flavor. Paid 11.49 for a 6 pack. Really not worth it at all. I'd much rather buy a riverhorse milk stout for that price."
"This was my least favorite milk stout I've ever had"
""
"A good beer spoilt IMHO by a thoroughly unnatural method that makes an amazing looking beer but a dodgy consistency & negative impact on flavours"
""
"One of my favorite stouts hands Down !"
"First time I've done 4's across the board but all are well deserved. Did """pour hard""" (the 2nd time) to get a slight light brown head and release the wonderful aromas held within.. A very mellow and flavorful taste throughout. Will come back to this one."
""
""
"I was really disappointed after reading all the enthusiastic reviews.  Maybe I just don't like this style.  The smell is not a good start for me, really does remind me of milk mixed with beer.  That sweet, milky lactose taste really jumps out at me--and not in a good way.  Feel is thin and almost flat.  A bit more carbonation might help balance the sweetness.  If you enjoy imperial stouts, you may not like this."
""
"Great beer.  Perfectly balanced with the taste of chocolate."
""
""
"Great look. Great flavors. Not too sweet. Cocoa and coffee bitterness comes through. Terrific mouthfeel. As close to nitro tap as one can get in a bottle. Great with desserts, seafoods, burgers, or on its own."
""
"very light stout aroma; coffee/dark choc./milk; still a large degree of sweetness; mouthfeel out of this world- very smooth but the light carbonation is playful and sits on the tongue. appearance is also a highlight w/ the nitrogen providing a tight, white head that stays throughout"
""
"Wow very easy to drink drinks like a chocolate milk but much thiner smells of cocoa so smooth this is a must if you enjoy syouts"
""
""
"O: Solid stout, very creamy and smooth. Not a lot of flavor, but very true to the style. This would make a fantastic stout float."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall: its good but i think the flavor sort of takes a hit as compared to the non nitro version of this"
""
""
""

"Dark, somewhat heavy but sweet. Not much carbonation so its somewhat flat but enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"Solid beer, taste is lacking though"
""
""
"Got lucky enough to live down the street that carries this AND sells 6 packs to go until 3am.....oh man what a treat, so delicious. Dark but not too heavy, with a dark chocolate coffee malt aftertaste. Coming in at a very drinkable 6%, I'll be buying more. So good, it never made it to a glass"
""
""
""
""
"12oz bottle. Pours a pitch black color with an inch of frothy tan head. Lots of lacing. The aroma is sweet milk chocolate, roasted malts, earth and charcoal. The taste is sweet milk chocolate, almost like a chocolate milk shake. Some roasted malts with a hint of smoke. Earthy notes. Finishes with mor of the roasted malts and milk chocolate. Velvety, slick mouthfeel from the nitro. Overall, very well done. I still prefer the draft but I will be buying more of this again. Glad it is now available in CT."

"Best beer ever made hands down"
""
""
"Sweet, very little carbonation. Nice feel, very smooth. Not as burnt as I would have expected based on the color. Good session stout. Nice finish with a little bitter aftertaste. Very pleasant to  drink on a chilly evening."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wonderfully smooth and a beautiful pour when poured hard the way the brewer recommends. Easily one of my all-time favorites."
"Smooth, yet complex, full bodied flavor. One of the best stouts on the market."
""
"The Nitro adds a nicer, creamier texture than the original/conventional Left Hand Milk Stout. However, it loses some of more pronounced bitter from the original. Sweet, well balanced in flavor and texture, a stout almost too easy to drink. I'm loving it."
"The pour was beautiful with a solid black body with a khaki head slowly rising from the brew was very inviting. The smell was a bit subtle but I did pick up on some chocolate notes and some roasted scents. The taste and feel were awesome with semi-sweet chocolate came through in a deliciously creamy stout. Thought it was awesome."
""
""
""
"Smooth and sweet.  I like this brew a lot."
""
""

"Smooth stout with great color but lacking somewhat in flavor and scent."

"Probably one of my favorites stouts I've had in a long time. I really enjoyed it on nitro. Super creamy, make for a great dessert beer."

"Pretty solid milk stout and the nitro makes it even better."
""

"Love this stout, it's delicious. It is my go to beer when I go to restaurants and buy it from the store."
"Fantastic beer. Smooth and creamy with a nice roast that isn't too bitter. Not too heavy, goes down easy. Could drink this all day."
"Heard it was real good but got to try it and was very disappointed"

"Best By 05/28/2015.  Vertical bottle pour into a stout glass as directed by Left Hand Brewery.  Pour reveals cascades of beautiful purging nitrogen from bottom to top.  Head eventually grows to two fingers - it is quite dense and creamy looking and light khaki in color.  Light on the nose: Roasted malts, coffee bean, then chocolate milk.  Mouth feel is sort of light as soon as it enters the mouth, but the agitation of the nitrogen creates the illusion of a full bodied and very creamy stout.  I Could session this all day long at 6% ABV.  Taste is like the smell but more pronounced - roasted malts, chocolate milk, then light coffee bean/slight hop bitterness lingers for a little while.  Overall I'm very impressed, and I like the Nitro Milk Stout better than Left Hand's regular Milk Stout because it's so pretty to look at and it tastes creamier yet less filling."
""
""
"Great drink ability. No bad after taste. Similar to Guinness but with more alcohol."
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  This is a damn good milk stout!  Great flavors of roasted malt and some subtle coffee, accented with some nice caramel, brown sugar and vanilla-like sweetness, all wrapped up in an extremely smooth quaff.  I’ll certainly be getting more of this!"

"Has a nice sweet taste. There is some hints of darkness. I gatherd some flavor butnothing stuck out or over powerd. Some light earthyness and very mild coffee. It's a well balanced beer far feel to taste ratio. Could easily drink this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Update: marking this one down a little - it doesn't live up to my memory and the sweetness stands out more than it used to. Also, while the nitro is very smooth it doesn't seem to provide adequate bubbles for the right mouthfeel - it just seems kind of flat. Still a very easy drinking and enjoyable stout though."

"had this from tap at Brown Iron Brewery and it was pretty good, liked the nitro version.  pretty sweet overall, not much else."

"V - A little pricy, locally 10 dollars a six pack, but worth trying, will be a repeat stout for me."
"o: one of the most milk-sweetness forward milk stouts i've had.  its nothing crazy, but is delicious and has a wonderful mouthfeel.  real nice balance of sweet and roasty bitterness in here.  definite recommend"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, any interesting first impression with milk stouts. I'd much rather have a FBS or other dark chocolate stouts, but this milk stout leans towards a session beer I could enjoy of a few of in one setting."
"One of my favorites. Chocolate is very subtle yet there. Great beer. A must taste."
""
""
"One of the smoothest stouts around.  Good aroma and coffee taste."
""
"Overall: It was a pleasant drink, nothing special but not one to count out. I'd definitely pick it up as a party beer for me."
""
"Draft.  Poured dark coffee black with 3 fingers of lingering head.  Significant lacing throughout the drink.  Aromas of dark roasted malts and coffee.  Little to no sugar smell.  Taste is like a more fill bodied Guinness.  Not sweet. Not boozy.  No overpowering coffee taste.  Too light in the mouth and taste for me.  Very light abv so you can drink a few.  Not a lot of taste actually.  I was disappointed but I prefer boozy bourbon barrel aged Russian Imperial Stout.  This is too light for me.  Might be your cup of tea though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I used a vigorous pour as the bottle instructed.  Strong coffee-like aroma and flavor.  Not as sweet as I was expecting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cracked open with a fizz but no real head, even poured it straight down the center of the glass.  Smell is chocolate and roasted malt.  The mouthfeel is where it goes a bit wrong for me.  I know it's only a 6% abv beer but I was expecting just a bit more because it's a milk/sweet stout.  Taste is pretty typical for a milk stout but nothing too special.  Much like the nose - chocolate and roasted malts  Overall it was a good beer and I'm glad I got to try it but I don't think I'll but it again."

"[Left] hands down, my favorite beer."

"Light sweetness for style."
"The taste just isn't there. Tastes watered down."

"Serving type: bottle"

"I don't like the new scoring system. I rate for my memory, not so much for others since I am such a rookie at this"

"This was very good indeed"

"Was not impressed at all."

""

"Nice and dark, almost black, with a slight brown around edge.  1 finger creamy tan head after a very vigorous pour into a pint stout glass.  Little to no lace.  Smells are good with chocolate and coffee and a little mocha.  But it falls short on flavor and mouth feel.  Flavors are good, but mild.  Too subtle to rate as an exceptional stout.  A little chocolate, very little coffee, no roast, no hops, little malt sweetness. The flavors that are there are good, but they are not assertive enough for my taste.  Mouth feel is watery for a milk stout.  Very thin, light to medium body.  Frothy foam is correct for milk, but this is more like skim milk than a chocolate milk shake.  So although I thought it was OK, it just wasn't anything special."
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: Nitro carbonation does wonders for mouthfeel. Incredibly smooth and silky. Fairly dry in the aftertaste."

"Pours black, low carbonation, virtually no head to speak of.  Bittersweet chocolate, coffee (typical stout flavors)  Full bodied creamy mouthfeel.  Low hop bitterness.  I really liked this beer.  In fact I like it quite a lot and I will probably buy this again.  Would have rated a 4.75 if it had a decent head."

"Overall: My go-to stout. I wish bars everywhere across America carried this stout as their nitro tap versus Guinness. A truly magnificent crafted stout. Thanks, Left Hand."

"O: very good for a milk stout, but not amazing. Think I prefer the CO2 version better. Still, the mouthfeel & cascade effect was pretty cool..."
""
""
""
""
"Beautiful cascade. Smells and taste good, coffee, malty sweetness. Mouth feel is very good. This has the nitro feel with a heavy oatmeal stout-like creamy body and it is unique and pleasant. Very good stuff."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A pretty awesome beer, but it's dangerous at even a low 6% ABV because it is so easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm not as big a fan of this. It seems a little to chalky to me."
""
""
""
""
"Great looking beer with decent aroma, but as I drank it I really didn't follow what other reviews have been saying.  The flavors seem muted and left an unappetizing aftertaste that I just didn't like.  The body was too smoothed out.  I like a soft, smooth, mouth feel, but this just didn't seem right to me.  Just not for me I guess."
""
"Overall, a fantastic milk stout and worth getting."
""
"I recently reviewed a Gose the other day. It was my first time trying that style and I was simply turned off by the salty and sour taste. Even if I'm not crazy about a beer, I will almost always finish it. In this rare case, I had to dump it. I thought that perhaps this was the first time I had ever dumped a beer. Then, I recalled that I had once ordered this milk sout, months ago, at a beer. I am belatedly reviewing this beer as I recall the only other time I was unable to finish one. The milky taste and low carbonation was too much of a turn off. Not for me."
""
""
""
""
"Overall.  A fun beer, and even one of the better regular milk stouts that I've had for a style I don't really care for too often."
""
""
"Make sure you pour this aggressively.  Nice black color and retains a very nice creamy off white head.  Laces all the way down to the last drop with bit of creamy head still left at the bottom.  Smooth and creamy taste with hints of mocha, coffee, and a hint of toasted nuttiness.  One of my favorites from Left Hand and the nitro makes the carbonation in the beer look almost like glitter when the glass is tilted."

"you know, maybe i am the only one who thinks this, but i am a sucker for the original, and dont think the nitro format, even on tap, adds anything in this particular instance. its great beer of course, the original is one of the beers that got me into craft, or at least into dark beers, and i will always have a special place in my heart for it. the nitro seems to detract from rather than add to the richness, it sounds weird, but the viscosity and low carbonation of the original is more appealing to me than the thinner but more alive nitro version. the flavors are great, but the sweetness which i love about it is balanced out a little more here, which ordinarily i would love but here less so. the nitro version has some advantages though, i think it makes a better morning drink, in fact, one of the best. the roasty notes come out more in the absence of sweetness, a great coffee substitute. one of the only beers this is true for, but i like the original better than the nitro, although the nitro bottling technology is cool."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Really fitting of the label 'dessert beer'. If it had a tad less sweetness, I'd be more compelled to keep it in stock. However, as it is, it's pretty top notch."

"I just love everything about this beer... the pour, the rich flavor, the smooth feel, the nitro cascade, everythign.. and its 6.0% which is fabulous ... i don't really WANT my favorite to be a 9.8 or a 10.. its just too much sometimes.. this is all around delish!"
"SO smooth and flavorful its unreal. Currently the best beer I have ever tasted the only reason I didn't rate it a 5 is I am assuming someday I will find a beer I like more."

"standard stout in a lot of ways. this is a rich, creamy, milky beer that is a little unusual upon first taste. smells, like a stout, tastes like a stout, mouthfeel is where it gets weird, but good weird. this is not in any way a complex beer, but I honestly feel like it doesn't need to be, it is simple yet highly enjoyable, and I would drink it again."

"So is this a nitrogenated beer simply bottled? It seems to be, and it really brings out the character of the beer. I've had the Left Hand milk stout in the regular version before, but this really blows me away. It made me think of Mackeson's XXX, which for me was the original, as well as the be all and end all of milk stouts, and then it lived up to that, and perhaps even surpassed it in a way as it's so clean and focused. Is there a little more character to the Mackeson's? Or is it just the nitro that's making me think the Left Hand is more homogenized? Regardless, I am crazy in love with this beer. Even for people who """don't really like dark beer", this is an absolute must-try!!!"

"Overall impressions: I love this beer, and I can’t think of a better sweet stout to cater to my hormonal wonkiness once a month, than this chocolate beauty. She’s a Perfect Ten in my book. Or at least, a perfect eight-point-five."
""
""
"Velvety rich taste smooth coffee and chocolate notes"
""
"Overall (4.7): The hype is justified with this beer as it's one of the best milk stouts I've had. The flavors are light yet balanced with roasted malts, chocolate, lactose, and oats. This is like an edmund fitzgerald with lactose thrown in. Its so damn creamy i dont even feel it going down. This is what i wished Guinness could be. A perfect go to or for someone new to stouts. I regularly indulge in RISs and still find this great. A world class beer without a doubt, and recommend this highly"

"Smooth black milky goodness. Notes of chocolate and mocha. Pour it hard and watch the show."
"O:  An outstanding milk stout.  Now I see what it's so highly touted.  Wish I had bought more.  I'll seek this one again, for sure."
"Pours nearly pitch black with a thin tan head that leaves a little lacing. Smells of roasted malts, chocolate, hint of coffee. It tastes like rich, creamy chocolate with some coffee and roasted notes. Delicious beer. The mouthfeel is velvety smooth and thick. One of the creamiest mouthfeels I've ever experienced. I only purchased a single and hope to drink more in the future. This is truly a great beer."

"Overall: Think of this as an intense Guinness can pour, it takes that style of beer to another level and the fact this is a sweet stout makes it all that more interesting to me. I think this is the style I have really been looking for. Its not too brutal like an Imperial stout, but its not to thin like a Guinness or a porter can be. I am a fan of this style. It will be a winter staple."

"Love This One!!"

"A tasty milk stout, the nitro treatment giving it ever more dessert-quality silkiness.  No hint of the elevated ABV, and a pleasure to put back, as it seems like winter is approaching the Mile High City sooner than expected - hide your pumpkins!"

"Overall / Drinkability:  I've always been concerned that a nitro-bottle can't quite pull off a nitro tap or a nitro-can type of mouthfeel, but this one comes quite close.  Great looking beer and one that definitely promotes the """chocolate milk""" type of effect in a beer, but still having the bitter finish of a stout and you know its a beer.  Went very well with dark chocolate chip wheat muffins, and I think it would go well with other desserts.  I'll have to revisit this beer again someday."

"For everyone that complains about no head, you have to pour this beer straight upside down into your glass.  Check their website, it shows how to pour a Nitro beer."
""
"Overall: Delicious, unique rendition of a stout that feels less like steak and potatoes and more like chocolate mousse in your stomach."

"Medium bodied, with moderate carbonation. Smooth and ctreamy. Very easy to drink. I recommend trying this if you get the chance."

"As I took my first sip, the head felt like little pillows cushioning my lips as I drank the nectar of the gods. This is truly an outstanding beer! If you poor it correctly as described on bottle, the beer creates three layers. The colors and layers remind me of a latte. The taste also similar to coffee, strong mocha hints with maybe some sweet chocolate. I could drink these all night long or drink just one for dessert, to quench any sweet tooth cravings."
"Winner.  Left Hand figured out how to bottle this without messing up the nitro, and this is an outstanding beer.  It tastes completely different than the regular Milk Stout, and I like this one even better.  This is a huge achievement for nitro beers.  For all those who are skeptical of nitro beers in the bottle, this is your proof that it can be done, and it can be done to near perfection."

"Thick, smooth, tasty. Nitro is a nice beer for a  Wednesday night, something you can drink with ease and confidence. I'm sure you can get a hold of something better for Friday though..."

"Overall- A solid stout but slightly underwhelming. A very drinkable beer that can be enjoyed one after another."

"A better cascade pour than Guinness. Take the extra second to pour it right and get rewarded. Inky shiny black with an erupting mocha tan creamy head. Just mouth wateringly good looks. Smell isn't particularly strong, but lots of dark roast coffee with lots of cream and sugar. Sweet and roasty. Taste and feel are equally highly ranked; smooth, sweeter and roasty with almost zero detectable hops. So velvety smooth and with enough body. Really really good beer, this is probably a new standard for the style. A perfect example of how American beers are the best in the world."

"O- As far as chocolate/coffee type beers go, it just doesn't get all that much better than this.  I'm sure that there is better out there, but virtually all of it is going to set you back quite a bit further financially compared to Left Hand Brewing's offering.  At roughly ten bucks a 6-pack, do yourself a favor and give this one a try. (4.34)"

"Deep black pour with a tan one-finger head. Nice roasted malt and espresso aroma with a hint of chocolate. Strong and creamy roasted malt flavor upfront that hides a touch of bitterness. Also has flavors of coffee, caramel, dark chocolate, vanilla and light alcohol. Medium bodied and lightly carbonated. Finishes slightly sweet with a touch of chocolate."

"Remember coming home after a day of school and pouring a big glass of chocolate milk - refreshing right?  This beer is like that.  A black/deep brown pour with a beautiful creamy head. I remember just how taken I was with the lacing the first time.  Each sip is measured for posterity along the glass down to the last gulp. Chocolate and something like a warm pumpernickel rye greet the nose.  The even smoothness of the creamy stout gives way to an initial subtle sweet latte flavor settling into a dark chocolate finish. I cannot remember which of my many preferred stouts was my favorite prior to my first LH-MS-N.  My next favorite will need to be pretty immaculate to force me away from this 'dairy queen.' I think you could drink this with a peanut butter and jelly, but on it's own this is a great after school/work snack!"
"It's no Dragon's Milk, but it's a fine beer. You get a mocha taste at first, but finishes with an oak taste."

"12 ounce bottle, best before 12/21/14.  Served in a mug, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head that stuck around for a very long time.  There's a decent amount of lacing.  The brew smells like roasted malt, milk and bittersweet chocolate, and some coffee.  I think the taste is the same as the aroma, it's all roasted malt, milk/bittersweet chocolate and coffee.  The mouthfeel is medium, it's really creamy and smooth.  Very easy to drink with moderate carbonation.  I think it's a little bit better than their original Milk Stout because of the improved mouthfeel on this.  It's a good brew, I wouldn't turn down one!  $2.19 for a single bottle."
"As black as midnight with a long lasting tan head. Chocolate and roasted malts in the aroma and flavor. The addition of lactose combined with the nitro gas gives it a smooth finish. If you know anybody that loves Guinness but is not into craft beer, give them one of these and see if they enjoy it."

"Without taking a stance on whether the beer is best with standard carbonation or this new nitro-infused version; the nitrogen gives the beer a tighter weave making the beer look and feel more dense. But the beer is also slightly less aromatic and thinner if not drank quickly. I honestly enjoyed this version very well!"

"Chocolatey delicious with a balanced amount of hops."
"O: 6%, which is, interestingly, slightly above the ABV of the original LH Milk Stout when I reviewed it (back then it clocked in at 5.2%), but the alcohol remains firmly in check, making this a pleasant experience.  My knock against the original LH Milk Stout was that I felt it was lacking in creaminess and body compared to other milk stouts, but the Nitro offering resolves those gripes quite favorably.  Nicely done."

"Appearance: I love the dark black color of this beer. One of the darkest colors I have seen, even for a stout. Probably just me not pouring it hard enough into the glass, but there was little to no head, which I found disappointing. Smell: Wonderful. Notes of milk and mocha/espresso. Taste/mouthfeel: Exceptional. I personally love milk stouts, and this reminded me of my all-time favorite beer, Odell Lugene. Very smooth taste with strong coffee notes. In general, the taste is lacking a bit for me, I found myself wanting more flavor than I got. The aftertaste is quite pleasant; I could easily drink this beer all night long with no problem. Occasionally, I taste a sharp alcohol note (usually upon the initial sip), but it disappears quickly. Overall, a wonderful milk stout that I will purchase again."

"Final Grade: 4.07, a solid A-. Left Hand has produced an exceptionally high-quality milk stout here. It's a little too saccharine to be something I'd consume on a regular basis, but to be fair this is not one of my preferred styles to begin with. It's still a tasty little beer that is well worth a try if you're curious, although I doubt it's very popular amongst the diabetic demographic."

"Poured 12 oz bottle into standard pint glass after a two course campground meal. This is a nearly black stout with almost zero head and minimal lace. There's lots of coffee and chocolate in the nose. Taste is nice - sweet smooth malt with tons of coffee flavor and some chocolate, just a hint of roast, but nothing brisk or sharp at all. Mouthfeel is smooth with low carbonation and a chocolate milk-like texture. This is overall a good after dinner dessert beer that would also stand up fairly well on it's own."

"Pours a pitch black coffee with almost no carbonation. Best date was July 2014. Tastes like a typical milk stout but the lack of carbonation really threw me off to the point that I did not enjoy this beer because I love milk stouts. Compared to Lugene's the taste is similiar but Lugene's has more body and flavor.Maybe I got a bad bottle."

"As a fan of porter and stout beer, I stumbled across this a few months ago and I'm glad I did.  Has a very smooth mouth feel and is very easy to drink. If you enjoy Guinness, this will blow your mind.  The """Nitro""" truly does improve overall texture and mouthfeel.  Left Hand does make  carbonated milk stout  which is good but doesn't compare to their Nitro version.  Highly recommend."

"Pours a jet black looking black color into a 16-oz Guinness glass. Cascading tan head that forms. Great lacing on the glass sides. Smells a tad roasts with mocha highlights. Some vanilla & chocolate. Tastes sweet from the lactose with chocolate & vanilla undertones. Decent bitterness evens things out. Hops seem earthy & woodsy although mostly nonexistent. Feels silky smooth from nitro. Like a milkshake. Great feel - medium full to full. Overall, a very well crafted beer. Nitro makes it extra so special."

"Overall - I never thought a bottled beer could ever replicate the experience of nitro beer on tap this well. It's not every day I'm jonesing for a nitro stout, but it's heartening to know I don't even need to hit up the pub anymore if the craving hits me. Highly recommended, even if for the novelty alone."

"Overall: This is a perfect substitute for Guinness Draught. You know, for when you desire something better. This is pretty damn good overall, even if the taste is definitely on the light side."

"Poured a gorgeous deep black with a two finger tan head that stuck around and left abundant lacing. Nice nitro cascade and bubbles throughout. Very good looking stout. Scents of milk chocolate, roast malt, cocoa and slight black coffee. A very nice aroma, quite chocolate-forward and sweet, but with the darker stout aromas present as well. Very nice. Flavor begins with sweet milk chocolate, mingled with roast malt and bitter-sweet cocoa flavors, moving into a more pronounced hit of roast malt, with some cream and black coffee. Finish is dry, with flavors of bitter-sweet cocoa, roast malt and cream. Aftertaste is bitter roast malt and cocoa powder. A very nice flavor, rich and creamy with big hits of chocolate, yet balanced by roasted and bitter flavors nicely. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth and creamy with a modest prickly carbonation. Very smooth and easy to drink, quite nice. Overall this is a great milk stout. It's not too sweet, not too bitter, finding a nice balance in-between. It has a rich aroma and great mouthfeel that aid its very good flavor profile. Very well done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A welcome option I am likely to pick up again in the future. Like some of the better porters, this offers a good combination of drinkability with smooth roasted goodness. As a stout, I'd like a bit more lusciousness, but this beer is a nice counterbalance to the cellar of 12% ABV Imperials that I like to keep."

"This beer is one of my favorite stouts. It is incredibly smooth with a high quality head. What I think sets this beer apart from other Milk stouts is it's mouthfeel and taste. I'm also a fan of the rich smell giving you the perfect introduction to the wonderful taste of the beer."

"The overall taste is very sweet and tastes of strong cream, coffee, chocolate, oats and barely. I do not taste any hops in this stout. It's not a particularly thick stout, but it is sweet and the taste is very good. It goes down very smoothly, and would compliment desert very nicely. I get the impression that cherries or anything with cherries (cherry pie, cheesecake or cordials) would compliment this stout very nicely."
