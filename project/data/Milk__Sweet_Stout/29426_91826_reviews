"Pours a beautiful black with a thin caramel head.  Mouthfeel is nice and full and more- than-medium thickness"

"O -   Nice punch of alcohol and chocolaty sweetness in this. You will definitely taste the ABV and it lingers once done but the sweetness really balances it. Nice job. Tasty brew."

"Pours a black color. 1/2 inch head of a tan color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells of sweet malt, roasted malt, oatmeal, chocolate, alcohol, hops, and slight yeast. Fits the style of a Milk / Sweet Stout. Mouth feel is sharp and clean, with an average carbonation level. There is also a noticeable bitterness from the roasted malts. Tastes of roasted malt, sweet malt, hops, hint of yeast, chocolate, hint of oatmeal, and a hint of alcohol. Overall, a complex beer, a little too much hops for my taste, but good chocolate flavors though."

"O: Milk stouts have never been my favorite due to the souring lactose. This one is quite sweet, but it's not too bad. One of the better milk stouts I've tried. Check it out."
""
""
"Overall: Pretty decent milk stout but not something to drink in quantity as it becomes a chocolate overdose after a while"
"O - Brash's Smoglifer drew me in with it's incredible label that features a crypic-yet-cartoonish comic book-style illustration that suits the beer quite well. Pouring inky black and foreboding, this chocolate-rich aromatic beer is enticing but it's robust bitter malt flavor leans a little too bitter and harsh-finishing for my taste. I enjoy the complexities of Smoglifter's combination of styles, if you will, but in the end, there's a fine line I teeter on and the lack of sweetness throws me off from really getting into this beer."

"Served in a glass, poured from the bottle."
"Pitch black body with a cream tan head, 10% heavy hitting imperial chocolate milk stout. Off the bat the head doesn't stick around very long speckled lacing follows suit. Aromatics, deep dark chocolate, notes of soy sauce, creamy lactose notes, and again big dark chocolate additions the gangs all here folks. As it warms up I'm getting dark fruit notes within the chocolate/milk chocolate notes. Flavor coats the palate with dark chocolate syrup, cream textures of lactic yogurt notes, earthy nutty notes from the cocoa additions...a really great beer as a whole. It gets a bit cloying sweet be sure to share with fellow beergeeks four to eight ounces is enough for me, 22 ounces is unbearable. Mouthfeel mellows out a bit just a touch of booze notes going on, with full bodied malts. Even flowing carbonation going on down through each sip. Overall, it's a nice beer big chocolate malts enough sweetness to induce diabetes disperse this amongst friends."

"Super strong stout with some amazing flavors. Looked great with a black as ink pour with a nice brown head. The smell was amazing with hints of heavy cream, dark chocolate, and espresso. The taste was full of malt with the chocolate and milk flavors coming near the end for a semi sweet finish. The beer was noticeably strong (drank at room temp) and very thick. Love this kind of super dark beer."

"O: Definitely lifts the smog with a coffee alertness that kept me awake during the really bad Travolta scenes in Battlefield Earth. At least the beer was good."

"Well, well, I have to admit I didn't expect to like this beer as much as I am. There's a lot of depth and flavor profiles that I really enjoy in stouts. I'm a milk stout guy but often they become too sweet, not here. The roast rules the roost. I'll be buying more of this."
"O - Disappointing for the price. A study in viscosity, and not much else. I will not purchase this again."
"I got a single pour, not an entire bomber... so, I'm happy with my portion."

"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 7/30/2013. Pours dense pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense dark brown head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big cream, milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toffee, fudge, vanilla, light coffee, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with nice complexity of sweet chocolate/roasted malt notes; with great strength and no booziness. Taste of cream, milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toffee, vanilla, toast, light char, and roasted earthiness. Light roasted coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of cream, milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, vanilla, light char, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and cocoa flavors; with big robustness and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and slightly chalky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent imperial milk stout. All around great balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, cream, and cocoa flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"Overall I thought this was a pretty good beer and I thought it was a very good example of an Imperial Milk Stout which is what Brash claims it is on the label, it's very similar to a well done Milk Stout, but all the expects are bigger then they would normally be and I think they did a good job of showing what an Imperial Milk Stout is all about. This beer had nice drinkability it was fairly smooth, creamy, a little rich, a little filling and the taste did a good job at holding my attention, a full bomber might be a little too much for me, so I think half the bottle is the perfect amount and it made for a good beer to enjoy on a cold winter night. What I liked the most about this beer was how all the aspects of this beer were kicked up to make it pretty fitting as an Imperial Milk Stout. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there wasn't anything that I disliked or would change, it's good just the way it is. I would buy this beer again when looking for an Imperial Milk Stout, my buddy said it was a little pricey, so I don't think I would get it often. I would recommend this to anyone who likes Milk Stouts or big stouts in general, it seems to fit pretty well in those categories and I think the alcohol is hidden well. All in all I was a little impressed with this beer and it made for a pretty good first impression for Brash Brewing Company, it was just what I wanted and would expect out of a good Imperial Milk Stout and I thought it delivered in all aspects with no weak points. This may be the best Imperial Milk Stout I have had. Great job guys, you can be sure that I will keep an eye out for more of your beers."

"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and slight coffee aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa and coffee flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that has a nice balance between sweet and roasty characteristics."

"Overall: A good not great sweet stout with just enough char to offset the sweetness. The alcohol sneaks up on you. I would get this again, but I would not rush out for it."

"Sure, there's some evident sweetness to this brute, but the overall flavor character brings way more to the table. Bold and delightful..."

"overall: very nice take on an imp stout. According to Brash drinkin this is like ""making love to your mouth like a horny sorority girl."" Thankfully that ain't true but it's a damn good beer."
"Ohhh, taste is nice. Not overly sweet or rich but has a nice roasty presence most milk stouts lack. Hides the ABV very well and the mouthfeel is silky. I like this quite a bit, well done."
""
"The booze kills this beer for me. Doesn't hide the alcohol well AT ALL."

"O- A very straightforward but enjoyable milk stout from a brewery that I'm starting to warm up on. Makes me want to buy Hot Fuzz next,"
""
""
""
"Not as much lactose character that I'd expect from an ""Imperial Chocolate Milk Stout."" Tastes rather average for what it is. Save yourself some money and buy some Old Rasputin."
""
""
"Medium heavy body, nicely carbonated. Creamy, holds together well. I'm really enjoying this one. A nice presentation of bitterness/sweetness/chocolate/coffee/tart. The bitterness lingers and the finish is clean enough to keep on sipping."
""
"The label is interesting. Are we to take this beer with us into the breach, the zone, the quarantined radioactive no-man's-land so that it will give us life and the power to believe?"

"This beer had all the makings for a great beer, but it was far too heavy and by after a fourth of the beer, I was over it. If it wasn't too thick, this beer would of been amazing. Frankly, I was very disappointed by it. I still have faith in Brash, though."

"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a dark, almost black coloring with chestnut highlights around the edges and a frothy, dense, half inch chocolate tan head that quickly settles into a filmy coating. Tasty looking brew that pours rich and smooth. Aromas of coffee and bittersweet baker's chocolate, with some hints of booze and earthy highlights. Flavors are rich, roasted, and super smooth. Wow. Bittersweet chocolate, with a creamy backbone, balancing both rich sweetness and bitter notes. Very tasty and very drinkable, doing a good job to blend robust flavors with a kick of booze. The beer is smooth, creamy, and rich in mouth, with a hint of bitterness at the end of the palate, drying slightly. The finish is rich, sweet, and roasty, but avoids cloying with the subtle bitter dryness. Very tasty, very quaffable brew."

"A rich stout. Very boozy, but enjoyable. I didn't think the alcohol was too intrusive, it seemed to enhance the taste."
""
"I continue to enjoy the various offerings from this relatively new contract brewer. They have nice takes on classic styles in bold, flavorful brews. This is a great imperial milk stout with pleasent notes of cocoa. Well worth a shot for fans of the style."
"This is really a tremendous big stout, and nice to see a different angle on the usual RIS and strong stouts. The alcohol seems perfectly integrated. One of the best stouts ever, on my list. From the 750 ml Belgian-style bottle purchased at Bottleworks in San Diego."
""
""
"O: Excellent, a very solid brew. This is my first sweet stout and I am impressed. The only quandary is that smell that reminds me of roast chicken."
""
"Big, boozy, smooth, milky. First thoughts immediately. 22oz bomber poured into enlarged tulip. deep black color with coffee colored head. Smell is sweet and strong at the same time. Mouthfeel is clean and smooth, the lactose comes thru in a welcome, inviting way, makes me want to drink more. Taste is on point, you know you're drinking a big bad high alcohol beer, but semi sweet chocolate, sugar and roasted malts still come through and they smooth out the initial harshness. Overall very well done and something i would pick up again"
"O - Usually I avoid milk stouts, but an IMPERIAL milk stout like this delivers."

"Pours a dark as night black hue with a khaki two finger head that stays and slowly recedes to look like a cake gone wrong with dimples everywhere and lacing everywhere the head has been,the smell is Booze,dark chocolate,a touch of vanilla and tobacco,the mouthfeel is full bodied with minimal carbonation and the taste is definitely dominated by the dark chocolate it really is big but i still get some vanilla,hazelnut and oak and as it warms some booze and dark fruits aswell and overall it's definitely a choc sweet stout but I'd like to see this with less chocolate as it dominates abit too much for me cheers."

"Poured into a glass mug. The beer pours black with a thin, brown head with some visible carbonation from the side of the glass. The aroma is of milk chocolate and malt with some sweetness in the aroma. The breadiness and roastiness of the malt is more forward in the flavor than it is in the aroma. It blends well with the milk chocolate in the flavor. There's some nice sweetness and some alcohol comes through in the flavor, but it's not overwhelmingly boozy. The body is full with moderate carbonation. The finish leaves a nice roasty aftertaste in the mouth that doesn't linger too long, but it aids the drinkability of this big beer. This is an excellent beer."

"Needs a creamier mouthfeel."
""

"O: Nothing overly sweet about this one. Just enough sweetness to satisfy a sweet tooth, but never gets cloying. Packs quite the punch at 10% too. A little pricey at $8.99 a bomber, but if you like milk stouts with a good bit of cocoa without the cloying sweetness, this is the perfect beer for you"

"Delivers successfully on its premise. An Imperial Chocolate Milk Stout and it is all there. Recommended. And I will seek more from this brewer."
""

"T: Thick, chewy and loaded with dark flavor. Lots of roasted malt upfront laced with bitter chocolate flavor. There's a hint of sweetness here and there, but it seems to be held back by a lot of roasted bitterness. Some anise and charred wood before a finish of cinnamon and more roasted malt. Mouthfeel is thick and slightly creamy, but I would definitely like a bit more creaminess from a chocolate milk stout. Still, this is good stuff."
"At TJ's Everyday today decided to try something new, going with the Brash Smoglifter. It had everything going for it - looks, nose, taste. This was easily one of the best Milk stouts I ever had. TJ's listed it as an Imperial Milk Chocolate stout. I tend to let this style warm up, but even cold out of the tap, this demonstrated a fine palate pleasing profile."
"Poured a blackish body with decent head that died quick with no lace. Again, a decent but not spectacular aspect of the beer is the aroma, as I pick up hints of roasted malts but not much else in the malts or anything really in the hops department. Beer is smooth, slightly creamy, but unfortunately offbalance for a sweet stout (or any stout, really) in my opinion. I don't know whether it is the alcohol or the strong presence of roasted, even possibly some toasted or coffee malt, maybe toffee, but the bitter chocolate and caramel sugary sweetness is overpowered by a dry, harsh malt tasting sensation and there really isn't much hoppiness to balance or give off that rare fruit flavor. The beer is balanced enough to avoid being sticky, cloying or in this brew's case just too dry and a taste bud killer so I can't say it's that bad and I did enjoy it as a sipper. Just wish they could mellow out the beer a little to let the sweetness come through and then it would be a great beer."
"This poured poured a rich syrupy black color with a thin brown head on top. The retention fades quickly and there is no lacing. The smell of the beer had deep roasted aroma with a good amount of molasses on the nose. The taste is chocolatey, it's rich with dark malts and cocoa. The mouthfeel is thick with a light carbonation. It's creamy and oily. Overall this beer is pretty good, it's not the prettiest looking beer but all and all it's a tasty brew."
"O: Well, the label describes this as an imperial chocolate milk stout. That's exactly what it is. Pretty one-note, lots of chocolate flavors from start to finish. That doesn't make it bad, in fact it's quite enjoyable. It reminds me a lot of Southern Tier Choklat. Pure chocolate with lots of sweetness. This isn't QUITE so sweet, it actually has a little bitter cocoa aspect but it's close. At the same time, it just doesn't hold up quite the same. Maybe not quite as rich? Mouthfeel seems a little thin compared too. I didn't mean for this to be a comparison element, but if you've ever had Choklat you will understand what I mean."
