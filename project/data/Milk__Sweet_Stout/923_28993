The aroma is of dark roasted malts with a sweetness for the most part. More going on with the taste as there is some chocolate with some very light spice. Goes down very smooth and not harsh or bitter aftertaste at all but finished slightly dry. Medium-bodied with almost no carbonation which is actually typical for most milk Stouts. Overall, a tasty brew.","BeerWithMike","Mar 02, 2015"

3.52,-5.9,3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Sweeter and deeper in its chocolate tones than most milk stouts, the Ska Brewing Steel Toe Milk Stout is almost a dessert substitute. The coal black black body hints at the deep, enveloping chocolate flavors insude. In the nose I find scents of freshly unwrapped premium chocolate (the kind you cringe when buying, even if it’s for a special occasion) with chocolate malt and a nice, rich dairy freshness in the nose. The flavor is oozing with even more chocolate, more sweet than bitter, and recalls slices of decadent chocolate cake had at fancy dinners in the past. The boisterous carbonation washes away the flavors in the aftertaste, leaving behind a short but very intense burst of chocolate astringency. Milk stouts are engineered with lactose sugar in mind, but the Steel Toe is a special example of just how sweet a deep, dark beer can get with a heady dose of lactose. I never find it cloying, but I also know that a drink that sweet doesn’t seem like a beer sometimes. All the same, darn good drinking, and practically begging to be paired with a nice vanilla ice cream.","GarrettB","Aug 02, 2011"

3.92,4.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a black color. 1/4 inch head of a pale tan color. Decent retention and poor lacing. Smells of sweet malt, slight oatmeal, hops, hint of alcohol, and slight roasted malt. Fits the style of a Milk / Sweet Stout. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. There is also a slight dryness noticeable. Tastes of sweet malt, hops, roasted malt, hint of coffee, and a hint of dark citrus. Overall, the sweetness is present in aroma and the initial taste. That quickly abates, and what is left is reminiscent of a Baltic Porter.","Tone","Aug 30, 2010"

3.6,-3.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"This is a medium bodied brew with moderate carbonation. Quite drinkable, there is no problem finishing the glass.

Decent body could be richer and heavier. Moderate carbonation could be smoother too.","thekevlarkid","May 04, 2008"

Flavors are big on the chocolate and light roast coffee except there comes a fantastic drying in the finish. Mouthfeel is thin to moderate in weight and slightly slick. Carbonation is mellow. This is a solid beer, but I grew tired of it by the end. I really don't think I would like this fresh, as I assume the dryness comes from the age put on this bottle. I'd imagine a fresh example would be your typical cloyingly sweet stout.","goochpunch","Jan 19, 2007"

3.68,-1.6,4,3.5,4,3,3.5,"The taste I lightly sweet, but quickly moves to a roasted grain tartness and it finishes with a note that is dominated by the husky grain not found in the nose. Notes of toasted, biscuit-like malt is quite prominent as well. Ample notes of chocolate help to round out the acidity and husky grain astringency. This beer is quite light on the palate, it makes for an easy quaffer and even the husky note does not linger for all that long. This is an enjoyable brew, an easy sipper that is good for a couple pints. While it is a bit out of balance, like most of the other breweries products, It is one of the better beers from them that I have had. For some reason the flavors just work here.","Gueuzedude","0"
