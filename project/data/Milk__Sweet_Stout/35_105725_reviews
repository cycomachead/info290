"Pours a dark brown color with an off white head.  Aroma of spices and roasted malt.  The flavor is a mix of roasted malt with a coffee like essence and a bit of ginger and cinnamon.  Clove and spices round out the aroma.  The taste is roasted with a yam like vegetable flavor but ample roast as it warms. Vanilla and cinnamon, roasted malt, slight bitterness.  Full bodied and smooth.  Pretty decent."

"Taste is gingerbread, fig, grape, with a spicy hop flavor. If is an interesting beer, but falls a little too much on the sweet side and a little heavy on the spice - cinnamon and nutmeg."

"Appearance is a black liquid with a foamy, sudsy light brown head.  The smell is just like gingerbread cookies...spicy ginger and sugar, backed with a little malt and alcohol.  The taste is sweet, but not cloying...a firm malt structure and lots of spice and ginger.  I a usually dubious of spicy gimmick holiday brews.  This one, however, is well made and a real treat.  Enjoyable and flavorful."

"I have liked a lot of the Sam Adams bigger stuff and this one was also good, but not as good as the others."

"A decent beer, fun for the holidays but not much else."

"This beer literally tastes exactly as described, its got all the traits of a stout, malts, coffee and dark chocolate, with a lovely cakey, cookie breadyness, gingersnaps, cinnamon and nutmeg. Definitely the perfect Christmas brew."
""
""
""
"I had a cold today. Tasted good but I reserve the right to change my opinion in future when I have full olfactory and taste."
""
""
"The flavor is a mix of ginger up front with some gently roasted malt and slight caramel quality but the flavor of ginger stays steady while the malt seems to thin or dry out mid palate with some caramel sweetness in the residual  and mild yeast in the flavor with some dry spicy flavor and alcohol in the finish with medium full body. Overall this is pretty solid for those who like ginger -relatively clean but somewhat thin in the realms of stouts. I like the way the ginger and dark malt are utilized -a pretty decent base stout that has a medium sweet quality. I would be open to having this again. I consider this a good winter warmer type ale"
""
""
""
"Medium-full body, maybe a bit over carbonated."
""
""
""
"Great taste, a little strong on the alchol in my opinion. But overall a really good beer."
"I love anything gingerbread. This stout is nice and smooth and being 9% I can enjoy it slow and feel good this holiday"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This to me is a great take on a seasonal beer.  I could drink these all winter long.  This would be a perfect desert beer.  After a meal this is like a liquid desert!  I highly suggest trying this.  I know I will be stocking up!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall/Comments: Overall this was a good beer that is worth a try.  I thought this had a great nose, appearance, and mouthfeel but was lacking a bit in the flavor department.  Interesting beer that was fun to drink and review!  Classified as a milk/sweet stout @ 9% ABV.  Consumed on  1-2-14."

"Typical malt, a little sweet, not as much spices as I would have liked, very faint hint of ginger. Bubbly"
""
""
"O:  Overall this is a pretty solid beer.  The gingerbread flavor is kind of subltle and overall the flavors aren't quite as bright as I would have liked.  A nice change of pace from other holiday beers though."

"Super sweet but I do enjoy this as a desert beer."
""

""
"Beautiful gingerbread and current nose. Thick, boozy fruitcake and molasses taste throughout. Sweetness and richness may be a bit much in a pint. Might be better sipping in small glass. Still, no bad."

"Overall: not bad for a winter warmer, a good blend of spices (like a great pumpkin ale + a good stout).  I’m not usually a fan of these spicy winter beers, but this one makes for a good sipper."

"Well Sam, you finally put out a decent beer. I heard this was drinkable and decided to give it a try. Stout is what its all about so when I went in search of a BA Pumking I saw this on the shelves, grabbed one and had it for Thanksgiving Breakfast. Not bad Sam, Not bad. Probably the best yet I've had from you."
""
""
""
""
"Not to bad, still, stouts don't seem to be Sam's strong suit. Not worth the $9 a bottle (22oz.) IMO."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I enjoyed Harpoon's UFO Gingerland a few times on my last visit to Boston, and I was hoping that the Boston Beer Company could pull off a related style with similar affect.  But this isn't to my taste."
""
""
"Nice spiced beer from Sam Adams you can't tell it is 9%. Pours a dark black color in a pint glass. No lacing and very little head that fades quick. Spice notes come out up front and a little alcohol on the back end but nothing to define the 9%. Goes good in a cold winter day"
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours black as a starless night.  World Class head, lacing and retention - especially for a 9% ABV.  As advertised, the nose is full of ginger, clove, nutmeg and cinnamon in roughly that order of composition.  Slightly above medium in body, the texture is slick with hints of creaminess.  Above average carbonation, with effervescence throughout.  The outstanding flavor profile is intense, quite complex and has a good bit of balance.  It begins with a burst of blended spice that flows into a mild bitterness.  The bitterness has roast and hop characteristics.  As the bitterness fades, the spices begin to separate against a sweet caramel background. As it warms, the caramel gains in intensity.  Clove and nutmeg dominate the end, but a light dark fruit (plum/raisin) is underneath.  The finish is quite complex as it fades - so many flavors become evident.  The 9% alcohol is masterfully hidden.  The only traces of it are that nice alcohol burn at the back of the throat.  If you want to taste the alcohol, you have to sip the massive head.  The only ""fault"" keeping this from a 4.5 World Class, is their decision to classify this as a stout.  There just isn't enough roast character.  Had they called it a porter, they would get a 4.5 from me.  This one is a true masterpiece of the brewer's art."

"	Always on the lookout for the most recent niche style brew, Samuel Adams rarely gets the nod… (Not to discredit any of their many enjoyable brews, they just never seem to be quite appealing as another…) But seein' lil' gingerbread homie with his broken leg had me sold… One of my first ""Winter Warmer's"" of this season and it poured quite thick, already a great sign, especially with it's beautiful 2 inch dark tan head… It seemed to have minimal carbonation, but it's hard to tell due to the opacity of the brew, also, the retention of the head and the lacing were both above average… Immediately on the nose was a nice heap of gingersnap, with a pleasant cinnamon spiciness amongst hints of cloves and wheat… As it first graced my tongue, the spice was the most prominent feature followed by a hefty gingerbread flavor… The stout ""fullness"" wasn't as pronounced as expected, with the finish definitely containing some roasty malts with a brown sugar sweetness to round everything out… The mouthfeel complimented the beer nicely, as the gingerbread wasn't overpowered by any other aspect, and the carbonation level made for a nice enjoyable drink every time… The spices reminded me of many Marzen/Oktoberfest style beers, but the sweetness balanced out this nice stout… I found this beer to be more of a dessert style brew, which was surprising for a stout, but none the less I feel like this would be a great way to end a holiday evening… Another good brew - Cheers!!"

"Pours a dark rusty brown with a large slowly fading creamy brown head. Aroma of sweet caramel malt, ginger bread and sugar cookie, molasses, nutmeg. Taste the same as aroma with mild toasted malt and bitterness. Palate is a medium to full body, good carbonation, mildly creamy. Finish the same as taste with a full flavored and mildly burnt toasted bitterness and dry ending. Overall would probably go well with some sugar or ginger bread cookies, a nice holiday brew."

"Pours a pitch black in color with a tan head. Some sticky lacing is seen with each sip. The aroma is like gingerbread cookies (which I would eat all year around if available). No other aroma really. The taste is a less bit intense than the aroma with some roasted hops in there as well. You don't taste the higher alcohol content. Goes down easy and really like this one. No bitter or harsh aftertaste either."
"O: It started out with all the marks of a really fantastic beer until I tasted it. I just doesn't have any flavor! Nothing when the beer first hits the palate, nothing mid-range, nothing on the back, nothing in the aftertaste. Just an extremely light roasted flavor and a hint of alcohol. I can't recommend this beer. It would work well as an aromatic candle for Christmas, but it tastes nothing like a quality stout and doesn't even touch the flavor of a cheap store bought gingerbread man. This beer leaves me kind of bummed out..."
""
""
""
"Surprisingly pours a thick black with a nice dark brown head. Decent smell of raisins and spices. No gingerbread. Heavy beer but the 9% ABV is very noticeable and is so prevalent that it is hard to enjoy. Cool bottle and drinking half of this gave a nice buzz."

"Poured into a Reuben's Brew snifter. Pours pitch black, opaque in the glass with a finger of light brown head that dissipates to a thick cap and lacing. Aroma of sweet dark malt, slightly toasty and gingerbread, as advertised. Flavor is sweet dark malt, hints of lactose, gingerbread, cinnamon and a light hop finish, which actually gives the impression of the spicier types of gingerbread with bite. Medium bodied with light creaminess. I waited to drink this because it seemed a little gimmicky, but I have to say they pulled it off. Nice sweet malt body supports the gingerbread spicing which is well done. The alcohol is well covered. Much better than I expected and a very nice winter stout. I'd buy this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very good. This is a great winter seasonal. It's most similar to another of my favorites: St. Arnold's Pumpkinator."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A nice beer, glad to try it, I may have served it a little too warm."
""
"Mouthfeel: A slight roughness, but overall satisfying, full enough to satisfy as one would want a milk stout to do, but perhaps a bit thinner than one might expect."
""
""

""
""
""

""

"O: You have to like sweet beers to like this one, but if you do, you'll love it. It took me some searching to find, but It was well worth the time and effort. Im glad it's a yearly release."

"Poured into a tulip glass from the tap. Pours pitch black with a nice brown head. Smells of gingerbread cookies with sme cinnamon. Tastes of gingerbread, chocolate, and spices. Beer is full bodied, good carbonation, nice finish. Overall a very good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a great dessert beer for sipping on cold evenings."
""

"Overall: this beer is decent enough, but it could be a lot smoother. The spicing works out great in the aroma, not so much anywhere else."
""
""
""
""
"Dark brown pour settled into a near black liquid into the glass, and the head above that was khaki in color, and two fingers thick. The smell of the beer was very malty and had aromas of cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg. The smell wasn't particularly like gingerbread, but the taste was a little closer. The ginger was heavier in the taste, and the malt was most like brown sugar. There were also flavors of cinnamon and nutmeg in the taste, making it more complex. than the cookies. The wheat in the malt was also evident in the bock like bready flavor. The label mentions cloves, but those were not easily detectable for me under the other spices. The mouthfeel was a lot thinner than most stouts, and the finish had some lingering spice. This beer was nice winter seasonal."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied. It goes down rather quick and easy, leaving a little residue on the back and middle of the tongue. Carbonation is easy going."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: While Merry Maker scores well in three out of four categories, it lacks in the most important department—the flavor. This brew truly lives up to its name as a gingerbread stout, and even though I have nothing against gingerbread men (they're my favorite holiday treats), Sam Adams has gone slightly overboard in the sweetness department. If they tone down the sugariness (is that a word?) of this brew, I can see it being one of my seasonal ""must-haves"". Until then, however, one bottle of Merry Maker has been more than enough to last me a lifetime."
""
"Merry Maker pours a blackish color with no head. There is an aroma filled with gingerbread and cinnamon. The taste also has a strong gingerbread flavor, with cinnamon, and frosting notes. Very good flavors, but overall its a bit light. Overall its a very tasty beer, wish it was just a bit richer in taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: If only the flavors lived up to the aromatics, but this beer lacks depth and body; surprising, for a 9 percenter"
"This looks really good in the glass, but for me, the spices overpower the ale-iness. IMHO, this is just another sweet drink covering a modest amount of ethanol."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a fantastic smelling and tasting beer, but the mouthfeel really hinder those two characteristics from being the stars they would otherwise be. I will say this--I'm likely to seek this one out for at least one drink each season, especially since Sam Adams is the only brewer doing a gingerbread stout that I'm aware of."
""
""
""
"This is an interesting seasonal beer by the Boston Beer Company. I would buy this again."
""
""
""
"O - I give Sam Adams credit on this one. Many of their newer beers they sell in those bombers are just OK, but this is a very good beer, and at a reasonable price. Very tasty stout that's highly drinkable and not overly filling. Highly recommend this brew to any stout fans."
""
""
""
"Jet black in color with a thin light brown head. Nutmeg,ginger,and cinnamon in the aroma. I do think they nailed the gingerbread aroma! Mouth is silky and creamy. Lots of molasses,nutmeg,cinnamon,and ginger along with a bit of dark malt. The spices dominate,but do not overwhelm. This is a bit more of a sweet dessert type of beer. The sweetness dissipates as it warms so don't drink it ice cold and you will enjoy it more."
"3.25 D: Not bad, but for a $7-8 bomber, I expect a better product."
""
""
"Black in color. Forms a moderate sized, creamy, dark tan colored head. Aroma is, unsurprisingly, gingerbread. Moderate sweetness. Ginger, brown bread, molasses, with a dark caramel maltiness. Taste is similar. Mildly sweet, but the flavor is a bit thin. Again ginger and molasses. Mild breadiness. Dark malts. Full bodied. Lower carbonation. Sort of Reminiscent of gingerbread, but not quite sweet enough. Ends up tasting like a spiced winter beer (which I guess it is)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Notes: The spices are powerful, the sweetness is a little cloying. In small doses this is fine."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: For only a mere few bucks, this was a really nice Christmas entry."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I like the nutmeg, cinnamon and bakery spiciness that makes up the character of the taste. Dark sweet malts are there but more subtle. Decent earthy hop bitterness that pulls up from behind. The alcohol is well-integrated but I would still define this one as a sipper."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Black in color. Poured with a huge, thick, dark beige foam that hung around for a while. Foam slowly reduced to a thick cap that left thick sheets of lacings on the glass. Undeniable sweet gingerbread aroma is immediately noticeable along with cinnamon, clove and spice. Sugar and spice aromas tend to overwhelm the roasted malt aromas, but they are there in the background. Medium bodied with a slightly thick, creamy smooth feel and light subdued carbonation at the back end. Sweet gingerbread and cinnamon flavors up front, spicy hop flavors through the middle followed by dark roasted malt flavors to the end. Finishes with a spicy hop bite followed by lingering roasted malt aftertaste. You pretty much get what the label says you’re gonna get, gingerbread and spice. Certainly not your everyday “go to” stout but a pleasant holiday brew nonetheless."
""
"O: A nice winter beer. Stronger that I was expecting. Share with friends. Throw in a chocolate chip cookie or cheddar cheese."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great Christmas brew. I'm not a ginger in my beer fan, but the malt and sweetness counter nicely, making this enjoyable. The ginger is just a touch overdone."

""
"Poured into a pint glass from an oversized 1 pint 6 ounce bottle ($6.99 per bottle) Dark stout with a nice half inch tan head. Smells delicious. Tastes almost as good. 9% ABV but it doesn't taste ""boozey."" Expensive but worth a try if you're looking for a good winter beer."
""
"Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel of this beer is on the thin for a stout but this beer still has great flavor profile for a Sam Adams."
""
"I'm really happy with this. It's easy to drink, has a well-hidden alcohol level and has great flavors. Really, nothing not to like."
""
""
""
"O - And, really, the flavor feels watered down, too. I'm not quite sure what happened here. The nose is a big, fat, cheap gingerbread cookie. There is really nothing big, fat, or decadent in the taste or feel. I'd almost welcome a more cloying version that was so sweet it was hard to finish; it would be more true to the promise. As is, this beer is not really offensive, but it is somewhat disappointing."
""
""
""
""
"This beer was treat and I really liked it. Had all the dark and big roast of any well made stout plus the pleasant cookie spices. The malt was stalwart and unflinching, the earth was subtle. It leaves dry and with a slight bitter in the aftertaste to contrast the sweet and silken molasses."
""
"O - Worth a try, if you are into the pumpkin/cinnamon/mildly sweet vein."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pretty good stuff. The festive spices, so commonly associated with gingerbread and pumpkin pie, are this one's main attraction."
"One of Sam Adam's better beers for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Overall I enjoyed the Marry Maker. From the appearance to the taste. The after taste to me is very important and I would have to say that this beer gives off a nice after taste, taste like gingerbread."
"O: Not very tasty, goes down ok, strong kick, slightly filling, not the best representation of style but the flavor makes sense for a Christmas beer."
""
""
"O - Merry Maker is a solid spiced milk stout that is appropriate for the season. It's a bit boozy and a bit thin for such a heavy stout, but it has a nice blend of spices and smells/looks great. An enjoyable beer that you should check out if you're in the mood for something sweet with spice."
""
""
""
""
""
"Over all I guess this beer is like waking up and getting coal for Christmas you go down stairs all excited expecting greatness and are left with a dark piece of disappointment. Because at the end of the day I buy beer to drink it not smell it"
""
"O: A decent stout on its own accord, but not impressive as a Christmas beer, certainly not reminiscent of gingerbread. That's not to say it wasn't good, just that it fell short of my expectations (especially after the rather enjoyable ""Fat Jack"" pumpkin ale they turned out a few months ago)."
""
""
""
""
"The single worst beer that I have had this year.  Two sips then down the drain the bottle went.  Horrible metallic taste with absolutely no nutmeg, ginger, etc.  I like Hardywood an decided to try this as an easy to obtain alternative. Bad move, do not waste your time with this slop."
"Pours black with a nice tan head. Decent retention, and very nice lacing. Aroma is of ginger, spice, brown sugar, and chocolate. Full bodied with some carbonation. Taste is just an explosion of spices, with hints of chocolate. Very smooth, yet there is quite a nice burn. Excellent!"
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass, with about 2 fingers of head. Just had a rival gingerbread ale from Blue Moon, and this one killed it. Nice aroma with cinnamon, ginger, and cloves up front and center. Mouth-feel is terrific, and goes down with a hint of warming alcohol at the end. Very drinkable beer, wanted another after I finished. Highly recommend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" What a disappointment . It has no distinct flavor of ANYTHING. It tastes like a watery mix of spice. I was really looking forward to a robust ginger stout. I can't even get a HINT of ginger anywhere in this beer. PASS ON THIS ONE!"
""
""
""
""
""
"It is the total personification of liquid Gingerbread that wins the all 5's for this brew."
"Was hoping for more..."
""
""
""

"Ahh...very VERY nice!"

"O - Overall, a great seasonal spin on a sweet stout. I am a fan, and will be buying more throughout the season, especially with friends over."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - The sweetness and spices in the nose are overpowering, but the taste is well-balanced. The gingerbread flavor is striking, but at the same time Merry Mischief manages to fit the bill for a stout. Different, but delicious."
""
""
""
"Pours a deep chocolate brown with deep walnut brown showing thru when held to the light,a nice looking creamy near mocha colored head atop.Alot of roast in the nose along with spicy ginger and sweet alcohol lingering.Flavors are heavily roasted with a bit of char at the onset,the spiced notes come in the back end with ginger,and clove standing out mainly,alot of roast and dry earthiness to this milk stout.The alcohol becomes more prevalent as it warms as well the sweetness derived from it,not overly spiced but not a bad beer."

"Poured into a pint glass."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall this was a very unique beer for me. It was spicy and sweet. Overpowering on both but again, would of went well with food/desert. Alcohol was there but the sweetness masked it a bit. I am definitely gonna pick up another bottle and sit on it for a while. Although I would recommend drinking it with friends and food."

"O: Overall this is a spicy, holiday, chocolate dessert style beer. The ginger comes on strong at times, though is managebale perhaps in servings smaller then original packaging (bomber). The malting was nice here, deep and rich, Reserved for small sampling size and perhaps as a after dinner dessert beer."

"22 ounce bottle into snifter; batch 1, bottled in 10/2012. Pours dense pitch black color with a 1 finger dense dark khaki with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, gingerbread, toast, dark bread, roasted malt, molasses, toffee, floral, and light roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of spices and dark malt notes. Taste of dark chocolate, toffee, roasted malt, cinnamon, nutmeg, gingerbread, toast, clove, dark bread, molasses, floral, and light roasted earthiness. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, toffee, roasted malt, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, dark bread, toast, clove, molasses, and light roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance of roasted malt flavors with spices with good complexity; with a nice malt/spice balance; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent spiced imperial stout! Great balance of dark malt and spice flavors with good complexity; and very smooth to sip on. Really enjoyed this one."
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is really good. Dark hue, giant head, and fair enough lacing. Nose is a great combination of fall spices with some nice lightly roasted coffee. Flavor is a bitter, roasted, malty combination with a consideration of spice, but ultimately nothing really there. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."
""
"I poured this into a tulip glass, it has a black color body with a 2' tan head, which hung around for a bit. The smell is very spicy of ginger, nutmeg and some cinnamon. The taste has a very strong ginger flavor that follow with the nutmeg and clove. Then the roasted malt come in behind it. The mouth feel is very nice, kinda thick but not too thick. It leaves just a little bit of a after taste but not too much. Overall i think this is a good winter beer. I couldn't drink a bunch of them at a time but once in a while is good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Certainly not subtle on the spicing here, the Ginger was perhaps too dominant. I'm reminded more of an assertive pumpkin ale than a sweeter Gingerbread holiday flavor. That said this is very drinkable for a strong stout, aftertaste cleaned up nicely and the body was smooth."
""
""
""
"D: This was a very nice holiday beer. It had tons of ginger scent and taste, but was still balanced by other elements. It had a big body and a fairly smooth finish, with well hidden alcohol, so it was pretty easy to drink. Not really sure how it would age, but I like it now. Recommended to at least try."
"O - The only beer I've had better than this is PUMPKINATOR, and they're both so similar, I can honestly say that DESERT IMPERIAL STOUT IS A FANTASTIC IDEA! So, come on with it folks, gimme some apple pie stout so I'll never waste money on desert again."
""
""
""
"Not a bad experience but I wouldn't want more than the one bottle."

"Unless you love ginger then you won’t really like this beer. As with all stouts, as it warmed up more flavor came out – unfortunately the flavor was ginger, which is great with sushi but not in this beer. This was very disappointing for me as I had very high expectations. Tough to finish this bomber alone, so sadly some was poured down the drain."
"O - This would be fine if split 3 or 4 ways. An entire bottle is too much ginger for one human."

"i have liked most of these sam specials. this one may be my favorite. its black with a head the color of ginger bread cookies. the smell is full of spices and brown sugar. smells like ginger bread cookies. the taste is bitter followed by sweet spices. this beer makes me think of christmas. bottle was $5.50 for a pint at 9%abv its a steal."

"Overall, this is an okay beer. It gets a bit better as it warms, but for me, it never really seems to come together. Maybe it would improve with a bit more aging."

"O: Overall the alcohol is pretty well hidden in this beer but it is just a little too light in the mouthfeel to be as enjoyable as I hoped - the flavors and aromas are very pleasant and remind me of gingerbread."

"This poured out as a dark black color, kinda thick looking with a cream colored head on top. The retention was minimal and very little lacing as well. The smell of the beer is loaded with spice, not much of anything else really showing through here. The taste of is also spicy with a subtle malt sweetness in there while finishing dry and spicy. The mouthfeel is sharp, not overly smooth like I think it should be. There is a decent thickness to the beer though. Overall it's a decent brew. Glad I got to try it."

"It’s an interesting idea and it smelled good but it came up a little short in the gingerbread beer concept."
""
""
"O – This is a decent stout. The spices that are listed on the bottle are certainly apparent and are actually a little overpowering. With all the spices, many classic stout features are masked or lost. Nevertheless, it is a tasty and drinkable beer that is well-suited for the holidays."

"Pours nearly black body with thick thick dark beige/brown head. Thick lacing of glass. Smell is lightly spiced. Taste is very ginger/spice forward, sweet with a harsh backbite note possibly clove.Alchohol is definately notable. An interesting Stout."

"Overall: One of the better SA small batch series in terms of being what it aimed to be... this is a good conversation piece and has some extremely complex elements to it. I'm not sure the recipe is perfect yet, and I'm convinced they won't improve or alter it for the future, but the focus on spice is a bit too narrow, in my opinion."
""
"I have to say I had my doubts at first but Samuel Adams has really pulled off a good one. This beer is so gingerbread like it is scary. Like someone put a pulverized gingerbread man into a stout. I really wish I would've tried this earlier so I could have picked up another bottle to age."
"Pours a dark brown with a finger of tan head. There is slight lacing on the glass as the head recedes to a thin cap which persists for the duration. The aroma is strong of gingerbread cookie. The taste follows the nose with gingerbread spices, molasses, and brown sugar. The brew had a spicy mouthfeel with a faint pleasant burning sensation on the lips and a lively presence on the palate. Delicious. I hope that SA will make this more widely available in the future. Id gladly pick up a 6er of this if it was available. If you don't care for the taste of gingerbread you probably won't like this beer though."
"Overall: Well-integrated alcohol and the spice character was pleasant without being over-the-top. I thought it was better than I had expected."

"O: This beer has an interesting taste and does resemble gingerbread, but overall I thought it would be much better if it had a fuller mouthfeel to support its strength. The alcohol is well hidden from the taste."

"O-pretty solid beer, definitely strong gingerbread presence, abv is hidden quite well but it could have used a bit more body and creaminess"
""
"Pours a very dark brown in color, almost black, with a creamy brown head. Aromas of figs, and a hint of ginger. Taste begins with some light chocolate, followed by some plums, then some dark bread, then some herbal and nutty flavors. The finish has a big ginger flavor to it. Mouthfeel is a touch light, but smooth. Overall a very nice sweet stout, though it is somewhat surprising that it is not richer, considering the alcohol content and added milk sugar."
""
""
"Pours a light tan, four-finger head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Jet black color, no highlights. Good carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Ginger and clove nose. Flavor is almost like gingerbread, well balanced, higher ABV is hidden. $7.25 for a 22oz bottle from Tully’s Beer & Wine Wells, Me."

"Not a bad beer from Sam Adams. Opaque, dark brown pour with a small tan head that receded to a ringlet and left a bit of lacing on the glass. Spicy aroma, it's not a full blown gingerbread cookie, but I got cinnamon, ginger, primarily, you know, Christmasy, winter warmery. More of the same in the taste, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, dark malts, cocoa powder, a touch of earthy hop bitterness. Medium body, medium carbonation, pretty good overall. Kind of reminded me more of a heavier winter warmer or a spiced strong ale than a stout."
""
"This pours a very dark brown color with a medium brown head. There is a semi-malty and spice aroma. The taste is decently bold with mostly malts and spices. It’s fairly decent for a stout, but I was expecting a little different taste for something that was suppose to have gingerbread spices."
"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. A foamy latticework of lace coats the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, slight cocoa, and a variety of spices like cinnamon and clove. Taste is of dark roasted malt, mild spices, and a salty soy sauce flavor. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and full bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that sounds good on paper but isn't done all that well in my opinion."

"So, I really am not a fan of Samuel Adams, but when I saw that this was the last one on the shelf I picked it up. It pours pitch black with a dark tan head with nice retention. The lacing is magnificent. It clings to the walls of the glass and then performs a slow, elegant dance as it retreats back into the black depths from which it came. Aesthetically, this beer is absolutely perfect. The aroma carries strong aromas of alcohol, along with ginger, cinnamon, and nutmeg. A hint of clove is also present. The taste carries hints of dark toasted malt and classic holiday spices. The cloves and nutmeg really shine through on the palate. The finish is laced with hints of chocolate and the previously mentiontioned holiday spice. The mouthfeel thick with low carbonation. Man, This beer is a home run. Every holiday beer should be this good."

"This one pours like motor oil with a jet black body topped by a two finger tan head with decent retention and lacing. Aroma of cinnamon, nutmeg, gingerbread, caramel, vanilla and brown sugar. Very seasonally appropriate. Flavor is well done and I was shocked it wasn't too sweet with breads, cinnoman, vanilla, mild roasted malt, gingerbread. Full body and light to moderate carbonation. I was actually really surprised by this one. It's flavorful but not overdone. An excellent seasonal."

"The recently opened Nevins Brew House had the Merry Mischief on tap and it was goood! The beer was poured into an 8oz sniffer. It was black opaque in color with a thin tan head that did not lace. The smell was bolstered by black licorice (sp?). The taste had hints of anis, but i tasted more chocolate and ginger as well. The mouthfeel was full in body with subtle cabonation. Overall this was a great seasonal stout and I would have this over and over."

"O - Decent enough but the flavours did not produce a gingerbread like profile as expected."
"O - I'll pass on this one next time, dominating spice drowns out the chocolate character."

"An oily midnight black body with a foamy mocha cap. The head falls slowly to a thin layer of foam with some mild lacing. The nose is a little abrasive at first. Molasses is prominent, with ginger, nutmeg, and cinnamon in tow. A touch of roast hangs in the background. On the palate, syrupy molasses coats the tongue with spices quickly overwhelming the palate. Nutmeg and ginger stand out most with some cinnamon in the background. Some very mild roast comes through as this warms. Overly sweet, cloyingly so, with the molasses just pummeling the taste buds; everything is secondary. A touch of English bittering hops in the finish. Syrupy body, with some robust flavors, but this was off-putting for me. I couldn't handle the whole bottle myself. The gingerbread flavors are all there, heavy on the molasses though, so it definitely hits the style points, but this didn't quite jive with my palate."
"Pours an opaque black with a two finger fluffy, light tan head. Above average retention, abundant splotchy lacing. Alot of spice on the nose, ginger being most prominent, followed by cinnamon, nutmeg, and hints of clove. The taste follows the nose with added chocolate, but the spicing is far too strong and completely dominates as the base beer is difficult to discern. Moderate to low carbonation, smooth with a hint of velvet. This beer has a lot of promise, however, the amount of spices used is excessive. With some changes in the recipe, this beer could become an excellent holiday treat."

"Overall – A rather tasty stout with a nice sweet and spiced flavor. While rather heavy in the gingerbread cookie spices up front, they dwindle down as the taste advanced, never really getting the chance to overpower the brew and producing overall a rather nice and flavorful stout."
"O: I enjoyed this take on a sweet stout, though it wasn't as balanced as I would've liked. With a bigger appearance from the roasted malts, this could have been much better. As is, it is a flawed, but unique take on one of my favorite styles that I'll try again on occasion."

"I was really looking forward to this one, but have been underwhelmed. It's just another stout with spice and poorly-hidden alcohol."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I thought this beer was alright and I thought it was a slightly above average example of style, the spices really showed up in this beer and that made it a little unbalanced, it needs more stout flavors and aromas to bring some balance to this beer and make it more stout like. This beer had ok drinkability, it went down fairly smooth, and the flavors held my attention, but I think one bomber is enough for me, after that the sweetness and spices might become too much. The alcohol was hidden very well, it's hard to believe this is 9%. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma, it was pretty good and it had some gingerbread like quality's to it. What I liked the least about this beer was how unbalanced it was, if this beer had more balance it would be pretty damn good. I would buy a bottle of this if it's released next year, but I don't think I will be going back to get another bottle for this season, the price was good and I recommend this to just about anyone. All in All this was another solid beer from Samuel Adams, it wasn't as great as I was hoping it would be but it was still pretty good, I just wish it had more Stout aspects to it. Good job guys, this is a nice Christmas time beer."
""
"Beer is gingery, but not overwhelmingly spicy. It is fine but thin, very thin, dry finish, too dry. Mild aftertaste of cloves and ginger, mild nutmeg. It was fine but as stated previously, this could have been better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a good brew for the season, I did however find myself wishing some of the flavors were a little more bold and pronounced. For 9%ABV, it is very drinkable and pairs well with all of the various chocolate desserts that come with Christmas time."
""
""
""
"Overall: Sam Adams beers aren't always up my alley, but this one hits the spot. Great beer for the holidays."
"D - The spices are prominent and they initially promise to work well with the dark, bready malt, but in the end it is just too much. The sweetness is excessive and this makes the spice character feel cloying as well. It needs some sharpness to counteract the cloying, flabby malt and spice character. Overall, this reminds me more of a bad flavored coffee drink than a stout, with too much spice, too much sweetness and nothing to balance."
""
""
""
""
"O - The more I drank this beer, the more I enjoyed it. I thought it was a bust at first with the strong spics up front. As this beer opens up the richness of the stout becomes more prominent. It is a very well made stout, and the spices give it a holiday spin. It's worth a try if you like gingerbread and stouts. If you do not like spices then stay away."

"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a snifter. Beige head, good retention on a black body. Oily and soapy lacing, tiny bubbles. Aroma includes nutmeg, slight coffee, some faint hop bitterness and a touch of alcohol. Taste has a nice roasted quality with a moderate sweetness, some vanilla and nutmeg, really nice flavor. Thick mouthfeel, very, very easy to drink considering the high abv. No alcohol taste, high abv AND delicious is a very dangerous combination."
""
"Overall, it's a pretty rich, complex dessert beer. The 9% ABV is almost undetectable. Good, interesting beer."
"22oz bottle poured into a 25oz snifter is black like molasses with a frothy tan head, great retention, excellent lacing all the way down the glass. Aromas are spicy like gingerbread: clove, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg as they reveal on the label, not much else - maybe a hint of roasted barley. Tastes are clove, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, roasted barley, cream, molasses, cookie dough seems to be there too, alcohol is well concealed, especially for 9%. Mouth-feel is creamy & smooth, medium body. Overall, good for what it is...it actually tastes like gingerbread. Nice work!"
"Over all a fantastic beer, well suited for the holidays."

"Looks like motor oil pouring into a glass. Absolutely pitch black with three fingers of fluffy tan head. Smells very nice. Cloves, ginger and a touch of citrus strike the nose. Very clean aroma. Very smooth taste. Clove and cinnamon followed by a touch of sweetness with a spiced aftertaste. Alcohol taste is well hidden though I feel a warming effect after the third sip so this is definately strong. Just a touch heavy on the clove I think, and could benefit from just a little more sweetness."
""
"Cinnamon and old leather on the most. Pleasently creamy body and relatively smooth. Chocolate and roasted malt upfront followed by holiday spices. Faintly reminiscent of a ginger bread cookie but not as much as you expect. Slightly burnt tasting at times. Simple but has flavors that go together. A nice sweet stout that doesn't push limits or offend. Alcohol is undetectable which is nice. Made for people who drink only Sam Adams but won't venture any further into the craft world."
""
"Overall: Not the most complex of the Sam Adams special releases, but a quality beer if you like ginger. I could see myself getting this once a winter, but craving it more than that."

"83 = B"
"The beer pours proper stouty black, with a nice big tan head on it. The bubbles are tight and creamy, but the body is pitch black and opaque, but looked relatively clear as it went into the glass. The lacing on my glass is really quite droopy and thin, leaving little dots across the glass. On the nose, the beer smells sweet and spicy with cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and a touch of ginger, which really isn’t surprising seeing as how those are the spices that were used in the beer. The cinnamon is the strongest in smell as far as the spices go, but below the spices sits a strong helping of roasted malts and a touch of black coffee, which is really quite inviting. Hot alcohol is also present and accentuated with the spices, though that isn’t really a bad thing. The slurry of all of these smells helps to suggest slight dark fruit notes in the beer, as well. The beer tastes terrifically bizarre and spicy. The beer begins with roast mingling with dark raisin notes, these flavors continue (especially the roast) but the rest of the beer opens into ginger bread hints that quickly build and climax in the middle of the taste, before petering out into a stale cinnamon flavor. The aftertaste is of watered down spices, and comes far too quickly, making me wish the gingerbread flavors would stay for awhile. On the mouthfeel, the beer is creamy and smooth. The body is medium, with hints of being both lighter and thicker, and after the beer passes, the mouth is left slightly dry with pooling spittle just barely ebbing over the tongue. Overall this is a great holiday beer with a nice gimmicky flavor. I do wish the gingerbread flavor would stick around longer, but I get the feeling that would be very difficult to brew in a balanced way. A solid holiday brew from Sam Adams, and definitely worthy of a taste, or a Christmas tasting."

"Overall: A decent holiday beer although for something advertised as a gingerbread stout, I was looking for more gingerbread flavor. The malt seems to cover up the spices a little bit. Comparable to a decent pumpkin beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- it's not necessarily bad persay, just not exactly what I was expecting overall. Wouldn't mind seeing this thrown into the holiday mix pack, just wouldn't buy a bomber again though"
""
"Flavor is very heavily spiced with cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger; almost like pumpkin pie spicing. Roasted malts, a mild and earthy hop bitterness, caramel, and a hint of lactose round out the flavor. It’s well-carbonated, the body medium-light, but lacking some of that smooth and full-bodied creaminess that I look for in a milk stout."
""

"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a very thick, dark brown coloring that borders on black, with an opaque character that is devoid of highlighting colors. A small, low profile head of dark tan rests on top, but quickly settles into a sparse, filmy coating as the beer sits for a bit. Good looking beer. Aromas of sweet gingerbread, roasted and baked dough, a spice profile rich in ginger, cinnamon, and nutmeg, some banana sweetness, and a touch of booze, as well. Smells like a rich, warming brew. Flavors are round and robust in mouth, and gingerbread is in the forefront. Nutmeg and ginger quickly coat the taste buds, with an underlying boozey backbone that flows over and then whisks the palate clean. Molasses sweet in the background, with a hint of roasted coffee, as well, but both are subtle and supporting. The beer is smooth and light in mouth, but the flavor profile packs a wallop on your sense of taste. A very fulfilling and grandoise brew. The aftertaste is very mild compared to what has been experienced thus far, with a touch of ginger, buttery bread, and a hint of sugary sweet all blending together. The finish is clean and smooth, and the higher ABV helps to once again clean everything up. Very strong stout, both in flavor and substance. Very tasty, and a great wintertime imbibe. Good beer."

"o - Overall I wasn't a huge fan of this one and my girlfriend hated it. Too much pine and spruce/christmas tree in the nose for me, and it lingered in the taste as well. Seems like people like it but I probably wouldn't look to have it again."

"O - With a nicely blended, not over-the-top, mélange of spices and full base of roasted malt, Samuel Adams Merry Mischief puts a welcome spin on an imperial stout that's not so imperial feeling. If you find yourself spending extended time in the cold this winter season, trade in your mug of hot cocoa for a delectable Merry Mischief when you get back inside."
"This was an ok stout, there was some good initial flavor but the syrupy texture was too much to make it enjoyable."

"Overall: Hit the nail on the head with this one. Pretty accurate representation of the style, and definitely a gingerbread stout. Too sweet for my liking, and it got sickening near the end of the bomber, but I difinitely got what I paid for."
"D - Excellent appearance, taste and mouthfeel... The aroma is a bit of let down... The net result is a very nice and slightly unique holiday offering from the fine folks at Boston Beer... Surprisingly quaffable and hides its 9% ABV rather well... I'll gladly indulge this one each holiday season, but may drink more if it came in 12 oz bottles..."
"Merry Mischief pours out a very deep brown with a sizable mocha head. The aroma is awesome, it's really got a nice gingerbread spice thing going on here. Cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. The taste is really gingerbread all the way through. Beneath the nutmeg, cinnamon, and cloves from the nose, there's a bit of a brown sugar flavor, vanilla, and chocolate. The mouthfeel feels a little thin to me, I wouldn't mind a little more chewiness on this. The drinkability is solid. Overall, this is a great beer that delivers on the first part of the label. There's plenty of gingerbread here and less traditional stout flavors. Tasty!"
""
"Meh. After a few sips, I can't stand the mouthfeel. I'm going to go with a drain pour, even if the ABV should allow some aging."
"Pours a very dark black with brown foam. Sits a top. Some lacing. Smells like a gingerbread man (shocker!) -cinamon, nutmeg, ginger. Taste is lightly sweet, cookie-ish, with a light hop finish. Roasted at the end too. Nice blend, good seasonal."
""
"Really not a fan of this beer at all. The smell was the best part and then it just took a drastic turn."
""
"Tastes like a bitter gingerbread cookie, not because it's burnt, but as if it has no sugar. This misses the mark on the stout side. It's full bodied with a low carbonation level. The aftertaste is chocolatey with plenty of cinnamon and nutmeg."
""
""
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being a little below average. Overall, I really liked the aroma and thought they nailed the gingerbread flavor. The taste though seemed to get overshadowed by the spices. A little less spice and more of the stout flavors would have gone a long way in the taste. Overall a pretty good beer though."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a deep dark brown with a medium brown head. Head had a bit of side cling and left a tad of lacing. Predominant aroma was definitely reminiscent of gingerbread, mostly cinnamon and nutmeg, a bit of the sweet lactose aroma came out as time went on. Taste was very slightly sweet up front before ending with a peppery bitter note. Coated the mouth as it should, but needed a tad more carbonation in the mouth. Unfortunately didn't really work as a milk stout, nor did it live up to the gingerbread title."
"O: Overall, a very well done gingerbread stout. I had GBS from Hardywood brewing earlier this week and this is nearly as good, easier to find and cheaper. Hard to compare of course, but the one thing that I do not pick up in here are the frosting like flavors. There are however more roasted caramelized sugars and toffee flavors present which seem to be more well done than the Hardywood GBS."
""
"Overall this is a good offering. I don't understand why there is not more spice in the taste when the spices are present in the smell. It is sweet, like a milk stout should be, but a few more hops would be nice to balance the sweetness."
""
""
""
"I'm honestly quite impressed by this one. I'm really not a hater but Samuel Adams normally fall a bit flat for me. This is sweet, flavorful and it delivers on the gingerbread spices. It may not be earth shattering or ground breaking but this is a very good holiday seasonal stout that I plan on enjoying several more times in the future."
""
""
"The bottle art is the best part of this beer."
""
"O-its a holiday stout from Sam Adams. don't expect an epic concoction of flavors. to be satisfied, just expect an average christmas flavored ale. its a bit too artificial tasting to be a great imperial stout. minus the gingerbread and autumn spices, it's still just a tad bit too sweet. definitely drinks like a 9% beer with its thickness. I suggest to drink this with a friend. few people here will want the whole bottle of this. only get this if you're very curious, but don't get your hopes up."
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the nose. There was an interesting smoke to the malts, with relatively genuine gingerbread spice and breadiness. What was really surprising, actually, was the licorice bite through the taste. This helped to cut the cloying white and cooked brown sugar sweetness. By the bottom of the glass the drinkability was a bit hindered by this sweetness, making the drinker ease up and slow down for the last half. This is more of a dessert beverage, and would be best suited to split with someone after a meal, or with a nice fudge brownie."
""
""
"O: A different approach from the usual Christmas time stout. I liked it. But it was from a tap. had to let it sit for 10 mins. Well worth the wait"
"Though personally prefering a heartier roast beer for such assertive spice addition, I think that this fine ale suffers from being a little too dry and roasty which exposes a slight ashy and burr textures that could have been rounded out by a little extra sweetness from barley malt or from more confident milk sugar taste."
""
"For a Christmas offering it's pretty decent. The ginger might be a little much for my taste though."
""
"O - A pretty impressive showing from SA. Christmas in a bottle. Kind of a gimmick, as it's hard to find any other flavors beneath the spices, but it's done so well that I enjoyed it despite it's flaw. Probably a repeat buy for me next winter."
""
"O: The smell has a nice gingerbread note without showing the base beer enough. The flavor allows the base beer to come through more appropriately, but has a ginger flavor that overwhelms. With some tweaks, this good be good. As is, it's mediocre."
"O - 3.75 - Not bad, but underwhelming and doesn't quite come together, seemingly trapped between cohesive styles. There's also a hole in its middle where the flavor goes diffuse and vague."

"Its very easy to drink and rich, bold and sweet. The ginger bread comes in sort of tart which makes it easier to drink plus the sweetness balances with the spices really nicely. If it tasted just a bit more like the graham cracker crust it'd be perfect but it's still an amazing beer. The ginger shines and I really like ginger so I really like this beer. Especially mixing in with the amazing sweet malts they chose for this."
""
"a cool winter brew, but this was a let down to me in a few ways. the pour is sensational, really dark and thick, with a delicate but excitable dark brown head. the nose is more spice than gingerbread i think, lots of nutmeg and clove, a touch of ginger, and dark roasty coffee smelling malts. the taste is also more spiced than necessary, lots and lots of nutmeg. it doesnt taste like gingerbread to me, but it tastes good nonetheless. lots of burnt malt, a bit of residual sugar, and a velvety smooth texture that really makes this beer. as a holiday stout or something id like it better, but i was hoping for fresh baked gingerbread, and the malt profile and the spice blend fail to deliver that. a good beer overall though, with an abv that is just right this time of year. worth the price per bomber, but dont come into this expecting gingerbread."

"Black as coal with a sudsy, brown head. Strong aroma of gingerbread, accompanied by spice and florals. The gingerbread flavor is spot on and has a creamy aftertaste not unlike icing. The high abv is noticeable but doesn't effect the flavor. This is a really wunique, well-balanced Christmas brew. This beer, after a while it develops an unpleasant aftertaste. Whether it's due to warming or my palate being exhausted by all the spice, I don't know, but I think this one would be better shared among a few friends."

"Poured into a large brandy snifter. Pours black with a little more than a finger-length tan head. The head retreats slowly, leaving a little bit atop the beer and a circular ring of lace. I detect some of those spice aromas of ginger, clove, and nutmeg. I get some of those dark roasted malts, chocolate, and coffee as well. The taste follows the nose, but I definitely do get those milk stout notes with the chocolate, mild coffee, and dark roasted malt notes. The ginger is pretty forward and I do get some of those other spices. It definitely does taste sweet, which lends itself more to sipping. That's not a bad idea with the 9% ABV. The body is medium with a smooth mouthfeel. This is a sipper. This is a very good beer. It doesn't quite measure up to some of the other beers in this series."
""
""
"O: The finish to this beer is extraordinary, it tastes just like those old gingerbread loaves from my college days. There is a big nostalgia factor to this beer. Not just what I've mentioned earlier, but the fact that the huge spice flavour is heavily reminiscent of a circa 2006 Old Fezziwig. I've always loved this offering, but I feel it's lost something over the years. This effort is bringing it back. Really good stuff, I wish they'd market this in 6-packs at $9.99 or so over a $6.99 bomber, but I'll take it. This is classic Sam Adams, fans of spiced winter beer will love this."
"The beer is dark brown with a small tan head. The aroma of spice, sweet, sugary malts, light chocolate. The flavor is ok. A bit cloying and certainly best in small quantities. Not in the same league as the Hardywood Gingerbread Stout we had just prior. Medium bodied with relatively low carbonation. Alcohol presence not as well disguised as it could be. Overall, this was middle of the road."

"M&D&O - a nice thick stout, herbed up quite nicely and balanced with the molasses like sweetness above a fabulous bedrock of malt and rye, a tough combination but tackled very well. usually these gimicky flavored beers end up tasting like crappy beer with fake flavor tacked on. Not so in this beer."
"Overall, I think this is much better than I scored it. I was hoping for more of a gingerbread taste. Kinda like picking one up and ripping the legs off of those little bastards and screaming in victory as the amputated cookie begs for its life...but alas it is not. It's good though. Made me smile, but that may also have been the 9% abv."

"Poured thick and dark brown with a fizzy quickly dissappating brown head. Smelled of gingerbread, appropriate, cinnamon and licorice. The flavor really comes out as this warms as served too cold brings out too much booze. The gingerbread, nutmeg, cinnamon and anise come out on the palate to create a great winter warmer."

"O: One of the better spice beers that I have had. Then again, I haven't had too many. I would drink it again if I could find it. It is the perfect after dinner beer. I don't understand why this beer suffers from low ratings."
"I was very underwhelmed by this beer. Lots of gingerbread spices and whatnot. Cloying sweetness. Looks good. Smells spicy -- ginger and clove. Cinnamon is clearlythere. I don't usually like beers that lack any semblance of hops or malt and this one doesn't have much of either. I don't know what I expected but I wasnot impressed."
"Pours an opaque black body with a good inch of dark tan head. Coffee, nut, and spice jump out of the aroma. Dark chocolate hits the palate first with cinnamon and nutmeg rushing in to support. Rich creamy mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. A rich sweet treat that's an absolute delight for the holidays."
"O: If the ginger were kicked up (dried ginger, candied ginger, throw some root in late boil), throw in some black pepper and up the bitterness I’d call this an all-around winner. A bit of bitter orange wouldn’t hurt either. If you are on the fence about spiced beers, don’t try this one."

"Pours dark with little head. Smells like heavy ginger and cinnamon, not much else going on. Mouthfeel more like a porter with heavy ginger-nutmeg-cinnamon. Flavors hit what they were going for, thought the mouthfeel is on the light side. While I am not a huge fan of spiced beers, this one worked out with the stout base. Tastes like Christmas. Not bad."

"Very dark brown to black in the glass somewhat opaque but it does have faint red highlights when held up to the light. The head is dark khaki and rather thick but it will fall eventually while leaving a good deal of lace. The smell is great for a spiced winter ale. All of the spices included in the brewing process are evident in the aroma. I don't get much in the way of malt or hops in smell however, more on that to follow. Like the smell, all of the spices are noticeable in the taste but, the stout base is mediocre at best. As a result, I have to say that the balance here is lacking. While I do liked spiced ales there tends to be a very fine line between a good one and an unbalanced one and this one is slightly unbalanced. I should note that as it warms it does seem to get better. The body is moderate to just a touch light of moderate with a finish that leaves a bit of the spice but is otherwise clean. Overall, while I like it, I think this could have been a bit better had the stout been more assertive."
"O - I was hoping for more, but didn't mind having this to finish a Thanksgiving dinner. Thi sis a fun beer to share for the holidays."
"O - Overall, this beer fits the season very well and I would definitely have it again."
"Served in a tulip. Pours one shade shy of black with a dense, three inch, mocha-colored head that eventually dissipates into a broken skim and a tight band around the edges. Thick strands of lacing are revealed and exhibit excellent retention. Nose expresses nutmeg and allspice; however, it is quite overpowering. Taste consistent with nose - taste is just like a gingerbread cookie with a suggestion of lactose. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a lively, even carbonation with just a slight prickle and some residual heat attributable to the overabundance of spice. Well, this is a gingerbread cookie punch in the mouth. If that's your thing, you will really enjoy this beer; however, the overly spiced character really takes away from any possible subtleties or nuances."
"Dark mahogany colored with a dark brown frothy foamy head that rises up high and recedes quickly. Rich aroma of sweet malt and gingerbread. Rich flavor of raisin, clove, fig, gingerbread, cinnamon and nutmeg. Sweet lactose notes balanced by sharp bitterness of roasted grain and spice. Rich and full mouthfeel. Decent beer overall."

"Overall: This beer is way too bitter for the style. It really needs some more sweetness to balance things out. I don't need any more."

"This is a nice beer with a decent flavor profile. I like the concept of a gingerbread stout. Unfortunately, my complaint here is this beer fell short of it's mark. I get the ginger but it really lacks in other spices that would bring the gingerbread aspect out. Overall, a nice beer and a beer I wouldn't mind having again, but I just felt it needed a little something extra."
""

"Overall I was pleasantly surprised by this one. I thought the spices were pretty good and it really did smell like gingerbread. If the body was stronger I would have liked it even more. I would still probably drink it again."
""
""
"O: Didn't enjoy once I got past the smell, would not drink again."
"Was hoping for a lot more out of this beer. Black pour with a medium sized tan head. Minimal lacing. Aroma of gingerbread is there, but the flavor tasted like they emptied the spice cabinet a little too much. Overpowering on the cloves and ginger taste. Too much for me. I'll pass on this one."

"Overall: Hard to drink because of the overwhelming spice notes. Tastes like Christmas at Yankee Candles. Make sure you have some water handy. Overall it was an interesting experience but I will not be seeking it out again. At least it had a cool label."
"Great dessert beer!"

"O - I was excited to try this beer. And I'm sure I judged it much higher than my peers. Truth be told, for a 9% beer, it didn't totally live up to it's name. But, it wasn't a disappointment. This beer needs to be served during the holiday season, among other flavorful beers. It's not overly impressive, it's not overly impressionable, but it definitely serves it's purpose."

"Overall- Pretty good stout. Very interesting combination of spices with a stout. Feels and tastes more like an imperial stout than a milk stout."

"SOLID, NOT MUST HAVE!"

"O- This beer is fun, its experimental, its very christmasy but one thing it is not, is tasty. Weird medicinal Nyquill taste, almost made this fucker undrinkable, i really wish the taste mimicked the smell but it doesnt."

"Pours a solid dark brown/black color with a huge fluffy tan head that sticks around forever. The aroma is dominated by ginger with a hint of clove sneaking out. There might be more in there but I can't get past the ginger sauce. The flavor is a little better, but not much. Ginger again is a dominant flavor here with some nutmeg and all spice rounding out the spice palette. There's some caramel, a hint of chocolate, a touch of lactose, and a bit of wet dog in here to make an attempt at some balance. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet spice laden mouthfeel. I did not enjoy this beer, I rank it right up there with cherry wheat. The Ginger is strong enough that instead of thinking gingerbread men I'm thinking Japanese steak house ginger sauce. Great idea, lackluster results."
"Overall a really good new beer from Sam Adams. Love some spice mixed in with a stout body."
"Kind of a miss on this one. While I like the spice profile, it doesn't remind me of a gingerbread cookie and the stout base is weak. For a holiday brew, I would want something a touch more warming. Perhaps use their holiday porter as a base."
"I've decided not to try cellaring this one because the ABV seems under control to my palate from the start. Also, a large proportion of the flavor and nose balance in this brew depends upon spicing elements notorious for falling apart rapidly in the cellar. This beer does not have the spicing levels exaggerated enough in proportion to withstand that sort of degradation, it drinks to my palate as though it was meant to be consumed fresh, despite the label on the bottle specifically mentioning cellaring to develop flavors. I'm happy with it the way it is already, thank you very much."
"O - Great concept, but it didn't materialize too well. Smell is incredible but the taste and mouth feel leave a lot to be desired. Really wanted to like this one, damn."
""
"O- not a bad holiday brew. A bunch going on with all the spices, but still a sweet enjoyable sipper that I would try again"

"This one appears jet black upon pour, thin cocoa colored head with decent retention. The smell is heavy on the cinnamon and ginger. Cloves are present too beneath the cinnamon and ginger. The stout character is hidden beneath the assertive spice profile and doesn't add much in the way of chocolate or roastiness. The taste is again heavy on spice and it does resemble a gingerbread cookie. Milk sugar also makes its presence know as there is a smooth creamy sweetness that pairs nicely with the spices. I get some roasted barley on the finish, but this is largely undermined by the spice profile. Mouthfeel is a tad prickly with a medium to heavy body. Overall, pretty nice brew from Sam Adams. I was attracted by the novelty of this brew, and I must say it delivers plenty of gingerbread character. My only issue is the forwardness if the spices, they seem to be a bit over the top."

"This type of beer has a low ceiling so I'll give Sam Adams props for this one. Actually at times tastes like a gingerbread cookie. It was interesting although I probably won't have it again. May be something good with more body."
"O - I am glad I gave this beer a try, and it wasn't overly expensive, but I won't be revisiting it anytime soon."
"Overall: This beer is a an imperial pumpkin that meets a imperial stout. It has a lot going for it but because of how unique it is why I am rating it ""high"". I am not knocking this brew at all, I would grab it again but I wouldn't search for it like the holy grail. Grab a glass and pour and try it yourself....Salud!"

"O- this a my first Sam Adams in about 5-6yrs? I wish their regular releases would mimic these special small batches. Very nice job even though I believe somebody else has already done this and succeeded. Kudos"
"O: The ginger is a bit too strong in the taste, while the base stout is too thin to stand up to the spices. Tastes pretty good, but could have been better."

"The beer pours a very dark brown to black color with a tan head. The aroma has a lot of cinnamon and nutmeg notes, as well as some roasted malt. The flavor is very similar. The ginger and strong cinnamon notes really come through strongly. They are joined by some chocolate and roasted malt character that melds well with the spices. Medium to thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice, spicy stout."
"Oh, yeah, like I could pass up a gingerbread stout... This one pours a deep black-brown, highlighted in mahogany, topped by two fingers of tan foam. The nose comprises light roasted malts and toasted gingerbread. Straightforward, but decidedly alluring. The taste generally brings in more of the same, along with some cocoa, but everything's toned down, pale in comparison to what my nostrils lapped up so willingly. This was a real downer, lemme tell ya. The body is a a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth, lightly grainy feel. Overall, a pretty tasty little stout, though one that comes across slightly muted on the tongue, a true disappointment for me. I still enjoyed it thoroughly, but I believe I could have seriously relished this stuff had things gone differently."
"22 ounce bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head. Head retention is good, and there's a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, it smells like gingerbread, cinnamon, nutmeg, roasted malt and chocolate. The taste is pretty much just like the aroma, it's mostly sweet and spicy. There's also the addition of some molasses and cloves to the taste. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy and a bit smooth with moderate carbonation. I think it's a solid overall brew, I might have to buy another bottle. Not too bad for $7.99."
"It's a goodbeer, glad I got to try it... Not sure if I will revisit this? I might pick up another bottle just to give it another go but.... It just doesn't deliver for me... at least not this bottle..."
