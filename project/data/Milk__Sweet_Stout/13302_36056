Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, vanilla, and cocoa aromas. Taste is much the same with char and slight cocoa flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of roast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is drinkable but the flavors in this one are quite char forward to me.","UCLABrewN84","Jul 09, 2014"

I smell cocoa powder and vanilla, both subtle but there behind dense chocolate malt, bitter barley, and a touch of char. the taste is much less aggressive and angry than the nose, with the lactose sugar really bringing this together beautifully, especially in the finish, which is soft and rich, desserty without being diabetic. huge body but an unbelievably delicate feel, creamy and velvety on my palate, and finishing clean and satisfying. scary drinkable for what it is, and to me a beautiful example of a style that is often tried, and infrequently executed well. this is really a lot better than its scores indicate here, one of new yorks hidden treasures.","StonedTrippin","Aug 05, 2013"

It has a slight bready smell with a little booze in the nose as well. I get a lot of spur which makes me wonder if this batch was a little off. I was expecting more malty taste. It has a decent body and decent carbonation.

3.65,2.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Moo Thunder Stout pours a solid black, with about two fingers of light caramel foam crowning the beer. There's decent head retention on display, as well as some lightly sticky lacing. The nose is nice, smells of light, sweet coffee, with a slightly heavy roast edge to it. The flavor profile retains that coffee note, but leans a little bit heavier on the roast. The result is that the taste comes across as a little too dry and roasty at times. The body is solidy full, especially for a low ABV beer. It could stand to be a little more creamy though, and is paired with a slightly overactive carbonation. Moo Thunder is a passable Sweet Stout, and definitely makes a better impression than the American Pale Ale I just had before from Butternuts.","axeman9182","Jun 06, 2012"

Mild chocolate tones sweeten up the toasted barley backbone and the smooth, malty presence. Flavors are light and mild, on a slick, thin body. Smokey roasted coffee and dark chocolate throughout, with a light malt sweetness that balances everything out nicely. The aftertaste is more on the coffee side, with some roast and bitter qualities.

First sip is heavily roasted and charred, faint thoughts of dark cocoa powder, lactose is very subdued, lacks the sweetness expected from a milk stout. Towards the end of the can, the char is the dominant note and obliterates the palate. Medium bodied, watery at times, lacks creamynes from style, long lingering char notes.

The taste is akin to the nose; dark heavily French or Italian roasted beans with some dark chocolate nibs thrown in for good measure. Very malty and milk like in flavor, its an oddity that the mouthfeel is surprisingly quite lithe. Thin in the mouth with little body, the mouthfeel is totally out of synchronous with the rest of the factors; this is unusual statistically speaking. One would expect some additional creaminess and weight in a brew as well endowed as this and I must say it was obvious when I poured it from the can that this would be the case.

It never becomes cloying. It tastes roasty-- more like coffee than chocolate; not dark roast coffee. A note of caramel is detected. There's no bitterness, really. This is a simple and easy to drink beer. It's definitely the best I've had from Butternuts.","yesyouam","Jun 27, 2010"

Flavor is like a cold mocha with coffee and unsweetened chocolate tones and just a hint of molasses.

The flavor resembles the aroma closely, especially up front, but then the taste just kinda drops off. Some bitterness sneaks back. As it warms, some fruitiness comes in to add a little something, but it's still not quite enough to make this something I'd reach for again. Not horrible, but not so exciting.

Only problem was that it seemed very watered down. Both the flavor and the body were extremely thin. Not what I expected or hoped for.

The ABV is presumably rather low (I haven't been able to find it, though I haven't searched too deep yet), and drinkability seems hellishly easy. Goes down extremely smooth. This could make for a reasonable session candidate.","Proteus93","Dec 15, 2008"

Pours your standard stout black with a brown foaming head. Smells of dark chocolate but not much else. Tastes great: yes on the dark chocolate, expresso, charred steak. Thick mouthfeel but not as dense as some in its class, which I suppose makes it more drinkable than most in its class. I'll buy another pack and bring it out with friends.","droomyster","Nov 21, 2008"

The head of foam was only a small skim of tan colored foam that quickly dissipated into a handful of tan rings along the edge. It didn't bother to leave any lace behind. The aroma was coffee based with roasted coffee beans, fresh cut grass, a hint of milk chocolate, and a splash of lactose at the finish. The taste was lightly dry with roasted coffee beans, roasted malts, milk chocolate, a tiny touch of grass, and then it finished up with a hint of grassy hops and lactose. The mouthfeel was light to medium bodied with a dry aftertaste of roasted malts, bitter roasted coffee beans, and lactose. In the end, it was a nice little session roasted milk stout. Since it has plenty of flavor and the fact that it comes in a can, that helps the drinkability out a bit.","AltBock","Jun 04, 2008"

Good sharpness to the aroma, which contains more than sweet malt notes -- there are also elements of roasted malt, hazelnuts, and crystallized sugar. On the palate, sweeter than expected, albeit with a definite hop kick up front. After that, things smooth out to a creamy sweetness later tinged with roasted barley.

Taste is a similar combination of roasted malt mixed with coffee and chocolate and an underlying milky sweetness. Feel is slightly thin, but still rather creamy with a decent level of carbonation for the style. Somewhat watery overall. Drinkability on this is good. The combination of flavors, while not stand-outish, still provides a nice, easy-to-drink stout.

3.33,-6.7,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"The beer pours a black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a light roasted malt scent along with a weak crystal malt aroma. The aroma is weak with little character. The taste is average. It has a smooth black and roasted malt flavor. It seems weak and watery with quite a dry finish. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a weak session stout. It's got roasted malt character, but nothing else. It needs some more substance. Overall, a pretty average stout.","WesWes","Oct 18, 2007"
3.8,6.4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"For the style this works out pretty well. Milk stout isn't my favorite style as I tend to prefer my stouts heavy duty when I crave one... but I could see this making its way into my rotation. If milk stouts are your thing, try this on for size. See if it fits.","ommegangpbr","Oct 07, 2007"
