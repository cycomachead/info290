3.81,0.3,4,3.5,4,3.75,3.75,"Overall, this was enjoyed as a group with the groomsmen-to-be from our wedding party. After enjoying a curiously calming and leisurely 2:00 AM stroll around Spanish Harlem, we found ourselves in the possession of a six pack of this guy, and although not all of the gentlemen present traditionally enjoy “dark” beers, we each were able to enjoy this one. Our guess is that it was due to the cloying, syrupy sugariness of the flavoring, but with just enough balance from the metallics, roastiness, and lactic bitterness to keep any one thing from being too offensive. The nose smelled on the sweet side, but it’s main constitution was otherwise reminiscent of a silky American porter. While most of you won’t find yourself on the far north side of Manhattan in the middle of the night, this beer served wonderfully as a nightcap, persuading even the toughest of customers.","TheBrewo","Jun 25, 2014"

3.93,3.4,3.75,3.75,4,4,4," The flavor has a nice sweet malt flavor with subtle caramel accent and light roasted taste of barley with some gentle cocoa-like elements. The sweetness in the taste is not overdone and there is a mild bitterness to keep it balanced with some light alcohol and dry taste toward the finish. This is a beer I have wanted to try and I enjoyed it - it is a good representative of the style and was very drinkable without being too sweet.","Slatetank","Aug 06, 2013"

3.82,0.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"The pour crests at about a finger’s worth of rich dark foam, subsides swiftly down to a consistent surface coating then finally pulls away to the glass sides, the lacing is wispy and without stickiness. The liquid is a super-clean opaque black, hints of brown to yellow at the glass bottom and rims, no visible bubbles. The nose consists mostly of roasted cocoa, sweet baked bread, anise, caramel and cola bean, trace of plum, actually comes off angular and dry so that any milkiness seems lost in the shuffle, not overly roasted but lifts well. Medium-bodied while on the firm and muscular side, not softly textured. The carbonation is light, however, it does last fully through each sip. Again, not that milky per se more crisper cocoa, mocha to coffee notes along with cola, orange peel, molasses crisp and pine. Given the higher level of roast, harder to discern clearly the hoppy bite but one suspects it is higher than usual for the category. Mix of black fruits sweeten the mid-palate. Overall, falls on the dry side so there’s no real naturally sweet length. Fairly sessionable and neutral enough to be versatile at the dinner table. Probably would benefit from slightly more sweetness and general liveliness.","farrago","Dec 07, 2012"

The flavor and feel, however, is a drier with less cocoa. There are hints of mocha and brown barley. The body is medium, a normal thickness, and that sort of sums up the beer. It's a normal milk stout. It's clean, and hits the right notes for an American milk stout (I find the British ones to be sweeter).

Malted flavor like a milkshake. very nice dessert beer. beer is thinner than i would have expected, or liked, but the flavor is there and the taste is long lasting. cocoa powder really lasts in the flavor profile. this would go fantastic with vanilla ice cream. not the most complex but the flavors are well developed. if it had a richer mouthfeel this beer would be top notch.","jtell","Jul 09, 2011"

Reminds me of something in between a guinness draught and extra stout...not quite as roasty and flavorful as the extra, but has the smooth creaminess and light flavor of the draught. I must admit I am on the fence with this one...rarely does a whole 12 oz beer disappear from my glass before I finish my review, yet I feel like I want a bit more boldness and flavor out of this one.

The taste begins with a robust roasted, smoky, toffee flavor, which dissolved to coffee mid-palate and then finished on a sweeter than expected note. Very nice flavor progression.

The sweetness countered the bitterness perfectly and left a warm bittersweet chocolatey aftertase. I loves it. It was way too thin for a stout though which distracted from the flavor.

I'm not getting too much sweetness in the nose unfortunately, but what's there is some cocoa powder and brown sugar. Taste is much of the same. Smoked grains, chocolate malts, and roasted malts up front. Midway a carboard flavor emerges with touch of molasses and lactose. Aftertaste is fairly dry with some woody flavors and faint coffee grinds. Light body with a sharp carbonation and a lively feel in the mouth.

The mouthfeel was a little bit thinner than what I was expecting, but very good overall. The beer was pretty drinkable and it was an excellent stout. I would highly recommend it.

A little bit fizzy, but very drinkable -- assuming this new local beerbar keeps it coming in from upriver, I think I've found a new smooth stout to supplant Guinness as a go-to [not that this is "better" than Guinness... or is it?].

This said, the phrase "Full bodied stout" leaves me wondering what i feel missing from this beer, and I realize that the bitter roast flavor (which is great in moderation) is really getting in the way of my enjoyment of this "full" beer.
