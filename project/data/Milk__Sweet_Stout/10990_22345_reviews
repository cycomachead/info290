"Looks like a stout, smells like a minnow bucket, tastes like minnow bucket water.  Ok the last part is a stretch, but truthfully this is a pretty weak offering as a milk stout.  Very little sweetness, cream, cocoa, or coffee.  Very thin feel and no alcohol to boot.  Another disappointment from Lazy Magnolia."

"Black in color and impenetrable to light.  A fingernail of khaki head covers the rim of the glass and about 1/3 of the top.  Aroma is faint but I get starchy sweet potato and lactose.  The flavor is lactose and the sweet potato almost gives it a smoky note.  The mouth is crisp and silky."

"A roasted milky stout, gladly not overly sweet and with predominant coffee and cocoa notes."

"Lazy Magnolia's description included this: ""The sweet potatoes provide the background to an impressive taste with added notes of roasted chocolate, coffee and caramel flavors."" I detected no chocolate or coffee in this. It tastes like an amber lager."

"This was surprisingly smooth. It was very easy to drink and had a lighter body than some of the other milk stouts on the market. As it sits, the taste changes from heavier chocolate tone to a lighter one; and the sweet potato undertone makes its appearance. Would definitely buy this one again!"
""
""
"Overall, this beer is an enjoyable stout with some areas for improvement in the appearance and aromas."
""

"I found this to be a very good tasting and decently original take on a stout."
""
""
"Though the beer has a few inconsistent ""hiccups"" along the way, its overall character is charming, raw and creative. Isn't that what you want out of a Southern gem?"
""
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is jet black, and pours very smoothly, with only a halo of light tan head on the surface. Looks heavy. Aromas of cream, chocolate, coffee, and earthy notes, all leaning towards the rich and sweet side. Flavors are bittersweet forward, with hints of smoke, all on a richly sweet backbone. Notes of sweet potato, baker's chocolate, cream, and coffee all blend together to provide a balanced palate. Light bodied, with a slightly sharp undertone throughout. The aftertaste is more on the bitter and roasted side, with a bittersweet linger into the smooth, clean finish. Interesting brew, and an easy drinker. Tasty, and very unique."

"Overall: This is by no means great, but I'd certainly drink it again. I am beginning to like Lazy Magnolia more and more and this is another solid offering for a sessionable milk stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a solid attempt, and different than any other milk stout I've had. Successful when it comes to infusing that sweet potato characteristic without overpowering. But the feel of this one impacts negatively in a way that influences the smell and taste."

"Overall: This beer is just ok. The vegetable added to a stout may just not be my style. Recommended for outdoor barbecues or get togethers."
""
"Overall: This was an OK brew, not my favorite."
""
"Overall - The beer is worth trying simply due to the novelty of a sweet potato stout. The beer smells fantastic but the taste/flavor was lacking. The brown head of the beer makes it look like it's going to pack some flavor (think Old Rasputin) but it simply doesn't."

"This is easily the blackest pour I've seen with regards to the low ABV. Jeff Stout pours out pitch black with two fingers of dense head. The aroma is sweet, roasty, and ever so slightly earthy. The taste is pretty standard, sadly, there are not yams everywhere. They might attribute a slight bit of earthiness that could also be attributed to hops. There's a bit of stale coffee in the middle to go with some sweet and roasted malts. The mouthfeel is light and creamy, and the drinkability is solid. Overall, Jeff Stout is a pretty decent sweet stout. Not my favorite, but tasty enough. Should appeal to Guinness drinkers."
""
"A little more complex than city slickers would ever want to admit comes out of the South. A little chocolate, coffee, lactose, sweet potato. . . even the potato I suspect has an oatmeal like lending of smoothness to the beer. Gotta like the low abv that makes this an even moreso effortless beer to drink."

"Maybe mid bodied, just a tad thin. The flavors just don't linger too long. I could see myself drinking a whole bunch of this easily. The quintessential session sweet stout. Would have it probably only for this purpose however."
"Good atmosphere. Dark hue, nice (albeit fleeting) head, but no lacing. Nose and flavor are characteristic of the style....roasted coffee bean, and dark unsweetened chocolate. Sweet pungent tone from the sweet potatoes and a thick syrupy character. Overall, this is a good quaff."
"Overall - not a bad beer, worth a shot for sure"

"Served from growler into a sampler shaker. Poured a massively dark brown with a half finger light tan head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, lactose, roasted malt, earth, and earth hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, cream, roasted malt, dark chocolate, and earth. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall was a pretty decent brew. This one had a pretty good nose going on with it with a nice touch of lactose that you would expect and a nice roastiness as well. The flavor however was much more roasty than I prefer for my Milk Stouts. The sweet malt and cream aspect couldn’t shake a stick at all the earth, dark chocolate, and roastiness. Worth trying to say that you have, but I wouldn’t put it high on my list of the style."
"O: Not a bad beer, but wildly uneven. Drinkable, but there are better examples of the style out there."
"Great to finally see this in the upstate. I've had it on tap a time or two and have been looking forward to the bottled version. I'm glad Lazy Magnolia was able to finally make this available in an accessible format and anticipate packs on their own."
"The beer appears opaque black with a very thin tan head. The aroma is mostly of roasted malt and chocolate. I also did not pick up the sweet potatoes in the aroma or flavor, but they did contribute to the mouthfeel. The flavor is on the milder side of sweet with some nice malt backbone. I detected the chocolate notes. The mouthfeel is creamy for this medium bodied, moderately carbonated beer. This was enjoyable to drink and it's a solid beer from the guys at Lazy Magnolia."

"appears an opaque black, with light tan colored head. decent head retention and lacing. Smell is a sweet sugary aroma, with just a touch of roastiness. Very similar flavors in the taste, with a hint of bitter cocoa. Balanced though, not overly sweet or dry. medium thickness, creamy body."

"Pours a beautiful sable with a fairly thick light tan head. Aroma has notes of roast coffee and molasses as well as burnt malt. Flavor has coffee, licorice and chocolate tones with a hint of smoky wood. Full-bodied texture has some good fizz. Didn’t get any sweet potato or milk notes, but it is still a tasty and enjoyable stout."
""

"Mouthfeel is leans just a little towards the heavier side with moderate carbonation. Overall it was pretty tasty and surprisingly drinkable for the big malty sweetness. The sweetness doesn't really seem out of place for the style either. I liked the candied sweet potato aspect of it. At under 5% abv I wasn't expecting a big bold stout, and I didn't get one. I did think though that it was a pretty good drinking, nicely flavored, interesting beer for the low abv."
"O: Another (with pecan beer) mildly disappointing offering from this brewer, but better than the pecan ale and certainly a decent brew."
"O- A really interesting and drinkable stout. Big rich sweet flavors, but the roasted coffee notes help cut the sweetness from being cloying. There were some big metallic notes at first, but they went away as it warmed up."

"Served in a tulip nonic. Pours an inky black with a creamy, two inch, tan-colored head embedded with tiny pinpricks. Head eventually settles into a solid 1/8th inch skim. Thick, textured bands of lacing are revealed during the session. Nose reveals espresso roast, lactose and peanut butter (?). There is also a suggestion of cocoa and something metallic. Taste expresses char and cocoa. The metallic quality in the nose is also present in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an even carbonation and a light acidity. I don't see a lot of milk stouts being produced, so I'm grateful for the opportunity to try them when they present. That said, I found this one decent, but somewhat lacking in the traditional lactose sweetness I've come to associate with the style. That, as well as the metallic notes, detract from this beer."

"(Overall) Good smooth stout with lots of flavor but avoids a complicated palate. Highly accessible. 3.5"

"The comments from others are spot on, for me. Clean, simple, and perhaps lacking in presence. Sometimes, when I grab a stout I do want a deeper flavor profile. On the other hand, there are times that this one would be just right. The ABV% is good enough to get that relaxed feeling.plus absolutely no hint of the taste of alcohol. The texture sets a good background for eating cuisine that already has bold flavors, such as that local nola eatery. And, my memory is that there is a nice finish to this beer. A safe and secure beer that has its place. Having said that, I do wish that they would experiment to let one note stand out, while still maintaining a good balance. Nothing provocative but something slightly more distinguished would be in order. If this is a beer in progress I sure hope that it makes its way to Kentucky in bottles or tap. I would definitely keep it in stock."
"A very gentle stout, even for a milk stout. Pours pitch black with a slight head. Smells very lightly roasty, a touch watery, and milky. Very soft in the mouth, with flavors that are very soft, lightly milky and roasty in parts, and with a slightly metalic finish. Not bad, but a bit simple and light."
"Overall: A pedestrian brew, lacking presence. It left my hankering for something better, so I opted for a Bell's Kalamazoo for the next round."

""
"Overall: A very smooth stout. Wish it came in bottles. I see why this is one of LM's most popular offerings."
"Back to the beer, midnight black with a layer of lingering cream head, no lacing and mild legs. Aroma was hard to catch in that restaurant - light chocolates & toffee, brown sugar, sweet potato. Everything is toned way down, as the tongue follows the nose with a moderately heavy body to it."
"Nice, sipper. Earthy sweet potato notes take some adjusting and feel out of place. Overall, a nice sipper."
"A quick bite up front from something like dark chocolate. It smooths out quickly with some caramel, but mostly molasses, maybe some toffee. Lactose spreads out the flavors and adds more silkiness, but still has some pull. Coffee on the end. Lingering sweetness"
"Overall, this was a solid offering from Lazy Magnolia. I would likely try it again to pick up on more of its subtleties."
"Very simple, but all around enjoyable. Something I would recommend."
"Highly recommended."
"Overall a different type of stout. This growler will not last long."
"Overall: This is right up there with the best of LM beers. It is perfect on a hot southern afternoon. This has a nice combo of the biting coffee and super sweet sugar. I could have several of these. A unique beer that may be my new favorite in the style."
"Notes: A decent beer. Worth a try, but don't expect alot. Little complexity and light on taste and body, but not bad. I am still proud of our MS brewery."
"D-not drinkable whatsoever. only my respect for beer kept me from spilling this down the drain."
"I don't know if it's because I'm used to drinking big beers, the southern style they have or if its the terrible beer laws they are forced to abide by here but most every beer has been fairly lackluster and disappointing."
"Great drinking beer! Served with a thick, creamy, fine tan head and some lace. Color was an opaque brown black. Aroma was chocolate, a bit of coffee, roasted malts. Flavor was like aroma plus nut meats and a great bitter to sweet balance. Body and carbonation were appropriate to style and good. Finish was like flavor and medium in length. Session beer."
"Medium bodied with a light effervescence. Overall, a middle-of-the-road kind of brew. Given the other reviews, I hope that this one might just have been off a bit. I will look for others from this brewer in hopes they are better."
"The drinkability of this beer is excellant for a stout. The low ABV coupled with the sweetish coffee taste is a great combination. This is, by far, my favorite offering from Lazy Magnolia and one of my all-time favorite stouts."
"This is a wonderful beer by Lazy Magnolia. This needs to be bottled and sold along with their other flagship offerings. A good concept and great execution by Lazy Mag."
"Medium bodied with a nice creamy mouthfeel. Light and refreshing, this a very drinkable stout that has always left me wanting more. My favorite offering from LM so far and one that I've been coming back to a lot lately."
"D - The drinkability of this Stout is up for debate, the body I am not particular fond of in my Stouts, but the ABV level makes it very drinkable and something that I could have a couple of before filling up"
"D: Low ABV with a good flavor and aroma makes an easy drinking beer. Insanely easy to put down and a joy to drink. You can actually trick yourself into believing there is no way that this a small beer because it does have such nice and big flavors and aromas. If you ask me, this should be bottled. I think it would be a great seller for Lazy Mag and it is very accessible for noobs IMO. I won't belittle it by calling it a gateway stout, its just a great beer. This beer is an example that you don't need a stupid high ABV to have a great beer with good flavor."
"D - This is a very easy drinking stout. It's relative light body make it very drinkable and one could have a ton of these in a drinking session."
"Drinkability is very high. I would guess the abv around 5.5-6.0% abv. There is a bit more kick in this beer than most from Lazy Mag. It's tasty and I'll definately come back for more!"
"For a ABV of 3.5%, it has quite a kick to it. Compared to other stouts it has alot less prominent after taste. It has full roasty aromas of coffee, malt, a hint of coffee , chocolate, and the signature sweet potato. I would definitely recommend drinkers to visit Kiln, Mississippi and try all of their beers. I hear they have a habanero beer. I love Lazy Mag!"
"On tap. Pours a very dark brown with a beige head. Faint aromas of dark roasted malt, toffee, and chocolate, with an overall sweet character. Taste is quite sweet as well, again with chocolate, coffee, and cream. Quite earthy in the background. Very nice, thick feel. Lots of character and body for such a light ABV. Very good."
"This is an extremely drinkable stout and one of the better sessionable stouts I've had in a while. I'm glad I had the opportunity to pick this up, and it is, without a doubt, the best beer I've had from my home state of Mississippi."
"D: This stout has a pretty low ABV and is nice a flavorful. That equates to many, many Jefferson Stouts in a session. Excellent brew from an excellent brewer. The party pig is woorth the money to have JS available when the urge arises."
"Many thanks to the J Clyde for having this on cask last night. I had three and all were great. This is a great, light feeling stout. Poured an opaque brown-black. Head seemed to dissipate after the shock of hitting the glass. Being brewed with sweet potatoes added a different feel. Coffe and chocolate lay down but are present. This is a very smoothe drinking stout. It's a crying shame this is a seasonal as it would be a great summer-time sipping stout as one of me fellow Free the Hops member stated. Great Beer!"
"It arrived with just a few wisps of head that swirled and went away. The mouthfeel was medium with a very sweet taste in the mouth. The color was an extremely dark brown, sort of a cola color, but with ruby highlights. It did not allow a lot of light to penetrate, but there appeared to be good clarity. The finish had a lingering sweetness. This was definitely a sweet stout. I have to admit that I was intrigued by this one. Mississippi's brewery, indeed."
"I've had all but one of the Lazy Magnolia brews and this is probably my favorite of the bunch. Poured a beautiful black color with white creamy head that hung around until the end. Made with sweet potatoes and a bit of milk lactose. I can't say that I taste either one, but this is one smooth stout. Kind of a thin mouthfeel for a stout, but excellent. Try it."
"This beer pours very dark- almost black which scares away anyone who doesn't like dark beer, but they are truly missing out because this is a very smooth stout. It smells of coffee and definitely has a nice coffe flavor with hints of caramel and dark chocolate. This is an excellent after dinner drink. Many restaurants/bars will serve it too cold. Let it sit so the many flavors have a chance to come out. It is a seasonal, so be sure to try it if you see it."
"This is a solid stout overall. Simple and flavourful and certainly easy drinking. A nice introduction to the Lazy Magnolia family for sure that makes me eager to eventually sample some more of their brews."
"Notes: Lazy Magnolia is one of my favorite local breweries down in the south. Always making excellent beers and excelling at what they do. This brewery is going places."
"The Wife, who is normally only marginally stout prone went absolutely nuts for this one. She drank half of mine and ordered two more for herself afterwards. I think this is a testament to its smoothness and balance."
"It will definately be a plus when and if the brewery starts to offer their brews in the bottle."
"This poured dark with a thin head that dissipated rapidly. It smelled light, sweet and malty. The taste was sweet and malty. The sweet potatoes used in this beer are noticeable in the aftertaste and quite interesting. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. I would consider this a highly drinkable brew."
