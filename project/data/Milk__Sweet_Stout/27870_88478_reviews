"Delicious! Like chocolate milk blended into a milk stout. Not overly sweet though the cocoa and roasted barley add a bittering dryness to compliment this beers drinkability."

"Delicious beer, with balance and consistency"

"Was looking forward to trying this beer. Tried it from the can, sweet creamy taste with loads of chocolate."

"EBF sample pour. Pours dark brown. Smell is goddamn chocolate milk. Nails it's intended purpose. Milk chocolate with some coffee and cream. Flavor is the same. A glass of chocolate milk with a strong of chocolate syrup. Some softer coffee flavors. Coffee with a lot of cream. Lactose. Body is light but the feel is creamy. Executed very well here. 4 Hands has quickly become a brewery that caught my attention. Good job again."

"Very enjoyable milk stout. Cannot remember a chocolate beer that tasted so much like chocolate."
""
""
""
"O.  Not a bad beer.  Flavor is kind of one dimensional but they got what they were aiming for so I can't flaw that.  But its just a little light for a stout for me."

"Nice chocolate flavors for such a low abv."

"O - great beer for the chocolate lover. I may buy this from time to time."

"O: good but not great chocolate milk stout, cola taste dominates more than the chocolate, little bit thin and too carbonated"
"From a 12 oz can: Pours very dark brown with a good head.  The aroma is sweet with notes of chocolate, as one would expect, though not particularly strong. Upon sipping, a delicious smokiness surprised me because I did not detect it in the aroma. A rich chocolaty flavor with a sweet finish. Feels very light and smooth for such a dark beer. Not creamy as might be inferred from the name. Overall, nice and refreshing, like a glass of chocolate milk. Easily sessionable, and very enjoyable."

"Pours deep black in color with little head. Smells of chocolate and tastes of it as well. Not my favorite chocolate stout but very drinkable."
""

""

"Best chocolate stout I've had... Very drinkable."
""
""
"Overall - This is a pretty alright brew. After a couple straight reviews where I kind of thrashed some 4 Hands products, I have found one I like. Condor recommended and approved, especially for the cold dark winter nights ahead."

"Taste: Exquisitely smooth. The lactose infusion makes this one sooo easy to drink and mellow. Chocolate flavors all the way here, with some roastiness rounding out the flavor profile. Absolutely delicious, so much so that we grabbed growlers to bring some more home (as bottles were all sold out during our visit). Very impressed!"

"The good is taste taste and taste. One of the best tasting chocolate stouts that I've had. It's drinkable and the flavor doesn't become overbearing or to sweet.. Now for the other side it's very thin and carbonated almost like a chocolate cola mouthfeel is the equivalent of water. With that all said I'm glad I tried it and will drink it again. 4 hands is legit I enjoy their resurrected ipa cash money imperial Ipa they are starting to become an exciting brewery and if they ever decide to turn this into  a double chocolate milk stout I think it will be a game changer.."

"Plenty of sweet chocolate to be found here,  and very easy to drink. Definitely worth a try"

"Well, we've gotta do something now that we've left the new Bigby's, so why not crack open a chocolate milk stout that VDubb tells me is quite tasty?  It pours a straight black-brown topped by a finger of khaki foam.  The nose confirms the name, comprising cocoa powder, mild roasted malts, and a touch of sweet coffee for the ever-loving sake of it.  The taste brings in more of the same, the milk chocolate character shining in all its cocoa-y glory.  The body is a lithe-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel.  Overall, a rather tasty stout, one I'll likely purchase several times in the near future.  Get some."

"Cool label! That's about the highlight of this beer for me. Frankly, I don't even taste chocolate ... I taste and smell burnt espresso beans. Also kind of watery. I expect a stout to feel/taste thick and rich ... this one seems thin and weak. There is so much potential for a beer like this but it seems this brewery (and many others like it) are just trying to ride the profit wave with uninspiring products. Too bad. I suppose there's a chance it somehow became skunked? Bottled on 3/25/14."

"Pours brown with some clarity, tan head with decent retention. The nose features heavy milk chocolate and roast. Smells like a decadent candy bar, kind of reminds me of southern tier's choklat. Taste is not as flavorful and full of chocolate as the nose promises. Plenty of roast present, mild bitterness, dry finish. Mouthfeel is thin with moderate carbonation. Overall, the nose is great, the flavor isn't bad, just falls short of what I was hoping for based on the aroma."
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: Good beer and well balanced for sure. A little light on the palate maybe, but drinks easily. The nose was perhaps somewhat more impressive than the taste was, but this is still a solid sweet stout and well worth checking out if you get the chance. Thanks again for the box totoropanda."

"Very smooth as a milk stout, with a mild chocolate flavor; I tasted a very slight coffee undercurrent, which many like in a stout, but me, not so much. Not real strong, but enough to knock my rating down a half step. As reference, my favorite of the """chocolate""" stouts is definitely Samuel Smith's Organic Chocolate."

"Black in color with no light penetrating this brew. A fingernail of khaki colored head rests on top. Brussels lacing. I smell lactose,chocolate, and dark malt. The flavor is bitter dark malt in the front of the palate. There's a restrained amount of chocolate and lactose present. The mouth is smooth and creamy."

"Overall, this is a solid sweet stout, and one of my favorites for the style. Can't wait to try it at the brewery next week."

"Overall: Wish that this beer tasted like it smells. Its a good milk stout, but a better flavor profile and a thicker mouthfeel will make this beer very desirable and make it a beer at the top of its style."

"Overall not bad, lots of great chocolate and cookie dough, nice cocoa and lactose milk chocolate, even a hint of roasted malt too, pretty tasty and enjoyable. Thanks Matt!"

"Overall, a really good chocolate stout, enough chocolate to know it is there, nice roasted malt character, as others have noted, the carbonation takes it down a notch."

"Great creamy chocolate flavor and aroma"

"O - Overall this is a tasty chocolate stout. Not too subtle at all this is a great balance of malts and chocolate. With the mouthfeel was not as sharp as it was more of a hindrance than anything."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- An enjoyable stout. Good chocolate flavor that is not overly sweet. I would buy this again in a pinch."
""
"Overall, I feel that this is a very good, very smooth stout, that would make an absolutely fantastic dessert beer. I would like to have a bit more roasted grain / coffee taste to compliment the chocolate and lactose, but still a very good beer overall. It would be hard for me to characterize this as a """stout""" since it doesn't really have any of the flavors I normally associate with a stout, but 4 Hands Brewing is definitely on my """brewers to watch""" list."
""
"O- a good representation of the style with copious amounts of chocolate. It could stand to have a smoother mouthfeel but tasty none the less."
""
"Overall, this is one of the better chocolate stouts out there. Goose Island's Big John is the only other chocolate stout that is comparable to this one."
""
""
""
""
"As I said... I had high hopes for this one. They were not met. It's not a BAD beer, it's just not a particularly good one."

"***Has a nice body for the low ABV, creamy, but clean. Nice chocolate flavors, not too sweet, with a nice balance. Quite enjoyable."
"7.8/10"
"Nothing impressive about this one. As I said above, it's not terrible. But I'm not loving it."
""
""
""
"O: Eh, I wanted to like this beer. But in the end it taste like a brown ale with cacao nibs added. I wouldn't recommend this, especially four the price."
"Thanks to Mark & Kathy for this one!"

"O -This is a really delicious beer. I can't say enough about how much every 4 Hands beer impressed me. Keep 'em coming."

"Overall. Very good brew IMO. There is a nice Milk Stout backbone to this brew. Dark malt sweetness and richness with some coffee comes in. Then the nice coca nib notes are present. Very well crafted and balanced yet extremely flavorful. (4.0)"
