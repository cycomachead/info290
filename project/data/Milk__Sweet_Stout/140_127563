This beer completely hid the 7.6% ABV and was outstanding, I did not want it to end. If Sierra Nevada or Ninkasi want to produce this beer again then I would seek it out and buy as much as possible, it was that good.

The color walks a fine line between deep dark brown and flat black...  In either case a bit of light leaks in around the edges of the glass...  Still with no discernible carbonation...  A good bit of lacing clings to the sides of the glass...  The nose is dominated by dark roast gourmet coffee as it should be...  Next in line are whiffs of vanilla...  There are also some light roasted malt notes as well...  The flavors that materialize on the palate are a mirror image of the aromas described above...  There is a slight addition of black licorice on the deep finish...  Very pleasing...  On the lighter side of full bodied...  Chewy and viscous...  A light carbonated bite...  A rock star Milk Stout...  Packs a bit of a punch, but that's not necessarily a bad thing...

I wish I had opened it earlier to try and get more coffee because I just had a FBS and having a hard time picking a favorite. Fresh FBS definitely has more coffee, but I think Double Latte is thicker...oh well, they are both great so I'm a happy person!","tigerbeer90","Oct 16, 2014"

4.28,3.1,4.25,4.25,4.5,3.5,4.25,"Overall, this is one bold beer.  The aroma hits you like a ton of bricks, and the flavoring doesn’t disappoint.  While the feel is in keeping with the style, albeit a little light, it doesn’t do the strength of flavoring enough justice.  You get this intense, chocolatey, coffeed, malty roast akin to your big Russian imperials, for example, but this little dinky feel to carry it.  The flavoring is so present, however, that you don’t really spend that much timing worrying about it beyond a simple critique.  This is the best beer of the bunch thus far, with a fantastic representation of both beer and coffee, as was intended.","TheBrewo","Oct 09, 2014"

The foam cap blends beautifully with the beer below as you drink, softening the coffee and chocolate flavors with just the right amount of lactose added to keep it interesting.  A hint of fruit appears mid-palate and then the beverage glides to a drying, slightly espresso astringent finish with a touch of tartness and lingering coffee bitterness. This is a very creamy big bodied beer supported with a very fine soft carbonation that is as close as a beer will ever come to a double latte.","pat61","Sep 29, 2014"

Nice aroma of chocolate, coffee, sweet dark toasted malt, hints of lactose. Flavor follows aroma with nicely melded dark toasted malt, lactose, chocolate, vanilla and light quality coffee. Finishes with toasty malt and a hint of grassy hops. Excellent creamy mouth feel, quite nice. I saved this favorite of the pack for the last and it is a worthy way to see the finish of a very ambitious 12 pack that I enjoyed a great deal overall. This is one of the stand outs; a well balanced and blended combination of milk stout and coffee with a  superb mouth feel on par with barrel aged oatmeal stouts. Ninkasi and Sierra Nevada did a great job on this; I enjoyed it much more than any of Ninkasi's stand alone stouts, maybe a bit more than Narwhal. Great beer and a great series to try. It's been a great trip.","LiquidAmber","Sep 24, 2014"

It’s not as big, rich, deep, or complex as a massive American Double/Russian Imperial Stout, but it retains a lot of the best qualities from those styles and imparts it on a (relatively) moderately-sized, extremely satisfying Milk Stout. It’s not syrupy or as sweet as some milk stouts can be. Instead, it’s a smoother, balanced take on an American-style coffee stout. It definitely benefits from being a little larger than other milk stouts, as it wraps in more coffee and chocolate flavor than others. Overall, it’s just an extremely good beer, and I wish it were a regular.","fmccormi","Sep 07, 2014"

Tastes is a nice interplay between roasted notes and coffee. A touch of chocolate and lingers sweetness. The mix of coffee, roast, chocolate and sweetness is balanced well. Mouthfeel is a little thinner than I expected and want, but it isn't thin. Very good beer. And I'm surprised and the abv.","Jmamay22","Aug 30, 2014"

Taste is dominated by nice flora coffee notes which are dry but not astringent. Chocolate notes are also quite interesting. Body is about average for style with good carbonation.

Bright coffee flavor on the nose, followed by some dark fruit and the conventional bitter chocolate. Whoa, after taking a sip, I'm confused if it's a dark roast coffee or a beer. Quite an intense coffee flavor, a little dry hop at the end and some sweetness but coffee, coffee, coffee. Lighter than expected on the mouthfeel which is always nice with these big stouts. Not exactly my type of go to beer but it's advertised as a double latte, and boy did they hit it right on. Kinda crazy that the two stouts in the Beer Camp turned out to be the best beers.","bneel317","Aug 10, 2014"

A gorgeous looking beer, true to form for a good stout. Scents of milk chocolate, coffee with cream, roast malt, hints of black coffee, and a low, slight perception of grassy hops. A good, rich, milk stout aroma profile that is very appealing. Flavor begins with a rich, roasted malt and semi-sweet chocolate flavor, balanced by a cream-like sweetness and milk chocolate notes. This moves into a middle dominated by notes of strong coffee with a bit of cream and chocolate keeping it from becoming too dry. Finish is low-dry with notes of rich black coffee, roast malt and a bit of cream-like sweetness balancing the dry flavors. Aftertaste is dry with notes of rich black coffee and roast malt. A wonderful flavor profile that highlights the flavors of a milk stout and enhances them with the use of coffee. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth and creamy with moderate-light carbonation. Smooth and easy to drink hiding its high ABV wonderfully. Overall this is a fantastic milk stout that has a rich, robust aroma and flavor and a smoothly drinkable mouthfeel. The coffee addition is detectable in both aroma and flavor and enhances the base qualities of the beer. A wonderful beer.","Auraan","Aug 07, 2014"

Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, roasted malt, cream, light vanilla, light caramel, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and lactose notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, cream, light vanilla, light caramel, dark bread, light char, and roasted earthiness. A fair amount of roasted coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, cream, light vanilla, dark bread, light char, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and lactose flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is great.

The taste was my favorite part with a lot of sweet flavors like chocolate and cream in the beginning with great coffee and espresso flavors finish the brew giving it a semi-sweet bitter ending.

Head eventually dissipates into a solid 1/8th inch skim with semi-concentric half bands of lacing revealed during the tasting. Nose expresses coffee, roast and a hint of lactose towards the back. Taste follows nose - a pleasant coffee milk flavor profile with a little chalkiness. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a crisp, even carbonation. Just an all around great coffee milk stout. Too bad it's a one-off. Would live to see it in cans.","Jwale73","Jul 26, 2014"

4.29,3.4,4.25,4,4.5,4.25,4.25,"The beer pours a decent creamy head that dissipates quickly but still leaves a thin tannish head on the beer. The beer leaves lots of lacing. The beer itself is a very dark brown that borders on black.Obviously, the beer is opaque because of the color. The beer smell has strong roasted notes and bitter coffee notes with a little bit of sweet dark chocolate. The coffee notes comes in two varieties: dark and roasted. The lactose also adds a slightly sweet note but gets lost in the coffee. The taste has the same notes but the coffee notes are not as strong and, as a result, the lactose is stronger but still slightly faint. The roasted coffee is also closer to the point where you get a better sense of where the coffee starts and where the malts start. The mouthfeel is heavy bodied and thick with light carbonation. Overall ,a fantastic collaboration. The beer is a lot more roasted than the average milk stout but the addition of the coffee makes it taste really indulgent. I kinda wish I could drink this for breakfast.","HattedClassic","Jul 26, 2014"

Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about a 2 inch tan head that sticked around for a long time. There's also a good amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like coffee, bittersweet chocolate, lactose/cream, and some nuts. I think the taste is mostly just like the aroma, but there's also some vanilla noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's smooth and creamy with moderate carbonation. This is tied for being my favorite beer in the Beer Camp 12 pack.

Hops are present lending some buttering notes to the finish, more of german or english hops than american seems, which keeps the profile on point. I like the character of the beer, and the full body helps pull throughout the strong coffee and roasty flavor.

Roasted malt joined by dark roasted coffee, and lightly bitter espresso. Mellows to milky sweetness. Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth and slightly silky mouthfeel. A nice solid stout.

This is a delicious brew, just not one of my favorites. It is the best milk stout that I have ever tasted, but that's not much of a complement. Also, why add actual coffee? It eliminates the possibility of making your brew a session beer: who wants to be buzzed and wired at the same time? You can mimic coffee flavor with varieties of toasted grains.","BeerDocT","Jul 19, 2014"

2.86,-31.1,3,2,3.25,3,3,"I felt the need to write a review, due to the fact that I disagree with the overwhelming positive reviews this beer is getting. More power to those who enjoy this, but this is the weakest milke stout I've ever had. Comparing this to, say, Mikeller's Milk Shake is like comparing night and day. This brew touts it's inclusion of lactose and coffee. The coffee is apparent when tasting, but there is little to no aroma to be had for a beer that pushes the coffee. As for the """milk", all I get is a fake tasting, milk like overtone. There are plenty of milk stouts out there that can make an authentic tasting milky flavor, but lactose or not, this is not it. The after taste is where the coffee really settles in, but it's not enough to hold together this brew. I had the Maillard's Odyssey from the same pack, which was very well done, so I was a bit more than a little disappointed when I tried this. An unfortunate brew.","supercodes","Jul 17, 2014"
