"Great tasting stout. Nice color and nice dark head when poured."
"O- a good milk stout.  simple and to the point and well balanced."

"Got it because the quirky packaging caught my eye. Was not disappointed. It's an oddly smooth for how thick it is and its got an amazing foam to it. So smooth. I can't remember another stout that's gone down so easy. Great beer. Would buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
"I really enjoy the creaminess of this beer.  Great head, even better taste."
""
"Smooth, delicious, milky tasty fantasticness"
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark brown with light head and little lacing. Smells of toffy and malt. Light on the tongue, but decent roasted flavors linger with no discernable alcohol. Very tasty!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very nice not-so-sweet sweet stout. Better than their popular pale ale."
""
""

"I was expecting a tolerable cheap beer.  What I got was a surprisingly pleasant cheap beer.  A little sweet, a little roasty, no hops to speak of.  This one's pretty simple and goes down easy, and ain't nothing wrong with that."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A rather tasty, somewhat, but not overly, drier-milk stout, which packs a whole lot of flavor into a little bit of abv.  This is a rather nice more winter style, sessionable brew."
""
""
""
""
"Just plain good. Also, love the cans."

"Impressive milk stout. Moo Thunder will be on the shopping list for future beer runs (as long as I see it in Orange County)."
"O: The nose gave it away with its lack of luster. The flavor profiles are pleasing, but far too subtle. The mouthfeel is the final straw. It’s too light, too watery. Honestly one of the first beers I feel I can clearly identify the influence of the water used in the brewing process. Not terrible, just not what I’m looking for in a milk stout."

"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, vanilla, and cocoa aromas. Taste is much the same with char and slight cocoa flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of roast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is drinkable but the flavors in this one are quite char forward to me."
""
""
"This is a quite tasty stout, in fact I’m having trouble typing this review because I keep grabbing my glass instead. This is the (to me) perfect balance of malt sweetness and hop bitterness, such that I can’t taste any hops, only their closing bitterness. So far, this is the best offering I’ve had from Butternuts."
""
""
""
""
"O: A very simple stout. It imparts the chocolate and roasted malts characteristic of most stouts. However, the lack of complexity may turn off beer aficionados that are used to thick, complex stouts that linger on the palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"O: A decent everyday stout that I'd try again. Far from the best of the style, but definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I had hoped for this to be a winner. I am always pulling for beer from my area. This is an okay brew - but not my favorite in this category."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is, honestly, way better than I expected. I’ve had Pork Slap Pale Ale, and was thoroughly underwhelmed, but this stout is pretty excellent. It’s not the best milk stout in the world, but it's near the top of my budget beer list."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I was impressed with this one. It's a good balance between the roast and sweetness. Not much depth, but this is, simply, a milk stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not bad, Not memorable. Ok."
""
""
""
"If you have no interest in the extreme stout arms race, then this is a beer for you. If you are a veteran of those beers, however, you'll probably find Moo Thunder a bit bland."

""

"A very sessionable milk stout. Simple, but still exciting to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Overall: this tastes like a stout. it's a fine light tasty stout, but not like a saison or usual farmhouse ale. also while it's good, will not be craving it any time soon."
"Overall - A nice well balanced very drinkable stout. Not really remarkable in any way other than how well rounded it is. Worth picking up a can."
""
""
"a really underappreciated stout here, the best of both words, as it has some light sweetness in the finish, but also a bitter malt profile that balances this brew perfectly. dense dark brown from the can, rising pillowy tan head, great lacing. I smell cocoa powder and vanilla, both subtle but there behind dense chocolate malt, bitter barley, and a touch of char. the taste is much less aggressive and angry than the nose, with the lactose sugar really bringing this together beautifully, especially in the finish, which is soft and rich, desserty without being diabetic. huge body but an unbelievably delicate feel, creamy and velvety on my palate, and finishing clean and satisfying. scary drinkable for what it is, and to me a beautiful example of a style that is often tried, and infrequently executed well. this is really a lot better than its scores indicate here, one of new yorks hidden treasures."

"O: Great milk stout, no part is more overpowering than the others, very enjoyable."

"This actually is not a bad beer at all. While Young’s can be quite offensive in flavor, this packs tons of flavor for a 4.9% ABV beer. I’m really happy with having tried this. Not my favorite stout/porter, but a really good session option."

"It pours a dark opaque black with a datk brown frothy head with large bubbles. It has some particles in the bottom of the glass. It has a slight bready smell with a little booze in the nose as well. I get a lot of spur which makes me wonder if this batch was a little off. I was expecting more malty taste. It has a decent body and decent carbonation. I want to try a different batch of this beer at another date but if this is how this beer usually tastes I would not recommend over some of the others that are better."
"This is a strange beer. It has some notes that indicate a milk stout, but it also has some strange off notes. The tart finish is definitely off putting. The faint citrusy character is also a bit off putting. I think the citrus could work but it seems to accompany the tartness in the finish which I think is what makes it unwelcomed. I'm not sure this is a beer that I will get again, but I'm glad I tried it once."

"o - very drinkable and enjoyable for the most part."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it's slightly below average for me. I see that people are raving about it, but I need to be honest--it isn't a taste I'd go out of my way to have again. With so many good milk stouts out there these days, I will pass on Moo Thunder."
""
""
""
""
"O: Very easy to drink and the low ABV makes this a sessionable milk stout. Enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The mouthfeel stands out as smooth, satiny and surprisingly light, without being watery. The dominant smell is sweet dark chocolate and dark roasted malt. Taste is simple- a bit of milky sweetness, a hint of dark chocolate, tasty roasted character. Nothing overwhelming, but overwhelmingly pleasant throughout. A great session stout. And you can't beat it at 8$ a 6 pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-ouch this is just horrible. It's actually gross. It's sour? Not a good sour! The sort of sour that old milk is. Yuck. Going down the drain."
""
"O: this was a decent stout that I would have again."
""
""
"O- a nice stout in a can, good flavors but it was a little thin."
""
""
""
"O - This starts off well, and if it was described as a dry stout I may have rated it higher, it's not entirely unpleasant to drink. But I'm just not sure Butternuts knows what they're doing, so I'm docking them for the incorrect description of this beer style."
""
""
""
""
"A very nice beer and great way to end my variety pack. Would definitely have it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D-Surprisingly good. I have avoided this beer and all beers by Butternuts. After this I feel as though I may need to try some others by Butternuts. This is neat beer in a cool can. Far exceeded my expectations."
""
"Notes: Very solid and drinkable. Cheers."

"Moo Thunder Stout pours a solid black, with about two fingers of light caramel foam crowning the beer. There's decent head retention on display, as well as some lightly sticky lacing. The nose is nice, smells of light, sweet coffee, with a slightly heavy roast edge to it. The flavor profile retains that coffee note, but leans a little bit heavier on the roast. The result is that the taste comes across as a little too dry and roasty at times. The body is solidy full, especially for a low ABV beer. It could stand to be a little more creamy though, and is paired with a slightly overactive carbonation. Moo Thunder is a passable Sweet Stout, and definitely makes a better impression than the American Pale Ale I just had before from Butternuts."
""
"O: Decent given its style and smooth, but lacks complexity and flavor/fragrance intensity"
""
""
""
"o: not impressed by any means."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall one of my favorite milk stouts. Keeps it nice and simple which makes it refreshing. Great to either start or end a night."
""
""
""
"Had this on cask, but I'd like to try the canned product. Hopefully it is just as good."
"Decent milk stout. Nice texture very light. Slainte"
""
""
"Like many milk stouts, it doesn't wow or break boundaries, but it's solid and satisfies that craving for a lighter stout. The price and can format are pluses, definitely wouldn't mind sessioning it."
""
""
""
"Deep roasty stout, nicely carbonated that creates a slightly bitter dry mouthfeel. Very drinkable with hints of chocolate, biscuit, and herbal character."
"Overall - loved it. Maybe my go to cold weather/dessert beer"
""
""
""
"Poured at the local bar. Huzzah, I'll be the first to review it on tap. Sadly, it's sort of underwhelming. It seems like the beer went sour. Burnt chocolate taste is still there, like it was in the can, but not really much in the creamy stout department. Such a disappointment."
""
"O: Another extremely sessionable beer by Butternuts. Could use a little more sweetness as per the style, but aside from that this is an above average milk stout. And it comes in a can. Sweet!"
""
""
"O: a well-crafted stout that is less sweet and more smokey than average for style. For your own good, do not drink this ice cold or directly out of the can!"
"Overall: A decent milk stout to come out of a can. You don't too much of these here on the east coast and a nice addition to the short lineup of them. I could revisit this again in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Most certainly worth a try!"
"A really nice tasty stout. It's an unseasonably cool January evening in NYC (opposed to a bitter cold January evening), and this is the perfect match for my wife's beef stew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very good milk stout."
""
"This is an OK stout, especially for the price point ($9.99 for a six pack on Long Island). That said, I'd probably look elsewhere for something that has stronger milk stout characteristics."
""
"Poured from a can into a tumbler pint, the beer is jet black with a frothy, light, foamy light brown head that is roughly a half an inch, and it clings to the glass like crazy. Mild chocolate tones sweeten up the toasted barley backbone and the smooth, malty presence. Flavors are light and mild, on a slick, thin body. Smokey roasted coffee and dark chocolate throughout, with a light malt sweetness that balances everything out nicely. The aftertaste is more on the coffee side, with some roast and bitter qualities. The finish is dry, and leaves the mouth quickly, with a slight astringency from all the bitter qualities. Good, solid stout."
"Overall: The low ABV makes this a stout that I could drink multiple of in one sitting, but does not blow me away enough to purchase if I had other options."
""
""
""
"O-Very enjoyable. Not jaw dropping but very delicious"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Smooth and straightforward, but it is difficult to identify the flavor profile- as none of the flavors truly present themselves fully. Well balanced and drinkable, but not memorable either."

"D: Rich cocoa & lactose sweetness, but also nicely roasty. Not complex, but impressive depth. Very solid everyday stout. Highly drinkable."
"Overall, a decent, good stout, definitely on the burned side."
"O= The first impressive offering that I've found in this 4-pack which is now finished."
"Pitch black in color with a modest tan head. Smells mega-roasty, almost burnt. Some sweetness and a bit of hazelnut also in the nose. The roasted flavors and the lactic sweetness in the palate are bold and pronounced. Tasty, but might benefit from more subtle flavors and greater complexity. Light carbonation with a thinner mouthfeel than most milk stouts. Decent beer overall."
"Overall not something I would seek out but if I got a six pack for say 8.00 it would not be something I would avoid. A decent offering."
"D-Pretty tasty and another low ABV, yet flavorful from Butternuts; very nice."
"I poured this cool looking can of beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer poured a opaque beer with a nice brown head. The beer had a thick coffee smell. The beer tasted like it had burnt malt in it and the mouthfeel was chewy. The beer tasted like a milk stout with a hint of smoke in it. I like and will buy again."
"Very decent stout, quite surprised by this, not a fan of Butternuts so far. Give it a shot, great value for sure."
"Overall- It is fairly unique compared to other stouts. I'd say if you're curious enough to read a review, it's worth trying this beer. It's good and i might consider buying it again, but it's not my favorite stout by any means. I prefer imperial stouts, but this is better to session with. It was a tasty brew and I don't mean to offend the brewers, but it is easily forgettable, however I am curious about some other beers this company offers...craft brew in a can is something I'm becoming strangely fond of."
"Enjoyable but not something I would hunt down regularly."
"SOLID, NOT MUST HAVE!"
"O/D: Maybe a good beer to have a few of around a campfire, but that’s about it. Lacking a robust flavor and fuller mouthfeel makes this one under appealing."
"o: I never tried anything from Butternuts because I think their graphics are cheesy. My mistake, this is a great beer and a bargain to boot."
"O/D: It has some off flavors, and unfortunately they are up front. Once over that hurdle, the positives give way, a decent cocoa powder flavor is introduced, but can't tell if it's fake or natural."
"Overall, not the greatest stout in the world, not even the best canned stout (Ten-Fidy), but for a dark beer you can drink a lot of, this sure kicks the crap out of Guinness."
"This was the last can from a mixed 12 pack that I picked up and is definitely the best one of the bunch. Nice beer that I would pick up some more of."
"O: The beer is very easy to drink and its low alcohol content and relatively light-bodied nature make it a very sessionable stout."
"O - Quite a good stout, really. Nothing that knocks you over the head, but the flavors are all there and quite well balanced. A very drinkable yet distinct brew."
"Definitely worth a try."
"the CPJ"
"Overall - Pretty good milk stout. Not sure if I would get again but nonetheless, it was good to try."
"Reminds me of my first Guinness, sans the nitro. Solid and worth a try."
"A very tasty beer that went down smooth and easy. The flavor had a lot more depth than I expected, especially from a can, and while this might have been on the thin side, I really enjoyed it."
"Overall, this is a good stout, and I doubt there are many from a can that could be said to be much better. The beer boasts good flavors, and in decent quantities. One of the only faults is a faint metallic bite around the edges, though I'm not sure if that's due to the can or something related to the brewing process. Either way, this is a stout worth trying."
"Final Thoughts: It's decent. It would be the perfect stout for a first timer. Big malts, light hops, light body, smoky. A good start point and your not starting them on the best, so theres plenty of room to show them the better. Just hope the """turning milk""" smell does turn them off."
"Bought this beer because I needed decent craft beer that came in a can, for an afternoon at a private lake. The beer didn't disappoint me. It's a thick, black color. Frothy brown head. The aroma is a nice mix of grain, chocolate, and dark fruit. Nice aroma. The flavor is balanced, but maybe a tad on the sweet side. Full in body. This is a nice beer."
"O: Ok , pretty good as go the 3 I have sampled this is the best and might not still order another a bit small on taste as far as the style goes there are a few really great ones out there , and this is a bit over average for me."
"D: Not the greatest beer overall, but I could certainly take this one down like a lager."
"Overall, o.k. but not a lot of flavor and pretty forgettable."
"This is a good stout, particularly if one is looking for a lighter, more drinkable stout rather than a monster."
"UPDATE: The very unpleasant sour milk experience may have been an aberration. I recently tried a different beer at a restaurant and got a similar taste -- but I tried another beer from the pack and it tasted much better. I will re-review this someday and hopefully get a better result."
"Burnt black patent malt flavor.  Relatively thin for the style. Nice stronger hop finish that makes this notably different from most stouts"
"A fairly average stout, not bad if looking for a budget stout except this isn't cheap enough to be considered budget in my books. Cute label though."
"Overall, I like this brew as its a nice combonation of stout flavors for a milk stout. The earthier flavors mix well with the lactose."
"Overall, not really impressed by this stout. Flavors are average at best, there is certainly no Wow factor to this stout at all. The aroma lied to me, making me believe this was going to be a tasty brew. Give it a shot if you're into average stouts."
"Nice feel on this one. Creamy feel with a full body. Overall this one impressed me quite a bit. A very well done stout and a fun canned offering."
"Pours black and brown edges. Light tan frothy head dissipates pretty quickly. Aromas are chocolate and coffee, flavors follow but there's a tinge of an oldish earthy characteristic that comes and goes. Medium mouthfeel and no complaints about the carbonation. Can easily put a few of these down and will definitely go back for more."
"Pours a deep brown/ black with no head and reasonable lacing. Aroma is light: some coffee beans, earthy, some Light chocolate and slightly earthly. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Taste is of coffee beans, some hops, a hint of slices, a bit of vanilla, and some sort of burnt taste I can't identify. Overall a pretty good brew from a mixed twelve pack of cans."
"O-Decent example of a milk stout. Very drinkable. I could have several of these in a row. The flavor is simple, but not boring or one dimensional."
"Deep dark brown, light shines through on edges, disapointing lack of head. Scent is of dark roasted and charred malts with lactose comming though in the end. First sip is heavily roasted and charred, faint thoughts of dark cocoa powder, lactose is very subdued, lacks the sweetness expected from a milk stout. Towards the end of the can, the char is the dominant note and obliterates the palate. Medium bodied, watery at times, lacks creamynes from style, long lingering char notes. Not a great milk stout due to the overwhelming char and lack of lactose sweetness and weak body."
"O: I liked this one. I wouldn't rank it up their with Surly Four, Moloko, or anything like that, but it did the job. Good stuff!"
"Notes - for what this is, its very nice. Will buy again when i want to drink multiples in a night or in the mood for something roasty and light."
"D: This was a very simple stout, but it was clean and enjoyable. Not much to it, so it was super easy to drink, but not easy to remember drinking. Was expecting a bit more sweetness and not as dry from a milk stout."
"D - Very drinkable. Not too heavy and goes down very smooth. It could have used a bit more body, but is really smooth and light and not empty as it is."
"Drinkability is well good this would make a good summer stout for me. Favorable with out being big and heavy which can be a bad thing out in the middle of summer when u looking for something to quench our thirst."
"This is an acceptable stout. It is nothing to write home about, but is enjoyable. If you are curious, you may like it, but I wouldn't go out of my way to obtain it."
"Overall: I can see what Butternuts wanted to accomplish with this stout but I think they might have gone too overboard with the hops. The beer was not too bad but I think there better uses of time."
"My biggest complaint with this beer is the mouthfeel- it's WAY too watery. However, I do love the container, and there are sure to be times I would drink this right out the can, so maybe that would be less noticeable. Low ABV makes this a decent option if you're looking for a non-lager kickball beer."
"Notes: This beer is one of my favorites and I don't really know why. It's just a great beverage to drink. It may not seem like much, but for whatever reason, it goes down really easily and isn't offensive in any way."
"Taste is weaker than I was expecting from the smell. Some light roast coffe in there maybe burnt chocolate, but it leaves a stale aftertaste in the mouth, which is slightly offputting. Mouthfeel is definitely watery and takes away from the experience. I expected a creamier and heavier feel. Its not terrible by any stretch, but its not the best beer I've ever had. I'll try their others though for sure."
"O: an average stout with a below average mf, what saves this beer is being in a mixed 12 pack."
"O- Decent overall, but forgettable. I love this style and I have had much better, but I have also had worse. I would be interested to try this on a nitro-tap like Left Hand or Young's Double Chocolate (both of which I had the same night)..."
"grab one...laugh at the can...and enjoy."
"A very good session brew, would consider drinking this often at less than 5%. Drinkability would be exceptional if not for the body."
"D - very drinkable, possibly too drinkable, if there such a thing, personally i like to feel like I should be savoring my stouts, while this one is a bit light and watery."
"Future outlook: Nothing about this beer jumps up and grabs you, but it is nevertheless a solid, easy drinking stout. As beer that doesn't come here, not one to seek out, but certainly not one to avoid if you happen upon it."
"D: Quite drinkable, actually very tasty. It's nice to find another canned beer (better packing in the fridge!) that's pretty tasty."
"I am loving the new can craze and especially the stouts. I would love to take some of these on a cold hiking trip (that is, if ten fidy isn't available)"
"D- Definitely the strong point for this brew. Low abv with a good amount of taste."
"A jet black fluid with a brown head. Good retention and a moderate fade. Spots of lace here and there. Smell of coffee and dark roasted grains. Sweet caramel and light molasses. Taste is like a great cup of coffee. Touch of mocha. A bit of sweet lactic sourness. Dry earthy finish with dark roastyness. Feel is light with a good carbonation. Very drinkable. A good one for winter or summer. Simple and very well done I will be keeping this one around the house. Great beer here."
"Nothing too flashy, but a pretty decent stout with some mild but pleasant flavor. As long as the price was within reason, I'd purchase this again."
"Taste is a milky smooth darker malt, with very light hop throughout. Moderate carbonation. Very evenly balanced, and quite tasty."
"Black/deep brown body with a thin tan head that persists throughout. Aroma is of chocolate, dry roasted malt, some wood notes. Flavor follows the nose with a chocolate malt sweetness, balanced by an earthy roast character. Getting some chocolate milkshake and caramel flavor as well. Creamy smooth body with a clean toasty finish. Very drinkable, very well priced."
"Average drinkability."
"Notes: Quiet brew, but quite recommendable. Nothing extraordinary but it is a notch well above average."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body of the beer is light but not watery. The carbonation levels are on the lower side but work out well. This is a very nice comforting milk stout. No gimmicks involved just straight up well made beer. Moo Thunder brings the thunder to your glass."
"a wee bit watered down and a little sourness to the finish which is a little unpleasant, but overall this is a pretty good stout, and a novelty out of a can."
"Pitch black with thick, creamy, light brown head and great head retention and lacing. Rich, roasty malt aroma with plenty of chocolate. Sweet smelling. More chocolate flavor, less roasty but still some coffee and burnt malts there. Thin tasting though, with a thin, watery mouthfeel."
"Pours deep black, two finger cream head. Pretty standard stout aroma, immediate roasted notes. Flavor is deep chocolate and bright. Not quite sure how to really describe it. Graham cracker notes as it opens up. Some almost savory notes appear as well Finishes very clean. Easy to drink and a great representation of the style for me."
"This is a good beer. If this was regular offering around me I would buy it from time to time."
"Pours black with a lasting, thick, brown head and nice lasting. Aroma of bready, roasted malt, dry fruit and some coffee. Body is light for a stout, high carbonation. Flavors are light coffee, vanila, dry fruit and roasted malt. Short, bitter finish. Somewhat light for a stout but not bad for the price."
"goes down easy, and is an easy session beer for the price, but the only thing that would keep me coming back is the fact that its local. nothing too special."
"D- A nice canned stout that's lighter in ABV, would love to try this super fresh."
"Drinkability: I was hoping for more in terms of a milk stout from this brewery. The sour astringent taste and dry finish were more prominent than what I would have liked. I probably will not be revisiting this one in the near future."
"I love this stout for the taste. Perfect with a nice porter house on the grill."
"Pours a dark brown with a thin mocha head that has a bit of staying power. The nose brings forward some roasted malt as well as a good deal of both dark and milk chocolate. The taste is roasted malt and some chocolate as well. Mouthfeel is of a medium body with lower levels of carbonation. Drinks pretty well all around. Nothing too bad here, which I was quite fearful of."
"12oz can pours a deep, brown color. Any head doesn't stick around for very long. Slight lacing. Aromas of chocolate and some roasted malts. Sweet smell. I taste some chocolate and coffee along with the malt flavors. Somewhat of a thin stout. Drinkable and tasty."
"Damn decent milk stout. Wouldn't mind a few of em'."
"All-in-all a pretty simple and tasty stout. Nothing to complain about, but nothing really to rave about either."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with red highlights and a white head. The aroma is chocolate and roasted malt. A very nice aroma. The flavor is not as good as the aroma. I get some roasted malt and toffee, but I also get something that resembles earth/dirt. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Overall a solid beer, nothing too special, but worth a taste and another purchase."
"Deep black in color with a thick beige head after the pour that slowly dissipates and leaves no cap or lacings. Roasted malty aroma with hints of chocolate, vanilla and dark fruit. Smooth and creamy feel. A bit thinner than I expected, which made it less filling. Roasted malt flavor in the beginning with a touch of milky sweetness that tapers to a pleasant toasty malt character. Very easy to drink."
"This is beer, people. Beer that reminds us that sometimes simple can be best and its marketing reminds us that beer is, and always has been, fun. Flavorful, extremely drinkable and ... fun!"
"Nice to see a milk stout in a can, Moo Thunder with this crazy cartoon cow...okay I'll drink it. Poured into my imperial pint glass nice mocha tan head forms nicely with lacing strung evenly between sips. Body is dark nearly black, light toffee brown highlights when held toward the light just around the edges of the glass. Aromatics offer up dark roasted malt with creamy lactose sweetness. Hints of anise a touch of meaty soy sauce with herbal hops in the background. Flavor has a rounded creamy sweetness, with dark chocolate and mild coffee from the nearly burnt malted barley additions. Herbal hops underlying a nice session milk stout out of the can what complexty and nice flavors from a canned stout, this is excellent. Soft even carbonation creates a silky smooth mouthfeel, again I was scared to try these beers base off of SIDT's nightmare tasting show they had, but I'm glad I gave these guys a fair shake. I'm wondering if they're case was out of date or not. Drinkability again great stuff sessionable and packed with flavor, what every beer drinker out there is looking for."
"D: A decent brew easy to drink"
"Drinkability is fairly high, as it is not a bad stout and doesn't take up that much room in your belly. This beer is also not a palate-cleanser with it's mild flavor and feel."
"Overall - A very enjoyable stout - might be a little sweet for some though... recommended..."
"From the 12 fl. oz can with no lot code or expiration date. Sampled on August 28, 2010. The pour is a rich black with a quick one inche tan head that dissolves down to a thin ring around the glass. Lacing is short-lived too. The aroma is of burnt dark chocolate, modest malts, and milk. The taste has a full-bodied chocolate bitterness with a sharp hoppy bite toward the finale. A stout from a can! What do you know?"
"D - Great drinkability. The sweetness isn't overpowering at all, this could be a very good session-able beer."
"Drinkability: Got this is a mixed 12 predominantly because I wanted to get some Pork Slap Pale Ale for a friend. Who says beer geeks are not subject to marketing. A robust and flavorful carry me through all the reading I need to do for the start of school tomorrow."
"This is a pretty interesting beer. Some might call it boring, but I'm really starting to appreciate subtle, restrained beers like this. Its far from perfect, but if you're in need of some dark roasted flavor in a session-like beer, this one fits the bill. Bonus points for beer in a can, not to mention the fun artwork on the label."
"Pours a pitch black color with a near two finger head of light sand head into a snifter as the head receeds it leaves layers of lacing really nice looking and it's opaque enough to block out the sun. Smell has smoke, stale cinnamon, dare i say whole milk, coffee and chocolate notes are present as well. Taste has sweet malt and bittersweet/bakers chocolate up front coffee and a touch of bitterness in back. Mouthfeel is creamy and viscous but has a thinness to it that could be made up for on tap. I would have no problem drinking a few of these"
"This is a gorgeous looking brew in the glass; opaque black with a huge dark mocha colored head having massive longevity. The nose is MMMOOOoooo...like smoked fresh heavy cream mixed with just ground fresh espresso beans smoked over beechwood, simply fabulous. The taste is akin to the nose; dark heavily French or Italian roasted beans with some dark chocolate nibs thrown in for good measure. Very malty and milk like in flavor, its an oddity that the mouthfeel is surprisingly quite lithe. Thin in the mouth with little body, the mouthfeel is totally out of synchronous with the rest of the factors; this is unusual statistically speaking. One would expect some additional creaminess and weight in a brew as well endowed as this and I must say it was obvious when I poured it from the can that this would be the case. Although a fairly negligible demerit, this is nevertheless a well made and enjoyable milk stout that has a bit of a Bamberg brewing influence. This my friends is one way to get your vitamin D !"
"D-You can pound these...a nice diversion in the hot weather....Bravo to these guys for making a sessionable stout."
"Very drinkable. A good session beer because of its light feel and taste. On my list for future purchases, when my batch of cream stout gives out."
"D: Very good but I might want to quit the sweetness after a couple."
"Drinkability: Decent surprise. Other than the mouthfeel, this was a solid beer. I would probably have again, but I'm not going out of my way to seek it out."
"This milk stout has a creamy mouthfeel with flavors of lactose, chocolate, and cocoa. This brew is worth a try."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied overall and pretty light for the style. The carbonation is moderate overall as well. Drinkability is pretty decent, it had some nice roasty and bitter flavor to it and was pretty smooth overall."
"The aroma is thick with roasted malt and a sweetness of brown sugar. There is also a faint antiseptic/band-aid like aroma. The flavor is almost entirely roasted malts, slightly sweetened, fairly smooth. Low but present bitterness. Mouthfeel is thin to moderate. Still I'd say it's fairly drinkable."
"d- really shines here. a nice beer from a cool company with a great image. nice designs, cans, and overall just breaking for the norm...seem to be getting me picking up certain beers more and more. I would definitely grab a 6er of this one after the single can trial run."
"Butternuts Moo Thunder is a pitch black beer with a dense, light brown head that thins a bit and leaves thick sheets of lacing. It has an aroma of chocolate and coffee. It smells like a Jamocha Shake. It's medium-light bodied and pretty smooth. It leaves the tongue a little chalky and numb. It's a tad watery. It's lightly flavored and just a touch sweet. It never becomes cloying. It tastes roasty-- more like coffee than chocolate; not dark roast coffee. A note of caramel is detected. There's no bitterness, really. This is a simple and easy to drink beer. It's definitely the best I've had from Butternuts."
"Pours a nice opaque sable with a fairly thick beige head that sticks around for a bit. Aroma is like a fine roast coffee, rather smoky and inviting. Flavor is like a cold mocha with coffee and unsweetened chocolate tones and just a hint of molasses. Texture is smooth, just a little tingly and a bit on the thin side, but this is the beer's weakest aspect. All in all, a decent stout, not the best but still palatable."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a decent stout with enough flavor and substance to make it worth drinking for a long time if you're in the mood for a sessionable stout."
"7/10"
"Poured a darkish-brown, almost black body with some offwhite head that disipates slowly. A good roasted and sweet malt presence but some aluminum funk as well. Smooth, creamy, light on the malts but still has a dark cocoa/roasted malt taste alonf with some caramel and coffee for an easy drinking sweet stout with a dry finish. Nothing exceptional but for the cost I could drink a few of these...and only b/c of the cost."
"Basically this is a milk chocolate beer...and I prefer dark chocolate. There's a bit of coffee in there, and there is basically a whole lot of malt. Lacks a bit of the balance I would have wanted - sweetness or bitterness. A little lighter body then I would have expected, and this beer is incredibly dry, which hinders its drinkability in my book. Overall its alright, but not the best stout I've ever had..."
"D - If the acid taste doesn't bother you, I can see this being very easy to pound. Very smooth and creamy."
"Pretty dark in color-not quite a solid black. Small, tight tan head. Moderate amount of roasted aroma-touch of sweetness as well. Really nice roasted/grainy flavor. Good level of bitterness with a touch of sweetness in the finish. A lot of flavor here. Good body as well. Very, very drinkable. Easy going down-I could see this being a session beer for me."
"D - I would be happy to see this at a party. I would also buy one or two at the bar. However, it is not tasty enough to be an all night drink."
"The Moo Thunder Stout pours a deep cola brown with a 1.5 finger tan head that bubbles away quickly. Not much lacing in on the glass. Aromas consist of burnt coffee with a musky aged smell that lingers. No malts are noticed, not the best smelling. Taste is somewhat watery with coffee dominating the flavors. Not much comes through on the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is somewhat watery and creamy. Drinkability, is meh. Easy drinker but not much to the nose or the palate. May skip in the future."
"Overall this is a fairly decent stout that took me by surprise. Nothing flashy or fancy, but fairly well done. I'll definitely have another."
"D: A decent representation of style, not a fabulous beer but a highly drinkable beer. Drinkability would be higher if the body was not quite so watery save for the finish."
"Decent beer, especially one from a can. Tried this at a new spot near my apartment called """The Passenger.""" It was pretty good - hard to tell though because of the can. For a lot of it, I kept tasting the can. The smell was of aluminium (surprise) and toffee and chocolate. Taste was less bitter than I had expected, a nice stout to finish off the night. Would like to try this beer again, but in a glass next time."
"D: This wasn't as good as an experience as I had hoped for. The first time I drank this beer was on the day I bought it, straight from the can, and it was good. The can I just reviewed has been in my fridge for a month, I don't know if that's going to affect it though."
"Brewery lists lactose sugar as brewing ingredient, so this might be better considered a milk or sweet stout. The dancing cow and name suggest the same. Pours a deep black. Nice, deep roasted malt flavor up front, with well balanced bittering. Wheels sort of come off the bus at the finish, however, with a rather sharp, acidic sourness."
"Poured from a 12 oz . can. Has a black color with a small head. Smell is mild, some malts and chocolate. Taste is also mild, again malts with some chocolate. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has decent drinkability. Overall a pretty good but unspectacular beer."
"Average stout which has a pretty looking cow on the front of the can. Overall I would not waste my money buying this beer."
"single from Ye Olde Spirit Shop, Frederick, MD"
"D - One would suffice. An excellent tasting beer with a lot to offer. Fills up fast though. My first experience with a canned stout turned out to be very pleasant."
"I bought this beer in a 6 pack at my local store of choice, once again Andover Liquors.This is a very good stout if you want a session beer , It pours a very typical nice black stout color and has not much head with a little spotted lacing , It has a very smooth mouth feel and a nice malty chocolatey aroma .The Moo Thunder has a creamy chocolatey taste and I would recommend it probably one of the best if not the best stouts i've had in a can. Along with a creative name the design on the can is also quite eye catching i definitely will drink this again !"
"Pours a straight jet black with a light halo of khaki head. The smell is mostly roasted matls, chocolate, and coffee. The taste follows almost exactly, though the coffee takes first precedence, followed by the malts, and the chocolate comes in as a side flavor in the back. Nice lightly medium body makes for a nice, straight-forward, highly drinkable stout."
"D: Even though there were some off-flavors, I still found this enjoyable. Nice flavor, and low ABV, makes this a great session stout. Especially, if you going someplace that only allows cans."
""
"Very drinkable, tasty beer."
"This stout feels a bit watery and thin, but it is no Imperial, so this is acceptable to me. Carbonation is great with this one. This is one of the more drinkable brews to come from a can."
"Overall-nice stout, not knock your shoes off good by any means but I like it for what it is."
"Drinkable based upon flavor, but the smell is hard to get past...probably will not seek this out again..."
"Drinkability: Certainly a lighter stout, almost what I would call a summer stout; decent enough"
"D: A fine brew, and a fairly good stout. I am really glad I got a chance to try this beer, and would love to try it on tap."
"Thanks to ericwo for sending this extra off of my wants list. Poured a dark brown, almost black, with a thin tan head that faded out pretty quickly. I saw that someone had described the beer as having a """cigarette butt""" smell and now it's all I can smell. It's also all I can really taste, cigarettes and booze. Some roasted malts. Not much more going on here. Thin and watery mouthfeel, light body. Pretty drinkable but I wouldn't drink more than one."
"The mouth feel was a little thin for me, but over all it passes."
"Speaking of mocha...yum. This was somewhere around 50-55 degrees when I popped it open, and it tasted like drinking a cool cup of carbonated mocha. Absolutely delicious. I had another one that was colder later in the day, and there was a lot less coffee to it. So depending on whether you like a good cup of joe or not, just drink this one at the right temperature and you'll get what you want."
"Drinkability low, mouthfeel fair. Not a repeat for me."
"Into a Guinness glass, poured near-black, with a finger of beige head that laced fairly well. The smell was of cocoa powder, toffee, nuttiness, and hop bitterness. The flavor revealed a very nice blend of chocolate-covered nuts from the getgo, dissolving to a slightly bitter finish. The mouthfeel was surprisingly creamy, which added to the flavor sensation, but did end on a slightly thin note. Definitely a good session stout."
" This is a fine stout in can! yes, that's stout in a can. that's fun to say."
"d- great sessionable stout. probabaly wont go seeking it out but i would deffinately drink it again."
"Overall a very solid offering here, nothing crazy but very good for a stout in a can for sure."
"The plus side is that with its easy drinking taste and its low abv (4.90%), this would be a great session stout. Very drinkable, indeed."
"Pours a very dark brown with a nice mocha tan head that leaves a little layer throughout the session. The smell is roasted malts, coffee and chocolate and the taste is much of the same. This one is in my opinion, the perfect example of a simple American Stout. The mouthfeel isn't too thick or cloying and I sucked it down way too fast. These showed up in PA recently so I will definitely be stocking up on these."
"Overall this certainly isn't a bad stout but more body and deeper flavors would help it out immensely."
"I let the artwork get the best of me here. This one is so bad I don't think I'll ever try another from this brewery. Let me know if i'm wrong. Tastes like a weak watered down oatmeal stout. Pour and head are unimpressive. Why bother mass producing this? If it was a home brew I would say keep trying buddy, but they brewed this in a brewery. bah!"
"Always happy to try a craft beer in a can, and this one also lists some nutritional info (makes me wonder what effect that would have on the consumption of big huge beers, but I digress). Opaque not-quite-black. Weak head that faded to some shadowing on the surface. Smells like dark roasted malts, chocolate, with a hint of oily coconut. The flavor resembles the aroma closely, especially up front, but then the taste just kinda drops off. Some bitterness sneaks back. As it warms, some fruitiness comes in to add a little something, but it's still not quite enough to make this something I'd reach for again. Not horrible, but not so exciting. I might only think about this one again if someone is specifically looking for a non-imperial stout in a can."
"D = This goes down pretty easily, but it is just not good enough to really make you want to keep drinking it."
"Final thoughts: Its a pretty basic thick milk/oatmeall stout not bad nonetheless. I was surprised how nice it ended up after reading some of the other reviews. This can is also about a year old so I wonder if that changed the beer."
"Drinkability: One to skip. Alright, so Butternuts, thinking outside the brew box, aimed for a not-so-stout milk stout, so look for a beer that's washed out and watered down in terms of taste and peppered with a few off-flavors."
"This one is easy to consume and interesting enough to handle a discussion."
"12oz can purchased at The Liquor Shoppe in Tygsboro, MA. Pours a pitch black opaque body with an inch of khaki head. Smells nutty, burnt, some smoky tobacco. All I taste is smoky tobacco too, bunt, planty. Moderate in both mouthfeel and carbonation. Astringency hurts the drinkability greatly. Not too impressed with this one..."
"D - This beer goes down well and it's a decent stout but there are better representations of the style."
"Definitely a beer I would seek out again."
"Pours very dark brown, nearing black with a thin head that fades to a ring. Smells slightly roasty and quite grainy, with a somewhat thin, grainy, sourness that intrudes a bit into the more pleasant top notes. The taste is pretty similar. Could have a bit more body, and if this were shifted a bit more eithwr to the dry side with more body, or as is to the sweet side, perhaps with some added lactic sugars, then this would hit the mark a bit closer. As is its drinkable but fairly forgettable."
"Drinkability: This is a surprisingly sessionable stout. I like the nutty taste. I could have several of these especially around a campfire."
"D: Modest ABV and nice, mellow roasted malt flavors allow this stout to be a nice afterdinner brew or latenight sipper. With summer rapidly approaching, find a little space for this stout in your cooler or camper."
"Very simple but well done stout in a can. No complaints, very rich, roasty and toasty. Great stuff for a fall camping trip or a cool summer night."
"The brew is light-bodied with plenty of extremely-fine carbonation. Were it not for the 'stout' word on the label, I'd be convinced I just had a nice, mild, quaffable Belgian ale. Did I? Who cares! At any rate, Moo Thunder is a tasty, interesting beer that comes in (amusing-looking) cans, and I could drink a few at a sitting for sure. Thanks for the canstas, Lumsta!"
"After dinner at a local restaurant, I ordered one of these ($5) and a piece of chocolate cake. Thought it would be a nice combo. Poured into a tall juice glass. Dark black color. Surprised to see really no head form. No lacing either. Not much smell to report, and the taste was sub par. It had a somewhat roasted barley flavor with a hint of milk chocolate. Only problem was that it seemed very watered down. Both the flavor and the body were extremely thin. Not what I expected or hoped for. I guess you could say it was easy to drink because it was so mild and watery, but I would not call this a great example of a craft stout. Though it did leave me curious as to what their other beers taste like in these funny looking cans."
"Poured from a 12 ounce can into my standard shaker glass. The stout appears a dark brown color with about a finger of lingering ecru foam. Smells and tastes of roasted grain, both bittersweet and milk chocolates, bitter grassy hops. A bit thin bodied with ample carbonation. Worth a try."
"Definitely worth a try, I may have this again."
"D- Not bad. This would be a very good golf course beer. The people I shared this beer with did not like the sweetness, but to me, it was no different than having a soda to knockout a thirst (not that I am comparing this beer to a soda-just it delivery in the heat!)."
"Sure goes down easily, as it's not heavy of texture, has an undemanding flavor and is light-bodied for the style; nothing offensive about it either. Hey, the can design totally suckered me in, I admit it."
"drinkability - Not bad for a canned beer. Would buy it again, worth a try. Easy drinking beer, funny name for a beer too."
"All in all, a reliable and tasty stout."
"D: Hmm, this was surprising. With the lactose addition, I expected a smoother, sweeter stout. What I got was more roasted and bitter, with a touch of souring. Still, it's good enough to have again if I were in the mood and somehow found a can in Oregon (or travels took me to NY). Thanks, John."
"Pours out black with a lot of dark ruby colors coming through where light passes. It has a nice tan head that leaves good lace and actually has hood retention. The aroma is very mild and of dark roasted malt. Nothing burnt or charred. The flavor is nothing special...it's not bad, but it's just a normal stout. In fact, I think this is the best butternuts beer I've had. I give them a lot of cred for canning their beers...great move."
"D- I could have a couple in a sitting, but not sure if I'd want to have much more than 2."
"Not my favorite stout, but still fairly impressive. Definitely went a long way to dispell the myth of no good beer comes in a can."
"Mouth feel is thick, full-bodied, and a joy to drink. Really god brew here, must try."
"Overall: The mouth feel is a lightly medium body that is creamy and flat. The finish is light and quick. I must admit the name on the can had me laughing, but the beer in the can doesn't have me laughing. The beer is rather uninteresting, flat and the burnt character is a little overwhelming. It is just okay."
"Not bad, especially compared to a couple other offerings from Butternuts and I actually finished the can. I just wish that the overall flavor had given up some more."
"drinkability this is on the same plane as those big 3 from Ireland"
"Ok this is not what I remember. I remember a beer that was thin, but flavorful (read above). This is just a thin, watery mess. Smells strange, like the inside of a rubber boot, and is virtually tasteless. What flavor can be detected has an off quality. Maybe they add ginger to this one too, like they do with the Pale Ale??? Not sure and don't care. Won't be buying it again."
"It's good Butternuts comes out and says that this isn't meant to be heavy or viscous. It might otherwise have been confusing with 'Thunder' in the name. I'm sure there are people who would prefer a stout this light bodied, I'm simply not one of them. I didn't dislike Moo Thunder, I enjoyed it an average amount, which seems about right considering it's an average stout."
"Silky dark roast really comes through. Minimal coffee. Smooth, milky mouthfeel. A prefectly uncomplicated and balanced stout. Freindly and pleasant though a bit watery."
"Thanks John.. this is another brew that I probably never would have traded for.. and now.. I gotta try their others... Galt loves a good canned Micro."
"Mouthfeel is not as light as a dry stout, but no where near a milk stout creaminess. Very smooth and would be a great alternative to Guinness."
"easy, friendly, doesn't have to be the center of attention ... really a delight I thought."
"Notes from: 3/6/08"
"Note: Avoid at all costs butternuts' website. It's pretty darn lame."
"Drinkability: Probably my favorite from the Butternuts mix pack. More carbonation would help this brew out a lot. But as far a flavorful stout I could drink a few of on a cooler day, this works for me."
"I'd definitely have this once in a while if it was local. Solid beer."
"6/3/7/3/14 (3.3/5)"
"Poured into straight pint glass. Poured with almost no head. I'm not a fan of a lot of head, but even splashing this from the can into the glass brought an absolutely minimal head. Aroma was very nice. Had that roasty smell that good stouts and porters have. Flavor followed the expectations that the aroma set. Nice body, although slightly thin for the style. Very drinkable. Of the 4 styles that came in a sampler pack I found this to be the best of the bunch. This stout doesn't seem to have the weird flavor the other 3 styles had. I would certainly drink this more regularly if it was locally available."
"D: This brew has some things going for it and then some things holding it back. It is a very easily drinkable brew. Just a good taste and good look, but the feel and nose is lacking. Still, this is not a let down in any way and I really enjoyed this beer. Thanks again, Larry."
"Drinkability: This is actually a pretty good, probably my favorite of the sampler four-pack, even though it's not my favorite style. The alcohol was manageable and completely hidden, the tastes textbook, enjoyable, and balanced. Give this one a shot."
"T + M + D: Modest, but still flavourful. Some light chocolatey flavours, along with modest coffee and a tasty maltiness that is certainly accessible. It's on the lighter side, as is the body, though it comes with a nice little carbonation kick to turn it up a notch. The ABV is presumably rather low (I haven't been able to find it, though I haven't searched too deep yet), and drinkability seems hellishly easy. Goes down extremely smooth. This could make for a reasonable session candidate."
"Pours a nice dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, not much sticky lacing though. The nose is malty, with some toffee, caramel, chocolate. The taste is sweet, malty, with the dark stuff. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a nice brew, recommended."
"Dark black in body and a tan one finger head. The head fell quickly to a transparent lace over the body. Lacing left on the glass from the head is almost completely solid. Nose is a subtle smoke, a little malt. Taste has a strong smoke flavor, mild carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, but the flavor is a bit boring on this one, the most I get are the smoked malts, though the carbonation picks up the more I go through it."
"Another guy in a can that I'm excited to try. Can features a hilarious cartoon cow dodging a black lightening bolt - I gotta show this pack around for the some laughs. I don't know why they felt it necessary to print on the side that the beer contains 150 calories, 8 grams of carbs and 1 gram of protein, and 0 grams of fat, but it just adds to the fun quirkiness. Pours your standard stout black with a brown foaming head. Smells of dark chocolate but not much else. Tastes great: yes on the dark chocolate, expresso, charred steak. Thick mouthfeel but not as dense as some in its class, which I suppose makes it more drinkable than most in its class. I'll buy another pack and bring it out with friends."
"An enjoyable stout - sweetish turning dryish. Some complexities going on for a lighter, easy-drinking stout."
"An okay stout, it has all the good characteristics but I felt the flavor and aromas were a bit muted."
"Pours an opaque dark brown color with a medium size, sticky tan head. A fair helping of roasted chocolate malt on the nose as well as a subtle but zingy hop character. Smooth and creamy enough to make this one session-able stout for sure. Just enough going on to keep interest. Solid malts give off notes of chocolate and light coffee all this is set atop of a fresh, fruity hop balance. Good semi-sweet grainy finish as well. Over all, a very nice beer."
"D= Nice drinkable stout here. Nothing world class, but also nothing to complain about either. Very sessionable."
"D: This is one of the easier drinking stouts out there. Nothing remarkable but perfect for the camping trip where you don't want to get shitfaced with Ten Fidy!"
"M&D - a surprisingly refreshing stout, easy to drink, not overpowering in any aspect, a good introductory stout, a rare sessionable stout"
"Pours black with a light tan head and moderate lacing. The smell is not overpowering mostly dark roasted malts with some hints of coffee and dark chocolate. The taste is much like the nose, noting that reaches out and grabs you but a nice mix of the roasted malts and a bit heavier on the coffee flavor. The mouthfeel is a bit thin but its covered by a slightly higher carbonation. This like all the other Butternuts beers is extremely drinkable. I enjoy the easy drinking simple brews from this brewery and wish they were more readily available around here."
"Overall, this is a nice simpler stout and I will revisit. I would recommend."
"pours black from the can with a very short tan head and a very light coating of lace. roasted malt, and strong bitter coffee aromas. taste is same. light to medium mouthfeel and carbonation is good. nice stout just lacking in appearance a bit. would buy again."
"D: A good mouthfeel and taste combination that led to this being a really good stout. Definitely a very drinkable stout."
"D-Roast flavour is good at the start but then...yawn....this one is a one trick pony. The lack of body hurts and the whole thing becomes boring and one dimensional as you taste the same bitter roast over and over and over. This beer has no depth at all. Certainly the best of the four Butternuts beers, but that isn't saying much."
"Overall, not an enjoyable beer. It wasn't toxic or anything, but glad I only bought one can and not a 6-pack. Can't recommend this one."
"D: Average drinkability, much better examples out there. Limited in complexity and while simply dark and rich, it wont hold your attention for long."
"Pours a deep black with a lively, off color head that leaves decent lacing. The aroma is strong, roasted malt, with an almost soy sauce-like intensity. The flavor, however, is milder, with a nice roasted malt character - woody, cherry-like, with a slightly bitter finish. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with just enough cling to emphasize the slight bitter finish. A nice drinkable stout, though nothing extraordinary in the genre."
"Feels milky smooth. A little bubbly too. Really nice feel to this beer. It's a good, drinkable stout. Mild, sweet and pleasant."
"This is a slick looking can... definitely a collectible, nothing beats a dancing cow. This stout is pretty damn good too. A little lighter bodied than the usual stout but I think it still works well. Plenty of flavors and carbonated well enough to make this an easy drinker. The best of the Butternuts line up."
"i probably would pass on this beer again but i would be interested to try it off draft rather than out of a can."
"Recommended..."
"I bought this as a tailgating beer and I suppose it will be ok for that purpose, but the fact that I found the other Butternuts beers to be pretty solid makes this one a big disappointment. I won't revisit this again after this 6er is consumed."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 2 1/4""" tan head over the clear ruby reddish brown brew. Large-bubbled head fades slowly, with sporadic chunky lacing. Aroma is effevescent dark malts, with something else foatin around that I can't quite put my finger on. Taste is lightly sweet upfront, worty in the middle, with a slightly crisp close. Mouthfeel could be easier, but drinkability remains pretty good. Kind of out of its element in this style, but for canned stouts it is a quite serviceable product."
"D. If this were more readily available it could be a main-stay. Almost has an Imperial Stout roasted character and was very enjoyable. This is a winner."
"One could perhaps describe the taste of this beer as being highly complex and remarkably well rounded. There is a highly present coffee flavor to this milk stout that gives off a rich and dark espresso undertone to the taste. Thanks to the very high presence of roasted malt flavor noticed in the offering, there is a very strong yet not burnt taste to the Moo Cow. Off in the background of the taste one can also find hints of chocolate present."
"Several things are commendable about Butternuts Beer And Ale: their attitude and their brewing philosophy, their website, and the fact that they use cans. I just wish Moo Thunder Stout was better beer. Thanks marcpal."
"Only an inch of deep tanish brown head is achieved with a strong pour. Fades in a couple of minutes leaving no lace. Body is a thin blackness. Nose has roasty sweet malt and a bit of smoke and some zesty spice. Enters the mouth with malt that is a little burnt around the edges and even has some nice carmalized notes. Even, rich and quite smooth overall. A solid stout that I cant say anything bad about. Mouthfeel is slightly thick and teamed with a bit of dry spice on the tongue. Very nicely drinkable."
"Drinks quite well for a stout - clean and ends up being nice and hearty."
"Served in a nonic. Poured two shades south of black with a half-inch foamy off-white head that lost half its volume in under a minute before coalescing into a ring around the perimeter. Some spotty strands, but lacing was essentially non-existent. Mild nose; some roasted character, malt and a hint of cocoa, but very bland. Flavors really failed to pop on this one. Consistent with nose, but very subdued. Mouthfeel was somewhat thin and watery with a light effervescence. Drinkability was fair. It went down easy and was pretty sessionable, but a little weak for the style."
"The body is moderate to light. Hard to pick out with the roast and sourness. Overall this was just off in so many ways. An udder un-delight."
"The abv is low so you can have a few.This isnt one of the better sweet stouts I have had.It sort of taste like my home brew."
"A good piece of a good sampler pack... butternuts is a great brewery."
"Pours a jet black with a smallish tan head. The smell is pungent with coffee,chocolate,and milk. The taste is strong with a creamy milk chocolate,coffee,and roasted malt,not bad but it is a little thin. The m/f is medium with the flavors mixing OK. Not a bad beer, but nothing really all that special either."
"D: Very drinkable as this one is not only very tastey, it isn't very high on the ABV scale to knock you over with just one beer."
"Poured from the can this is a very dark brown color that lets in pinkish-red highlights when held up to the light. The tan head is frothy and hangs around for a few minutes. Weird licorice like aroma. Super sweet malt. I also pick up some weird medicinal scent. The taste is not quite as sweet as the smell. Malty and musty. The feel is smooth but wayyy too light and watery. Moderately drinkable I suppose, but this is just weird for a milk stout."
"Drinkability is moderate. Flavors are decent, and I suspect the alcohol is low making this a pretty easily consumed beer."
"When poured into a Stoudt's pint glass, this canned beer is a midnight black with dark chestnut brown highlights at the bottom. The head of foam was a bit disappointing. The head of foam was only a small skim of tan colored foam that quickly dissipated into a handful of tan rings along the edge. It didn't bother to leave any lace behind. The aroma was coffee based with roasted coffee beans, fresh cut grass, a hint of milk chocolate, and a splash of lactose at the finish. The taste was lightly dry with roasted coffee beans, roasted malts, milk chocolate, a tiny touch of grass, and then it finished up with a hint of grassy hops and lactose. The mouthfeel was light to medium bodied with a dry aftertaste of roasted malts, bitter roasted coffee beans, and lactose. In the end, it was a nice little session roasted milk stout. Since it has plenty of flavor and the fact that it comes in a can, that helps the drinkability out a bit."
"Pours a pretty, dark brown, with chestnut highlights at the edges. Good sharpness to the aroma, which contains more than sweet malt notes -- there are also elements of roasted malt, hazelnuts, and crystallized sugar. On the palate, sweeter than expected, albeit with a definite hop kick up front. After that, things smooth out to a creamy sweetness later tinged with roasted barley. Mouthfeel is excellent -- the carbonation is perfect, malts smooth and roasts and hops sharp, but all in concert and balance. Very well done."
"D: Easy drinking. As was aforementioned, kinda like a """craft""" Guinness beer that falls slightly short on the mouthful. Not as bad as I was expecting given some of the earlier reviews. It's a decent beer. I wouldn't necessarily turn one down if there was a limited selection."
"Received in a """all can""" trade with JoeyBeerBelly. Served in an Imperial Pint Glass. Vigorous pour reveals a coffee brown beer with ruby highlights and a 1 finger head of creamy, tan colored foam with decent retention and a minimal amount of lacing. Smell is not very prominent, but reveals scents of dark roasted malt with hints of raisins and chocolate. Taste is a similar combination of roasted malt mixed with coffee and chocolate and an underlying milky sweetness. Feel is slightly thin, but still rather creamy with a decent level of carbonation for the style. Somewhat watery overall. Drinkability on this is good. The combination of flavors, while not stand-outish, still provides a nice, easy-to-drink stout. That being said, it's probably a little less full-bodied than I would look for in a milk/sweet stout."
"The drinkability is very nice on this beer. It is a sweeter stout, much like a Murphy's, but with the strong chocolate taste it is good for maybe one or two."
"Not bad..."
"I like, but don't love, the Butternuts lineup and this one is no different. It's good but not great but is certainly something I'd drink again."
"Drinkability: Being a fan of a good sweet stout, I enjoy this beer. The low ABV and low carbonation make this a nice beer to have several of if you desire. Worth a try."
"Drinkability- Well the beer looked horrible but I got a air of hope after the nose. The taste is not bad or good; it's non existent. It's basically just really watered down coffee. Not very good but glad I got the opportunity to try this little guy."
"Black with noticeable lighter mouthfeel, lots of white dots lacing.Smells malty. Carbonation is on the aggressive side, less than medium mouthfeel. Some coffee grounds light chocolate and cola-like. Drinkable as on the sweet side. Lactose aftertaste."
"$8.50/6-pack in Wellesley, MA - ouch."
"Pours a very dark brown color with an average head that left a slight tan ring around the glass. The smell is of fairly strong aroma of milk chocolate and roasted coffee, very mocha like. The taste is primarily of milk and semi-sweet chocolate with a bittering roasted malt backbone with some light metallic notes in the end. The feel is moderate with soft carbonation lending to a creamy texture, finishes on the bitter side and a tad astringent. Overall a decent stout with a good flavor profile, perhaps a tad bitter."
"D- I really think this is a nice solid stout... and its in a can!"
"One word really describes this beer... WOW! I've never tasted anything this good out of a can. Not the best stout I've ever had but fairly good for a milk stout (expecially out of a can?!)."
"I got a finger's worth of deep tan/light brown head as the result of my pour. The nose was chocolaty, definitely sweet, with underlying notes of anise. The color was a deep, dark brown with ruby highlights. The mouthfeel was medium with a taste like a chocolate milkshake or better yet, chocolate syrup, given its slight graininess on the tongue. The finish struck me as being both a bit watery as well as weak on the chocolate flavor. It seemed as though it needed a little more oomph. It was not a bad beer, but I would stick with Butternuts' Hefe, instead."
"Drinkability: decent if you have the need to have canned beers where glass isn't acceptable. Worth a try."
"Nothing really wrong here, not particularly interesting either though. Similar to current Guinness."
"Pours a very dark brown, when held to light gives off burgundy hues. Minimal head which recedes rather quickly. Aroma is roasty, dark chocolate, coffe. Good smell, but like their other beer I tried earlier, it is pretty subdued. Taste is seems like it is going to be extremely roasty and great immediately upon hitting the palette but then disappears into a watered down mouthfeel and an off flavor. Then the finish brings back some roasty, dark chocolate notes. Rather strange. Watery mouthfeel, not much carbonation, semi dry finish. This is one of the thinnest and slightly strangest stouts Ive ever had."
"D: Very drinkable stout. The lack of a thick body makes it a session stout."
"D: Went down very easily. I could imagine substituting this for Guinness as a sessionable lighter stout, though I imagine that after a few I may get tired of the sweetness just a bit."
"Pours a solid black with a thinnish head that dissipates quickly and leaves minimal lace. Smells of roasted coffee, caramel, butterscotch and a hint of chocolate. Any bitterness in the aroma seems to come from roasted grains. Taste is roasted coffee and chocolate mixed with a bit of caramel and mineral water. Slightly tart sweetness in the middle. Long lingering roasted grain and licorice in the finish. Medium body and carbonation level. This is still a great little stout. I think I liked it better this time though."
"This beer poured a dark chocolate color with a half-finger tan head. It has a sweet smell of roasted malts and some coffee and chocolate notes. The taste is robust and starts off with roasted malts and ends with some pretty big coffee notes and little bit of bitterness. The mouthfeel is full and thick. The beer is fairly imposing and I couldn't imagine drinking more than one or two at a time."
"Thanks to shaebs99 for the chance to try this."
"This is a pretty tasty beer. The sweet espresso/coffee bean flavor really comes through, as well as sweet cream and a subtle smokiness. This beer may be a stout, but it's honestly rather thin, which helps its drinkability a bit. Out of all the sweet stouts from a can I've had (ok ok, this is my first), this was the most enjoyable. Worth a try."
"Very easy to drink. A by-the-book example of the style."
"Pours a dark brown that lets light through. No head. Nose is roasted malts. Flavor is a completely odd and not appropriate mix of smoked malts and roasted malts. I already know I will not be finishing this. Feel has a decent carbonation and a liquid feel that is too thin. If you see this one, just pass. Borders on a disaster of a stout, IMO."
"12 ounce can, pours near black, with light shining through at the edges, nice looking fine head, film and then plenty of splotchy delicate lace. Roasty nose with hints of licorice, and smoldering malts. Nice easy drinking, medium bodied stout. Plenty of well crafted dark malt notes. Sweetish finish, like a mocha cafe au lait with a 1/2 spoonful of sugar. Gotta love a quality stout in a F'n can! I'm suprised by the low scores fo this one, c'mon folks this stuff is well crafted, easy drinking and quite tasty..."
"I havent been overll impressed as of yet with the Butternuts line of beer I would say the hefeweizen has been the best thus far.This poured into a standard pint glass deep and dark but not ink black it has a bit of ruby colored hue to it a thin tannish colored head is gone quickly leaving no lace,mild chocolate aromas along with some molasses and dark roast coffee.Pretty thin borderline watery but not quite mouthfeel,mild roastiness and bitter chocolate flavors I think its saving grace is a raw earthy finish keeping it somewhat balanced.Pretty low in alcohol no doubt wich is true to style but it lacks alot."
"Dark, delicious, and decidedly drinkable, Moo Thunder is sure to please. A thin cap of tan rises oover its dark body as you pour it. The head retention and lacing could be better, but it does leaves some spotty lace in its wake. The aroma offers sweet dark chocolate with a hint of juicy red fruit in the background. In the mouth it's velvety-smooth with a medium-light body and restrained carbonation. The flavor offers mainly sweet dark chocolate up front before revealing its underlying yeasty fruitiness. Some nougat character comes through across the middle, and it finishes with some mild black coffee that fades gently away, leaving behind some residual notes of light caramel, nuttiness, some mild bitterness, and a touch of spent grassy hops. It's a light, easy-drinking stout, and the dark malt acidity and bitterness are well heeled. Quite drinkable!"
"D_Pretty good brew, easily drinkable but nothing out of the ordinary. This can make for a good session stout that does not overwhelm your taste buds like a stronger stout. A lot of BAs might not like it for just this reason, but it works for me."
"Light in body - silky smooth, crisp and a bit thin. Would like just a bit more body. So easy to drink. Not going to blow you away, but a tasty, easy-drinking milk stout."
"D: Fine, easy to drink, but doesn't leave me wanting another one."
"Just getting around to review this brew, have had a number since the release a few months ago. This brew pours to a deep brown color, guess hedging on black. Small medium colored tan head that did not have much in the way of legs and hardly left any lacing. The aroma is pretty nice, but simple. Chocolate, caramel and roasted grains come to mind. The taste also is pretty good but seems to have a feel of being watered down. Mostly roasted malt flavor with a little charcoal feel besides that not much else there. I was hoping for so much more in this brew, while it is not bad, it clearly is not very good. Hard pressed to get this again. Actually glad I finally got through them all, just taking up space."
"Sweet and creamy this beer certainly is. It's smooth and pleasant, but also thin and lacking substance. It's not a very stout stout. It won't warm your bones on a cold winter's night. The malt taste comes through as bready with a very slight roasted character. And there's sugar too...the brew has a cranked up sweetness, almost like you'd expect from an iced tea or soda; as a result, the aftertaste lingers long on the tongue."
"Pours a clear dark red, not even brown. Stout? I think not! Almost pours flat, tiny bit of tan head forms, disappears immediately, bit of a ring around the glass. Smell is sweet, bit of garbage, light roast, bit of chocolate, caramel milkiness, watery, not so good. Taste is not good, very watery, light caramel, bit of chocolate and roast, sweet caramel, sugar, weird. Mouthfeel is very thin and watery, medium carbonation. This is no stout! But I guess I should have expected as much."
"Tasty, but a little too sweet and bland. The aroma has a very mellow cream and cocoa smell with a bit of roasted malt. The flavor is more of the same but with an overriding sugary sweetness that seems to mask the flavor. Seems like a blander version of the Sam Adams Cream Stout. Not a bad beer, just a little light in flavor for the style I guess."
"A bland Sweet Stout with some flaws. Not unpleasant, but nothing that puts the Moo Cow Thunder beyond average."
"Nice to see a canned stout, but Butternuts should probably tweak the recipe."
"The beer pours a black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a light roasted malt scent along with a weak crystal malt aroma. The aroma is weak with little character. The taste is average. It has a smooth black and roasted malt flavor. It seems weak and watery with quite a dry finish. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a weak session stout. It's got roasted malt character, but nothing else. It needs some more substance. Overall, a pretty average stout."
"For the style this works out pretty well. Milk stout isn't my favorite style as I tend to prefer my stouts heavy duty when I crave one... but I could see this making its way into my rotation. If milk stouts are your thing, try this on for size. See if it fits."
"the can thing makes it cool."
"Overall an easy to drink stout, but it lacked any real complexity."
"Drinkability: Would be better if it weren't $6 a glass. Cool experience though."
