"Chocolate it certainly is, good tasting beer for when you have a sweet tooth, not to sweet though. Some might compare it to chocolate milk, I am not to sure about that. But it does make a good beer for a mixer."

"I don't really NEED chocolate in my beer, but I have to admit, this was pretty enjoyable."

"Excellent beer, very well balanced, great taste, can't complain about anything always have this in the fridge"

"Explosive upon opening. Best to open standing straight up. Might be too sweet for some. Has a bubbly head but not what I expected for a stout. Still..... It's just a visual issue. Sometimes hard to pair with food. Better as a dessert beer."
""
"was excited to try this one due to previous reviews. however was quite a bit sweeter then i was expecting and didnt have the body that i usually look for in a stout"
"Overall, my favorite craft beer. This is something I would show up to a friend's house with on game night so that they drink one and quit so that I can save the rest for myself. If you're not crazy about chocolate you might want to skip this one. If you are crazy about chocolate however, and happen to also love beer, this is an awesome brew. Just drink it slowly."

"Got this in a sampler pack with the India Ale and Oatmeal Stout.  Wouldn't have bought it on my own as I'm not much of a stout drinker.  As printed on the bottle... smooth chocolate flavor, not very bitter.  If that's your thing then it's a great beer.  Just OK for me."

"This is an excellent chocolate stout.  Imagine boiling down chocolate chips and inhaling a big whiff of chocolate goodness - it is similar to the smell of SSOCS, with a hint of malt tossed in for good measure.  The dark brown brew has a modest head that shrinks to a ring of small bubbles around the outside of my glass that remaining throughout the beer.  The taste is lead by chocolate, and although it is excellent, there is a hint of something being off - a fake quality, but I am being very picky.  Mouthfeel is Smooth and silky.  An outstanding beer."

"like carbonated chocolate milk, don't know if it would work as a desert beer on its own due to the over-carbonation but this paired phenomenally with alden's chocolate, chocolate chip ice cream."
"Amazing!!! My new favorite beer. I definitely recommend this beer."
""
""
"This is the best chocolate stout I have ever tasted. Love it"
""
"Overall - a very good world-class beer, but a tad too sweet for my palate to consider it one of my all-time bests."
""
"Good beer, poured in a pint and let it rest for a while. Tastes great, good for dessert. Great for a day after work"
""
""
""
"While I'm not much of a stout fan, I can't help but love this beer.  Very light and easy mouthfeel;  not as heavy and dry as some stouts, and makes  for a great desert as much as it does a breakfast addition."

"Overall I thought this was a good beer and good example of the style. it had everything that I look for in a Chocolate Stout and while it wasn't the most balanced I thought those nice chocolate aspects made up for it.  This beer had good drinkability, it was very smooth, rich, a little crisp, slightly creamy, not too filling and the taste did a nice job of holding my attention, I think I could drink a couple of these and it would be a nice beer to enjoy during the cold weather.  What I like the most about this beer is the chocolate aspect, it's very nice and it's just what I want in a chocolate stout.  What I like the least about this beer was the sweetness, it wasn't bad, but it was just a little on the sweet side for me.  I would buy this beer again when in the mood for a chocolate stout and I would recommend it to anyone who likes the style.  All in all I liked this beer, it isn't something that I could drink all the time, but it's nice for when I want my chocolate fix.  It's now my favorite beer from this brewery and it's one of the best chocolate stouts I've had.  Good job guys, this is one tasty beer, keep it up."

"Smooth sweet taste. No bitterness at all. It's just liquid goodness!"
"Poured from the pint 2.7 oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours a dark brown, opaque up to the light, the head is about two fingers of khaki foam, minimal lacing. Aroma is of dark Malts, milk chocolate (yes milk), biscuit, and a hint of fruit (maybe cherry?). Taste is very similar to the aroma, milk chocolate with a hint of malty/ biscuity taste at the end, nearly too sweet for my liking. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for a stout, evspdcially a chocolate stout. Overall decent, not something I'd go out of my way to get again, as say a southern tier mokah. 4/5"

"O - One of the best chocolate beers I've ever tasted.  Can't believe I waited this long."
"This is an excellent beer and another winner from Sam Smith 's.  Reasonably priced at only 3-something for the bottle."

"Wow,,,,very nice.  The scent and taste scream milk chocolate.  The muthfeel is a bit lacking as it would be nice if it were a bit more creamy.  The color is opaque with offwhite head that is lacing.  Overall.....very nice."

"Tadcaster does it again.. is what i thought as i slowly sipped this incredible beer."
"Amazing. If you like chocolate stouts or anything to do with chocolate and beer, please, at least do me the favor, and seek this one out. Absolutely amazing. Smells like you were stuffing your nose in cocoa and tastes just like the smell only better. It's 5% so it won't knock you off your rocker but it'll go down easy and you'll want more. Get it if you see it, don't tthink twice."
"I was really excited for this one, but it somehow left me questioning if chocolate and beer were meant to be together."

"Poured from a 550ml bottle (18.7oz) into a brandy sniffer.  Pours a dark deep chocolate brown with 2 full fingers of tan mocha head.  Delicious notes of rich chocolate override aroma of roasted malts and light/weak coffee.  Toffee maybe,  caramelized sugar.  Light and not as thick or creamy in the mouth as you would like.  Thin actually.  Tastes much like it smells with the overriding taste being chocolate.  Milk chocolate.  The other flavors are buried underneath.  They fight the chocolate but fail.  Low abv.  Very drinkable.  After taste is chocolate with roasted malts and a hint of hops and malts.  Very smooth.  Delightful."
"Wow! That's it in a nutshell. Jet black in low light, the glass shows dark ruby brown clarity when held up to a brighter illumination. An egg cream like head of prodigious proportions rises up majestically leaving thick layers of lace after a flow fade. As I drink the glass shows  streaks and spots, the brew has a light covering that stays. Nose is bordering on criminally chocolate, a perfect melding of stout and and cacao. It has a lovely sweetness that makes you think the cup should have steam rising up and a marshmallow melting down inside. The taste follows suit. Luscious chocolate slathered on top of a lightly roasty glass of sweet stout. Mild earthy finish leaves more chocolate and some traditional Samuel Smith yeast and water flavors. Light stout graininess lingering giving a dark sweet roll laced with cocoa. A full velvety creaminess that envelopes the mouth has you sipping and savoring and back again as soon as you can bear. It goes too fast, but luckily it's only five percent. if you like Southern Tier Choklat but wish for a more sessionable brew your ship has come in. One of the best beers of the year so far for me"

"...I don't get it. A score of 94 and this might be the worst beer I've ever tasted. It's like they threw in random amounts of chocolate, cocoa, malt, sugar, spice and everything nice and just went with it. More power to them if so many people like it, but... my experience with this was horrible. I drain-poured it after two ounces or so."

"Best chocolate stout! A must try."
"I never give out a 5 for taste but, thid is literally the best chocolate stout I have ever had. Totally recomend it. I only wish it had a higher alch% to pick a con."

"O - I'm reviewing this as a sweet stout.  Far too sweet for any other style, but very good for what it is.  Excellent dessert beer."

"classic beer,  overall a very good beer"
""

"O:  Great beer."
"Tasted okay but was had a thin feel when I drank.  This is the second organic I've tried that had a similar thin feel."
""
""
"Look- opaque. No light gets thru this baby. Tan head quickly dissipates and then rings around the glass. I love a large, frothy head, especially on my stouts and that is the only disappointment here. Smell- awesome. High quality dark chocolate with a hint of cream. No hops here. Taste- great. You get some nice dark chocolate with a roasted malt character. I love this style and this is one of the better tasting. Chocolate lovers dream. Low Abv keeps this nice and drinkable. Mouthfeel- luscious and creamy. A slight carbonation at the end. Sip and enjoy this fine import!"

"Overwhelming artificial dark chocolate. Extremely sweet."
"Both this is a beer drinker that loves chocolate dream this would not be an every day stout but if you have a sweet tooth crack one open you'll be sad when  you realize you have none left"
""
"This beer tastes delicious, with that in mind it does not have a lot of real beer bite to it.  It would be perfect with a stronger stout flavor."
""
""
""
""
"It's surprising how much this beer tastes like chocolate milk and not beer. It's delicious, but I would like more of a stout flavor and a higher ABV."
""
""
"O- Pretty damn awesome beer that is exactly what I expected it to be. A great beer for the chocolate lovers out there."

"This is as close to chocolate milk as beer should ever be, in the best way possible."
""
""
"does not taste like beer, its kind of a dessert. I feel myself getting fat just drinking it."
""
""
""

"Very good rather have a milk stout"
"O - Excellent chocolate stout, awesome desert beer. The closest thing to chocolate milk in beer form that i have experienced. Super well balanced with a bit of sweetness and next to no bitterness or an overpowering cocoa flavor."

"Overall: Im not even a fan of gimmicky chocolate stouts but this is one done right. You can tell its organic just by smelling and tasting it, none of that artificial flavoring some breweries are guilty of. This is definitely a beer I'd recommend to people who dont even like beer. In fact, my brother who isnt in to beer but takes sips of mine, tasted this and immediately said its his favorite beer to date. Its the perfect dessert beer, and imagine it going perfectly with chocolate truffels or something. This is what i will judge all chocolate beers by from now on."
