The color is dark brown with little to no head. The smell is all malt with a little bit of coffee coming from underneath. The taste is dark chocolate, but you instantly get over the sweetness and find the cream and the earthy oatmeal mingling with the hops and malt. A little thin, but the flavors are so good that I thought it makes a good summer stout as well.","WhiteHillsStore","May 07, 2014"

APPEARANCE: jet black body; unenthused thin brown head; tracings are basically sporadic bubbles... AROMA: some peat and smoke, but predominantly a strange combination: lactic, doughy malts and vanilla sugars argue with strikingly astringent turpentine chemicals--a challenge to take in... PALATE: medium-bodied, slightly dry; rather flat up front, with a beefy after breath ...TASTE: milky, yet the alcohol seems to impede a smoother flavor; some rum elements mingle with a plasticine undertone... OVERALL: This seems a forced attempt at steeping ABV at the cost of taste and experience; River Horse does Jersey proud with some offerings, but this brew is negatively aggressive--upon completing this review, I drank a second and only found the beer more troublesome to place in a positive light....","dacrza1","Feb 04, 2014"

I was faced with two fingers of dense, deep-tan head that resembled a chocolate milkshake before I backed off. This was going to be a Carly Simon beer - anticipation, it's making me wait. Once it finally dropped to a manageable level, leaving some decent lacing in its wake, I was ready. Color was a deep, dark cola-brown that allowed zero light penetration. Nose was quite chocolaty, but with a hint of smoke, more towards dark chocolate than milk chocolate. On that note, let us address their untruth in advertising - the ""milk"" is derived from their use of lactose sugar in the brewing process and the oatmeal is used to cut some of the ""burnt"" flavor that early versions took from the extremely roasted malts, not to add the flavor of cookies. Mouthfeel was big, thick and silky and the taste was more like sweet chocolate than the nose had led me to expect, so apparently their use of oatmeal worked. Finish was more towards milk chocolate and it was certainly sweet, so I have to give it to them in terms of style. I just wish that their label was more direct and less misleading.","woodychandler","Jun 01, 2013"

Aroma of deep roasted malts, light smoke and nice chocolate notes start to come through right away. Smooth, even and as it warm relatively unchanged. Light vanilla in here now as I take the first sip. A bit slick, I was expecting a bit fuller feel to it, but the taste still came across nicely. Smokey with nice notes of peat and burnt sugar mixing with a light chocolate and creamy lactose flavor. Nicely done. Each sip seem to get more and more smokey, which was a nice touch and the finish was just dry enough and left just enough sweetness on the tongue to leave me very pleased.","mikesgroove","Mar 09, 2011"

Mouthfeel is good here too, pretty creamy but at the same time the carbonation and fizzyness throws the stout character off, sweet oat flavor is left on the tongue as a good after taste.

4.2,6.3,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Pitch black with ruby highlights. An inch of sticky brown foam. Nose is coffee and molasses, dark fruit and quite malty. Flavour is balanced sweetness and bitterness. Lots of toasted grain and some hops in the back end as well. Some big fruit and caramel shore up the middle. Smooth body and medium carbonation. Very drinkable and amply tasty.","allergictomacros","Jul 15, 2009"

4.27,8.1,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Flavor delivers a well-balanced mix of toasted chocolate & coffee malts, vanilla oats, and lactose.

3.5,-11.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D: only slightly above average here. Way overcarbonated, lacked a real milky and cremay nature and cant say this was particular good when compared to such staples as Youngs, or even Sam Adams and Lancasters milk stout which I found to be exceptional. Much better out there by style. This was also a little on the high side abv wise which would limit multiples.","beerthulhu","Mar 19, 2009"
4.03,2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a deep, dark black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a really nice black, chocolate, and roasted malt scent along with a hint of lactose. The taste is good. It has a sharp, roasted flavor that boasts of black and chocolate malts. It goes down easy and finishes dry with the slightest bit of sweetness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine sweet stout. It has excellent malt complexity and isn't overly sweet; just right.","WesWes","Mar 17, 2009"

4.45,12.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4,"UPDATE: I've since tried Sierra Nevada Stout, and have to say it's very similar to the Oatmeal Milk Stout. If anyone is having a hard time finding the River Horse variant, the Sierra Nevada shouldn't be difficult to track down, and will give you a very good idea of what to expect. Think of the River Horse as a slightly thicker, slightly maltier, and less bitter version of the Sierra Nevada.","JJBlanche","Beers"

Roasty toasty goodness emanates from the nose, big burnt coffee malt notes, a lingering funk and a slight pungent bitterness. Semi-sweet, roasted chocolate malt attacks first, directly followed by a very bitter coffee bean flavor, orange peel and a floral grassyness on the finish. Smooth, oily slick and slightly creamy with a light/medium body that is just crazy drinkable. Really liking the changes im tasting, keep up the good work River Horse.","ATPete","Jan 03, 2009"
3.98,0.8,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"This is the best bottled River Horse beers so far. They are making some changes over there and this Milk Stout proves it.

I know I've knocked their regular lineup in the past as being mediocre, but the seasonals have been breathing some life back into the brewery and the new (-ish) Brewer's Reserve Series has been doing an even better job cranking out inspired, well made brews.
