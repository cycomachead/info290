Pitch black body with a very minimal brownish head that was gone in an instant. Def. what a stout should look like in my opinion. Smelled of cocoa, molasses, a hint of coffee coming thorough from the dark malts (with a bit of agitation). Very coffee-forward taste (which might explain my wife's obsession), and some nice deep dark malts. Just enough bitterness to offset. Rich and creamy mouthfeel, and low level of carbonation that kept it from being to viscous. Very excited that I will be able to grab one of these out of the fridge every once in a while when she isn't looking. Nice stout.","Mikus","Jun 28, 2014"

3.73,-2.1,4,3.5,3.75,4,3.75,"Pours a very dark brown that is a few shades lighter than black, fairly opaque it doesn't allow much light through but does throw some highlights on the edges. The head is about a finger thick, light tan bubbles that fall to a thin layer in some time. The smell is a touch of roasted malt combined with lactose sugary sweetness and dark caramels or light chocolates. The taste is similar to the smell as the lactose sweetness leads the way bolstered by the chocolate notes and finished with a touch of roasted malt bitterness. Hop aroma and flavor is nearly nonexistent, there may be just a touch of bitterness coming from hops with the bulk from the malt. Trends a bit towards the sweet side, especially up front while the body is incredibly creamy and smooth both due to the lactose and a high level of fine bubbled carbonation. Overall a good stout, I'm not the biggest fan of the style so personally I"""m not thrilled by this beer but would say that it is well done and should be liked by fans of milk stouts.","fank2788","Jun 28, 2014"

Sweet cream flavor up front with roasted malt beneath that intensifies through the middle.

4.21,10.5,4.25,4.5,4,4.25,4.25,"Finger plus of uneven, frothy foam, lots of larger bubbles to mottle the surface but good head retention and covers the surface for some time, the lacing is thin on the whole but sticks well. Very dark brown colored liquid, not quite black, opaque nonetheless, no filminess, you don’t seem the bubbles until they break the yellow tinted surface. Forceful but not heavy nose driven by chocolate powder, mocha and just a strong general maltiness, blends in anise, vanilla and a little whiskey like booziness, vague plum fruit, the breadiness is akin to scones or raw oatmeal, not devoid of hops but no single descriptor jumps out at you about this part. Medium-bodied, neither too dry nor too sweet, just full of malty goodness, chocolate, caramel, cocoa, vanilla, licorice, brown sugar, needs to warm up to get any coffee grounds. It isn’t that milky though. The carbonation is tight so it isn’t too fluffy and it is about as crisp as you’d want without it getting too dry. Here the hops lend a mild bitter touch at the end with citrus and a hint of pine more than grassiness, maybe even peppery. The thing is, it’s subtle in all the good ways, making it an enjoyably sessionable beer rather than lunging for the “wow” factor.","farrago","Nov 17, 2013"

There’s not much in the aroma, save for a little maltiness and some sweet lactose. The beer is quite sweet with bitter malts and bittersweet chocolate as well. It has a very nice roasty flavor that pairs well with the sweetness from the lactose. The best part is it’s mouthfeel - nice and thick on the palate, deliciously creamy and smooth. At the end the hops become more evident and they complement the sweetness with a nice bitterness. There’s not a lot of depth or “oomph” in the flavors, but it’s a very drinkable milk stout.","greenmtn1111","Aug 13, 2013"

4.07,6.8,4.25,4,4,4.5,4,"Poured into an Elysian snifter. Pours pitch black with a fine one finger light brown head with awesome retention and lacing. Aroma dominated by chocolate with mellow roasted malt; sweet. Flavor is chocolate, nuts, mild roasted malt. This is sweet and viscous, very reminiscent of a stout with whipped cream added; there is a detectable whipped cream element to the flavor. Nice medium to heavy, creamy body with a mouth feel that wouldn't be out of place from a nitro pour, although this is fron a bottle. A very nice mildly sweet stout. In my opinion, Southern Tier is the master of sweet stouts and this is another winner in their line up. A must for those who like the sweet stout style.","LiquidAmber","0"

A good blend of sweet from the fermented lactose and bitterness from the dark chocolate and roasted coffee. A dark roasted malt taste with a good amount of hops to it. I would say better if warmed to room temperature and served as a sipping stout. A very pleasant beer to drink. Real smooth hops with medium carbonation.

This beer has a strong malty sweet character with an underplayed hoppiness that accentuates toward the end. The characteristics of the sweetness and hopiness are characteristic of this style. But the sweetness may be overplayed. The carbonation was at a medium level, and the body was full -- almost syrupy.

Popping the top I get nice roasted malts and a definite heavier ABV than your average stout. Some licorice and somehow a hint of cinnamon. Pours into my trusty SA perfect pint like a chocolate milkshake, thick and heavy classic motor oil. Nice tan head with multi-sized bubble groupings. Taste is large and in charge with a very sweet roasted malt with some toffee up front and a slight bitter middle, still under the sweetness then a sweet and chaulky bitter fade at the end into a pleasant charred dry bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy a good assest with the flavor. Sweeter than I expected but it is a milk stout so it is actually spot on. A very tasty brew. I recommend.","mooseisloose","0"

Pleasant roasted notes greet the nose, sweet bittersweet cocoa power as well. Opens with roasted malt some dark chocolate that transisitons to milk chocolate as the sweet lactose sugar joins in creating a semi-sweet chocolate milk notes.

The aroma is a pleasant malt coffee bean bite with some nutty nuances. Not very strong but very solid. The flavor is a no nonsense green malt and bitter coffee with a sweet pear/vegetable hint. Really nice, in a medium-plus bodied brew with very little evidence of carbonation and a silky feel. A classic milk stout that goes down easily!

The beer is very dark and opaque but a couple of bubbles can be seen clinging to the sides of the glass and there are plenty of bubbles peppering the surface to showcase a solid amount of carbonation. The beer smells sweet and roasty with the sour lactose sugars enveloping everything in their odd candied embrace. Malts are rich and creamy with chocolate and roasted flavoring. The beer tastes rich with burnt coffee and slight chocolate tinge. There is a faint sour from the lactose sugars that plays nicely with the coffee flavor and an alcoholic pucker that resonates in the aftertaste as the coffee and roasted flavors die down. Mouthfeel is smooth and a little thin for the style. It leaves the mouth with a ghost of saliva and a very slight roasted dryness to the tongue. Overall this is a solid milk stout with nice coffee taste that does not show up in the nose. This beer is worthy of a taste.","Maxwell","Aug 26, 2012"

Some decent pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, caramel, cream, and toast on the finish for a bit.

This beer had good drinkability, it went down pretty smooth and the flavors kept me interested, I could drink a couple of these but after that I think the sweetness would wear on me. What I liked most about this beer was how true to style it was, it was everything that I expect from the style and it looked damn good in my pint glass. What I liked least about this beer was nothing, there wasn't anything that I felt was out of place with this beer. I would buy this beer again, it was priced right and was just what I want in a Milk Stout, I will be buying this again when in the mood for the style and I highly recommend giving this beer a try if Milk Stouts are your thing. This turned out to be a good and really solid Milk Stout, I don't think of this as a double Milk Stout, to me it's just a good example of the style and not a double version of this style. I didn't like their Porter too much, but these 2X beers have impressed me, I am sad to see there are no more beers in this series, it would be nice to see a 2X Red Ale or a 2x Pilsener. Good job Southern Tier, I will be on the look out for more of your beers and I would love to try the barrel aged version of this beer one day.","StoutHunter","Jun 20, 2012"

4.08,7.1,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"This is a stout. If that sounds like an understatement, let it be known: this is a stunning milk stout. Southern Tier continues to impress me. By far, it is one of the few breweries I have seen that tries to push boundaries in terms of flavors, profiles, and concepts with their brews. Their 2X milk stout is no different. I poured it from the bottle and let it invite itself humbly into my glass. As a friend of mine would say, it is a quiet drink. It's thickness became easily apparent to me based on its silent pour. It is remarkably opaque with just the slightest twinges of mahogany around the edges of the glass. The head of the beer is a sultry cream color with a tint of a caramelized sugar hue. It even smells amazingly creamy, with enormous waves of malts churning dark murmurs of milky chocolate froth upon themselves. The taste is a sweet savor on the tip of my tongue. There is just the slightest flavor of a light coffee roast-- perhaps of the Colombian variety. The taste is clear though: big roasty, creamy malts. But wait, I do believe I capture a brief snap of a hop presence at the very end of the finish. Now, that is impressive. Considering that this is a milk stout, it coats the mouth pleasantly, but briefly. My recommendation: enjoy this on a cool summer night, with the music of your choice and feel its comforting, yet seductive embrace. Cheers to Southern Tier for another great beer.","JChristopher","May 21, 2012"

All told, a little sweeter than it needs to be with the caramel/sugar notes dominating the lactose flavor, that's also present. A very smooth roasted malt flavor is present, lending a mild bitterness in an attempt to balance the sweetness. Lactose lingers on the finish, leaving sweetness, a little bitterness and some coffee. Medium in body with a moderate carbonation, this feels quite nice on the palate. Ultimately, it could use a little bit more roasted malt flavor to balance the sweetness.

4.12,8.1,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Poured into an overshaped chalice, I get deep dark abyss absorbs all visible light in the body. Big mocha tan head forms thick like a barista just made me something special with extra froth. Fine even lacing between sips pretty nice looking effort from upstate NY. Arom I get dusted cocoa, creamy milk chocolate candy offerings, with some dry roasted malt notes. Flavor is super sweet coats the sides of the palate rushes you with a sweet chocolate syrup notes, enough dark roasted malt character to balance it out to keep it from becoming sickeningly sweet. Dark chocolate dry finish with a hint of creamed coffee, herbal hops barely linger in there. Mouthfeel is medium to fuller bodied definitely sweet to round out the palate but it's not cloying in anyway. Overall it's a 12 ounce offering from Southern Tier that represents something different than their mainstream diabetes inducing blackwater series which started out amazing as a beer called IS that to this day stands out as an amazing Imperial Stout that they've never recaptured since the first year I tried that beer. This is a step in the right direction away from Creme Brulee, Choklat, Jahva, and Mocha.","WVbeergeek","Jan 21, 2012"

3.85,1,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Capping the day off with a new brew to the area. It pours a dark black-brown topped by a finger of sandy tan foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, cocoa, vanilla bean, and the lightest possible touch of molasses. Everything's kinda laid back, not wanting self-expression to get anywhere close to out-of-hand. The taste brings in more of the same, with some darker roast, some sweeter cocoa, some bitter dark chocolate for the sake of it, a touch more vanilla bean, and a stronger (though still relatively subdued) vein of molasses. Right on. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly dry finish. Overall, a nice little cream stout, something I could actually see as a go-to milk stout (along with Left Hand and Young's). Good times.","TMoney2591","Jan 20, 2012"
