"Delicious and great aroma.  Must have beer.  Should be on your want list."

"Phenomenal flavors, nice body, delicious."

"The first time I tried this beer I nearly cried tears of joy.  Simply the best milk stout I've had to date.  It had the smoothest feel and the taste was incredible.  I prefer this version to their nitro version which is also a good beer.  If you're a fan of milk stouts and want one that will rock your socks off, this is a stout that you must try."
"Simply amazing!  The only thing better is the same thing in Nitro :-). Left Hand Milk Stout Nitro is the greatest stout I have ever tasted, nuff said!"
""
"One of my favorites, great taste,"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Smooth as silk. Nice complex flavors and not overly burnt."

"Malty, milky, not too sweet. A solid but unspectacular brew. Would definitely buy again, but wouldn't go out of my way to acquire."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours with a small, light brown head. Is black in color. The aroma of roasted malts is in abundance with a hint of chocolate. The initial taste is of roasted malts, chocolate, and milk. Hops finish the taste with the roasted malts continuing until the end. A truly amazing beer."
""
""
"THEE milk stout if you ask me"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is my all time fave!"
""
"The beer that made me open up to a new world of beers, will always love this one"
""
"Absolutely superb milk stout by Left Hand. Rich, balanced and creamy with malt and cocoa notes. A very mildly sweet finish.  Heavy bodied with some moderate lacing. Virtually no foam which is about my only disappointment.  Extremely drinkable."
""
""
""

""
"on tap at The Whiskey Room in Burlington, VT"
""
"Best craft milk stout I've ever had. Blows duck rabbit out of the water"
""
"on tap at Mellow Mushroom"
""
""
""
"I love this stuff and can't get enough of it. I'm lucky enough to know someone who works at Left Hand and have been to the brewery to sample all of their beers. But the Milk Stout is by far my favorite."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"While I hoping to get more out of this for a stout, it is a solid beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"It is a very average beer. It isn't bad, it just isn't that memorable either."
""
"This beer was very good but not as good as the other left hand stout. This one was a little bitter."
"Not my style of beer but good. Espresso notes, finished clean and lingered on the pallet nice. Not bad but not my style."
""
""
""
""
"Kind of watery compared to other stouts. Smell and look is very similar to most stouts out there on the market. Tastes sweeter than most stouts, but I kinda wish it wasn't as watery. I feel if it was a tad bit thicker the sweetness would have worked better"
""
""
""
"The nitro version is far, far better, but this is pretty good too."
"Was everything I look for in a beer. Thought the smell didn't do it justice but I don't like beer because of the way it smells. Perfect for my tastes. Will definitely bug them to get it to WV."
"Simply Dark and delicious. American stout."
"Poured hard as usually instructed by Left Hand milk stouts to a two finger dark tan head. Color is a deep black with decent lacing. The taste of coffee and malt were through out. The low carbonation and sweet lactose made for a really smooth feel. One of the better milk stouts, but not as good as their Milk Stout - Nitro."
"Nitro bottle. This thing could not be smoother. Black pour with thin creamy brown top. Aromas of so much roasted. Flavor is quite sweet. Delicious."
""
""
""
"Just a delicious, somewhat sweet beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very good... Nitro is better"
"Creamy, Rush of flavor milk and vanilla, but lack of nose and disappearing finish was disappointing. Great beer, just held my hopes a little to high."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Much nicer as it warms up. I tried it from the bottle after a long cold ride home. Flavors did not present themselves till it warmed up after pouring into a tulip glass. Pours very dark as it should but with a thin head and light lacing. syrupy but a bit on thin side for the mouth feel with very light carbonation.  Strong on sugar and light malt scent and flavor but not enough notes present on the tongue to make it really interesting. A little too sweet for my tastes. Needs a little more complexity to balance it out. Overall an excellent brew to introduce novices who are afraid of the dark. Die hard stout vets may find it wanting a bit. Definitely better as it warms though."
""
""
""
""
"Little bit sweeter,less burnt flavor than a Guiness. Though it has a creamy taste, it didn't have the creamy head like a Guiness - that kinda bummed me out. Perhaps I should've poured it """harder""" into the glass? I'm curious as to the difference with the Nitro version. Anyhow, I will definitely be buying this again."
"The cap says """pour hard""" i don't know what that means. There was maybe a quarter inch of creamy foam, and it was dark as expected. The taste was well balanced, but just generally not very intense. They call it """America's Stout""" on the label, i guess this is probably as good as it gets as far as making a stout with wide appeal (except guinness on tap) however, i think the idea of a stout that appeals to everyone runs the risk of removing the characteristics that make it stout, and i think this goes a bit too far in that direction."
""
""
""
""
""
"Probably their best beer overall. Great taste, look, smell, etc. Highly recommended"
""
""
"O:  Great beer.  Will buy again."
""
""
""
"This is my favorite stout to get on draft. The head isn't as cream colored or thick when poured from a bottle."
""
"Got better and sweet towards the end  good beer will drink again"
""
"Great taste, color and feel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: you won't be disappointed. Great beer to introduce someone to milk stouts."
"Overall: Admittedly, I had a large number of preconceptions about this given all the good things that I'd heard about it. To be sure, it's a mighty fine example of a sweet stout and a cut above many of those found in the UK and Ireland. I'm given to understand that the nitro version is better, so that may be one to track down. Definitely in my top ten stouts, though."

"A much sweeter version of Guinness. I mean much sweeter. I prefer Guinness but this is good stuff."
""
""
"Yummy. Balanced. Tasty. Dark. Goes nicely with steak and ale pie or loaded baked potato."
""
""
"Light carboantion and sweet aftertaste. A great beer!"
""
""
""
""
"Smoothest dark beer I've had"
""
"Quick review from a hophead. From tap, after a taste from wife's had to get a pint. Quality beer very similar in look, feel and taste to Guinness. Review is outside after a spicy meal. Good look, nice foam retained throughout. Mouth feel was nice and smooth if you got a little foam, but was a little thin w/o. Overall taste was of a good dark stout, coffee apparent with a smoky ambience, but def not as strong and robust as some others. I can see how others really like this beer and I enjoyed it esp at the start, it just leveled off after. But overall well worth a try or a 6."
"This one has a nice dense, dark look as it should.  The aroma coming off of the top is a little like overripe fruit and toffee with coffee notes.  The flavor is equal to the aroma with no bitter aftertaste at all.  Much better I think as it gets warmer.   fairly good head retention"

"My favorite beer (at the moment). Wonderful flavor, mouth feel and aroma."
"This one is a keeper! You cannot go wrong with the great look, flavor, and such a full taste!"
"My favorite beer I've ever tried."
"A quality stout - refreshing but falls short compared to all the rushian imperial stouts I have lying around"
""
""
""
"While definitely a good stout, I find the Nitro variant to be much more appealing in all sectors, taste, aroma and mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Love the look just not the taste."
""
""
""
""
"This is my favorite of all of the Nitros. I love the name and the beer is just as good. Absolutely great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great balanced flavor. Smooth and a light stout option."
"Very watery, unexpectedly sweet, not a favorite"
""
""

"Thick, smooth, smoky.  Aftertaste almost like you've smoked a decent cigar"

"American craft beers on the 1001 beers list are nothing if not consistent, this one is another highly drinkable beer with a very good balance to it. It wasn't quite as sweet as your normal milk stout and the alcohol content was a little higher than usual but so to was the standard, the beer was great drinking from the start and a beer well worth its place on the list."

"Smooth creamy taste. Very easy to drink and full of bold coffee and milky notes. Love this brew"
"My fall back favorite. I absolutely love this brew."

"Even better on nitro."

"Left Hand Milk Stout brewed by Left Hand Brewing Company, with an ABV of 6.0%  This brew pours out a dark brown color with an light brown head. It has the look of coffee.  The smell is sweet with some grains, and malts. Not much to note on the smell of this brew. Now for the taste it is smooth but rich with flavor.  There is a lot going on in this brew.  You pick up on malts and a mild sweetness, it the taste of this brew. There is nothing overpowering in the taste of this brew, no bad aftertaste. The mouthfeel is nice and bold, but clean finish.  Left Hand Milk Stout is a nice drinking brew. Overall I'm giving  Left Hand Milk Stout a 4 out 5.  I would get this brew again."

"A solid ball-peen smack of subtle, nutty, creamy flavor at the back of the mouth. Solid."
""
""
"Ok I admit it. I have a sweet tooth and this is a tasty sweet stout.  Not much head on my pour but rich and thick silky smooth mouth feel. Roasted coffee, chocolate but not a burnt taste or astringent.  Very easy to drink. I would use this as an introduction to the dark side for non stout lovers. If you want sweet, rich and roasted this is it."

"The first Milk Sweet Stout I've ever had and I was pleasantly surprised. Very cool concept behind this beer. This is a stout for those who have a sweet tooth! Malty notes of Roasted Barley, Oats, and Chocolate. I believe the Brewers at Left Hand say it best, """Milk sugar in your stout is like cream in your coffee""". Because of the sweetness I found this was a beer I could drink over a long night, but you definitely need to be I an a specific mood to drink this beer. My preference is more of a straight forward stout. I would drink this again, it just might not be my first choice."
""
""
"Has a very smooth mouthfeel, coming along a little stale, due to almost no carbonation at all. Begins with earthy malts, along with toffee and molasse, as well as a salted whiff - adding an interesting twist to the beer. Roasted qualities are standing out in this brew, enhanced by cream and gentle milk chocolate. Turns sweeter during the finish, revealing a little heat, caramel and syrup, with a coffeeish bitter impact on the back of the tongue, balancing the beer."
""

""
""
""
""
"This beer is a 5 when on draft."
""

""

""
"In my earlier years, I drank so much of this that I cannot now. So you go, go get some now."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very dark, with subtle dark chocolate and coffee flavors. There are smoother, creamier stouts than this, though. I found it to be a much sharper flavor than I was expecting."

"Feel: very smooth, medium body. Well carbonated."
"Pours dark and impenetrable.  Full 2 g fingers of head from draft.  Smell grains and sugar.  Coffee.  Chocolate.  Very light in the mouth.  Not heavy.  Definitely a light ABV.  Reminds me of Guinness.  Lighter.  Hints of cream in the mouth.  Subtle chocolate and coffee going down.  No bitterness.  Very drinkable.  Won't face plant you.  Smooth but leaves me wanting a Founders Breakfast.  I'm not as fired up about it as others."

"Overall: A fantastic beer that I try and keep on hand at all times."

"absolutely delicious has become one of my favorite beers. Not only is it smooth it has a full body taste that fills your mouth with a soft finish. It also fun to pour it hard (just turn the bottle over and let it fall) go to their site and watch the video."

"O. It’s like the taste of Guinness times 3 and better because of the creamy taste. This is a big step up from LH’s NITRO milk stout. The label is awesome, I wish I had a poster of it."

"Rating: A"
""
""
"This is dubbed as """America's great milk stout""" and it's easy to see why.  Excellent flavor, slightly sweet and without the bitterness of many stouts.  6% alcohol makes it very easy to drink, and it's a good one to have in the fridge once it gets cold.  This one's worth the hype."

"This will be my first review, """bear with me""" I very much enjoyed the smell of this stout, it smell of a milky creamy sensation. The feel of the beer overall was creamy and delightful but the taste was a let down compared to the smell. Yet I'd enjoy this beer again but it's not going to be a favorite of mine."

"Good Stout. Nice black color, decent head. The creaminess is awesome. The aroma at first was amazing and the taste was also great, although not up to par with what I expected after the smell. Overall, a creamy enjoyable stout with just the right amount of alcohol and a touch of bitterness to round it all off....."

"Glass- Shaker Pint"
""
""
"Pours a near black with a thin brown head that never quite vanishes, and leaves some sticky lace down the glass. Smells like chocolate, vanilla, little dark fruit and coffee. Taste is mostly bittersweet chocolate and dark malts. Nice clean crisp finish tho. Not overly sweet. Mouthfeel is outstanding. Smooth, medium to full body. Coats the mouth and leaves a nice bite on the back end. Overall, this is good stuff. I've had it on tap, and its just as good out of the bottle."

"As instructed by the bottle label I poured this into a pint glass very quickly and let the nitro do what it was designed to do. A thick micro-foam head formed on top of a brown/near-black body. The nose is all dry stout and oats. The mouthfeel is smooth and surprisingly light. Lush caramel and oats finishing with a crisp dry stout cleanness. Just lovely."

"Poured on tap, the color was very dark, almost black with a coffee head that settled and left trails down the glass. The smell was nice, with hints of coffee, a bit of chocolate, and a lot of malt. The taste had a lot more chocolate than the nose implied and I thought it was delicious. The mouthfeel was my favorite part. Not overly thick, but still coated the mouth and throat very well. I really liked this one and thought it would be great in the fall, but even in the summer it was a nice treat."

"Recently had this on tap on a trip to Colorado, It was phenomenal.The pour was awesome with a rich brown head and great lacing all the way through. Look was dark as night, the smell was chocolate and coffee. The taste was chocolatey but real subtle with hints of vanilla, caramel and cream. The mouth feel was smooth as silk. I would definitely drink this anytime."

"Maybe it's the fact we pulled through this tornado touchdown and I'm happy to be breathing and indulging, but I felt that not only was this an amazing stout, it was an amazing drinking experience overall. I will be revisiting Nitro again...if I can find it in Indiana."

"My favorite beer out there right now. This stout sets the standard for all other stouts. A fine dark color and aroma of coffee and chocolate milk sets up a smooth and think taste that we all expect from our stouts. The chocolate flavors leave a pleasant aftertaste that keeps you coming back."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I'd try this again on tap, but this beer reiterates to me that it's hard to go back once you've gone Imperial. This might be a nice step on the ladder if you seek to climb upwards from Guinness."

"Agree with the guy below saying it's a good crowd option and sessionable. Had hoped for more from the nitro fill. Pours black no head. Smells nice sweet lactose, coffee beans and semi sweet chocolate. Taste is sweet coffee, tiny bit of cocoa. Feel isn't anything special which was a disappointment almost tastes a bit flat"

"I was very impressed with this beer. I'm not a beer connoisseur. I love dark beers like Guinness.  Before trying Guinness in college I never liked beer. Still trying to broaden my horizons. I selected this beer after reading the reviews on this site and I was quite impressed. Dark, chocolate, rich in flavor, delicious. I have added this to my favorites list to buy again."
""
"I've had the nitro version of this beer, which I thought was unbeatable, but there's still something deeply satisfying about this original version. Great flavor profile and mouthfeel."

"Would get this beer again, would consider it for a barbecue option."

"O: Here it is. Now that Left Hand comes to MD, I think I've found the perfect Guinness substitute for St. Patrick's Day, and not a moment too soon. Make that the perfect Guinness substitute 365 days a year - this is delicious."

"Good beer. Imagine Guinness or Murphy's with a little sugar added and you have this beer. Personally I'm not a fan sweets. This beer's sweetness is mild but it is too sweet for my liking. If Guinness is black coffee, this is a latte. Great for those who like the texture of nitro beers without the roasted flavor."
""
"O/D-Bought a single. Glad I didn't go for a full sixer. It was a cool beer to pour, and the flavors were pretty on point however, the carbonation was very flat. Still happy I tried this."

"O: Its an ok stout, I'm really not that impressed with it."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
"O: This takes me back to my early days as a Guinness drinker but much better. The roasted maltiness is great. The mouth feel is quite nice. Wish I could pick up a little more on the nose. Overall a well executed nitro stout. This is highly drinkable and I could easily hit several of these back to back."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The lactose in this milk stout played strongly in the foreground, providing so smooth a mouthfeel I felt like I was going to accidentally gulp and finish this thing from the start. Uber-smooth. The taste was reminiscent of a typical soft, mildly spiced milk stout that was again so creamy I just couldn't put it down. This has absolutely become one of my favorites of all time."
""
"Poured into a glass tulip... Dark, almost black-- typical of this type of beer... Fairly aggressive pour doesn't immediately yield a big frothy head, but seems to build after it's in the glass-- nice tan foam... Aroma is a little sweet with chocolate and coffee overtones... Taste is a little sweet without being syrupy. All in all, a pretty decent beer and tasted a little better than expected. Above average and recommendable. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - One of my first with this style. Very drinkable and super creamy on the palate. Sweet, but not overly. I thought several times to myself that this was like grown up chocolate milk. Would seek this out again as a change up to bigger beers from time to time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- this is a delicious milk stout. The lactose doesn't drag down the rich malt flavors of stouts but adds a nice undertone to it."
"Pours pitch black in color that you can't see through. A small beige head at first is seen then fades to just around the sides of the glass. Some decent lacing is seen which each sip. The aroma is of chocolate, roasted malt, and black coffee. Very pleasant aroma. The taste is the same with a tad of sweetness at first that slowly fades into a very sight bitter finish BUT perfect actually. Perfect carbonation also. Goes down easy and very smooth. One of the better milk stouts actually."
""
""
""
""
"O. Extremely enjoyable """desert""" beer. You probably wouldn't want more than one at a time, but the kind of beer you find yourself idly thinking """I could really do with a Milk Stout right now""" at odd times. Pretty unusual, very tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall a damn tasty milk stout. Pretty roasty compared to many others I've had. Nice brew."
""
""
""
""

"One of the best stouts from Colorado and a treat to be proud of. The nitro bottle is pure beer innovation and changes their base milk stout into a whole new beer. Delicious, beautiful and so, so smooth."

"Overall: I'm a sucker for stouts on nitro and milk stouts are the perfect beer to be served this way. This is a very good creamy, chocolaty beer. It goes down extremely easily and had I not been driving, I probably would have had a few more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This one pours a liquid smooth tan with a huge white head. Looks delicious. Not getting a whole lot from the nose on this one milky, little espresso, some raisins notes as well. This is definitely a desert beer. Wow is this one sweet to the tongue. The mouthfeel is incredible, like drinking liquid gold. Incredibly creamy and desirable. Not something you can session or have a lot of but a very good sipper beer."
""
""
""
"O: One of my favorite beers. Top 5."
""
""
""

"Overall: This is a surprisingly good stout. It’s not as full bodied or overly flowing with coffee and cocoa aromas as traditional stouts. This beer is however medium bodied. The coffee aroma is more subtle, but the flavor is very good. Is silky smooth and just lingers on the tongue like milk. A very drinkable, must try."
""
""
""
"O- An excellent beer for anyone who enjoys milk. Or beer. Just seeing the Nitro gush foam into my glass was worth the price. The only real negative point would be the slight souring on the backend, but this was a very minor component of the flavor profile."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Appearance is a dark brown color with a finger of tan head. The head dissipated fairly quickly but left some nice lacing behind. The nose is roasty and it hints toward a strong roast flavor. That does not pan out as the flavor profile has only a mild roastiness to it. The flavor profile is tilted more toward the sweet end. The mouthfeel is creamy and milky. This is a fine and enjoyable offering."
"O: A decent drinker of a stout. The nitro certainly adds a great deal to smooth out the mouthfeel and give this one a bit of a silky feel to the beer. That said, I just wish there was more to the beer itself as it is overly simple and unexciting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Upon my arrival home I immediately found a pint glass. I poured """hard""" as directed and found that a heavy head of beer formed nicely. I noted the dark almost blackish color and the creamy dark head on the pint glass. Not much carbination but little bubbles moving in the glass. The aroma had hints of chocolate and coffee. THe first sip was smooth to the palate and had a great initial taste but a far better after taste. The beer was very good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This stout just fell short for my liking. I prefer slightly sweeter milk stouts. This was too bitter. They got the milky texture right, they just need to work on balancing this one out. This could have just been a bad bottle but it struck me as nothing more than a slightly above average stout."

"Overall- I prolly have a bad batch.. it's not supposed to taste sour is it?.. all I get is jackfruit like taste. I don't taste the dark chocolate,, sweet black coffee like other people have been saying"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A stout that is amazingly easy to drink. It describes perfectly the word Milk Stout, very assertive, milky and not complex. It could be a dessert, for the entire family."
""
""
""
"I really enjoyed my first Left Hand Milk Stout. I love bitter, and this beer did not disappoint. A hint of sweetness in this very creamy milk stout was perfect for my liking this evening. As others have said, not much of a head, but I was not at all unhappy as the taste made up for that. I would definitely buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 40 degrees. It was too cold. I was not impressed with what I saw. NOOO head at all and I was like crap!. However the beer smelled okay and I was really surprised when I tasted it. The beer had a really smooth feel and taste. It was quite good and I mean I t tasted like a stout any stout really. I would certainly buy this beer again."
""

"I actually had the nitro version. Beautiful, dark stout. Probably around 40 on the SRM scale. I must have not have given it a hard enough pour because the head was weak. Aroma was like a mocha coffee. Nice. Taste included the expected sweet malty flavor, cocoa and left little bitter notes on the aftertaste. I didn't get any of the oats. It offered low carbonation. Viscosity was med-thick. A fairly delicious beer that I would give another shot and recommend to all."
"Nitro or not, Left Hand's Milk Stout has been a go-to for me since I first tried it. At 6%, the flavor profile is robust enough but not overpowering. If only this were as widely available on tap as Guinness Draught..."
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - I still can't really get past the burnt coffee flavors, but the sweetness combined with the mouthfeel must make this quite a nice treat for those who enjoy them. Purchased as part of a mix-six. No full sixer in my future."

"Did not care too much for the smell but the taste and texture is nearly perfect. I am just starting to get into stouts, porters, and craft beers because Guinness is my favorite beer or was until I had this. This blows Guinness out of the water. I am in love with how easily this beer goes down while still having an amazing texture and taste. My first beer I've had by Left Hand Brewing Company and I defiantly will be trying others."

"Pours near pitch black with an ample off-white head that slowly falls leaving some quite a bit of splotchy lace and a thin, but solid layer of bubbles. Smells wonderful. Milk chocolate, coffee, a bit a lactic sourness, milky smell. The mouthfeel is surprisingly dry at first, but with a milk chocolate luxuriousness. Coffee and cream sweetness melds with milk chocolate....oh my. Such a luxurious stout. So good."
""
"What a wonderful stout.Smooth, nice hint of chocolate and coffee. Not a flat stout, it has just enough carbonation to give it a nice finish. This stout is better than the Nitro that is offered by Left Hand. Nitro is OK and a must try but it is not as smooth and does not finish like the Milk Stout. Both are very good but I prefer the Milk overall"

"Simply Incredible - 5,000 thread count Egyptian Cotton sheets have nothing on the soft, smooth body this beer exhibits. Light enough to enough multiple in one sitting, however, I highly recommend savoring this one if you come across it. Bravo Left Hand!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Excellent stuff, but I pity I could only obtain a bottle this old - I would love to try this on tap, or better yet, in the nitro bottles that they've been distributing. The lactic sugars, even at this point, provide a stout that is less on the sweet, chocolate syrupy side, and far more on actual fresh chocolate, which is pretty much unimaginable without its vanilla sweet counterpart. I would gladly have more!"
""
"Overall: Draft Magazine called this """America's best stout""" at one point, and I would recommend it to any stout lover. Or anyone who is looking for something different. In my opinion Draft Magazine was right, this stout is better than most imports and other American Crafts. Pick it up if you are able! This is like a """sessional""" stout. Always a go to!"
""
"This is a very well made beer and a great exemplar of the style. Smooth and slightly sweet, it looks very nice in the glass although the head zipped away pretty quick. A very deep brown color promises depth and substance. the nose is surprisingly unstoutlike and reflects more sweet than malt notes. The taste is very robust with nice chocolate roasty tones. Very nice beer."
""
"Overall, this is an excellent stout. I wasn't sure what to expect with the word """milk""" in front of it...but the lactose adds a nice creaminess to the beer, without distracting from the rest of the flavors. I would love to try this beer out on draft! If you are a stout fan, I highly recommend this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This beer is simply fantastic. If you are a fan of stouts this is your beer. The coffee and chocolate really come through in both taste and smell. I will say if you really want the sweetness to come through drink the beer a little warmer than fridge temps. As the beer warmed up the sweetness came through."

"I found this extremely easy to dink and overall enjoyed it very much. I’ve had the regular Milk Stout in the past, but this Nitro version was better and easier to drink. I could session this like a Guinness, and think that this may be easier to drink and better tasting."
""
""
""
"Overall - an enjoyable stout at a good price point!"
"O: Awesome, awesome beer, and not even a rarity or a special-occasion-only due to its price. Delicious, milkshake-like in body, and widely available- this is now my go-to winter beer. Spend the extra buck for the nitro-bottled version."
"This is a very popular beer in my area and I was expecting a lot from this. It came in a nitro bottle and was served into a pint glass. The color appeared to be pitch black (but others will argue it is just very dark brown). The head recedes to a sliver and holds. The beer smells of coffee, chocolate, and molasses, smelling more bitter than sweet. The taste is bittersweet, starting sweet but finishing with the coffee notes. The mouthfeel is very creamy but finishes flat as other reviewers have noted, and increased carbonation may have benefited the beer in this area although a thicker and creamier mouthfeel should be expected. Overall, this is an easy drinking beer with some good flavors that just didn't match all that well for me. It's easy to find this beer (at least the non-nitro version) but there are better stouts out there."
""
"Beer poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz """pint""" glass. Pours black with a slight reddish tint with a small off white head. Smells of chocolate and slight coffee, nice strong aroma. Tastes of coffee with slight chocolate aftertaste, slight milky taste. Beer is medium bodied that has a creamy feel and goes down nicely. Overall a very good beer."
""

"Will definfitely buy again"

"An outstanding milk stout. Pours nice and dark, with a good brown creamy head, the head didn't last though. smells of chocolate and coffee. taste is so creamy and smooth, nice and sweet, the smells come though on the palate, chocolate is was I tasted the most of, with a nice hint of coffee. This milk stout is a must have"
""
""
""
"Creamy mouthfeel as it should be. A delicious beer."
""
""
""
"I always said that Odell's Cutthroat Porter could use a full body. This beer has a lot of the same roasty notes, with an added bonus of being sweet and silky smooth. But not cloyingly sweet. The smell is so inviting that you can't help but down the entire bottle in no time. This is a dangerously drinkable, and eminently pleasant, brew. It could use a bit more carbonation to liven things up, and the taste isn't anything that will blow your pants off. Regardless, this will become a permanent resident in my fridge."

"D - Ridiculously good... This a world class example of the Milk / Sweet Stout category... I don't buy many cases in a year, but this one is definitely case worthy... The aroma and mouthfeel are exceptional and I'm not afraid to say world class... A few minor tweaks to enhance appearance and taste and this one would be one of the best beers going... My best experience with Left Hand by a mile (and more)..."

"Note: Re-reviewing due to change in serving format from nitro-bottle to nitro-tap. Makes a world of difference."

"I'm not usually in the mood for a stout, but when I am I tend to prefer one that is not too bitter. This beer is fantastic. I'm hard pressed to say anything I dislike about it, but I don't want to give it all fives just in case I find one I like better. For the moment, this is my favorite kind of stout. The texture is slightly creamy and makes me think of dark chocolate. I guess the one thing I would like to see on this beer is a longer-lasting head. We'll see what I think of the """nitro""" version of this guy soon...just bought both in a make your own six-pack. :)"

"Overall: I'd definitely pick up a six-pack. And then another. It sure hits the spot without being too sweet. But I do think it needs a little refining--some more body, a bit more roast, and perhaps some more fruit would do the trick."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: My first experience with a milk stout as opposed to regular stout beers. I definitely enjoyed this one and look forward to many more. While it is smooth enough to go down easily, it is enjoyable enough to want to savor. I think that I would order this over a Guinness!"

"Very thick and creamy taste but not too much. Almost a bitter taste but yet very sweet and enjoyable. Definitely a winter type stout that's good for the snowed in folk. I tried this out of a 6 pack in whidbey island, wa from the beer works. Highly recommend trying this stout if your a fan of thicker beers. Definitely one to try."

"Overall: I used to adore this beer, but now it feels mediocre. It's the beer for people who people who dislike beer, love chocolate, or who adore Guinness. For me, it was a great introduction to beer, but now I feel I've moved on to bigger and better things! I still have a soft spot for this beer, although I now prefer the regular version to the nitro version."

"O- A very tasty stout that is easy to drink. I was pleased with this one and look forward to having it again."

"I am impressed with this beer. First time trying it with the Nitro too. Really excellent beer, with great flavor and a good feel. I know that I am going to buy this again, which that's not an easy mark to hit with me. Pretty drinkable as well. The pint was done too fast."
""
"Pours a deep dark brown with a small brown head and good lacing. Aroma is of sweet mildly toasted caramel malt and chocolate. Taste of sweet dark caramel malt mildly toasted, come cacao and milk chocolate, light bitterness. A medium bodied, creamy and smooth body on the palate. Finished with some lightly toasted caramel malt, some cacao flavor, and sweet milk chocolate with some light bitterness for balance. Its a good drinking after dinner brew."
""
""
""
""
"Appearance pours a very dark almost black in color supporting a thin dissipating head leaving nil lace. Smell of definate coffee, roasted malt. Taste has the coffee and roasted malt flavors leaving a bitter mixed with the hops having a light sweetness in the throughout. Mouthfeel is full with light fitting carbonation. An easy drinking enjoyable stout."

"A really nice stout, there is a lot of flavor here. There is a sweetness that keeps things from getting too dry and bitter, ends up balancing nicely. I sampled this at a beer fest over the summer, but only now have the chance to properly review and appreciate it, and glad I tried it, a really nice beer."
"This is one of my favorite stouts. I love pretty much everything from Left Hand, but this thing is so bold. Perfect about a hearty meal. Sticks to the glass like oil. Now I have to go get some when I get off work. Well I don't want to say anything else, but my comment has to be 250 characters long so this is just a bunch of bs to get there."

"o: Similar in taste to the Avery Out of Bounds Stout I had and reviewed recently, but a little more stoutly. And more carbonation. I'd take this one over Avery's, although at least in my area Avery's price point deserves the A it gives itself on their labeling. $1.25 is always better than $2 if you are the buyer, especially if you are part Scottish."

"The lactose in this stout adds a nice caramel flavor that cuts through the roastiness of the malt. Sippable, soft texture with an array of subtle flavors from front to back. A little bit chocolatey. It's definitely on the sweet side, the mouthfeel is light, and it's a pretty pour. Not much head, very dark with low carbonation. I'd drink this again if I were in the mood for a stout with a lighter feel that didn't compromise on flavor."

"This is my favorite beer so far. Rich and creamy with a distinct coffee flavor that I love. Great head after pouring and pairs very well with a burger and fries. I really don't have any criticisms of it. It's even pretty to look at in the glass with a rich, chocolate-y brown with the fluffy white head on top. If anything, the sweetness and heaviness of it borders on making it seasonal - Autumn and Winter. You wouldn't drink this with a salad or on the beach. It's much more cozy and filling. Overall: love love love :)"
""
""
"O - A very easy drinking, flavorful milk stout. The mouthfeel is incredible, it's really one of the creamiest beers I've ever had. The beer is sweet, but not overly so. Worthy of repeat purchase."
""

""
""
"Thick bear with a dark chocolaty head. Head less substantial than I had hoped. Another creamy milk stout from the collection - I really do like stouts! Mild, creamy chocolate with some coffee tones - not too much. A good solid milk stout. Mouthfeel is really good, not too bitter - not too sweet."

"A perennial favorite with a wonderful chocolate, coffee, and lactose smell, a malty taste, and a creamy, if not slightly syrupy mouthfeel."
"Poured into pint glass; jet black, showing a bit of dark brown in light, with a thick tan head. Smells the same as the nitro (it should, it's the same beer just different gas); tastes the same as well. The only difference is the mouthfeel really; the carbonation really gives this what it needs (although I may have gotten a flat bottle of the nitro). My ratings for this one would be improved in appearance and mouthfeel, the same otherwise."

"O- I'm glad my local Wegmans had these in craft a six pack because this is a uniquely well-crafted brew. Go out and get one."

"Overall: A very solid milk/sweet stout and probably the best use of nitro I've had so far. The nitro adds creamyness without taking away from the other flavors."
""
""
""
""
""

"o: it’s not quite the super-creamy nitro that you’d have on a draft system, and there’s no widget, but it works really well, lots of delicious roast character with a great sugar balance and silky mouthfeel, rich for a stout of this abv"

""
""
""

"Pretty tasty and I forgot to buy ice cream, I this would taste pretty good with a half scoop of French Vanilla floating in it."
""
""

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of roasted malts, some coffee. Taste is big on roasted malts, coffee and chocolate are present, pretty good. Feels creamy in the mouth and overall this is a solid beer."

"The taste and feel meld nicely together as there is a smooth, creamy sweetness. Touches of burnt malts, coffee and milk chocolate can all be found in a dry overall atmosphere."
"Final Thoughts: The stout style is a classic and the modern milk stout is a sweet twist on that style. While the nitro version is quite good, the carbonated Milk Stout is just average. Still I like seeing breweries making this style of beer. I was starting to think brewers forgot how to make a stout without the word 'Imperial' in the name. Would I drink it again? Yes, but only on nitro."
"The sweetness comes on strong with the first sip and remains sweet throughout. Also there are mellower mild hops in the background. Ends slightly dry. Very nice beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- This is a good beer, good for a more standard stout but not over the top. I get the lactose sugar feeling in my mouth like I just drank milk, but this beer is pretty basic for a stout. Not bad by any means, not overall impressive though either."

"Overall this was a hard beer to rate for me , the looks and mouthfeel were a homerun , but the taste and smell which are far more important were not there. I would like to try this beer on tap and see the difference , but out of this bottle it just a so so brew"

"Very solid, sweet deliciousness. Fairly light, extremely smooth, slight sugary taste. If you're told to drink your milk, this is where you should start. Better than chocolate milk. Wouldn't mind just a hint more of bitterness or burning taste, but nevertheless this goes down so easy, so smooth, so tasty. Perhaps my favorite beer from Left Hand."
""
"O: This is what I always want Guinness to be like. The nitro makes this tasty beer very smooth and highly quaffable without being watery. This is an excellent choice for stout lovers or anyone who likes an easy drinking beer."
""
""
""
""
"This is my go to milk stout. The offering in a Nitro bottle is a plus as I felt the end product poured into a glass, had more of a velvety milkshake mouthfeel. This beer is everything a milk stout should be, toasty and roasted dark malts with a balanced milk sugar sweetness with a lingering flavor of milk chocolate. C'mon what's not to like?"

"O - I've been told and read this is 'America's stout'. I'm not sure I'd go that far, but this is one of the best examples of its style you'll find and one that's easy to find at that. This is a real dandy of a stout and while Left Hand keeps to the basics of this style that's what makes it so good. Sometimes the good things don't have to be pounded with a high abv, but just crafted in a manner that sticks to a styles roots. That's what the Left Hand Milk Stout is all about. Something any of us can buy and left satisfied by the experience. If you are into milk stouts this is a top shelf creation. But unlike some sweeter stouts this one could be enjoyed by anyone."

"A wonderful drinkable beer. I would highly recommend it as a gateway."

"O - Best milk stout I've had bar none. You owe it to yourself to taste this on a nitro tap."

""
""
"O- One of the best looking beers i have ever seen, good smell, but the tapered off a little from there. The flavor was just a little underwhelming. Good solid stout that i would certainly drink again, but not one that will blow your taste buds away. A much better version of a Guinness stout in my opinion."
"I love stouts and think this is up there with some of the best. Every stout does not need to have an ABV > 10% to be considered flavorful and praise-worthy; this is an example of such a case."
""
""
""
""
""
" Overall it's a decent Milk/sweet stout...something i'd buy (and do buy) semi regularly, but it's a bit of a let down if you drink it right after a richer,tastier English chocolate/milk/sweet stout. The non nitro version is a waste of money, but the nitro is a decent buy for an american made milk stout"
"Poured hard from a nitro-bottle into a tulip glass (all I had). Great black color and thick head that you want from a nitro beer. Taste was less sweet and creamy than the traditional (non-nitro) milk stout from Left Hand. Wanted to have all the same flavors with a nice creamy head. A bit disappointed by the lack of carbonation after the recommended hard pour. Wife liked it more than me."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a pitch black, with a thin tan head. Aromas of freshly brewed espresso. Taste begins with a coffee start, followed by some toasted grain, and a sweet, earthy finish. Rich mouthfeel. Overall quite a nice milk stout. Very sweet, almost a dessert beer. I like this A LOT better than the nitro version."

"Re-review of nitro bottle 3/7/13-$11.99 for a 6'er at BevCo. Brewed with Pale 2-row, Crystal, Munich, Roast Barley, Flaked Oats, Flaked Barley and Chocolate malts. Hopped with Magnum and US Goldings. 25 IBU's, OG=16P, 6.0% ABV. No widget. Poured hard. Forms a nice creamy long lasting light tan head with really ncie lacing and great retention. Pours out to a near black with brown accents. Carbonation is low, ~1.0 carbs or so. The nose is wonderfully full of chocolate and carob..beautiful roast notes with black walnut. Mouthfeel is smooth, pillowy soft, creamy and medium bodied. The taste is great...black walnut, well balanced roast, residual sweetness perfectly balanced with a classic mild hop profile and notes of black patent and roasted barley in the aftertaste. There is an odd grassy tartness that doesn't quite sit well in classic examples. Overall though, this is a near world-class beer, IMO."
"this pours opaque black....theres something really cool about that. the smell is hearty you can tell its a stout. no fancy spices just good ol black beer. there is really light carbonation, which contributes to the smoothness and makes this pretty drinkable. there is a creaminess that works well with the light carbonation also. there is also a note worthy thick head that coats the glass as you drink it. if you are looking for a good stout this would be a great one to grab."

"The beer pours like black velvet with a beautiful, near perfect head of tightly knit, sand dune-white bubbles. The beer’s body is dark and impenetrable to the eye, though presumably clean. The beer leaves a sheet of medium width, very tight lacing across much of the glass that eventually stretches into a long web. On the nose, the beer smells nicely roasty, like espresso. There is also a great lactic sour-sugar smell in the nose that lets you know it’s a milk stout. It actually almost smells like a cappuccino. Faint hints of a caramel and toffee can also be detected in the nose. On the tongue, the beer tastes much like the smell, with rich sweet coffee with a touch of roasted bitter and a touch of lactic sour. The flavor begins as watery coffee with a touch of milk before blooming into beautiful, almost cappuccino-like, flavors. Touches of toffee, vanilla, and sour milk touch upon the tongue. The finish is a bit sour with a touch of roasted malts and the aftertaste is a lesser clone of the finish. On the mouth, the beer feels smooth and velvety with a creamy quality to it. The beer’s body is medium and fluffy thanks to the nitrogen bubbles. The mouth is left wet with sour saliva. Overall, this is a lovely nitro milk stout. Great complex flavors. It is a little watery in the start, and honestly this beer is better when on tap than in the bottle (yes, yes, this is obvious, but it is especially prevalent with this beer). Try this beer."
"This is a fine beer. Pours out to a vast blackness. An agressive pour yielded a very, small head. The aroma gives forth roasted malt. Mouthfeel is very silky, almost creamy, but not heavy at all. This was very much Guinness-like, but with a real, depth of flavor. Very drinkable."
""
"O: This is a fine example of a sweet stout. Its not overwhelming, or is it underwhelming. The nitro bottle is a cool idea, however for me I like my stouts with a little more kick to them. Nothing wrong with this beer."

""
""
""
""
"When delivered, you can see the nitro bubbles exuding from the middle of the glass creating a beautiful caramel colored head. Upon first sip, you realize that the nitro has taken the original Milk Stout to a whole new level of creaminess and taste! My wife is not the biggest fan of stouts but she always humors me and tries them. This one was """the one""" that has changed her mind and she even ordered her own pint!!! That is a testament to how good this beer is, because she is very picky when it comes to beer and she loves it!"

"12 oz bottle. Pours dark brown with long lasting, creamy, beige head. Aroma is of bready, toasted malt with hints of chocolate and dark fruit. Body is medium and smooth. Burned toast, bready malt, brown sugar, milk chocolate and dark fruit fill the moth. Finish is medium, bitter-sweet. Very nice stout."

"The overall taste is very sweet and tastes of strong cream, coffee, chocolate, oats and barely. I do not taste any hops in this stout. It's not a particularly thick stout, but it is sweet and the taste is very good. It goes down very smoothly, and would compliment desert very nicely. I get the impression that cherries or anything with cherries (cherry pie, cheesecake or cordials) would compliment this stout very nicely."

"O – I really like this milk stout. It still has all the sweetness that milk stouts usually have but it also has a nice roasted coffee element. This is one of the most balanced milk stouts I’ve ever had in terms of sweetness and bitterness. Really, really nice beer."
""
""
"Overall. I really do love the look of this, mainly due to the nitro. Sadly, the nito seems to have adverse effects on the mouthfeel, and even the taste of a beer. To me, nitro is just a gimic that I can do without. Otherwise a good beer that really does look cool."
"O: I feel like I should get back to my bottle shop and buy all of these before they're gone, it's that good. Going to pour my second as I finish this."

Flavors of coffee with a touch of sweet cream. A heavy beer made light by nitro makes an easy beer to drink. Finishes without any bitterness."

"Overall not the worst beer ever but it's let down by how I assume the brewers weren't sure what a milk stout actually was."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I had never tried a milk stout or a nitro but this combo is definitely a winner. This tastes good and is super easy to drink I was pleasantly surprised well done left hand you have inspired me to not fear the milk stout and try nitro on tap when I can, so thank you."
""
"Sitting back and enjoying it right now."
""
"Overall, this one is sure to please and coffee fan!"
"330 ml. bottle. Pours a black colour with a big brown head taht last for a very good while and leaves an enormous lace. Aroma of vanilla, coffe, cream, chocolate and dark fruits. Body is not as thick as I expected, creamy medium palate. Taste keeps the aroma: vanilla, coffee, some chocolate, cream and dark fruits. Finish is kind of brandy of liquor. Not your tipical stout, but easy to drink and leaves you wanting to repeat."

"Poured from a nitro bottle, luckily met the Left Hand rep who told me that to """pour hard""" was no joke. Beautiful cascade on pour, nearly black color with very light tan head. Light roasty notes on the nose, but not very much aroma. Sweet malts on the palate, very little hint of bitterness, but not cloying in any way. While not a terribly complex flavor, one of the easiest-drinking beers I've had a very long while; a 6% beer that could easily pass for a 4%. Wonderful, palate-coating mouthfeel - creamy, silky, and satisfying. Maybe not the most complex flavor profile amongst stouts, but this is a beer I could be happy drinking most any time."
"Pours a dark oily brown topped with a frothy, cream colored head. I expected a little larger of a head considering the 'nitro.' The aroma is wonderful with smooth cream, milk chocolate, brown sugar, and candy. The taste reveals additional roasty and coffee notes within. The flavors are not as powerful as I expected, and overall the beer is pretty light in its body and feel as well. It goes down quite easily however. Ultimately good, but a disappointment if you are looking for a rich beer. I prefer Young's or Lancaster Milk Stout as better examples of the style."

"Overall - A nice milk-stout that is tasty, smooth, and easy on the palate. I probably wouldn't seek it out but I would drink one of these again if available. NOTE: I drank a Nitro version a few months later...very similar review, overall..."

"The mouth feel is really good, smooth, no flavor over powers the other one, i really enjoyed this beer."
"It is a tasty beer, but actually smells better than it tastes. There are a lot of beers out there, so it will probably be a while before I get back to this one, after this sixer is gone."
"O: Nitro really makes this beer. It's pretty solid and well-priced. I would so serve this to the """Informed beer drinkers""" who are too cool for Coors Light but don't have the taste buds for bolder stuff."

"O- This is an extremely drinkable stout. With its low ABV I can definitely see myself enjoying this all day. However, there is nothing extremely special or complex about this. A great beer for leisure or to introduce your friends to a milk stout, but it is just missing some items that would make it more special."
"Happy to have tried this! Neat to have the only bottled nitrogen infused beer sans widget. Price is pretty high ($10.99 a sixer) though, so I’m happy I only picked up a single. I can enjoy a Black Butte just as much for a few bucks less."
"Edit: Just drank a bottle of this stuff at home. My review above and score stands."

"Overall, a super solid base beer with a nice improvement. This remains one of my favorite milk stouts, and the improvement on the mouthfeel is only making this beer more and more likely my favorite, go-to milk stout. Great lactic sweetness and roasted character with nice interplay between the earthy hops, chocolate and coffee notes."
""
"O- This beer looks and feels fantastic. Could have had a little more taste, to me, but still a great beer."

""

"Bought a six pack to try in summer. No disappointment A perfect pour, perfect way to end a holiday evening. The beer was consistent with my winter review. Sweet, but never cloying, great mouth feel, beautiful head that lasts and laces. Aromatic."
"Overall: Wow! This is a superb beer…the flavor and mouthfeel are wonderful (or add your favorite superlative here), creamy and smooth…many try a milk stout, but this one is on an upper echelon, top shelf serving…the bottle calls it “America’s Stout” and if this was the one stout we exported worldwide, I’d be fine with that as I’m sure Japan would be as well…it’s not a unique concept that’s going on, but a finely tuned specimen that needs no alteration (head could be thicker, but that’s the nit pickiest thing I can think of)… an outstanding brew that I couldn’t recommend higher for anybody looking for a fantastic beer or an after dinner, by the fire sipper…(4.75/5)"
""
""
"O- The nitro transforms this beer from mediocre to very good. This really makes me wish other breweries could bottle their stouts in nitro-bottle. Lancaster Milk Stout nitro-bottle anyone?"
""
""
"O=I wish I another bottle and definitely worth trying. Tried to make a """Half and Half""" (or """Black and Tan""" with the New Glarus Apple Ale with limited success...this was a case where the sum was greater than the parts, as the combination, particularly around the separation line, was awesome)."

"O: this beer kicks ass! It's luscious and creamy and everything it's supposed to be. I would have scored this beer even higher if they would have made the pouring instructions more prevalent and obvious because it makes that much of a difference. in fact if you wanted a slightly thinner beer with more roast and coffee notes you can just pour a little slower (still real hard, just not as violently), you should experiment. Also, I would have included chocolate in the description on the packaging also (i.e. chocolate milk stout) because this IS a great chocolate milk stout. Unless Terrapin releases Moo-Hoo on nitro, this is probably my new favorite. Now I'm a sucker for milk stouts, especially on nitro, but I didn't think they'd pull it off in the bottle. I was wrong. Thank You, Left Hand."
""
""

"O- I found this beer to be my favorite of the night. A nice standard milk stout, not overly complex, and nice to finish off the evening."
""
""
"Poured it aggressively into an Imperial Pint glass. Big thick head thats and inch or so thick. Smells so nice like fresh brew coffee and slight chocolate smell. Taste just like it smells. Flavors became more pronounced as the stout warmed. Nice and very drinkable. I liked it!"

"I'm big into stouts, but I rank this as my all-time favorite thus far."
""
"Pours pitch black with a creamy thick off white head that leaves alot of lacing on edge of glass. Smells like a cross between a coffee shop and a dark chocolate bar. Looks amazing. Taste is very smooth and creamy. Mild chocolate sweetness balances with the bitter roasted coffee. Very good stout."
""
""
""
"O: It's a good stout, it's well balanced, flavors are good, and was about the standard price per bottle for a craft beer, so it was worth it and is worth a try."

"O - Solid beer. Nothing spectacular, but the mouthfeel is very nice. It'd be a nice alternative to a Guinness draft or a good beer for someone newer into craft or into stouts."

"this is a great example of a sweet stout. It touches on many of the key components for a solid stout. The color is good although i can till see through it, and the head retention is strong. I have had other sweet stouts and this one is maybe not the best but right up there."

"This beer poured up a deep brown almost black with a beautiful and lucious one finger head the color of the nougat inside a three musketeers bar. Retention was fairly poor, and there was no lacing to speak of. The nose is malt, coffee, and soy sauce. Taste is very sweet and errs to that side rather than to the bitter. However there is a little bit of hops on the finish. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy with more carbonation than I would have expected for a stout. Not bad at all. An enjoyable beer!!!"

"When I am not looking for the typical 8-10% stouts this is one of my go to stouts. Easy to have a couple of these on a weeknight and still carry on a coherent conversation. The sweetness is really nice on a cooler night. Just a very satisfying stout."

"I had the regular Milk Stout, not the Nitro. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. About 1/2""" tan head, which dissipates quickly leaving lace up the sides of the glass. Aroma is about what you would expect with a stout - coffee-like black patent malt is clear from the roasting. Some dark chocolate and toffee. Not much grassy, citrus or floral notes from the hops though - I would usually expect a bit more in a stout. Taste is very sweet due to lactose, also with strong malty and roasted flavor you would expect with a stout. Very little bitterness from the hops to counteract the sweetness. Mouthfeel is robust, heavy with moderate to light carbonation. Overall, I like it - there are not many milk stouts out there and this is a good one!"

"This was an okay stout at best. Found it a little difficult to finish the pint. The aftertaste wasn't so good. Maybe, they were tapping the bottom of the keg - seemed to have trouble filling the glass, because of the foam. Tried it at The Beer Exchange in Kalamazoo, Michigan."
""

"O - Overall this is a fantastic stout, one that could be drank as a special occassion beer, but works just as easily as your everyday stout. I still don't know if NITRO is really the same as the original, but if I had to guess, I'd say Nitro has a little less head, and a little less sweetness, but a more complex malt profile. Until I drink the two side by side, I won't know for sure"

"UPDATE: 3/16/2013 - not going to write a separate review for the Nitro version. I'll just update some stuff. Flavor was a little less-explosive than I remember it, but it was still damn good. Bits of cocoa, coffee, and roasted malt wrapped in a soothing blanket of sweetness without going overboard. Mouth feel with nitrogen is amazing; super creamy and out of this world. Head lasts until the end of the beer, too."
"Mouthfeel is light and velvety. I think the milk stout aspect comes out most here, as it is almost alkaline, rather than the normal acidity evident in most beers. Watery aspect makes the beer incredibly drinkable, as it isn't so watery to be not enjoyable. Overall a beer with aspects I normally wouldn't envision liking, but do in this case."

"O:I may have been unfair in my rating because this was my first """eye opening""" craft beer so it has a dear place in my heart. This is one of my favorite offerings from Left Hand which is a middle/upper tier brewery in my opinion.

"Its a nice nitro milk stout, but I prefer the regular milk stout to the nitro milk stouts. I could easily session the nitro version over the regular milk stout but its missing that characteristic thick, chewy texture."
""
""
"Got to give it to left hand for going with the nitro here. For some reason brewers seem to have an aversion to nitro these days. Not sure why. Could be due to the bad rants about it a few years back which claimed that nitro takes away from the flavor. I never agreed with that. Great beer and smart move by Left hand taking advantage of the rarity. Ill try almost any beer on nitro these days since it doesnt happen that often."

"Pours a black color with a quarter inch, light tan head. Good aroma, chocolate, coffee, maybe a touch of vanilla. Taste is decent, par for the course. There is some sweetness, with a more roasted notes. It is a little on the thin side, in terms of mouthfeel. The thinness may be what I find most disappointing. Perhaps I have become accustomed to bolder, Imperial Stouts and just expect more. Overall, this is a fine beer, but not outstanding."

"This beer pours pitch black and has a slight brown head that lasts all the way down with a nice thick lacing. The flaovrs of the beer are somewhat roasty with a bit of chocolate and coffee. The creamy texture of this beer is really unlike any other. It has a certain smoothness that is unparalleled. The combination of lactose and nitro really makes for a unique drink. This is a rather filling beer and I was slow to drink it but it was very much a desert beer and I enjoyed it as such. Try it out, especially if you can find it on nitro."
""
""
""
"D/O: While the beer itself is neither unique nor particularly compelling, the mode of packaging is a conversation piece in itself. Nitrogenation keeps acidity tightly under control and yields this beer's single most appealing feature. Hopefully this next-generation nitro bottle technology will be allowed to spread because Deschutes Obsidian or North Coast Old Rasputin stouts could really benefit from it."

"A decent milk stout, though my expectations trumped reality. Looks OK, but the flavour lacks depth and richness, while the body is a tad insubstantial. It's both sweeter and less roasty than I anticipated. However, the aroma is awesome - tons of roasted malt notes to stimulate your senses. A good, easy drinking brew that goes down nicely; just don't expect a world-beater. Worth sampling."

"Overall: On one hand i enjoy the lightness. It's very easygoing. On the other hand it's not really that special. It lacks a bit of punch i enjoy with stouts. But having those around already this is a nice addition to the stout range, being the light and easy going one for some variation or for people who want to try an easy stout as an introduction to the genre. I almost tend to say this is stout for kids ;)"

"Poured into a pint glass. Pours black with a creamy, dark tan head. There is excellent head retention with some lacing left on the side of the glass as the head slowly dissipates. A little less than a finger length of head remains atop the beer. There are aromas of dark roasted barley malt, milk chocolate, and coffee. The smells are definitely indicative of what a stout should be. The taste does follow the nose with the milk chocolate, roasted malt, and coffee notes coming through. The flavors of this beer are well balanced. The body is full with just the right amount of carbonation. The beer is smooth and creamy. The drinkability is very high. This is an excellent stout that hits all the right notes."

"Cant say enough good things about this stout. Its gotta be my favorite!"
""
"This beer rocks. I have to admit, I went in thinking this beer would suck. It doesn't. It is loaded with flavor. I almost think it has more flavor than the Nitro. The Nitro is better, in terms of mouthfeel and just the overall experience that you get… but this one isn't far behind. I like it, and while I walk around the house saying, """Moo"""… bottoms up!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Deep brown pour, beautiful 3-4 inch head with extremely fine froth, fantastic lacing, with bubbles cascading up from the bottom - really top notch in the appearance department. Smell of roasted barley and brown sugar. Taste much the same though the malts had an odd bitterness that I felt detracted from all the other wonderful flavors going on here, vanilla, coffee, and milk chocolate. The mouthfeel was outrageously smooth, one of the smoothest brews I've ever had, would absolutely get again."

"O: I'm puzzled. I've has this beer before, and I don't remember it being this bitter at all. I doubt it has anything to do with the nitro, I just think I probably picked up an old bottle."

"O: Excellent Milk Stout. I could drink this all night."
"T: Over a very good drinkable and enjoyable stout that is easy drinking and at 6% ABV can be a solid milk stout starter for an All American Beer team.

""

"Overall-For fans of the style, it will be difficult to come up with a better example. This beer makes up for its shortcomings in the nose and eye with its stellar performance in the mouth. As advertised, this is the beer equivalent of a cup of coffee, complete with cream. Perfect for any season thanks to its rich flavor and heavy carbonation, but these go down way too easy, a trait that is certainly only a bad thing for those with a light wallet. 14/20"

The flavors here didn't develop as much on the palate and I was left with a slightly above average stout. This was really like a slightly better version of Guinness draught (which I am not a fan of)"

"Note: I tried the regular once earlier this year and got a better impression that time. Got more head, more lacing, better smell of mocha and mild roasty and leather. Got a roundness and a smoothness with a bit of a tart finish. Got mocha/roast on the palate with pipe tobacco and bit of sweet and flash of sour. Last time I thought it was interesting and good. Hmm."

"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass, bottled in December of 2011. Pours a dark almost black, with a one inch tan head, that leaves some lace. Smell is sweet chocolate, bread, carmel, and toffee. Taste is all of that, with chocolate and toffee being the main flavors, very smooth. Body is thin for a stout, o.k amount of carbonation, a little dry, and definitely drinkable. This was a little to simple and thin for me. I realize everything isn't going to be imperial size, but this was just o.k."

"Drinkability - You could gulp this down in two or three swallows it is so smooth and light in the cheeks."
"Smell and taste are good, but appearance and mouthfeel are great."

"OVERALL: This is one of Left Hand’s better regular efforts. The sweeter chocolate flavors balance the bitter coffee very well."

"O- A wonderful dark stout that reminds me a lot of a stout from Ole Peninsula up in Kalamazoo, MI. Great beer all around."
""
""
""
""
""
"The Coffee comes through pretty clear. It is a very nice mouthful, full and robust. The aftertaste is typical of a stout (for me), it leaves your mouth dry, waiting for another sip."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This was a bit of a disappointment. I will say the bottle says keep refrigerated and this was picked up on the shelf at room temperature at my local shop, so that may have been a bit of a detriment. While the appearance/aromas impressed me, it failed to follow through on the taste/mouthfeel. I would be interested in tasting one on tap."

"O: Solid. I'd drink this again, but whether I'd buy it or not, that would depend on what else was available."
""
""
""
"Poured into a nonic pint glass from a bottle. Midnight brown with a finger length of tan head. Nice lacing. Aroma is roasted barley, caramel malt, and a light woodiness. Taste is coffee, caramel, toasted grains, and sweet cream. Mouthfeel is thin to medium and lingers a bit on the roof of your mouth. Top notch milk stout."
"This is a really good stout. Doesn't have the depth of the big boys but has nice flavors and is incredibly smooth."

"Mmmm! I love a beer like this that is so roasty and malty taste that is not heavy in anyway. So much flavor and so much lighter in mouthfeel than the appearance would make it seem that makes this beer a homerun with BBQ, steak, or with any kind of hearty meal!"

"Milk Stout pours a black color with a small tan head. Their is a nice creamy milky smell. There is a nice smokey malty backbone, with a very nice creamy taste, very full flavor. Has a very full flavor, deffently not watery, like some other milk stouts. Overall a great example of this style, very enjoyable."
""
""
"this beer is a toast to all things malts. it is very good. finish is rather dry for my tastes, though i wont hold that against this beer."
""
""
""
"O: a decent milk stout, just didn't had the depth i had been looking for nor the complexity of the notes on the palate, everything just kind of tasted 'commercial'"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A really good beer. Very easy to drink. I'd love to try the nitro."
""
"Pours black with rich espresso head. Aroma of espresso, light malt sweetness, a bit of roast. Taste follows with a milky roasted chocolate espresso flavor that isn't too sweet. Light mouthfeel for the style, but that's what this is all about. Super drinkable. Very good stuff. This one can be had alongside the lighter beers on a hot summer day. Just a really fun brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very milky on first taste, and very sweet. Not that carbonated. Very, very creamy mouthfeel. Flavor is a little one-dimensional, but it's a good dimension! Kind of like drinking a malty three musketeers bar. Aftertaste is very similar to main flavors. No bitterness to speak of."
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste doesn't quite live up to the presentation, but it's certainly solid nonetheless. What could really have set this beer over the top for me is a fuller body. As is, the body feels loose and thin, not thick and substantive like I look for in a stout. Maybe milk stout is not the place to look for fuller body, but I would have quite enjoyed if there were something more to sink my teeth into here. On the other hand, it sure does go down easy, as my glass was finished in no time flat. Definitely a step above your generic nitro-gimmicked dry stout."
""
"M/F: The creamy nature of this beer is on par with that of Murphy's and for me was even better in terms of the chocolate and coffee character. The smooth finish is one of the best i've been lucky enough to get my hands on."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Not at all a bad beer, but slightly sweeter and thicker than I expected. However, if you're looking for a sweeter than average beer, this will do just fine."
""
""
""
"Pours an absolutely lovely pitch black with a dark brown head that grows in velvety softness as it forms from my extremely hard pour as instructed by the bottle. The smell is nice, dominated by gently roasted malts (no burnt or acrid aromas) and just a touch of caramel sweetness on the nose. The taste is equally pleasant, straightforward stout flavors of dark roasted malt with just a touch of sweetness with balances well with the bitterness. The mouthfeel is exceedingly smooth and this beer is very drinkable. Overall, I am not sure how they did it but this bottle compares very favorably to the times that I have had this on nitro tap. It is an extremely drinkable beer and I could easily have another."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Morey’s Bottom Line: It’s a bit thin, but the flavor is there. Pretty good example of the style."
"O - like it. Would reorder. Good finish to night of beers."
""
""
""
""
"O: a good beer, one I wouldn't mind having again for sure.... Nothing super crazy.... But a nice tasting very drinkable stout."
"O – Overall doesn’t work for me. Interesting idea with the nitro bottle, just wishing the beer was more impressive to my palate. Very different from what I was expecting and hoping for. The visuals are good, the aroma has promise, mouthfeel is silky smooth, but the flavor is unimpressive at best. Overall a fail…definitely a one and done for me."
""
""
"The texture is nice, but nitro really suits more substantial beers. Flavor-wise, the sweetness is accentuated at the expense of the stout-y flavors I'm looking for. I probably wouldn't pick this one up again, although I wouldn't mind trying it on tap just for the heck of it."
"O: A really solid, tasty milk/coffee stout that goes down very easy."
""
""
"Body is medium-thin with low carbonation in simulation of cask beer. Very creamy and smooth, as well as being extremely easy drinking. I enjoyed this a whole lot more than the standard milk stout bottle and could easily see buying this one again. I imagine this beer will have wide appeal as well."
""
""
"Well, it has good stuff going for it but for me the nitro takes away more of the good. It's got the aromas and the flavors, but they're not enough. It's so smooth that there's hardly any feel to it. I'm making it sound worse than it is. I guess it's just not my style."
""
""
"O: I haven't had a stout (or any beer) with this low an abv in years, and this is also the lightest, most """refreshing""" stout I've ever had, so I'm breaking form here, but 2 of my local distributors sold me on the beer, and I really liked it - not heavy on flavors, but almost like a milk shake beer - after all the heavy and imperial stouts I've tried - that are so heavy on ingredients and booziness, this was an extremely enjoyable change of pace. This does not have to be a """slow sipper""" - you can drink it with the same gusto you can pour it - enjoy!"
""
""
"Not as viscous as I expected, surprisingly! Still, that big, creamy, slick body makes me a happy BA. I could session the hell out of this beer."
""
""
"O: A light and tasty stout, would have liked a little more flavor and fragrance, however"
""
""
"D - It's alright. Nothing that is a huge turnoff. I'll pass in the future. Milk stouts generally have more to offer."
""
""
"O: The appearance and mouthfeel are probably the best parts of this beer. It’s very easy to drink and quite sessionable."
""
""
"O: An absolutely amazing beer on nitrogen. Unbelievably smooth and good. I go out of my way to find it now."
""
"O: Definitely better than the original Left Hand Milk Stout but not sure if that can be attributed to the nitro or other tinkering with the recipe. The pouring instructions seemed a little gimmicky to me. The beer was very enjoyable and definitely a beer I could enjoy more than one in a session."
""
""
""
"Though I served this a bit too warm (maybe 58 F), a found that is a very solid beer that gives Young's Double Chocolate a run for its money for half the price. I've had it on tap, and can say that it becomes even more drinkable when cold. Used this brew for our fraternities annual beer competition several years back. I think it lost to a Corona knock-off with added lime flavor - Oh well I guess there's no hope for some. I would buy this again."
""
""
"Advocate this."
"Poured Vigorously into a Stone Stout Glass, bottle upside down. Started as a 3 inch creamy head with beautiful cascading like a nitro should. Smell of roasted Malt and sweet chocolate. Tastes the same. Creamy goodness. One Fine Milk Stout. If there is such a thing as a sessionable Stout....this is it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall: Very nice, highly quaffable."
""
"Order at bar and pour into a room temp pint glass. Pours black with a large, frothy, off-white head. The aroma is coffee, malted milk, and a little smoke. The flavor is very sweet. The palate is heavy, creamy and smooth. Overall, this is a tasty and drinkable stout."
""
""
""
""
"Opaque dark brown beer under dense light brown bubbles. Good sized head fades quickly to a ring around thin patchy swirls. Aroma and taste are full of roasty coffee, medium-dark chocolate, caramel, and numerous thick sweet malts. There's a very light touch of orange citrus, some hop tartness, and creamy lactose sweetness. Excellent mouthfeel. Smooth, softly syrupy, and a weeee bit resinous or gritty. This is suck downable. I've had to pace myself to review this... Its also worth noting that this is a great example of the style."
""
""
""
"O: Much better than the regularly bottled version. Thicker with a better flavor profile, much more of a milk stout."
""
""
"a beautiful cascade pour - gradient from sand colored to black. 2 fingers of fluffy tan head released great lacing throughout. smells of roasted grains and coffee mostly. a very tasty sweet stout - hints of coffee and roasted grains, definitely tasting the sweet overtone of the standard milk stout with a nice mellow bitter finish. very rich and creamy, but goes down silky smooth. overall, this is a great stout. it's just as good as on tap - and better than the regular milk stout they put out (appearance mostly)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- very solid everyday milk stout."
""
""
""
"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled 2/15/2012. Pours clear very dark reddish brown color with a nice 2 finger fairly dense tan head with great retention that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some nice spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, caramel, cream, vanilla, and a touch of herbal hops. Nice and well balanced aromas, with good strength. Taste of chocolate, coffee, caramel, molasses, cream, vanilla, roasted malt, biscuit, and light herbal hops. Light herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, coffee, and vanilla on the finish for a bit. Very nice flavor balance and not cloyingly sweet at all. Quite robust feeling as well. Medium carbonation and body; with a very nice creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish present. Overall this is a damn nice and well rounded milk stout. Nice balance of flavors; and very smooth and enjoyable to drink."
"O - this is a good stout, nothing that knocks my socks off but definitely no negatives either. Certainly one that I could see drinking with some regularity"
""
"For being a widget-free nitro, this beer is impressively creamy and smooth. In the feel, though, is where I think a little more heft could have been given to this medium-bodied beer to put it at the top."
"This is wonderful full-bodied brew that I would recommend to everyone"
""
"The regular has more bite and this almost has too little. It's a great brew, but even warm there is not a lot (just very good) flavor."
"O- amazing head is still on the beer and I am about halfway done. Unfortunately that is by far the best part about this beer. To me the taste could be a lot more complex. Still a decent beer and I don't know if I have ever given a beer a 5 for appearance before. Worth a try!"
""
"This was my first offering from Left Hand and I was not disappointed. I thought this stout was exceptional and I would definitely recommend it."
""
""
"Overall - Really nice beer, amazing to pour and watch develop. Taste is light, smooth and very easy to drink. No booze comes out at all, makes this very easy to enjoy."
"o - always loved this beer on nitro and it does not disappoint in the bottle."
""
""
""
""
"Taste-Chocolate milk, roasty, coffee with cream, subtle caramel and toffee notes. Super creamy great mouthfeel. Tasty and very easy to drink. The look of a Guinness but with more body, creamier, with a sweeter, not as sour, taste. An """American""" Guinness if you will, with all due respect. Well worth a try."
""
"Overall, it is a great, creamy milk stout."
""
"Edit Nov. 2014. Merged listings for the Nitro and CO2 versions. Nitro version I gave a 4.2 overall."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is still the same milk stout I have come to enjoy at its core, but I am just not a nitro guy."
""
""
""
"Very smooth taste combined with a beautiful mix of coffee and chocolate aromas make this a frequent choice in our fridge and a new-found """old reliable"""."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - One of the best readily available stouts in my area. I didn't even notice it was 6% by volume. Absolutely no harsh or off flavors. It's a keeper."
"Pours a pitch black with a thick creamy looking white head about a half a centimeter thick that last the entire length of the beer. There are small bubbles streaming down the side while poured. The aroma is very pleasing, mocha, chocolate, roasted notes and vanilla. The flavor is very similar to the nose, mocha, chocolate, roasted notes. The big impact of the nitro can be felt in the mouthfeel, which is very creamy and the carbonation is low with a dry finish. The body is medium-light, which makes the beer very quaffable. Overall I really enjoyed it. I bought it mostly for the novelty, but I would probably buy more in the future."
""
""
""
""
"O: This was a well-thought out beer. It was made to look, smell and taste very good, without overdoing it on the ABV front. Had I been thinking properly, I’d have cooked up a nice steak to go along with this one. Maybe next time. Thanks for reading."
""
""
"Soft on the palate with easy creamy drinkability. If you can find this on Nitro, do it!"
""
"Comments: This milk stout will better suit the average beer drinker being not as sweet nor full bodied as other milk stouts or heavier beers. Left Hand Milk Stout gives you the body and espresso flavors without being cloyingly sweet."
""
"Overall this is an excellent beer. I always liked the non-nitro version and I think this is even better."
"12 oz bottle pours an opaque black with tightly bubbled foamy tan head. I missed the hard pour instructions, but even with a regular pour the head is quite large. Aroma is subtle dark roasted malt, more like a porter than a stout. Taste is sweet toffee, chocolate, coffee, and slightly smokey. Mouthfeel is creamy smooth, very nice aftertaste. If Starbucks brewed their own beer on site, I imagine this is what it would be like."

" * I'm comparing most milk stouts to Duck Rabbit's incredible example of the style. feel free to suggest others that may unseat the Duck Rabbit Milk Stout"
"Mouthfeel, as a result, lingers like the lacing. This feels like a dessert of dark chocolate's bitterness and a light glaze's gentle stickiness. Mmm. Time for another."
""
""
""
"O - a great nitro beer (if that is your thing) find this much better than the regular milk stout."
"ahh... let's just say its creamy silky smoothe dghjfisbcjsofnejvn"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: What can I say? Left Hand's Milk Stout is one of my favorite milk stouts, a great stand-by. The addition of the nitro carbonation kicks the mouthfeel and appearance up a half a notch, making it even better!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O- So good, it makes me weak in the knees. This is the only way to have this beer"
"12 oz bottle to glass. Poured hard straight down, tan head took a few seconds to build, very small bubbles, frothy. Slightly roasted smell. Mostly taste some bitter coffee and malt, a little sweet but not as sweet as other milk stouts I've tasted. A little alcohol at the end. Bittering lingers, more like a coffee bitter than a hop bitter. Not bad, but I wouldn't consider this a session beer, a bit too big."
"O- A damn fine brew if you are in the mood for an incredibly drinkable sweet beer."
""
"Blackish with some chestnut highlight at the bottom of the glass. Small, creamy head shrinks to a bubbly covering. Solid roasty, chocolaty aroma along with a good amount of creamy coffee. Chocolate roast dominant flavor. Sweet and malty, mild lactose, and vanilla. Quite tasty...one of those beers I frequently overlook, and wrongly so. Medium bodied and smooth. A quality Milk Stout all around. Not one to be ignored..."
""
"Dark, rich malt flavors were very pleasing. Roasted coffee, bittersweet chocolate, and that classic lactose sugar to bring out a sweetness not found in a classic stout."
""
""
""
"O- I do not want to drink this any more. Too much burnt taste evident and hops a bit on the high side. Probably rate this beer a 4 out of 10 for a milk stout."
""
"Dep, dark black with a2-3 finger thick, somewhat dirty frothy head...hints oc coffee...bitof coco, and touch a sweetness...soft, thick, velvety deel that slides down ones throat fairly easily....roasted malts, creamy feel, bit of coffee bean....with some sweet sugar presence...left hand milk stout = tasty w/ nitro or not...."
""
"Enjoyed at Stout NYC. Had on tap, it pours a rich very dark brown, dull white fluffy head. Scent is unassuming, yet did have some stout characteristics, roasted malts, chocolate milk scent. Taste was of roasted malts, only slight bitterness, no hops. Not sweet in any sense. The flavor was so enhanced by the creaminess of this beer, its best attribute. Smooth, creamy and easy to drink. Overall, a solid milk stout."
""
"(D)- A great stout for the style. Smooth, chocolatey, and well-balanced. . . move over Guinness!"
"Very drinkable, awesome creamy head retention. I must have killed this six pack within a day or two. Go out and get it...I will definitely seek this out again and may not turn back to the regular milk stout. Cheers!"
"O - I've only had a few milk stouts, and this is certainly the least interesting and memorable. Looking forward to trying the new nitro bottles though."
"This is not the type of beer I usually try. I have heard of it before and decided to try it. When poured it comes out clean with a 1/4 inch of head. The color is murky brown, almost like a dark chocolate milk. The appearance needless to say was nice. There really was no smell to it that I noticed. The taste was surprisingly not as bitter or dark as I would imagine. It was not overbearing and had a creamy milky taste, but just slightly. It was refreshing. It left a little taste after drinking it but nothing overbearing. Overall I enjoyed this beer. It's not a typical stout and I would recommend."
"Overall- I think its awesome that an actual accessible craft beer company did a nitro bottle. Hopefully more companies will follow along, it adds some variety."
""
"Overall: Moar. Much moar. Will return to store forthwith."
""
""
"Not a bad beer and a really cool idea, but the body is a bit light and the flavor isn't as pronounced or as complex as it could be."
""
""
""
""
"O: well Left Hand certainly achieved their goal of recreating the nitro experience at home minus a widget. There is some debate about if this is a positive or negative thing for the beer, for me it's neutral... The mouthfeel is nice, but I think there is an undoubtable sacrifice in the aroma department"
""
""
"This is really fucking good. I’ve always been a milk stout fan, and I was a bit concerned that the whole nitro bottle might be more gimmick than substance, but they really did it-this is as good as any beer I’ve ever had off a nitro tap in a bar. Bravo Left Hand."
""
""
""
"Good pour with a 2 finger creamy chocolate colored head. Retention was okay. Smells of a hard smokey coffee smell as well as a hint of chcolate and dairy. Taste is similar to the smell. Starts off with a plain coffee taste which fades into a smokey taste. Rich roasted malts. Thick mouthfeel leaves a pleasent coating in the palate. Overall this was very enjoyable. Definately a good stout which deserves a thumbs up."
""
""
""
""
"O- Not sure if this is complex or a great acheivement in brewing, but it sure is delicious. I could drink this every day."
"Well, it goes to show you what structure means. I like this version much better than the other. A whole different dimension. A very drinkable stout"
"O- Easy to drink. Wish it were a little heavier and more carbonated."
""
""
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a very dark brown, appearing black with a one finger fine light brown head with good retention. Aroma of dark and roasted malt, chocolate and lactic acid. Flavor is chocolate, dark malts, like a very mellow, lightly flavored chocolate milk. Flavor is very pleasant and well integrated, but tastes somewhat thin and almost watered down. Medium bodied and nicely appropriately creamy. What flavor is present is quite nice. Could be a superb stout with a bit more intense flavor."
""
"O- I'm a big fan of milk stouts. Left Hand's milk stout has always been one of my go to beers and is probably one of my favorite milk stouts. I've had the regular Milk Stout bottle and the Milk Stout on Nitro-tap. The Milk Stout Nitro-bottle definitely lived up to my expectations. It was very similar to the regular Milk Stout bottle but a little bit creamier thanks to the head and was pretty comparable to the Milk Stout Nitro-tap. Will have to compare the regular Milk Stout and Milk Stout nitro simultaneously to really compare the difference and make sure this isn't a gimmick. Overall though I'm impressed and would consider buying this beer again."
"O - Nothing too crazy, very very well balanced, pretty drinkable. Lactose sweetness compliments the roastyness nicely - lactose and body are much improved after letting this warm up a good bit"
"Almost opaque black beer, up to light is proves to be clear and red. Light tan colored head with decent retention. It actually has minimal carbonation, which I prefer on darker beers. Smells is modest as a result. Mild dark malt aroma. Clean yeast profile. Mild roasted flavor - a slight burned toast quality. It seems like most of the sweetness is the lactose sugar and not caramelized maltose from grains. Mouthfeel is remarkably smooth. True chocolate sweet stout. I really enjoy this beer. 6% ABV goes unnoticed in flavor. Really unique drinkable beer. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
"Pours nearly black with a one-finger, extremely thick, light coffee colored head. Great lacing throughout. A quarter-inch head maintains perfectly thick and formed throughout. Aroma of subtle roasted chocolate as well as some milky chocolate notes. Really nice sweet and silky smooth flavor. Milk chocolate sweetness leads it off. The lactose in the beer gives it a refreshing chocolate milk flavor. Hints of roasted malt and bittersweet chocolate notes before more sweet milky chocolate flavor at the finish. This beer is true to the milk stout name. The nitro bottle is definitely cool as well and adds a very silk like smoothness to the beer that could only perviously be found on draft."
""
"This milk stout pours a black color with just a speck of head. Its` nose has cream, vanilla, some coffee. Taking a sip and a taste of moderate roasted malts comes through, more vanilla and cream. its` pretty tasty. Mouthfeel is soft, finishes smooth. This is a tasty beer and I believe would work well as a """gateway""" beer to introduce some macro swiggers to craft beers."
""
""
""
"O: This beer is much better now that it is injected with nitrogen. It just adds so much to the beer and I love it. One of the easiest drinking beers ever."
""
"It's an amazing Milk Stout and it got even better with the nitro. I could finish a 6 pack in an evening without thinking about it."
""

"overally better than average beer but i really liked the river horse beer a bit better i will keep trying more samples from this style to see how it goes"
""
""
""
"Looks good, smells good, tastes good but the mouthfeel keeps this from being really good. I'd drink it again because of the flavors and the low ABV will allow me to drink more than one."
""
""
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass long neck bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a Pilsener glass."
""
""
""
"This is heavier on the roast than I'd like in a milk stout but it's sweet with out being sticky and has a very nice body."
"Overall good but I thought it would be evern better. Not bad though. Tasty."
""
"O - would recommend to friends, very pleased"
""
"Dark brown to black colored beer with a super tight knit head. Smells of coffee and caramel. Taste is full, rich, sweet with notes of white chocolate and coffee. Mouthfeel is full and with pleasant after-taste. Mildly hopped with little bitterness. The nitro makes the beer feel a little heavier and creamy."
""
""
""
""
"This is a great alternative to Guiness and I will definetly buy this beer again. The only knock I had was it was a little thin, but all in all a good beer."
""
"Overall – A nice sweeter stout of more moderate alcohol content. It makes it a very easy drinking session brew."
"O- this stuff is great if you like Guinness and the regular milk stout you will love this beer. i love how left hand left out the widget. i could see myself drinking this beer everyday"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm really happy they've figured this one out--the regular Milk Stout is something I feel mildly positive about, but this brings it to another level. With the sweetness and smoothness, I think my non-stout loving friends might even like this--I'm definitely bringing my mom some the next time I go to see her."
"Average, but not for me."
""
"O - highly recommend this stout to any stout fan, will definitely be enjoying this one again."

"This beer looks and smells soo good I could hardly wait to taste it. However, it's too sweet and loses all the great smells when I start drinking it. All the roasted, toasted, coffee I was excited about turned into sugary off-tasting fruit. It's not bad but I'd rather be drinking something else."
""
"12oz nitro bottle with a simple, slick, black label. Hard pour as the bottle indicates, reveals a near black ale topped with a huge, pillowy brown head that retains a good half inch throughout the drink. Aromas are chocolaty with some roasted malt. Mouth-feel is unbelievably smooth - velvety and full-bodied. Tastes are milk chocolate, brown sugar, with a slight roasted finish, but is mostly sweet on the finish. Overall, great experience, but in the end it's Milk Stout with a nitro kick. I will say, though, that Milk Stout was one of my gateway beers when I was first introduced to craft beer, so it does carry some nostalgia with it for me. Great to try & I would buy this again."
""

"Similar chocolate and mild coffee flavors, dry with a light sweetness at first, and mild roast in the middle. Very smooth and creamy feeling, but also a bit flat. Sort of like an English stout on cask. Milk chocolate, lactose, very mellow coffee that imparts little to no bitterness or acidity. Overall it's not wildly different from the regular version, though it seems every tap in town is nitro at the moment anyway."
"Overall - Perfect entry into the world of stouts. Not aggressive. Very palatable. If you find many stouts too strong, this is the one for you. A very friendly beer."
""
"This beer has a lot going for it- roasted malt and coffee aromas and taste with a pleasant lactic sweetness. Slight caramel on the finish. Appealing dark opaque appearance, but no head or lacing. My sample has little carbonation, and skimming through the reviews it seems mine wasn't the only one. This would be a stellar beer if not for this one, big fault. Would certainly try another sample."
""
""
""
"Overall among my favorite milk stouts, can't wait to try the nitro version."
""
""
""
""
""
"P.S. It is beautiful when poured vigorously into a pint glass and This one is easy to find in Chicago as of right now."
""
"At least with Guinness there is a cascading effect with the creamy head. The appearance, aroma, taste, and mouthfeel are worsened by the nitro."
""
""
""
""
""
"It tastes like a desert, its sweet and delicious yet very drinkable."

"Pours black with a nice mocha head. Aroma and flavor follow suit and are both great; roasty, coffee, chocolate, cream, and some lactose sugars. Great mix of roasty, sweet, and some bitter (i.e. think coffee like bitter, not hoppy). A fuller, creamy mouthfeel. Overall, the beer that got me into stouts. As good today as it was back then."

""

"A sweet and surprisingly mellow stout, my first milk stout. Too low carb for my tastes, almost comes off as flat. Better than your average stout."
""
""
""
"O: One of the best milk/lacto/sweet stouts I've had. I've recommended this beer to so many people, I've lost count."
"O- Good stuff. I don't drink LHMS very often but I like the idea. I would prefer it on the nitrous (tap) pour though."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Perfect entry into the world of stouts. Not aggressive. Very palatable. If you find many stouts too strong, this is the one for you. A very friendly beer."
""
""
""
"O: 4"
"Poured into a pint glass this brew oil slick black with nearly the same consistency. There was almost no head to speak of even with a moderately aggressive pour. The aroma was deep of burnt malts, caramel, chocolate and coffee. Not much of a hop presence at all. The taste was deep with good bitter chocolate, coffee and even some sweetness in the finish. Nice thick body with light carbonation. This brew was nice and above average but doesn't jump out of the crowd."

"O - A very nice beer that I would love to have again. Nothing mind blowing but very solid enjoyable flavors that are well balanced."
""
""
"Good session beer. Would like to try it in a bottle because it's definitely caseworthy."

"One of my favorite milk/sweet stouts, as it's not a style I am particularly fond of--but I like this."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: its not a powerful one, so its easy to drink, but I feel like I'm not getting enough taste."
""
""
""
"O: This is a really good milk stout. It has a slight edge over the Lancaster Milk Stout as far as appearance and smell go. I like the taste of the Lancaster one a lot, but this one has an exceptional mouthfeel."
""
"Would recommend"
""
""
""
""
"Dark pour with a tan head - little bit of light gets through. Looks real tasty. Chocolate, subtle roast, some coffee in the aroma. Real creamy taste - definitely 'feel' the milkiness to it. Love the chocolate tones. One of my favorite standbys."
""
""
"Creamy like a guiness even though not from the NO2 tap or Nitro bottle. Says its about 160 calories and not very bitter only about a 23 in IBU."
""
"Going to take another crack at this one, but on nitro this time. Served in a true pint, the beer is jet black in the depths, with a good, bright, ruby refraction on the edges. The foamy, dense head is no joke, and after the cascade, it settles in to a good half inch of beauty. Aromas are heavy on the dark roasted coffee, with a hint of cocoa nib. The beer is ridiculously smooth in mouth, but a little light for the style. Flavors are blended much better than out of the bottle, with the coffee foundation giving rise to some creamy sweet overtones and a subtle vanilla highlight. This beer clings all over the glass. Overall, there is a much better balance and progression on nitro. The aftertaste is light roasting and deliciously sweet, with a smooth, creamy finish. This beer was built for a nitro tap."
"Overall: The mouthfeel is weak but the flavors are very nice. Not bad at all."
""
""
"My appearance and aroma scores might drag down this beer a little bit, but of the three beers, I think this one fits the style best. I'd like to try this beer from a nitro bottle, but I haven't been able to find any Left Hand products on Long Island."

""
""

"Would love to track down the nitrogen pour of this beer!"

"Overall I thought that this was a slightly above average Milk Stout. All the nice flavors that I remembered showed up but they were much lighter and not nearly as robust as I remember them being, but the lactose sweetness still showed up as I remember and it was just the right amount. This beer has pretty good drinkability, it goes down smooth, isn't thick, but the lightness of flavor would bore me, after one I am ready to move onto something else. What I liked most about this beer was the aroma, it was just as I remember and was pretty damn good. What I liked least about this beer was the taste and mouthfeel, the flavors were much lighter then they should be and the mouthfeel left a lot to be desired. If I knew this was fresh I would buy it again, but I will be leery about buying this with over a couple months age. I recommend giving this a try, its a good example of Milk Stout, but make sure it is fresh. This beer wasn't as great as I remember and I think most of that has to do with the age, I had to hold it right up to light bulb to see the date and even then it was pretty smudged and not easy to read. You would think four months wouldn't hurt this beer that much but it is pretty obvious that the roast flavors faded quickly in this beer. I am going to try and get a fresh bottle and re-review it but I think that Left Hand needs to date their bottles better, when it's fresh this is a great example of a Milk Stout, but with four months on it it turns into something that isn't that impressive. As far as I can tell this beer needs be treated almost like an IPA and consumed fresh for best results. I checked the website and they don't tell you how long this beer can last, which sucks, I hope the nitro bottles make to my area soon, I bet this beer would be great in a fresh nitro bottle."

""
""
"M - Medium bodied with light carbonation."
"Smooth and creamy roasty chocolate when it's freshly poured when it warms up the roastiness pops up a little more. Black as night with a crimson outer glow. Great head and it keeps it all the way down. Nitro tap is the best way to enjoy the famous left hand milk stout. Probably my favorite stout of all times. Or top 5 at least."

"One other point... I brought back 2 of these from a trip to colorado... only one made it back in the bag, the other broke. I dont know if this was due to over agitation in the car ride home or not, I'm just wondering if anyone else has had this problem."
"Pours a black color. 1/4 inch head of an off-tan color. Great retention and slight lacing. Smells of sweet malt, roasted malt, hint of chocolate, and hops. Fits the style of a Milk / Sweet Stout. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with a low carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, hint of a roasted malt, hint of hop, hint of chocolate, and a hint of pale malt. Overall, decent appearance, great feel, and good body."

"If somebody wants to know what a milk stout is supposed to taste like, drink this beer. It has a nice roasted/chocolate flavor that accompanies a creaminess. The carbonation is light so as not to distract from the depth of flavors contained in this beer. It is one of my personal favorites."
"Picked this one up at my local bottle shop. Poured heavy into a pint glass. Nice cascade effect, but not as pronounced as I imagined. Once I realized there wasn't a widget in the bottle, I was impressed with the cascade action. A creamy, wheat bread colored head sits on top at about 1 1/2""". Not much aroma coming off of this one. Mild coffee scent. Taste is somewhat sweet and toasty. This beer is super smooth. I could drink this stuff any time of the day. Superb mouthfeel. This beer is approved by me."

"This is an exceptional beer and it's a shame that it is not a more common style."

"Overall: it hink it is a pretty good milk stout. It is not overly sweet like some of them. Highly recommended"

"Cost: $2.50 for a single 12 oz beer, or $10.99 for a six pack."

"I like this one. It's a good milk stout that's not too sweet. The burnt notes really add some balance where hops usually would."

"Pours a black with absolutely no head despite a rough pour. Not sure if I have an old bottle. No date that I can find anywhere on the bottle. Smells like very toasted malt and coffee with a little chocolate. Taste is sweet up front with very roasted dark coffee and a moderate bitter finish. Does'nt taste flat despite no head. Not an unpleasant beer but probably won't buy again."
"Pretty well made stuff. And uh, its a nitro bottle, so the mouthfeel is supposed to be thinner guys. Dee duh dee."

"I think they're onto something here. A great drinkable stout, now creamier and more fun. Just plain drinkable."
"The Left Hand Milk Stout was on tap at the Kendall Pub in Yorkville, IL. The beer poured into a standard pint glass and was a dark opaque color with a creamy froth head that laced nicely. The smell is sweet choclate and roast with hints of espresso and a touch of alcohol. This beer tastes amazing. Sweet milk chocolate and roasted coffee, mixed with a touch of dark malts. A great mouthfeel makes this go down very, very smooth. This is the perfect session beer for me, it's not watery, nor is it too heavy. Overall I love this beer for every reason: it's beautiful to loo at as it goes down, it tastes awesome, and it's not too heavy at all, even at 6%."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Light-medium bodied, with quite a bit of carbonation; very smooth and creamy. Overall, not my favorite milk stout I have tried by any stretch. Had heard some good things about this but not super impressed."
""
""
""
"This was my first time trying anything from Left Hand, and I was quite pleased. Just from looking at it after poured into a pint glass, I could tell it was going to be a creamy and smooth blend. I couldn't pick up too much of a scent, but the flavors that came through were that of a light malt roast, and wasn't too rough on the tongue. Very sweet and tasty brew, and overall a strong milk stout."

"I had a sweet pint of this exciting concotion at the """Spotty Dog""" in Hudson, NY. It was a very creamy, sugared, milk, dense stout who's flavor resonated in my mouth for hours after the pint was gone. I thoroughly enjoyed this one and would absolutely have another pint if I came across it in the future. A+"

"Overall: This is a nice milk stout. A new style I am trying to get accustomed too. Still plenty more to try out and I am sure I will have a few of these when I will be going to Denver in a few days. Still looking for a little more sweetness of this. Still a good beer though."
""
""
"I remember back before I turned 21 and hadn't had much to drink other than swill and jungle juice at parties, people would tell me that Guiness was like a meal. I was so dissapointed when I finally had a Guiness. It was thin and watery and sour and kind of lame. This is what I imagined guiness would be like based on other people's description. Just good; nourishing for the body and soul."
"O - Worth a shot if you get the chance. Wish they could improve the price point though. I guess someone's gotta pay for all that rumored R&D."
"Overall - It's an absolutely solid stout. While the flavor isn't quite as rich as the smell is, it still a great stout that's very easy to drink and easy on the mouth too."
"Overall: I have to say, it's possible I had a bad bottle (though I didn't detect any of the normal indicators of a bad bottle) but this stout was not up my alley. It had a very watery mouthfeel and taste, which may just be the style, but again, not for me... at all"

"Again this is easy to drink. I believe the nitro takes away some bold characters that the roasted malts add. Still a tasty milk stout but I would want a little more bold roasted/dry notes."
"Served: 12 oz. bottle poured into my brand-spankin’ new Duvel tulip glass. Love this glass. Bigger than I thought it’d be."

"It came out with a nice looking, creamy offwhite head about 2 fingers deep. It doesn't have really much going on as far as a smell goes, maybe a lil' chocolate, coffee and roasted malts present. However, what it lacks in smell, it makes up for in taste and mouthfeel! It's a creamy-smooth and sweet beer that's almost like drinking dessert or like beer mixed with milk and coffee. It has profound coffee flavors with some caramel, chocolate and roasted malts present. Hardly any hops are detected. I love this beer, one that I will definitely get again. If it had a better nose, it would probably be in my top five."
""
""
""
""
"O - I'm a fan of the milk stout. This one is good."
"O-the flavors really come through and leave me wanting more the only downfall is the lack of smell from this one, if it smelled as good as it tastes it would be great"

"Enjoyed this beer. Seems like it is a higher ABV than marked though, but maybe that is just my imagination."
""
"Overall / Drinkability: I am beginning to think this is a old bottle, but there is no way to know for sure. I've had this before and I remember it as sweeter and creamier, but, I had it as part of a tasting with cookies and I suspect the sweetness of the cookies colored my memory of the beer. So by itself, not bad, but not outstanding either. Given all the other reviews rating this beer higher I'm going to chalk my review up to a bottle that either didn't set on the shelf in the store well rather than one that was past it's date, and I'll have to review it again sometime to see if it really is the beer, or the flavors depend upon what I'm eating with it."

"Very light with the nitro. Almost whipped cream like texture. Easy sipper. Very drinkable brew, but almost a bit watered down tasting.. maybe the nitro?"

"Tastes a god sight better. It's very nitro creamy, and that accentuates a sweet beginning of chocolate and maltodextrin, which moves into a bittersour roasted barely and ends on a combination of light, dry hops and lingering milk sugar. Mouthfeel is superb."

"Left Hand claims that they have been working on this bottled nitro for years. They've accomplished a nice effect without adding any internal nitro gadgets which would have made recycling more difficult and added to production costs."
"D - This beer was very good before, but the nitro took it to the next level. Almost exemplary for the style. Give it a try."
"O: well all can go by is my taste buds, but this bottle version is night and day over the draft, maybe I just need to find another place to try these on draft, maybe....then again maybe I just hate draft beer. I do then to like bottles version better. Anyway I would buy this again. nice beer."
"Overall, the Milk Stout was awesome, and I hope to have it off a nitro-tap again."
"If you've never had a milk stout on nitro just do it.. man o man"
"Overall an average beer that is better from the nitro tap."
"O: Nothing else to report."
"Overall, having Left Hand Milk Stout nitrogenated was an interesting experience. The positive was creating an amazing mouthfeel that fits perfectly with the style. However, the downside was the """Guinness effect""". Using nitro with the beer made a lot of the roasted flavors very mild and tame. In the end, I think it would be worth a try if anyone comes across it."
"Fresh off a nitro tap, this is a black color with a nice densely packed tan head. The smell is pretty light, but its of roasted malts. The feel is medium, slightly thin for a stout, but nice and nitro creamy. The taste is pretty good, not very heavy, some roasted malts with a sweet milk sugar finish, very light on bitterness."
"This is the beer that I like to describe as Guinness' sweet little sister. The lactose keeps this beer sweet and that is what keeps me coming back. It is almost like a creamy chocolate milk, but with a slight hoppy bitterness at the end. The nitro really adds to the creamy nature of the beer and is a must when it comes to this beer. I have sampled this out of a bottle and with a nitro-tap. Huge difference. The bottle version is ok at best while the Nitro-tap is very, very nice. I enjoy Left Hand and am not disappointed with this beer. The brewpub is definitly a stop on my next Colorado road trip."
"O: Not a bad beer. Not too sweet, and an easy drinker."
"D-Incredibly easy drinking and very easy to pair with food. Has some complexity, but isn't overwhelming in terms of flavor."
"o - a solid beer all around. very drinkable and enjoyable. will certainly be buying more of this for the coming winter."
"O - It is a simple beer that is well made. Not a lot going on in any category, but nothing to complain about either. I could drink this often, even during the summer."
"Overall it is a nice beer and I am glad I got my hands on it.."
"Overall: this was a silky smooth stout. Very enjoyable and I could probably drink several pints of this and not get tired of it."
"Overall this beer is worthy of the Brewery hype. They're touting this as one of the great modern beer innovations, and claim it to be """taking America back""" from foreign beer tyranny. I fully expect to one day see this beer in every bar where Guinness currently stands."
"O - Left Hand has taken their Milk Stout, a benchmark for the style already, and elevated it even further. An exceptional beer, the smooth, creamy feel works flawlessly with the robust roasted flavor of coffee and chocolate. I don't know that Left Hand's process is """revolutionary""" but it's certainly not a gimmick. It's straight-from-the-tap-like nitro without a pesky widget. Don't pass up this Milk Stout!"
"Conclusion: Huge success. This is better than I expected, and I like it more than the regular version. The first bottled nitro-stout produced on U.S. soil. A giant claim to fame I say, and not just s gimmicky stunt either- this beer is quite tasty."
"Overall: solid beer, wasn’t too impressed by the smell but it tasted pretty good; though the flavors were somewhat subdued. It gives the impression like you’re drinking a cold café con leche. Good dessert beer."
"My non-beergeek buddy described this as """Guinness meets Starbucks""". I thought it was pretty accurate."
"I could've bought this as a sampler, but instead I bought this as a 6 pack. I don't regret this move at all. I probably finished this glass a bit too fast than I thought I was going to. This is a Stout that is an easy knock back and damn it's delicious."
"Overall, a good one, but not my favorite."
"This is a good beer. Go buy it."
"Pours dark brown, impenetrable, some amber at the edges when held to light, fine head, color of coffee with too much cream. Smell is roasted malts, sweet caramel, some grape. Taste is overall sweet and roasted; caramel, roasted, some coffee, some sweet grape. Mouthfeel is heavier, some carbonation, smooth. Overall this is decent. Sweet and roasty. I probably will not buy this again because the flavor strike me as a little weak at times. Still this brew fills the style and is enjoyable to drink."
"Overall: Very tastey and easy to drink. The consistancey is just like milk. Love the aroma and taste. Cheers!"
"O: A very solid stout. Lots of sweetness, along with the dark roasted malts and a nice balance of hops. There might be (and are) better stouts out there, but this is definitely better than many, and a very good one."
"O- Very easy drinking milk stout, would be a great dessert beer. Great offering from Left Hand."
"O. A great milk stout. I'm not a huge stout fan, but anytime I see this beer around in the mix a six section I always grab a couple!"
"Overall: I love the stouts, especially the RIS style. Left Hand makes an excellent beer that, to me, could qualify as a """session""" stout. As a matter of fact, I'm gonna pour me a second bottle. I wish this came in a 1/6th keg on the east coast. This would definitely occupy one side of the dual tap kegerator. Well done Left Hand, well done..."
"O - Very well balanced example of a milk stout. Nothing is too in-your-face screaming """There's milk in here!""" but you can tell that it is. Does a good job using the milk to improve the base stout rather than making the stout entirely about the milk."
"had it on a nitro tap at illegal pete's in denver. i have enjoyed this one countless times from the bottle, but thought it might work well on the nitro. i was mistaken, their tap system must have been off, bartender didnt even charge for it. came oout totally flat. with that in mind, i'll review this beer as from a bottle, because it is excellent normally. pours a shiny dark brown color with a thin tan head. nose is sugary, creamy, and deep. taste is sweet from the residual milk sugars, and robust from the dark roasted malts. you might get a cavity from drinking too many of these, but its a very well made beer. one of the better milk stouts out there, just stay away from the nitro tap at pete's!"
"Quite well done. I was skeptical at first, but I really enjoy this very much. Lets hope that the prices on this stuff are going to remain low once it rolls out into the rest of Left Hand's markets. I'll likely visit this again at that time, or order up a nitro poured pint at a bar."
"O: Not a bad milk stout, though the smokiness was a bit strange."
"O - not really sold on any milk stouts yet but a nice basic starter"
"I drank this stout from a frosted pint glass. It was an overall sweet taste with none too much AA% for a milk stout. It's an excellent dark dessert beer with a brown head. One thing I could not shake was a very light hint of a metallic flavor. The beer was bottled 3 months prior, so it may have been from the age and bottling process, but overall I still enjoyed the beer and it was definitely worth it's money."
"Overall: I liked this one a lot but then again I like most milk stouts."
"A little off the path of a standard sweet stout, but I appreciate the uniqueness."
"Overall it's not bad but the overly burnt flavors detract too much for me so I don't think I'll pick it up again. A shame, really, because otherwise this would be a very nice winter beer."
"Overall, I'm going to have this again when I can. Not something to drink a lot of regularly, but a very good beer."
"Overall: I enjoyed this beer, stouts are my favorite style and this beer had nice carbonation and good balance of the cocoa/coffee with the hop bitterness."
"Medium body though it leans a little fuller. Good light effervescence enough to keep it from being cloying. Finish is a touch watery. A very nice beer."
"Medium bodied with good carbonation, this beer may seem a little light, but is just right for the style in my opinion. The body is very drinkable as it coats your mouth well but does not become sticky. The carbonation is not very noticeable but is definitely helping to keep this beer's drinkability up. Overall, this beer has a very slick mouthfeel that allows the flavors to manifest and evolve over appropriate amounts of time."
"O: First time I had this beer on nitro tap. Would have again on nitro. Could use a little more of a complex taste and a thicker mouthfeel."
"O- Overall, the nitro really saved this otherwise relatively weak stout."
"O: This is a good beer. A bit subdued on aroma and flavor, but definitely easy drinking. Worth a shot."
"Tried this for the first time tonight in a 12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. A sixer was 10.99. Pours dark dark brown more like a robust porter than a stout with a wonderful nutty coffee smell. Taste is quite malty and nutty with a slightly sweet finish. Very drinkable and very tasty. I like this beer a lot. It would be great with a dark chocolate or chocolate covered cherries. Kind of a """dessert beer""" but seasionable as well. Very good."
"Pours jet black with a paper thin head into my ccb snifter aroma of roasted malts, caramel. Almost like roasted marshmallows. Taste follows the nose, sweet but not overdone, finishes roasty and a bit dry making me come back for more. Very delicious, my go to milk stout"
"pours as a brown to dark brown look with a head. This very nice creamy malt taste. This is a very good drinkable beer. This is a very good beer. It is a very balance beer in taste. It is always with dessert. Ice cream and cake etc. I really love this beer."
"Pours a dark reddish/brown color with a one finger tan head. The aroma is cafe con leche. I don't really get any chocolate notes, just coffee with cream and sugar. The taste follows suit.It's slightly sweet, but the sweetness is balanced by a nice roasted bitterness. The mouthfeel is surprisingly light and so is the body. Carbonation is minimal. This is a tasty beer and is enjoyed best for dessert or with with dessert."
"O: This is one of the finest examples of the style. A great valued six pack beer that I could drink all night long. I can't find much of a flaw."
"Pours a deep, dirty oil black, with minimal creamy tan head and fair lacing. Aroma is of a malty earthiness, with nuts, coffee, and a hint of vanilla. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Taste is also earthy, with a nuttiness on top of some strong coffee flavors and a hint of hops. This is overall lighter than some stouts but very good indeed."
"Overall it was a great representation of the style and I will be enjoying this beer many more times in the future. I seem to remember the first time I had this, it was better. This might be due to freshness."
"My first experience with Left Hand doesn't blow me away, but it's a great, simple beer to just sit back with and relax with. It delivers on the sweet side, which I always enjoy in a stout and is incredibly drinkable."
"-Overall 3.5: A pretty good stout. The """milk aspect""" is an interesting part of the whole experience, but has little bearing on the stout itself. This is a beer that one should try if they have the chance, but it is not recommended as a session beer."
"overall ehh... it was ok not a bad beer... just nothing spectacular... nothing separates it from anything else and if you compare it to something else its most likely lacking. unfortunately i think i have been turned off to the Left Handed Brewery."
"Overall- I was very impressed I've now had this on nitro- tap, draft and in bottle and love it each time! Cheers"
"Delicious beer, good drinking experince."
"O- What's not to like?,it's quite enjoyable and reminds me of a beer version of a milk shake. Will definitely have again."
"D: Its sweet enough that it's not very drinkable for me, I'd stick with one."
"I've had this beer on tap and out of a bottle, and nitro is the way to go with it!"
"O: Pretty well balanced stout with an excellent creaminess and mouthfeel."
"One of the greatest Stouts that I've ever had the pleasure of drinking."
"This is one smooth, easy drinking brew with the highlight being the mouthfeel. It's nice if you want a sweeter stout."
"Overall, a very good stout that I will certainly go back to again."
"Very much a sweet chocolate dessert, good if you're into that."
"The logo of a Red Left Hand makes me wonder if these brewers are from the O'Neill Clan of Ulster? The recipe could be based on Irish sweet stout!"
"From the first sip on, I love the balance. It's sweet, definitely, but not cloyingly so. And the chocolate notes are there, more milk chocolate than bitter/dark chocolate. (note: I'm pairing it with a square of dark chocolate and some Redemption Rye to boot, per a suggestion.) I like my stouts to have a full body and this doesn't disappoint. Makes me curious as to what trying it on nitro does."
"O: Usually I'm not impressed by milk stouts but this one definitely made me reconsider that. Well done Left Hand Brewing."
"O: The standard for milk stouts. It doesn't get much better than this, for the style. I have had quite a few other lactose/milk/cream stouts that just don't measure up to this masterpiece."
"Overall Drinkability - Perfectly smooth and round. Very flavorful but with no off flavors. Absolutely great beer."
"I poured this beer into a chilled glass mug. The head was inconsistent from bottle to bottle. I had six of this particular beer. About three of the bottles form about 3/4-1 inch of very dark brown head that lasted only a minute or two. The other three gave head (giggity) similar to what soda is like whenever it is mixed out of proportion with its syrup. I still do not know whether this is part of the Milk Stout style or if it was just on the shelf for a while. However, whenever there was head left, it always left lacing...which was done beautifully. There was always the opportunity to lick a bit of head off the side before indulging into the creamy body of the beer. It smelled of dark malts, chocolate, and perhaps a bit of coffee (though not strong but accented mos def). At first, the taste was a bit underwhelming, but this is my first “Milk Stout.” The added sugars (lactose) give it a much creamier quality that I am not used to and suspect is more of a cult taste. And so, judging the taste, I must allow it to be what it is; not something that I have a strong affinity for at this time. However, the body of this beer was full, creamy, and has a definite flavor as if it were going for an imperial kick, but the “milk” attempt sort of neuters the necessary risks needed to make this more than a slightly above average beer. At times, it even seemed watery, and so if it is supposed to be “milky” it is skim milky. In my mouth, it seemed to sag and have a heavy sensation on my tongue. If it were going for a milk sensation, it definitely accomplishes this goal (it was quite different for me). Overall, it seems that it is a good stout with excellent flavor (however a bit simple I suspect), but the “milk” thing seemed to underwhelm me; because the bold flavor seemed to be neutered by the attempt to be milky. I don’t take any dairy in my coffee either. So, to be fair, I will give it a slightly better grade than what I think my taste grades it by. If I ever find this on tap, I will probably try it again, but I will probably never seek out a bottled version of this any time soon. I suspect the possibility that the lactose may have compromised some of the beer’s integrity while it was on the shelf. I look forward to trying more Left Hand brews, because I hear that they are incredibly creative."
"O: A good milk stout; nothing crazy, though... I’d like to give the bottled version again to compare."
"O: Tasty smooth drinkable beer that was quite enjoyable and worth having another."
"Poured the bottle into a pint glass. The beer poured a deep opaque chocolatey brown. The beer had little to no head and what it did have was a light brown and dissapated quickly. As I tasted the beer left rings of lace that stuck to the glass. On the nose I get sweet caramel and chocolate. The stout has the typical mouth feel a milk creamy sensation that coats the mouth like a sticky fatty rib dinner. The mouthfeel doesn't fade I have a constant think feel in my mouth. The taste is just as the smell dictates. Lots of chocolate sweetness, with a caramel note to finish. I have no quarrels with this beer I like it a lot and will have many in the future."
"Overall I tend to drink this semi-regularly when I am in the mood for a sweet stout and when I don't feel like busting down my Moloko stash. Good offering for an all year round milker."
"Medium body, nice smooth mouthfeel. Overall, a good stout but nothing too special. I think I would get bored with it fairly quickly."
"O- A good decent milk stout. One thing I'll note is that it is the middle of summer and over 100 degrees here everyday. Not exactly stout weather. This one is refreshing and delicious regardless."
"I highly recommend this beer for anyone, but especially for someone who wants a full flavor beer without being overcome by bitterness."
"Overall, this is a good milk stout, and would make an excellent introduction to anyone not familiar with the style, as the flavors are easily palatable and delicious."
"O- Not a bad beer at all, and my favorite of the Left Hand regular line up to date. It is, in my opinion, overpriced at almost $12 a six pack locally, and for that reason I am not a regular purchaser of it."
"Get it back!"
"The mouthfeel is extremely creamy, and this goes down so smoothly. That being said, there is also a good carbonation sting on the tongue. This is medium bodied, I was looking for a slight bit more in the body. Overall, a great brew. Something that is great for anyone, even if they don't enjoy stouts. The sweetness makes it enjoyable for people that can't stand the bitterness of other stouts and it is enjoyable on a hot day or a cold day."
"O-a standard, decent milk stout which doesn't distinguish itself"
"Milk stout is a very good beer. Smooth with a slight sweetness and no bitter taste. Very good mouthfeel with a thick creamy head and good head retention. It is slightly bland but it dose have a good malty flavor making it an all-around an excellent beer."
"This was a good beer. It looks dark with a small tight head, almost like a nitro stout. Raisin/creme/chocolate in the nose. The taste is amazingly smooth. Indeed, the mouthfeel is perhaps a bit too smooth (very little carbonation) even for a milk stout, and that comprises my only complaint for this beer. A tasty stout that I can count on."
"O: While tasty (relatively speaking), this beer did little to wow me. The low abv, was just another check in the con's column as I wouldn't necessarily choose to drink this beer for pleasure, and it really wont suffice to drink it for effect either."
"Poured from the tap into a pint glass. This beer was dark, creamy and looked like a cup of dark chocolate. It could look like chocolate because it tastes like chocolate, the flavor is sweet but not sickeningly so. The mouthfeel is delightful as well, it's incredibly rich and like a beer milkshake."
"A solid, drinkable milk stout. Becomes much more enjoyable as it warms."
"Poured a very slow to emerge trace of a head. Body is a muddy dark coffee color. Smell is roasted malt and cocoa. Taste matches smell plus is a little sweet. All in all it's a nice and enjoyable stout but not a standout in any way. This was a bottle sample and I vaguely remember having this as a draft in a bar and enjoying it more."
"Pours a very dark amber color, almost black except for when you hold it to the light. Has a nice little tan foamy head. Smells mostly of chocolate & roasty malts. Reminds me of chocolate milk. Tastes roasty upfront with velvety layers of chocolate, dark candies, a little cocoa, and slight caramel sweetness. The mouthfeel is excellent. Tastes like a milkshake. No hop flavor or aroma, just some slight bitterness to keep this one well balanced. A little dry. A very nice stout! Perfect in the winter or late at night with some cookies."
"O: Left Hand Milk Stout is a tasty, lower abv beer, but it does not seem to fulfill style requirements very well. "
"overall, i found this to be more than palatable, though i wouldn't get too revved up about chasing it down."
"Cellar temperature seemed ideal as the flavor just kept improving as the beer warmed a bit after coming out of the frig. A bit of sweetness there, but the roasted malt is still the predominate flavor and aroma. Creamy with an excellent mouthfeel as well."
"O: Excellent beer. You really can't get any creamier than this beer. This is my first beer from Left Hand Brewing and if everything is at this quality, I will surely be coming back for more."
"I've been hearing great things about this beer and grabbed one at the pub/coffee shop that also happens to be my study spot. It's rich and dark, but not overpowering, so it's still enjoyable in the georgia humidity."
"Not much else to say; it's a milk stout, and probably the benchmark all milk stouts are measured by. Only Flat 12's come close for me - and F12 is local, so I drink it more often."
"Overall- A decent offering from left hand that does not stand out in any way."
"This isn't a favorite style of mine, but this one is quite enjoyable glad I decided to try it out. Not my favorite but certainly better than most milk stouts that I've had."
"O: Very good stout, first milk stout I've had, and I'll be back for more of this style."
"This beer poured out as a deep black colored liquid with a thin tan head on it. The lacing is very minimal. The smell of the beer is chocolatey and roasted. The taste of the beer has a really good creamy lactose flavor to it. The beer is sweet but it's well balanced. The mouthfeel is pretty good too, the body is between medium and heavy. Overal this beer is pretty good, I would drink this one again for sure."
"O: Overall I'd say it's a good beer. It is a very simple milk stout."
"O - Nice sweet stout with plenty of dark liqueur overtones."
"D- I could drink a couple of these, not too heavy and alcoholic enough that i could easily split the 6 pack with a friend. Next time i see this on draft i will try it!"
"Feels smooth and thin. The nitro really smooths it out, but not sure that's for benefit. Probably a good dessert beer with some ice cream."
"Had this beer several times and have never been disappointed. Plus, my wife has always liked this beer so that always scores with me. It pours a standard dark brown but with little, really no head at all. The beer smells good, tastes good, and """milk""" is deserved in the title. This beer is not one that will make your draw drop, more of a solid player that will never let you down. I recommend without reservation!"
"o-solid brew, I think this is the best LH has to offer."
"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a 1 inch beige head that fades to a small cap that lasts. Nice foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of roasted malt and chocolate milk. Taste is of the roasted malt, slight coffee beans, and dark cocoa powder. Mild roast bitterness on the palate quickly fades. Due to the nitro-tap this beer is very thick and creamy. Overall, this is a very good milk stout that I would get again. My first beer from Left Hand."
"O: One of my favorite beers. The thicker the better. A beautiful ebony brew."
"Very smooth and silky overall, couldve done with a touch less of carbonation - but I am definitely not complaining. Solid stout in my opinion!"
"Overall: Very good beer...the only thing throwing it off is a thinness that is uncharacteristic of the genre. Otherwise, superb."
"Overall: Very good. More of a desert beer than something I would drink on a regular basis, but it is rather good."
"Drinkability: Not overly heavy or bitter, which makes this one a good milk stout to session with. Good flavors, but none overwhelming or heavy. Overall, a decent milk stout."
"Overall - Milk Stout is a the perfect name for this beer; the body is paper thin, the complexity is middle-of-the-road, and I prefer to drink this straight from the bottle"
"Overall Impression- """Nothing better than a Left Hand Milk Stout on Nitro""" I've heard for the last two months after I talked about the Left Hand stand @ the Microfest. After enjoying this for the first time on nitro-tap, I couldn't believe this beer! Almost like a overly sweetened and frothed Cafe Mocha. I couldn't enjoy many of these back to back but would get very full. Having these two were perfect tonight! Prost to all those pushing me to get this on Nitro."
"Overall: Absolutely my favorite stout. Maybe I am a sweet stout person but honestly I tend to steer away from any sweet beer. This one has me hooked. Highly recommended and I imagine most absolute on-tap. Prosit!"
"This is the 2nd cream stout I've tried. It's also the best cream stout I've tried. This is a style that I seem to have """got""" easier than many others. Since more of the character is what didn't ferment to alcohol than what did, I'd rank this as a sessionable choice despite my previously stated preference to bigger items. Chilling with a few milk stouts works for me in the sense that the base flavors tickle the proper buttons. I've had better, but not in this category."
"Drinkability: Very Drinkable if you dig the style. Reminds me a lot of Youngs Double Chocolate Milk Stout, but this one has a little bit more going on in complexity and flavor, I actually like it a better. Great After dinner Desert Stout."
"The look of the beer didn't seem very creamy, it seemed more like a stout instead of a milk stout. The smell I get is bitter chocolate and coffee milk. the taste was automatic sweetness, it was more whip cream taste than a milk taste, it had very mild roasted coffee aromas. I think this is a great beer, it just needs to be drank at a higher temperature but not room temperature that's too hot."
"Overall I am really surprised by this one. I have had many offerings by Left Hand and most of them are down the middle for the style, so when my local Safeway started a new Craft Beer section and offered this for $11 a sixer I thought I would give it a shot. Very glad I did because this was very enjoyable and in my opinion a must try!!"
"One of my go-to lower alcohol beers and one I find myself grabbing a lot when I want a stout that won’t blow the doors off my palate, too."
"Overall another beer I will have to pick up at the Estate at least a six pack. A damn fine milk stout."
"O: Overall a pretty good beer, not enough breweries make these type of stouts in my opinion...pretty good beer."
"T - Good drink, but needs more body and more flavor; I'd recommend this to a beginner trying to get their feet wet in the culture of beer flavor"
"Its taste profile isn't the most interesting, but it's a milk stout through and through, and if that's what you're in the mood for, Left Hand does not let you down."
"Overall I would say this is a very good milk stout and definately worth trying if you are tired of the same old run of the mill stouts."
"overall, a very good beer and very drinkable. The sixer it came it proclaimed it as """the best stout in America""" so I obviously had high hopes going in. Having just tasted another stout before this one, I can say in my opinion, their sixer box lies. A good drinkable stout, but not one I would go out of my way to get my hands on again."
"The specs stores around houston are pretty much universally carrying this now. After much debating I gave it a try on the recommendation of a friend. It reminds me very much of a solid chocolate stout made with chocolate milk. While that may seem a bit off putting at first it's actually not once you try it. This has a rich and full mouth feel, solid chocolate and milk notes up front with a slight sweet and bitter chcolate milk finish. Overall bitterness is very low (I would guess 30-40 IBU), but balanced. This is not something you pound a whole six pack of, but it's great to have in the beer fridge for an occasional treat."
"I'm surprised I have never tried this one before. I don't have very strong feelings about it one way or another."
"At 5.2%ABV, I could drink this all night. Superb drink-ability and killer value. Yeah, I'll buy this again."
"Overall? This is by far the best stout I've tasted to date. Good in a bottle, great on tap."
"D- 4 This is an impressively consistent brew all around. I appreciate how well in line its aroma and taste fall; I found no surprises between the two. While I have had more interesting stouts, I must say that this is one worth falling back on. It has a nice sweetness that is well-balanced by just enough hop presence, and is light enough for the style that I could put down a few of 'em. I'd recommend and most likely buy again."
"VI) Concluding thoughts: I actually really liked this one overall. I have had only a handful of cream stouts and this has to be one of my favorites."
"Overall a tasty beer. Felt the nitro may have killed the smell but it was still a good beer."
"D- Overall, a tasty stout. Not something I would trade for since it's not available in my state, but I'm definitely ordering a pint if I ever see it on tap while I'm traveling."
"O - Not bad, probably would be a good beginner beer. A bit sweet for my taste."
"O/D - This is a decent beer, but it lacks the level of taste complexity that my palette is accustomed to. I don't think I'll seek this out again specifically, but I wouldn't turn it down if I was offered a pint."
"l"
"O - This could be a great intro stout for those that aren't into the darker beers. It inspired me to brew a milk stout myself, so it must have been good!"
"D - Very drinkable. The flavor is really nicely balanced and smooth. Could have used a touch more flavor, but it is far from empty and the flavors are quite nice."
"D: Easy to drink, lite bodied makes this one you can drink a few of. Paired well with my smoky BBQ ribs"
"O - Overall a good beer, I'd try again and again, but again not my favorite stout."
"All in all, not a bad milk stout. It is tasty and easy to drink. I do like milk stout and, sadly, I have trouble finding good examples of it. It seems that beer drinkers who really like stout tend to reach for the heavy, more complex imperial variety over this rather unappreciated style. I guess this one will have to do until I can find something better. Poor me."
"Overall: A fairly decent milk stout. Nothing memorable but definitely solid."
"Very drinkable and sweet/milky beer with no big surprises, just malty milk which is fine at first but becomes a chore gulping down the last couple swallows."
"O: I wasn't super impressed with this one. Not terrible, but I've had better milk stouts. Could've been the bottle, so I won't write it off just yet."
"My rating (above) would be altogether different for a bottled sample (probably all """average"""), still a good stout, but without that nitro head (and whatever possible effect the nitro might have on the body), not nearly as attractive to me."
"I poured this beer (bottled on 4/21/11) into a pint on 4/29/11. It poured a lovely dark brown to almost black with a fingers worth of thick, creamy-looking, tan head. I noticed the coffee first and foremost in the scent with just a hint of sweetness. This beer was very smooth in my mouth with a strong roasted coffee flavor. The finish seemed to have a citrus hoppiness to it. As I drank, the lacing around the glass was exquisite all the way to the bottom."
"Overall, this is a very enjoyable light stout. The fact that it is 5.2% is a bonus, as it is actually fairly refreshing for the style that I could have several of in one sitting."
"O: It's a nice, unique stout - I'll give it that. In the future, if I'm looking for something rich, thick, and milky, I'll have a Guinness."
"Overall: The better of the 2 Left Hands I've had."
"***Edited for spelling***"
"O - Excellent stout. Super smooth and extremely light which is totally unexpected looking at the fluffy head. I highly recommend this stout."
"Taste is delicious! It's a creamy, smooth mix of bittersweet cocoa, milk, and some roasty char. An easy-to-enjoy treat, and here's to hoping this brew isn't limited."
"Sweet and round, though at this ABV, not really to style. Nothing offensive, but not particularly complex either. I've gotten more interesting sweetness and creamy body from other milk stouts."
"Easy to drink. The lighter body suited me just fine after a huge Easter dinner earlier today."
"I usually switch over to wheat beers in the summer as they aren't as heavy but this is a stout i can see leaving in the fridge for the right high temp occasion."
"O: Higher expectations for a milk stout. Seems Porterish to me, just add some licorice to it and call it good, for a Porter that is."
"This was a decent milk stout, though I thought it was a bit more thin than it should be."
"THis is good tasting slightly sweet stout. The smell has hint of chocolate,but its not to strong.Of course the appearance is black with a small tan head. THe taste is like a smoked chocolate milk,very smooth and enjoyable.The is a really nice stout overall. With a label that is memorable as well."
"The beer is dark brown, almost black with a thick filmy tan head that stuck to the glass. The smell is big on coffee and milk chocolate with some roasted grain. It tastes of coffee, cream, chocolate and earthy hops. This beer is very smooth with a medium body and moderate carbonation. The finish is nice, just a little dry. This is a great stout, it's well balanced and almost like velvet."
"Overall, a decent beer. I have had this on nitro and really liked it. Bottle, it is okay. Decent drinkability."
"Poured a muddy dark brown with a very slight red hue. The light brown head was suprisingly small yet frothy, which dissapated quickly with only a small residue remaining allowing for a fair amount of lacing on the glass.The aroma was nice and robust with a moderatly strong scent of dark bread malts and a sweet doughy yeast with hints of milk chocolate, molasses and a strong coffee presence. It tasted lighty sweet and flavorful with molasses and chocolate notes from the onset, then ended mildly biiter-sweet with a wonderfull strong note of coffee that lingered on the palate for a nice long while. Mouthfeel was creamy in texture and overall feel with the body being medium to full. Both were balanced very well and worked quite well together. Overall an excellent stout. Blending of the flavors was without a doubt perfectly balanced, although it could have been just a tad heavier in body."
"O: a nice stout.. not overly sweet though.. drinks more like a traditional stout rather than a milk stout.."
"***Overall I would definitely recommend this beer. This beer hits all of the senses and will have me coming back I'm sure. It's uniqueness by using milk sugar without being overwhelming in any one feature flavor keeps me asking for more!"
"A fairly decent representation of the style, nothing to get your panties into a bunch, I would like to see LHBC do a imperial version of this to see if they have the chops to pull it off, they are on the right path with this."
"The low ABV makes this an easy drinker. It also works even better than Guinness when mixed with vanilla ice cream to make a beer float."
"this beer has a great color and smooth taste. From the moment the smell tempts the nose to the sweet and smooth taste, it is a good beer to compliment just about anything! I enjoyed it with chicken quessedillas and it was a great compliment. i could see serving it with anything off the grill too!"
"O, as advertised... a subdued stout. A calm brew for a session but nothing to pick off the shelf if you're looking for something interesting."
"This beer pours almost black with a bit of dark ruby showing through under light. It's aroma is primarily chocolate with a hint of burnt toast. The flavor is complex and well balanced. It begins with dark chocolate followed by a note of coffee which fades back to chocolate. The mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy, a filling beer. Left Hand Milk Stout is a very good beer, a good example of the style. Highly recommended!"
"Overall, I love this beer and will be buying a lot of it in the future. It's not too heavy so I can enjoy several in an evening, but its texture is so creamy that I don't want to just slam the stuff."
"Overall this beer is not as appealing to me as other stouts, but I didn't find it to be terrible."
"M- Its all very smooth, comes on thick like good milk but leaves clean. I love it and think somebody interested in stouts should try this beer. Love it!"
"Overall this is a decent beer. It is rather drinkable, I just wish it was more pungent."
"Overall a very nice example of the style. Tastes great and goes down easy!"
"Mouthfeel - Too much carbonation for my liking but just past that its smooth sailing the rest of the way."
"My first beer from Left Hand Brewery, this one seems to be a real winner. Try it sometime!"
"O: This is a good stout to take to a party or have a friend check out who isn't the biggest fan of stouts."
"O- Very enjoyable beer that drinks very smooth. Delicious creamy mocha flavor that matches the aroma. I wish I could have enjoyed this with some chocolate cake."
"Overall - Very quaffable brew I could see this as a session beer anytime."
"over all I found myself enjoying this beer but by the end of the bottle it was hard to remain excited. I'd give it another try in the future, but not overly exciting."
"D: Great session stout. Blows beers like Guinness out of the water. The silky smoothness of the beer, with zero bitterness, makes this almost like drinking milk- yet stout. Perfect for any occasion."
"This is a pretty straight forward milk stout with a strong roasted taste and smell. If that's what you like you'll enjoy this beer."
"A thoroughly unexciting """milk stout""". Really not that much there."
"Finish: Sweet milk chocolate with a subtle maltyness"
"O: Good representation of a milk stout."
"O- Nice big body for a 5.2% beer, great complex flavors which develop through the sip."
"Overall: This is a good beer. I could easily just keep sipping away at this stuff. It's pretty delicious."
"Overall: For some reason, this beer has been a popular draft selection in random restaurants around here, so I've probably had dozens on draft. This is the first one I've had in a bottle and actually taken the time to geek on. Turns out, my previous impressions of it as a decent, sweet stout are about right. Nothing to write home about, but good."
"D: A friend suggested I try this and I fell in love with this beer the moment I had some. The bottle version was more milky tasting than the one I tried on tap. Either way, it's a versatile beer to have at any time of the day, in any mood."
"I usually don't like milk stouts but I was intrigued by this one. It looks dark great head nice black body to it in the pint glass. Smell nice pleasant malt not too sweet. The malts seem more robust as I taste them the beer is more complex than an average milk stout, still kinda sweet at the end but not too much. Solid feel I think it lingers okay nice carbonation. Overall for lighter stout I say this is pretty good a solid beer for a style I usually don't seek out."
"The first sip gives you the flavors you expect: lactose and strong malts. It is easy on the palette and therefore very drinkable. I would like to have had a less stronger lactose taste but that is just me. Otherwise a very good beer that is enjoyed to the last drop."
"T: Pretty much all roasted malt. A bitter coffee finish with maybe a hint of hop bitterness as well. Mouthfeel was a little too light for my liking."
"D-This was my 1st ever stout(besides guiness) and man did i love it! it kick started my love for stouts. I would get this any night that is going to be a stout night. A good starting beer as it has a good flavor but wont be over powering with flavor."
"D: I am not a huge stout or milk stout fan, for that matter, but I can see how many people really enjoy this beer as it goes down so easily and without effort due to its smooth mouthfeel."
"Awesome beer. Really outstanding and nice to drink."
"D: A fine brew from Left Hand -- maybe their best everyday type of brew -- smooth and consistent and a fine session brew no doubt."
"My aggro pour resulted in two fingers of thick deep-tan head with great retention. Color was a deep brown with ruby highlights at the edges. Nose had a roasty dark chocolate quality. Mouthfeel was medium with a smoky/roasty/dark chocolate flavor on the tongue. It was a bit sweet for my taste, more of a dessert beer IMHO, but eminently drinkable. Great lacing began to appear and was evident throughout. Finish had a very pleasant smoky dark chocolate taste."
"This and the sawtooth are my top 2 from Left Hand so far. I've only tried 5 or 6 of their beers so far though. Looking forward to more."
"Overall, tasty brew that goes well with a burger I had with it...though a few aspects were underwhelming. Did like the sweetness of this stout though."
"D: i could down these pretty fast as its a good session brew. one of my favorite milk stouts!"
"D-Just not a beer I'll be seeking out."
"As it is it's pretty average, but drinkable. Decent nose and mouthfeel, but not as much roasted character to counter the sweetness as I would like."
"An all around average beer. Seems to have the right amount of sweetness and bite, but it lacks depth. There is a slight coffee flavor, as well as a a hint of chocolate ... but nothing else as far as I can tell. Certainly not bold enough to encourage me to purchase another one."
"Drinkability: A perfect beer to pick your spirits up. Multiple doses recommended."
"Delicious brew but big body combined with massive taste profile and sweetness lends itself to limiting drinkability. Like sugars on the food pyramid, tastes great but use sparingly."
"Notes: Not too bad of sweet stout. Cheers."
"D: Fantastic. The brew is unique, and layered in it's flavor, though not too complex. I just wish it was a bit less carbonated: My only criticism. Love this beer."
"Cheers"
"Pours dark dark brown with massive off white head that sits nicely. The lacing coates the glass and sticks with each sip. The nose really doesnt offer much on this one. A little roasted malt with a tad bit of coffee. Thankfully, the taste is bringing more to the table. Creamy roasty goodness with faint coffee and cocoa tastes. A bit of smoke outlines the brew throughout. Very creamy and rich mouthfeel make this worthwhile for sure. Super drinkable on top of that."
"Drinkability of this Stout is very nice with a good taste. A notable brew. If you are a Stout lover a must try, if not..."
"Milk chocolate roasted sweetness. Some vanilla coffee flavors and a nice mellow roasted bitterness. A big thickness but goes down extremely smooth."
"I enjoy variety in my beer and this is a tasteful and pleasant beer to enjoy, but probably not something I would keep in my icebox in the future."
"Pours a dark, almost but not quite black, brown with a tan head. Head is fairly small, leave a little lacing.Smell a bit like coffee and hints of caramel. Taste is chocolate, faintly roasty and some kind of malt. Mouthfeel is some what heavy and silky smooth. one stout i would buy from time to time."
"D: This one is would be easy to drink 3-4 of . A bit light on the body that I think affects the flavor, but it's still very enjoyable. Nothing too amazing, but worth the try."
"Overall a decent milk stout, but nothing too special. Would like to see what else Left Hand has to offer."
"I went to a bar out in the berkshires to go to a DFH rarities promotion that was being held (huge DFH fan). I had world wide stout for the first time there and liked the LF milk stout much more. I highly recommend this beer to any stout lover. You will not be dissapointed."
"This beer pours a very dark color with a small head. I love the taste of milk stout. Chocolate with hints of coffee. I have not had anything I don't like by left hand, so if you have not tried their beers, do yourself a favor and pick up a bottle or 12."
"Pours a dark, dark, almost but not quite black, brown with a tan head. Head is fairly small, dissipates quickly and doesn't really leave any lacing. Scent is coffee and hints of caramel. Taste is milk chocolate, faintly roasty and sweet malt. Mouthfeel is heavy and silky smooth. A good stout that doesn't have that cloyingly sticky finish that some do, which makes it very drinkable."
"Drinkability: Most definitely will drink this beer again."
"D: This is certainly disappointing because of its lack of complexity and body. It is akin to a weak chocolate porter."
"Dark brown/almost black in body with cappuccino head. Aroma of cocoa, slight coffee, cream. Tastes of cocoa nibs, cream, slight spice. Medium-heavy body with light carbonation. Great mouthfeel on this beer, definitely the standout characteristic. Nice subtle flavors and easy drinkin."
"As my score indicates, this is a good stout in all categories; a very quaffable stout for a late, cool winter day."
"not too strong that you cant drink a few. Very smooth is all i can say really about this beer."
"This was a solid milk stout. With a strong malted aroma followed by hints of coffee and, chocolate and a pinch of fruit. Balanced malty flavor with a strong dose of coffee, very mild hop aftertaste. First pour out of the fridge was a bit too cold and carbonated. Let this one breathe for about 20 minutes minimum before you taste"
"Poured a nice dark brownish black with a thin tight tan head that dissapated quiclky. The smell upfront was roast coffee and hints of roasted grain and semi sweet chocolate. Taste is sweet malt upfront, chocolate and a bit of roast from the grain and small bite from the hops. Mouthfeel is very smooth and light not as heavy as I would have expected a milk stout. Drinkability is high, very good brew not overpowering but nice and sweet like you want a milk stout. Not the best milk stout but good."
"The flavor a little more, fortunately. Sweet and lactic notes buttress an espresso-like bitterness. Cream notes mingle with the coffee, slight hint of herbal hops. The finish is pretty wet and sticky. Far from bitter, the sweetness dominates the day. Not bad for drinkability, but I wish Left Hand would have stepped up and brewed a more challenging brew for this style."
"Overall this is a nice beer with some good taste that I will drink some more."
"D: A very delicious brew. Very balanced for what it is. Certainly one of the best sweet stouts I recall having. A winner."
"Dark brown in color with no head. Felt thin in comparison to the hoppy pale ales I am accustomed to. Overall a good beer--lookIng forward to the drinking the remaining 5 bottles!"
"M/D) Thin to medium body. Not incredibly smooth, but not crisp either. Very drinkable beer."
"Overall this is a pleasant beer. The flavors are not in your face and are instead nice and reserved. This makes for a nice light dark beer which won't overwhelm you."
"Midnight black, no light gets through. Thick, creamy, pale tan head. Very cool looking beer. Strong roasted malt smell. Extremely thick and creamy beer. Not quite, but almost, the consistency of milk. The roasted malts aren't overpowering and are blended well. I think there's a tiny hint of hops in here too. An extremely drinkable, enjoyable beer."
"I'm fairly new to this style having only tried 3Floyds Moloko previously and I have a definite preference for that beer. The mouthfeel was so much creamier. Without Moloko being available in my area, I find this milk stout to be a good alternative I could drink fairly often. Makes me want to run out and grab some oreos."
"D - Meh. It's just boring. Taste isn't bad but I find myself wanting stronger flavor."
"When I first got into craft beer I liked this beer quite a bit. After 7 years my palate has changed but this is still a solid beer. Nice flavor, easy to drink."
"This was an ok beer in my book. I enjoyed the choices of flavors a lot, but it was all watered down and made the experience less enjoyable for me."
"give this a try) Mix about a 1/3 of a glass of youngs double chocolate with 2/3's of Left hand Milk stout... you get a beer lovers version of Chocolate Milk! Awesome!"
"D - Finished off a 12 oz bottle pretty quickly. I really enjoyed this."
"Drinkability: Color me impressed. I did not expect much, but Milk Stout has proven itself as a tasty and deserving treat. Though not spectacular, it is very well crafted and drinkable."
"Really liked this one and I will be picking it up again. My first offering from Left Hand as well, I enjoyed it!"
"GRADE: A-/A (possibly even an A+)"
"Coffee with lots of cream is the first thing that comes to mind for the taste, also getting dark chocolate and molasses. Some grassy hops. Slight vanilla. Silky mouthfeel although a bit over-carbonated."
"D: A very sessionable stout. I could sit down and have 4 of these no problem. Great stout on the sweet side of the spectrum."
"Drink ability is good. Despite the piss-poor appearance, this is a pretty good sweet stout."
"The mouthfeel was a little thin for a stout, but the carbonation was adequate and at 5.2%, the drinkability is nice."
"Note: Tried a nitro bottle and found it to be of similar quality. Not as nitro-esque as a Guinness nitro bottle per se, but still in the same style. Enjoyable, though the score would remain the same."
"D: Definitely a very drinkable beer. I wouldn't call it sessionable though due to the sweetness. Seems like after 2 of these I wouldn't want anymore."
"can drink these all day, is seemingly heavy and yet very very smooth--btw-the web-site says these are 6% abv,anyway very very very good!"
"pours dark, with thin quickly dissipating head. aroma is pretty meh. not much there. smooth slightly creamy taste. a little thin. roasty chocolate taste.pleasant taste and easy to drink, but just a little too thin for a top score. not too complex but still enjoyable."
"Drink: This is a pretty easy drinking stout."
"d: The only thing stopping one from drinking it all day is the 6%. Goes down smooth and delicious."
"One of the better milk stouts I have had. Definitely worth a try."
"D: Decent beer but nothing special that I probably won't be getting again for a while. Really didn't do anything for me."
"12oz bottle. Pours a very dark brown with zero head. No lacing and virtually no carbonation. Aroma is very sweet. Chocolate, molasses, some vanilla and coffee aromas. Taste is a vanilla/coffee mix. Not a very powerful coffee taste, more on the light side. Kind of tastes like a coffee with cream and sugar in it. Mouthfeel is on the thin side. A bit disappointed by this offering. Left Hand makes a lot of good beers but this one is alright. Not bad, not great."
"Overall:	Enjoyable beer and a good representation of its class."
"While I don't have a lot of experience with milk stouts, since they are rarely made in California, which is a shame, this one was just right given the cold winter weather that night, and it was after dinner. Overall it was a like a chocolate milk shake, but it was a beer, so more enjoyable."
"D - I don't like so much milk stouts but this beer is in line with the style so is a good drinking!!"
"Pours a light dark brown/black with almost no head. This beer is a little too carbonated for a stout. Aroma is of roasted grains and sweet malts. No noticeable hop aroma. Flavor is ok, roasted grains and lactose sweetness. The body, however, is way too light for this style of beer, and even seems lighter than the 5.2% abv. Perhaps it's the high carbonation? Whatever it is, this beer is a """stout light""" and doesnt compare well to the best examples of the style."
"The body was good, solid and smooth. Drinkability was also good, the beer went down smooth and easy. Overall, I'm not that impressed with this beer. It's not bad by any means, just kinda bland and unmemorable."
"Full of toasted malt with a tinge or milky sweetness. Definitely coffee and a tinge of requisite bitterness, creating a nice balance, although not a full flavored as I've come to expect from this style of beer. Love the full body and drinkability of this beer overall, and it was a good match with some tremendous pizza."
"Bottle. Bottled 9/22/10. Poured into a tulip glass a dark brown color with what start off with a tan head that slowly settles to collar around the glass and leave a nice lace. Milk chocolate aroma along with some leather and the slightest notes of coffee. Medium mouthfeel with a milky smooth textrure. Sweet start with notes of chocolate and ending with a slight bitterness. Minimal leather flavors as well. The milk sugar really makes this a smooth and velvety beer."
"Drinkability - This is a pretty good Stout. This could be a real nice session brew. Could be a good introductory Stout also. It's very easy to drink and doesn't overwhelm the palate. It's nice for a snowy evening."
"Heard very good things and had to try, poured into a pint glass. Rich dark coffee in color initial aroma of roasted coffee, a lil cocoa and slight dairy smell to mellow. Pours w/decent carbonation but nothing crazy, head dissipates quickly. Wow what a stout, good body, great mouth feel, not too sweet not to watery or bland great beer through and through and balanced enough to enjoy a sixer on a hoppin' night @ a shindig. I will be getting again and telling friends. Did not disappoint in the least."
"Left Hand Milk Stout, poured from a 12 oz bottle. A rich dark chocolate color, small head forms and then dies. Aroma of malt and some cocoa. In the flavor, milk chocolate, lactic sweetness, a good roasted malt body. Mild coffee taste. Not too sweet, a pretty well balanced and well crafted brew. Medium bodied, smooth and uber drinkable. Overall this is a pretty good beer."
"D - not my favorite style, though this is a solid, if not safe representation. goes down easy enough, and works well as a one and out nightcap."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This beer pours very dark with around a 2 finger head that quickly dissipates. The aroma is sweet and earthy, with some roasted aroma. The taste is quite nice, in my opinion. Roasted, sweet, and very smooth. I'm not too familiar with stouts/milk stouts, but this was a little more thin than I thought it would be. On the plus side though, I could see myself having a few of these easily."
"wow, not sure I would call this a stout. there just isn't any depth to this beer and I can't handle the heavy smoke flavor. no, this is not drinkable and I wouldn't have it again."
"D-I thought this was a really good stout. I could drink this all day. Will look for this again."
"D - One was enjoyable. Didn't want another."
"This is a fantastic milk stout, one of the best of the style I have had. This brew is really, really sessionable. A truly great beer."
"Tried this bottled at a Pub after I had a Guinness, it was recommended by the waitress and it was very nice . Afterwords I decided to buy one from Total Wine to see if it was the beer or the location, at home like at the Pub it was nice, just short of great for my tastes , nice."
"Over all though it was a pretty good drink for a cold snowy night infront of the fire with some chocolate truffles and dried fruit."
"All in all a very good example of what a Milk Stout should be. Not to heavy so I could polish off a couple in one seating. A great session Stout."
"Clear Dark, brown color, not much light. Thin, dark tan ring around edge of glass. Big, creamy chocolate and roasted malt aroma, with a coffee notes. Very thick texture to the mouthfeel, but flavor sits very lightly. Biscuity finish and aftertaste. Very light dryness to finish. Almost a cola flavor to middle of the drink. Carbonation does not last very long. Very watered down effect of flavors in the end. AS thick as the consistency feels the flavor is not near as heavy. Roasted malt flavor in after taste, lingers for just just a bit. Flavor comes across on the thin side especially considering the heavier aroma. Very drinkable though. Nothing special, a very basic stout."
"D- Delicious and smooth, very drinkable at 5.20%ABV."
"Drinkability is awesome. Smooth, sweet and simple. I could easily have had at least another couple of bottles of this stuff. Great tasting milk stout at a good price point. Well worth the purchase. Bravo, Left Hand!"
"Dark beer, although not as dark as others. The tan is white bud fades rather quickly, but there is decent lacing. The smell is of coffee, chocolate, and hit of roasted malts. The taste is chocolatity, coffee, and a nice roasted character in the back. This beer has little carbonation, so this makes the brew a little dense but nice and smooth. Goes down easy but not one to have every day or to pound."
"D- Too drinkable. Awesome stout. Alcohol dangerously hidden."
"Drinkability- I loved this beer, but it's definitely not an every day beer for me. I am sure to be buying this again very soon, just probably 1 or 2 from the pick 6 instead of a 6-pack. Amazing beer. Great beer Left Hand!"
"Slainté!"
"I like my milk stouts a little sweeter, and a little creamier, but this is certainly a solid example of the style, and satisfies my hankering for a milk stout on the occasions that I want one, as it is pretty readily available. Pours dark walnut brown with a somewhat thin head that fades to a thin ring. Smells somewhat sweet and milky, with the tiniest bit of roastiness and a touch of cocoa. The taste is creamier, and the flavors a bit longer than the nose would suggest. There is also a nice hint of bitterness that works well with the sweetness and creamy notes. More bitter chocolate as well. Nice. Very smooth in the mouth, my only complaint is a faint sourness from the lactic sugars on the finish."
"O- I really dig this beer. Solid recommendation and possesses a remarkably high drinkability for the style."
"the oiliness makes up for a thinner mouthfeel, the sweetness is expected given the style, but this isn't very complex or original and it might be slightly over-carbonated at cold temps with a little head compared to some serious brothers in the catagory. Good easy drinkin beer though."
"Very drinkable."
"If I could liken this to one beer in particular, it would be a light version of Troeg's Java Head."
"Milk Stout in my opinion doesn't sound like it would be a good combination, but this Stout is worth trying. A great combo of sweetness and everything that makes a stout great. This beer has one of the best smells and the aftertaste is wonderful. I highly recommend this beer especially for people who love milkshakes and beer."
"Overall: A nice little stout. The flavours are a little muted compared to other sweet stouts, like Moloko, but the creaminess is spot-on. I shudder to think of the amounts of lactose they must have dumped into this. Its sweet and dark but never cloying."
"Think I'll have another"
"nice. Definitely worth trying."
"Pours a deep black color with a thin tan head and tons of lacing that never go away. Smells of chocolate and coffee. Tastes of sweet milk chocolate, plenty of sweetish malts, and a good coffee/roasted malt bitterness. Mouthfeel is very nice and drinkability is high."
"Pours a really nice deep, deep brown color with a light tan head. The head is fairly long-lasting. The nose is nice with some roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, and a bit of light sweetness. The taste is a bit more plain with some light chocolate and a touch of roast. The feel is nice and creamy. Drinks really well and is a nice cold-weather session brew."
"I first had this little stout up at Bukowski in Boston. It's a very smooth and drinkable stout (probably can be attributed to its low ABV). I recently picked up a six pack of this, and can easily drink 2 or 3 in a sitting, which can't be said for all stouts. It's a little on the plain side, but nonetheless a good 'go to' if I want a stout."
"Notes: A very well done milk stout. Tasty and pleasant to drink. This is a great beer to introduce to those who are not fans of dark beer, or for """converting""" people, if that's what you're into."
"Bottled on black was blank on mine. Served from bottle into a Dogfish Head Signature glass. Poured basically black with a hint of brown when held up to the light with a half finger tan head that subsided to a minimal amount quite quickly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, chocolate, and slight coffee. The flavor was of sweet malt and dark chocolate. It had a heavy feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice milk stout. Not my favorite I have had, but still pretty good. This one had a pretty big sweetness aspect to it as compared to others I have had. The flavor however was nicely balanced with the sweetness of the malt and the bitterness of the dark chocolate. The aroma was quite nice as well. Glad I got to try this one and plan to pick up some more when I see it on the shelves again."
"Pours black with minimal chocolate colored head that vanishes. Smell is primarily of coffee and the taste is like a Manhattan Special coffee-flavored soda. The carbonation is light and it is very light-bodied, again, like a soda. I remember this is being so much better. Has the beer changed, or just my palate?"
"Drinkability: this is a tasty beer. I could definitely drink a few of these. My experience with stouts is limited and I can't weigh in too much but I this is my favorite stout. Almost porter like."
"It's a drinkable beer smooth enough that I could sip on one or two all night but I wouldn't recommend it for a session or anything"
"Pretty good beer, nice lower ABV with pretty big flavor. Don't really have any complaints about it. Reminds me of Sam Smith's oatmeal in some ways."
"Pours a very nice deep blackish brown color with blood red highlights. Still able to see through this one. Nice off white head formed that leaves some lacing. There is a nice roasted malt aroma. No chocolate to speak of on the nose which I found odd. I get some roasted coffee, and a touch of smokiness too. Flavors are roasted malts and you really get that lactose in there which creams this out. Even has a whipped cream like aftertaste. Not coffee or chocolate forward which I like. Mouthfeel is creamy and refreshes the palate after each sip. The drinkability is perfect with a nice low abv. Great beer and would like to have some more."
"D - Very good balance of flavors and the wife and I easily knocked off the 6 pack. If you like this style, this is certainly worth a try."
"D - This is an excellent beer and I would recommend it to anyone. This may be the best milk stout I have ever had."
"I have seen this around for years and had to try it. It pours a deep brown color with an almost chocolate looking foam. It has that coffee/mocha/latte smell to it. It goes down with a smooth milky feel that is very full flavor. A must try if you're looking for something different."
"It has been a couple years since I last had this beer. I don't remember it being as amazing as this. Sad that this brewery had become a """pass""" in my book. Glad I re-indulged."
"This is a sweet stout tht is very similar to an iced mocha. A good beer if you enjoy sweet stouts."
"This beer is very drinkable. Good for after dinner and it is not too heavy so one bottle won't weigh you down."
"I could see this being a great beer for some people - it's just not for me. Worth a try if you're fond of the style."
"D: Not too complex, but if milk stouts are your thing, than this is a very good example of that style."
"Overall not much my cup o' tea, I like a lot RIS and stouts, a like the bitterness the coffee flavor, the full and rich body. This one has a little bit of those characteristics but also has a little bit of past due milk flavor that put me off."
"O- really great pint of beer. The beer for the genuine chocolate lover. Not at all heavy or overpowering, just delicious and suprisingly balanced. I would only like a touch more roasted flavor because I love stouts and am acoustomed to a little more espresso. Still as the cold months set in this will be a regular on my list."
"Black with a beige head that recedes fairly quickly. Marginal lacing. smells malty and sweet and of chocolate. the taste is very pleasant. not much roastiness going on here. It tastes mostly of milk chocolate. very smooth and absolutely no bitterness. It's a bit lightbodied compared to how it tastes. Very drinkable. This is a simple yet pleasant milk stout."
"d/overall- I very much enjoy this beer and is a great fall and winter brew. I would prefer a little more mouth feel but that is my only complaint. I think this is an exceptional milk stout and anyone a fan of the style should try it."
"Drinks: dependably. Left Hand has long been one of my favorite milk stouts and is my go-to whenever it makes an appearance at one of the bars where all other options are BMC."
"d/overall- a treat of a beer, really enjoying this - perfect for the fall new england weather. Definitely a big fan"
"D - I could have a couple, but it would not be my first choice."
"D - Easy to drink and not too forward. Decent brew."
"This has a nice creamy malt to it. A lovely dark color and a perfect milk stout aroma. I thought it was very good, but like I said before, other milk stouts are just the same."
"Highly drinkable, I'm glad the abv is low, because this goes down waayyyy to smooth!"
"I tried one of these thanks to my buddy. It pours out a dark dark brown with a deep red hue when held to light. Nice creamy .5 inch head that quickly disipates down to a slight film. Smell is of sweet coffee and chocolate with a faint hint of vanilla bean. Taste is of roasty coffee, bakers chocolate and cream. Mouthfeel is a creamy goodness that just flows over the tongue to deliver taste everywhere. Drinkability is medium due to the sweetness. More of an after dinner beer, but very impressive."
"D: Good beer that is incredibly easy to drink. Could definitely put a few of these back in a sitting as the sweetness was not over the top"
"Drinkability -- It's OK, but I'm not in love. It seems like it needs more lactose sweetness for style."
"Great beer for those who love milk stouts. Nice and rich appearance. Not the freshest smell, but intriguing enough. Taste of milk and cream rolled into a nice stout with a mouthful that leave you wanting more. Drinkability is exceptional. At 5.2% one can drink a bunch of these and feel good."
"Drinkable This is a sub-genre of stout. It's evidentlty built to be drinkable and accessable. In that regard Left Hand did well. This lacks the depth,flash,punch....and price tag,of some of the """ Big""" stouts,but it's a brew you can do watching TV or mowing the lawn. Your girl friend will like iut. Your uncle will like it. Those """dudes""" you hang out with will like it. It is NOT KBS/Abyss/Plead The 5th/Expedition...but is a pretty decent brew."
"Drinkability: A good milk stout that was very enjoyable and easy to drink. could drink maybe two-three of these in any one setting. Another solid beer from the folks at Left Hand."
"drinkability - hell yes - should have bought a case i forgot how good this beer is - low abv light body big flavor - great stout"
"I guess you could call this my dessert after downing a spicy pork sammich (with the Victory edition of the Saison du BUFF). It pours a mostly opaque black-brown, highlighted with a lighter shade of brown, topped by a half-finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises light buttercream, sweet coffee, cocoa, coconut, light roasted malts, and vanilla. The taste is a simple combination of roasted malts, coffee, vanilla, cocoa, and sour cream. The body is a somewhat hefty medium, with a very light carbonation and a feel as smooth as Billy Dee. On nitro, this thing is dangerously drinkable, a very tasty and enjoyable milk stout."
"Pours a nice light tan head that doesn't stay around long. There is a deep rich black body. The aroma is of roasted malt and sour cream. The sour notes on the nose while appropriate were a bit off putting. The sour notes go by the wayside they taste of chocolate cream and coffee. There are also notes of nutmeg and cinnamon with a woodsy almost nutty taste to it. There was some light nitrogenation to it. It was nice and smooth on the palate. Overall a solid tasting milk stout. A pretty good brew to consume on tap."
"Although I am partial to local beers (from the Philly area) I am very happy with this beer..will definitely try more of their stuff.."
"Flavor is robust; although not to complex. Great balance of bitter and sweet. Overall, this is a very good milk stout. This is my favorite Lefthand brand."
"I liked this beer, it smelled and tasted good, and it went down easy. Alcohol was moderate making this even more drinkable."
"Hot day on the farm, come on inside and slurp down a pint of your mother's milk stout, straight from the cows in the barn. It's dark for sure, but not impenetrable. The coffee/chocolate is super toned down, so you can definitely session this pup (especially at this ABV). I really like the mouthfeel- it is on the watery side for a stout (though not as watery as Guiness), but it's BALANCED. Oh heck yeah, this would go with all kinds of foods. I'm pairing it with some pizza and fish filet sandwiches."
"Moderate carbonation and a very smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Subtle, roasty flavor profile with chocolate, toast, and perhaps a hint of vanilla. Just a bit of coffee bitterness on the finish. Very smooth, light, and easy-drinking stout."
"Overall an enjoyable brew. Drier than I expected. Will drink again."
"D - Moderate to high drinkability. Very manageable ABV. Flavors are just a bit too caught up in the roasted malts for extended sessioning. Not at all filling."
"my favorite part of this beer is the feeling of it going down- a slight tingle in your throat as the after taste of roasted coffee and cream arise"
"Atmosphere is great here. Formidable dark appearance with a great foamy head to top it off. Nose is not complicated, but very full. Flavor is robust. Again, not so complex but a lot of it. Great balance of bitter and sweet. Overall, this is a great quaff."
"poured from a bottle into snifter. almost black appearance with head that quickly fades to thin layer on edges. smellis chocolate, coffee, and slight vanilla. taste is of thinned out milkshake mixed with coffee beans. lacing is decent with low carbonation. great session beer. best i've had of style so far."
"Body is surprisingly light. Subtle dry finish and sweet flavors from start to finish define this unique brew. An honestly """sweet""" stout."
"Poured a dark black w/ a decent amount of head that faded into thin lacing. Smell was sweet and malty as was the taste. Wasn't as sweet as I had expected it to be but that's ok...but not great. The mouthfeel felt a bit thin for a milk stout. Drinkability was good but this isn't a beer I'd buy again. All together this wasn't a bad beer just not the best example of the style, in my opinion."
"Moderate pour gives a dense tan head of rolling bubbles on top of a dark nearly black brew. The settling head emits a dry acrid nose of smoke and charred malts. The taste is more diverse than the smell, thanks to the addition of a moderate toffee and vanilla sweetness that balances the sharp acrid smoke that dominated the nose. Mouthfeel is on the hearty side of moderate, a bit flat on the carbonation, semi-sweet on the palate but finishes mostly dry. A decent stout, but nothing I'd go out of my way to find again."
"Overall I very much enjoyed this stout, it is easy drinking and by no means a """big""" beer, but quite satisfying."
"D- Very drinkable with the lower ABV. A beer you could drink a few of in an evening."
"D - Sweet Stouts are usually '1 and done' for me. But I could sit back a have a few of these."
"D - A really great Milk stout -very nice example of the style and this has been available for years -I like the new label too, but if you like malt focused beers this will probably hit the spot"
"This beers sits well on the palate. Gives a nice creamy coat all over. Carbonation level is moderate, but retains a very smooth quality. This is a creamy Milk Stout, no doubt about it. Great flavors of vanilla, chocolate, coffee, and just enough hop bite that keeps me begging for more. This is great! Spot on for the style. I really dig this. A sixer will make its home in my fridge fairly often from here on out."
"One of my least favorite styles, but once a year or so the mood strikes and Left Hand's is about as good as any and it's easy to find."
"left hand brewing company--Milk Stout--2010 12 oz. Bottle. 6.00% ABV. 25 IBU's. (4.0 /5.0) Stout--Milk! Thin lace tan head. Dark thin bronze black color. Mild hop milk chocolate light aroma front. Slightly crusty roasted smooth creamy milk chocolate mild sweet mellow Stout body. Tasty clean mild hop refreshing easy lingering creamy malt end. Sampled 8/12/2010. 6-Pack $8.79."
"All in all, it's a fine stout. I expected a creamier beer here and perhaps one that stood out just a little more than your standard stouts. I also expected a bit of a sweeter character, but the sweetness is not that big here at all. However, it's a very drinkable beer."
"D - This is a nice offering from Left Hand. I could definitely pour a couple of these back on any given night. Good stuff."
"Poured this one right down the middle of my tulip. Pour is thin and cola colored with a big quickly dissipating frothy tan head. Fluffy and creamy looking! Thin lacing around the rim. The nose is pretty nice. Roasted malts and sweet fruits. It's all really faint though and kind of tough to pick up on anything in particular. The taste is roasted malt with a little bit of sweetness. Has a really grainy flavor and kind of a grass aftertaste. I've had this before. Light body and decent carbonation make this a very easy to drink beer."
"Overall, a great beer that would do wonders in a nice session."
"D- pretty good, a lot like bluefin but milder on the bitterness, worth buying"
"D: Perfect bold and lightly sweetened coffee treat for a beer/coffee imbiber like myself..."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with decent carbonation. Pretty easy to drink. A nice effort from Left Hand."
"Pours a very dark brown, nearly black, with a nice little light brown head. Nice aromas--bitter chocolate, cocoa powder, some smoke, black licorice and coffee. Good bitter coffee on the palate, along with dark chocolate and some lingering bitterness. I wasn't expecting a lot here, and I was very pleasantly surprised."
"Side note: While pondering what to get at a store this beer was recommended to me by a random shopper. I found it to be delightful introduction into Left Hand Brewing Company and I will definitely try their other brews."
"On nitro at Flying Saucer served in a standard pint glass a dark not quite opaque black with a thin khaki off-white head that leaves typical nitro lacing on the glass. The aroma is roasted malts with mild coffee. The taste is nice roasted malts with a smooth lactose sweetness. The beer is smooth, crisp and refreshing, even on a Summer afternoon. This is a beer that benefits well from a nitro presentation."
"D: My first true domestically made low ABV milk stout, and it was quite good. Shame they don't distribute to CA."
"Poured off nitro tap at Kickbacks in Jacksonville. A thick tan head stays with this throughout the session. Super thick lacing lines the inside of the glass with every swallow. Not a whole lot of aroma with this one but the sweet, milky, creamy taste more than makes up for it. And this thing is sweet....just what you would expect from a sweet milk stout. I havent had this on CO2 but the nitro is awesome!!! Nitro makes the mouthfeel so great. This is a treat."
"I really enjoyed this beer. It had a very distinctive smell. Its the only milk stout Ive ever had or seen. It is a really good beer to sit down and drink with a meal. It is pretty dark beer but still very smooth to drink. Its definitly a beer to try."
"Cola, roast, some fruity acidity. This beer was fairly disappointing, but my hopes were probably a bit too high. The head is beige, creamy and fades at a moderate pace, while the liquid is very dark cola. The aroma has a lot of coffee, cola and milk chocolate. It's dominated by a cola/cocoa note that's too simple and just meh. The flavor is sweet, a bit acidic and has more of a cold coffee and stale cola taste. It's also too simple and kinda cloying. The mouthfeel is smooth and rather thin. It's an alright stout but not as satisfying as I was hoping. I guess I had just pictured something smoother without so much cola flavor."
"D-A very drinkable beer. Goes down easily and more than one in a sitting is definitely doable."
"D_Very drinkable low ABV stout. Great example of the style."
"I bought some to take home before leaving the store!"
"Drinkability: Easy drinking session-like Stout that I could enjoy a few pints of. Suffers slightly from a thin body."
"Drinkability: It's a sessionable and easily accessible milk stout. It's not the best of its style but it's still solid and worth a try."
"This is very drinkable! Tasty and desert like...a great example of a simple milk stout!"
"The slow dissipating head creeps back into a bold black body that carries the taste of lightly sweet lactose, mild tasting chocolate and some indistinguished bitter residuals. The brew sits nicely at the back corners of the tongue, giving you a different angle on the taste. The sweetness gets more pungent and warm. Good beer that I wouldn't mind trying again."
"D: A really rich wonderful beer. Full and sweet, but not so much as to prevent me from having another."
"Drink: Pleasantly drinkable."
"D- Give me this beer anytime and I'll be happy to drink it! The alcohol is very well hidden...wouldn't even know there's booze in this. A delightful desert beer but would also be a great beer to compliment a bbq'd steak with a sweet sauce on it! I'm very impressed!!"
"D - A great after dinner beer, which luckily for me is when I downed it. Call it a dessert stout for sure. It goes down very easy, and with the low ABV I could easily see picking up a sixer of this next time."
"not a crazy big imperial or russian style so this is VERY drinkable and could see getting this again soon."
"My first Left Hand selection and overall I'm a little disappointed."
"12-oz bottle. Dark but not opaque. Thin brown head. Burnt coffee and toffee aroma - pleasant. Lightly sweet on the front with some sour notes. Medium bitterness like strong coffee. Medium body with lively carbonation. Clean finish. A very pleasant pleasant brew"
"Deep red copper, almost opaque, but not quite. The nose smells like coffee with a lot of cream in it. Like a good coffee, not any of that Starbucks crap. Get some vanilla, coffee, milk, and some faint cherries. Smooth mouth-feel and a great balance between the roasted malt and the sweet side of this beer. The """Milk""" in this is more of a balancing effort than to just add body and mouth feel like most who add lactate. Lite effervescent and almost a semisolid. You can almost chew this dang ol thing. Hops are minimal and in the back on the finish, almost nowhere in the swirl. Very sweet but not cloying at all."
"D - Very nice! Easy and smooth like a milk stout should be."
"D- Not the best stout, nice and creamy but just not that strong of a taste for a stout... not very full-bodied"
"Drinkability: Very easy stout to drink. With great aroma and taste making up for any weak points of the beer. Lots of depth with this beer as it warms so drink it slow and really enjoy the later flavors."
"Drinkability- A slow sipper, but still nice to have. Would recommend during the Fall or Winter. Defiantly worth buying on while on the slopes or while opening Christmas gifts."
"Drinkability- OK drinkability for a stout. It isn't as thin as Guinness and not as thick as some other stouts I have tried. Definitely could drink a couple of these."
"Drinkability - a good sipping beer, too expensive to drink on a binge, though i have the feeling you'd be full before you got to that"
"D: For a stout, very good drinkability. Since the mouthfeel leaves a little to be desired, it's not as thick and robust, therefore the drinkability is enhanced. I will probably have this one again."
"[Drinkability]: Very drinkable."
"12 ounce bottle, bottled on 3/10/2010. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with about a 3/4 inch light tan head. Head retention is good, and there is plenty of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is sweet and malty, the beer smells like roasted malt, milk chocolate, and some coffee. Taste is similar to the aroma, but I think it's more roasty than sweet tasting. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's smooth and a bit creamy. It's also well carbonated. Drinkability is good, it's easy to drink and it wouldn't be hard to have a few of these at a time. I thought this was a good all around beer, I liked it and would definitely try it again."
"Drinkability is nearly tops. ABV is low and this goes down like a wonderful dessert, not a beverage."
"Drinkability: Overall, an easy beer to drink. Refreshing to consume, though it might not be a great choice to relax with after a day of working outside in the heat! I could easily take on 2 or 3 of them before getting bored."
"One of Left Hand's better brews. It pours dark black with minimal head. Has aromas of roasted coffee and malts. The sugars from the milk come out nicely and it has a smooth mouth feel to it. Pretty good beer, but the mouthfeel is just too thin for a stout. This feels like it has no body."
"The 6 abv makes this beer easy drinkable. However, it's also quite filling because of it's texture. That makes it hard to drink more than 1 pint of this."
"Cheers"
"Tastes pretty good. Sweet, but not overly so. No unpleasant aftertastes. Decent lacing left on the glass, holds a small head. You know, this is all right. Probably real good in cold weather. I like it, will probably seek out next winter."
"D - very drinkable, dead-on example of the style; just nothing special"
"Notes - Why don't I drink more milk stouts but I suspect after a few I might get a little palate fatigue"
"The taste comes through with the roasted barley as a stout should. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Not thick but not watery. Easy to drink. Touch of caramel. A great stout that I could drink often."
"M/D: Creamy and frothy, the nitro-tap adds another dimension. This was my first beer poured this way, and I could really tell the difference. Like Jason said," the difference from a bottle and nitro is that the nitro is similar to sleeping on a fluffier pillow.""" I honestly couldn't agree more, very drinkable."
"D- a smooth one here, indeed. affordablility and easy drinking could make this one a staple in any dark beer drinkers fridge."
"hated it soo much six months ago if you gave me this I wouldn't even spit it at you, because I wanted it no where near my mouth. Although now, courtesy of my growing palette, I now truly enjoy this beer. Yep I like it and still wouldn't spit it at you cause I want to drink it. Now don't get me wrong I'm crazy about it, but if it is on draft and the selection is weak, ill order it and enjoy the drink. This is a smooth drinking stout that has a nice sweetness to balance out the normal coffee and smoke flavors of a stout. This beer makes me want to experiment with lactose in my homebrews. Very good beer! Hmmm i wonder what other beers I would enjoy now?!"
"Overall the beer is extremely enjoyable, easy to sip on a cozy night."
"D- Fantastic milk stout. Very drinkable. I'm very sad I can't get Left Hand around here and have to travel to New Jersey to get it. That being said, next time I go, I'll make sure to grab at least a sixer to share with my stout loving friends."
"D: Could have had this stuff all night, and probably should have, but wanted to try other stuff. If you see this on nitro, get it!"
"D- More of a light stout, probably ideal for a night caper or desert beer."
"Had the nitro bottle version. Way better than what I wrote above. Adjusted scores to reflect."
"drinkablity: This is a solid stout, nothing too crazy about it, but real drinkable. I can see these getting bodied with the quickness."
"an alright beer. a richer and more luscious mouthfeel would really help this concoction out."
"Medium-full body, with moderate carbonation. Mild to moderate creaminess, a bit chewy, and slightly drying to the palate. Overall a very enjoyable stout. Great balance and mix of flavors."
"Left Hand Mlik Stout poors a very dark rich chocolatey brown. The aroma is very light, mostly chocolate. The flavors are more pronounced, first with a big dose of chocolate and roasted malts. It is a very creamy beer, and very easy to drink. Surprisingly the aftertaste does not last very long. I definitely recommend this to anybody who likes drinking milk stouts."
"Toasted marshmallows and light roasted malt up front. Slight flinty/smoked accent on the malt adds some nice depth. Mix of dark chocolate bitterness and milk chocolate sweetness hits just the right note. Hints of coffee (with a spoonful of sugar). Vanilla and a little sweetness come through and linger into an otherwise lightly-roasted finish (with a hint of coffee bitterness). Very nice. Medium-full body with a smooth, creamy feel."
"Drinkability - Delicious, but because of its taste not something you'd want to drink at a party or during a meal. Maybe it would be a good dessert beer, or a good beer to drink with something overly flavorful, possibly to balance out the plethora of flavors in your mouth."
"This poured a clear dark mahogany with some tan head. It smelled like fresh roasted coffee and cream, with bitter dark chocolate and a bit of brown sugar. It tasted like bitter coffee with dark chocolate and cream and some copper hops. It was thick with some carbonation, and had a mild bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a nice milk stout with good scent and taste that had the perfect amount of sweetness over a regular stout. It had nice body too, which made this really easy to drink. This wasn't the most exciting beer in the world, but it's a solid example of the style."
"Poured into a Duvel Tulip glass. Pours out very dark, close to black with brown on the edges where the liquid get's a little thinner. An off white foam head appears, but it doesn't really stick around. Only the slightest bit around edge of the glass, not much lacing a little bit glides down back to the liquid but more and more disappear after each sip. The smell is pretty good but not very complex, mostly of sweet chocolate and some coffee. It has to be pretty close to room temperature to pick up on the smell. The taste is more of darker chocolate followed by coffee, possibly even esspresso. Dark roasted malts can be tasted a little. I didn't expect it, but about half way through the session you can get a slight hop aftertaste. It's not strong, but it's there. Mouthfeel is good, full bodied sort of a """milky""" mouthfeel smooth with a slight bitterness on the finish, pretty good. It's pretty drinkable overall a bit tough to distinguish though. Not extremely drinkable, but not a sipper either. Don't be discouraged from trying it, it's pretty good overall."
"Truly creamy in taste! A perfect choice for lighter beer fans making their into stouts. Though this beer be black as night, it's welcoming and unintimidating. It's an excellent drink by itself, and you can drink it with anything, although I would best pair it with strong, flavorful meats, if you plan on eating. . . ."
"D: A pretty decent, quite malty stout for the sweet malt fan. At 5.2% ABV, it's quite sessionable, although I don't think I'd be inclined to session it at a ball game or BBQ. Likely to treat it as an evening party/after dinner stout. Tasty and balanced all around."
"Overall, """creamy""" describes the entire experience. This is an extra-smooth stout. I've had it on nitro-tap before at the brewery and I remember it tasted just like a latte, but even at a normal tap it is one mild beer."
"Whenever i can get a Left Hand on the east coast i jump at the chance. I'm not a big fan of milk stouts but this is better than most. Very dark color and good malty aroma. Not much carbonaiton, like a milk stout, but good flavor and a good stout to get in the summer time. I'd recommend."
"Good effort from Left Hand, I will be sure to try some of their other offerings."
"Flavor was sweet and milky, if a bit thin. Would like to see more roasted flavor, but the other buttery qualities of this beer don't disappoint. Aftertaste has notes of chocolate and faint roast. Mouthfeel was okay, with medium carbonation and a decent smoothness, but again, it's somewhat watery. However, the lightness and satisfying sweetness make this a very drinkable stout."
"D - Lower ABV held with the drinkability but I dont think I would order this beer again."
"D- This was a good drinking stout. It went down smooth and I could have ended up going for another one of these. Nice stout to give to the fans of other bigger mass produced stouts."
"Drinkability: middle-of-the-road for a sweet stout, in my book. One or two of these would be my limit."
"The feel is really light but smooth with a creamy feel with a minor bitterness and a very drinkable feel a really nice beer."
"Served in a standard pint glass. Small light brown head. Minimal carbonation. Opaque black color. Aromas of roasted malt, cocoa. Body is velvety but light. Starts lactose sweet and mocha-ey. Becomes more roasted in the middle. Finish is slightly drier and chocolatey. Alcohol slightly warming in finish (5.9%)."
"A nice introduction to """dark beer""" for folks who are scared off by that famous Irish stout."
"Really tasty - one of my favorite milk stouts, and a beer that will take the chill out of a cold evening!"
"This is a great milk stout - plain and simple."
"D- VERY drinkable- wish I had gotten more than one in my gift pack!"
"D: could pound a sixer with out a problem such a smooth and full body feeling beer yet light on the stomach."
"I always enjoy this beer. Would love to be able to have access to it in CA."
"D - Aftertaste disappeared after a few sips. A solid milk stout. Could have another."
"I could have a few of these a nice beer, but definitely not the best milk stout I've tried."
"D - A decent beer, it's sum is better than the parts."
"This is a very creamy beer. Nice foam that acts like a cap over the dark beer. Nice smell, a bit cherry taste i must say. Not sure it that is good or bad for the bottle but i guess it a legit taste on this very Milk Stout. If you are interested in the Left Hand brewery or just like a good Milky beer i can warmly recommend this one. Have a big glass to pour it in and enjoy it as it is, mildly cold."
"D: Have to say that the drinkability here is low. I will try one again to make sure that my draft wasn't a bad one but even the bartender said she wasn't pleased with it."
"This is a good effort by Left Hand. Fairly easy to drink, but with a weight that makes it difficult to imagine drinking more than one."
"I could certainly session this beer but overall it's a little dismal, just a few major tweaks could really make this a great session stout and while I wouldn't hesitate to drink it again I'm not sure I would seek it out."
"This is an approachable, well balanced, super drinkable milk stout, with little to no bite. It goes well with a meal or by itself. If I could choose one stout to drink, this well-rounded specimen would be my pick!"
"Could drink till the cows come home. So to speak."
"Overall, this is not an overly complex beer but it is pretty tasty."
"i can see through it. the first thing i always taste is the presentation, and i like my stouts to be stout. good. not great, but still good. the creaminess helps with the drinkability, but i can't get past a lager like sweet smell. not overbearing, but very faint. besides that, chocolate, roasted coffee, yummy. a bit too carbonated for a stout. could use a bit more body as well."
"Medium bodied, smooth and very drinkable. A really nice after dinner/desert brew, but good enough for anytime."
"Drinkability - 4.0/5.0 - a solid milk stout, good for mixed company and for those who want a less """robust""" stout"
"This is another good milk stout."
"drinkability: a solid stout and i would drink again."
"Value: Very good."
"Cheers!"
"a consistent milk stout with an american fashion. nose of lactose... yogurt, coffee, and chocolate. palate is acidic but mild. both fruit citrus and lactic acid. not sharp with an excellent body to support the palate range. strawberry yogurt, coffee, a bit of earth, chocolate. quite wonderful when right."
"D- This is a very drinkable milk stout. Perhaps not the most complex within the style, but one I enjoyed very well. If you're put off by the dry finish of some stouts, this one may be for you. Would buy again."
"Side Notes: This is a good try at the style, just needs a little more oomph."
"Very drinkable on just about any occasion, I tend to get a hankering for stouts and porters when the weather gets cold. This fits well with that, the heaviness and roasted flavors work well on a cold evening"
"Not a huge milk stout fan but this is ok, just a little too sweet."
"Pours a dark reddish brown. A little lighter than I expected. Creamy tan head with good retention. Smokey coffee dark chocolate smell. Very smooth, sweet coffee chocolate taste as well. This is my first milk stout. I like it. It has the robust smokey bittersweet taste of a good stout, with a smooth, sweet, creamy side to it. Very nice. Thick, creamy chewy mouthfeel. This is a very tasty satisfying beer. Great for a cold winter night."
"D - Drinks fine, although I don't think I'll have this again since it's so lacking in the flavor department."
"D - Substantial but not heavy. Well-rounded and approachable. Very drinkable."
"on sight, pours black into a stout style tulip glass. very, very thin tan head-which is gone in a blink of an eye, no lacing left behind. aromas of coffee right away followed by sweet chocolate malt and toffee. taste is bitter on the back, chocolate sweetness in the beginning, and strong coffee in the middle. overall i really dig this milk stout, run out and pick up a six pack. Cheers!"
"Left Hand Milk Stout is the first of the style I've tried and I find it very approachable and drinkable, but it does seem more like a porter than a stout to me. I really need to try more of the style. It's also only the second beer from Left Hand brewery I've tried, the other being the Oktoberfest which I found to be very good."
"The first sip: has a decent mouthfeel, the roasted malts really stand out, it is a bit sweet, not too strong, a nice milk taste to follow. Decent beer."
"Had this on nitro-tap. Pours black with a big very light tan head. The head has really good retention and was still there when I was getting close to finishing the beer. Left some very good lacing down the glass. I didn't get to much of a smell on this one what was there was kind of light for me but there were roasted malts, some chocolate. Roasted malts and chocolate were also in the taste but luckily more apparent. There was also a milk/milk chocolate taste and also a very small hint of coffee (mainly in the aftertaste). The mouthfeel on this one was some of the creamiest I've ever had, very smooth and creamy and thick. This one as a lower ABV and with a good taste I easily had three. Would like to drink this one again for sure."
"Notes: Of the few milk/sweet stouts I've had, this is the best. The milky sweetness blends so nicely with the other flavors you usually find in a stout. I can see this becoming one of my favorite stouts."
"I really enjoy this milk stout. This was served a dark black with a very smooth head. Left Hand Milk Stout goes down with a very creamy mouthfeel and with a slight hoppiness at the end. I can taste the sweetness at the beginning. Very smooth. Will definitely drink again."
"D- Overall this is a really nice Milk Stout and one that I will revisit quite often."
"Summary: Not a bad beer overall, but would not go out of my way top drink it again. Lacks the """oomf""" that most good stouts have."
"Definitely recommend. Try it if you can!"
"D: Goes down easy, and would make a decent session. A little bit on the sweet side to drink a whole lot of, but is still quite nice. Would make a great after dinner beer."
"All in all, it's a good milk stout, but doesn't really stand out as anything special."
"It doesn't stand out, but I love the mouthfeel and hte sweetness the lactose imparts. To me this is a session beer- to spend an evening with friends."
"Overall, I think this is an easy to drink beer. It doesn't overwhelm me with taste or aroma, but leaves me thinking that I could enjoy another one."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability is way up there: lots of flavor for a low ABV stout, & without a lot of heavy flavors that camp out on your palate. I can understand all the word-of-mouth praise for this baby."
"Overall, this is a very enjoyable brew. It's very complex and tasty, just not overly bold. Given its low ABV, I would definitely cite this as a solid session beer that I would certainly recommend."
"Left Hand Milk Stout is a stout that could be pounded on a hot day. A summer stout, perhaps?"
"Drinkability- Excellent. A misguided friend once referred to Busch Light as """Tasting like Candy""". This brew actually does!"
"Drinkability: I may have found my everyday beer. Its very easy to drink, and when I've finished my bottle, I feel like another. And at only 5.2% its very forgiving when youre having a few."
"taste is of sweet chocolate, some burnt malts, tastes and feels more like a porter than a stout, though. mouthfeel is pleasant for a porter, but not what i would expect from a stout. light in consistency and pretty easy to drink."
"D- Very drinkable. One of my favored stouts actually when I can get it. Just overall a very interesting beer. I have yet to have a lot of really good sweet/milk stouts, this is one of the better ones."
"It was good at first but got worse as it warmed and was average overall. If I wasn't a fan of the style I would've probably hated this beer."
"Pours black with a brownish-white head. Smells strongly of coffee, chocolate. Taste is sweet, almost creamy right off the bat. Very nice ending notes of dark chocolate and coffee. Smooth all the way through. Not quite as much as Young's Double Chocolate, but more complex. In my opinion, makes for a better beer. Very drinkable, an all-around quality brew."
"One of my favorite beers... if you're in the mood for something sweet and creamy this is it."
"Had this beer on tap. Maybe it's the name, but I almost felt I was drinking cold milk beer, if there is even such a thing. The beer was smooth and silky. Nice easy to drink stout, all around. I'm afraid to try it in a bottle for fear that it might taint my memory."
"One of the. Pours very dark, with a nice, small head. Flavors start sweet, nutty, and creamy then finish with coffee, chocolate and roasted malts. Carbonated just enough to not distract from the the taste. Great beer to pair with chocolate,overall one of the best stouts out there!"
"This is a very good milk stout, somewhat thick but highly drinkable!"
"Drinkability - This is one of the most drinkable stouts I have had. It would be quite easy to have a couple of these in a sitting as opposed to nursing it for a while."
"D - This seems to fit the style well enough. It's very rich with a very strong malt character that is typical of Left Hand beers. For this beer it works well."
"d = A very drinkable stout. One of my favorites for under 10 bucks a six pac."
"D- A tad on the sweet side for all night drinking but I would happily drink two or three of these in a sitting which wouldn't be much of a chore due to the low abv."
"In order for me to review this beer effectively please note that the opening line was a lie."
"Bottled-on date got wet and faded, it is no longer visable. Had to pour it forcefully to get 1 finger of tanned head that receeded quickly to just a lace on top of the beer. Color is nearly black with some brown hue along the edges. The nose is sweet upfront from the lactose but includes chocolate and coffee notes as well. The taste of this beer displays all of the properties of the smell; and then some. It has even more bold sweetness than the smell would let you believe. It also tastes of chocolate, coffee and the finish has a bit of bitterness that clings for awhile after the sip. Very smooth and medium mouthfeel, carbination is a bit light."
"D - A nice brew and good session stout. Maybe a little steep on price. Memorable? Kind of."
"Give it a try!"
"I ll drink this again and i ll start sampling a style I used to shrink back from..."
"Served at the Left Hand tasting room in a pint glass. Jet black, healthy tan head with lasting lace. Dark chocolate and licorice aroma. Rich, creamy, and sweet. Not the strong caramelized malt taste of many stouts, much more subtle. Big mouthfeel. Think melted coffee ice cream with a slight kick. One of my favorite desserts if I can get it on nitro."
"Some coffee aroma,but down hill from there. First impression of the initial sip was carbonation overwhelming any flavor. Then with time the carbonation died down and the coffee came through. But mouthfeel was light and watery. This is the Bud Light of Stouts! I suppose you could drink this all day but the mouthfeel of a good cup of coffee is more substantial."
"I probably wouldn't go out of my way to pick up more, but I would definitely drink a few if they were in the fridge."
"D - I'm not a huge fan of milk stouts, but I really liked this one. I could easily put away a few at a sitting."
"I could easily drink a couple of these in one sitting, but I would more than likely save this one for the last beer of the night. It would nicely wash down just about anything. I look forward to grabbing a six pack next time instead of a lone bottle."
"D- pretty easy to put back and seems like a nice sessionable stout. I prefer the lancaster milk stout myself. Not bad though."
"D - Would tire prior to end of session."
"Had on tap over at Old Time Ale House in Fishers, IN. Very enjoyable. I believe this could have been my first milk stout and look forward to trying others now. Very smooth and tasty. Poured dark black with sweet smell and just a really good taste. I look forward to going back soon for another..."
"Reviewed in a bar, so color may be a little off, but it looked an opaque and pitch black. Not a lot of head but a moderate amount of lacing. The smell of coffee and toasted barley is not only absolutely delicious, but absolutely overpowering. There is a definite sweet lactose taste balanced by coffee, biscuity malt and toasted nutty flavors. Delicious linger, both sweet and mild. This is a delicious beer and an excellent example of a sweet milk stout."
"Drinkability: This is a well balanced beer and the malts are by far the most prominent feature, it is rich in flavor and has an appealing spice that seems to dissipate as the brew warms a bit. The carbonation fills you up a bit, but the way this beer slides down really make it a pleasure to drink. This is a nice evening brew around a filet mignon or while sitting with friends for an nice evening, very drinkable and a shame when the glass is empty."
"I received a bottle and a glass at an area restaurant. I poured the beer into the glass, and it was rich and black. I tried smelling the beer, and I got chlorine. I think this was leftover from the restaurant staff cleaning the glass so I won't rate the beer's smell poorly. I could taste sweetness, roasted malts, and a coffee like flavor. The beer had a milky feel to it, and went down nicely."
"Not bad, but have had better"
"Outside of the masturbatory sound to its name, excellent beer."
"It pours a very dark brown to almost black. A nice two finger head that persists for quite some time. The smell is mostly roasted malt, with a touch of rosted coffee. The taste honestly reminds me of a very strong mocha. A lot of coffee flavor, and a touch of chocolate milk. Really tasty!!! The aftertaste has just a hint of bitterness. Mouthfeel is nice. Not quite as slick as an oatmeal stout. I have to be careful with this. I could probably drink a sixpack, just because I like the flavor. Yum."
"D- I would call this a session stout. I could probably drink a six pack in one night. Very good light stout!"
"Not a beer that's too terribly worthy of seeking out, but quite drinkable, as it was moderately interesting tasting, without being too demanding on the palate. One of the more sessionable stout's I've had in a while. It reminds me of Laughing Dog's Sweet Stout, except that the latter beer has more oomph in the flavor department. Not a hugely memorable beer, but an easily quaffable stout. Best beer I've had from Left Hand (not that I've been all that impressed with other LH beers that I've tried), and one that I'd drink again given the right circumstances."
"When I saw this was on nitro-tap at the brewery, I had to give it a drink. I feel like I am in the minority in that I have liked this beer over the years. The nitro tap worked well with this brew. Pour dark black, but you can tell not that dense, color. A huge, frothy white head rests atop. Seemed like there was a rim of head around my glass the entire time I drank it. The aroma was none too overwhelming. A rich malt aroma is there, with some very sweet sugar and chocolate hints. Flavor was far more pronounced than the aroma indicated. A nice, full sweet chocolate malt flavor with a slight bitter ting at the end. The lactose aspect came through stronger as a drank it. The nitro-did wonders for the mouthfeel, and really brought out the creamy characteristics, and lighten the brew itself with some carbonation. I like a milk stout every now and then, and this one is done better with the nitro-tap, it just lightens it up, makes it an easy drinking, but sweet character stout."
"I found this beer to be pretty one-note, and that single note wasn't a deep one. I don't have a lot of experience drinking milk/sweet stouts, but I can't see why I would want this over some other, similarly priced stouts. Especially when it doesn't even taste like a stout. I guess that I just don't get it."
"Drinkibility is good, though. It's not heavy and with a 5.2% ABV, this could be sessionable. I'd love to have this alongside a rich, chocolate torte."
"Overall: A decent milk stout, nothing spectacular, somewhat thin for style, but tasty and refreshing nonetheless. Worth a try."
"Tasted as it smelled with a faint chocolate undertone. Very smooth and drinks easily. Rich and creamy mouthfeel. A great milk stout."
"Overall a pretty good stout. Tasty and I'd definitely have this one again."
"Definitely a nice addition to any fridge. Would work best as a dessert, although I don't see drinking more than one in any given session."
"D- very drinkable, great session beer, not too complex"
"From the Mountain Mixer Sample pack. A Deep amber/brown color body with a soapy light tan head. Aroma or dark roasted malt,coffee,and slight sweet cream. Flavor is of slightly burnt coffee with a touch of cream and sugar, nice and roasty ,light carbonation, with a crisp clean mouthfeel for a stout, light body, roasty coffee type aftertaste, pretty darn drinkable."
"Drinkability - You know some stouts aren't very good in the summer, but she subtle sweetness of this beer makes it good year round in my opinion. I think I could finish a sixer of this in a weekend no problem."
"I poured my bottle into a willi glass. It poured like black coffee and appeared black in the glass with a light caramel head. The nose was pretty par, chocolate, caramel, coffee, little nutty. The taste is what puts this one over the top. You taste everything you just smelled, along with a bit of dried fruit, black cherry, and well balanced lactose. An overload of lactose is what had turned me off to this style in the past, but I think the burnt coffee may have kept that lactose from getting too sickeningly sweet. The mouthfeel is smooth, could be a little silkier, but this is a 5.2% beer so what do you want. I typically stick to beers of this ilk in the colder weather. My favorite combo is to switch this back and forth with FFF Alpha King."
"A decent brew that essentially does what it's supposed to, but I've enjoyed others--like Young's Double Chocolate Stout's milk chocolate flavor--more in terms of their creativity."
"Great little bottle of stout for under $2, well worth it"
"Pours black into a pint glass with some deep ruby-red color at the base. Leaves a thin tan head that sticks around for the duration of drinking it. Leaves a fair amount of lacing. Smells sweet, slightly roasty, maybe a bit of chocolate. Tastes mildly sweet with some milky creaminess to it. There's a lot of roasted malt and dessert like flavors dominating the palate. A nice milk stout and one worth having again."
"12 oz. Near black pour, fairly miniscule tan head. Rich smell of mocha and roast malt. Chocolate with roasted tones, lactose. Smooth, nice finish. Would call it medium bodied. Could have used just a little more something, not quite sure what though. Still good. Need to try again."
"Not bad, but not a beer I would purchase in bulk."
"D- Very drinkable. Not overpowering in flavor like some stouts can be."
"D- Hard to make a drinkable milk stout, but this will do for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and of course, dessert."
"D: If it sounds at all like I dislike this brew, you'd be mistaken. This is an exceptionally drinkable beer, especially for a stout. If you haven't tried this beer, but have access you must."
"Left Hand Milk Stout is a clear, deep, deep ruby ale with a thin khaki head that leaves good lacing. It has a roasty aroma with a touch of sweetness. It is medium bodied, smooth and crisp. It's sweet with notes of caramel, milk and coffee. It's very roasty. This is just excellent!"
"The opaque brown/black liquid filled my glass with almost no head to speak of. Pretty...adn it had a light yet sweet aroma that was a bit of cocoa, caramel, and walnuts. The taste was similar without the walnut. It's a stout but it doesn't sit heavy or kick my tongue on the way down, it's just pleasant and enjoyable. Good job, LH!"
"Drinkablilty for a stout was kind of a light hitter I could easily have a six-pack and not feel to full."
"Drinkability- Excellent, if you're looking for something sweet. Would be great with desert."
"This beer pours a black color like a cola with a thick mocha colored head. The nose has a coffee aroma. The initial attack and flavor are consistent with the nose in that there is some coffee and flavors of deeply roasted malts. Coffee and malt, those are my two main descriptors. The beer is smooth from attack through the finish. The mouthfeel is definitely creamy and rich. It finishes with that same nice creaminess. Very enjoyable."
"mouthfeel was creamy and smooth. good drinkability."
"T - This beer tasted great, I love Stouts and mix in something a little sweeter, and I love dessert Stouts, which this one is, very rich and flavorable"
"D: This is an okay milk stout but I wouldn't rate it much higher. Probably won't go out of my way to get it again. It lost me on the taste and mouthfeel. Roasted malt overpowers other characters of the beer."
"D: This is a well crafted cream stout. Very easy to drink and it falls in to my perception of a stout that you can drink all night long and not get totally drunk. If this beer is an indication of how Left Hand beers are, I look forward to sampling them all."
"D- Did I mention that this is smooth? Overall this is a very drinkable beer. The milk chocolate taste and sweetness are not too much. This is an easy drinking stout."
"D- It's a pretty easy drinker. I could put back a few in a single sitting and I wouldn't mind picking up a bottle again."
"Pours a clear dark ruby red, almost brown/black, thick tan head forms, settles to a thick ring around the glass, lots of lace sticks, looks real nice. Smell is great, really roasty and biscuity, grains, lactose sweetness, caramel, coffee, chocolate, bread, almost a bit of charred wood, vanilla, earthy, I like it. Taste is similar, very roasty, almost acrid, toffee, lightly sugary, lactose, coffee/espresso, chocolate, biscuity and grainy, really nice stuff. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation, really smooth and drinkable. Not overly complex, but for me the flavours just work really well in this one."
"drinkability is good. nice balance. good depth. definitely a nice milk stout. not overly lactic, just smooth and drinkable. good stuff!"
"Very drinkable beer but this was much better on tap."
"Enjoyable beer, but lower on the ABV than I prefer, which I suppose makes it a better session beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium light bodied with a bit too much carbonation."
"Had this most recently on tap at the Houston Flying Saucer. Pours black with a thick creamy head. Nice aromas of chocalate and burnt coffee. Very smooth in taste and it tastes like a nice bitter chocolate milk shake. More chcolates and coffee in the taste. Ends with a nice sweet smooth kick. Great tasting beer. My second favorite sweet stout after Watney's cream stout. I think Left Hand is a very underrated brewery. I enjoy all their products."
"Fairly drinkable, but not overly complex."
"Very good overall and I would definitely try again... even though I don't particularly prefer stouts. This one's a winner!"
"This is a decent milk stout; not the best I've ever had, but not bad for a change of pace. I wouldn't be opposed to having it again.  The flavor profile is pleasant; however, I believe there are other milk stouts that are just as readily available - and comparably priced - that do a much better job at complementing the roasted/coffee/chocolate notes with a more lush, creamier mouthfeel."
"Poured into a Stella Artois glass. About a one inch tan head. Head dies pretty quickly. Very dark but not completely black like a RIS. The aroma smells like roasted malts and chocolate. This is one the smoothest Milk stouts I've had in a while. Very easy to drink and goes down nicely. Not a strong aftertaste like most stouts. Overall a good beer, if you like milk or dry stouts, you'll like this one."
"Over all its an above average beer that is pretty sessionable. Nothing special but would drink again til i found something better"
"D - I would like some more fullness in the body. But as it is, it could be a good session beer. Not too complex (that I could detect), but I like the chocolaty goodness."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. It pours black with ruby highlights, medium head. The aroma is sweet and almost smells like chocolate milk. The flavor profile consist of chocoalate, cream and a bit of alcohol. The beer is a bit thin for a stout, but the creamy mouthfeel and carbonation are on point. This is a solid desert beer."
"Smell is sweet, slightly chocolately. It's like drinking alcoholic chocolate milk. Taste is malty, chocolately, with traces of milk. Silky smooth mouthfeel. A little sweet to drink more than one, but a good brew overall."
"I am not a stout drinker but I like this beer. It was a nice surprise, I will drink this again."
"Black, cola-like, not opaque; a bright light reveals finger sillouettes near the top other side of the glass. Short tan head dispersed leaving a few wisps; a thin ring and trace lace hung around a bit longer but eventually faded. Deep coffee bean aroma, chocolate, cocoa. Taste of chocolate milk and cold coffee with a really smooth, sweet finish and texture. The mouthfeel is distinctly creamy although with a thin body, flashes of bitter keep the sweetness in check and the low astringency makes it exceedingly drinkable. Although some will say that this is too light for a true stout, I find it hard to find fault with this beer; the milk / sweet stout handle really seems to fit here. Too bad I only brought one of these home from Premier in Buffalo."
"It pours black with a soft dirty white head. I looks thin, almost watery but there was some bubbly lacing down the sides of the glass. What I was impressed with was the roasted malt and creamy coffee aroma. Bigger than I expected. The taste is... milk like with hints of chocolate, toffee and of course roasted malt. This is a stout that has a sweetness to it but it isn't a fruity sweetness at all (as one would hope given that it's a milk stout) It feels like creamy milk in your mouth and goes down very, very smooth. Still, given the sweetness and the fact that it feels so much like dark, flavorful milk, I wouldn't want another one. But if you can drink a ton of milk then you could probably drink a ton of this since it isn't overly heavy. Overall it's a pretty solid beer. A good first milk stout (and it could be since they sell it in six packs everywhere now) that will not surprise you. It is exactly what it claims to be. This is the least confusing beer I have had in a while."
"A drinkable milk stout but nothing memorable. More creaminess could have done wonders."
"D: Very good stout. Tastes modifies as it warms making it a good beer to sip and savor."
"Pours black. A little bit of lacing. Sweet roasted malt and chocolate scents. Sweet chocolately, roasted malt flavors with a slight touch of hops. The hops add a little bitterness to the finish. The mouthfeel is very sweet and creamy smooth. The roasted malt, chocolate flavors weren't as strong as some stouts, but there was a noticeable sweetness to this that other stouts lack, even could have used a little bit more sweetness."
"Overall, one of the worst efforts I've come across. DRAINPOUR."
"Pours very dark with red highlights. A light dark head lightly carbonated. Smells sweet and malty with hints of chocolate. The taste is also sweet malty chocolaty and after a few sips the roasted flavors really start to come out. Great smooth body which is kinda medium light. The overall drinkability is great. I drink a ton of these."
"Good easy drinking milk stout with an abv that enables you to put a few back."
"Notes: Overall I would say that it is a very nice, easy drinking stout with an average flavor and character."
"Good stuff bought on a lark. Has a unique chocolatey smell. Lighter than usual color. A very sweet taste, with notes of oak and vanilla. The aftertaste is mild and quickly fading. It's more drinkable than your average stout due to it's sweet taste. The mouthfeel is soothing."
"It pours a lighter brown than I thought it might. Light comes all the way through with relative ease when the pint glass is held up. The head shrinks from a nice tan 1.5 finger mound to a ring around the edge of the glass that leaves some streaky lacing. Smells more of milk chocolate than any beer I've had, I usually smell dark chocolate but this is lighter and sweeter. The taste is a light roast, like you'd expect of a breakfast coffee with more hints of milk chocolate. Minimum bitterness. The beer is a little more watery than I prefer, but it still manages to coat the throat nicely and leave a good residual flavor. No problem having a few of these. Its a solid stout."
"Overall, pretty good stuff."
"Overall a good balaced beer."
"D- Overall a great Stout. It is a great sipping beer and good for a rainy day and a book. Would like a little more smell out of it but it tastes great. Highly recommend it."
"Almost pitch black with a toasty/fruity perfume. Dried fruit, dark fruit and molasses come to mind. Creamy head sticks well to the sides of the glass and hardly drops. Rich and sweet. There's some husky grain in the background that I'm surprised I can taste, and a muted fruitiness. Coffee and cocoa flavours are as smooth as the body, and a light carbonation gives this a bit of zip without roughening the mouthfeel. Flavors are well balanced, and nothing is over-the-top. Very drinkable."
"A pleasant stout from Left Hand. Not too sweet, not too roasty."
"Drinkability: I'd have no problem knocking back several of these in an evening. Yummy stuff."
"D: Among the best milk stouts I've tried. Not your biggest stout, but very smooth and calm. Quite bold flavors considering the low ABV."
"Poured into a standard chilled sixteen ounce pint glass. Rigorous pour leaves about an eighth inch white head. No lace. Deep black color is indicative of stouts though I wouldn't have guessed it was a milk stout on flavor. Tastes and pours more like an espresso or coffee stout. I was expecting a creamier flavor. Thought he mouthfeel is typical the aftertaste is a bit flat."
"D: easy to drink, flavor is similar to some imperial stouts i've had just not quite as heavy"
"A smooth tasty stout. Definitely one to try."
"Pours a very dark brown with an offwhite head that leaves some lacing. Taste up front was sweet with hints of chocolate/molasses sweetness with roasted malt. This beer has an amazing mouthfeel. It is smooth with great mouth coating and wickedly smooth. Overall a very drinkable beer."
"Poured a deep dark color with a foamy head that quickly dissipated. Aroma was of roasted malt, biscuity. Taste was very mellow and smooth malt and bread up front. On the back of the tongue and throat I found the flavor diminshed. Where I expected some balance from hops at the end, there was just more malt, sort of fizzles. Mouthfeel was quite good; nice carbonation surrounds the mouth. drinkability is OK, this is not strong tasting in any way, I just found that I almost got bored with the taste profile and lack of hop balance."
"Overall, a good beer and a great session stout."
"Black, with just a hit of reddish color on the edges when held up to the light. 3 finger head. Smells really good, has a coffee smell. Taste has that coffee come through more, and chocolate, there are hops, but they balance this brew out perfectly! This is one mighty fine brew! One of the smoothest beers I have had! Great beer..."
"Overall - A very good and well balanced stout... recommended..."
"D- A pretty rich, but enjoyable beer. It's got a lot of flavor for the ABV."
"Poured a dark brown, almost black into a goblet with a 1-finger bone-white head. Aroma is chocolate, berry sweetness, some breadiness. Taste is some toasted grain, lots of sweetness with chocolate and vanilla notes, as well as a hint of char. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with not too much carbonation, expected for the style. Drinkability is massive as this is a very unoffensive brew which is one of my personal favorite styles, as well as a low ABV. Overall this is a great beer and if I could find it in a 6-pack I may pick it up again."
"Umami - All in all, a good beer that I will try again, this time with the patience to let it come up to proper serving temperature."
"almost black in color, small light tan quickly fading head with a spotty lace. smell is strong with coffee aromas. malty sweet coffee taste smooth silky mouthfeel with a good carbonation. nice taste, enjoyable beer. not a session beer but a good desert beer."
"Pours a mohagany-brown with almost no head, but there is a tan layer that developes on top. The smell is heavy on malt and hints of some sugar and chocolate. The taste is great! There's chocolate, burnt sugar and it all lingers with almost no maltiness. This has been my go to milk stout for several years and it never fails!"
"Drinkability: I know it is a bit high, but a very sessionable stout...I could easily have a six and right now this is my new benchmark for this style"
"Smooth, low carbonation easy drinking stout. Roasty sweet malts are balanced somewhat by a mild hop bitterness and a touch of dark berry fruitiness. Medium body and slides down the throat with ease. A fine American example of a milk stout and perhaps the most accessible. It's not going to bowl you over with flavor or alcohol, but would make a great cool weather tailgate beer."
"This beer poured very dark, almost black with a relatively thin (true to style) head that dissipated rather quickly. The nose of this brew is dominated by a roasted coffee scent with hints of sweet chocolate peeking through. The taste is very similar to the nose but with a bit more sweetness. I was surprised at how easy this was on the palette. Its got everything you look for in a stout but is more drinkable than any I've yet tried. The mouthfeel is smooth, not very creamy but easy on the tongue as there isnt much bitterness in the aftertaste. This beer is extremely drinkable and would make a great session beer for someone who loves stout or may be a little intimidated by the typical bitterness many stouts offer. I'll be buying it again and recommending it for sure."
"This beer poured a deep dark brown, almost black. About a finger of mocha colored head that recedes rapidly. The nose was sweet and slightly nutty. There is a strong chocolate and mild coffee scent to this beer. The taste was smooth and sweet, the added lactose sugars adding a rich component to the flavor. Burnt coffee notes mix with some dark chocolate tints. The mouthfeel was good - slightly thin feeling, but also slightly creamy. I really enjoyed this beer. It's highly drinkable and will be a session beer for me in the future."
"D..Easy drinking stout. Great taste, decent mouthfeel and wonderful warm feeling as it is consumed. Two or three are perfect for a cold winter's day or night. I would imagine best served with hearty meals (e.g. thick stews, steaks, chops, etc.)."
"Pours a dark black color, average tannish head, lasting. Weak aroma(could be the smoky atmosphere), hard to describe. Coffee, chololately, water taste, creamy. Clean aftertaste. Light tasty drink. Not too complex, but good."
"M&D: full-bodied (110%!) for a 5.2%abv. stout, very light in carbonation and soft indeed to make this a quaffable dark ale. The rich yet smooth mouthfeel comes from the oats and milk sugar for sure, but it is the quietly bitter and slightly chewy edge as well as the delicate sourness that really sums up the palate beautifully."
"D: I really like this stout. I haven't had a huge amount of this style but this rates highly amongst the ones I have had. I am pleased I have 3 more of these to go. It's a very enjoyable brew and I'd be happy to recommend it and keep some on hand."
"drinkability- this really filled me up but it was a good beer."
"Drinkability? I don't think I can get this particular Left Hand beer here, but I wish I could get a case. Great stuff."
"not a bad little milk stout! quite enjoyable, drink it along with dessert if you want something of a lower alcohol content."
"Overall-- be sure to give this a try if you like stouts-- especially sweeter ones"
"D- I would love to have many of these but the thickness would only allow for 2-3. Great beer! I am lucky to have a bar close by who has this on tap."
"D: Feels like a meal, you can really only drink a few of these."
"Overall Pretty good, fits the style well and is very creamy and smooth with little carbonation. Too think to drink more than maybe two of though."
"D: Nice 'n Sweet, flavors are nicely mixed.... Second favorite Milk Stout, after Duck Rabbit.... Well with trying and easy to drink."
"No annoying anything going on here, a very nice balance. I will be trying this again soon."
"The beer pours a deep black color with a thin tan head that fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a nice black patent scent, but not much else. It has a rather dry aroma. The taste is above average. It has a rich black malt flavor with a dry, yet slightly sweet finish. It is very dark and hides the lactose addition. It's not as sweet as other milk stouts I've had. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with a little lacking in carbonation. This is a decent stout, but nothing more. It has a one sided flavor and aroma and is undercarbonated. It's one and done for me"
"Pours deep, dark brown with a small head. The head dissolves almost immediately, and leaves a thin tan lacing. The aroma is sweet and dark chocolatey, with a touch of caramel. Milk chocolate is the first taste, then a mild bitterness from the hops comes in. I get a hint of dark cherries in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, and carbonation is a bit harsh."
"Delicious and drinkable. Definitely glad I have a few more bottles of this one. A bit different from other milk stouts I've had, but in a good way. More roasty, woody, and charred, and a bit less syrupy and chocolate-bar sweet. Definitely could have a few more right now."
"Pours dark brown to black, head maxes out around 1/2""" then dissipates immediately with pretty much no lacing at all. Smell is dense and acidic, taste is immediately coffee, toffee, and milk chocolatey. Mouthfeel is medium for a stout but has an acidic, alcohol overtone. Drinkability is just average on this one, there are much better stouts to be had."
"Pours a dark burnt umber colour with a 1/8 inch head that disappears immediately. The reviewer that sited a 2 finger head must have poured this baby a foot and a half from his glass. Lace is minimal if at all. The smell and taste is all about coffee and dark chocolate. Very smooth on the palate, perhaps a little too (missing a bit of carbonation). A tad on the sweet side, but overall a very friendly stout with a lot more character than a typical import such as Murphys. But in fairness, you could drink a few more Murphys than Left Hands. Character takes its toll."
"Notes - This is a tasty, cocoa-essenced, lactic stout."
"Date consumed: 12 August 2008"
"I'd definitely buy this one again and again. Much better than Cats. Good all the way around-- except for the slight hoppy twang at the finish."
"Beautiful pour, nice pillowy head. Opaque coloured as it should be. A bit off on the smell, hard to discribe, pretty average for the style. Nice lacing down the glass. Pretty thick beer, a bit of hop twinge on the backend. Chocolatey, coffee-like malt. Highly drinkable. Nice offering, I will get this more often."
"This is a decent milk stout but not one that I would necessarily seek out again."
"This is not heavy - it's an easy drinker ... tasty and smooth all around."
"Taste is very nice for about one beer, but a little too sweet to drink muliple. Reminds me of chocolate milk. Slight hint of roasted malt. Not too chewy, and would go great with a chocolate desert."
"Black in color. There is just a faint ruby sort of highlight around the edges when held to the light. Nice foamy head. Deep, almost a vanilla sweetness to the aroma. Creamy malt flavor. Sweet, roasted malt. Any hop bitterness is minimal the malt really shines thru. Slight chocolate tinge. I love the silky, creamy flavor. Body is a tad thin considering the creamy flavor I would expect more. A great beer- I could make an easy evening of this."
"D - I'm sorry but I was not impressed...I like milk stouts but I don't know if this bottle was bad or not...the date was fine...maybe I'll have to give it another shot at some point down the road"
"This is a very sessionable stout that is only held back on drinkability by the dominance of the sweetness. Still, a very good stout."
"It's kinda cloying. Pretty decent sweet stout though."
"8/4/6/3/14 (3.5/5)"
"First offering I've had from Left Hand, and I liked it. Dark, dark brown with a tan head. Sweet aroma of cocoa and cream, almost like a hot chocolate. Smooth, sweet taste as well, with some roasted malts and chocolate milk. Very close to a watery milkshake. Enjoyable beer."
"Drinkability: easy to drink. This would be a great stout for a beginner. Good flavor very drinkable due to the creaminess."
"A very dark stout with a tan head. The smell is of cream sugar chocolate, malt and a hint of vanilla. the taste is of malt, chocolate milk brown sugar, a bit of floral and vanilla and spice. Very velvety creamy mouth feel. A smooth finish that has a hint of bitterness. I Like this beer very much"
"Overall-a well made Milk Stout, light, sweet and easy to drink, well worth a purchase."
"Yet another damn good beer from Left Hand. I didn't care for the first few I tried but these last ones are dead on. Aroma of vanilla, milk and malt. Pour was a deep dark brown with a thin light tan ring of a head. The taste was delicious. Milky and sweet with nice carbonation and just the right mouthfeel. Milk, vanilla and roasted malt in the front and a creamy aftertaste. I love sweet stouts and this is a great one."
"Good enough to enjoy, but a little too mild and a little too sweet; not real robust or flavorful. Mackeson's has nothing to fear from this one."
"I am currently drinking this. After the pour, the color is very dark almost ruby in color. The head is thin but typical for a stout. The taste is caramel, chocolate, a hint of the milk when it finishes, and is sweet. For those who drink stout, it would be considered on the mid level end. I would put it below Guinness and way below Rasputin. A good stout but not great."
"D - easy to drink. I have to admit that I am drinking it at a colder temp them recommended but it still tastes really good."
"Decent little sweet stout, this one is. I've had it a few times and its good but not great."
"A decent stout. Nothing overly complex, but enjoyable."
"D - Call me crazy but even with the odd flavor this beer seemed very drinkable. I'm not sure what that overpowering characteristic was but it didn't ruin it for me. It was just different. I'd like to try another sample."
"A simple, dependable, straightforward beer. Not the most complex, but worth having a six-pack every couple months."
"Strange one this, not rich or really creamy as a true Milk Stout should be. An OK beer, but missing something in its style."
"I love the initial flavor, I enjoy the """sourness""" and coffee flavor. as I continue to drink them they get less and less impressive though, I think this would make a top shelf session beer though, I plan on sharing this with friends at our next tasting"
"Drinkability is good though nice enjoyable easy drinking stout not over complex or kick you in the ass you nice smooth easy drinking. Make a good choice for nice evening session brews."
"Pours a pretty darn black color with some ruby hints at the edges and a minimal and short lived tan head. Smell is quite nice. At first this beer smells overwhelming sweet but the quickly fades and this beer evens out a bit with roasted notes become dominant through not overpowering. Coffee and a bit of cocoa are present with a very nice cream-like sweetness lingering in the background. Taste is like the aroma. Roasted flavors are dominant and take on cocoa and coffee notes (in the order). Bitterness is just sjy of moderate and sweetness is moderate making for an interesting finish where the attenuation of the beer as well as the roasted grains combine for a drying effect while the added lactose provides sweetness. Overall this is a bit more on the roasted side but the sweetness shines through a bit more at times. Mouthfeel is pretty good, maybe a bit light or the style with what I'd characterize as only a medium body despite the residual sugars for the lactose. The lactose seems to enhance the body a bit but this still seems a bit thin. Carbonation is spot on at a low-moderate level. Drinkability is quite good. I think that the more moderate body, while a bit light for the style helps make this a bit more quaffable. I enjoyed this beer quite a bit, its easy drinking and well balanced yet interesting."
"D: Impressive offering that coupled smoothly with Skeletonwitch on the eve of the coolest holiday."
"Nice stout, lean but decent nonetheless. Roasted aroma with a kick of sweetness, sugary and appealing. Poured a semi-transparent dark brown, medium head that quickly dwindled and no lacing. Thin for a stout but he smoothness helps alleviate this. Flavor is good, creamy and sweet which really counters the roasted bitterness. Not blown away but it's a very drinkable tasty stout."
"Overall a very drinkable beer, that's a bit creamier than some other milk stouts I've had. Not my favorite stout, not even my favorite milk stout, but a good one nonetheless."
"Overall, excellent choice!"
"Future outlook: Barring unforeseen circumstances, repeat business not expected to occur. Thankful to have purchased only a single."
"Overall a very drinkable beer that's easy on the palate."
"This beer has a unique taste with the first few sips but the sourness gains the more you drink and near the end is nothing impressive nor desired. I would not drink another."
"This reminds me more of an oatmeal stout than a sweet/milk stout as there isn't much lactose flavor. That's not necessarily a bad thing. The aroma is rich with chocolate grains and fresh java. The flavor follows the same notes with a bit of milk chocolate, almost like hot chocolate, but with a mild, bitter black pepper finish. The body is neither too thick or thin, call it just right. There's a obvious roasted taste and bitter feel (in addition to the hops) and while I wouldn't drink this all night, it's good for a few pint fulls."
"Left Hand's Milk Stout is pretty good. It has a thick, heavy (almost sticky) feeling in your mouth with the characteristic milk stout sweetness. This is probably a terrific brew for Guinness drinkers with a sweet tooth. If you're looking for an imperial stout, you're looking in the wrong place."
"D - A solid, drinkable stout. Though not as sweet as I'd expected, it isn't over-the-top dry and provides a refreshing take on the style, emphasizing coffee over chocolate and caramel. Perhaps slightly off the beaten path, but a great beer nonetheless."
"Taste was sweet. No joke. Not candy-cloying, but definitely sweet. What I found astounding was the real milky taste and mouth feel. I liked the ever-so-slight dry, bitter finish.Overall just so smooth. Like chocolate milk. I will drink more."
"A black, thick body with a light tan head that died quickly and left minor lacings. A light malt smell, a little weak, and a tad funky. Medium to full-bodied, a smooth and semi-creamy mouth texture, there are some sweet and roasted malts in the taste but they are not overly prevelant. Not a bad beer at all, pretty good, but I was expecting more. Not the greatest of stouts (not meant to be a criticism)."
"This was the first Left Hand brew I ever had (found it in a river in the Rockies, just like Busch) and I was pleasantly surprised. Very tasty milk stout. Very ordinary to look at. Smells very milk-stouty. Tastes great. Creamy, chocolatey cocoa puffs flavor, which melds perfectly with the mouthfeel. Combine all this with the low ABV and it's a highly drinkable beverage."
"M + D: A nice shimmer of carbonation, and a reasonable creaminess - might have expected it to be a bit fuller, but it's still a decent feel. Not a big fave, but I'd give it another chance."
"D: Very drinkable stout, definately worth a try."
"Highly recommended. Well done boys!"
"Appearance is pretty good, a very dark black, with a slightly tan colored head and some lacing. Smell and taste are good. This tastes like sweet milky coffee, with a dry after taste that dissapates quickly. Mouthfeel is medium to full body with low carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good."
"After one of these I've had enough. On to something else."
"D - Definitely has the roasty and chocolate taste that I crave. Thank you sir, may I have another?"
"Pours a very dark black color with very little brown toned head, decent lacing. Aroma is a very strong chocolate and roasted malt. taste at first its a tad bitter and tangy with small notes of hops, but strong chocolate and roasted malt flavors all the way through. Good beer smooth throughout, easy to drink, great stout very enjoyable to drink."
"The mouthfeel is slightly -- and I mean very slightly -- thin for the style, but with flavor like this, I could really give a damn. This stuff is downright tasty."
"Pleasantly surprised by this one."
"I'm not a huge fan of stouts, but this one is very drinkable, not too bitter and quite tasty."
"D - this is an enjoyable stout. There is a nice blend of sweetness and roasty-ness that makes it pretty easy to drink."
"D - OK going down but not that remember or special."
"I don't think I could reach for this again but it's fairly enjoyable, nice but typical. and typical is just ok."
"Out of the bomber this beer was an almost-black with some deep garnet highlights near the edges. The head was tan, about two fingers thick, but quickly became a minimal skim that did not lace very well. The aromas were sweet and rich, Hershey's syrup milk chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, caramel malts. The flavors were at first dominated by the smoky, roasted malt flavors and coffee followed closely by the chocolate sweetness. Silky mouthfeel, very creamy and filling. Hints of vanilla develop as it warms. Well rounded, drinkable and rewarding in a desert-like way without being overly sweet. Recommended."
"D= A good stout, but much less sweet than most of the milk stouts I have had."
"I thought this was a fantastic brew! Might be a little too rich and sweet for some but outstanding in my book!"
"D-Great version of this style. Goes great with vanilla ice cream"
"Smooth and silky without being viscous. Lactic twang emerges with the alcohol at the end. Neither are distracting but rather welcome, and the chocolate never subsides. It is maybe more heavily toasted than what I would expect from a milk stout, but I still love it. I'm not a judge but a guy who likes good beer. This does all the things for me I want from a stout. Imagine if it were stored cold and not a year old (maybe it just ages nicely). Looking forward from more Left Hand stuff."
"D- Very, very drinkable. This one will be in my fridge all the time from now on (unless I find something better). Definitely a great session beer. Not too filling, and very easy to drink. I could start drinking this at 5 p.m. and still be drinking it at 2 a.m."
"Overall, a good milk stout that is not overly complex, but has the necessities in there."
"Drinkability: A really great milk stout, and one I'm pleased to finally review, even though the venue may not have been perfect for the style. This is one I'd love to have at home on a cold winter night or paired with a heavy dessert. The abv% was completely manageable and nothing was too sweet or cloying - an excellent milk stout."
"Pours a nice black with amber/ruby highlights and a nice fluffy light tan head. Nose is alot of chocolate and roasted malt. Taste follows with notes of chocolate and cocoa, a bit of dark fruitiness and that lactose kick. A solid malt profile with a nice smooth silky mouthfeel. Drinkability is very nice and suprisingly refreshing for a beer of this darkness and body. Overall a very good example of the style, and surely one of the better milk stouts out there. I am glad to see more of this style getting some recognition. Good beer."
"Smooth brew. Its not over carbonated and the flavors coat your entire mouth as you drink. The finish is a little chalky for my taste but all in all a very tasty beverage."
"Picked up a six pack to give the beer a second try (the first try was a single bottle in a beer bar). I have got to say that upon a second tasting, the aroma was more pronounced, not really different than the first time, just more robust. Same with the taste, except that I got that hint of sweetness that I was looking for. Upon further review, a much better beer than I gave it credit for."
"M&D-Mouthfeel is extremly light with almost no hints of carbonation, Pretty drinkable brew just don't expect to be real blown away."
"Overall I think this is probably a nice tasty dependable beer. Not something I'll ever crave, maybe something I'll revisit. Didn't blow my socks off but essentially left me wanting to see what others in this style have to offer. This one was approachable but I don't think it will become a habit."
"From what I have read, this may be better on tap than in the bottle. I find it to be a nice, pleasant drinking dark beer. I poured well with a wonderful creamy head. If smooth and creamy is what you are looking for this may be your beer. It is on the sweeter side as are all milk stouts. It first tastes like a nice cold sweet cream coffee. Then comes the character of vanilla and roasted malts. The finish is similar to that of tiramisu or of bitter-sweet bakers chocolate. It would make a wonderful compliment to a large dinner with dessert. I prefer a nice brew to scotch anyway."
"Great beer/although a little on the light side/ from a not so great company. Kudos."
"Definitely recommend. It's a very good low ABV stout. Check it out if you can get it."
"It's not quite as good as Mackeson XXX, but this one is still a great Milk Stout. This is probably one of the silkiest feeling beers I have had. Recommended."
"I really liked Left Hand's Black Jack Porter so I thought I'd try this. It poured a deep black with ruby edges into my pint glass and smelled like roasted chocolate and coffee. The taste was about the same, mostly bitter chocolate and roasted malts. I'm a sucker for milk stouts and this didn't disappoint, but I've had better versions of this style. I could drink a couple of these, but I prefer Left Hand's porter to this. Still a great beer that's worth a try."
"D: Ehh, a little rich to be drinking more than one, however given its style, not bad"
"D- Due to the richness of the flavors, drinkability loses some points. Overall, this is an underrated beer that I will surely revisit again."
"This is my first try of Lefthand Brewery that I got on a whim, and I will be back for more. Oh, and oddly enough, I reached for an amish cookie while I drank this. Made the perfect pair for me aside from 2%."
"Light bodied feel with and extra creamy ,airy mouthfeel. Excellent drinkability from a milk stout,not a style i normally would drink more than a couple of."
"Overall, a decent stout. I've never had a sweet stout before, but I think there are better stouts in the world. If someone offered it to me, I'd drink it without much of a thought."
"Notes:	A great complementing characteristic of malt and hop"
"Grainy oats smooth this brew out, making it a very tasty and easy drinker, especially in the summer heat. Creamy and smooth body - Another fine Left Hand brew."
"D-Very satisfied, will look foward to having another and/or trying some of Left Hand's other products."
"Pours thick and dark with a brown one inch head in my mug. Been a while since I've had a stout. Burnt roasty smell with coffee, cocoa, and cream... a smokey, woody, hot cocoa almost. Taste- Kinda smokey... light coffee, a sorta creamy presence from whatever milk is present... Really the one word I can come up with this is smokey but I'll let it warm up to let it unfold... The cream flavor opens up more as it warms but again it's rather smokey with just a hint of lingering coffee bitterness and a tad minerally in the finish.... I can't really detect cocoa in the flavor as much as in the smell. I prefered my initial sniff of this stuff than it's taste. As far as drinkability I'd say it goes down pretty easily but I'm a bit dissapointed in the flavor... too much smoke, I was expecting milk chocolate... oh well"
"Drinkability is very top notch. I'd recommend drinking these on a Friday night with friends as well as serving it to people who want a nice, thick, satisfying brew. What a great stout!"
"Mouthfeel was not bad, smooth and ended very dry, leaving you wanting more. Could drink a few of these but not too many."
"A great beer. I'd definitely have it again."
"Eric"
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark brownish black color with a light tan head. The aroma is dark roasted malts with a good dose of coffee flavors, very nice. The taste is very smooth up front with nice dark roasted flavors with some dark bitter coffee and chocolate flavors in the finish. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with a moderate amount of carbonation. Overall, Left Hand Milk Stout is a solid stout that is definitely worth a shot. Recommended."
"D- Not too bad but its not something I could drink all the time."
"D- pretty damn good, im into the dark beers right now, and in the hot weather really hits the spot without going too intense. solid drinking time"
"Taste is of mocha very smooth and creamy. There's some nice coffee taste in there as well as it's hidden by the sweetness at first. Very nice."
"D - This is very easy to drink great taste and very smooth a little heavy to drink before I BBQ but it would be a good dessert beer worth trying"
"D - Too many might weigh down in your stomach. Otherwise quite good. I'll admit, I was scared of this one, but it was a pleasant surprise."
"Drinkability: Not bad! A flavorful, sweetish milk stout."
" But having said that the beer was smooth and velvetly if you can get over the taste. As for drinkability if you like coffe in your beer,go for it"
"Drinkability is fairly high. Low alcohol and good flavor makes this beer easy to consume."
"nice carbonation and a great full body. i really dig this beer. smooth. i would pay for more of this beer."
"Pours a nice dark brown color. Chocolate and mild roastiness in the aroma. Flavour is very nice with strong notes of milk chocolate and some roasty, coffee and sugary milk notes. smooth oh palate. Dry and sweet finish. I can definitely pillage this beer."
"very smooth and creamy. a good malty sweetness to it that is balanced well with a slight bite. rich and velvety but very drinkable. one of my favorites."
"B'ham UK"
"D: Well, it's light bodied, but the over-the-top (for the style) carbonation hurts drinkability for me. I think of milk stouts as one of the ultimate smooth drinkers, but this one just wasn't there. I'm giving a 3 because it would be easy to put a lot of these down, but it isn't drinkable in the sense that I think a milk stout should be. See Mackeson's Triple Stout for a better stylistic example that is widely available."
"Full bodied and creamy, but with nice carbonation to keep it light on the palate. Slight lingering essence/feel/taste of a Starbuck's mocha."
"D: Very drinkable. Easy to put down a sixer of this without thinking about it. Highly recommend because this is a fine milk stout."
"Verdict: Worth picking up for the fact that it's easy to drink."
"This Stout pours a Coca-cola brown with a foamy A&W rootbeer float head that leaves lots of spider web lacing everywhere.The nose is mostly chocolate and cream,kind of smells like an Oreo cookie.The taste is mild coffee with whole milk creamer,dark bitter chocolate,and vinilla mousse.This seems light for a stout and a little too sweet as well,but it's still delicious,and highly drinkable."
"Smells of coffee and semi-sweet chocolate. Pours to an opaque dark brown but with little to no head. Taste is kind of butterscotch-like. Slight hopping detectable in aftertaste. Surprisingly light for the style. A very good beer I would drink again. Drinkability is high both for flavor and consistency."
"appearance is black as night (well dark dark brown), nice brown tinted head. aroma is rich, deep malt, subtle chocolate notes, maybe some vanilla extract. Taste is delicious! rich malts, hints of wood, cocoa. no real distinct hop notes. medium to full bodied. low to medium carbo. Delicious beverage!!!"
"I tasted this beer in a 12 ounce bottle. Milk stout didn't make much sense to me at first but I am glad I tried it. An excpetional Stout! The appearance of this beer was dark with a light head and it had a light burnt smell. This beer is exceptionally smoothe for a stout and it is certainly another beer I will suggest to all my beer friends"
"D - Very tasty stout. I would drink this as a session beer. Not overwhelming in any way but not bad at all."
"This had a unique taste to it. I enjoyed it slightly chilled in my Warsteiner mug. Poured a dark, black coffee brown with a dark tan head. Smelled of dark roasted coffee with a hint of creamer and mocha. Tasted like dark roast coffee, very chewy, with that sweet milk aftertase that really intrigued me. I liked this one a lot."
"Pitch black colored beer with aroma of chocolate and coffee.Taste is chocolate/cocoa and espresso.Aftertaste is the same after you drink a sweetened cup of fresh coffee.This is something I would definetly recommend and buy again,although I doubt I could drink more than a few at one sitting!!"
"M&D: This is a big bold chewy stout, just the way I like 'em. It's heavy in the mouth and incredibly satisfying. The carbonation is fine and light, lending itself extremely well to the creamy texture that is imparted on the palate. This is a very good brew and I would happily drink this again."
"D - Very enjoyable beer. Great milk stout, sweet and rich made it a very drinkable beer. Highly recommended."
"Pours a beautiful dark chocolate brown with a dense, rocky, two-finger head and thick chunky lacing. Smell is of coffee and caramel. Strong caramel and roasted coffee flavors. Heavy on the chocolate malts. Very light on the hops. Very creamy and rich. nice smooth mouthfeel. An all around good stout."
"D: This is not a beer I can recommend. As I said, it's simply too thin for a stout of any kind."
"With such rich bold flavors I don't believe that I could down the whole sixer. I would say drink this about as much as you would chocolate milk which for me would only be as a sinful treat to myself."
"Aroma is strong and smoky with hints of fine coffee. It pours a dark, almost opaque, chocolate brown, not quite as dark as most stouts I have tried; head is very thick, tan, fine-bubbled and persistent. Flavor is rich, with an overtone of unsweetened chocolate and strong smoky and coffee hints. It goes down smoothly and leaves an aftertaste like burnt coffee mixed with bitter chocolate."
"Overall, this is one of the best sweet stouts I have had. I will definitely have this one again."
"D: A very decent milk stout. I prefer oatmeals & milks, over a dry stout. I can see having some of these in the fridge."
"D: A nice, drinkable beer due to a nice mix of a good taste and smooth mouthfeel. Nice roasted taste balanced by the sweeter aftertaste makes the beer excellent overall."
"This beer poured a dark black color with a huge, fluffy, tan head. The aroma was of roasted malts. Couldn't detect much else. The taste was of chocolate and coffee. The body was a lot lighter than expected and the carbonation was medium. Overall this beer was great. I wish we had this beer in LA!!! I say that a lot. Pathetic."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a nearly opaque dark brown with 2 cm of foamy tan head that is mostly diminishing. Aroma is sweet malt and smoke. Initial flavor is is chocolate and cream. Flavor ends more malty. After taste lingers for a short time. Light lacing, next to no carbonation, light to medium body, and alcohol didn't really make its presence known. Very drinkable beer that pretty much follows what I expected."
"Not mind blowing, but a good, solid, easy-drinking stout. Reminds me a bit of Old No. 38 from North Coast Brewing."
"Drinkability - I've reviewed a few milk stouts and it is nice to expand my palette with another offering."
"nice beer. my first introduction to the milk stout category, and i'll gladly go back."
"Overall - Good, but not quite the quality I expect from stouts."
"A quality milk stout. This was the first beer from Left Hand that I have tried. I will be buying more and recommending this to any stout fan I know."
"Drinkability: This was a very fun stout to drink. I constantly felt challenged with how to define the tastes and smells I was experiencing. The smoothness and the sweet tones really make a relaxing experience."
"D: Moderate ABV and good mouthfeel makes for a very drinkable beer."
"An interesting mix of qualities that combine for a nicely drinkable beer of good, but not great quality or satisfaction."
"Mouthfeel is obviously creamy and slick. Kind of filling, so one is enough for now. this is a pretty good dessert beer, and I'm glad it is now in KC."
"Pours a clear very dark brown with a slim tan head. Nose is a nice cocoa powder. Flavor is nice and smooth. Good sweet tone. Nice milky edge. Mild cocoa properties. Noticeable roasted edge. Good, smooth feel. This is a very easy drinking stout. I might venture to say that it could be one to sway non-beer drinkers right on over to our side."
"Tastes smooth as it pours. Its sweet and feels like chocolate milk in your mouth. This is an interesting beer that I'm glad I had the chance to try. I don't know how many of these I could drink back to back, its pretty sweet and I'd be crazing some hop bitterness after the second one."
"MF&D - A little thin with a slightly carbonated mouthfeel. It did however manage to coat my mouth and allow the flavor to hang around. This is a decent example of this style. I'm glad I tried it, but I'm not sure I'd go out of my way for it. If you enjoy Milk/Sweet Stout it's definatly worth a try."
"Tried this on tap last Thursday at the Kinsale in Government Center. Came in a pint glass, and the color was black as night. No head whatsoever, and the beer almost looked flat from the lack of carbonation. The smell was malty and aromatic. Taste-wise, this was my first milk stout, and an interesting introduction. All I could think of was that someone mixed half glass of stout with half a glass of chocolate milk. It was almost too sweet. I would be interested to try another milk stout to see if others are as sugary. Even sweeter than Young's Double Chocolate Stout. I think you could drink a few of these because it is so sweet tasting, which is fine. But a few sweet beers may not be the best session beer out there. A nice beer to try once or to have with a dessert. Don't have this after an IPA, like I did."
"D: Not too sure how drinkable this beer would be, because of the sweetness, but I can't stop drinking this!"
"It had all these great flavors, but I had to work a little to get them out, and it left me wishing for just a bit """more""". A great start, and it will get me looking for more Left Hand beers out of curiosity."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a 16oz glass, we have before us a dark, opaque beer which lets almost no light through even when held up to a light. A tan-coloured head which quickly dissipates to a ring of bubbles around the edge of the glass and not much lacing. Malty, coffee aromas coming from the glass, and these are repeated in the taste with some added caramel hints and the merest suggestion of hops. A good balance of sweetness and bitterness. Not too heavy on the mouthfeel... just about right I'd say. Overall a very nice, though not exactly exceptional, milk stout. I'd be very content to drink this all evening. Yum."
"Poured black with a ruby hue. The head was tan colored and thick with tight bubbles - some lacing. The aroma is a bit caramel. The taste is roasted and chocolaty. The mouthfeel is on the thick side. This is a nice, smooth beer that I'd consider quite drinkable but Widmer Snow Plow is much better."
"poured into a snifter. pours an opaque black color with a tan head that drops rather quickly. Strong malt aroma, chocolate, milky(lactos) some caramel and coffee, big chocolate malted milk aroma. Big malty flavor, chocolate malts with a slight coffee flavor. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel, low/mild carbonation, and not too heavy. delicious, I could drink several of these, very drinkable."
"Left Hand Milk Stout pours a clear black color with a few deep red highlights. A thin, tan head leaves a bit of lacing on the glass. The smells is sweet, creamy chocolate with some coffee. I also smelled some baked bread: kind of like pizza dough/crust. The taste is roasty, chocolaty with some coffee. Toward the end of the glass, I started getting some very mouth-watering sweetness. This is probably the best stout I've tried so far. I could easily drink a few in a sitting."
"Nice black pour with tan head of a medium thickness. Smell is of rich, creaminess, and roastiness with big chocolate scents. Very creamy, like rich roasty chocolate milk. Very smooth, and flavorful. Nice light carbonation, good mouthfeel, and great stout overall. Would have again."
"The nitro version of this is excellent too. Make sure to follow the directions and pour aggressively to get the tumbling effect a la Guinness. Excellent 1-2 inch light tan creamy head that lasts forever. Wonderful thick lacing. Silky smooth from the nitro...seems to add more heft to the feel too. Nitro rating 5/4/5/5/5."
"O: Overall very smooth, easy deep chocolate roast with a touch of sweetness. good to style."
"Don't drink and review."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied with moderate carbonation. This one goes down extremely smooth and is very drinkable. This is an impressive beer. I could drink this all night."
"D - pretty good! This is my second milk stout, and I really liked it. Would drink again. I will say that I think the Duck Rabbit Milk Stout is superior, but like I said this was served in pitcher form with frosted glasses (ugh, we only went to this place because my gf and my friend's gf both wanted wings), so maybe that took something away from it. Either way, a good beer!"
"The Left Hand Milk Stout is a very pleasant beer. The mouthfeel is a bit less full than dictated by the style, but in the end, I think that just adds to the beer's overall drinkability."
" ~ Everyone should try this beer. I will certainly recommend the Milk Stout to all my friends. A great job done by our friends in Colorado."
"This is one of the best stouts that I have tried. I highly recommend this Stout."
"D: A one."
"D: I could drink this one all day long. The flavors are pleasing and never push the tastebuds too far."
"my 2nd milk stout was this one bottled 8-28-07 ; pours a deep reddish brown color w/ a decent tan head that lasts a few minutes and leaves a decent lacing ; nose is mainly toasted nuts w/ alcoholic and darker roasted malts and dark fruit undertones , faint buttery diacetyl present as well ; a rich, toasty, nut-like malt flavor w/ some burnt-toast notes initially, followed by a bittersweet chocolate and coffee, very faint metallic aftertaste ; rich, med-bodied brew w/ a nice level of co2, lots of residual sweetness ; quite drinkable, i look forward to having this and other milks soon ..."
"M/D: Full bodied, very subtle carbonation feels nice on the palate and tongue. Drinkability is good on this one, very tasty and smooth."
"Low carbonation makes this brew a gem. No aftertaste even for a beer as dark as West Texas Crude Very easy to drink and I could drink another one of these. Why did I buy just one."
"Very dark cola color with dark red highlights and a small but creamy chocolate milk colored head that quickly dies leaving patchy lace. Some sweet milk chocolate and oats in the nose along with toasted black malts. More of the same in the taste. Some sweet cream as well, with light woodsy, earthy, tea-like hops in the finish. Light in body--but a touch crisp and sharp--the mouthfeel falls two steps short of creamy. This one ain't bad (you could do a lot worse), but it's nothin' to write home about neither."
"D: I would drink this again but would probably not seek it out. The flavors were great but appearance and mouthfeel were disappointing."
"D- though a little light in color, i think the malt content is without question. upon reading other reviews i'm assuming that this beer is better on tap than it is from the bottle. something to keep in mind. it's a great blend of texture and flavor and perhaps slightly more drinkable than other stouts that scored higher in A, S, & T."
"This is not a bad stout, but it's not terribly exciting. Meh."
"Drinkability: Highly recommended for any fan of Milk/Sweet Stouts since it delivers all of the styles characteristics to your tounge, palate and throat in a great and prominent manner."
"Drinkability may be where this one falls down a bit for me. I love this beer, but it's a little too sweet to drink several of. A bit more bitter roast coming through would probably help."
"Pours a creamy black/dark brown liquid. A nice, light beige head sticks with the beer. The aroma is a creamy sweet, milky malt. Like malted milk balls, sort of. The taste is, at first a malty sweet milk, then a more milky chocolate. with a pure chocolate with only light bitterness at the finish. The body was heavy, but still very drinkable, no thick. Very sessionable."
"This is definitely one Ill go back to. One of the best sweet/milk stouts Ive had the pleasure of trying."
"D: I'm giving the beer the benefit of the doubt and raising my scores a bit to adjust for the possibility of a tainted bottle, regretfully this was the last single on the shelf when I mixed up the sixer. Hopefully I can get this in the future and adjust my review accordingly!"
"It does have some good coffee undertones and some caramel toward the end. Overall rating is that this is a good brew to buy if you've never had it just to get it under your belt."
"Very drinkable. Could have many of these, until they start to hit the head."
"Was very drinkable and will drink the second one following this review."
"Milk stouts are by nature very drinkable beers and this one is no exception. Outstandingly easy to drink, probably could give this to kids and they would like it."
"Pours very dark with a smaller off white head, and average lacing. The smell is quite sweet with a good whiff of coco and some roasted malts. The taste has a big hit of milk chocolate and light espresso. Tails off into some roasted malts with a bit of grains sticking out at the end. The mouthfeel is interesting feeling a bit thick in my mouth, but going down like a much lighter brew. The drinkability is good due to the lightness presented. My first beer from left hand, and my first """Milk Stout""" I am happy with both"
"D: my first milk stout, a descent beer but I prefer my stout with more bitterness"
"From a 12oz bottle that I copped for about $1.69, this spectacular brew from the Left Hand company was simply outrageous... this was perhaps one of the best milk stouts I've ever sampled - bursting with flavor... appearance was a nice opaque, dark color that poured a nice frothy head... smell was full of cocoa and espresso... the taste was awesome... a strong espresso / coffee flavor that was resoundingly profound, even after a couple of brews... the flavor is a strong, rich, mocha coffee flavor with a robust espresso taste that was very noticeable... a delicious brew that was easily drinkable and had a great mouthfeel... will certainly try more beers from this brewery... a great example of the style and definitely recommended..."
"My second favorite beverage from Left Hand,the Blackjack Porter being the first.This is an exceptional Milk Stout,both flavourful and easy to drink.I enjoy this with a Punch cigar whenever I get the chance,and would recommend this to anyone that likes Stouts."
"Flavor presents a fine brew of dark malts and milk sugars, the latter of which takes the edge off the grain bill. Carbonation and mouthfeel are good. This one is very balanced, which makes for a very approachable milk stout. If you want a good session stout, this might be the right choice."
"Poured a dark rich color with very little head, but that is what I've come to expect from Taco Mac. It was very creamy and full bodied; I could sense the milk sugars in there. Not an overly complex flavour however, and about mid-way through it became old and redundant. Maybe it would help to eat at the same time, mix things up a bit."
"Drinkability- Very easy drinker. Wish we had Left Hand out on the west coast. Heck, I wish we had any milk stout this good on the west coast. Buy a 4 pack and not just a single."
"D - I think the best stout I have had so far. Very flavoursome but a ABV% that is still in the sessionable region."
"D - I like this beer a lot. This is a great stout that you can drink a couple and enjoy each one more than the last."
"This just happened to be in a recent sixer of Polestar Pilsner I purchased. Been meaning to give it a try for a while, so this was quite propitious. Pours a very dark brown, almost black with a slight tan head that dissipates fairly quickly with not much lacing to speak of. Smells of dark chocolate, burnt wood, and some slight caramel sweetness coming through. Taste is very complex with some sugary syrup, roasted almonds, malts, creamy milkiness and chocolate at the forefront, and some toffee in the background. Thick and somewhere between medium and full-bodied with none of that watered down feel some stouts and porters can tend to give you. This is a full-on surprise of a beer and one of my new faves."
"D: Very tasty, goes down easy, a little filling, mild kick, good representation of style, it’s a nice stout that I could drink a few of until I get too full and one of the better stouts that I’ve had."
"This will definitely be stocked in my fridge."
"Perfect beer for an after dinner treat...especially during the Holidays...A great converstation warmer too..."
"Note: Every thing I have tasted by left hand has been exceptional. I love the brewery as my top 5."
"EIDT - I take it back. After drinking it some more, I am definately getting that sweetness. Very well done Left Hand!"
"I thought is was a very good example of a milk stout."
"Overall impression: This is definitely what a milk stout should be. One of my favorite offerings from left hand, and one of the best examples of the style."
"Overall: A good example of a milk stout. It's not the best in the world but pretty good. It has a nice level of sweetness and malt, chocolate and coffee. I really like this beer. It is not the greatest stout in the world, but is a real nice drinker"
"d- def hard to stop at one and stout i enjoy, oh wait, smooth"
"Poured into an American pint; black and opaque in appearance. 1/2 inch tan head that dissipated into barely a thin skim. Thin consistent lacing throughout the tasting. Scent of sour milk, malt and chocolate. Mouthfeel was somewhat watery, but there was a subtle creaminess as well; very little carbonation. More flavors of chocolate, coffee, malt and toffee. Not a bad session stout."
"This beer makes for an excellent session"
"The malt is featured in the taste, chocolate and espresso with a sweet kick. Leaves a burnt coffee aftertaste. I expected a beer with more body, a little thin for the style and slightly flat. It is a good beer but not something I will be returning to anytime soon. The ABV is low so it won't hurt you if this is just one of many in session."
"This beer pours a slightly translucent black with a frothy tan head that laces well. The smell of roasted and chocolate malts. The taste is dominated by sweetness and heavy roasted malts. The mouthfeel is rather fizzy and slightly light. Overall a decent stout but not the best."
"D: This is well above average beer that is great for dessert but it is too sweet to drink all day or night."
"Drinkability: A good beer but too rich to drink more then one or two in a sitting. Would like to try it with some different desserts."
"The drinkability is good, this is really a very good example of the style. I like it. Prosit, MK"
"12 oz brown bottle into a tulip glass. bottled 9/27/07. Beer poured with fairly thin head, yet remained to the end, with light lacing. Sweet coffee smell that reminded me of some candy my mother used to eat. Did not taste as sweet as I expected, almost a little thin, but a nice coffee/smoke profile with a pleasant bitter aftertaste. I would surely have another."
"The more I sip on this stout the more it starts to taste like Im drinking smoke flavored chocolate milk."
"I almost forgot at the end that I had been drinking stout and not porter. Yet that was because of the prominent flavors and the rich texture. Milk Stout is a good find, and certainly worth a try."
"Overall, this is a fine beer and probably my new sweet stout of choice. Live in Durango now and ska makes a good one too, but have to give edge to Left Hand"
"The mouth is smooth and silky. Freaking easy drinking stout. Well done. I liked this a lot in bottles, but it moves even higher on draft. Does this brewery make a bad beer?"
"D- Nice all the way around. Very rich though so drinking more that a couple would be asking quite alot. Nice!"
"Overall this beer was very strange to me, I have never had a milk stout before, ths one tasted pretty good, although I could not get over the milk taste, it was like someone poured a beer into my milk. All and all this one I will probably have again, and I am very intrested in trying a milk stout again."
"A pleasant and inviting beer."
"Initially the smell is of coffee and cocoa, then a slight fruit wafts through the top of my mouth. The head is quick to disapate and only slightly clings to the glass. Taste is traditional milk stout only with slightly less creaminess than you might expect. Nice malt roundness, then cocoa, coffee, and iced tea fruitiness. The hops are delicate and just enough to keep this from being much to sweet."
"This is as drinkable as beer gets for me. Despite the heavy stout label, i often drink several of these over the course of a football game without tiring of it at all. Readily available to me in my area, my beer fridge is never without a stock of this one. Thank you Left Hand!"
"Poured a dark brown with about 1 inch of tan head. All in all, I was unimpressed with this beer especially coming from the imaginative people at Left Hand. The beer had a pretty sweet nose to it, but that was the most prevalent quality of the beer. The front was sweet and creamy but the flavor just died out. All the taste was up front. I just didnt think that there was a lot of depth to it."
"A typical appearance of a stout: nice and dark with lots of depth. It's smell had a faint, dairy aroma but it was more malty than milky. However, its taste and mouthfeel lived up to its name. The drink was pretty creamy but, personally, I thought it had a light structure comparatively. It also had a moderately crisp aftertaste. Overall, I think I would have wanted something heavier, though to many this would be a heavy enough drink. I would recommend this as one of the more accessible milk stouts."
"If you like this I'd also suggest trying Young's Double Chocolate Stout, which I found to be a better beer."
"But up against the Blackout, this is like drinking a chocolate milkshake. The sweet is noticeable on the nose right away, and the beer follows through on that promise -- it's thick, sweet and luscious, full of chocolate and dairy. Which is a little redundant. But true."
"Tasted strongly of roasted malt, slight hint of chocolate, and coffee as well. The roasted malt was the dominant flavor in this as well as the extra sweetness due to the milk sugars used to make it a milk stout. This reminded me more of a dark, heavy porter rather than a stout... sort of a stout on training wheels.... this would be a good beginner stout for those who are new to darker beer styles or think they do not like stouts... its good, but a couple at a time is enough sweetness.. would be good for after dinner desert!"
"Poured an attractive dark color with off-white head that hung around for a while. Aroma was of coffee and chocolate. Flavor was also of chocolate, coffee and maybe a bit of caramel. Mouthfeel was nice. Drinkability is good on this one. Maybe not the most complex, but very enjoyable"
"Drinkability - Extremely drinkable...very enjoyable and great session beer."
"D: Could drink this daily in place of anything sweet or a late night toddy. This would be great to show those resistant to dark beers that they are good and harmless. I recommend."
"D: This is a great milk stout. Very well-crafted and tasty. I could enjoy these for a long time."
"I really like Left Hand's Imperial Stout as it was really unique for its genre. This brew does the stout/milk stout category very well, and plays by all the rules. Could drink this brew all night long, it's delicately and subtlely smooth and not too much lactose was used by the feel of it. Very good in respects to the genre."
"This is a great milk stout... really smooth and creamy. It truely almost tastes as if you were drinking a glass of chocolate milk."
"I tried this on tap at a draft house near my home. The main reason I tried it was because it was on special for $2.50. I was instantly hooked and go at least once a week now. The beer pours dark with a nice head. The smell is pleasant and has a chocolaty (is that a word?) milk hint. Not something I could sit back and pound but great with a meal."
"D- This is very good; and a classic example of a milk stout. I find it very drinkable. My first brew from left hand and I am looking foreward to trying others. Well done."
"Not a very appealing beer. Closer to a Guinness than a milk stout."
"D: Very drinkable provided you're in the mood for dessert. My dessert tonight disappeared in about 1/5th the time I normally spend on a beer. Chocolate fans should not miss this one."
"Pours opaque but is reddish-brown around the edges. Initially head was tall and light brown. It did drop down, but lacing was excellent. Smells of coffee and earth as well as some chocolate. Taste also comes off as a coffee/chocolate mix, a nice touch of sweetness (but I didnt find it too sweet), with hops rolling in toward the finish and aftertaste. After a few sips I also caught some roasted malt and smokeiness. What really sticks around in the aftertaste is a nice, mild resin quality w/o too much bitterness. Mouthful was quite nice: rich and creamy w/o being thick and enough carbonation to balance everything else out (like the sweetness, I didnt find this too high). Had the pleasure of trying this on a cooling, dry pre-autumn afternoon. A great warmer and nice taste reminder of fall weather."
"Dark black with red-brown at the edge and a creamy foamy head. The first whiff is like chocolate milk. This is good because I consider myself a chocolate milk connoisseur. The taste follows suit and is creamy milky, some chocolate, excellent. This is right up there with the Duck Rabbit milk stout which is the first milk stout I actually really enjoyed. Drinkability was good for the one pint I had but I could not see drinking one more, a bomber would be perfect."
"This brew pours an opaque black color with brown hues. The head is large and tannish-white. Lacing is thorough. The aroma is of dark chocolate, cream, nuts, and roasted malt. The is like the aroma, but not quite as intense. The mouthfeel is somewhat thin for a milk stout, and carbonation is somewhat high too. Overall, this is a decent beer, but nothing I could see myself drinking again."
"Drinkability: The last beer I that is available in Nebraska (I think), although I did see a brewery mixed 12 pack with Deep Cover in it. A very good beer, of which I see few of this style. I may opt for this one again."
"Pours th darkest of browns,with a ruby hue when held to light. Thin tan head, not much retention,and good lacing. Aroma is of malty,dark chocolate. Body is medium,with a bit of carbionation. Taste is of coffee,and creamy chocolate. Good from start to finish."
"D - I could ceretainly put more than one of these away in a sitting and will revisit this one soon"
"Drinkability: Not my favorite sweet beer but pretty damn good. I bought a couple of them to give a good review and I will gladly finish them all off"
"Grab one if you can."
"D - This is a great, highly drinkable beer. The flavors are excelent and the body is thick and rich, as it shold be. The almost surprisingly high level of carbonation really adds to the character of the beer by preventing the flavors from becoming oppressive and it especially aids the drinkability. The aroma would be the only disapointment for me as there just doesn't seem to be much there."
"Brew pours a lighter shade of black if thats possible- aromas were strong with roasted malts- big coffee presence. there is a slightly astringent roasted flavor in there, not pleasing to the palate, almost unrefined, but it still drinkable. Interesting soft bitterness in the finish with some cool hops added to round out the flavor. Not that great, this one needs some work."
"Taste is full of earthy roasted notes with coffee and chocolate notes. There is even some cacao which makes the mouthfeel a little dusty or grainy. There is probably some adjunct in here, in the form of raw barley, because there is an oily taste and mouthfeel in here. Body is sweet and a little sticky and drinkability is good."
"Pours a very dark brown with a 1 finger tan head. Held up to the light it is just shy of opaque, with a reddish tint. The aroma is toasty and coffee-like with some vanilla and woody characteristics. Taste is like coffee bitterness with a roasty finish. It's medium bodied and pretty creamy but was very carbonated, which made it difficult to enjoy right away. After the beer sat for a few minutes and warmed a little I found I enjoyed drinking it much more."
"Having very little experience in stouts, I wasn't sure what to expect. The appearance was lovely -- dark, dark, nearly jet black with a nice deep roasty, toasty aroma. Taste was not as overwhelming as I would have expected, but that was very nice -- felt like I was drinking iced coffee, but without the coffee bitterness. Flavor became even more pronouced when paired with chocolate. Nice job."
"Let's all hail Sachin Patel as the god of beer supply in Athens, GA."
"D - This is a very good stout. The chocolate sweetness is very good."
"Drinkability: These can be enjoyed by a wide variety of people. Nothing offensive.... not extreme.... just a good solid milk stout. I would have this again... mI probably won't specifically seek this out.... but I'll never turn one down..."
"Not that much different than the Young's Double Chocolate Stout I drink."
"The flavor balances the chocolate malt with black coffee and sugary lactic sweetness. A touch of pine hop in the finish. Body is somewhat watery, limp and with little carbonation. Very simple but pleasant as a session beer."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Very smooth and creamy in the mouth. Low levels of carbonation are appropriate for this beer and this beer exhibits them. The beer is very easy to drink, and I can say I'll buy it again, though I'd like to explore what other breweries have to offer in this style. I still favor Bell's Kalamazoo over this one."
"Overall one of the better milk stouts that I've had."
"I love milk stouts and would rate this one of the better bottled versions I've had. Lacking the freshness I crave from draft stouts, yet still silky smooth and imminently drinkable."
"Smooth and relatively full-bodied. An exceptional example of the style in my opinion."
"D- Extremely drinkable especially in the summer. Quite extrodanary for a stout and now that these are available in NE I will be having a few more sixers."
"Great tasting beer. My first milk stout, and it didn't disappoint."
"It's light-bodied for a stout, with good carbonation. The brew starts off like dry, dark chocolate, then moves into a creamy, still chocolatey middle, then finish on a dry-hopped, woody, slightly nutty finale. Very drinkable, pretty complex stout. Solid overall."
"Proof that Americans can make a good stout. This is a great example of an overall good stout. It has a wonderful aroma of roastiness, and a nice thick off white head that leaves terrific lacing behind. The flavor is slightly sweet at the beginning with a bit of coffee and roast flavor, and finishes with some bitterness. It has a nice full mouthfeel and leaves you with just enough flavor to take another sip for that delicious flavor. If you like any kind of stout, this one is worth going out of your way for. Little pricey, but that is usually true of all good beers."
"Poured a deep dark brown, essentially black, and pretty opaque. Large tan head faded very slowly to reveal a thick layer of lace that lasted till the bitter end. Smell was alot of chocolate to say the least. Huge lactose mile profile, but bigtime light chocolate aroma. The flvor picked right up where that left off. Very smooth, could use a tad more carbonation but really very nice. This was more of a chocolate stout, then a milk stout to me, but the sweetness is very prevelent. Low ABV makes this totally a session beer. Overall very nice and highly recommeded for a try. Really redeemed left habd for me after the smoke jumper."
"This is an excellent tasting sweet stout, if only because the flavors are so balanced. There is a nice, creamy roasted nut flavor, followed by coffee beans, and eventually sweet milk. The finish is ever so slightly bitter from a sturdy hop bill that stays in the background. The one thing that bring this beer down is the mouthfeel, which is a bit too thin and watery. I'd like a little more or a full and creamy mouth with this type of beer, and it's the one area this one is lacking in. Still, this is a very good sweet stout."
"drinkability - Enjoyed this, real nice on tap. Would buy another one"
"Thanks to bitterbill for including this one in our trade."
"Pours a very dark black with a white creamy head. The aroma is mostly bitter but, not in a bad way. The taste is more bitter than I expect from a milk stout, I was looking for a little more sweetness, still this is nicely bitter/roasted for a stout. The mouthfeel is perfect for this style, creamy, mouth coating but, not too think or cloying. This is a very nice beer, definitely worth trying but, there are better stouts out there."
"Not a bad brew to drink once in a while but nothing to write home about either. I decent change of pace brew that i'd drink when i don't feel like getting pie-eyed."
"A good example of the style. Also likely to be a decent choice for those looking to get into stouts and porters, as the milky sweetness really does a great job of mellowing the roastiness of this stout. Plenty of flavour abounds however for those acclimatized to the bitter roasted flavours of the roasted barley or malt. Certainly sessionable, and one i will look forward to trying again."
"Drinkability: Only my second beer from Left Hand, but another great one. This is a nice and full flavored stout, without having an ABV that will knock you on your rear. Glad I picked up a sixer."
"Most places that carry this would probably have Mackeson's, and that's probably the way I'd go, but this was definately an above average beer."
"Bottom line: This is just an average example of the style and though I'm glad I tried it, I wouldn't bother seeking it out again."
"This is a great brew, I highly recommend it if you can find it."
"Overall, this is a fantastic stout with a lot of potential."
"This beer poured black with a ruby hue. The head was tan colored and thick with tight bubbles  some lacing. The aroma is a bit caramel. The taste is roasted and chocolaty. The mouthfeel is on the thick side. This is a nice, smooth beer that Id consider quite drinkable"
"Poured into a pint glass, pours a amazing pitch black with a fluffy foamy creamy head that leaves some serious lace on the glass. Smell is of corn and roasted malt and barley. Taste, for some reason all left hand brews to me taste like cream corn, has that cream corn base with some hints of sweet chocolate and a bit of a coffee aftertaste. This brew goes down pretty smooth and was a bit enjoyable."
"Mouth is an chaotic combination of just short of harsh and awesome creaminess - I'd like to see what this beer is like after a few tweaks, but overall I can't complain. This beer falls short of greatness but it is quite drinkable and I'm sure I'll get it again."
"This is a great example of a milk stout. Pours an off brown/black with a tan head. Smells like cardboard, bread, and sake. Tastes like roasted coffee, and milk chocolate, but not very bitter. Has a nice balanced sweetness about it. Mouthfeel is very luxurious and pleasant. Could drink this stout all night long."
"Opinion: This beer is pretty good and has a drinkable balance. This isn't my favorite style of beer, so it is a little hard for me to be really objective. There are no flaws and the balance is not swayed too hard to the sweetness or the roast, so that is a good thing. I am not sure what circumstances would necessitate that I drink this beer again, but I would. I would take any number of beers over this one, but that is only because of style. This beer is a pretty good version of this style."
"This one is a little on the light side for me.But the flavor is very pleasant. The apperance is a pale black with a creamy off white head. The lacing cascades on the glass nicely but dissapates very quickly. The smell of maltballs and fresh milk. The taste is creamy and chocolate with a hint of coffee. The mouthfeel is amazing cotes your tongue for day's. The drinkability is less appealling for me being lactose intolerate."
"Dissapointing appearance for a stout. Poured about a half inch head that reduced to almost nothing. Small spotty traces of lacing saved it from a 2.5. The color is a solid black. Very appealing aroma with alot going on. Hints of mocha, coffee, roasted grains, sweet malts, and hops. I'm happy with the 5.2 ABV. I do not like my stouts to high in alcohol. It could use more body being that it is a bit watery. Has a nice moderate carbonation along with a spicey hop flavor. It is very drinkable and I can see myself finishing the whole six-pack. has a dry bitter lingering coffee-like finish. It is not overly sweet and has just the right amount of sweetness. The complexity of the aroma doesn't match that of the taste though. Overall a great drinkable stout worthy of a try. Thanks to the wife for picking it out."
"overall this is a very enjoyable beer that i wish i had greater access to"
"Bottle courtesy of Shp555: Poured a medium black color stout with a medium foamy head with better then average retention. Aroma of light roasted malt with some coffee. Taste is also dominated by some coffee malt with a good lactose feel also noticeable. The creamy texture was very interesting with a nice full body. I thought this beer was well balance between roasted coffee malt and the creamy lactose aspect of it."
"I'm not planning on having this again...it's not bad, but there are too many other great beers in our wonderful world to spend much time with this one."
"When I first had this I was blown away. Then in a later bottle I was disappointed. So it may vary from bottle to bottle. It's a great milk stout though. It can taste a lot like chocolate milk - sweeter and thicker than most chocolate stouts I've had. I pours out a deep brown-black with a think brownish-tan and foamy head. Some lacing. The smell is strongly of chocolate malts. The front taste is mostly of malt, but then you hit that sweet chocolate taste and it goes down nice and easy. Good stuff. It'll get you hooked on stouts."
"Taste unfortunattely falls a bit short of the mark. It has the roasted flavors but not a whole lot else. Mouthfeel is nicely creamy and not too carbonated but otherwise somewhat weak. It's not a bad beer but the aftertaste reminds me more of an American porter than a true milk stout. Could be better, could be worse, this one got my hopes up and then dashed them but you could do a lot worse and probably will."
"Mouthfeel was medium to thin with medium carbonation."
"Pours a nice clean dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tan head, some sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is kinda sweet of malts, toffee and caramel. The taste is malty and lots of toffee/caramel overtones. Medium body. Drinkable, I liked this one, very enjoyable to drink, recommended."
"One word of caution though, is that I find a huge amount of variability in this beer. This is my second six pack of the beer, and I find that different bottles, even from the same six pack taste different. The first bottle tasted great, the second was pretty bad, and the next bottle tasted pretty god again. No consistency from bottle to bottle. I remember last years vintage of this being pretty terrible, but overall this year is pretty good. It's a decent buy at only $7.29 a six pack, but don't expect every bottle to be stellar. For this reason, my scores dropped a bit."
"MMMmouthfeel...thick and heavy and real smooth. It had little bursts of carbonation and it flowed nicely to back of the throat. The first taste was real soft with roasted malts, coffee, and caramel. It fades real nice and becomes almost sweet with toffee, chocolate, and burnt toast. Give it up for Colorado brewers and Left Hand for this creation."
"D: This is actualy a fairly easy brew to drink, I think it is a beer for people who want something different. This beer is a change of pace for those who want some thing dark with not alot of bitterness, and not really heavy. I could drink a few of these once in awhile, but not my favorite."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into my pint glass. Appears a dark brownish black with two fingers of cream, fluffy caramel colored head. Smells of malted milk balls, vanilla, and cocoa. Tastes of bittersweet chocolate, roasted malts, coffee, and roasted nuts. Very smooth and creamy in the mouth. This stout drinks very easy. I'm glad I have access to this whenever a craving comes around. Recommended."
"Drinkability- Nearly a sessionable stout, minus the sweetness from the style."
"Highly recommended."
"DA: I really dig this style, easy to drink and nutricious!"
"Highly recommended."
"D-too sweet for me. No more than one."
"This one could be a nice dessert beer and is quite enjoyable overall."
"Cheers!!!!"
"Drinkability: goes down nice, could do two in a night"
"Finishes sweet with the slightest hint of dryness.\Very middle of the road beer, Very enjoyable but nothing exciting."
"Poured a nice dark black with a thick tan colored head that stuck around and left tracings on the glass. The carbonation and mouth feel were good. The first aroma is of coffee, and this flavor is the first flavor you taste. The flavors are of coffee, a hint of chocolate, and a bit of smoke. The lactose-sugar is not obvious as a taste but there is an overall sweetness."
"Overall a very nice and highly sessionable milk stout. I believe this to be an under represented style among craft brewers."
"Tasty, particularly a it warms."
"The flavors are presented in a well arranged fashion and meld together nicely. This is a solid Milk Stout."
"This is an easy stout to consume. Flavorful and light with a great long-lasting aftertaste."
"Overall this to me is a very drinkable brew, with some large and subtle flavors. It is not overwhelming, yet has a strong milk chocolate feel, almost milkshake like. Cheers to this one"
"I am unimpressed with this Milk Stout  the flavors are not bold enough and dont live up to the style standards. This brew is not bad, it just is not great. Not what Id call Udderly delightful."
"more casually. Very drinkable."
"I served this from a 12oz bottle that was bottled 2.5 months prior to drinking according to the label. It pours very dark but not black like some other stouts. I poured from a bit above the bottle and got a thick tan head about 1.25 inches thick that went away in less than a minute. The beer was a little too cold, but there was a slight roasted aroma. There is a prominent lactose flavor that I remember from a Cream Stout I brewed once. That quickly fades into a roasted flavor. The sweetness of the lactose is a tad much for me, but it is enjoyable none the less. The mouthfeel is interesting...it is initially very full but quickly fades to a much thinner feel. I like this beer and would drink it again if it was around, but probably wouldn't seek it out."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with a brewed on date on front label. Color was black with a tannish head that settled into a thin head and lacing. Smell was a little off on this sample compared to prior tastings but it usually heavy on coffee, roasted malt and some sweetness. Solid mouthfeel that was a little creamy. Really enjoyed the taste on this one. It might not be as strong as some other milk stouts but that's fine by me. This one hits the spot. Another excellent Left Hand beer that will find a home in my regular rotation. Highly recommend. (4, RR, T,Y)"
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poured a dark black, with a 1/4 inch head, that left a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is strong coffee, with a hint of chocolate. The mouthfeel is thick, IMO what a stout should be. The taste is roasted coffee, with a light milk chocolate aftertaste. For a stout, I could easily drink a sixer (which I have before). A very nice offering from Left Hand. Everything a milk stout should be. Not the cheapest, but definitely worth a try, if not a session."
"I had high hopes for this beer. Poured a dark brown with a slight amber hue, not pitch black like some other stouts that I really enjoy. The light brown head made a brief appearance, but quickly subsided, leaving not a trace of sticky goodness on the glass. This beer is not very complex; it's sweet alright, but somewhat thin and watery, and not very aromatic. I don't think I'll pick this one up again."
"Served slightly chilled in a pint glass. Poured a deep oily black with very little tanish brown head. Very little lace was left on the glass. Upon closer inspection the beer was actually a redish brown color. Smelled of smoke, molasses, and maybe a touch of chocolate. Sweet , sugary , molasses taste upfront , with a bitter roasted coffee finish, with small bursts of alcohol. Had a thick chewy feel in the mouth, which was nice. Was pretty drinkable. I have to give this one another shot."
"Dark chocolate bitterness reigns over the palate, accented by a bit of sweetness from what I assume is lactose. My lips are sticky. This stout is rather good, in my opinion. I feel like I could have it with cookies or brownies. It's the kind of beer I could easily go through three or four of."
"Not at all bad, but not as good as Mackeson's Triple XXX Stout."
"Drinkability: With the strong coffee flavors, this is more of a porter. Heavy stuff -- probably couldn't have more than one in a sitting."
"Drinkability: Highly enjoyable drinking experience...not quite as big or tasty as Mackesons but this harkens back to the old Watney's Cream Stout I loved so much about 10 years ago but haven't seen in the US in many years...."
"Had this on tap last evening. It poured to a dark brown, almost black color with a fair sized head that left good lacing. The aroma was of chocolate and roasted malts, not a bad smelling brew but I feel that there are better options. The taste was very similar to the aroma as it had a chocolate and burn/roasted malt flavor left a slight chard aftertaste. Also was able to pick up some coffee undertones as well. Over all this is a pretty good tasting brew, feel that I have others that I would look for before I got this again."
"A very nice after dinner beer, but the sweetness could prevent me from drinking more than one."
"enjoyable beer, nothing really to distinguish it from other american milk stouts out there."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass this beer was dark, nearly black. It had a brown-tanish head that disappeared quickly leaving a nice lace that sticks around. It smells of burnt malt and a little coffee. The taste is of chocolate and some mocha that gets better with every sip. This beer fills the mouth without being too heavy. Overall, enjoyable, but their are better milk stouts out there."
"An overall good beer, but a little light on flavor and aroma. Give it a try."
"I have to admit to being a Left Hand fanboy but I really enjoy this brew and highly reccomend it"
"Medium body and overall a fairly easy drinker. This beer got better about half way through the bottle. I found myself wanting more, but only had one bottle."
"I'd only have a few, although inebriation might cloud one's senses and overlook the sweetness. Just a tad too rich for me."
"this is a milk stout that could be enjoyed all night. the color is opugue black with a tan frothy head that disappeared very fast it has a light carbonation. the roasty coffee flavor with a nice rich creaminess is definately very enjoyalbe i will be drinking this beer for a long time ."
"Bottle dated 04 05 06, drank on 09 14 06. Poured a opaque black, looked great. Little bit of chocolate brown frothy foam that quickly disappeared. No bubbles during drinking. Smelt of a slighty burnt dark chocolate. Tasted solid, like the same dark chocolate, Nice and thick, it felt like it was coating the inside of my mouth. Left a little aftertaste, maybe like coffee?? It was sublte and hard to tell. Very easy to sip, no problems at all."
"Roasty coffee flavors lightly sweet. The sweetness and lactose reveals itself slowly as it warms. Gets creamier and a lingering roasty bitterness in the aftertaste. Tasty stuff. I love cream/milk stouts and this one delivers what I'm looking for, a nice roasty/creamy balance."
"Another pretty good beer from Left Hand, but nothing amazing."
"Pours dark brown, almost black with reddish highlights. Off white head forms well, then falls into the beer as quickly as it appeared. The lack of head retention is really the only negative thing to say about this beer. The aroma is a great mix of sweetness, fruit and roasted malts. In the flavor, the roastiness is more prominant, but the sweetness and fruits are present and obvious. The thick mouthfeel (thank you lactose) is matched with light to moderate carbonation. If not for the ridiculous amount of calories in these, I could drink them all night. This is the best milk stout I've had to date..."
"I had trepidation about this one due to previous bad experiences with the lactose stouts, but I enjoyed this much more than my previous samplings of a Mackeson's stout. A: Black as pot of 3 day old truckstop coffee with a moderate tan head with resilient lacing S: The malts are subtle with the sugars being very profound on the nose. T: The lactose was much more subdued than the aroma would suggest, obviously sweet but not too sweet. M: Thick sweet chocolate feel, very viscous D: This is a drinkable milk stout but not a really sessionable for me anyway. I enjoyed it and will order it again."
"Drinkability: I would love to see this on tap. I'd quaff it all night!"
"D- For a stout, it is very approachable. Not real heavy and overbearing on the roasty bits. Could be a session beer for some. Very nice and shouldn't be missed."
"D- so tasty, this is my new favorite dessert(not dessert beer, just dessert in general). sessionable as well. do try this one."
"Milky smooth, chewy sweetness. Full roasted coffee comes and finishes it off. I didn't see anything overly great about the beer, but the thre that came in the mixer somehow just disappeared quickly. Milk stouts are definitely superior to imperials on hot summer days."
"Poured into my Sam Smith tulip, the ale is virtually an opaque black, with slight ruby brown highlishgts at the bottom, where the glass is the most narrow. It forms a beautiful 1 finger head that fizzes out quickly, unfortunately, but still leaves slick foamy lacing on the glass's sides. Taking a huge whiff, I inhale a thin, but creamy-sweet roatiness. This smell is the high point of the beer. Upfront, the taste is bittersweet coffee, which moves quickly to a milky sweetness, ending in a very roasty bitterness. The mouthfeel is smooth and thick, with a pleasant tingle of carbonation. I feel that a bit more thickness is in order, though. As for drinkability, it's quite enjoyable, but leaves me feeling very filled, so that one is all I'm fit for."
"Poured to a drak brown with hints of red, thin tan head and some lacing. Aroma was strongly malt, chocolate and toffee, with coffee smell becoming more evident at mid-glass. Flavor pretty much follwed these same lines, and the finish was primarily the same as I get after finishing my morning coffee."
"This beer is much less sweet than I anticipated. I have only had one other milk stout before (Snow plow) and I disliked it immensly. It was far too sweet. This one has a little better balance and would make a decent dessert beer or nightcap."
"This is a great beer. I only drank it out of the bottle so I cannot attest to the head or much about the color. I loved the taste. It was very creamy and milky. It has actual lactose in it so it is quite authentic and raw with milk flavor. It has a distinct coffee flavor. It is a great desert beer. It is the beer version of a milk shake."
"overall, not an outstanding milk stout, but falls short of my expectations."
"This beers pours black with a tan to light brown head thaty floats in my glass leaving nice sticky lacing. The smell of this beer is sweet roast,slight coffee, and maybe some brown sugar? Tastes mostly of the sweet roasted malt and coffee, followed by a light bitterness that coats the mouth to a great extent. The moputhfeel is almost drying to a point, but this does not hinder the flavor of the beer. While pretty one dimentional this beer's creamy texture is easy drinkable, especially as it warms. The alchol content is unhindering which makes drinking more than one of these easy. A good representation of this style that i am loving more and more."
"As a note, the taste almost seems to improve even more as the beer warms to room temperature, perhaps I will try it next time not chilled..."
" I definately could drink a few of these (and I have)"
"Really great after-dinner beer. Like I said above, dessert in a glass."
"Pours a black clear body leaving a thick creamy head. The aroma is light, sweet, malted milk, and caramel. The taste is very fresh feeling, it starts syrupy sweet so nice and smooth followed by a milk sweetness with a coffee chocolate essence to round it out. It is balanced by a nice spicy hop effort that really compliments this sweet stout. The beer finishes again milky sweet, this is a session quality stout. I will be drinking this all year around."
"This beer is quite a treat. Good on tap, but even better in the bottle."
"Pours black with slight browning around edges when held up to light. Raw chocolate and coffee aroma. Feels like a gulp of skim milk and tastes full of roasted coffee and creamy chocolate. Still light enough with a bitter, burnt finish. Very easy to drink and I can't wait to have another!"
"This is the smoothest stout that I have tried to date. Strong chocolate aroma and taste. Slightly sweet but not pungent. As dark as 100,000 mile diesel crankcase oil. Do not confuse with Irish stouts. This is smoother, sweeter, and full of complex layers of flavors. Worth a try if you like the dark beers."
"Overall Impression: This is Defiantly a """Session Beer""" (can drink more than one in a single sitting) if you can believe that. I Thought it was a Great Stout. Defiantly Crafted for Those who Turn Their Heads at Dark Beers. Smooth Easy Drinking """Session Beer.""""
"This beer is worth a try if you like this style."
"Poured a dark black with a nice head, more like nice knowin ya. Head dissipated quickly and left little lacing. Smelled chocolatey with some earthy tones. I've noticed this with other Left Hand beers (the porter and the imperial stout). The taste was ok. It seemed like someone poured a packet of porter mix into my milk. This seems ok in theory, but the end result was bitter sweet (I wish). The sweetness of this beer really lowered the drinkability for me, but the thin mouthfeel evened things out.. for better or for worse. I love all ba's."
"Not spot on for style, it's more like a decent porter than anything else. Still pretty tasty."
"Deep brown color that appears black in the glass until closer inspection. Aroma is fairly rich, full of roasted chicory, cocoa, sugar covered raisins along with a slight hint of hops. Flavor is full of milk sugar and malt and its attributes, providing a creamy, sweetened blend of enjoyable flavors, such as cocoa, coffee and raisins. Somewhat overly bitter on the finish, but still an impressive brew."
"Left Hand Milk Stout pours an almost black with ruby highlights, with a tan head. Aroma is fairly satisfying roasted malts/coffee smells evident. Lots of coffee flavor. Creamy milk stout mouthfeel is present. Pretty good, I think it is definitely worth a try."
"Bomaber aged in my cellar several months...no freshness markings. Pours a two finger large bubbled head that settled quickly to a sickly ring around the inside of the glass. I'm concerned this beer may be overcarbonated. Pitch liquid is actually just a very very dark brown when held to light. Crystal clear. Smells dark chocolate with coffee roast underneath. An oatmeal-like smooth cool to the sweet. A touch of molasses. Tastes chocolatey, roasty, sour dark malts, smooth milky sweetness, and a caramel that's light yet persistent becoming the predominant aftertaste. Yummy. Hop bitter is either low or hidden beneath sting from the too-much carbonation. Swirl to release carb reforms one finger of head that quickly settles. Taste is now a bit more empty than previously, but hop flavor stand up to be noticed. Md-thick body and over-carbonated."
"Very dark brown in colour with medium carbonation. Nice aromas of roasted malt, nuts, and a bit of chocolate. The roasted malt flavors are balanced out by some thick lactic character. Minor notes of coffee and caramel are also present. Not a mind blowing beer, and although it doesnt realy take any chances it is very well balanced and fits perfectly within the traditional confines of the style."
"tasted very akin to the blackjack porter, actually"
"D - highly drinkable, this could get one in trouble"
"The mouthfeel is really wonderful it is creamy and has a nice oomph, but manages to escape opressive weight."
"Wow. Nearly a perfect Milk Stout. I'd love to have this on tap. Pours out to a porter-like brownish black, with little head. Very low carbonation. Could use a step up in both depts. Smell is great; lots of malt and chocolate, with roasted coffee bean and mild hops. Taste - Exceptional. Hands down, top 5 best tasting stouts i've ever had. Flavors of chocolatey malts, grain, sweet molasses, mild creamy coffee, sweet wood elements. Wow. Excellent. Mouthfeel was good; i'd be happier if it were a bit thicker and had more of a chewy texture to it. Drinkability? Amazing. I'd have this day in and day out. So close to being the benchmark for stouts, it's nearly got me in tears. So close... Highly Recommended. Thanks to grynder33 for the sample."
"Verdict- Easy to drink and somewhat tasty, but not quite as bulky as I prefer. Instead of being creamy in a good way, it tasted like some of the usual stout flavors are washed out. Good, but not something I'm likely to buy again."
"Not bad. Poured alot lighter in colour than I was expecting it would. I was thinking it would be ink - black, but got something more akin to slightly watered down Coca-Cola. Head was decent. Overall for the style, it looked pretty good. The smell was very inviting!! Very sweet with lots of lactose and roasted malts and chocolate. The taste was incredible. Is this a beer or a Yoohoo chocolate milk?! The only downside to this, was that I feel it is way, way too light for the style concerning mouthfeel. If there was such a thing as MacKeson XXX Light, this would be it. Everything else was fantastic, but this light of a body in a milk stout is a """no-go""". Because of the richness in chocolatey taste, however, I could see this being an occasional purchase."
"Overall, not a bad beer, but I much prefer Sam Adams cream stout. This beer might be a good choice, as others have mentioned, to give to your friends to introduce them to stouts."
"D: Meh. It's smooth and easy to drink, but not impressive. Perhaps a good starter stout for novices."
"Very enjoyable beer. Would like to do this one again."
"The drinkability of this one will suffer for the same reason Mackeson does, that is, because it's so stout. You could probly drink one more Left Hand than you could Mackeson, but I wouldn't try more than three, maybe four in an evening. Not a session beer, but a rewarding experience for those who want to taste something you won't find everyday."
"Cheers Left Hand!"

"cheers..."
"This is only the second milk stout I have tried, but I would say I would definitely be willing to buy this beer again in the future."
"A good, drinkable stout, and we're always salivating at the prospect of getting more variety in this state. But it doesn't seem to me like this really hits the style spot on. If you hadn't told me it was supposed to be a milk stout, i think i would have rated it higher."
"Overall, I loved it! I've never had a beer that I could sit a glass of chocolate milk next too and after tasting have a hard time figuring out which one IS the actual chocolate milk. Some will shy away due to the sweetness, but I really liked it!"
"drinkability: very drinkable"
"I'm puzzled with this beer. It's neat cause it's different. I'll say that, but I mean this guy totally didn't know what he was talking about I think course we live in a minimal good brew area for the most part until recent two months. I must say though if you like coffee you would probably like this. I'm not sure but my guess is that since it tastes like coffee quite a bit more than most coffee hinted brews and this guy who is a barista loved the hell outta it - i'd say it would probably work. I'm going to say I'm not buying it again cause I'm not paying 10 bucks for something this OK. I'm sure it's someone else's thing though."
"Drinkability: Nice and easy to drink; enjoyable"
"A very nice milk stout. Something i would reccomend with dessert. This would be great with a nice piece of chocolate cake, or black forest cake."
"I had seen this beer sitting on the shelf at my local store and finally decided to give it a whirl. Poured nearly black with some ruby hues showing up when holding it up to the light. Head retention was about average, with a medium to light white head that faded quickly. Smells I picked up were sweet cream, milk chocolate, and mild coffee. There was also a bit of a burnt character to the smell. Taste was very much like drinking an ice coffee, with the chocolate accent pulling through towards the end of each sip. Mouthfeel was light to medium bodied. Although this was a very drinkable brew, I dont think I could handle more then one or two at a time, the sweet character of this beer became a bit too much. If you are a fan of the milk stout style, this is a must try. If not, still worth a try. Cheers"
" I like a milk stout because it's easier to adjust to for the novice beer drinker. The 5.20% is not as strong as some of the stouts I've enjoyed recently, and it has the warming and soothing power of a morning or post-dinner coffee. Not a lot of burnt notes or creamy thickness here, but the mouthfeel is still wonderful between the way the beer foams up and the slight roasting that lingers on and on. Between the freshness date on the bottle, the balance, and the taste from start to finish. I really enjoyed this brew and it was certainly worth the shot I took on it!"
"D - Great drinkability. I will drink more of this."
"Pours a dark brown with a hint of red, half finger head diminished quickly to an off-white ring of lacing. Smells sweetly of cream adn coffee and a natural nutty flavor with a hint of chocolate. Light yet smooth and creamy mouthfeel , starting sweet and finishing with a slightly bitter aftertaste like a weaker coffee. This is my first stout, and I enjoyed this beer."
"Beer appears to be super black from afar but put it to the light and you are able to detect a red hue . This was a good size head that gave a coffee like smell. RIght off the bat I am thinking this is a smoked porter then the taste leans toward a stout. Overall, a great beer and I am upset I only bought the single."
"The sweetness and overall 'lightness' make this an easy drinking stout. Not bad as far as milk stouts go."
"Dark chocolate caramel with oats taste. Definitely some mild black coffee in there too. Deep brown red in color with suspended sediment, vanishing head, spotty lacing. Thin, nutty milk chocolate malt aroma and sweetened condensed milk. Faint coffee, smells right, could go with a chocolate doughnut. Near medium body, leaves some burnt chocolate malt on the palate, tapers off slowly. Carbonation works just right shaking out the flavors here. Exceeded expectations, didn't look especially bright. After finishing this one I wish I had another, a lot of good smells and tastes built in, not exceptional, but a sixer of this is money well-spent."
"Notes: This was my first milk stout and it has inspired me to seek out more of the style. Please give this and other milk stouts like this a try. (Mackeson xxx is great too!)"
"Kind of too rich to be particularly drinkable but fine enough for a pint or two. If I saw it again and was in the mood for a very sweet and heavy stout I would not refrain from ordering a pint."
"This is an exemplary milk stout from Left Hand with a good body and flavor profile. Generally, this may be (IMO) the best beer that Left Hand makes. Good thing those bombers are cheap!"
"12 ounce bottle. Left Hand's Milk Stout pours out a very dark brown color with little head. The aroma is roasted malt and oatmeal. Sweet malty flavor with lots of cocoa and roasted coffee. Thankfully, it never gets too sweet. Lightly hopped finish. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Never sour or astringent. Enough carbonation to help the sweetness from being cloying. Pretty good drinkability. I really enjoyed the smooth creamy flavor in this beer."
"Over all drinkability is pretty above average, but nothing amazing. I can think of lots of other beers I would rather have. If you haven't tried it, its probably worth a try."
"-Cheers2Beers"
"A lovely dark brown color with a slight tan head that leaves behind minimal lacing. Aromas of roasted malt, caramelized sugar, butter, and condensed milk. The taste is a bit unusual for this style; in a bad way. The sweetness of the beer is apparent upfront with a very dry, bready aftertaste that can best be described as 'chalk-like'. The hop profile for this beer doesn't not compliment the malt character causing the beer to be less sweet than it can be. Distinct tartiness in the aftertaste reduces this beers drinkability and overall enjoyment."
"I really liked this beer. It would be a good beer to wean someone off of Guinness Draught with. I have to give this one a hearty recommendation."
"M&D. Sweet, extract-like. Coating my mouth with a film of sugar with each sip. Not my pint of beer."
"Pours a very dark ruby color with a short tan head that fades into a heavy lace. Chocolate dominates the nose with notes of freshly roasted coffee beans in the background. Taste begins with sweet malt that is nicely balanced with some bittersweet chocolate. A touch of spicy hops is present in the finish. Texture is smooth and silky. This is an easy-drinking sweet stout."
"When I got this beer, I was told by the shop clerk that it would be the best milk stout I have ever tasted. I will have to disagree, but it should not be avoided either."
"I really love this beer. It is gone, and I want another, and I'm not even done typing. I didn't mean to guzzle it, I usually spend an hour per glass. It was just too good! RECOMMENDED!"
"This is a fairly dark beer with little head. It has kind of a soured milk taste that I do not find very appealing. It smells a little more sour than most other stouts I have tried. The mouthfeel and drinkability are both affected by this soured taste. A couple of my freinds tried this beer and liked it so it may just be that I don't like a milk stout. I may try this one again in the future but I am in no hurry to do so."
"The color is a deep, dark brown, with, unfortunately, almost no head whatsoever. The aroma is of sweet, dark malts with notes of cocoa and roastiness. The taste consists of a richly sweet malt flavor with notes of coffee, roast, and chocolate. This is bursting with sweetness from the added sugars and oats. This is another great beer from Left Hand, drinkability only suffers from the fact that this beer can seem like a meal in a bottle."
"Few beers balance the roast as well as what's found in this traditionally brewed milk stout. It sure stands up to its name and style-sake."
"Will definately seek this one out to drink again. Nice balance of typical stout kick and sweetness."
"This one pours black/ruby, with a real short latte colored head that gave up on me after about a minute. Smells weak, fainly of fruit, rasins maybe, and a slight chocolate/alcohol combo. The taste is slighly dry, with a noticable dark fruit flavor (rasin/ fig/ plum) and sweetness, and a weak milk chocolate finish with a touch of sour/tart. Feels a bit fizzy and thin for a stout, but not overly carbonated, and minor creamy finish. This beer isn't bad, but it just doesn't grab me. I can drink it, it's just not special."
"Medium body feels thicker due to pinpoint bubbles and slick, creamy texture."
"ng"
"Drinkability: When I want a good stout, one that will be drinkable, this one falls into the average category, but for a stout, that's excellent. I'd buy this over other stouts because of the creaminess."
"This is a well-balanced stout overall; not too sweet. The lactose sugar is evident, but blends well with the roasty malt profile. Very drinkable. Good head retention and lacing. Aroma is mix of roasted barley and lactose sugar. Nice work by a solid brewery."
"Dark dark brown with a slight off-white head. Aroma is a bit too roasted for the style, though there are pleasant notes of dark chocolate. Sweet cocoa malt is the first noticible taste, with a lighter roastiness than the nose implies, but sufficient for some balance. Hop presence is low. A faint plum-like fruitiness detectable in the finish, with some lingering sweetness. Soft, creamy texture and moderate to light body. Decent example of the style."
"Body is very light for a stout, light easily penetrates the beer, even in a wide glass. Head is almost not very large, just a few wisps on top of the glass. Smell is sweet and chocolatey, nice java presence. Taste is a little drier than I would have expected. Still has a nice chocolate and hops presence to it, could use a lot more body, as this beer is fairly thin. Better than average, but not mind bogglingly delicious or anything."
"I find this to be quite drinkable, due to the overall lack of """negative""" qualities that would keep me away from the beer. At worst, this is an """eh""" beer, perhaps a bit more bland than I was expecting, but fairly decent nonetheless. Worth a try if you like Milk Stouts, and perhaps an easy entry into normal stouts for people who don't like bitterness, but a Mackeson XXX or Rogue Chocolate Stout would be more likely to hit my palate than this one."
"I have found myself going back to the fridge and grabbing one after another of the milk stout. It really grew on me and whatever the reason is I like drinking this on occasion."
"Drinkability - simple but delicious, about as close to a session milk stout as it gets."
"Pours a dark nearly opaque brown with some ruddy highlights. Head rose and fell in seconds, small ring left, no lacing. Nose is coffee, aged milk (not quite sour, but not fresh), and some toasty malt notes. Taste is toasted cream, malt cereal with a dollop of condensed milk. Smoooth. Refreshing. Creamy mouthfeel, seems like it could be fuller. Oh so easy to drink. Thank God this is a relatively low ABV. Pairs well with Chewy Chips Ahoy."
"I could handle a couple of these no prob. Drinkability is slippery and then some. A pretty darn nice Milk Stout in my book."
"Pours a clear dark reddish-brown, small light tan head that doesn't last long, not much lacing either, aroma of dark chocolate and coffee. Medium bodied with a somewhat watery mouthfeel. Smokey coffee and chocolate flavors, finishes a bit sweet, a pretty drinkable stout."
"This one is definitely a sipping beer, and im definitely going to have to try this one when my palate matures a little."
"(22 oz.)"
"Beer head was quite lacking. Color is nice and dark, ruby red through a light. The aroma was nice, not real strong but some definite coffee grounds & a little maltiness. THe flavor is definitely sweet but not to the extreme like a Mackeson's or at least the way I remember a Mackeson's. You get a little blend of hoppy bitterness and some roasted malt at the end as well to balance the sweetness. I tend to think of milk stouts as being a little one-dimensional in some ways, since their sweetness is often not as complex or deep as, say, a malty bock. This one is kind of in the lines of that stereotype, but its good for its style and a pleasant drink for sure."
"Yeah, I really don't feel like knocking it, but true stout aficianados won't miss anything if they pass this by."
"Tried this as a part of a Flying Saucer flight. Since this was my last one of the five, it had a perfect serving temperature. Not ink black, but close. Hints of chocolate, hops, caramel . . . not too sure about the milk/sweetness. A bit more difficult to finish. Dances on the tongue. One of my more enjoyable stouts."
"Nice to see Left Hand back in the Twin Cities, its been a while. Dark and clear, not quite opaque black that lets ruby highlights through at the bottom. Head is a deep tan color, of two primary bubble sizes but ends up flat and thin after half a minute. Laces in incomplete loops and dots. Malty aroma, chocolate milk and a little cherry. Smooth mouthfeel with lower carbonation. Starts like sweet milk chocolate, nothing else much to distract the flavor profile. The beer finishes with a more granular texture, darker in tone, more mousse-like -- a bit sandy in the back of the throat. Meets the style well, drinkable and simple in impression, an easy-going Sweet Stout here."
"This stout poure a very dark brown, almost black, color with some red near the edges with tan foam that settled. The smell was malty but very light. The taste was malty with a light sweetness, some cocoa flavor, and a touch of yeast. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with medium-full body and good carbonation. This was a very """porter-like""" stout to me, but it was enjoyable nonetheless."
"Tasting: It lived up to its style as a """sweet stout.""" It tasted rather chocolate-y, but a little bit less so than other beers of the same style that I have tasted. There was even a little bitterness to this beer - not much, but it was there. For a stout it was medium-bodied. This beer was pretty drinkable, though it's not quite as good as other sweet stouts."
"Those blackened malts rough up the palate, then smooth it out with minerally ash and lighter roasted barley flour. With a dropper squeeze a few drops of black cherry juice in grain alcohol on your tongue. This manages to be smooth, not exactly creamy, more like 2% milk."
"Medium-medium light body."
"Pours with a thick, black body, with a nice foamy near-white head that lingered a while. Aroma is very toasted malt, with some nice coffee and chocolate overtones. Taste is similar, with a bit of the bitter bite of toasted malt, again with some nice mocha-ish notes. Very smooth and sweet, although it seems a bit thin, it could use a bit more body. Rather enjoyable, and one of the better bottled stouts I've had."
"The mouthfeel is like a dream. Silky smooth, creamy, sudsy stuff. It definitely goes down nicely."
":-)"
"This beer poured a dark brown color with lots of ruby hues around the edges. Not quite dark enough for a stout for me. The one finger of head that sticks around. The nose is a nice chocolate nd creamy, just not enough of the creamy for my liking. The flavor was a nice creamy milk chocolate. There is not as much of the creamy marshmellow that I have had in others of this style, but its nice. The feel was thick and creamy and smooth. Overall a nice beer. Not as good as their porter, but a nice beer all around."
"Finish isn't as long as expected, and the body is a little thin for a stout. Worth a try, maybe even a good everyday stout in winter months if you're not in the mood for a strong ale."
"Appearance: Pours a dark ruby brown tone with a decent sized quickly dwindling tan head leaves some uneven streaks of lacing. Aroma: A definite nose of dark chocolate cocoa powder with some lactic acid notes with the musty tartness not overbearing at all actually melds into the overall aroma nicely. Chocolate chip cookie dough like in nature with mellow herbal low hop profile. Taste: Like drinking a cold glass of chocolate flavored milk in some regards the creaminess hits the tastes buds in an unoffensive and relatively pleasant manner. Not overly sweet balanced with a the grace of hops and darker malts, definitely a decent brew from Left Hand. Mouthfeel: Creamy texture coats the palate carbonation is just a tad abrasive with each swallow, not bad just could be a bit smoother. Drinkability: One brew that was better then I was assuming I wouldn't like based on prior experiences with Cream Stouts, not bad yet not amazing."
"This came in a 22oz bomber. Pours out a slightly translucent black with about an inch of tan fluffy foam. The head sticks around for a bit but leaves no lacing. Aroma is of chocolate and creaminess but is overall pretty weak. Taste starts off with a bit off coffee and a sweet cream with a backing of dark chocolate. Aftertaste is roasted coffee. Not quite as rich as a few other Milk Stouts Ive had this is still tasty. Body is medium with average feel to it for the style. Pretty good drinkability, its tasty but not as much so as others. Solid example of the style that is easy drinking but not one that will wow you."
"A very dark brown/black with mahogony highlights when held up to the light. Has a nice frothy light brown head. A most definite chocolate aroma with some coffee in the background. The flavor is again chocolate (more of a milk chocolate than a bittersweet chocolate) at the start with a sharp coffee like finish."
"Overall, seems much more like a porter than a stout, but who am i to judge. Could have been much more rich and creamy...but as is, it was fairly """meh"""."
"Overall not bad. Good to try once in a while, but nothing to go crazy about."
"Pours pitch black. Small tanish head forms after a hard pour but quickly disappears. The smell is full of dark roasted malts, chocolate, and an indication of sweetness. Very light carbonation, strong sweetness from the lactose, dark, roasty, chocolately, a tiny bit of coffee. I thought the body was a bit thin, but it finishes with a nice gentle bitterness through out the entire palate with a sweet creaminess. Definitely a good beer, but it's no Mackeson's XXX."
"A nice little sixer picked up by one of my housemates. Pours a light black color with some loose cafe au lait head that was mostly bubbles. The nose was a tad indistinct. It definitely had some warm, sweet flavors of caramel and malts, but there was not any overpowering or unique smells. The taste was very tasty. Sweet maltyness with the caramel morphing into a more toffee like flavor, but the flavor is very sweet as a milk stout should be. The finish had a more grainy dry stout like flavor, which was good. Mouthfeel was smooth, but just carbonated enough. Good quality beer."
"I was glad I tried this one. Definitely recommended."
"Flavor and body is thick and continues this milk chocolate feel with a healthy dose of body and ovaltine like flavors."
"not a bad looking stout by any means, but a tad thin looking, in terms of body and head. whilst near black, the body doesn't have the girth that you'd expect from a typical stout, and the head is a bit too bubby instead of creamy. the scent is quite nice, if a bit subtle. you really have to dig deep to pick up the aromas at times, which include a nice roasted/burnt malt scent along with some chocolate, oatmeal and a touch of coffee. well done. i found a nice balance in the flavour, between the roasted earthiness of the malt and the sweet chocolate milk flavour which subtly sneaks in toward the finish but is quickly dashed away by some more roasted flavour. this is a silky, smooth and creamy treat that, in my opinion, seems to be a bit underrated by most. definitely worth a try, and then some."
"Overall a disappointment. Been a long time since I've had a Left Hand product, and never this one. Was surprised to see it (and yes, it's fresh). I'll finish the sixer, but won't be rushing for another."
"A decent beverage, a transition from a soda pop, or an ovaltine. Looks like coke with a snap crackle from active carbonation. Roasty medium mouthfeel coffee cocoa nutty bittersweet chocolate. Very dark brown with tan head. Roasted malt aroma. Not too smooth, but easy drink. Where are the cookies?"
"Dark ruby in color with a very slight, finely bubbled dark tan head. Aroma is bittersweet (though more sweet than bitter) chocolate, underlaid by a nice, roasty malt. Flavor starts off with a smooth, sweet milk chocolate, and develops into a finish which is moderately bitter, with a nice compliment between the hops and roasted grains. Body throughout is smooth, fairly creamy. A nice beer, though hardly a surprising one."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4""" light tan head above a dark mahogany brew. Head didn't last very long, but laced okay. Aroma is strongly of coffee, but tries (not so well) to balance, but doesn't quite get the job done. Taste is also initally coffee, but attempts to offset with sweetness which doesn't quite compensate. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both good."
"Final Thought: It's another quality brew by a quality brewery, nothing fancy, but not upper echelon..."
"The mouthfeel was creamy and smooth at the start with a short smooth chocolate finish. Nicely drinkable, but slightly sweeter and less roasted than other milk stouts. Overall an enjoyable brew."
"12 ounce bottle, pours black, with no light shining thru, some ruby highlights. Nice roasty nose. Minimal head and same with lacing. Medium bodied, low carbonation. Smooth mouthfeel, soft and coating. Roasted malts present, also a subtle sweetness to this tasty, light and refreshing stout. Nice on a summers eve. Pleasant and worthwhile sweet stout."
"Had this beer at a beer tasting, and then again from my fridge. It poured a dark almost black, with a good size foam, almost crema like. Stayed for most of the beer. Smelled very chocolate-milk like. Tasted like sweet, chocolate milk. Was served at the tasting with a vanilla ice cream dessert. Man did it pair up well! Mouthfeel was a smooth thick flavor. Drinkability was filling, so I could only have 1 or 2. Considering how sweet it is, it definetly is a dessert beer that I'll have again!"
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, considering it's a stout. Very enjoyable. I'd be more than happy to have another, but would not go out of my way to buy more."
"Being a lefty, you got to like the name of the brewery. That said, the beer pours with a nice head, 1""" which fades fairly quick, nice belgian lace throughout the glass. nice dark brown/reddish color, nice, not overpowering, roast/black patent aroma. flavor thin on tongue but nice flavor on the back of throat. This beer is sweet which is probably the flavor profile for all milk stouts. If sweetness is not cloying, this beer is pretty drinkable."
"From the bottle pours a deep, dark brown liquid with ruby highlights. Nice off-white foamy head that stayed for a while. There was a good amount of lace on the glass at the end. Smells slightly fruity, and roasted. Almost smells like banana. Up front, this beer has a nice roasty malt flavor, then you are hit with sweetness. Slight coffee flavor as well. Nice amount of hops, but not overwhelming. Finish is dry. This seemed full-bodied, with a moderate amount of carbonation. Overall, nice balance between the roasted malt, and the sweetness. I would have this one again."
"The beer pours a deep black color with a thin tan head that fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a nice black patent scent, but not much else. It has a rather dry aroma. The taste is above average. It has a rich black malt flavor with a dry, yet slightly sweet finish. It is very dark and hides the lactose addition. It's not as sweet as other milk stouts I've had. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with a little lacking in carbonation. This is a decent stout, but nothing more. It has a one sided flavor and aroma and is undercarbonated. It's one and done for me."
"Pours with a two-finger light brown head that fades to a ring and leaves a good lace. Virtually black color. Good carbonation. Nose is coffe/caramel. Strong coffee flavor, nice beefy stout but not as dry as a Guinness. $2.30 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA."
"dark dark brown, but not quite black as you might expect from a stout. Very thin head that disapates quickly. In the first whiff you can the smell of the milky sugar smell you'd expect along with a hint of coffee. taste is surprising, when they say milk stout they mean it. Very little taste up front with a finish that is like drinking a cup of coffee milk, with not enough of the coffee syrup to give it the proper coffee taste, but still carrying the sweetness of coffee milk that you might expect. Though it does carry some sweetness it wasn't as sweet as other milk stouts i have tryed.even after giving this a few swirls very little fizz appears on the top, and there is little carbonation to speak of. That truly milky aftertaste is bugging me a bit, making it somewhat ahrd to drink. It might be ok if it was balanced out with some better flavor up front, but it is really the only flavor it has and so i feel like i am drinking a oddly flavored skim milk. Thin and not sticky with little hop character. Normally from a milk stout i expect a typical stout flavor up front with milky sweatness coming later, but this only has a milk finish and not much else."
"notes: Good beer, I'd certainly not turn it down, but there are other sweet stouts I'd reach for first if I could."
"This beer pours slightly lighter in color than your average stout; however, it is still almost black in color. There was very little head on the beer, which I traditionally want more of in a stout. The head is a creamy brown, not khaki or tan like some have. It smells of dairy/sugar and a little bit of toffee/butterscotch and tastes pretty good. This beer is not as good as Bell's Double Cream; however, it is a solid American microbrew cream stout. I recommend it if you like cream stouts or are a left hand fan. You could definately drink more than one."
"Nice and easy on the palate. Style points for cows on bottle."
"It smelled like a stout with a shot of heavy cream, sugar, and chocolate. The beer's taste reflected this, but it wasn't very """stouty""". It didn't seem very adventurous. It has it's hops and the tastes ive mentioned, but it's lack of carbonation and lack of complexity work against it. Still, i have to say this is a quality beverage that would be excellent with a chocolate dessert."
"One dimensional, being all smokey, dark roasted malt. A good quality in a beer, but it shouldn't be the only one."
"This is a good desert beer, but there are much better."
"Overall, I enjoyed this brew. I had some misgivings as I observed the results of my pour but got past that once I smelled and tasted it. It's not a robust stout but a nice, rather light and smooth one that's worth taking a flyer on."
"Overall, a big hit with my group of friends. This was the beer that dominated last night. Delicious and will be a future purchase again!"
"Color is a nice molasses brown/almost black, not much head at all, but just enough carbonation. Aroma is mostly of roasted malt and sweetness. Taste is a bit roasty at first but becomes quite sweet quickly with mingling flavors of coffee and cholocate in the bacgroung. Milk sugar is apparent and lends a nice smoothness to this beer. Finish is still sweet, a little dry, and leaves a hint of vanilla in my mouth. Mouthfeel is fairly medium, I would say it's fairly drinkable but not remarkable."
"OK, but not the best stout. Many better sweet stouts out there."
"Taste: The taste is probably this beer's best quality and it is only so-so. The stout is as I expected, very thin. There is faint malted barley present covered with a very slick and sugary milk remnant. Drinkability: It goes down really easy. It's got very minimal hopping, not very much roast. There is a hint of smoke also. It's got to be one of the sweetest stouts I've ever tasted. It's also the most borderline in terms of mouthfeel I've tasted. It goes down too easy, and tastes sweet. That's good for some beers. But its not what I look for in a stout."
"Being left handed, I'm a sucker for anything that is remotely related to left-handedness. So I had to pick up this Left Hand Milk Stout when I saw it. Pours a deep black, with a head that fades quickly - too quickly in my opinion. Smell contains roasted malt. Tastes like a stout milkshake - the milk sugar is very pronounced. A bit too strong for my taste, but delicious nonetheless. The sweetness makes this beer good for dessert, but more than one in a session might be a challenge."
"This one looked and sounded good when I bought it but ended up dissappointing me. Color is the usual - near black with a nice head. It smells pretty good but a little too sweet. The taste is just lacking anything that gives me pause. It's sweet, though not as much as the aroma would indicate, but not very rich. There's a touch of bittersweet chocolate and not much else to talk about. Feels thin and watery in the mouth. Wha happen? I've said it before: I could probably drink a bunch of these but I don't think I'd want to."
"Aroma is a decadent mocha and milk chocolate, but the taste doesn't quite live up to it. Rich chocolate and coffee tones lead the way, with an almost Hershey's sweetness. Drys slightly in the finish, with roasted malt making an appearance. This would be worthy of a 4 if not for the metallic, almost canned background flavor."
"It poured a dark brown, almost black color. Sadly, the head was almost non-existant and what was there quickly faded. The aroma was malty and roasted. The mouthfeel isn't as smooth as I anticipated as it was slightly prickly. The taste is accentuated by a bitter roastiness that hints at coffee notes. The milky texture is more apparent in the finish, which is also exceedingly dry and toasty. Just an average milk stout, expected more."
"Light - medium body (but thats pushing it) makes it easy for anyone to put down fast, but there's not much to it."
"Deep ruby color and thin head that dissipates to a hairline ring and wisps of tan foam. Aroma suggests burnt grains and instant mocha mix. Flavor is sweet and malty on the front, then resolves to roasty, coffeeish, dryish and bitter on the finish. It has a weird watery feel in the mouth after several quaffs. I's a pretty decent, above average, easy drinkin' sweet stout."
"Nice dark almost black color....head left quickly with little lacing. Nice coffee, roasted aroma...very inviting. Taste had a nice burnt malt, light coffee taste with just a touch of hops at the finish. Mouthfeel was light to medium with a nice dry, slightly bitter finish. Easy enough to drink...a good stout that is worth trying."
"Overall I give it an """eh""" it's not horrible, but it's not fantastic either. Maybe I'll give it another try again sometime."
"This beer was served way too cold (thank you very much Beer Sellar) so I had to let it warm to get any flavor out of it. It was quite dark, but not quite opaque... deep brown with amber highlights, and very little head. Aroma is a nice mixture of malt, chocoalte, and some herbal notes. Flavor begins sweet with notes of chocoalte, just a touch of coffee peaks through, then it finishes with a touch of earthy hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is slightly thin, with low carbonation. All in all, not a bad milk stout, but nothing to write home about either."
"Very deep reddish-brown, almost black but not quite. The aroma was quite unusual, sweet, slightly chocolatey - enticing. Flavour was a steady sweetness as a base, with hints of chocolate, burnt, and subtle hop flavours coming through. Aftertaste was mildly sweet, as would be expected. Different. Pleasant to drink; good but not outstanding."
"22 oz. bomber. Nice tan head. The nose was very sweet with lots of chocolate smells. The hops were extremely subdued. The beer was a dark brown to black color. The initial taste was quite sweet. This beer seemed more like a chocolate stout to me. The lactose was present but balanced well with the malts to make a chocolate flavor. I would have pinned this with the chocolate stout moniker, had I been blindfolded. This beer is good and highly drinkable."
"I have to give it to the marketing group over at Left Hand because they do a bang up job with their labels. This stout poured very thin. Little to no head was generated from an aggressive pour. The color is a deep red when held to light. Very subtle nose. The first taste was smooth and sweet. The mouthfeel was a little too thin. Has a sweet flavor with chocolate notes throughout. The interesting thing about this beer is that it tastes very wet. If that makes sense. It makes my mouth water which activates my reflex to drink more and more and more...you get the picture. This is a good party beer. Not too heavy so you won't fill up. A nice, simple stout."
"Left Hand Milk Stout is not a stout, I don't care what the label says. A light porter maybe, but not even a very good one of those."
"Texture is a little creamy with soft gentle carbonation. This is a very nice drinkable stout, the flavors are really tasty I just wish they were a little more robust."
"Drinkability is good because this is quite light and easy drinking, now whether you'll want another one is another story as it's not too interesting."
"A very average beer at best. The smell should have clued me in as it had hints of coffee and chocolate but an off brewery smell (the smell of the mash tun). First sip reminded me very much of Heineken Dark (not a good thing at all). Chocolate and coffee were present but quickly got ruined by a lackluster malt bill that seemed more like an american macro with some barley tossed in. I love milk stouts but this was a real tragedy."
"The Milk Stout poured black with red highlights. It had a small head that quickly went down to a collar. The aroma was coffee, roasted malts and some nuttiness. It was a sweet, creamy stout and tasted of sweet malts initially with a bitter, nutty, coffee-like finish. A little thin on the palate and a little too sweet for me. Overall, not a bad stout. The sweet and the bitter probably could have been better balanced."
"Have had it on a regular tap and also from a beer engine, the beer engine makes it very silky, and very nice. The scores are for the engine."
"It pours with a nice opaque black color with a delicate white head. Sweet malt dominates the aroma and flavor with just barely enough hops to keep it from becoming cloying. Body is rather thin compared to most stouts. After taste was pleasant malt. Very simple, drinkable and pleasant for lighthearted drinking. This would be a good introduction to stouts for the Bud drinker."
"Poured a dark color with an off white head and left a small amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma was of burned malts and chocolate and coffee. The flavor was very common with the aroma and other beers in this style, but the coffee taste was a bit too strong for my liking in this one."
"Poured black with just the smallest of heads,light coffee, chocolate earthy aroma. Sweet malty first taste, very smooth mouthfeel, coffeeish aftertaste, a raisin taste came on as it warmed. All those flavors yet it didn't seem that complex. I will buy single bottles occasionally."
"I expected a sweeter taste and a little more body."
"This not my favorite milk stout, but it's not bad either. It taste to me more like a coffee mixed with nuts, cream, and some chocolate. It was stronger on the coffee though. The color was a deep, dark red, but had a brownish head to it. It was smooth, I'll give it that much. It actually got better, the warmer it got. It's cheap and I like it, so I will have to get some more."
"Pours a near black with auburn highlights and a khaki colored, creamy head that eventually thins across the surface of the body. Aroma consists of roasted malt, creamed coffee and sweet chocolate. The mouthfeel is full-bodied and smooth. Taste is decent, but nothing too spectacular. Roasted chocolate malt dominates the palate. Definitely a sweeter overall flavor. Finish is milder and has hardly any bitterness and no lingering dryness, ala an Irish Stout, which this is not anyway. I suppose I only mention that because I do prefer those qualities in a stout. Left Hand & Tabernash's Milk Stout is a good offering and worth trying, just with so many options out there this does little to set itself apart. None-the-less a worthy offering."
"taste like chocolate milk mixed w/ hops, but in a good way. very nice little brew we got going on here.Got the creamy feel mixed with a hint-o-hopness. Sits well when you get it down. Very good for winter, or even early fall. I am digging this as much as I dig oatmeal stouts, and that is going some. Very drinkable"
"Black in spots, orange tints interwoven, ruby around the edges, smallish light beige head, quick to dissipate... a few odd specks of lace. Lovely sugary sweetness, rich chocolate, and coffee nose… the bouquet shows excellent depth, very inviting. The palate is less enthusiastic. Chalky and dry… vaguely sweet (you’d expect more lactose sweetness), cocoa powder, faint coffee hints. Fairly complex… excellent hops influences at the finish, it builds on the coffee flavors nicely. Medium-light body, silky, minimal carbonation… slightly thin mouthfeel. Drinkable, enjoyment is moderate though… good enough to try, not great enough to drink repeatedly. It does represent the style very well. Try one if it is handy."
"This beer poured a very dark amber, almost black color and formed a nice big medium tan head that coated the glass with lace as it subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, coffee and and burnt chocolate is present. A flavor of malt and coffee. Fairly light for this style and a slight burnt bitterness in the finish. Not a bad beer."
"I'd have to say that I really enjoyed this beer...there are better, more complex, more intriguing stouts, but this one sure was a joy to drink."
"This is another beer I probably would have passed on if not for Beer Advocate reviews. Pours a bit thinner & lighter than your average stout, with ligh passing through to give deep, dark red but almost black color. Head is decent but did'nt last long in my glass. Smell is of roasted coffee right away..very sweet & inviting. No other aromas detected, but man this smells good. Taste lives up to the name. This is one of the most bizarre beers I've had. Starts off with a mild malty coffee taste, then gives way to a truly milk-like taste & mouthfeel. Mouthfeel if slightly thin for a stout but still good & smooth. It did have a slightly sticky aftertaste & feel.. As far as stouts go this is easy to quaff. Interesting & suprisingly good beer. By the way, the 7% ABV is totally lost in the mix."
"A great example of the """beershake.""" Loads of roasted malt flavors with a creamy, luxurious mouthfeel. Dark chocolate and coffee notes vie for dominance in the mocha equation. Lactose sugars are noteworthy in a soft sweet finish. 7% abv? Astounding - never would have guessed, the alcohol is subdued and hardly evident."
"12oz.Bottled on 05/06/03. Deep ruby red with light illuminating through the glass. Carbonation seems very active as I pour and a small and lightly compacted head develops. Aroma is like choco-milk with a subtle roasted malt flavor. Body is crisp and a bit thin for a stout. Decent flavor though somewhat light tasting for the style. Cocoa, coffe and a nutty flavor as well. Slight dry finish."
"This brew be 4s across the board. A good look with a strong nose and good flavoring and mouthfeel make this a solid stout to be reckoned with. The pour creates a solid dark brown color with ruby highlights. The head is a quickly-gone thick beige that leaves a moderate amount of lace. The flavor is rich stout with plenty of coffee and chocolate with which to deal. Solid, not doubt about it."
"Poured a nice dark brown with a thick creamy head. Aromas are distinctly coffee and mocha. The first sip bombards my palate with the same flavors of coffee and mocha blended together very smoothly for a nice bittersweet finish that is very creamy in mouthfeel (typical of the milk stouts.) As the beer warms the flavors become more intense, but I do not notice anything new. Seemed a bit thinner in the pour than I was expecting, but the creamy mouthfeel definitely made up for it. I am also VERY surprised to read that it weighs in at 7% ABV.... seemed much lighter to me this evening."
"Pours a dark and flat almost black color with a tinge of ruby. Thin beige head and quick lacing. Aroma is lightly bitter coffee and chocolate. Somewhat light-bodied given the look and ABV of it. Roasty with flavors of coffee, grain, and chocolate. The milk is more evident in the sweet finish than anywhere else. Not bad."
"Clear deep mohagony appearance. A wispy beige head caps the beer and recedes to just a thin coating rather quickly. Collar is substantial. Lacing barely clings to hang on. Some milk chocolate. Mocha. And burnt malts as well. All in all, a very inviting aroma. After the wonderful smell, I'm a bit let down with the taste. But nonetheless, it's still better than average. A blanket of milk sweetness and lactic sugars cover the underlying bittersweet chocolate and java tones. The mouthfeel is good. Very creamy and silky. Low on the carbontation and high on the velvety feel. This is a beer I might pick up every now and then if it were available around here."
"The pour is ebony in color, the head inconsequential in size, the structure patchy clumps of large bubbles, the color a light chocolate. Nose is roasted grains, bittersweet chocolate with a sweet malt start, top is light to moderate in feel, the finish crisply acidic, the hops pleasant in their spicy bite, dry aftertaste. In the interest of being kind we will call it a Beginners Stout or your Entry into the Dark Side, most stouts have little to fear form this one!"
"Pours a nice dark brown color. Decent head. Chocolate and mild roastiness in the aroma. The taste is very sweet, with a good balance of the roastiness and chocolate. Goes down real easy. I also love the cow with the handprints on the label. All in all a good sweet stout!"
"Aromas of semi-sweet to bitter chocolate and expresso. The scents followed through the flavor. Semi-sweet chocolate with a slight bitter finish. Very creamy and smooth. Goes down easy with little hints that it is 7.0% ABV"
"A dark amber from the pour, with very little head at all. Some chocolate and coffee comes across in the aroma. My first sip detects the creamy additive of milk, along with undertones the previously mentioned coffee and chocolate raost. There is a milky consistency to the flavor of the beer. It's a fairly carbonated beer. A hint of nuttiness in the aftertaste. As a side note, the bubbles on the surface formed a shape similar to that of a koala's face...maybe I should quit drinking. Drinkability is easy on this stout."
"A very intriguing brew. The aroma leaves something of a creamy sense there. The first sip says that very same thing. However, the bier does not, in any way, leave a heavy feeling on the tongue. How can a brew have a creamy feel, yet not be creamy nor heavy in mouthfeel? Very interesting. Well worth seeking out, if you can find it. Prost!"
"A milk stout taken to its logical conclusion. But in the end, it seems to adopt more of the former part of its title than the later."
"poured nicely black with ruby red hue,light head caramel colored head that left a nice lace.Smelled of very bitter chocolate,tasted nece and sweet with chocolate and burnt tones,very creamy in texture,like drinking desert.Nice hop flavor to balance out at the end,I really enjoyed this stout."
"(Bottled Xmas eve-02)-- Pours a light mahogany color. Head is initially average sized, frothy, light brown, but mostly diminishing. On the nose the aroma of caramel, peanuts, milk chocolate and roasted grain. Mouthfeel is fairly smooth. On the palate the flavors of roasted coffee beans, peanuts, roasted malts, buttery, charcoal, caramel, milk chocolate, and bittersweet flavors. Overall good mellow stout."
