"Tasted really thin. I was hoping for something more robust."

"This poured an opaque dark black with a thin tan head that disappeared fairly quickly.  There is definitely roasted espresso, dark chocolate and a bit of bread on the nose.  At first I don't get much flavour but there is that espresso and chocolate in the aftertaste that lingers for a short time.  Funny enough that as it warms up the flavour profile does change a bit almost reminding me of a cold Double Double from your local coffee shop.  The carbonation balances the mouthfeel down a notch to a high medium.  I think this one of those beers that would benefit as a nitro just to smooth it out a bit more."

"I'm not much of a fan of darker beers, I read about milk stouts and was interested so I went out and got a bottle of this. Confirmed my opinion on the brew"

"On nitro at the taproom."
"The pour results in a very slight fizzy khaki colored head the quickly disappears...  What remains is a very slight lacing and thin to moderate collar...  Carbonation bubbles can be seen bursting through the surface...  The color is a deep brown that allows a bit of light to leak in around the edges providing a light reddish hue of undertones...  The aroma is exactly as expected and rather enjoyable...  Mild espresso is at the forefront of each and every whiff...  Next in line is the roasted malt...  Finally there are hints of vanilla and caramel...  The flavor profile is much more muted than I would have expected based on the stellar aroma...  Everything seems to be watered down a notch or two...  On the lighter side of medium bodied...  Some fizzy carbonation to start...  Chalky throughout...  Has some characteristics similar to espresso (minus the carbonation)...  Not a bad beer, but nothing to memorable either...  The aroma is stellar, but all other facets are average or only slightly better..."

"Overall - A spot on and knock out of the park Milk stout. The creamy sweetness is showcased nicely in this brew and the espresso bean and roasted malts add a nice supporting cast."
"Nice."

"A decent, pepped-up coffee stout, with enough attendant milk and cream notes to nudge it nicely into the style designation here.  The Emerald City may lay claim to a metric shit ton of the two main players here, and in so doing, has engendered an affable meeting of worlds."

"Poured a deep, dark brown with about two fingers of mocha head. Nice aroma of fresh coffee and a slight sweet essence. Taste is a balance of fresh coffee with chocolate and a light sweetness. This is not an overpowering coffee stout. Was slightly disappointed in feel as it comes in thinner than expected and very carbonated. Overall a solid drink if you enjoy a coffee stout that won't be heavy handed."
"Recommended!"
""
""
"Nice dark brown with a tan head that sticks around a good while. Awesome espresso smell! Starts off kind of sweet and finishes just like the nose with a big espresso flavor! Feels pretty watery, and that's gotta be the only thing I'd hold against this beer.  This is an excellent espresso milk stout!"
""
""
""
""
"The quality of the coffee flavor in this beer is second to none. Very drinkable with a strong flavor profile."
""
""
""
""
"Nice hit of coffee up-front that then mingles with the sweet-ish roast of the finish.  Very impressive and delicious, especially considering that this is much lower abv than most coffee stouts these days.  I don't miss the higher gravity at all.  Bravo, Elysian!"
""
"Overall, in my opinion, this is a pretty sessionable millk/sweet stout. She does everything that Elysian wanted. Good job guys!"
""

"Light bodied, big espresso notes.  Great smell.  Crazy drinkable."

"Nice amount of coffee, which balances the milk stout sweetness, and good body for the moderate ABV. Thumbs up!"
""
""
""
"Delicious taste and finish like drinking a smooth espresso"
""
""
"Overall - No joke, this tastes quite reminiscent of a quad-shot mocha complete with whipped cream topping from your local coffee shop. While not nearly that sweet, it's still very rich and decadent tasting... almost to a fault: I don't think I could have more than a few of these in a session. That being said, I would think this is practically spot in for the style. A pretty damn impressive beer, overall."
"This beer is easy drinking and possibly the best coffee beer I've tried.  Excellent all around."

"Mouthfeel is very nice and overall a very tasty beer."

"12/25/13 On nitro tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Great example of a nitro pour. Silky smooth. Just the right touch of chocolate & espresso. Polite. 5.6% invites a session but it may weigh a bit heavy. Lacing is an entertainment unto itself. Always a sign, IMO, of a well made brew."

"At the risk of sounding redundant – this offering fell short of expectations."
""
"Lovely creamy carbonation, feels a little watery though."
"Overall, a beer that just didn't live up to the name. With a name like """espresso", I expect, overpowering, bitter, coffee grounds on the smell and taste. And part of the problem is that there are so many really good coffee stouts out there these days that this one, even though it's far from a poor beer, it just doesn't move the needle in relation to it's comparables."
""
"Dark brown pour, milky espresso flavor mixed with baker`s chocolate and a bit of dark chocolate. Retention is decent. Body is a bit thin though it does have a nice bitter coffee finish."
""
""

""
""
"This is my 2nd time having this beer. Smells like a stout. Tastes like a big, beautiful, beer latte. Excellent creamy mouthfeel, goes down really smooth. This is now officially one of my favorite dark beers."
"O-Overall a very enjoyable milk stout that I would get again."
"Not sure how this one ended in my fridge but for some reason a stout was sounding good. Already drank a Belgian Bomber so not sure if that will affect my review of this one. Outstanding looking beer with a good treat to the nose, although coffee is the most prominent smell. Taste, really smooth with strong Coffee taste but nothing overwhelming. Overall a very good beer that is reasonably easy to drink but with the low ABV I expected more, I actually dinged it overall due to low ABV. To much coffee for that ABV in my opinion. While it is a very good beer I would be not probably revisit, although if you were a stout, and especially a coffee stout fan then this may interest you."

"O: Overall the espresso nature starts to pick up with some rich, deep coffee grounds balanced by some minor sweet milk chocoalte notes. Not as sweet per style as many, but the extra rich espresso nature picks up for some of the slack making this somewhat interesting."
""
"Pours a black color. 1/3 inch head of a tan color. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells of coffee, sweet malt, roasted malt, hint of chocolate, hint of oatmeal, and slight hop. Fits the style of a Milk / Sweet Stout. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. There is also a slight bitterness. Tastes of coffee, sweet malt, hint of oatmeal, hint of yeast, hint of chocolate, slight roasted malt, and a hint of hop. Overall, weak appearance, but good aroma, body, blend, and complexity."
"Overall: I was impressed with this one. Nice aroma and tasty for such low abv. I shouldve drank this in the morning. If you're a fan of coffee stouts or prefer the taste of coffee rather than beer, this is right up your alley. I thought this was better than the Lagunitas Cappuccino Stout I had a couple days ago. I thoroughly enjoyed this and will seek out another when I want a beer for breakfast."
"Overall a really nice, straightforward coffee stout. Enjoyable."
""
""
""
"This is an amazingly drinkable milk stout. I enjoyed it with a Philly stake sandwich on a spectacular Spring day, by the Canal."
"O - I fear I may be slightly ruined regarding non-imperial stouts. Unfortunately this tasted and felt washed out to me but that may not be the beer's fault. In an effort to rate to style I rated .25 higher than I was originally inclined on most categories."
""
"Poured from a 22 into a pint glass. The beer appears very dark with little transparency and has a big light brown head that leaves little lacing. It has a nice espresso smell with a hoppiness. It's a nice split shot between fresh hops and your morning espresso. Very nice. It has a creamy mouth feel with a dry finish. Overall a good choice for breakfast or brunch."
""
""
"O: If you do not like coffee this should be avoided. It is very coffee forward and coffee in the mid and late - it is coffee everywhere. I am not a coffee drinker but I enjoy this beer. I like that Elysian just said, """ah screw it let's not nibble around the edges - let's just make coffee with some stout in there.""" I like this and will drink it again. I am excited to suggest it to a few friends that are coffee drinkers."
""
""
""
"Grabbed this stout at Fathead's Saloon, I enjoyed this stout. A Nice dark brown/black appearance with a sweet smell. Tasted great! I could really taste the Espresso, it wasn't super overpowering, which made it great. It was light for a stout, but still tasted good."

"Good coffee stout, but not great."
""
"When I first tasted Split Shot, I thought, """Now here's a brew for the espresso lover!""" It is a perfect """dessert""" stout, delicious served by itself, or with just about any sweet treat, particularly chocolate. It is the ideal post prandial brew, not a bit of bitterness, just rich, creamy, silky smooth, eminently quaffable, but why hurry? This is a brew to be sipped and savored until the very last drop. In the future Split Shot will be my brew of choice following a meal, and am looking forward to making ice cream floats with it in the summer!"

"Overall, delicious. One of those coffee beers that is excellent at imitating coffee, and the lactose helps add some body and sweetness. Love it!"

"A limited run brew and my first experience with Elysian. A new favorite while it lasts."
""
"Never did this feel strong and had there been more here, I would have easily downed another in one sitting. Most beers of this style are sweet but this leaned more towards the smooth and dark attributes that the coffee brought out in it. Fine just by itself as a dessert beer, this would be worth seeking out due to its limited release. Judge this beer by its bottle - it has a beauty and nuance on the inside that matches its artful appearance on the outside. Wonderfully smooth stuff!"
""
"This was a nice beer. A little less rich than I expected from the taste."

"Price point - $2.30/12 oz single"

"A very enjoyable coffee, breakfast themed Milk Stout!"
""
"Overall outstanding beer that I'd love to have again"
""

"This is amazing, this brewery keeps on surprising me."
""
"Overall a a decent milk stout. It could be a little creamier, but it's good. It's also better warmer."
""
""
""
""
"We done guys, great use of coffee here with a near perfect balance."
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Pretty simple but QUITE delicious. Like a carbonated iced mocha. Only real detraction is the sudden and sharp dryness of the aftertaste. Still tasty!"

"O: Not a bad beer, first time I ever tried it, a nice balance throughout and nice warming effect as well, Somewhat filling."

"this stuff is great. a sessionable milk stout with a bit of coffee, subtle on that front, easy drinking and delicious. dark brown pour with some viscosity and about an inch of head, close to white, that sticks around pretty well. the nose is more of the lactose sugar than the espresso, but i get the classic bitterness from the coffee to balance the sweetness of the stout. the grain is fresh and well roasted, not super dark, with some chocolate notes in both aroma and flavor. the coffee is up front in the taste, not dominant at all, but just an accent. similarly, i dont get much caffeine from this, which aids drinkability for me. the back end is the milk stout part, the lactose sugar gives sweetness and body to an already rich feeling drink, with excellent carbonation this is very satisfying. elysian makes some great pumpkin beer, and now its nice to see some of their other stuff on the market here in denver, this is very good milk stout."
""
""

"Worth a try if you like milk stouts and coffee beers. Lots going on and very interesting and enjoyable."
""

"An impressive beer delivering exactly what it says it does. I actually found myself trying to taste this beer in different ways, from chewing, to popping a quick shot. Everytime fitting some new level of flavor. Espresso? It's there! Milk Stout? Absolutely! This beer followed up in that exact order too with impressive notes of coffee and a creamy finish you would think this beer was made by Starbucks themselves! What a great brew!"

"Overall, a very good stout. Not too dry and not too overpowering in one element(coffee or creamy). Comes off as well balanced between the two."
"O: A solid coffee stout. While it isn't the most exciting, it's still a nicely balanced example of the style. I could easily drink this again, and even buy it again."

"D: A light-drinking stout, roasty with plenty but not too much espresso and milk. I'd prefer a full on milk stout like Left Hand or Nitro."
""
""
""

"Overall: this beer is really, really working for me. It's got the right balance and it really goes down easy. Kudos to the brewers."

"Bomber into traditional English stout glass. Perfect color, decent head and left some decorative lace. Aroma was a sweet, espresso. Taste was perfectly balanced. Chocolate and coffee notes. Bitterness on the back end but not overpowering. Medium+ viscosity. Wonderful aftertaste. This is one rock solid, sweet stout! I'm sure if I was an espresso drinker, I would appreciate it even further. Good stuff!"
""
""
""
""
""
" The taste has that lactose sweet creaminess with a nice caramel tinge coming in as the espresso trails behind with slight roasted flavors more bean than malt but mild in bitterness and is really smooth. I think they have made a practically near-perfect subtle espresso flavored milk stout I really enjoy the taste and if there were any more espresso it might disrupt the balance which I think is what makes this so drinkable."
""
""
"Really hitting the spot."
""
""
"O: A decent coffee-forward stout for sure, with a light body and good coffee/roasted bean flavors. Would have loved to seen the milk sugars shine more, but its tough to share the adjunct spotlight with coffee I'm sure."
"Overall- Pretty much a good and solid milk stout. Definitely worth a try and I might pick this up again. I generally like my stouts to be a bit heavier but I can make an exception for a solid and very accessible example."
""
"Overall an above average milk stout, I like the roasted flavor the coffee brings"
""
""
""
"Overall: I could drink this beer all night long as it's rich without being heavy and it isn't too high in terms of ABV."
""
""
""
""
""
"Don't hesitate to give it a try."
""
""
"O- Super solid coffee beer with a good balance of sweetness, espresso, chocolate and lactose."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: killer espresso stout with a different twist of being a milk stout. Elysian does it again with another surprise and another dynamite brew. Prost!"
""
""
""
"Poured into a schooner from a 12 oz. bottle: A thick, cafe colored head that sustained throughout with layered lacing. Smells like a late. Tastes like a spiced/burnt late. Very good and great example of the style. Could use more heat from more alcohol."
""
""
""
"Overall: Perhaps a year in the bottle did not serve this well but the beer is not particularly impressive - the body doesn't hold up and the flavors seem a bit underattenuated"
""
"O: an enjoyable coffee stout, overall, especially for the low abv. Robust and with a lot of nice coffee notes, this beer is drinkable and tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This could be an excellent brew if the mouthfeel offered a richer experience on par with the scent and the taste. Overall, still enjoyable and might still reach for it with my eggs benny."
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer has a lot of great potential, but it is mostly squandered. The aroma and taste match up well, but are too simplistic to really make for a great beer. This beer is merely good, before factoring in the mouthfeel. It ends up just being a typical, average stout in the end. 13.5/20"

"cheers LampertLand"
"Overall – A pretty tasty stout. With it not being too heavy, it having a creamier feel and nice sweeter finish it is quite pleasant to drink and a nice beer to sip after a meal."
"A good, not great coffee stout. The coffee and milk stout flavors are fairly well balanced, but the dry, sour aftertaste keeps it a one and done bottle, not something I’d want to session."
""
""
""
""
""
"It did have a nice smoothness and a pleasing sweetness so I do think Elysian has some great stout making abilities but marrying it pleasingly with coffee didn't work out too well with this one."
"Pours black with brown highlights and a good helping of tan/brown head. Good retention. Aroma is big on coffee, I think mostly from the coffee, but also complemented by the dark roast malt. Quite a bit of lactose in the nose as well and a small helping of hop. Taste follows with big coffee and dark roasts. Sweetness there too though and a balancing bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth yet bitter, both coffee and hop I suspect. Overall a great beer. My first milk stout."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a small tan head. The aroma is full of lactose and cream with some coffee notes. The flavor is full of chocolate and coffee notes, with some lactose thrown in. I also get a hint of roasted malt in the flavor. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A bit more of a sweeter coffee beer, which was good, but not the best I've had for sure."
""
""
"Overall: great coffee stout. Smoothe drinker. I like stouts that don't use a lot of black patent. This is a good one. Coffee tones are just right."
"Overall. Coffee taste was okay but the beer wasn't big enough to back it up."
"O- This is as advertised a sweet stout with a big coffee overload. Very robust and sweet flavor, even with the big coffee flavor and bitterness, the sweetness still seems to dominant more. Reminiscent of a mocha with tons of milk or cream with whipped cream on top. Lots of great flavors and little over the top, definitely worth seeking out."
""
""
""
"On the fuller end of medium bodied with a robust, deeply roasted coffee flavor that's countered by sweeter malts.  Not acrid or overly roasted with subtle smokiness, espresso, dark chocolate and oatmeal.  This is countered by lighter chocolate, toffee and hazelnut as well as some lactic cream.  Still a heavy coffee flavor but well balanced and enjoyable."
""
"Overall: I loved the smell of this beer. Its not super complex, but elysian definately made what they set out to do! Great beer! Suprised it does not get more love from people who review it."
""
"Been interested in this one. Pours a nice black coffee with a bit of light mocha foam and no lace. Smells of coffee and hints of lactose sweetness. The coffee is bold and almost spicy with hints of soil and tobacco - nice nose. Flavor comes through delivering quite a bit of lactose sweetness, actually so much it reminds me of non-dairy creamer. Cocoa, bitterness, coffee, smooth roastyness. I like the flavor, but I can see how some would perceive it to taste """cheap""". Full bodied with a reserved carbonation and wet finish. Overall decent beer, and something really approachable for all, but I wouldn't buy more than a couple times a year if always around."
"o - Overall this is exactly as it sounds, and a pretty good beer. The nose and taste have a lot of espresso and sweet milk/cream and chocolate, as opposed to more of a coffee grind flavor that some coffee stouts have. Very good nose and taste, though the mouthfeel is too think and not carbonated enough. Worth checking out and would have it again."
"3.0 D: Normally I'd give this a 3.5, but the nose was borderline and the mouthfeel was weak."
"Dark, chalky black, thin cap of khaki head. Scent brings dark roasted espresso bean, cream and sugar, light notes of nuttyness. Tatste strong with roasted bean and freshly brewed dark coffee, good sugar and cream notes, finishes with a strong peanut buttery note. Fuller side of medium, smooth with some graniness. Solid milk stout all around."
""
""
""
"More like a dry stout, fresh on tap at Cole’s. Licorice and roast aromas. Off notes, like mold,which is likely the lactose milk part that sometimes emits this, more like goat cheese and coffee unhappily married. Dry finish. Above average mouthfeel though oily."
""
""
""
"Overall this is an interesting beer. If you are like me and love coffee then you will like this beer. However if you are looking for something a little more beer like avoid this as the coffee dominates this beer to an extreme degree. Its almost more like drinking iced coffee then a beer."
"The body was average for a milk stout, smooth and a bit creamy. Drinkability will, obviously, depend on your taste for coffee. If you love the stuff, you will love this beer. Overall, you could get one of these instead of an iced coffee at Starbucks and be just as satisfied. I don't mind roasted notes in beer, and if there is a hint of coffee to complement the the malts and grain in a beer, that's acceptable. But when the adjunct in a beer so completely overpowers the basic """Beeriness""" of a beer, that beer has gone off the rails. I cannot recommend this beer to the non-coffee lover."
"overall: a nice coffee stout and a nice choice for SBW"
""
""
""
"On tap at Elysian Fields in Seattle. Pours black, black, black with a nice espresso colored creamy head. Smells of strong espresso/earthy coffee and big sweet chocolate. Flavor follows with a full on mocha bomb, chocolate-espresso-chocolate-espresso, with a nice earthy bitter finish from the roasty coffee that melds nicely with the lactose and chocolate. Medium mouthfeel, and goes down like velvet. One of the best I have had of the style--did this not turn out as well in the bottle?"
""
"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a very dark, almost opaque reddish brown. Thin light brown head with good retention and lacing. Aroma dominated by chocolate and coffee; malts are not noticeable. Flavor is similar, tastes like a chocolate / espresso shake, faint toasted malt. Light toasted malt and sharp, lightly burnt coffee finish. Very smooth and integrated. A nice, flavorful coffee stout. Medium to heavy bodied with nice creaminess."
"O - Coffee and more coffee. A good choice as any for Seattle beer week."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is nice, a little dry, a little gritty. Overall, this is good, but not great."
"Overall: Definitely worth giving a try if you're a fan of coffee beers. Easy to drink and a good beer to represent Seattle Beer Week."
""
""
""
"O: Really enjoyable. This beer could be huge as an imperial stout, but nonetheless the milk stout approach with the lower ABV was nice. Sweet milky body with dark chocolate and coffee complexity. One of the better coffee beers I've had in a long time. 2012 Seattle Beer Week will certainly be a memorable one!"
