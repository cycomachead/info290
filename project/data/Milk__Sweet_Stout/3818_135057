The middle has  a slight roast bitterness that fades allowing a nice burst of lemon to come forward.  The finish is a slightly sweet lingering espresso flavor that is slightly tart.

Tastes of espresso, roasted malt, faint notes of brown sugar, finishes with quick flash of lemon peel. Mouthfeel fairly thin with a bit of creaminess. Alcohol almost completely disguised, but you start to taste it (and feel it) a few sips in. This is a beer without many flaws and without many memorable features either. I can't help but feel that pouring an splash of iced coffee with a twist of lemon in a milk stout might end up with the same result.","lipster","Mar 26, 2015"

This one is interesting enough, but I see it as nothing more than a creative recipe that is fun to try, but doesn't exactly leave you wanting more.  The taste of the beer seemed very artificial to me.  You can definitely taste all the flavors advertised, I am just of the opinion that it's not very well done.  The coffee is definitely there, as is the lemon peel, they just feel fake and the thinness of the beer does not help the cause.  Overall, this is just an average beer to me, but fun to try if you are sick of traditional style stouts/porters.","Pourharddrinkslow","Feb 07, 2015"

Head retention and lacing are both decent enough.  The brew smells like coffee, caramel, chocolate, lemon peel and lactose/sugar.  I think the taste is just like the aroma, with the coffee, chocolate, lactose and caramel flavors being the strongest, but with the lemon peel/citrus definitely noticeable too.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy with moderate carbonation.  I wasn't sure how the lemon peel/citrus would work with a milk stout, but I think it turned out good.  It's worth trying at least once, I know I wouldn't mind trying this again.  $1.84 for a single bottle.","bluejacket74","Feb 07, 2015"

3.88,-0.5,4.25,3,4,4.5,4.25,"Well it's noon so about time to try a breakfast type brew and this has espresso in the name so let's give it a whirl.  Popping the top I get a waft of sweetness of malt and a roasted malts.  Pours to a barely tranlucent motor oil with a three fonger multi-size bubble tan head.  On the taste this brew has the bitterness of coffee upfront with the sweet roasted malts and a solid middle of a nearly balanced cocoa and earthy hops, finishing with a slight alcohol twinge and a fading chaulky bitter finish.  Tasty indeed.  More hop twangy than I expected in a good way.  Great mouthfeel.  A spot on brew for brunch.","mooseisloose","Feb 06, 2015"

Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, coffee, lemon peel, and light herbal hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, lemon peel, caramel, toast, cream, light char, light herbal, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of roasted coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, lemon peel, caramel, toast, light char, light herbal, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt, coffee, lemon peel, and light herbal hop flavors; with a good malt bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, fairly creamy, and slightly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice coffee milk stout. All around good robustness, balance, and complexity of dark/roasted malt, coffee, lemon peel, and light herbal hop flavors; and very smooth to drink.

Thick and syrupy. Just like I likes m'stouts. Really, it's probably the closest thing I've tried to FBS that wasn't actually FBS, which is nice because FBS sold out incredibly quickly at my store this year. Basically saw it, bought it, came back two weeks later and they were already out. This beer is also considerably cheaper since it comes in a sixer, which is nice, though it's also a "mere" 7.5% ABV, which may be good or bad depending on the situation.","Sleepy_Conscience","Jan 15, 2015"

This is one instance where I would have preferred to have one of the flavors that is listed on a beer label not come through. But the lemon flavor and aroma is really in there in force! If you're the type of person who thinks "do you know what would go good with coffee? Lemonade and beer!" then this one is for you. For a coffee stout it is decent. With the flavor combination as a whole, I would not buy this again and I would not recommend it.","teromous","Jan 09, 2015"

3.37,-13.6,4.25,2.75,3.5,4,3.25,"Overall I thought this was a decent beer and I think it's a decent example of a Coffee Stout, but in the end I found it to taste more like regular black coffee than a espresso and the aroma made this beer rough around the edges.  This beer had ok drinkability, it was smooth, a little crisp, a little creamy, not too filling and the taste didn't do the best job at holding my attention, I think one would be my limit, any more than that and I might start to get bored with it.  What I like the most about this beer was the appearance and mouthfeel, they were both good and to me they were the highlights of this beer.  What I liked the least about this beer was the aroma, it wasn't good and it had some off aspects to it.  I wouldn't buy this beer again, it was nice to try once, but it isn't something that I feel the need to revisit any time soon.  If you really like Coffee Stouts it might be worth a try, but i wouldn't recommend it as a standout example of the style.  All in all this wasn't bad beer, but in the end I just wasn't a big fan of it and I found the off aromas to be a little surprising.  It's not a favorite beer from this brewery and it's not a favorite for the style either.  This beer just wasn't for me and I think it could use a little bit of work, better luck next time guys.","StoutHunter","Jan 01, 2015"

3.82,-2.1,4,3.75,4,3.75,3.5,"The taste has plenty of coffee yet still enough base of dry roasted malt to anchor the slight bitter flavors with mild acidity from the beans and light earthy flavor -it is really a coffee-dominant taste wtih slight alcohol in the finish. I would not be able to tell you it has lemon rind in it except for the label but perhaps that adds to some of the bitterness from the coffee in the roast flavor that lingers. Overall a good stout with lots of espresso -very good but more bitter than it needs to be -somewhat dry for the style and medium strength.","Slatetank","Dec 28, 2014"

The lemon peel must just be enough to stimulate the flavors, much like lemon zest in cooking, so don't go looking for or get put off by the prospect of coffee lemonade.  Personally I would like a more intense coffee experience, nevertheless another superb brew from Southern Tier.","Greatheil","Dec 27, 2014"
