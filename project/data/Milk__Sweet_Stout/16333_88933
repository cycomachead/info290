The base Buffalo Sweat Stout is fantastic, and this beer has all of the fantastic, base Buffalo Sweat Stout flavors, however, because this is billed a vanilla bean variant, brewed with vanilla beans, and because there is very little vanilla in both aroma and taste, this beer comes in more than a little disappointing.  It needs more vanilla.","Jeffreysan","Jan 25, 2015"

For a small brewery located in essence in Nowheresville, Kansas, Tallgrass really has some solid offerings, anchored by the Buffalo Sweat line. I also enjoy the 8-Bit Pale Ale. The have carved a niche out for themselves, I hope to see them do well and expand their product lines before too long.","TheCondor","Jan 24, 2015"

This one looks just like its progenitor, a garnet-tinged brown topped by a finger of slate foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, mild cocoa, sweet coffee beans, a stiff vein of vanilla bean, and a touch of heavy cream. The taste brings in more of the same, with the vanilla doing what it's supposed to do and serving as an extra topping, rather than o'erpowering the base. The coffee shines through fairly strongly here, but in a good way, playing quite nicely with the vanilla. The body is a staunch medium, with a light moderate carbonation, a smooth feel, and a nearly drying finish. Overall, a damn fine beer, one I hope to have plenty of in the coming months.","TMoney2591","Mar 21, 2014"

As I noted up top, I appreciate their base Buffalo Sweat, and I like a well done vanilla brew (personal preference: I prefer the flavour of vanilla bean to... extract or whatever the other ways of presenting it are. It just seems rounder, creamier, oilier... I don't really know how to explain it, just that it appeals more to me). This is a combination of a good base beer modified well. I don't know if you can get it outside of their variety 8 pack, but even if you can't it's well worth it (I mean, Ethos, 8-Bit and regular Buffalo Sweat are also super delicious, so there's no filler there).","kemoarps","Dec 03, 2013"

The taste is the same, a nice sweet roasted malty backbone, with nice hints of vanilla. Good full flavors, and the vanilla is nice and mellow.

Taste begins with a slight smokey flavor, then some caramel, after that a hint of vanilla, then a big milk finish. The aftertaste is rather smoky. Mouthfeel is good. Overall a very nice sweet stout. Plenty of flavor in a relatifvely low ABV.","tronester","Apr 24, 2013"

Aroma has very little vanilla, but does have hop, roast, malt, and a bit of earth. Flavor's like nose with hop more subdued, vanilla coming out a bit more, well balanced in kind of an odd way. Body is chewy, but despite the huge foam upon pouring, a little flat. Finish has an off vanilla thing that isn't an asset, longish and on one hand intriguing, but on the other, not. Curiously, weirdly - drinkable. Still trying to figure this out.","drpimento","Mar 03, 2013"

That, coupled with the lower abv make this a very drinkable beer. I'm not completely sure if I like this better than the original or not, but I'm leaning towards a "yes". Just like the original however I still feel like it leans more towards an oatmeal stout rather than a milk stout (although I definitely understand why it's classified as a milk stout.) This is a great beer if you enjoy vanilla.","Zachtheporter","Feb 21, 2013"

Taste is on the lighter side but very drinkable (5%). Smooth and sweet, this milk stout goes down easily, and the addition of vanilla is a perfect touch. Subtlety done too. I was expecting a heavier hand with it. This is a light, easy-drinking stout. At the moment, I'd like more flavor, but if I had a few more in the fridge I'd probably enjoy it just fine. I would like to compare it to the original to see how different it is. Overall worth a try.","JEdmund","Feb 13, 2013"
