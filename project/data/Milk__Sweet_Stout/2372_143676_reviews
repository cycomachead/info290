"p.s. Separately, I mixed some with Kahlua and it turned into an amazingly delicious beverage."

"Pours black with deep tan head that held fairly well before fading into a medium collar.  Aroma is sweet milk, coffee, milk chocolate, and roasted malts; but not much else.  Taste is like milk chocolate coffee water.  Pretty thing, and sticky in the mouth.  Carbonation is very low."
""
"The flavor is much weaker. Watered down coffee, some cacao bitterness, a good amount of lactose. In general, the beer is quite watery and lacking on the back palate. It however linger well for 6%, but about as well as the ABV can do."
""
"D: I wonder if some of the coffee flavor has diminished...I know coffee is something that fades significantly with time. still tasting good, just more on the chiato side of things. overall good, but nothing going nuts to find."

"Smells great but tastes and feels watery.  Both regular and white chocolate were mediocre and this is similar but with a bit more espresso roastiness."

"Overall:  This is quite a good milk/chocolate stout.  I really enjoyed the strong flavors of chocolate and malt and the creamy, smooth mouthfeel.  Good beer, Terrapin!!"

"O: Nice coffee milk stout. Great coffee aroma, nicely balanced flavors of coffee, chocolate and cream/milk. Very easy drinking due to the light body as well. Wish it were just a little heavier but I'm nitpicking. Tasty treat."

"I reviewed 2 beers today and both were sub par. Not great! Terrapin is a terrific brewing company but I really did not like this beer. I had to drain pour a small growler. Maybe my glass was dirty , maybe not. I have a rule to always try a beer twice before complete avoidance. Therefore I will try it again."
"Super disappointing. Was very excited. Great flavor, but ever so thin for a stout. Theres just no body at all to support the flavor"
""
""
""
"Not bad. Lots of good smells, but lacking in taste. If they could get the flavor up with aroma, this would be highly rated."
"This is medium bodied, smooth feeling with a low level of carbonation. This brew sounds amazing on paper but was a real let down in the glass. I was hoping this would be a reiteration of depth charge...not even close."

"Much better than the White Chocolate Moo Hoo. This has the nice chocolate notes of the regular Moo Hoo, with the added dimension of fresh espresso. Very nice, hope they decide to make this one again."

"Pours black under a solid creamy tan head that sticks to the glass in wispy sheets.  Smells chocolate-forward along with a good amount of coffee beans.  Marshmallows, malted milk balls, and nuts.  Nice mocha flavor with plenty of deep coffee bean roast and less chocolate than the aroma.  Chocolate, nuts, and lactose sweetness that never gets cloying, finishing with some lingering berries.  Feels a little better than medium, fluffy in texture, drying out in the end.  Very nice.  A quality blend of fresh dark coffee and chocolate syrup."
"this is an epic beer, but all of the moo hoo ones are. i think the coffee here makes a big difference, adding an earthy complexion and a richness to this that just inst there in the base beer, as good as it is. dense and dark, the milk sugar is anything but subtle, bringing body and a lasting finish, making the coffee last longer than it ever does, so fun, so solid. dense in feel, fuller bodied but never heavy, hard to do, but brought to beauty here. coffee cream is the dominant flavor, cocoa in the background, enough bitterness, and while some of the special barrel variants of this have blown my head off, i love this, and could drink it almost infinitely, which is uncommon for me in beer this robustly flavored and dark. terrapin is legendary already, but tweaks to classics like this make them immortal"
"Average. Not very different from original."

"Smells amazing but taste falls flat. Thin and watery. Enjoyed regular moo-Hoo more"

"22 oz. bottle from a Sat., 12/20/2014 Better Beer Authority Bottle Share (thanks, Richard H..), 2014 vintage, poured into a *** 2014 ""Holiday Extravaganza"" snifter glass, drank over 15 minutes"
""
"Opaque deep deep brown topped with a decent sized 1/2"" brown head. Aroma is rich milky chocolate with caramel and smooth coffee goodness. Some soft berry scents and some vanilla as well. Very pleasant sniffing. Taste is sweet, not overly so, with cocoa, milk and coffee, toffee, nutty flavors, and more and more chocolate with every sip. Just one big delicious chocolate forward treat. Mouthfeel is like whipped cocoa frosting. Overall a very likable, flavor-packed chocolatey treat."

"Coffee beans, coffee and coffee with cream. Great espresso flavor and bitterness. This is light and flavorful at the same time. It's good."
""
"For me this is another so-what beer from Terrapin. It is mediocre in pretty much every way. Cant recommend at all and its hard to believe the good ratings this garnered. And it was overpriced and a pain to track down to boot. I would pass on this and any variations on the milk stout from this brewer."

"O: Nice coffee infused milk stout.  Glad I got to try a bottle, but nothing crazy outstanding."
"Pours dark with off-white head. Aroma of of espresso, chocolate, and malts. Tastes of milk chocolate, coffee, and malts. Absolutely perfect on a cold and rainy day. This beer could be served at a coffee shop. Very delicious."

"Overall - The coffee masks most of the lactose, which I like, but it's still got a kick in the finish."

"Black body with a thick beige collar. Ample lacing. Huge chocolate aroma, milk chocolate candy, a touch of vanilla. Mild chat and roast character. Slight sweet, balance by bitter baker's chocolate and cocoa powder. Coffee beans emerge mid palate, adding another layer. Milky, creamy feel. Nicely done."

"O - Overall, very good milk stout.  Fairly complex and intensely flavored, coffee and chocolate really shine.  Amp up the body a bit and this one would really stand out for me.  I have enjoyed most of the Terrapin limited releases lately and this is no exception - actually probably towards the top of the list for me."

"Overall:  Every now and again, Terrapin produces a beer that makes me think the initial promise I had hoped for this brewery might in fact be realized; this is one of those beers"

"O- After being severely underwhelmed by the Imperial Pumpkin Porter, this is a fantastic beer that turned this entire series around for me.  I highly recommend you get you some o' dis!"

"Overall I was thrilled to catch this on draft at Fathead's and I figured why not when I saw it at D'z six pack yesterday at a reasonable price...around 12 bucks to go!"
""
""
"O: The milk stout style isn't terribly compelling, but this is an interesting take on it. Worth a shot."

"You may kinda miss it when you finish one bottle. But it still tastes like a cold strong coffee with no milk with a little hint of dark chocolate. I found it expensive though."
""
""
""

"Mouthfeel: Medium body and sweet finish."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This brew is worth a shot. Its not adventurous yet pretty solid. There is no offensive off-flavors, just wanted a bit more sweet chocolate than just a cup of coffee with carbonation. Just my pet-peeves going wild again. I wouldn't drink this again, but glad I had the chance to try it. It's well crafted just not all what I thought it was going to be. I say, try it. See if its to your liking. This brew is worth a shot."

"As you might have guessed, Moo-HooChiato is MooHoo with coffee. No frills, this is exactly what it says it is- a chocolate milk stout with espresso. Quite tasty, though a bit over priced."

"Like Terrapin Depth Charge v2.0! Get it, get it, get it!"
