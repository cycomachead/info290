I'd say the barrel flavors aren't integrated with the base beer, so that it tasted more like a milk stout with an ounce or two of bourbon thrown in. Consequently, the bourbon overwhelms all the sweet, creamy cocoa and vanilla flavors that I suspect are present in Mad Cow. As this is my third disappointing BA beer from Rev., I'll be passing on all such future releases from them. Except, of course, Straight Jacket.","blankenhoney","Feb 06, 2015"

Smell is big bourbon; fermented bananas and dark fruit, vanilla, oak, sweetness, and some dark sweet chocolate malt, and coffee. Taste is sweet chocolate, bourbon, slightly boozy dark fruit, burnt sugar and slight bitter coffee. Very sweet, but balanced with a perfect dash of chocolate/coffee bitterness and very slight alcohol heat (especially for 9.5%). Mouthfeel is creamy-smooth and pretty full. This is the second best BA stout I've had, beat only by BCBS so far. Awesome.","BurgeoningBrewhead","Aug 06, 2013"

There is a moderate retention and lacing. The aroma on this beer is huge, it screams bourbon, it's sweet and boozy and strangely addictive. The taste of the beer follows the nose, lots of bourbon, chocolate and vanilla with a boozy wooden flavor in the finish. The mouthfeel is pretty slick, lightly carbonated and finishes with some ethanol heat.

I like the bourbon-into-sugar development in the taste, but ultimately the bourbon is a bit much. I guess I like my milk stouts sweet? Creamy, rich mouthfeel--I was happy to drink my snifter but probably would not want another.","lstokes","Dec 01, 2011"

3.83,-7.7,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours near black with a thin mocha head that persists for a bit before falling to a thin cap. The nose brings a very strong bourbon presence. A bit heavy on that and the booze right now, though it is nice. I think this will develop well, it just needs a bit more time. The taste adds a bit more complexity with a bit of roasted malt and some chocolate. A bit of sweetness counteracts the boozy nature of the beer. A bit too much alcohol in the feel, but is nice and rich. Drinks pretty well overall. Wish I had a bottle or two to age for a bit.","Thorpe429","Dec 20, 2010"
