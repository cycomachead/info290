A mild sweetness runs throughout with some chocolate that lingers well into the aftertaste. The roast is mild and is moderated by a pinch of caramel. There is a little oatmeal body feel on your tongue but overall the body is little thin.","pat61","Feb 01, 2015"

2.64,-30.7,3.25,3.5,2.75,1,2,"First bottle to a tulip glass. Even though the pour was moderately aggressive, no head at all, just a tan ring. No visible carbonation. Second bottle to a pilsener glass, very aggressive pour, to better cause a head and view any carbonation. 2nd time, a 1 inch tan head, bubbly, dissipates relatively quickly with lacing. Carbonation is virtually nonexistant; an occasional bubble is visible rising up, and I have to hold it to the light to see that. After a few minutes, no visible carbonation at all. Dark brown to black color. Very nice roasted aroma. Taste follows the aroma, dominated by roasted malts, transitioning to sweetness and a touch of bitterness. Aftertaste is sweet and only slightly bitter. Body is a bit thin and flat. Very flat. Overall, this is a very blah beer. Not very good at all. It is not drain-pour bad, but there is nothing special at all in this beer and the lack of mouth feel makes it really a struggle to try to enjoy. Given the reviews, I expected a lot more. I gave this beer 2 full bottles before writing this review.  While the 2nd made perhaps a slightly better impression than the first, this does rank as the worst stout/porter I've had to date, admittedly not a huge sample population, but I definitely won't be buying this one again.","MNAle","Dec 28, 2014"

4,5,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall I thought this was a good beer and a pretty good and true example of the style, it had everything that I look for in this style and I would put it just about on the same level as Left Hands Milk Stout. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, creamy, and the flavors did a good job at holding my attention, I think I could drink a few of these without getting bored with it. What I liked the most about this beer was how true to style it was, this pretty much the definition of a Milk Stout. What I like the least about this beer was nothing, there isn't anything that I would change. I would for sure buy this again and keep some around in the fridge and I would like to try it on Nitro. I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes the style. All in all I was happy with this beer and I thought it had no weak points. This made for a good first impression for the Brau Brother's and I'll have to be on the look out for more of their beers, good job guys.","StoutHunter","0"

4,5,4,4,4,4,4,"a really drinkable stout, combining the best elements of a milk stout and an oatmeal stout. the pour is the darkest brown, with no light able to pass through, and a few fingers of off white bubbles that slowly fade to a thin film. the nose is definitely sweet from the lactose sugars, but also bitter from the dark roasted malts. I pick up a little vanilla and a touch of dark chocolate too. the flavor roasted barley heavy, dark and bitter without as much sweetness as the nose suggests until the very end. this is a hearty warming cold weather beer, with a velvety smooth texture from the oatmeal and a fuller soft body. there is a little chocolate flavor in the finish, enough to counteract the bitterness. an elegant stout that would be extremely well suited t the nitro tap. my first beer from brau brothers, looking forward to my next. this is very well done.","StonedTrippin","Beers"

The smell of the beer is a little on the strange side... not really appealing to me, there are some subtle chocolate and roasted aromas but there is something else in there I'm not really caring for. The taste of the beer is a little harsh and burnt right away but as the beer warms up it becomes a little more chocolaty and creamy. The mouthfeel is lighter than I expected, decent carbonation also. Overall this beer was ok, but not something I need to have again. Glad I got to have it though.","Knapp85","Feb 18, 2013"

There are some really nice things going on in this beer; the undertones of coffee, chocolate, dark fruit esters, and even the oats and lactose but, these things are all overshadowed too greatly to elevate the beer to something really enjoyable.

The head is mocha in color, very big and looks like you could bounce a quarter off of it. The nose is rather subdued, bits of burnt chocolate are all that is discernable. The taste has a bit more to it, although the burnt chocolate does take center stage; not as sweet as some oatmeal milk stouts I've had before nor as creamy. Mouthfeel is medium in body and pretty flat for a oatmeal milk stout. Overall, not a bad tasting beer but not impressive either.","gmfessen","Aug 04, 2012"

Pours clear fairly pitch black color with a 1 finger fairly dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Some decent spotty lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of dark chocolate, roasted malt, milk, cream, toast, oats, and light coffee. Pretty nice aromas with good strength and balance. I can honestly say this is the first stout I have had that has a true milk aroma component. Taste of chocolate, roasted malt, cream, toast, oats, caramel, and light coffee. Slight roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, roasted malt, cream, and oats on the finish for a short bit. Quite dry on the finish. Good balance of flavors, but it is a bit on the bland side of things as far as robustness. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a fairly creamy and slick mouthfeel as expected. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a very slight warming after the finish. Overall this is a good milk stout. A little bland, but has nice balanced flavors; and is certainly enjoyable.","superspak","Jun 26, 2012"

Excellent! 4.5 T: Taste is a lot like the nose. Lactose, chocolate, and coffee flavors do the trick again. Oats, a light roastiness, and grainy malts add complexity. Really nice again. 4.5 M: Medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Reasonably creamy and insanely smooth. 5.0 D: The taste could have easily been a five.

3.98,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"D/O: Despite the seeming mass appeal of stouts among those with a taste for artisanal beer styles, the bottled non-imperial variety may be an endangered species. This oatmeal and milk sugar hybrid is a real winner, with full and interesting qualities that are packed into a a fairly small package at sub-6% abv. The smell reminds of a dairy product that has been left out a bit too long, yet it works. The finish is particularly compelling, with a satisfyingly intense host of dark qualities that will lodge in the memory and hopefully grow into a favorable reputation for the brewer.","beagle75","Jul 30, 2011"

4.69,23.1,3.5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"Saw this a few days ago for only $7.99/sixer and decided to give it a shot considering this one of my favorite styles of beer and it's locally made. I did have reservations though since I've been less than impressed with most offerings from this brewery. That being said.... Pours a dark brown color, almost completely black in the glass, and despite a hard pour it produced little head, with no lacing. This was the only part of this beer that was less than amazing! Full, luxurious aroma of chocolate, cream, light coffee, and sweetness with no alcohol coming through. Smells heavenly, and the chocolate and lactose really dominate the aroma, which I really love. Taste is a home run! Creamy milk chocolate up front, a touch of graham cracker, a hint of espresso, and just enough enough charred malts to make this interesting. It's sweet but not cloyingly so, just a perfect amount of balance between the sweetness/toffee/chocolate and the roast that really make this stand out. There is a slight twang from the lactose in the middle, but is then washed away by a semi-dry chocolaty finish. I have to say that this is EXACTLY what I look for in a milk stout. Nothing stands out too much away from the rest, everything is perfectly balanced, and it's incredibly drinkable. Mouthfeel is creamy and silky smooth, probably from the toasted and rolled oats used in the mash. Carbonation is a bit low, but that only serves to reinforce the slick mouthfeel. Damn, this beer is WINNING! I can hardly believe this has come out of Brau Borthers, a very much underwhelming brewery for me, and I imagine this is a sign of good things to come from this brewer. If this truly is a new year round beer, I can see myself buying at least a couple sixers a month. Great, great stuff here.","KeefD","Apr 11, 2011"

The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation, and a silky texture. Overall, this is a really good beer. I really like the way it straddles between two styles.
