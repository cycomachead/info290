"FEEL: Fits the profile for a stout. Full-bodied; heavy and a little oily."

"The only reason i didn't give this 5 all across was that I had already been drinking before i tried it and maybe my senses were skewed. That being said this is one of the best beers I've ever tasted. Very balanced and complex. Great flavor and mouthfeel. I would do bad things to try this again."

"This is a wonderful Mocha Stout.  The smell of roasted malts, chocolate and spices makes your mouth water.  The flavor was even better than the aroma.  The taste of deeply roasted malts and a combination of coca, spices and the balance of sweetness and tart, put a wonderful spin on the Mocha Stout.  I'm on my way out to buy more before they run out!"
""
"Sat on it a little too long perhaps, but still very good - beautiful black/brown color with excellent mouth-feel & taste - subtle hints of smoke, coffee, chocolate & spices - looking forward to trying it again (hoping the brew again)."
""
""
"Drinkability – A very interesting and unusual stout that I enjoyed."
"From bottle to cold glass. Pours a dark reddish brown with creamy head. Complex aromas of chocolate, spices and coffee. Feels much lighter than many other stouts.  The flavors are diverse, with the most noticeable being the slightly bitter coffee rounded out by the sweat and creamy chocolate. Notes of spices remind me of drinking Mexican hot chocolate. Overall a fantastic beer with lots of flavors that balance beautifully. One of Stone's best."
""
"Very impressed with this beer's cooperation. Ingenious blend of chocolate and spices that creates a well-balanced taste. If you like this, you might want to also check out Clown Shoes' Chocolate Sombrero."
""
"O: Tasty and very complex, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a solid flavorful beer to drink for a while if you want something different."
""
""
""
"O-  The first time I had this, I was expecting a normal mocha stout, not a mocha stout with Mexican chocolate!  This is a lot better knowing what to expect going in!"
"Poured from 22 Oz into snifter. Quite a nice find for my little western PA bottle shop. Midnight black with little to no head. Some slick, transient lacing. A beauty. Lots of pepper/green pepper on the nose, with some nice cinnamon, nutmeg, coffee, dark chocolate, cocoa... ridiculous. If they said it was there, it was. The spices were prominent in the taste, an overarching pepper note (sans heat), and some nice chocolate. Velvety mouthfeel, with some of those lovely, lingering spices. Delicious. The reason that I love craft, and a terrific homebrew inspiration."
"A little light but very nice coffee notes.  A LOT of great Coffe stouts out there and this is a damn good one for sure!"
"Dark brown body, 2 finger head with minimal lacing. Aroma of peppers and cinnamon leaps out. Flavor has peppers with even bit of heat and lots of cocoa. Body is thin though and affects drinkability a bit but overall i still enjoyed this."
""
""
""
"made for a perfect Christmas eve, had it with some tres leches cake and let me tell you that was the best beer pairing with food ever! Get one if they aren't all gone."
""
""
"Best beer of 2014 and it's a collaboration... :("
""
""
""
""
"First beer with peppers. I liked that it wasnt spicy and that the peppers added flavor. Little thin. Not a bad beer. Better than expected. Nose was full of peppers but not spicy or overwhelming. Smooth finish as well."
"Overall, a world class chocolate stout."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is slick, a little buttery. Overall, pretty good."
""
"22oz bottle served in a tulip.  Pours the color and clarity of cola with a loose, 1/8th inch, khaki-colored head embedded with tiny ringlets that quickly disperses into a broken sudsy skim.  Some small spots and swaths of lacing are revealed during the tasting.  Nose expresses cocoa, cinnamon, nutmeg and just a hint of chili pepper.  Taste follows nose with  a hint of oxidation and more baker's chocolate than cocoa.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an assertive carbonation that, coupled with the chili peppers, leaves a mild, residual burn at the back of the throat.  Overall, a decent beer but I don't understand the hype on this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark with a very small head. Smell has lots going on. I get some dark fruits, sweet chocolate, maybe some cinnamon. Taste is pretty complex. It leans towards sweetness. You can pick up the chili without being spicy. Also the cinnamon. Lots going on here. It is a good beer overall."
""
""
""
"O - a pleasent experience for an IPA fan. this stout would be purchased again if seen"
""
""
""
""
""
"It has been over a month since I tried this beer, yet I still find myself thinking about it regularly. Creepy, right?!?! This beer was such a pleasant surprise. The combination of ingredients made this a truly special/one-of-a-kind experience. I really hope they release this again!!!"
""
""
"The cinnamon gave it a nice sweetness, while the peppers balanced that with a nice level of heat. Very well made."
""
"O: Personally I dislike sweet beer that doesn´t taste like beer. This one is exactly that. My wife loved it and she hates beer so... yeah."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Lots of warm cinnamon and chocolate / mocha, pretty sweet but still has a nice edge, very easy & comfortable stout"
""
""
""
"Very pleasant balance of bittersweet chocolate stout, coffee and green chilies. Nice aroma of chili as well. Noted as a milk stout, but I found the usual sweetness of such to be lacking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is like a Mexican mocha lots of chocolate not to bitter. Warmth and sweetness from the spices. I hope they bring this beer back. It is my favorite stone beer. I found a stash of this in Morro Bay and bought all the bottles they had. As it is impossible to find this in San diego. If you find it buy it drink it then trade some bottles and save it. It is a powerful beer currency."
""
""
""
"A crazy-strong smelling beer with loads of spices and sweetness. Cookie dough-esque."
""
""
"Loved the cinnamon kick to this one.  I wonder what this on Nitro would taste like...."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark black in color with only the faintest hint of light seeping partially through.  A fingernail of dark brown covers the rim and about two thirds of the top.  Dazzling aroma of coffee,chili peppers,and chocolate.  The flavor is packed with coffee,chocolate,cinnamon,and just a hint of chili and vanilla prior to the fade. The mouth is a bit oily and chewy with a faint bit of heat at the back of the palate."
""
"This beer is a great idea, but needs some fine tuning. Would buy again due to the relative cheapness of a bomber, but it's not world class for me."
"Well worth experiencing!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is an absolutely delightful beer.  SO…MUCH…cinnamon!!  This is true across both the aroma and the flavoring, where it meets, as it does so well, with a white sugar sweetness.  This makes the beer very, very “cinnamon-sugar”.  Otherwise, the quality of the beer is outstanding.  Each advertised flavor is so perfectly represented, with nothing seeming to cheap out, and nothing seeming synthetic or false.  All of this makes the beer disappear so quickly.  In the parts where we purchased this, there was a widespread one-bottle minimum, so we had to split our efforts.  We ended up getting only one bottle on that first day of the release here locally, but as soon as we could, picked up a second, once that wave came through.  Now, after tasting it, we are infinitely glad we did, but simultaneously kind of sad that we didn’t get any other bottles.  Alas, oh well, but perhaps stone will re-release this one as an ultra-anniversary beer, and it will once again humble us in its presence."

"I was surprised by this one, but stone never really disappoints. Very tasty Mocha coffee flavor."
"O - 5 - A one-of-a-kind, unique stout experience. I wish so bad this could be aged as, I would LOVE to stock up on this. I could drink this stout just about every single day and never tire of it. Been sipping my glass for an hour now as well as while I write this review. Dreading finishing this beer. If you are a fan of porters or stouts, this will be an adventurous, tasty and unique change of pace to the style. Absolutely phenomenal!"
"A good fill in for better beers, but never really replaces them."
""
""
""
""
""
"The cinnamon and nutmeg were just too much for me. This is  solid stout and I certainly appreciate trying something different but this was a miss for me."
"O: tasty. It grows on you"
""
""
""
"A very good beer I enjoyed thoroughly. It seemed all the flavors worked well together."
""
""
"Delicious combination of spices and chocolate. Complex flavor that leaves you needing more, if only to discern each layer. Attempts to imitate Mexican hot chocolate are almost spot on, a great winter treat!"
""
"Right on the mark! This beer is one of my new favorites."
""
""
""
" On the light side of medium bodied for a Stout, with moderate carbonation. Has a cocoa and peppers aftertaste. I'm glad I had a chance to try this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, decent brew, but not what I was hoping for based on the description."
""
""
"This beer was a cinnamony mess of a stout"
""
""
"Pours a deep black with tons of sandy-tan head that held pretty well and faded into decent lacing, good wisps and a medium collar.  Aroma is chocolatey, a grainy medium malt, lots of nutmeg and cinnamon, a hint of indistinct earthy spice (peppers/chilis).  Taste is bitter coffee up front, nutmeg and vanilla playing well together, and a malty sweetness.  Nice warmth from the peppers, kinda high carbonation for a stout and definitely thin in the body.  Good beer, but lacks in too many ways to be great."
""
""
""
""
""
"Honestly, there is no shortage of praise that can (and should) be rained down on all parties responsible for this exceptional and, so far as I'm concerned, unparallelled stout. The level of flavour and drinkability achieved is indeed deity-worthy - I can only pray Stone has the good sense to make this one a regular (or at least seasonal) release. Truly unbelievable stuff."
""
"Overall: There's a lot of favors and aroma going on and the brewer has done an amazing job of balancing all the flavors. Ultimately, I really didn't like the pepper so I won't drink this again but I'm glad I tried it and if you like pepper flavor in your beer you will probably like this."

"Similar in style to Prairie BOMB, less spicy. Tasty brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Perfect. Unique like no other."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is, without a doubt, one of the best beers I have ever had in my life. I am not a fan of Stone, I think they over-hop everything, but I can honestly say without reservation that they have produced one of the most magnificent beers I have ever drank. If you can find it anymore, you need to buy it and drink it, regardless of price. Its that good. A total game-changer, I would highly recommend they run it as a seasonal beer or even a production beer!"

"I actually taste every element  they say is  in the beer on the front of the bottle. Amazingly well balanced beer. My only negative would be that the mouthfeel is a bit thin."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: This was a nice spiced stout. The scent made me think it would be really hot, but the taste was nicely balanced. The body was good, and the finish was smooth, so it was easy to drink. One of the better Stone collaborations."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tons of vanilla and cinnamon and nutmeg in the smell and taste. Pepper is noticable in my esophagus long after swallowing. Would be perfect if the coffee stood out a little more and had a fuller body, and a creamier mouthfeel. This bottle is 4 months old, so the  coffee may have faded slightly. Excellent beer overall!"

"Good head leaves a moderate lace.  Nose is coffee with vanilla and cinnamon notes, slight cherry.  Finish has a slight pepper bite but cinnamon lingers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice color, nice nose.  Creamy malt and stout.  Just too much other craziness going on for my tastes.  it does balance out surprisingly, but the cinammon with the spice with the vanilla is just a lot to cope with.  I want it to be a little less biting"

"I feel like I got the session coffee milk stout in my bomber instead of what everybody is raving about.  All I got was lactose and weak coffee.  Let it warm to room temp as I tasted it and still didn't get anything.  On paper, this was a winner."
""
""
""
"Great flavor complexity! Wish I could find this beer more often in NC."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great beer excellent mouth feel love the cinnamon and while not a huge fan of peppers in beer it absolutely works in this excellent offering from stone."
""
"O: I've been looking forward to cracking this one and it didn't disappoint. Fantastic brew."
""
"Sweet, solid, but nothing I got particularly excited by.  A very nice sweet stout, but that is about it really..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the nicest beers I've ever had. More of this NEEDS to be brewed. A little sweet, a little spicy, a little heat. Rich mouthfeel while being extremely drinkable."
""
""
""
"Overall kudos to Chris Banker for coming up with this innovative recipe!  The flavor layering can't get much better than this.  Cheers to Chris!"
"I thought this beer was too sweet for my taste. I did not get any of the heat from the peppers. All I got was the sweet spices that were in the beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  Easily one of the best beers I've had in a long time.  Great flavors and fantastic complexity.  Stone makes some great beers and this one is worthy of the origin."
"Pours a four finger light head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Black color, mahogany highlights. Medium carbonation and medium bodied.  Coffee, chocolate and pepper nose. Flavor is same, chocolate with chile pepper and baked chocolate. Pricey at $8.49 for a 22oz bottle from Big Deal Irving Spofford, NH."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is really good.  Nice heavy medium feel yet a long lingering flavor.  Well carbonated without being too strong.  A real flavor explosion going on here, but with such a strong flavor it  maintains some smoothness while going to a dry earthiness then ends with a dry finish then some heat lingering afterwards from the peppers.  Nice drinkable beer.  At 8.1% and all that flavor it's still really a beer any stout lover could handle easily.  Another great Stone collaboration.  If this were brewed again I'd definitely get it.  A rare treat."

"Pours pretty black, some caramel highlights at the bottom of the glass.  The head is short, but nicely creamy, dropping to a bubbly band and patchy film.  Big, deep, spicy aromas waft out of the glass...cocoa, vanilla bean, cinnamon, nutmeg, dark coffee beans, nuts, chili peppers - pretty much exactly as advertised and well executed.  Flavor opens with a smooth blend of dark cocoa, cinnamon, and nutmeg followed by vanilla and a pleasant fruitiness.  Not particularly spicy, but the chili flavor is there in a supporting role.  This beer is really more about the spices and malty mocha flavors than the heat.  Chocolate pudding, whipped cream, and berries.  Medium-full bodied and sort of fluffy, drying out completely and not allowing it to get too sweet.  Nicely done."
"M: Extra smooth, melted chocolate, and not too sticky. Soft, almost heavy, and in general whipped up."

"Bottle from trade and shared with the wife. Pours dark brown from the bottle and settles nearly black in the glass with a two finger khaki brown head. Honestly looked on the thin side as it poured. Aroma is big on the chili peppers, cinnamon and nutmeg, with hints of chocolate and vanilla in the background. Don't get a lot of roast or sweetness in the nose though. Flavor is a different story with lots of cinnamon and chocolate, kick of peppers, a hint of vanilla, and lingering nutmeg. Too much vegetal pepper and some metallic notes. Not spicy really, just vegetal flavored. Medium plus bodied, smooth, with medium plus carbonation. As expected from the look, this is on the thinner side for the style. Needs that big sweet depth to stand up to the spices, but is lacking that. Overall this isn't a poor beer, but it's pretty disappointing after having Mexican Cake, Hunahpu, Abraxas, Bomb, and barrel aged variants of all of those. This one really isn't close."

"Overall I liked this a lot...I thought it has an amazing nose, with a ton going on. The taste is lighter and not as complex as the nose, and I wish the body was a bit thicker, but it is very good. Worth buying for sure, glad to see this sitting on the shelf."
""
""
""
""
"Do you really need 3 different people/brewers to create this? This stuff is horrible!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Way too much pepper flavor and the mouthfeel was very thin"
""
"Low B-"
"good strong coffee taste but could use some creamer for my taste it was too bitter for a finish."
"O: This fulfilled its role as a chile stout without wielding the chiles like a club. Would repeat."

"Yes, this was strong but the alcohol could only be felt and not tasted. The transition from fall into winter involves the Marzens and Pumpkin Ales giving way to Stouts and Porters and if any beer could bridge that divide, this would certainly be it. The spice reminded me of a Pumpkin Ale without the burn while the body of this beer was clearly a Milk/Sweet Stout that wasn't jacked up on lactose and sugar. If you love beer, get this. It's not the best Stout out there and probably the best seasonal currently on the shelf but it's damn close to being either of those and the most unique brew that you could grab before the winter firmly sets in. A wonderful mesh of flavors could be found here as this easily deserves to be added to Stone's full-time rotation. A subtly fabulous brew that pushes the boundary of what's possible while tasting as familiar as the recurring seasonals that don't quite measure up to this."

"Incredible. Very surprised by this one. Amazing taste and great mouth feel. I didnt like mexican cake, but this really takes it!"
""
""
""
"A bit thinner and bubblier than expected.  Definitely better flavor as it approaches room temperature."
""
""
""
""

"Too much cinnamon and nutmeg for my taste"

"The spice was weak for me. Just a whiff of nutmeg in the aroma and a splash of generic spice in the  taste. I didn't really catch the cinnamon. Still,  it was a very good beer. Not too dry, not too bitter. Well round and full of flavor."
""
""
""
"Here's a stout for the sweet tooth, one that can appeal to beer geeks and casual beer drinkers. The beer smells like a spiced chocolate dessert, and the flavor is sweet with note of coffee chocolate, and cinnamon. A sliver of a rubbing alcohol note remains the only fatal flaw that this beer delivers, otherwise forget about going to Coldstone and open a bottle of Xocoveza."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark brown, thin head maintains with moderate lacing down the glass. Cinnamon overwhelms the scent. Hint of herbal, green pepper. But the cinnamon makes the smell a little unpleasant. Cinnamon carries through in the taste, though chocolate and smokey chile nicely round out the flavor. Mouthfeel is dense and smooth. Enough carbonation to keep the flavors from becoming muddled. Interesting beer, glad I was able to try it. Probably not something where I'll crave another though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Alright, so I lost a lot of interest in stouts lately. Unless it's barrel aged I'll usually avoid it. Glad I took a chance on this one. It's complex, sweet, bitter, and everything in between. This beer is extremely well-made and I'd definitely have another!"

"O: excellent twist on a milk stout"
""
""

"Tons going on here with spices and coffee and pepper. Flavorful without overwhelming. Pepper warmth without getting spicy. Interesting fruit and cola undertones, too. Sweet and earthy with quite the bitter finish. Gentle carbonation. Yeah, I'm sure a bigger body wouldn't hurt, but damn, this is good as is."

"Overall: This is a magnificent collaboration beer from Stone, Cervezeria Insurgente, and Chris Banker. A tip of the cap to Stone for spotlighting a homebrewer's recipe. This is a great brew, and unlike other spiced stouts and porters I've had. Very cool."

"O: 4.25 Stone has done an excellent job here. There are a lot of really good flavors going on and despite not being the most balanced beer, it seems to work well. Also, the addition of lactose makes this an interesting variation in the world of stouts with coffee, spices, etc."
"There was just something really wrong with this beer. Something tastes off to me. Like medicine. Maybe I got a bad batch, or maybe my class had soap or something in it, but I can't imagine this is the same beer everyone else has been raving over. Could it all be hype?"

"Great layers of spice, malts, and vanilla!"

"Pours a solid black color with a solid two finger frothy tan head that shows great retention. Aromas of coffee, caramel, and chocolate dominate with the spicy peppers poking through a bit especially as this warms. The nutmeg and cinnamon are subtle but again poke out a bit more as my sample warms. Great Aroma! Rich chocolate and vanilla hit my palette in spades. Coffee and pepper sweep in to cleanse the sweet maltiness. Milk chocolate with spices linger with a sweetness long after the end of every sip. Medium to thick body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a creamy silky velvety mouthfeel. Damn there's a lot going on in this beer! Creamy rich flavorful brew, so glad I was able to find some of this!"

"A well done stout, the peppers and spices are a very tasty addition."
"I don’t know what a Mexican hot chocolate tastes or smells like, so while I respect the brewing expertise and clever ingenuity used to make this beer I sadly must admit that I didn’t really care for it. It was good but not my thing."
""
"Overall I thought this was a good beer and a good example of the style, I found this to be pretty close to Oddsides Mayan Mocha Stout and it had pretty much all the aspects that I look for in the style.  This beer had nice drinkability, it was fairly smooth, crisp, slightly creamy, a little dry on the finish, a little filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I think one bottle is the perfect amount for me.  What I like the most about this beer was the aroma, it was very good and to me it was the highlight of this beer.  What I liked the least about this beer was the higher level of bitterness, I wouldn't mind less bitterness with just a little more sweetness, I would buy this beer again and I would recommend it to anyone who likes spiced Stouts.  All in all I was happy with this beer and just a little impressed, stone can be pretty hit or miss for me, but this one was pretty close to being a hit.  It's not my favorite stone beer and it's up there with one of my favorites of the style.  Good job guys, this was a tasty beer, keep up the good and creative work."
""
""
"An enjoyable stout, and one where the added flavours don't overwhelm the beer. I would happily endure in this beer again, though I'll admit I may soon forget it as memorable,"

"Pours a dark blackish brown color with a light tan head.  The aroma is sweet, roasted and chocolatey.  The flavor follows suit with cocoa and coffee notes giving away to a spicy cinnamon aftertaste reminding me of cinnamon mocha coffee.  Alcohol is well disguised by all the flavors.  Full bodied, well carbonated ale that is a bit chewy.  Overall, this is a unique, fresh take on a coffee stout I can recommend this."
""
""
"This one sold out quick, and you are bummed if you missed out!"
""

"Quite impressive given the ingredients, and great in it's own right."

"O - This a very nice sweet stout. The flavors really do well to mimic Mexican hot chocolate. Very rich and Definetly worth trying."
""
""
"On tap at Trumbull Kitchen in Hartford. Absolutely delicious. One of the most complex beers I've ever had. Taste and nose of Cinnamon, Coffee, Chocolate and Nutmeg. Just a brilliant beer."

"This is an assertive stout with notes of dark, bitter chocolate and a noticeable bite on the back end from the chiles. I love spicy food and hoppy beers, and this stout really hit the sweet spot. If you're looking for a nice, smooth milk stout, you're really not going to like this one, but I thought it was fantastic."

"Poured from bomber into glasses and shared with a friend.  A black beer with minimal tan head - looks like a pretty typical stout.  Aroma is of spices - cinnamon, nutmeg, some pepper.  This was my first spiced stout, so to me the taste was really unique.  Very much like a Mexican chocolate - milk chocolate with cinnamon and nutmeg, but with the added complexity of vanilla and peppers.  Nothing over the top... this has very well balanced flavors.  Mouthfeel is really nice, not super heavy or syrupy.  Goes down smooth and doesn't need to be sipped.  Overall, this is a really great beer.  Kudos to Chris Banker and Stone on this one."

"750ml bottle. Pours midnight black.  Little to no creamy head.  Smells of cinnamon, chocolate, coffee and a spicy pepper like cumin or chili.  Thick and creamy in the mouth.  Taste ask the above with just a hint of spicy pepper.  Very enjoyable.  Goes down smooth. Not a really high ABV so nothing to mask or hide.  Finished clean with after taste of coffee and chocolate.  Like it very much.  Could drink several and not whine."

"O). Well done Stone.  The balance is just stunning to me"
"Overall very nice, quite tasty with a nice spice character that doesn't overpower the beer and actually blends nicely with the other flavors. Vanilla, cocoa, coffee and dark malts all blend nicely as well as the cinnamon, pepper, and mild nutmeg all come together nicely and even blend well with the other flavors. Booze is hidden fairly well behind the flavors and heat from the pepper and cinnamon. Quite enjoyable."
""
"Verdict: A definite success from Stone, Banker and Insurgente, I just really wish that the body was richer and silkier, less carbonation and a bigger feel would take this beer a long way. The balance of flavors and the showcase of the adjuncts is great, quite a bit of depth as well, I love how the spices are the forefront rather than the pepper, but it just needs that extra bit of body to carry it to true greatness."

"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 8/29/2014. Pours fairly pitch black color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, cinnamon, vanilla, cream, chile pepper, nuttiness, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, and herbal/spice earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt and lactose/spice notes; with good strength. Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, cinnamon, vanilla, cream, chile pepper, nuttiness, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, and herbal/spice earthiness. Light roast/spice bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, cinnamon, vanilla, cream, nuttiness, chile pepper, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, and herbal/spice earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic robustness and complexity of dark/roasted malt and lactose/spice flavors; with a pretty much perfect malt/spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly slick/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome spiced milk stout. All around great robustness, complexity, and balance of dark/roasted malt and lactose/spice flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"O: The Mexican hot chocolate concept has been done a few times by now, but Stone and company really nailed it down with this one. Balance is crucial with all the different adjuncts in play, and it really can't be done any more perfectly than this. Even the body and texture mimic the Mexican hot chocolate to a tee. This was a pleasure to drink right down to the last drop."

"Overall - Hmm, not much a fan. The flavors weren't really as cohesive as I would've liked. Too much bitter, astringent coffee character causing too much unbalance. It's getting rave reviews here, but it's got me scratching my head. Not my cup o' tea, I suppose."

"Very dark brown with tan head. Lots of cinnamon and nutmeg early on with chocolate mixed in, and chilies warm at the end. As the beer warms vanilla becomes more present and all the flavors mix very well. The beer is slightly boozy but not overly sweet. Very good beer, I imagine this would be great on a snowy day."

"This beer had impeccable style and balance. The biscuit, sweet, light and dry combined perfectly with the chocolate, and they could not be separated in the tasting. Then the coffee added a something almost smoothing to the flavor.  The cinnamon and nutmeg also combined perfectly so that they could not be separated in the tasting. The pepper did not detract or seem too loud, too hot or too bold but it was colorful.  I found that the flavors in this beer reminded me of festive colors and I thought that was whimsical because the beer is pitch black."
""
""
"Overall this is probably the best stone collaboration beer I have had to date. It is spot on the description and was a joy to drink. Glad I grabbed an extra one, that one will be all mine."
""
"Xocoveza is a delicious beer that's actually quite reasonably priced in a craft beer world full of excessively priced bombers. This reminds me after the debacle that was their Coffee Vanilla Stout (or whatever it's called) that Stone bottles some of the best beer out there."
""
""
""
""
"What’s amazing about Xocoveza is that you can taste all of the flavors individually.  You’ll get the cinnamon, chocolate, and chili up front, but you get the roasty, sweet stout taste on the finish.  This beer could have gone totally wrong, but Stone balanced the long list of ingredients perfectly.  This is my new go-to beer if I am looking for something with added flavors."

"A very dark, lovely black stout with a tan head that settles quickly but holds a small ring. Very clear coffee aroma with spice notes. The taste is a dinner coffee. This is called a mocha stout, they mean it. More coffee than chocolate up front, followed by sweet malts and spice, then a clear vanilla bean in the finish. Smooth mouthfeel which makes sipping difficult - an easy drinker. This could get dangerous on a cold night."
""
""
""
""

"Dark brown black with a nice tan head. This is an exceptionally balanced beer given all the exotic adjuncts. Sweet, but not too sweet. Nicely bitter with great flavors from the spices and coffee. Stone does it again."

"Overall an excellent beer by Stone and collaborators, really loving all the spices in the beer.  Tastes like a spiced hot chocolate."
""
""
"Pours a dark brown almost black color with  a fluffy 3"" head that lasts a long time. Chocolate, coffee, and nutmeg are detectable by the nose. The roasted malt base has a layer of dark chocolate, nutmeg, some hint of cinnamon, and a bit of coffee on top of it. Some pepper arrives late in the taste. Moderate bitterness herer too. Easy to drink beer."

"Poured a deep, rich black body with slight brown highlights when held to light and a one finger tan head. Appearance is quite nice, very well done for a stout. Scents of coffee, dark coffee grounds, roast malt, cocoa and bittersweet chocolate and vegetal, spicy pepper aromas up front. Cinnamon, cream and hints of vanilla and nutmeg mingle in the background. Overall impression of aroma is of a rich coffee stout that has an interesting pepper presence from the chilies and a nice spiciness from the cinnamon and nutmeg. Flavor begins modestly sweet, like sweetened coffee with cream. Balancing this is a vegetal chili flavor with just a touch of heat, not enough to impart but the slightest heat and a bit of a dark coffee flavor and a light cinnamon presence. A bit of chocolate, vanilla and cocoa are discernible in the background, though not heavily. The middle moves into a more dark coffee flavor, with notes of rich semi-sweet chocolate, a slight pepper that takes on a mild burning character and a bit of a cinnamon flavor. Finish is semi-sweet with notes of semi-sweet chocolate, cocoa powder, dark coffee grounds, coffee with cream, vegetal, spicy chili, hints of cinnamon, a light touch of alcohol and a mildly spicy chili and cinnamon swallow. Aftertaste is spicy and dark with notes of cinnamon, chili, cocoa, dark coffee grounds and roast malt. Overall impression of flavor is of a very complex milk stout that has a variety of very good flavors mingling together into a wonderful cohesive whole that has the aimed-for character of traditional hot chocolate. It is rich and deep, spicy, yet semi-sweet and very pleasant. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with light carbonation, a creamy feel and a slight burn from the chili and cinnamon. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a wonderfully rich and full stout with a nice burn from the added ingredients that is warming and pleasant. Overall this is a very good experimental stout. It has a nice milk stout base, that is aided by the addition of chili, cinnamon, cocoa and coffee in both aroma and flavor. Its mouthfeel aids drinkability and is warming and nice. The only downside is the general lack of vanilla and especially nutmeg, two of the ingredients, in the aroma and especially in the flavor. A very good stout nonetheless and well worth trying."

"Overall: Awesome brew. Your mission is to seek and destroy. Grab your favorite beer glass and inhale. Salud!"
"Overall, this is awesome!  I love it and wish I could have this all the time.  It would make an awesome dessert beer but would be good pretty much whenever.  If I could change one thing I would try to make it a little less sweet in the middle but I'm splitting hairs here.  Truly great."
""
""
""
""
"M- nicely medium to thick and coats the palette well.  Not overly carbonated."
"Quite interesting, but not really my cup of tea.  It's almost a ""west coast"" porter in it's bitter strength, which also tends toward acrid to me.   I'd be willing to give this another chance, but unless I was totally mistaken in this tasting, that could be enough for me."
""
""
""
""
"I didn't quite love this one.  After all the hype, I'm a bit disappointed.  Obviously my rating shows that I enjoyed it overall, but it was not world-class in my opinion.  I mostly got coffee in the aroma and in the taste I got coffee and a spicy bit of heat in the background.  Eh?"
"The nose on this is great. Full and robust and a clear and sharp character. Upon first whiff, you just hope that the beer tastes the same. And yes, it is pretty much on that level. Strong mocha with all the spices and accents hitting just right. A bit thin, but not so much that it's detracting. Great beer."
""
"22 ounce bottle, bottled on 08/29/14.  Served in a DFH snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with a half inch tan head.  Both the head retention and lacing are good.  Aroma is nice, the brew smells like coffee, peppers, bittersweet chocolate, cinnamon, and some vanilla.  I think the taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's also some nutmeg and vegetal pepper flavors.  The peppers seem spicer in the aroma, there isn't much pepper heat in the taste of this beer at all.  Maybe I guess I was just expecting it to be spicier.  With that being said, I still think it's a pretty tasty brew!  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating and creamy with a good amount of carbonation.  I liked this a lot, especially the coffee/mocha/chocolate flavor.  Stone and the other collaborators hit a home run with this, hopefully Stone will decide to bring it back at some point.  $9.99 a bomber."

"stunning, simply stunning, to quote my favorite under appreciated academic. this is so cool, and even though it starts a little weird, the more i drink it the more i love it. its appearance is magic, muted black luster, milkshake thick grayish brown head, with a creamy look and a patient feel that just makes me want it more. the nose shows way more chili pepper than expected, and plenty of coffee too, with the bitter roast being way back, and the other additives just highlighting. the grain bill is awesome, full bodied and rich, but dry as heck, which means i can drink a ton of this. long flavor journey here, perfect blend of each component, coffee is earthy, peppers flare up just a bit, vanilla sweetens and unites, cocoa goes earthy again, marrying dark malt and bakers chocolate bitterness. at first it seemed weird, but by the bottom of the bomber im sad there isnt another drop in there. perfect alcohol strength too, cant smell or taste or feel it, but right above 8% abv is where it should be. creamy as anything in feel, so rich and smooth, but being dry too makes it special. one of the best takes on this chili thing. its way smoother than cigar citys, and even more well integrated than perennials. something special here. good on the homebrewer who thought this up, youre a legend mate!"

"I just couldn't figure this one out. It was different to me for sure. It started off chocolate, heat, and of course the nutmeg and cinnamon. It was like a pumpkin stout with no pumpkin. The heat was there but not terrible. To be honest I don't like spicy foods and this was fine. Your mouth gets used to it very quickly and it dissappears into the mix quite nicely. I couldn't tell how much I liked it and then I looked down and it was gone. It would be an occasional sipper not a daily drinker though. Glad I got to try and looking forward to trying others of the style to compare"

"Overall - Wow, this brew is an in-your-face flavor bomb! It's flavors are so individual, yet mingle and integrate nicely. Just to throw a small gripe out there, I'd have liked the spice notes to be a little more subtle. Still, an awesome, unique brew just absolutely chalk full of tasty flavor."

"Poured very dark, almost black, with just a very thin head. Aroma was coffee, cinnamon, slight dark chocolate and peppery.  The taste was big cinnamon, coffe and spice up front, with a nice sweet/hot chocolate and pepper bite in the finish. I was hoping for a little more thickness in the mouth-feel, thought it was a little thin.  Overall , this was an excellant beer."

"Overall, this is the worst Stone beer I've ever had, and I've had my share.  It's also as bad a stout as I can remember, particularly a mocha stout...particularly a milk stout, of which this clearly isn't.  Other than look, this was terrible.  Borderline drain pour."

"22oz bottle with a Bottled On Date of 08/29/14. Pours a black color with an inch of frothy brown head. Lots of lacing. Spicy aroma mixed with a large amount of cinnamon. Light coffee and chocolate with a hint of vanilla. The taste is cinnamon and spice up front followed by some light and sweet coffee. Nutmeg, hot chocolate and vanilla. A very interesting mix of flavors. Finishes with more cinnamon and some very light heat from the chile peppers. I'm surprised the abv is 8.1%. Mouthfeel is maybe a bit light, but it is a Milk Stout so it's no big deal. I'm very impressed by this one. Overall, very well executed brew I will be buying more of."

"Poured from bomber bottle. While cooler, the chocolate and spices hit the nose. As it warms, the peppery notes come out. Kind of a dry, silky smooth texture on the tongue. Kind of like powdered cocoa. The coffee strikes me as subtle. The pepper on the palate comes out as it warms but is not overwhelming. Overall a delicious brew that stands up to the hype I've been hearing. That's probably why I had to work so hard to find it."
"This is a fantastic spiced stout, at a relatively low ABV (for the style). If I were to nitpick, I'd prefer to ratchet up the pepper and down the cinnamon just a hair, in about equal proportions."

"I'm not sure how I feel about this one. I'm tasting for the first time right after tasing Ten Fidy for the first time. Tastes a little thin to me. It's flavorful but reminds me of cola more so than a stout. I like it but I don't know if it lives up to my expectations after reading all the reviews. I'll try again at a later date by itself for a more honest andd fair review. It ain't easy to follow Ten Fidy....."

"Overall (4.25), this might be one of Stone's best beers to date. I'm obviously predisposed to like it, given the style and ingredients, but I still think they have executed it quite well. They've managed to capture my favorite parts of the big Mexican stouts, while making it unique enough that it's not just a knockoff of other beers. I know it's not often that Stone decides to redux a collaboration beer, but I'm really hopeful that they will decide to produce this one regularly. Even if not, I have made sure to stock up on bottles--an easy thing to do at such a reasonable price with such wide availability."

"Poured into an over-sized wine goblet.  A nice dark opaque brown with a light brown lacey head.  Aroma was primarily spiced, but dry and earthy as well.  Flavor was a bit like spicy pumpkin pie, spice with a hit of heat in the back.  Small bit of lactose sweet as well.  Coated very well, nice and thick with just a bit of carbonation.  Overall a surprisingly solid beer.  A good milk stout with a twist that worked."

"big hits of cinnamon. I had it at a tasting and served cold. Would let it warm up to get the full heat."
"Taste-Cinnamon, nutmeg,coffee, subtle chili pepper, chocolate. Tastes like a Mexican Christmas cookie. Full of flavor and character, smooth and very quaffable. Seek this one out."

"O: This is one hell of a stout. There's a lot going on here. Great smooth milk stout with coffee, chocolate, spices and chili pepper heat all combined into one. Complex without becoming overpowering, unbalanced or muddled. Pretty stellar beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I picked this up thinking it would be solid but not spectacular. I'm happy to say I was wrong, and will be returning to acquire more bottles STAT. Among the best of the trending ""Mexican chocolate/chile/spice stout"" category I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Aroma is exceptional. Coffee and chocolate, then peppers and cinnamon raisin bread. Cinnamon, a hint of pepper, chocolate, and a touch of coffee at the finish. Wow. Great beer, but the coffee is more than I prefer. There's also a hint of acrid character, and the finish is a touch too bitter. Wish it were a little more full in body."

"First time in a long time I've had and reviewed a Stone beer, but I'm glad I had this. It's pleasant and easy to drink. Definitely a lighter imperial stout, not one you'd have trouble drinking a whole bomber of. Love the vanilla, cinnamon, and cocoa powder flavors in it. Could use with a bit less pepper astringency but it's not a big distractor at all. Heck it may actually even help round out the beer and keep it from feeling thin, but I wouldn't know unless I had the same beer without the peppers. Recommended if you're craving something with some cinnamon and vanilla flavors."

"The sheer quantity of chocolaty goodness in the beer is absurd. It smells like some kind of magical cookie. This is a treat, to say the least."
"A pleasant surprise. I was expecting this to be interesting, but this is a nice homage to the inspirational drink. Spice runs a bit much and it could use a bit more heat, but it's worth drinking at least twice."
""
"In a word, impressive.  This style - Mexican hot-chocolate/coffee - has become increasingly popular in recent times, with a number of breweries exploring this flavor combination. What Stone has created is an absolute beauty of a coffee/hot chocolate/cinnamon/pepper stout.  Without a question this is the best beer from Stone that I've tried and easily deserving of a place in the list of my the top 5 stouts. I can only hope that they decide to bring this back on a regular basis, as it would regularly find its way into my refrigerator.  At $8.99/22oz, this surely has to be a more economical and equally delicious alternative to the likes of a number of hard-to-find, brewery-only Mexican-hot-chocolate-style stouts.  If you can find a bottle or two, go for it - I only hope I can get my hands on a couple more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: This brew is ok, yet again when I see ""Stout"" I picture the beer coating my palate with its viscosity. The flavor is light and a bit muddled. I can kill the bottle so I guess it's not that bad. This brew is Worthy."

""
""
""
""
"Yeah, I'm buying a case."
""
""

"O: For the price, got mine for $6.50, this was a really solid beer! Prefer Mexican Cake, but it is twice as much. As much as Stone is known for the IPAs I really like when they travel to the dark side! With a new Eastern brewery in the works, I hope they continue great beers and great prices"

"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle, into a Belgian tulip glass."

"This is an intense, flavor packed drinking experience.   Aroma, flavor and feel all are pushed to 11.  A bit of bitterness, especially in the taste, is all the holds this beer back from being truly elite.  Overall, I wish this was a beer that was available year round rather than a one off brew."

"Bottle. Pours black. Light is too feeble to pierce this brew. The head was initially a huge, airy, puffed and brown in color. It dies off to a very thin ring that has leaves long lacing islands. What an interesting aroma. Coffee and cinnamon really come out. The pepper spice is right there, too. The flavor is less dynamic but I actually prefer its more rounded flavors. I'm happy the peppery heat isn't as intense. It's got some excellent mocha and coffee and chocolate. The cinnamon is as soft as the pepper. Vanilla is also detectable. Body matches the octane pretty well. Medium to soft carbonation. Far more drinkable than I was expecting. I wasn't overly in love with the flavors but I liked it well enough. New Stone offerings keep me and many like me come ping back and back and back."

"I have yet to have a stone beer. Collaboration or otherwise that has disappointed. If your a stout drinker you can't pass this up!"

"Poured from a bomber into a schooner, the beer is a dark, almost jet black coloring, with mahogany highlights around the edges, and a tall, dense, foamy, light tan head that slowly settles into a tight surface coating.  Beautiful.  The aromas are toasty and cinnamon forward, with subtle chocolate and mocha coffee in the background.  It almost smells like a chai latte.  Nice. Flavors are heavily roasted forward, with a blast of coffee and dark chocolate, as well as a healthy dose of cinnamon.  Some pepper heat slips in the background, not to overpower, but to enhance everything.  Vanilla highlights help round everything out, too.  Pretty layered and rich palate.  The chocolate and subtle heat join the cinnamon spice in the aftertaste.  This smooth, slightly dry brew provides a smooth, almost creamy finish, with a cinnamon and roast linger. Some of that coffee bitter lingers, too. Great beer!"
""
""
""
"O: Another very nice chili pepper/Mexican Hot Chocolate styled beer - I really think these flavors work great in the base of a milk stout. Easy to drink with very well hidden alcohol - is matching very well with the chili I'm making and I've added a small amount to the batch of chili as well."

"This is a great unique stout. It's fitting for the fall and has a ""pumpkin stout"" type vibe. It would be great during the holidays as well. This is a winner."

"Unlike Montezumas Revenge creeping up on you like a baby's diaper after its morning porridge, this Latin masterpiece is a welcome sight. Black like a mamba, with a glorious hint of chile spice like that Modern Family chick in a two piece. Taste has said nice spice, also with delicate caramel and all that other ""stouty"" stuff. Only let down is that the mouthfeel is slightly lacking; but hey, you can't expect gold everyday."
""
""
"Jet black with a rich brown head. Very little lace as I drink it and head retention is minimal. Smells strong of chocolate. More milk chocolate than dark. The taste is hard to describe. So much going on here. Some chocolate with a lot of spices and sweet vanilla. The spices (maybe nutmeg) take over but not in a bad way. Tastes like Christmas eve. Creamy mouthfeel that is close to thick chocolate milk. Overall, an incredible beer. So unique and complex. So much going on, but nothing really fights for attention. Everything just falls into place. Definitely one I will be seeking out to stock and store."
""
""
"Overall: This stout is not one to be missed. It is definitely a seasonal stout. The nutmeg and cinnamon shine through but this is a chocolate dominant stout. A lot of times chocolate/milk stouts go terribly wrong due to too low of an ABV or too high. At ~8% this offering is alluring and satisfying. This is not a BIG stout, or something akin to an Russian Imperial, as the drink-ability is astounding! This fluffy and tasty collaborative stout is one of a kind."
"O - Really awesome creation of a Mexican hot chocolate-coffee-beer-thing. Love the lower ABV, drinkability, balance of all-around great flavors. Just pure tasty goodness, great as a autumn breakfast and/or dessert beer. This will probably be a repeat purchase for me this season."

"Poured into a Fremont small snifter. Pours pitch black, appearing opaque in the glass, with a half finger light brown head with good retention and lacing. Very aromatic, dominated by Mexican chocolate (with the cinnamon typical of this style of chocolate), coffee, sweet dark malt; spicy and appealing. Flavor is sweet dark malt, lactose, light Mexican chocolate and coffee, pie spices, lightly nutty. Nice medium creamy body. Amazingly well balanced, with the spices and milk stout components complimenting each other perfectly and a nice note of coffee in the background. This could have easily been dominated by any of the strong flavors, but everything is in harmony. ABV well covered; this could be a rich chocolate infused horchata. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A rather nice stout.   Lots of spice and with a little less lactose/milk then would have been expected for the style, but quite nice none the less.  A good thick, roasted coffee, and spicy stout!!"
"Serving Type: Bottle"
""
"Really nice. No obnoxious or over-powering notes in here, all the ingredients play their part and are balanced, and delicious. Definitely captures the Mexican mocha/hot chocolate feel. This will be a wonderful beer for the holiday season."
"O - Uniquely enjoyable."
"Overall: Very enjoyable and extremely drinkable, my first chance at a spiced stout in the Hunapuh/Abraxas/Mexican Cake vein. Definitely one of the more interesting new beers of the year."

""
""
""
""
""
""
" The flavor has a light peppery entry with mild hint of cinnamon and cocoa sweetness coming through fresh with an element of vanilla and light coffee/nutmeg woody earthiness and light malt roastiness mingling with the spice pretty close to the description of a mexican hot chocolate with peppers adding flavor but not a lot of heat with the coffee and cocoa in a cohesive mocha taste with a nice fresh maltiness and hints of char and vanilla that blend well with the spice. Overall a wonderful coffee and cocoa stout with nice blend of pepper with cinnamon and a very enjoyable base stout to make a beer that is better than individual interests combined it really works as a blend of spices integrated -exceptional!"

"The best Stone collaboration I can think of to this day. Balance is key and all of the added ingredients have their share of the flavor. Give me a NA version for breakfast and I'm a happy man. Cheers Stone, maybe their best new beer in years."
" My biggest complaint, and score dinger, is the viscosity. The base beer feels exactly like their coffee milk stout to me. Not bad, but not outstanding. I realize that it is lower in ABV, and I appreciate that more often these days, but it just doesn't seem to fit with the great flavor profile. Don't get me wrong. This is still an outstanding beer, at a great price too ($6). Since taste is still the most important part, I gave it a 4.25 overall. Easily my second favorite chili pepper beer. Make sure to try it."

"Like all well-crafted ""Mexican-style stouts", this one packs a good balance of flavors and presents a wonderfully complex drinking experience. The milk stout makes an interesting vehicle for this style, as the lactose helps to provide a sweet balance to the spicy and bitter flavors. An imperial version of this would be an absolute delight and a must-try in my book. I hope Stone makes this again (who am I kidding - a Bourbon-barrel-aged imperial version will likely be next year's version of WootStout)."

"I couldn't really put into words what this beer did for me. I guess it is because I have nothing to compare it to. I found ShooCoVaySah to be very unique and delicious. I can only hope that Greg Koch realizes that he is potentially sitting on goldmine should he decide to make this a regular release. Believe the hype that has spawned around this stout. Yes, it is that good."

"This is another one of the special releases by Stone Brewing Co. Had this with my breakfast the other day! The best Coffee Stout hands down! I bought 2 and I know i need to get a few more before they are no longer available."
"Stone Xocoveza Mocha Stout is one of the most exciting beers I have tried in quite some time. I really love the current trend of brewers making lighter bodied stouts and IPAs with flavor profiles typically associated with much ""bigger"" beers. This particular example is definitely worth seeking out."

"Strong cinnamon/nutmeg aroma that seems to overpower everything. In the background, there's also dark chocolate or cofee with milk. The texture is quite silky with a milky smoothness. Slight roast bitter at the end. This would be an amazing Christmas-time drink, kind of strange that Stone is releasing it when it's so hot outside. Nonetheless, solid milk stout with a lot of character."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours more of a deep cola color than jet black with thinner beige head atop.Whoo it smells like a straight on coffee house with deep roasty smoky espresso,wow that's some espresso for ya.Flavors of roast and char really smack the taste buds some berry like fruitiness lends sweetness in the finish,mild vanilla and brown sugar gives just a little more sweetness to the roast and char.Hell yeah this the most ""coffee"" of coffee/espresso beers I have ever had and I have had a few,ballsy and awesome here."
""
""
""
"t/m/o - taste picks up where the nose leaves off.  Milk chocolate roast glazed over with cinnamon and some peppers.  Really tasteful mix with everything in the right place.  Where this one is drastically different than Mexican cake and hunah in my eyes is in the mouthfeel.  This beer is way lighter and softer.  While it supports the flavors well, I like these flavors to be in a chewier bigger beer.  More like a cake.  Great beer though.  Get it if you can."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: an exceptional effort again by Stone and collaborators - in the same vein as Mexican Cake, Indra Kunindra, and others, brings together classic Imperial stout characteristics, with a great coffee undertone and the infusion of interesting and potentially prickly spices. Do not take a pass."

"Overall: This is a really well done spiced milk stout. The aroma is just fantastic, and that played with the high drinkability and smooth flavors in the taste make this a real winner. The creamy body works wonderfully as well. Some nice cinnamon is the last taste I get in the semi-long finish. I can't think of many better winter/holiday beers than this. (4.6)"
""
""

"Easily one of the best beers that I've ever had. It's an excellent masterpiece of flavors. Every single flavor shines. The cinnamon, Mexican chocolate, vanilla, nutmeg, and more spice. This will be nice to age, and I need to get more of this before its gone!"

"O: What I was really hoping for was a mimic of Port Brewing's Mexicutioner. There are just way too many flavors battling here and while it's a better effort than a lot of these collaboration beers ultimately kind of a miss. That aftertaste is real pleasant and kudos for not making the peppers too harsh but I was hoping for something thick with balance but this leans more towards a better version of the last milk stout that was put out."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep black with khaki head. Aroma is a potent blend of coffee, chocolate, and cinnamon, with the spices becoming more prevalent as the beer warms. The flavor falls a bit flat unfortunately; way thinner than expected. I get the coffee up front and the cinnamon lingers in the finish but I was hoping for something a bit more rich and complex. Almost no pepper or vanilla flavor. The body is also lighter than expected, which helps drinkability but kind of takes away from the experience. I had very high hopes for this and can't help but feel slightly let down. Don't get me wrong; this is a very good beer, especially for the price, but of the similar-style beers I've had this year I'd have to rank them Mexican Cake > Hunahpu > Xocoveza > Bomb!"
""
""
""
""
""
"As the full-bodied malt sweetness is slow to recede, a simmering spiciness bellows up from underneath with the freshy, fruitiness of chipotle and its light accompanying capsaicin. Chocolaty and fruit to close, the ale seems curiously connected to traditional mole Mexican sauce."
""
""
"Update: I set aside two bottles to see how this developed over time. Just opened the first, almost 6 months after the bottling date. The sweetness of the spices (and to a degree, the peppers) is more forward that I remember, and the chocolatey notes are fantastic. There's some fruit—more tropical than is usual for a stout—in the background. Thought it was good before, but now it's moving up into ""great"" territory."
