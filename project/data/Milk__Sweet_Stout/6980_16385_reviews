"Drinks nice but seems a bit faded. I was expecting something a bit sweeter as this is faily dry. There is some mild roast on the ending."

"Really smooth and great taste"

"It's ok...it doesn't separate itself from the thousands of other stouts out there."
"Nothing exceptional, but a great easy milk stout."

"Pours an almost black with a khaki colored head that trails the glass. The smell is subtle but there are hints of milk chocolate and sweet cream. The taste was nice with the sweet flavors coming through in the beginning and then having some of the coffee on the end gave the beer a nice balance that makes it so the richness isn't too overpowering."

"O: A calm and subtle milk stout, a nice blend of coffee and sweet cream profiles. A likable example of the style. If you enjoy the style and find yourself in New York state, I would give it a shot."
""
""
""
"It is super, no light can be seen through it. The pour into a glass barely has any head. For as dark as it looks it doesn't have that heavy after taste dark brews have."

"In the bottle, it's good. On tap, it is amazing! One of the best, if not the best, stouts I have had to date."
"One of the Best Stouts that i have ever tried. Keegan Ales should be proud that they make a product this amazing."

"Overall, this was enjoyed as a group with the groomsmen-to-be from our wedding party. After enjoying a curiously calming and leisurely 2:00 AM stroll around Spanish Harlem, we found ourselves in the possession of a six pack of this guy, and although not all of the gentlemen present traditionally enjoy “dark” beers, we each were able to enjoy this one. Our guess is that it was due to the cloying, syrupy sugariness of the flavoring, but with just enough balance from the metallics, roastiness, and lactic bitterness to keep any one thing from being too offensive. The nose smelled on the sweet side, but it’s main constitution was otherwise reminiscent of a silky American porter. While most of you won’t find yourself on the far north side of Manhattan in the middle of the night, this beer served wonderfully as a nightcap, persuading even the toughest of customers."

"O- Solid, but nothing stands out with so many other great one of the style."
""
""
"O: Really solid. Not my favorite ever - but quite nice and good tasting. I really like the coffee forward flavor."

"Price Point - $2/12 oz single"

"o - Overall a simple but solid milk stout. Nothing mind blowing here but all the flavors work well together and it is easy to drink. Worth checking out if you like the style, and could see this being a good starter stout for some new craft beer drinkers."

"This is in the top 5 milk stouts I've had, quite good."

"Overall: Original. Most smokey. Nostalgic. Romantic. For smokers and for wood fire builders, hudson valley dwellers (or river valley dwellers) down here in the holler the smoke nestles...."
""
""
""
"I was harsh in my initial review but upon second and third tries, this beer has grown on me. The carbonation is still a bit too much but the overall taste, including the somewhat hoppy finish, wins out."
""
"Overall: Not the best milk stout I've had, that's for sure. That said, the draft beers at this bar seemed to be experiencing some problems in general. Overall, this was just a little too light and sweet. It needed more roast and more body to get to where it should have been going."
""
"Being a city boy, Mother’s Milk made me feel like a woodsman relaxing after a long day of work. While lighter than your typical stout, Keegan Ales produced a truly smooth, perfectly balanced, dark malt with hints of chocolate and dark fruit. Great option for a heavy beer without taking up room otherwise allocated for a burger at the pub."
""

"O: good, but probably wouldn't get it again. To be fair, sweet stouts are not my favorite style."

" The flavor has a nice sweet malt flavor with subtle caramel accent and light roasted taste of barley with some gentle cocoa-like elements. The sweetness in the taste is not overdone and there is a mild bitterness to keep it balanced with some light alcohol and dry taste toward the finish. This is a beer I have wanted to try and I enjoyed it - it is a good representative of the style and was very drinkable without being too sweet."

"O-a solid milk stout with good flavor and nice creamy feel"
""
""
""
""
"Delicious! Lighter than I expected for a stout. I would totally drink this again. real smooth and what I had hoped. Served pretty cold I would have no problem drinking this ABV 6%er on a lawnmower or while chopping wood. I want to make some lactose type of beers and explore their possibilities so I am trying the available lactose beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Interesting take on the milk stout- if you like them a bit more bittersweet than lactose sweet, this is a solid brew to try. I probably wouldn't pick this one up again because I'm a guy who likes his milk stouts in the latter category. Enjoyed trying this one though! (3.5)"

"pretty easy drinking and worth a try but would not seek it out"

"I just love this beer. It's sensual. I want to gaze at the richness and definitive color. The appearance of the beer inspires me to write hate mail to stella and PBR. The nose is extremely telling and true to the display of flavors. Rich, sweet, milky, caramel, smooth, a respectable body while maintaining delicacy. PLEASE serve this to me in the correct glass. I swear it matters."
""
""
""
"The pour crests at about a finger’s worth of rich dark foam, subsides swiftly down to a consistent surface coating then finally pulls away to the glass sides, the lacing is wispy and without stickiness. The liquid is a super-clean opaque black, hints of brown to yellow at the glass bottom and rims, no visible bubbles. The nose consists mostly of roasted cocoa, sweet baked bread, anise, caramel and cola bean, trace of plum, actually comes off angular and dry so that any milkiness seems lost in the shuffle, not overly roasted but lifts well. Medium-bodied while on the firm and muscular side, not softly textured. The carbonation is light, however, it does last fully through each sip. Again, not that milky per se more crisper cocoa, mocha to coffee notes along with cola, orange peel, molasses crisp and pine. Given the higher level of roast, harder to discern clearly the hoppy bite but one suspects it is higher than usual for the category. Mix of black fruits sweeten the mid-palate. Overall, falls on the dry side so there’s no real naturally sweet length. Fairly sessionable and neutral enough to be versatile at the dinner table. Probably would benefit from slightly more sweetness and general liveliness."
""
""
""
""
"o - good beer but really disappointed in the carbonation."
""
""
""
"Pours smooth, very black, fast acting brown foam. Little remains. Light roasted nose, some dark chocolate pokes through. Milky sweet, roasting/bitter really takes a back seat. Very minor carbonation. Milky lactose finish, which becomes more cumbersome as the beer is finished. Very interesting flavor profile. But a one and done for sure."
"O/D-Pretty neat. Its always a treat to enjoy a flavorful Stout that is well below 8%. A sixer of these would go down with ease. I could see myself buying this again."

"Overall this was a very tasty beer but I wouldn't have known or would consider it a Milk Stout. The aromas and flavor profile was much more roasted than I expected with less sweeter notes than I expected. There was a lacking sweetness or creaminess to the mouthfeel that is needed/expected for the style."
""
"Overall an excellent milk stout--I'd happily have this again, but not with a light lunch--it'd be better as an evening beer."
""
"O: Overall a very thin, watery example, lifeless flavor, lacks substance and passes off the tongue without hardly raising an eyebrow in between. A shade below average enjoyment, becomes mundane less then half way through a single serving."
""
""
"Drinkability: Could be a good go-to come winter time. Easy drinking and balanced enough to go back again."
""
""
""
"Overall this is a pretty darn good milk stout. I'd say it's worth a try for anyone that is looking for a pretty drinkable stout. Is this top tier in its category, not quite, but still good."

"Poured a very dark brown color with a slight head that quickly dissipated into nothingness. On the nose I noticed elements of coffee, chocolate, roasted malts, and a moderate amount of piney hops. The taste is quite roasty and not as sweet I expected. What i noticed most was the taste of the roasted barley. I am not the most fond of stouts, and generally find them quite heavy. This is a stout that I can find myself ordering when I find myself in a stout mood."
""
"pours out a dark brown, but settles into a jet black body inside the glass. a thin mocha colored head quickly disappears. unfortunatly there is no lacing or retention. the nose is lactos mainly. some roasted malts in the background. taste is very sweet, like adding cream to coffee. picking up on some roasted coffee on the finish, but not much. mouthfeel is a little thin for me and carbonation could be better. rich creamy feel with some coffee bitterness on the finish. overall this is very drinkable, just not one of the top tier milk stouts out there. i would drink this again, cause it is good, just not mind blowing."
"Poured on-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is jet black with a creamy, dense, low profile tan head with great retention. Aromas of blended cream, coffee, and subtle chocolate. Flavors are dry, with a rich, smokey, cream backbone and some subtle, bitter coffee highlights. Very smooth and well blended, with a rich, sweet aftertaste. Smooth, creamy finish. Very well balanced, very flavorful, and very easy to drink."
"O: Easy to drink, enjoyable, and very sessionable. This beer could easily be drank/drunk all night long. Nice complexity to the smell and taste."
""
""
""
"Picked up a single at Euro Market in Astoria. No surprise, pours pitch black with a tan head. The aroma is a mix of milk chocolate, light roast, and lactose. The flavor and feel, however, is a drier with less cocoa. There are hints of mocha and brown barley. The body is medium, a normal thickness, and that sort of sums up the beer. It's a normal milk stout. It's clean, and hits the right notes for an American milk stout (I find the British ones to be sweeter). Not surprising, it reminds me of Left Hand's milk stout."
""
""
"Overall: This is a unique beer, granted I do not drink milk stouts all the time and honestly I do truly love how it is presented. It is sweet but not like soda, and liht bitterness and a whole feel to it that reminds you it should be used to compliment desserts to the best of the them. Salud!"
"O: Pretty good stout offering, nice balance between usual roasted taste along with a certain amount chocolate sweetness, tasty and would drink again"

"A pretty solid oatmeal stout but not the best I've ever had. A little too carbonated for my likes but something I would have again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Really happy I got this as an extra in a trade. Would have another.4"
"Good stout. Not amazing, but really nice and smooth drinkable stout. Worth a try if you want a good stout for the masses..."
""
""
""
""
"O-looks and tastes very good. I like stout and I'll go back to this one."
""
"O - i like this stout a lot, but it's not as good as joe mama's milk stout!!"
"Overall man I should have got some more of this. About to try a left hand again to see if it's this good but a very solid milk stout that I would love to try again."
""
""
"I thoroughly enjoyed it. The brew itself drinks like Milk, so be forewarned. Definitely good for the winter months season, and is a worthy find indeed."
""
""
"Overall- Good. I don't know if this would be something I would get again and again, but I would have it from time to time. 3/5"
""
"O: This is an okay milk stout, but the Left Hand and Lancaster milk stouts are better in my opinion."
"The taste profile makes me wonder how fresh this bottle is. With no freshness date on the bottle, I can't adjust my score to reflect any possible degradation from age. I can drink this, but I probably won't be revisiting this beer after I finish the six pack."
""
"Serving type: on-tap"
""
""
""
"Overall: This is definitely not my favorite milk stout. I found it overly sweet but for the price it is worth a try"
"o - pretty decent milk stout...not in my top 5 though..."
""
""
""
"D - dark and mild with a nice combination of dark sugar and roasted malt."
""
"OVERALL: This was generally lousy. The only saving grace was the nose, and that’s just because at least it smelt like a milk stout. The look was atrocious and the feel disappointing at best, while the flavor was basically just flavor in name. Hopefully this was just a lousy batch and other incarnations are not this uneventful. On to the bigger brother..."

"O: A completely enjoyable, totally drinkable beer."
""

"Definitely worth a try."
"This is a nice stout. Feels great, smells great but the taste seems a little weaker than the aroma. This is a all around wonderful brew and should be tried if given the chance."
"Nothing special about this one, but nothing needs to be. It's just a solid, enjoyable milk stout."
"Overall: A well-brewed straightforward example of the style"
"Touch of dark chocolate. Very straightforward and dry finish is earth and and more earth. Clean and dry with faint latte' notes. Bit of mild molasses. Feel is crisp and mildly creamy as it is kinda light and easy drinkin'. A quaffing milk stout and a nice brew overall."
"This is a great starter stout for those who are looking for a non-Guinness stout experience. Perfect for dessert pairings, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate..! What you see is what you get in this one. A genuinely great brew"
"O: A bit hard to finish the glass. The sweetness was too much, I needed a bit more balance."
"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a 1 inch puffy dark khaki head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Small dots of lace stick to the sides of the glass on the drink down. Smell is of roasted malt, chocolate, and some lactose aromas. Taste is of roasted dark malt, burnt sugar, and some slight cocoa flavors. There is a roasty bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a higher level of carbonation for a stout with a crisp and bubbly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good stout with an emphasis on roast aromas and flavors."
"Overall / Drinkabiilty: It's a bit like having a thin chocolate milkshake with a burger, which is what I had with this beer. Tasty, smooth, what else do you want. I could easily have more than one (and did in this case). My friend who was having one as well commented that this would be great with breakfast, and I agree. Cheers!"
"O: way better than i had expected, nicely complex, I would see this as a great brew for a day of being snowed in, really surprised by this one and pleasantly so"
"Excellent stout I've had a few times at other places since my initial tasting. Not an enormous booze monster, so it won't be a favorite of some, but I enjoyed this beer's subtler aspects and ease of drinkablility. Curious about how it translates to the bottle."
"O: Could have been my growler, but this seems to be off. I've had it before and it was nothing but sweet milk stout goodness. Re-review in order."
"Another well crafted sweet stout, eminently enjoyable taste. Hits the mark for right balance of sweetness to dryness. Has an almost mocha head that holds nicely. A milk chocolate impression on the taste buds. Another selection I would add to my Braukeller!"
"Tommy Keegan hit this one right on the money!"
"Thanks to by buddy visiting from New Paltz who brought me a couple of six-packs of this tasty stout. Really nice dark, almost black color with a foamy tan/coffee colored head. Aroma is a nice coffee scent, a little bit burnt. Very enjoyable flavor, with a nice balance of sweetness and the burnt/roasted elements of a stout. Goes down very easily; I wish this was something we could get on a regular basis in Connecticut."
"O: Great beer that's extremely easy to drink whenever. Could definitely drink 5-6 of these easily. Perfect for dinner, dessert, or by itself."
"O: A good beer, enjoyable and easy drinking, but the flavor is rather light."
"Has some decent flavor."
"o - overall, this is a great local offering and it is nice to be able to find fresh versions of keegan brews. i would like to see greater expansion for keegan, but a great extra for trades since they are solid. good milk stout, maybe a bit over carbonated, but the roasted malt flavor is nice...fizziness takes away from it quite a bit though. worth checking out if you like milk stouts."
"dark brown almost black with a nice tan head/lacing. roasted coffee and chocolate smell. nice and rich. really chocolately with roasted coffee flavors. taste of dark cocoa powder in the back of the throat. Malted flavor like a milkshake. very nice dessert beer. beer is thinner than i would have expected, or liked, but the flavor is there and the taste is long lasting. cocoa powder really lasts in the flavor profile. this would go fantastic with vanilla ice cream. not the most complex but the flavors are well developed. if it had a richer mouthfeel this beer would be top notch."
"This isn't terribly strong for a Stout either and I could hardly taste the alcohol in this. Because this is so filling, having more than one in a sitting would probably be tricky. There wasn't a strong hint of lactose or sugar in this but this stays pretty true to form and would be a good choice for someone looking to end the day with a tasteful and filling Stout."
"overall a really solid beer highly recommended great local brew"
"MOTHERS MILK STRAIGHT FROM THE SOURCE"
"Smooth and easy to drink, but I cant help but think a little more malt flavor and sweetness would do this beer some good. It kind of just glides along without much direction. Reminds me of something in between a guinness draught and extra stout...not quite as roasty and flavorful as the extra, but has the smooth creaminess and light flavor of the draught. I must admit I am on the fence with this one...rarely does a whole 12 oz beer disappear from my glass before I finish my review, yet I feel like I want a bit more boldness and flavor out of this one. Strange, yet compelling brew."
"Overall: Not the best example of a sweet stout and though it good use a fuller taste, the body makes it good and worth a passing glance."
"D-overall i really wouldnt call this a milk stouts. wasnt sweet enough. It was ok but i was hoping for more sweet and creamyness"
"O: Not as sweet as expected for a Milk Stout as there is ample amounts of roasted coffee and charred wood. An enjoyable beer overall."
"O: This is a tasty, slightly sweeter stout that hits the right spots, and does a nice job. Good flavor profiles, but nothing outlandish."
"Cheers..."
"Creamy, medium-bodied mouthfeel, slightly sweet bouncing off the roast. Well balanced milk stout. A little touch of chocolate. As it warms, the aromas of the sweet malt come out a bit more, a little caramelo. Also, the high carbonation becomes more noticeable, adding a prickly feeling to the roast."
"Pours relatively black, some ruby highlights at the edges. Finger and change of light brown head, mild retention and decent lacing. Nose has some chocolate, molasses, brown sugar and some roastiness. Taste has more roast and big coffee flavours, bitterness is derived from this. Milk chocolate and caramel sweetness too. Lighter medium body and a bit thin at times. Decent sweetness with a creamy feel. Enjoyable."
"D: A pretty nice, well-balanced, yet slightly sweetened stout that sits at a sturdy 6% ABV. Rich, bold flavors with the balance and creaminess of a fine milk stout. I'd be very interested in getting a bottle sample or even better, a nitro-tap pour."
"Pours a deep, dark brown, minimal head and retention. Scent bring sa nice roast profile, hints of char and smoke, faint kisses of chocolate and coffee and not much in the way of dark fruit. Taste brings above compoents of scent together, earthy an dlightly bitter, minimally sweet. Medium bodied, thin for a stout, lower levels of carbonation and somewhat dry. Nothing terribly off about this beer, just not a very strong flavor profile or body."
"Over a finger of creamy head. A nice dollop of retention but not a whole bit of lacing. Aromas and flavors both bring out the chocolate, oatmeal and berries of a lightly roasted nature. The flavors emphasize the bitterness of the chocolate and coffee, at least for a while. It seemed after a few minutes, the flavors lost their edge and the beer became a little """watery""". I don't know if I'll seek this out again, but I'm happy to have tried it."
"Overall a good stout, would be better with a little more body and bitterness."
"Thin for the style with a high level of carbonation. The flavor has a combination of toasted bread and burnt coffee. There's a shot of bittering hop at the swallow, but the aftertaste is mostly black patent malt flavors. Not really sweet or creamy, but it's tasty."
"Overall, lack luster. Best characteristic was the color - way too light and empty - no body to this beer was its greatest dissapointment. Not smooth on the finish I had been told but a """silky""" finish made sense."
"Overall, very nice. A very good representation of the style. Full flavored and quite delicious. Highly recommended."
"very easy to drink, goes down smooth. good example of the style, recommended."
"Pours an enormous 6 finger head. Over carb'ed. Smells of sweet malts, touch if alcohol, some coffe, some roasted barley. Tastes of coffee, roasty, some cream. Finishes dry and roasty, touch of lingering bitterness. Thin bodied, light mouthfeel. Not what I was expecting. $1.89 a single."
"The taste, to me, was exactly like the smell. It had a roasty kind of taste with subtle chocolate/coffee hybrid flavors infused. As might be expected, this beer was just a little bit sweet. As previously mentioned, this beer has a really thick body, and a noticeably heavy mouthfeel. Its smooth, and leaves a nice aftertaste, but it gets a little sticky afterward, which just encourages a follow-up swig!"
"Overall, decent but nothing exceptional or memorable about this beer. Might make for a good sessionable stout but its hard to know because I can't seem to find the ABV anywhere. I wouldn't really go out of my way for this. Cheers!"
"Medium in body with pretty decent carbonation. Goes down easy and is a solid example of the style, I'm just not a huge fan of sweet stouts."
"D - Very drinkable. Flavors are well balanced and work very well together. The sweetness is nice, and it does not ever feel like too much. Very smooth and creamy."
"Mothers Milk! Great name. pours a dark, dark brown, not quite black, little head. Smells of roasted malts, some milk chocolate. Tastes of roasted malt and milk chocolate with some dark chocolate cocoa at the end. Was not as smooth or as viscous as I would have expected, a bit thin, drinkable though. Keegan Ales, 2 for 2, solid beers."
"D: Great all around beer and I'm positive there's another six pack in my future."
"Drinability is good. It's a tasty sweet stout and I could see drinking a few in a session."
"D: This is a beer that is very easy to drink and sessionable; I could keep on drinking these all night long."
"Drinkability: A solid stout overall, not outstanding, but well worth a drink. This would make for good after-dinner fare. I definitely wouldn't mind having this again."
"D: Average to good"
"Thinner body for a stout, some lingering dry feel. Pretty smooth drinking, although everything felt a little dialed down."
"Drinkability is quite good. Not the best milk stout I've ever had, but it's definitely easy to drink and tasty enough to merit a revisit. A good brew with which to sit back and close out the night."
"Overall, not a very good stout. Nothing seems to work for this beer. Way to roasted and burnt tasting. I won't be able to finish much of this beer."
"Bottle. Poured into a Duck Rabbit snifter a dark brown/black color with a tan tiny bubbled head that leaves a nice sticky lace on the glass as it settles. Dark roast coffee, milk chocolate, and leather in the nose. Reminds me of smelling a chocolate malt. Creamy light mouthfeel. The taste isn't quite as good as the aroma with a sweet start followed by bitter leather and a lingering over roasted coffee flavor."
"O - I like my stouts to have a little more body, but the flavors are all there. A nice milk stout."
"Drinkabilityis quite good. I'm trying to slow my pace down as the beer is disappearing from my glass very quickly. I think this is a very good example of the style."
"A very nice milk stout with plenty of traditional character that is quite easy to drink."
"Mother's Milk is pretty good. The flavor profile seems to be a cross between a milk stout and just a normal, roasted, single American Stout."
"Creamy tasting with good carbonation. The chocolate syrup aroma lends way to a bitter sweet chocolate taste. Well balanced. Plenty of sweetened roasted coffee flavor. The ABV is around 5% which makes this stout highly drinkable. I was told they do an imperial version which I need to be on the look out for. Overall, a good pleasing session stout."
"Very drinkable. Good session brew, noy at all heavy like a regular stout. Decent cream stout. If I wasn't brewing a cream stout, I would buy more."
"Sometimes, the hot season finds you desperate for a Winter beer... who knows why..."
"Poured a chestnut brown with offwhite head that died quick and left little lace. Strong smell of roasted malts and some sweet malts like cocoa in the back. Taste is more of the same as the sweet malts like cocoa, caramel, and vanilla are in a medium body that is slightly chewey, but the biggest taste is of the roasted malts. Finishes dry with a hint of sweetness. Not the greatest milk stout as it could be slightly more sweet, but still an enjoyable beer."
"Yeah...this is drinkable. The taste is the strong suit for this offering. If it was bigger or more complex, this would be a great beer. Above average as is. I would buy and drink again!"
"Overall a nice little session ale. Not sure what was up with the look on this one, but would drink it again."
"Notes: This is an excellent sessionable (hopefully considering no list abv) stout that I can always fall back on when it's cold outside."
"Very satisfying beer on tap. In a rare move for me, I orderd a second versus venturing on to the next beer. Just so easy to drink and flavorful."
"Would I buy more of it? - I'd love to try this on nitro tap, it seems like a great candidate."
"Drinkability: Quite sessionable but I'd like more flavor."
"I'm not the biggest fan of sweet stouts. This one was a little better than most but I don't think I'll order it again. Very dark, stout color, sweet flavor with very little carbonation. I really had no idea what the abv was but it seemed stronger than I thought."
"Drinkability is excellent. Very nice beer which is enjoyable and drinks easy. The lower score is partial due to preference and personal opinion of the style. This beer may be better than the score I give it. While lacking a bit in terms of my personal preference, I would pick this up again if it were available in my area. First impression of Keegan Ales is good, I am curious to try the other I have in my possession."
"Finish is bitter coffee character all around but with a nice bitter finish. There is nothing bad about this stout, there is just nothing really very good about it."
"Poured into a sampling glass at the brewery, but subsequently I've also had this on tap at House Of Brews, NYC, with similar results: poured black with one finger of khaki-colored head and great lacing. It smelled of roasted malt, smokiness, and coffee; nicely balanced between sweet/non-sweet. The taste begins with a robust roasted, smoky, toffee flavor, which dissolved to coffee mid-palate and then finished on a sweeter than expected note. Very nice flavor progression. Velvety smooth medium body, helped in part by very little carbonation, and creamy. Not a huge fan of sweet stouts, but this is one that I can certainly session."
"Overall this is by far the lowest ABV Milk Stout I've come across and it's also one of the best. It's definitely got more of an edge than others in the style but it's very much worth a shot."
"D: The incredible mouthfeel of this brew lends itself to drinkability. The flavor wasn't as complex or sweet as I was expected: just a slightly above average coffee tasting stout in taste imo. I good brew overall."
"On another note, I also tasted it from a tap, which was poured into a rocks glass. The taste and feel remained the same, but it didn't have the bubbles that were there when I poured it from the bottle. I don't know what that means."
"Very drinkable stout with great flavor."
"The drinkability is quite high given the smoothness and lighter bodied nature of the beer. An excellent session-type."
"This is a good beer. It is smooth and refreshing, drinkability high. It is slightly thinner in the mouth than I expected but not a huge deal. No aftertaste at all. The flavor is a nice balance between front palate sweetness and back palate bitterness from the roast. There is no hop character in this beer as far as I can tell. Definitely worth a look."
"D: Very drinkable, this is easy and enjoyable to polish off and easy to polish off another."
"D: This a mild and drinkable, yet full-flavored stout. The taste is where this one stood out for me, although some of the other components could improve. I would drink this regularly were I lucky enough to have Keegan as a local brewery."
"Truly my favorite Stout to reach for on any given night."
"I was pleasantly surprised by how good this stout is from Keegan and pairing it with a Kit-Kat candy bar would very well. It is a great beer to pair with any chocolatley dessert."
"A 12 ounce bottle poured into my nonic Imperial pint glass. The stout appears a dark, nearly opaque brown color with about two fingers of creamy tan head. The foam has good staying power, hanging around for most of the glass. Flavors and aromas consist of dark roasted grains, sweet lactose and caramel, milk chocolate, coffee. Quite smooth and approaching full bodied for the style with ample carbonation as well. Check this one out if you have the chance."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 2"""+ dark tan head over the barely translucent reddish dark brown brew. Pillowy head shrinks ever so slowly, with prevalent chunky lace. Aroma is thick with dark malty sweetness. Taste is richly sweet at the onset, wisps of smoke in the middle, and lightly lactic close. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth, and drinkability is superb. Find. Buy. Enjoy."
"Poured into a pint glass its dark as a stout would be and has a frothy light tan head. The smell was like a slightly fruity green coffee bean. It was very delicious. The sweetness countered the bitterness perfectly and left a warm bittersweet chocolatey aftertase. I loves it. It was way too thin for a stout though which distracted from the flavor. This could be a beer you could easily throw back on colder night and relax."
"D: I could drink about one of these. Definitely not complaining about this beer."
"Balanced nicely by the bitter hops as expected."
"Drinkability is excellent--I will buy this beer again and again. It may not be a classic example of a milk stout, but it is an absolutely delicious beer."
"d: good drinkability for a stout, you could have a few of these"
"I've only good things to say about this local brewer. This brew is his masterpiece."
"D: Very pleasant overall. Would try again if in the mood for a milk stout. Have a feeling the appearance would improve with a better pour."
"Pours a mostly black with slight ruby highlights here and there. A small one finger light brown head lasts about a minute but then falls to a thin layer of foam leaving a minimal amount of lacing on the sides of the glass. Smell is pretty charred with roasted malt and grains with a charcoal aroma as well. I'm not getting too much sweetness in the nose unfortunately, but what's there is some cocoa powder and brown sugar. Taste is much of the same. Smoked grains, chocolate malts, and roasted malts up front. Midway a carboard flavor emerges with touch of molasses and lactose. Aftertaste is fairly dry with some woody flavors and faint coffee grinds. Light body with a sharp carbonation and a lively feel in the mouth. When I had it on draft I remember it being creamier, hmmm. Not bad, but nothing I'd seek out again."
"Drinkability - lovely milk stout would be pleasant to session with"
"Very dark, clear, with coppery highlights and a short tan cap of fine bubbles. Some lacing, decent head retention. The aroma was coffee and roast up front with malt behind. Slight cherry character as it warmed. Medium bitterness with a bit of grassy hop flavour. Plenty of roast and coffee, plus a bit of cherry and chocolate towards the end. Lingering cereal and fruit sweetness. Nice texture, creamy carbonation with a medium body. An easy drinking beer too. Well balanced and pleasant."
"Pours dark brown with a light cream head that last for a little while and leaves no lacing. The aroma is heavy on roasted malts, chocolate and coffee. The taste follows the aroma with a more bitter coffee flavor than the aroma. The mouthfeel is light and fairly thin with some carbonation. This is an average stout that is fairly basic overall."
"D-Overall a nice brew. Enough flavour to keep things interesting for sure. The kind of local, low priced beer that I would be proud to have as a regular in my cellar."
"Nicely balanced, very smooth. Highly drinkable."
"Pours black with a thin tan head. Good retention and nice lacing. Aroma is of roasted coffee and dark chocolate. Body is a bit thinner than I expected with some carbonation. Taste is smokey,coffee chocolate and maybe even some dark fruit. Really good."
"Overall: thanks to tedstertm for the opportunity to enjoy this one"
"Poured at the Alumni """Pub""" at Vasser College in Poughkeepsie, NY this serious brew poured a dark black brown color with very good tan head and great lacing. The aroma is a nice chocolatey coffee malt blend and a bit of tart apple. The flavor is a bitter coffee malt with a pleasant charcoal finish. There is an interesting sour milk touch. Very nice even cold. Mid body, drinkable and even fine carbonation."
"I have sampled this brew on tap, growlers to-go, and from the bottle. It has been consistently very good.Good color, very good taste. Deep robust, slightly roasted connotations.I would like to rate the """after taste""" as well as very good.I would not say this beer is very complex. Simple and delicious."
"Easy to drink, not bad, just not a milk like stout, more like an American Stout with lots of ash tastes."
"D - Drinkability is good. It stays smooth throughout the beer. Alcohol is hardly perceptible. Pretty solid milk stout and definitely worth a try."
"D- This is a nice smooth stout with a decent flavor but it is missing a bit of bitterness to balance the malt flavors. If it could turn up the volume just a bit it would add a lot more interest to this beer."
"Thanks, Joe!!!"
"D - very nice, easy drinking milk stout."
"D: Difficult on many fronts."
"Black pour with a lasting tan head. Slightly transluscent. Smell is light coffee with definitely milky creaminess, but not heavily. Hint of cardboard in the nose. Taste is mild roastiness with some creaminess and a finish of metal and cardboard. Some off flavors keep it from being better, but I thought it was still pretty decent and drinkable. Thanks Dave!"
"This is a very good beer and a perfect example of the milk stout. I recommend it to anyone interested in this style. Sweet but not overly sweet. Can be a good dessert beer but also paired well with a spicy dish."
"D: Very high! A good session beer."
"After drinking a few more, this stout grew on me. Check this one out if you see it."
"Pours a pitch black with no head after a minute. Nose is mostly roasted character. Flavor is sweet with a roasted tone that borders on being """burnt""". Feel is heavy on the bubble hitting the tongue and the liquid feel is pretty decently thick also. Drinkable, yes. A fairly smooth and even milk stout."
"Drinkability: A pleasant, satisfying milk stout experience."
"Mothers Milk is a fantastic looking and smelling stout that tragically doesnt live up to the hype promised. Its still a tasty milk stout and props to Grandq for the trade."
"I drank this one, but i wont be seeking out any more of these. there are many better milk stouts out there in my opinion."
"-Rick"
"It's thick-feeling, but definitely smooth and milky. The name is not misleading. Very nice on the way down. Smooth and eminently drinkable. The milky feel is a great balance to the bitterness."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not as filling as most beers in the style, if you’re looking to drink a lot of a darker beer then this is the beer that you’ll want. If I find myself in the mood to drink a stout for a whole evening, this would be the beer I would pick. Unfortunately, however, it’s not available near me, so I again extend thanks to plaid75 for sending it my way."
"Pours a nice clean dark brown color, nice carbonation, tiny fizzy tan head, not much sticky lacing to follow. The nose is sweet, malty, sligthly roasted, lots of toffee/coffee. The taste is sweet, malty, roasted, nice touch of toffee/coffee. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a nice Milk Stout, recommended."
"This is a solidly good, very tasty brew. It's easy drinking and just enjoyable all around. Wish I could get it around here as it'd be in my fridge fairly often. Recommended with ease."
"Had a pint of this at the Brickhouse Brewery in Patchogue, NY. A very dark brown body with a tan head. No retention at all really but had an ok lacing. The beer had a small mocha chocolate smell. The taste was the same; mocha chocolate very evident in the taste with a slightly bitter aftertaste, to let you know it was a stout. The mouthfeel was a little bit thinner than what I was expecting, but very good overall. The beer was pretty drinkable and it was an excellent stout. I would highly recommend it. The strong mocha taste makes it excellent, and it does well at leaving the bitterness of a stout to just an aftertaste."
"Without added sweetness, I find it very hard to balance the roasted character of this beer with my palate. Closer to a dry stout in my opinion. Nilla wafers don't play nice."
"Poured near black with a very thin tan head. When held to the light, reddish tones like rosewood. Smelled of milk chocolate with almonds. Absolutely delicious in my opinion -- like Nutella, but less sweet -- creamy chocolate & hazelnuts, with a bit of a sour/bitter coffee finish that nicely balances the cream. A little bit fizzy, but very drinkable -- assuming this new local beerbar keeps it coming in from upriver, I think I've found a new smooth stout to supplant Guinness as a go-to [not that this is """better""" than Guinness... or is it?]. Interesting to compare this from a bottle to the on-tap experience..."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Slick and seafoamy, the texture is so close to perfection... if it weren't for the prickly bite happening simultaneously. The nature of a Milk Stout tires one easily, so drinkability must be scored in a unique way here. I would most likely favor a beer next time that doesn't carry the sourness I mentioned before... but I had no problem getting through this beer. I still proclaim Hurrcane Kitty as Keegan's masterpiece."
"A decent enough beer, but there are better examples of this style."
"Poured a deep brown with a sturdy tan head. Aroma is malty and rich, with chocolate and coffee notes as well as a hint of cherries and cream. Taste is smooth, not overly sweet, and very creamy but with an undertone of sour fruityness that I find very appealing, although it may not appeal to everyone. Dry clean finish. A very nice stout."
"Had this at the Brickhouse in Patchogue. Apparently, the brewer/owner at Keegan is related to the Brickhouse somehow. Anyway, this stout poured an opaque black color with a huge head that dissapated down to a nice tan lace. Aromas of vanilla and coffee. Taste is sweet with vanilla and coffee notes but there is also a sharp sourness in the finish that was only mildy unpleasant. Overall, it's a pretty good stout for the style."
"EDIT: Well, the warming up did it nicely. The acidic taste I mentioned earlier almost disappeared, and the smoky aspect stood out more. Excellent overall."
"Pours a very dark brown with a moderate, tan, fizzy head. Slight lacing on the glass. The smell is hoppy, with hints of malt, coffee, and pleasantly--maple syrup. The taste is crisp, slightly bitter, and sweet -- hints of chocolate and coffee resonate. This is a smooth beer and very tasty. I would definitely consider this a session beer as I would imagine it would be quite easy spending the night enjoying only these."
"Black body. Frothy dark tan head. Excellent retention. Average lacing. Nose: brown sugar, cocoa, very subtle fruit, baker's chocolate, background roastiness, coffee. Medium-light bodied and creamy smooth with a restrained, fine-bubbled carbonation. Flavor: nicely balanced! Some cereal-like malt, subtle dark chocolate, a drip of coffee, a hint of fruit (papaya, melon). Bitterness is restrained. Finishes dry but not raspy, with lingering notes of burnt sugar, dark cocoa, coffee. Quaffable!"
"Weak thin mouthfeel as well. A very sour lactose flavor with hints of bitter chocolate & various dark fruits. Not a good beer. I couldn't finish this one and moved on."
"This beer is highly drinkable and a pleasant variation on the typical stout. This was my first experience with a milk stout and I came away very impressed."
"Very nice appearance...dark, dark brown...nice head...great lacing. Smell is malt and coffee and inviting. . Taste is superb...rich maltiness...coffee and smoke elements. Mouthfeel is creamy with a dry finish...excellent. Very easy to drink...creamy and smooth"
"I wouldnt take her out for lobster but I would take her out for pizza and a BJ."
"Overall, a good milk stout that features a good sweet flavor."
"I didn't much like this beer when I drank it the first time. It took a while to grow on me. Although the roasted undertones are still too strong and the back of the mouth suffers a bit, it's still quite a nice cream stout and, along with Old Capital (The Kitty and I have bad relations) are a great tandem for this smell brewery. This said, the phrase """Full bodied stout""" leaves me wondering what i feel missing from this beer, and I realize that the bitter roast flavor (which is great in moderation) is really getting in the way of my enjoyment of this """full""" beer. I can only really drink one in a sitting, but it's a good dessert beer for cold nights like this one (46 degrees in August?). Definatly worth a shot and definatly worth supporting this brewery."
"Mouthfeel is nice and viscous. Nice full bodied coffee flavor, though lacking the sweetness I've come to expect from a Milk Stout. Finish is slightly nutty with a long mildly bitter sensation."
"-UF"
"Aroma is roasted malts, coffee and chocolate along with a slightly dusty cotton aroma. Body is flat black with a creamy, two finger thick, mocha head that diminshes slowly. Some roasted bitterness in the fore followed by sweet and creamy milk laded coffee, milk chocolate and more bitterness through the middle. and lingering into the finish. Finish is dry, but tart and bitter as well. Has some decent elelments, but never really wows."
"A decent offering from Keegan. Drinks like a sweet stout with flavors reminiscent of an oatmeal stout. A pretty nice introduction to this brewery."
"CRUX: YEAR ROUND MILK STOUT QUAFFER. One that is always at hand in the DBF, as this is brewed 10 minutes from my house. Great in bottles or on-tap, I find the growlers to be a little lacking in head producing carbonation power, but everybody loves them, so maybe it's just me. (They are still tasty though...)"
"Had again 4.3 years later and still very good."
"thanks to weeare138 for this wonderful beer. poured a black with dark mahogany hues at its edges, with a tan head that left some lacing. aroma chocolate, malts, molasses, sweet, just smells like this will be full body in the mouth. aroma choclate milk, malt got just a hint of oatmeal as it warmed and it does have a nice full mouthfeel. very good."
"Nice example of a milk stout, the coffee with cream of the stout family. These days it's nice to see a stout without the word """imperial""" attached to it. This is fine with or after dinner or dessert."
"Drinkability: an easy drinking stout, where several can be quaffed. Worth giving this a try."
"This is a pretty interesting brew, although it would be better without a few simple flaws (miserable head retention and the sour finish). There are many """coffee ground""" tasting beers, but this is the first I've had that's more like a Starbucks mocha frappa thing. I would be happy to have this for dessert throughout the winter."
"Scarily drinkable. I would never have guessed a beer this dark could have lactose added, and turn out well. Definitely a good beer, too bad I can't get this here."
"Overall an ok beer, but I was a little disappointed."
"Drinkability and Notes  Not a good sweet stout at all. Not sure if it is oxidation or something else, but there is just something about this beer that rubs me the wrong way. I normally like sweet stouts, but this one just does not stack up in anyway."
"Solid roasted malt and vanilla aroma. Dark chestnut colored head fades slowly to a thin film leaving an uneven coat of lace. Deep black colored beer with a cola hue. Creamy roasted and chocolate malt flavor with milk notes midway through. Finish tastes like slightly bitter cocoa. Smooth mouthfeel with a moderately light body. A nice milk stout, flavor and aroma are solid but not extreme."
"Finger licking good!"
"A pleasant treat: a very nice milk stout. This poured a dark color but not black. A tan head arises but doesn't last long. However, a quick swirl will bring it back to life in a hurray. The smell is pleasantly sweet. The taste is very nice-sweet but not overwhelming. The only negative about this beer is that it seems some what thin but not distractingly so. Certainly worth trying. Enjoy!"
"It might be worth noting that I had this on draft once last year at the TAP Festival at Hunter Mountain, and I thought it was way better than the bottled version that I recently had. This might be consistently the case with this beer, but not sure."
"Thanks to shippos for this one. Pours a dark color with a medium head that dies off quickly and leaves a little lacing on the sides of the glass. The aroma is a blend of dark malts, chocolate, coffee, and some hops. The flavor is very smooth and creamy. Lots of chocolate flavors with a finishing bitter. Very nice beer here."
"Pours the usual pitch black with a moderately sized beige head. Decent lacing. Smells nicely coffee with a hint of chocolate. Moderate malt profile with the roast being slightly subdued. Hints of bittersweet chocolate permeate and the cafe isn't hard to find. Not a harsh bone in it's body. Smoothed out nicely by the milk. Great session stout."
"Thanks to shippos and clvand0 for bringing this beer to my glass. It pours a black color with a dark cream colored head of 2 fingers that falls quickly to thickly coat the beer. The nose is nice, with a chocolate and coffee malty tone going on, but with a piney hop in there that plays very well with the cofee tones. The flavor is damn nice. The coffee is subdued, coming through only on the end of the finish. The chocolate is very rich and creamy throught. The feel is the downfall of this beer. Is just a bit more than moderate. I would like to have a thicker body. There is a smooth creamyness about it, though, so I guess that is a redeemer a bit. This is one of the better milk stouts I have had. I say a big YES to this one."
"This is something similar to a cross between semi-sweet coffee and chocolate milk. Its a black, solid, dense brew with a frothy brown head. The aroma contains sensations of malt, chocolate, caramel, and roasted grain. It sure smells like a milk stout, but the aroma isnt quite as intense as Id hoped. I cant get over how creamy this beer is. Its smooth, silky, and very enticingrich and dessert-like. Moderate to high sweetness, with a nice roasted grain backdrop that balances the flavor. Lingering and slightly slick finish. This is a very nice mid-winter brew."
"Nearly opaque black with a nice head of cocoa coloured foam. Aromas are classic stout. Chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, slightly green hops, and a nice lactic, sort of milk scent as well. Taste is sweet up front with milk chocolate notes. The middle is roasty with the roasted malts taking center stage. The finish is slightly lactic and coffee-like as well. Frappucino-like, if you will. Nice. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, and the drinkability is damn nice. A very easy-going version of a cool style of brew."
"poured with a huge e finger head that settled down with an excellent pillowy top and a tan color, body was a dark dark brown but not quite black. milk chocolatly aroma with a bit of roasted grains, milk sugar definetly. very nicely balanced taste and well brewed some milk stouts can get very unbalanced. this has a great blend between the lactose and the roasted barley/hops to balance everything out. great job and very drinkable with a great creamy finish."
"My only knock against this beer is the overcarbonation. The carbonation is harsh where it should be smooth, hurting the mouthfeel and an otherwise very drinkable beer."
"Was able to finally find this brew in bottles. Keegan has been able to get the bottling line up and running from the way it looks! This is great news as the Milk Stout is a very nice local brew! The beer pours to a deep black color with a nice solid brown head that sticks around for a while and leaves a bit of lacing. The aromas are very pleasant with a mixture of chocolate or cocoa with a slight roasted smell from the malt. The taste is exactly what you expect after sensing the aroma, nice chocolate and roasted malt along with coffee flavors. It does have a bit of a sweet taste that goes well with the other flavors. The feel is of a very creamy, rich brew that can be enjoyed in quantity during the colder months. Over all a very nice brew and one that I can honestly say will be a staple in my fridge for the coming months!"
"From a growler that had been sitting on a shelf at Rt. 59 Liquors for awhile, but not Too long!. Pours very dark, almost black, lifting a thin, tiny bubble, tan head. Also leaves a tell tale sign of quality brew, a fine, wispy coating of lace. Nose is cocoa, and burnt grain. Medium bodied, with notes of lactose, chocolate, coffee and a slight dry sweetness in the finish. Tasty, drinkable sweet stout. Survives/lasts for awhile in a growler."
"The beer pours a dark black color with a thick frothy brown head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a slightly sweet, toasted scent that boasts of chocolate and roasted malts. It is a bit grainy and dry. The taste is good also. It has a malty flavor rich in chocolate, patent, and roasted malts. It isn't as sweet as most milk stouts, but it goes down with ease anyway. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking stout. It's not the best sweet stout I've had, but it's a quality brew."
" A very good example of a not so common style."
