With a very so slight tingly zip for feel. Slight bitter dark chocolate and roasty malt taste. Excellent brew. Almost borderline Guinness to me but this is thicker and a bit heavier.","Urk1127","Yesterday at 07:59 AM"

Alcohol was a little more present than I would have liked.  Feel was on the thinner side, but not too bad.  Different strokes for different folks.  If you like chocolate and a smoother ride, I suggest, for example, Samuel Smith's over this one, but if you like your chocolate tamed by a more traditional beer/ale taste, then give it a try.","marieli","Feb 27, 2015"

AROMA: beautifully milky, creamy chocolate with some almond and vanilla; extremely peaty and toasty... PALATE: smooth as silk; a bit slick; mellow and purely drinkable--a nice, creamy stout that ends with a slightly gritty finish...TASTE: as chocolately and toasty as this is, it is the secondary flavors of hops that inject a nuanced dimension to the stout; lactic and chocolate, back at the end...OVERALL: having binged on this all night in a Brooklyn bar some years ago, I can attest first-hand to its sessionability; drinking a singular bottle in the comfort of my own home, I can attest to its deservedly solo treatment.. the only downer could be the price: $4.99 for a 16oz.er is a bit much, but if it's ever on tap and on special ...","dacrza1","Jan 31, 2015"

The rich malt and fruity chocolate flavours come through well and I thoroughly enjoyed this but just felt it was missing a little something to be really great. Hard to describe but a little bit thin in some way. That said I really enjoyed the sweet aftertaste and while chocolate stouts aren't usually my thing I would definitely have this one again.","Decko","Jan 10, 2015"

Its colour and look seem very strong but it is not. Usually I feel stout is little bit strong to me, but this is not. very drinkable and nice taste. Like everybody here said, it has sweet chocolate smell, too.","Daefido","Nov 08, 2014"

Just picked up a case yesterday and the only flaw in this case is, that they tend to disappear fast than any other beer I buy.","misternebbie","Aug 27, 2014"

While I am impressed with this beer , I may have hyped it up a little in my own head, maybe a touch let down. Don't get me wrong, this is a very nice beer. There is a little aroma of chocolate but man does it ever come out in the tasting. I also probably served it too cold; I really should set up a dedicated beer fridge. Even still, the aroma only intensified mildly as it warmed. Was not overly sweet and was certainly indulgent, just as the label claims. Would make an excellent dessert beer. I also think that it would be a fantastic beer on nitrogen, just to amplify the creamy texture they were trying to achieve. Overall I was very happy with this superb beer.","djsnowman06","Aug 11, 2014"

Smell is roasted malts with very strong scent of a bittersweet chocolate. Taste is by far the best part, with bittersweet bakers chocolate coming up front along with the malt, with a slightly bitter hit at the end. The chocolate stays with you throughout the entire experience. Excellent beer for desert or with a hearty meal.","tlennon0815","Jul 06, 2014"

Aroma of dark chocolate, roasted malts and perhaps some black licorice. Thick, roasted, malty taste. I can definitely discern the dark chocolate and perhaps some raisins. Very smooth, thick taste, almost like a milkshake but not sweet. Slight bitterness at the end. This is my first foray into milk stouts. It definitely doesn't disappoint.

4.23,5.2,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.5,4,"Dark chocolate clearly dominates the profile in this luscious, silky brew with some herbal, coffee and spicy undertones poking through. Palate wise the beer feels very 'clean' even if some Diacetyl can be detected (denouncing its British pedigree). Overall this beer feels and drinks like a classically British, complex stout. It's biggest flaw is its lack of any real wowing factor or unique spin to set it apart of the other great stouts of the world.","endovelico","Mar 23, 2014"
3.9,-3,4,4,4,3.5,3.75,"Heard good things about this one... Looks good, smells good and has a pretty decent taste... A little light on the foam and carbonation though... My only problem with this one is the somewhat flat mouthfeel-- I personally believe that a beer that walks and talks like a stout should have a little more presence than this. Still, pretty good though.","SoupKitchenBeerSnob","Mar 23, 2014"

Some people hate on nitrogen being used in place of CO2 when serving beer, but I am not one of them. I think it serves relatively straightforward stouts like this one very well, by adding an extra dimension to them. Obviously not quite on par with a good milk stout served via nitro tap, but as good as one could expect. I won't hesitate to enjoy this one again.","Zdrummer15","Feb 04, 2014"
3.93,-2.2,5,3.75,3.75,4.25,4,"O – I like this beer and I’d buy it more often at the right price. However for this to be a beer which really blows me away it would need to have a sweeter aspect, more intense flavour, heavier body to balance the smoothness of the carbonation which all in all would probably also involve a higher abv. A beer which I definitely recommend trying as it represents a more unusual style (milk/sweet stout) and format (nitrous can). Nice.","abeeronthebeach","Feb 04, 2014"

Not much chocolate taste or smell at all compared to Smith's. However this is a very drinkable beer and I could have easily had 2 or 3 of these without any fatigue. The lack of any real chocolate taste or sweetness was the only letdown for me. The label was right when they say that this beer is not meant to be overly sweet. Was not sweet at all. More of a coffee beer than chocolate.","Richardbeerlover","Nov 09, 2013"

It pours pitch black with little to no head, but I had it in a bottle and not the draft can which would give it a nice creamy head. There is a chocolate aroma and a taste almost of chocolate milk but with a slight bitterness in the end. The bitterness lingers on the palate to give it a dark chocolate finish and keep it from being overly sweet. The bottle is not as creamy as on draft or out of the draft can, but it is still a great beer.","brurevu","Nov 06, 2013"

Head sticks around for a few minutes and leaves good lacing all around the glass. Smell is of course chocolate and malt. The first taste is like an explosion of chocolate flavors. Really has that gourmet dark chocolate balance of sweet and bitter. Leaves a sweet bitterness lingering on my tung to savor.

Has wonderful roasted malts and chocolate aromas with a thin mouth-feel and sweet taste mixed with dark chocolates. In comparison to other Stouts from the UK it gives off similar complexities with that of Samuel Smith Oatmeal and Imperial stout. Note that there is a difference from the cans and bottles. The Nitro-Cans have less bold flavor and more creaminess that works as a session beer. The Bottle has bolder flavor that puts it back in the big leagues. So in short, if there was a scale of 1 out of 10 I'd put the bottles at a strong 8 or 8 1/2 and the cans at a solid 7.","smokinyodas","Mar 13, 2013"

The front end brings a heavy dose of roast with dark chocolate. Milk chocolate steps up in the middle and lingers into the finish. A roasty haze lingers well after. Just enough hops are present to lend some balance. There's also a touch of alcoholic warmth that exceeds what its pedestrian ABV would suggest, giving this brew a bigger character than it would otherwise have. Mouthfeel is just right for the style and complements the flavor profile nicely. Warming certainly does this beer a favor, as the roasted chocolate elements become deeper and more present. Overall, Young's is a very solid chocolate beer that offers some depth and never becomes cloying. Certainly worth having again.","MaximalC","Jan 18, 2013"

4.01,-0.2,5,4,4,3.5,4,"The beer pours a murky milk chocolate, with sheets of fine bubbles cascading up the glass and slowly turning the beer from a milk chocolate color to a more proper fine black, almost like the black of a tuxedo. The head appears on the beer at a good finger and a half width, and has no intentions of leaving. It is also the most uniform and beautiful head I have ever seen on a beer, with deep tan coloring, and a creamy, buttery texture, this beer is a looker, and most certainly a beauty in a glass. Lacing is thick, creamy, and sheet-like, covering entire portions of my glass. On the nose, the beer smells sweet and roasty, almost like a well milked mocha coffee. Roasted nuts play beside (what I assume are) lactic sugars and sweet milk chocolate, and caress the nose beautifully. The sugar does dominate the light roast, but they play together perfectly. The beer tastes surprisingly light, beginning sweet with light cloying lactic sugars before pulling strong milk chocolate as the beer opens and eventually turns to dark chocolate, black coffee bitters, and a wonderful hazelnutty taste that marries the flavors perfectly. The aftertaste is of French roast coffee and light chocolate. My only complaint with the taste is that it tastes almost watery at the beginning before the flavors build, and this does sometimes sit on the tongue beneath the flavors as you sip. On the mouth the beer feels medium to light in body, and creamy, with no carbonation on the tongue. The nitrogen nicely creates a satiny blanket with this beer, but it does suffer from being a little too thin. Overall this is a tremendous English Stout, with superb flavors of milk chocolate, dark chocolate, hazelnut, sugar, and everything else. It is highly worth trying, and though it suffers in score due to its initial weakness in body and flavor, it is a superb beer and a wonderful example of the style. My favorite chocolate beer so far, though Rogue’s Chocolate Stout does give it a run for its money. Try this beer!","Maxwell","Dec 13, 2012"

The taste of course is full, complex, sweet, and robust. This beer is quite renowned, but I would like it better if it had a little heavier texture to it. Drinks smooth and finishes with a slightly chalky after taste.","Lemke10","Oct 31, 2012"

I'm glad it turned out this way instead though. It's a good one, almost sessionable, and full of robust flavor. I'd give it about a 3.9 in the overall category if I could.","BrownNut","Oct 28, 2012"

4.03,0.2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Poured from a bottle into a mug, the beer is a dark, opaque, near-black coloring with a thin, dense, creamy, off-white head that coats the top of the beer and clings to the glass. Aromas of milk chocolate, with a deep roasting in the background and a touch of bitter dark chocolate highlighting. Flavors are rich and deeply roasted, with a light, dry body typical of a Milk stout. Smooth, rich, creamy milk chocolate flavors on the forward tongue are followed rapidly by a touch of bitter, dark cocoa nibs underlying flavor profile. Very dynamic whilst remaining in the realm of chocolate throughout. A hint of coffee/mocha comes in as the transition is being made to the aftertaste on the palate, which is mostly the dark roast and slight bitterness. Smooth, dry finish, with a touch of roast linger. Very tasty and very easy to drink, I have found that this beer does well transitioning newbies into the world of the Stout.","GarthDanielson","Sep 28, 2012"

The smell plays a huge role in the taste of the beer, if that doesn't sound strange, and the taste is very roasted and chicory with a hint of chocolate. Don't get me wrong, it's one of the best stouts I've ever drank, but it's not a double chocolate kind of stout. Very well balanced and delicious though.","uld2541","Sep 03, 2012"

The beer has a very pleasant, though not particularly strong, chocolatey smell. It looks pitch-black, like you'd expect. The mouthfeel seems less creamy than you'd might expect (which I like). It tastes great, not too chocolatey. Overall, I'd give this a 4.5 because I think it'd be better with a stronger smell and taste.

Taste of big creamy milk chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, slight bitter coffee, light biscuit, and light herbal hop. Almost no bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, caramel, and light coffee for a good bit. Great pleasant flavor balance and smoothness. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with an extremely velvety, creamy, and slick mouthfeel as expected for nitro.

4.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Overall I really liked this beer and I thought it was a very good Milk Stout, it had just enough chocolate flavors to stay true to it's name and the aroma and mouthfeel really put this beer over the top. This beer had really good drinkability, it went down really, smooth, wasn't too filling, and the taste really held my attention, I could drink a few of these in a session without getting bored. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance, aroma, and mouthfeel, they were about as good as gets for this style of beer. What I liked least about this beer was that the flavor wasn't as chocolaty as the aroma was, it wasn't a big deal but if the flavor matched the aroma it would be perfect. I would for sure buy this beer again, it's not too expensive and is a real nice representation of a proper Chocolate Stout. Even if you remotely like Chocolate Stouts this is worth a try and is a true representation of the style. I was really impressed with this beer, I have passed this beer up many times, mainly because it's so available, but after trying it I for sure won't be passing it up again. I think some brewers need to drink this beer to know what a true Chocolate Stout should taste like, lately I have had a few that have not been that chocolaty, when you claim your beer is a Chocolate Stout, the chocolate should be the main focus, and that's exactly what is was with this beer and that's what makes this beer so special. Lately I haven't had great luck with English beers, but this beer broke the trend and reaffirmed to me that there are some great beers coming out of that country. This has to be the best Chocolate Stout I have ever had, a new favorite and it made for a good first impression of this brewery, this may finally inspire me to bite the bullet and try that banana bread beer. Good job guys, this is one great beer.","StoutHunter","Mar 05, 2012"

It's got a strong chocolate milk laced with alcohol aroma which would be a lot nicer if the alcohol level was lowered. Initial taste is of chocolate milk and a healthy dose of alcohol. Some roasted coffee flavor follow and lingers in the after taste. I much prefer the second half of this flavor profile. Mouthfeel is creamy and medium bodied, just as one should expect from a nitro can. Overall, the strong alcohol presence in this one severely limits its potential for me. I know I should like it, everyone else seems to, but I just do not get what everyone else is getting. Had it a couple times and each experience has been the same, whether in the can or om tap.","denver10","Jan 22, 2012"

As you would expect, lots of roasty dark chocolate and cocoa in the nose, along with hints of espresso, vanilla and caramel. The taste is much the same with the chocolate definitely the star, but not to the point to where it's too much. The roasted malt becomes even more prominent as it warms, with an almost smokey hint to it. Reminds me when I toured the old Ram Brewery outside of London and they had us taste the roasted barley. The mouthfeel is creamy and thick and oh so smooth. That, coupled with the low ABV, makes this incredibly drinkable. A classic and dependable beer.","beerdrifter","Dec 11, 2011"

I do know what smells and tastes good to me. I am a chocoholic and have tried just about every well reviewed chocolate, oatmeal and milk stout on this site. As I understand this is the macro brew of the bunch, sometimes, things are more popular for a reason. This is the case here. This beer is smooth, easy to drink, sweet without being overbearing. The Double Chocolate is certainly not just a market tool. I prefer beers of this style to have low carbonation. I'm not sure if its the nitro can or not, but this is very low carbonation. Has a very cool Guinness cascading effect when poured. Allowing the beer to warm a little does great things for both the taste and smell. Exactly the beer I hoped to find for the style. Nice little bit of dark chocolate and malty bitterness to offset the overwhelming milk chocolate.","beercar","Nov 21, 2011"

Creamy in feel, but with a higher carbonation level that increases drinkability, which is very also high for this beer. At 5.2%, it would be extremely easy to knock back a few of these.

4.04,0.5,5,3.5,4,5,4,"Overall this is a textbook beer on this style: every so-called beer drinker should taste it to see what a sweet/milk stout is supposed to be: light, drinkable, creamy, with lots of flavor and balance.","paulozanello","Sep 29, 2011"
4.1,2,4,4,4,5,4,"This beer pours a really dark brown color. It has 2-figners of light-tan head resting on top. The retention is so good that I could go to sleep, wake up in the morning, and it would still be there. It looks like a wonderful layer of cream. The smell has a nice roasted bitterness to it. There are also some chocolate and coffee aromas to it. The taste is roasty and dry. There are flavors of chocolate and coffee flavors just like the nose. The finish is roasty and slightly dry. The mouthfeel is excellent. It has a medium body and good carbonation. It has a super creamy feel to it. It is roasty and a touch dry. This has great drinkability. I could easily down some pints of this. Since the head never goes away and it is so smooth it is like having a layer of cream on top. wonderful.

3.88,-3.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Couldn't tell you where I first had this, but I've had it in the nitro-can and on tap at various venues. Pours...like a good stout: a creamy, opaque black, cascading bubbles culminate in a solid beige head. Aroma of chocolate milk with some coffee notes. Taste is, well, look, it's not gonna taste exactly like chocolate milk as the name might imply. But it's still very smooth and chocolatey, with notes of coffee bitterness. Not much in the hop department of course, just lots of chocolate, malts, and roastiness. On the heavier side of medium-bodied, and not only drinkable, but also good for making car-bomb cupcakes (with Bailey's icing of course).","Rifugium","Sep 21, 2011"

4.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a really dark brown w/ a one finger cocoa head that quickly disappears. Average carbonation and lacing. Beer is incredibly dark, almost black- impossible to see through. Nose is chocolate, malt, coffee, and some hops in the background. Nose is fairly weak, and somewhat thin. I'd like it to be a little more present. Taste is lighter, but a really nice chocolate/malt/sweet/bitter combo happening. Zero alcohol noticeable when drinking. Feel is really silky smooth w/ some hops in the background. Fairly low carbonation and medium bodied, medium malt feel. Fairly dry finish as well. Overall, this is totally solid for the style. Enjoyable. Good session beer, and recommended if you like the style. Cheers!","jayhawk73","Sep 12, 2011"
4.23,5.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a dark cola like color with a three finger creamy chocolate milk looking head which gives way to gobs and rings of lace all over the glass. The aroma is of milk chocolate and sweet malts. The tatse is of milk chocolate and some sweet malt flaovrs. The end has a coffee and roasty taste. The mouthfeel is sliky and creamy a very nice feel.

3.98,-1,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Rich and flavoursome. Plenty of dark flavours going on, with the chocolate blending nicely into the mix.

3.96,-1.5,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Medium to full bodied with creamy carbonation, this beer will always be one of the most drinkable stouts on the market. The body has a good thickness to it but is not sticky or coating in the least. The carbonation is not fizzy at all (except for the foam from the head that sticks to my upper lip) and gives the beer an excellent creamy, easy-drinking mouthfeel.

3.48,-13.4,4.5,4,3,3.5,3.5,"Pours black with about an inch and a half of frothy, foamy, cream/brown head. Smells of chocolate, caramel, a bit of roasted malt, and a touch of vanilla. Taste is rather thin, consisting of chocolate, malt, some grain, caramel, and water. Mouthfeel is thinner than I remember, and seems thinner than many other nitrogenated stouts. It finishes sweet and dry. Overall, a decent stout for a nice change of pace from the typical offerings.","eclipse54","Aug 25, 2011"

4.14,3,5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"O: I can definitely see myself coming back to this beer. It's classically delicious, with more than enough complexity to satisfy me in many different situations.

4.23,5.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"One of the ultimate dessert beers on the market today. This beer poured out of the nitro can as a milky brown color that surged into a deep blackish brown color. The head was creamy and thick like a Guinness typically looks. The smell is of some roasted malts and a ton of rich chocolate. The taste is full of chocolate too. The mouthfeel is creamy and very smooth. Overall this beer is kickass when drank at the right time.","Knapp85","Jul 11, 2011"

The smell is of roasted malts and chocolate, the smell is pretty mellow though. The mouth feel is smooth and creamy as expected from the nitro can. The taste is more watery that I remember (an effect of the nitro can or the past best date beer?). The main taste is of chocolate and roasted malts with a smoked / chocolate after flavor with a slight bitterness which lingers for a while. This out of a can is smoother and more session like than I remember from the bottle but its also more subdued and not as tasty. I'll stick to the bottles from now on.

For some reason, it looses something when bottled that is captured when canned. This has a slightly sweet, milky and definitely chocolatey flavor.

When I first got this I thought it was going to taste like a watered down stout aka guiness but once I tasted it I was almost shocked, this rivals a lot of quality stouts that I have tasted before, my only gripe is the low ABV which is kind of unusual for stouts.","Roke87","May 08, 2011"

Head retention is exceptional, with considerable sticky lacing all around. The nose is attractive, but this is really the only place this beer falls off a bit. Nevertheless, I get an attractive nose of light vanilla, milk chocolate and coffee. However, on the palate this beer once again flirt with perfection. The beer has something of a burnt toast flavor, which is quickly overwhelmed by cherry vanilla and dark chocolate. Mouthfeel is as good as it gets. This beer is light, soft and creamy, with a nearly endless, smooth finish. Drinkability is just stunning. The alcohol is not at all noticeable, and yet it's nothing short of astonishing how much flavor this low abv. beer delivers. An absolute benchmark, especially on the nitro.

3.7,-8,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a small one finger light light brown head. The head is super creamy and isn't going anywhere, as would be expected with a nitro beer. The body is pitch black, no hues of red or anything, completely dark, completely non-see through. Overall it looks pretty damn good, but it is a nitro beer, so it should look good. The smell is very nice, sweet chocolate on the nose, I also get a noticeable deep malt smell and perhaps a sour smell, like there would be in a Guinness, so I don't know if that has to do with the nitro or not. Overall the smell is chocolaty, it's a pretty good smell all around! I've had this in the bottle and I think I like it more, the nitro version has that Guinness sour taste to it, kinda an unpleasant taste, I mean it works in Guinness because it's not a Guinness without it, but I don't know if it works in this beer. It's very smooth and creamy, but the sour just interrupts what would be a huge chocolate flavor. I wouldn't mind having a big chocolate punch and then a mild sour taste, but as it is now it's 50% sour, then 50% chocolate. Overall I get a nice malt taste, and a nice chocolate taste, but unfortunately a decent sour taste. Overall, the taste is ok, not a good as I was expecting though. Mouthfeel is hard to describe, because anyone who has had a nitro beer knows that it is a unique mouthfeel. It's a very thin beer, but at the same time it's really creamy and smooth, with almost no carbonation. So it's not a bad mouthfeel, in fact it's good, just not as big as you would expect with a stout. The drinkability is actually pretty high, the beer goes down pretty easily Overall on this beer, good beer, and it's actually gotten more chocolaty as the beer has progressed, but still not what I was hoping for. Good beer, but not great.","MaltsOfGlory","Apr 30, 2011"

3.82,-5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Somehow I've had this a few times and have never taken the time to review it. That ends here. It pours a clear dark sienna topped by a finger of sandstone foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, chocolate powder, and a light air of coffee. The taste simplifies things even further (somehow), highlighting the roast and the (now dark) chocolate. It's tasty, but -- and I hate putting it like this, but I can't think of a better way -- still kinda boring too. The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a pretty dry finish.

Looked delicious and I couldn't wait to try some. Aroma was somewhat disappointing. Slight chocolate milk odor, but very faint overall. Taste proved much better than the smell. Started off nice and sweet with nice chocolate and maltiness. Finished dry with a more roasted flavor and hints of coffee. The finish was nice and kept the sweetness up front from becoming too much. Mouthfeel was excellent, smooth and creamy. For as rich as this beer could be, the drinkability was good as it did not feel super heavy, and the flavor was balanced enough to keep the sweetness from catching up.

The taste was a very deep and robust combination of roasted malt barley and chocolate underlined by hints of cinnamon, hazelnut, flowers and nuts. Mouthfeel - heavy and full bodied and viscous. Drinkability - It definitly lives up to the stout name. It was full of complex aromas and flavors, but the chocolate taste had a artificial tones.

The beer had a rather nice appearance. Dark black with a never dissipating off-white nitro head floating on top, the Double Chocolate Stout was immediately inviting. The taste was another story. Sure I'm aware that the name of this brew is a Double Chocolate Stout, but it seems like this barely even qualifies as a beer. The overwhelming chocolate flavor is, of course, the first and predominant taste one gets when sipping on a nitro fueled chocolate stout. There's a slight bit of bitterness and malts that let you know that this really is a beer, but for the most this is just a glorified milk shake. Trust me, the best way to drink Young's Double Chocolate Stout is poured from a non-nitrogen induced bottle.","TylerBGoode","Jan 07, 2011"

But for it's style, I'm happy to find only the slightest sweetness (in either of the servings I've had so far), whereas I've come accustomed to tasting a more sour, sugary sweet character taken from the lactose.

It had a heavy feel on the palate with no carbonation anywhere to be found. Overall this was a nice brew. However, the flavors were kind of light at least to me.

Leaves a nice aftertaste of more bitter chocolate and again, coffee. Mouthfeel is medium, carbonation is light which I prefer for this style. Not too heavy so drinkability should be okay.

4.38,9,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Found on tap at the Fredericksburg Pub in Fredericksburg, VA this creamy looking beverage is a thick black color with a big, finely constituted tan head and very nice lacing. The aroma brings out a very tasty chocolate malt and just a hint of leafy hop. The flavor is a very chocolate malted clone with a subtle charcoal aftertaste. This stuff is velvetty smooth and medium bodied for a very sensually creamy experience. Sweet but balanced with a pleasant grass/leaf/citrus hop background. With all it's creaminess it offers a bit of an aqueous touch, with minimum carbonation, that adds to the decided drinkability of this nice brew. I've had this in bottles before, it seemed more syrupy and intense than this, but this may be better, and more sessionable. Very nice, a great desert follow up to dinner without being too sweet.","Durge","Jun 28, 2010"

We had been on a stout drinking stint for about a month or so, when we finally decided to end it with, what we figured, would be the ultimate stout. We weren't looking for the strongest, but the chocolateliest. The pour was great. The smell was good as well. However, once the beer hit our tongues, it was less satisfying than Cloverfield was after all the hype. While this beer was full, we found the flavor lacking. The complex and intricate flavors of the drink were a debater's wet dream, but in the end lacked """umpf""". The taste could be best described as subtle at first, with a malty, chocolately flavor, that grows to a fuller stouty flavor that still has chocolate and malt infused. However, the taste is extremely mild, and even takes a bit of concentration to notice, making it a bad drink for nights where one has little moderation.","BeerKnights","Apr 29, 2010"

The body was lighter because of it and it was weird for a stout. It did pour beautifully though. Waterfall cascade of small bubbles like Guinness poured from a nitro tap.

The light mouthfeel may be a plus for some chocolate fans who are more concerned about the rich chocolatey taste. The light mouthfeel makes this an easily drinkable, chocolatey ale.

That is a huge step and I think that I can start weening her into appreciating good beer with more complex concoctions like this she is by nature a whisky and wine girl.

Roasted malt compliments the chocolate as well. It is sweet in the front with hop flavor and bitterness in the finish. Love the English hops. Not as chocolaty as I was expecting but rather a nice sweet stout with a lot of balance. Even with the benefit of nitro this beer feels thin but it maintains a nice soft texture that is pleasing.

The head has good retention, but doesn't leave a whole lot of lace. It smells of sweet chocolate and roasted malt, with a fruit character coming out as it warms. This beer has a nice subtle cocoa flavour to it, balanced nicely by bitter black coffee. There's a touch of sweetness to it, like molasses. As it warms, the coffee bitterness becomes a bit more forward. Chocolate? Coffee? It's damned near perfect and sublime and so much greater than the sum of its constituent parts. Like cafe mocha, chocolate covered coffee beans, or chocolate cake paired with coffee. Unless you don't like either chocolate or coffee to begin with, it's impossible not to like coffee and chocolate together. It feels smooth, but somewhat light in body. It doesn't leave me feeling full. This is a good thing, because it means you can easily have more than one. Trust me, you'll want more than one.

4.48,11.4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"This stout pours jet black in colour with a thick marble tan head with good retention and leaves some very pretty sticky lacing all the way down my glass. Smell is is rich milk chocolate malts with a touch of minerality and slight grassy hop twang. Taste is, indeed, full of beautiful milk chocolate flavours with just the slightest hint of dark fruits in the background (raisins). Mid sip reveals some roasted espresso with a good amount of bitter hops taking over on the finish. The linger is crisp with a touch of oily chocolate that pleasnatly soothes the palate. Mouthfeel is very rich and creamy with tiny little bubbles that give the beer a crisp mid-palate, making way for an oily, mouth-coating finish. This stout is immensely drinkable. A good amount of complexity for a milk stout with a manageable 5.2% ABV makes this a very enjoyable session stout. Despite it's weight, I feel that I could easily throw back a few of these. A very well crafted stout. Highly recommended.","Graham5161986","Aug 12, 2009"

The mouthfeel is very smooth with a good amount of carbonation. It is near perfect in my opinion, thanks in some part to the nitro tap. In summary, I recommend that you try this beer.

After tasting it though the taste was quite different then the smell. Taste like chocolate for sure, almost like chocolate milk just with a beer kick. Really nice taste though, and has a nice creamy mouthfeel. I poured it from a bomber so the first glass went by pretty fast and I will have no problem finishing it off right after.

Almost too sweet to drink. I thought, did they change this beer? So I picked up a bottle more recently to compare. The version on tap must have been messed up, as the bottled stout tasted more like I remembered. So the bottle is what I will review. Poured into a stemmed glass. Dark brown color, bordering on black. Decent tan head, some lacing. Roasted barley smell. Very rich, dark chocolate stands out in the flavor. Dark and bitter to the point that it subdues the sweetness, in a good way. I like the fact that it's not overly sugary, but has a nice mix of sweetness and roastedness. Also a bit dry on the palate, so I would not describe this beer as creamy. Easy to drink, and low in abv. A perfect before or after dinner beer.","morebeergood","Jan 15, 2009"

The best before date is 6 months away and there was a nice hiss when I opened the bottle, so I don't believe it has gone bad. I think it's just not good.

Damn, it's a beauty, but there's not much going on aromatically. Some roasted malts are noticed. Tastes of dark chocolates, but not as bold as expected, being a """Double""" Chocolate Stout. I might have approached this expecting something else. Some cinammon and nutmeg are involved though, with some redemptive hop goodness in the end. This is a very full-bodied brew, that just happens to be drinkable as well. Not much more I can say.","stephens101","Oct 11, 2008"

I walk by this beer every time I am in the beer store. Went to the store with my fiancee and she asked about it. I told her what I thought and she asked if we could split it anyway. So I went ahead and picked it up. We split the bottle at her apartment. This beer is much better than I remember it. Pours a deep brown with a creamy head. Smell is exactly like sweet chocolate.

There is plenty of bittersweet aromas, roasted malts, dark chocolate....and the faintest metallic smell. I'm not sure what that last one is all about, but the rest are pretty damn good! Oh wow. This one tastes like a (not so) hot chocolate! Upon my first sip I'm met with cocoa, lots and lots of cocoa, which are at first very sweet, but then gives way to a nice bitter chocolate taste.

Taste was that of fresh chocolate milk with a silky smoothness from the nitrogen bubbles leaving a creamy film in my mouth.

It settled into a thick, deep-tan head like the top of a milkshake. The beer itself was a deep, dark brown with cola highlights. The nose was very chocolaty. The first sip that I took filled my mouth with a milk chocolate taste along with a powdery feeling, like I had inhaled Quik or something like that.

The taste is unsweetened chocolate bitterness at the back (funny enough, a bit like eating a mouthfeel of cocoa powder), with a slight kick of fancy molasses. I find it somewhat astringent.

I was expecting something very velvety, but this is not quite there, sure its smooth, but I think that higher levels of carbonation take away from it. All in all feel is a bit rough around the edges. As I also mentioned it is much lighter in body, it feels a bit weak, like it should be heavier than the medium-light that it is. Though I think it may need work in appearance and mouthfeel this is still a great beer, I recommend it to everyone. This is one of the big boys out there, you should try this before you die. I could sit around and drink this all day, though I feel that my appreciation for it would become much less if I did so. This is a brew that I'll not hesitate to buy again. However, I am wont to buy sixers over single bottles...at the price of about $3.50-4.00 it is getting towards pricey, I think I'd rather buy a sixer of Kalamazoo, in fact I know I would. On the other hand, when I'm in the mood for something with extreme chocolate flavor, this is where I'll turn. Very satisfying, very refreshing, if you love chocolate than this is for you.","becktone","Mar 04, 2008"

It's a lot more bitter than the smell, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Tastes a lot more like baking chocolate than hot chocolate. Mouthfeel is a lot lighter than I was expecting from a stout.

Dont get me wrong, the hoppy, malty beer smell is ok, but in a flavored beer, i need to smell the flavor along with the taste. Very nice mouthfeel, not watery, not too thick. Alas, the taste leaves something to be desired, for a chocolate beer. Still a great tasting beer, do not get me wrong, just not the chocolatey taste i was hoping for in a double chocolate stout. Now if it were a double stout chocolate, id get it. Too much of a bitter taste in the foreground for me, but the aftertaste does make up for it. There are other chocolates out there id buy first, but id take this one if it were there. And the price was much better than the 6 i paid for another chocolate.","blatherbeard","Feb 13, 2008"

Slight carbonation, nothing overwhelming. This is one of the more easy beers to drink that I have ever had. I also feel as this beer could surely bridge someone into the world of craft beer.

The taste was much the same--it seemed identical in flavor and mouthfeel to chocolate milk. There was no hint of the alcohol (until I stood up) and the carbonation was nil, which really worked in its favor. I was floored, but and for /1000, I was not disappointed.

Chocolate, as expected, is rich and full, almost syrup like. Some roasted grains and malt, but mainly chocolate. Somewhat bitter taste left in mouth. Thick and full mouthfeel, low carbonation.

Feel is thick with a decent carbonation. It is drinkable, sure. But for a double chocolate stout, I am not blown away. I had this before in the bottle and wasnt entirely wooed by it and wanted to give it another shot since I figured my palate might have not be en mature enough to appreciate.

I'm not a big fan of chocolate shouts with actual chocolate added, but if I was, this might be my favorite. The first sip is really when it hits you...the chalky chocolate mouthfeel really dominates this ale. About halfway through the glass I couldn't taste the chocolate anymore, and only then could I detect a tiny malt and hop presence. This one goes down really easy even though I like to savor each sip to see if I was going to get malt or chocolate.","Upgrayedd","Nov 06, 2007"

Strong roastiness finishes. No real hop bitterness, just from the roasted malts. Velvety smooth mouthfeel.

I didn't want an overpowering chocolate syrup taste, but this was just disappointing. It needs a little more sweetness, although I still would not want to see it too rich.

The flavor in the mouth is a cocoa lovers dream. It's so creamy and smooth as the chocolate flavors carress the mouth and bring lingering caramel malts to the tounge.

I can't quite place it - the dark, roasty, chocolatey notes are there, but they're subtle. It feel light and clean, for a stout - there's no strong alcohol to punch you in the face.

Normally I like beer that just tries to taste like beer but this stuff was pretty good. I liked it. I wouldn't drink it all night, though.

Just tonight, I revisited this classic example of the Milk Stout style, but in a can. I can't say it lived up to the earlier experience. While the brew exhibited most of the same characteristics as its on-tap kin, it just didn't have the same intense flavor profile. The beer poured its dark, dark brown color into my Sam Smith pint glass. While pouring, I heared the """widget""" bouncing around in the can. This certainly provided a full, dense head and a nice creamy texture to the beer. The aroma was mainly of dark malts; there was very little else to be noticed here. My memory of the taste was of dark malts with a bigand I mean bigdark chocolate flavor. In this version, the malts were certainly present but the chocolate was subdued. It felt as though I were drinking Guinness with a bit of chocolate added. I definitely noticed an improvement as the beer warmed. The creamy mouthfeel of this beer is fantastic, even with the flavors stunted. I'll have to try this again on tap to see if an anomaly has occurred or if there is a real difference between the two.","CWiggins","Jul 16, 2007"

It smelled like dark chocolate as its name implies with the hint of biterness that goes along with dark as opposed to milk chocolates. In the mouth it felt full and velvety and coated the throat as it went down. A delicious dessert beer, maybe it was because I had worked all day before putting it down, but when I was done, I was sleepy!

There's some lacing, but not a lot. It has a great mouthfeel - creamy and delicious and hardly any bubbles - like drinking a glass of milk.

Soft cocoa aromas along with some slightly sour black roasted malt scents. Reminds me of chocolate flavored licorice whips. That soft, chewy cocoa flavor is present at various points throughout the taste, but it is also interspersed with some dark-roasted graininess that borders on burnt. Some mild dark berry notes are in there, too, along with some well-placed and well-restrained residual sugars. Just sweet enough to remind you that it's a lacto-stout, but nothing too overbearingly sweet. Mouthfeel is smooth enough, remaining full-bodied while never feeling too heavy on the palate.

This is the sweet chocolate too, many times a chocolate beer has the bitter bakers chocolate smell and taste but this is very sweet. Some roasted dark malts peek though. Taste matches the smell but gets just the slightest knock in score for just being a little too sweet. Mouthfeel is velvety (according to my wife). I would have just said very smooth. All in all a very drinkable beer. It is certainly the most chocolately flavored beer I've ever had.","beermanbrian","Jan 05, 2007"

At first, it seems thick and satisfying. Definitely sweet. But somehow it weakens as it warms, and becomes more and more watery...somehow...?

Taste was very dark, slightly bitter, yet still with some sweetness to it. Perhaps my palate just isn't refined enough, but I didn't really notice much chocolate flavor. Slightly nutty with extremely vague hints of cocoa. Mouthfeel was very heavy, not syrup-like, but close. This might turn some people off, but I didn't mind it.

The head settles slowly, leaving impressive lacing as it does. The body is a virtually opaque brown-ruby. The nose is like smelling a milk chocolate bar with stout spilled on it. There's a hint of roastedness, and a good bit of sweetness. Perhaps just a bit of coffee, too. That lovely sensation comes through so well in the taste: creamy just like a cadbury bar. The chocolate fully dominates the flavor, with just a little bit of acidity. I feel that more flavor comes through than on nitro. The mouth manages to be quite smooth without the nitrogen, and has a very fine but noticeable acidity. A fine beverage, even better than nitro.","mjc410","Dec 11, 2006"

The head retains well and leaves droopy lacing that eventually settles back down into the beer save a few islands along the edge of the glass. The smell is of chocolate and deep malts from well roasted barley. There is anise and plum and herbs and rooty confectioners chocolate all up in my grill when Im smelling this. There is just so much in the nose here. The taste is so balanced and fantastic, I dont know where to begin. It rich and creamy and properly carbonated with chocolate very pervasively, but not overly strongly exploding across the palate. There are deep rooty essences and a non-descript fine bitterness throughout, nothing floral. It tastes like powdery chocolate, but totally no artificial. And I want to gulp this beer; dangerously so.

I know it's been stated many times before but it has the appearance of Guinness Draught. The aroma is similiar to a malted chocolate milkshake (of course). Upon initial tasting, you palate is overwhelmed by the silky texture and chocolate taste. It really does remind me of a milkshake. As it warms in the glass, the chocolate fades and the bitterness comes out more. The smooth mouthfeel changes to a more traditional average to thick viscosity of a stout.

There's a hint of roasted malt too, but it's quite subdued compared to the caramel maltiness. The flavour has a lot more malt in it, some caramel, that complements the chocolate. On the bittersweet side more than milk chocolate. Fairly quick finish with a bit of cocoa. On the creamy side, medium bodied with slightly lower than average carbonation. Also a bit dry.

The beer is smooth, almost velvety, and rich with chocolate, cocoa, and hints of coffee with cream. An important high point in this brew is that its very rich without being overly sweet, making it a bit more drinkable than many other rich beers. Still, it is very rich and very filling....I couldn't see myself enjoying more than two of these before switching to something else, which is the only reason I rated the drinkability below the 4.0 mark.

Nose is of chocolate, sort of half dark and half cocoa powder like Nesquik. Theres some malt there as well. Taste is a lot more mellow than I expected, milk chocolate flavor with mild coffee. Mild malt dominates. Overall the flavor is mild and not bitter. Finishes on a nice slightly bitter coffee finish. Mouth is very good: fully, creamy, and fluid. Drinkability is very good.

Color is that of the darkest chocolate bar and opaque when held to the light. The aroma is well presented, and dominated by the sweet unfermented sugars left in the brew. Chocolate is very present as the name suggests, but there is a creaminess and roastiness also present. The taste is very fit to the style, sweet. Nice and creamy, possibly due to lactose used in fermentation. Flavor is dominated by the creamy flavor, followed by a hit of chocolate malt, and comes together beautifully with a bit of roasted malty bitterness. mouthfeel is thick, almost like whole milk, leaving a film inside your mouth. Drinkability is mixed for me. I would definitely buy this beer again, but it is not a session beer. I don't think I could drink more than a pint of these in one sitting, but this is not a bad thing. I definitely suggest giving this beer a try. If you've had it and want another beer like it, try Bell's Special Double Cream Stout. It is very similar in many ways.","Avagadro","Jul 28, 2006"

It is like biting into one of those dark chocolate bars that is 80% (or more) pure dark cocoa. Makes sense, since that's what this beer is made from!

The pour is exceptionally creamy with a brown mocha color. After it sat a bit the thin rich head separated from the dense black below. Strong scent of porter and chocolate. The chocolate taste is very present, followed by a pleasant stout bitterness that effectively leaves the mouth feeling somehow cleansed and ready for another sip, althouth the former did seem to diminish as the beer cooled.

The taste is sublime: the chocolate is readily noticeable right up front, but is nicely balanced by espresso and a touch of caramel. I had expected more roastiness, but I'll settle for bathing in the sweet and the bitter that make this brew so enjoyable.

Actual beer isn't that impressive - seems a bit flat, even compared to Guinness nitro. Flavors are all very subdued. The chocolate is very subtle in the aftertaste, hop bitterness is pretty low, and there's not a lot of malt flavor. Watery consistency overall due to the lack of bitterness, dryness or sweetness.

Very faint roasted malts. After being unsatisfied with the aroma, the taste came and saved the day, bringing the malts to the foreground. The flavor of chocolate and roasted barley malts coat the inside of your mouth and it all ends with a slight hop bitterness in the finish. Drinkable for a stout, but not my favorite so far. I would like to try it out of a nitro can, however, as I can see it's potential for being a different beast out of the can.","Jacobob10","Mar 03, 2006"

Some subtle toasty chocolate notes are present in the aroma, but not much else, no hops to speak of. Sweet milk chocolate flavor, mocha latte, smooth bittering with no hop flavors, sweet finish. Nice creamy mouthfeel, very smooth nitro-carbonation, medium bodied and leaves a light coat on the palate.

Sweet dextrin and a huge roasted flavor upfront, followed by a soft wave of unsweetened bakers chocolate. The aftertaste is a touch dry, with some creamy dextrins holding on, but lots of roasted bitterness that creates a good balance without any need for hops. The carbonation is flat, the body like whole milk, and the mouthfeel is very...very creamy.

This beer really sets up on the front of your tongue and stays there. Although there's not hop bitterness too offset the sweet flavors, there's plenty of malt bitterness that does the job perfectly.

One would expect a heavier beer, given the color, but this is one great sessioner. The aroma was exceptionally clean and slightly toasty. This beer is simple and very good, much richer in flavor than other stouts. And the chocolate tastes are just out of this world.

The taste is complex, with a strong chocolate presence, competing with brandy, vanilla and malt.

The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a little too much carbonation for a stout (not so much that it ruins the beer though). Overall, this brew doesn't live up to its name.

Stouts should have a certain amount of unfermented sugars lingering. Sugars that provide a texture, the produce a mouthfeel. It was silky, there was a nice chocolate bitterness, but, but, but, why?

A pleasing flavor of malts and chocolate throughout the pint. Most notable was the superb integration of the flavors. This chocolate stout did not possess the beer+ added flavorings characteristic of some flavored brews. Mouthfeel was smooth but not especially creamy. Light carbonation helps the flavor remain pronounced.

The smell is very prominant, sweet malts are almost exclusive with some hop presence to sting the senses. The taste is sweet and there are not just hints of chocolate but full blown taste at the outset. A very nice balance of sweet and smooth/dry and bitter.

Not as rich in the lactose and chocolate as I expected. The body is where this beer really fell short with me. It wasn't as silky or smooth as I expected.

I get a rich, bitter-sweet aftertaste that leaves me wanting more. The lower alcohol content for this beer prevents the 'warming' sensation typical of this style.

Authentic chocolately, coffee-infused mocha. Taste followed a similar pattern - subtley malty with hoppy balance and choco/coffee notes that became so much richer as it warmed. Detected some slight alcoholic notes, but nothing major. The heady pour made me worried about over-carbonation, but it was perfect along with the smooth creamy mouthfeel.

Finish is again more in the coffee realm and doesn't last too long. The mouthfeel is a slight disappointment, not full, not really medium, and thin on the sides.

The body is black with ruby/brown coming through at the edges when held to light. The smell has chocolate, coffee, a roasted character, and a milky sweetness along with a bit of hops. The taste follows this but with hop nuances - mostly pine and floral - and a nice bitterness that lingers. The flavor isn't too strong but it is strong enough.

For the most part, the taste is wonderful, a nicely toasted stout flavor with a hearty amount of chocolate.

4.01,-0.2,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,"Pours like gravity into a black hole. BLACK. Beautiful, thick, rich head with admirable staying power. The nose has all the requisite stout aromas, but I detected a sort of burnt cookie aspect to it, hence the lower score. The taste is pure heaven. It really is chocolatey with excellent bitter counterbalance. Tried with a slice of chocolate decadence at dessert - a great combo. In the mouth it is like a tailored jacket for your tongue. Almost too rich, it would be too filling to drink more than one.","mrgrandefromage","Apr 09, 2005"

Aromas of dark chocolate, hints of milk, treacle (sweet malt I guess) and rum soaked raisins. Not so much sweetness in the taste, more like dark chocolate with a little extra bitterness thrown in. Slight burnt taste towards the end as well. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy as expected, but became a little watery as the beer warmed and the carbonation receeded. Will come back and re-rate this after my beer tastebuds mature a little.","hefevice","Apr 01, 2005"

Sweet milk chocolate aroma with a chocolate malt note. Some pear adds to complexity. Medium to full body. A well blended combination of real chocolate, chocolate malt, roasted barley dryness balanced with hop bitterness. So drinkable I have nothing written down. I remember wanting a little more complexity from the stout side and being well satisfied by the chocolate not overwhelming the stout.

The flavor as also very surprising. I was expecting more smooth and chocolate milk-like. But I got more dark chocolate with a very nice hoppy kick at the end. There were also slight burnt malts happening. The mouthfeel is rather heavy and very rich. I am not sure I could stomach more than a couple of these.","MuddyFeet","Feb 27, 2005"

When it is 2 inches high when you pour it, and there is still 2 inches of head in the bottom of the glass when you finish. Aroma is chocolatey, and it improves as the beer warms. One of the best chocolate flavors I've experienced in a beer. I could not detect any hop flavor.

Taste was lighter than I expected, malty flavour with a nice chocolate note at the end. Really thought it would be a lot more chocolate like, but the double chocolate name is quite deceiving as its a quite subdued chocolate flavour. Has a nice and smooth mouthfeel with a little bitterness. Beer has pretty good drinkability, could see myself downing a few of these.

Aroma is more of real chocolate than chocolate malts. Taste is rich and smooth. Dark chocolate tastes are the strongest, though I think they should be even stronger. Mouthfeel is very creamy and enjoyable. Drinkability is great for such a dark beer, this isn't as heavy as I predicted. I really enjoyed Young's Double Chocolate, I think it could be beer nirvana if the chocolate flavor was even stronger. A great beer for dessert!","Gagnonsux","Dec 30, 2004"

As it warms up, the chocolate becomes even more pronounced. Amazing smells. Can really taste both chocolate malt and and dark chocolate or cocoa as well. Creamy, with a full body, smooth as velvet.

Heavily carbonated, could do with less (took some points for that in taste, it left me gassy the rest of the night). Otherwise, is an almost bitter, heavy malt flavor with significant chocolate tastes that become more prominent as you're finishing your sips. Very nice, true chocolate taste. Goes down alright, except for the extreme carbonation causing you to almost regurge. Overall, I'd get it again, but I'd have to prepare myself for the bubbles.

The color is an ice dark brown to black with no light coming through. The nose is full of dark chocolate, alcohol, and malty sweet scents. The flavor is a bit sour and very roasty at the beginning. Notes of raisin, tangerine, and caramel. A big contribution of chocolate malt gives it a good base for other flavors.

The widget did its work - the beer cascaded for a few minutes and left a half-inch cap of thick finely bubbled foam that hung around for the duration. Aroma is light and reminds of sweet malt, some chalky cocoa, a bit of roastiness. Flavor is thin at first, but gathers pungency as it travels. Cocoa yes, but it's light and allows other flavors to rise up like raisin, cherry, bitter coffee, and smoke from a smoldering fireplace. As the glass warms, resinous bark flavors and hints of whiskey arise. Like it says on the can, drink it cool, but not ice cold.","far333","Dec 05, 2004"

The finish is absolute creamy chocolate bar supreme. Mouthfeel is big and creamy and envelopes the whole palate with its broad range of texture and flavor.

The nose, taste and aftertaste are all dark, rich chocolate, with some espresso and faint alcohol accents.

It poured with a nice head and very nice lacing alnog the sides of the glass. Smells of deep dark chocolate. The carbonation ruined it for me though. Way too much for my taste. It was still good, but I'm used to the smoother ones. This one was rich and creamy, but the fizz was a bit too much for me. I also drank it a bit too cold I think.

When poured into an imperial pint glass, the body is deep brown in color and borders on the verge of being completely black, but indicates chocolate colored highlights when held up against the light. Other than the highlights at the edges, not much passes through the dense liquid. The head is a towering layer of foam, at least two inches thick initially, and has the color of a chocolate milk shake. After it dies down, it leaves a rich brown lace around the glass. The aroma is pretty mild, and the chocolate smell is clearly present, but does not overpower the other roasty aromas. Taste is sweet, but not cloyingly so. The chocolate is supplemented by flavors of raisin, rum, and dark roasted coffee. The aftertaste is dry, and has a bit of bitterness to it. The beer is a bit thin on the palette for a stout and has an earthy to chalky mouthfeel. A dark, mild beer, which pacifies your soul as it touches your mouth.","rajendra82","May 23, 2004"

It is silky smooth and creamy however, and the bitterness is balanced and slowly melted away by a strong milk and dark chocolate aftertaste. I did not detect any alcohol taste.

The aftertaste was on the bitter side – coffee and chocolate and slightly dry. This beer was light to medium bodied. Over all a good combination of sweet, roasted, creamy flavors in one glass. I really enjoyed this beer, and it represents its style well. Only thing I would have liked to see in this beer, is more body, alittle thicker.

Dark chocolate is the main event here, although notes of caramel, cream and sugar run their courses, as well. Drinking this is almost reminiscent of sipping a chocolate malt. The feel is incredibly smooth and velvety. Only minimal carbonation is present here, and it's hard to detect.

The draught can version of this classic stout, has far less character than the bottled version, so much in fact that I would recommend it as a baby step up from guiness.

Smooth as silk on the palate and clings to the inside of your mouth. Taste is bitter chocolate with hop overtones. This is by far one of my favorite stouts.","BierReise","May 17, 2003"
4.62,14.9,4,4.5,5,5,4,"Cool cascading effect. Very smooth and tasty with a creamy head. This pours a very dark color with a small head and moderate lacing. The chocolate is very evident in the flavor - which I love. I would like to have this beer again and again because it is so drinkable and smooth. I love it.","clvand0","Apr 27, 2003"
4.3,7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,"Pours to a dark brown color with ruby highlights. It forms a thick, creamy, light brown head that leaves excellent lacing. The aroma just hits you with a huge fudge, dark chocolate smell. There is a bit of roasty malt and alcohol in the end. The flavor is wonderful, with a bit of roastiness up front, then quickly you are hit wit the sweet, dark chocolate flavor. This is a full-bodied beer with smooth, silky texture, and a dry bitterness in the finish. I found this to be an excellent beer. Would be great with desserts.","BeerBuilder","Apr 24, 2003"
4.47,11.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer pours a clear very, very dark reddish brown with a very creamy (luxurious?) moderately large tan head. The mouthfeel is very silky and oily- quite nice. The smell is a tempting chocolate and roasted malts. The taste is very pleasant chocolate and roasted malt with a very mild hoppy finish. This is a very enjoyable stout that makes a wonderul drink after a meal yet I could probably(though I have never tried) drink it all night. One of my all time favorites.","fattyre","Apr 17, 2003"

Smells of very sweet and rich chocolate with a nice creamy lightness, notes of ginger spice and nuts. Taste echoes the smell, its got a good amount of chocolaty flavor thats sweetly bitter but not overbearing. It stays nice and silky smooth the whole way through with a good chocolatey twinge thats quite nice in the finish and feel. Some faint notes of hop presence and ginger and is medium to heavy bodied. This is a great stout for having around Halloween and the winter Holidays when everyone starts eating more sweets. Super yummy stuff.","tavernjef","Mar 31, 2003"
4.42,10,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall, it was definitely an intensely enjoyable experience. The chocolate was pleasantly present in both the aroma and taste, without overpowering the malts.

Aromas are full of roasted malts, coffee, and chocolate. The taste complements the aroma perfectly. Theres a slight bitterness upon first taste, but it matched exquisitely with the roasted malts and chocolate. This beer is exceptionally smooth, creamy, and easy to drink. It's absolutely delicious.","Scooter77","Mar 26, 2003"

When you expect something cloyingly sweet (chocolate in beer - """uff da"""!): Surprise! - a perfectly rounded and well balanced flavour, loads of chocolate but never sickly, just the right roasted bitterness in the aftertaste. This beer is a real treat - I would be happy to drink it each and every afternoon, but just one bottle a day!","Sigmund","Mar 24, 2003"
3.8,-5.5,4,4,4,4,3,"Pour is deep black, large medium brown head, slowly diminishes to leave good lacing. Aroma is strong on the chocolate, and some roasted malts in the back.

3.85,-4.2,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Very deep dark reddish brown appearance poured from an equally dark and beautifully shaped and labeled bottle. No head to speak of, but what little was there was tan and thin. This is a very chocalately beer as would be expected from its name. The label boasts silky smooth, rich and creamy, and that is no overstatement. This is very rich beer with a clean chocolate sense in both taste and smell. The unexpected finish comes from a strong final rush hop bitterness. Much less than expected aftertaste. We drank this after a nice meal and found it to be a perfect desert finish to the evening. Surprisingly enjoyable after an initial sense of being too sweet.","AtLagerHeads","Mar 12, 2003"
3.35,-16.7,3.5,3.5,3,4,3.5,"Taste: Again the roasted malt flavor and a bit bitter after taste. Some coffie flavors did come out but I was hoping for more of a chocolate, roasted flavor.

I will try it again to be fair.","Stubbie1","Mar 09, 2003"

3.29,-18.2,4,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Youngs Double Chocolate Stout: A deep black stout. The head is tan, not very tall but thick and long lasting. The aroma is very slight, it takes a lot and huffing and puffing to get a sense of the beer. The chocolate taste is there, but to me this beer is dominated by a smoky, almost burnt malt taste. Not as smooth as others of the style I’ve had, with some prickly carbonation. The aftertaste is there, but not a whole lot different than the first sip. Not worth the price I paid.","jackndan","Feb 22, 2003"
4.63,15.2,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Easier to drink than water, and if I could breathe it, I probably would. It's extreme chocolate flavor is it's savior and it's lone problem. There are simply times when chocolate doesn't go with what you're eating or times when it gets a little too sweet for taste. But make no mistake. This is one of the better chocolate stouts available.","marburg","Feb 14, 2003"

The aroma is dark roasted malt, with a hint of sweetness. The taste is a Solomon-like balance of dark malt and semi-sweet chocolate, with fleeting notes of cherry, raspberry, and burnt metal. The head leaves clingy tendrils down the glass as you drink. As it warms, expresso flavors join the malt and chocolate. Mouthfeel is thin, almost watery, with little carbonation. Some other reviewers think this brew is too sweet or gimmicky, but I am not one of them. One of my current favorites!","WaltTrombone","Feb 13, 2003"

This stout is so super smooth. I yearned for stronger chocolate in the bottle, and I yearn for it here too. The bottle seemed to have more overall flavor in it. This can seems kind of bland in a way. But it's not bad by any means. Nothing about this beer is """strong""". And that is definitely a plus when it comes to drinkability. I could easily and probably will drink the three other cans right after this one.","AudioGilz","Feb 12, 2003"

After the first sip I noticed it had a pleasant bitterness in it too, not TOO surprising was it? :) The sweetness is not overpowering either, it's very balanced in this matter. The most significant tastes is chocolate and coffee. Very thick pleasant mouthfeel.","Rocko","Feb 07, 2003"
4.12,2.5,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Drinkability: Since this is such a well-balanced beer, it is very drinkable. The combination of the chocolate bitterness and the alcohol complement each other nicely. Overall, just a notch below the Imperial Stouts in my book.","OldFrothingSlosh","Feb 07, 2003"
3.98,-1,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Love the look of a black stout as it settles, and this brew does that nicely. Thick tan shaving cream head and deep brown black body. The smell, not surprisingly, is of chocolate. What is different about this chocolate brew and others is that neither the smell nor the flavor goes overboard with the chocolate. The other noticeable characteristic in both flavor and smell was malt, again not over powering in either. The only weekness for this brew is in its mouthfeel - I like a stout to feel thick in the mouth, and this brew seemed slightly on the watery side. This, however, is overall a very drinkable and solid stout.","doho95fu","Feb 06, 2003"

Aroma is rich and malty, with an abundance of chocolate... almost smells like malted ovaltine. Flavor is a wonderful mixture of malty sweetness and slightly bitter chocolate... very smooth and rich. Hops play a role of balance... barely noticeable, but doing thier job. Has a smooth and creamy mouthfeel, and is full bodied. An excellent dessert beer.","zerk","Jan 29, 2003"

4,-0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a somewhat opaque dark brown to black. Nice brown head. I detect dark roasted malts and chocolate in the aroma. Smells like chocolate milk with alcohol. Taste is not nearly as sweet as I had anticipated. Tastes much more like dark bitter chocolate although some milk chocolate sweetness is present. Malt sweetness is well balanced by the hops although the sweetness edges out the bitterness in this battle. Good mouthfeel. Not overly sweet with good drinkability (I'd actually like to see a little more sweet milk chocolate flavor in this one). Overall, a good beer.","PhantomVodoo","Jan 22, 2003"
4.18,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Vertical pour of this slightly less than ruby red/jet-black liquid forms a beautiful yeasty thick meringue pancake of a head. Beautiful to watch the downpour of thin bubbles sheet down the glass. Low on carbonation (or should I say nitrogenation), as most nitrocanned ales are. Aroma is suprisingly close to Guinness nitrocan, with an added dose of sweet milk chocolate. Mmmm...velvety smooth texture, amazingly rich pillow-soft mouthfeel, crisp clean finish with a hint of grain, freshly shelled walnuts and cocoa powder. Hops are only there to balance, never becoming intrusive. The only downside to this heavenly brew is the subtle metallic and cardboard notes in the aftertaste. These become more prominent as the brew warms, but don't really become a bother. Thank god they are only subtle, for this brew is highly drinkable.","Mitchster","Jan 17, 2003"
4.18,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours an almost black color with a thick and creamy tan colored head that fades into a nice sticky lace that coats the sides of the glass while drinking. Nose is fresh coffee, sweet roasted malts, and milk chocolate. Smooth, creamy, thick, and chewy in the mouth with tastes of bitter dark chocolate and a sweet maltiness. A very nice stout that goes great with dessert.","Morris729","Jan 16, 2003"
4.07,1.2,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Pretty nice pour. Deep brown, almost black in color with a dense velvety mocha colored head. The head hangs in at about 1/4 inch and doesn't change until I drink it up at the end of the glass. Smells like Bailey's Irish Creme--chocolate milk with an alcohol kick. Tastes of semi-sweet chocolate, some malt character too. As the beer warms closer to room temperature, the tastes intensify a little. Mouthfeel was pretty thin for such a rich looking brew and carbonation is low. A good dessert beer.","cretemixer","Jan 15, 2003"
4.15,3.2,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"It was incredibly silky in the mouth, a real pleasure to drink. The beer was more like chocolate soda or Yoo-hoo then I remember.

This was still a different, enjoyable stout.","yen157","Jan 13, 2003"
4.39,9.2,5,3.5,4.5,4.5,5,"I recently tried Rogue's Chocolate Stout and was really impressed, however this one blew that out of the water. The main reason for this was probably the nitro charger in the can which gave the beer a """icecream-ish""" mouthfeel, and also lended to quite a show while waiting for the head to form in the glass (which remained the entire time and was very creamy). Definite chocolate taste, especially in the beginning. Slight bitterness showing towards the end but overall quite a treat. As one user described Rogue's stout as """chocolate milk for adult""" I would describe this as the chocolate shake for adults.","nixhecks","Jan 11, 2003"
4.35,8.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours almost completely black with just hints of ruby/amber on the edges. A substantial foamy, tan head with some lacing. The smell is dominated by creamy chocolate scents with a hint of underlying roasted notes. Taste is quite sweet throughout the drink, starting rather light-textured and even a bit hoppy. A rich taste of chocolate truffles comes through toward the end, culminating with some dryness. As in the smell, roasted grains are present but somewhat muted. The light but rich taste and dry finish lends itself to a nice mouthfeel and a better-than-average drinkability for a stout.","BitteBier","Jan 04, 2003"

It also seemed less complex in flavors.","mrjimcat","Dec 26, 2002"

Some hop flavor to balance the malt with a slight hint of licorice. Finishes slightly dry. Very easy to drink. Incredible.","Lupe","Oct 20, 2002"
4.3,7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"The stout pours inky black with a moderate tan head that lingers and then drops back to a generous collar on the inside of the glass.  The aroma is mild chocolate, from both the chocolate malt used and the actual chocolate added to the beer.  The taste is smooth and silky chocolate with a slight hop bite in the finish to balance the wonderful sweet flavors in the beer.

4.03,0.2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Just love the way the nitro-can beers seem to have the head cascade down through the beer and back up to the top.  The head on this beer takes well over a minute to settle out from the nitro can, and it stays thick and creamy throughout the entire time you drink it.  When it is too cold, there is very little flavor.  As it warms, the chocolate and earthy hops aromas arise.  The flavor exhibits a bitter, dark chocolate or cocoa taste with roasted malt and a very thin yet creamy mouthfeel.  It has a nice bitterness on the finish with a hint of sweetness and that dark chocolate note.  A good beer with not as much chocolate as I presumed it would have, which is a good thing.","aaronh","Oct 17, 2002"

The chocolate is wonderful, and something you won't find in many other beers, but the body is fairly light (perhaps a bit too light for a stout) and the finish is dryer than one would expect.  Perhaps a bit thin for something billed as a luxury double chocolate stout, but it works!  Very drinkable.","mzwolinski","Sep 04, 2002"

Was I ever right.  The deep dark color and thick foamy lasting head were the introduction I was yearning for.  The first taste of this heavy bodied brew was just liquid heaven.  The smooth roasted tootsie roll chocolate flavor is jsut what I was hoping for and made my day.

The appearance is what you would expect, black with an enormous brown fluffy head. For some reason, I found the smell to be a bit off, and IMO it certainly did not fit with the thick sweetness of the beer.

3.18,-20.9,4,3.5,3,3,3,"This dark ruby colored brew pours a huge brown head, foamy and rocky.  Aroma is of cocoa bean and java.  You can actually taste the chocolate in this brew (maybe because they actually use real chocolate in the recipe).  Can taste baking chocolate.  Bittersweet is predominant.  Coffee and vanilla bean tones also surface.  Pretty light in body for a stout.  Maybe medium at best.

4,-0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Black with moderate tan head.  The aroma was of coffee and chocolate.  The flavor was more of roasted coffee and the chocolate faded to the background.  As the beer warms, the chocolate flavor lessens and becomes more roasty with maltiness coming through.  A good stout, although I do not like it as well as my drinking buddy Bigemail.","ryanocerus","Aug 07, 2002"
3.98,-1,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Very deep, opaque brown/black color with a thick tan head that holds up well and gives some nice Belgian-lace. The aroma is of a slightly sweet dark malt like bittersweet chocolate. The medium body and restrained carbonation level give a soft, creamy mouthfeel. The flavor is very lightly sweet with just a touch of roastiness against a light bitterness. Well balanced but somewhat lacking in character for it - not very much punch. The finish is light and leaves a pleasant, lightly dry and roasty aftertaste. Immensely drinkable. I once felt that I preferred the nitro-can version because it has such a soft, silky-smooth and creamy character, but I now feel that the bottled version is more enjoyable as it appears less sweet and slightly more complex.","NeroFiddled","Aug 02, 2002"
4.55,13.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Now we're talking. Great deep dark color, chocolate malt scent. Like a Guiness with Hersheys syrup. I LOVE this beer. Very smooth as well. Not something you want to drink all night but a few do the trick.","Jdiddy","Jul 16, 2002"
4.5,11.9,5,5,4.5,4,4,"ChocoLOT man!  Dude, where's my chocolate.  Dude it's in my beer.  Sweet!  Pours a very very dark color (maybe black...but hard to tell in this low light).  The head started out at 2 fingers and with a rather dark color for a head and dissipated fairly quickly.  The smell, well there's definitely chocolate in it.  The taste, well there's definitely chocolate in it..and surprisingly, it is rather good.  It isn't the most balanced beer and as rich as the chocolate is, I would have to stop with this one after a couple or four.  It was a pleasant experience for a change.  Choco-Cheers!","BeerAngel","Jul 08, 2002"
2.75,-31.6,4,4,2,2.5,2.5,"I feel like the Grinch on this one. This was a very sweet-tasting beer and reminded me of Guinness with Hershey's syrup mixed in. Great aroma and appearance so I'll score it high there, but the sweetness was a bit overwhelming on the palate. If you like chocolate or sweets, then you might like this as it offers a range of tastes that run the gamut from bitter to sweet.","proc","Jul 02, 2002"
4.5,11.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"By and large, this is one of the best stouts on the market. The chocolate aroma is apparent from the very get-go. The head pours nice and thick and stays there for quite some time. This brew is very smooth, sweet, and and cream-like in its consistency. This is what I like to call a knife-and-fork brew...it is the beer that drinks like a meal. I agree with the Advocate review in that there was a hint of licorice towards the middle of the glass. If you like this brew, and even better, if your wife likes this brew, invest in a case at your local beer emporium, like Shangy's here in Pennsylvania. This is a must-try. Bottoms Up!","goindownsouth","Jun 25, 2002"
4.42,10,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Frothy tan head. Black body, with just a hint of ruby. Excellent lacing. Wonderful aroma of roasted malt, chocolate, licorice, and a tiny bit of coffee.  A hop tingle joins in the mouth, while the coffee and licorice fade away, but it is the roasted malts and chocolate which dominate the taste. An outstanding dessert beer or nightcap.","RonfromJersey","Jun 23, 2002"
4.01,-0.2,5,4,4,3.5,4,"Chocolate anyone.  Downward cascading, interesting to watch.  Dark brown with creamy brown head and lace.  Rich, creamy, chocolate malt. Almost too smooth. The nitro can I had produce a beer that was slightly weak and flat.  Nevertheless it was still delicious.","ThreePistols","Jun 16, 2002"
4,-0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"inpenetrable black color, big foamy head that died quickly.  nice chocolate malt aroma, like chocolate cake in a bottle.  higher than expected carbonation makes it slightly less smooth than i anticipated.  not very complex in taste, just a slight roasted bitterness on top of a big bittersweet chocolate malt profile.  not too sweet, with a hop bite in the background.  this didn't knock my socks off,  but very solid nonetheless.  especially if you are a fan of chocolate and beer, which i am.  would be delicious as a dessert beer with a hershey bar.","budgood1","Jun 09, 2002"

4.35,8.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Although there no real chocolate is used in the making of this flavorful stout, plenty of chocolate malt is. Starting with strong roasted flavors and a good balance of dryness and malt, the chocolate becomes very apparent in the aftertaste.","stoutman","May 27, 2002"
3.65,-9.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I am always on the lookout for good stouts and porters. I am not a big fan of chocolate flavor in a beer, but I still found this to be a good beer. Wonderful dark brown almost black color and a medim tan foamy head, plus an interesting smell of chocolate that was almost overpowering. The body was a bit weaker than I would expect for this type and the flavor was overpowered too much by the chocolate in my opinion. I thing Rogue's version does a much better job of maintaining a balance.","Wildman","May 24, 2002"
3.95,-1.7,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Lots of chocolate and malt flavours, a good beer from Youngs, which makes up for all there bad ones, quite rich, not too complex, but damn tasty, if you've got a craving for chocolate, look here.","rastaman","May 14, 2002"
4.08,1.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Another downward cascading """creamer", cool """curly maple""" pattern. Tan head, warm brown beneath, dark brown at the bottom. Chocolate malt (as in the soda fountain drink kind) aroma. Very creamy and slightly chocolatey taste, silky, thick, and malty. Zero hop cut to my tongue. One of my favorite Sweet Stouts but a little limiting when you're seeking out complexity. More non-beer drinkers need to check out brews like this.","ADR","Apr 30, 2002"

4.52,12.4,5,3,5,5,5,"I had this one in the 14.9 oz can with the widget. I thought it was great. Pours deep jet black, with a nice big creamy tan head. The head stayed on mine until the end, falling down the glass perfectly. Big chocolate flavor, didn't really notice much else. Unbelievably smooth and creamy. Remember when Homer Simpson made his deal with the devil, the first of his 3 wishes were """chocolate beer !"""  Well this is it. The smell was average, other than that, this beer gets my highest compliment """magic in a glass."""","StevieW","Apr 06, 2002"
4,-0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a very nice black w/ a nice fluffy tan head that doesn't last that long.

3.95,-1.7,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,"When held up to light this brew is as dark as a stout can be without being pitch black. It's actually very clear with no haze and exhibits a very deep garnet hue. Beautiful creamy light brown head with excellent retention. Sweet (real!) milk chocolate aroma is nicely combined with a chocolate malt note. The Young's signature yeast pearish fruitiness of course adds to the complexity as well. Medium to full body that is almost oily. Although the aroma may suggest that cocoa may dominate the flavor profile, the combination of real chocolate, chocolate malt, roasted barley dryness and hop bitterness meld well. This is a flavorful stout and is highly drinkable like most of Youngs brews. I do feel, however, that this brew has been dumbened down in the last couple years. It could be my imagination or changing palette. In any case, get it in the bottle. The nitro/ CO2 widget in the can kills the taste.","marc77","Mar 13, 2002"
4.7,16.9,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"On tap. Amazing. Unbelievably creamy and smooth. Delectable and tempting, like candy. A sweet, crisp, milky and wonderfully balanced brew. Alcoholic kick nestled comfortably within the chocolate. Dense head, thick lustrous body like the best the UK has to offer. I got some surprisingly fruity sensations that I couldn't quite identify, but loved anyway. Some beers just make you shake your head and say wow; this was one of those for me. (I later tried the take-home versions. The bottle's good, but the can is a disppointment.)","Thrasher","Mar 12, 2002"
3.88,-3.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Black opaque color, malty aroma, soft semi-sweet chocolate taste, malty aftertaste.  Full bodied, satisfying and smooth but not great.  I agree with the other reviews that it was like a tasty chocolate milkshake.","John1985","Feb 25, 2002"

This is the second best stout, giving way only to the incredibly smooth delicious Oatmeal Stout from none other than Youngs. Very pleasing to look at as well as drink.
