I think the thin mouthfeel would classify it as such for me and with a stout it'd be thicker...overall it's a good beer especially if your looking for a coffee stout.  i'm not disappointed and have really wanted to try this but there are better representations of this style on the market.  Alewerks does produce some really good beer and I would pick those over this in their line-up.","upton7418","Feb 21, 2015"

Huge coffee aroma just like a cup o' joe, some lactose like sweetness, a little cocoa, roasted malts. Mmmm. Flavor is very espresso forward, some lactose sweetness to balance out the super earthy bitter coffee, light chocolate and roast. This is sweet but nicely integrated with the earthy espresso. Loving the coffee and lactose sugar combo. Medium mouthfeel on the thinner side (not a knock, as this isn't an impy--plus I burned the shit out of my mouth today so it may be the carbonation on the burns that make it feel thinner as it is super smooth and rich on my lips and given the low ABV this has a nice body going on) with a nice velvety mouthfeel.

This is a little different - a coffee stout that tastes like actual coffee - not roasted espresso aromas, but the bitter, eye opening drip coffee taste. It makes for a nice change of pace from big, high abv stouts, and there is a decent amount of residual sweetness to balance out the bitter. Dark (surprise!) coffee color, light lacing.

3.17,-20.2,2.5,4.25,3,2.5,2.75,"I like my coffee black and my beer to have a decent malt presence, so coffee stouts are generally right in my wheelhouse. This one makes a fine but common first impression, with the pour producing a deep, nearly-black brown color, but it is topped by only a fine wisp of a coffee-foam head. The aroma drastically improves my expectations, with a rich, roasty, iced-coffee aroma over more subtle notes of bittersweet cocoa and caramel malts. The flavor lets me down, though, by being surprisingly sweet compared to the aroma, with a heavy caramel malt backbone that overwhelms the roast and coffee characteristics. The texture likewise detracts, with a low-level of carbonation that results in a moderately syrupy feel that further enhances the sweetness. Overall, the beer showed promise, but the over-sweetness and under-carbonation were harmful flaws to the experience.","devilben02","Apr 05, 2013"

The sweetness of the lactose in this milk stoudt help to mellow out the acidic bitterness. I like that the coffee essence smells like fresh roasted coffee beans instead of black coffee.

Good selection.","Rifugium","Sep 02, 2011"

Smell combined notes of spent coffee grounds and melted semi-sweet and milk chocolate - not the best notes individually but pleasant. Taste brings an initial dry and roasty coffee character but it is quickly covered up by notes of mocha and chocolate fudge. Fuller side of medium bodied, solid creamy feeling combines with a light powdery quality. A nice sweet stout with some quality flavor notes.","rfgetz","Aug 28, 2011"

Smell is of rich chocolate syrup, chocolate bars, and slight coffee aromas. Taste is of chocolate covered espresso beans covered in chocolate syrup. A nice roasted coffee bean bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. The mouthfeel is a bit thin with a low level of carbonation.

4.32,8.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"12oz bottle from grape & gourmet. pours slightly thick and utterly black as night with a thin, light beige head and sheet lacing. aroma blew me away. huge dark roasted coffee, praline, cocoa, and a hint of dark fruit. flavor was amazing as well and truly matched the aroma. tastes of rich black coffee, dark chocolate, sweet caramel, and hints of vanilla,with a lingering bitter coffee finish. mouthfeel is thin and a bit watery which is the only true knock on this beer. overall, a delicious brew. like a poor-mans breakfast stout. Geoff is certainly doing solid work at AleWerks and if this one is any indication, i can’t wait for the new brewmasters series. *UPDATE* new batch from January 2010: wow, has this one gotten even better. much more expresso-like on the nose and the flavor boasts new subtleties of toffee, cinnamon, graham cracker, and ash. the palate, which may have been a bit thin in the first batch, is much silkier and rich on the tongue. great work, geoff!","ksurkin","Jun 26, 2011"

The nose comprises a sweet coffee mixed with a velvety rich dark chocolate. Some roasted malts, a clear prerequisite as per usual, finish things up in the back. There may or may not be a small amount of maple syrup in there as well. Just sayin'. The taste leans a bit more toward the chocolate end, but the coffee remains, staunch as ever. It's a very simple combination, but it's done to near perfection here. Very tasty. The body is a sleek medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a decidedly smooth feel.

I looked at other reviews in advance along with my thoughts on AleWerks in the first place (decent, but nothing special. This beer poured a sexy looking black abyss into the glass, topped off by a wonderful brown foam that had decent head retention. The smell was of quality coffee, and you can tell from stout to stout which one was made with burnt leftover gas station coffee and who uses the premium stuff. This is premium stuff. Aside from the obvious coffee aroma there was a touch of vanilla and perhaps some nutmeg. The taste was quality like the aroma, but a tad on the sweet side. Much sweeter than I take my coffee, but I'm putting this beer on par with the CW Brewhouse Coffee stout. This thing is up in that pantheon for coffee stouts. The mouthfeel is pretty slick with the standard medium slightly chewy mouthfeel that most stouts should have. This is an easy beer to take down. I wish I had this around me at all times, but alas I have to hope for it in extras. If you see it, buy it, it's that good.

The brew was medium in body with a low amount of carbonation which had a sweet, roasty burnt char, slight astringent, and silky finish.
