"Sour mash smell up front. Vanilla, coconut, milk chocolate, Bourbon and oak. Medium to thin mouthfeel, minimal sweetness and dry. Pretty delicious."
""
"Mouthfeel is smooth and silky. Overall, not bad, but nowhere near my list of great barrel aged stouts."
""
"This beer must have got infected. Tastes sour."
"overall complete mess of a beer and with a price tag of $15 its a never again buy fool me once"

"Revolution Brewing Very Mad Cow -----4/5."
""
""
""
""

"Had it on tap at the brewery. Looked straight black and smell had hints of coffee. Taste was smooth and sweet, made me think créme brûlée. Honestly, was a little too sweet for my liking and not as thick as I would normally like a stout this alcoholic to be. Still a really good beer overall, but not one I'll be hunting down."

"O: I bet I'd like regular Mad Cow a lot, but the BA version didn't do it for me. I'd say the barrel flavors aren't integrated with the base beer, so that it tasted more like a milk stout with an ounce or two of bourbon thrown in. Consequently, the bourbon overwhelms all the sweet, creamy cocoa and vanilla flavors that I suspect are present in Mad Cow. As this is my third disappointing BA beer from Rev., I'll be passing on all such future releases from them. Except, of course, Straight Jacket."

"This beer was pretty good."

"Best of the barrel aged series from revolution in my opinion"
""
""
""
"The flavor holds a whiskey sour cocktail tone, strong milk chocolate, coconut and vanilla. This is strong, smooth and delicious."

"OVERALL: Decent stuff, but not overly special. I remember enjoying the original Mad Cow a bit more than this version. The milk stout has taken a bit of a back seat here and the barrel isn't all that impressive anyways, making this somewhat mild and mundane. Still, it was easy to drink and I'd drink another if it were offered. Cheers again Masterski."

"Overall - This is among the best bourbon aged beers I have ever had. If you are able, get it."

"Overall a very nice beer, there are some clear distinctive flavors going on, nice balance and not hard to drink for the booze content."

"Poured into 22oz snifter; jet black with a thin fizzy tan head that fades quickly into a thin ring of foam. Smell is big bourbon; fermented bananas and dark fruit, vanilla, oak, sweetness, and some dark sweet chocolate malt, and coffee. Taste is sweet chocolate, bourbon, slightly boozy dark fruit, burnt sugar and slight bitter coffee. Very sweet, but balanced with a perfect dash of chocolate/coffee bitterness and very slight alcohol heat (especially for 9.5%). Mouthfeel is creamy-smooth and pretty full. This is the second best BA stout I've had, beat only by BCBS so far. Awesome."
""
""
"Pretty good sweet stout, and it has me curious to how the base stout tastes without the barrel aging. Sweet enough to be a sweet stout without reaching Chocolate Rain or Dark Lord levels of residual sugar. Though the bourbon notes were low-key, I'm taking that to be a positive, as I was pretty happy with the flavors that were pronounced in this one."

"Certainly worth trying, I bet this is even better on draft."

"O: Nice bourbon barrel milk stout. Don't get a lot of barrel-aged milk stouts. This one is nice, bourbon is quite prominent but very tasty (I believe Woodford Reserve? My favorite bourbon, so I'm biased). Interesting mint flavor, pretty mild but I'm curious where it comes from. It's similar to the mint chocolate flavor from the Stone Mint Chocolate Stout collaboration from last year. Tasty and enjoyable."

"A damn fine barrel aged sweet stout that I would definately buy again at half the price. Quite enjoyable but the cost makes it a one time purchase."

"O - Exceptional and underrated when considering the overall score. This beer is a real find."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very enjoyable beer.  Will likely be an annual purchase, although it's not as cost justifiable as some of the others in the Deep Wood series.  Had the 2014 on tap and remember it seeming a little richer."
""
"M - Medium body but somewhat watery at times. Moderate carbonation."
"O: Much better on tap than in the bottle, but still a good beer. Not worth the price tag in my opinion - the bourbon and base beer don't tango well together and leave a kind of confused, mild product"
""
"Bottle purchased at the Revolution tap room, poured in a FFF teku. Aromas - very boozy with some vanilla and general sweetness. Body is thinner than I would like. Appearance not-quite-black. Sweetness - you'll know this is a milk stout. I found the carbonation level appropriate for the style."
""
"Overall: Very drinkable barrel-aged milk stout. The sweetness is really good at complementing the bourbon and malt flavors. It's a very enjoyable beer to drink after dinner and that's really its main role. I very much enjoyed the relative balance of sweetness and bourbon. (4)"

"A damn DAMN tasty beer that at 16 bucks a bottle is worthy of a try though splitting it might be a good idea as this isn't upper echelon."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a nice beer that suffers from a bourbon barrel character that isn't completely integrated into the base beer. I feel that a little more time in the barrels or in the bottle would have helped the beer come together better. The bourbon character is really nice though and the whole experience is a lot like sipping a bourbon. Very tasty but with some noticable flaws."

""

"(O)- Overall, a superb barrel aged stout. So smooth and creamy yet having great bourbon barrel notes. Sadly, this might get overlooked by all the other bigger barrel aged stout releases out there, but this is one great offering by Revolution!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Clearly Revolution knows what they're doing when it comes to barrel aging. This is a very balanced, well done beer. Yet, it doesn't do enough to really stand out from other options."
"O: I was left hoping for a bit more refinement. Just didn't feel like it was completely integrated and developed. A bit raw on the bourbon barrel elements. Honestly, I was disappointed with the $16.99 price tag too, but I try not to factor that into my reviews."
""

"O: a nice brew for sure, but its shockingly light on the feel, which pushes this beer just slightly off. its complexity is lacking, but it definitely works for this beer. the bourbon and the barrel notes are truly the main players in this brew. If this was just a bit more viscous, it would definitely be an A+ in my books."
"Overall: Nice to try this one and actually enjoyed it quite a bit. The feel was the only real let down for me."
"This was sent time from mjmadsen21, major thanks on this one man! This beer poured out as a nice looking black color with a brown head on top. There is a moderate retention and lacing. The aroma on this beer is huge, it screams bourbon, it's sweet and boozy and strangely addictive. The taste of the beer follows the nose, lots of bourbon, chocolate and vanilla with a boozy wooden flavor in the finish. The mouthfeel is pretty slick, lightly carbonated and finishes with some ethanol heat. Overall I loved it, I think if anything there is maybe too much bourbon and it masks the a dual beer, but either way I thought it was great."

"O- too bourbon forward! Overpowers base beer."

"I have been impressed with both BA offerings I have now had from Revolution. Milk stouts arent usually my style but this is a nice beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a great BA stout by Revolution. I like Bean Gene much better though. My biggest hold up is the thin body. Other than that this was a great brewery only offering from the windy city!"
""
""
""
"Why would you wanna piss a cow off that much, anyway? Regardless, this stuff pours a deep black-brown topped by a finger of tan foam. The nose comprises chocolate cake, bourbon, and a twinge of coffee. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some light cardboard and some mild roasted malts. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid-ish feel. Overall, a generally tasty and enjoyable beer. I wouldn't say that the barreling really injected the base with a significant amount of better-ness, but it certainly didn't hurt it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very glad to have had the chance to try this one - thanks dsal!"
""
"O: This was very enjoyable. We are fans of Mad Cow and had hoped that more of the characteristics of it would've shown through. We weren't disappointed (in the least)...more like we are intrigued as to what this will be like in a few years...and what the next batches of this will be like."
""
""
""
"A nicely made bourbon stout. It didn't knock my socks off, but was still enjoyable to drink."
""
""
"The bourbon characteristics in this beer are incredibly high, in aroma, flavor, and aftertaste. So much that it throws the base off balance in a sense. Additionally, it is quite light on that signature, decadently silky creaminess that is a staple of milk stouts. Perhaps it's too young of a beer, and with a year or two on it the intense bourbon will fade from being overbearing to a pleasing, balanced component."
""
""
""

""

"One year has done wonders for this-glad I cellared. Ratings reflect. Actually has become more complex."
"Pours a clear dark brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, bourbon, and wood. Taste is much the same with a smooth bourbon finish and a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is really tasy and smooth."
""
"I thought this was a really solid b.a. milk stout. In fact, I don't think I've ever had a milk stout from a barrel. Everything about this was subtle, but in a good way."
""
""

""
""
""
"O - A nice BA milk stout that could use a bit more time before it's really ""on"". That said, I easily finished my pour and would have again if offered up."
""
""
"O: this is the second barrel aged treatment I have tried of Mad Cow, and I must say this one leans towards dissapointment. While this wasn't a bad brew by any means, Revolution has been holding it to such a high standard and I feel this one is a little short of that."
""
""
"A quality stout. Full bodied with more complexity on the aromas than the flavors."
"Any nuance that Mad Cow had is completely obliterated by the barrel this time around. It's straight up Woodford, with some feeble cocoa and mild roasty stout notes peeking through. Definitely lost any smooth creaminess and sweetness, it's astringent and boozy from the barrel. Flavors are still good, just a bit harsh and bourbon focused. Seems like it would benefit from a little blending with standard-issue Mad Cow to smooth the rough edges."
"Very dark with a thin tan head and plenty of lacing. This is heavy on the whiskey and oak notes, with the lactose only showing up in the taste, and that late. I like the bourbon-into-sugar development in the taste, but ultimately the bourbon is a bit much. I guess I like my milk stouts sweet? Creamy, rich mouthfeel--I was happy to drink my snifter but probably would not want another."
""
""
""
"D - Like this a lot more than most milk stouts, found it very good and went back for at least one more pour before the night got hazy. Good stuff I would like to have again."
"D - This stuff is awesome. I went back for numerous pours throughout the event. I hope it makes a reappearance at the pub soon (and that they allow growler fills)."
"T- If i had six livers I would drink this all day!"
"Pours near black with a thin mocha head that persists for a bit before falling to a thin cap. The nose brings a very strong bourbon presence. A bit heavy on that and the booze right now, though it is nice. I think this will develop well, it just needs a bit more time. The taste adds a bit more complexity with a bit of roasted malt and some chocolate. A bit of sweetness counteracts the boozy nature of the beer. A bit too much alcohol in the feel, but is nice and rich. Drinks pretty well overall. Wish I had a bottle or two to age for a bit."
"Another above average barrel aged from Cibak. This is worth trying."
"Overall another solid offering for RevBrew. Glad to see them consistently creating good new brews."
