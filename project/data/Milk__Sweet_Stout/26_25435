At 6+ months old, I would say any hoppiness this beer had has been muted. It's a delicious beer for sure. I'd like to try one fresh and see if it has any more of a presence.","do_ob","Feb 12, 2015"

The scent carries roast and hints of chocolate and espresso. The taste is much like the scent....roasty with touches of milk chocolate and coffee. The mouthfeel is full in body and very creamy...LUV IT! Overall this is one heck of a solid stout. VERY NICE!!!","WoodBrew","Jan 26, 2014"

Strong coffee notes on the nose; unexpected, but not unpleasant. Cocoa and malt notes follow. Much like the aroma, coffee is the first flavor to hit the palate followed by bittersweet chocolate and brown sugar. There's a faint bitterness throughout the taste, not overwhelming but enough to notice. The flavors evolve as the beer warms, quite complex. Very velvety and smooth, with a full body and light carbonation. Overall, although I'm not a fan of the style, I found this to be a well crafted milk stout.

4.24,2.7,3.75,4,4.5,4.5,4," Pours black with a very thin mocha head that disappears quickly. The aroma is mainly milk chocolate and espresso. Some slight dark fruit notes around the edge. The taste is very balanced with heaping helpings of dark chocolate and espresso much like the aroma. Add to that a nice hint of smokey goodness and very soft fig note. Very drinkable but at the same time thick. Very sticky on the palate. ABV is completely hidden. Ive never dug to deep into the milk stout world but I have to say from the milk stouts I've had this one is among the best.","screamking","Sep 06, 2013"

Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of roasted flavors. Taste of milk chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, toffee, toast, oats, coffee, cream, dark bread, earth, and light herbal spiciness. Lingering notes of milk chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, toast, toffee, oats, coffee, cream, dark bread, and light herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice flavor balance and complexity; great roasted and sweet flavor balance; and zero cloying sweetness present after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish.

The mouthfeel is silky smooth, medium body, my esophagus enjoyed that massage, no alcohol detected.

4.55,10.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Shiny black body and served with a one finger dark tan head. Great retention and significant lacing as the head recedes. The smell of roasted malt, notes of cocoa, and a light sweetness. Opens with light roastiness, joined by a mild hint of semi-sweet chocolate and light mild malted milk ball-like sweetness that is perfectly balanced with roasted malt. Medium to full-bodied, extremely creamy and silky smooth. In my opinion, Moloko sets a standard for milk stouts. Extremely balanced between sweetness and roastiness with a velvetly smooth presence on the palate. Just remember it certainly packs a punch with an undetectable 8% abv, higher than might be expected, especially for a milk stout. Its exceptional drinkability can make Moloko deliciously dangerous.","chanokokoro","Aug 12, 2012"

Served from bottle into a NoDa snifter. Poured dark brown with a minimal light tan head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sugar, cream, and dark chocolate. The flavor was of sweet malt, milk, dark chocolate, and milk chocolate. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. This brew is what I think of when someone asks me to describe a good milk stout. All of the right flavors are there in all the right intensities and balances. I really wish that would have tossed something into this one to take it to the next level. Really great brew that Iâ€™m glad I got the opportunity to try. I suggest you do the same.","thagr81us","May 30, 2012"

3.85,-6.8,4,4,3.5,4.5,4,"Moloko pours a stout black, with a viscous tan crown of foam perched three fingers high atop the beer. It just sits there for a minute and looks like a chunk of caramel colored cake. There's a pretty nice ring of lace that shows where the beer hit its high point, but lacing is a bit spotty below that. The nose takes a minute to really start to shine through, but when it does it smells like what I'd imagine a good, strong coffee does after it's been cut with some cream and sugar. The flavor carries that same general idea. There's a sugary, creamy edge to the coffee flavor, too much so in fact. It's almost as if vanilla is the primary flavor here, and coffee is just a supporting player, when it should be the other way around. The body is superbly creamy, with a nice low level of carbonation that stays out of the way. The result is a very smooth mouthfeel that makes this beer almost like drinking a dessert. I don't know there's just a touch too much lactose, or it's something else, but Moloko is a pretty good milk stout that could be great if a bit more roasty flavors come through.","axeman9182","Aug 26, 2011"

I really can't shake the I-just-brushed-my-teeth flavor after I thought of it. This really tastes like I am trying to drink an oatmeal stout after brushing with some toothpaste. Some strange almost chemical dryness that only slightly suggests milk fat or sugars. Some nice carob and chocolate notes that mix well, but the carob wins out where it might be better for the chocolate to. The way the carob lingers accentuates a light hop note. This combines with some dryness makes for a strange mustard-like linger. I don't know what to say, the flavors aren't bad, but where it takes me is questionable. Good but not, decent but miss-able. Easy to drink, but hard to buy.","Cavery","Aug 17, 2011"

Very nicely done here, reminded me right off the bat of Valdez the first time I ran across it. I was anxious to dive in so I took the first sip and that was all she wrote. Huge coffee flavor, just so sweet and ridiculously smooth. Blended perfectly with a rich brown sugar and vanilla note, with smooth milk chocolate coming in to save it and giving off a wonderful creamy feel. it was like nothing I had before.

Flavor had a nice roasted malt base, golden oats, milk chocolate, mild coffee, tons of lactic, and light bitterness to it. There was a quite a dose of milkiness, but it seems light on the texture. Mouthfeel is light and silky and the carbonation on the low side. Might had tasted better fresh, perhaps?

Taste is very good but I am just not sure it is right for me. Probably take some getting used to since it is my first milk stout. Carbonation is a bit low but I am guessing too much would be weird with this type of beer. All good but I can't see being able to drink much of this.

The malt and alcohol in this one are immediately present to the nose, backed by mexican vanilla, maple syrup, and just a hint of red fruit. The taste is strongly nutty at first, though it opens up into a mix of bittersweet chocolate, earthy malt, and an unexpected note of dark red fruits. The mouthfeel is pretty spot-on for a stout, solid, but not heavy, and mild enough carbonation to bring out the deeper flavors while avoiding being flat or flabby. The mix of sweet chocolate and tangy red fruit keeps this one from being clingy in the least, making it quite a drinking-friendly beer, despite the occasional taste of alcohol.","sdawson","0"

Body is actually fairly light and easy to drink considering the cream component in the beer. Alcohol wise I would guess it to be in the 5-6% range as I occasionally taste a touch of it but its not overpowering. Flavor is in line with what I would expect to be a sweet stout and I would put the sweet finish as being lactose. Milk stout is my guess on this one. This is pairing very nicely against the Velveta Bacon mac'n'cheese with tuna I made for dinner. The salt and sweet are a good contrast with both having a slightly similar cream component.","neorunner","Sep 18, 2010"

The nose comprises oat flakes, coffee, dark chocolate, molasses, sweet carob, and a hint of astringent in the back (though not enough to turn me off of sniffing by any real degree). The taste is somewhat similar, holding notes of bitter dark chocolate, maple syrup, molasses, oatmeal, raisins, light coffee, brown sugar, cinnamon sticks, and hot cocoa. The body is a heavy medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a kinda syrupy feel.

Moderate amount of spotty lacing is left on the glass. I expected more from a beer in appearance with oats in the recipe. Does not really have a milk/sweet stout aroma. Rather has a more straight up stout aroma of roasted malt with hints of unsweetened chocolate and espresso. I found things to pick up some in the flavor. Nice chocolate notes before the roasted malt takes over. Just semi-sweet overall. Has a nice mocha finish. A good body but nothing outstanding. Lacks just a little texture to take this to the next level as it feels a touch thin. Good flavor, slightly sweet, and a reasonable ABV makes it a nice, drinkable stout.

The oats and lactose addition give this a smooth, creamy mouthfeel with just a bit of carbonation to complement the sweetness to come. The taste starts with a nice blend of subtle mocha and molasses. The lactose note comes in midway, providing just a slight lemon creme flavor that quickly gets beaten into submission by the espresso roastiness that dominates the finish. For me, this is a good thing: I don't like lactose to take center stage as it tends to provide a tart soy note that seems out of place to me.

Big cocoa nose gave impressions of chocolate/coffee milk. Taste consistent with nose, but some acidity comes out as well as a creamy character.

If their intention was to create a drinkable summer stout, I'd say they accomplished that. I think this is a pretty good sweet stout, but not as good as the Bells or Rogue offerings. I think 3F might be given a bit too much credit in it's other brews based on the reputation of the Dark Lord.

4.15,0.5,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"pours a solid deep dark brown with a moderate head of milky tan. smell is balanced; sweet and malty. nice density: light carmel malt qualitys. sweet yet somehow fruity. a light acidity, not lactic but cirtrus from the hops. subtle tart in lactose. as it gets warmer then seems to have a caramel apple quality. very interesting... not the milkiest but quite good.","rtepiak","Oct 27, 2008"

This is unlike any other sweet/milk stout I've ever had. I'm not usually into sweet/milk stouts, but this one is great. Very creamy and full on the mouthfeel. This is a very good beer, and it isn't overhopped in the typical FFF way. Very well done FFF, very well done.","FtownThrowDown","Oct 08, 2008"
4.27,3.4,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"This beer pours a dark black with just some light brown accents when held up to the light. A very thin brown head appeared only for a few seconds before it dissipated into nothing. The nose on this beer hits pretty well upfront with roasted grain, vanilla, coffee, and bitter chocolate. The flavor profile starts with the lactose sweetness on first sip and quickly balanced out by the chocolate/coffee-like malt. As the beer warmed I got just a touch of dark fruit in the background. The mouthfeel is full bodied and very creamy with plenty of sweetness after the swallow as well. The drinkability at only 7% is really nice, and would be a good entry point for people that may not like stouts. I personally really enjoyed this stout.","TheodorHerzl","Oct 03, 2008"

Nice, sweet chocolaty tongue with just a hint of bitterness. mouthfeel is a little light but leaves no aftertaste and is very well rounded. Easily drinkable.

The aroma of this stout was very faint roasted malts with some milk chocolate. The flavor was of soft milk chocolate and mild roasted chocolate malts. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied with a creamy, nitro carbonation. This stout had excellent balance, and the heavier alcohol was very well hidden behind the other flavors.

Smells somewhat of roasted nuts and smoke but mostly it was lactose and half & half that I got. Taste went the same way. A bit of a smokyness to it and a nutty base but it was just so strong in the lactose. Quite sweet, too sweet really. And I agree with Hobo, lots of vanilla seemed to be in here. Reminiscent of Mackeson but not quite as good from what I remember of Mackeson. Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for this and I would love to try it again. This was a Milk Stout to the extreme and I credit the brewers but I don't know if doing some styles to the extreme always works.","granger10","Nov 12, 2005"
