4.09,6,3,4,4.5,3,4.25,"Overall: An enjoyable milk stout, all maltiness and sweetness, with just hints here and there of more bitter flavors. It's an easy drinking brew that doesn't necessarily encourage sipping so much as drinking. Anyone criticizing this for being ""too sweet"" is confusing milk stouts with some other kind of stout.

It is so dark and thick that it felt almost chewy in texture and taste. Notes of chocolate and slight caramel come through part way into the glass. The creaminess lingers in the mouth long after I expected. Overall, spectacular beer; one of my personal favorites.","sheeley","Aug 05, 2014"

A nice beer, but just not enough body in my humble opinion for me to give this as outstanding rating. To date, I think Tallgrass' Pale Ale (8-bit) and their IPAs (Ethos and Oasis) are better. Don't get me wrong, the taste itself is great, the whole minus here is the fact that the overall body is thin.. perhaps a bit more of a transitional stout.","paladinjoe","Apr 27, 2014"

Very nice aroma, right on for the style. The taste is similar to the nose, starts of with the lactose sweetness. This is followed by a dry and sturdy punch from the roasted barley. This features loads of flavor and is exactly to style. The moutfeel is somewhat thin with mild carbonation. Overall, this is a delicious milk stout.

The appearance is that of a dark brown ale or perhaps a lighter porter, It has a deep caramel color, but not much more than that. The aromatics have a very sweet corn/maple syrup aroma with some raisins hanging around in the back. The taste is quite enjoyable. A good mark for the first thing that I've ever had from this brewery. The taste mirrors the smell with an addition of what seems to be toasted malts and oats. The body is rather thin, but the flavors do a good job of helping with that. It goes down way too easy especially considering the high level of sweetness that this beer gives off. Overall, impressive, something for the Sunflower State to hang their hats on.","Vdubb86","Dec 05, 2011"

It's very creamy- almost like a beer cream soda in consistency. Definite chocolate, coffee, and something else I can't quite put my finger on in the taste.

It's smooth and sweetish, but balanced; and I love how the berry-like yeasty-fruitiness stands out against the caramelish, nutty, and fudge-like maltiness. And it's also very toasty, like darkly toasted bread crust. It's not particularly roasty (although it does have a coffee-like edge), and it doesn't have any of the biting, dark-malt acidity that can sometimes be detracting. The bitterness is limited but it somehow holds together without ever hinting at becoming cloying; and the hops are kept to a minimum, allowing the malt to be the main focus. I do get some of the ""milk stout"" sugary sweetness, but apart from that it's almost like a porter, or a darker and more malty brown ale. It's a little bit unique; and readily drinkable.

Nice lacing coating the sides and making it super sticky. Aroma is coffee and sweet sugary notes. Hints of chocolate coming through now. It was an odd coffee aroma, almost a dark, french press kind of smell, which played off the sweetness in the milk stout extremely well. Really impressed here as even as it warmed it seemed to never dull. Rich, creamy feel, almost as thick as a milk shake. Creamy chocolate and rich velvety coffee notes slide together perfectly and leave the palate soaked in sweetness that is simply wonderful, and that is an understatement. Each sip becoming richer then the one before. Long lasting flavor of coffee balanced on the tongue and left a slightly dry finish soaked in vanilla notes.","mikesgroove","May 29, 2011"

The taste is just like the aroma, with a good balance between the sweet and bitter flavors. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a little on the thin side but also a bit coating with moderate carbonation. It's smooth and very easy to drink.

The beer seemed a little watery (not the tast but the thickness of the liquid) and I prefer my stouts to be a little thicker but the actual taste put that to rest... This reminded me a lot of a toned down Breakfast Stout with the heavy coffee aroma and flavor taking and up front and center part in this beer and the sweetness and smoothness was outstanding...

It's nice to have a tallboy of a Kansas brewed sweet stout. Aroma has sweet creamy dark chocolate and coffee notes going on with each sniff, no real herbal hop profile just nice sweet dessert like notes from the dark roasted malts and lactose additions. Drinks very sweet with hints of dark chocolate(cocoa) and mild coffeee notes, a bit of herbal hops and a tad more earthiness would help dry out the overt sweetness a bit. The lactose additions give it a super creamy factor, enjoyable flavor just overtly sweet compared to most of the stouts out there. Mouthfeel is again not to be repetitive but this beer is super creamy on the mouthfeel, carbonation is ample but works well with this medium bodied session stout. Overall thoughts thus far are best of the lot from what I've had, I enjoy IPAs and DIPAs with the best of the beergeeks out there, however this is one rockin' cream stout.","WVbeergeek","Apr 26, 2011"

4.19,8.5,4,5,4,2.5,4.5,"Very dark brown, tiny bits of lighter tinges around the edges. Head was a nice two fingers of medium brown head. The head must have been late, late for a very important date, as it dwindled down before I made it back to the computer, leaving practically nothing in it's wake. No matter, the aroma was brilliant, and I quickly stopped caring what the damn thing looked like. Not a coffee stout, but fresh dark roast coffee filled my personal space. Big roasted notes and bittersweet chocolate vie for limelight as well, along with sweetness and brown sugar. Quite intoxicating. The taste didn't disappoint either, though didn't wow quite as much. Coffee tastes were not as prevalent, giving way to more of the chocolate sweetness, roasted malty notes and sugary bits. The feel brings it down a notch. Felt a bit too watered down, and lacked a bit of substance that would have aligned the planets and knocked this out the park. In the end though, it doesn't detract too much from this brew as a whole: It's an amazing smelling, very tasty stout, worthy of keeping at hand.","EgadBananas","Mar 24, 2011"

Now I have and its a bit distinct. The flavor is a watered down version of the aroma. The chocolate is there but its weak. Coffee flavor reminds me of the work coffee where people only use about 1/2 of what they are supposed to. The aroma is enjoyable but the flavor is just weak. The mouthfeel is also rather watery.

3.57,-7.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Tallgrass Buffalo Sweat Stout pours a thin head over an opaque black brew. Carbonation seems relatively active, though, as is always the case with stouts, it's hard to tell, inky blackness being inky and blacky. The nose is pretty typical too- roasty coffee and bitter chocolate mostly, with notes of molasses. The flavor is also pretty typical- charred ends of fresh baked bread, a note of baker's chocolate off the back, a little herbal hop in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is surprisingly light and crisp- maybe a little too light for a stout, and semi-dry. Just a tad one dimensional, this beer might be better thought of as an introduction to stouts, or even as a session beer, since It doesn't seem that alcoholic. Not bad, but not that distinctive- I do like that this is one of a growing number of canned craft beers.","shadow1961","Nov 02, 2010"

3.72,-3.6,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"D: A pretty decent sweet stout. The best part about it for me is that it isn't too sweet like some others I've had.

I initially got a finger-and-a-half of mocha-tan head, but it was fading pretty quickly in the face of tonight's humidity. Color was an inky dark, not quite black thanks to the deep-brown at the edges, but dang close. Nose was ... what did I say about chocolate? This was like a liquid milk chocolate bar. Save the Reese's for a dry stout. This would be at home with a simple Hershey's bar. A quick diabetes reading and I am good to go. I CANnot take too sweet a beer as a hophead. Mouthfeel was full, almost creamy and now I am shaking the CAN for the presence of a widget. Nope, just naturally that thick. Zounds! Finish was equally creamy and sweet, like a chocolate milkshake. Winner! I probably would not want more than one, but this would be a great accompaniment with dessert.","woodychandler","Sep 03, 2010"

3.75,-2.8,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Solid black color with a small tan head that hangs around for awhile. The head settles to a thin cap. Light spotty lacing is left on the glass. The aroma is just what I would expect a stout of this style to smell like. Balanced between the roasted malt and the lactose sweetness. The flavor is a little sweeter than almost any other stout and that is what I guess the brewer was shooting for. Some bitterness from the roasted malt but overall this is a rather tame stout. The body is also just a touch thin. In my opinion a little overcarbonated as well. A very approachable stout that is nicely crafted. Just a little too sweet without enough malt character.","morimech","Aug 29, 2010"

Chocolatey and roasty. Body and mouthfeel are very weak. Watery and thin. Hardly any body at all. Not very creamy. Very little carbonation. Flavor is pretty dull as well. Baseline roast and coffee, but pretty weak. This one does not impress me. The other two I had from this brewery did however. Their Canned IPA and Canned English DIPA.","Bighuge","Aug 25, 2010"

3.67,-4.9,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"A dark black color with a fair chocolaty tan head and decent lacing. The aroma says goodly malt and charcoal with deep grass, decent. The grass holds on to dominate the flavor with more sweet molasses malt. There's lots of charcoal with meager carbonation, smooth and medium-plus bodied and reasonably drinkable. There's some red wine and charred oak. Qualities of the aromal dominates but the taste is decent. A nice try at a stout, worth sampling for sure.","Durge","Jun 22, 2010"

Smells of sweet malt, roasted malt, slight oatmeal, yeast, slight coffee, grain, slight hop, hint of pale malt, and a hint of earthy malt. Fits the style of a Milk / Sweet Stout. Mouth feel is sharp and creamy with an average carbonation level. Tastes of oatmeal, sweet malt, slight roasted malt, yeast, slight hop, hint of wood, hint of coffee, and slight alcohol. Overall, good aroma, blend, body, and complexity.","Tone","May 02, 2010"

Light amounts of alcohol mingle with creamy vanilla also noted. Mouthfeel is a bit on the light side, carbonation is good, soft. Roasted malts dominate the palate but not too aggresively. Light amounts of sweetness noted. A touch of creaminess. Aftertaste hangs around for a while but doesn't bring anything new to the table. Very easy drinking.
