Lots of chocolate in the aroma with some gentle roast. Nice lactic edge. Loads of milk chocolate. The taste is similar. It's medium sweet with lots of cocoa flavor. The relatively mild lactic note keeps the beer from getting cloying. Plus, there is very little of the cola flavor that I tend to find a bit overbearing in other examples. Mouthfeel is creamy and gentle. They filled this growler right up to the top, leaving nearly zero head space, and the beer kept very well. Pretty much perfect for the style. Very impressive stuff. I'm not the biggest milk stout fan, but this is just how I like them.","popery","Dec 04, 2013"

4.23,1.4,4.25,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"Poured from a 750mL growler into a shaker pint, the beer is a dark, ruby highlighted, blackish color with a frothy, light, creamy tan colored head that quickly settles into a chunky, sparse, surface coating. Aromas of dark roast coffee, sweet caramel, smoke, dark chocolate, a touch of char/campfire, and a hint of cream. Smells like a bitter, robust, rich beer. Flavors are cream forward, quickly underscored by a bitter roast coffee character. Chocolate and caramel blend in the backbone to sweeten the brew a bit further, but the scales still tip to bitter and smoky. This is a campfire beer, and a very drinkable one, at that. Tasty. Light, smooth body that is slightly dry to remain within the style parameters. The aftertaste is cream and coffee, with a touch of the campfire smoke still present. Slick, slightly bitter, dry finish. This is a good, solid, drinkable beer.","GarthDanielson","Aug 10, 2013"

I could easily drink multiple glasses of this and it is definitely one of the better local MA beers being produced. I definitely recommend checking it out as well as other beers from Tree House.","jaasen64","Jan 08, 2013"
