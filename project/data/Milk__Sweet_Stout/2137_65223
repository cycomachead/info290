4.23,9.6,4.25,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"This beer is one of Breckenridge's better offerings.  It's basically a milkshake with alcohol.  You definitely taste the cream and the chocolate up front, and it's pretty smooth too.  Seems like they do their best work with the darker beers, as I'm also a fan of the Vanilla Porter and the Oatmeal Stout.  This is a small-batch offering sold in 4-packs, so if you find it, pick some up if you like this style.","dcscientist","Mar 17, 2015"

4.03,4.4,4,4,4,4.25,4,"3/3...pours very dark black, light ring of tan foam. Dark chocolate nose, espresso coffee too. Hearty creamy taste, bold coffee bitter swirls into creamy milky smoothness. Not unlike chocolate milk. Beyond smooth, loaded with flavor.","KTCamm","Mar 14, 2015"
4.52,17.1,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Brew pours pretty close to a pitch black in color with just a hint of ruby-highlights near the top. Close to a 1-finger foamy beige head is seen. A good amount of ring-lacing is seen after each sip. The aroma is very nice and is of sweet chocolate and dark roasted malts for the most part. Bit more going on with the taste with some milk, sugar as well as a light hint of coffee in the mix also. Very smooth with no bitter or harsh aftertaste at all. Medium-bodied with lower carbonation which most milk stouts have. Really tasty and would drink this again!","BeerWithMike","Mar 11, 2015"

I'm not sure what kind of barrels were used for the barrel aging, but it seems like a bit of bourbon. Whatever the case, the barrel aging quality is subtle, adding to the basic sweet stout styling without stealing the show with too much alcohol heat and woodiness. Deep, complex, and well-balanced throughout. A very nice stout.","beergoot","Feb 20, 2015"

4.25,10.1,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"on tap at the brewery, i was really impressed with this one. a deep dark stout, not overly sweet from the addition of milk sugar, and not overly chocolaty, but the contributions of both make this beer unique. i like that its not overdone there, lets me drink a stout first rather than a flavored beer like their vanilla porter is, the accents are subtle, and the beer is rich without being too sweet. dense matte black brown in color with just an inch of tan head in the stubby tulip. the nose is dark roasted malt with a hint of cocoa and coffee there, but definitely grain first, the flavor is similar, but instead of a dried powder cocoa on the chocolate side, its more of a melty dark chocolate, still bitter, but much more silky and decadent. the body here is only medium and the alcohol doesnt show through at all. i really like this one in a holiday context, think its far better than some of the other breck beers, and would rank it up there with the best chocolate beers around right now. sturdy without being filling, very well put together here.","StonedTrippin","Nov 20, 2014"

3.91,1.3,4.5,4,3.75,4.25,3.75,"Pours an opaque brown black with a frothy mocha head that lingers. Chocolate and cocoa counter nutty and roasted malt in the aroma. There's a touch of dark fruit tartness, and a hint of tar. Flavor is on the sweet side initially, with chocolate melding with light tart cherry underpinnings, finishing slightly roasty and a touch bitter. Nutty, toasted malt waves throughout, but chocolate sweetness rules the day. The tart character prevents it from being cloying. A little short on the roasty stout character and heavy on chocolate. Guilty pleasure of a beer.","barczar","Jul 25, 2014"

A surprisingly muted aroma of roasted chocolate malts with coffee tones. The flavour is more robust, with a nice blend of chocolate milky creaminess and coffee grounds' bitterness in the finish. Roasted dark and chocolate malt tones in the body transition nicely from caramel sweetness to hop bitterness. There's enough dark and milk chocolate flavours to suit the name without being cloying. Mouthfeel is oily, as befitting the 7.2% ABV, but increased carbonation would help my personal enjoyment of this bottle.","hopsolutely","Dec 01, 2013"

The nose comprises roasted malts, cocoa powder, sweet coffee, and a hint of vanilla bean. The taste brings in more of the same, though the cocoa is a tough more bitter now; it's not quite dark chocolate, but it definitely seems to approach that designation. Meanwhile, the roast takes a stronger role, and the vanilla nearly vanishes. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a mostly smooth feel. Overall, a solid stout, one that doesn't overdo it with the chocolate and yet still maintains a healthy dessert-like quality. Good times.","TMoney2591","Aug 18, 2013"

This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth and the flavors held my attention well, I could drink a couple of these, but this isn't the type of beer I would session, it has good drinkability for the style. What I liked the most about this beer was the how true to style it was, it was just what I want and expect from the style and it had good balance, the appearance was also pretty good. What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeel, it wasn't bad, but it would be nice if it was just a little thicker. I would buy this beer again when looking for a nice Milk Stout, I enjoyed it and it was priced right so I would buy it again and I would recommend it to anyone who likes the style. All in all I was happy with this beer, I've been let down a couple time by Breckenridge, but this one turned out pretty good and I would for sure be interested in trying more of their brews. It's not a favorite Milk Stout, but I think it's good and an enjoyable example of the style. Good Job guys, this beer was better than I expected.","StoutHunter","Apr 19, 2013"

Good soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, toast, bread, and dark fruitiness. Ok aromas, but are quite muted and overly fruity. Taste of milk chocolate, toast, biscuit, roasted malt, caramel, raisin, prune, and light herbal. Lingering notes of chocolate, toast, caramel, roasted malt, dark fruits, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Pretty good flavor balance, but not as roasted as I was expecting; with a bit too much fruitiness. Minimal cloying sweetness. Medium carbonation and body; with a nice creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish noticed. Overall this is a decent cream stout.

4.2,8.8,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Pitch black body smooth creamy light beige khaki head, forms thick with fine bubbles. Even speckled lacing left behind, aroma comes off a bit muted with shades of dark chocolate and cream. A bit of toffee and caramel with dark roasted malt base this smells balanced not too dessert like. Sharp sweetness cream based, with roasted malts bringing dark chocolate and hints of mild coffee. Smooth balanced and drinkable flavors are well coordinated, it's a very nice beer especially as it warms up a bit even more flavor bursts. A hint of sourdough tartness or yogurt like quality is in there, and it actually works with the sweet and lactic notes that come with a good cream/milk stout. Impressive beer from Breckenridge, I'm glad I didn't give up on them their imperial series typically doesn't disappoint. Mouthfeel even flowing carbonation creamy textured, medium to full bodied. Not a harsh bone in it's body, smooth all day very nice impy cream stout. Overall a beer I would recommend to friends and dedicated beer drinkers alike, excellent quality from first to last sip.","WVbeergeek","Jun 17, 2012"

The taste is moderately sweet, creamy, mocha. The mouth feel is surprisingly thin for a stout and probably the weakest aspect of this beer. The 7.2% ABV is well hidden. There is no bitterness.

However, for a chocolate stout I was expecting more chocolate in the flavor. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy and goes down easy. It's a decent enough brew overall, I think it's worth trying.

There isn't much chocolate but there is definitely a moderate amount of coffee. As it warms to room temp there is a tad bit of cola and slightly chocolate syrup. The flavors are initially a lot of chocolate syrup and cola with a light roast in the finish. It certainly is a sweet stout. It drinks medium in body and very smooth, leaving behind a sweet milk chocolate flavor in the aftertaste. It drinks nicely and isn't cloying. It's a solid beer.

Rich and semi-sweet aroma of chocolate, cream, and some coffee, though the chocolate does not shine like I would have hoped. Kind of a weird flavor profile to this, throughout the sip there is this thin but sharp sweetness that hits you alongside the regular flavors of some roasted malt, liquorice, and coffee. A mild chocolate shows itself in the after taste. Thinnish mouthfeel like I have come to expect from Breckenridge's dark beers. Overall, an alright beer that probably isn't worth buying again.
