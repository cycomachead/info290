"I was disappointed, got a nutty nose, and some bitter chocolate, I was hoping for more of a dessert beer"
""
""
"Taste was odd, reminiscent of coke with spices in it. Not a beer I would drink again."
"Had the SixPoint Peanut Butter Shop Ale in 2013 and DuClaw Sweet Baby Jesus Porter in 2014 and I really enjoy this peanut butter style of beer. I eat peanut butter with a spoon straight from the jar so this is a real treat combining two of my favorite foods. I highly recommend trying this if you like peanut butter. It’s a great beer if you are looking for something different and enjoy the taste of peanut butter."
"Decent PB flavor, not as strong on chocolate notes. Big roast finish."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown color with an off white head.  Lacing is left behind on the glass.  Aroma of peanut butter, cocoa and grains like Reese's puffs cereal.  The flavor starts with chocolate malts, blending into peanut flavor ending dry and toasty.  Full bodied ale with medium carbonation almost creamy."
""
"This is a good beer that I would drink again, but I will not actively seek it out."
""
"Peanut butter bomb, and I loved it. I let my wife try it and it was the first time she has asked me if I can get some more. Paired this with New Glarus Belgian Red for a faux PB&J, next time will try with NG Strawberry Rhubarb for the ULTIMATE PB&J."
""
""
""
"Overall I really enjoyed it for what it was. It's a sweet desert stout. Not something I would always grab for when looking for a stout, but I can imagine many times when I'd want to sip one of these and experiment with pairing it to other foods."
""
""
"Although I don’t have the same sweet memories from childhood towards peanut butter, and how weird it sounds adding beer to the picture, I did enjoy this. It is an unusual combination that worked quite well."
"22 oz bottle. Pours a black color with a small layer of brown head. Fantastic and unique aroma. Lots of lacing. Chocolate milk, peanuts, cocoa, caramel, honey, coffee and roasted malts. The taste is somewhat reminiscent of Reese's Pieces. Peanut butter, dark chocolate, roasted malts, coffee and sweet lactose. Finishes with more chocolate milk and peanut butter. Not overly sweet. Lightly carbonated with a light mouthfeel. Somehow this beer works very well. Overall, one of the best Milk Stouts I have ever had."
""
"Overall: Disappointing, especially after so many people said this is a great peanut butter stout.  I figured this being a milk stout it might be pretty good, maybe like a peanut butter cup.  No such luck.  Weak on flavor in my opinion.  Give me Sweet Baby Jesus over this any day."
""
""
""
"Very delicious, wish it was easier to come across especially in New York."
""

"awesome peanut butter aroma and taste!! Go get it!"

"Glass- Imperial Pint"

"The aroma reminds me of walking by a coffee shop. The flavor is chocolatey, peanut buttery, with the standard stout coffee notes. Great beer overall."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- possibly the best tasting peanut butter stout/porter that I've had.  Seemed to be some carbonation issues, but other than that, very good"
""
""
"This brew has a really good, creamy taste. It goes down smooth but is just too sweet for me. It is a good beer to have once in a while but not exclusively. Fantastic look and feel."
""
""
""
"Not a very distinct peanut butter flavor but a good smooth stout."
""
"Lots of chocolate ,peanut butter , and boiled milk aromas. Same with the taste"
"This is a great beer to have."

"Got in a trade with RaulMondesi. 22 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours clear very dark brown/black color with a 2 finger fairly dense dark tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of huge milk chocolate, cocoa, peanut butter, vanilla, caramel, toast, light coffee, cream, and roasted earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and peanut butter notes; with great strength. Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toast, vanilla, peanut butter, light coffee, cream, and roasted earthiness. Light roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toast, vanilla, peanut butter, light coffee, and cream on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity, balance, and robustness of dark/roasted malt and peanut butter flavors; with a good roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Peanut butter flavor is not as big as I expected given the aromas, but still has good presence. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and fairly creamy/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with no warming present after the finish as expected of 5.3%. Overall this is an excellent peanut butter milk stout. All around great robustness, complexity, and balance of dark/roasted malt and peanut butter flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Overall, not pleasant. Maybe I got a bad bottle."
"Way better than I thought it would be! It was smooth and creamy and did in fact taste like peanut butter. The peanut butter though was nicely integrated into the beer."

"Thank god my buddy brought it over, I will drink this any time i can find it"
""
""
"O: When you looked at the label and imagine how the adjuncts all work together, you probably did not have a good first impression. Fortunately, I am a man with very weird taste, and weird, outside the box adjuncts are of my interests, if done right. Cheers to you Belching Beaver (and all my So.Cal. traders that keep sending these as extra!)"

"AT FIRST GLANCE, I THOUGHT THIS SOUNDED HORRIBLE, PEANUT BUTTER FLAVORED BEER!? WAS I WRONG. I FELL IN LOVE WITH THIS BEER AT FIRST TASTE AND I CAN'T GET ENOUGH. IT TASTES BEST WITH A STEAK OR ANY OTHER MEAL WITH BEEF. AS ONE REVIEW SAID, ""IT TASTED SO GOOD,  I ATE THE BOTTLE"". HE WASN'T KIDDING."
"Absolutely love love love . By far one of my top favorite 5."
""
""
"Dark brown pour and an off white head..smells like a peanut butter chocolate bomb...taste is mainly peanut butter and a little chocolate on the back end with a slightly creamy mouthfeel..overall very good.. A little better mouthfeel with a touch more chocolate in there would make it world class in my opinion..but still a damn good tasting beer"
""
"Bottle: Poured a deep brown/black color stout with a medium size off-white foamy head with OK retention. Aroma of butterscotch and hazelnut with quite a bit of residual sugar is a bit surprising. Taste is also dominated by butterscotch notes with some hazelnut with quite a bit of residual sugar. Body is about average with good carbonation. A bit too sweet for my own taste and I could see the butterscotch notes becoming over the top if I was to drink too much of this beer."
""
""
"I love peanut butter and I love beer.  Two great tastes that tastes great together. Peanut butter + beer. Who knew?  I know that this many people say this is not real beer, but I can't help but love this beer. Honestly it is amazing going down.  Creamy,  mild and quite pleasing with a velvety peanut butter finish.   I really really like it. This beer will become a huge, huge national hit."
""
"I've had a few Peanut Butter beers in my time.  This one did not impress.  To me, the Peanut Butter tasted too fake, like that cheap halloween candy you used to get as a kid.  The mouthfeel was a but thin for me.  Smell was decent enough, promised more than it delivered."
""
""
"The flavor was really nice."
""
"Very smooth, full body with acceptable light carbonation."
""
""
"O - This beer reminds me of 2 other great desert beers that I can drink a lot of - Hardywood Gingerbread Stout and Southern Tier Creme Broulee. Yes it is sweet but just about the time the flavor leaves your mouth you're reaching for another taste.  I have to get more of this beer!"
""
""
"smells delicious. it also tastes delicious. it's like a dessert for my taste buds"
"Sampled on tap at LTH in Oceanside.  Pours a very rich dark brown, nearly black.  Beautiful fluffy tan head and salty, roasted but nose.  Taste is fudgey, brings to mind a DQ buster bar.  Mouth feel is viscous and slick.  Very much Dessert in a glass.  Interesting for a change of pace."
"Overall: very tasty well rounded. Easy drinking for a stout could have more than one at a sitting not overly sweet."
"Unique and delicious, partly because the taste is nicely balanced and not overrun by peanut butter."
""
"Better than i thought it would be.."

"Poured from a 22 oz bomber into 16 oz snifter. A: nice dark cola-like color with about an inch of tan head that disappears rather quickly with almost no lacing afterward. S: probably the best part of the beer in my opinion, deep chocolate and toasty goodness, almost reminds me of my sister's coffee drinks, alcohol is hidden very well in this one; my only complaint is the peanut butter is almost at the back end of the smell, you kind of have to search for it. T: very good flavor on this, peanut butter flavor is kind of masked on the flavor as well, hop bitters on the front of the tongue do this beer very well and with a sweet finish, it tastes very well balanced, I could definitely drink multiple beers without getting tired of this! M: feels nice and thin, but not watery, a very nice feel, even for a stout. Overall I would say this is an exceptional stout, I would definitely buy this again, maybe multiple bottles at a time."

"Definitely taste and smell of peanut butter, more so than the Karl Strauss version (which is a porter) but very good overall."

"Strong peanut butter. Hints of chocolate and coffee. Best milk stout I'd ever had the pleasure to taste."

"Overall a great beer; exactly what it sounds like, which is great to me. Really smells like peanut butter and works really well all around. I loved this, highly recommended."
""
"Decent stout. This is a little lighter on mouth feel than I would expect from a stout. Color is black as night. This beer scores points for it's peanut butter nose and taste. First sip coats that palate with a delicious peanut buttery stout beer combination, which continues throughout."

"O: I'm a traditionalist as far as beers so I find this beer gimmicky but very good if that makes sense I love peanut butter and this beer delivers but I feel like it was added to the beer instead of blending. I want a beer to just naturally exude a peanut butter flavor rather than it being afterwards added and overbearing. Very bizarre review I know."
""
"22 oz Bomber.Poured into a 20 oz Firestone glass a dark black color.The smell was chocolate and a touch of coffee.Up front the taste was Peanut butter,chocolate and Coffee with a touch of bitterness.Very original taste which I have to say I liked very much.Some people might say it sounds bad but with these flavors blended together it is really quite good.Give it a try."

"At first glance I'm giving this a 4.  I'm hearing there is another peanut butter stout with a slight edge over this one... looking to compare the two and re-review."

"Belching Beaver has spurred the milk stout into something that is more than a mere novelty item. This won't be the last time I have a Peanut Butter Milk Stout from these guys."

"Taste great to me."
"Finishes sweet, buttery, fizzy, and dissipates quickly"
""
""
""
""

"The bottle suggests using the beer in an ice cream float and I will definitely purchase it again and try it!"
""
"Nice dark hops, smooth with just a slight taste of peanut butter. Not overbearing where it is gimmicky. A very good choice for a milk stout lover"
""

"One in a long line of beers that smells like nirvana (without the smoking gun) & tastes good. Still, I chose to have it twice in the span of one week. Bottle up that smell, Beaver!"
""
""
""
""
""
"One of my new favorite beers. The flavor, and aftertaste is perfect. A great smell. You get the peanut butter on the nose and taste. A great beer to pair with a dessert. Some milk, slight milk chocolate notes as well."

"o:  better than the regular stout.  the combination of peanut butter/chocolate/graham/lactose in here balances out nicely.  its only 5.3% so it drinks pretty easy, yet manages to give a little bit of stickiness in the mouth.  normally i don't like the amount of fizziness level that this has, but it actually works well to cut the richness from the peanut butter & chocolate flavors."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great peanut nose.  Taste has a great peanut base...not overly though.  Very thin bodied for a stout.  Would have liked it to have a bigger body.  Seemed more like a porter to me.  Really enjoyed it though.  Would definitely have again."

"Fell in love with this beer the moment I took a whiff and my first sip. The world needs more low octane delicious beers like this. Easy creamy mouth feel. Love the coffee/dark chocolate on the palate. Hint of peanut butter for a peanut butter lover is magic. I'll be sad if this beer ever disappears from the face of the earth."

"Pours up opaque black, no head. Only quickly fading dark brown bubbles. No lacing. No problem. Aroma is big 'ol peanut butter! Big chocolate, dark roast coffee, vanilla extract, smells like a chocolate store and a coffee house had a friggin baby! Taste is peanut butter! As well as all the flavors in the nose. Full body, low low carbo making it a smooth operator. I've only had one other peanut butter beer and that beer didn't even taste or smell like peanut butter. This brew is the tits! Wishing that I lived in Cali right about now..."
""
""
"If I ever have another brew calling itself a Peanut Butter beer that doesn't involve doughnuts and bananas, it has a BIG chore ahead of it to come close to what this here brew has accomplished."
""
""
""
""
""
"On first buying this I thought why not great name and heard heaps about so why not but after the look and smell I thought I'm in for something else anyway it pours the darkest kola hue with a cappuccino laced two finger head and lacing here and there,on smell it's just like smelling a jar of crunchy peanut butter along with chocolate and nuts,the mouthfeel is medium bodied and moderately carbonated with strong tastes of peanut butter,milk chocolate,coffee and finished with a salty dryness and overall this has to be the most truest to style of a peanut butter stout and being a peanut butter fan I would def drink this again cheers."

"This is a great milk stout. I'm usually skeptical of novelty or ""niche"" beers, but this one is outstanding. Beautiful cola color, smooth mouthfeel, and subtle profiles of roasted peanuts, coffee, and caramel malt. A great treat from a great find."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall pretty nice, a big time dessert beer, nice peanut butter mostly aroma but some flavor, nice cookie dough and wafer biscuit cookie, caramel, chocolate and milk chocolate, layers of candy bar and malted milk ball, although still maintained a decent milk stout and stouty beer base. Fairly enjoyable, although the peanut butter wasn't as strong as I hoped in the flavor."
"Overall: I find this an excellent intro to the world of milk stouts. A great dessert beer! The nose is a bit subdued, but it tastes great, feels great and doesn't have the offensive bitterness I've experienced with other stouts. I'll be coming back for some more!"

"Overall this beer is what you expect from the name itself. It's a good beer to share with friends that want to get into craft beers. If you dont like peanut butter, its not for you. Cheers!"
"Overall: Good medium bodied stout. Complex enough to be interesting, but not so much to prevent me from taking big gulps. Nuttiness distinguishes it, but does not overwhelm the other flavors."
""
""
""
"A very interesting effort: strong peanut butter taste and aroma with faint chocolate and bread flavor. I've read comparisons of the flavor to that of a Reeses Peanut Butter Cup. I feel that this tastes more like a liquid Nutter Butter cookie. This has the mouthfeel of a beer with a much higher ABV. Very tasty, and I don't even like peanut butter!"

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, milk chocolate, and peanut butter aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa powder and chocolate covered peanut butter cup candy flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that has comes across as a bit astringent in the taste and more balanced in the smell."

"What an absolute treat and underrated brew."
""
""
""
"overall, it's okay. i'll try the regular milk stout to see how that is. for the 5.3% abv, I suppose it's quite what I expected...."

"O-Overall it's a Reese in a bottle! Awesome!"
""
""

""
""

"Overall: Outstanding stout, worth a try and a I am not sure if I like the peanut butter but it's a stout worth sharing and drinking again. First time for Belchin Beaver and I will have to give their other beers a try."

"NUT up in your mouth! It is all about this beer. I cant say it is a technically peanut butter flavor. More just a nutty flavor. Interesting finish, almost more like a brown ale. More carbonation than usual. Fantastic smell of peaNUT. I have had it 3 times now from a 22. Interesting beer worth a try. I am imagining it on nitro."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: I really enjoyed about half of my beer. After that, the taste got real medicine-ey on my tongue. Just something wasn’t quite working for me here."
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall this is a tasty milk stout, for sure, but the peanuts on the taste are rather lacking. Wish the nose translated over more."
""
""
"T: Opens with a mild roasted malt mixed with a touch of peanut butter. Light milk chocolate and a touch of vanilla round things out. Mouthfeel is light, but the lactose really helps things out here. Nothing insane, but a pretty tasty beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Eventually there is a little nutty taste slipping into the sweet burnt sugar malt flavors. Quite an interesting brew-- you just need to be in the mood. Really smooth and sweet without being sugary. An undertone of bitterness keeps it from cloying, but without raising much attention to the subtle hops. One of the best flavored stouts I've had, and without a doubt the best Milk Stout. But crazy."
""
""
""
""
"Not as much peanut butter as I would have helped, but still very, very good. I’d have it again."
