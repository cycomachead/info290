Pours very dark as it should but with a thin head and light lacing. syrupy but a bit on thin side for the mouth feel with very light carbonation.  Strong on sugar and light malt scent and flavor but not enough notes present on the tongue to make it really interesting. A little too sweet for my tastes. Needs a little more complexity to balance it out. Overall an excellent brew to introduce novices who are afraid of the dark. Die hard stout vets may find it wanting a bit.

Perhaps I should've poured it "harder" into the glass? I'm curious as to the difference with the Nitro version. Anyhow, I will definitely be buying this again.","BeerMagistrate","Feb 08, 2015"
3.81,-4.3,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"The cap says "pour hard" i don't know what that means. There was maybe a quarter inch of creamy foam, and it was dark as expected. The taste was well balanced, but just generally not very intense. They call it "America's Stout" on the label, i guess this is probably as good as it gets as far as making a stout with wide appeal (except guinness on tap) however, i think the idea of a stout that appeals to everyone runs the risk of removing the characteristics that make it stout, and i think this goes a bit too far in that direction.","ribby","Feb 08, 2015"

Review is outside after a spicy meal. Good look, nice foam retained throughout. Mouth feel was nice and smooth if you got a little foam, but was a little thin w/o. Overall taste was of a good dark stout, coffee apparent with a smoky ambience, but def not as strong and robust as some others. I can see how others really like this beer and I enjoyed it esp at the start, it just leveled off after. But overall well worth a try or a 6.","hotpauko","Jan 17, 2015"

3.97,-0.3,4,3.25,4.25,4.5,4,"Left Hand Milk Stout brewed by Left Hand Brewing Company, with an ABV of 6.0%  This brew pours out a dark brown color with an light brown head. It has the look of coffee.  The smell is sweet with some grains, and malts. Not much to note on the smell of this brew. Now for the taste it is smooth but rich with flavor.  There is a lot going on in this brew.  You pick up on malts and a mild sweetness, it the taste of this brew. There is nothing overpowering in the taste of this brew, no bad aftertaste. The mouthfeel is nice and bold, but clean finish.  Left Hand Milk Stout is a nice drinking brew. Overall I'm giving  Left Hand Milk Stout a 4 out 5.  I would get this brew again.","nicholas2121","Dec 11, 2014"

Roasted coffee, chocolate but not a burnt taste or astringent.  Very easy to drink. I would use this as an introduction to the dark side for non stout lovers.

Malty notes of Roasted Barley, Oats, and Chocolate. I believe the Brewers at Left Hand say it best, "Milk sugar in your stout is like cream in your coffee". Because of the sweetness I found this was a beer I could drink over a long night, but you definitely need to be I an a specific mood to drink this beer. My preference is more of a straight forward stout. I would drink this again, it just might not be my first choice.","Eric_Edwardson","Nov 04, 2014"

Begins with earthy malts, along with toffee and molasse, as well as a salted whiff - adding an interesting twist to the beer. Roasted qualities are standing out in this brew, enhanced by cream and gentle milk chocolate. Turns sweeter during the finish, revealing a little heat, caramel and syrup, with a coffeeish bitter impact on the back of the tongue, balancing the beer.","aleigator","Nov 02, 2014"

Smells like chocolate, vanilla, little dark fruit and coffee. Taste is mostly bittersweet chocolate and dark malts. Nice clean crisp finish tho. Not overly sweet. Mouthfeel is outstanding. Smooth, medium to full body. Coats the mouth and leaves a nice bite on the back end. Overall, this is good stuff. I've had it on tap, and its just as good out of the bottle.","BrewThru_29","Jun 30, 2014"

A thick micro-foam head formed on top of a brown/near-black body. The nose is all dry stout and oats. The mouthfeel is smooth and surprisingly light. Lush caramel and oats finishing with a crisp dry stout cleanness. Just lovely.","NapoleonInRags","Jun 25, 2014"

The smell was nice, with hints of coffee, a bit of chocolate, and a lot of malt. The taste had a lot more chocolate than the nose implied and I thought it was delicious. The mouthfeel was my favorite part. Not overly thick, but still coated the mouth and throat very well. I really liked this one and thought it would be great in the fall, but even in the summer it was a nice treat.","WhiteHillsStore","Jun 17, 2014"

Uber-smooth. The taste was reminiscent of a typical soft, mildly spiced milk stout that was again so creamy I just couldn't put it down. This has absolutely become one of my favorites of all time.","WKrieger","Feb 22, 2014"

Fairly aggressive pour doesn't immediately yield a big frothy head, but seems to build after it's in the glass-- nice tan foam... Aroma is a little sweet with chocolate and coffee overtones... Taste is a little sweet without being syrupy. All in all, a pretty decent beer and tasted a little better than expected. Above average and recommendable. Cheers!","SoupKitchenBeerSnob","0"

Aroma was like a mocha coffee. Nice. Taste included the expected sweet malty flavor, cocoa and left little bitter notes on the aftertaste. I didn't get any of the oats. It offered low carbonation.

3.74,-6,3.75,4,3.75,3,3.75,"This is a very popular beer in my area and I was expecting a lot from this. It came in a nitro bottle and was served into a pint glass. The color appeared to be pitch black (but others will argue it is just very dark brown). The head recedes to a sliver and holds. The beer smells of coffee, chocolate, and molasses, smelling more bitter than sweet. The taste is bittersweet, starting sweet but finishing with the coffee notes. The mouthfeel is very creamy but finishes flat as other reviewers have noted, and increased carbonation may have benefited the beer in this area although a thicker and creamier mouthfeel should be expected. Overall, this is an easy drinking beer with some good flavors that just didn't match all that well for me. It's easy to find this beer (at least the non-nitro version) but there are better stouts out there.","DeFaz","Oct 04, 2013"

The aroma and mouthfeel are exceptional and I'm not afraid to say world class... A few minor tweaks to enhance appearance and taste and this one would be one of the best beers going...

I'm hard pressed to say anything I dislike about it, but I don't want to give it all fives just in case I find one I like better. For the moment, this is my favorite kind of stout. The texture is slightly creamy and makes me think of dark chocolate. I guess the one thing I would like to see on this beer is a longer-lasting head. We'll see what I think of the "nitro" version of this guy soon...just bought both in a make your own six-pack. :)","Krieger783","Sep 14, 2013"

I'm not sure I'd go that far, but this is one of the best examples of its style you'll find and one that's easy to find at that. This is a real dandy of a stout and while Left Hand keeps to the basics of this style that's what makes it so good. Sometimes the good things don't have to be pounded with a high abv, but just crafted in a manner that sticks to a styles roots. That's what the Left Hand Milk Stout is all about. Something any of us can buy and left satisfied by the experience. If you are into milk stouts this is a top shelf creation.

Hopped with Magnum and US Goldings. 25 IBU's, OG=16P, 6.0% ABV. No widget. Poured hard. Forms a nice creamy long lasting light tan head with really ncie lacing and great retention. Pours out to a near black with brown accents. Carbonation is low, ~1.0 carbs or so. The nose is wonderfully full of chocolate and carob..beautiful roast notes with black walnut. Mouthfeel is smooth, pillowy soft, creamy and medium bodied. The taste is great...black walnut, well balanced roast, residual sweetness perfectly balanced with a classic mild hop profile and notes of black patent and roasted barley in the aftertaste. There is an odd grassy tartness that doesn't quite sit well in classic examples. Overall though, this is a near world-class beer, IMO.","Mitchster","Mar 07, 2013"

4.12,3.5,4.25,4,4.25,4,4,"The beer pours like black velvet with a beautiful, near perfect head of tightly knit, sand dune-white bubbles. The beer’s body is dark and impenetrable to the eye, though presumably clean. The beer leaves a sheet of medium width, very tight lacing across much of the glass that eventually stretches into a long web. On the nose, the beer smells nicely roasty, like espresso. There is also a great lactic sour-sugar smell in the nose that lets you know it’s a milk stout. It actually almost smells like a cappuccino. Faint hints of a caramel and toffee can also be detected in the nose. On the tongue, the beer tastes much like the smell, with rich sweet coffee with a touch of roasted bitter and a touch of lactic sour. The flavor begins as watery coffee with a touch of milk before blooming into beautiful, almost cappuccino-like, flavors. Touches of toffee, vanilla, and sour milk touch upon the tongue. The finish is a bit sour with a touch of roasted malts and the aftertaste is a lesser clone of the finish. On the mouth, the beer feels smooth and velvety with a creamy quality to it. The beer’s body is medium and fluffy thanks to the nitrogen bubbles. The mouth is left wet with sour saliva. Overall, this is a lovely nitro milk stout. Great complex flavors. It is a little watery in the start, and honestly this beer is better when on tap than in the bottle (yes, yes, this is obvious, but it is especially prevalent with this beer). Try this beer.","Maxwell","0"
4,0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"This is a fine beer. Pours out to a vast blackness. An agressive pour yielded a very, small head. The aroma gives forth roasted malt.

Upon first sip, you realize that the nitro has taken the original Milk Stout to a whole new level of creaminess and taste! My wife is not the biggest fan of stouts but she always humors me and tries them. This one was "the one" that has changed her mind and she even ordered her own pint!!! That is a testament to how good this beer is, because she is very picky when it comes to beer and she loves it!","centurian62","Feb 27, 2013"

Light roasty notes on the nose, but not very much aroma. Sweet malts on the palate, very little hint of bitterness, but not cloying in any way. While not a terribly complex flavor, one of the easiest-drinking beers I've had a very long while; a 6% beer that could easily pass for a 4%. Wonderful, palate-coating mouthfeel - creamy, silky, and satisfying. Maybe not the most complex flavor profile amongst stouts, but this is a beer I could be happy drinking most any time.","MisterBisco","Jan 07, 2013"
3.82,-4,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours a dark oily brown topped with a frothy, cream colored head. I expected a little larger of a head considering the 'nitro.' The aroma is wonderful with smooth cream, milk chocolate, brown sugar, and candy. The taste reveals additional roasty and coffee notes within. The flavors are not as powerful as I expected, and overall the beer is pretty light in its body and feel as well. It goes down quite easily however. Ultimately good, but a disappointment if you are looking for a rich beer. I prefer Young's or Lancaster Milk Stout as better examples of the style.","Neorebel","Jan 07, 2013"

Also, I would have included chocolate in the description on the packaging also (i.e. chocolate milk stout) because this IS a great chocolate milk stout. Unless Terrapin releases Moo-Hoo on nitro, this is probably my new favorite. Now I'm a sucker for milk stouts, especially on nitro, but I didn't think they'd pull it off in the bottle. I was wrong.

Retention was fairly poor, and there was no lacing to speak of. The nose is malt, coffee, and soy sauce. Taste is very sweet and errs to that side rather than to the bitter. However there is a little bit of hops on the finish. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy with more carbonation than I would have expected for a stout. Not bad at all.

About 1/2" tan head, which dissipates quickly leaving lace up the sides of the glass. Aroma is about what you would expect with a stout - coffee-like black patent malt is clear from the roasting. Some dark chocolate and toffee. Not much grassy, citrus or floral notes from the hops though - I would usually expect a bit more in a stout. Taste is very sweet due to lactose, also with strong malty and roasted flavor you would expect with a stout. Very little bitterness from the hops to counteract the sweetness. Mouthfeel is robust, heavy with moderate to light carbonation. Overall, I like it - there are not many milk stouts out there and this is a good one!","PacNWDad","Beers"

But having those around already this is a nice addition to the stout range, being the light and easy going one for some variation or for people who want to try an easy stout as an introduction to the genre.

There is excellent head retention with some lacing left on the side of the glass as the head slowly dissipates. A little less than a finger length of head remains atop the beer. There are aromas of dark roasted barley malt, milk chocolate, and coffee. The smells are definitely indicative of what a stout should be. The taste does follow the nose with the milk chocolate, roasted malt, and coffee notes coming through. The flavors of this beer are well balanced. The body is full with just the right amount of carbonation. The beer is smooth and creamy. The drinkability is very high. This is an excellent stout that hits all the right notes.","acevenom","Jul 13, 2012"

Smell is sweet chocolate, bread, carmel, and toffee. Taste is all of that, with chocolate and toffee being the main flavors, very smooth. Body is thin for a stout, o.k amount of carbonation, a little dry, and definitely drinkable. This was a little to simple and thin for me. I realize everything isn't going to be imperial size, but this was just o.k.","SawDog505","May 22, 2012"

Aromas of chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, caramel, cream, vanilla, and a touch of herbal hops. Nice and well balanced aromas, with good strength. Taste of chocolate, coffee, caramel, molasses, cream, vanilla, roasted malt, biscuit, and light herbal hops. Light herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, coffee, and vanilla on the finish for a bit. Very nice flavor balance and not cloyingly sweet at all. Quite robust feeling as well. Medium carbonation and body; with a very nice creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish present.

The flavor is very similar to the nose, mocha, chocolate, roasted notes. The big impact of the nitro can be felt in the mouthfeel, which is very creamy and the carbonation is low with a dry finish.

Aroma of dark and roasted malt, chocolate and lactic acid. Flavor is chocolate, dark malts, like a very mellow, lightly flavored chocolate milk. Flavor is very pleasant and well integrated, but tastes somewhat thin and almost watered down. Medium bodied and nicely appropriately creamy. What flavor is present is quite nice. Could be a superb stout with a bit more intense flavor.","LiquidAmber","Feb 10, 2012"

I've had the regular Milk Stout bottle and the Milk Stout on Nitro-tap. The Milk Stout Nitro-bottle definitely lived up to my expectations. It was very similar to the regular Milk Stout bottle but a little bit creamier thanks to the head and was pretty comparable to the Milk Stout Nitro-tap. Will have to compare the regular Milk Stout and Milk Stout nitro simultaneously to really compare the difference and make sure this isn't a gimmick. Overall though I'm impressed and would consider buying this beer again.","jaasen64","Feb 10, 2012"

It seems like most of the sweetness is the lactose sugar and not caramelized maltose from grains. Mouthfeel is remarkably smooth. True chocolate sweet stout.

Milk chocolate sweetness leads it off. The lactose in the beer gives it a refreshing chocolate milk flavor. Hints of roasted malt and bittersweet chocolate notes before more sweet milky chocolate flavor at the finish. This beer is true to the milk stout name.

Hard pour as the bottle indicates, reveals a near black ale topped with a huge, pillowy brown head that retains a good half inch throughout the drink. Aromas are chocolaty with some roasted malt. Mouth-feel is unbelievably smooth - velvety and full-bodied. Tastes are milk chocolate, brown sugar, with a slight roasted finish, but is mostly sweet on the finish. Overall, great experience, but in the end it's Milk Stout with a nitro kick. I will say, though, that Milk Stout was one of my gateway beers when I was first introduced to craft beer, so it does carry some nostalgia with it for me. Great to try & I would buy this again.","barnzy78","Jan 27, 2012"

The foamy, dense head is no joke, and after the cascade, it settles in to a good half inch of beauty. Aromas are heavy on the dark roasted coffee, with a hint of cocoa nib. The beer is ridiculously smooth in mouth, but a little light for the style. Flavors are blended much better than out of the bottle, with the coffee foundation giving rise to some creamy sweet overtones and a subtle vanilla highlight. This beer clings all over the glass.

3.22,-19.1,3.5,4,3,2.5,3,"Overall I thought that this was a slightly above average Milk Stout. All the nice flavors that I remembered showed up but they were much lighter and not nearly as robust as I remember them being, but the lactose sweetness still showed up as I remember and it was just the right amount. This beer has pretty good drinkability, it goes down smooth, isn't thick, but the lightness of flavor would bore me, after one I am ready to move onto something else. What I liked most about this beer was the aroma, it was just as I remember and was pretty damn good. What I liked least about this beer was the taste and mouthfeel, the flavors were much lighter then they should be and the mouthfeel left a lot to be desired. If I knew this was fresh I would buy it again, but I will be leery about buying this with over a couple months age. I recommend giving this a try, its a good example of Milk Stout, but make sure it is fresh. This beer wasn't as great as I remember and I think most of that has to do with the age, I had to hold it right up to light bulb to see the date and even then it was pretty smudged and not easy to read. You would think four months wouldn't hurt this beer that much but it is pretty obvious that the roast flavors faded quickly in this beer. I am going to try and get a fresh bottle and re-review it but I think that Left Hand needs to date their bottles better, when it's fresh this is a great example of a Milk Stout, but with four months on it it turns into something that isn't that impressive. As far as I can tell this beer needs be treated almost like an IPA and consumed fresh for best results. I checked the website and they don't tell you how long this beer can last, which sucks, I hope the nitro bottles make to my area soon, I bet this beer would be great in a fresh nitro bottle.","StoutHunter","Jan 06, 2012"

Once I realized there wasn't a widget in the bottle, I was impressed with the cascade action. A creamy, wheat bread colored head sits on top at about 1 1/2". Not much aroma coming off of this one. Mild coffee scent. Taste is somewhat sweet and toasty. This beer is super smooth. I could drink this stuff any time of the day. Superb mouthfeel.

This beer tastes amazing. Sweet milk chocolate and roasted coffee, mixed with a touch of dark malts. A great mouthfeel makes this go down very, very smooth. This is the perfect session beer for me, it's not watery, nor is it too heavy.

It doesn't have really much going on as far as a smell goes, maybe a lil' chocolate, coffee and roasted malts present. However, what it lacks in smell, it makes up for in taste and mouthfeel! It's a creamy-smooth and sweet beer that's almost like drinking dessert or like beer mixed with milk and coffee. It has profound coffee flavors with some caramel, chocolate and roasted malts present. Hardly any hops are detected. I love this beer, one that I will definitely get again. If it had a better nose, it would probably be in my top five.","brandon911","Nov 21, 2011"

So by itself, not bad, but not outstanding either. Given all the other reviews rating this beer higher I'm going to chalk my review up to a bottle that either didn't set on the shelf in the store well rather than one that was past it's date, and I'll have to review it again sometime to see if it really is the beer, or the flavors depend upon what I'm eating with it.","damndirtyape","Nov 20, 2011"

I have sampled this out of a bottle and with a nitro-tap. Huge difference. The bottle version is ok at best while the Nitro-tap is very, very nice.

3.65,-8.3,3,3,4,3.5,4,"I poured this beer into a chilled glass mug. The head was inconsistent from bottle to bottle. I had six of this particular beer. About three of the bottles form about 3/4-1 inch of very dark brown head that lasted only a minute or two. The other three gave head (giggity) similar to what soda is like whenever it is mixed out of proportion with its syrup. I still do not know whether this is part of the Milk Stout style or if it was just on the shelf for a while. However, whenever there was head left, it always left lacing...which was done beautifully. There was always the opportunity to lick a bit of head off the side before indulging into the creamy body of the beer. It smelled of dark malts, chocolate, and perhaps a bit of coffee (though not strong but accented mos def). At first, the taste was a bit underwhelming, but this is my first “Milk Stout.” The added sugars (lactose) give it a much creamier quality that I am not used to and suspect is more of a cult taste. And so, judging the taste, I must allow it to be what it is; not something that I have a strong affinity for at this time. However, the body of this beer was full, creamy, and has a definite flavor as if it were going for an imperial kick, but the “milk” attempt sort of neuters the necessary risks needed to make this more than a slightly above average beer. At times, it even seemed watery, and so if it is supposed to be “milky” it is skim milky. In my mouth, it seemed to sag and have a heavy sensation on my tongue. If it were going for a milk sensation, it definitely accomplishes this goal (it was quite different for me). Overall, it seems that it is a good stout with excellent flavor (however a bit simple I suspect), but the “milk” thing seemed to underwhelm me; because the bold flavor seemed to be neutered by the attempt to be milky. I don’t take any dairy in my coffee either. So, to be fair, I will give it a slightly better grade than what I think my taste grades it by. If I ever find this on tap, I will probably try it again, but I will probably never seek out a bottled version of this any time soon. I suspect the possibility that the lactose may have compromised some of the beer’s integrity while it was on the shelf. I look forward to trying more Left Hand brews, because I hear that they are incredibly creative.","paxchristi","Aug 11, 2011"

The mouthfeel doesn't fade I have a constant think feel in my mouth. The taste is just as the smell dictates. Lots of chocolate sweetness, with a caramel note to finish.

This has a rich and full mouth feel, solid chocolate and milk notes up front with a slight sweet and bitter chcolate milk finish.

The taste is creamier, and the flavors a bit longer than the nose would suggest. There is also a nice hint of bitterness that works well with the sweetness and creamy notes.

Overall this was a pretty nice milk stout. Not my favorite I have had, but still pretty good. This one had a pretty big sweetness aspect to it as compared to others I have had.

The body is a somewhat hefty medium, with a very light carbonation and a feel as smooth as Billy Dee.

Overall this was a nice milk stout with good scent and taste that had the perfect amount of sweetness over a regular stout. It had nice body too, which made this really easy to drink. This wasn't the most exciting beer in the world, but it's a solid example of the style.","Pencible","Feb 28, 2010"
3.55,-10.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Poured into a Duvel Tulip glass. Pours out very dark, close to black with brown on the edges where the liquid get's a little thinner. An off white foam head appears, but it doesn't really stick around. Only the slightest bit around edge of the glass, not much lacing a little bit glides down back to the liquid but more and more disappear after each sip. The smell is pretty good but not very complex, mostly of sweet chocolate and some coffee. It has to be pretty close to room temperature to pick up on the smell. The taste is more of darker chocolate followed by coffee, possibly even esspresso. Dark roasted malts can be tasted a little. I didn't expect it, but about half way through the session you can get a slight hop aftertaste. It's not strong, but it's there. Mouthfeel is good, full bodied sort of a "milky" mouthfeel smooth with a slight bitterness on the finish, pretty good. It's pretty drinkable overall a bit tough to distinguish though. Not extremely drinkable, but not a sipper either. Don't be discouraged from trying it, it's pretty good overall.","AndyAvalanche","Feb 22, 2010"

Not a hugely memorable beer, but an easily quaffable stout.

The nitro tap worked well with this brew. Pour dark black, but you can tell not that dense, color. A huge, frothy white head rests atop. Seemed like there was a rim of head around my glass the entire time I drank it. The aroma was none too overwhelming. A rich malt aroma is there, with some very sweet sugar and chocolate hints. Flavor was far more pronounced than the aroma indicated. A nice, full sweet chocolate malt flavor with a slight bitter ting at the end. The lactose aspect came through stronger as a drank it. The nitro-did wonders for the mouthfeel, and really brought out the creamy characteristics, and lighten the brew itself with some carbonation. I like a milk stout every now and then, and this one is done better with the nitro-tap, it just lightens it up, makes it an easy drinking, but sweet character stout.","bhalter8","Beers"

The nose was pretty par, chocolate, caramel, coffee, little nutty. The taste is what puts this one over the top. You taste everything you just smelled, along with a bit of dried fruit, black cherry, and well balanced lactose. An overload of lactose is what had turned me off to this style in the past, but I think the burnt coffee may have kept that lactose from getting too sickeningly sweet. The mouthfeel is smooth, could be a little silkier, but this is a 5.2% beer so what do you want. I typically stick to beers of this ilk in the colder weather.

What I was impressed with was the roasted malt and creamy coffee aroma. Bigger than I expected. The taste is... milk like with hints of chocolate, toffee and of course roasted malt. This is a stout that has a sweetness to it but it isn't a fruity sweetness at all (as one would hope given that it's a milk stout) It feels like creamy milk in your mouth and goes down very, very smooth. Still, given the sweetness and the fact that it feels so much like dark, flavorful milk, I wouldn't want another one. But if you can drink a ton of milk then you could probably drink a ton of this since it isn't overly heavy. Overall it's a pretty solid beer. A good first milk stout (and it could be since they sell it in six packs everywhere now) that will not surprise you. It is exactly what it claims to be.

4.22,6,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"This beer poured very dark, almost black with a relatively thin (true to style) head that dissipated rather quickly. The nose of this brew is dominated by a roasted coffee scent with hints of sweet chocolate peeking through. The taste is very similar to the nose but with a bit more sweetness. I was surprised at how easy this was on the palette. Its got everything you look for in a stout but is more drinkable than any I've yet tried. The mouthfeel is smooth, not very creamy but easy on the tongue as there isnt much bitterness in the aftertaste. This beer is extremely drinkable and would make a great session beer for someone who loves stout or may be a little intimidated by the typical bitterness many stouts offer. I'll be buying it again and recommending it for sure.","xxHelderxx","Feb 07, 2009"

Burnt coffee notes mix with some dark chocolate tints. The mouthfeel was good - slightly thin feeling, but also slightly creamy. I really enjoyed this beer.

At first this beer smells overwhelming sweet but the quickly fades and this beer evens out a bit with roasted notes become dominant through not overpowering. Coffee and a bit of cocoa are present with a very nice cream-like sweetness lingering in the background. Taste is like the aroma. Roasted flavors are dominant and take on cocoa and coffee notes (in the order). Bitterness is just sjy of moderate and sweetness is moderate making for an interesting finish where the attenuation of the beer as well as the roasted grains combine for a drying effect while the added lactose provides sweetness. Overall this is a bit more on the roasted side but the sweetness shines through a bit more at times. Mouthfeel is pretty good, maybe a bit light or the style with what I'd characterize as only a medium body despite the residual sugars for the lactose. The lactose seems to enhance the body a bit but this still seems a bit thin. Carbonation is spot on at a low-moderate level. Drinkability is quite good. I think that the more moderate body, while a bit light for the style helps make this a bit more quaffable.

If smooth and creamy is what you are looking for this may be your beer. It is on the sweeter side as are all milk stouts. It first tastes like a nice cold sweet cream coffee. Then comes the character of vanilla and roasted malts. The finish is similar to that of tiramisu or of bitter-sweet bakers chocolate. It would make a wonderful compliment to a large dinner with dessert. I prefer a nice brew to scotch anyway.","DownDaHatch","Aug 08, 2008"

The cream flavor opens up more as it warms but again it's rather smokey with just a hint of lingering coffee bitterness and a tad minerally in the finish.... I can't really detect cocoa in the flavor as much as in the smell. I prefered my initial sniff of this stuff than it's taste.

I would be interested to try another milk stout to see if others are as sugary. Even sweeter than Young's Double Chocolate Stout.

Smells of dark chocolate, burnt wood, and some slight caramel sweetness coming through. Taste is very complex with some sugary syrup, roasted almonds, malts, creamy milkiness and chocolate at the forefront, and some toffee in the background.

After a few sips I also caught some roasted malt and smokeiness. What really sticks around in the aftertaste is a nice, mild resin quality w/o too much bitterness. Mouthful was quite nice: rich and creamy w/o being thick and enough carbonation to balance everything else out (like the sweetness, I didnt find this too high).

The flavor is slightly sweet at the beginning with a bit of coffee and roast flavor, and finishes with some bitterness. It has a nice full mouthfeel and leaves you with just enough flavor to take another sip for that delicious flavor. If you like any kind of stout, this one is worth going out of your way for.

Very smooth, could use a tad more carbonation but really very nice. This was more of a chocolate stout, then a milk stout to me, but the sweetness is very prevelent.

I do not like my stouts to high in alcohol. It could use more body being that it is a bit watery. Has a nice moderate carbonation along with a spicey hop flavor. It is very drinkable and I can see myself finishing the whole six-pack. has a dry bitter lingering coffee-like finish. It is not overly sweet and has just the right amount of sweetness.

There is a prominent lactose flavor that I remember from a Cream Stout I brewed once. That quickly fades into a roasted flavor. The sweetness of the lactose is a tad much for me, but it is enjoyable none the less. The mouthfeel is interesting...it is initially very full but quickly fades to a much thinner feel.

This smell is the high point of the beer. Upfront, the taste is bittersweet coffee, which moves quickly to a milky sweetness, ending in a very roasty bitterness. The mouthfeel is smooth and thick, with a pleasant tingle of carbonation. I feel that a bit more thickness is in order, though.

An oatmeal-like smooth cool to the sweet. A touch of molasses. Tastes chocolatey, roasty, sour dark malts, smooth milky sweetness, and a caramel that's light yet persistent becoming the predominant aftertaste. Yummy. Hop bitter is either low or hidden beneath sting from the too-much carbonation. Swirl to release carb reforms one finger of head that quickly settles.

Very sweet with lots of lactose and roasted malts and chocolate. The taste was incredible. Is this a beer or a Yoohoo chocolate milk?! The only downside to this, was that I feel it is way, way too light for the style concerning mouthfeel. If there was such a thing as MacKeson XXX Light, this would be it. Everything else was fantastic, but this light of a body in a milk stout is a "no-go".

You get a little blend of hoppy bitterness and some roasted malt at the end as well to balance the sweetness. I tend to think of milk stouts as being a little one-dimensional in some ways, since their sweetness is often not as complex or deep as, say, a malty bock.

Smooth mouthfeel with lower carbonation. Starts like sweet milk chocolate, nothing else much to distract the flavor profile. The beer finishes with a more granular texture, darker in tone, more mousse-like -- a bit sandy in the back of the throat.

Chocolate chip cookie dough like in nature with mellow herbal low hop profile. Taste: Like drinking a cold glass of chocolate flavored milk in some regards the creaminess hits the tastes buds in an unoffensive and relatively pleasant manner. Not overly sweet balanced with a the grace of hops and darker malts, definitely a decent brew from Left Hand.

Very little taste up front with a finish that is like drinking a cup of coffee milk, with not enough of the coffee syrup to give it the proper coffee taste, but still carrying the sweetness of coffee milk that you might expect. Though it does carry some sweetness it wasn't as sweet as other milk stouts i have tryed.even after giving this a few swirls very little fizz appears on the top, and there is little carbonation to speak of. That truly milky aftertaste is bugging me a bit, making it somewhat ahrd to drink. It might be ok if it was balanced out with some better flavor up front, but it is really the only flavor it has and so i feel like i am drinking a oddly flavored skim milk.

3.95,-0.8,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,"Texture is a little creamy with soft gentle carbonation. This is a very nice drinkable stout, the flavors are really tasty I just wish they were a little more robust.","sulldaddy","Dec 26, 2003"
3.67,-7.8,3.5,4,3.5,3,4,"Drinkability is good because this is quite light and easy drinking, now whether you'll want another one is another story as it's not too interesting.","Jables","Dec 25, 2003"
2.18,-45.2,3,2.5,2,3,1.5,"A very average beer at best. The smell should have clued me in as it had hints of coffee and chocolate but an off brewery smell (the smell of the mash tun). First sip reminded me very much of Heineken Dark (not a good thing at all). Chocolate and coffee were present but quickly got ruined by a lackluster malt bill that seemed more like an american macro with some barley tossed in. I love milk stouts but this was a real tragedy.","jreitman","Nov 25, 2003"
3.47,-12.8,3.5,4,3.5,3,3,"The Milk Stout poured black with red highlights. It had a small head that quickly went down to a collar. The aroma was coffee, roasted malts and some nuttiness. It was a sweet, creamy stout and tasted of sweet malts initially with a bitter, nutty, coffee-like finish. A little thin on the palate and a little too sweet for me. Overall, not a bad stout. The sweet and the bitter probably could have been better balanced.","Beaver13","Nov 20, 2003"
4.03,1.3,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Have had it on a regular tap and also from a beer engine, the beer engine makes it very silky, and very nice. The scores are for the engine.","homersimpson","Nov 19, 2003"
3.1,-22.1,3,3,3,3,3.5,"It pours with a nice opaque black color with a delicate white head. Sweet malt dominates the aroma and flavor with just barely enough hops to keep it from becoming cloying. Body is rather thin compared to most stouts. After taste was pleasant malt. Very simple, drinkable and pleasant for lighthearted drinking. This would be a good introduction to stouts for the Bud drinker.","John1985","Nov 12, 2003"
3.1,-22.1,4,4,3,2,2.5,"Poured a dark color with an off white head and left a small amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma was of burned malts and chocolate and coffee. The flavor was very common with the aroma and other beers in this style, but the coffee taste was a bit too strong for my liking in this one.","clvand0","Nov 09, 2003"
3.8,-4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Poured black with just the smallest of heads,light coffee, chocolate earthy aroma. Sweet malty first taste, very smooth mouthfeel, coffeeish aftertaste, a raisin taste came on as it warmed. All those flavors yet it didn't seem that complex. I will buy single bottles occasionally.","grynder33","Oct 14, 2003"

3.68,-7.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"This not my favorite milk stout, but it's not bad either. It taste to me more like a coffee mixed with nuts, cream, and some chocolate. It was stronger on the coffee though. The color was a deep, dark red, but had a brownish head to it. It was smooth, I'll give it that much. It actually got better, the warmer it got. It's cheap and I like it, so I will have to get some more.","JISurfer","Sep 13, 2003"
3.7,-7,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a near black with auburn highlights and a khaki colored, creamy head that eventually thins across the surface of the body. Aroma consists of roasted malt, creamed coffee and sweet chocolate. The mouthfeel is full-bodied and smooth. Taste is decent, but nothing too spectacular. Roasted chocolate malt dominates the palate. Definitely a sweeter overall flavor. Finish is milder and has hardly any bitterness and no lingering dryness, ala an Irish Stout, which this is not anyway. I suppose I only mention that because I do prefer those qualities in a stout. Left Hand & Tabernash's Milk Stout is a good offering and worth trying, just with so many options out there this does little to set itself apart. None-the-less a worthy offering.","Winter","Jul 24, 2003"
4,0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"taste like chocolate milk mixed w/ hops, but in a good way. very nice little brew we got going on here.Got the creamy feel mixed with a hint-o-hopness. Sits well when you get it down. Very good for winter, or even early fall. I am digging this as much as I dig oatmeal stouts, and that is going some. Very drinkable","PSUDREW","Jul 19, 2003"
3.74,-6,3.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Black in spots, orange tints interwoven, ruby around the edges, smallish light beige head, quick to dissipate... a few odd specks of lace. Lovely sugary sweetness, rich chocolate, and coffee nose… the bouquet shows excellent depth, very inviting. The palate is less enthusiastic. Chalky and dry… vaguely sweet (you’d expect more lactose sweetness), cocoa powder, faint coffee hints. Fairly complex… excellent hops influences at the finish, it builds on the coffee flavors nicely. Medium-light body, silky, minimal carbonation… slightly thin mouthfeel. Drinkable, enjoyment is moderate though… good enough to try, not great enough to drink repeatedly. It does represent the style very well. Try one if it is handy.","bditty187","Jul 19, 2003"
3.98,0,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"This beer poured a very dark amber, almost black color and formed a nice big medium tan head that coated the glass with lace as it subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, coffee and and burnt chocolate is present. A flavor of malt and coffee. Fairly light for this style and a slight burnt bitterness in the finish. Not a bad beer.","Wildman","Jul 14, 2003"

4.14,4,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"This is another beer I probably would have passed on if not for Beer Advocate reviews. Pours a bit thinner & lighter than your average stout, with ligh passing through to give deep, dark red but almost black color. Head is decent but did'nt last long in my glass. Smell is of roasted coffee right away..very sweet & inviting. No other aromas detected, but man this smells good. Taste lives up to the name. This is one of the most bizarre beers I've had. Starts off with a mild malty coffee taste, then gives way to a truly milk-like taste & mouthfeel. Mouthfeel if slightly thin for a stout but still good & smooth. It did have a slightly sticky aftertaste & feel.. As far as stouts go this is easy to quaff. Interesting & suprisingly good beer. By the way, the 7% ABV is totally lost in the mix.","avylover","Jul 12, 2003"
4.23,6.3,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"A great example of the "beershake." Loads of roasted malt flavors with a creamy, luxurious mouthfeel. Dark chocolate and coffee notes vie for dominance in the mocha equation. Lactose sugars are noteworthy in a soft sweet finish. 7% abv? Astounding - never would have guessed, the alcohol is subdued and hardly evident.","Brent","Jun 28, 2003"
3.08,-22.6,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"12oz.Bottled on 05/06/03. Deep ruby red with light illuminating through the glass. Carbonation seems very active as I pour and a small and lightly compacted head develops. Aroma is like choco-milk with a subtle roasted malt flavor. Body is crisp and a bit thin for a stout. Decent flavor though somewhat light tasting for the style. Cocoa, coffe and a nutty flavor as well. Slight dry finish.","BierReise","Jun 13, 2003"
4,0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"This brew be 4s across the board. A good look with a strong nose and good flavoring and mouthfeel make this a solid stout to be reckoned with. The pour creates a solid dark brown color with ruby highlights. The head is a quickly-gone thick beige that leaves a moderate amount of lace. The flavor is rich stout with plenty of coffee and chocolate with which to deal. Solid, not doubt about it.","AtLagerHeads","Jun 09, 2003"
4,0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured a nice dark brown with a thick creamy head. Aromas are distinctly coffee and mocha. The first sip bombards my palate with the same flavors of coffee and mocha blended together very smoothly for a nice bittersweet finish that is very creamy in mouthfeel (typical of the milk stouts.) As the beer warms the flavors become more intense, but I do not notice anything new. Seemed a bit thinner in the pour than I was expecting, but the creamy mouthfeel definitely made up for it. I am also VERY surprised to read that it weighs in at 7% ABV.... seemed much lighter to me this evening.","TripelJ","May 30, 2003"
3.46,-13.1,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Pours a dark and flat almost black color with a tinge of ruby. Thin beige head and quick lacing. Aroma is lightly bitter coffee and chocolate. Somewhat light-bodied given the look and ABV of it. Roasty with flavors of coffee, grain, and chocolate. The milk is more evident in the sweet finish than anywhere else. Not bad.","Dogbrick","Beers"
3.82,-4,4,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Clear deep mohagony appearance. A wispy beige head caps the beer and recedes to just a thin coating rather quickly. Collar is substantial. Lacing barely clings to hang on. Some milk chocolate. Mocha. And burnt malts as well. All in all, a very inviting aroma. After the wonderful smell, I'm a bit let down with the taste. But nonetheless, it's still better than average. A blanket of milk sweetness and lactic sugars cover the underlying bittersweet chocolate and java tones. The mouthfeel is good. Very creamy and silky. Low on the carbontation and high on the velvety feel. This is a beer I might pick up every now and then if it were available around here.","Bighuge","0"
3.36,-15.6,5,4,3,3,3,"The pour is ebony in color, the head inconsequential in size, the structure patchy clumps of large bubbles, the color a light chocolate. Nose is roasted grains, bittersweet chocolate with a sweet malt start, top is light to moderate in feel, the finish crisply acidic, the hops pleasant in their spicy bite, dry aftertaste. In the interest of being kind we will call it a Beginners Stout or your Entry into the Dark Side, most stouts have little to fear form this one!","Gusler","Apr 19, 2003"
3.83,-3.8,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours a nice dark brown color. Decent head. Chocolate and mild roastiness in the aroma. The taste is very sweet, with a good balance of the roastiness and chocolate. Goes down real easy. I also love the cow with the handprints on the label. All in all a good sweet stout!","Boto","Apr 04, 2003"
4,0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Aromas of semi-sweet to bitter chocolate and expresso. The scents followed through the flavor. Semi-sweet chocolate with a slight bitter finish. Very creamy and smooth. Goes down easy with little hints that it is 7.0% ABV","Loki","Mar 30, 2003"
3.89,-2.3,3,4,4,3.5,4,"A dark amber from the pour, with very little head at all. Some chocolate and coffee comes across in the aroma. My first sip detects the creamy additive of milk, along with undertones the previously mentioned coffee and chocolate raost. There is a milky consistency to the flavor of the beer. It's a fairly carbonated beer. A hint of nuttiness in the aftertaste. As a side note, the bubbles on the surface formed a shape similar to that of a koala's face...maybe I should quit drinking. Drinkability is easy on this stout.","BigHead","Mar 10, 2003"
4,0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"A very intriguing brew. The aroma leaves something of a creamy sense there. The first sip says that very same thing. However, the bier does not, in any way, leave a heavy feeling on the tongue. How can a brew have a creamy feel, yet not be creamy nor heavy in mouthfeel? Very interesting. Well worth seeking out, if you can find it. Prost!","goindownsouth","Feb 21, 2003"

3.62,-9,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"(Bottled Xmas eve-02)-- Pours a light mahogany color. Head is initially average sized, frothy, light brown, but mostly diminishing. On the nose the aroma of caramel, peanuts, milk chocolate and roasted grain. Mouthfeel is fairly smooth. On the palate the flavors of roasted coffee beans, peanuts, roasted malts, buttery, charcoal, caramel, milk chocolate, and bittersweet flavors. Overall good mellow stout.","WilliamPhilaPa","0"
