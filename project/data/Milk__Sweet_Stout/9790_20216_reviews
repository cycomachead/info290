"This is an excellent milk stout that is really the benchmark that all other milk stouts should be judged."
""
"I love milk stouts ever since I gave them a try for curiosities sake. It was, at first, the brewer who drew me to the beer (Wittgenstein's infamous duck-rabbit). Nonetheless, the flavour struck me as rather soothing for a beer. It is dark and a tad-bit heavy (though not too much)."

""
""
""

"Velvety smooth stout with cheerwine, tobacco & coco puff flavors.  Very nice."

"Good regional beer, not the best, but a good way to introduce yourself to the style."
""
""
"Overall:  This is a really good milk stout.  I really like the flavors of dark chocolate, vanilla and malt that this beer imparts.  Really good."
""
"Overall: Pretty good Milk Stout. It's a bit different from most milk/sweet stouts I've had before. Definitely worth a try."
"Pruod to have this as a regional beer. Full flavor,great on the palate."
""
"Overall, not a bad introduction to the style though I think I prefer other stout varieties (coffee, RIS etc)"
""
"It's not the best Milk Stout I've ever had but it's well done and very tasty."
"Pours from the growler with an extremely dark brown tar-like color, verging on pitch black. The spongy, mocha head falls quickly, leaving a resilient thin layer on the surface and an appetizing collar around the glass. Pronounced cocoa powder smell with nondescript fruity esters. Faint sour breads and mild smoke in the nose. Now the first sip. Surprisingly sweet milk sugars in the front, and an equally surprising tart, sour cream taste in the finish.  The aftertaste is ashy, with lingering burnt malts. The lactose imparts a distinctive table sugar sweetness and near spoiled, sour milk tang. Any semblance of cocoa is quickly overshadowed by this competing dynamic. The ABV is modest, but I detect a small amount of fusel alcohol.  Medium mouthfeel, with snappy, crisp carbonation. Perhaps too spritzy for the style. I seem to recall this having a much creamier texture and milder carbonation when I had it from a bottle. My companions arrived at the same independent conclusion. The last time I had this (late 2013) I couldn't wait to grab another one. This time, not so much. It's possible that my palate has evolved, but I'm fairly certain this has much more to do with the carbonation. Overall, this is an ideal selection for lovers of sweet beer. I can see where the surprising tartness could throw some people for a loop, but without it, this would quickly become too sugary. I'll stick with Westbrook or Left Hand, but wouldn't pass this up if offered. I just hope it's offered in a bottle instead of a growler."
""
"From my tasting notes (2009):  The best sweet stout, or milk stouts, I've ever tasted.  The impressive thing to me about this was the slight sourness to the flavor like near spoiling milk.  Real genuine milkiness from a beer.  This is a real work of art.  The mouthfeel and carbonation are also prefect.  The craving to drink another and another, just doesn't quit."
""
"Can't really taste the lactose but it has a very smooth creamy feel and a great finish"
""
""
""
"Good. Wish I had tested before tasting a better stout."
""
""
"One of my favorite milk stouts out there. Great overall!"
""
""
"Great sweet dark flavor. Right up my alley."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"great brew. manages to be extremely flavorful, and slightly earthy, yet sublimely drinkable. pours near black with some red/clear highlights. The beer is a bit thin, and well-carbed, but it's all made up for in the taste with the lactose and and the smooth dark malt flavors. This is about the only stout that I can literally pound a whole bottle in one slow motion and be happy. Not because I can, but because it's just freakin tasty and drinkably thin."

"Pours black with a fluffy tan head that did not disappear. Aroma is of malted chocolate, and roasted coffee. Body is medium with some carbonation. Taste is of roasted coffee up front, with hints of chocolate through out. Not bad."
""
""
""
""
"Pours pitch black with a mocha head that dissipates somewhat quickly. Smells sweet-consisting of chocolate, some coffee, and a hint of roasted malts. Tastes somewhat sweet with some roast/coffee bitterness balancing it out. Flavors that stand out are creamy coffee, chocolate, and a hint of roast.  I got some Belgian yeast like flavor which seemed odd to me because I have had this beer before and didn't get this flavor. It tastes great and has a slick, yet creamy mouthfeel. The mouthfeel is great. The drinkability is high because its not too sweet and has a relatively low abv. This is a very, very good beer and I'm a little ashamed I haven't drank more of it since its so readily available in NC."

"Poured as a dark brown with an almost caramel head. Very nice coffee aroma with a hint of cream. Has a upfront coffee taste with a nice creamy almost chocolate after taste. It is heavy on the mouth almost milky. Not too much on the hoppy side. Seems to be a great milk stout. Be one of my go to's for a milk stout"
""
""
""
"What I got to drink was enjoyable.  Too bad every attempt at pouring it resulted in an eruption of froth; almost entirely head blasting out of the bottle like a beer geyser.  Will need to try again..."

"O. this time I will stick to my guns and pass on the Duck Rabbit .  There are so many other choices that offer the same taste profile but with more of a creamy lower carbonated beer. AKA left handed Nitro , Lancaster Milk Stout , Terrapin Moohoo to name a fewâ€¦"

"Duck Rabbit can do some great things. Their milk stout falls into that category. It's creamy and rich with bold flavors but remains extremely drinkable. The balance is there. This needs to be purchased by the case."

"Overall / Drinkability: Full flavored, interesting, and good with desert (chocolate peanut butter banana bread). I suspect it would be a very good base for ice cream floats and probably would go well with a burger also. Not sure I would want more than one per evening though, but I think I would definitely pick up a six pack next time I see it. Other than a weak aroma - a good beer."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""

"O - If the carbonation were toned down a bit, this would be a very enjoyable and above average beer. With the distracting prickliness, it is just okay."

"Poured a nearly black with a short-lived light tan head. No lacing is left. The aroma is mild but does have nice deep roasted malt notes with a little earthiness. The taste is just straightforward deep roasted malt with just a little sweetness from the lactose. It has a decent weight to the body and a silky feel and finish. It's another very good dark beer from this brewery."

"O-A well done Milk Stout. Never too sweet without proper accompanying bitterness. Better balance of flavors than many within this style."
""
"O-never had a milk stout before. Did expect more creaminess and sweetness but got neither. Still a very good beer with exceptional flavor."
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a cloudy, black color. 1/3 inch head of an off-tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of chocolate, slight hop, sweet malt, caramel malt, alcohol, yeast, and oatmeal. Fits the style of a Milk / Sweet Stout. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with a low carbonation level. Tastes of oatmeal, slight hop, sweet malt, slight yeast, hint of roasted malt, and a hint of chocolate. Overall, good aroma, feel, and appearance, but the body was only average."

"TOTAL - 30/50"

"Overall a solid beer. I would drink again for sure. That being said it is lacking in some areas. The first being the appearance. I love a nice head on my stouts and this beer just seems to not retain a proper head well at all. I think this affects my ability to properly judge the smell but what i can smell is a bit of toffee or caramel. The taste is surprisingly crisp for a milk stout but i don.t mind that. A great aftertaste in my opinion too some surprising biter notes in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is pretty thin. This combines with the crisp initial taste to give this milk stout a very clean and enjoyable character. Will have it again."

"Deep brown hue and is only letting a bit of light through when held up to light. A quarter inch of tightly woven khaki colored head. Brussels lacing. Aroma of cocoa powder and lactose greets my nose. The body is silky smooth and creamy. I get cocoa and lactose quickly fading away when I take a taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very carbonated. Poured with a very tall tan head. A lot of carbonation which you can tell based on the pop of the bottle cap. The beer itself is dark brown. Smells of roasted malts, slight coffee and chocolate. Nutty and bready too. The taste is of dark, roasted malts as well as chocolate and espresso. It's a medium bodied brew that's smooth and sticky. Very solid beer here."

"O: somewhat similar to their porter, just a few notches sweeter and less citrus-bitter than it... reminds me mostly of moderately-sweetened, malty dark-roast coffee (or alcoholic malta)... pretty dang good, though I'm not sure I'd drink more than two in one sitting"
"Overall a good, solid milk stout from the Philosopher. A bit too much char up front and a bit sticky of a mouthfeel at the end, but all in all an enjoyable beer."

"It pours into a very dark brown with a substantial head and a foamy white ring around the top of the glass. The smell is the typical stout aroma of dark chocolate and vanilla with a bit of coffee as well. The taste is the same mix but is actually alot more drinkable and sweet than most brews of this style. It feels slightly syrupy but with noticeable carbonation and a smoothness that I didn't really expect. Overall, I'm not a massive stout fan or anything but this seems like a really drinkable and enjoyable variation."

"O- A very tasty stout that is easy to drink. I was pleased with this one and look forward to having it again."
"Overall (4.00) - solid milk stout. Flavors are not incredible but are individually good. The sessionable quality makes this pretty appealing to me for this style."

"Bottle at The Fortunate Glass in Wilmington. Black pour with small white head. Big roasted coffee notes and a bit of lactose. Flavor follows with lots of roasty. Prickly carbonation between sweet waves of lactose. A bit thin but not watery by any means. Solid for the style."
"Poured from the bottle into a mug, the beer is a dark brown-to-black with mahogany highlights and a low profile, frothy, light tan head. Aromas of coffee roast and bitter, cream sweetness, and hints of bittersweet chocolate. Awesomely balanced nose. Flavors are roast forward, with hints of smoke and char on a milk chocolate, cream, and bitter coffee blend. Very balanced flavors, with a slightly lactic build providing more sweetness towards the end of the palate. Thin, dry body leading to a bitter and roasted aftertaste, with a bittersweet chocolate backbone. The finish is slick and smooth, with a bitter and roasted linger remaining. Very drinkable with the lower ABV and thin body, and the flavors come across robust, almost to the point of huge. I really like this beer."
""
""

""

"To say I liked it a lot is an understatement. And then I tried it with, of all things, a Shout-Out Girl Scout cookie. For those that donâ€™t know, this is the Girl Scout version of a Biscoff Speculaas cookie. OMG. This made the beer SING. The clove & ginger notes really played up the sweeter vanilla undertones of the beer, and balanced out the bitter finish. I think it would be MARVELOUS with Tikka Masala."
""
""
"This is a solid milk stout. It has some characteristics that I really like and some not so much. It's kind of weird, but unique. One second I'm loving it, and the next I'm questioning it. Overall it's not bad."
""
""
""
"Brought some bottles home from an OBX vacation. Poured into a chalice glass for review. Pours a very dark amber (wouldn't have known if not held up to the light), otherwise seems black. Nice off-white head with lacing that clings to the glass. Smells of lactose and light roast. Some subtle chocolate and cocoa. Hops aren't evident besides bitterness except perhaps a woody or earthy undertone. Tastes roasty with lactose milk and a nice velvety feel that coats the tongue. Feels medium-full bodied but drinks ever so smooth. Drinks dry as there's not a lot of sweetness. Overall, a very nice milk stout. A quality beer with alcohol well in check."
"O: The look and the feel aren't great, but this is quite good otherwise. If this was readily available in my state, I'd definitely drink it again."
""
"Not bad beer. Poured from a growler into a 16oz glass. It is very dark with a decent tan head. The aroma is just not there. You cant smell the lactose but thats about it. It could have been because the growler was about 10 days old. Saying that it was a pretty good beer. It is very sweet and malty. The lactose takes over and you get a lot of it up front. In the back end you get hints of chocolate and it is very sweet. It goes down smooth. At only 5.7%, it is a good beer in any situation for being such a dark beer."

"12oz bottle poured into a room temperature goblet. smell is sweet hints of cocoa. Deep black color almost no head. First sip is chocolate and milky. That first sip is very enjoyable an adult chocolate milk if you will, the lactose is very present and some roasted characteristics come through as well as the chocolate. The second sip is pretty much the same and that is where my only problem with this beer comes in there is no second level of flavor, no added depth to take it from a good beer to a great beer. I would however drink it again but i may not seek it out."
""
""

"Bottom line: I'LL HAVE ANOTHER"

"O: A very good easy drinking milk stout. good balance between sweet and bitter with a fantastic ending. Would recommend. /87"
""
""
""

""
""
"Typical aroma of coffee, milk chocolate, with a hint of dark fruit. The flavor is coffee, French Vanilla, oatmeal, and an odd note of plum. Mouthfeel is thick and full, almost like syrup. Just a bit too sweet, would be better without the plum. A decent beer. Recommended."

"O - while I'm not going to claim Duck-Rabbit are indeed the specialists of dark beer as this is the first stout I've had from them, I will however lay claim that this is one of the best crafted milk/sweet stouts america or anywhere else for that matter has to offer in terms of keeping it below 6% abv. While I've enjoyed many bigger milk stouts better than the Duck-Rabbit I can't quite get over how well made it really is. Nearly all the milk/sweet stouts I've had have had top shelf flavors but I just couldn't finish them due to the intense sweetness, but these guys somehow have created one all the while keeping the ridiculous sweetness and rich flavors but balancing it just enough to get me through the entire 12 oz bottle. Very good milk stout and worth the try for stout lovers and rich milky sweet stout lovers in general."
""
""
""
""
"Fine as milk stouts go, but not exceptional. Would not turn it down."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It is nice and creamy with a big enough body, but I feel a stout, this style included, could use a little more of it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not the greatest drinking milk stout (That's for Left Hand), but it's a good showing from a brewery that usually disappoints me. I wouldn't want to drink more than the bottle in a week, but that one is worth drinking. A bit too sweet overall and that's the worst of it. Almost balanced otherwise."

"OVERALL: Duck-Rabbit's Milk Stout is so stylistically sound that I'd personally like to give every Beer Advocate that follows the Friedrich Nietzsche herding theory, and migrates towards the modern barrel-aged Russian Imperial Stout's, a bottle of this brew and tell them to go learn something about what a stout really is. Absolutely phenomenal example of the style."
""
""
"Poured from a twelve inch bottle into a New Belgium globe, the appearance is a deep mahogany with a nice two finger caramel colored head, a little retention and a little lacing. The smell is nice. Chocolate is the predominant note. There are other things too, but my nose is not always able to discern what and all is there. Taste is very sweet up front and a little syruppy tasting. The finish is a nice mild dark chocolate and coffee. Not a game changer, but a nice offereing."
""
"O: A solid offering thy would be a great beer to keep in the fridge. The dark fruit and melon really made this different but refreshing. I like that it was not as rich and sweet as some milk stouts but it really had simple but good flavors. I will drink this again for sure."
"dam so wanted to taste this beer and what a disappointed smells boozy taste boozy but does nothing for me i dont to drink anything by duck rabbit any more yes its dark but i dont taste anything in this beer that makes want todrink it again just taste like a high octane beer read the othe reviews because i did i just dont like this beer"

"O/D - Quite simple, but also quite nice. The lacto adds a nice element and it stays balanced and doesn't cloy. Well put together."

"Overall â€“ Not bad although the slightly bitter flavor at the end of the taste, which didnâ€™t meld so well with the roasted and sweeter lactose tastes, takes away from the beer a bit. Although not the best milk stout in my opinion, it is well worth a try if you have the opportunity."

"Received a 12 oz bottle as a gift from Magoo. Poured into two half-pint glasses. Dark black color. Not much head. Decent lacing though. Nice smell of dark chocolate. Taste was very good. Flavors of caramel and hot cocoa. Mouthfeel was quite smooth, which was the most impressive aspect of the beer. This is a great example of the style and this brewery's version should really be considered one of the benchmarks."
"Overall- Love it. My favorite beer."

""
""
"Pours a dark black with a small head with low retention and medium lacing. It smells amazing. It smells amazingly chocolately and almost immediately hoppy. The initial taste is coffee and then roasted malts and a cascade of hops. It is medium bodied with average carbonation. I love this beer and will recommend to anyone who has not experienced this great beer from eastern North Carolina."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very nice stout. Was probably looking for not sweetness and creamy notes from the lactose. Still an enjoyable beer though."

"O: This is a very enjoyable beer and one that I have been enjoying for going on a decade now - and one that I missed once I left NC for Northern NJ. There is a nice rich flavor and aroma to the beer that makes it very enjoyable and it has just enough sweetness (and low enough ABV) that it is easy to drink. One of my favorite everyday beers for the winter."

"O: This is a pretty good milk stout. Although the nose isn't that great, I think the taste is one of the best of the milk stouts I've had."
""
""

"O- A good beer, nice tasting, the mouthfeel/viscosity needs a lot if improvement to call this great though, and it might prevent me from buying this again."

""
"O- I enjoyed this beer as mentioned above, I would suggest atleast giving it a go. It was nice, and something I am not really used to."
""
""
""
""
""
"T: Roasted malt with some chocolate covered currants, which lead a touch of tartness. Some watered down coffee and cola nut on the finish. A little light on the mouthfeel but still has a nice creaminess to it."
""
"O - Delicious ""everyday"" stout. I like others by Duck Rabbit better, but easily see why this is their most marketable beer! Good one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I like this beer quite a lot. The aroma could be improved, but it's a solid sweet stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: nice color but coffee flavor a bit overpowering."
""
""
""
""
"This one was more of a smokey stout than a milk stout. The smoke really took away from the lactose. The sweet had almost been used to patch up the smokiness. It's a nice beer, but not exactly what I'm looking for in a milk stout."
""
"If there is.another that anyone knows of that is similar, I.would be more than happy to try it out."
""
""
""
""
"O: This was OK, but left something to be desired. This had some off flavors - not enough to ruin the beer, but there's some flaws here. Worth trying, but my first experience with Duck-Rabbit was less than stellar."
""
""
""
"D/O: It's fine. Certainly not something I'd refuse if offered. But I feel like there are better options available elsewhere."

"o: I enjoy that this beer is leans towards the bitter and roast side but there are several flaws that should be corrected before I could appreciate the beer and raise the score. I'm not that great a describing the off flavors and aromas I sense but something isn't right with this one."
""
""
""
"O â€“ This is a pretty good milk stout. Itâ€™s very drinkable for sure, but there are a few weaknesses. For one, I would like to see better head retention and lacing. Also, the taste just doesnâ€™t have as much complexity as the aroma. I was expecting a bit more milk chocolate in the taste, but I mostly got fruits and milk sugar. Finally, the body is a bit too light for a stout with a little bit too much carbonation. Regardless, this is a tasty beer and a decent example of a milk stout."

"Poured from bottle into NB tulip glass. Has a dark cola appearance, very little head. Not great. Smell- smells like Dr. Pepper and liquorice, not much else. Taste- tea leaves, liquorice, Dr Pepper, with a metallic and bitter ending. This is unremarkable and falls short of my standard for milk stout (left hand). I'll pour this out in favor of something more tasty tonight. Also, has a stingy mouthfeel. Not many great redeeming qualities here. Blah."
""
"Not one of the better stouts out there."
"O - Overall, that weird metallic taste and aroma really destroyed this beer for me. So unfortunate."

"D- Heavy and hearty. A pleasant drinking experience, but one or maybe two a night is just fine. After finishing this up, I was definitely in need of a pilsner to cleanse the palate."

"A very drinkable sweet stout, I love it. It's a fairly simple beer, in that I could only detect a couple of flavors but all the flavors were fully developed. This is a great beer for people who don't drink a lot of stouts as the sweetness balances out the malt really well. I'll definitely pick this up whenever I can and will seek out other Duck-Rabbit beers. Hopefully, Duck-Rabbit will be distributed in FL soon."
"overall this is a phenomenal session stout. very flavorful which makes it pretty complex in comparison to most milk stouts. wish we got this around nj!"

"Served in a 16oz standard pint glass. Pours a deep brown color with hazelnut appearing head that froths and then disappears rather quickly. The nose is rather astringent, but with a deep coffee character. The body was rather lighter than I would have expected, but not too light; middle of the road I would say. Taste was full of deep, roasted malt; lots of coffee flavors that carry over from the nose. Lots of alcohol taste."

"Overall a pretty good beer. The taste is great at first but that lactose really cuts though as the beer warms and it's a little too much."
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's a bit on the light side, which makes it very drinkable, but I feel like the carbonation hides some of the more subtle flavors, and the presentation is uneventful to say the least. Still, it's a solid brew despite, and one I'd recommend for the price, but probably not something I'd buy regularly."

"Anyway, maybe someone might like the sour chocolate tones of this beer, but I found it pretty unpleasant (especially when expecting something else). Smells better than it tasted. Either there are quality control issues, or Duck Rabbit needs to address why this isn't up to par with what I would expect from the ""Dark Beer Specialist"""
""
""
"Transparent dark brown with a very light khaki colored head. Smoked sesame seeds, milk chocolate, roasted coffee and rolled oats. Odd and robust sesame seed and burnt malt tang on the initial sip, followed by smoother tones of milk chocolate, heavy cream and oats. Cleaner, drier, chocolaty finish. Medium to light bodied with moderate carbonation. This brew almost tastes like it went sour but the exp. date is this year."
""
"O: Ahhh what a great milk stout. One of the best, maybe second only to Moloko. It's silky smooth, creamy and loaded with chocolate. Just what you want for the style. If it were a little bit of a bigger beer it would be a 4.5+ in every category I think."
"I like milk stouts generally, but this one is weird. I smell chocolate and coffee and toffee like I'd expect, but it seems a little too carbonated and not creamy enough for me. And strangely enough, it tastes very strongly of toasted sesame oil. Seriously--the beer tastes just like Asian noodles."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a very dark brown color with a tan head. The aroma is full of chocolate and coffee, with some lactose and cream notes thrown in. The flavor is more of the same. The coffee and cream notes are front and center, with some chocolate and light to medium roasted malt also thrown in. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice sweet stout."
"Overall much better and more complex than expected."
"Overall, I'm fairly impressed at this one. After trying Left Hand and Lancaster Milk Stouts, The Duck-Rabbit and Mikkeller have me convinced to keep trying this style."
""
"I like that I can get stout aromas and flavors without getting the high alcohol content of an imp stout. A very tasty brew that I would enjoy again."

"Overall I thought that this was a pretty good beer and I thought it was a pretty good example of a Milk Stout, it had just about everything think I look for in a good Milk Stout. This beer had pretty good drinkability, it went down pretty smooth, and had enough flavor to hold my attention, I could drink a couple of these in a row and if I had another one I would drink it. I recommend this beer to just about anyone and if your a fan of Milk Stouts, I think this is a must try and worth the effort to obtain. What I liked most about this beer was the aroma and the taste, they were right where they should be at for the style and I liked them a lot. What I liked least about this beer was the Mouthfeel, it was pretty much the only downfall of this beer and if it was a little thicker and less carbonated it would be pretty close to perfect. I would for sure buy this again but Duck-Rabbit isn't distributed in Michigan so who knows when I will have the chance to try to this beer again. I was pretty impressed with this beer and it made for a great first impression for this brewery, I am glad this beer didn't disappoint as I was really looking forward to trying it and I was happy that it lived up to my expectations. Good job Duck-Rabbit this was one awesome beer and you can bet that I will be searching out more of your brews, I see good things in the future for this brewery. One of the better Milk Stouts I have had."

"Dark brown colour, ring of off white head with no lace left behind. Smell is milky, roasted malts, lots of coffee, light milk chocolate scents as well as some nutty notes. Taste is of sour milk and roast, coffee, chocolate milk and some mild bitterness with some sweet points. Mouthfeel is quite light, light carbonation with a fairly light body. Not bad and glad to have tried this, would like to try something else from these guys as opposed to coming back to this one though."

"Sour milk stout, highly lactic, yogurt. suggested improvement is to regain control over that. Beyond that aspect, a decent drinker of milk and coffee. So-so, Not one I would again.Dark brown with a thin creamy topping. Coffee aroma.Suitable carbonation. Thanks Ken."

"The palate is dry, but flavorfully roasty. I wish I could get this on tap in IL somewhere."

"O- a good milk stout. Doesn't quite measure up to my local example, Lancaster Brewing Milk Stout, but few do. Another solid effort for Duck Rabbit"

"Thanks redliner8? hahahahha."

"I found this beer simple, but in a good way. I enjoyed the texture and the over all taste was interesting enough that I enjoyed it and would have easily had another. For sure a kick back stout that does require you to think about it."

"Cost: $8.99 for a six pack."

"O - This is the best milk stout I've ever had. Worth my trip to Raleigh to try it."
"Overall: I would go back to this beer but I might wait until I try all that is out there first. But I certainly don't regret the second bottle in the fridge that I know my girlfriend will not drink."
"DRINKABILITY: I could consume this stout all night long. While there's nothing particularly moving about it, it has a good price-performance ratio and is easy to drink. I'll definitely buy it again. It's not best of breed by any means but it is a solid, dependable beer that I would be happy to have and to serve again and again."

"O - I liked this milk stout quite a bit. It was certainly creamy and smooth, and had a bit of sweetness that was far from cloying. The flavor wasn't as bold or robust as some others within the style, but was still a delicious blend of chocolate and roasty character. Overall, this beer fits right in with the style and is one I intend to try again soon."
"Cheers!"
""
""
"O: A tasty, well-made beer."
"I have been a fan of Duck Rabbit for years, but this is the first time in the last decade that I got my hands on some. This is a very sessionable Stout. Very few I can think of that I might be able to drink an entire sixer of but this is one of 'em. Great brunt malt smell with just a bit of chocolate in the nose. Very smooth light body that really compliments the taste. Like many people, I too wish I could pick this up in NY. Maybe some day."

"I picked this one up on a recent holiday journey. I don't have access to a ton of milk stouts, but I thought this beer was quite good. I really like genuine milk stouts and this is one that is nicely-crafted and relatively easy to find. It's not on the same level as 3F Moloko, but it's a heckuvalot cheaper and a heckuvalot easier to find. If you like milk stouts, don't pass this one up."

"Overall a decent stout if you do not want to get too crazy, or just want something lite to end the night with. Not too sweet, and not too malty, but a decent beer to start off one's stout career with."

"As milk stouts and imperial stouts seem to be rolling out with the New Year from all over the country, I highly suggest finding this dark ale as a peer to the best I have had to date."
"Overall, this is a very nice beer. A nice balance of sweet and roasty flavors makes this one of the most balanced sweet/milk stouts I have tried. Very nice"
"O - I only have high expecations from this brewery as i have not yet had a beer that dissapointed me and i was really stoked when i got this as an extra. I havent had too many milk stouts but from the few that i have had this is probably one of better examples. I will definitely try to trade for this beer again."

"o - overall i've noticed a certain signature flavor in duck rabbit brews and this beer has it. pretty solid milk stout. nice treat...good robust flavors."

"O: Duck Rabbit is an east coast brewery that never disappoints me. This beer really is great and stands to its name. Give it a shot!"

"The color wasn't bad? That's not saying much though."
"O - Definitely give this one a try, even if stout's aren't normally your thing."
"Mouthfeel - Not high carbonation, but not thick either. Light enough to be consumed easily, but not heavy enough to promote any real stout flavors."
"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a 1 inch foamy khaki head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, caramel or toffee, and some coffee aromas. Taste is of toasted/roasted dark malt, coffee grounds, and some sweet lactose flavors. A roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a crisp mouthfeel with a good level of carbonation. Overall, this is a solid and tasty milk stout."
"O: Overall a great tasting milk stout. Can hold its own against Left Hand. Wish we got this in Nashville."
"Pours black with a thick light brown head. The head lingers for a little but dissipates as you drink it. Has a sweet aroma and is almost like a cold mocha cappuccino. Drinks easy and feels pretty good in the mouth has low carbonation. It tastes almost like a cold cappuccino that is of good quality. A good beer after a long day of work."
"Really a well done beer. Seems to have a little bit of everything I enjoy in a stout going on."
"Overall, a really solid milk stout definitely worth seeking out if you like the style."
"O: I think this is a fantastic milk stout. This isn't my favorite style of beer, but I think this brew is quite good. I'm happy to have tried it."
"Overall- I was really happy with this beer! Is now one of my favorite milk stouts and if I can get again I wouldn't hesitate to buy! Cheers"
"O_An interesting milk stout but overall one with flaws. The strong alcohol is too much for this style."
"OA: I like it but it doesn't stand out to me. I could sit and drink it but if you switched it with a Left Hand MS I probably wouldnt notice it."
"Overall, just too much fruit for me and it really takes away from the sweetened coffee/espresso flavors I expect in the style."
"Overall, a good beer. Its lacking the sweetness normally associated with the style, and the carbonation is a bit too intense, but a good beer nonetheless."
"Great beer!"
"Overall, nicely done presentation of this style. Flavors are solid and not overly sweet for the style."
"Cheers!"
"Overall this was a very good beer. It borderlines on beging too coffee and roasted malt dominiant for my tastes but the milk sugar definitely helps to temper and add the right amount of sweetness. I enjoyed this beer the Saturday morning of homecoming weekend and it made the perfect breakfest beer to start out the day."
"Thanks again Brian."
"It is an awesome beer all around and will be one of my new go to Stouts."
"Pours a dark brown w/ a sliver of a cocoa head. Head quickly disappears. Decent lacing on this brew. Nose is that of chocolate, coffee, vanilla, milk and some mild hops. Not bad- and pretty much on point for the style. Taste is exactly the same as the nose. Full bodied feel for the style- smooth like silk w/ a mild hop bitterness/coffee bitterness in the background. Not bad. Overall, this is a good beer for the style, and I would drink this again."
"Can't remember the last time I had the feeling I would never drink a finer beer in a certain style. This is possibly the finest possible achievement in this style. If you love your taste buds treat them to this."
"It is what it is. It's decent, I didn't enjoy it much, but I wouldn't be against having another bottle."
"Drinkability is pretty good for the style, which I really don't care for."
"Pitch black pour, nice light tan head forms up and lingers around with some decent lacing. Lots of roasted malt and some coffee in the nose, milk chocolate makes its presence as well. Robust, rich and roasty taste, coffee, chocolate malts, and ginger root merge together nicely. Nice mild and creamy sweetness, not too overwhelming like many other milk stouts out there. Bit of tobacco as well. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with mild carbonation. Overall, one of my favorites time and time again. A great example of the style and a prime offering from the great state of NC!"
"Duck Rabbit Milk Stout pours jet black, with just under two fingers of caramel colored foam crowning it. Retention is alright, the head cuts itself in half pretty quickly, but lingers for a long time. The ring of lacing left around the top of the glass isn't quite solid, but it's pretty full and nice looking nonetheless. The nose is very heavy on coffee and vanilla, with those two coming together to smell like coffee that's had a healthy bit of cream added to it. The flavor is again centered around coffee and vanilla, but they don't integrate and fill my palate as well as they do in the aroma. The flavor comes across as a little too dry, and there's a spot mid palate that's just begging for a little bit of chocolate that never comes. Despite the somewhat dry flavor, the body itself is nice and full. The carbonation's just a little too active for it's own good though, taking away from the malty center of the beer at times. In general I've really liked the Duck Rabbit beers I've had, and while the Milk Stout is good, the high expectations I have for their beers now weren't quite met."
"O- Was wanting more of a sweet/milky taste and it didn't happen for me. A little too much coffee flavor. More like a watered down stout than a milk stout. While it was okay, I'm not sure I will pick up anymore-"
"Overall Drinkability - A little too thin bodied and one dimensional in the taste. Has the skeleton of a mmilk stout but doesn't flesh it out with the desired characters."
"This is a solid milk stout. A solid offering from Duck Rabbit."
"Medium-bodied start with a light effervescence. Slight wateriness. Finishes lighter than it starts. Aftertaste is like a cup of coffee with a cigarette in it and I hate both of those things. Won't be having this again."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Body is medium, with very fine carbonation. Starts out a bit less than creamy when cold, but as it warms does obtain that creaminess. Excellent. Overall, I was very pleased to try this beer. Milk stouts are one of my under the radar favorites, and this is a great example. Would definitely have again."
"O: This is a quality beer and I like it better, as I do with many beers, as it begins to warm a bit. The flavors become richer and much more noticeable as the temperature rises."
"O: Really nice stout! Recommended. Very drinkable, if a bit bitter. I'd love to have another."
"Overall an excellent beer. Sorry this isn't available in the Midwest."
"A really nice beer..not a huge, booming stout by any means but a bit of an easy drinker for the style. Mouthfeel is good but perhaps lacking in the creaminess you'd expect from a milk stout. Solid, though."
"O- The lack of carbonation is so underwhelming!!! Tons of coffee... not a whole lot else going on here! Creamy mouthfeel, not really that much to write or brag about here! Average at best!"
"O Very impressed with this beer. This is my first milk stout and I loved it. Will be seeking more of this beer and of the style."
"A medium to light bodied Stout, but very enjoyable and drinkable. Interesting approach!"
"overall - good enough, but not great."
"O â€“ Clearly a bad bottle. Iâ€™ll have to come back and try this again next time I can find a bottle."
"O - Strong flavored, slick bodied brew. Fairly deep flavors proportioned appropriately."
"O: It isn't a bad beer but I was hoping for a little more from this company I've heard good things about. Seems like a middle of the road milk stout that doesn't really pull me towards liking it or hating it. Maybe with a few small tweaks this would be a bigger draw."
"Pours dark brown to the point of black, but has very little head (about a single layer of tan bubbles that dissipates quickly). A small amount of wet lacing clings to the glass. Smell is of white cane sugar, roasted malt, coffee grounds, and some chocolate. Taste is similar, with some sugar in the front, the coffee and chocolate in the middle, and some roastiness (almost a char flavor) on the finish. Perhaps a touch of vanilla on the exhale as well. Not very complex, as all the flavors seem to be right up front, but still enjoyable. Mouth is very smooth, with the carbonation dancing nicely off the tongue. Overall, a very quaffable milk stout that I'm happy to have tried. Thanks again Jay, looking forward to enjoying the other one you sent."
"O- A perfect looking stout with a perfect mouthfeel, just great. When comparing to Left Hand Milk Stout I think I like Left Hand's taste a little more, but Duck Rabbit as a whole gets the edge because of the incredible mouthfeel and drinkablity of this beer."
"O: I feel bad reviewing this beer. I'm guessing my bottle may have been old or compromised in transportation (no dent on the trader, he's a great guy and bought this beer only a month or two ago). I'd be glad to retry this incredibly fresh but until then not touching this beer again."
"O: This is an excellent Milk Stout and one I would be buying on a regular basis if it was in my area. Great flavors and aromas."
"Overall a good stout, I would drink it again if it was sitting around but I wouldn't go out of my way to find it."
"One last final note - It tastes like a lighter version of 2011 KBS. not real sure if thats a good thing or a bad thing."
"O: Overall not a bad milk stout , a little thin and not very complex, easy drinking and could be considered a session stout, I would drink it again."
"This is a drinkable milk stout. I like the coffee and vanilla qualities. Very filling."
"Overall: This is a very solid beer with good availability in my area. I recommend trying it."
"I was lucky enough to try this again, and this time enjoy it. The stout pours black with a hue of red. It also gives off an aroma of sweet milk, bready malt, and slight raisin. As for taste, it is extremely tasty. It has a dark chocolate, roast, sweet milk, and some nuttyness. For mouthfeel, it is extremely smooth with light carbonation. Overall, a very enjoyable beer, especially for a milk stout. It doesnt have an overpowering sweetness like most milk stouts, but a slight sweetness that accentuates sweetness of the malt. I would definitely love to try the Coffee infused version of this."
"O: A solid milk stout by a solid brewery. Very enjoyable. I'll have to try and snag some more in the cooler weather. I picture a fire pit and cigar."
"O - Overall a good beer to enjoy while cooking in the kitchen."
"O: This is a very solid beer and another winner from Duck Rabbit. I really hope they make their way to Middle Tennessee soon."
"Anybody know of a great imperial stout with the texture and mouthfeel of a milk stout?"
"Medium to full bodied with a strong amount of carbonation, this beer coats your mouth well but vanishes somewhat quickly. The carbonation is not prickly at all, but instead adds a creaminess that combines nicely with the flavors."
"O- Very solid offering. I believe they do know how to make their dark beers."
"Cheers!"
"A very nice, smoky milk stout. One of the better ones I've had. Main complaint is the thin mouthfeel. I like how the smoked flavors combine well with the dark malts and the sweetness."
"All in all, pretty good. Not aggressively roasted like some others, this is a pretty easy drinking stout."
"O- Overall a very nice milk stout that I wish was distributed to OH. Glad I got the chance to try this while visiting a friend in GA."
"O: Solid stout.... I would drink this again. Well brewed fellows."
"Overall: A worthy contender, especially if you like a bolder hop profile in your stouts. I wish I could replicate the mouthfeel of this beer in some others!"
"Pours a pitch very dark brown with billowing tan head, slowly settles leaving a whole bunch of styrofoamy lace on the glass. Smell: sweet, very mild roast and coffee, edging towards brown bread and raisins. Taste: milk chocolate with raisins, mild roast, grainy twang. Feel is a little bit more carbonated that I'd like; medium bodied, earthy and sweet but unexpectedly drying finish. Pretty nice beer overall. Notched as best by 12. 2012? Dec 2011?"
"O: a good milk stout but not my favorite, a little thin for the style"
"O â€“ My favorite milk stout to date. Has a great flavor with a fantastic mouthfeel. I could session this all night thought it certainly is not what is thought of as a session beer."
"Creamy and smooth. Pours very dark (beautiful) with a nice milky head. Smells lightly toasted with a nice sweetness. Tastes very roasted at first but then mid thru finish is sweet. Mouth feel was slightly heavy to mid. Laces very well. Very much enjoyed the stout."
"The body was fairly typical, full without being heavy, and nicely smooth, with a fair bit of bubbly effervescence on the tongue. Drinkability was good and easy. Overall, a nice little brew, that's worth trying when you can."
"O: Not what I was expecting. There is a big sweetness followed by a rather big bitterness in the finish. I think it is too extreme on both ends. But it is above average beer and if you like your stouts to have a big full roasted flavor, then this is your beer."
"O - Very interesting, with more bitterness then I expected. I was expecting more sweet flavors, but I enjoyed this overall, and really dug the dark malt and earthiness."
"The Milk Stout pours out of the bottle as a dark creamy looking black liquid. The head is a nice shade of brown that looks pretty thick as well. The smell of the beer was heavily roasted and had some sweet creamy malt aromas. The taste of the beer was rich with chocolate malts and some burnt toast flavors. The mouthfeel is on the heavier side leaving a creamy oily feeling in th mouth which I liked a lot. Overall this is a pretty good tasting stout. I would drink this one again."
"Overall - Definitely a go-to milk stout for me. I like to compare it to the Left Hand brewery's milk stout, with Duck Rabbit's being more coffee based while Left Hand's being more sweetness. Not exactly an educated opinion, but mine nonetheless :]"
"Overall an ok beer. Probably would have it again just won't seek it out."
"It's not a bad beer, it's actually pretty good, but it just didn't quite impress me as a milk stout. There is no sweetness whatsoever, it's nothing more than a regular stout."
"O - Decent milk stout"
"Just outstanding. This is one of, if not THE, best milkstouts I've ever had. I highly recommend this beer to anyone."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of roasted malts and chocolate. Taste is the same, only more pronounced, lots of malty and chocolate flavor here. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid offering."
"O: Overall, a good milk stout that suffers a bit from having too much carbonation in the body and bitter roasted malts present in the flavor profile. Still, it's definitely one of the better representations of the style."
"O: Overall, pretty good. It lost a little of its creaminess as it warmed, but there was a sweet chocolate flavor that worked well. Tasty stuff."
"O: This is fantastic like all other Duck-Rabbit stouts."
"O - Solid Milk Stout, probably the best year-round release from Duck-Rabbit."
"O/D - Easy drinking, as a milk stout should be. The harsh roasting does start to add a little bit of a edge. ABV is very manageable."
"D/O - Drinkability is very good: Easy to put away, and very satisfying. Overall, a great sweet stout. Not the best looking or feeling, but the taste will win you over easily."
"O: I really enjoyed this beer as it was not overly sweet. Definitely a dessert type beer. Not sure if I could have more than one in a sitting but the one I did have was enjoyable."
"Standard milk stout, and I didn't care for it much. Poured dark brown to black with a small, tan head that dissipated about halfway through. Aroma was sweet and malty, as was the taste, with traces of chocolate and a bit of coffee. Somewhat thin and watery for a stout, despite the decent color, and a bit of a stale and bitter finish. It was kind of difficult to get all the way through this stout...perhaps I just wasn't in the mood, but it didn't make a good impression on me."
"M - Creamy smooth but with some tingle from carbonation."
"Sip, close your eyes, and savor."
"O - Sort of underwhelming. I expect milk stouts to be a lot thicker and more lactic. The components are there but just seem not to be showcased."
"Overall-A stout that boasts a well-balanced, not overwhelming bite. Perfect for year round, if you're into that kind of thing."
"Overall this is a good milk stout. Roasty, smooth, and creamy with good mouthfeel and a nice finish. Would be a good choice to have with some desert. Would be happy to drink this again."
"I received this beer as an extra from Alexfields, thanks for the opportunity. Poured in to a wine glass, Duck Rabbit Milk Stout pours out a black color, with brown hues at the top of the glass, towards the head, which is about an inch thick. The nose is soft, with notes of lactose, milk chocolate, aspirin, and a small hint of coffee bean. Smooth drinking here, the body is like silk, and goes down incredibly easy. Not too thick either, making it a beer you can put two to three back of. This is a style that I rarely buy, but when I do, I am reminded of what I am missing out on. This beer is right next to my other favorite within this style from Left Hand."
"OVERALL: Nothing to get excited over or to write home about, but a decent brew non-the-less. Much better than the porter I just had, which was nice. This brewery claims to be the dark beer specialist and the milk stout has slightly redeemed them after the abomination of a porter, so Iâ€™ll give it one more shot before blowing the whistle. Maybe something imperial next time. This one was decent, but nothing more."
"O - One of the better milk stouts I have had. These tend to be too sweet for me at times and can be rather off-putting. Not this one. Really nice and definitely sessionable."
"Pours black with a nice head. Looks really inviting. Roasted malts and chocolate, along with that slight twinge of lactic sweetness. The taste is fantastic. A punch in the face of the lactic sweetness, roasted malts and chocolate. Quite a bit going on as it carries through, with hints of caramel, vanilla, coffee, cream... Finishes with a really clear, dead on flavor that is really pleasing. Best flavor and complexity of a milk stout I can recall having (assuming we don't count Surly 4). The mouthfeel is pretty creamy for a beer of this size. Overall, I am really impressed. I am always really impressed when beers under 6% can bring the flavor and this is definitely one of them. Pretty floored that I am giving this beer such a high grade."
"O - Very easy initial drinking, it's like a ""dessert"" beer. There are some interesting flavors there. After awhile, the sweetness takes over and it's time to move along, overall a nice introduction to the style."
"Drinkability is good. This is a great milk stout and drinks as such."
"Color is black with some brown around the edges. The tan head is pretty thin and fades quickly, and there is not much lacing down the glass. The scent is really sweet chocolate. The taste is sweet as well, but overpowering - more of a bitter-sweet cocoa, with a bit of coffee. Mouthfeel felt a bit on the thin side to me. I enjoyed this stout more as I emptied the glass and it warmed a bit."
"D - really nice mil stout here. As previously mentioned, not uber complex, but what is there is rich and delicious. This is my introduction to this brewery...can't wait to try some more."
"D- Medium/High. It's very sweet which is typical of the style. Duck Rabbit is one of the best representations of a milk stout I've tried."
"D: This is solid stout, has some nice flavor, a little sweetness in the finish. It's a very easy drink, just about a session beer. Definitely a solid beer overall."
"overall: a little disappointed. Won't be a go to for me when hankerin for a milk stout."
"Overall: I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the beers in North Carolina, and this one did not disappoint. Eager to try the other beers from this brewery. A sweet, but not at all syrupy stout, excellent for your after dinner dessert. When tasting this excellent example of a cream/milk stout, you don't get the sense that the brewer used cheap tricks to obtain the flavors and results. An excellent example of the style."
"D: My favorite milk stout. That about sums it up."
"Good moderate mouth. Light carbonation bite on the back end, but nothing that draws too much away from the creamy feel. Good roasted malts, sweet dairy sugars, light vanilla. This isn't as bold as I would expect coming from a fresh keg, but it's still good. Easy drinking stout. One that I never have a problem with ordering. Good stuff."
"D: This beer is not bad, but not particularly good either. I imagine imperialized, this beer is very nice. As it stands, the beer tastes a little off balance and lacking in some more substantial interweaving of profiles."
"D: nicely drinkable and enjoyable."
"D- A sound and solid milk stout. Not a perfect one, but a decent measuring stick for the style."
"Overall this stout is superb, one of the best I have tasted up to this point. It is very easy to drink and will leave you wanting another."
"Pours almost black with 1 1/2 half fingers of brown foamy head. It smells like coffee, chocolate, and toffee. Great mouth feel for a stout, no sour mucky after taste. The flavor is dark and toasty with a fair amount of sweetness, but not so complex that it's hard to drink. This is great beer that leaves a creaminess on your tongue."
"Light mouthfeel which I would prefer a little thicker, but good carbonation and very easy to drink."
"T. Typical stout. There's a hint of alcohol. Bubbly on the tongue. Nice, even if pedantic."
"At the moment - My #1 Stout"
"Overall, a good easy drinking beer, goes down smooth, and would be good with desert."
"D- Of course, its a milk stout!"
"Overall this is an above average milk stout but nothing exceptional."
"D-not as good as I was expecting from the previous characteristics ..."
"This one is nice and creamy in the mouth. Perfect carbonation and no hint of alcohol. Very tasty, drinkable milk stout from Duck Rabbit. Claiming to be the dark beer specialists this one had to be good they certainly delivered."
"D - Although milk stouts are not my first choice, I didn't find this one undrinkalbe...the lactose flavor is just a little overpowering but the initial roasted flavor was nice"
"Cheers!"
"cheers"
"D - Decent drinkability. Maybe a tad bit too filling for a dessert beer."
"Excellent drinkability I think I have found a milk stout that I actually like. Gonna have to be something spectacular to knock this off the pedestal."
"Drinkability: A great stout and a superior beer overall. This is definitely one of my new favorite stouts. The craftsmanship is definitely evident in the flavors of this beer. I will certainly look for it again and highly recommend it."
"I didn't suffer through this beer, but i think that more than 2 would be a bit much"
"D: Solid all around. Not my favorite style, but there is nothing offensive about this beer. Recommended."
"Easy to drink, I would definitely seek this out again. A good example of the style."
"D: Not something that I'd really care to have again. Mediocre or worse in just about all phases."
"Poured aggressively, 1.5-finger head, reduces to impressive thin film, as well as the awesome lacing, color is black, head is caramel. Aroma of perfectly roasted dark malts, and a touch of chocolate. Taste of the chocolate and dark malts is fantastic, balanced perfectly with lactose. Maybe a touch of smoke. Unbelievably smooth-drinking."
"Very enjoyable; mine served as a nice nightcap."
"At this abv, very drinkable."
"If you've never had this, please do yourself a favor and give this one a try. If you're a stout fan you'll die when you try it. If you're not much of the fan (like me), I still suggest you give it a try--you may love it!"
"Highly drinkable, but a little short on robust flavor."
"I really enjoyed Duck-Rabbit Milk Stout. It is tremendously tasty. The beer was an almost pitch black viscous topped with a thin beige layer of foam. The smell was fairly mild with a little roast coffee and burnt toast, but the taste is where the money is at. It was well bittered with notes of dark rum, milk chocolate, iced coffee, with the perfect amount of sweetness and a full bodied creamy texture. It was delicious, certainly a beer that I would recommend. I drank 4 or 5 bottles of this one night watching football without really realizing because it was so good. One of my favorites."
"Drinkability: I could drink a few of these before wanting something better. Goes down very easy but leaves my tastebuds wanting something more complex, needs more coffee taste to suit me."
"D - All in all, i'm a little disappointed, but it's not bad. It's a creamy stout. I'd rather drink Duck Rabbit's Porter."
"D - Not a bad beer, didn't mind drinking it, and would have it again if offered."
"Smooth feel with a medium body and rather heavy on the carbonation."
"D - This is a pretty good beer. Clean, dry, tasty, but after a couple pints Id probably like to switch it up a little."
"D-Unremarkable."
"D - Something didn't feel balanced. This one didn't taste very smooth and I probably wouldn't have another. Still glad I got to try it. First beer from this brewery."
"(61st)"
"this beer is delicious. simply put. the finish is clean but leaves enough flavor to make you want more. i will gladly trade for more of this beer, definitely seek out!"
"drinkability is not bad....with the low abv and all...and this beer is def not repulsive..."
"Drinkability is pretty good, bold strong flavors, but light delivery, smooth, a little creamy, nice dry finish and overall drier feel, with just a hint of a sticky feel."
"D - All in all I would say its not bad. Quite drinkable but probably would not have more than two in one sitting."
"D- Very easy to drink. Nice balance between bitter coffee and sweet chocolates. Creamy but not thick. Good stout."
"D: The 5.7% ABV and relative lack of lactose flavoring make this an unconventional milk stout for me. I would even consider it to be more bitter than sweet, but at the least, its a nice, roasted, bitter and drinkable stout. Somewhere between a true American and specialty stout, I'd give the Duck-Rabbit another try, maybe on-tap or cask though."
"***I don't typically drink Stouts, but this one puts me right where I need to be. You'd think it would be a little heavier, alcohol-wise. But it ain't a prob; I'm not trying to get wasted while I'm drinking some this good. Spot on, Duck Rabbit."
"Thoroughly enjoyed this beer. The dark color, almost like an untainted cup of freshly brewed coffee, was very appealing. It poured about a two finger wide head that had a toffee-ish hue to it. The aroma was strong with a roasted coffee smell. On first taste it was a blast of flavors. You definitely get the coffee flavor at first, followed by a rich caramel, and ending with a slightly bitter semi-sweet dark chocolate. Throughout the whole experience, the beer had a medium body with decent carbonation to it. I definitely recommend this stout."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass...A dark brown with a light tan head, ok retention but really poor lacing...A light roasted aroma, laced with creamy, can just tell its milky...The taste is also very creamy, but a stale bitter old coffee presents which is really distracting. It was probably meant to balance the sweetness but needs to be brought down by half. Prety boring drinker."
"Poured black into my glass. I get hints of cream when I take a big whiff. Tastes like a stout with more hints of cream, like I can taste the lactose. With the way it's carbonated though I sometimes feel like I'm drinking a soda. The concept of a milk stout is very intriguing though and I feel like ""The-Duck-Rabbit"" has pulled it off very well since I do get hints of a milk like flavor."
"Medium body, a bit creamy. Good carbonation. So easy to drink. Great example of the style."
"Poured into a snifter. Color is very dark brown with a tan head. The nose is chocolate, roast, and a tiny bit of coffee. The taste brings on some roasted malt and chocolate, with the feel bringing on a pretty good dose of lactose. Drinks fairly well, but isn't too interesting."
"D: Damn good sweet stout here. Would be an everyday winter staple were I inside of Duck-Rabbit's extremely limited distribution range."
"D - I like this beer, but it doesn't score well. Tastes pretty good."
"Drinkability: A basic combination of flavors and the style is a bit sweet for me, but overall I found this to be rather enjoyable."
"This beer has a very dark red/brown colour and very good carbonation. The head died of quickly in mine... that was unexpected. The smell is very strong of roasty chocolate and coffee. The initial flavour is strong and tastes of roasted coffee. There is some hop flavour in the middle. The aftertaste is milky with a hint of smokiness. The mouthfeel is disappointing."
"Nose is a nice marriage of roasty and sweet, plentiful dark malts with chocoalte milk and malted milk balls. The flavor scale tips more toward the roasted end of things; plentiful dry dark malts up front and lingering at the finish. Chocolate sweetness is controlled and challenged by a fairly stinging dose of bitterness. Fluffy and fairly thick. Could perhaps could use a touch more sweetness to fit more neatly into the style, but there's no doubt it's tasty. Recommended."
"D - certain all-nighter. Would be good alone or with food."
"Pours black, but under the light is almost ruby. Great sweet and roasted smell. The taste doesn't let down...I can't get enough of this one. I want to call it ""sharp"": each aspect is very pronounced. The roasted malt flavor is very strong, still it has a sweetness. The carbonation hits hard as well. What a great stout. Comes across as a little stronger than 5.7%. I'd probably only be able to rock 2 of these at a time."
"D - Smooth, not bad for a stout"
"D- No. If this ever is opened in front of me again, I will only sip it if I'm promised these awful metal flavors are gone. There is something disgusting about this beer, and I hope it isn't intentional. If I had no taste buds, and relied on feeling alone I'd be happy. Sad for me I actually do."
"A dark beer with a massive head and lacing. A nice nose of roasted malts that is light on chocolate. Nice roasted malts, chocolate, and milk on the palate. High carbonation that takes away from the smoothness of the beer. Overall, a very enjoyable beer that is a bit high on carbonation so some of the flavors are gone before they need to be."
"Cheers.."
"Drinkability: Sometimes I wish i was back in North Carolina, just so i can taste all the offerings from Duck-Rabbit...guess i'll just have to visit more often. This was my first from them and being a milk stout fan, i can see why they've been garnering great reviews. Big ups to this beer and the people behind Duck-Rabbit."
"Poured a black body w/ a horribly slow receeding mountainous head that actually ticked me off a little. A large malt aroma in the nose with roasted malts that give off a little breadiness and there are hints of sweet malt. Taste is more of the same as a good mix of malts hit the tongue as roasted malts dominate but are balanced w/ dark chocolate, caramel a touch of biscuit. All this is in a sticky, medium body with some sweetness before a really dry backbite envelopes my taste buds. A good milk stout but a little less sweet than I prefer."
"Overall: This is the best beer in Duck Rabbit's standard lineup."
"D: Very easy to drink, had this at 10 o'clock in the morning before a football game and could have kept drinking these all day."
"Deep brown color with a creamy cappuccino-foam kind of head that unfortunately doesn't last long. The aroma is mostly light and clean, but it does have a little bit of milk-chocolate, some nuttiness, and a bit of what seems like a clean mineral character. The flavor has much of the same nutty chocolate from the aroma, some milk sweetness, and a (very) subtle undercurrent of earthiness that keeps this one from getting too sweet. A fine carbonation makes the texture quite silky. Overall, this beer is smooth yet flavorful, but I wish it was just a little less sweet."
"A respectable attempt at a very under-appreciated style."
"Overall, I just wasn't a big fan of this one. Bottle was drank before sept, but maybe something was wrong with it. The flavors just didn't match up really well. Not something I want to drink a lot of."
" Aroma of rich roasted malt, mocha, and briny, peaty smokiness. Medium body is slightly chewy. Palate is dominated by roasted malt up front, mellowing into a marginally malty sweetness typical of a milk stout. Decent and sturdy, although something is missing for this to be a great beer."
"D- It's not the most drinkable stout I have had, but I could still put em down. I would like a more full body, but it is still decent."
"Overall this isn't a terribly complex beer but what's done is done very well. An easy-drinking and flavorful example of the style that's worth a shot."
"D - Very nice durability overall. Liked the flavors and moderate ABV. Does really deserve to be a B at least an A worthy beer. Love it."
"Drinkability- Up front flavors are quite nice, but the finish is a bit too roasty bitter and instills regret rather than fond memories."
"Perhaps the best beer of my recent trip to Georgetown, DC. This is a stout beer drinkers dream. Really has a snap to it that makes it better than other microbrew stouts. Plus the price of this beer was quite reasonable even in Georgetown. Only six dollars for a pint! If you've ever been to Georgetown you'll know that this is a deal."
"Drinkability - It's too heavy to have more than one at a time. Make it a starter beer, or one with a meal."
"Poured into a pint glass with a very thin head and minimal lacing. Dark brown almost black. Smells like a creamy cappucino with a hint of licorice. Tastes much better than it looks. Nice mixture of bitter-sweet. A bit heavy with light carbonation. Can't drink more than a few. A bit overpriced in my opinion although I love this brewery overall. If you have the opportunity to buy it per beer, it is worth a try. If only by six pack, there are better milk stouts for the price."
"D: Can't say I'd try this again unless I could get it on tap. My sister loved this beer but I have to say it was just ok."
"A nice stout from a bottle with a very simple label based on a classic optical illusion."
"Great malt flavors off the bat. Poured from the bottle a nice and rich brown. Thick head with excellent retention and a smell that draws you in. My first sip was very creamy with a nice malt character. A very nutty beer with some chocolate notes. After taste is a little bitter but does not take away from the enjoyability of this fine brew. This is one beer I'll be grabbing more of when I get the chance."
"Mouthfeel was very nice as expected. Taste was ok, but nothing great. Roasted grains mixed with a nice choco reminder."
"I've had this beer several times on both tap and bottle. Its actually on of my top five ""go-to"" beers. Tap is better but bottle is still good."
"D - For a stout, this is one of the most drinkable beers I've had. Strong, but forgiving. Flavor changes well throughout the beer, keeps things interesting."
"Great beer. I am curious if it's a little thin due to aging, or if this is how the beer always is, but for a three year old bottle this is fantastic."
"This is a decent beer."
"Bottle from Chip's in Kill Devil Hills, NC. A nearly pitch black pour, hints of reddish brown come through the edge of the glass when held to a light. Minimal, fast tan head. Nose is coffee beans and dark chocolate with a hint of sweet toffee in the back. Beautiful. This beer tastes great - very flavorful while remaining non-abrasive in any aspect. It starts off with a bit of piney flavor but mostly a great grain-founded bitterness that is well met with a smooth texture from the lactose. It finishes with a perfect blend of sweet and roast. This is very well made stout. Buy this beer."
"Missing is any semblance of harshness. There is almost no alcohol taste. It's all very pleasant."
"Flavor is solid, but mouthfeel lacks a little, as it's slightly on the lighter side, and high carbonation. The flavors are milk chocolate, chocolate milk, toasted malts, light-roasted coffee beans...and really no booze at all. Overall, another decent beer in the Duck Rabbit line-up!"
"D- Amazingly well balanced stout between sweet and malt with a good bite that makes you want that next sweet sip. I could drink much more than one of these with no regrets. One of the better milk stouts I have had."
"D: Very drinkable, good amounts of mixing of all the flavors. Very nice considering it's a nice abv."
"Notes: While the sweetness was not cloying, this is still a little sweet for my taste. Good."
"D- really drinkable. The alcohol taste is nonexistent, the flavor is amazing, it smells wonderful...pretty much a perfect milk stout"
"D - This is a winner, great mix of flavors, great mouthfeel, and easy drinking."
"A good milk stout. Not the most robust, but definitely holds its own - pick some up if you see this..."
"This is a very drinkable brew. Very, very good mouthfeel. The brew doesnt look great but it sure does taste and feel like a great brew. Very good brew from The Duck-Rabbit."
"I have had this before with chocolate cake and it was amazing."
"Brown bottle with no indication of freshness. Pours a very dark brown color with a fairly dark tanned head. When held up to the light it is fairly clear around the edges with a lighter brown hue. Not much head retension and minimal lacing on the glass. Nose has a pleasant roasty character of dark malt similar to coffee and chocolate. Taste has flavors in line with what the aroma led on. Very minimal sweetness which is what I like with this style opposed to the overly lactose impregnated messes of sweetness that distracts from the other flavors. Somewhat of a mineral character throughout the flavor along with a touch of hops and a bit of yeast. Medium to light feel with a moderate amount of carb. Overall not bad, the flavor and sweetness of the lactose come out as it warms and also are more noticable in the aftertaste."
"D: Goes down far too easily, very tasty, this is a beer that I would drink all evening."
"I found this brew to be a pretty tasty milk stout from The Duck-Rabbit Craft Brewery."
"This is pretty much the beer that got my friend into craft beer, or else I might say it may not be good for beginners. Overall- a great beer from duck rabbit, I'd highly recommend it"
"I just didn't like this beer a whole lot. It was OK...but was expecting more flavor, and it just didn't deliver. Pours black....not terribly thick. You can smell the spiciness and molasses, but I didn't seem to taste them. maybe it was a bad night for my taste buds...but this beer was just average to me."
"D: Excellent milk stout; I haven't ever tasted a beer with this type of creamy, whole milk-like mouthfeel before."
"This is my second Duck-Rabbit beer. Their Baltic Porter made me pay attention to Porters again and this Milk Stout is one of the most flavorful and complex Milk Stout's I believe exist on the market...at least at the $8 a six-pack price tag on a grocery store shelf. Pay attention to these guys."
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium also. I have been wanting to try this beer for awhile and I'm so glad I got to. The characteristics of the beer are defined very well. It has an overall good flavor."
"D- This beer went down nicely with a chocolate cake."
"Drinkability - Easy drinking, but still somewhat rich."
"This is the best Milk/Sweet Stout I have experienced. In the future I'd really like to get my hands on more Duck-Rabbit beer."
"D - Very good. I can barely put down the glass. I wish I had more."
"Smooth, sweet, toasted grain. Its light but has great flavor. I could drink quite a few of these if I had them."
"Drinkability: Reminds me of a latte I had in Paris. Stouts are not my thing, but I wanted to try this one. I really enjoyed it. A great before dinner beer."
"overall i think its a good beer, but lacks overall flavor."
"Overall, for a beer this sweet the quantity of roasted malt is a bit high for my preference, giving it a little more coffee flavor relative to chocolate flavor. Even still, it is a well-made beer and a very good example of the style."
"D - Well, judging by how smoothly it goes down and how little I have left at the end of the review, I can say this beer is pretty damn drinkable. Delicious flavor and flawless mouthfeel. Nice roasted flavor without the bitterness."
"This beer is so very drinkable- one of my favorite stouts"
"Aroma is chocolate, brown sugar, roasted malts, and, is that, soap??? I would like less carbonation and more creaminess. There is definitely a sweetness to distinguish this from traditional American stouts, but not enough of it, especially in the finish. I had high hopes for my (non-fest) first sample of the ""dark beer specialists."" This one leaves me a little disappointed."
"D) A well crafted brew. The unfermentable sugars are noticeable and make this milk stout quite tasty."
"Not a bad beer, and I'm not sure what I'm looking for to improve, maybe lose the metallic tinge that it has, and it could be quite good."
"The flavor is big coffee and cocoa with the hops showing up towards the beginning of the profile and become thinner later. The milk/crÃ¨me flavor rides the tail end and provides sweetness throughout. The cocoa/ chocolate flavor seems to be on the bitter side, which isn't bad with the milk flavor to balance it. Also a bit of stale black coffee involved. Overall the mouth feel is a little thin of r a stout IMO, but this is a session able and tasty brew, although not exceedingly special."
"Sweetness is a little too high to keep this one from being all too drinkable, though it's quite nice and a couple could go down rather effortlessly. The overall impression is reminiscent of a coffee-tinged milkshake; a nice dessert stout, or even a decent aperitif, but not really a session beer. A nice stylistic representation, though. Very enjoyable, and a great way to finish off St. Patrick's Day."
"this beer was hard to drink at first. i like the sour milk and sweetness in this type of stout, but this one is too cola-like. the carbonation is off the charts. i would still give it another chance. maybe i got a bad bottle. that seems to be the case with some duck rabbit beers."
"D: Smooth and drinkable with solid flavors and a nice mouthfeel."
"Overall, this is a decent beer from a brewery that has never done anything to impress me. It's got a lot of the ingredients right, but there's just something missing. Still, it's not a bad beer by any means and is worth trying."
"D: It was decent. I'm not in love with it. I'd have it again."
"d - I like this milk stout a lot. Very nice cream and roasted malts taste makes this a very smooth and enjoyable beer. High carbonation hurt this a little, but I will definitely have this again."
"Mouthfeel is medium heavy to heavy body, very smooth,and a little sticky. One thing I did notice is the carbonation, very different for a stout. The beer is filling but drinkability is pretty darn good, though."
"Drinkability and mouthfeel: Very tight carbonation which made it harder to drink but gave a very interesting sensation tickling the tongue."
"it poured deep and dark with a nice thick head wick stuck to the glass most of the way. the smell was of deep roasted malt verry strong. the tase was a little sweet but not to bad a little bitter but kind of smooth not to much. very drinkable but also good if you are only having one"
"Been wanting this for a bit, kept seeing it in the magazines but no way it would make it out here, thanks sincereNC. This is my first sweet stout so I have really nothing to compare it to, I guess something like a Mirror Pond, but much sweeter and more complex. Great beer, easy to drink, as it warms it gets more complex. Very drinkable, look forward to the rest."
"D- I could have this as a session beer with ease, not as heavy as most stouts I have had. I left it out for about 10 minutes after I poured it and had it at about 55 degrees, wish I has a six pack."
"D-Really easy drinking beer, although it would have been a great beer had it not been for the carbonation issue."
"D: Very good, as much as I love stouts, I am not a huge fan of milk stouts.. This one however is pretty damn good. Cheers."
"The mouthfeel is fantastic - very smooth and creamy. And this beer is very drinkable - no traces of the alcohol. There is just that weird flavor that I'm not digging."
"I poured this beer out of a bottle into a pint glass. I held it up to the light and the the color was a brown/amber. It had a tan two finger head that went away very quickly. Their is no lacing at all. It smells of malt, carmel, and milk/lactose. It tastes roasted and malty with notes of carmel. There is a small aftertaste of malt, milk, and light hops. It feels smooth and silky in the mouth. In my opinion this beer is average for the stlye."
"Large, two finger plus head of very fine dark tan foam, whipped up appearance with a good deal of dimpling as it dissolves, some lacing. Pure black in color, faint trace of yellow-brown at the outer edges. Well-stuffed nose of milk chocolate, caramel, licorice, the coffee has only a soft roast to it, plum, cherry and a liitle bit of apricot, no overt hoppiness, however, the breadiness has a whole grain, natural roughness to it. In the mouth it's medium-bodied with a wiry, wound-up carbonation which more or less keeps things from spreading too broadly. Dry cocoa powder, malt, caramel and coffee candy, vanilla bean, it offers a breadth of similar flavors without excess sweetness. Not roasty, at times perhaps some nuttiness. The fruit is basic cherry, blackberry, apricot, fig, not too ""dark"" in complexion. Put best thusly, easy to drink but not simple."
"Pour opaque black with a white dissipating head. Black malts dominate nose. Assertive roasted barley with a sweet malt licorice aftertaste. No bitterness on the finish which makes it true to style. Smooth, full bodied and very drinkable. Although this isn't my favorite style, I enjoyed this sample very much."
"EDIT 01/10/10. After sampling various Duck-Rabbit offerings over the past couple of years, there is unfortunately some quality-control issues with this brewery. It's a shame, as when the beers are good, they're really good. I've now seen the Porter, Milk Stout, and Brown Ale all pour 10% liquid, 90% head. They also have a tendency to go sour, Baltic Porter included, although nothing like I saw with the Milk Stout, it went COMPLETELY sour. Fresh is best with DR, and even then there is no guarantee."
"Beer is much more bitter than I expected it to be. The nutty flavor I picked up in the aroma is also present as well as a slight sweetness, probably from the lactose. Drinkability is OK and mouthfeel is a little thin for the purposes of a beer like this. This wasn't my favorite milk stout and wouldn't be a repeat."
"Pretty good milk stout. Nice pour, retains lacing. A little less of the coffee/chocolaty overtones but I actually like this so this is a plus. More of a dark fruit with slight coffee undertones. Not as thick as other milk stouts I've tried. Just a bit of carbonation."
"[Overall] - I was greatly impressed. I did not know much about the brewery or their beers coming in to this one; they did not disappoint. I look forward to more from the ""dark beer specialists'. A very complex milk stout with a high final gravity no doubt."
"The mouthfeel is medium with moderate carbonation. It is fairly smooth and somewhat creamy. This is a very easy drinking milk stout. In my opinion this is a very good example of the style."
"Wonderful stuff - one of the best milk stouts that I've ever had the pleasure of tasting."
"I tried this in Greensboro, NC. Was a good cream stout but nothing exceptional. Not as dark in appearance as it should be. Nothing special in it's smell. But this tasted good and went down nice. It is not a great stout but it is good and is worthy to be drunk again."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is OK, it is a little sweet for me to have too many of these. One is probably enough. A very nice milk stout though if you like milk stouts."
"All in all, this is a great NC brew. Haven't tried too much else from Duck Rabit, but this is a good first impression."
"Deep mahogany body that looks more like a dark brown ale around the edges than a stout. No foam at all on the pour but a faint ring of larger bubbles gradually collects. I can smell a bit of malt sweetness as the beer sits on the table in front of me. Lifting it to my nose I get more of a bourbon and peat note. Alcohol, malt, caramel, vanilla, and smokiness intertwined. The initial sip is a bit edgy with almost a sour note on the finish. Subsequent sips reveal more peat flavor, almost like a wee heavy. The sweetness gradually builds, but the smoke-tinged malt remains. Just enough bitterness to cleanse the palate. Mouthfeel is smooth, but not heavy. Drinkability is ok, but this is more of a nightcap than a session beer in my book. Would drink it again, but not sure it cracks my current 30 or so beer rotation on the ""buy a case"" list."
"Drinkability: Overall, I find it to be a very solid stout -- nice roastiness and slightly bitter flavors; smell is a little ""thin"" and the carbonation is a bit much, but beyond those criticisms, it's a great beer and I would have no problem sipping on another. The ABV is also very do-able."
"Pretty drinkable. A tad bit thin and acidic for me. Much better if served close to room temp."
"Thanks again for the opportunity to have this one but I certainly like other milk stouts better. When compared to say Moloko Plus, I'll take the Moloko hands down."
"D - I really don't know why Milk Stouts aren't more sought after, very flavorful, easy drinking, what more can you want?"
"This is a great looking beer! It has a full dark tan head that is rocky. It has a deep opaque body. There is just the right amount of carbonation to the body. The aroma is a little bit adjunct with some coffee tones. It has a rough dark cocoa bitter taste that is not too roasty. Very smooth to drink it is a full bodied beer but not as heavy as one might think."
"I like it, but not as much as the Left Hand Milk Stout that I actually ordered. (Orderer got confused so I took this keg instead.)"
"Mouthfeel is soft and smooth on a medium body that's not too big but just full enough to carry the full flavors in this beer. Solid carbonation, maybe slightly too high, though. I would definitely come back to this beer as an excellent milk stout example."
"12 ounce bottle, best by December 2009. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both decent. Aroma is mostly sweet. The brew smells like roasted malt, milk chocolate, and some coffee and nuts. The taste is similar to the aroma, the sweetness from the lactose shows up in the beer well. It tastes like milk chocolate, roasted malt, and a bit of coffee and also a smoky flavor. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it seems thin for a stout but it's a bit creamy and coating and has good carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth, easy to drink and it wouldn't be hard to drink quite a few of these in a session. Overall I think it's a good beer, I'd buy it again in the future. Definitely worth a try."
"Overall, a solid offering from Duck-Rabbit. I would love to try some of their other brews, but this was a pretty good introductory brew. Thanks Chris for the chance!"
"I'm not quite sure that the intense burnt roastiness of this worked as well with this style as it does with some of the other beers from these guys, as I like my Milk Stouts a little more creamy and sweet. Not bad at all but I'll stick to some of the other Duck Rabbit offerings out there."
"cant believe ive never reviewed this before...i love all the beers from duck rabbit and this is a staple in my home.."
"Very drinkable, but not something I could sit down with all night. Would make a great 2-3 beer start moving to your usual drink."
"D - Easy to drink and enjoyable. I like this milk stout."
" Mouthfeel is quite good. Nice and creamy and easy to drink. However, i probably won't buy this beer again."
"Opaque, pretty much black with faint mahogany edges. Generous foam off the pour, the fluffy tan cap settled slowly, leaving behind a few clumpy chunks of lace. Sweet, malty aroma with some roast, faint cherry. Same in the flavour. Mild bitterness even from the dark malts. Notes of chocolate and caramel filled out the flavour. Lingering sweetness. Medium bodied with average carbonation, decent texture. A nice, drinkable beer."
"d- good, this is my first milk stout, it didn't really disappoint, just need to get my palate used to the extreme roasted flavors, but it was enjoyable overall, i'd have another."
"This is my first dive into anything from Duck-Rabbit, but I'm going to keep a look out next time I'm in some markets where it's available. Good stuff."
"This is an interesting beer. I'm an IPA guy but I'm becoming a bigger and bigger fan of Duck Rabbit."
"Maybe not a stellar example of the style but it drinks pretty well. Solid."
"Nice beer, just not very complex."
"D - Not very good. Really hope I just got a bad bottle on this one. I've enjoyed the other Duck Rabbit brews I've had. This one let me down."
"D - Decent, but the creaminess hurts this category a bit. This beer is pretty solid overall, but not a standout."
"The drinkability and mouthfeel improved with time as the intensely carbonated head withered away. Perhaps with such a volatile pour, some settling time should be exercised to appreciate the depths of the beer."
"M/D: A little bit watery in texture for a milk stout. The high carbonation that made this so hard to pour disappears as soon as the beer is in the glass. This is a light and easy drinking stout. While not something I would turn to on a cold day, this is a good one to have around if you want a stout in the middle of the summer."
"Drinkability: I am very glad Duck Rabbit has made it to PA. This is a well balanced, smooth, easy to drink brew that I look forward to having again."
"drinkability: great stout and I would recommend it."
"D- This was the perfect topper to a long day working on my truck. The flavor was awesome, a little more in the head/lacing department and this would be even better. Definitely a new main stay in my fridge."
"Not a bad beer by any means. Its a solid offering, but I think Lancaster's Milk Stout is a bit better."
"Pours a very dark brown with a very thin tan head. Flavor is smooth with sweet malted tones and a slight roasted edge on it. A slight tang on there as well that seems almost fruit like. Very smooth. A bit too tangy though at times it seems. Feel is smooth on liquid. Lower carbonation. Nice to drink. Might be a bit too far on the tangy side for some people. But I enjoyed this one. And it's August."
"This is pretty light-bodied & easy to drink. It would be easy to put a few of these away, but I'd predict the sweetness would get a little tiresome. Rather than balance it out with hops & bitterness, the approach seems to be to make it thin enough that it kind of washes itself away. Not a bad beer by any stretch, I enjoyed it."
"Drinkability: nice version of the style that is goes down nicely. This was nice a fresh on tap."
"Definitely could have drank a few more - wish I hadn't bought just one."
"Overall props to The Duck-Rabbit and I look forward to trying some more of their brews."
"However the regular milk stout is much more tasty...smokey nose, not as sweet as the BB style. The beer fuzes nicely with the malts of the stout, and creates a greater drinkability!"
"Taste is roast malt, cocoa, lactic malted milk ball. Finishes with a bit of that malted milk ball and coffee. Strong medium bodied, drinkable stout. This and the Left Hand Milk Stout are kind of the two barometers I would use for Milk Stouts. Others better and others worse, but this is well worth trying."
"Drinkability: Wow, exactly what I wanted right now. A smooth yet flavorful near-session ale that is extremely satisfying. When will distro spread to Ohio?"
"Thanks again Jon... your generosity will not be forgotten."
"This is a good milk stout. Nutty, cholcolately, mild coffee, a fair amount of sweetness from the lactose. Not as rich and creamy as some other milk stouts, but not necessarily in a bad way. Not too complex, but good at what it does. I might pick this as a nice session brew."
"D- mild flavor and thinner body i guess make this an easy drinker. this is an all around nice beer, but not outstanding. and it goes down smooth."
" all seasons milk stout for me."
"**EDIT: Tried this 10/15/10 again with an 11/10 BBD and everything is spot on except there's no acidity that was noted above. Thick and richly delicious and pleasantly bitter."
"D - A very fine milk stout-quite tasty for the style and rich w/ plenty of sweetness. I wouldn't say sessionable really at 5.7% buta quaffable quality is how I would describe it. The stout makes you want to come back for more"
"The numbers in this review not only reflect the beer, but also how the appear to run their bottling, shipping, and distribution."
"Easy to quaff."
"M/D - Medium bodied, a little on the full side compared to alot of milk stouts out there. Carboantion is a touch high. Very easy drinking."
"basically the same, i had this laying around and finally opened it up beside the 2009, the flavor seemed to decrease and it lost alot of the carbonation compared to the 2009. I definitely preferred it fresh"
"Appears almost black with ruby highlights with a minimal tan head forming scant lacing as it dwindles. Aroma has some roasted malts with a creamy lactose mineral character, caramel and toffee edges. Flavor has a creamy milk chocolate with watered down coffee accents and minimal herbal hops. Seems very porterish, but has a super swet sugary note maybe from the addition of lactose? Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied not as heavy or full of girth as some of their other offerings. I went in reverse trying Duck Rabbit beers, I had the Baltic Porter and Barleywine first and and just now I'm trying the Milk Stout. Carbonation was soft and even pretty tame in a matter of fact. Drinkability overall was quality and I will standby their claim of being the dark beer specialist (of the South). Here's to beer in the South I hope WV kicks it up a notch with the alcohol law change."
"This is a surpisingly good stout considering this is not one of the major brewing areas of the country. I believe many of these lesser know brew companies may hold unknown great beers."
"For a milk stout, there may be others with slightly more flavor, a little more alcohol, or a level more of thickness - but when it comes to drinkability, overall, this one is hard to beat."
"D= A very good example of a milk stout here. Very tasty and quite sessionable!"
"Fresh 12oz bottle. Pours dark brown/black with, contrary to a lot of other recent reviews, a billowing tan head that lasts and lasts. Sheet lacing. Aromas of toffee and chocolate milk. Nice dark roasted malt character. Tastes of light milk chocolate with a bit of coffee. Dark and creamy overall. Pretty nice. Creamy body. A sipper for sure, but quite pleasant."
"An easy going but somewhat disappointing milk stout. Could have used a bit more of something, anything."
"A solid beer - good taste, but watery and not very visually appealing."
"Very easy to drink. I enjoyed this one and would definately get more."
"This beer poured a very dark brown with little head. The smell is a bit of coffee and chocolate, although not as much as I expected. The taste started off with some semi-sweet chocolate that gave way to a bit of toasted coffee taste. The mouthfeel was thick and rich with a minimal amount of carbonation. This is a fairly drinkable beer, especially for a stout. I'm glad I grabbed a bottle while I was in North Carolina."
"While nothing earth shattering, I thought this a very nice, uncomplicated, easy to enjoy stout."
"D: Certainly a drinkable Stout. I won't be rushing back to this one when there's Samuel Adam's Cream Stout out there which for me tastes and smells much more inviting."
"D - A bit too sweet to drink a lot of, but overall very delicious!"
"Medium bodied and a bit creamy. The flavor is a little sweet with hints of dark chocolate and a sweet coffee like finish. The flavor lingers but the overall aftertaste is weaker than I expected. However, this isn't necessarily a bad thing. With a great overall flavor this beer is definitely worth having another but could use a few improvements."
"Some smooth coffee notes at the start followed by some milky smoothness. But not as milky as I expected. Smooth, medium bodied. Well balanced."
"D - Very drinkable, a very light stout, but with considerable stout flavor. A little too much carbonation for my taste, but still a phenomenal tasting beer."
"Pours a great black color with awesome tan head and nice lacing. Excellent scent, a great burnt grain/coffee combination with a wonderful sweet lacing from the milk sugars. Awesome taste, a great stout flavor with some nice coffee/cocoa tones and a wonderful sweet milk flavor to smooth it out, with just the tiniest of hop bites to keep it from being unbalanced. A wonderful beer."
"D- Low abv works for me, the taste does not so I won't be going back for this one. Perhaps this was a off batch, either way not a good look in my book."
"Overall, not a bad milk stout, but not great. Definitely worth trying, and I look forward to the other stuff Duck Rabbit has to offer."
"Sadly I find this to be a complete and utter dud. This was very nearly a drainpour. Once again, I am reviewing this knowing that there is something not right with this batch (carbonation for the umpteenth time). However, it's not limited to just a single or even a couple of bottles, but clearly is pretty widespread given other reviews I've read. Unfortunately I'm not going to come back to this beer, at least not in bottles, for some time, until I have some confidence that maybe Duck Rabbit has thoroughly fixed its QC problem."
"This brew has a very dark apperance with crimson hues at the bottom of the glass. Mucho Lace, average head. The main smell is the alchol but also coffe and burntness. Full bodied choco-coffe taste and is somewhat creamy as well. This beer is very smooth and velvety and somewhat creamy, hence the milk. Tingles the back of the mouth. Went down fast and smooth, i could drink this till the sun came up."
"I'm a rookie with stouts and this was a great beer to try outside the ""Guiness"" box. A great one to get if you are in a dark beer kinda mood."
"Tastes more firm and lively than it smells. Smooth coffee up front, moving into an excessively silky middle of chocolate and bittersour grain, ending on a maltodextrinous bitterness of light stout hops."
"Mouthfeel is very smooth and the carbonation levels are low. Easy drinking and delicious."
"D: Exceedingly drinkable with low carbonaiton and a light-than-medium body makes afor a mighty drinkable brew. A good beer but a bit uneven. The lack of head made me wonder about packaging issues, although the flavor was excellent."
"This beer is great. A very well crafted Milk Stout."
"Good, not extraordinary."
"I have a second bottle of this because I bought a few of each Duck Rabbit bottles since we just got them here. If this was a bad bottle, I will re-review. If not, my second will be my last."
"D - Not something I would reach for everyday, but I imagine this one to pair quite well with burgers or steaks right off the grill. Bacon Cheeseburger would be perfect now that I think about it. This is tasty, but not exceptional, and personally, not enough body to satisfy the need for a stout, but makes a great porter."
"this is my first offering from Duck Rabbit and i'll be sure to seek it out if the make it to NJ (fingers crossed)"
"D- a smooth and refreshing beer. A good milk stout. One of the top 3 milk stouts i have ever had. I would def like a sixer of these to relax and watch a game."
"T + M + D: Flavour is very much like the nose, though body is a lot lighter than what I may have expected. Perhaps I was expecting something smoother, and went into it with unreasonable expectations, but it does seem to be lacking as it flows over the palate. The flavour and the aroma are just fine, but it almost begs for a little more size... but that's just me. If it is their most popular offering, I imagine most people think it's just fine. A nice, flavourful beer without a huge alcohol content. Not exactly a sessionable offering, but I could go with a couple on a more relaxed evening."
"Drinkability: I think this is ok for a milk stout. The sweetness I found was more subtle that others. I would have another, but almost would drink it more like a regular stout."
"D - A wonderfully sessionable milkstout... Lack of head was my biggest disappointment, but I was impressed in all other facets... A wonderful introduction to Duck-Rabbit..."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a light but crisp carbonation."
"MF/D: Very clean and refreshing mouthfeel. Not dry at all, smooth going down, medium in body."
"Anyways, if you are in North Carolina you should definitely pick up a 6 pack."
"On the thin bodied side, but not too much so. Everything here works pretty well. Low enough ABV where you could have a few and not be under the table. More than enough flavor to keep you happy and interested."
"Many examples of milk stouts I've sampled in the past tend to be a bit to sugary, a bit too much vanilla, too sweet, more on the lactic side. Duck Rabbits brew incorporates it into a bitter, jahva like brew with a creamy quality. Well balanced, well done. I will purchase this one again."
"Pours brownish black with a gigantic rocky head. Aroma is not unlike a english stout. Aroma is slightly lactic sour milk, some roast. Mouthfeel is medium to light with a nice cream feel with some good unexpected carbonation. Flavors are chocolate, roast and smoke the lactose is a little more subdued than I expected (good thing) and brings a nice balance to the brew. This is a solid milk stout highly drinkable and recommended."
"Taste is full of creamy roasted chocolate, but also has some dark fruit and chalky notes. A well balanced milk stout with a noticeable hop presence. The slight astringency is a minor drawback, but otherwise a complex milk stout with alot of character."
"Pours a dark almost black in color. Smell is smokey and lactic. It has a very distinct burnt note in the smell. Taste is very nice. The lactic/milk notes are well done and taste good. A tad thin on the mouthfeel. A decent beer that you can enjoy without getting slammed by the ABV. Another solid beer from DR. To this date there has been only one beer from them that has not impressed me."
"I dig, but not for everyone."
"Much like the Burger King Rodeo Burger, a letdown."
"D: it is quite drinkable. i would gladly drink this again."
"This beer fits to style for the most part except it's a bit thinner than I would've expected."
"Pours out brown, with darkness concentrated in the middle of everything, or maybe a very, very dark brown with some lighter highlights. By any means, no black. A small 1cm head rises, then disappears very quickly. No lacing to speak of. The smell at first is pure carbonation, but then you catch a bit of sweetness, mixed in with a tiny bit of an estery smell. If you try, you can smell a bit of the roasted malts. The taste is quite like the smell. You get a mouthful of sweetness which is kept in check by esters. There's a tiny taste of chocolate malt and very little presence of roasted barley. I my opinion, the roasted barley would serve as a better balancer than the estery taste, but I've found a few of these beers to be a bit more estery than expected. But this one still tastes nice, there's even a tiny taste of dryness in the finish. The mouthfeel is nice and rich, with decent complexity and nice carbonation even without any head. It's pretty easy to drink, but not an everyday beer. A decent attempt, and it kind of reminds me of a first go at a homebrewed milk stout, with room for improvement."
"Good beer. I was reluctant toi try this one because I hate milk, however this is a good beer. Worth trying and good to try another North Carolina brew. if you see this in stores its worth a try. If you don't like stouts you may still like this one so give it a try."
"Drinkability is good a decent stout not quite as sweet or smooth as some great milk stouts but good no the less and worth a try."
"D: Overall, a nice drinking stout. Enjoyable and had enough things going on with it to keep me interested from beginning to end."
"A nice milk stout rather unique in it flavor component but drinkable .I think it is a good example of a milk stout"
"Even with the odd flavor this is still rather drinkable. It doesn't taste like there is something wrong with the beer, just a weird flavor. Other than that, a decent milk stout."
"This is a relatively light-bodied stout, sweet and deliciously smooth."
"This beer was somewhat of a disappointment. I was hoping that this milk stout would showcase sweet lactose notes and a rich creaminess, but that was not the case. This might be a decent American stout but it definitely does not fit the bill for the style."
"meh. I wasn't quite as impressed as I'd hoped with this one. I love a good milk stout, but this one doesn't quite fit the bill. Aroma is awesome, but taste is just a touch muddled and the mouthfeel doesn't sing. I wouldn't turn one down, but I can't say I'll be attempting to track down any more of this one."
"Smooth, dark malt taste that warms into boring cola. Not as sour/sweet as most milk stouts. Good use of lively carbonation to balance dense body."
"date consumed:	14 Dec 2008"
"D - A nice example of the style. Not as sweet as some others I've tasted, the Duck-Rabbit carries a pleasant balance between the lactose and darker malt components. I typically don't make a session out of stouts but I could drink a few of these."
"D: On the whole, a decent beer that is certainly drinkable, but not spectacular."
"This beer is drinkable, but I won't be seeking it out again."
"Definitely one of the better milk stouts I've had in a long time. It poured a deep, dark mahogany color with white lacing. The smell was absolutely phenomenal - a sugary sweet, milk chocolate aroma, perfect for a milk stout. The taste that followed was smooth and delicious. Not too cloying, but definitely a chocolate malt-ball sweetness. The lactose is definitely present, and a roasted chocolatey note follows. The aftertaste leaves you craving more. A great milk stout and a great session beer."
"D - A very nice milk stout. It has an excellent milk chocolate character and is dry enough to avoid becoming cloying in the way that some other sweet stouts can. This is not a style I am easily impressed by, but this is a very nice beer."
"D - This didn't exactly strike me as a milk stout, but rather it drank more like a coffee stout with plenty of dark roasted malt and bitterness. With that said, it is still quite a good stout."
"Overall, pretty disappointed. Up till now I have been a big fan of milk stouts. I guess I have just been lucky in the ones I have drank so far. I wouldn't go out of my way for this one."
"The brew may be kind of thin, but at least that adds to the drinkability. Pretty good, overall."
"Very average beer that had a funky taste of spoiled milk curds and baby cribs. It tasted like a shot of milk was poured in a glass of coca-cola and then infumigated with breast milk. How do I describe this other than ick? Just an average beer. How it got a 3.8 rating I'll never know."
"Very drinkable, but nothing special. Probably wouldn't seek this one out, but I would enjoy it again given the opportunity."
"Taste is similar to the smell. Very light bodied for a stout. Not very interesting. I wouldn't really go out of my way to try this again."
"D - This brew has a nice flavor and is quite drinkable. It's my first Duck-Rabbit beer, and I'll definitely seek out others. I'll probably pass on this one, though, as it's just a little bit odd tasting for a milk stout."
"Mouthfeel is rich and, well....creamy. This is a beer I could sip all day. Drinkability is good. Abv low enough to make it session beer in my book. Very nice."
"This milk stout has a nice composed feel to it, as the ingredients all blend well and yield a nice smooth beer."
"D - Meh. It's nothing unique but a good brew. I'd like it better if it didn't stick around on the tongue and palate"
"This is a really good beer, but not my favorite stout. Admittedly, Im not crazy about milk stouts, but i know when im drinking a well crafted beer, regardless of style."
"D-This is a good milk stout. Wish I could get it in my area... But I will say this....any time a make a trip to NC, I will be picking up this brew.... and I'd like to try more from this brewery."
"Drinkability: I did not finish it and won't be purchasing this again."
"This beer on cask would be a wonderful thing."
"D: Very good stout. Balance and compexity make it an interesting and easy drink."
"Ran across this in Hendersonville, NC while visiting a friend and picked up a six pack. Must say I was overjoyed with the results and drank the entire thing in one sitting. Hangovers aside, I keep coming back for more. Bold and chocolate-y, pours with a huge head, creating brotherly warm feeling! A classic for lovers of the dark stuff. Must say, though that it tastes a little sour on draft (although I've only had this once). And.. oddly enough I'm finding myself switching to the Duck Rabbit Porter, as it seems to be more drinkable (less sour?) in the long run. Still, the Milk Stout is a classic and highly recommended."
"Tasty stout from Duck Rabbit, ""the dark beer specialists"". Drinks easy, tastes great, an enjoyable experience."
"it pour dark and black as it should with a large golden color head that quickly depletes. There are many smells including coffee and molasses. the flavor a sweet start and mellows out to milky goodness. it has a good mouthfeel but it almost feels like there is something miss or something im missing"
"D: I think carbonation would really make the drinkability go up a bit. I have had much more drinkable examples in the style."
"Pour a pitch black body with a tall tan head. The aroma and flavor show less lactose than you'd expect from a milk/sweet stout. So this beer comes off with big roasted and burnt malts accompanied by the candyvand frosting-like sweetness of the lactose. This is a good milk/sweet stout to try if you think Mackeson's is too sweet. On the other hand, I think the lactose masks too much of the malt without providing more flavor."
"Thanks to unionturf for the opportunity to try this one. 12oz. bottle served in a standard pint glass. Best by 08/08 notched on the label. Poured the color of cola (opaque and almost black), with a four inch tan-colored head the sizzled and popped as it slowly collapsed. Head eventually settled into a solid cap with copious bands of lacing left behind as the brew was consumed. Nose is very subdued; a roasted character and baker's chocolate, as well as a tangy fruitiness in the back. Taste consistent with nose with more tangy dark fruit at the finish; lacks the lactose quality characteristic of the style. Mouthfeel is not really consistent with the style. A little too light in texture and too much effervescence. Good drinkability, but characteristics across the board are not consistent with a milk stout."
"This is well balanced and very sessionable. Thans to unionturf for the sample."
"...you know what I mean...?"
"coffiee, mollassas, and a burnt malt flavor, this one is great, every time i go to north carolina i pick up a few 6ers to take home, nice and dark, a tuch thick and a all around sweet milk stout. this is a good beer for the fall season but it is fall like temps hear in new your today so i figured i would break one out, good choise"
"Pours a deep amber black with a small beige head. Aroma is medium sweet chocolate, coffee and a touch of almond. Flavor is sweet milk chocolate, roasted malt and chocolate covered cherries. Medium to large body, creamy texture. Finishes dry and chocolate sweet."
"This was stored pretty well so I don't believe there can be too much of a problem with it due to poor storage conditions."
"Drinkability: Good, another winner from Duck Rabbit, fast becoming one of the better breweries in the south. A style that I'm not a huge fan of, so it should perhaps rate even higher than this, but still."
"Some serious carbonation going on here, I can feel my teeth beginning to ache already. Even a gentle swirl brings some serious snap-crackle-pop out of the Surly pint glass."
"I wish Duck Rabbit distributed to New Jersey...I love the."
"D- This beer is smooth and rich yet simple which makes a nice session beer. Very easy to drink."
"D: Ok, I could go on all day but would gain 15 lbs. if I keep downing these. Don't get me wrong, I could do it with this delicious brew."
"drinkability - Very nice beer, another hit from Duck Rabbit."
"Thanks to Everetends for the bottle"
"Pours dark brown out of the bottle that looks almost completely black in the glass. The head is fairly thick and dissipates slowly to a ring with a little lacing. The smell is big on sweet roasted malts with just a hint of oatmeal in the background. There is also a significant milk chocolate aroma as well. The taste mirrors the smell with milk chocolate and roasted malts dominating the taste. It's like liquid malted milk balls and in a good way. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with good carbonation and very creamy overall. I really enjoyed this stout and it's one of the better sweet stouts I've had recently. Highly recommended!"
"Pours a slightly hazy dark brown color with a nice foamy light tan head that fades fairly quickly. Spotty patterns of Belgian lacing left behind. The smell is nice. First a rich roasted malt a little chocolate and i can imagine over cooked milk. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is medium bodied smooth and creamy. There is a substantial roasted grainy expresso after-texture. Full flavored, the roasted taste of coffee dominates but you can again imagine burnt milk because it has a sweetness to it. Its not all coffee. A real nice drinker; i'm usually put off by a super roasted character ...this one is all bark. The 5.7% ABV makes this one quite sessionable."
"Light stout feel and easy to drink. Not quite the milk stout like mackeson's, but more coffee."
"D-This is a pretty good stout. I would like to try more from this brewery."
"D - I certainly wouldn't have more than one of these. It's good, but it's also a little strange and the sourness is not something I was expecting, nor something I think is appropriate with licorice or whatever it is I'm tasting. Something about this brew was just a little too weird for me to completely enjoy."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a good beer to drink for a while if you're in the mood for the style."
"Pours a cloudy dark brown, some red highlights in the edges, thick 2 finger mocha head forms, quickly drops leaving some spots of lace, thin ring. Smell is very nice, chocolate roast, coffee, caramel, some licorice, cream, light sour note, nice rich fudgy aroma. Taste is toffee and chocolate, vanilla, roasty middle, touch of licorice, oats, chocolate milk, lactic sour note near the finish with it, very smooth flavour. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with low carbonation, goes down insanely smooth. Very nice stout, I could drink this stuff all day. Thanks Dan!"
"A highly quaffable sweet stout."
"Thanks to shivtim for this bottle. Pours a dark brown to black with a reddish hue. Puffy off-white head falls off fast. Smells sweet and malty with some chocolate for good measure. Deep, almost fruity chocolate flavor. Quite sweet, but not too sweet. Some roasted malt flavor as well. Tastes better as it warms. Pretty full bodied. Nice. Not quite as good as some other milk stouts, but well made nonetheless."
"Opaque, pretty much black with faint mahogany edges. Generous foam off the pour, the fluffy tan cap settled slowly, leaving behind a few clumpy chunks of lace. Sweet, malty aroma with some roast, faint cherry. Same in the flavour. Mild bitterness even from the dark malts. Notes of chocolate and caramel filled out the flavour. Lingering sweetness. Medium bodied with average carbonation, decent texture. A nice, drinkable beer."
"Drinkability: One was enough."
"I don't know alot of other milk stout examples, but this is nice. Since it isn't too full, more of a medium to light bodied beer, you could drink a few of these in a session since there's plenty of flavorful and the ABV isn't fatal. I would recommend this to others to try and look forward to having another if I get the chance."
"TASTE: When cold the stout has a smooth taste and you can really enjoy the flavor. But once it gets warm it loses some smoothness. It would be great for a Black & Tan."
"Smooth and milky in the mouth with a fine carbonation that keeps the beer light and drinkable."
"I had this on tap at Tyler's Tap Room in Durham. The beer was dark brown, opaque in the center with faint red highlights at the edges, and a thin but creamy tan foam. The aroma was great, some coffee and roasted malts along with a nice chocolate component. The taste is also nice, hitting the flavors described above and adding an almost sugary (but not cloying) sweetness. The mouthfeel was full and coating, and drinkability was no problem. The exceptional flavors made this my favorite beer of the night."
"Pours an opaque, very dark brown, almost black. Aroma is rich, smoky and coffee-ish with a hint of chocolate. Flavor is well-rounded, smoky, with strong coffee and unsweetened chocolate components. I recommend this very drinkable stout to all fans of dark beers."
"Pours near black, a big tan head comes up and stays for the majority of the session, ending in a thin ring before the last couple sips. Smell is rich and bold for a smaller beer such as this. Creamy chocolate, dark bitter chocolate under it. A little roast. Also this smell that I notice in all of DR's dark beers...it's like brewer's licorice or something. Very apparent in the Rabid Duck and even in the Baltic Porter. It's here too. Taste is great. It's pretty sweet up front. Lots of chocolate and cream. Dark chocolate comes in again. Some dark fruits also add depth. An excellent hop presence enters in the finish, making it creamy yet slightly dry at times. Quite the drinkable brew for the style. I don't come across many that I could enjoy multiple pints of when it comes to a Sweet Stout but this is surely one of the few. Great stuff, highly recommended."
"On the lighter side of medium bodied, slightly creamy, and silky smooth. Awesome drinkability - enough complexity and flavor to keep you wanting more, but not too big of a beer to weigh you down. A top Milk Stout in my book."
"This is a solid brown color with thin light brown head and good lace. It brings on a deep raisin and oak aroma with also some brown bread and brown sugar. The flavor is tart and grapelike with some molasses and a touch of charcoal. It's drinkable but a bit sharp. Medium bodied. A good quality stout."
"D: I can drink this. I am a big fan of stouts. The taste is amazing to make up for the smell I got off this beer. I might have just opened an off bottle. Will drink again."
"D : An excellent milk stout that I could drink more of."
"Pours opaquely black with a rocky light brown head. Nice dark roasty character with some residual sweetness coming through. Some light grassiness and caramel notes. The hops seem to cut any richness or overly sweet sensation that milk stouts tend to have. Mouthfeel is rich, yet amply carbonated. I'd certainly try this one again."
"D: Easily drinkable. I could easily have a few of these before having my fill. Lower ABV also helps a lot."
"This is my favorite from Duck Rabbit so far, and my favorite Milk Stout, albeit I havent had tons. Get this one if you can."
"Taste is creamy and smooth, strong chocolate taste, mild bitterness and mild coffee-ish presence."
"Thanks wcudwight, I really enjoyed this one."
"Very drinkable, and something I plan on picking up again."
"Overall, pretty drinkable. Everything I've had from Duck-Rabbit has been solid."
"Full and creamy mouthfeel, as to be expected, a bit tannic. A sipper, very drinkable. Thanks to MuenchenerKindl for passing this one on."
"This poured a dark brown with very little tan head. It smelled like spoiled milk and licorice, with a hint of chocolate and berries. (There's a chance this was skunked, but I think this is just the nature of a milk stout versus a standard stout.) My first impression was that it tasted like ragweed. It had a little bit of chocolate flavor, no coffee, and some slight hops in the aftertaste. It had good carbonation, but it was still watery and thin for a stout. Overall this was a strange tasting beer, and a unique stout."
"D - easy drinking, good tasting brew."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a very smooth light body. The carbonation is low but appropriate. This was a very satisfying milk stout and almost exactly what I was hoping for. Nicely played Duck Rabbit."
"I'm not the biggest fan of this style but I feel like this represents a milk stout well. I really want to like Duck Rabbit but I have yet to find one of their beers I am more than lukewarm toward."
"Pours a dark black but is dark ruby red when held up to the light. There is a thick 1"" mocha head that sticks around and leaves some heavy lacing. Smells of malt with sweet chocolate and cream. Taste is sweet chocolate milk with a slight bitterness. It seems a little too sweet for me. There needs to be more balance with some smoke flavors to make it better. The mouthfeel is creamy and it slides down easily. Overall I could drink a few more in one sitting. Not bad for a Milk Stout but a little too sweet"
"Thanks to DrBayern for this one - Deep dark brown/black pour with a big lasting puffy tan head on it. Sweet, creamy milky roasted malt smell to it. Almost milk chocolate like. Taste was roasty, less sweet than expected, with a nice light roasty bitterness to it. A bit more carbonated than ideal in my bottle, especially for a stout, but I see the last couple raters didn't have the same experience. I'd prefer a touch less carbonation and a tad more sweetness, however it is still a fine milk stout and one worth trying."
"D: Enjoyable brew but not something that I would want to have a lot of."
"This is a unique and satisfying beer. It had a deep ruby/black body with a small white head that dissapated quickly but left a good deal of lacing. It smelled of rich roasted malt, coffee, and a hint of vanilla ice cream. The taste was excellent, a very rich and decadent mix of malt and the yogurt like sour-sweetness from the lactose. Very well made."
"Beautiful color on this beer nearly opaque black to my eyes. Beautiful head--if thin--that drops out quickly. Flavor and smell were lux: what I'm looking for in a milk stout: Coffee, chocolate, and a touch of sweetness. I could drink this one all night!"
"Overall I thought this is a very good milk stout. This is the first Duck-Rabbit product I have sampled and so far I'm impressed. There is a complexity of malty goodness that makes you want to keep coming back for more."
"Pours dark brown with reddish hints. Thin head. Aroma is roasted malt, sweet, with a touch of smoke. Pleasing expresso, roasted malt flavor. A touch of lactose tartness balances the flavor. Thick mouthfeel. One of the better Milk / Sweet stouts from a brewery that does dark beer well."
"Recommended. A solid, tasty stout."
"Note: I have also had this on tap and remember it as slightly better than the bottle offering. If you find it on tap, order it!"
"Overall a tasty and relatively complex milk stout."
"Highly recommended if you can get your hands on it."
"This full dark brown beer is great for any one who likes genies. It pours correct.. it will have a nice foam head, with a hint of chocolate and roasted flavor. The smooth taste, aroma and filling ness has allowed me to buy this beer again again. Availalbe in bottles and but tastes better out of the tap."
"I did not like previous Milk Stouts IÂ’ve had, but Duck-Rabbit did the style proud with this one."
"Enjoyable brew with a shocking visual effect."
"D: This is an easy-drinking milk stout, pretty tasty and enjoyable."
"Overall a very drinkable beer, goo, but not great IMO."
"Thanks to my boy Kevin (hurleymanvw) for giving me this one to try."
"This beer totally blew me away. Others have described the colors, aromas and other particulars, so I'll just say that it's one of the most drinkable milk stouts I've ever tasted. Not as thick and not as sweet as others I've had, it's the kind of stout that you can just enjoy drinking without feeling bloated after the first couple of bottles."
"Poured aggressively into my Sam Adams glass. Came up with a small off white head that dissappeared quickly. Very minimal lacing. Really not as black as I'd thought it should be, dark with ruby highlights. I've seen brown ales darker than this one. Smell is of smokey roasty chocolate, and maybe a little candy in there too. Taste is roasted barley and a bit of chocolate and that milk sugar taste that I have yet to figure out how to describe. Taste is roasty and sweet. The body is medium high and the mouthfeel a little sticky. Overall a decent brew. A little light in color for the style, but highly quaffable just the same."
"My second duck-rabbit, the second good one. I am impressed with the brewery so far."
"Call me crazy, but a stout should be pretty dark. This one isn't dark enough. It has a moderately dark mahogany colored body that shines deep red when held to the light. The head was initially very big but fell really quickly. The aroma reminds me of barbecue. There is a big smokey presence in there along with dark roasted malts and some chocolate. Again, this aroma isn't quite what I expect for the style. Roast is up front and dominating in this beer. There is a bit of smoke in there and this still reminds me of barbecue a bit. The lactose sweetness that essentially defines the style is also definitely there; in fact it is a bit too sweet for me. The body is the only thing that is dead on; decently heavy but not too much. This is not a beer that I will seek out again mostly because it is too sweet with not nearly enough balance."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark black color with a huge light tan head from the high carbonation. The aroma features dark roasted malts and sweet chocolate. The taste is dark and roasty up front with a bittersweet finish of chocolate and coffee. The heavy carbonation detracts from the beer, but it is still highly enjoyable. Overall, this is a pretty good brew that is recommended."
"Into a pint glass, pours a fairly opaque black, slightly ruby hued, with a good tan head to start with, fading to a nice film, not much lacing though. The aroma is a little timid, but nice notes of lactose, chocolate and a hint of coffee perhaps. In taste, there is even more coffee, the lactose quite nice in counterpoint, again chocolate is nice, but this coffee and lactose battling it out is kind of weird, kind of good. The mouth is fairly smooth and creamy, not perfectly but good enough, the body medium full and the carbonation rightfully restrained. Quite a nice beer."
"Taste and mouth feel wasn't doing much for me until I pushed it away and let it warm. The beer really began to shine. Very good feel and a complex taste. Good interpretation of the style."
"Pours dark brown with some amber color when held up to the light. Foams up with a tan head and that is sustained by a vigorous level of carbonation. Very cola like in appearance. Smell of sweet malts and some sweet chocolate. Some whiskey alcohol notes show themselves also. Taste is sweet up front and this followed by a nice smokeyness. Mouthfeel is a little thin and overcarbonated. Finishes with a little bitterness. Overall not a bad brew. I think top to bottom though the duck rabbit brews have been somewhat of a dissapointment. They are all better than average but none of them have really shined. They seam to have a fairly consistant problem with overcarbonation that detracts from most of the ones I've tried."
"Pours a deep amber to black color with a tan head. Aromas of lactose sweetness. In the taste, sweet maltiness, smokey, and a small bitterness. Sweet with a small bitter mouthfeel, and a sticky sweet and small dryness in the aftertaste. A nice sweetness with a small bitter and easy to drink. Not too heavy either."
"i could drink one or two of these in a sitting and then im afraid they would be too sweet. so for me, not a great session beer, but definitely a good dessert beer. i would keep them around all the time if they were something i could get locally."
"For a milk stout I can really see myself drinking this for an entire night."
" A nice sweetness keeps tame the robustness of the coffee and bite. Some dark fruits are at work here, too. Black plum, prune and raisin. This leaves the aftertaste a bit fruity, dry and remenants of sweetness. Just enough to leave you wanting more. An easy drink for a milk stout"
"Overall, it's a good beer. I just wish I weren't allergic to it."
"It's pretty good. I'd buy this one again, or maybe order a pint at the bar."
"I bought this beer in a mixed six pack from Total Wine. Pours very dark with a tan head that went away slowly. The nose was chocolate and coffee with malts. Has a nice sweet taste at first that fades to a bitter ending. Is smooth and really good. A very nice beer!"
"Drinkability- This is a fantastic brew. It really really reminds me of Deschutes Black Butte Porter with a touch more sweetness. ItÂ’s a shame that we canÂ’t get any Duck-Rabbit brews out west. They claim to be the Â“Dark Beer SpecialistsÂ” and as far as I can tell theyÂ’re doing a hell of a job. Thanks again to ncvbc!"
"Drinkability - very tasty. Very sessionable for the style though its chances improve toward the colder months of the year."
"Thanks to LRM for the trade."
"Drinkability/Notes: DR's Milk Stout is very drinkable. Plenty of chocolatey goodness followed by a nice coffee like bitterness in the finish. Very easy to drink and super smooth in the mouth. The lactose lends a very nice sweetness to the beer but not in a cloying way. A really nice stout. Too bad its not available in DC. Definitely one I will buy again on my next trip to NC. Recommended. Seek and Enjoy."
"Pours an opaque black with a frothy tan head that retains and laces. Carbonation bubbles visible all around the sides. Smells mild in every way but I pick out roasted malt, chocolate and caramel. Tastes of roasted coffee beans, bakers chocolate, slight vanilla and a bitter hop bite. To be honest, a little weaker and less sweet than I though it would be but still good. Feels creamy in the mouth with a tickle on the tongue from carbonation. Great drinkability. My first drink from the duckrabbit well and a tasty brew that didnt dissapoint."
"D: I really can't come up with one bad thing to say about this beer, excellent any way you look at it in my book. I think this is my first ever 5 beer. Thanks to limesmut for this excellent beer!! Might have to trade with you again for more of this stuff."
"Creamy,slightly grainy edge,some smoothness not as smooth as most of the milk stouts i've tasted. Great mouthwatering taste making me crave more, lots of drinkability,a little more body than other mils stouts i've tried. Very nice beer. Like the label states ""the dark beer specialists"" Had a few of the darks beers from Duck Rabbit all were excellent beer. wish I could get these beers in my area. Give these beers a trt if you can enjoyed them all so far."
"D: I'm a sucker for that heavy, roasted malt arrangement when done properly, and Duck-Rabbit seems to have hit the nail on the head for the style."
"Bottle courtesy of Secret Santa: Poured a medium black color stout with a nice foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of roasted malt with some dark chocolate notes. Taste is a mix between slightly bitter roasted malt with some dark chocolate. Body is tad too light for the style but creamy texture was well enjoyed. Very well done overall and something I wouldnÂ’t mind having again."
"Very drinkable brew and would make a nice session brew. One of hte nicer offerings I've tried from Duck-Rabbit."
"Very creamy and smooth mouthfeel. Sticky on the palate. Full bodied and very delightfully silky. Minimal alcohol with nice mouthfeel makes this entirely drinkable. As long as the beer is pourable, this could become a mainstay for the stout category in anybody's fridge. For now, I will leave it out but will certainly revisist this, probably in the winter."
"A very fine milk stout indeed. Very dry finish with some hop bitterness. Mid palate is rich and roasty with layers of lactose following through to the finish. Plum and anise with caramel drops and chocolate coffee flavors round things out. Mouth is medium, solid and dry. At 5.7 abv a brew I could drink many of especially on an upcoming college football Saturday. Unfortunately I don't have access to Duck Rabbit brews:("
"Drinkability/notes: An unwaveringly superb example, simply excellent."
"I'm a big fan of the bigger Duck Rabbit offerings, and I also like milk stouts. This is nmy favorite of the lower abv Duck Rabbits, and while it is merely a good rather than a great example of a milk stout, I still like it on ocassion. It pours a dark brown almost black with a decent head that fades and good lacing. The nose is milky and sweet with just a touch of sour grain. The taste is equally as milky and sweet with definite chocolate notes blended well with the milkiness. The mouthfeel is milky and just a little sticky. This version is almost a dessert rather than a beer, which hurts its drinkability. I can't imagine wanting more than one of these at a time."
"Black in the center, brown at the edges and possessing a perfect light tan head that starts out two inches thick and drops to about half that in a minute or two. It smells slightly like milk chocolate (not chocolate milk). The taste has milk chocolate flavors with some hop bitterness that made my mouth pucker slightly. For beers under 6% Abv, Duck Rabbit beers certainly pack a lot of flavor. Much like all Duck Rabbit beers, this was a very tasty ale. I think I have only had one of their beers that I didnÂ’t think was great (barleywine that was a drain pour)."
"M: creamy with roasted dry finish, nice carbonation"
"Poured from a 12oz bottle, very dark brown with virtually no light showing through. Head is minimal when poured properly, short lived with little lacing. Smell is a little fruity with licorice. Flavors of roasted malt, oak, cofee. Alcohol comes through in waves and noticeable for a fairly low ABV. Mouthfeel is oily, foamy with a tannic sensation on the tongue. Overall, this is a great brew, highly drinkable and another fine example of a North Carolina beer."
"Pours a dark brown, basically black with a huge fluffy three finger tan colored head that takes a while to die down. Lacing is pretty good, but doesn't hold to the glass as much as I thought it would. Smell has a nice roasted nut character up from with a sweet caramel malt that tickles the nose as well. Taste is very similar to the smell, but chocolate appears on the tongue midway. Aftertaste has a very coffee like tingle. Medium body with a bit too much carbonation for this style. Couldn't have more than one in a sitting, but still a beer worth trying."
"D - A great easy drinking beer."
"Pours a dark brown color, some carbonation, huge two finger plus foamy tannish head, lots of sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is malty, with lots of caramel. The taste is malty, slightly sweet/bitter, lot's of toffee/caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, not a bad milk stout, but would have like a fresher bottle."
"Notes: Thanks to mikesgroove for the 12 oz sample via No Name BIF."
"Pours a deep dark brown with a lot of foam, even when poured conservatively. Smells of coffee and dark chocolate. Taste is much like the aroma only a bit on the sweet side as would be expected in this style. Mouthfeel is luxorius. This is not a session brew but a great brew to end the day with. Yet another great beer from Duck-Rabbit."
"D - Overall this was very good and I would score another one for the guys over a duck rabbit. They really seem to know wheat they are doing, and keep scoring round after round with their brews. Great sessionable beer!"
"This is from a bottle aquired through a beer of the month club over a year ago. It didn't get into the fridge until some months ago. I think it suffered a bit as there's a bit of a tang to it that I didn't notice when I first drank it after it arrived. Did pour with a nice foamy, textured, frothy head. Lots of lace. Light roasty, malty, sweet nose. Mouth filling body."
"Served a nice deep black with a frothy cappuccino head that slowly diminished but left some lacing on the glass. The aroma was strong and was dominated by roasted barley. The taste had the typical stout flavors but was also had a nice sweetness to it from the lactose sugar. This also gave it a rich smoothness and made it very easy to drink. Another great offering by a great local brewery."
"I recommend trying this one with some strawberries...trust me."
"D: While I enjoyed this beer for the most part, and it's relatively reasonable ABV make it a beer that's easy enough to put back a few, I didn't find myself going ga-ga over this one. Probably wouldn't seek this out too often."
"Taste is definately a highlight of this beer. At first sip I'm thinking ""Soy sauce"" with sweet caramel notes, but the salty profile degrades after the beer warms and I'm left with nice a nice malty chocolate/coffee taste. Mouthfeel is smooth, but almost unpleasantly so. Little aftertaste and the malts do little to further the cause. I'd have this again; it's definately worth the buy, but I cannot see myself buying a six pack of DR Milk Stout."
"Just on the pour alone, I not only got a big, thick deep-tan/light-brown head, but the nose was prevalent and attention-getting. I caught notes of cocoa chocolate and a light smokiness and that was without even leaning in. In doing so, I also captured toffee and coffee. Perfect for mid-morning on a snow day! The color was a deep, dark brown with garnet highlights. The mouthfeel was medium to thick and I got a lot of the chocolate and toffee mix on the tongue, which reminded me of a Heath bar. The finish had more of a smoky, coffee richness. It is hard to believe that this is a milk stout, more like a dry stout, but still very good."
"Drinkability: Better than I expected. Not as sweet as I expected, but for me that was a good thing because I shy away from the overt sweetness of some styles."
"D: A very nice brew indeed. I could have several of these, especially paired with bbq wings. A keeper."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into my pint glass. Appears an almost opaque dark brown with an inch of caramel colored foam that lingers on. Smells of roasted malts, and vanilla. Tastes of roasted coffee and bittersweet cocoa. Creamy in the mouth with medium body that leans a little toward the thin side. A very nice stout and one I could see becoming a favorite part of my rotation as supply dictates. Cheers!"
"D - Wonderful selection...made for a great after-dinner beer. Thank you very much, Brouche!"
"Thanks to oldirtysurfer for sending this bottle my way. Poured into a nonic, this is stout is lighter in color than others of its variety, dark cola-brown with russet highlights and a modest but dense sand-colored head. Sourish black malt aromas mix with a slight essence of vanilla along with a soft cocoa scent all with a bit of mineral twang swirling through it. Some rather faint cocoa powder comes through in the taste, with a bit of vanilla yogurt sourness. Otherwise this is fairly roasty and dry, almost like a porter. In fact, I had to check the label on the bottle to make sure I was reviewing the correct Duck-Rabbit beer, as I also have a couple newly-acquired bottles of their porter. That said, this is a fine-tasting brew, that feels full in the mouth with a tiny bit of sharp carbonation bite at the finish, leaving an overall impression of dryness on the palate. Very sessionable, but perhaps not exactly what fans of the sweeter lactose-heavy versions of this style may be looking for."
"Milk stouts have always been a favorite of mine, and this one does the style proud. An excellent brew."
"12oz. bottle pours a very dark brown with a small head that leaves some lacing around the glass. Smells of malts and coffee. Taste of dark roasted malt with some coffee and cream notes. Mouth feel could be a little thicker but is still good with a light/medium feel. Drinkability is very easy with the robust flavors and light body. I could see this being a regular session brew for myself. Another very good beer from Duck-Rabbit."
"And , of course, a hip hip hooray to blackie for this!"
"Overall impression: Very nice - one of the best American milk stouts I have tried."
"Thanks again Mikesgroove, this was a good bottle of beer!"
"D - a tasty treat. had two and called it a satisfied evening."
"D: I really liked this a lot. Nice balance and flavors that are robust and likable. My wife tried and found this to be too bitter for her tastes - she wanted more of the sweet maltiness. However, this is probably the best of the milk stouts I've had."
"Mouthfeel was light medium. With a little more of a couple of things, this one could be world class. Very drinkable."
"A good + solid, tasty milk stout."
"Thanks oldirtysurfer for this beer."
"Full of malt flavor with enough balance to keep the defense honest (sorry, it's college football season). Coffee dominated with a smooth, sweet finish. Dry and slightly sour, almost in the oatmeal stout tradition but without the thick, meaty, cereal character of an OS. Mouthfeel could stand to thicken up but still an enjoyable stout worth trying. Ducks' beaks don't look like that, it's got to be a rabbit..."
"This is a very drinkable milk stout that doesn't weigh down its smoothness and yet provides enough body and substance to please the stout enthusiast. The sweetness that is found in the nose is present but not overbearing in the taste. I much preferred this take on the style to a Mackeson's which is just too sweet for me. I enjoyed this so much I had a couple, and did not get too full even though I drank them soon after a meal. I have been generally impressed with the beers from this brewery."
"The taste has a small bit of alcohol in the beginning. The bitter coffee flavor is very distinctive after warming. There is a definite sweet tasting maltiness mixed in. The mouthfeel is medium to heavy bodied. As it warms, the alcohol flavor dies down and the flavor and mouthfeel smooth out. A very good stout!"
"This is my introduction to Duck Rabbit and its been a good one. A nice roasty sweet stout...very satisfying."
"Drinkability - This is one of the few milk stouts I've sampled, so my impressions of the type is limited to a XXX Makison stout, etc. type. Very willing to continue to sample from this group as the winter months approach. The metallic/iron twang is interesting and I hope doesn't appear in my second bottle/pack. I'm leaving this as part of my review, unless I taste otherwise on subsequent bottles."
"D: Very drinkable, a veritable gem from Duck-Rabbit."
"Very easy to drink, one of THE best milks stouts I've had!"
"Not bad. Poured nearly black with some sand coloured foam on top that hung around for several minutes. Nice. Moderate lacing, which looked nice, as well. Lots of chocolate and roasted malts (of course), but there was a metallic smell present here that was fairly detectable. Enough for me to give smell a 3.0. A bit of milk chocolate in the taste, but a bitter chocolate taste dominated. Finished medium dry with no hops detectable anywhere. This is certainly unbalanced to the side of malt. Good. Mouthfeel was a bit thinner than I feel a beer of this style should be. There was also a bit more carbonation than I would care for. Overall, you could do much, much worse, but this is simply a good beer. Not great or fantastic, just good."
"A dark brown/black beer with some ruby highlights. Has a small creamy beige head and a little lace. The aroma starts with a good dose of roasted malt with a smooth chocolate backgroun and a hint of coffee. Nice smooth mouthfeel to match the chocolaty start to the taste. Has a nice esspresso note near the end and a light sweetness on the finish."
"This one is fairly drinkable, but the richness may be a bit much to handle."
"Another solid offering from Duck-Rabbit."
"Great dark-brown color. Very minimal smell. Taste is very enjoyable, strong coffee, almond, and charcoal overtones. A heavy beer especially perfect for wintertime. Best enjoyed alone as opposed to with a meal. Definetely reccomended for a try for fans of darker beers."
"The taste is good. Very dark malts, coffee, mild hops and molasses mostly. Again, quite comparable to the Triple X, but a lot less sweet (and some would argue therefore more drinkable.) It's smooth and creamy, thanks to the lactose. Maintains a great balance of bitter and sweet, and while not quite as complex as... you know what, it still manages to hold its own. I dig the fact that it's brewed more or less locally. The brewer, Paul, is a great guy and I look forward to trying more of his beer."
"Interesting stout that is a little different. Extremely coffee flavored stout that I really don't think belongs in the milk stout category."
"All in all, the is a drinkable beer that if I had around here in Michigan, I would definitely keep coming back to. It's a stout that would have a permanent spot in my fridge, from all-around drinkability to afordability."
"I think the drinkability on this one is just above average. Not a bad beer, just missing something IMO."
"Aroma smelled like roasted barley and coffee. Very dark, the brewhouse had low lightint so not sure if light would have given off any unique hues. Very thin tan head with very small, fine bubbles, minimal lacing. medium bitterness hits the palate but gives way to dark malt flavors and espresso. A good froth releases the dark malt flovors: chocolate or balck patent maybe? Chocolate milk and sweetness emerge also with the bitterness coming back around on the finish. There is a bitterness from the darker malts and it melds well with all th other flavors. very good Milk Stout from the Eastern NC Brewery. Cheers!"
"[Postscript: 18 months later, and another 6-pack of this enjoyed, the mouthfeel was much less sticky, but way too carbonated. Mouthfeel remains troublesome on this one...]"
"Glad I tried it but I'll pass it up next time."
"Beer is good. Happy chocolate milkstout beering."
"But I wonder how it would be on nitrogen?"
"Best before 6/06 notched on the bottle: Pours a nearly opaque black with nice tan head that retains well. The aroma is initially sweet with lactose, vanilla and cream along with some mild roastiness, and a slight floral hops presence...nearly perfect for a milk stout. The flavor starts off with some roastiness, followed by some lactose sweetness, vanilla, cream, some oily hops and a slight metallic edge. The mouthfeel is smooth but slightly watery and the drinkability is good. Overall a solid DR offering, all of their beers i've had so far have been well made."
"This beer is dark! No light penetrates the beer. There is a thick tan head. This is what a stout should look like. The smell is mixed roasted notes and hop bitterness. The taste is of roasted coffee and other roasted grain. The mouthfeel is smooth with a good lasting roasty aftertaste. I will drink this beer again. This beer reminds me of a good oatmeal stout. Reccomended."
"The body is light to moderate. Limited flavors and body really limit this beer. Carbonation is light as well. No off flavors at least."
"Poured several 12-ounce bottles over the course of a week to get a good feel for the beer. Came out a dark brown/black with some reddish undertones when held up to a light. Nice thick beige-colored head; good retention from the one that was poured early in the week. The head for the one that was poured later in the week dissipated fairly fast. Some moderate amounts of lacing from both though. A heavy cream, or sweet cream, aroma is present, with burnt undertones. The one at the beginning of the week came across creamy smooth and a little heavy on the tongue, while the later one came out just as creamy smooth, but not as heavy (not as sweet as the previous one also). Honestly, it's a very decent attempt at a sweet stout. However, I would wait a few days after putting a six-pack in the fridge before popping one open."
"Pours thick and dark with a creamy tan head and fades more quickly than I would have liked. Smells strong of coffee and milk but has nice hoppy notes. Taste is much like the smell with a dominance of coffee but one can detect the hops with every swallow. Feels pleasent to the palate aside from the bitterness which can be a little obtrusive, but for overall drinkability and price this stout will please."
"cheers..."
"All in all, a very drinkable beer. Not the best example of a milk stout I've had, but still good. Thanks to Lindsay and Emily for bringing these back."
"The mouthfeel was thinner than I expected but still made for a smooth, enjoyable stout."
"A bit of a letdown after this brewery's quite good porter. For a milk stout, I really didn't get much lactose sweetness that should be the characteristic. A bit thin, with a moderate malt sweetness and likewise moderate roasted malt flavors. Didn't bring to mind the ""fortifying"" aspect of a milk stout - this was rather bland and one-dimensional."
"Very drinkable as well. Lower ABV makes this a good choice for a session beer. Would buy it again."
"The Duck-Rabbit Craft Brewery claims, on this label at least, to be ""the dark beer specialists"". Having tasted their porter and this milk stout, I'd say that they have every right to make that claim. This is a tasty offering from an up-and-comer from the great state of North Carolina. Thanks to NClifestyle, my Duck-Rabbit connection, for the bottle."
"Chocolate and mild used coffee ground come out from the aroma. Deep black with a quarter sized mocha head. Very bitter in the fore with mild chocolate creamy/smoothiness through the middle and into the finish. A very serviceable if not stellar stout."
"This was a great example of the style. Very thick and ""chewey"" just right. Find it now and give it a try if you like sweet stouts."
"This was a pretty typical milk stout. Medium tan head and an opaque black body. Aroma of roasted malt, coffee, caramel, possibly come chocolate. The taste was more of the acrid coffee-bean taste, roasted malts, mild hops and a semi-sweet smooth aftertaste indicative of a milk stout. It had mild carbonation and a relatively smooth body which made it pretty enjoyable. Not the best I've had but gotta give a shout out to an NC brewery for giving it a shot. Not a bad beer."
"Drinkabilty:Low carbonation makes for silky smooth drinking."
"The deep black, ruby highlighted beer pours with a noisy thin-bubbled latte-colored head of medium and small bubbles. The head thins to a scant collar, leaving no lacing. The smell is sweet with plenty of roasted coffee tones. The taste is also sweet, roasted malts with chocolate notes up front finishing sweet and minimally hopped. The coffee/roasted malt notes linger. Medium mouthfeel, minimal carbonation, and smooth. An enjoyable beer."
"Slection of beer-of-the-month club. Poured a deep brown color with reddish highlights. Attractive foamy tannish head present. Smell is roasty, chocolately, coffee-like. Very enjoyable. Taste is of sweetened chocolate mixed with black coffee. Finishes with a nice dry hoppiness to compliment the sweetness. Great beer with excellent drinkability."
"My experience with this beer probably ended with my club shipment. I have never seen them distributed in the NJ/NY region...but if they ever are, I would surely consider purchasing some of their beers."
"Poured black with a ruby red tone when held to light. Not much head accumulation and thin retention. Nose is very subtle, of roasted sweet malts. Taste is a nice balance of creamy sweet roasted malts and finishes with a nice dry hop. MOuthfeel is creamy and full. Overall drinkability is very enjoyable - I would not mind tracking this one down on my next trip back east!"
"While not nearly as flashy or bold as other stouts, its still a good beer, that with a little tweaking, could make for a really great milk stout."
"Being a lover of Milk Stouts, I had to try this one. It looks creamy and opaque black with a thin light tan head that accompanied the last sip. The aromas are of black and chocolate malt and a hint of lactose to add a complex souring. The flavors are strong bittersweet without being grainy. Light chocolate and coffee flavors rise out of the barley malt showing mild astringency and lactic sweetness and sourness. Light hops show in the finish. The body is firm and quite creamy. The finish is similar but shows a little graininess and harshness, albeit light. All in all, better than most, but I have had much better."
"Hops: Nugget, Fuggle"
"Recieved three 12oz bottles of this stout in a beer of the month shipment. Striking label, and fascinating story behind the brewer as well. A thinking man's stout, to be certain. I'd buy it again, but won't break any land speed records to do it."
"Body thickness could be a bit more beefed up, but the subtle impartation of hops and lactose sweetness, combined with less acridity than usual for the style, makes this a nice treat, though not really sessionable."
"Overall Impression: Very drinkable. Rich flavors and texture are a treat and there are some mild hops that give it some complexity. Very enjoyable!"
"Very drinkable.... not as good as the porter IMHO, but probably my favorite milk stout nevertheless."
"I'd have a few of these. Very drinkable. Sweet but not overly so. Not big or really complex, but it would make a great session beer. I think it's slightly underrated."
"Drinkabilty - I think more than 2 of these in one sitting would be difficult due to it's texture and overall body."
"drinkability: its not hard to drink but why you would want more than one is beyond me"
"This beer pours at what appears to be a rich black color but after holding it up to the light, its a deep deep ruby. The smell is of roasted malts,hints of chocolate, coffee, and some kind of nut, cant quite put my finger on it. on the pour the head forms small and disappears pretty quickly. Super malty with maybe a hint of underlying hops. It tastes just like it smells the coffee taste really takes over. Over all I would say this is a very nice stout, will buy again for sure."
"Been wanting to try something from this brewery for a while. Pours a dark brown color with a slight head. No lace. Nose is slightly toasted and sweet. Flavor is full of milk and dark chocolate. Slight toffee and caramel too. Nice subtle bitter finish. Just a tad short of heavy on the toasted malts. Some heft to this beer with a very full flavor. However, the richness of this beer could be a bit exhausting after a bit."
"Drinkability speaks for itself. Very nice Milk Stout in my opinion."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" tan head above the dark brownish burgundy brew. Head quickly fades to a scant layer of bubbles, and lacing is average. Aroma is sweet, creamy dark malts, almost exactly what I was looking for here. Taste is sweet dark malts, with little to no bitterness, seemingly due to the added sugar, which is as it should be. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both excellent, with smoothness that just invites another mouthful, or two, or bottle. Check it out."
"Black body with a small light tan head that drops quickly. No remnants of that head are left on the glass. Big roasted malt notes in the aroma. Also a bit of dark chocolate and a light sourness. Flavor starts off sweet with chocolate and roasted malts. Light creamy sourness plays well in it. Finishes on a sweet toasty note. Body is medium and pretty creamy and smooth. This has enough going for it that I could have a few in a session. Solid example of the style all around. Thanks goes to my buddy Jason for the bottles."
"Drinkability: A nice sipping stout that grows on you."
"Drinkability: One of my favorite regulars in the stout offerings. Very drinkable while maintaining the qualities of a stout."
"Mouthfeel is too thin. This has a crisp feel initially which I think might be due to too much carbonation. Drinkability is good though. Nothing offensive about this one, just a bit subtle overall."
"Thanks Dad for tasting and reviewing with me. No born on date, poured a dark color with a small head and very little lacing. Sweet smell, malty and sweet taste with hints of chocolate and coffee. A good guiness like stout from a nice small town brewery here in North Carolina, I would love the chance to take a tour of the facilities when in the area next."
"Even with the thickness of the body, the beer is very easy to drink even on this hot summer day. I enjoy this beer, but wish it had just a hint more lactose sweetness going on."
"Slight 1/4 inch light tan head. Semi dark brown in color with a tint of red. Aromas of roast and a creamy lactose smell, not much more. Flavors of the same, earthy and roasty. Well carbonated, somewhat average mouthfeel, and a long aftertaste of roast flavor. Nothing extravagant anywhere with this beer, but well made and drinkable in any case. A good idea to try, but I wonÂ’t be buying again anytime soon."
"Noticeably thin on the pour, appearance somewhat akin to Pepsi. Nice roasty, lactic aroma with notes of coffee, milk chocolate and candy sugar. Starts off with a milky sweetness, which blends nicely into the darker, roastier baking chocolate flavors. Hop bitterness is noticeable in the finish as well, keeping this pretty fairly balanced. Has a mild touch of carbonation; any more and this would be some kind of odd chocolate soda. I will say that I enjoy the flavor on this one a lot. Thicken it up a bit into ""man-stout"" levels and it's really a nice brew. A good sweeter dessert stout...a session stout, if there is such a thing."
"Drinkability: Kind of reminds me of the latte I got from Starbucks this weekend. Not too keen on stouts, but I was given this one by a friend. I really enjoyed it."
"On tap at the Hickory Hops Fest on April 9, 2005. Had a couple of sampler glasses of this one, which I really enjoyed. Appearance is deep brown, essentially opaque, with a quickly vanishing beige head. Some patchy lace is left on the glass, but it's a bit difficult to judge overall appearance from the small glasses. Aroma is nice, with lots of burnt roast malt character tempered by carob and some sweet smelling lacto aromas. Mouthfeel is light bodied for a stout, but carbonation is good. Taste mirrors the aroma, with bitter dark roasted malts, a hint of nuttiness, and some sweet lactose. Hops are difficult to discern, and a more assertive hops profile would benefit this one quite a bit. Finishes with a dark roasty malt bitterness that lasts several minutes. Very well done for a sweet stout. I look forward to sampling the bottled version of this, as it's this small brewery's biggest seller."
"Pours a deep opaque black color with an offwhite bubbly head that dissipated so quickly I almost forgot it had one. Aromas are a mix of roast and smoke like tones, along with a slight lactic note and a bit of cocoa. For taste this one was quite a surprise. After being somewhat dissapointed by the appearance of this brew there was a nice intermingling of flavors. They started of slightly sweet with a deep chocolate tone to it. Following there was a nice mix between the roasty flavors and the lactic milky bits to this brew. The finish was sweet and just had a slight hint of astringency and smoke that balanced things out quite nicely. The body to this brew was fairly light but there was a nice creaminess to it. Overall a nice tasting brew but they really need to get their problems with their head retention fixed a bit."
"I received this beer in a trade with a gentleman in North Carolina. I was very much looking forward to tasting this beer. IT pours a dark brown with yellow and red hues in it and pretty much no head. For a stout it was certainly missing the impenatrable dark color and even a decent head on top. The nose is roasty with sweet malt scents and caramel malt. The flavor is watery up front but it is followed by a burnt almond flavor in the middle along with chocolate and a floral hoppiness at the end. THe hps could have redeemed some of this beer but they are just not seductive enough in flavor or aroma to do the job. There is also a bit of a sandy/earthy character to it. Overall this beer is just not that good."
"Pours deep reddish black, not as dark as some other stouts. Moderate bone head quickly fizzles into a thin ring, sparse lace. Aromas of choc malt, molasses, peat, and caramel. Flavor is chocolate and coffee, with a nice, lingering charred malt roastinesss. Thin bodied and light on the palate, too light. I like a little more meatiness in a stout. OK overall, but I won't be writing home about it."
"Pours black but with some deep red highlights with a slight off-white head that is gone in a flash leaving nothing behind,milk chocolate is very prevelant in the aroma with a little smokiness and a roasted coffee hint.Nice deeply roasted flavor with big doses of cocoa and smoke,alot of flavor melding going on but seemed a little light in the mouthfeel department otheriwise a top notch brew.A easy drinker with alot of flavor needs a little tweaking to be great in my opinion."
"Pours a deep, dark black that allows just the faintest bit of light to shine through. Small tan head doesn't stick around for long. Aroma of rich roasted malt, mocha, and briny, peaty smokiness. Medium body is slightly chewy. Palate is dominated by roasted malt up front, mellowing into a marginally malty sweetness typical of a milk stout. Decent and sturdy, although something is missing for this to be a great beer."
"Drinkability: A nice sipping stout that ultimately becomes just a bit too sweet for my palate"
