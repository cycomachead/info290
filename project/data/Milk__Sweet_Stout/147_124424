4.5,23,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"12 oz. bottle from Whole Foods. Pours very dark brown with a billowing head of khaki froth. Aroma of dark chocolate, ground coffee beans and roasted malt. The taste features a black coffee roasted bitterness, though a little warming helps balance things out. Hops are earthy and meld fairly seamlessly with the bitterness of the roast. The mouth feel is thin which helps, along with the lactose, to moderate the bold bitterness. Great balance. Light and tasty is a rare combination that deserves extra points. Love the low ABV.","loubar","Mar 26, 2015"

While it definitely wasn't a bad one from the brewery, it never really hit the heights of Young's Double Chocolate Stout or even Left Hand's Milk Stout but it was nice enough I guess.","flyingpig","Mar 23, 2015"

The taste was what it claims to be coffee, although it was very subdued and not pronounced like some other coffee stouts.  I maybe expected some sweetness and maybe that it why the coffee was not in your face as with others.  It was kind of nice to have a milder coffee option out there.  The flavor was good but not earth shattering.  The bitterness on this was mild and I would drink this again but I would not seek this out.

I was expecting espresso to a certain extent, but what I got was more of a latte: it's creamy, coffee-like, cocoa-ish, milk chocolatey, and gently nutty with an edge of sweetish dark caramel that's almost like a bit of candy-ish almost-burnt sugar. There's some dark malt acidity to it, but not much, and the bitterness level is restrained to what I'd call moderate. There's just enough to balance it in combination with the soft roasty dryness. It's easily drinkable, and I guess it should be at just 4.2% abv. A tasty treat that goes down to easily and leaves you wondering where your beer went.","NeroFiddled","Dec 09, 2014"

Nose is chocolate and coffee in approximately equal measure, with some toffee notes as well. Interesting on the palate ... There is plenty of chocolate but also dry roasted coffee bean to cut much of the sweetness along with some distinct dark roasted barley notes, chocolate malt all the way. Silky smooth and light bodied with a notably dry roasted finish with little residual sweetness. I probably would not be able to pick this out as a clear milk stout. As everyone says its a diversion for Stone and probably a worthwhile pick-up for the English stout lover. I find myself yearning for just a touch more sweetness.","CalgaryFMC","Dec 05, 2014"

I keep mentioning the bitterness, but it was on the verge of being too much. I wish Stone listed the IBUs on their website. At 4.2% abv, you could have a few of these with your pals and not get wrecked. So for a low abv beer, this is an absolute winner. Coroando's Blue Ridge Coffee Stout beats this one hands down for me. Try that one if you can find it. I'll stick with Young's Double Chocolate Stout (my favorite beer) and Left Hand's Milk Stout Nitro if I'm looking to drink a beer in this style as well.","ThomasMetal75","Nov 30, 2014"

Taste followed the same line but was thin in taste like it was Folgers coffee that was used (I am also a coffee snob....dark, French roast from like Starbucks is my START point for good coffee...). Finish was equally thin, with a decent lingering aftertaste. I typically swoon over anything with a gargoyle on it but this one was a bit of a miss.","gopens44","Nov 14, 2014"

Smells of coffee, sweet malt, slight roasted malt, hint hop, hint of alcohol, and a hint of lactose sweetness.  Fits the style of a Milk / Sweet Stout.  Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level.  Tastes of sweet malt, hops, slight roasted malt, hint of lactose sweetness, and coffee.

The aroma is a nice combination of the lactic sweetness, the coffee and a slight roasted malt astringency. The taste is not a punch in the mouth, as the style could be, but a subtle balancing of all the flavors in a lower ABV body. It really comes in to its own as it warms to about 50F. The body is lighter, as a milk stout should be, with a nice silky quality to it. A session-able and flavorful stout.","delta490","Oct 21, 2014"

Flavors mesh together nicely, has a long lingering flavor despite the light feel ing the tongue.  Not overly drinkable, for a low alcohol beer, it's more of a sipper, but kudos on the big flavor for a a beer that's badly over 4% ABV.  Overall a pretty good beer, but I was expecting a little more, It tasted more what I'd expect if they did a smoked porter series brewed over coffee beans.  Also, really expensive for a low alcohol six pack.  Still a good beer though, glad I got to try it.","AndyAvalanche","Oct 20, 2014"

4.03,10.1,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Overall I thought this was a good beer and good example of the style, it had pretty much everything that I look for in a Milk Stout and the added coffee worked well with this beer since it didn't completely dominate it and it kept this beer very balanced.  This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, fairly crisp, a little creamy, not too filling and the taste did a good job of holding my attention, I wouldn't mind drinking a few of these especially around a nice fall bonfire.  What I liked the most about this beer was the balance, the coffee was a part of this beer, but it didn't take it over and I thought the appearance was very good.  What i liked the least about this beer was nothing, there isn't anything that I disliked or would change, it's good just the way it is.  I would buy this beer again when I'm in the mood for the style and I think it's worthy of getting a six pack.  I would recommend this to anybody who like milk stouts, it's pretty true to style, it just has a little twist from the coffee.  All in all I was pretty happy with this beer, I was starting to get a little frustrated with stone since I haven't really been into there last few releases besides that quad, but this beer turned out to pretty good and it reminded me that stone can also make a tasty low abv beer.  This is one of the best beers I've had from stone recently and I this it's one of the better Milk Stouts that I've had.  Good job guys, this was a tasty beer, Keep up the good work.","StoutHunter","Oct 11, 2014"

3.37,-7.9,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.75,"Overall, despite how not-bad things sound above, both VDubb and I agree that this beer just falls very flat for us.  Due to the pedigree of the brewer, makers of the inimitable Stone RIS (or IRS...whichever), and the tasty sound of the constituent flavors, this should have been a slam dunk.  Instead, there's definitely some coffee, not much in the way of a milk stout base, really (more of a standard or even an English stout base), and a thinner-than-ever-expected body, all combining with some hefty initial interest and hope to produce a massive disappointment.  Again, I must state that this is by no means a bad beer (I drank half the sixer with no real qualms about flavor or anything like that), but it reeks of disappointment and malaise, something I've unfortunately experienced a lot of from Stone recently.  Despite not being bad, I'm not likely to ever have another of these, especially at that higher-than-most price point.  To sum things up, this stuff is okay, but somehow still finds a way to be mediocrity incarnate.","TMoney2591","Oct 05, 2014"

The pleasant coffee-cream overtones make this stout easy to drink, and the low ABV offers up a very sessionable brew.  Worth a try - I think this gets the job done if you're looking for an easy-drinking stout with straightforward coffee notes but without any excess sweetness.  If, however, you were expecting an over-the-top, complex stout - in the same vein as, say, a Stone's IRS - with only the ABV dialed way down, then you'll want to look elsewhere.","Buschyfor3","Oct 03, 2014"

The way the coffee is used is the best and most memorable part of this beer for me. It is blended and utilized well in a way that tastes even and lasting.

A fresh oat inclusion before charcoal and a hint of fruity alcohol/hops. This is creamy bodied and overall not bad.","stakem","Oct 03, 2014"

3.9,6.6,4,4,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 12/23/2014. Pours fairly pitch black color with a 2 finger dense tan head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Dense soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, dark bread, cream, toast, light char, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of roasted malt, coffee, and lactose notes; with good strength. Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, cream, light char, and roasted earthiness. Light amount of roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roast, dark bread, toast, cream, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of roasted malt, coffee, and lactose flavors; with a good roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and moderately silky/creamy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.2%. Overall this is a very nice session milk stout! All around good complexity and robustness of roasted malt, coffee, and lactose flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 27, 2014"

It looks great and smells very good, but the taste is flooded with a weird, nonstop bitterness that just lingers and lingers, and the feel is less like a milk stout and more like a mediocre porter. This beer would likely be great as part of a beer float with some vanilla ice cream, but on its own, it's a beer I'd probably not bother having again. Though my score is lower than the median by quite a margin, a ""good"" rating for a Stone beer on BeerAdvocate is, in my opinion, just not good enough. I was expecting more from Stone, and I know that they can do better than this.","Alextricity","Sep 23, 2014"

Aromas of fresh ground coffee forward, cut nicely with the lactose for some cream and milk highlights, and a solid roast characteristic. Flavors are heavily roasted forward, with a somewhat muted coffee character balancing nicely with a semisweet milk undertone. Again, solid roast characteristics help rough up the smooth cream notes, and the bitterness from the coffee helps further the balance.  Smooth, slightly dry in mouth, with a bitter roasted aftertaste. Subtle hints of cream sweetness linger on into an otherwise dry, slow finish. The balance and precision of an otherwise ""unsexy"" style of beer is really impressive.  Low ABV keeps the drinkability up.  Good beer!","GarthDanielson","Sep 22, 2014"

Flavor is also aggressively roasted (maybe even burnt) malts, some dark, fruity coffee, and creamy lactose.  Drying with some prickly carbonation that seems to give some body to an otherwise crisp, medium-light body.  It is on the lower end of the Milk Stout spectrum, so I wasn't expecting anything super bold and sweet, but I also wasn't expecting this level of roast.

A nice light milk stout with distinctive but not assertive coffee flavor.

Flavor is also coffee dominant, but unfortunately becomes fairly acrid and metallic mid palate. The roasty bitter finish evens it out a bit. Lactose provides a hint of sweetness. I'm not a huge coffee fan, but, if that acrid and metallic character weren't there, it'd be a good beer.","barczar","Sep 07, 2014"

3.75,2.5,,,,,,"O: I think Stone is on the right track here. As the market clamors for more session beers, most brewers have latched onto session IPAs, light lagers, and even some Belgian table beers. The stout category has been largely unexplored in this light. The potential is there for someone to really take hold of that niche in the market. It's a little more difficult though, as the average consumer expects a bigger boned beer out of a stout. I think they need to market this more aggressively as a session beer, and even go so far as to put 'session' on the label. It's the main selling point of the beer and it would prevent confusion among the consumers expecting something bigger. As it stands this is a nice enough drink for what it is. They do a good job of giving it just enough body and keeping the harsher aspects (astringency, etc) in check. It remains to be seen if 'session stouts'  will ever catch on, but if you're going to throw your hat in the ring then go full bore and market the shit out of it as such.","ryan1788a5","Aug 30, 2014"

There's a gentle bite on the tongue and it's fairly smooth, though not as much as the style can offer.

Big earthy roasted coffee bean aroma, sweet lactose and some light chocolateyness. Flavor is earthy and spicy coffee, some chocolate sweetness of you look for it, very light flavors but the bold coffee sits on the palate a while after. Some metallic notes. On the thinner side, though that is expected at the ABV, with high carbonation. This seems to need a bit more beef, and there seems to be room to do a at the low ABV. As is, pretty flavorful given the almost session strength. But creaminess would add a lot here. A good beer overall that seems to hit what it is going for: coffee and easy drinking.","BMMillsy","Aug 21, 2014"

Stone's Imperial Russian is utterly sublime so it was with great anticipation that I tried their Coffee Milk Stout.  After the first few sips I just sat the glass down and scratched my head then went and looked at the bottle again since what just went in my mouth wasn't a milk stout, it just didn't have the quintessential traits of beers that define that category.  It was a fairly drinkable Irish stout with a very faint whiff of coffee but it most definitely was not a milk stout.  Perhaps they passed a bag of lactose over the brew kettle but I think they forgot to add any of its contents.  I think Mr. Gallagher needs to return to the U.K. and continue his training before damaging Stone's reputation any further.","Pbennett","Aug 21, 2014"

Smell is of dark roasted malt, bitter cocoa powder, earth, char, coffee ground, and slight lactose aromas. Taste is much the same with bitter cocoa powder, char, burnt coffee, and slight lactose flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

3.7,1.1,4,4.5,3.25,3.75,3.5,"As a coffee fiend, I was excited to try Stone's take on the style. Poured a 12 oz bottle into a nonic pint glass, and it was beautfull: dark black with a sizable mocha head. The head stayed at about a half-finger's width until it was gone and provided nice lacing. The aroma was by far the best thing about the beer. It smelled exactly like a perfectly roasted cup of coffee with subtle hints of cocoa (noticed this after the beer warmed a bit). After the aroma, though, the taste did not live up to the nose. There was a distinct charcoal taste that I felt did not mesh well with the roasted coffee and sweet lactose flavors. It did meld a bit better as it warmed, but not enough to redeem it. The mouthfeel was decent with all the trappings of a standard milk stout. Overall, not a bad beer, but not particularly good either.","thomda11","Aug 10, 2014"

But I didn't get big coffee flavor, or dark chocolate. It's very smooth. I just wanted an aggressive beer. Like from most Stone beer's. The worst Stone brew by far.","Celtics17","Aug 09, 2014"

3.95,7.9,3.5,4,4,3.75,4,"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head that fizzled away quickly. Not much lacing at all. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like roasted malt, coffee, lactose and some dark chocolate. I think the taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's also some burnt/charred malt noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit creamy with a good amount of carbonation. I liked this brew, it's a good, enjoyable bittersweet stout. Off the top of my head I really can't think of other sessionable stouts like this one (just 4.2% ABV). I'll be buying this again! $10.99 a 6-pack.","bluejacket74","Aug 09, 2014"

3.96,8.2,3.75,4,4,3.75,4,"O: Definitely a solid offering from Stone and something worth checking out. Would make for a nice breakfast beer and is infinitely sessionable. I agree with a previous review that this would benefit from nitro. Perhaps in the future.","Dools9","Aug 09, 2014"

As a stout lover this would be one of my go to beers. For 4.2% ABV this has a lot of flavor, the smell, taste, and aroma are not overwhelming.","Catracho5","Aug 08, 2014"
