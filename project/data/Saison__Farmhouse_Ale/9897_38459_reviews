"O: not bad, but dissapointing. It's sour but not terribly complex and theres not enough ""dark"" character to balanace . After aging for this long I probably built up my expectations too high. It's cool to see how JP beers developed with 3 plus years of age though."

"Cloudy dark copper pour with a frothy two-finger slightly off-white head. Slightly sour and spicy aroma. Flavor is somewhat sweet upfront with a slightly sour edge. Can taste flavors of mildly sour fruit, yeast, caramel malt, light clove and earth. Highly carbonated with light to medium body. Finishes with a light sour taste."
"The beer pours a dark brown body with a thick white head. This smells like a dark brown sour ale. The flavor has a nice nuttiness, with a tiny bit of tartness and oak. There is a strong tingle on the tongue as it goes down."

"T: Bitter dark chocolate, fall spices, tart, raisin"

"O- Solid drink. Very interesting blend of brown ale sweetness, and sour notes. Not like a flanders, though."

"Overall, its good."

"Bam Noire pours a darker amber color with a HUGE foamy lacing head. There is a sweet aroma with HUGE Belgian candy notes. The taste is very sweet, huge Belgian candy flavors, and a creamy yeasty note. The body is a little flat, and a little watery aftertaste. Overall, big sweet flavors, and a very light aftertaste."

"This has a definitive hoppy bite to it. Vague caramel notes but that is not the best descriptor. Sour grapes overall. Drinkable enough but not something I would have regularly."

""

"Easy and crisp. Has a musty quality that affirms that the body is solid. Likable."

"O-pleasant drinking beer with unique flavors"
"A pleasant, and complex drinker, this is a fairly dark farmhouse style ale. Blindfolded before tasting, I would probably suggest it was some type of flanders red. The sour notes are much more present in the smell than taste. Light spice notes dance around the light and crisp wheat flavor, but never get too out of hand. Mouthfeel is nice and even, nothing out of place in the beer. Is this a balanced beer ? Absolutely, is it my favorite one I've ever had from Jolly Pumpkin ? Not by a long shot, but its damn good. For a 5 dollar pint, its definitely worth a try, although im not sure if I would buy it in a store."
""
"Overall: Well-executed beer. I personally prefer more funk and tangyness, but I don't think that's what they were going for here. Solid beer."

"Pours a hazy brown with red hues. Smells of caramel, chocolate, light fruit, light funk, and toasty malts. Flavor is tart and dry. Lots of toasty and roasty malts with a definite Jolly Pumpkin house taste. Fruity and crisp. Caramel. Carbonation is lively, and the body is light. Pretty perfect as a compliment to the flavor profile. This beer packs tons of flavor for such a low abv. Delicious. Probably my favorite ""Bam."""
""
"I let the beer warm back up to about 60 F and this beer really started to shine. But, It reminded a more of an unblended lambic then a saison. The yeast came through as the dark wheat malt tasted like it was melding with the rest of the flavors. Many of the characteristics of the saison that I expected were muted at best. But, I did appreciate the flavor that was there; it was just something different than i expected."
""
""
""

""

"O-A good dark saison. Saisons are one of my favorite styles and this is an good easy drinking representation of the saison with a dark twist. Just wish the taste was more pronounced. To faint/watery for a higher rating but a highly drinkable beer none the less. This could be very good if they just get those flavors to pop out and not be masked."
""
""
"Atmosphere is excellent. Giant head, and tons of lacing. Nose is fruity and yeasty. Yeast-laden with fermented fruit and bitter tea leaf. Overall, this is a really good quaff."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 6/28/2012. Pours lightly hazy dark ruby red color with a 2 finger foamy and rocky light khaki head with incredible retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a ton of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of sour cherry, green apple, pear, grape, clove, hay, pepper, oak, toast, cocoa, light roast, leather, funk, light vinegar, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of yeast, barrel, and roasted malt notes; with good strength. Taste of lightly tart cherry, green apple, pear, grape, toast, cocoa, light roast, clove, pepper, oak, hay, straw, light leather, funk, light vinegar, herbal, and yeast earthiness. A touch of earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, toast, cocoa, light roast, clove, pepper, hay, straw, oak, light leather, funk, light vinegar, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and oak flavors with a nice balance of dark/roasted malts; with a good malt/spiciness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. High carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth, crisp, and prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent dark saison style. All around good complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, oak, and dark malt flavors; and extremely smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
""
""
""
"I would buy this again and I am going back for more of their offerings based on this first impression."
""
"Pours a hazy dark red-tinged brown with huge cream colored head that settles slowly into a nice clump of meringue. Smell: leather, nutmeg, cinnamon, baked apple, cocoa note. Taste: quick hits of caramel and pumpernickel, green apple, lemon. Light body, creamy carb is quick fading, drying and baking spice covered finish. Not the best of the dark farmhouse style, but a tasty easy drinker."

"The body on this is light, as you’d expect from a saison/farmhouse ale, with a ton of carbonation and dry finish. What a fantastic brew. This is my second experience with Jolly Pumpkin and I continue to be impressed."

"Massively overflowing head, despite a slow pour. Color is a dark amber. Smells dry like sundried grass. Tastes dry. Flavor builds as I take more sips. Really bad first impression, though. Tastes like fermented grass. Aftertaste is dry. Little reward in this one. Bummer as really enjoyed Jolly's Oro de Calabaza the other night. Huge saison lover. Haven't tried regular Bam yet, though I do hear it's better."
""
""
""
""
"The feel was a little too airy for my taste, loads of carbonation carbonatuowill do that. Overall, this is a very pleasant and appealing ale that is not within the norms."
""
""
""
""
"Bottle 750ml. Dark Brown pour with rocky tan head. Nice citrus, wood and brettamonyces display. Feels similar to regular Bam in the aroma plus some light roastiness. Taste is nicely tart, quite bretty and has light caramel notes. Light bodied and dry. Very good for what is, but I do prefer the regular Bam by a mile."

"O: An amazingly complex and tasty beer for its size. I've had ""imperial this and that"" with less character than this 4.3% abv brew. A bit ashey from the darkness but adds a bit of dark fruitiness to it which I like, makes for a great aftertase. A must have by JP in my book."
""
""
""
"Overall a decent beer, but couldn't help but think something is missing."
"Opened a bottle - Batch 340/341. I emailed JP to find out the bottling date, with a (very quick) response of October or November of 2008! 5 years in the bottle this was fantastic...all flavors really shine through, with a nice surprise of dried fruit added. Super lactic and funky but just extremely well balanced. Well worth holding on to this brew for a while!!!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: As always, it’s another weird, wild ride from Jolly Pumpkin."
"overall this beer is interesting but not nearly as much as the other releases. its a easy drinker and teeters on going sour but just not quit there. it is balanced"
""
""
""
"Not a bad lightly funky Farmhouse Ale. Not my absolute favorite from Jolly Pumpkin, but it's another stand up beer from them. Would I drink another one? I wouldn't mind another one."
""
""
"O: A nice, crisp farmhouse ale that takes a few steps outside the normal boundaries of this category. I wish the funk in the aroma came through more with the tartness in the flavor, and would probably make this a regular if it was so. As is, I will probably seek out funkier and/or sourer farmhouses."

"D and O: It's a very interesting beer. It separates itself from the Bam Biere by the rich malty body. It's a really nice beer, dominated by the JP yeast strain. It's a solid brew."
""
""
"A little lacking in the flavor department from the sweet and sour sides, making the funk stand out a little more than it needs to. Not a bad beer, but this likely won't be a revisit for me, mainly because JP makes so many other delicious beers."
"Batch 1089, bottled 07.Mar.2012"
""
""
"Appearance is similar to a 'bock' beer, in my opinion, a translucent auburn hue. The aroma was interesting, reminding me of pot pourri, and apple cinnamon pie. For the flavor, I found it to be pleasantly sour and tart, like apple cider vinegar, and with plenty of that farmhouse funky yeast taste. It was very fizzy, light-bodied, and crisp, almost enough to make me pucker in the end. The only slight criticism I had was that I noticed a slight vegetal/herbal hint intermingled deep within the other flavors that I was not so sure about. I definitely want to have another though, and would highly recommend this to those that like sours."
""
""
""
""
"Needs more strength. Weak."
""
""
"Overall. Solid. Not bad at all. A good, funky saison. Will I get through the whole 22oz? Shouldn't be an issue. Not sure I'll be chasing this one down in the future though."
"O: this is a very interesting beer that is very easy to drink and quite flavorful for being lighter in body."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is not a very good beer. It has little to no complexity, little/no malt presence to play with the acidity, light funk even after being a year old, pretty one-note acidity. Disappointing."
""
""
"O- Above average, but not a knockout. I am excited to try more Jolly Pumpkin Ales though."

"O: I'm not a fan of Jolly Pumpkin's regular Bam Biere, but this version is far from bad. It's not one of my favorite Jolly Pumpkin offerings, but I am glad I tried this one. I could see myself serving this as a table beer at fall gatherings."
""
""
""
""
""
"overall, i think i scored this a bit higher than i should have, but i can justify it by saying this is my first ever dark saison. to me, it was very unique - even though i personally feel like it wasn't one of my favorite beers, i scored it a little higher for that reason. don't get me wrong - it's tasty, and looks/feels great, but i'm not TOO impressed considering the price tag on this one. it's also my first beer from this brewery, and if this is any sign about how the rest of their beers are, i can't really see myself spending close to $20 a 750ml bottle again."
"Pours a murky brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small bubbly patches of lace form quickly fade off the sides of the glass. Smell is sour and tart with some fruit and spice aromas. Taste is pretty much the same with the spices lingering slightly on the finish. This beer has a very high level of carbonation with a very crisp and prickly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but the flavor is a bit thin and I think it smells better than it tastes."
""
""
""
"Overall, pretty good. A bit thin in terms of flavour, but enjoyable. The mix of roasted malt and sour is not common and is a nice change, but isn't a perfect combo."

"This seems like the basic, base Jolly Pumpkin. The completely unique JP yeast is very apparent. Just not among their elite IMO."
""
""
""
"3 words to sum it up - oaky, roasty, light."
"this is definitely not rated high enough on here. a perfect example of a dark saison, bordering on a sour. beautiful pour, light translucent brown with a lasting tan head. smells like brett, lots of funk, perfect nose for a saison. flavor really features the brett, the darker malts used, and some really interesting yeast. almost a wild ale. maybe it is a wild ale actually. seems like it. i like the dark malts in this beer, not a common style as far as i know. feel is good, a little thin on the body and on the alcohol content too, it could have been like a 7.2% beer pretty easily, and for the price maybe it should have been. still, its light and drinkable despite its complexity, the carbonation is good, and the aftertaste is delicious. overall this might not be as good as the la roja, but its a realy good beer. jolly pumpkin is moving up my list."
""
""
"Taste is quite hoppy, in a Belgian way. Once again, there are dark notes such as prunes or raisin. Very carbonated and a dry finish. This is a distinctive beer. As usual, Jolly Pumpkin makes good beer."
""
"Forgot to rate this when I had it. Bottle at the brewpub in A2. Pours a dark brown with white head. Aroma of breadth malts with lots of yeast, candy sugar, dark fruits. and ever so slight hints of chocolate. Flavor follows with dark fruits and lots of yeast. Plenty of carbonation and pretty easy drinking. Was expecting something a little more flavorful but overall a nice beer."
""
"D - This is certainly sessionable, but it's just not got enough of a flavor profile. It's somewhat unique and more acidic than I'd expect for a Saison."
""
"Overall, this is a nice, fresh, easy drinking dinner beer. Can't say I'll buy again though."
""
"This beer is a rich brown-ruddy red colored liquid with a thin, film-like light-tan head. The aroma, a spritzy, citric scent, has a fleeting hop character and a slight yeasty funk. Lemon, backed with a slight sugar scent, and a wood barrel smell are also notable. The taste is refreshingly tart, with a subdued sweetness and malt underbelly. Wine-line in the finish, which is crisp and a bit effervescent...drier than expected, given the foretaste. Not bad at all."

"D: I’m sure it had more going on when fresh, but now it is fairly one-dimensional. Sort of a light & thin & tart Flanders. Not that it is bad, it is very interesting with lots of flavor in a sharp profile. But it is a bit too much to enjoy drinking by itself. If you have a bottle of this that is this old then try it with some dinner. By itself the carbonation & dryness take even the low abv right to your head. (plus the intense tart/sour flavor). Jeez, maybe its best use is to share it with friends as an aperitif or digestif with a good meal. It would be good for that."
"Very light on the palate. For sure the lightest sour I've had."
""
"Overall a great treat to find on draft anywhere, regardless of the season. Quite sessionable for the ABV and quite falvorful as well. Nothing revolutionary here, just a really solid dark saison."
""
""
""
"This pours an amber-red color with tight lacing. Clear, with no sediment. Tart aroma with hints of sour cherries rounding it out. Nuanced flavor, nothing really stands out or overpowers the palate (more accurately). I get the sour cherries and an earthy, oaky tannic taste. Nice mouthfeel, with an effervescence that keeps it light. The sour/tartness isn’t strong but it makes its presence known, and it has enough character to keep it interesting. An enjoyable sipper on a warm spring day."
""
""
"O- Very good, much more complex than Bam Biere. Wonderful treat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: very enjoyable. Fairly new bottle but I needed to clear out room in the fridge, sour flavors were nice but not heavy handed."
""
"O - I normally really dig JP beers, but this is near the bottom of my list. I wouldn't say it was a bad beer, just not what I normally expect or enjoy."
"O: There's a lot going on in this beer and it seems reasonably well balanced. One of the better American craft farmhouse ales."
""
""
"Drinkability is quite high with this one given the mouthfeel and ABV. I like the drinkability a lot."
""
""
""
""
""

"O – A fantastic saison with a unique malt character."

"At the end of the day this stand-out from Jolly Pumpkin is a hell of a lot of fun. A chewy and rewarding bottle for those familiar to the world of sour beer but also an excellent potential introduction for the uninitiated. Recommended drinking."

"Aroma is fruity, mainly apple and banana, with a yeasty undertone and a hint of miso. It pours a rich, tempting, dark mahogany with a pale tan head that does not stick around too long. Flavor is mainly fruity, like sour apple with banana and yeast notes and a hint of caramel. Texture is fairly fizzy, just a teensy on the thin side but still good."
"This was interesting, but seemed to lack just a little bit on the feel. Still, a very good beer that brings some real good flavor at a lower ABV"
"bottle poured into a snifter. Active off white head that quickly reduces to a cap, black as oil hue. Nose features slight sourness. Tart apple, cherry, and slight orange taste, somewhat earthy. Light and crisp mouthfeel, finishes to the dry side. Tasty little sour ale."
"O: Sour ales are not for everyone. If you are part of the minority, I would defiantly suggest this beer. I believe this would of benefit from a higher alcohol percentage. Try this one out, it's a breath of fresh air."
"Poured a dark brown/burgundy, with a creamy light tan head. Moderate retention and light lace. Nose has some rockets (the powdery, sweet and tart candy), light funk and tartness and lots of lemon. Taste flashes some dark malts right off the bat which disappear just as fast, and turn tart and lemony. Wheat appears quickly as well. Mouthfeel is transient with some very rapid carbonation (almost like pop-rocks on the tonuge, unique really). Extremely quick finish, which suggests another sip immediately."
"Brownish ruby colour, 1.5 fingers of white head, lots of sticky lace left behind. Smell is tart and yeasty, sugary sweet notes, sweet tarts candy like, sour lemony citrus notes. Taste is tart and yeasty, moderatley sour, lemon rind, fairly acidic, very quick finish witha almost no aftertaste. Quick high carbonation, medium body, lightish feel. Very drinkable and quite complex, aside from the super quick finish this was very good."
"Black saison. The JP aroma of sour yeast, sour, yeasty. Some head. Sour taste dominates, average mouthfeel, another good one in taste and drinkability. A little ginger and soda pop like carbonation.Other spices besides pepper are a melange. A palate flattener. Lacey on a blackish body."
"Lots of carbonation, mouthfeel may be a little thin. I've seen better from JP but this one was still worth a try."
"Overall it's a darn tasty treat. Jolly Pumpkin's 750's rock."
"A delicious, fruity, musty, barnyard saison. I enjoyed this one a lot, especially the aroma."
"Overall, I can't say as I'd recommend this one, which is a shame, as the first half of the taste was so good."
"I really like JP beers and this one won't discourage me from trying others, but I honestly hope there was just something wrong here."
"this beer seems to be completely in the finish. thats when all he flavor are heightened and then only for an instant. overall i think it could be a tad more complex. but it is good."
"O- This beer just did not work for me. It makes me realize that beer styles have an abv range for a reason. I think the low abv might contribute to the lack of flavor/so-so taste. I was disappointed. However, that's what trying out different beers is all about. I'm glad I got the opportunity to try this beer and give kudos to this brewery for making such a unique beer. Maybe I need to try it again to be sure I didn't get a bad bottle."
"Overall - Interesting, but not something I'd buy again. The dark malts muddle the flavors a lot."
"O- This is not a bad beer. I'm giving it a good score. It really grew on me by the end. I didn't have any problems finishing off the 750 on my own. That said, I still expected a little more. I think the Brett overwhelmes some of the subtle/nuanced qualities. At the sticker price, it may be a one and done. Something I'm glad I tried even though I may not be back for more."
"O: I enjoyed this. A little different, but definitely good."
"O- A little disappointing. Nice nose, spice and tartness, but no complexity or follow up. Lacking the flavor profiles I have come to expect from JP. I would drink it again, but too many other better JP offerings, to seek it out again"
"If you also love sour beers, I think you'll also be pleased with this one."
"Overall: Not among the top tier of Jolly Pumpkins, this one is missing a depth of flavor compared to the others; still, I would never turn away a beer from this brewery and this one is no exception"
"CHEERS!"
"O: I liked this pretty well. Not as complex as La Roja, yet still tasty and enjoyable. I would buy this again."
"O- a decent beer that is very drinkable. I threw back the bottle with no issue, actually the dryness kept me drinking. Smells great and is very appealing. I would definitely try this style again."
"This was a real good one - my first experience with the brewery."
"As for style, Bam Noire's label suggests dark farmhouse ale, which doesn't sit right with me. I think it should be situated between biere de garde and West Flanders red. "
"O - I've yet to be disappointed with a Jolly Pumpkin beer, and this is no exception. Complex, yet delicate. Flavorful, yet insanely drinkable."
"O - Jolly Pumpkin is the Cantillon of America."
"Being funky/dry and well-carbonated combined with the good fruit flavors and aromas make this a good one to drink."
"Overall: I was impressed with this beer. I haven't had much experience with Jolly Pumpkin and again wish I had tried more while they were available to me."
"O: Not overly complex and a bit thin."
"jd"
"Picked up a six pack of this one for about fifteen bucks not long ago. Poured a nice crimson color with a good off-white head. Aromas of spice, earth, yeast and a little funk. Light bodied and slightly tart/funky, with flavors of yeast, fruit and earth."
"I enjoyed the bottle but plan on trying some of Jolly Pumpkin's heavier brews."
"glassware: tulip"
"I'm all for crazy flavors, and sour beers demand some respect for stretching the mind. But I'm just as interested in a delicious and drinkable beer, which this isn't."
"D- Very easy to drink and a nice take on the style"
"D: This sour ale demonstrates that the intensity of sensory qualities can be restrained, rather than challenging, in such a beer. While it does not present itself clearly as a saison, it does represent a very approachable example of an American wild ale. This could be regarded as the pilsner of sours--not in terms of appearance or other particular sensory qualities, but in the overall cleanliness that is evident. There is no place for off-flavors to hide here, revealing a mild but focused flavor profile that shows no tendency to fatigue the palate. It also stands out for its sub-5% abv, further enhancing its approachable and forgiving nature."
"The bottle wont be a stretch to finish. Overall, pretty good. I think the Bam Biere is better, but this would be worth coming back to while it's available here."
"With Jolly Pumpkin you either speak their language or don't. That's the bottom line. If you like musty, tart funkiness in your beer you'll get along fine. That being said, Bam Noire does not hold up to the usual standards of the brewery and, even for the die-hard funk-heads out there, might be worth passing on, if only for a different, less contrived offering."
"Bam Noire is not the beer that I signed up for when I drank it. It is a dark saison, which is unusual, but sounded interesting to me. However, as I am realizing with many JP beers, it tastes very much like all of the other beers they make that are barrel-aged, they just have a weird funk, with just a tinge of tartness. Bam Noire though was not good. I suspect the base beer before barrel treatment was probably very phenolic and plastic tasting from fermentation that ran too hot, because the finished beer is just not good. I can taste the fermentation flaws and combined with the barrel, it tastes like old water passed through a sun soaked plastic hose that is run through an old leather glove. I spent a fair bit of money on this beer and most people that drank it agreed that it was not good. One of the few occasions that I have drain poured a beer."
"Drinkability: I don't think I'll be searching this one out again. I don't think the roast and sour flavors blend real well in this case."
"Notes: Not a bad brew, but it's probably the least memorable of the offerings from Jolly Pumpkin I've tried."
"Pours a deep brownish amber color with a good head and some lace. The aroma is fresh oak, lots of florals and some good farmhouse & horse blanket stuff. The flavor has a nice mild sourness throughout with some light caramel sweetness and a nicely fruity character. The beer is generally dry all around maintaining a good sharp tartness and a mild but pronounced bitter and spicy hoppiness. The palate is very spirzy but full."
"Pours a dark brown cider like color with a fluffy two to three finger head which gives way to decent lacing on the glass. The aroma is a little faint but of green fruits. The taste is tart with green fruits on the backend and cherries up front with sweet malt. The mouthfeel is thin with mild carbonation. Drinability is good it is a very easy drink. Overall it is a soild beer with a nice flavor and an easy drink. Easily could have a couple."
"The tanginess makes it a little less drinkable than ideal, but the taste itself is almost irresistable for the style. Alcohol level is very low, so that helps. A good change-up unique beer that I might get again, although a bit expensive in CA."
"T: Surprisingly, a little on the sour side, which was nice. Some cherries, vinegar, and some woodiness in the aftertaste. Goes down smooth."
"D: I normally love JP beers, but this one seems to be quite off in the taste department. Not offensive, but really no reason to drink it."
"Drinkability (4.5): This is a very good wild ale and packs a huge punch considering it's only 4%."
"Drinkability: THe mouthfeel and price definitely hurt the drinkability of this one. However, the flavor and aroma will keep me coming back."
"As it warms it tasted like old apples and pears, drink cold"
"it is well carbonated, almost a bit too much. not very complex, but still pleasing."
"Overall, I'm glad I tried this beer, but I'm not going to buy it again, and can't really see myself recommending it."
"D: I usually really like jolly pumpkin beers but this one was not something I can honestly say I truly enjoyed all around. It did drink pretty good though."
"Overall this wasn't my favorite, but nonetheless it makes me want to taste other Jolly offerings."
"D - Not my favorite of the JP ales. It is refreshing but I wouldn't have this one over."
"Taste: Tartness obscures the dark malts a bit. A little roasty, kind of has some porter flavors."
"D: Pretty drinkable, even for a saison. Not much detracts from this beer; it is simple yet complex, and the oak aging paired with the dark malts turn a crisp finish into a smooth one."
"Clear brownish red color. Tan head, thinish but very lacey. Moderate to mild carbonation. Intense smoky aroma, combined with powerful musty, woody, leathery aromas. Very Earthy. Flavor starts out smoky and toasted, as drink goes down, smokiness fades to tartness and soured flavors. Delicious contradicting flavors in one drink. Amazing how flavors transition in your mouth. The ending tartness of the drink causes it to feel heavy when first on the tongue, but turns into a light refreshing finish. And over all awesome beer with amazing qualities. A very delicious, drinkable beer."
"very yummy! I could drink a bunch of this stuff. wish it had some sourness...perhaps if I could manage to hold on to a bottle and not drink immediately..."
"Pours a reddish-brown color with an off-white head. The nose brings forward some oak, mild sourness, a bit of roast, and a light bit of funk. The taste pulls back quite a bit and shows oak and funk more than anything else. The taste is a bit funky and makes the oak known. Drinks pretty well; another nice JP saison."
"Notes: Never had a sour dark ale before (at least not one that was soured on purpose), but I have to reiterate that I don't really taste the dark ale through the funk. Good stuff, but rather drink regular ol' Bam."
"D: This was an interesting beer overall. The flavor didn't quite live up to the promise of the nose, but I still liked it."
"The beer pours a medium to dark brown color with a fluffy white head that hangs around until all the beer is gone. The aroma is quite a bit of Belgian yeast, along with some dark fruit, toffee and a little bit of brettanomyces character. The flavor is much heavier on the brett, as I get a lot of leather and orange citrus notes, as well as lemons, a slight bit of funk, toffee and yeast. The beer is very dry and is very easy to drink. Medium mouthfeel and a high, biting carbonation."
"D - Oh yeah. Easy on the pallete. Not as wine-sharp as a Grand Cru. Top notch."
"D-One of the more sessionable Jolly Pumpkin beers. I could drink this all day!"
"pour is amber murky with a head of about 2 fingers. tight nested over a murky head. nose is straw and lemon grass with a funky bacterial qualities hiding somewhere in the back. palate is one of the best saison table beers i've had. quality of floral hop blended with lemon grass and a mineral sour qaulity that was very subtle and not dominating on the palate. the malt was the kicker with a interesting very distinct but gentle roastiness. the feel was perfectly meaty with the mineral sour and floral brisk leaving a very dry feeling on the tongue. a clean earthy bitter that was not at all strong. very easy to drink. fantome caliber."
"Refreshing and sessionable without sacrificing any depth of flavor (on the contrary!). A unique dark saison, and one of the few domestic examples that I find similar to some of Fantôme's offerings. Quietly top tier, this."
"This is a fantastically easy to drink beer. It has a low abv yet maintains complexity with a refreshing feel."
"Drinkability: This is exactly what a drinkable beer is for me at this point in my craft beer appreciation. Sour, funky, malty, carbonated, and low in alcohol for generous, continuous consumption. Near perfect."
"I can see why they call this a farmhouse ale. There are plenty of barnyard smells here. Starting with a late winter silage aroma. Apple and sweet cherry are also here. A wet dog is here as well. Very mild hops aroma, too.This beer had one of the larges heads I have ever witnessed. The head is persistent, tan, and has plenty of lacing. Color is medium brown with red highlights. Translucent with slight cloudiness. The flavor is more difficult to pin down. Sour with a heavy umami presence. An apple seed bitterness settles onto the roof of the mouth with this beer. A very long finish. Medium carbonation with a light astringent mouthfeel. I don't know what to say about it overall. It is a very different beer from the usual lager, pales, IPAs, stouts, porters, and browns I am used to. I will give the brew the benefit of the doubt because I like the brewery. They are from my home state (MI) and if you have been reading the papers lately, they need all the help they can get up there."
"Nice, rather easy drinking beer. Worth seeking out as are most Jolly Pumpkin beers."
"D - Over all this is a good beer sure it not my favorite Jolly Pumpkin out there but its still a damn fine beer that I could drink the hell out of worth picking up sometime to try"
"Sampled a 750ml bottle from batch 262,263. It poured jet black with a khacki colored head. It had a very pleasant fruity/sour aroma to it. The taste wasn't as appealing as the aroma, there was a ton of carbonation and not very much of a finish at all. Not bad, but not great either. For almost $20 a bottle, I'd expect more than this."
"Served up a cloudy dark tinged walnut brown with an off white head that fades quickly and leaves no lace. The aroma is subdued with some brown sugar, toffee and a touch of musty cellar. It is so mild that even giving the glass a swirl really does not lend much more aroma. The flavor has a nice tartness and more brown sugary notes. There is some dark dried fruit in there as well, but I really have to search for it. A slight woodiness and touch of spice also manage to make it through the funky tartness as it warms, but this beer seems to be a bit one dimensional. It is almost like a mild but with funky tartness. Light bodied with a smooth mouthfeel and a nice long finish that may just be its finest quality. Drinkable, but not really all that captivating."
"D: Very good."
"Draft. Stopped in the brewery and had a little sampler of several beers. Dark red rust color with a white/tan head. Slight smoke notes in the nose along with some coffee. The taste is just ok in my opinion. Leather aftertaste. Medium mouthfeel. It seems to me that a lot of these JP beers have a very similiar profile and taste with slight tweaks. Just really not blown away be there everyday offerings."
"Highly drinkable. It's sweet but not overpowering due to the tangy. It's relatively low alcohol, so you can have a lot. I enjoyed this beer."
"Pours a dark reddish brown color with a full cap of off-white head, leaving decent lacing. Scent is of sweet fruits from apples to strawberry with a noticeable sourness to it, also a bit of fresh hay, must and dried grains and a touch of fresh bread. First taste is noticeably earthy, musty and sour, a multitude of fruit flavors are present but dont add a whole lot a sweetness, the backbone is a nice fresh dried grain, hay and bread taste. Medium bodied for the style, slight drying quality to the finnish. A nice beer with some earthy tastes that just get a little too in the way of some bright qualities."
"22 ounce bomber (Batch 262, 263) poured into a large tulip glass. Large volumous head with lots of foam and nice retention. As the glass sits the head develops nice pock marks. Color is a dark amber that reminds me a bit of maple syrup. Aroma is of Granny Smith apples and pears with some light fruity sweetness in the background. Interesting taste. Somewhat spicy, Very acidic with some roasted malt and dark cherry flavors with lots of sourness, especially in the finish. Light mouthfeel but there's plenty of flavor there. Overall an interesting beer to drink, though it's not what I would usually gravitate to."
"A wonderful farmhouse ale. Pours a darker color than most farmhouses and exudes a fruity (plum, raisins?) smell upon first whiff. Full bodied with a nice crisp head. Taste is very smooth with hint of lemongrass lingering on the palate. Goes down smooth and light."
"Drinkability: I really like this one and could drink it regularly. A greta combo of sweet fruit and funk. Jolly Pumpkin is becoming my favorite maker of this style."
"Quite nicely textured though, smooth enough. If anything it's a bit thin, but it's quite slick and smooth. Quite drinkable."
"D: Another low alcohol offering from JP. The ale is a bit more vinegary with the funk and stout interplay."
"I poured into a pint glass to a large, tan head. It is copper colored which is dark for a saison but expected since the bottle was clearly marked ""dark farmhouse ale"". The aroma is that tart, sour, wild yeast smell. The taste is tart/sour as well but just slightly. The darker malt does not play a large role in the taste. It is discernible but not a major factor. It is a lot better than the last couple of saisons I have had. Overall, it is a refreshing beer."
"Drinkability: My second beer from Jolly Pumpkin and another good one. Provided you enter with the understanding that they make sour beer, irrespective of what style they purport to be making, i think you won't be disappointed."
"An interesting brew. Saison? I'm not sure it has the freshness to fit the canonical style, even with its interestingly warped skew towards the dark end of the spectrum to give it some leeway. It feels a little flat on the palate, but it's an adventurous and unusual beer, and I respect that."
"D: I enjoyed the flavors of the beer, but I found the finish to become a bit tiresome and drying. Still a good beer, but not Jolly Pumpkin's best."
"drinkability: truly interesting brew. I enjoyed the expereince of the beer but unlikely to seek out again. maybe...."
"Drinkability: This may be the most drinkable Jolly Pumpkin offering yet -- and it's rapidly becoming one of my fast favorites. The flavors are solid and funkiness and tartness is a little mild so this would be a solid beginner beer for people looking to get into the style; the ABV is very slight and more than manageable at 4.3%."
"Drinkability: This was a very weird beer. I had no problem finishing it, but I wouldn't ever purchase it."
"Nice example of the style."
"Overall impression: Decent, but a bit one-dimensional with the sourness."
"M- Dry and very bubbly."
"Loads of carbonation and a surprisingly light and airy body for the color make this beer quite easy to drink. The low ABV is odd to me, but it doesn't really hurt this beer in my opinion."
"I don't know why this beer exists. This dark Saison has almost nothing that Jolly Pumpkin's standard saison, Bam Biere, doesn't have outside of a remarkably dark hue. They are essentially the same beer, though this particular batch of Bam Noire is better executed than the last bottle of Bam Biere that I had. If you like Jolly Pumpkin's other saisons then you will like this one."
"I had this on tap into a tulip at Local Option. The beer is a hazy light straw with a decent head. The aroma is pretty nice and complex, earthy floral hops with a ton of tartness. One of the most tart saisons I've had. The taste is a let down, its super tart almost like a wild but its a weird floral tart that isn't very good. A very disappointing beer."
"D: Another very good beer from Jolly Pumpkin, but I am some what confused at what this is supposed to be. There doesn't seem to be any ""dark malt"" character, this seems to be a slightly less attenuated version of Bam Bier. I was expecting some chocolate or roasted notes laid on top of the saison character, this is just a good saison with a dark color. I just said to my wife ""if your eyes were closed, you would never guess the color"". With all of that, still a recommended beer, something worth seeking out."
"With almost no alcohol presence, this one is very easy to drink. Mouthfeel is pretty thick and creamy. This is the beer equivalent of a sour lemonade."
"On draught at the wonderful Lord Hobo:a very lovely spiced dark ale that doesn't lean towards sweet tackiness or hoppy saison; well balanced, at least to me, one who does like the dark lagers & hearty ales. A dark ruby brown pour with 1 finger of tan foamy head and some sticky lace. The aroma gives tell-tale dark roasted malts, with good grainy bread as well as some lambic sour and spiced plum. Medium bodied, smooth and well-balanced flavor of tart sour saison qualities with dark dunkel-esque lager malt and some spice, but not syrupy. Good for a slow sipping on a snowy day; low in alcohol but good to ponder things with...next time in a tulip glass..."
"M/D - Somewhat creamy feel with an intersting balance of high carbonation. Very easy drinking. Not sure this really reminds me a whole lot of a saison, but I dont expect much in terms of traditional flavors when dealing with JP beers."
"Pours a dark brown ruby color with about an inch of sandy head that laces ok. Smell is a bit reserved, some lemony tart notes, some yeastiness, though not much else I can pull out. Taste, however, is actually pretty good in my book. There's some nice tart funky notes, some lighter saison-type fruit notes (lemon, lime, orange), and a bit of the darker, almost spicy notes that linger in the background. A bit reserved, but definitely a really drinkable beer. MF is bright and bubbly with some decent carbonation. Dry finish, lasting aftertaste. I actually really like this as a interesting session beer. Like a sour light. Not necessarily worth the price, would buy this all the time at $6. Would prefer La Roja (the only other JP brew I've had at this point), but not bad at all."
"D - easy to drink in a literal sense, though I'm not sure I'd want to. I feel like this beer is trying to be a jack of all trades, but the reality is it's a master of none."
"I felt that the beer was too carbonated, the mouthfeel just wasn't right. This was really the weak point for me. Overall I'd probably have it again, but wouldn't put it in my favorites."
"A dark amber color. Good head, pretty drinkable. Just not my favorite."
"D - All that being said, I can drink it. Think of it as Saison Lite. Not bad, but not a Saison. Not good, but not terrible."
"Drinkability was good. You must be a fan of JP's brett to love this. It's not my fave, as I prefer the classic horsey-ness of Dupont, but it's quite sessionable and enjoyable. A nice cheese would make this sing more. Decent beer but could use some significant improvement in m/f."
"D- Drinkablity is exceptional and I would love to get more of these but they are out of season and i've bought the last one at my store... cheers!"
"Complete surprise! We thought that this was going to be a sweeter, rounded saison due to the explanation that this was to be a saison noir. Some wild yeast and spices give this beer a very prickly mouthfeel and murky, ruby complextion. This really reminds me of Orval, but not for the right reasons. The color is confusing the issue and it's hard to drink more than one glass. Unfortunately, we went for the 750ml, so we have some work to do between the two of us! $12 is a bit steep for an experiment with somewhat of a misleading monicre."
"D: 4.3%? Highly drinkable, even in 750 ml format. Have it with a cheese plate. Be jolly."
"Overall, it was easy drinking because there wasn't much to this beer. I had high hopes, cellared it for over a year, but really only the barnyard of the brett stood out to me."
"Overall - This is a very strange, unique, and interesting beer. Much different than anything I could have expected. Not overly sour, not overly dark, but a combination of those two characteristics. Highly unexpected."
"Drinkability is slightly above average for the style. This beer was not amazing, but did really grow on me after awhile."
"D: Nice beer, I would have loved to put it side by side with a Bam Biere. I would drink again but I am new to Jolly Pumpkin so I am still working through all of their beers."
"Now that it's back to warmer saison-type weather here in formerly-frozen Florida, this is an excellent choice. I have no problem with lower-ABV saisons at all. Better than the regular Bam Biere by a lot, per my reckoning."
"O: A good beer that I will enjoy when I visit Jolly Pumpkin in Ann Arbor, this beer is definitely exotic for my palate."
"Mahalo! Beertracker"
"I could displace all of the oxygen in my living room with the CO2 in this bottle and I'll be burping for years to come."
"The dark color belies a very solid, lighter bodied saison. Highly drinkable and on a par with some of Jolly Pumpkin's other outstanding ales."
"(D)- An interesting farmhouse whose color certainly makes you do a double take. A well-made beer that I think is overall a bit more successful than their regular Bam. Definitely will have this again & again. Very fond of how this one tastes compared to other saisons I have had."
"D- Drinkable? Hell yes!"
"Overall, a tasty brew, but needs a little rounding out i'd say. All the seperate parts are good, but they don't mix as well as they could. Hard to pinpoint what im trying to say, so i'll just shutup now. A good beer."
"Drinkability - Relatively so. It is quite a low ABV for a ""normal"" craft beer but that does not mean it lacks on flavor. It is quite flavorful and quite quaffable. The more I drink of this the less out of balance the earthy/funk tones are and the more I am enjoying this. I will admit this is not one of my favorites from JP, but a great offering nonetheless."
"Enjoyable beer, though it tastes similar to other brews I have had from JP and not much like a saison either. However, it is rather drinkable and complex and is admirably low in alcohol and high in flavor."
"Jolly Pumpkin Bam Noir pours a finger of sticky beige foam over a dark brew, though up to the light it's rosy. Carbonation is massive- the nose is the now familiar cidery Jolly Pumpkin funk with a tingle of herbal hops. The flavor is very tart lightly-toasted malts, oak, and a bit of grassy hops off the back. The mouthfeel is very very dry and also very light and crisp, do in equal parts to that tartness picked up from their barrel aging and the high carbonation. Not for everyone, but if you've gotten a taste for a bit of sourness this is an okay one."
"Notes: Had seen this several times in bottles before today. Nice to have on tap at the brewpub."
"D: I let this beer warm for at least 10 minutes before tasting it, and at that point I initially found it a little lacking as it was seemingly one very basic flavor combination (mostly brett characteristics and fruit), but as it warmed it opened up and became much more interesting. And the yeast pour added some complexity to it to be sure. But even then it was still not that rich or involved. I enjoyed it, mainly for the straw-like, horse-blanket, mineral and tart contributions of the Brettanomyces, and the oak, but it never got off the ground. So, I'd say that it's better than the Bam E.S.B., but I'll take any other Jolly Pumpkin before this one. On a wider scale... it's OK. It's at least interesting. It has a place in the world."
"overall pretty disappointing. i felt like there could be so much more, such great potential in the idea of this beer, but really poor follow through, at least in this bottle."
"Drinkability: This beer is incredibly well balanced and refreshing. It has dark flavors and has the most impressive acidity with well integrated hop profiles. The levels of malt are subtle and the beer finishes dry. This beer would be an impecable pairing for pulled pork or fresh bacon."
"J"
"Overall, a really good beer from JP. They continue to amaze me."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied and smooth with a good strong bite."
"Notes: Well, I could tell from the nose that this beer wasn't going to provide enough funk to satisfy me, but the lack of Brett on my palate was ridiculous. Add to that the bitter astringency, the lack of interesting flavors, the absence of good carbonation, and the thin, watery feel, and you've got yourself a beer that utterly fails to impress me. I'm quite disappointed with this offering from Jolly Pumpkin."
"This beer pours a dark mahogany color. The head is a half inch in height, and recedes quickly into a quarter inch cap of white foam. The aroma is very sour, and very tart with a solid yet soft malt undercurrent that seems to weld everything together. This is a very inviting aroma for someone who loves wild beers, and in fact it makes my checks pucker and my mouth water. The taste is mellower in the sour/tartness, but it is still noticeable. The malt is a lot more pronounced too, but it doesn't seem to add anything to the beer. The taste is nice, but not great like the aroma. The mouthfeel is thin with a watery texture, and lively carbonation. Overall, this is a nice beer. I think it would benefit if the taste were even just a little more sour."
"Light citrus simple sour flavors. Not much of anything for this one. A pleasant, light, simple citrus brew but not worthy of Jolly Pumpkin. Best thing about this one is the cool label. By the way, it's not really bad; it's just not good. It tastes sort of like a lightly spiced, lightly sour ""less sweet"" 7Up."
"Quite dry and malty textures offer creaminess up front and then dries considerably and creates moderate astringencies in the finish. Challenging but pleasant and refreshing beginning to end."
"It can't overcome the overwhelming, crushing sense of dryness. There's some promise here (and I like the original Bam), but nothing steps up flavor-wise to complete it."
"12 ounce bottle acquired as an extra in a recent trade with brewdan, thanks again, drank on Tuesday night, reviewed from notes, served in a Rader snifter, color is medium brown with some dark orange in it, 1/2 inch bubbly white head, not much retention, minimal lacing, aroma consists of tart roasted malts, lemon juice, sour apples, brettanomyces, some spices, and cherries, starts off with berry-like fruits and cherries, caramel in the middle that is a little roasty finish has a bit of spice, pretty tart the whole way through but it is always in the background, does not jump right out at you, nicely balanced between sweet and sour with the fruits, this works well, fruity and tart mouthfeel, medium body, lots of carbonation, taste lingered fairly well, pretty easy to drink despite its color, light in alcohol and cannot taste any, smooth stuff, glad to see this stuff is available in California now, will be drinking again, add another solid brew to Jolly Pumpkin's lineup that I have had now, recommended"
"One finger tan head that killed quick, dark brown/black body. Oak on the nose. Oak on the tongue, dry and slightly sour. Not much in flavor or complexity. Minimal lacing. Decent sour, not really interesting considering the dark malts could have added much more to it. Disappointed in this JP, they can't all be winners."
"This may have some old-school Saison qualities but it's not what I think of when the word ""Saison"" comes to mind. It drinks a little slower than your average Saison - the vinegar tones and the darkish fruit - a little apple and prune - maybe a touch of cinnamon and clove - slow it up a bit, definitely. Am guessing that JP accomplished what it wanted to here 'cause there are no true flaws to me - I just don't enjoy it as a representative of the Saison style."
"Drinkability is good might be a touch to tart with out enough going on to back it up. Still enjoyable though, might not be on par with other Jolly Pumpkins I have had but enjoyable just the same."
"Drinkablilty is only OK here. I am just not a Jolly Pumpkin type of drinker."
"I don't mind a little sour bite in my Saison, so I found this to be plenty drinkable."
"I had this on tap in the Jolly Pumpkin Brewpub just north of Traverse City. I would agree with most reviewers that it is definitely an aquired taste, as are all JP beers. This is belgian in style and contains plenty of funk. This beer is high in carbonation and has a wonderful brown color. The tartness could be unpleasant if it is unexpected. I would have no problem using this as a session beer. The lighter mouthfeel is fine for summer, even though the color says fall. Keep up the good work, Ron."
"There's something off with this brew...it seems way too carbonated, which might be the root of the problem. This is my first Jolly Pumpkin beer and I can't even finish it. It's a sour little bitch with no real qualities that can be enjoyed, other than the aroma. Epic fail in my opinion. I'll just pray that I had a bad bottle, but by judging from some other reviews, it seems unlikely."
"Overall, not my favorite offering from Jolly Pumpkin, but still an OK brew. Worth a look, but don't put much effort into your hunt."
"750mL bottle into a Duvel snifter pours a murky bubbly dark brown with a nice frothy light-tan head that slowly diminishes to a thin layer and leaves decent lacing on the glass. Aroma is nice amount of funky fruit with a touch of brown malt and cocoa. The taste is a very intriguing blend of sweet malts and fruits with the textbook brett funkiness and a hint of brown malt. The beer is light crisp and nicely carbonated. I must say, this one is a truly unique beer, quite enjoyable."
"Drinability: The abv is spot on, but the sourness could make this a slightly difficult to session. If you are looking for something unique, this is the ticket - definitely not for the neo-phyte."
"Great drinkability, especially with the ABV."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with a soft but crisp carbonation. Interesting and really nice beer."
"if this is a ""saison", it's definitely more to the sour side, as with all JP brews."
"Certainly not a bad beer, but I don't think I would buy it again."
"Drinkability: decent slow sipping beer if you are in the mood for the style. In no way can this be considered a sesion beer depsite the lower alcohol levels as the sourness will tire you after one bomber bottle."
"Was glad to have tried this, but I don't think I would drink it again."
"Overall a beer that keeps me interested enough to want another."
"Great beer, as anyone would come to expect from Jolly Pumpkin."
"The dark malts work will with this JP beer. An added level of complexity is welcome beyond the broadly lactic profile. I'd still like more bretty funk and a sharper, cleaner acid bite though."
"D: Very nice drinkability, yeasty but with a dark worty nature makes this sure to delight. Just the right amount of yeasty nature makes this easy enough for the newbie while still offering enough satisfaction for the most dedicated of style."
"I don't want to say it ""clashes", but comes close. The funk/sour overrides the dark malt character just a bit too much. The ""fizz"" doesn't help - it thins it out. For a mild abv, this is one slow sipper. I give it ""kudos"" for being unique."
"Pours out a dark, dark brown with a massive head, I mean inches, with loose clingy bubbles that stay around, leaving traces all along the side of the glass. The color is not very traditional, but I can't help but think this one is beautiful. The smell is fairly straightforwardly funky, but what else would you expect from JP? You can't exactly smell the dark malts underneath, but you notice it when you taste. I fell in love with this beer from the first sip. You notice this brilliant caramel sweetness, almost backed with a bit of coffee, bittersweet chocolate, and almost vanilla. And it finishes wonderfully tart. The perfect balance so that the tartness, sweetness, and dark malts never come unbalanced. You know what I think this tastes like? Tamarind. I think this will be one of my 'subjective' score beers, since I've never seen anything like it. The mouthfeel is a little thin, but never unpleasantly so. That's about all I can complain about. And at 4.3%, I could drink this forever."
"Beer pours a deep mahogany color with creamy head that slowly dissipates. Scent of citrus and cherry. Flavor is overwhelmed by the citrus (lemon) flavor and hides any presence of malt or hops. The citrus does however lend itself to making this a very crisp and refreshing beer. I would gladly have another one of these but with so many other farmhouse ales (saisons) that I haven't tried, it may be a while before I get back to this one."
"Out of a 750ml capped bottle. Pours a deep murky brown color with a huge loose tan colored head that left some rocky lacing and a rocky cap. Settles pretty quickly. The aroma is lemony tart, green apples, and some farmhouse funk, horse blanket etc. The taste starts off quite tart, very lemony with unripe granny smith apple, not much of the farmhouse in the flavor. A mild malt presence helps cut the tartness. Moderate body with soft carbonation, a tad dry. If tart is your thing that this is one you want to pick up. I find that the tartness just kills the other flavors for me and it's basically all I taste. Didn't really remind me of a saison."
"D: This is a drinkable beer with good character and a lively personality."
"M - Very thin bodied, mild carbonation."
"M/D - I tend to gravitate towards the JP products that have something going for them aside from the funk, and this one does fit that description. Overall, mild for a sour, interesting, and priced so I would only recommend it if you are a fan of sour beer."
"750 ml/$10.99/Sylvan Market"
"Highly recommended."
"2007 vintage 750 ml bottle. Pours light porter colour- cola like with vigorous head. Nose- very dry musty smelling, with some citrus. Taste-strong wood flavours, nuts, some dark fruits and bretty kick. Very thin body, just slightly less drinkable than regular Bam, but interesting all the same."
"definitely not worth the high price shelled out for a 750 ML..."
"8/4/8/4/16 (4.0/5)"
"D - Pretty enjoyable and easy to drink"
"Drinkability- Clone of Fantome Black Ghost that comes out almost as good. Definitely worth a try."
"D - very easy to drink."
"If you are a fan of the funk, this is a great brew. Its also a great way to get yourself introduced to the style. I am slightly biased due to the fact that I love everything Jolly Pumpkin does - which means you should be checking this brew out!"
"Poured into an Ommegang goblet. Dark mahogany with a thick crown of beige head. Excellent retention and lacing. Great brett aroma with tart vinous notes, unripe cherry, and a touch of cocoa mix. Flavor isn't quite as deep or complex. Still some bitter fruit up front and a mild chocolate sweetness, plus a very peppery dry finish. Mouthfeel is quite overcarbonated at first, but after some swirling and breathing it comes down to a normal level."
"Mouthfeel is light and arid with fast moving carbonation. This one floats over the palate and is incredibly easy to drink. Would be very refreshing on a hot day, too bad it's freezing right now in Chicago. Overall, I was hoping for a little bit more of a robust flavor here, but in the end it's still a tasty variation of Bam. Pairs well with some 6 year old cheddar as well."
"Overall a solid offering. I like other Jolly Pumpkin beers better, including the regular Bam Biere."
"This was a tasty beer. Ive never had a dark saison before but this one definitely spoiled the style for me in the best possible way. Pours a dark brown cola color with a small off white head. Subtle funk to this one, some notes of coffee and faint chocolate sweetness. Grassy dry hops and coffee cream round this one out. Not overly huge on flavor, mild and very drinkable. Light medium bodied, i recommend this over the Bam Biere even though both beers are exceptional."
"Carbonation is huge and really too much. Beneath the bubbles there seems to be a thin watery complexion. Disappointing brew really. Goes down fine, but the brett just takes over and possibly ruins something more enjoyable beneath it all."
"I really like this saison - it's really funky and quite different. At such a low ABV it's very drinkable and refreshing. Definitely recommended."
"D - Not really working for me. There's a lot of flavour in this, but isn't quite right. There's just no life in this beer - it doesn't pop, and doesn't excite."
"So, I take over a month off from reviewing beers and this is what I am welcomed back with. Goody me. I don't quite recall where I bought this bottle at. Chicago? Kansas City? I know it wasn't Omaha because I am boycotting carrying JPs at Beertopia at the moment. I hope that changes. While I am not crazy about most of their beers a good number of people are. I respect JB. I ""get"" their beers. I understand their niche. I don't understand this beer. Major dud. Avoid."
"JP keep their rep and theme with this beer, but its smoothness is welcome in the wake of their other beers I've had. She's a keeper."
"Overall, this is a mediocre saison and a decent sour ale. It ranks lower down on my list of JP beers, but it's nice to see the brewery continuing to push the boundaries of style with something unconventional."
"Taste is nearly a 180 from the smell! None of the fruitiness from the nose makes it to the 'buds. Dry, woody, earthy, tannins. Funk-a-licious...Brettomyces!"
"Drinkability- While I will end up drinking the other 5 bottles over the next five years or so, I will be doing it very slowly to see some significant changes (hopefully)."
"It's quite refreshing and supremely drinkable, just not quite as complex or solid of a brew as the original Bam. Good beer, but maybe not quite worth the price I payed for it. Well worth a try though."
"750ml bottle, poured into a New Belgium chalice. Dark, cloudy reddish-brown color with a substantial head on top, and excellent lacing. There's a soft maltiness in the nose, and a little ripe fruit. Interesting flavor: an initial graham-cracker malt, not too sweet but with a little cocoa. Fruity, yeasty, with a pleasant tart sourness that's much less than the Bam Biere and better blended. Finish is satisfyingly dry."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1"" light tan head over the cloudy reddish amber brew. Head lasts tremendously, with heavy frothy lacing. Aroma is spicy and tart. Taste balances the spices with the moderate tart, an intricate tightrope act that JP has mastered here. Mouthfeel is smooth but a little too bubbly, maybe, with nice drinkability as well. Another good thing from the barrels of JP."
"Pours a clear dark orange/brown, thin off white head forms, drops some nice lace, light ring around the glass sticks, looks good. Smell is good, sweet and malty, grains, brown sugar, tart citrus kick through the middle, honey coated bread, sour dark fruit, nice. Taste is caramel, fruity sourness, toast and dry spice in the middle, tart citrus and biscuity malts in the finish, drying. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation. Nice beer, JP always delivers. Thanks Paul!"
"D: Rather enjoyable."
"Drinkability - I expected this to have a very strong flavor with lots of funk and was pleasantly surprised to find the opposite. Very well balanced, light and refreshing. I am a huge fan and will definitely pick up more bottles soon."
"D: I was expecting this to be a sour & funky monster and instead was surprised at how balanced it was."
"bottle shared at tasting. Pours a muddy chocolate brown with no head. Smell is fresh, tart, and fruity vinegar, and cherries. Taste is mild, dusty, and lightly funky with very faint tart fruity dark flavors. Bubbly mouthfeel, light, and mildly flavored compared to the nose again. Decent."
"Bam Noire has farmhouse written all over it with gentle, backdrop souring, and a gentle body that holds a persistent cap of beige suds. Casually elegant."
"D - An interesting take on the saison, adding dark fruit flavors to the traditional earthy spice. Another winner from Jolly Pumpkin. Low alcohol for such a dark beer. Flavor stays appealing as it warms."
"750 ml bottle: An awesome sour apple, sweet, yeast, a little bit of caramel malt and some fruit undertones. Appearance is a deep dark reddish brown with a thick tan head that lingers for a while. Taste is subtle but very refreshing. The notes in the aroma don't really pop. Nice and tart with some lingering yeast. Palate is nicely carbonated, lip feel is bubbly, mouth feel is light with a lightly malty aftertaste. Overall, It's pretty good stuff. Not as good as the regular Bam or the ES bam IMHO. Cheers!"
"Pours a very dark ruby with a fluffy two finger light khaki colored head which stays there forever. Solid layer of webbing remains on the sides of the glass once the head finally decides to fall down. Lots of tiny crazy bubbles sprinting to the top. Smell is funky and sour with hints of leather and wood. Pear, a touch of vinegar, and sour yeast in the nose with some apple as well. Pretty complex aroma overall. Taste begins with lemongrass, farmhouse hay, and sour dark fruits. Earthy hops and some woody malts blend midway leading to a funky dry aftertaste. Again this beer is complex but in the flavor profile, very nice. Light and creamy feel with a medium body and steady carbonation. I feel this could be a very interesting session brew. I've seen a few JP brews around here, but unfortunately not this one. Bam Noire is just proof again that American breweries really know what they're doing when it comes to Belgian style beers. Keep up the good work JP, you Michigan folk are lucky bastards."
"This is quite a refreshing beer for the hot weather, very drinkable. I think I would drink this more often in the summer if it were available in NJ."
"D, notes: Lactic sourness makes this want you to come back fro more adding significantly to drinkability. Jolly Pumpkin makes very good beer my only concern is they all taste kind of the same."
"drinkability is good. good balance, restrained funk. very nice."
"Overall, good enough, and worth having more of. Quite refreshing."
"D-On tap, could probably have my fill. Out of a bottle, one every now and then would be good."
"straight 4's here"
"Pretty acidic, but almost too light, almost watery feeling, but at 4.3% abv I'll let it go somewhat. Nicely drinkable."
"Cracked this one open to commemorate my trip to Kalamazoo tomorrow. Served in my Delirium Tremens tulip. Batch 262,263 on a sticker on the back of the bottle. Poured a deep opaque brown with a purple hue. Rocky one-inch off-white head dissipated gradually into a thin consistent skim of algae. Sheets of lacing with good retention present during the tasting. Scents were difficult to tease out, but first impression was sour and wine-like. Flavor was also subdued; more sour, but not overwhelmingly so, as well some oakiness (reminds me a little of a cabernet). Consistency fell somewhere between light- and medium bodied, but effervescence helped round out the mouthfeel nicely, and finish was fairly clean with just a touch of sourness lingering. Drinkability was fair. Not my favorite offering from JP, but not bad; however, just not that much going on with this one."
"The low ABV aids drinkability but this is an expensive beer that goes down quick."
"Sorry all, but this beer is dreadful. I bought this a few weeks ago, tried it, and thought surely this was just a bad batch and I should try again. Well I bought another bottle over the weekend and the second time the beer is consistent with the first, so statistically it is very unlikely that I have two bad bottles. The taste is vinegar, really potent yeast, and just undrinkable. I'm getting nothing but really strong, pungent, astringent vinegar. Malt, caramel, warming notes, I don't detect anything of the sort. I liked the other Jolly Pumpkins I just don't know what in the world the brewmaster was trying to get at with this awful concoction. Down the drain it goes, it's just too bad I spent $12 to do it."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied and overly so. The body of this one clearly needs to be thicker. Carbonation is good and it has a nice crisp bite to it. Drinkability is pretty good. I'd be more inclined to drink more if it had a better taste. Overall, it's interesting and certainly worth a try. But, it's clearly a far cry from what it could've been."
"Pours slightly cloudy dark brown and red. An inch of thick foam settles to a persistent finger of head and nice clingy lace. The house yeast produces a fragrantly sour beer. The aroma is laced with orange, pepper, lemon, and light cocoa notes as well. The flavor is less exciting. Tart lemon and lime flavors are carried on a husky malt and cocoa bean base. These make for a slightly odd and thin combination. Pretty light in body as well, with abundant carbonation. Drinks easily, but isn't the most successful Jolly Pumpkin beer in my opinion."
"Drinkability is low for a Saison, and for a Wild Ale, it's still a bit below average. Just not that tasty. And I consider myself a big fan of Brett beers, and Saison's are my absolute favorite style. Stick to regular Bam, much better IMHO. On the plus side, the low ABV makes it easy to gulp down and move on!"
"Poured into a snifter. Bam Noire pours a deep, rich mahogany with a very effervescent tan head. Great head retention, with some good lacing. The aroma on this is intense. Very nice sweet/sour aroma. Some figs and plums as well. Lactic acid takes the lead. Very nice taste as well. The sours are very mellow. Nice malty flavors. Light hints of figs along with some fall fruits. Smooth and very mellow mouthfeel. Nice and clean. High carbonation level. As for its drinkability, I would always drink anything from Jolly Pumpkin, especially if you are into sours and Farmhouse style beers."
"D: This is a unique and complex beer, owing to the extremely earthy flavor and the sourness. The flavor is actually fairly mild though, and refreshing. It's quite drinkable due to the low alcohol content, but still a sipper for me because of the strangeness of the flavor. I'm kinda on the fence with this one. It's good enough to drink once, and an interesting taste experience, but it also kinda grew on me as I drank it. An interesting take on this style."
"Drinkability: Between the yeasty funk and the tartness, this is a very interesting beer. If you were in the mood you could easily drink these all night, and unlike most of the big beers we spend most of our time tasting, you might not end up on the floor."
"750ml bottle poured into a Duvel tulip glass. Pours a dark black black color with a large two finger light tan head that possesses great retention and lacing characteristics. The aroma is a little tart and acidic with some dark malt, cocoa, yeast and a touch of funkiness. The taste is tart with some malt, cocoa and yeast with a dry earthy finish. Overall, this is an interesting brew that is worth a try."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, tart, dry, light cocoa, vanilla, oak, and citrus."
"D: A nice beer from JP, great with a steak, its acidity cut through the gamey flavours and the dark malt complemented the roasted flavours of the meat. A beer I would have again, but $11.49 for a 750 is a little much, all and all, a good beer from Jolly Pumpkin."
"I like this one, as I said, as a contrast to some of the ""big"" beers I've been having, I could have a good session with this brew."
"There's some kind of cola, coffee smell in the nose and the taste. Can't quite put my finger on it, but it's definitely there. It's not jiving with me though. Taste is the aforementioned cola and coffee with a bunch of carbonation. Mouthfeel is medium and non-cloying. I'm a huge Jolly Pumpkin fan, but this is by far my least favorite of their offerings."
"D - 4.3%, oh yeah. Not necessarily a session, but damn near"
"Large bottle, ""Batch 255", pours dark plummy dark tan head, initially huge, then fairly quickly down to islands and wildly lacing the glass. Just some slight cola and hints of earthy horse infused funk in the nose. I have a hard time getting a good take on these Jolly P beers. I dont drink em that often and when I do they always seem somehow hard to figure out. Have they gone south in the bottle or are they supposed to be slightly over carbonated, then somewhat thin taste wise and then wild and funky? Anyway, I'll go with the wild and funky thing here, as this one seems fresh and in good shape. Notes of more cola, wood, tang, slight barnyard funkyness, moderatly sour, with just light malts and minor to no hops. Interesting, lively and active brew, its alive and vibrant in the mouth. Give this one a try if you like some sourness and are able to find a bottle or two in you area."
"This is slightly disappointing for a Jolly Pumpkin, pales in comparison to a god of a beer like their La Roja, but even though this maybe a Jolly Pumpkin low light it's none the less a pretty decent brew"
"D - This beer has an almost overwhelming amount of raw oak character, and that makes it a little hard to drink for me. This spice notes are nice and there is plenty of refreshing sourness, but the oak is rough around the edges (quite tannic and lacking any vanilla character) and there is not quite enough residual sweetness to balance everything out. In some ways this beer reminds me of Rodenbach, but it is not as subtle or complex; I would expect that with some additional aging it might compare more favorably."
"Pours a very dark brown that is clear with a sizeable creme head. Nose is like browned apples. Seems to switch to what smells like cooked plastic. Liked it at first...nooot diggin' the plastic so much. Flavor is deep and robust. A part of it almost seems like roasted game of some sort. The plastic tone kind of comes back, and I have to say it kills the experience a bit. There is just something lacking...something out of line. Feel has a very full carbonation and the liquid is about standard. I personally like the Bam Bière better as it is one of my favorite American produced saisons."
"D - The burnt flavor ruins this one's long term drinkability for me. I like the beer, but I think it'd be so much better if it was just a bit mellowed."
"I've only had two beers in this category so far. But it's my favorite in the category! I have tried quite a few Jolly Pumpkins and loved them all, this was the first one I have had from them that I am impartial to. It is completely unique. A variety of strong smells, and a complete lack of traditional taste. I tasted nothing sweet in this beer at all. A very weird experience!! Probably the most unique beer I've had to date, but overall it's just too far out there for me. But I have mad respect!"
"I usually love me some Jolly Pumpkin, and I've had all of them now but the reserve beers. This one, though, just underwhelmed me. Tasted kinda watery and without enough funk to make it interesting. Oh well. Poured chestnut colored with little head. Aromas are thin and lightly sour. The taste is likewise, thin, lightly sour, clean and light, and has some light malt as well. Mouthfeel is relatively thin. If it had a bit more oomph it would be a lot better. The flavors are okay, they just need to be pushed more in the same direction."
"This one poured with a short, tan cap covering the hazy, deep reddish brown beer. The foam was really sticky with good head retention, and very slowly thinned to a thick ring and skim of fine bubbles. The aroma had the funkyness I associate with JP - a bit of barnyard and light vinegar, with an earthy and bready center. There was a very quick, sharp bitterness up front with mild sweetness at the rear and a bit of lingering, grassy bitterness and a hint of chocolate. There were also notes of leather, earthiness, acidic vinegar, and some fruitiness throughout. Medium/light bodied with generous carbonation, it stayed fairly crisp and was on the dry side. Definitely on the mouthwatering side. I enjoyed it and it was a tasty brew, but I think I liked the regular bam biere a little better."
"Don't think this is a brew I would return to again, doesn't fit in with the ones that please me most, just for drinking, but I find it recommendable. Tastes good, drinks well...try one with friends and food!"
"Drinks alright, bot a huge fan of this style, but spot-on technically. If you like em sour & just a bit funky, then this will please you. I like my Saisons with more malt"
"Here is my wife's review: ""first, I felt bitterness on the back of my tongue. then this nasty funkiness, like a dog that hadn't taken a bath for a while. ooooh...it was awful."""
" Overall a good beer, could be more sour, good intro to funky beers, good balance, not too much of any one area."
"Pours pure black, until held up to the light, when you see it is actually a muddy dark brown, with some significant haze. Aroma is dark fruits, with the musty, earthiness you expect from a saison or farmhouse ale, only this one is dark. The is also some tartness in the background of the aroma. Flavor is tart, musty and fruity, with very little malt. Some hop character, but subdued. Finish is complex, with a tartness and some fruit and must. A black saison, very interesting change of pace."
"Sampled at the Odds and Ends Tasting II on 10/19/07: Hazy dark amber color with a medium tan head that dissipates steadily. Stringy lacing. Aroma of tart fruit, cobwebs and yeast. Light-bodied and effervescent with flavors of dark fruit, straw and peppery spices. The finish is tart and short with a spicy aftertaste. Above average overall."
"Thanks to kryptic for the chance to try this!"
"Bottle courtesy of jjpm74: Poured a clear dark black color ale with a big foamy head with perfect retention and perfect lacing. Aroma of dry hops with loads of Brett is really enjoyable and classic Jolly Pumpkins. Taste is also dominated by some nice Brett flavours with some light sweetness and huge Belgian malt. Body is above average with some great carbonation. Complex beer with some nice controls of the funky aromas."
"Overall this was actually my first offering from Jolly Pumpkin and it will be no means be my last. This was simply too unique and too good to pass up. I would love to have this in the fridge to hit whenever. It was in a word, great!"
"Pours a deep mahogany color that's quite dark in the center, topped by a long-lasting coffee-foam head. The aroma is heavy on the wild yeasts and gives off a tons of earthy (and even some fecund marine) smells). Underneath the sweat and salt and rot is a light toasty malt backing with just a touch of spent coffee grounds. Wonderful aroma. On the palate, hop bitterness up front, with a tart backing that grows into the mid-palate. Toward the end a slightly sweet and smooth nutty malt character comes out. Very interesting tastes here. Overall, this is a really interesting beer. It's an odd category for a beer -- a dark farmhouse ale -- but the results are, at the same time, expected and unique. Very cool."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: As mentioned before if finishes dry, leaving a woody and earthy taste in the mouth. And when I say earthy here, I mean it, this is the epitome of earthy in edible food, besides licking a rock or eating a handful of dirt or mulch you can't get closer than this. It may sound gross, but I find this beer to be quite tasty. Very refreshing, a nice departure from most beer styles. I wouldn't hesitate to grab another. This beer would be easy to session, and I can see it pairing real nicely with smoked pork, smoked chicken, maybe a salad, some steak. Also a nice session beer."
"Dark brown with ruby highlight, a fingers worth of beige, fine bubbled head that fades but still leaves a sticky crown. Sour cherry fruit and some yeasty funk, and slight earthy malt for aromas. Very dry grains, chalky bitterness and an astringent yeast character. The farmhouse funk is bit one dimensional. Some vinous, cherry notes through the middle and settles in the finish with a bit of musty, husky grains and bitter, dry cocoa powder. Descent mouthfeel thats well carbonated and not too watery for a 4.3. Not bad for a dark saison, Ive got mixed emotions on this one. Its an easy drinker right now but I would like to see something bigger for this style."
"D - I was hoping for a nice take on Bam Biere and it ended up just being interesting."
"This is good if you're up for something tart and fruity. Not as good as Bam Biere, which is one of the best funk-gateway beers I can think of. Probably not the best of the Jolly Pumpkin line, but not out-of-character for them either. Nice to be able to sit with a big bottle like this and not feel completely dizzy when it's gone. Still, I probably wouldn't visit it more than occasionally."
"D- The wild characteristics and the hops really work together nicely to contrast each other even though the tartness is still much stronger. Nice twist to the original bam. I think age could really do some interesting things to this beer."
"Light body, lots of carbonation. I wasn't sure what to make of this. Probably my least favorite so far from JP."
"Ahhh, now this is a beer I could get used to. I could make a heck of a session out of this guy. It combines the best aspects of a saison and a porter with any conflicts that might arise being dealt with by enough funk that you can't notice any problems."
"Pours a deep amber/ mohogany color, with an off white/ tan head. Aromas of a roasty malt and sour hints. In hte taste, roasty malt and a suttle tartness. A tart and bitter mouthfeel and a small dry, sourness in the aftertaste. A good stepping off for sour beers, because it was not that sour. Different with the roasty malt."
"I like Bam Biere. My hope was that Bam Noire would be its delicious doppelganger, but for all the reasons noted above, it isn't. Nevertheless, I will continue to buy and try Jolly Pumpkin beer because one never knows when greatness will appear out the chaos. Continuing to Brett the living shit out of each and every style isn't going to get it done, though."
"Overall, a nice easy drinking and refreshing beer. I'd make it a regular if it wasn't so expensive ($14.50 a six pack)."
"Eric"
"Mouthfeel is not completely thin, but less than medium-bodied. The carbonation saves it. It feels a bit like a rustic homebrew at times. I'm working on a 750 solo, and i've finished a Madrugada before, but this is a distant relation to the supreme drinkability of Bam Biére."
"D- A really delicious and quite complex beer. A wonderful beer to sip and analyze."
"Overall: This is the first Jolly Pumpkin beer I'm really disappointed with. I didn't even finish the $10.00 bottle. The aroma was the best part but everything else was a let down. I'm not a huge fan of the regular Bam Bier either, so I guess this isn't a huge surprise for me, but none the less I'm a little dissapointed."
"Pours a dark brown with an off white head that faded quickly, but left some lacing. The smell is interesting, and one that I have never experienced before. It has a sweet and sour smell with aromas that I am unable to pinpoint, it is just quite odd. The Jolly Pumpkin website says that the aromas is of ""worn leather and cool autumn nights. Notes of sweet plum and toasted raisin, hints of coffee and cacao."" I cannot pick up those aromas, but this is different than most other selections out there. The taste has that toasted raising coming out immediately with a few sour notes following. The toasted flavor lingers at the end. The mouthfeel is good, very smooth. I couldn't see having more than a couple of these in one sitting, I would consider this more of a slow drinker. Worth checking out, different but interesting."
"**Confirmed from Buckeyenation, this beer causes headaches!"
"Appears a dark plum ruby amber hue with yeast sediments floating abroad streaming upward from the bottom with the bubbles from the fine carbonation, forms a nice sized light beige head with dimples from the stream that I poured into my glass. Aroma has tart raisins with green apples flowing with tobacco leaf qualities galore as I dig deeper it's more of the same with some cider and mild vinegar tones. Flavor brings dry dark chocolate edges with soft fruity sweetness rounding out the dry tart edges, herbal qualities from the hopping flows freely and comes out very notably here. Body is medium with very nice spritzy fine carbonation that carries the body much lighter than it actually is, much like a farmhouse schwarzbier really flows well on the palate. Really leaves a dry palate with each sip, due to the tart sourness this beer contains each sip really leaves nothing in the finish besides a dry puckering effect. Drinkability overall is great and purchased a couple standard Bam's to compare this variation side by side, I love Jolly Pumpkin this dark version a farmhouse ale is no different quality and the little doggy is sporting bat wings I guess it's the right time of year for it."
"This is not quite black in color except in the middle. The edges are dark reddish brown and so is the beer if you hold it to the light. Tart smell interestingly, light body and mouthfeel. I like the smell! Slightly sour taste that is still complex and very similar to bam biere. After a second bottle I liked it a lot more, nice tart, tomato-ketchup-acid taste. Why is that a good thing???"
"Overall impression: Nice beer - but I much prefer the Bam Biere. Still highly drinkable, and different from anything else available in six packs."
"12 oz bottle in St. Bernardus o.s. wine glass."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a reddish brown color with an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both very good. It smells like dark fruit, farmhouse funk, spice (pepper), overall it has a fruity/spicy aroma. Taste is similar to the aroma, with a nice tart, tangy dryness. Mouthfeel is light/medium, with a lot of carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's easy to drink and very sessionable. It's not too often I can find a beer with such a low ABV (4.3%) that has this much flavor to it. When I bought it I was expecting it to be stronger, I was surprised at the low ABV. I think this is a good beer, I'd definitely recommend it to others."
"Thanks to northernbrews for the trade. 12oz bottle. Cloudy orange/brown color with a medium head. Fairly good retention and lacing. Aroma of wood, bretty funk, cherries and plums. Tangy, fruity taste with a bit of peppery spice. Texture is tangy and a bit thin."
"Taste is raw and sour. Fluffy carbonation helps this musky, spicy brew go down. There is an acidic, twangy aftertaste. Almost a vinegar note. Mouthfeel is a little thin. This could use a year or so to mellow a bit. With the right food this could go down easily."
"Caramel brown. Brett and barrel aromas open a wedge of cured mint, pepper, pastrami, muscat, cocoa and vanilla. (A dim recall of 20 year-old Barbe Rac or 30 year-old village Barolo). A tall topping receeds in a pattern that looks like minature sandy white ski moguls. At approximately 60 degrees F the acids are sweet and dominant. Bitterness of the dusty, moist concrete variety is easy to recognize as well. Bright fresh red and green apple fruit, damson, sour cherry, mustard and over-spiced applesauce flavors. Potentially perfect in the right context. Quite chuggable for such a complicated beer."
"Pours a muddy dark shoe leather brown with copper edges. Small, ringy, off-khaki head doesn't last too long. Sour funk aroma takes center stage, with notes of tart raspberries/cherries, scorched caramel, tobacco, and roasted malt. Interesting. Not getting too much baby poo funk like some have mentioned. Taste follows suit. Tart citrus and acidic sour cherries up front. Has a toasted/roasted edge, though, which makes for a weird/unique combination. Sour stays throughout, with subtle barnyard notes. Scorched caramel and roasted malt come through near the dry finish. Moderate body with a somewhat lively mouthfeel. Refreshing and with the low abv goes down easy. Nice work Ron!"
"The flavor of this beer is really quite complex (funk, sour, dark malt & fruit), but in the end I can't quite get past the fresh newborn-baby poo. This was bound to happen with Jolly Pumpkin's brewing methods, and is even somewhat expected. Hopefully not all of the bottles of this brew are this funky (perhaps open fermentation in the warmer months would be the culprit). I'll definitely seek out some more bottles of this, and if those are not significantly improved, perhaps the next batch would be much better. This is a beer I really want to work, as a darker example at the quality level of the regular Bam would be truly incredible."
"Overall: Another excellent beer from the RBC."
