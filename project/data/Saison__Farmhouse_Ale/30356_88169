4.1,1.7,4,4,4.25,4,4,"Poured from a bottle into a schooner, the beer is a slightly hazy, yellow-straw coloring with a fizzy, filmy, surface coating of head. Aromas of toasted grains, lemon zest, dill, basil, jasmine, tangerine, cut grass, and subtle pepper spice. Flavors are a little more hop forward, with a bit of cedar, grassy notes, and a citrus blend of tangerine and lime. The spice blend is there, too, to layer the palate. Light bready backbone, almost like a pie crust, with some lemon notes coming forward at the end of the palate. The body is full, but light in mouth, with a citrus and herbal balance in the aftertaste. The finish is light, smooth, and slightly effervesced. Extremely drinkable beer.","GarthDanielson","Mar 20, 2015"

Head retention and lacing are both decent enough.  The brew smells like bready malt, peppery spice, citrus, melon and a bit of earthy floralness.  It tastes like melon, bananas, bready/grainy malt, honey, peppery spice and some white grape/wine.  Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit creamy with moderate carbonation.  I think this is an OK brew overall and I won't have any problems finishing the 4-pack, but it's not one of the better Prairie ales I've tried.  The longer I drank this, the less I liked it.  Still, it's worth picking up if you've never had it before.","bluejacket74","Jan 28, 2015"

Flavor gets things working more in harmony; the peppery yeast is still at the forefront, but a nice cereal maltiness starts to smooth it out before a light lime and melon finish.  Fairly light and zesty, leaving the mouth dry.  Definitely has the drinkability nailed down.

Aroma is a bit wacky farmhouse. First thing that comes to mind is an unidentified stinky fruit that is somewhere between tropical and fig and bergamot. A little wine-like, slightly phenolic, certainly floral, with maybe honey, and an interesting array of spicy yeasty aromas. Taste follows right along the same lines. White wine nuances, slight tart bitterness, rooty veggies, a shroomy earthiness, spicy hop, and wild flowers or potpourri. Mouthfeel is smooth, evenly and finely carbonated, approaching dryness, and somewhat fluffy in texture. Overall an enjoyably farmy, earthy, and fairly unusual saison.","tastybeer","Jan 27, 2015"

Grainy with a clean pils malt character, fruity with a blend of lemon and some tropical fruit, wild without Brett in that there's an earthy, yeasty funk, hoppy with a clean bitterness and phenolic with a blend of saison yeast and spices. The palate is well-represented on the nose, is light in body and crisply carbonated. Brilliantly focused and structured, this can give Upright's Five a run for its money in the hoppy saison category. Excellent stuff.","DefenCorps","Jan 02, 2015"

I had some of their beers last year when I visited him, and was very pleased to find their version of a farmhouse ale in the box he sent me.  On the first pour it is golden in color, with a full white head, nice carbonation and great lacing thru the quaff.  The aroma is of fresh sweet pickles, and on the first sip you can taste the complex blending of sweet and sour, with a mild hop bitterness and a refreshing finish.  The last pour of the beer is totally different in color - totally cloudy, almost opaque, with sediment; but the taste didn't vary - still deeelicous! And I love their labels and the bottle cap featuring the catfish.","rorjets","Dec 22, 2014"

I have to say that the lime-like characteristic isn't something I'm used to coming across in beer, so it definitely has unique points going in its favor. Not sure if it's release is seasonal, but I will probably pick up a 4-pack whenever I see it on shelves, which so far has been rather infrequently.","LambicPentameter","Apr 02, 2014"

With one smell, I had an idea that I was working with a saison. The aroma has lemon peel, vague spice, a moderate farmhouse stink so common of the style. Regarding its taste, it's a somewhat sour flavor overall which doesn't really get funky. Slightly tart lemons, a kick of grass, and vague citrus make the flavor. With its drying and spiced finish, this beer was a pleasant pairing with a home grilled steak.","DoubleJ","Mar 01, 2014"

Pours moderately hazy bright golden amber color with a 2-3 finger foamy and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big lemon zest, lime, peach, pear, apple, floral, grass, clove, pepper, wheat, bread, light honey, herbal, light funk, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity and balance of hop, malt, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of big lemon zest, pear, apple, lime, clove, pepper, wheat, bread, grass, floral, herbal, light funk, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of lemon zest, lime, pear, apple, wheat, clove, pepper, bread, grass, floral, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of malt, hop, and yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/spiciness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent hoppy saison! All around great complexity and balance of hop, malt, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 14, 2013"

The smell is spicy and herbal. Very interesting on the nose. The taste of the beer is also a little on the spicy side some earthy grain and a dryness in the finish. The mouthfeel is well carbonated and light bodied. Overall it's a pretty good Saison, would enjoy trying their other beers.","Knapp85","Apr 14, 2013"

Aroma is apple/pear cider, earthy and mineral-ish flavors and a grassy hoppiness. There's a little spice of spice in the mix, possibly from the hops. Some nice bready grain notes. It's nice just a bit weak, and that apple cider flavor dominates. Mild funk. The taste is an improvement for me. On the palate, it's a pleasant, mildly sweet saison with a light spicy hoppiness. Quite refreshing. Dries out in the finish. Bright malt flavor and a spicy, floral hop bitterness. More funk. Very nice beer. Pretty gentle carbonation for the style. Light mouthfeel. Very easy to drink. Another very good beer from Prairie. I preferred Prairie Hop and Prarie Ale, but this is an impressive beer to see in 12 ounce packs. I look forward to more from the brewery.","popery","Mar 15, 2013"

Small streaks and dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, pepper, lime juice, and citrus zest. Taste is much the same with peppery and chalky flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of citrus zest bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.
