"Pours orange/amber with hints of gold.  Head in bubbly and off white and faded quickly into faint wisps and a pencil thin collar.  Aroma is heavy on the Brett funk, with grass, floral hops, and lightly bready malt sweetness.  I also get some orange zest.  Taste is again with the brett funk up front, some citrus zestiness, very faint watermelon and fairly floral.  There's a nice deep oakiness that works behind everything; but holds it's own.  Light body, tart and bright on the tongue.  Bubbly med-high carbonation."

"A nice beer and quite complex. Love the brett, love the wind barell complexity, and like the spicing.  The nose and taste are both complex and deep. My only qualm is with the finish, which has a lingering bitterness that cuts against the integrated harmony of the rest of the beer. Not a huge deal, but enough to keep me from elevating this beer into the heights of the pantheon."

"Pours a mostly clear red-tinted darker orange with dense but thin white head; Rorschach lacing. Smell: citrus peel, moldy overripe peaches, floral, musty, with grape skin and red wine vinegar notes. Taste: moderately acidic with big flavors... herbal and woody, bitter orange; beneath some sweet and sour fruit balance... unripe peach, melon note, sugared dried mango.  Some snappy grain character quickly overwhelmed by red wine grapes and pepper. Interesting composition, with all of the components dialed up and dialed in. Really nice."
"Bottle from Tipples, corked and caged. Poured to my tulip hazy orange with lots of. Unless and a big creamy white to off white head. Huge Brett aroma, orange peels, lots of floral and peppery notes, barnyard funky and dry. Not a lot of wine on the nose. Flavor is sweet mango intermingled with rose hips, citrus, funk, and light peppery spice. Lightly tart from the Brett, full bodied with a vinous red wine heaviness, but strong carbonation. Wow. This might be the best Brett beer I've ever had. The big juiciness of the beer balances out the dry funky Brett outstandingly."

"anchorage has to have one of the best beer portfolios out there. they are all so clever and well made, and so unique too. love buzz is a real treat for me. the peppercorns are there in the nose, and blend in seamlessly with the spice of the saison yeast in the taste. the orange peel does the same thing with the citra hops, marrying equally and synergistic to the max, with the orange adding some bitter just like the hops do, and the hops adding the citrus thing to the nose. the yeast complexion is amazing, mouthwatering, its dry but wet too, its bretty and funky and odd, but still farmy and familiar, like a nap in a hay loft. hard to tell if its the red wine barrel or the rose hip giving it a perfume floral thing before the finish, but the cherry notes of the wine barrel bring it back to earth. oak and funk, fruity and dry, its as complex as any beer out there, and just as well made too. i love all of the anchorage beers, but this one may well be my favorite. what an extraordinary specimen. Pinot noir barreling as obvious here as it is anywhere, and this ages with the best of them"
""
""
""
"Very effervescent, medium light body."
"Well, no surprise. As to be expected from Anchorage Brewing Company, the brewing recipe is incredibly fancy and uppity-sounding (I say, I do fancy an artisanal ale brewed with Hobbs family Rose hips and aged in French oak pinot noir barrels *snobbishly raises monocle*), and the beer tastes... refined, yes. But also just damn good, to put it simply."
""
""
""
""
"O: I've had this before and remember it being very pleasant. A good beer I'd say try and find fresh. I've had it sitting a couple of months on the shelf and it decayed quite a bit. A very nice saison with good character."
"wow this bad boy is fantastic, batch 3. This gives hf a run for their saison money. if i had to guess this is what Ann probably taste like, damn near perfection. Everything comes up really well, pepper is real nice and not overly done. amazing beer, and much easier to get than hf wine barrelled saisons by a long shot. try this beer!!!"

"Anchorage hit it out of the park with Love Buzz. The nose is flat out amazing! There is layer upon layer of delicious fruit, funk, barrel, rose hips, and more. It's an all around great beer. I need to find more bottles of this as soon as possible. If you find any of these bottles around buy them all."
""
""
"Overall, this is an amazing brew as you can expect from Gabe. Really freakin awesome!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Despite a fairly underwhelming hue and carbonation, this is a well balanced sour ale. The nose is fine blend of barnyard funk and fresh hops - a little different than the usual saison. The wild yeast comes through again on back of the tongue and is joined by light fruit - raspberries perhaps? The finish is dry yet lingers."

"Overall: I wish I could buy this stuff anywhere. Really a very very nice beer. Not much to complain about at all. Heck my roommate, who is not much of a beer guy, was disappointed to hear I wouldn't be able to get this again easily."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"- Overall a solid beer. The fruit sour and floral saison characteristics add complexity to this beer, but also make it sort of muddled, especially with the bitter hopped finish. I would prefer a stronger sour fruit tartness profile."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: There was one bottle of this left on the shelf and I may have to go back and get it. I would love to have tried this brew fresh as well too. Outstanding complexity and a truly interesting drinking experience."

"750ml bottle that I shared with my friend, Keelan. These Anchorage beers aren’t cheap but if the rest are like this one, I am up for moer. Orange-yellow color, small but visible head and a bit of lace. The nose is really incredible in how intriguing it is. I knew right away I liked it but I just have to keep inhaling away to try and figure out what I smell. This beer sets the standard for complex aromas. Its sort of perfume, candy, a touch of brett hiding in the back, slightly earthy, slight touch of alcohol. After reading the bottle it came to me. It's the rose hips. The taste is pretty damn crazy too, funky with sweet, sour, and bitter all in equal portions. Unique. Surprisingly pleasant. This one is fit for a very special occasion."
"O- Fantastic beer and age has really allowed the Brett to develop into something nice, but I think any further and the light wine notes that are still present may no longer linger. Drink Up!"
""
"Overall a beer you want on a summer evening and would buy again"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Delicious and extremely refreshing. Orange peel and citra hops are a great combination."
""
"O - a very enjoyable Saison. Complex flavor and aroma. Smooth 8%. Subtle, but enticing and far from bland."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Atmosphere is pretty good. Nice hue, decent head, but no real lacing. Nose is wheaty, and grainy, and fruity. Light and wheaty with lots of fermented raspberry. Bitter and acidic with something of an off-putting final step. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a sampler snifter, the saison was a golden orange color with a slight white head with huge bubbles. The aroma was anything but subtle with a peppery and Earthy aroma. On even gets notes of orange in the aroma. In the initial taste, one detects notes of mango, pineapple, tart apples, a hint of sour candy, and the barnyard funk that is emblematic of the style. As the taste evolves into a dry tart apple taste the aftertaste. The mouthfeel proves to be smooth and perhaps a little sticky. One may find his/herself wishing the taste would linger a little longer. If the staying power disappoints, just buy another bottle. This is really good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Unlike anything I've ever had before. They somehow created the perfect balance of Brett, hops, fruit and wine barrel. I never got any peppercorn out of it but I'm sure it contributed in some way I just didn't detect. A stellar saison that I will jump at the chance to purchase again."
""
""
""
""
""
"A wonderfully crafted beer. Hoppy Saison? Wild Ale? Not sure what I would characterize this as, but it's delicious. If the aroma matched the flavor it would be among my top beers, but very good nonetheless."
""
""
""
"This is up there with Boulevard's Saison Brett among my top saisons ever. I'm blown away, and I really hope they make this again. If only the taste had a little more to it..."
""
""
""
"I have a bomber of this and I have no idea how I'm going to finish. It's completely obnoxious. I'm hoping the relatively high ABV will dull my senses soon."
""
"Overall, terrific. Rich and enveloping and unique. A very tasty beer."
""
"D: read the comments above, certainly different than your typical saison, but the complexities make for a very unique brew. certainly a costly bottle of beer, but it was fun drinking it."
""
""
"Overall- Perfect beer for one of the first warm spring nights. Definitely look forward to trying more of Anchorage's beers, they nailed this one."
"Overall, this is a very satisfying beer. It seems to get better as I drink it."

"Apricot ale with a sheet of loose knit light foam. Smells of elderflower initially, pepper, lemon, seltzer, some grain and some clay; just a touch of musty trub. Lightly tart, quite bitter, medicinal, some bitter orange peel, a little bit of tart and the aftertaste is really grassy and filthy to me. Medium bodied on full with low carb and dry finish. A little too bitter and overly mutilated by the Brett for me. Nose is really satisfying, but the flavor doesn't do it for me."
"Bottle: Poured a bright golden color ale with a large white foamy head with great retention and some lacing. Aroma of Brett is dominant with some notes of rustic malt and some citrus notes and some vinous notes as well. Taste is a complex mix between some Brett notes with a dry aftertaste mix in with citrusy hoppy notes and some vinous notes which work very well altogether. Body is about average with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Again lots of flavour that are very well balanced. My only complaint and it is a minor one ifs with the amount of Brett used in every of their beers they tend to have a similar taste profile."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall an excellent take on saison. While not really a sour beer, the Brett gives it some of those distinct sour characteristics without overwhelming the palate. I might recommend this as a way for those who don't ""get"" sours to try so they can taste and understand some the components of that type of beer. But ultimately, this is a saison, and a delicious one."
""
""
""
""
"This was amazing! It was complex and absolutely delicious. Rarely can I say this, but it was as if each sip had a new flavor. There were so many subtleties and nuances that I couldn't even wrap my palate around all of them. On top of all that, it was refreshing and very easy to drink. I can't say enough good things about this beer. It's definitely worth a try."
"O: A nice beer. Light and fresh, this one would be better during the warmer months, but still a very nice beer."
""
""
""
"O: I really like what the oak and Pinot Noir do to this beer, but I think it overwhelms the beer a bit, especially with the Brett funk. I could use a bit more traditional Saison flavors in this one, but it's quite nice nonetheless. Well above average."
""
""
"O: this was my first offering by Anchorage, and I must say that I'm pretty impressed with this brew. drinkability is rather high, complexity is nice and the balance is great."
""
" Going back for more of this for sure. Bravo!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"After a few years this has very much the same flavour components as before but the creaminess adds such a succulent component I've had nothing like it.  Yes, 5's around as no one, IMHO, can even match this.  Let me know if I'm wrong.  Best---bar none!"
""
""
""
"Love Buzz is hands down the best saison this guy's ever had. (not a big saison fan). Opened a bomber at a tasting (thanks jacoby). pours murky yellow with a little white head. The pinot noir is balanced perfectly with the rest of the flavors. Kudos to anchorage brewing for a great beer!"
""
""
"Overall. Wow!! This one caught me by surprise. Very delicious and a smell that just blew me away. Highly recomended!!!"
""
"O: I was really impressed by this beer, I had heard good things but wow this is really up there with the best I've ever had. The flavor is traditional saison with lots of depth and added flavors and feel that all complement each other well. I really can't say enough about how well crafted this is buy it if you see it worth every drop Anchorage is really moving up the charts with each beer i try in my book ."

"Pretty darn tasty and complex. I think their Galaxy White IPA is still my favorite but this one came close to topping it."
""
""
"O: What can I say other than what I’ve already said: “incredible?” This is one of those beers you try once and think about for years afterward. It’s fresh fruit in the nose and sweet/sour heaven in the palate, a combination that I’ve never experienced before and I doubt I will ever find again. Truly one of the best beers I’ve ever had."
""
""
""
"Quite complex."
"M - Light to medium body. Dry. Slightly sticky. Light carbonation."
"Despite the flowery romance novel BS on the label, the beer is in fact pretty decent."
"Pours a cloudy orange with a large, fluffy, chunky head on top that eventually settles down to a lumpy covering. The aroma is fantastic...citrus peel and soft floral notes upfront, peppery spice, juicy and slightly grassy hops, yeast esters, and a lovely pale malt base. Juicy citrus and tart fruit sticks to the tip of the tongue and stays there. Here is where the Brett reveals itself, but it's not super funky. Lingering peppery bitterness, drying wood, flower petals, and earth. Some wine-like tannins perhaps, but the Pinot doesn't really come through in any significant way. Very dry and quite tart, yet soft and fluffy in the mouth. With the rose hips, peppercorns, orange peels, dry hopping, barrel aging, and wild yeast, this could be a total mess in other hands. This guy obviously knows what he's doing. Good stuff..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - I would session this in a second!"
""
" The saison tastes nicely of brett and fruity with a subtle citrus tanginess and white grape tartness from the barrel with mild pepper and lemony hop qualities w/ slight cracker taste of malt in the finish. Overall a pretty top notch example of a brett saison with nice spice and hop flavor with the additon of a white wine elment from the barrel augmentation."
""
""
"Overall: The beer is so awesome! What a complex saison! The citra hops are amplified by the orange peel and love that about this beer. Geez its that frickn good. This would be my second Anchorage beer and they just make beers with crazy complexity, and just are killing it with their brews!"
""
""
"Terrific beer and my first from Anchorage, I really can taste the bright orange peel and rose hips in this which leads to a bright and exciting saison. The brett, pinot barrels and citra all play a part as well and I will seek out their other brews."
"O - This is the third Archorage beer I've ever had, and I'd buy any of them again in a heart beat. Another excellent job pushing the boundaries of contemporary brewing."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a seriously great beer. It's 12/22 and I think I just found my favorite beer of 2012. Anchorage has got this brett and barrel thing down."
""
""
""
"O: I was hesitant to pick this up with the cost (14.99 for a 750) but I am very glad that I did. Amazing complexity and great drinkability make for a great drinking experience. Highly recommended"
"O- The light beer has a full flavor and complexity that is unique and really works together. None of the flavors are out of balance and it makes this beer really drinkable."
""
""
"Overwhelmingly fruity in the nose, Love Buzz begins with a massive bouquet of grapefruit and just a touch of tart funk as if anticipating to bite into the melon itself. The smell of citrus is delightfully simple and dominating. Immediately puckering on the palate, citrus and tartness follow. A bit peppery indeed but lacking the ""caramel beauty"" promised on the bottle. Simple, tart and perhaps better paired than alone, Love Buzz neither impresses nor disappoints. A solid offering but, overall, not memorable."
""
"750ml bottle $14.99. These Anchorage beers aren't cheap but I've had good experiences with Bitter Monk and Galaxy IPA so I'm becoming a believer. Orange-yellow color, small but visible head ans a bit of lace. The nose is really incredible in how intriguing it is. I knew right away I liked it but I just have to keep inhaling away to try and figure out what I smell. Its sort of perfume, candy, a touch of brett hiding in the back, slightly earthy, slight touch of alcohol. Great aroma. The taste is pretty damn crazy too, sort of sweet, dry, some orange, pretty good. I must say these Anchorage beers are quite unique and while they seem expensive at first they are actually priced less than Russian River and about equal to Jolly Pumpkin and I'd say the quality is not questionable. Can't wait for the next batch of Bitter Monk."
""
""
""
"Great barrel aged wild saison."
"Take one part IPA, one part saison and one part sour and here you go. Definitely an interesting and complex beer. Would like to try again after some aging."
""
"O- out of the three Anchorage beers I've had, this is my favorite. The beer is more subtle than most barrel-aged beers, and isn't overly funky, and it's very approachable"
"overall: cool beer - enjoyed this"
""
""
""
"There's an element of class and sophistication associated with the beer, yet still making it look easy. The beer simply comes together in the most majestic and whimsical way. But its power and punch to the palate won't be ignored."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is an awesomely fruity saison and definitely worth picking up a couple to set down and see how the brettanomyces plays out over the next couple of years."
""
""
"O: This beer was all over the place. The only think I missed was the Pinot. Maybe my palate was off today but I will re-visit and look for more Pinot. Excellent."
""
""
""
"Very skilfully done. The Brett and barrel treatment are used with restraint, which makes for impressively coherent complexity and great drinkability."
"Taste is more of the same with a flavor that continues to build as it sits on my tongue. Fruity and effervescent gives way to spices and funky complex yeast. Top notch with favor on top of flavor. Finishes with a spicy peppery dry bite. Great beer I would look forward to having more."
""
""
""
"One word: Potpourri."
""
"Overall: This beer was incredibly unique in the pairing of sour and saison attributes. I would get this all the time if it was a little cheaper, and available. Awesome."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This was a really impressive beer. Solid saison with barrel aging adding to it. Grapes, fruits, spices, citrus, delicious."
""
"The beer appears a hazy, golden orange color with over an inch of dense, white head. The aroma offers fruit, yeast, malt, floral notes. The flavor is interesting. Floral hops come through more in the flavor than the aroma. A bit thin in the body. Slightly sweet, with additional notes of rose hips. A pretty tasty saison."
""
""
"Pours a hazy amber with a ton of fluffy white head that laces wonderfully. All sorts of great aromas on the nose, including fruity brett, Mountain Dew, pepper. The body is dry and filled with brett character. More pepper and fruity notes along with a vinous quality. As time passes it is detracted by the building bitterness and a building yeast character. Regardless, an enjoyable beer. A fine beer to enjoy while watching the All-Star game."
"Overall this was a huge miss for me, flavor profile was all phenolic yeast and drying oak. Too much oak even for me and I love oak. I would have liked more of a fruity red wine presence and less of an oaky tannic assault. With how expensize these offering are from this brewery I am going to be much more cautious moving forward giving I only semi-enjoyed 1 of the 3 I have sampled so far."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is superb for a Saison: dry, light, astringent. Overall, this is a great beer. A great saison. Everything about this beer (apart from the standard appearance) is fantastic. It's a real brewing achievement, and one of the finest beers I've tasted this year."
"Bottle at the May 2012 iteration of the Santa Cruz tasting series. Opaque gold with a white head. Peachy aromas, tart summer fruit, apricots, funky with a bitter finish, light peppercorns, musty/oaky, white grapes, green hops, dry brett, lots of complexity."
""
"Overall: Found the flavor a bit tamer than the aroma. Sealed it and finished it the next day and found it had actually improved. A hit regardless."
""
"This beer almost made me cry, it was that good. After 1200+ reviews this has become the beer I want to settle down with in the country and somehow engineer a mutant beer-human hybrid family with. Despite Gilbert yapping away in my ear about gastronomic subjugation or some shit, I can't give it anything besides a perfect score."
""
"Overall this is a complex, interesting saison to pick apart. Enjoyed it. Not an everyday beer though."
"D - Very drinkable. The Brett adds a really nice funky layer to the Saison base that winds up nice and complex and balanced. Finish is really nice."
"O: Unpleasant and overly herbal."
""
""
"This is an easy drinking sour beer. Lots of flavor, but definitely a sipping beer."
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy, golden / copper color. 6/4 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sour, sweet malt, hint of yeast, hint of hop, hint of alcohol, and a hint of floral. Fits the style of a Saison / Farmhouse Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sour, sweet malt, alcohol, hint of hop, and a hint of floral flavors. On the wide scale of Saison flavors, this is very far from the floral/yeast/spice range. The sour dominates both aroma and body. This is more close to a Lambic, than most other Saisons I have tried."
"O: Overall nice dry tart barnyard funk and graininess. Dry spicing, smooth flavor that is polished and easy on the down, worthy of a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky honey orange with a 1 inch foamy off-white head that settles to a thin cap on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is slightly tart/sour and is of grain, spices, Brett, flowers, wood, and some mild wine aromas. Taste is of grain and Brett up front with flavors of spices, flowers, and wood coming through on the finish. There is a dry, tart, and slightly funky aftertaste as well. This beer has a nice crisp level of carbonation with a slightly medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is quite a complex and tasty saison. The Brett presence really shines in the aroma and flavor but doesn't overwhelm the other ingredients."
""
""
"This beer was something special. When I opened it and poured it into a large snifter a pretty decent foam appeared, although it disappeared after not so long. It looked clear and amber, with some red in it. But it was only the first glass which was clear, the deeper I got into the bottle the more turbid the liquid became, because the yeast was in the bottom of the bottle. I smelled it and the aromas of rose hips and some funk revealed itself. The first sips were wonderful, the rose hips were really prominent and some nice, fruity sweetness was there too. In the end a nice, rather special, bitterness took hold. The beer continued in the same elegant fashion. It had juice-like qualities and some real freshness to it. The brett is there and provides dryness in the aftertaste and some subtle sourness, and also some funny flavors once in a while. The mouthfel was light and the beer was easy drinking. Drank a whole 750 ml for myself, never feeling it was too much. Overall, a beer different than the rest, it was more alive and kicking than most other Saisons."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Exceptional! Very refreshing and very dry. Healthy doses of crisp lemony citrus, barnyard and hay. The wine and oak only adds to its complexity. Not as sour as I was hoping which was probably for the best. Phenomenal all around. I will be picking up more for sure."
""
""
""
""
"Try this beer!! Buy it. Then buy more. This is my first saison, and I am going to have more."
"Overall: Very, very unique beer like all of Anchorage's beers. I wish it was summer so I could fully appreciate how refreshing this beer is"
"O: A very nice beer, my first from Anchorage. Look forward to trying to the other ones at some point. The only problem really is the price, a little steep, but somewhat understandable."
"O - I really like this beer, just not the price of it. It makes you sit back and take notice but it's also easy to drink. I think it's a perfect beer for those looking to taste a little ""funk."""
"Got to work a trade for more of these..."
"This is a nice saison, even thought it's a bit different."
""
""
"O: I cant get enough of this style, especially when the brewer adds plenty of interesting things to it. This is easily on par with most of Jolly Pumpkins beers. Really cool beer that i'd been wanting to try."
""
"Impressive. Unique. Well worth seeking out, especially for fans of the style."
"Really an excellent Saison and worth seeking out although dropping $17 for a bottle of this seems a tad unreasonable. Recommended."
"Overall: too bad this is a limited release :("
""
""
""
"Nice beer, glad I picked it up; don't let the ""high"" price tag put you off..."
""
""
""
""
"8% is too high to be sessionable but this beer goes down super easy and is very enjoyable. Spicy, sweet, with a light, refreshing feel. Really good."
"Overall, an interesting beer. I like what the brett and the barrel add to it."
"Really delicious and unique ale, one of the most creative domestic examples of the style, up there with Jolly Pumpkin's Baudelaire iO...wow."
"O - Another phenomenal Anchorage beer, I want everything from them!"
"Poured orange with some browner highlights, huge white head leaving behind dense and sticky lacework and rocky retention. Nose is tart and funky, brett is quite prominent. Has quite a bit of that Jolly Pumpkin-esque sour nose where the sourness can be anticipated from the aroma. Rich vinous/barrel notes, lemons, green apple. Taste doesn't really provide the sourness I anticipated, but still offers sweet lemons, more brett, fantastic citrus/fruity notes (great hop profile here). A touch of green olive and oak. Good effervescence on the palte, more of a sweeter saison and doesn't really have that tart/puckering sensation that I had predicted based on the nose. Delicious and severly drinkable, alcohol is nowhere to be found. I would readily revisit this, great stuff."

""

"This beer poured out as a decent looking golden color with some orange hues to it. The head was thick and white. The smell of the beer was a little earthy with some spicy notes. The taste of the beer had the typical spicy Saison notes with some light earthy undertones. The mouthfeel was the beer was well carbonated and medium bodied. Overall this beer wasn't bad, I enjoyed it and would probably drink it again."

"Batch #1 August 2011. Poured from 750ml bottle into a tulip. A - Hazy orange with reddish highlights. Thick, frothy foam recedes relatively quickly to leave dense lacing. S - A blend of citrus and herbs and a nice floral component. Some of the brett is noticeable as well. Very complex. T - A peppery component up front, and citrus flavors throughout. Floral flavors come on last and it mixes with a somewhat bitter finish. Very nice mix of flavors. M - Medium body with a generous carbonation. They put a lot of love into this and it shows. Easily one of the best Saisons that I've had. Highly recommended."
"Overall: This is a really good saison. Complex and easy to drink, I would definitely have another."
"This was quite good. The Brett played a big part and worked well with the spiciness of that base Saison. That barrel flavor was only the icing on the cake. I think that the body on this really impressed me the most though, perfectly complimenting those flavors. This is another solid one from Anchorage."
"O: A really good beer that uses brett well in order to compliment the various spices in this saison farmhouse style beer."
"The body is light and full of carbonation. A good amount of complexity in the flavors. Anchorage is really hitting it out of the park. I can't wait to see more from these guys."
""
"and a few bad sips with off flavors did not help either"
"Despite this, it stays true to its roots—it provides perhaps the new wave in saison awesomeness; the next generation of a phenomenal style."
""
""
"Medium bodied with medium-low soft natural carbonation. Fairly light and creamy."
""
""
"Drinkability is pretty good, it's very fun to parse, but one for thinking, not slugging down. I'm really liking this, although the rose it a bit much, it gives it a potpourii flavor that is a bit fatiguing."
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. The alcohol is well hidden for 8%. A little more bitter than I'd like but just because it wasn't what I expected doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it. This concluded our mini tasting of 3 different Anchorge beers and I gotta say that across all 3 different offerings, these brews shared a vey familiar quality about them. I'm not sure if that is just the house character or if it's the repeated combination of Brett ad barrel aging across all 3. Regardless, they are worth checking out."
""
"O - A wonderful beer that I wish I could have way more often. I will get this any time I can (which is rarely)."

"Many thanks to Beenitty for the chance to taste this one. This dude always hooks me up with amazing beer! Popped and poured into my Boulevard stemware glass. Pours a murky orange color, frothy white head fills the glass, nice retention. Visible small bubble creep up the sides of the glass. Smell- Pinot Grapes, Orange peel, coriander, ginger, pineapple, tart bretty funk. This is a really complex aroma, a lot going on. Taste- on the first sip, as it hits the roof of my mouth, I get a funky blast of wet hay mingled with some sour orange/tropical fruit flavors. This is a very fruity and funky saison- the wine notes from the pinot are present as well. There is a cracked pepper note as well in there. This is a great saison. Incredibly unique and creative, the flavors are balanced and the brett delivers a nice funkiness as well. I'm super impressed with Anchorage Brewery, the last thing I had from them was Whiteout Wit, they really do brett beers well."

"Pours a hazy orange color with some hints of red to it and a massive white head. Smells quite floral, likely from the rose hips, but it’s got a bit of a hibiscus character to it, too. The wine comes through and gives a bit of sweet grape must aroma. Mild spice notes are also present. The flavor is highly floral and ""grapey"". A bit sweeter than imagined, but a touch of lemon peel type tartness. There is some oak to it and a bit of spice flavor as well. Medium bodied with medium to high carbonation."
"D: One of the best new beers I've had in a long time. Really diggin' this."
""
""
""
"D - Very impressed with both Anchorage beers I have had. Very complex with just the right amount of Brett."
""
""

"A sip is smooth and dry with flavors more subdued than the nose; still, nice spice and delicate tartness, citrus and subtle funk. Good carbonation - crisp with a smooth medium to lighter body. A bit of the wine-like alcohol presents itself at the finish. Really a nice sipping saison. The nose is brilliant."
""
""
"O: First I had Bitter Monk and I thought I had died and gone to heaven. Then I had Whiteout Wit and I thought it was one of the best witbiers I’ve ever had. Going into this beer I thought there is no way that a brewery could go three for three. I’d like to say that I was surprised but deep down I had a feeling this beer would also be amazing. Buy stock in this brewery, it’s my new favorite."
""
"Enjoyable. I like this one a lot, a little hoppier than I expected."
"Light feel with good carbonation. Really nice offering here. Glad to try this."
""
"This is impressive, a bit less in boldness and taste than the Bitter Monk, but I found this to be the more drinkable one out of the two. A whole bottle was child's play. Now I just need somebody to get a taste of the new wit, cause I ain't buying that one."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- a great barrel aged saison a little pricey but worth a try"
"I'm really impressed with this offering. Saisons are one of my favorite styles and this brings a lot to the plate. The barrel aging adds huge layers of complexity and dry hopping with citra goes a long way. This is a win."
""
"This is another nice beer from Anchorage but again, these (Philadelphia) prices just aren't worth it. That's not to say it's not a tasty beer because it is, but there's definitely more wallet-friendly options out there if you want a funky Saison. If I could find this a few bucks less each time, this would be one to cellar and revisit later for me."
"Pours a very hazy orange color with just a hint of amber. Scent is initially citrus fruit...orange and grapefruit with some pinot noir aromas. More of a wine scent than a beer. Very nice french oak aromas with some hoppiness and spicy aromas. Just a bit of Brett. Taste is initially spicy with pepper and lemon zest. Lovely french oak flavors with very noticeable Brett and barnyard flavors. The pinot noir is more noticeable as it warms. Quite a hoppy saison also. Finish spicy, bitter, and a little tart. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and very dry. Drinkability is very high, and the alcohol is very well-hidden. Overall, this is one fantastic saison. I absolutely love it. Need to get more to age."
"Medium bodied with above average carbonation. Easy to drink, and the alcohol is well disguised. This is a very nice Saison."
""
"Damn, this works so well, on so many levels. Between just this and Bitter Monk, I'm thinking Anchorage should win the award for best new brewer of 2011. No idea when they actually started up, but they've really got something to be proud of with their tiny handful of offerings. Hopefully they'll move into the stout/porter realm, would love to see what they can do on that side of the tracks."
""
""
""
""
"Yep, this is a good barrel aged Saison. I love what the Brett and wine barrels add. Highly recommended."
""
"O: I think this is a wonderful beer. I don't think it's quite as good as Boulevard's Saision-Brett, but it's still fantastic. I have a feeling I'll be buying a few more bottles over the next couple of months."
""
"750 ml bottle. Pours a hazy light amber with a one finger white head with good retention that leaves a moderate amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is some brett funk, a lot of grape and red wine, black pepper, and some apple. The initial taste is sweet with apple and apricot, then some red wine and barrel comes through with a peppery note, some brett, and some yeastiness. The finish is moderately dry. Medium body. Medium-high carbonation. An enjoyable saison. I would have preferred it to be slightly drier overall. It doesn't quite reach the height of their Bitter Monk, but still a good beer."
""
"O: This is a pretty good saison, but even independent of price, I've had better ones. Factor in price and this drops a notch lower in desirability. I was much more impressed by Bitter Monk."
"The Judgment - Very pleasant with a balance between hops, sour, and saison. The strong hops flavor is interesting in this saison and maybe if they were not as harsh this would be an excellent beer."
"Overall: Not impressed with this one at all, the yeast dominates everything and it is otherwise very one dimensional."
""
"D - A really nice Saison, but with less depth than Bitter Monk. Still it's ultimately a very enjoyable beer that I'd gladly drink again if it were a bit more affordable. These Anchorage beers have really developed a 'house' quality a la Jolly Pumpkin, even though I think Gabe is merely using a commercially available brett strain."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: There's no doubt that this is an absolute brett bomb, but the beer behind it stands up fairly well. Not sour really at all, just metallic from the brett. I wanted to like the taste of this a lot more than I did, to be honest, but the gorgeous scent alone is worth the price of admission."
""

"I am quite impressed with this take on a Saison. This is the second beer I've had from Anchorage Brewing Company that is brewed with Brett and aged in French oak wine barrels and they've both been phenomenal. These are very fresh, interesting flavors and I really appreciate them. Kudos, Anchorage!"
""
""
""
"O - This has really good drinkability. It goes down easy and the flavor is really nice. I could drink this all night. Overall, I think this is a really good beer, and a really good representation of the style. I recommend trying this one out. I would definitely buy this one again."
"Brett bomb with a good saison behind it. Good spices, fruity. Somewhat sweet in the finish. Only a little yeasty.Very generous head of foam. Very drinkable.Above average mouthfeel. A little funky aroma. Bottle from Bierkraft $21.46.Cork popped into the other side of a large room, suggesting above average carbonation."
"Poured a 2 1/2"" off-white head with a lasting merengue. Hazy raw sienna yellow colored body. Smells a little like pickle juice at first but there some malt too. Taste happily was only a touch sour and has more malt than the smell hinted as well as raisin from the grape brewing and some mild but quality hops. Finish is pretty long and yes bretty."
"Notes: Again, a bit pricey but for what it is, but for what it does, this feels worth it. Nice quality and complexity. Glad to see these brews around."
"3.5/4/4/4/4 .. but I should probably mark down the aroma and flavor... This is not a ""real"" saison by any stretch. Okay for American.... but still just a nice play from an emerging brewery."
"O: Hands down one of my favorite saisons. While it's not like a Fantome, the sour elements play with the malts just right. Awesome."
"Overall Impression- You could definitely hint at the Pinot Noir barrels that were used in this process but only in the nose. Had a ton of hop character for a Saison. Would love to enjoy this one again! Very interesting."
"Bitter Monk is still my favorite Anchorage Brewing beer, but so far they can do no wrong in my eyes. Buy this, seek it out even. This is the real deal."
"Cheers!"
"o - Overall a really nice saison from Anchorage; I really liked it. Some nice funk and brett especially in the nose, and floral hops in the taste. Would like to have it again."
"Pretty decent overall."
"Medium bodied but on the fuller end with a slight creamy texture that is countered by the funky/sour character. Lots of musty funk/dry brett flavor that melds with the saison/farmhouse yeast pretty well. Slightly puckering but more dry and funky than tart. Much more so than I expected resulting in a dryness that is exaggerated by the berrel notes. Dry toasted oak with a faint vinous red wine character that gives off hints of grape, strawberry and other dark fruits. Pretty complex but the funk/brett donates slightly overpowering the eatery fruit notes and Pinot noir elements. Pretty good with a well masked ABV but could use bit more balance. I'm glad I got to try this one and am looking forward to sampling more from this brewery."
"O: I think this is a really fantastic beer to be putting out as a batch 1 line from a new brewery. I understand that Gabe has been at it for a while (formerly @ midnight sun), however -- I think this will be a beer people will be looking for in a few years. I'd grab some batch 1 of this bad boy and revisit it at some tastings. I most certainly will grab a couple bottles, I think this one will blossom with an elegant floral sweetness like I've never had in a beer. This is like Saison Brett with plums/hibiscus. Really very good."
"O: a nice brew, interesting because it is sweetened up in the beginning and not extreme on the spices but overall nice, still think henepin beats this one out"
"Overall, it's an expensive ass beer--some $18.99 for the big corked/caged 750. It's cool, and I'm grateful it made it here from Alaska--picked it up from Tylers in Carboro--and I think I'd try it again...but I dont think I'd buy it again."
"jd"
"This is a really interesting and unique beer for sure. Glad to try it after really enjoying their Belgian IPA. Can't say that I loved this one, but I didn't hate it either. There should be no doubt, it is a quality beer, and about as complex as it gets, but some of the flavors don't seem to work to me. Worth the 15 or so dollars though as there is a lot to enjoy in here."
"Notes: Well, just like the Bitter Monk, this beer just tastes like brett. Sure it's not as bitter, not as citrus-y as Bitter Monk. But it just tastes like brett. The beer is gone. The label sounds like a great beer, but I don't see much of it in the beer."
"pours a glowing, hazy, pink-orange with a just off-white head that holds and leaves pretty lace. nose is citrusy hops, flowers, strawberries, grape must, lemon, lemon pepper and earth. not getting much wood, but like all of anchorage's other beers so far, everything is seeming very well integrated. taste is a mellow, balanced, harmonic expression of all of the above. big and bold, while remaining smooth and subtle. the rose hip/pepper spicing never gets bitter or weird, and the yeast's character matches well with everything else that is going on. very well integrated. medium body. fairly dry and quite round from all the fruitiness. just a touch of bretty funk in the middle and finish. another fantastic beer from anchorage."
"Very pleased with this. I don't have access to Boulevard, but I'm going to enjoy having easy access to this!"
"Overall: Nice stuff. Very enjoyable and the price can be stomached if the burden is shared."
"O - This beer is great. I've been impressed with the 2 brews I've had from Anchorage so far. Very good body and nice individual flavors that work well together."
"O- Another good showing from anchorage."
"O: Another great offering form Anchorage brewing. A bit outside the box but very well done."
"A very flavorful saison with good complexity."
"Goat cheese and saison combine in the flavor. Noticeable bitterness from the hops. Lemony cheesy bitter finish. Caramel backbone and slightly vinous."
"My first beer from this brewery and I'm looking forward to many more."
"Big thanks goes out to beermeX2 for sharing this one at the Down South Beer Tasting while aasher was in town to visit! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured a hazy light orange with a minimal white head. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, orange, spices, dark fruit, and wood. The flavor was of sweet malt, orange grape, dark fruit, and wood. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I am not usually a huge fan of the Saison style in general, but the addition of dark fruit in this one really won my heart. The component definitely added to the depth of the brew and blended quite well with the spices typically found in the style. A definite must try if you get the opportunity!"
"O: The beer is relatively easy to drink and the smell and taste captivates your nostrils and taste buds."
"O: Don't drink this too cold. To be honest, I was pretty meh about it when it just same out of the refrigerator. However, at nearly room temperature, it develops a little more body and sweetness that balances it out."
"A solid saison. A little too rosy on the nose as it warms, but the flavor profile is varied, interesting, and decently integrated."
"Beer is light in body and effervescent on the palate, the overall beer is dry on the finish, heavily carbonated on the palate, nice spice profile and great yeast profile, the funk dominated the front half of the palate. I'd have this beer again, I really enjoyed it."
"The nose brings forward loads of fruity Brett-induced funk. A bit of a tropical character is present plus some light red wine. The Brett takes the show. Faint tropical Citra notes there as well. The flavor isn't quite as integrated and is almost-completely dominated by the Brett. While the Brett character is quite nice, it's a bit one dimensional and I would have liked to get a bit more spice. As it warms further, some of the wine comes out, but still none of the other additions. Light-medium body with good carbonation and a very dry finish. Brett heavy. Good, but not fantastic."
"O: Not quite a classic saison, but definitely well made and flavorful."
"Overall this is just flat out fantastic. A home run. I can't say anymore the bottle was gone in less than ten minutes."
"I love it! Yet another top notch beer from the folks at Anchorage Brewing."
"O: Once again a very successful beer from Anchorage Brewing. I cant say it's the best beer of it's style with so many other worthy Saisons out there, but it's damned good. Beautifully balanced and deeply flavored, this beer is among the best. Drink it fresh if possible."
"Better than most Fantome beers."
"Very interesting beer... this is the sort of thing I could see Fantome making (which is high praise in my book)."
"O - This is a really good saison. I am impressed with my first brew from Anchorage."
"O - Saison - as it should be."
"Sweet and sour, acidic, tangy, fruity. You can pile on the adjectives. Pineapple and herbal tea. Beautiful long-lasting head on a cloudy golden brew. Quite aromatic and spicy in the nose. Gets more bitter as you sip."
"This bottle was sampled during the South Carolina tasting, It pours a nice cloudy dull Orange in color with a very soapy head that turned into a white lacing around my glass. It smells of fresh mangos and tangerines with little spice or wine influence but it smells spectacular. It instantly reminded me of Guava Grove. The flavors are somewhat chalky and very dry. I get some rose or hibiscus as well. The brett makes itself known. It drinks light, grainy, and dry. Overall its a solid saison and pretty good overall. It's a nice beer to share but I couldn't drink a whole one by myself."
"O: Anchorage Brewing, how I love thee. Winners popping up every time so far. I prefer to think of this as Bitter Monk Lite. It's not really a saison by the everyday definition but neither is the Monk a DIPA by the usual definition. A very good beer, but I'd take Bitter Monk instead next time. 4/5"
"Bottle (Batch #1, August 2011). Basic review: Pours with a hazy, deepish gold body with a large and lasting, fluffy off-white head. Great lace. Aromas amazingly good! Right off the bat: fresh tangerine/grapefruit juice. Good acidity, a little funk, red wine, tropical fruit hop notes, CITRA! Smells a little bit like Le Terroir with the hop and funk note. Sweet, perfume, floral, estery. Light bready malt. Very fragrant, pineapple. Amazing! Flavors are funky as well, juicy, oak, barrel, red wine, fruit, a bit grassy. A touch grainy, bready and straw like. Surprisingly bitter (both hop and tannin). Nice tropical fruit, grassy hop notes, rich, delicate, lots of nice tropical brett C esters. Lingering, slightly acidic stonefruit. Blown away, this is OUTSTANDING! Lively, playful carbonation, lingering funk, nice tannin, lightly warming, creamy bubbles. Balanced and complex. This might be one of my new favorite breweries, and one of the top 5 beers I've had so far this year."
"Overall is really good beer I will fro sure be trying again soon."
