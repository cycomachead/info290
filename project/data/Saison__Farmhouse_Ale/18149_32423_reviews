"A nice representation of a Flanders Red with out being to much of a Flanders Red."

"Fantastic saison with a fluffy head that collects like soft-serve vanilla ice cream. Great flavor and medium carbonation."

"O- Decent farmhouse ale. It's a catch-all category; despite the lack of funk or tartness, it's still a decent beer. Still, not worth what it costs per the usual Lost Abbey pricing range."

"The taste is crisp with a strong black pepper tongue. It starts with some creaminess but end bitterly in the swallow. Predictable body with an elevated level of carbonation. Overall, an impressively drinkable Saison."

"o. Overall this beer is very, very good. Do not usually like this style, but everything is well balanced. No coriander taste to the yeast."

"O: This beer is excellent. The only problem I had with it was the sweetness. I believe saisons should be drier, that's all. Will definitely try other beers from this brewery and perhaps get this one again."

"O: awesome saison available year round from LA, tbh I skip this over for other lost abbey beers, I think that will have to change as this is awesome saison and cheap compared to other la stuff"

"A fairly blusterous and straight-up solid saison. While heaviness isn't normally an attribute of the style, the weight here more or less works, soaking up some of the more wayward spice and yeast, and somewhat justifying the heat from the not-that-high ABV. Another worthy enough offering from this 'brewing project'."

""
""

""
""
""
""

"Tastes peppery, with yeasty bready characteristics and a bit of a funky wet hay character. It’s estery and floral with a pleasing bite. Enjoyable."

""
""

"O: not a good mix of flavors."

"Decent beer. Not sure if it’s my favorite style though."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I had previously given this one a 4, but I don't think that's the case now. It could be because this one is fresh and the other had some more time on it to bring out some funkiness? I'm not sure, but this wasn't particularly interesting."

"Overall - Awesome Saison. This would be a good one to get someone who has never had a saison. it's not overly spiced or overly fruity and very refreshing. Great beer that will stay in my rotation all summer long."
""
"O - My first ever Lost Abbey and it was a nice Saison. WI does not have many Saisions, so it is always nice when BA's can bring me some. Special thanks to Chris."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 5/21/2012. Pours hazy golden amber color with a nice 2-3 finger dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big lemon, pear, apple, grape, ginger, grains of paradise, orange zest, clove, pepper, herbal, honey, light funk, and earthy yeast esters. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of spices and yeast esters with moderate malt presence. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, grape, grains of paradise, ginger, clove, pepper, orange peel, honey, bread, light funk, and earthy yeast esters. Lingering notes of light fruits, ginger, grains of paradise, clove, pepper, honey, orange peel, and earthy yeast esters on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of spices and yeast esters; with moderate malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a crisp, lightly slick, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent saison! All around great balance and complexity of spices and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering."
""
"O: This saison is a very good representation of the style and I enjoyed the complexity of its flavors and the dryness and carbonation in the mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured out as a hazy yellow color with a thin white head on top. Decent thin retention and light lacing. The smell is slightly funky, a little acidic and floral. The taste of the beer is slightly spicy, some lemon citrus and earthy bitterness. The mouthfeel has a bready creaminess, it's light and slightly refreshing. Overall it's a decent Saison."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice golden yellow with white rolling lacing. Great smell of apples/citrus and has a smooth taste that you want to keep taking another sip. Doesnt really leave a lingering aftertaste except for some sour fruit but definitely not a bad thing. Great for sitting in the sun and drinking."
""
""
""
"Overall this is a solid beer."
""
"Taste: very smooth, nice metallic hoppiness, spicy, can taste a little horse blankent, hops last all the way to the end."

"poured into my Lost Abbey teku, a beautiful opaque marmalade color with a large foamy head, lots of little bubbles, and large clouds of lacing. The smell is spicy, pepper & coriander, and faint solvent, as well as banana. Mouth-feel is medium, slick, and tingly. Taste is spicy pepper, coriander, citrus, very fruity, with spice being the focal point. Finish is quite dry, and begs for another sip, I like it!"
""
""
""
""
"Poured from 750ml corked and caged bottle into stemless wine glass. Pours a golden straw color with a finger of foamy head. Great belgian crisp fruity and straw aromas. Flavor of slightly fruity, like cantalope or grape, mixed with the typical belgian yeasty earthy spicy saison flavor, with a slight pepper finish. Perfectly dry and tart for a saison. really nice brew, but my only complaint is the price. Its deff well crafted, but I think it was around $15+. I bought in Philly, where I hear you have to pony up a big city beer tax...but im not sure id get again at that price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I really liked this saison, such a big nice presentation makes for an ideal bottle to share our have with an elegant dinner instead of wine. I will try to pick this up again."

"The Red Barn Ale was a pleasant surprise for me. I really enjoyed this Red and loved the combination of fruitiness to bold ale flavors. I had this on tap at Yardhouse and would recommend it. Contains a very rich finish too that was nice and refreshing."
""
"a real fine saison, much different than expected, with very little spice or fruit to it, just a whole lot of barnyard funk, which is a nice change of pace in the ever more crowded world of american made saisons. murky pale copper in color, maybe a little lighter than that, with four inches or so of bone white head with outstanding retention. the nose is all yeast, grassy and dry, mouth watering. there is maybe just a touch of lemony citrus to the flavor, but again its all yeast for me. straw and pollen and wet grass. its very summery, august beer, delicate and robust at the same time, no gimmicks. excellent carbonation and a lighter than medium body. its down easy and crackling dry in the finish. had it side by side with the dupont saison, and in a lot of ways i liked this better. it has a great yeast strain, unlike any other i can recall, and the beer just comes together really well. yet another fine lost abbey product, who after a couple of so-so beers is starting to win me back over with stuff like this."
"O: Good all round Saison, happier than expected but balance was still good."
""
"Overall I quite enjoyed my first Lost Abbey beer. It's light, crisp, with no offensive flavors or bittering yeasts. Worth seeking the other beers out for 10+ dollars? Most likely never."
""
"Not a bad saison, but not my favorite. It's earthy and mildly bitter, and at times I feel like I'm licking a flower. Looks gorgeous, though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Lighter medium body, well carbonated, extremely drinkable and clean on the tongue. I've had this before and somehow never reviewed it - there's certainly more expressive and innovative saisons out there but this is a refreshing example of a clean, quaffable brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- It's ok. Spicy and tasty. Weird smell though."
""
"O: While there are a lot of different spice flavors in this beer, they really come together well and match well with none of them dominating the others. Enjoyable but not super easy to drink because of how dry it is."
""
""
""
"Deceptively easy to drink by its flavor characteristics. One of the cleaner tasting American saisons I have had."
""
""
""
""
""
"The body was good, crisp, dry, and medium. Drinkability was very good, this was the rare instance that I didn't mind the usually hated large format bottle. Overall, a pretty nice example of the style. Certainly worth grabbing if you see it."
""
"Wow, excellent beer! Poured at a good good temperature with a mammoth, super frothy, foamy, billowy, off-white head and lots of clingy lace. Color is a very slightly hazy straw amber with some bubble trails. Aroma upon first pouring had a fleeting perfumey, fruity, honey, mustiness that quickly was replaced by malt, yeast, herbs. Flavor's somewhat like nose, has a great bitter-carbonic tang balance with just enough sweetness to make this incredibly tasty and drinkable yet satisfying. Body and carbonation are perfect - great burps too. Finish is like flavor, of average length, and a bit boozy. One of the best saisons ever - including any Belgian."
""
"Overall a solid saison worth trying, I would have again easily."
"O: Decent farmhouse, I tend to like less dry finish on my saisons."
""
"Pours a slightly hazed gold, modest cap of white froth for the style. Scent is big on bready and spicy qualities, notes of citrus zest and candy sugar. Bready, peppery, zesty citrus and light sugar... missing earthy grain profile prefered in style, but still good. Medium bodied, slightly less bubbly than others, dry finish. Solid flavored saison, but lacking in authenticity."
""
""
""
"Another new take on the versatile saision style, this one has a good backbone and demands slower sipping, but rewards with some depth and spicing that suits the yeast rather than clashing with it. Light citrus and moderate hopping set it apart but it still feels authentic."
""
""
"Poured a hazy golden-yellow with a nice, foamy, white head; decent retention and lacing. Aroma is loaded with yeast and barnyard funk, notes of citrus and peppery spice. Taste is sweet and malty up front, hints of stone fruit, quickly replaced by yeasty funk, peppery spice, pale biscuity malts, lighter notes of ginger, citrus, and herbal hops. Light-medium body, fairly dry finish. Pretty good overall."
""
""
""
"Well done overall for the style, well spiced so that you can not pick out any given spice but that they all combine to make a nice bouquet for both the aroma and taste. Very nice treat."
""

"This bottle pours a nice clear applejuice like color with a stream of carbonation bubbles rising up to a thick two finger head that eventually retains to one finger- stays a thick finger til its drank to the bottom. The smell alone is refreshing; tingly orange peel forefront with yeast and spice bitterness. A very earthy aroma that is very relaxing to enjoy. Taste has more of the yeast and spices used- but very balanced out with slight citrus sweetness of the orange peel. Feels great to drink- nicely carbonated and light in the mouth while the head foam finds its spot on the roof. The only other Saison I've ever had is Saison du Buff- the Stone collaboration. I really like that one but if I had to choose one to drink regularly it would definitely be Red Barn."
"When poured into a pint glass, the color was of a hazy wheat yellow, with a lot of foam and a fair amount of lace. The smell of carbonated citrus was very evident, not impressive. The taste was a load of carbonated citrus acid with a hint of lemon and not much of anything else. WAY to acidic on the tongue, palate and stomach. Big aftertaste of bitter, acidic flavor. Not a typical Lost Abbey Ale in my mind!"

"This is a good brew. It is very yeasty, but seems to have more of that raw flavor."
""
"Overall: Complex and intriguing brew with rustic charm, sourness, and brings a great american character to a traditionally foreign brew."
"This beer, from a 750 ml bottle, is a cloudy, hazy, brownish-gold color. The head is thick ans staying. It's a wild and funky beer...yeasty, fruit, some sugar and spice. The taste is more balanced than expected. The taste is light, but earthy and damp. It doesn't get to sou, but is certainly wild."
""
""
""
""
"The beer holds up well and is definitely unique but it's also an acquired taste for those that have already acquired quite a lot. Unique and well brewed but well... just a bit off i guess. Sweet, sour, rich, and bitter. Try wrapping your head around this beer."
""
"O: I was surprised at how many layers of flavor there are in this beer. This is a very, very good saison. Definitely worth the purchase."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A nice Saison. A little heavy on the ginger for me but still enjoyable."
""
""
"Looks exactly like Dupont's saison. Simplier, but tastier and more drinkable than Dupont's. Nicely dry, spicy, phenolic (touch of clove), hoppy bitter. Bitter orange or seeds of paradise perhaps, but not brett. Less pilsner flavor than Dupont's too (not a bad thing)."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A solid Saison, but I prefer Lost Abbey's Carnevale to this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - A solid saison that drinks a bit sweet. Would like it a little drier tasting."
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy gold with a white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain, citrus, spices, and yeast. Taste is of grain, spices, and yeast. There is a mild citrus zest bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good saison with some nice aromas and flavors."
""
""
""
"B-"
""
""
"O: Not my favorite Saison but certainly not the worst I've had. This is my first Lost Abbey and unfortunately it's not a good start. It just didnt work for me."
""
"Overall: A very enjoyable saison. Loads of spiciness and funkiness to keep interesting throughout. Nice beer."

"Big thanks goes out to my doppelganger for sharing this one with me on Super Bowl Sunday as a pre-game snack! Served from bottle into a Bell’s stemmed tulip. Poured a hazy yellow-orange with a four finger pure white head that continued to grow throughout the glass. Yes, that’s right, GROW! It maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, earth, spices, fruit, and earth hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, earth, fruit, earth hop, spices, and subtle banana. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. The look of this brew was what I would want ALL of my Saisons to look! Not much can be improved on that. The flavor however left me a little to want though. The aftertaste just hit you in the face with dirt if I am completely honest. It wasn’t bad, but definitely not ideal. Still a great beer to try if you have not done so before."
""
""
"Overall: this is a very well-crafted and tasty saison. It is eminently quaffable and great on a sunny day like this."
""
"Overall – Not the best beer I've had from lost abbey but still delicious and very drinkable. It might be just a touch too much on the dry/floral side. Happy I tried but I'd grab something else next time."

"Pours a hazy yellow color with a big off white head. In the aroma, lemon citrus, lemon grass, spice and yeast. In the taste, spicy and yeasty, with a dry lemon grass earth and a small tartness. A spice bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a lightly dry lemon citrus and spice in the aftertaste. Spicy, refreshing, small tartness, and it is very nice."

"Excellent ale, but a surprise given the name"

"Red Barn is just not doing it for me. I like a dry earthy flavor in a Saison, this takes these flavors a bit too far. The flavor becomes a bit overpowering and brings the drinkability on a bit."
"An enjoyable Farmhouse Ale from The Lost Abbey."

"Pours a semi-hazed dark apricot color with a large, foamy white head and a good bit of lacing on the way down. The nose brings forward a bit of stone fruit plus some light spice. Hints of grain. Flavor has a good dosing of fruit and light spice. Light-medium body with good carbonation and a crisp finish. Nice beer."

"Beautiful golden pour with a thick white head. There is a nice wheat smell with a little herb touch. It's an easy drinking beer with slight bitterness on the back end. Overall I enjoyed this beer. I would like to try this with another saison to see some difference, so if anyone has any suggestions on a great saison please drop me a message and let me know. Also kudos to lost abbey on the bottling and presentation of there beers. I know a lot of people that buy beer based on the labeling and bottles and this will definatly attract them. I can't wait to try other lost abbey brews"
"I must admit my palate may be out of touch with the Saison style, however this really seems to have at least a hint of just about every trait one can ask for."
"o) Becomes more assertive as it warms. Has a profile that is reminiscent of Orval, minus the Brett. Certainly not for all palates; it's an 'intellectual' beer that raises many talking points. Good with a red curry, and to be shared."
"A good beer, but I really did want it to be better. A touch of acidity on the palate would have helped, as probably would have a lighter touch on the spices (assuming they added some—if not, it's a good job they did getting the yeast to produce such flavours). But it's still pretty drinkable and pretty enjoyable. Unfortunately, my standards for Saisons and for The Lost Abbey are unreasonably high, so I did find this something of a disappointment."
"Not a bad beer overall. Reminded me of a Hoegaarden White. I’d try it again."
"So many Saisons blend together to me. Some tend towards a ripe barley flavor, some a more citrusy flavor. But this one really played up the spices the way a west coast IPA plays up the hops. I thought at first my taste buds wouldn't last a whole pint, but it grew on me as I noticed more complexities. This is one of two Saisons that went the super spicy route, the other being Orchard White by The Bruery and that had too much lavender for my liking. Although this has too much spice for me to order frequently, it's a refreshing, interesting beer I'd try again another night."
"O= Overall this is a decent Saison, I do think there are better ones out there glad I got a chance to try this one and to sample a couple beers from this brewery."
"O- First brew from The Lost Abbey, though I always see it at shops around the Chicago area. Refreshing and a solid Saison for a humid summer day."
"O: Love the pour and the smell of this one."
"A solid saison. Only bought it because it was on sale, the first carbonated Lost Abbey bottle I have tried."
"Medium gold body, some visible carbonation but not a lot, 3/4 finger white head quick dissipation with some lacing present. Nose is fairly spicy, coriander dominant with some meyer lemon esters, floral hops. Taste is once again fairly spicy for the style, balanced by floral notes and light lemony goodness. Mouthfeel is on the light side of medium, good effervescence. Real drinkable, fit well into the progression for the tasting and the SoCal theme."
"Pours a gold hazy color with a thick cloud like fluffy 3 finger head that dissipates to a constant one finger head. Aroma of funk, yeast citrus and pepper. Taste follows the nose with overwhelming fruity notes. Very fresh and refreshing. Aside from what Fantome offers, this may be my favorite saison!"
"This is a nice complex beer that wasnt what I anticipated, but certainly was an enjoyable experience."
"T: Taste is pretty solid with a malty backbone and a lot of earthiness towards the finish. Some spicy almost medicinal hops towards the finish as well as some belgian yeast."
"Red Barn comes through a burnt red color but is more like a rusted copper shade with a tan/beige inch of foam up above, not to thick, nor thin, on par per style, nice staggering pieces of foam on the glass. Smell is grassy like with a hint of apple and some type of Belgian yeast imparting a light bisquit vibe. Small hits of citrus is very hard to sense, but it is there. Sweet malt, brown and the like. Pretty bold in scent off the tap at least. Taste is a saison with a hint of beire de garde flavor, kinda a mix of the two. Grassy, floral, apple over pear. Slight bisquit from the malt leaving for a well balanced saison, yet nothing out of the ordinary. As a saison, this hits the marks though, except the yeast is a bit lighter than Belgian types making this more in line with American styles. Feel is a step above, well lets say it's approaching medium, carbed up nice off the tap with a crisp finish and slightly dry. Glad I tried this, doubt I would buy a bottle of it, but if I can get it on the cheap off the tap in a pint, i'll always be game."
"mouthfeel - nice body and very crisp and refreshing, drank this bomber pretty damn quick"
"This beer pours a clean golden color with two fingers of thick foamy white head that retains very well and laces as you drink. The aroma has the typical saison characteristics of some earthy hops, banana and citrus notes. The aroma was also pretty slinky, which is why it good not as good ratings from me. The taste starts with sweet banana and citrus and then a little maltiness and maybe a hint of salt? The mouthfeel is slightly overcarbonated and finishes with a very bitter feel. Overall an ok saison."
"Taste is good, fruity, light, and crisp. Maybe a little thin? But for a summertime beer that's not necessarily bad. A bitter bite in there too. A good - but maybe not great - example of a saison. For the price, better ones can be found."
"O- The dominate flavors, although still soft, were apple juice and stale spices makes this a bland beer. There was a good dry finish but the mouthfeel was a little to full to make this crisp and refreshing. I love this style and didn't get any yeast character that I like in a saision."
"O: Sort of a let down compared to how I recall this beer being. Might have to revisit it again."
"Not my favorite, but definitely interesting and worth trying out."
"O – A delicious saison on the herbal side of the style."
"If the base yeast profile wasn't overcome by the sour throat lozenge character, I'd love this beer. I just found the spicing/additions to be overdone."
"O- Very solid saison and what you would imagine a saison to be. Very good drink, nothing over the top. Thanks Adam for sending this my way!"
"O: A really nice Saison overall. Nice to drink at the pool as it is refreshing. Definitely worthy of a try no doubt."
"Overall, this is a decent little American Saison... But there are others I think are better. This one is worth a shot, as it is enjoyable."
"Medium body, decent carbonation. Easy to drink. Temp needed to come up on this one. Quenching and rich in flavor. A good brew."
"Mouth"
"Overall: While the savory spicing would make it an easy choice to pair with a variety of grub, just one its own, I find the spice addition to be slowly, incessantly rankling."
"Very crisp and well-carbonated, gave it a nice finish. Just didn't seem like a saison, but not a bad beer."
"O - this is a tasty farmhouse ale thats well worth it for the price. will definitely give this one another try."
"Fruit and spice, and yeast in holy matrimony! Excellent flavors, great spice profile, very tart and dry. Very complex Saison that I thoroughly enjoyed. Highly recommended."
"Taste starts with light toasted pilsner malt, imbuing soft biscuits and crackers. The middle has an herbal spice and hop flavor that refreshes the palate, along with the awesome bubbly mouthfeel. The finish and linger are a mild earthy bitterness from both spice and hop with just a faint nuance of bread crust on the finish."
"I liked this Saison a lot. Great aroma, but wish there was just a little more going on in the taste. Still, great offering from Lost Abbey."
"One of the better Saisons I've had. Tasted at the Pearl in Point Loma, San Diego."
"O- This is deffinitely a good saison, the mouthfeel is the highlight. Would certainly have this again. Could see drinking this on a hot summer day."
"o - nicely done saison. Pretty classic...with great balance. I like a bit more sweetness and not as dry, but most in this style are like this. This is a very solid saison."
"Overall: I liked it and wife liked it too. Bottle opened with a nice pop."
"O: The maltiness is over done from what I like: lemony, peppery, and funky goodness."
"Love the label of this brew and it pours a deep golden hue with beautiful carbonation that leaves behind a frothy two finger head and heaps of lacing,the smell is barnyard funk,yeasty bread and spicy herbal hops,it has a medium bodied mouthfeel which coats the mouth with tastes of tart barnyard funk,spices,orange rind and finished with a spicy hop bitterness that is somewhat tart aswell and overall its not."
"O: Seems well-made, but just not so much my style of farmhouse ale. I'd like a little less dry, a little more fruity esters."
"o: great belgian saison style. big fan of port brewing and lost abbey already and this just adds to that list. highly recommended to fans of belgian ales and fine ale in general."
"Pours a lovely, slightly hazy amber with a very thick off-white head that hangs around for a while. Aroma is strong, fruity, yeasty and malty with hoppy and sour hints. Fruity flavor has malty and yeasty tones, as well as some hoppy bitterness and a sour undertone. Texture is quite fizzy and leaves a tingle that has a tone of grapefruit somewhat like an IPA. This beer is for sipping and savoring, not for swilling. Also, it is best appreciated by itself."
"O: This is one of my favorite styles, so I'm definitely very picky. While this one is not my favorite, I'd definitely drink this one again given the chance!"
"I had to pick this one up recently while in Chicago. Anything from the Lost Abbey at 8.99 is worth trying. It pours a murky beautiful golden yellow with a three finger foamy, poofy bright white head. I'd say it's a golden honey in color. The foam takes a little while to calm down. It has multifaceted aromas. Depending on the whiff you take you'll get some yeast, bread, light pale malt sweetness, spice, citrus, or even a touch of sour. The flavor is very dry, spicy, with a light citrus finish on the verge of being bitter. It's tasty and different. It's a little light on the palate and leaves a slightly bitter citrus like after taste behind. It's solid and worth a try."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer, no doubt. It is a little bit funky, but I like my Saison's a little wilder, personally. This is personal preference. On the other hand, the total hop profile is very dominant on this beer, so I would like to try it again in a couple years so they can soften up some. It is coming across like an Imperial IPA with Belgian ingredients, but I still think that it is close to the style and I am definitely glad that I have finally tried one of The Lost Abbey's beers."
"D- Really tasty saison; enjoyed this with some crab cakes and it was a nice match."

"This beer is too easy to drink; it seems like it almost doesn't want you to keep it around long enough to appreciate it for all that it is. I'm happy I had to write this review or I would have downed it a lot faster."
"Drinkability: A pretty good saison and another fine offering from Lost Abbey. Not overpowering in any category and one I'll revisit during the summer months."
"Drinkability: An excellent beer to be sure -- great tastes, unique flavors (once the skunk fades); fairly lively body and an ABV that won't wreck anybody's palate. I think this beer would be great in the hot summer months as it comes across as very refereshing."
"the drink ability is awesome...especially since they didn't go over the top with the alcohol"
"The drinkability is good. The 750ml bottle almost disappeared in no time. It went well with Vermont extra sharp cheddar cheese and extra fancy giardiniera. I think it would go well with almost any food."
"The beer is extremely drinkable, but I also drank the bottle over a 2 hour time period. Overall, this is an excellent beer if you like Belgian beer. This is probably the best Farmhouse Ale that I have tried."
"D: This is a good beer. I can't say I would drink more than one in a sitting, but 750ml is not a challenge by any means. I'm just now getting into saisons, we'll see how I feel in a couple months about this one."
"Not my favorite saison or Lost Abbey beer but still decent."
"D: Good saison, not overpowering in any way and really easy to drink."
"This is a good beer suitable for great summer fun."
"D - Not to into Saison's but this one was not to bad."
"Overall I'd been passing over this beer for quite some time when in markets to which LA distributes in favor of more limited releases and now I see that wasn't a good idea. A very good example for the style and one that's well worth a shot."
"Couldn't get a ton on the aroma at first, which surprised me, but eventually smelled wheat, grassy hops and yeasty bread immediately after swirling and agitating. Tastes of grassy/straw notes, a little lemon and other spices. A bit of pepper. Mouthfeel is crisp at first, but finishes smooth. Highly drinkable."
"D-this is a pretty tasty saison. one of the better lost abbey beers i've had. very drinkable stuff and stays towards the belgian inspiration the style originates from."
"M/D - Light, effervescent mouth feel with a dry finish. Maybe a little too much lingering bitterness, but otherwise very drinkable."
"Overall: this is one of the better saisons I've ever had. Great flavor and mouthfeel. Refreshing and well crafted. I really like the lable picture too."
"Poured on-tap at the Port/Lost Abbey Brewery. The beer is a hazy, yellow-gold color, with a filmy, miniscule head. There is a sweet and peppery nose on this beer, with citrus undertones. The flavor is smooth and round, with heavy pepper undertones to balance the sweet ginger and citrus flavors. The beer has a crisp finish, with the slightest little kiss of hops. There is a nice, smooth finish despite the peppery tones. The boldness of the flavors makes this a low quantity beer per sitting, but unique nonetheless."
"T- I didnt care for the taste of this one so much. Its pretty bitter with a citrus rind and slightly medicinal cocktail. Light funk and plenty of spices."
"Never got a chance to try this one. Very nice indeed."
"overally, this beer was pretty hard to drink for a saison, it went down smooth but was just a little strange for me compared to dupont and the classics, and even other lost abbey saisons."
"d - A nice saison with a lot of those classic farmhouse ale characteristics; lots of spice, yeast and pepper. Would like to have again."
"Drinkability: Typical for the better beers of this style, this one is highly drinkable and enjoyable. Towards the end I notice something slightly off about the hops but otherwise I have only good things to say."
"D - Easy. I finished the 750 by myself."
"Drinkability - s fairly drinkable saison, but i cant say that I'm dying to have another one right now. Overall, a very nice beer from Lost Abbey, but not a complete success to me."
"Red Barn ranges in color from burnt goldenrod (ambient lighting) to bright lemon yellow (fully backlit), and has some, but not total clarity. The first pour yielded about three fingers of head, with so-so retention and no detectable lacing. The second pour though yielded a full extra finger's worth of pure white foam, and retention and lacing are markedly improved. I'll chalk the first pour up to maybe a slightly dirty glass and take most of my impressions from the second pour. Orange and citrus dominate the nose, though the grains of paradise and black pepper are certainly present. I can't really find any ginger though, and ditto that for any malty flavors. There's just the briefest flash of green apple sweetness, and a mere suggestion of bitterness from restrained hopping. Otherwise, this beer is a blank canvas for the yeast and spices to work their magic. Again the orange is the standout flavor, with solid support from black pepper and grains of paradise. I'm used to my saisons being fairly spicy, so Red Barn featuring citrus more than black pepper/clove is a welcome change. I'm a little disappointed that I still can't find any ginger though. A top of the line saison has a truly transcendent mouthfeel, and in this regard Red Barn falls a bit short. Even for what's supposed to be a dry beer it's a bit too thin, crossing the line into watery. At the same time the carbonation is a bit too enthusiastic. Thin and fizzy is not a good body/carbonation combo. That dings the drinkability, but just a little bit. Red Barn is a fine beer, with the prominent orange peel being an interesting twist for the style. Still, I view this as an occasional change of pace beer from some other saisons I'd probably opt for more regularly."
"It tastes much like it smells, really Unibroue-ish and tasty. Light tropical fruit flavors and maybe a little peppery spice. Very nice, with a lasting peppery aftertaste. Light bodied, lots of flavor for the low ABV, extremely good."
"Overally, a very tasty Saison- I'll definietly have another, please! Good job!"
"D: This farmhouse ale is very drinkable. Great for warm weather. Will definitely pick up again."
"The zen-like focus and quality of this beer leaves me with nothing more to desire...well done."
"Drinkability: I enjoyed the beer and would probably drink it again."
"Overall an interesting saison. worth a try."
"Overall a pretty solid saison, but nothing real special either."
"Drinkability was high, this beer goes down easy."
"I split a large bottle at Monk's Cafe for $15. Heck of a beer. It's brewed with the Saison Dupont yeast and I think is shows in the bright, spicy character. The brewing spices and yeast character blend together with subtle layers of vanilla, orange peel, peppercorn, herbal spice, and smooth bready barley. There's a herbal hop element around the yeast character for great, fresh farmhouse ale. Check this one out."
"Drinkability is excellent stuff, one of the best all around American brewed Saisons that uses many of the Belgian characteristics with American zeal to make it all work together so well."
"D: Decent tasting, light enough to drink all-day, but given the hype, disappointing. Will put one in the cellar, we'll see how this opens up in a year or two."
"This is not as boozy or astringent as the first sample I had of this beer. I personally think that their Devotion is a better take on a saison (hoppy and bone dry). I'm not crazy about the spices used in this one, but maybe that is just personal preference."
"D - Good beer and very delicious take on a great style."
"Very well-executed hoppy saison, which is what I expected of Lost Abbey. Recommended for any fan of the style, but definitely recommended if you like hoppy saisons or any blonde Belgian with a stronger than normal hop presence. The complexity and bite is slowing me down somewhat, but that doesn't mean I'm not enjoying it."
"In short, if you like beers in the genre, pick this one up."
"D: Really love this beer, lots to this beer. another great one from lost abbey! i want another already!"
"A saison that's dry enough to bear the name! Pale malts are dressed up in their Sunday best by orange peel, spices, and peppery saison yeast. Aroma is Belgian funk and pale malt, lingering over a clear pale amber beer. Alcohol is strong, but doesn't overpower the aromas. Hops are brisk and linger on your palette with German spiciness. It's not clear if this saison benefits from the spices or not. They are certainly not inappropriate or in the way, but you wonder why the glories of pale malt, spicy hops, and spicy yeast need anything else."
"Overall a tasty beer, smooth and pleasant and has some character."
"D: A nice pleasant refreshing summer beer, not exactly sessionable, but goes down easy. Lost Abbey has yet to let me down."
"I like this beer, and I'll have it again, but it won't take the place of Saison Dupont or Hennepin. It's a good saison, but a little bit of an oddball. Maybe I need a few more to understand it better. I'll definitely have a few more just to be sure."
"D - high. Had a 4 oz sampler and would have been much happier with a 22 oz bottle."
"Great mouthfeel with top notch balance in the carbonation. Fairly drinkable but probably best to split this beer with someone, once it's reached the right temperature."
"Poured a hazy golden yellow with a half finger of head that left lots of blotchy lacing on the glass. Coriander and belgian strike first on the aromas that had coriander and slight apple notes. It also got a little spice as well. Belgian yeast, brett, and corinader dominate the palate which had apple, spice, and grainy accents. The beer was medsium body with a good amount of carbonation that had a sweet grainy finish. Pretty good saison from lost abbey and shows me their getting better at the belgian style beers."
"D: On a hot day I can imagine sucking a few of these back, and with a 6.7% ABV, you have to watch yourself in those situations! Very drinkable, and very summer-y beer to enjoy on your porch."
"Poured this summertime treat into my Russian River snifter. Pours a very nice, murky golden straw color with a large white head that diminishes slowly. In the nose I get some funk with a strong scent of green apples (especially when it warms up). Also pick up some Belgian yeast scents. Taste definitely has some lovely spice to it. Very tasty spices along with green apple, very light funk, and some grassy/wheat flavors. A little alcohol taste toward the end. Very well balanced. I also get a bit of orange. The mouthfeel is very pleasant and medium bodied with a crisp bite to it (just like a good saison). Good drinkability on this one."
"Golden with a white head that has just okay retention and leaves nice lace as the beer disappears. Nose has a hint of peppery spice followed by a hint of barn with a lemony and citrusy hoppiness that s of the seems like sweet citrus from it's harmonizing with the malt and maybe sugar. The hop comes out a lot as it warms. Taste is a very well-balanced version of the nose and is delivered on a nice, light-medium, soft body with a sweet peppery hop finish that lasts. Another great beer from one of our best breweries. i want more."
"D - Overall this was a very enjoyable beer that I could drink and have drank a number of these in a sitting worth getting to try sometime"
"Drinkability: Good beer for the summer. Very tasty."
"Drinkability: A very light and smooth saison. This is a sipper and I could have a couple."
"D - a bit powerful for a session need, but tasty in all ambient weather conditions!"
"This is a really nice Saison. No single element amazes, but the requisite complex spiciness and soft, refreshing character is definitely there."
"Overall not the most exciting Saison I've had but drinkable none the less."
"D: Very drinkable, pleasant. Not overbearing with muted flavors."
"D - It's a decent saison. I almost wonder if it's got a little age on it based on the mild flavor and aroma for the style. Still, it's got fantastic drinkability, especially for a summer beer!"
"Not bad, but not a good Saison IMO. This is rather bland overall. There are much better versions of the style."
"D- Goes down easy but doesn't have a whole lot going on. This is my first LA offering and wasn't really impressed but am looking forward to trying more of their beers."
"I am disappointed by this beer, sure. It is an average saison more or less because it simply lacks the complexity that other farmhouse ales have. It is plenty enjoyable for what it is."
"Taste: A slightly sharp bitterness and fresh lemon/orange citrus meet light coriander spiciness. Very pleasant. Lemon peel bitterness increases in the middle with a slightly grapefruity juiciness. The underlying grainyness is nice and there is definite, but low level, funkiness going on. The finish is crisp, a little more grainy, with some alcohol bite - which was surprising. Some funk remains."
"Reviewed from notes from last night. This is my first real time having a saison, only other one was a sample of Pretty Things Jack D'or a while ago. Poured into a tulip hazy golden with a decent rocky white head, shrinks over time forming a ring with pretty good lacing. The smell is pretty grassy, wheat with a bit of light fruit. Fruit and tartness come out moreso in the taste. Green apple, lemon, grass, wheat, a tiny bit of cherry-like tartness, some booze taste too. A very little bit of funk and not very sour at all, I'd give it maybe a 3/10 on the sour scale. Mouthfeel was quite good considering the style, but kept it at a 4 just because of a seemingly high alcohol taste for a 6.7%. I'd try it again."
"Pours a lightly hazy golden yellow color with a big, rocky off-white head. Smells yeasty, sweet, peppery and slightly tart. On the palate I get more of the same, with some lemon zest and a bit of funk. A refreshing beer, with a good sweet/sour balance."
"As far as mouthfeel, well, at least it's carbonated. The drinkability is none. The sips sufficient to review it were enough for me, and now it is going down the drain."
"Poured from a 750 ml bottle into a goblet. Appearance is an amazing golden blonde tint, a thick white foam is left behind after a soft pour. Some lacing is left behind. The aroma here is amazing. It's a mixture of funky Belgian yeast, floral notes, and soft fruity elements. Something in my mind is screaming pineapple and tropical fruit. The taste is delicious as well. Smooth, refreshing, and certifiably funky. Absolutely drinkable, could sip on this one all day. Especially during the hot Central Valley summer we've got coming up in Northern California. Lost Abbey has done this Belgian classic better than most Belgians. This is at or above the efforts of DuPont, and in IMO, well above Hennepin or any American Saisons. Overall, a fantastic effort on the part of Port/Lost Abbey."
"D: A nice refreshing saison. Definitely not in the superfunky saison family, more like a Hennepin. If that floats your boat this is certainly one to check out."
"D: I'm not that into it, though I remember it tasting better the first time I had it"
"This is a great example of the saison style. It is highly drinkable beer with a great taste that keeps inviting the drinker to come back for more."
"I really enjoyed the Red Barn Ale. It pours golden with white head that lingers and sticks to the glass. You can smell the citrus flavor. There is a great deal of flavor, seems like it would be a great summer season beer. It's pretty refreshing too. There is some nice carbonation to this beer as well. This was a good saison, I recommend it."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with above average carbonation, which is good for the style. Drinkability is good, it's a very nicely flavored and complex beer that I really enjoyed."
"Overall - A pretty good saison. A few off notes but certainly worth a try..."
"HV"
"It is not as refreshing - and summery - as the marketing on the bottle hopes to portray."
"NOTE: Towards the end of the bottle I swirled it around a bit - made it a bit more cloudy (but not much) and toned down the bitter/sour taste a bit to make it a tad more drinkable (from a 2 to 2.5), but it is still problematic."
"Look and smell started very promising, but the taste was disappointing. The spices are understated and there just is not enough flavor for my personnel taste."
"D - I really like this beer. It is maybe a bit too hoppy and heavy with its maltiness for a saison."
"It has a clear golden reddish body with a slightly foam white head and very minimal carbonation. Lots of spice in the aroma, I can detect the ginger and some nice pepperiness, there are also sweet grains in the aroma. The flavours are also spicy, with lots of pepper and a clear taste of yeasts. Behind there is a somewhat subtle maltiness that has a slight creamy toffee taste. The mouthfeel has little carbonation although this provides quite a smooth feel. Very nice saison, with an easy drinkability."
"I picked this up because I love saisons and it garnered an overall A- rating here, but frankly I'm underwhelmed and a little disappointed."
"This beer walks the line between Belgian pale and saison, extremely tasty."
"75cl bottle. Clear deep gold-orange color with a big wispy and lacy head. Head sustains almost to the bottom. Potent and sweet aroma with nectar, orange marmalade, leather, and black pepper. Flavor is spicy, with ground pepper and zesty, earthy hops. Starts with a little citric sweetness, and finishes quite dry, with alcohol stripping the tongue along with a light citric astringency. Spicy pepper lingers in the back of your mouth. Medium-light body with smooth but tenacious carbonation. The dryness and spice makes it quite refreshing, but there is a tad too much pepper in the finish. Still quite good, but it would be one of my top beers if they toned this down a little."
"D-A full flavoured, sharp saison that delivers a full frontal assault of spiciness and mustiness with a nice underlying honey-esque sweetness. This one is hard not to like for a saison lover like myself."
"M&D - a wonderful saison, one of the better saisons i have had, medium bodied with well blended and balanced flavors and aromas, a taste that begs you to try another to see if you got all the flavors"
"Drinkability: Not as good as I had hoped. Some more depth and funkiness would have been really nice. A good beer, but I ended up giving away the last half of it in favor of something else."
"Crisp medium body with a spicy peppery zest up front as well as some full bready yeast character. Crisp light fruit notes and a very prominent citrus presence, mostly orange and grapefruit. Also, there is some subtle lemon peel as well as some strawberry, peaches and cream. Slightly earthy with a bit of tart bretty funk. Their is a large emphasis on the grapefruit tartness and earthy funk. The more I drink the more it tastes like a beer version of grapefruit juice, which is very unpleasant. Slight alcohol warmth in the finish but overall the alcohol is decently masked. Dry tart grapefruit finish."
"I drank a couple of these, loved them, drink this all day."
"I found this to be one of the easier drinking saisons I have had. The alcohol was barely noticeable. I could easily polish off multiple 750's of this guy."
"It has a decent mouthfeel, very drinkable if I could get over the taste."
"D- Delicious. Not very horsey, but quite enjoyable."
"Overall a very, very enjoyable but different farmhouse/saison with the nice hop bite. I really loved this beer and could drink it anytime. Easily one of my favorite in the style. Nice work Tomme, this one is a win!"
"Drinkability: Not bad despite the mouthfeel."
"This is one of the dryer and hoppier saisons I've had. A very drinkable saison from the lost abby, worth trying if you get a chance."
"Drink is very good.Easy to have a few of these a light bodied and very tasty."
"D - Since the body is fairly light and finishes dry, this is an easy to drink beer. No noticeable Alcohol bite. The bitterness seems a bit unbalanced but not enough to hinder consumption."
"taste should be 3.8 and drinkability a 4.0"
"Very thick feel to it, starts with very soft lemon, progresses to a tart orange and sour peach flavors. Not too impressed here. Some sort of weird malt taste that just doesn't do it for me."
"Well, that was a pleasant brew, but where's the love for the Red Barn? One of the more ""affordable"" Lost Abbey brew on the market, and a very good one too."
"D - I really, really like this brew. More funk than a lot of saisons, and it works exceptionally well with the fruity, spicy flavor profile. I'd love to drink this with fried fish tacos, a Chicago-style hotdog, or a bright cow's milk cheese like Piermont from Robie Farm in Piermont, NH. Fans of saisons, seek out this brew!"
"Difficult to put down - glad I picked this up after being disappointed in Serpent's Stout."
"- Overall very smooth and creamy... just a touch over carbonated. The head won't go away, and it keeps me from wanting todrink this balanced farmhouse as quickly as I want to.."
"D: A bit better than avg drinkability, not overwhelming but intense at times. Not Ommegang, but well-done. One of my top beers from the Abbey."
"Drinkability: Heavy in some ways, but definitely a saison style with the clove and bread style. If that's your thing, it's really drinkable, but for me it bogged down after a while from the sheer weightiness. Overall, a solid beer that displays the Saison style pretty proficiently."
"D - Nice spiced up saison with a good amount of funk to mix things up and keep it interesting. This is definitely not too sweet at all for the style, which in turn really enhances its overall drinkability."
"I really like this beer and this style is growing on me. I want to have this brew with a nice ham dinner."
"D - Overall great. This represents what a saison should be with even though some brettanomyeces may have been introduced to this batch. I don't know why I always skip this bottle when I shop, but will purchase as it is a favorite saison now."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a nice sour-style Saison that is worth drinking a while."
"All in all, a pretty solid example of the style and one that won't break the bank. It's a nice brew to have with grilled chicken and veggies. Worth seeking out."
"M/D - Light, crisp, and very well carbonated. The aftertaste is somewhat rough around the edges and not the most pleasant of tastes. Overll, fairly easy drinking though."
"There really wasn't anything that jumped out at me while drinking this. I won't be seeking his one out again."
"D - This is a pretty good saison. It really has a good balance of unique flavors."
"Overall a very good beer. Nicely funky, good points for originality, well executed, I likes, the wife likes."
"Overall: Good drinkability, nothing is overwhelming about this beer. The smooth, slightly flat mouthfeel is actually pretty nice in this beer."
"Overall a pretty good Saison."
"Crisp and refreshing. Well crafted beer. Very sessionable."
"Very drinkable. Give me a lawn and a comfy chair and I'll drink it forever."
"Pours a clear light golden amber color with a smallish white head that leaves some lace on the glass. Looks like a macro lager, but that is where the similarities end. Smells of green apples, citrus, spice, funk, slight floral or earthy hop in the back. Taste is sweet and sour with citrus, lemons and bitter oranges, spicy yeast, slight barnyard funk. Crisp, refreshing with an earthy sour finish. Carbonation is medium, body is light to medium, mouthfeel is crisp cirtusy. Great farmhouse ale."
"clear gold body with a sweet, spicy and funky aroma. Mild barn yard notes too. On the palate it is sweet malt, honey, orange peel, a little funk and a bitter finish. Medium bodied and very fun to drink. Good to see a saison with some funk to it. Good stuff."
"D: I had this and the Devotion side-by-side. Both were very similar to each other, and they're somewhat unremarkable against other saisons I've had. Even if this were a style I frequented, I doubt I'd pick this one up at this price point ($10 per)."
"As with Carnevale, a really well done Saison. This one is very different in character, almost like it had a bit of age on it. I wonder if it matured a bit on the shelf - regardless, fantastic beer."
"D - I drank this when I was sort of thirsty and it was refreshing and I found myself drinking it quickly."
"From the bottle it pours an opaque deep golden color with an orange hue. A thick white head subsides to a thin veil. Does my nose protest, no, that is a distinct pepper on the nose first followed up by a strange sort of dryness, finishing with some malty barnyard aromas. There is no mistaking from the nose that this one is going to have a distinct dryness to it when it hits the mouth. Yup, there it is, dry dry dry yet still sweet. And there is something unexpected, a mintiness that persists to aftertaste. Some wheat there too, and acidic citrus tang, and maybe some peach hiding out in the distant background. This one is not my favorite, well brewed by all means and for that I give it credit, but for my personal self I give it some low marks on taste and drinkability."
"Drinkability - Yep, a great saison, potentially one of the best I've had. I would have another, but the availability is quite limited here in SC. This one, along with several other Lost Abbey offerings, I obtained while on a work-related trip to San Diego. Only got one of these. Wish I got more."
"What can I say. This one was a huge letdown in the taste department. And I like this style of beer. This one however, is one I will not be drinking again."
"i'll have to give this another try from a bottle to figure out the savory smoky element...7/4/7/4/15/3.7"
"D: A nice beer overall, and my first experience with this style. Right out of the gate, I wasn't all that impressed. But its complexity grew as I drink it and drew me in."
"Really fairly refreshing after the RIS I just enjoyed... I am very happy that I finally decided to cork this one. Even after all this time, it still seems a little bit sweet.. very drinkable yet still very sweet for the style.. it needs to dry out a bit."
"Pours a clear, pale orange with a high white head that lingers, leaving some fine lacing down the glass. The smell is enticing: grass, pine, dandelion, honey. The taste starts off with honey, moves through some nutty notes into a long bitter dandelion-stem finish. The carbonation is fine, the body creamy in texture but none too thick. It's extraordinarily easy to drink. One hell of a saison -- glad I was able to find it."
"Overall, I wouldn't mind drinking this occasionally, but it was probably my least favorite lost abbey so far."
"7/4/7/4/15 (3.7/5)"
"D: Great balance of spicing, carbonation brings out the great aroma and flavor of this beer. A nice saision, not as funky as its Belgium counterpart but a very drinkable example with a rich variety of flavor makes this a solid example none the less."
"The taste never reaches the heights of the scent, but that was difficult to accomplish at the outset. An initial pear sweetness gives way to a slightly musty hay flavor. Finishes with a dry semi acidic and almost citrus like flavor. Voluminous carbonation supports the mouthfeel and increases the sharpness of the finish. Drinkable and enjoyable even if it isn't summer anymore."
"D- This is a very nice beer. It reminds me a little bit of Brooklyner-Schneider Hopfen-Weisse, in all honesty. Its very juicy and hoppy, and delicious. I would definitely have this one again."
"I never know what to expect with Saisons. I either like them or hate them. I like this one. Pours hazy yellow-gold with a huge white head. Spun sugar, musty malt, bananas, clove, and lemon in the nose. Sweet, light clean taste similar to a trippel. Great yeast ester bubblegum and clove flavors, and the ginger definitely enhances the taste here. More orange peel and pepper with lemon towards the back. Great warm-weather beer."
"A very drinkable, refreshing, well-balanced Saison. Alcohol very well-covered - very drinkable for abv. I could easily see myself enjoying a couple bottles of this, especially in the summer (though very enjoyable year-round!)"
"Notes from 5/12/07"
"Drinkability is also very good, especially for a Belgian style. Many times they can be too powerful both in flavor and in alcohol. This one is balanced, clean, and not overpowering. Very well done."
"Not a bad drinking saison, a bit too fruitty for me to want to session on. Good offering from Lost Abbey"
"This is EXTREMELY enjoyable as something to savor even though it is of quite light body. Sit back, relax and contemplate the complexity of this wonderful offering."
"Either way this beer was very drinkable, and definitely would go quite well with some fried eggs or pommes frites."
"drinkability: good"
"One and a half years cellared, picked up at a Pizza Plant fresh. Very zesty, enjoyable fresh tasting saison. Sweetish malt made it dangerously drinkable. Whitish colour. Way above average mouthfeel.Mildly spicey,with pepper, ginger, anise, malty and yeast aroma.Good balance."
"Taste is spicy, and peppery. Full and creamy on the mouthfeel. This is a decent brew. I was expecting more funkiness to it."
"Overall while not my favorite beer from Lost Abbey buy any means, it was still more then adequate and a pretty damn solid offering. I would have no issue at all with trying this one again; it really came across quite well and as a side note, made an excellent marinade."
"Another impressive outing here from the Lost Abbey. If the cost was even a little bit cheaper, I would drink these with some regularity. As it is, I treat these the same way I treat Dogfish Head's rotating beers, Avery's Imperials, and lots of imports: attempt to try each of them once privately and then return to favorites for get-togethers and dinners. I can't think of a better American saison to have with just about any meal you'd like to cobble together."
"Overall, Lost Abbey Red Barn Ale is an outstanding Saison that is highly recommended. Saisons are my favorite beer style, and this one ranks up near the top of my favorites."
"Overall a good but not great saison. As I said, too dry and overspiced for my taste. It's my first Lost Abbey (got 3 more in the fridge) so curious how those taste. I do recommend but don't sell the farm getting it."
"Delicious."
"D- I have really been into Saison/Farmhouses lately. They seem to vary widely. LA has put their unique influence on this one. If you enjoy this style, this is a good one to have. If you enjoy lighter drinking beers, this is a good one. If you love summer, this is a good one."
"I hope this beer is sired more often, i'll drink it."
"Drinkability is pretty high. It's a delicious farmhouse giving great flavors. Relatively low alcohol makes for easy drinking. Just easy drinking, smooth, and refreshing. A great treat indeed."
"D: excellent. on a hot summer's day I could drink this all day...or any day really, heh"
"Pours a cloudy golden with a huge frothy off white head. Aroma is medium sweet ginger, lemon, orange and dough. Flavor is ginger, yeasty, some clove and citrus. Long dry finish. Light to medium body, creamy texture. A mighty fine example of the style."
"Mouthfeel is on the lighter side with plenty of fast moving carbonation as it flows down. This is an easy drinking, totally enjoyable saison that goes well with the summer season. Overall, this doesn't quite blow me away like previous bottles of SPF45 have in the past, but this is a damn fine saison and I'm glad to have had the chance to sample it."
"Great, awesomely refreshing brew. I have not had much from The Lost Abbey due to accessability, but am extremely glad to be able to enjoy this offering."
"Crisp clean finish."
"Easy to knock back several bottles of this stuff. The abv is not too high and the drinking experience is top notch."
"Dropped into a goblet, produced a sparkling fizzy pour that left a cloudy, hazy golden honey like elixir, with a frothy white head. Sweet fruit smell with spices, orange and clove. I get a little yeasty hay in there as well. Very crisp almost tart start, with a little sweet along the sides, but a crisp dry finish. Very nice mouth feel, a little fizzy. The second pour had some sediment that made this beer look like unrefined honey. Big thanks to Jeff for sharing this with me."
"D ~ The brew develops as it warms & is absolutely a beautiful American example of a refined Belgian style. Highly recommended & best shared with close friends. I'm looking forward to more from Lost Abbey."
"taste is smooth yet surprisingly hoppy, does not taste as sweet as it smells, malt, citrus, fruit, some spice, pleasant dry finish."
"The body starts off with moderate taste but finishes with a dry almost crisp finish. Light carbonation helps accentuate this. Overall a great beer for a difficult style to brew. Good job."
"In fact, I think Tomme Arthur is possibly the most versatile and talented commercial brewer in the world, proven capable of remarkably brewing virtually all styles. What impresses me most, perhaps above the funky barrel aged wild ales and hopped-up American brews, is his uncanny ability to capture Belgian ales - this wonderful saison is yet another wonderful example of that."
"Appeared a nice hue of red, very tasty indeed. Spices bounce without overtly declaring themselves. Mouth feel is of a fine moderate fizz that transports the nuances to all areas of the pallate allowing simultaneous epxperience of the elements that create this very drinkable beer. I would def. buy this one again and again."
"Bottle purchased at Ledgers in Berkeley for $7.99. Pours a very nice darker golden with just the tiniest wisp of haze, a very nice head that sticks around, and some excellent lacing. Slightly sweet and somewhat tangy in the aroma, as well as a hint of spice. This smells more like a tripel than a saison, with that hint of sweetness, touch of clove, and bit of yeasty tanginess. The taste has some of those same tripel elements, but the tanginess is a bit restrained and it tastes a bit cleaner, more like a saison, and there is a fairly large hit of white pepper and lighter touch of bitter orange peel right up front. The orange builds a good bit through the taste, as does the pepper, until the finish, which has a bit more rounded yeastiness. Fairly complex, and ultimately to me it comes off as an intriguing blend of tripel and saison with a bit more aggressive spicing than most. Very nice and relatively complex summertime fare. Smooth, spicy, and relatively addictive"
"Corked and caged 750mL bottle poured into a Duvel tulip, like my review of Elysian The Immortal IPA yesterday, it looks like I'm the 100th person to review this beer as well! The beer pours almost exactly like Duvel does into this glass on its bottle, sporting a huge frothy three finger head, I had to wait a bit to try this one, the head lasted throughout as a one finger layer and left decent lacing. Aroma is loads of sweetness and spice, great malt presence, sweet fruits and slight funkiness. The taste is dominated by spice and sweet malts, crisp hops provide a nice spiciness, slight banana and lemon are present as well. The beer is light and crisp with a nice bite of carbonation that provides an easy drinking smoothness. This is certainly one of the best American brewed Farmhouse Ales I've had the pleasure of drinking. I have to say, so far, all the hype I've heard about Port Brewing seems truly justified."
"Served in my Maudite tulip. Poured a hazy orange-gold with a one inch white cap. Head eventually settles into a light slick of foam and bubbles with a solid band evident around the shoulders of the glass. Some loose sheets of lacing evident during the tasting. Spicy nose, as well as the presence of citrus, tart fruit (green apples) and candi sugar. Taste consistent with nose with a slight pucker at the finish. Yeast and clove also expressed in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light- to medium-bodied with lots of effervescence tingling throughout the mouth. Good drinkability, but a little on the sweet side for the style in my opinion. A nice offering nonetheless."
"D: Love Saisons in the summer. This was a good beer but a pain to get my hands on. Hennepin is just as good if not better and much easier to get. Still have not had a bad beer from these guys."
"Drinkability is fine, but it doesn't impress me enough to seek out for a revisit. It was a bit to spicy and boozy to drink with speed or refresh like I look for in the style."
"D: One of the easier offerings to find from the Lost Abbey, it seems to take Dupont as a template and then add its own unique complexity and character to the style. This is one of the best saisons made in America without a doubt, and would work great with a multitude of meals. I really like this beer."
"Overall: Not my cup of tea, but I'll still give it points for good hopping and good finish."
"Notes: My first bottle of Lost Abbey that I've tried proved to be okay. I drank an Angel's Share, but quite frankly don't remember how it tasted. I'm interested in trying some of the others from this highly touted brewery... this one just didn't do it for me... frankly it just makes me wish I had a Hennepin."
"750ml bottle courtesy of KingG, thanks! This pours a beautiful golden orange with a head that quickly subsided into a ring of white bubbles. The aroma is thick with spice but I can't tell you what kind. There is also some orange peel type smell. The flavor has a faint candy quality and some other flavors I can't put my finger on. There seems to a be a hop bitterness and this definitely has a rustic, farmhouse feel to it."
"This is damn good and it hit the spot perfectly on a 95 degree day. Very complex and another amazing offering from Lost Abbey."
"D: Decent drinkability with 6.7%. The 750 won't be too much."
"D - A nice, earthy saison. The low carbonation is a bit off putting to me, but I guess you could think of it as sort of like a cask saison."
"Update June 2009 bottle from my brother Dave, thanks. It's highly cabonated, but a slight funks is there making it finished dry. It is a saison. And the spicy taste is great. Up the flavor score by 1/2."
"Drinkability: this is definitely a sipper. The thing is, I don't think I can stop sipping. A vacation in a bottle..."
"Another good beer from Lost Abbey and one of my favorite American made saisons. Doesn't quite have the funk I enjoy so much from some Belgians but I'm digging it none-the-less. I'd pick up a few of these tonight if Lost Abbey distributed out this way. Thanks again Dana!"
"D: a good saison. I'd have again"
"D - highly drinkable beer, but most saisons are. this beer was enjoyable but wouldn't stand out in a crowd."
"Overall: I love what Lost Abbey does! They brew wonderfu beers that are highly sought after for good reason. Add this one to their world class lineup. I would love to have another bottle for a warm summers night, while relaxing in the hot tub."
"Lucid golden, billowy white head. Nice legs and lacing. Aromas of barnyard belgin yeast funk notes mix with fresh breaked bread, lemon zest and coriander. Taste is smooth with a nice funky bread, spice, and yeast mix going on. Hops are muted. Mouthfeel is zesty, medium bodied, very very drinkable. A nice Saison but not overly complex or amazing. For my money the carnevale kills this one."
"Overall, very nice, flavorful example of the style, but not best of it or from Lost Abbey."
"D: I look forward to having more, the abv is appropriate and not the typical saison in terms of taste, but cant pinpoint why? Still worth getting out and trying this one. First Lost Abbey, wondering what others have to offer."
"Easily the best of the year-round offerings from Lost Abbey (and the others aren't bad...Lost & Found is my favorite dubbel in the US!). This is as near-perfect a saison/beer that I've had in a long, long time."
"As expected, another top shelf offering from Lost Abbey. Don't know if you would find a better US representation of this Saison style. I'd share this with friends over a nice dinner."
"When I first read about The Lost Abbey beers I didn't believe all the hype. Then I spotted them in a little store with a large price tag. When I finally got over my stupidity I learned that The Lost Abbey is one of the best Belgian style brewers we have here in the U.S. Don't waist time like I did. Go get one now!"
"Overall: I have been waiting to try this beer for a long time and the result of my quest does not disappoint. The brew is medium bodied, robust, complex and infinitely drinkable. I say this after drinking this 750ml bottle on my own over the course of a few hours. I'm almost finished with the beer as I write this, and I definitely want more. But there is no more, and I'll have to settle for a glass of water and dreams of visiting the little old STONE brewery (now lost abbey) again one day but seeing everything as new. Drinking it from the Affligem Chalice my younger brother gave me. He gave me the beer as well."
"Notes - Good but not great. Most American breweries seem to have a hard time with saisons, and this one is no exception."
"A bit too much overt spice for my taste, but an enjoyable and very interesting beer."
"Drinkability is sky high. If I could, I would gladly drink drafts of this all day on a sunny day in Coastal California. As it so happens, I'm drinking a lone bottle on a cold, rainy day in New york. Either way, the senses are happy."
"Poured from a bottle into tulip glass. Nice golden/orange color, with huge white bubbly head. Good lacing. Smells of spice (coriander?) Good first full flavor sip. Spices, hops (good bitter feel on sides of tongue). Beer smooths as you drink, settles down nicely. Warms as you go also. Good mouthfeel, and it keeps its flavor long after swallowing. A nice beer to have with a nice dinner."
"Nice complex and refreshing beer. Definitely worth a try. I wish I had another."
"This pours a light peachy yellow with a little bit of a chill haze. Decent head with moderate lace. Nose is of wheat and light malts with some light apple and barnyard funk. First taste, wheat dominates with alot of subtle spice flavors and some maltiness. Slight hop bitterness on the finish. The mouthfeel is quite good and not overly carbonated like some american saisons. Drinkability is very high. A great shot at a saison from a great brewing co. Recommended."
"D - I could have a few glasses without tiring of this brew. Pretty nice."
"Smell is a little funky, earthy, grassy, a little spice in there too. Taste is a bit sweet but has a nice combination of fruityness and grassy/earthiness. Mouthfeel was light and refreshing with moderate carbonation and this was very drinkable. Actually almost too drinkable as it was gone so fast that it was hard to enjoy."
"Pours a foggy gold with a nice white head. Nose is very strong with yeast. Flavor is yeasty as well with a strong dough quality to it and a very tangy edge. Feel is good. Not too thin. Drinkable indeed. A very decent saison, just came off a bit too tangy for my tastes."
"750ml bottle: This one pours a rich, golden color. There was just a hint of haze, and a bit of an off-white head to it. The aroma is very fragrant. Earthy, musty, yeasty and grassy. The taste is very good. Somewhat fruity, grassy, spicy, just a mixed bag working VERY well together. A very good Saison."
"This beer was quite clear with a gorgeous deep gold, orangish hue and generous, fluffy white cap. The head was composed mostly of large bubbles that had great retention and left chunky lace stuck to the glass. Complex aroma with notes of earthy grass, lemon zest, tropical fruit, and delicate malt. There was a bit of mild pepper initially, but this became more of a general spiciness over the course of the bottle. Moderate bitterness, balanced nicely with significant fruitiness, malty base and bready, yeasty middle. It finished with a bit of pepper, then grassy, floral hop bitterness lingered. Medium bodied with carbonation on the high side, the texture was very nice. This beer was solid from start to finish, well balanced with just the right amount of spiciness. Great stuff!"
"Poured into a tasting glass, it had nice head orange color, about what you would expect from this style of beer. The nose is interesting, I read in a previous review that a ""bubble gum"" smell is what hits you initially. I would say that is a very good description, bubble gum, maltiness, cloves and other spices. The taste is a good combination of yeasty spicy malt. This is a good well balanced beer, the mouthfeel and drinkability are on par for the style...good beer"
"D: A likable version of a style I really had little experience with before a trip to Belgium. This compares favorably with some good ones I've had, though can't match the awesomeness of the likes of Dupont and others. Red Barn is one I'll have again I'm sure, especially now that Lost Abbey makes it to Washington (is Oregon next?). Recommended."
"The beer pours a hazy pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a very refreshing citrus aroma with a nice peppery element. The taste is good. It has a smooth pale and wheat malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes with a lemony zest as well as a mild earthiness. This is one of the most enjoyable saisons I've had in some time. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a tremendous beer. It's extremely smooth and loaded with tons of flavor."
"D: All hail Tomme. This beer is a great drink, full of spicy and funky flavors, bitter and tart and delicious. Nicely done!"
"O: Pretty good. I like the Avant Garde more, but this one is also a good brew. Wish the flavor was a little stronger. I think this would be better in the summer as opposed to during this cold snap we're in right now."
"Typical Lost Abbey presentation, Belgian bomber, caged and corked, no freshness info to be had and an artistic label. This one pours clear medium golden amber, with alot of bubbles rising to the top. The head is a rocky long lasting kind of thing, eggshell in color and thick, with spotty, ringed and well developed lacing left behind. Nose is all about a bunch of fresh fruits, some light pepper and Belgian yeasty goodness. Full flavor brew, more fruityness, melon, pears, apples, spice pepper, coriander, honey, bananas, complex and interesting stuff. Lovely final pour, loaded with sediment and nutty yeast. This went great with some peppery goat cheese on toast and some nuts. Agreed, Lost Abbey is into the pantheon of top notch, U.S. brewers..great stuff, go get some and enjoy!"
"I can no longer deny the obvious. Even though I didn't think there was any room, The Lost Abbey (Port Brewing) has exploded into the upper reaches of my 'top-10 breweries in the U.S.' list. They'll almost certainly be a permanent fixture as long as they continue to brew outstanding beer like Red Barn Ale. As far as I'm concerned, Tomme Arthur, Vinnie Cilurzo and Rob Todd comprise the holy trinity of Belgian brewing, American-style."
"I can see why this came so highly recommended. Nothing exciting and firey but very well integrated and balanced flavours do good justice to the saison style, giving it a bit of a new-world flair. Worth a try."
"The beer pours a hazy orange with hints of copper, the 750ml bottle is corked and caged with the head is portly and off white in color, the texture creamy, as it fades to nothingness, the lace provides a concealing sheet upon the glass. Nose is rich in spices, hints of peach, nice malt backing, crisp and fresh to the nose. Start is sweet and malty; the top is moderate in feel. Finish has a nice moderate acidity, hops are present and the fruity sweetness combines with the dry aftertaste, a great series of beers this ""Lost Abbey."
"D - Overall this is a respectible saison style from a local American brewery. Very smooth and easy drinking. I could put down 3 or 4 of these easily. I consider this type of brew my personal ""Coor's Light."" I love that Lost Abbey (aka Port Brewing Co.) is located in SoCal. There beers are excellent and I hope to try more than just their four current styles."
"Went down incredibly easy, stoked to find this on tap"
"Pours a clear golden amber color with a shallow loose white bubbly head that fades fairly quickly. Visible effervescence and some lacing observed. The smell is a fragrant banana-pear yeasty combination. Light bodied, the mouth feel is well carbonated. The inviting flavor is earthy and gently fruity with a peppery spice component. While the mouth finishes dry the pepper flavor lingers. A nice drinker with a lot to consider. The 6.7% ABV is surprisingly warming on the way down, but otherwise well hidden."
"D-This is delicious. I love NYC but right now I miss San Diego. I hope they expand the distribution for this one. Another hit for port brewing."
"Drinkability: This is an exceptional crafted saison that is very easy to pair. Good work Tomme!"
"Very nice orange color with a huge fluffy white head that remains on down the glass. Little bits of ""cream"" are still floating as the glass is almost empty. Earthy, spicy and robust aroma. Great yeasty and spiced flavor. Quite crisp and satisfying. Coriander and black pepper flavors. Very nice mouthfeel-dry and quenching-lively on the tongue. Great beer all around. Really reminds me of the first saison I ever had. I was blown away then and still am by this US version. Great stuff."
"D- This is a good sipper but i couldn't see myself drinking more than one glass at a time. Senses overload with spices that complement the flavor, but take away from the drinkability."
"Poured into a chalice a cloudy golden orange/yellow color, nice carbonation, nice small creamy off-white head, there are some nice small islands and creamy sticky lacing that follows. The nose is malty, yeasty, slight cloves/bannanas, coriander, and slight caramel. The taste is very nice, a nice twist on the style, lot's of malts/yeast, the spice's are not that overwhelming. Medium body. Very drinkable, another awesome brew from the PB/LA guy's."
"Very tasty and drinkable, but missing slightly on the thin somewhat watery mid palate. Nice puckering bitterness on the finish. An enticing belgian spicy factor with sweet melon, and tropical fruits. Pineapple, and passion fruit stand out, with the same papaya as the nose suggested. An easily quaffable beer."
"Drinkability: An exceptional saison that just blows me away with its rich complexity"
"750 mL. Gurgles forth with a robust push of lightly hazed gold, atop a froth of soft soap, fresh with an off-white hue. The aroma precludes a soapy ambiance, with christmas spiced potpourri, warm hexanous aromatics and bubbly cauldrons. Into the mouth, an immediate blast of rising bright fruitiness, meeting headstrong with a mouthful of malt and mild middle eastern spicings. A seemingly classic Saison build, with gentle sweeping malt sugars, high bright and freshening yeast character melding into a pile of nose bristling spice dust. Hops round out the back with a palate closing grassy complexity. If any faults fall upon this beer its that the spices seem a little muddled and artificial, but I think the yeast help cover it. Palate is perfection with a nice light airy body to carry all of the heavenly scents and flavors, through good malt configuration. Delicious."
"Beer poured a golden orange color with a nice white head. Nose is very pleasant, it has hints of fruity malts and spices. Taste is a nice medley of fruits, spices, and finishes with an interesting peppery bite. It is a bit sweeter and perhaps less dry than others I have sampled. Mouthfeel is light bodied but it has that belgian yeast smothness that makes it very nice. Overall drinkabilty is very good. I enjoyed sampling this at AJ's and I am very happy that I tried a full bottle. I believe this is the best American made Saison I have had to date!"
"Bottle: Poured a light beige color ale with a huge foamy head with great retention and lacing. Aroma of funky yeast with some nice spices and light ester. Taste is also dominated by some sweet fruit notes as well as some spices and the funky yeast. Average body with great carbonation. I thought it was a bit too sweet for my own palate but still enjoyable overall."
"An excellent beer from Port Brewing."
"The taste makes me want to keep going back for more. There's enough going on here with the fruitiness, and light malts that don't get boring."
"This beer is surprising and very interesting. The aroma put me off a bit but, like a fine cheese, the flavour more than made up for it."
"But Red Barn is a very, very good beer. I would drink one again in a second, and ahead of most Belgian-brewed beers of the same style."
"This beer pours a deep golden orange with a reliable half inch head. There is a goodly amount of lacing, a moderate amount of carbonation, and a slightly sweet, yeasty smell with a bit of hop tinge. The taste is not quite as sweet as the smell would have you believe. There are some discernible spices, a subtle sweetness, with the best part of this beer happening in the middle. The end and aftertaste is a bit tart with a bit too much of a hoppy bite. This beer is a medium bodied ale, enjoyable, and quite drinkable. L'Chaim"
"750mL bottle sampled in Monk's with mussels on a Saturday afternoon. The color is an opaque gold hue with a tall head. Very pleasant spicy flavors in the mouth, with a hint of citrus. There wasn't much scent associated with the beer though, which may be why it didn't reach that top level of complexity for me. Still, quite drinkable and definitely worth trying. Perhaps I should add that, drinking this beer in Monk's, I'm probably putting it up against some fairly tough standards. As far as American beers in this style go, you can't do much better."
"Poured from a corked and caged 750ml bottle into my tulip glass. Appears a slightly hazy, pale amber-yellow color with about two fingers of fluffy off-white head. Minimal lacing left on the glass. Smells of mild citrus, spicy yeast, and a mild funk. Tastes of spicy, peppery yeast, lemon, and honey. A little thin in body with medium to moderate carbonation. Worth a shot if you can grab some."
"Everything about this beer seems just right for the style and it does it very well. A good saison for those who have a taste for them."
"Drinkability- One of the top american saisons I have had if not the best. Quite quenching and very drinkable. Props to Port Brewing again."
"750 ml. bottle- color of pale gold , with a frothy white head - nose of sour apple (green) , yeast , citrus (bright lemon zest , and orange), grass , spices , and slight candied  taste of sour grass , chalky , cobwebs , candied orange , honey and cloves - body is dry , well carbonated , and slight acidic  aftertaste of orange , yeast , and dry"
"My first from Lost Abbey. Pours an almost too clear gold with a surprisingly short lived head. Whas up with that? Nice smells of very light citrus and pepper. Not much funk. Or more precisely, none. Taste is dominated by that peppery spiciness, and only the slightness sense of sweetness. Mouthfeels seems thin, and even at this low alcohol, that does make an appearance. A buddy I shared this with remarked that this does not seem done. Definately not a favorite in the Saison category for me. This almost seems a higher spiced and alcoholic Witte."
"Orangey amber, topped with a thick puff of white head. Good clarity. The head settles down quickly, diminishing further into a weak collar. Not uncommon with belgian styles. The color is quite attractive, with a soft glow about it. Very spicy aroma, the yeast apparently putting in double shifts to make this thing happen. Peppery and zesty, with a creamy malt underlayer. Some woodsy notes, maybe from hops, but it's hard to tell. Soft peachy fruit, and a bit of clovey spice/phenols. The flavor opens up with a light and bouyant texture, the carbonation tingling with fine bubbles dancing wildly. Initially mild and sweet, kinda dingy in that belgian malt way, just toasty sweetness with a bit of peachy pear fruit, then the finish rides in slightly before its cue, parading about with amusingly garish spiciness. Very peppery and clovey, achieving something akin to a winter warmer in a ginger-root/cinnamon kinda way. I wonder if this is spiced, and with what? Coriander? Kinda witbier-ish too. Strange brew. Adequate sweetness, the balance mostly served through the yeast character, with little discernable hoppage aside from a vague, flowery tint. Ends off slightly dry, with enough residual sugar to keep this just to the side of sweet. Pleasing and enjoyable, if maybe a bit heavy handed with the spiciness. It's like a saison running on jet fuel."
"Sampled at the Monk's Cafe Lost Abbey beer dinner a few nights ago. The beer poured a cloudy orange color with a thick, fluffy white head. The nose of the beer is citrusy (lemon, orange) and has some spice nuances also. The taste is a bit earthy and also has nice touches of the citrus and spice, maybe some corriander. This beer is very smooth and refreshing and makes for a very drinkable beer."
"Drinkability: The spiciness is nice, but limits the drinkability on this one a bit."
"Taste: Solid, solid body that hits you right from the start, only to give way to the spicy, bready yeast flavors in the middle, and cuts dry with a resinous hop finale. Carbonation is just the way I like it, vivid and tingly. I'm a sucker for Saisons, this one hit all the right buttons for me."
"Received in a trade from BA Dogfoodog, this Lost Abbey brown bomber was caged, corked, and had a painting of a red barn basking in a sunny summer day. The beer came out peach colored, and very cloudy, and the head atop it was craggy and durable. The smell was light and floral, and not a lot of spices were detected in the nose. Typical of the American versions of the style, earthy yeastiness was mostly absent as well. Taste was sweeter than most authentic Belgian Saisons, with floral and herbal flavors from the added ingredients attempting to balance things out. Delicious overall, but had they used a strain of yeast that ate up more of the residual sugars and dried the flavor up more, this would have been a lot more refreshing. I am thinking this beer is more of appropriate for fall than summer. Thicker than anticipated mouthfeel and carbonation was medium at best. A very charming, but off the style Saison."
"Easy to drink Saison but I don't really think that this is as good as Saison Dupont or Hennepin."
"Overall: I have never been disapointed with anything that Tomme Arthur has made. This is no exception. This beer is great. Tomme should be brewing in Belgium."
"This would be very, very refreshing on a summers day."
"Poured in a heavy glass chalice, formed a 1/2"" beige head over the almost clear golden amber brew. Head falls gradually, with average lacing. Aroma is spicy, with fruity tartness tickling the nose as well. Taste follows the nose pretty well, spicy malt sweetness upfront, with a bit of fruit, and then some tartness enters and carries on through the aftertaste. Kind of muddied a bit for me. Mouthfeel is ok, a bit prickly though, and drinkability goes along in the same vein. Not quite all I expected here, but still a solid and interesting offering."
"This would be a great beer on a nice warm spring/summer day, or any day in San Diego. Wouldn't appeal to much to me in the cold desert during the winter."
"It's a very tasty ale and enjoying one is a great pleasure but one glass is enough for me."
"Very decent beer, I do think it is better than some (not all) belgian saisons currently being made. Another very well-crafted offering from Port Brewing."
"Notes: While I like a light saison to ring in the hotter seasons this seems more suited as a nightcapper. Not a knock in the slightest but just for my notes I would enjoy this more off season."
"The taste has much of the same flavor with some fruity apple notes. It's fairly sweet and tangy overall. Light and foamy mouthfeel, with forceful carbonation. The drinkability is decent, I was expecting a more impressive Saison, however, considering the price ($9~) and Port Brewing's reputation. I would have liked it to be a little drier, with some more complexity. Not bad, and it certainly won't keep me from trying the other Lost Abbey brews..."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors"
"D- Very easy to drink like all other saisons. Kind of scary when I have a whole growler ahead of me. Very refreshing and smooth. Follows the style well (like I said above). Just a really good beer."
"This is one of the most intriguing beers I have had in quite some time. Not sure how drinkable it is, but I would gladly have another."
"Mouth: Exactly like smells, with addition of white grape and some alcoholic ethers and warmth. Sweet malt notes, yeast, and a hint of grassy hops that creates a surprisingly dry finish. Only let down is the mouthfeel: weaker carbonation that thins more so as it passes through. However, flavor is so good it's still very drinkable."
"Very delightful saison. One of the better ones out there. Many thanks to lou91 for sending this delicious beer."
"Bottom line: This is a *wonderful* Saison from yet another small brewery in California."
"Fantastic!"
"D: Sort of a triple/saison blend. Very well balanced between citrus, spice and funk. Quite enjoyable."
"Last swigs: One of the top 5 unique saisons I've ever tried. I just wanted to glug this down with its bold richness. To describe the diference between this and Saison Dupont, I'd say this is sugary sweeter and less bone jarring dry, but some similarities are inescapable."
"Worth hanging around for more of this.."
"Note: this is basically the same recipe as the ""Pizza Port"" SPF 45 and will be available from the Lost Abbey and all Pizza Port locations soon."
