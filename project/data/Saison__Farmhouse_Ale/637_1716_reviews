"Can't taste how boozy this feels like it should be. Great example of a saison though. A rustic sourness happening here that I'm into."

"Overall - A very nice saison from one of the best when it comes to that style.  The high alcohol presence and a bit too much bitterness prevent it from having a higher score.  4 paws."

""
""
""

""

"Overall - This is a great beer, I liken it to an amped up version of Saison Dupont and I will definitely seek it out again."

"Poured a clear amber orange body with no head and minimal white lacing. A unique looking saison, a portent of things to come. Scents of alcohol mingle with fruity esters of apricot, orange flesh, and aromatic floral hops with a note of jasmine, notes of sugar cookie and some light peppery aromas. Overall impression is of a bigger, strong saison, with more alcohol than traditional, but many of the traditional aromas nicely present and balanced well. Unique yet traditional, a good saison aroma. Flavor begins nicely balanced, a mix of sweet and bitter, with notes of alcohol, orange flesh, herbal hops. Middle is medium in sweetness with the same flavors as the beginning, but with a bit more alcohol. Finish is medium dry, with notes of alcohol, floral and herbal European hops, citrus flesh and peel and white pepper. Aftertaste is alcohol, floral hops and white pepper. Overall impression of taste is of a very nice saison. Strong in alcohol, but traditional in other ways. A good unique saison, brimming with flavor. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation and a lightly acidic feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a saison that is a bit less traditional, but still good. Overall this is a good saison. A wonderful aroma and flavor that are unique yet traditional saison with the same in mouthfeel. A good saison that is quite well executed."

"I have had this both on tap and in bottles. In bottles the natural carbonation stands out more and the tap version tends to be served too cold. Releasing the cork frees wisps of fruit, bread, light apricot, funky yeast and earthy aromas. It pours hazy gold with a very slight orange tint under a 1” milky white, finely bubbled foam cap that persists and leaves rich lace. This has a rich malty, bready backbone lightly sweetened with caramel providing an excellent base for yeast driven fruit - apricot, orange blended with a dash of yeasty funk as it crosses the tongue. Light earthy hops provide balance on the finish and lead to long, lingering fruit flavors. This has a creamy texture with a medium to medium full body and above average carbonation. This comes in a brown bottle so it has less chance of getting skunky than Saison Dupont and some of their other green bottled beer."

"On tap at Armsby Abbey in Worcester, MA. Great find. Attractively transparent. One finger sticky head. Smell is tepid, very similar to regular Dupont. Taste is the redeeming quality, much more depth and room to explore. Hay and farmhouse flavors galore. Noticeable booze on the finish justified the price tag. Carbonation works in concert with the flavor profile. Tasty rarity."

"I saved this bottle for New Year's Eve, but everyone I was with had switched to drinking wine and I ended up polishing the whole thing off myself. Nothing but praise for this beer. I might even be underrating it but I'd like to have it again before giving it even higher marks. Outstanding beer, highly recommended."

"Tastes like a big, dry, bannana, and clove dominant heffe."
"Mouth watering sweet and fruity nose. Lots of spicy goodness here, coriander and peppercorn, light fruit esters, banana and orange? Nice earthy flavors but backed up with a nice sweetness. Definitely a lot going on here, and it all works great together. Very pretty beer as well, nice fluffy white head and a hazy golden body, some sediment in here. Like saison dupont plus, much better I'd say. Some bitter grassy hops in there as well."

"Sort of a bigger version of DuPont with a large portion of banana esters and cloves. Certainly another above-average beer from DuPont and reminds me how they just own Saisons."

"Taste reveals an unbelievable smooth mouthfeel, due to a huge amount of Belgian yeast, which puts a pillow on the palate. On top of that, warm stingy spices amongst black pepper build up a fascinating complexity, which results in a medium dry finish, with subtle vanilla notes. Very easy to drink, alcohol is present at no point at all, very intriguing, well balanced beer. Bretts among metallic, lively carbonation are responsible for a supporting sour- and dryness, which underlines the slick. spicy yeast impression just perfect. As I am drinking a young bottle, bretts are recognizable only for a short period of time, mingled together with copper flavor. When those leave the palate, dough malts and supersmooth mouthfeel do become even more present."

"4.15/5: If any other brewer do saisons better than Dupont, I haven't found them yet"

"01/15/14 From bottle at Rattle n Hum, NYC. I Love This Beer!!!. The mystery is how it is so aromatic...almost perfumy...but the flavors are all so subtle. Seductive. Typical yeast-up-front Belgian character with a truly refined touch. I Love This Beer!!!"

"I'm really not a fan of Dupont at all, but I panicked and ordered this one up, seeing nothing else that really grabbed my attention that particular afternoon. Golden-yellow color, pretty much clear, with a small white head on top that displayed good retention and lacing. In the aroma, lots of dry herbs and some barnyard funk. Lots of spice in the taste, coriander, rosemary, oregano, earthy funk, stale grains, manure, solventy booze. Just wasn't digging it. Pretty much like any other Dupont saison I've had, with an upped spice profile. Medium body, mostly dry mouthfeel, but overall uncomfortable, and really hard to drink. I like saisons a lot, but this one was not good."

"Bottled in 2008 and this beer held up extremely well. A bit of sediment and opened with a huge 'pop' but decanted clear. Great taste. Full. Amazing amount of brett noticeable. Some heat but very well attenuated. It's an experience to drink the beer at the brewery (with the toilets in the back by the cows) but you can always find perfect examples of the beer in bottles too!!"

"Overall - Really superb. Complex and very drinkable."
"Overall - An interesting high ABV saison with a good mix of flavours. The vanilla/coconut type flavour gets a little tired with a 750ml format - but still a very solid brew well worth trying and perfect for sharing."

"Refreshingly sour, funkier, hoppier than average and tasty Saison. Highly recommended for who likes the style or wants to adventure."

"Overall this a great saison. Nothing bash, just a finely tweaked belgian iteration. Getting back to the roots with this one."
""

"O: well balanced saison, the carbonation was a little high, but a very tasty farmhouse ale."
""
"A clear brilliant bronze yellow color with virtually no head or lacing and few signs of life short of a few bubbles here and there. Pretty but looking a little limp. The aroma brings out a satisfying apple grain blend and hints of alluring spice clove and allspice. Promising. The palate quickly enjoys a sturdy apple clove hop with sweet cereal grain with a tasteful yeast idea to balance it off. It does have a lazy carbonation to it which opens up into a fuzzy feel that more than adequately delivers this tasty holiday treat in good order. Body is medium full and it sticks to your ribs just a bit for a saison style but the relatively high ABV is not overwhelming at all. A wonderful treat."

"Poured from a 375 ml bottle. Pours a hazy lemony yellow colour. Nose is filled with tons of vinous, fruity notes: lemon, fruit cocktail, canned pears. Taste is similarly fruity with pear notes, spicy pepper and a huge drying bitter finish. Bottle-conditioned and very aggressively carbonated."
""
""
""
""
"Just amazing, and again, this is coming from someone who's not a huge saison fan to begin with. My scores reflect my sense that the style itself is rather limited, if on the other hand you like saisons, boost the score upward accordingly."

"A solid saison. Slightly more bitter than normal, but decently balanced overall."
""
""
""
"Pours a light straw yellow. Nose shows citrus zest, Brett, funk and spiced yeast. Taste is light zest, mild citrus/funk and some farmhouse yeast. Hint of burnt sugar there too. Not overly sweet either. Highly carbed. The cork blew off after the cage was removed."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled 4/30/2012. Pours fairly hazy and cloudy golden amber color with a 3 finger foamy and rocky white head with incredible retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Thick foamy lacing clings around the glass, with plenty of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Amazing appearance. Aromas of big lemon zest, apple, pear, pepper, clove, grape, herbal, floral, grass, bread, light funk, and floral/yeast earthiness. Incredible aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast ester notes with a light malt balance; and good strength. Taste of big lemon zest, apple, pear, pepper, clove, herbal, floral, grass, light funk, bread, and floral/yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, pepper, clove, herbal, floral, grass, light funk, bread, and floral/yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and balance of fruity/spicy esters with a light malt balance; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. High carbonation and medium bodied; with a very crisp, dry, and prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden for 9.5% with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a world class saison! Incredible balance and complexity of fruity/spicy esters with light malt balance; and extremely crisp to drink for the alcohol level. Absolutely insane."

"01-27-2013 update: On tap at Chapter One in Santa Ana. This tap version is totally anemic in carbonation, which makes it taste like some kind of sweet and scratchy Southern fruit wine. Makes me think of corn, sourish pear skins, and a hint of Quarante Y Tres vanilla liqueur. I'd rank it lower than the bottle version I reviewed."

"D- an amazing strong saison with more overall character than the weaker versions I've had from DuPont (vielle, avril) although naturally the strength begets less drinkability. An incredible beer and well worth the $11 price tag."

"Flavors of floral hops, candy sugar, coriander, grassy hops, light pepper and herbs, some astringency. While this bottle is, I'm guessing, a tad past prime it's nonetheless very tasty, and my numerous experiences with this beer fresh and aged have always been positive. Very flavorful, full bodied, complex and satisfying."

"Wonderful saison, certain to please those who like spice forward and lightly funky, certain to disappoint those looking for the crazy funk or the extreme tart characters of some saison yeasts."
""
""
""

"I know a number of beer geeks around San Diego that put this into their top-5 brews.   It deserves any hype it receives...in the 40-some years since this has been produced it tastes like the brewers have taken the potentially disparate flavors of a saison and arranged them perfectly, making this as quaffable as they come."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one of the best looking brews you will have. It doesnt quite hit on the taste though. But it is very good."
"Drinkability: Pretty good stuff, though the taste disappoints. I think I would much rather drink this during the summer than the holiday season, though."
""
"O - one of my favorite holdiay beers and one of the best saison style ales. One everyone should try."
""
""
"Draught @ Monks: This one pours a hazy orangish color. There was almost no head and no lacing. The nose is very nice. Many varied fruits coming through, but no real sweetness. Actually a hint of sourness to the fruits. The taste is very good. Some dryness and bitterness, and a hint of sourness also. Subtle fruits, hints of spices. Exceptionally smooth . Very nice!"

"O-All in all, this was an enjoyable saison, and one that I did not feel out of place drinking in December in the mountains. (I'm typically a very seasonal drinker, so saisons are not my go-to in the winter). I'm not sure if it was that much better or worse than a regular Dupont, but it was slightly different, so points for that. I could see this pairing nicely with turkey and stuffing."
""
""
"I recommend picking this up and opening it immediately. After all, you can't wait very long with a green bottle."
"2012's is better than the last two years, in my opinion. A great early holiday season ale."
""
"Single finger head with excellent lacing on a cloudy golden body. Very light aroma with mostly lemon, wheat and yeast. Flavor is more on the musty, herbal side with hints of clove, lemon tartness finishing with bitter hops and grains and wheat. This one is very oily coating the palate with a very dry finish. Light body and moderate carbonation. Not very fruity. Not as drinkable and many saisons. Worth trying but wouldn't have again."
""
""
""
""
"O- All the basics of saisons are there, but in a stronger, bolder version, in terms of body, mouthfeel, maybe even complexity. It may feel on the point of being a little too much, but it never really gets over the top. Plain good stuff, worth a plain good 4"
""
""
"O: A pleasant beer that perhaps would have benefited from better timing on my part. However, even with or after food, I don't think it has the backbone to support the high alcohol content, leaving the beer fundamentally out of balance."
""
""
"O- This drinks very easy, and the 9.5% is completely unnoticable. One of my all time favorite saisons, even if it is pretty high in alcohol for the style!"
""
"O- A great saison, its fruity, yeasty and spicy aspects are all awesome and delicious, I'd be happy drinking this at any time of the year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-a nice Saison in keeping with the quality of their standard Saison, would drink this again"
""
""
""
"O- Always so worried when I buy green glass imports since they rarely have freshness dates, especially since I got burned on a bottle of Biere de Miel I purchased at Whole Foods. Luckily, I went with my gut when I saw this on the shelf at one of the bottle shops I frequent which I hadn't seen there when I last visited maybe a month before. This easily makes it into my top ten Saisons. Satisfying in every department."
""
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a snifter. White, fluffy head, excellent retention on a hazy, opalescent golden body. Suddsy lacing, sticky. Aroma is white peppery spicy, wispy, fruity/banana, candi sugary and yeasty. Taste is light and refreshing, mild tartness, slightly sweet, lots of banana and some spiciness. Nice feel as the beer rides on the tongue, cleansing. The alcohol is no where in the smell or taste, amazing. Delicious."
"D - A mixed bag... Very nice appearance and aroma give way to slightly disappointing taste, mouthfeel and overall drinkability... I can't say it's a bad beer, but it's definitely a bit rough around the edges and not one I would either recommend nor partake in again except perhaps the rarest of situations..."
""
""
"O- Like a citrus, ethanol infused pilz, as if someone poured lighter fluid into a summer pils. As it warms the ethanol fades to the back and the pils aroma turns to a grainy tortilla like aroma, with lemon. Though a decent beer, i find it hard to finish the entire bottle, and i don't see myself buying it again."
"Poured into a Gouyasse tulip glass. Pours a light golden amber with a half glass white head that dissipates slowly to pillowy foam and massive lacing. Aroma of light malt, lemon, saison yeast; grassy. A hint of skunk initially on pouring. Flavor is spicy light fruit and mellow citrus, slightly buttery and grassy. Finish is dry with a spicy bitterness and residual light fruit. Light bodied with a great mouth feel from peppery carbonation. A very nice saison with subdued wild yeast, pleasant fruit and malt. Alcohol was warming, but well covered. I'll have to get this every winter."
"O - I really wanted to like this beer more than I did. It had nice flavors and I enjoyed it but could have used a bit more yeast and less pilsner malt."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer's body is medium-light to medium, with high, aggressive levels of carbonation. While the carbonation level is typical of some saisons, I don't find it particularly conducive to enjoying the beer as it produces an overly fizzy, at times annoying long-tingling, then finally bubbly mouthfeel that may also obscure some flavors/aromas. Similar to champagne, in overall feel. Ethanol noticeable on tongue, in nostrils, and on back of throat. Finishes semi-dry, with lingering ethanol burn on throat."
""
"O - A good beer, but for me, the extra hops flavor and bitterness are a distraction rather than an enhancement for this strong saison. The metallic tang is too disruptive to me."
"Drinkable given that it's a 10% saison. Interesting, what a treat."
""
""
"Got this bottle in a BIF. Excited to crack it open. Looks nice. About an inch and a half of fluffy white head with ok retention. A few spots of lacing stay on the glass, but not too much. The body is golden and hazy. Aroma is nice. Fruity, floral, a bit spicy, and candied citrus peel without the sweet. Flavor is grassy, floral, citrusy, and spicy. Mouthfeel is right on. Light, med-high carb, dry, very nice. I had no problem drinking the whole 750 by myself, was very easy drinking and very enjoyable, but not really remarkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A special Saison brewed for the holidays, and perhaps for the winter, as it touts a hefty punch. Not sure if the extra alcohol does it much justice though. Clearly it’s a decent sip, but more of a sharing and pairing offering, as it seems bit lost on its own."

""
""

"Near perfect Belgian saison."
""
"750 ml caged and corked bottle, 2011 printed on the cork. Served in a Unibroue tulip, the beer pours a cloudy gold color with a couple inch frothy off-white head. Head retention is excellent, and there's a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is fruity and yeasty, it smells like apricots, lemon peel, hay, peppery spice and some banana. Taste is similar to the aroma, the brew tastes like hay, peppery spice, lemon and orange peel, pears, earth and some bready malt. There's more bitterness in this brew than I was expecting. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and creamy, and is very well carbonated. The 9.5% ABV isn't very noticeable at all. I liked this brew, I'd recommend this one to others. $11.49 a bottle."
"This beer would pair fantastically with curry or Mediterranean food— namely lamb and tzatziki sauce. In terms of seasons, this brew would be satiating year-round. The spiciness makes it compelling in cooler months, but it’s so light and refreshing that I’d gladly bring it out to the pool with me."
"edit: just had a 2007 vintage of this, and its changed a lot. lots of the sugars have seemed to congeal, making it thicker and sweeter, while the carbonation is tamed a little as well, and that airy lightness is gone. the alcohol is also tamer too, never would guess its as strong as it is. I think age has done some good things for this beer, but I have to confess to enjoying the fresh version a bit more."
""
""
"O - Not bad, a little heavier then I was expecting"
""
""
""
""
"Taste isn't that great either. Earthy malts but metallic flavors too. Mouthfeel is a bit bubbly but isn't that exciting. This beer isn't that enjoyable, especially given the excellent style it comes from."
""
""
"O: Whoa this is a big boy. Avec les Bons Voux really stands out in this style being more bold while staying 'mostly' true to form. Highly recommended... once in a while : )"
""
""
""
""
""
"Big pilsner malt base, with loads of fruity yeast esters. Hops are grassy and mild, finishes peppery and semi-dry. Very good overall. Pretty high ABV for the style but drinks good."
"O: Fantastic Saison, I'd have to put it near the top of my list. I would buy this again."
""
"O: This beer has no presence of alcohol and is extremely enjoyable - I love a good saison and this beer does not disappoint. Very easy to drink and definitely one I would like to get again. I could drink this beer all day long and find it to be very refreshing."
"O: Considering its strength among other beers in the style, this beer isn’t that difficult to drink because the alcohol is well masked from the taste. It is a nice saison to drink on a cold winter night."

"overall: really impressive - A+ value"

"D - I quite enjoy this one. I will seek it out again."
""
""
""
"A delicious and unique farmhouse, this is the first of the style I've had with such a distinct vegetable bitterness. I don't dislike it, although I'm not sure I prefer it, but it certainly doesn't ruin the beer in any way. Totally enjoyable experience, would definitely have again, although maybe not before some other saisons."
""
""
"3.0 D: If this tasted like the nose, I would certainly be impressed. It’s still a good beer, but it isn’t the standout I was expecting."
"O: A very nice beer I'm happy to have happened upon."
""
"I find with nearly every Saison I have, it takes a good chunk of time to fully appreciate its complexities. And from the nose to the feel that's what I had to do and it's well worth it. The highlights for me were the underlying notes of vanilla and sweet clemintine peel and the creamy and rich body. A near perfect traditional Saison."
"Overall this is a good showing of the style and is very drinkable dispite the heavy alcohol content... Cheers~!"
""
"O: Very drinkable despite the 9.5%ABV. Absolutely great beer"
"Overall, quite a nice saison. Very good. Almost gave it a 4.5 in taste."
""
"O - A well executed saison from Dupont. This is my go-to saison."
"Pours a hazy matte orange, with generous carbonation. Brilliant white head with great amount of lacing left behind along with a solid amount of retention. Nose is fruity and spicy, some banana, peach and passionfruit. Yeasty with significant notes of clove and light pepper. Taste has similar exotic fruits and tropical notes, yeasty and gently spicy and peppery in the finish. Complex fruitiness and malts notes are prevalent throughout. Drying finish and sweet with only the slightest suggestion of alcohol. Perfect carbonation - high, but 'fuzzy' in texture on the tongue, just an absolutely fantastic sensation. Immensely satisfying, a gorgeous, complex and flavourful saison."
"D: Could easily drink this all night long. True to the style, this is both very refreshing and natural tasting. Very impressed."
"Overall, worth trying."
""
"Pours a hazy orange color with a very pillowy, 3 finger head that never fades. Smells of pines, citrus, and soap. Taste is pretty light but enjoyable. Citrus fruits come through as well as some hop flavors. Very good tasting beer. Medium bodied with good carbonation. Overall this is one of the best saison's I have had. Very good and will look to cellar some in the future."
""
""
"O: Liked it, but didn't love it. It impresses me that they could get the beer up to 9.5%, but it doesn't make me want to have it. Would much rather have a smoother saison that is down in the 5-6% range."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Accidentally chilled this one too much and had to wait a few minutes before I could really start appreciating the taste and aroma. Achieves a good balance between heft and delicacy. I'd definitely pick this up again, though I'd probably save it for a milder day."
""
""
"Overall: this was a great beer. A great representation of a Belgium Saison. Cant Wait till next holiday season in order to get another bottle!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Lots of nice sunny fruit joins with stone, earth, and a nice spicy finish. This beer has some alcohol warmth, but the alcohol is well blended. A very enjoyable beer to sip, but it is a bit heavy despite the carbonation zing."
""
"O: Definitely a kickass saison. I know some people don't like the ""skunky"" aromas, but once you sip it, its nothing of the sort. Can't wait to try another one in a few months."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is bubbly and effervescent with a nice crisp finish. Overall, a tasty saison but the slight hint of skunk throws it off just a bit. Still however, happy to enjoy as I ring in the new year."
""
""
""
""
"O- quite tasty saison,highly drinkable with a slight funk"
""
""
"This is a nice orange-spiced saison, and with a 9.5% ABV, it is a winter warmer and definitely a good beer for the holidays. With the orange acidity, it will cut through the heavy cookies and fruit cakes. But I could drink this beer whenever I want a fruity higher ABV saison. It was a good decision to scoop these in the summertime, my only question is why did I wait till the holidays to crack one open?"
"O: Awesome Saison. Definitely becoming one of my favorite styles. Give this a try."
"O: Good beer. The standard in my opinion for the saison style."
""
""

"On tap, Dupont's beers are excellent. In bottle, they can still be decent but not worth the $10+ to enjoy a tarnished defective beer."
"Drinking Dupont’s saison style Bons Vœux is guaranteed to bring best wishes to you and all you share it with! Available in a 750ML bottle, there is plenty to pour in a few glasses; however, you will be tempted to keep it all to yourself. Hell, there’s always next year for sharing!"

"O: Very, very impressive. Such a complex beer with so much going on, but in a fairly easy to drink beer. I could use a touch more of the citrus I originally got in the aroma, but I'm splitting hairs."
""
"Overall, another world-class saison from Brasserie Dupont."
""
"Overall- It is a very respectable saison.I would have liked more going on on the palate that wasn't just so straightforward yeast character. More fruits or grain, something. The feel is also a little off. I would certainly have it again."

"pours a golden yellow with some haziness. Its well carbonated and has a tall massive foam cap thats quite dense, but leaves littt]le lacing. Aroma is funky laced with pale malts yeast and earth. Taste was similar to a tripel in that it was semi-dry and spicey but also had some saison aspects like corrinder and lemon juice. Thin on the paleete. Not a lack of alcohol i can detect. It's almost ten, thats pretty good. All in all not bad, I would need to drink a few more ( on different occasions) to settle into it."

"Yikes. Drinking this from draught has I type. Never had this beer before. The standard saison from Dupont is one of my all time favorite beers and this ""super"" version is not disappointing. Hazy blonde with much head. Aromas of lemons, honey and faint bananas. Tastes amazing! Super saison indeed. Big citrus zest and sourdough flavours. Hoppier than I was expecting which is fine by me. Finishes slightly sweet for a saison, but is rather dry considering it's 9.5% abv. Yeah, good stuff."
"Overall, a good strong Saison."
"Pours a hazy light yellow with a 1/2 inch white head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Small streaks of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is somewhat subtle with grains, spices, and some fruity aromas. Taste is of grains, spices, and fruity grape-like flavors. This beer has a crisp mouthfeel with a slightly acidic quality to it. Overall, this is a good saison with some nice spice and fruit aspects."
"O - overall, a very nice brew, and very glad that I got to try it. Had at a special tasting at Brix wine and beer store in Omaha. Cheers!"

"O: Very funky and very earthy with dominant fruit flavors of pear and golden delicious apple. Good amount of coriander in the finish. Alcohol extremely well hidden. Very welcoming and warming Saison. Certainly makes a great beer for any season."

"O – A rich and complex beer. It’s one that keeps you thinking with every sip."

"Poured from a bomber into a standard pint glass. This beer pours to a wheat/straw color with a foamy white head that has some staying power. But the first thing you notice about this beer is the smell--it's wheaty and yeasty with a hint of orange, and is very pleasant. Taste is wheaty and malty--textured with some spices and an aftertaste of spicy orange. The sharp initial sip is balanced by the creamy mouthfeel and the lingering citrus taste. The one criticism is the 9.5 abv is noticeable."

"Overall: Nice beer, but will never be my favorite"
"Light orange/amber pour with a great lacy head. Aromas of melon, cotton candy and candied fruit. Taste follows the expected Dupont profile. Though feeling light in body at 9.5% alcohol this one is a thumper. Very good though for my palate I prefer the regular Saison Dupont."
"This is the strongest of a string of similar offerings, being - in ascending order of ABV: Saison Dupont, Cervesia and La Biere de Beloeil. While the charisma of the Dupont yeast strain ensures it's a yummy beer, I can't credit a single positive attribute that the higher ABV contributes. Instead, it merely lowers the drinkability."

"Nice layering of flavors in this beer - traditional yeasty funk in moderation, some breadyness offset with a bit of acidity. Apple notes, a bit green at first, fading to Golden Delicious toward the end. A little pepper finishes up with some bite from the alcohol."
""
"Overall: This was a very smooth beer for the abv. I would have liked it more if there were a little less grape flavor. I'd be happy to drink this again."
"O. Really nice Saison. Sweeter than most. I am partial to the style, but this is a good beer for sure."
"T - a big beer all around, champagne like feel and flavours, a very fine example of this style"
"O - Excellent saison which I highly recommend."
"Lots of herbals! Deep, but without much in the way of yeasty funk or wax. A superior saison."
"Overall, nice tasting beer. I was expecting a little more in the way of flavor. Or perhaps this beer could be a little better with a sour funk."
"This beer poured out as a slightly hazy looking yellowish color with a fluffy white head on top. The smell of some light barbyard aromas are in there along with some funk and floral breadiness. The taste of the beer is yeasty and has a light amount of lemon to it. The mouthfeel is well carbonated and bubbles up a lot in your mouth. Overall this beer is quite good. Definetly worth trying."
"O: If I told you this beer was anything less than fantastic, I would be lying. Absolutely buys this beer. In fact, buy multiple bottles or even cases. Just great."
"This is an excellent Saison and an exceptional summer beer. Quite delicious on all dimensions."
"It is my humble opinion that this is one of the best Saisons available. If you see this beer, buy it. Lots of it."
"O - I can't really find any faults in this one, and I may actually like it better than their standard Saison. That being said, I'm not sure I find anything incredibly original with it either. It's just a really good, belgian beer with a really high ABV. It's certainly a sweeter offering than many Belgians as well.. so if you are looking for slightly sweeter in the Belgian style this is a good choice."
"O- Fairly disappointing. There was overall too much of the strong flavors that completely overtook what I love in a saison..."
"Overall, its fine, not as good as the regular."
"O-A great alternative to the sweet, sometimes syrupy Belgian holiday ales. My favorite DuPont beer."
"O: Very easy to drink but a strong ass farmhouse. I like the style for taste and drinkability so thie booze on this takes it down in enjoyability and drinkability for the style."
"The sweetness vs dryness is very nice. The mustiness sort of mellows over time. Overall, this is pretty good, though not quite as good as the Dupont."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the Belgian style Saison."
"It had a finger of bone-white head with low retention, falling even as it was set in front of me. Color was a cloudy lemon-yellow, chiffon-like and reminding me of sunshine in a glass on that cold, snowy day. Nose was dry - papery, peppery and a solid reminder of why I love Saison yeast! It imparted a dry, dusty, mildly spicy taste on the tongue and although it may have been their version of a Winter/Christmas ale, I'd break this out in the summer months. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium. Finish was slightly dry and very refreshing. Absolutely yummy!"
"The cork came out rather easily then I was hit in the face with sour apple like aromas. It pours light to medium in body with a nice creamy gold in color with a two finger white soapy head. It smells of sweet pale malts, light honey, very aromatic spices, with a slight tart and dry finish. It tastes of sweet pale malts, light honey, moderate spice, with a nice yeasty and lightly funky finish. It has really nice flavor and the 9.5% is nowhere to be found. It drinks pretty smoothly and leaves behind a nice aftertaste of sweetness a nice amount of spices. Overall this is a very nice saison and worth your while."
"Overall one of the most flavorful Saisons I've had. I good deal of flavor but still refreshes in the classic summer fashion."
"Appears as clear golden body that gets hazed and full of floating yeast-particles with the consecutive pourings, topped by rocky, long lasting white head. The nose is soft pale malt sweetness, fruity esters of pear and apple, peppery spiciness that I couldn't tell where originates from (hops, actual spices added or yeast-derived phenols, or any combination of those listed) and faint tartness underneath. There's a tinge of soft, spicy alcohol. Flavor is discrete pale malt sweetness embedding the evident tartness that interplays with peppery spiciness. A touch of funk. Finish is dry with evident hop bitterness. Medium bodied, effervescent. (750 ml, into tulip.)"
"Man, talk about a beer I could have with almost any dinner. Once again proving to me why Saisons are the king of styles when it comes to food. Get ahold of this one if you can."
"O/D - I loved this one. Hoppy and sweet yet funky as well. Just alot of everything I look for in a saison and the ABV adds to the complexity. No hint of alcohol is noticable making this easy to drink and very enjoyable."
"( 43/50, 9.5% alc/vol, Home) Lacey white-orangey head of HUGE proportions and a mixed bubble size. Chunky head dropping slowly but surely. Ale itself is a greenish yellow. Good carbonation helps keep the head fluffy and light. Golden brown powdery sediment floats forever in the golden hues. Smells like the best gueuzes, even down to the acidic hops character. Oak barrels, barnyard, cotton candy, mushrooms, with a tart citric, unripe apple character. Wonderfuly complex, yet a tad too tart for the nostrils. Has a sulfuric and vanilla depth, leading to an alcoholic end. Huge yeasty vanilla flavours exploding in a multitude of voices: strawberry, acidic, almost lambic oaky sourness, white chocolate, french fries, belgian candi sugar… it is so complex and deep. I was not expecting this at all. The middle to end is strongly cloying and on-the-side sour and ends up being a little overly bitter-acidic. But other then keeping this from being perfect, it serves only to bring up some acid, some tart, some sweet all in a well built package. Wow. Warm, tart, acidic, then sweet, dry and finishes fruity, like sour apples, with a sweet tooth in the end. Has it all. Huge carbonation, with just a tad of bitterness that takes aback before the dry finish. Fresh, complex beyond belief. Just a tad too sour-bitter for my tastes. But then again it keeps it light, playful and brings out the lambic-like oak vanilla-madeira flavours that serves it so well. A huge classic. Try to pour carefully as it gets more cloying with the sediment."
"Drinkability: At 9.5, a bit too much to drink much of, but just a joy otherwise and (at my local store, anyway) $10 a bottle? A STEAL. Great beer on all levels."
"Overall: Great saison; one of my favorites. Good second fiddle if Fantome is not available. If it had a touch more funk and less alcohol it would be perfect."
"D: This was an excellent saison that wasn't too complex but was very crisp and enjoyable. The alcohol was well hidden, and the body was superb. So it was very easy to drink, but is best to sip. Very nice beer."
"D: Pretty archetypal, if too alcoholic technically. Worth the money, for sure."
"D: A fantastic Saison... delicious. Dangerously easy to drink despite the high ABV. Something I would definitely seek out again."
"D: surprised when I saw how strong this is given how drinkable it is, outstanding beer that has lot of sweet, fruity & yeast qualities without any of them getting too much & distracting, wonderfully balanced"
"Pours a nice hazy blonde with a big head and good lace. The aroma is a bit soapy but this is made up for by the nice lemony and hoppy notes along with a nice fruitiness. The flavor is very dry and spicy with some good citrus rind, mineral. and hoppy notes. There is certainly some of the alcohol character in there as well. It's very good but doesn't have the sort of finesse that many other Dupont products do, perhaps I need to try it again."
"D - Probably the best Saison I habve had to date with the exception of Fantome"
"D: A terrific saison from a great brewery. Recommended."
"Why bother with champagne when you can drink this? One of my ultimate favorites."
"D: Very high. Alcohol is masked very well and the taste is delicious."
"Notes: Really nice saison. I think the overly strong tart and bitterness combined with the high ABV provide the slight downfall for this beer. It is incredibly refreshing, zesty, and lively beer to drink. Really good saison that has a slight funky flavor. Nice mix of complex flavors."
"I probably represent a minority of one in saying this, but Avec Les Bons Voeux is not my ideal saison. While an interesting offering, the impression I took away from it was that it was too strong and too sweet, and that these two factors threw the whole balance and merit of the style right out of whack. It may be extremely popular with others - and likely for good reason - but it won't be making my picnic basket on a hot summer's day."
"D - Great funk and a really, really enjoyable mouthfeel make this a sessionable strong saison."
"d: Maybe bottle conditioning would have helped bring this all together a bit better. I did enjoy it, but not quite as much as I hoped to."
"D.5.0"
"A beautiful winter saison. Perfect for this frozen New Year's Day. An almost caramel-like sweet base balanced out with a funky tang. Bright (but nowhere near blinding) like the setting sun's reflection off a snowy farm field. Rustic and very welcoming."
"I hope everyone's new year is as enjoyable as this beer!"
"The mouthfeel is on the lighter side for the style with carbonation being moderate. Drinkability is pretty good, it had some very nice flavors to it. All the flavors were pretty well balanced and came together nicely. very nice beer overall."
"D- This is a good saison overall- the ABV is well hidden. It has an overall soft, slightly spicy character. I really like this one-but it doesnt rank among my personal top Saisons."
"Nice high carbonation and light body - very refreshing."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, earthy and yeasty, with a small spiciness. In the taste, earthy, yeasty, spicy, and almost somewhat funky cheese like. A spice bite and medium to light bodied mouthfeel, with a dry spice and small tart earthiness in the aftertaste. Hides the alcohol and great flavor."
"Very easy to drink (too easy!) and something I'll be having again, and again."
"Drinkability is fantastic. So smooth, flavorful, and complex. A bit stronger and thicker than most Saisons, but a real winner overall."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. Reminded me of a great scotch whiskey in that it had a beautiful round flavor accentuated by some interesting sharp notes. Another good offering from Brasserie Dupont."
"Drink: Better cellared. Picked up a few of this year's release to cellar for next year. I've had it on tap at Toronado so I'm not too worried about the wait."
"Drinkability is amazing for a 9.5% beer. Doesn't leave a bitter or sweet flavor on the tongue, the dryness just balances out amazing."
"A really nice, easy-drinking saison -- would have place the ABV nearer to 5-6% rather than almost 10%."
"Overall: a very nice beer I might just pop one of these open for the new year!"
"D- Good saison and look forward to it at this time next year"
"D. Like I said before, a well brewed Saison that delivers in every way. An abv. at 9.5%, this beer could sneak up on you. As it warms the alcohol becomes more present. Present in a way to keep your spirits warm on a cold winter night."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Nice mouthfeel with a semi dry appetizing finish. One of the best holiday beers I've had in quite some time. Recommended."
"A heck of a beer, but the high alcohol is a bit of a spoiler for something that tastes like a refreshing sessioner."
"A pleasurable winter warmer, even if a bit of a one trick pony."
"Rather drinkable for a farmhouse ale, especially this time of year (though it is meant for this time of year)."
"D - With the alcohol being hard to detect, this is extremely drinkable. Great flavors and not a bad price."
"A different, yet equally appetizing way to celebrate Christmas with Belgian beer. Tired of all the Strong Dark Ales? Here's the cure."
"Notes: pretty spicy saison. the extra spiciness/pepper makes a little more appropriate for a cool evening though its still a very refreshing hot summer brew"
"Overall really enjoyed it, but hoped that it would be more distinct from its Saisson brethren."
"Very good mouthfeel, this is hard to compare with other beers."
"drinkability is good and now i want to try a fresh one - the search is on"
"Yet another standout from Dupont. All the usual features of their great saisons are here: bready aroma and taste mixed with citrus, clove and a bit of nutmeg, plus the usual barnyard funk. Impossible to go wrong with this brewery. This particular brew has a rather high ABV; given its easy drinkability, watch how you consume it. You won't want to play with sharp or valuable objects, sign important papers or change diapers afterward."
"D: This is an amazing beer that would probably taste great with lemon or cranberry scones in the morning or a Maytag or Stilton cheese plate as a perfect aperitif before dinner. This is a beer that really carries the saison banner high without marking territory all over the place with bretty funk. It just presents an amazing product with a delicious crispness and complex feel that is a phenomenal brew. I need to review the stock house ale of Brasserie Dupont, but I think this one beats it. I will be searching out a couple more to put away for a year or two and see what transpires."
"Pours a murky golden straw color with a huge white, fluffy head that hangs around for quite some time. Scent is a nice Belgian yeast aroma with some enticing banana and grass notes. I also get a bit of clove, much like a Belgian tripel. Taste is also a lot like a tripel as well. This saison is not one of the funkier ones I've had...not very funky at all. Very lovely banana, clove, pepper, orange peel, and lemon zest flavors with a nice bittering bite at the end. Mouthfeel is very crisp and provides the body with a nice warming sensation. Alcohol is VERY well hidden. Drinkability is high."
"The palate opens with a blend of floral and spicy character, there's orange blossom honey, white pepper and quite a bit of light fruits - pears and sweet apples. The alcohol appears in the mid-palate along with some sugar. Bitterness is low,there's a little hop flavor and a touch of earthy bitterness on the finish. Medium in body with high carbonation, the finish is solid. Mildly drying, earthy, spicy and a little honey are all present. The alcohol does get a little tiring after a while, and I do wish that it was a little lower. Not as complex and not as enjoyable as their flagship beer, this. While a 750 of this is quite easy to drink, it's better shared"
"D- the 9.5% is barely noticeable, i could have easily drunk the whole thing although glad i shared, just because i feel like another beer afterwards."
"Like all great Saisons, this beer has amazing drinkability and lots of yeast character. Amazing beer."
"Beer is thin and bright on the palate with the carbonation, nice esters and a good finish, not too dry but dry enough for it to be on style. Its a big saison, seriously, tastes awesome though. I would definitely have this again."
"So I was gonna stop reviewing at 400 beers, but I guess I'm shooting for 500. This beer is a great example of the style, pouring a nice goldenrod color with white pillowy head. Nose is really funky and delicious, underlaid with citrus, pepper, and yeast. Taste follows suit, with addition of sweet and bready malt notes, some vinous nature, and nice clove/yeasty/spice notes. Light, bubbly, and refreshing... a very easy drink. I think I like this more than regular Saison Dupont."
"Pours a thick hazy gold with a gigantic white head, smells of grapes, sweet malt and rustic spices. Avec is one of the most complex tasting beers out there. Starts like wild honey, and stirs into a spicy, fruity and balanced mass with a nearly undetectable 9.5% abv. Has a creamy solid mouthfeel and is crisp and semi sweet in the finish but nothing cloying or syrupy. One of the best out there!"
"Very satisfying saison! I would highly recommend it."
"Drinkability:This is a fantastic Saison, nicely spiced, very complex."
"the pour was perfect and clean with a decent but very tight head atop a murky golden body. nose is farmhouse funk but equally placed with a boutique of floral citrus fruit and cane sugar. i can't put it any differently than it resumabled a well place triple with a saison twist. abv was not obvious but there. palate was suprisingly crisp with a bitter Munich malt and saaz hops blended with soapy floral notes and a farmhouse of straw. some lemon and candied pineapple in the sweet malt characters. great fresh taste."
"Mouthfeel is light but very creamy. An awesome mouthful. The alcohol is defiantly there but still very drinkable. A light, but complex brew with lots to come back for but a 750ml bomb will do for now."
"Pours a nice straw color with a good white head and some lacing. Smell is quite funky and with some citrus notes thrown in as well. Taste is quite similar. Quite spicy and hoppy for the style. Fairly dry mouthfeel, and somewhat light. Good carbonation. The funk persists throughout. A nice twist with excellent drinkability."
"Pairing: Had it with some lightly seasoned pork on the grill. Not a great match, not offensive but nothing to link the beer and food really, except the spices on the meat and the funk in the beer. Did clean the palate nicely."
"jd"
"D - extremely well made, complete, yet traditional saison"
"welll....that is a spectacular brew. the depth, the class...i could drink it for a year and find something new to say each day"
"Very refreshing...it delivers the 9.5% ABV nicely."
"The best bottles have a farmyard funk that fills the room and the senses but this one didn't. Oh well guess I drink the two bottles in my cellar quickly."
"*=ideas from fellow taster"
"D: refreshing and tasty, perfect for summer, alcohol warmth and crisp mouthfeel keeps me coming back for more, a great saison"
"Of wheat flavor. Similar flavors to the aromas, grassy, hey n straw. Nice dry finish and silky mouthfeel. For a saison of its strength this one goes down easy."
"Update 3/3/13: Just had another bottle. 2006. Still wonderful. Highly recommended."
"Overall I like this beer a lot, very interesting and flavorfull."
"Drinkability is good and enjoyable beer, beautiful aroma good flavor."
"Overall, a very good beer, worth seeking out."
"This beer leads me to the same conclusion as my previous review, bigger isn't always better. Pours a hazy, copper orange color with a fluffy off white head with average retention and lacing. The aroma explodes from the bottle as the cork is removed (if thats possible) and hits you with funk, belgian yeast, floral, earthiness, spice, etc. Body is a little chewier and less crisp than the normal Saison Dupont and much boozier. Flavor is very citrusy, grainy and earthy with a strong medicinal and phenol presence which isn't that pleasing. There is also a very strong alcohol presence throughout and burning in the finish. I think I might enjoy a bottle of this much more with some age on it."
"d: it'd drink it like I could drink a Saison Dupon, but it's high alcool volume would get me from behind. It's bitterness slows down the debit, but I like drinking slowly."
"D: No problems drinking this despite the alcohol content. 4"
"I had this on tap at Hopleaf into a tulip...The beer is a nice gold slight orange, good head and retention...The aroma and taste are super nice, what a saison is. Floral hops, so fresh with a little funk. The taste is bitter but sour, easy to drink.."
"Poured from a bottle into two wine glasses. Refreshing yet remarkably full-bodied at the same time. Incredibly well-balanced. Beautiful white tightly laced foam head. Mild fruity esters, yeasty and fun. A great beer for the start of summer, paired nicely with a light dinner of grilled lamb, corn, and salad."
"To drown in it would be a good way to die."
"Not bad, but the surge of bitterness was a bit to dominant for me, made the experience somewhat unbalanced. But can replace champagne when needed - that's positive."
"A solid effort; probably the best ""imperial saison"" that I've tried. This is a bigger, brasher Saison Dupont... and proof that bigger does not always equal better."
"TIP: If cellaring this one, store upright to minimize sediment."
"Drinkability: Really inviting and super refreshing, easy with an ongoing enjoyment of original Dupont fashion. Tastes of strong grain, hops and different spices bring new respects to this wonderful holiday saison."
"D: Dangerous at this weight!"
"A little too silky and full for my liking in the mouthfeel, would have liked it to dance through. Perhaps the ABV shows itself here. Still, a well crafted beer that I would gladly drink again but not in my all-time favorites of the style. Thanks Rob!"
"Thanks to Pier-Luc for the bottle."
"D- I was really excited by this beer, and while it is good, it is not my favorite saison. Fantome still reigns supreme."
"Drinkability it's hard to believe this style originated across Europe from farmhouse workers who would drink this extremely refreshing complex golden ale after working the land. This is the hallmark for the celebratory moments in our lives grab a bottle of with best wishes on your holiday and let your friends and family be aware of the nuances. this bottles is from February of 2009 and I can't get enough of it."
"Other comments: Saison Dupont and Avec Les Bons Veux are two of my favorite beers. It's such a bummer that it's almost impossible to get a non-skunked bottle over here. Saison Dupont isn't going to start using brown bottles apparently, so can we ask our beer stores to store the bottles in cardboard sleeves?"
"Easy to drink and it's my favorite food pairing beer!"
"D= Extremely drinkable despite the huge ABV. I love saisons and I love strong Belgian ales, and this was a perfect match of both. Really a great beer and one I will visit again soon."
"Drinkability: Hides its alcohol well but it lacks the big enjoyable flavors of a typical Belgian. Honestly, it tastes a bit watered-down. I could drink a bunch but I'm not sure I'd want to."
"D - Extremely drinkable even with the high ABV."
"Mouthfeel: It has a mouth-filling body and bursting carbonation. It wants to overflow out of your mouth! But despite fullness, it still finishes easy and quick."
"I'd seek this one out again."
"D: A nice beer, and surprisingly strong at 9.5% ABV. The flavors were good, but a little less refreshing than your typical saison."
"D: A great saison. I love the creamy, yet effervescent, mouthfeel and the complex array of flavors. One of my favorites that I look forward to every year."
"Overall a spectacular special New Year release from the grand daddy of all Belgian Saison producers. I've tried this a couple times over the past 6-7 years, but never came across any for retail purchase. So when I saw these over the holiday, I snagged 4 bottles. I'll savor this one and the remaining two will most likely be consumed when the soft nights of springtime arrive. On this chilly February's day, it's hitting all the right buttons for sure."
"Overall- delicious. warming and refreshing. yeast character dominates. complex and funky. unique."
"Poured a corked and caged 750ml into my Hennepin globe glass. This beer pours a rich, hazy golden with a massive 4-inch head that lasts for days and leaves crazy lacing all the way down the glass. The aroma is amazing. I don't think I've ever had a beer with this much aroma. After I opened it up the aroma wafted through the entity of my kitchen and living room. Massive notes of lemon zest, pepper, yeasty biscuits, toast, grassy hops, coriander with just a hint of banana underlying the aroma. Also there subtle notes of funk along with just a hint of sulfur that I think probably comes from the green bottle but adds just another layer of complexity to the beer. The flavor is just as remarkable. As complex as any saison I could want. Massive lemon zest, apple skins, ripe pears, grains, yeasty biscuits and just a wee bit of funk. The funk is a bit toned down form the nose. The sulfur is still there though, once again adding more to it then subtracting. My biggest issue is the alcohol content. Its really hard to hide 9.5% and it shows through just a little bit. The mouthfeel is exceptional. I've never had a Saison that is that creamy and smooth but at the same time it just doesn't finish dry enough or me. This is always my biggest complaint with Saisons. I want them to finish bone dry. Overall this is a exceptional example of a Belgian Saison. Absolutely beautiful."
"Two year old: like the one year, but less sweet, smoother, and more balanced."
"The earthiness and spiciness of this beer is a bit strong but in line with the style. If anything, the slightly cloying sweetness detracted the most from the drinkability for me. A nice warming beer with some good farmhouse funkiness."
"Mouthfeel was sort of thin, and perhaps the only down side I thought of this beer. Alcohol was masked very well."
"Would I buy more of it? - Sure. I find this is a great beer to bring to a holiday party."
"Overall: If you can get this fresh an unoxidized, then I think it's a pretty good saison, but still not that great, as it's still a bit hard to drink."
"Refreshing for the ABV, full complex flavor, but still crisp and refreshing even as it warms."
"I had this on tap at Monk's. It was pale, straw yellow in appearance with a moderate white head. The aroma was spicy and zesty. The taste follows the nose, big. bright lemon notes and lots of spice. The alcohol was well hidden. It was light in body and highly carbonated. This is a very good saison."
"It is marked as a special farmhouse/saison by the added spice and heavier elements. It is less of the aromatic ""holiday"" ale and more of a heavier winter brew; a substantial warming ale on cold nights."
"I wish I could do a side by side by side of saison dupont, moinette blond and this. It's certainly a great beer, but I think I prefer the others more (edit: just went back and checked my reviews - I gave this 4.15, the other 2 both scored 4.3). I'm not sure that the extra alcohol in this one really improves things all that much, I think this style works better with lower alcohol and/or some funk."
"this is a great beer and worth trying without doubt. this is one of the better saison's I've had and I plan on trying many more, I like this style of beer and you should too"
"The bitter flavor, slightly acid or lemon. The palate is light, spicy, it is also full, sweet and soft as velvet. It is well hopped, sometimes a little too, well levurée and finish, light enough, and is spiced with a good bitterness. This is probably one of the best balanced beers in the world but it fails to take off beyond the balance outstanding and offer something unique."
"D: If prompted, I would have an affair with it."
"Mouthfeel is amazing. Obviously a strong beer like this needs to have some weight, but this has a dense but so smooth body with great carb that makes it seem light and uplifting. Excellent beer that is a pleasure to drink for a seasoned brett vet, but could be a tad overwhelming for the non-initiated."
"(With thanks to stagger yet again for hooking me up.)"
"Drinkability: This beer is a ""poster child"" for drinkability. It is a wonderful beer with incredible complexity and subtlety. There are so many flavors bouncing in and out of this one and the sweetness and the tartness blend and play and dance around and around in a way that almost leaves the head spinning. Oh wait... Maybe that's the high ABV that sneaks up on you. A dangerously drinkable beer in that it would be very easy to consume too much of this one. However, I'm also sure I'll be having more of this one, both to finish off this bottle and to drink again in the future."
"When I first squeezed out the cork, the initial whiff I took in sure smelled more or less like a skunky Euro-lager - weird, I know. As things duly progressed, the fuller, more enjoyable fruit and yeast ester components came round to bear. Ergo, a nice, if a bit challenging, 'embiggened' (OK, boozy) saison, but hey, if you got it, flaunt it, I say."
"So big in flavour and ABV that it is a little limited in just how drinkable it really could be. That being said it is well worth having, and is really satisfying."
"Golden ale, one finger rocky white head, slow dissipation with significant lacing. A truly beautiful beer. Cardamon and orange peel in the nose, a bit lemony. Same taste profile as the nose. A tad bit of funk, horseblanket in the hose. Real dry attenuation and finish from the distinctive Dupont yeast. Certainly a bit more of an alcohol hit than 'regular' Dupont, but, heh, it's Christmas. A world classic."
"Notes: Very rich and pleasing draft offering. I look forward to the chance to test it bottled in the future."
"D: Very good, one I could have several of... If Fou Foune was not on tap. Bartender another Fou Foune Please!!!"
"A good beer but it doesn't strike me as the perfect Saison. Nonetheless, a tasty beer with plenty of nice flavour which is the the general mould of a Saison. Well structured and worth a try."
"Overall: I first had this beer this week on tap at Brasserie Becks in DC, but I didn't take notes. I was surprised when I found it in Cleveland in a bottle. This is a very good saison."
"75cl bottle from '09. Pours a hazy, ruddy gold with a large white head. Nice staying power. Smells incredibly yeasty and slightly sweet, with a lot of bubblegum. Slight tanginess. Definite grassy hops in the background. The initial taste is quite bitter, again with a lot of strong, aromatic hop character. Very sweet later, with a lot of malt/candi sugar coming through. Again, plenty of the trademark Dupont yeast. Slightly boozy, warming finish. Lingering notes both sweet and bitter, which isn't very pleasant. Medium body. Not terrible, but it doesn't hold a candle to Saison Dupont. What's the point?"
"A gushing head on top of a clear gold body with lace patches down the glass. A floral bouquet with citric and grapefruit aromas long with some spices. A very smooth beer that finishes easy with mild citric and tropical fruit flavors along with minor sweet malts and some sharp clove and pepper spices all balanced together. Finishes dry and crisp and is a sessionable and good saison to drink."
"75cl bottle. Hazy gold with a big, lasting white head. The aroma is just beautiful beer: hoppy, bready, malty, yeasty, spicy, fruity... The flavor is somewhat sweet and bready to begin, jammy in the middle, and then dry and lightly alcoholic, with bitter hops that leave an orange and spice flavor. The body is medium with ambitious bubbles. Almost brings in a tripel cameo before being firmly Dupont. Great stuff"
"Served in a brand chalice at Lucky Baldwin's, Pasadena, CA"
"Taste is sweet and spicy upfront giving way to an estery middle and a bitter, almost astringent finish, an almost Aspirin taste. Complicated and enjoyable enough to keep you coming back for more, at a dangerous rate (watch the ABV!). Just funky enough for a white boy who likes James Brown."
"Thanks jnn4v!"
"Super easy to drink this one in spite of the abv. While the slight booziness peeks out at times it is so well integrated that you never feel you are in danger until you start to feel it. Nice stuff!"
"Good beer"
"M: CO2 goes away fast, quite creamy, a good drink..."
"overall: An interesting beer with a lot of complex flavors, i dont think its one of my favorites since i llike the more sour stuff but certainly enjoyable, plus im drinking it in the summer and its meant to be drank in the early winter, that bitter tannic finish brings the drinkability way down for me"
"D - Another top Saison from one of the best. 9.50% alcohol is only slightly noticeable making this a dangerous drop."
"This beer pours a golden,yellow hazy colour which leaves a massive frothy head full of bubbles and sticky lacing down the glass, actually looks perfect for a saison and the head just hangs around and slowly,slowly dissaptes but leaves a massive mound of froth in the middle and on smelling this beer its smells of carmel,bread,candy and dried fruits quite lucious actually,the taste is beautiful so refreshing and the alcohol ABV is so well hidden you only get a little alcohol warmth on your first taste and after that you dont taste it again very easy drinking for a beer that is 9.5% you can just taste citrus fruits and beautiful caramel notes i really like this beer and will be buying it again."
"Regardless, this is only a minor inconvenience for a Saison that offers such exceptional visuals, aromas, and flavors that I am willing to rate it higher regardless of this slight lack of refinement. While it may be a Christmas Saison, it's excellent for all seasons (wow, that was WITTY!)."
"In the mouth it comes on fresh and maintains a honey stickiness until it finishes off dry."
"But overall, yeah I'm really not sure what to make of it. Pushes me away with one hand, draws me in with the other."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied with tiny, zippy carbonation bubbles."
"M/D - Light and crisp with excellent carbonation. A little more spiced than some saisons, but still very good."
"Slightly less drinkable than their original Saison, but more sophisticated and more complex. I prefer the amazing refreshment that a good funky saison gives you, but this is still an excellent beer. I'm phenomenally pleased that it's possible to find this in Australia."
"A pale golden color with a two inch, white colored head and stays there for sometime. A grassy scent at first, mixed with a bready scents, with touches of yeasty esters, and ending with a lemony fragrance. The bread comes out in each taste, then blending to a biscuit and yeast flavor. A grassy and lemon flavor finishes it all out. A heavy water feel, with a touch of a cleansing sensation of carbonation with a light dryness at the end. The light feel, along with the pleasant flavors and aromas make this an easy to drink beer, especially with a good piece of sea bass."
"Notes: A great food beer! A perfect match for spinach, mushroom and cheese filled crepes!"
"D: Not too shabby. More of a slow sipper than I would like a saison to be, though. Not quite in the league of Vieille Provision."
"Anywho, I've drifted again. Bottom line: I love this beer!"
"D - Overall good, but would like more notes of spice from a saison."
"D: In its tier of top notch saisons, it slips just a tad on the drinkability level."
"Overall a very interesting beer and something that stands out in a crowd."
"Mouthfeel is light and effervescent."
"The pour on this beer is a beautiful milky maize color with a sturdy white head. The lacing remains through out the glass full. The aroma was average at best,not giving me much else but the ABV. The initial taste was bland reminiscent of a mass produced imported ale. I just couldn't find anything about this beer that made it stand out. I served it with a citrusy desert whose character compensated for the lack of character given by this Dupont offering."
"A great Saison. I would love to do a side by side comparison between this and Saison Dupont to notice the differences between the two. Highly recommend."
"D - I like this Saison. Spicy and tasty but also serious."
"I finally procured a couple of 750ml bottles at my neighborhood Whole Foods, in early December. Carbonation and lacing were superb, with some of the yeast sediment settling on top of the head. This ale is very drinkable, the fruity spice overtones explode in your mouth before swallowing. My only gripe with this fantastic beer is the green bottle; I believe it would have a much longer shelf life and be less prone to turning if bottled in brown glass."
"D: Good for summer days when you just want to kick back with a nice, relaxing beer to complement a light meal."
"This is a heavy. unbalanced beer, and I didn't like it."
"D - Good for year 'round and seafood friendly."
"Golden colour, big off-white head, lacing. Aroma is malty, almost lagerlike. Still there is yeasty notes flowery notes, citric notes and also aroma of vinegar. Flavour is rather hoppy for being a belgian beer. There is also an acidic quality to it. ABV is evident without being dominant. The flavour is also spicy and fruity, perfume. Mouthfeel is very smooth with small bubbles and the liquid is very crisp."
"A forum discussion today convinced me to go home and crack one of my 08's, i figured since ive never reviewed the beer now is the perfect time. Pours a transparent golden yellow orange color with a monster, rising, pure snow white head that protrudes up and over the rim of my Corsendonk tulip, tons of vigorous, lively carbonation rise in support of the large head. Wonderful bouquet of earthy, grassy hops, some lemon skin and mint leaves. Sweet malt, very bitter hops and a hint of wheat late on the palate. Grassy and herbal almost medicinal in nature a subtle whiff of alcohol at the finish accentuates the classic hop character of the beer. Medium bodied, slightly coating and completely alive with carbonation. This one remains a winner."
"Overall - A top class Saison... As good as any i've had... recommended..."
"Purchased the last bottle at Max's 2009 Belgianfest and brough it home. Opened it today to share with my brother. The label is different from the one shown above. Mine is yellow with a big Roman numeral III at the top. Golden color. White head with meringue like appearance. The smell had earthy citrus notes. Amazingly complex flavor that changed with every sip. The first few were sweet and continueed to change till the last that seemed much drier. Mouthfeel was average with somewhat high carbonation. For the $17 dollars I paid for this one 750 ml bottle, the drinkability become average."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, strong kick, very good representation of style, this is a lighter but high-powered Belgian beer to drink for a long time."
"A must try for saison lovers! Wow"
"Drinkability- A very good beer. Not for a Belgian novice, but a good representation of the style. Could be a little fruitier, but this is still a pretty good Saison."
"NOTE: Will cellar a couple of these to see how they turn out. I'm especially interested to see how the balance between the alcohol and spices develops."
"A quite complex saison with both a nice sweetness and bitterness to go with it. Tasty and dangerously drinkable."
"pairs decently with thai food, but nothing special. i think i like regular saison dupont better."
"Drinkability - A fine saison, and a damn fine one at that. I think I would go as far as to say that Brasserie Dupont has this whole saison thing down."
"Pours a nice copper orange color. It has a nice pillowy white head. The nose is spicy with some citrus notes. The taste is excellent. Its nice and spicy but sweet and very east to drink. The mouthfeel is medium bodies and pretty good amount of carbonation. It's highly enjoyable and easy to drink. This is the perfect saison!"
"The 9.5% abv is very well masked... very easy to drink."
"Solid complex drinkable beer."
"- very good for the complexity"
"D: The 9.5 ABV is well hidden. I could easily drink the entire bottle and not even realize it. Feels velvety in the mouth and goes down incredibly smooth."
"D - A good beer, Im not a huge saison fan, but this is one that would go very well with pork etc"
"Creamy mouthfeel but still very drinkable. It does tend to get a little rich toward the end of the experience."
"d) Better than champagne on a summers day. I am halfway through the 750mL bottle, and looking forward to the rest.... at 9.5%, I won't be having a session with this, but it is an outstanding drop nonetheless."
"Seems like a challenging beer for the holiday season, but I really enjoyed its wackiness. Great change of pace from the bocks and dunkels I've been trying out."
"D - One of the better saisons I have had. Complex."
"Drinkability: On the plus side, it's a very interesting beer, with well-hidden alcohol, pleasant fruity and spicy notes, and a crisp and lively yet smooth mouthfeel. On the other hand, it's just a little too tart and grassy for me in most places. I'm glad I tried it, though it's not in my ""Top 10 Saisons"" list. And though I don't have such a list, I could likely make one, I suppose."
"Definitely new to the beer advocate and therefore beer geek scene, therefore feel free to disregard this ""amateur"" review. This was the best beer I had at Toronado SF. Almost brought a tear to my eye. Taste and mouthfeel are definitely strongpoints. This is not one to miss if it comes your way."
"I would really like to try this beer with food. I think it could go well with a number of dishes, and that the foods would bring out some flavors in the beer. On its own, it is very nice, but not as complex or as memorable of some other saisons."
"d: Wow, I love barnyard funk filled saisons, but this is near perfection. I am yet to experience Fantome, but this is my favorite saison to date. ""Best Wishes"" indeed."
"Excellent Old World texture at first - becomes even heartier with warmth and shows hints of the modern Saison with even more drinkability. Does drink a bit slowly overall but this is an awesome offering for someone who really digs this style."
"7/4/8/4/14 (3.7/5)"
"Taste: Very slight candy malt sweetness & yeasty pineapple, banana & banana flavors create a backdrop for the prickly, waxy/herbal bitter hop flavors. This is amplified and complimented by the carbonation and spices. Sweetness stays low, but takes on some honeysuckle character going into the finish. Finish is clean and crisp, leaving lingering waxy, bitter hop flavors and the desire to take another sip."
"Drinkability: I would only drink one or two of these, not a session beer for me, but certainly worth trying."
"Clear yellow golden color with a white head that has good retention and lacing. Smells of bubblegum, chamomille, flowers, and hints of pepper and ginger. Light spice, chamomille, clove, and bubblegum in the taste. Medium bodied with high carbonation. Good stuff."
"Drinkability: Displays tons of distinct flavors and subtle complexities, but for a winter seasonal, I find myself looking elsewhere and for a saison, well, I honestly prefer the standard Saison Dupont. But I certainly appreciate the ""best wishes"" from Brasserie Dupont (right back at'cha!)."
"Hazy yellow gold, clouded with swirls of yeast. The head is one of those classic Belgian heads...big, clumpy, sticky, and long lasting. Aromas of hay and grass upfront. Flowers and spicy citrus juice, apple, and peppery phenols. Lots of yeasty phenolic flavors upfront...zesty orange peel, full-flavored spiciness. Solid bitterness with a long dry finish and slight tartness. Mmm...the aroma is getting better and better...a more complex, slightly funky layer is entering the picture. Warm and a little cider-like. Full, smooth body. Not much suggests the high ABV% except a slight warmth and a funny feeling creeping into my head. I need to pick up a fresh bottle of this year's batch to compare. Pretty good stuff right here."
"Overall I was surprised by how much fruitier the draught version was vs the bottle, but it remains a very tasty beverage. Worth a shot."
"D- usually i dont give such high marks for a beer pusing double digit ABV, but this one is so damn smooth"
"Pretty delicious. Saison Dupont's big brother is an excellent saison with strong flavors and a full body. This would not be an everyday beer for me, which I say to contrast it with Saison Dupont, but it is a marvelous special occasion beer and a wonderful holiday offering. This beer does not have an outstanding look for a good saison, but it's held to a higher standard than most beers in this category. The smell is all farmhouse. While it is not a true horse blanket brett beer, it certainly verges on that flavor profile but does so without necessarily scaring off the anti-horse crowd. It has a decidedly refined country flavor, think idyllic Belgian farmhouse. The flavor is full of fruity yeast, subtle malt and refined hops. There are lemons, perfume, herbs, cinnamon, bitter nutmeg and more tastes that I can hardly place. It's rustic and wonderful. There's quite a bit of sediment at the bottom, so do be careful of that. The other slight downside is that a bit of undisguised ethanol notes peek out around the sides, slightly diminishing drinkability compared to its little brother. I would very much enjoy trying a bottle with a little bit more age on it. I broke down with this one after only about six weeks, but then I'm not exactly unhappy about that. At any rate, Dupont makes excellent saisons and this is their stronger version."
"Overall- Nice tart Saison. 1 will do though."
"Drinkability: Fantastically drinkable at this abv, or period."
"Dupont knows how to craft a saison, so give yourself up to the unique nature of this beer and enjoy every sip. Hearty and flavorful, this is a hell of a beer. My best wishes to you too, Brasserie Dupont!"
"HV"
"2008 vintage served in my DT tulip. Poured a hazy orange-gold with a three inch dense, fluffy off-white head. Excellent head retention which left behind strands of sticky lacing as it receded. Nose was hard to tease out; herbal and candi sugar was what I came up with. Taste consistent with nose, but somewhat medicinal at the finish. Mouthfeel fell between light- and medium-bodied with a consistent background effervescence and a slightly buttery texture. Alcohol was well-hidden for 9.5% abv. Finish was on the dry side. All and all, I found the brew to be somewhat bitter and dry. There might be some improvement with age, but not my favorite representation of the style."
"M/D: Carbonation is alright, medium bodied. Body is actually much heavier then I expected/am used to, but it's not bad. Drinkability is OK. The booze in the taste really takes away from this one. I know it is 9.5%, but for a saison (and I've had some that were +9.5%) the alcohol just stands out too much. It's too bad because the nose is really done very well. Not bad, but there are better saisons out there."
"This is a welcome seasonal offering from the folks at the Dupont brasserie. I finished off the bottle on my own, which left me feeling nice and warm inside, but that's about all I'd care to handle right now. I might pick up another bottle before the year is out."
"Pours a cloudy golen color with foamy white head. Aroma is slightly bitter with hints of fruit and spice. Extremely enjoyable smoth tasting beer. Kind of creamy with hints of fruit and spice with a crisp finish."
"Out of a 750ml corked and caged bottle. Pours a cloudy golden honey color with a nice whispy white head that dissipated into a nice cap, with some lacing on the glass. The aroma is delicious. Nice funky Beligan phenols. Tart apple skin, lemon, honey, white pepper, some banana, and a nice kick of the candi sugar. Not nearly as sweet in the taste. The candi sugar is there but very subtle as it should be. The tart lemon and green apple kick things off, followed by some clove and other spices. A noticable malt presence to carry the ABV and a very slight stale grassy hop in the end. A nice solid feel with good carbonation; good balance between the sweet, bitter, and sour. Don't necessarily feel that a Saison needs to be at a 9.5abv, kind of takes away the nice rustic sessionable quality of a saison."
"It pours pale golden with a big fluffy head. The alcohol is evident on the nose but not overpowering. Ripe fruit on the palate and lots of phenolics. A nice crispness runs through. It is an interesting beer but I don't know whether it justified the dollars spent on it."
"Pours a nice honey-lemon color, massive foamy beige head is not really going anywhere, just fading in small amounts, huge clumps of lacing all over the glass, lots of sediment in the glass, and millions of tiny bubbles racing to the surface....this is nice to look at. Definitely has an earthy aroma, peppery, some citrus notes, tart lemon. Taste follows right along, I get a slight taste of alcohol, but nothing unpleasant about it....slight sourness is nice, maybe a bit of bitter green apple, some grassy flavors too...this is delicious. Intensely carbonated, refreshing but substantial. Really nice Saison."
"M = Medium-heavy body, alcohol stings and burns slightly but still pleasantly, the mouthcoating is good but could have been just a little more for the body."
"Mouthfeel is rough at first with way over carbonation but that subsides. This is a nice brew. I don't know that I'd get another, but a classic and a good drinkin' beer nonetheless."
"Love seeing this on tap every year. Just delicious."
"Looks like it should. Light copper color with a huge fluffy white head on top that leaves some solid lacing as the beer drains. Nose is fantastic: huge and sweet, dried fruit, cotton candy, maybe some aprioct and kiwi in there too. All kinds of stuff going on that nose. Flavor's enormous as well. First thing I notice is the peppy spiciness and high carbonation. There's also some candy citrus sweetness in there, but it melds extremely well with a really strong farmhouse earthiness that lingers into an almost bitter afternaste. A tough of caramel malt and yeast. Surprisngly light alcohol, given the ABV. Body is appropriate for the style, and doesn't get in the way of the flavor (and does stick around with that long aftertaste). Overall, a delicious and really unique saison. Maybe not one I'd go for every day, but an excellent beer nonetheless."
"D - This beer is one that I will always enjoy. It's expressive and complex at the same time. Definitely a highlight for me from the DuPont folks. Makes a great Chicken Cordon Bleu too..."
"Into my Hennepin glass, pours a cloudy golden color, with a nice frothy but smooth white head of an inch, the multi-pour bringing it right back, and some nice lacing. The aroma is lovely. Grassy hops, citrus, very nice, mild fruits, and some gentle spices. Again, being a farmhouse saison, nice earthy hops with grassy, leafy tones, citrus and fruits are understated, slightly tart, some nice spices and spicy yeast. The mouth is crisp, tart, the carbonation dancing slightly across the tongue. Really, a marvelous beer, easy to enjoy, easy to drink."
"Drinkable, but I really was expecting an incredible beer. This is a really good beer, but not exceptional."
"D: Damn is this good with 3 years on it. The last pour with all the yeast in it was sublime. Tons of funk. Excellent beer. I am sure the 3 years on the bottle did not hurt."
"Poured a gorgeous hazy orange yellow color with a nice fluffy white head. Aroma was slightly musty, clove, citrus like and yeasty. Flavor though reminds me of a Duvel, but slightly less sweet and more earthy in flavor. The mellow but nice fruit flavor is of an acid orange and pear. The peppery hop flavor is there but not too obnoxious as to overpower the delicate fruit flavor. Feel is tingly liek a champagne but not as light obviously. Not the most balanced or complex farmhouse but it was VERY enjoyable."
"Avec Les Bons Voeux is simply one hell of a fine beer. Perhaps the nose could use a little strengthening, but that's about it. In all other respects, it's spot on. It's easily one of the tops I've had for the style. Recommended without reservation."
"This is a good beer, but I don't like it nearly as much as Saison Dupont and Foret. It lacks the refreshing qualities of those beers, and the prominent earthiness and bitterness take away from the drinkability for me. I would love to revisit this when it's much colder outside, as that is the season it is meant for."
"Overall: good, but a one time thing"
"Rumour has it that this ages well...worth it? we will see! Fantastic stuff."
"D: I love saisons, this is good, but not top notch for me. very enjoyable though, well worth a try."
"The spice and alcohol content add life and zest to the beer, but become tiring on the palette, which hurts the drinkability of the beer. More of a celebratory beer I would enjoy sharing, but would stop after a small single glass. Overall it shows flashes of brilliance, yet also some clumsiness. I had higher hopes, but you could do far worse."
"Drinkability- This is a really tasty brew that I find myself enjoying thoroughly. It goes down a bit too easy for a brew over 9% and I definitely wish I had a drinking buddy right now. The ABV could be toned down a bit but otherwise this is a fantastic brew. Big thanks to Shane!"
"a finish that continues to impress with warmth, and the balance is just impeccable. its always just the right amount of fruit, or malt, or hops, or spice, its just so delicate and delicious, yet strong and enduring at the same time. the most impressive saison i've had to date"
"Give it a shot"
"Had on tap. Really nice seasonal ale. Pours golden red. Intense floral aroma of yeast, light fruits, and aromatic hops. Has a good deal of funk, but that only serves to complement the other flavors. has a great spicy funky, bready quality to it. Very smooth. Nice finish, An excellent farmhouse ale."
"The body is light to moderate. Good carbonation. Overall I was disappointed in this beer. I was hoping for more funk and more fruitiness/ester Belgian goodness. Oh well here is score."
"The beer poured a dark golden hazy color with a big rocky head. A fruity nose, with musty and earthy notes as well. Fruity on the palate again with a touch of herbal earthiness and spiciness. A slight bitterness emerges at the end and lingers for time afterward. Very light alcohol also detectable at the end. Slightly dry. A nice beer, a good sipping beer."
"D: A very nice saison. The complex smell and taste are the distinguishing factors for this beer. A good one to try and well worth the money for the experience you get from this beer."
"M&D: so refreshing yet creamy in texture, the body is light, so easy to sip... Dangerously drinkable, and the deep herbal bitterness really makes it all the more outstanding! Not heavily Saison-like to me, though, due to the attenuated mustiness, but overall this is a cracking booze to sip~~"
"This is a very nice saison. It's a little sweeter, more alcoholic, and fuller in body than most of the style, but this is a special release, so those qualities are welcome. It's not something I'd drink every day, but I'd be happy to have some every once in a while. Recommended."
"D: Pretty straight forward but damn tasty. I didn't write a review from the Hopleaf because I knew I had this bottle waiting at home, but I think I liked it a bit more on tap. Very easy drinking Saison and perfect now that weather is warming up. 9.5% is a complete and utter shock."
"An easy three fingers of loose bubbled white head and retaining well sits atop cloudy golden colored body. Fragrant florals, lemon, tart esters, soft yeast funk aromas offer something very promising. Tastes begin with zesty citrus, lemon and grapefruit, traces of pear and then the yeasty funk takes center stage throwing out a range of depth and character. Flashes of peppery spice, the sweetness, and hops balances well with the yeasts tart, musty, mossy character. Finishes dry with a yeasty bitterness. Nice consistent mouthfeel with some cloying, frothy carbonation, and medium body is all very nice. Best thanks to Dupont for Best Wishes!"
"D: great, what else is there to say."
"This was a great beer, but frankly I'd prefer this brewery's Saison Dupont and Foret. Still worth a try if you dig saisons."
"Pours light orange to yellow with whitish head. Smell is minty, and lemony fresh, perhaps herbal as well. Taste is sharp, somewhat tart and a touch spiced as well. Some butteriness to the flavor at the same time and a honey sweetness to it. Faintly hopped as well, but sweetness prevails still a bit from this."
"Overall, a nice beer - worth trying if you have the opportunity but not one I would consider a world classic. The regular Saision Dupont actually offers a more classic example of the style."
"I very nice beer I'll be sure to pick up again."
"Big points for the complexity, but there is also a lot of odd flavors and smells that aren't exactly appealing. Vive la difference but realize that this is not your typical beer. It is growing on me."
"Drinkable considering the high ABV. smooth and easy to drink. Maybe too easy."
"D: Drinkability is quite high on this one, very tasty, hides its alcohol rather deceptivly and is not that filling apart from the rather large amount of carbonation present in this beer."
"I could stand to drink several of these. This one's a quaffable treat to be sure. The subtly of this one is remarkable and the seamless blend of flavors makes this one a legend."
"Recommended..."
"I will avoid from now on."
"This one went great with olive oil/pepper basted steaks, but I can imagine dozens of dishes to pair with it. I need more of this..."
"Very refreshing and interesting beer."
"A very good Saison. Not as easy to drink as some, but an excellent sipper. Would be a great beer to pair with fish or poultry. A great price for a genuine belgian import - I beleive I paid $8-9."
"Another high quality Belgian that fits this style perfectly. Cheers!"
"Lately I have been going a little crazy on this style, trying every one that I can get my mitts on. This one pours a murky golden color similar to the look of an orange creamsickle. Heading is small, white, and leaves a white ring around the glass. Aroma is surprisingly like a creamsickle as well, with lots of cream, milk, orange, lemon, and even a bit of pie crust. Taste starts off incredibly creamy, with tons of vanilla and milk. It then becomes more citrusy, with light tropical fruits such as orange, mango and pineapple especially. Body of this one is in the middle, and the alcohol is virtually nonexistent in the flavor. You can definitely feel it after a glass or two, but everywhere else it is downright ghostly. After drinking a full champaign bottle to myself, I am kicking myself for not purchasing another bottle aka this stuff is damn drinkable. I drove to Julios today to pick up a few bottles of Alesmith IPA, expecting to be blown away by that beer. Instead, I came home with one of these and have found one of the best beers I have ever tasted. My first perfect score for a beer, and a well deserved one. I have to imagine that Hennepin is somewhat modeled after this beer, as the two seem very similar in their sweet/sour profiles. Fucking exquisite beer that I cannot wait to taste again. Cheers"
"Creamy body and good crisp carbonation. Great balance and very complex. Delicious."
"Well carbonated with fine bubbles that give a soft feel. Very drinkable, yet not overly interesting."
"Not the best saison I've sampled but topnotch."
"Very drinkable, but I still really don't ""get"" Saisons. Everyone's always going on about the subtlety and complexity of beers like this (and its more common, much lighter cousin) and I wonder if we're drinking the same beer, or if the fact that I was weaned on Amercian bourbon-aged smoked triple imperial beers brewed with radioactive champagne yeast is keeping me from appreciating subtle beers like this one."
"A good saison but a tad too much alcohol to drink too much of it in one day."
"This is a good beer, very synergistic and quite nice to drink. Not amazing, just real solid Belgian beer here. Give it a try if you like Saisons."
"D- Again because of the fact that the taste isn't where I would like it to be, it got dinged in this category a bit, however I had no trouble finishing the 750 by myself."
"Extremely bright and crisp in both flavor and texture. The higher carbonation provides for a refreshing feel but still remains juicy and uncious as well. A bit starchy with lots of pleasant warmth in the finish and an overall medium body. Definitely one of the best and most complete Saisons I've head. A must try to be sure."
"Overall this was an excellent example of the style, never getting dull and consistently offering more and more complex flavors the further into it you chose to delve. I would gladly have this one again anyday as it was truly excellent and very much lived up to its repuation. Glad I finally got a chance to try it."
"D- Quite good. I don't know that I would buy another bottle for the price, but certainly worth a try."
"Drinkability - It isn't too bad. I enjoyed drinking this one, it was really hoppy for a saison. This beer didn't wow me, really. I think I enjoyed the original to this one, and I would much rather have a Fantome if I am going to have a saison. I would like to find this in bottles to try to compare it to the draught version."
"D--I enjoy this a lot. This is my third bottle in about a month and I am usually a Quad guy. This is a nice change of pace."
"Poured a huge, creamy, off-white head that left a thick coat of lace. Hazy golden beer glows like the sun. Aroma of tart lemon and candy coated flowers. Damn, things are looking good. Lightly sweet pale malt flavor mixes with moderately strong flavor of alcohol. There is none of the tartness suggested in the aroma, and the finish is a bitter combination of herbal hops and alcohol. I'm a bit disappointed by the flavor. If it tasted anything like that flavor it would have been amazing. There is a bit of the sugar and floral flavors in there if you really concentrate, but boy I wish they were stronger. The mouthfeel is fairly light and smooth from massive amount of fine carbonation within. I've got a couple more glasses left in the bottle and I'm hoping it will change as I drink it, but right now it's just overly alchoholic tasting with a boozy finish."
"I could drink two to three of these and it would put me where I need to be."
"This beer was poured into a .25L becker glass. The body was hazy straw with a creamy head that laced nicely and left a nice film over the beer. The smell was sweet pilsner and wheat malts with characteristic saison yeast spiciness and a welcome hop aroma. The taste exhibited much of the same qualities with a sweet malt presence up front but the strength of this one and the alcohol associated with it, seems to amplify the malt characteristic and subdue the spiciness from the yeast. The spices and the hops are still present, but they are restrained a bit due to the strength of this beer. The mouthfeel is light enough, however, which is impressive due to the strength. Overall, a great beer, but for me, I find the regular saison or even a Hennepin to be much more enjoyable."
"D: Pretty good. I found the alcohol to be a little intrusive."
"Overall, this is one delicious beer. Best wishes indeed!!"
"Very drinkable and very easy going down for a 9.5%er. Excellent!!"
"Drank really easy for the style & alcohol, I wonder how the bottled version is?? Pretty good from the looks of the reviews I'm seeing. One of the better saisons I've had"
"Bar none the best Farmhouse Ive had. Excellent with Spinning Spider (Madison County, NC) goat cheese -- chevre and goat gouda especially. I cant say enough about the fine balance and quaffability of this one. I'll be buying this one each winter for sure."
"This is a sipper. A special brew to me. Exotic for this Yankee. Loved it!"
"Poured a hazy gold. Plenty of carbonation and an off white head. Nice clove/coriander yeast aromas with some malts. Great mouthfeel. A little sugary sweetness. Dry, slightly spicy finish with a little alcohol coming through. I didn't write much down when I was drinking it, but I really enjoyed it!"
"Pours a clouded gold with a white head. Nose is thick with mild yeasts and a slightly sweet tone. Flavor is hearty with an earthen tone that is very present. Overall a very robust and heavy flavor ride. Feel is good. A nice level of bubble and smooth on the tongue. Overall very drinkable. I might have drunk this one a bit too young, though. Id be interested to see what some age would do to it. If I wasnt moving in 2.5 weeks, I would have let this one sit for a while."
"Very tasty, grab some this time of year while they last."
"My first pour was golden orange and similar to Saison DuPont. It smells very musty, grassy, and some mustard seed (?). The taste is peppery with orange peel zestiness, perfect mouthfeel, very nice, easy to drink Saison for a cold Colorado winter, can't find the alcohol but I'm sure it'll rear its ugly head once I black out."
"One of those beers that any fermentation enthusiast must try at least once. I recall many years ago, before I was obsessed with craft beer, picking a few bottles up because of the intriguing bottle and price tag. I was amazed by the flavors within. Ever since I have looked forward to this time of year so I can buy a few bottles."
"Full body, low carbonation. Alcohol is very well hidden. Still, maybe too big for me, for this particular style. Reminded me of a wheat wine, with spices."
"D: A good saison from Dupont, it's not as drinkable as some of their lighter in alcohol offerings, but certainly a good beer for the holiday, went very well with Christmas dinner."
"Cork pops substantially and that dupont dank smells comes roiling out. i swear when you open this beer you can smell it across the room. Pours a straw yellow with orange tints and a very, very slight haziness. Good head that retains quite well. The nose of the brew is by far one of the most aromatic out there. Smells of light fruits maybe pear and settles into a nose of belgian yeast and spice. The taste is incredibly delightful with notes of apple and pear and that saison flavor that only comes from belgium. the apple flavors really come out in the finish and especially in the aftertaste. Great spice yeast and hop mixture and even a little fructose sugar taste. The carbonation is perfect and not to abrasive like you would find in some saisons. Slides right down the throat. If I couldnt read i would not beleive there was 9.5 abv in this fantastic farmhouse. By far my favorite saison, think it would be wonderful with another year or two under its belt. the most drinkable saison ive ever had, and the best and most noticeabley lingering aftertaste of any brew ive ever had. Great choice!"
"Good stuff!"
"The beer pours a hazy pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. There are a few floaties present. The aroma is great. It has a nice pale malt scent along with a light earthiness and fruity yeast aroma. This is a near perfect aroma. The taste is great. It has an incredibly smooth pale malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry and earthy with some excellent yeast notes. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine saison. It's crisp and fruity with just the right amount of musty/earthiness; a good drinker."
"Upon pouring into a glass, the beer displays a beautiful hazy golden color with very fine carbonation. Once settled, the head is about a quarter of an inch and very creamy. The aroma is a bit off at first, but after a few minutes hints of citrus and spice show through. A doughy aroma lingers behind. The flavors are immense, beginning with citrus, spice, and then followed with a long dry finish that lingers on the palate for minutes. I found this beer very easy to drink, and anyone looking to try something new during the holiday season, I would deffinitely reccommend it."
"Very nice. This is something I'd definitely want to have again. Lucky for me, I've been seeing this on the shelves a lot more lately."
"Taste/mouthfeel: Fruity and wheaty at first, similar to a Wit or Hefe Weizen. Carbonation is soft but ample. The finish brings out out long-lasting notes of citrus and hops, with a peppery bite and a slight tang. Complex but somewhat astringent and boozy."
"Overall I will support this beers high rating; this is truly outstanding and something I will actively seek out in the future."
"Pours a brilliant, cloudy yellow gold with plenty of head and yeast in suspension. It looks like the Saison Dupont Vieille Provision. It doesn't smell like it, however: the nose holds much more in the way of zesty hops, candi sugar, pilsner malts and a ton of phenols with that fruity Dupont yeast, which throws some lemongrass and orange (maybe burnt orange zest?) into the mix. On the palate. this is a heavy saison with plenty of residual sweetness that could use some time in the bottle to dry out. Still, the flavors are great: smooth, pale malts, creamy orange-and-spice, phenols in the mid-palate. Growing hop bitterness, with orange blossoms, toward the finish, which is dry and refreshing for such a big beer. Mouthfeel is thick and full of fine carbonation. I wonder if it will thin out as the beer ages, but it's still pretty great. Overall, this is a fantastic beer. It's kind of like the Vieille Provision dialed up a bit, but there's nothing wrong with that. Fantastic."
"D: Something keeps drawing me back despite the mustiness! A certain inexplicable attraction!"
"hazy golden with a white head that has pretty good retention and good lace. smell is really nice. nose is less barnyardy than foret or saison d, but more spicy. mainly pepper, corriander, some clove. a little lemongrassy smell and some musty to go with it. taste is basically what the nose suggests. nice and warming. medium full like their other saisons with a nice amount of carbonation. very drinkable for a 9.5%er. i'll enjoy a few more of these this holiday season."
"Aren't we all so precious just for having this? Hazy deep golden, fuzzy head that calms down in time. Nose of minerals and earth; some tartness. Flavors of lemongrass, lazy grains, and clove. It tasted the closest yet to a cross between a Saison and Hefeweizen. In regards to a regular Saison Dupont, this one had much more fruit, spice and body, but I'm not going to be fooled into worshiping this beer just because it's a limited edition holiday Saison. Good-to-great...yes. Awesome? Nah. You can live off the Foret Organic in the meantime."
"It's a mind-shatterer."
"Highly drinkable. In fact this is sessionable in the extreme."
"Avec les Bons Voeux de la Brasserie Dupont, the beer's full name, translates as 'with the best wishes of the Brewery Dupont'. Thanks Brasserie Dupont. And thank you for this incredibly delicious, world-class saison. It may not be the best I've ever had (Fantome Saison), but it's close. Really, really close."
"Highly recommended!"
"Great stuff!"
""
" Refreshing yet full of complex, evolving flavors that goes great with any lighter dish or seafood - but just fine all by itself."
"Drinkability: Since this is so strong and a bit heavy, this drinks more like a tripel than a saison. It's not bad, but it lacks depth which wouldn't be so much of a problem in a smaller saison. A beer this big needs to have some savorability to it. This isn't a bad beer, but in my opinion the original Dupont is much better."
"Cork said 2005. Pours a straw color with a huge, fluffy white head. Nice lacing as well. They don't look much better than this, particularly for the alcohol content. Smell and taste were somewhat disappointing. Smell had strong scent of alcohol, which overpowered most of the other aromas. Some faint spiciness was also noticeable. Taste was average. Alcohol was at the forefront with mostly spicy/peppery flavors following. Became pretty easy to drink after the first few sips, especially for being 9.5% ABV. Not a bad beer, but definitely prefer some of the other versions of the style."
"***Further note, I do not suggest aging this. I had a 2004 not too long ago, and it was something of a sweet mess. Gone was the amazing perfumey dryness. In its place was a sweet, gooey Cointreau flavor. If you have 'em, I say drink them. There's not much to be gained by aging this, as good as it is fresh."
"Mouthfeel is on the lighter side with an explosive carbonation. This one goes down incredibly easily for a 9.5% abv. A throughly enjoyable saison from Dupont and one of the benchmarks for the style. I will need to get another fresh bottle soon! (As a side note, the final yeast pour amplifies the flavor profile greatly and adds a bit of smoothness as well.)"
"good stuff!"
"Shared a gift of one brother with the other brother (who actually received the gift). Thanks to both of yahs."
"Poured from the 750ml, corked bottle into a Duvel tulip glass. A single finger of creamy white head rests on a cloudy, golden-orange body with a bit of suspended sediment and some lively carbonation. Interesting aroma of tangy yeast and mild citrus notes, with a whiff of clove and hops. Palate is a mix of sweet malt and funky yeast up front, with citrus and Euro hop notes coming through mid-palate. The malt becomes sweeter and more assertive at the swallow, ending with a fairly dry finish. Mouthfeel is creamy, lively, and just about perfect. Highly drinkable for such a strong ale. While I may not feel as strongly about it as some of my colleagues (maltmaster420 calls it a ""desert island beer""), I'm very pleased with this one."
"Drinkability is wonderful, I had no problem polishing off the 750."
"Drinkability: An outstanding saision. So full of delicous flavors and complexity, as usual the individual tastes became more pronounced as the beer warmed a bit, and i was surprised at all the great flavors that opened up. Even at 9.5%abv it retains those awsome saison refreshing qualities. I need to get some more to cellar, i would proudly bust one out at a special occaison where a toast or good drink was in order!"
"Overall- I really love this beer, I like the style in general and this one stands out with its alcoholic strength and spiciness. Alot of higher alcohol beers nowadays are really sneaky and the alcohol creeps up on you, not so with this beer and that's not necessarily a bad thing."
"One LOUD POP of the cork. Pours a nice slightly cloudy yellowish color, nice carbonation, nice two-finger plus creamy white head, tons of sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is of malts, hops, belgian yeast, pears, grapes, and spices. The taste is sweet/tangy, malty, yeasty, grassy, and spicy. Medium body, a complex brew. Drinkable, Saison's are not my best style of brew, so I cannot drink alot of it."
"Overall: An outstanding Saison and an outstanding beer, period. This beer represents the best of the white ale style to me: crisp, light, balanced, and consummately enjoyable. This is one of a very few of the 350+ beers Ive reviewed so far that Id stock up on."
"Pours a very cloudy yellow/gold, looks like a weissbier, huge thick white head forms, stays forever, great lacing and retention. Smell is very sweet, malty, wheat, spices, very yeasty, nice citrus kick, pretty crazy aroma. Taste is toffee and butter, citrus, very yeasty, alcohol through the middle, wheat, crazy flavours, very dry bitter finish, very spicy. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with high carbonation. Maybe overrated in my opinion but a real treat."
"Like most trip/quads, the warmth of the booze makes this a nontrivial drink, but the smell and taste are just carried so well on it that you don't hesitate. Very true to it's style, but with a bit more backbone, this is an insane value for under ten bucks."
"Bottom line, this beer is the bomb...there are very few I'd choose before this, Fantome Ete of course, and regular Fatome, particularly on FRESH draft. If you see it, grab them and save for a memorable night of enjoyment! I chose this last bottle for watching Pitt lose the Sweet 16 to UCLA, *sigh*, at least it was Jamie Dixon's mentor, Pitt's last coach, Ben Howland. Still sucks!"
"D  Very tasty. The alcohol is exceptionally well masked. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability: A really dynamic saison, more alcohol and bitterness than ones I've had. It's like a quirky hefeweizen in flavor. Mouthfeel and appearance are highlights."
"A very complex saison. Bitter/citrus more than sweet. I will definately look forward to having another."
"Opinion: All I can say is WOW! This beer is no doubt the best Saison I have ever tasted. There are so many dimensions to this beer that I am sure that if I sat here for the next two hours (I can't because checkout time is in about 1 hour) and drank it, that I would be able to pick out something every time I took a sip. I would love to be able to make a beer this complex, and I think that I am now inspired to try. I wouldn't say that this beer pushed me over the edge to where a Saison is my beer of choice over a Tripel, but this one is really good."
"drinkability is good. somewhat balanced, but the alcohol still comes through fairly strong."
"Densely complex with great carbonation that fits the beer too a tee. Bitterly dry finish with some alcohol in the chest. Highly acidic. Velvety smooth and in your face. Full of spices, rich and delicate alike. Very yeasty with bready aspects. Again barnyard is the name of the game with lemon and cantaloupe dominating the mid palate. A beer that you could keep pulling more and more out of with time."
"Notes: I liked it. I'm not so sure that the High ABV fits this style very well (regardless of style its too much for the body of this offering). It seemed a bit hot to me compared to other saison's that I've liked better."
"Excellent, excellent saison. And a very unique take on the style. It really is a Winter saison, with more body, stronger flavors and the like. If you haven't had it, go and pick some up. Recommended."
"Very smooth considering the amount of carbonation. Faint pear flavors are tempered by a rather pleasant, yet biting bitterness that is coupled with a dose of black pepper. Finish is dry, and warming at the same time, as the alcohol makes its presence known. A pleasant, easy to drink beer, though not truly exciting."
"Cheers!"
"I could drink a bunch of this and would love to have it on tap. Fat Chance!"
"D- The subtle complexities of the malt give way to a nice bitterness that has some good but smooth depth aswell. Very nice complexity and blend of flavors."
"Pours a clear golden yellow with abit of debris,yeast, and a huge white foamy head. The head is giant and leaves a fine amount of lacing. The smell is sweet malt,candy sugar,and a fruity citrus that really dominates the nose. The taste is like the smell and other Saisons, sweet malt,Belgian candy sugar,lemon, coriander and pepper,alcohol, and lastly,a ""bisquity' taste thats really strong and good. The m/f is heavier for a Saison,but enjoyable and the flavors mix well while hiding the alcohol pretty solidly. All in all this is a top notch Saison from a legendary brewery. Enjoy."
"It may still be the case that I've got a bad bottle -- which makes me very curious about what a GOOD bottle of this stuff tastes like!"
"This one set me back a serious $9.75 here at my local Northcoast Coop. At this price you would expect this to be incredible. It was indeed excellent, and maybe even worth the price. Poured a rich gold color with some haze and with a big fat white head that rose up out ot the glass like a cauliflower. Rich nose of fruits like bananas and pineapple, along with apricot, spices, and hops as well. So many aromas words kind of fail me here. Very smooth mouthfeel. Flavors are rich and delightful. Slighty sour and bitter finish. It simply tastes sublime. Exceptional beer."
"Great saison, I can see why it's rated as one of the best."
"Poured from tap into a bulb, this is a hazy golden-straw in color, with a full two-fingered white head of medium duration. Neither quite clear nor genuinely opaque, but slightly hazy due to the chill factor and the suspended yeast. Lacing is evident and clings persistently throughout. Massive, bold nose is quite amazing: pale malts start the show and are quickly overrun by notes of clove, white pepper, and alcohol. Yeast? Yes, there's yeast in the nose too, chewy and bready. Very little apparent bitterness on the nose, but neither is there a sweet, bland maltiness. First sip is a real shocker, a mellow ""come hither"" malt quality gently coaxes you into a position of unsuspecting submission, next thing you know there's a wave of intense fruit notes: pineapple, cherry, pear, and marzipan, alongside a swelling, hot booziness. Somewhat tropical: throw an umbrella,some cube, and a dash of rum in thisand it would make for an interesting Tiki drink! As it warms there's more evidence of an underlying hop bitterness, with some aromatic and floral notes (pineapple, hibiscus) but they are nigh-well overpowered by the substantial malt backbone and warming alcohol. Moderately full-bodied, with a piquant, zesty sweet/sour pucker on the tongue. Mild grainyness to the malt is perceptible, but is largely masked by the hot alcohol. Well-balanced despite its strength, and should readily appeal to fans of the Belgian Golden and Tripel styles. A very substantial offering, it may also be quite a challenge for some, and is definitely not a beer to take lightly."
"Cork had 2005 stamped on it. Poured a huge fluffy head and the barnyard skunk smell was immediatley noticeable. Taste had more hops than I was expecting but that great Saison Dupont taste was right there. Do I want to spend an extra $5 dollars for this over Saison Dupont? I don't think so but still a great beer and worthy of a try."
"D- like this one alot more than their regular saison, definitely a great beer for a special occasion"
"2006. A very hazy ale with a soft white pillow head; much lighter than I remember. Biscuits, white pepper, and Belgian yeast nose. Strong saison body, similar to Dupont Saison, but with some numbing alcohol and without any residual sweetness. Finishes dry and somewhat hot. Notable hops. Gentle, but very active spiciness coming from the carbonation, the alcohol, and the hops. Very good and refreshing, great for this cold January night which is in the 20s here. Cheers and happy new year!"
"Avec Les Bons Voeux pours a hazy golden color with a huge white head from a green 750 ml corked and caged bottle. That funky Belgian smell is somewhat present, so is pepper and fruit. This is really a nice tasty saison that started out on the fruitier side and ended up more herbal or medicianal in nature toward the end of the bottle. Very enjoyable. Recommended."
"Corked and caged 750mL. The bottle opened with a loud pop - I was expecting a gusher, but things stayed under control. As I poured the first glass, there wasn't much other than a scant bit of hazy, straw yellow beer beneath an enormous bright white head. As the foam settled it left copious amounts of lacing behind. What an aroma! Sweet malts and candy mingle with ripe fruit, grape skin, spicy alcohol and grassy hops. First sip: starts out with sweetness and fruit, but this quickly gives way to significant bitterness and spicy alcohol warmth that lingers. Bready yeast, slight tartness, and grassy hops fill in the middle. Off-dry, with a medium body and fairly high carbonation. Plenty of warmth and a nearly slick texture. Very, very good. The complexity is wonderful, almost like tasting different beers with each sip. Highly recommended."
"D: A delicious beer, perfect for the yuletide time. I am especially glad to have had it while my beloved Nittany Lions upset the Vols in the Outback Bowl."
"Highly recommended, even with the one flaw I perceive."
"Lemony-tart bitterness and Saaz funk goodness up front. Sour apple malt turns sweeter and sugary-er mid-palate. Some tropical fruit and pear sweetness in there, but never gets too sweet. Overall this remains a mostly dry beer. Lemon citrus bitterness increases in the finish and becomes more herbal, resinous and numbing. Alcohol is present and warming. Picking up some leftover powdered sugar too. Slight tart/sour barnyard funk throughout lets me know that this is still a Dupont creation. Slightly more complex than the regular Saison. Medium-bodied with a smooth, tiny-bubble feel. Would be nice to be able to get this year round. As it is, this shall become a winter staple for me!"
"Pours a cloudy orange golden with a light off white head and moderate lacing Aromas of bubblegum, wax, bananas, and cloves. Taste starts out with hops up front followed by a pleasant waxy creaminess, a little cherry fruitiness, and a late hit of hop bitterness and an aftertaste of faint cloves. Mouthfeelis dry and slightly tannic throughout, but with a nice creamy finish. Very drinkable, especially for the alcohol."
"This brew pours a hazy pale orange color with a thick, creamy, fluffy, off-white head. Lacing is complete, and leaves large chunks along the sides of the glass. The aroma is of citrus, orange, earth, and yeast. The taste is like the aroma, but a little more bold. The mouthfeel is outstanding for a saison. It is very silky and smooth with the perfect amount of carbonation. Overall, this is one of the better saisons I have had, and I will certainly drink it again."
"Not a very rustic saison, but in a more plush style. Not my favorite saison, but supberb and as well made as any with exceptional balance."
"Corked and caged 750ml bottle poured into a tulip glass. Pours a hazy golden orangish color with a good sized white head. The aroma is nothing short of phenomenal. The aroma is citrusy and spicey with a lot of fruits and a touch of barnyard funk that I have come to love in good saisons. The taste starts pretty tame with a nice malt presence that quickly gives way to a musty and spicey finish with a perfect dose of hops! The only real detraction of this beer are the medicinal notes and phenols in the taste that affects the drinkability a little bit. Overall, this is a wonderful saison that is definately recommended."
"The body is quite creamy with a crisp carbonation. Very drinkable for such a strong beer. Highly recommended for a saison lover."
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable for the style, maybe a bit above average overall. Might be hindered a bit by the peppery finish, but I like that."
"This was a nice beer. I am learning to appreciate Belgian beers more and more."
"Great one, much better than the Saison Dupont, which seems one dimensional compared to something like this. This beer is lovely with some of my favorite stanky washed rind cheeses, get yourself some livarot and go to town with this one."
"D: Bummer this wasn't falling in the spectrum of some of my more favorite styles or I'd probably really love this beer. But I can appreciate its subtleties and complexities."
"Good, hazy, saison looks. Like a pale yellow honey sun look. maybe the nectar of the Belgian Gods??? Couldn't see any bubbles. Light lacing and small head, but good film throughout. One of the sweetest smelling, yet authentic saison's Ever. Lots of very sophisticated candy smells along with the pale malts and light sytgian hops. Smooth mouthfeel that just begs to be paired with some unique Belgian food like Monkfish. In a creamy garlic sauce with some shallots."
"One of the better Saisons that I've ever had. This is a totally different beer than the typical Saison Dupont. Very enjoyable overall, and highly recommended. Pairs excellently with roast pork tenderloin and twice backed potatoes."
"Mouth: The malt is thick and slightly bitter with a nice roast character to it. Bitterness is well balanced with some yeasty sweet and spicy flavors and citrus acidity. Reminded of the hops by the gently prodding fresh cut grass flavor. Mouthfeel is incredibly bubbly and prickly and consistent all the way through the mouth."
"D- This is a truly great beer. Does it beat a Fantome? Thats a very close call. Just a GREAT! beer. Must be one of my favorites. What a great choice for NBS! CHEERS!"
"flavor is similarly balanced. same honey sweetness and a spicy bite, then an astringent, sour and tart drying finish. alcohol is nicely hidden; comes off as a very drinkable, balanced beer, if not quite memorable or world-beating."
"Aroma was light, slightly sweet with a hint of citrus and spices. More spice in the aroma than in the beer. Flavor was moderatly malty with essentially no hops character. Didnt finish as dry as the other Dupont Saison."
"What a great beer!"
"Simply, it's a splendidly enjoyable blend of the best things in beer from Belgium. It appeals to each sense it touches, and it finishes the show with a fresh, drinkable flourish. The ABV is credible, and the sole limiting factor of note, but it's a pleasant warmer. With best wishes, it delivers on its salutation."
"i love saisons and this may be the best i've had yet, if not one of the best beer's i've ever had. I can see this becoming a staple. The second half of the bottle went extremly well with Mexican food. (i'm sure it would kick ass with Thai or Vietnamese as well.)"
"The most explosive cork I've ever seen hit the ceiling and ricocheted across the kitchen on opening this monster. The pour yields a two inch head, slow to fall. It leaves thick lacing as it does, too. It's quite rocky, and the color of butter pecan ice cream. Color is a very slightly hazy golend yellow, with very active carbonation. Nose is of sour apples, cut grass, sugar, and diacetyl. First sip yields spicy floral hops with nice bitterness, which moves through sugar and sour apples to a warming, somewhat dry finish. Aftertaste is full of nice grain flavor, very malty. Pouring in the yeast of course mellows the flavor, and makes the beer near opaque.Mouthfeel is medium-light, but with very high tingly carbonation. Marvelously warming in the belly. This is a marvelous saison, my new favorite in the style. Pairs excellently with spicy food, as well."
"Taste is rich caramel and molasses. Hints of vanilla. Oaky with sherry notes. Lots o' alcohol as it finishes. Very dry finish, dires out quick from all the richly sweet flavors up front. In the finish, one taste comes out again and again: Juniper berries. Not sure if they're used but I couldn't get them out of my head. Mouth is dry and full bodied. This beer's a treat. I want more and I want more to age for a couple years."
"2005 vintage. Rich gold in colour with strong carbonation. Delicate aromas of floral and grassy hops, spicy yeast, citrus fruits, and barnyard. Surprisingly peppery in the mouth, with some alcohol notes becoming apparent. In this sense, it was very much tripel-like. More funk and citrus flavor notes made their way into the mix as the beer warmed. A bit heavy handed in the alcohol and yeast department flavor wise, but still a good saison... my 29th bithday beer."
"It was highly carbonated, and had some floating yeasties. Beyond the skunk I could smell some grassy aromas, and the taste included some honey-like sweetness and coriander. It could be really good but tough to tell."
"Im coming to the realization that this beer will be my new highest rated beer on BA. It is the closest thing to perfection Ive tasted and it is clearly the best Saison Ive had. I am stunned at how great this beer is! I am one happy dude right about now. Thank you mdinges, youve made my day. I want many more bottles of this. Im officially spoiled. World Class. Highly Recommended."
"This brew pours with an amazing white fluffy head. The color is a deep yellow/gold with plenty of haze. Nice head retention and a decent lace to boot. The smell is very earthy with a mild sweet breadiness. Fairly spicy with hints of lemon, you get a bit of alcohol fume if you inhale deeply enough. The taste is spicy and peppery, with citrus notes. It remains mostly unsweet, and yields a nice bready, sour finish. Alcohol is not real noticible in the taste. Mothfeel is excellent, lighter in body, but with an amazing bubbly zest, and intense smoothness. It floods the entire mouth, increasing my overall enjoyment. A great offering overall, it tastes great although lacks a real uniqueness. To me it didn't separate itself from the Saison Dupont, but it still is a delight..."
"750 mL champagne bottle that is corked and caged, with 2005 on the cork. It pours a nice hazed honey/gold with an inch of off-white head that leaves some decent lacing. The aroma is lightly skunky, with pine/juniper and grassy hops along with lemon and orange peel and some phenols. It starts medium with airy carbonation and a sharp bitterness from the pungent medicinal phenols, along with grapefruit, honey?, and a grassy/musty character. Drinkability suffers due to the sharp phenols, which are nice and make for a good complexity, but are not my favorite byproduct of brewing. Overall though, it is a good, complex saison that would probably age very well."
"Note: Older yellow label with a faded background of a biere cellar from Aug 2005; caged and corked green 750ml bottle."
"This is a wonderfull beer, without a doubt, I have never given these good reviews to a beer, this beer is great in smell and taste and is highly drinkable!"
"I always worry when I give a beer very high marks as to whether my sense of taste might be out of whack but not with this one. Pretty much a perfect Saison, throw away all that champagne and serve this for special occasions. Only possible flaw here is that the alcohol level won't let you drink a lot of it at once."
"D - high, easily downed, not to sweet, acidic, or bitter"
"Drinkability: A very nice light beer, easy drinking and refreshing. Fit for a summer's day."
"Drinkability: I found this to be nicely refreshing for a dry brew. Easy drinking but the alcohol can creep up on you. Give it a try."
"I think this beer would be a decent session beer. It is high in alcohol, so that would be afactor. However, the flavor is plesent. I think I could throw back a few of these. I am happy to have had the chance to have yet another great Dupont beers."
"Drinkability is very high. I'm generally not sophisticated enough to truly gauge a truly great saison but this is highly drinkable, well-balanced, very enjoyable brew which leaves me wanting to try again."
"Served in a corked bottle. Pours a cloudy yellow with a large frothy, rocky head. Inhaled the a whiff of the beer and knew it was going to be good. Has hints of yeast and some spicy notes. Took a sip and was delighted. Yeasty and spicy flovors fill the mouth. Good mouthfeel. Very drinkable, will look out for this one again, too bad its only seasonal."
"Was thrilled to pick this up for the Holidays. I love Saison Dupont, so I was really looking forward to drinking this one. I was definitely not disspointed. The head and lacing were world class. Aroma was very yeasty, grassy/hay, and really spicy. Before I tasted this baby I thought it might be too spicy. I was wrong. It was nice and tart and not too spicy. It would be hard to drink more than one of these and still be able to talk, but I'll try. I'll be interested to learn how six months in the cellar will affect this one."
"It was a pleasure to try this beer on draught tonight at Toronado in San Francisco, California. Pale yellow in color with a large head of foam. The aroma is distinctly Dupont, subtle, fruity with hints of hay, glue and pear, lots of pear. The aroma isnt very captivating quite honestly, but the taste, that is another story. Dry, with big, almost sour yeasty/farmhouse notes with big fruit flavors (pear, apple), caramel and this is awfully hoppy by the way. A very good beer. But this is far from being as magical as the 8% Blaugies beers and some of the Fantome beers."
"A very contemplative, and evocative drink that was a rare find not in availability, but in quality. Seek it and enjoy the best wishes of the brewer, they mean it."
"Drinkability: A nice blend of a variety of complex elements"
"Mouthfeel is smooth, with honey, and yeastyness swirling around."
"full delicious taste, obviously high abv but not overpowering, it works well with the flavor. bitter finish. active carbonation and a lively mouthfeel, good aftertaste. i can't tell what makes this different from a belgian strong pale or even a tripel, but i really like it. and at about $10 per bottle, this is indescribably better than any wine you could get for the same price. dangerously drinkable, i could drink one after another (and pass out after 2) highly recommended"
"excellent beer, ""beer", is almost not a sufficient word...excellent stuff."
"Hazy golden straw with persistent waves of rising carbonation and an overwhelmingly huge rocky head. Nose is of yeasty apple juice, grassy hops, and dusty barnyard funk. Sour apple wine, flavors akin to dry green grape skins and a powdery floral finish. Creamy mouthfeel, almost juicy, yet dry all the same. A real treat of a saison from one of the best producers of the style out there. Best wishes!"
"Hazed golden/orange shade. Frothy white cap. Lace is abundant and clingy. Funky aroma. Lemon peel, barnyard, mustiness, yeastiness, citrus and leather. Bright citric tones are notice first upon tasting. Funky barnyard character is noted. Lemon essence. Hoppy and bitter. Earthy and herbal. Some alcohol is perceptible, but not a lot. Medium-bodied. Lively carbonation. Quite the enjoyable Saison."
"Aroma has a nose tickling spiciness that hints at citrus rind and sour sauce. Amber with yellow tints and a nice fluffy two finger thick, white head. Very yeasty fore, mild sourness and a ton of floral and herbal notes that are both spicy and sweet. Another fun drinking Saison."
"A nice Saison; juicy and well spiced. The alcohol presence is definitely noticeable, but it doesn't hinder the ale's true flavors."
"The taste is spicy and tangy but very drinkable. This is a definite favorite of mine in the farmhouse / saison style."
"Pours a murky orange into the glass. Thin head that remained as the liquid level in the glass was depleted. Sporadic lacing down the inside of the glass as I drank it down. Tart, musty, spicy smell and taste. A good beer for the style. Not my favorite type, but I would have it again."
"The flavor is peppery and yeasty, a bit lemony and earthy too. A slight funky, musty flavor as well. It is medium-full in body and drying in the finish. It hides is strength well. A very good beer."
"more. Avec Les Bon... DOH !!"
"Maybe the ideal New Year's Eve brew? Looks awfully good in the wine glass. Hazy straw with a lovely depth, big foam, stubborn, and hyperactive tiny-bubble carbonation. Popping the cork released a blast of barnyard, which is more subdued in the glass. Grassy, mildly hoppy nose and clean malts. The taste is peppery, citrus rind, touch of sugars from the malts, and a bit of funk. This is balanced and the flavors blend very smoothly. Mouthfeel is medium, but fills out toward the end. Long dry finish. I love this one. I've also seen it available in my area. I'll be obtaining more of these."
"Brilliant!!!! This beer works equally well as a short apertif (it is 9.5%! although the alcohol never shows) or a night cap, and it pairs well with an amazing variety of foods and events: it's a bristling contrast to garlic bread that also cuts through to cleanse the palate... it's big enough to withstand the onslaught of a ripe Stilton or Bleu cheese... it works quite well with mussels in an herbed white sauce... and it makes an amazing complement/contrast (can that be?) to spicy and sweet Pad Thai. And as for situations and event, it also works equally well at mom's Thanksgiving dinner or a welcomed Christmas nightcap, and especially as a replacement for Champagne at your New Year's toast!"
"750 ml corked and bailed bottle. 2005 on cork. $8.99 at Brawley's."
"2004 edition...pale medium gold appearance, a slight greenish cast near the top, lightly but evenly sedimented. Nice head, creamy and condensed with a slick appearance and good shapes. Thick laces on the glass. Good aroma, bright grassy notes and white wine grapes, spices of white pepper and mace. Light mouthfeel, plenty of carbonation (more than I usually like). Flavor is as bright and brassy as a new penny, tart apple, stainless steel, tons of unripe fruit and skins. Interesting in that it does have a good balance though it can be missed. Slurry of honey and some funk actually comes later rather than earlier. Alcohol adds yet another dimension. A lot of beer to see here, folks."
"(750ml). My favorite style, and this is one of the best. Similar to the Foret (despite not being classified as a Saison), sharp and spicy (certainly more so than most of my favorite strong pales). I love this brewery, and I was thrilled to see this brew appear at a local store. Plenty of hops, great apple-like aroma. This has been a hard beer to find around here. I hope this will now be a regular for me. Don't miss this if you see it."
"This is a terrific, champagne-like saison with all the requisite bitterness, fluffiness sweetness, spiciness and citrus-ness. And with this one -you get the added benefit of a kick in the ass after a 750ml! Superb!"
"Poured a bubbly cloudy peach with huge white pillowy head and lots of sticky lace. Smells vinous, peppery, fruity, and grainy. Honey and sweet grains on the front of the palate, followed with a giant kick of medicinal bitter alcohol, a touch of funk, and lingering leafy dryness. Medium-light with strong carbonation and slight creaminess. Not the best Dupont brew; the flavor is over-balanced with overwhelming phenolic bitterness."
"Pours a fabulous gold with a luscious head of beautiful living froth. No lace. Smell is of a well-made Belgian--clearly floral and gentle but potent behind the scenes. The taste doesnt let down either, I can clearly see why this is regarded so highly. Smell has that pungent I am stronger than I taste character. Very nice. Mouthfeel is as smooth as can be for a beer of this complexity. While I might not fully trust my fellow BAs as a rule on food, I can definitely trust them on beers. Good scoring guys/girls. I can only second that emotion"
"Poured a hazy gold color with a small white head that left nice lacing on the glass. Earthy aroma, with some citrus and yeast as well. Spicy coriander, orange peel, yeast, and alcohol noticeable in the taste. Mouthfeel was slightly carbonated. I think I like McKenzie's better."
"When I first poured the bottle it was a strw yellow with a teeny tiny bubbeled froathy white head, and a bazillion bubbles climbing the walls of my glass. When I finally got the rest into my glass, I got all the yeast. Not sure if that is a good or bad thing. It has the horsey Belgian smell, with some Granny Smith apples thrown in for good measure. The taste is great. Pepper and apples and doughy yeast goodness. The after taste has a light lingering alcohol thing going on that works well. I would drink this everyday if I weren't buzzing so hard now!!!"
"Overall: Quite a nice saison. Just exquisitely crafted and extremely delicate for its heft. I'm really glad I found this one."
"Drinkability: All around an excellent beer. The flavors work well together and are well matched. It's smooth and complex and what a beer should do. Well done. It is just lovely on-tap."
"Pours a very strong straw color, almost a light orange, with a 4 finger head that falls very slowly. The nose is just divine. Lots of lemony citrusyness, a light tart character and a blast of spicey and a very light barnyard character. I like it a lot. The flavor is really good. Orangey lemon citrus flavors hit, but they are creamy as well. A nice blast of spiceyness from the yeasties really comes through as well. There is a slight tartness that stays on the tongue on the finish. I really like it. Very clean and refreshing...crisp as well. There is also a slight drying quality here as well. No hint at all of the alcohol. 9.5% has to be a lie. The feel is moderate to thick with a moderate carbonation. Very refreshing for a big brew. Drinkability could not be better. I'm finding this beer is disappearing rather quickly from my glass. No alcohol presence. Very good flavor and nose. All around solid beer."
"Pours a golden color with a an extremely tall puffy head that has good retention and leaves lots of lacing on the glass. The aroma has lots of fruit esters. Some slight Belgian funk as well. Little bit of sweetness. Smells really good. The flavor has a lot of light fruit and a lot of spices. Little bit of funk in the flavor. Quite a bit going on here. Very tasty. The mouthfeel is light, but has some creaminess as well. The drinkability is really good for such high alcohol. It's very warming as you drink it."
"I had this on tap last month at the Hop Leaf and was quite blown away with it. When I came across it in the store the next day there was only 2 bottles, which me and my friend each grabbed one. This was a corked and caged 750ml bottle with 2004 on the cork. Cloudy straw yellow body with a full head of white fluffy head. Great retention as the head rides out the session leaving thick sheets of lace coating the glass after each sip. Big fruit notes of apples, pears and other fruits come up in the nose with a light sweetness. Some peppery hops in the mix as are a few other spices. Notes of yeast and a slight funk are also present. Flavor also has a big fruit component with a variety of lighter fruits mingling with the grassy hops and black pepper. A bit biscuity, good yeast flavors and a touch of the old funk really bring this together nicely. Where is the alcohol? Fairly full mouthfeel with a very crisp feel. Bubbly on the tongue and quite refreshing. Great drinkability as well, I could drink this all day or until that sneaky 10% shows itself. Fantastic brew big ass Saison or Belgian Pale ale. Must try if you enjoy the style and come across this."
"So they say this is 10.5% - wow! The candy sugars in addition to malt make this beer a big one. Color is gorgeous - cloudy with golden color and truly brilliant. Smell is subtle but reminds me of American lager alomst with slight hops.Taste is pleasant and mild despite high alcohol and very much straight and to the point. Low carbonation but full mouthfeel that dissipates to subtle aftertaste. Could drink this beer for a very long time...until asleep."
"Extraordinarily drinkable until I fall on the floor from too many!"
"A seasonal beer with good wishes intended...supposedly, according to the owner of the distribution company, this one clocks in at 10.5%. It's only slightly apparent, mostly dictated by the slight aroma and detection of candy sugar. Very little nose detectable - actually gave me a lager-like aroma. This may have been a result of the draft version - neglecting the bottle condition. It was poured a cloudy golden color, rather brilliant, actually. The higher alcohol does not come through in the taste - it is straight and to the point - pleasant and massive in its delivery mechanism: end of the year cheer. The low carbonation compliments the full and dissipating mouthfeel. I could drink this beer until i fall off my rocker."
"The beer disembarks the 750ml cork and caged green bottle a shining gold with a prodigious creamy bright white head that lingers for quite sometime, and the lace forms a thick and clinging blanket upon the glass. Nose has a tangy spiciness, over ripe fruit, seemed to be a mix of bananas and pineapples, crisp and clean, hints of clove also noticed, maybe even a bit of fusel alcohol, a complex one at any rate, start is sweet and the grain profile noticeable, the top is light to moderate in feel. Finish is caustic, hops are pleasantly spicy, vinous, devastatingly dry and the aftertaste welds itself to your palate, and the 9.5 percent ABV warmed my tummy noticeably, a great beer for a Sunday afternoon."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 2+"" eggshell head over the effervescent golden brew. Head keeps growing and growing, due to rejuvenation from all the bubbles. Finally settles down with about an inch of marshmallowy foam, with stunning lace coating the glass. The lace actually looks like real lace with alternating patterns of the foamy remnants. Aroma is lightly spicy with sweet maltiness. Taste is wow, creamy sweetness followed by shots of spicing, with a crisp, dry close. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both excellent. A great saison, even better than i was expecting."
"Bottle: Poured a hay blonde looking beer with a huge white foamy head with great retention. Aroma is dominated by the floral yeast with some good strong malt also present. Yeast is very noticeable as you start sipping this beer and malt mix with spices also become more apparent as you drink. Funky aspect is quite present thought not as much as the Veille Saison Dupont. Still very enjoyable and alcohol is not detectable."
"What magic has touched this liquid to make it so near perfect? Is this proof that the artisan's hand is more powerful than the chemist's figuring, the devotion to time and place more potent than industrial consistency?"
"A great gift from Dupont. Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
"Taste: Good acidity and lively carbonation, yeasty and bready with some undisclosed spicy cereal taste. Very satisfying."
"Somewhat loose, Claritin head with some big bubbles on edges that stick and jab with each other. Hazy, yellow hue that looses you in its swirling. Kind of balky hop presence on nose with a candied lemon skin gargle. Very pleasant sweet spring grass on mouth with just the smallest hint of tart yeast that just echoes, and reminds me of childhood summer days and promises of future adventures. Husky wheat permeates the mouthfeel, but not overtly. Balanced; very good."
"This was on tap to day at Red Bones. The color was hazy gold with a thin white head. Aroma has candy notes along with a combination of citrus and pear. A white sheet of lace was prevalent down the side of the glass. The taste has a nice tartness. More of the pear and citrus. A lot more candy sweetness. This to me was a cross between a Saison, and a Belgian Trippel. It had good characters of both. A mild alcohol warming and hop bite. Slick mouth feel. Very drinkable."
"All in all it was quite terrific, but the 20 oz may have been a tad too much as I couldn't bring myself to finish it. It went well with the rosemary chocolate we had as well."
"A world-class brew."
"Sampled from a 750, though the lable was different than the one pictured above. A hazy golden amber colored brew topped by a dollop of magnificent pure white head that laces beautifully. Intriguing aromas of fresh cut grass, musty hay and barnyard, lemon/lime, spicy yeast and a touch of fruity hops. Superb and complex flavors of contrasting sweet and sour. Lots of green grass, lemon, a variety of spice including coriander, pepper, ginger, orange peel, and clove. Fruitry notes of tart apple, pear, and faint banana pull me in further. Deep and complex. Refreshing and satisfying. I wish I had a bottle to myself. Thanks to Bruno for sharing this rare treat!"
"In the end this is just a wonderful mix of flavors, textures and aromas. This beer is quite good, and is perhaps my second favorite (after the Saison) from this incredible brewery."
"This holiday Belgian pours a light golden color with a nice thick, fluffy white head that holds for quite some time. Good amount of bubbles rising to the top. Smell is a bit strong on the yeast side with noticeable amount whole hop flowers in there. Taste is really complex and nicely balanced. There's a slightly sweet honey flavor in here and a nice little peppery kick. The spice is an additive and doesn't overtake the beer at all. The base is definitely the floral hops which really hold the whole beer together yet they're not overdone either. Nice little fruit yeast flavor in there and the finish gets slightly bitter and lingers. My only real fault with this beer is that I notice a salty flavor that hits towards the finish and the more I drink the more noticeable it gets. Other than that this was a really good holiday saison."
"on tap @ the waterfront ale house in NYC, as the bartender said, ""its from Dupont, it smells like flowers and its strong"" Poured into a chimay chalice, 1/2 inch puffy head, orangy amber, cloudy, nose of flower, fruits , spice and yeast. Moderate, fine lacing. This is the real Belgian deal, light delicate, flavorful and wait its also 9.5%! Notes of fresh fruits, ginger, juniper, peppery spice, bubble gum, yeasty phenolics. Yum yum-- seek and enjoy!"
"Drinkability- Couldn't believe the ABV on this when I got home. Can barely detect the alcohol in this one. Glad I tried this one. Will look for it in the bottle."
"This beer is served in a tulip and has a murky golden body and a whisp of a head of white which settles to a thin lacing on the surface. The tulip conjures up a plethora of smells to create a powerful nose. I first sense acidic fruit, still sweet but quite sharp. Orange, lemon, cherry. Next I detect damp funk. Not as acrid as a horseblanket (a misused term by many. Go visit a stable, and then make the comparison) but still just brooding with wild yeast, like decomposing vegetetation. Finally, a bit of sweet esters, the fruit surges again, then an outright bubblegum sweetness, then a spiciness, then all these things over and over. This is a wonderfully alive in its flavors. They undulate like waves, and conclude in a wonderful balance. The huge alcohol in this is hidden like buried treasure. Drinkability and Mouthfeel are superb, as they complement one another. This beer is a treat, and on-tap it's simply an experience all its own."
"This beer poured a light gold color and formed a nice bubbly white head that coated the glass with lace as it subsided. A small amount of carbonation was present. An aroma of malt, hops, coriander, spices and straw. The flavor was of malt, hops, spices with a heavy complex background hard to place under just one umbrella. Combining elements of several and definately impacting the finish, which seems heavier than the beer really is. The finish has some tartness but with this undercurrent present."
"This brew is going to be on my mind for a while, just like it's saison cousin. Avec Les Bons Voeux has a magnificant aroma and taste combined with a majestic appearance. Another great beer from Brasserie Dupont."
"And Yes, we did leave the Waiter a big tip that night."
"($7.99 / 25.4 oz / 750ml corked and caged champagne style bottle)"
"Sweet enough that the fruit flies like it too. A fruity, stone-flavored ale."
"Poured a light gold with heavy carbonation and a huge, whipped egg-white head. Took some time to enjoy watching the head slowly rise higher and higher as the bubbles danced furiously underneath. Garden nose jazzed up with some spices and just a hint of hops. Not sour as I expected, instead a mellow, rich yeasty flavour especially present in the finish. Mouthfeel was moderately smooth with some definite warming. Very satisfying and relaxing. Would pair well with a light reading and log fire."
"Matta is such a stellar individual Clear liquid gold wearing a foamy, frothy, rocky gigantic-sized white head. Very carbonated body. Gotta love such a complex aroma that never hinted at being not as great as expected by me (who still recently fell under the charm of their Dupont Forêt). Ultra farmy, dry and yeasty, very yeasty obviously like all other Dupont. Lovely barny and spicy hints. How can you not love a fine Saison. Bone-dry (made me think of chalk at times) with awesome white wine aspects. Deep spice profile includes coriander, basil, pepper, thyme, mint, sage and just various other herbs. The first sip proposes a malty attack with lots of dry hay, some apple and so much yeast. Finish is dry with a grassy hop bitterness, but remains restrained and balanced. Aftertaste comes back to haunt me with suggestions of dust and spices and that scores big points with me. So herbal, so intense and no alcohol to speak of although there's a charming warming effect. Body is medium, quite carbonated, mouth-cleaning for sure and lightly tart at times. Marvellous Marvel. I'm truly impressed and in great thirst of Saison for the rest of my days. Help me!"
"Yes, a replacement for champagne. Even non-beer drinkers will like. Like a good French white wine, nicely carbonated, with lemon and zest and vanilla. Good combination of hops, spices. Nice white head that stays. Crisp aftertaste.Great and unique saison."
"Better than any champagne I have ever had."
"75cl Corked 2003 vintagePoured a cloudy golden orange color with a creamy white head. Aroma slightly sour and fruity. Some lemon, skunk and barnyard funk also present. Really wonderfully complex. Body is medium with a velvety smoothness and a lively carbonation. Flavor is spicy like a Tripel with some nice citrus in there as well. Good retention leaving scattered lacing in my Trappist glass. Overall one of the best in this style that I've had."
"Pours a murky blonde color with darker colored yeast in suspesion. Huge fluffy white head. Pour carefully, folks! Spicy, yeasty nose, pepper, citrus peel, alcohol is noticable. Citrus notes and a fair dosage of lower alpha hops in there, as well. Nice and dry like you'd expect from a saison but very strong. But, hey, it's their winter seasonal. It gets cold in Belgium, too. Excellent mouthfeel, bubbly, dry and alcoholic. Do I hear a substitute for New Years Eve champagne? Can I get an Amen? Hell yeah."
"A nice find at the deli I must say,poursa lighter shade of gold with a huge blossoming head that has moved down an inch as of yet,the aroma is lightly smokey with almost a cinnamon spicey quality.Taste is smnokey with some real medicinal hints with a malty finish and after taste wich came out well,this beer has some serious complexity to it.A real nice change of pace here nice to have before bed."
"Bottle tasted at Bruges Beertje. Appearence: Golden yellow, big head, slight cloudiness. Aroma: Very spicy, with a rich hopiness. Flavor: Earthy hop flavors. Spices from yeast & specialty ingredients. Malt backbone balances. Finish: Mostly lingering hops."
"Comments  TheLongBeachBum wrote a winner of a review on this one and rated it two tenths higher than me. He said it a lot more eloquently than I did. His is a, must read, if youre thinking about trying this ale."
"Pours a golden sunrise color with a tall foamy white head that dissipates into a soapy lace. Nose is fruity esters and lots of spiceclove, coriander, and fresh pepper. Moderate in body with a bold carbonation that dances on the tongue. Taste begins with some tropical fruit and raw honey followed by a strong musty yeastiness. This is followed by an attack on the palate by lots of medical phenols, some spicy coriander, and a bite of white pepper. This is a supercharged Saison and another fine beer from an outstanding brewery."
"please take note, that this is a limited edition seasonal beer, released in the winter, by the Dupont brewery. The sample just reviewd was from the 2001 batch! If you find this stuff, it should be around $10 a bottle..."
"The alcohol (9.5% ABV) is well hidden, and the drinkability is good."
"The only other Dupont product I'd tried before this was it cider, which I enjoyed immensely, so I had high expectations of this beer and was not disappointed. It glows a nice yellow with a touch of orange and has a big, white pillowy head that leaves lace all the way down the glass. The smell and taste are discinctly Belglian. Those ""barnyard"" smells are present along with a hint of medicinal smell. The taste has a nice tartness bring a slight pucker to the mouth. It has a nice, creamy mouthfeel. As others have noted, the abv is well-hidden, so don't let it sneak up on you."
"On a note - There is an element to the hops in the nose that vaguely reminds me of a new can of tennis balls????????"
"Pours a bright and cloudy yellow in color, nice creamy frothy white lasting head. Flowery, grassy spicy and fruity aromas, fruity, yeasty spicy and slightly sour wheat flavors. Medium boby, smooth and silky mouthfeel with some bitterness, finishes, crisp and dry with alcohol in the aftertaste, great for the style."
"Drinkability & Notes: More interesting than anything else, certainly a specialty beer that I’d have after a meal or if the meal was bold enough to pair it with that."
"Another one of those refreshing delights amid the common heaviness of winter seasonals (don't get me wrong, I love the big beers too). This beer pours out a hazy golden yellow with a nice thick, pillowy white head that lasts forever leaving a serious coat of lace down the glass. The aroma smells of a bready yeast and fragrant lemony citrus. The taste is slightly sweet but dries up in the finish where you'll find a trace of hop bitterness. There is a tartness present which melds well with some of the light fruitiness found in the flavor. There is ample carbonation that lends to a full and smooth mouthfeel. The more I taste the more I realize that there is more going on here. For being what I thought was a lighter beer, there is alot going on here - citrus, light malt, fruity esters, and spice. Forgive my oxymoron, but I think this beer is both light and rich. The alcohol is hidden but present and slowly warms the belly. Great stuff, go out and get some."
"Slightly hazy light golden hue. Lively bubbling supports a thick, fluffy, stiff, sea foam like white head. Yeast must and lightly tart white grapes hit the nose at first, then notes of damp bready malt and clove surface. Hint of dry herbs and black pepper like alcohol. Note of green apple adds additional tartness in aroma. Fairly dry and tart overall aromawise. Contrary to the aroma, the flavor profile abounds in a pleasant, light, sweetness. The initial honey like sweetness morphs into a fruity melange of grape and pear, then is immediately contrasted by green apple, medicinal phenols and notes of black licorice. Hint of heaty, solvent like fusels. Lightly bodied. Agreeably crisp mouthfeel. Finishes herbally sweet, with pronounced clove and an impression of dried oregano. An intense, flavorful beer. Strong on the medicinal phenols and higher alcohols. Perhaps further cellaring to tame this brew would elevate it to excellence. Bottled 2002."
"I'm obviously a big fan of all the Dupont brews. This winter seasonal is in the same vein as their saison and the Moinette blonde. A cloudy golden color with a huge rocky white head and good lace pattern down the glass. The same peppery-fruity nose and palate but with a stronger yeasty flavor in the back and then the traditional hoppy finish. Also the highest carbonation of all the Dupont beers I've tried. If this had been in town in December, a merry Christmas I would have had, indeed."
