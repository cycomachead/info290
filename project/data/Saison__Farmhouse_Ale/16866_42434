4.75,15.6,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,"Has an earthy, fruit nose with a hint of fresh laundry and faint barnyard. It pours dull amber to brownish peach under a very pillowy, very uniformly and finely bubbled, 2” off-white head. Light fruit over malt dominate the yeast driven palate. Light malt provides the backbone with light fruits – peach, apricot, light tropical – not quite pineapple, maybe guava. Medium body and average to a little above on the carbonation.","pat61","Mar 18, 2015"

4,-2.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall I thought this was a good beer and good example of the style, it's still identifiable as a Saison and the brett and rye seem to be in the background, that's not bad, but I found myself wishing that the rye and brett were more noticeable and the belgian yeast showed up in the background.  This beer had ok drinkability, it was smooth, very crisp, pretty prickly, very dry on the finish, not too filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, but I think one glass is enough for me any more than that and the prickly carbonation might start to wear on me.  What I like the most about this beer was nothing, there isn't any aspect that stood out as being better than the others.  What I liked the least about this beer was that brett and rye didn't show up more, they were a little light for my liking.  I would buy this beer again, but it isn't anything I'm going to stock up on and I would recommend it to anyone who likes saisons with just a little brett to them, the brett doesn't really take out of the realm of the style.  All in all I was happy with this beer and I thought it was a nice Saison, but with that being said, I wasn't overly impressed with it and I don't think it's very memorable.  This beer made for a nice first impression for the Bruery and I'm interested in trying more of their beers and I would say it's above the middle as far as Saisons go.  Good job guys, this was a nice Saison, keep up the solid work.","StoutHunter","Nov 29, 2014"

3.9,-5.1,,,,,,"O: With a combination of muddled and standard flavors, this beer let me down in a stunning fashion. While a good example of a traditional saison, I was expecting a little more from the Bruery; maybe some sour characters, lower ABV for clearer flavors, or a little wider array of flavors. I'm all for subtlety, but 'funk' is a flavor that can wear on me pretty quickly.","1000lbgrizzly","Sep 06, 2014"

I taste apricots at first before a glimpse of sweet lemon moves in. The middle palate is yeasty with some malt before it ends with banana and raisin bread. Very good example of the style with a more narrow complexity.","KYGunner","Sep 02, 2014"

4.15,1,,,,,,"Described as a Belgian style ale brewed with Rye and Brettanomyces, this beer pours brightly golden with a copper hue.  It is highly effervescent with a sturdy white head that persists as a thick layer of merengue-like foam throughout.  Delicate Belgian lacing rides down the side of the glass.  The aroma is musty with hints of banana, clove and spice. Malt is present and phenolic notes linger in the background. The flavor is big and fruity, and quickly fades into a crisp, dry finish that leaves a dank bitterness on the back of the tongue. Mouthfeel is dry and slightly astringent. Overall, this beer is a solid representation of style that has a crisp character and sweetness that is balanced by barnyard funk.","MrBoz21","Aug 19, 2014"

In fact when I popped the cap foam started to rise out of the bottle shortly thereafter and it had not been disturbed prior to that. Good clarity. Thin layer of tightly knit,minuscule white foam on top. The aroma is very inviting and unique. The tartness of Brett blends very well with the spiciness of rye. The flavor dimples carries the aroma forward. The Brett dominates but leaves room for the playful spiciness of the rye. Mouth is pretty carbonated,true to style and with all of those clues prior to tasting it was no surprise.","Franziskaner","Jan 18, 2014"
4.74,15.3,4.5,4.75,5,4.25,4.5,"The beer pours a fairly lively and cream white head that dissipates slowly. The beer itself is a fascinating color. Instead of the traditional pale gold or straw, the beer is a cloudy and obscure dark orange with hints of brown. The beer smell is divine and unique. The brettanomyces and rye mix very well together along with the earthy hop notes. The bretta provides a nice sweet fruity smell to offset the earthiness and the rye. The beer taste is similar to the smell with stronger and earthy hop notes that mixes well with the rye. The bretta takes off some of the edge and provides a nice nectarlike taste to the brew. The beer feel is smooth and refreshing with biting carbonation but feels a little thick for a saison. Overall, a superb brew that I will get again.","HattedClassic","Jan 18, 2014"

The mouthfeel is damn near perfect. Super dry and a perfect body - not too heavy and not too light. Its nearly 9% and you can tell it has a kick, but its not overdone.

4.12,0.2,4,4.5,4,4,4,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 3/27/2013. Pours moderately hazy golden orange color with a 2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big pear, peach, pineapple, grape, apple, pepper, clove, hay, grass, herbal, candi sugar, rye, bread, light funk, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, Brett, and malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big pear, peach, grape, apple, pepper, clove, herbal, candi sugar, bread, rye, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, pepper, clove, candi sugar, bread, rye, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast flavors with moderate male balance; with a good sweetness/spiciness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately slick, smooth, and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent saison style. All around great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 18, 2013"

This Saison is opposite: rye and spice are showcased in this beer without much fruit to speak of. Additionally, the body of the beer is lighter than I'd like. But my biggest qualm with the beer is the alcohol-forward aftertaste. Instead of being hidden, you taste every bit of the beer's 8.5% ABV.

If anything, it's a hybrid that works in some ways (fruitiness, sourish finish), but is chaotic in terms of getting the balance I love in this style. Too boozy at times, too sweet, and sometimes muted in displaying the hoppy characteristics or sour Brett yumminess. Sometimes, it's all of this. This is best consumed cold, but I would definitely not turn this down if offered again. However, for $13-14 on the market, it's going to be a tough call.","magictacosinus","Apr 12, 2013"

4.04,-1.7,3.75,4,4,4,4.25,"this was good, I just wasn't blown away by it. the pour is more clear than cloudy, with a bright yellow color and a nice white head a few inches tall. the nose isn't as farmy as I thought it would be, its more fresh than that, more spring than late summer, more floral than pollen, more straw than hay. its got a grassy light malt aroma and very little spice, almost like green tea. the flavor is very similar with a straw-like complexion, some subtle citrus notes, and a curious yeast that is not what im used to in a saison. its dry and light, floral, not funky and pungent, makes for a very light and peppy beer. there is also a lot of alcohol in this, especially in the finish, where the higher abv is obvious. its not a knock against it, because it actually works well here, but its again not what they style has come to be in most cases. fine carbonation and a body that's almost too light for its own good. a fun beer, probably overpriced, but one that pushes the mundane American saison in a spirited new direction.","StonedTrippin","Mar 06, 2013"
4.04,-1.7,4.25,4,4,4.25,4,"The beer pours with a very aggressive head made of creamy white bubbles, and it sits well above a two fingers’ width. The beer is a beautiful rustic golden color with an uncontrollable torrent of bubbles racing up to refill the head. The body is cloudy, but relatively clear (I was gentle with the bottle, in order to not stir up the yeast on the bottom of the glass…). The beer’s lacing is thick, leaving a patchwork of webbing across the glass. On the nose, this beer is properly rustic with beautiful saison bread and citrus orange that almost touches upon orange peel and also hints at lemon. The esters are richly complex in the nose, giving off hints of apricot and pineapple, especially as the beer warms up. The brett funk is definitely there as well, but not overpowering in the nose, instead acting more as an underlying emanation beneath all the other smells. In character, the funk tends more towards a salty funk with touches of barnyard. The beer’s smell also features a nice presence of grassy hops in the back of the malts. On the tongue, the beer tastes quite sweet with a rounding acidity and a nice bitter finish. The beer begins with light citrus that opens into bruising bitters that are grassy and zested with lemon bread and a big dose of pineapple. Beneath all of this runs the salty funk that mingles into barnyard territory, but does not get out of hand (which makes me think I should have aged this beer a little longer for my personal tastes). The finish is bitter hops and sticky sweet funked malts that briefly touch upon a cloying note before mellowing into hay and light lingering funk. The booze in the beer (8.5%!) also touches slightly in the back of the throat. On the tongue, the beer is creamy and the head is pure fluff. Carbonation kisses the tongue with a little bit of pressure, but just enough to prep the palate for taste while not abusing it. The mouth is left slightly dry but sticky. Overall, this is a solid saison with a fair amount of grassy bitters and yeasty esters. I sort of wish I aged it a little longer, but only because I personally love the dry and funky saisons. Un-aged, this thing is sweet and complex with some really great flavors. It is a little heavy on the stomach, which makes it more of an imperial saison in my book, but it certainly is tasty and worth a try.","Maxwell","Mar 05, 2013"

You get the refreshing, faint tart fruit notes but the spices do not come to the foreground. Moreover, I get no clove (which I understand is a bad thing in this style). If I could change anything about this, I would (somehow) dial down the sweetness on the back of the palate just a bit and introduce just a bit more of that peppery note instead.

There's a lot going on, but the beer is not muddy, and is not overly intense in any of its attributes (ie sour, spicy, funky). I think the rye is adding a lot and giving the beer a very down-to-earth feel, perhaps because the mild spice and mouthfeel.

Hints of wild yeast, pineapple, and a hint of biscuit. Not much to report, not bad just not powerful. The flavor is way more intense and is immediately appealing on the tongue. Starts with a tart fruity character (pineapple and apples and citrus) that blends well with the brett and yeast to create a unique and flavorful beer. Mildly bitter. Not hint of the alcohol at all, very appealing. Well carbonated the beer finishes dry with a lingering fruity funk. Medium bodied.

The beer poured a pale golden color and formed a large, creamy looking head. The look was very similar to Duvel, but the strong musty Brett aroma let me know that I was sampling something else altogether. The smell had floral, tart, vinous character, perfect for a farmhouse ale. The taste was dusty dry, with Brett funk in the beginning of the sip. This was followed by a pear like flavor, and finished off with a peppery spiciness. There wasn't much of a rye influence, as the Brett pretty much drove everything else into submission. The aftertaste was herbal with touch of juniper. Very light in the mouth, and easy to drink. The alcohol content was well hidden under these layers, and crept up on you with some warmth. Very good interpretation of the style.","rajendra82","Jan 28, 2012"

A very nice nose- not too strong, not too weak. The taste is toast, yeast, spices, brett, and light fruit, maybe apricot. A definite step up from the nose (which was pretty darn good). The brett flavors are just about perfect- they're out front, but still balanced in with the other players. Feel is tart, bready, malty and funky, with a nice brett aftertaste. Overall, this is a really good Saison, and one of the best beers I've had from this brewery. Cheers.","jayhawk73","Jan 26, 2012"

Bright citrus first - lemon and orange mostly, followed by sharp pine, black pepper, and rustic rye malt. Bread crust and cereals come out as it warms up. The subtle undercurrent of Brettanomyces - like new leather, lemon peel, and wild herbs - gives just enough depth. The bright hoppiness and mild Brett indicates this is a young sample.

The smell is very subtle. The Brett doesn't present itself blatantly. Citrus, a little funk, but also a lot of spice character. I guess this makes it a pretty average saison, tast wise, initially.

The look and texture of the beverage are also great characters. If I had brewed this beer I don't know if I would have thought it to be anything special considering the flavors. Which lends me to wonder if this is what the brewers were attempting to create, or if this is what they created with the ingredients they used. Either way, it's interesting, and interesting goes along way in my book. Especially when it looks and feels the way it does. I can't help but wonder if the flavor character would have developed better if I had let it cellar for another year.","cdkrenz","Dec 13, 2011"

4.65,13.1,4,4,5,4.5,5,"Another great opportunity to try another great one from The Bruery. This beer pours a dark orange, with a large off white head. Smells great.. That typical barnyard funk due to the Brett. Some grapes, citrus, and spice from the Belgian yeast. Tastes slightly tart of sour apples, grapes, alcohol, yeast spice, some of that barnyard Brett funk, and lemons. All balances very well. After taste is a little tart and drying with mostly the yeast funk lingering. This beer laced very well through out the duration of drinking. Over all VERY good beer, try it!","JustinMatthew","Nov 10, 2011"

The saison flavoring, body, and smell are very well balanced between the belgian yeast flavor and the smell of fresh hay/grass. The Bretts are such an interesting addition--they aren't as powerful as they are in a true sour, but add just a hint of tartness that really makes this an exceptional beer.

This is a very light, crisp beer. Even with the glass tilted to the side and poured slowly, the head on this is monstrous and takes a while to dissipate. A mildly bretted beer, it's got just the slightest tinge of sourness to it. Glad I got a chance to try this. Enjoyable, but likely not one I'd come back to.","Retail1LO","Jul 26, 2011"

3.98,-3.2,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Overall, an interesting twist on a summer ale. The brett mixes well with the typical slightly warm and spicy saison flavors. In a way the brett dominates some of the corriander and clove flavors but it adds it's own totally unique flavors. It's not too sour, not too sweet but it's also not for everyone. This has that very distinct dry, slightly sour brett flavor you find in some sour ales.","adman08","Jun 23, 2011"
3.91,-4.9,5,4,3.5,4.5,4,"O: It is certainly unique. To me, there were some flavor characteristics that were missing, and the sweetness of the malts were a little too heavy for my liking.

Nose is dry, some citrus, bread, lemongrass in the distance, spice (pepper?). Taste has lemon, light citrus, some alcohol and a bit of ginger perhaps. Some fruit skins and hints to sweetness but never really becomes so. High carbonation but light body.

4.58,11.4,5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Overall: A beautiful, unique red saison. Food-wise, I would recommend pairing with a lighter, acidic food. This would be a good gateway beer for someone just becomming acclimated to the funkier style. Give this one a try!","mdvatab","Apr 20, 2011"
4.33,5.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall: Excellent tasty twist on the saison. A little sweeter thoughout and doesn't finish as dry as I might like, but damn good. Paired well with sitting on the deck at dusk in 70 degree weather.","rapidsequence","Apr 18, 2011"
3.73,-9.2,3.5,3,4,4,4,"Overall - Saisons are beers that have very few rules to adhere to so this is a perfect example of the creativity of the style. Enough bite to get you thinking but also smooth enough to just site and relax with. For fans of Cabs and Merlots.","allanplaysguitar","Apr 14, 2011"
4.1,-0.2,4,4,4.5,4,3.5,"O: The beer is relatively easy to drink because the alcohol is well hidden, although the spicy flavors make it more of a beer that needs to be sipped.","metter98","Apr 11, 2011"
4.13,0.5,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Since I've had several Saisons this evening I figured I may as well crack open a bottle of Saison Rue, which I've been sitting on for about four months. 750 mL bottle into a tulip glass. Pours a light golden to copper hue, with minimal head. Aroma is subdued, especially for a Saison. Nose is mostly sweet, with some notes of banana and bubblegum. There's some light spiciness in the background as well. Mouthfeel is effervescent and champagne like, with a semi-sweet aftertaste. Surprising amount of spice. The light banana aroma translates into the taste, along with a leather-like taste of recognizable Brett and a drawn out spicy finish. There's some alcohol in the finish and some alcohol warming as you drink it, as this beer certainly packs a punch. My only complaints about this beer would be the subdued aroma, but otherwise it's just about as good as you can get.","eclaycamp","Apr 08, 2011"

4.17,1.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"The taste has loads of toasted mlats adding notes of bread, biscuits, and caramel. With the brett. yeast adding tart fruity flavors of green apples and currants.

3.8,-7.5,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Had this Bruery beer recently alongside the Mischief - overall, this won out for me against the two, but both were a little strange. This in particular is like an off-kilter saison. Pours a nice light orange with lots of head. With all the carbonation it kind of reeks, mostly citrus smells with a bit of green fruit. Quite an odd taste. Very bitter. I think some of the strangeness of the taste comes in part from the apple and in part from the Brett. To me, the latter is overpowering to a point where the whole mission gets lost. I think the green fruits are a great complement, but something gets lost in the sourness and bitterness of it all. Maybe I'm being too critical, but for me, this had a touch of a spoiled taste to it, but not spoiled enough for me not to recommend it. Will have to try it again in the future.","petacutlasaurus","Mar 29, 2011"

Aroma of dark fruits, wild yeast, spice and caramel malt. Very complex flavor profile. Yeast off the bat, bready. Tart green aplple. A lot of cracked pepper and spiciness in the body. Dark fruits and caramel malt begin to round out the flavor profile. Spices and tartness linger into the aftertaste. No heat. Very nice. Bubbly, crisp mouthfeel, but a tad sticky at the same time. Complexity keeps me going back for more.","uustal","Mar 15, 2011"

One bottle is more than enough.","Sam21","Mar 14, 2011"
4.27,3.9,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"While I really liked this, nothing about it really screamed out ""saison"" to me. Of course, since saison is such an eclectic style, I won't hold that against this beer.

4.17,1.5,4,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"D-This is a great example of an alcohol forward Saison, the heat really adds to the beer. I also was really pleased with the rye character, however the carb really harms the flavor, and I would like to either see a little more funk, or a reduction in those darker fruit flavors. The beer was a bit unexpected, but a (mostly) welcome departure from the style. In a sea of ""extreme"" beers and breweries doing something different just because its different The Bruery is a refreshing example of how styles can be pushed with some really positive and interesting results.","larsenju","Feb 21, 2011"

You can taste the rye in the finish, along with some bitter hops. There is some very very very little tartness throughout each sip, but very little. The same goes for the Brett flavors. You can kinda taste the alcohol toward the end of each taste as well. This is a tasty beer! I'm kinda biased though, because I love saisons. Mouthfeel is full bodied with nice carbonation. Drinkability is high.","DovaliHops","Feb 19, 2011"

Overall, though, I think a bottle of Saison Dupont or Hennepin is a better investment if you want a more classic style.

Felt like drinking a nice champagne, its flavor and carbonation lent itself to a nice casual sip. Smelled like apricots and tropical fruits to us, and citrus in the taste was apparent. It has a sour character, i assume because of the Brettanomyces, but its not overpowering. Actually adds an element that would otherwise be missed on the back end. I can imagine drinking this on a summer's day and feeling refreshed. I am usually not a fan of drinking beer on its own, without food, but i would make an exception for this brew. Love The Bruery.

It is also super prickly, almost like eating a hot pepper then dousing your tongue with something super carbonated, it is that bad. The flavor isn't as good as I would have expected. It has that lemon cleaning solution character to it. The rye comes through pretty heavily in the flavor with some spicy bread notes. It is super sweet as well.

A bit sweet on the palate, with additions of green/spicy hops, mild bitterness, oranges, and an earthy spiciness. The body is light and dry, very effervescent, with a hint of dextrins. I didn't really pick up a lot of rye, and the brett only makes itself known as a lightly earthy funk, but it tastes very authentic and ranks up there with the best of the Belgian saisons.","mmmbeer","Jan 23, 2011"

The beer was beautiful poured into a tulip glass with a translucent lemonade-like pale yellow color that was vigorously effervescent forming a billowing white cap. The smell was earthy and musty from brett with hints of lemon and tangerines. The beer was very thick, despite the ample carbonation, and the flavor was chalky and peppery with a tart meyer lemon and biscuity malt. The beer was far too chewy and thick and high in alcohol. A saison was designed as thirst-quenching for farmers coming home from the fields and at 8.5% this chewy beer would fill you up before dinner.

Loaded with carbonation. So far a winner but wait!!! Something wicked this way comes. Flavor is initally crisp but there hides a monster - something evil - is it Thyme or Rosemary or something.

Some earthy, wet-rock minerality going on as well. very nice. taste is a well balanced mix of all of the above, and it's really cool how the brett and the rye seem to play off of each other. a very complex beer for something so refreshing. Soft, medium body with a slight prickliness from carbonation, slight bitterness from the hops, a little bit of boozy warmth and a long lasting finish full of spice and rye. traditional and unique at the same time. this is what i think of when i think super-saison. well done. great beers. big fan.","timtim","Jul 04, 2010"

Has a definite hoppy bitterness and the cones also contribute some floral flavors. Brett is not overly powerful in this young sample, but could develop a bit more for my tastes. Yeast seems to take a backseat to all the other stuff going on in here, which I am not a big fan of in a saison. ABV seems like it could be toned down a bit as well.

It has a delicate, fluffy, tightly packed foam head that rises eagerly as the beer is poured. It sticks around forever and leaves sloppy lace in its wake. The aroma is very fresh with lactic tartness, pear, sour apple, lemon, sweet malt, coriander, and white pepper. The flavor seems not quite as multi-dimensional as the aroma but is still quite nice. The musky brett flavor is there right up front as well as some bite from the rye and a firm bitterness. Flavors of grassy hops, lemon rind, green apple and pear are also present, as well as pale malt sweetness and a bit of alcoholic warmth. This beer is surprisingly smooth and on the lighter side of medium with a very dry finish that leaves me hankering for another sip.

Lots of changes, leading to a finish of more rye, Belgian malts, and a kiss of hops. A bit ascerbic on the end with a lingering Brett note. Body is creamy and smooth despite the complex flavor profile. Medium-consistency and well carbonated. Quite the tasty Saison, this beer definitely bends the rules of the style a bit, but ultimately succeeds.","wagenvolks","May 23, 2010"

Aroma has citrus spices and funy barnyard tones going on, I like me some brett infused saisons. Very aromatic comparable to the Drew Estate line of infused cigars. A nice melange of fruitiness going on with spicy bitter herbal hop edges, with spiced up tea/tobacco leaf complexity. Barnyard brett infused funk going on as well with a nice tropical fruit finish pineapple/mango. Mouthfeel is nice and dry at times/slightly bitter with spices and brett residuals on the palate but manages to finish slightly alcoholic and with a clean sweetness. Medium bodied sturdy effervescent carbonation carries the beer really nicely. Drinkability is a nice complex night cap that I need to get more of to get a better feel for it, I enjoyed it and will definitely not pass on the next Bruery selection I come across.","WVbeergeek","May 20, 2010"

3.68,-10.5,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The palate opens a little too sweet for my liking, with some floral honey and spicy rye immediately apparent. The citrus hop character works well with the honey too. These big flavors result in an obfuscation of the yeast character, it being reduced to a generic Belgian yeast flavor rather than the delicate bouquet that better saisons have. Hop bitterness is moderate, again, a little bit lost behind the sweetness. A touch sweet on the finish, with a rather noticeable rye flavor. Medium in body with moderate carbonation, this beer is decent fresh. I need to grab another bottle and sit on it for a year or two. While I'm going to enjoy the rest of this bottle, I really do wish it were drier.","DefenCorps","May 10, 2010"

It poured a deep cloudy copper. It smelled like spicy rye bread, orange peel, black pepper, honey and some Brett. I tasted only a hint of rye and Brett and a bit malty, which was surprising for a Saison. It just didn't live up to its aroma.","femALEist","Mar 25, 2010"

The color is amber/red, a little turbid...ok...but the head is fantastic...a calm pour leads to 3+ finger of head that settle to a very creamy, fine bubble foam with tons of lacing on the glass. The scent is strong, huge saison notes of belgian yeast, lemon, bread, banana, and a bit o' that band-aid smell. The taste is very similar, wheaty, spicy, somewhat subdued, but there is a soapy taste at the end, accompanied by a green apple flavor. Strong effervescence in the mouthfeel from the lasting carbonation...thickness is suiting. Drinkability is a bit low for me, due to the alcohol flavor, carbonation, mainly.","bminor7","Mar 19, 2010"

This one is even more complex with intense flavors, particularly the Brett and spices. Although it is well balanced, it does learn toward sweetness a bit. It is not as sessionable (is that even a word) as Saison De Lente due mainly to the higher abv. I have a really nice Belgian Buzz going on after quaffing down this bottle. Yet another excellent American rendition of a Belgian classic from The Bruery!","BeerGodz","Mar 08, 2010"

3.91,-4.9,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours out a hazy golden yellow with a huge bubbly, champagne like head. The retention is beastly and leaves a nice coat of lacing. A nice cloud remains on top after the head finally dies down. Smell is nice. Yeast/Brett scents are up front with some sour in the background. The rye/malts are noticeable and there is even a woody/earthy element to it. The strength seems to die down after a bit and takes away half a point. Taste is solid for what the beer wants to be. The Brett and rye make for a very interesting beer. Some sourness in there and the malts too, a nice balance overall. The mouthfeel consists of a moderate body and moderate carbonation. This suits the flavor well and there is some creaminess to it, smooth. Drinkability is good for a Brett beer. Smooth with a pretty good price for 750ml. Nice taste and it doesn't overpower the palate.","cbutova","Mar 02, 2010"
3.93,-4.4,4.5,4,3.5,4,4.5,"Color is a hazed, cloudy pale gold with a retentive off white head and nice streaky lacing. Aroma is sweeter than expected, yeasty and fruity, with mild dry earthiness and funk, very little presence of brett or the rye malt. Also a slightly solvent, boozy pinch. Flavor is similarly sweet like the nose, not particularly dry or crisp, with medium full soft body with light carbonation. Nice hop balance in the finish, but I'm disappointed in the lack of earthiness spiciness and funk in this and slightly turned off by the sweetness. Not a traditional saison, but an interesting beer. I wouldn't return to this at its typical price north of $10 but might grab a few more at this price to see what happens with the brett over time.","yourefragile","Feb 28, 2010"

The aroma was good with sour and tart notes of hops like green apples, grapefruit, yeast and assorted spices. The flavors were very sharp and complex as one would expect of an aged cheddar (they would probably pair wonderfully). I tasted orange zest and grapefruit peel, alcohol, toasted malt, some resiny/piney hops, a healthy dose of pepper and hints of rye. Not really what I expect from a saison but tasty. The mouthfeel was creamy and a bit oily such that my tongue remained coated after the sampling. The body was medium and the carbonation low.","thekevlarkid","Jan 25, 2010"

Saison Rue is a good effort that performs well-all around. It needs something extra to really get it to the next level. Perhaps a stronger rye presence or more funkiness from the Brett. Either might work. But, it's good beer as it is. Definitely worth picking up a bottle.","prototypic","Jan 22, 2010"

4.27,3.9,4.5,5,4,4,4,"This is a difficult one to judge drinkability on, simply because the style is not one I frequent often. I only have sporadic interest in saisons, but usually enjoy them a lot when the urge strikes. This is one of those cases, as this is certainly a strong example. However, this is not a beer I would drink all that often, for the aforementioned reasons.

I waffled a lot on my scoring of this beer, moreso than I usually do when reviewing, with a lot of borderline 4.0/4.5 scores, but I think I feel good with what I ended up with. This is a very, very good beer, and one I was impressed by. This bottle had about 6 months of age on it since I picked it up relatively fresh, so I can't really comment on how this one's gotten Brett-ier or dryer ... but I can say I really enjoyed it. In fact, it's one of the better saison's I've had the pleasure of trying (and I have reviews of 23, this one coming in below Hennepin, Saison w/ Brett, and Southampton's Saison Deluxe), showcasing lots of variety, complex, well-integrated flavors, and not even a hint of alcohol. At 8.5%, it's average or even a little high for the style, but I'm pleased that it hardly made itself known at all.

Nice sized white head that left some good lacing. The aroma was nice, though I will admit that I was expecting more of a sour smell. Rye malt is there, some pepper like smell, earthy and somewhat funky. Not a bad smelling brew, but maybe I was just expecting a little more. The flavors where nice, this was an easy drinking brew. Nice malt flavor, the rye does not seem to be overly dominant which works for me. Nice spice to it with a slight pepper taste. Some sour properties, I guess I was looking for more, that where nice. Now for me this brew was not overly sour but I was sharing this brew and others felt that the sour really stood out.

3.92,-4.6,4,4.5,3.5,4,4,"Popping the cap, I got an audible indication of carbonation but thankfully none of the gushing that I heard plagued earlier batches. The beer is dark copper color, a little murky and hazy, with a thick white head. The smell is very good, the first thing I note is spicy rye, after that a Belgian Pale character that's yeasty and inviting. The brett funk is there but not in a defining way, just enough to give a support to the beer. This beer, while tasty, doesn't really live up to its own aroma. There's just enough rye (an ingredient better suited to IPAs when added with a strong hand) for a Belgian-style beer, it was expertly added. The brett sourness is there but not too strong either, but the after-taste seems too bitter and astringent, like chewable aspirin or something similar. The body quality is good, peppery carbonation and satisfying mouthfeel. I think that I'll remember this beer as a good experiment but not necessarily something I'd recommend or come back to.","TurdFurgison","Dec 20, 2009"

Brewed with the odd elements of rye and brettanomyces, this beer is so well balanced, it takes the saison style into a richer, more complex direction. I am amazed at the rye bread/milk chocolate sensation I am getting from this. It definitely shows the difference between a white bread (ordinary saisons, if you will) and a rye bread presentation. Well done.","Beerenauslese","Nov 30, 2009"
4.32,5.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"The beer is poured with a golden colour and a huge white fluffy head. The bubbles are of a decent size and the carbonation is very apparent. There is a bit of sweetness and fruitiness in the nose. A spiciness is there as well. There is citrus and pear notes coming through. The nose isn't very strong, but very solid. The beer has a lot of flavours. A slight pilsner type flavour mixed with a sweetness with hints of pear and a slight bit of citrus. The sweetness in the beer isn't what I'd expect because the beer is so dry. The carbonation is quite strong as well adding a little of acidity to the beer. I really enjoy this flavour and it's incredibly drinkable. A slight tartness lingers on your tongue, which I like. This is an incredibly tasty brew.","swizzlenuts","Nov 26, 2009"

4.08,-0.7,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"My first impression of the taste is take three steps back from all the pepper. This is a very spicy beer, and black pepper dominates the spice profile. Fruit yeast flavors, typical of a saison follow. The Brett doesn't stand out much but this is a young bottle. I would bet this would improve over a year or two. Still, this is a perfectly enjoyable beer as it is. The body is highly viscous and the combination of assertive piney hops and tingling, almost champagne like carbonation makes for a lively and pleasurable mouthfeel. Grape fruit flavors are pronounced but bready malts come through too. Though not blown away, I would count this as a solid beer to return for more tastings in the future.","DaPeculierDane","Nov 23, 2009"

A bit unusual, but there is a a fair bit going on here. Pours golden with just a bit of haze and a quite nice, tightly beaded white head that sticks around as a cap. Smells fruity and somewhat tropical, but with notes of white pepper and almonds as well as a whiff of grain and herbs. Tastes soft and a bit creamy up front, with a nice tropical fruitiness, particularly pineapple and passion fruit, and then there is quite a nice little hit of pepper, or more probably grains of paradise, followed by some more tropical fruit and a lightly lemony finish. This is fairly complex, and quite tasty, but not quite as deep and pungent as say, a Fantome. Still, very enjoyable. A little lighter and softer than I'd like in the mouth, it could use a touch more crispness. Very interesting beer and although it doesn't hit every mark, it certainly is a nice achievement.","Georgiabeer","Nov 17, 2009"
4.2,2.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"D - The yeast character is nice, but not as bright and tropical as that of some other saisons that I have had. The hop character seems to be where this beer really shines at this level of maturity. There is a nice level of refreshing bitterness and plenty of the classic, earthy, spicy hop notes. The funk is quite a bit more subdued than I would have expected; there are only hints of any wild character, and I would guess that this was a relatively young bottle. I would be quite interested to see how this beer changed over time and if I come across another bottle I will cellar it for six months or so to see how the brett develops.","nickfl","Nov 16, 2009"
4.04,-1.7,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Fluffy, quickly dissipating bubbles indicate the tingly character of the carbonation. Aroma of spice (coriander, clove), funky, earthy yeast, and citrus is heady and nice. Taste is of cidery apple, grape skins, biscuity, sour yeast, some honey and caramel sweetness, citric, herbal hop bite, and warm alcohol. Quite spicy, evidently from the rye. White pepper. Mouthfeel is a bit raw and grainy. A bit prickly on the tongue from carbonation and spice. The biscuity malt keeps it in balance for the most part, but this is rustic and musty in the tradition of saisons, albeit with more hop character and spice. An uber saison, with a higher alcohol and more earthy, funky quality than the more refined versions. Not for everyone, but quite enjoyable. Would pair well with some stinky cheese and fruit.","firkinhophead","Nov 12, 2009"

The flavor is fruity, and pretty spicy with a light tartness. There is a higher level of malt than many saisons as well, but the finish is still pretty dry. Not really hoppy, though there is some bitterness in the finish as well as some graininess. Medium bodied with lots of carbonation.

Smells of pineapples and ripe oranges with some pungent white grapes in the very back. Spice, yeast, brett, and some faint mustiness float around. Tastes of big, sour fruits and grain.

More brett in the taste, again with musty horseblanket. Overly spicy, with an onslaught of pepper/ginger. Quite fruity; a lot of citrus and some tropical fruit. Pretty sweet. Heavily hopped. Alcohol warmth and bite. It finishes sweetly but with a lot of hop bitterness; rather disjointed. Full bodied with lower carbonation.

Jeez, I'm glad I didn't let this baby sit for much longer. The brett makes this a bottle bomb in the making. This beer pours a burnt orange with a massive 6 inch tan head that actually grows over the lip of the glass. This beer leaves some serious lacing as it recedes. The aroma is a mixture of funk, spice, and lemon rind. White pepper, damp hay, brown sugar, with just a bit of barnyard funk. The flavor is awesome. The base saison is just a wee bit sweet for me but the funk really comes through. Wet grass, must, with just a bit of Belgian yeast spiciness. The rye really comes out in the flavor profile. Big pepper notes accentuated by the yeast are amazing. My biggest problem is there is quite a bit of lingering sweetness on the tail of the flavor profile. I rather like my saison's just a bit dryer.

Not super funky, not right out of the barnyard, but just a dry, slightly moldy (like an aged cheese), slightly sharp flavour. All the positive aspects of a farmhouse ale, without the terrible bite you sometimes get. The carbonation works in its favor here, with some nice snap behind it.

I'm going to sit on the other one for a while to see if it reverses course or trends downward, but I was a little disappointed after the smell.

3.75,-8.8,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,3,"Been wanting to try out this brew(ue)ry for a while, recently began distributing to Boston. Easy does it opening this beer, nearly a gusher. Big, huge, fluffy brilliant white head floats on a light golden-orange beer. Light haze. Lots going on in the nose. Delicious peppery rye spicyness, fresh and a bit tangy, grassy. Hmm, taste is well rounded and really pretty good but a letdown compared to my expectations from the nose, which was a near 5er. Bubbly tingly carbonation hits first and next is a light pale malt, a bit of funky yeast but not necessarily sour, and a light floral hop profile. The rye comes through slightly, and a bit more peppery typical saison spice. I guess what I'm not crazy about is that this beer is a little bit sweet, maybe partially because of the relatively high ABV for a saison. I was expecting a little more crispness, something a bit more dry, and maybe more of a brett presence. Not as sharp as I would like, but maybe I'm hard to please. Good tingly texture. A really decent beer overall, just not to my particular taste for the style. Anxious to try their other beers...","twelvsies","Apr 07, 2009"
4.2,2.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"This one started foaming over as soon as I opened the bottle and I did loose a bit. Pours a pale orange with three fingers of huge pillowy white head that never fully dissipated but did leave some nice lacing as it receded a bit. Taste and aroma are complex. Lots of esters, some floral hops, some phenols, spices, and a touch of perfumey, rose-like alcohol. The yeast derived ester aromas here are citrusy with some pear. The phenols are a bit peppery and in more of a complimentary role, helping the balance the aroma. The alcohol presence is very subdued and appears as occasional whiffs of rose. There do seem to be some lightly floral hop notes to the aroma as well. There is also a faint sour note that lingers throughout. Mouthfeel is goo with a light-medium body (at the lighter end of that spectrum) with high carbonation. Drinkability is quite good. I finished the entire bottle without realizing it. Flavors are complex without being overwhelming, very enjoyable.","mnj21655","Apr 05, 2009"

The first look at this deep copper/orange ale sparked my interest as the aroma was also inviting.

Slowly calms down to a frothy coating and leaves gobs of sticky stickage. Spiced up nose full of coriander, coconut, tropical life savers and pepper. Highly carbonated and that's becoming a hindrance to fully enjoying this one. Notes of pepper, soft ripe fruits and a hint of funk and yeastyness. More lifesaver, some alcohol heat peaking its head in every once in a while. A decent underbelly of peppery, soapy, lemon/lime and coriander notes. A lot going on here, this one really struggled to come together for me like the better examples of the style. I'd like to try a bottle that had been aged for a year or so.","Billolick","Mar 06, 2009"

Taste followed nose, but also a little citrusy and perhaps a bit minty and grassy. Mouthfeel was light-bodied and very lively with a mild astringency.

Really earthy aroma with some funk to it, not a strong funk like you might expect in a beer with Brett (as I don't believe this has any), but more of a musty kind of way. Hay, cracked pepper, and some ginger also come into play in the aroma; I love Saisons like this. Taste almost has a rye bread taste at the beginning. I get the same musty hay in the taste, then some pepper and other spices, before a strong earthy taste sets in. Lingering earthy, dry finish, carbonation is high.

As it is though I can only strongly recommend to not hold on to these bottles, drink up the bottle bombs as soon as you can. Hopefully things will have calmed down by batch 2, cause I really do want to age a couple of these to see what the Brett can do.
