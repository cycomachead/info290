"O: Slowly Siason is coming up as one of my favorite styles next to Porter, IPA, and Wheat. Every sip is a gamble, always feel like you are tasting the wonderful yeasts that make the magic happen because godisgood. I'm not saying this is a perfect beer, but each individual thing I'm analyzing is damn near perfect to make me happy! SO GLAD I took a gamble on this. For some reason Siason is kind of hard to find."

"Pored from a corked and caged 750 ml dated March 2014 into Hill Farmstead stemware at Armsby Abbey in Worcester, MA. Pours that murky hazy pale sunset fog that makes me salivate... The aroma quickly reveals the funky characteristics I so crave. The taste delivers. Funkier, fruitier, and more delicious with each sip. Refreshing and satisfying. A must enjoyable bottle and glass to linger over. Orange and pineapple, maybe a little past ripe, dominate the finish. Velvety smooth but undefined mouthfeel. This beer makes the day better."
""
"Has elements of a sour, particularly the smell and initial sip. Very nice subtle blend of malt and oak, with a lemon aftertaste. Very refreshing although not the most complex"

"what a special beer this is, one of the best straight up brett experiences i have had in some time. sunny blonde beer with some appropriate yeast haze and a tall white airy head that rises well above the rim of the glass and clings on for ages. tart and funky is the nose, with citrus in there too. more brett than saison yeast, and just the right hop selection and dosage for this beer to be bitterly balanced but yeast not hop flavored predominantly. not often i get a beer of this depth and quality, just so alive on the palate, with the brett getting a little puckery later on. wet grass and orchard fruit notes come from the saison yeast, and the wheat malt base seems the perfect vehicle for these light summery interesting flavors to link up. one of the most dry saisons i can recall, with the brett reconditioning being fully complete. im left refreshed and intrigued and thirsty for more, i love when beer makes me this happy!"

"Pours hazy and a light golden color with a 1-2 fingers of white fluffy head, falling to a thin color.  The nose is soft and complex with lots of floral notes, lemon citrus and hints for farmy Brett.  On the palate, this beer really opened up as it warmed; it featured again lots of floral and spice notes, lemon peel, white pepper, some nice Belgian yeast flavors and more and more Brett as it warmed.  The body was smooth with a nice carbonation keeping it light and refreshing.  A really nice version of the style, complex and enticing."

"Overall: Pretty good saison. Nice funk and tartness, but would like to have seen the bitterness turned down a bit, as I feel like it doesn't really work with the rest of the beer. Still worth picking up though."

"Pale yellow with a peppy white head. I know the beer is what's important but I'd appreciate some better bottle art. Damp hay, funk and floral aroma. Tastes crisp, dry and funky with lemon, floral herbal sweetness, sourdough and more. One of those beers that changes as it warms and you can fish for new flavors and flavor combinations throughout the bottle."
"This is a stunning saison. I'm getting repetitive here, but the combination of different flavors and characteristics is fantastic. Varied, but it all works together nearly perfectly. Wow."
""
""
""
""

"Overall a pretty solid creation between the two breweries, I like this Grassroots project."

"Overall: Such a refreshing, drinkable beer - for that this is incredibly well done. Nice light hop, malt, and grassy flavors make this one a fantastic summer beer, ironic that it is ""Arctic"" in the name."

"O: Moderately complex and nicely original."
""

"Overall awesome. Not the best to look at, but aroma and flavor characters are awesome, nice Brett funk, pineapple and citrus, creamy wheat, bitterness, lemony, etc, just great."

"o - Overall a fantastic beer with brett; I loved it. Tons of brett and tropical fruits, well worth seeking out. Would love to have it again."
""
""
""
""
"I'm basically forcing myself to start liking sours, this was one really nice, and I'm really getting into them."

""

"O - Well balanced saison. Quite complex, and quite drinkable. I was not expecting to like this one as much as I really did, but it sure did surpass my expectations. Worth seeking IMO."
""
"Can Anchorage and Hill Farmstead brew this again?? Maybe make it year round? This lays down terrifically well, and is totally worth the $18 price tag I paid for. This is a prime example of how farmhouse beers in America are only getting better, and when everything is done properly towards a beer's profile, the addition of Brett only makes everything more complex, rustic, and unique. I really wish I had another bottle to see how it's progressing, but I honestly think the sweet spot is 6-8 months. Terrific, wonderful stuff. Really exceeded my expectations in many ways."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"I had high hopes for this beer. And the beer exceeded my expectations. This is remarkably flavorful, with a ridiculous amount of Brett , and an above-average amount of funk. I need to buy more of this."
"A damn fine saison. The yeast runs a bit heavy on the Belgian influence, but everything else is spot on."
"O: Drinks very well, great Brett forward flavor, sweet fruit, herbal hop, spice and earthy must. Can definitely tell this was made at Anchorage. Very very good."
"Cloudy golden body with a huge, white head. Aroma of brett , lacquer, musty basement, citrus, cracker, lemon, apricot. The flavor is moderately sweet and lightly to moderately bitter. It finishes lightly sweet and lightly to moderately bitter. Medium body, watery/velvety texture, lively carbonation. Dry finish. Crisp on the tongue. Taste of mustiness and pineapple with notes of lemon and grapefruit."
""
""
""
"Pour is hazy pale yellow with a tight white head and thick lacing. Nose has a strong lemon characteristic with some subtle pepper and balanced farmhouse yeast with some earthy qualities. Taste also leans a bit to the lemon side surrounding the palate. The farmhouse yeast of earthy mushroom and pepper comes in mid palate and plays through the back. Strong carbonation and a clean crisp body with a dry finish make this very palatable. The Brett presence really doesn't adds much but plays in with the citrus and earthy notes."

"This one is right up there with Boulevard Saison-Brett and Logsdon Seizoen Bretta for me. Wonderful use of oak and brett. The mouthfeel is fantastic and completely effervescent. You get lemons, fruit juice, and straw on the nose and in the taste. So easy to drink and completely delicious. Way too underrated."

"UPDATED 12/4/13: Opened another bottle now that it has been developing for a few months. Like I thought, this is considerably better now. I can recommend this beer now with a straight face."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I highly recommend this one. Delicious and interesting."
""
""
"This is a fantastic saison; the balance of the earthy wheat tones, the bright lemony hops, and the yeast all come together in a subtle yet complex package that is eminently drinkable (and at 6%, it really is). I will try this one again in a year or two and see if the Brett development makes it even more interesting."
""
""
""
"O - Rich and bold, but still well rounded and a pleasant easy drink. Everything is well integrated now, so I wonder how it will develop over time."
""
""
"Bright, dry, and very refreshing. A very nice Saison indeed. Extremely crisp with mineral water and tangy lemon taking the stage. I am thoroughly enjoying this beer on a brisk 28 degree November night."
"O: Even being a gusher, I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. The incident didn't take anything away from the drinking experience. Grassroots/HF (& Anchorage) can do no wrong!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Grassroots saisons have been every bit as good as their Hill Farmstead offerings and Arctic Saison continues that trend. Super drinkable and definitely worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottom Line: Excellent Hill Farmstead Family brew!"
""
""
"I found this saison to be an approachable and sessionable beer and would serve as a great introduction to saisons for the uninitiated."

"The beer is clear and golden yellow with over an inch of fluffy white head. The aroma brings funk, lemons, floral notes, mineral water, earthy tones. Similar flavor, finishing dry. A tasty beer. Mild brett and oak throughout. Not the most exciting saison, but certainly a pleasure to drink."
"Overall - I was tempted to say that this a fairly straightforward oak brett saison, but that sounds foolish."
"Overall. Great stuff. Wish I picked up a few more but happy to have tried it."
""
""
""
"O: Excellent! I did think it was a little sweet for the style though"
""
""
""
""
""

"Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a light golden amber with a two finger white head with good retention and pillowy lacing. Aroma of saison yeast, citrus, sour apple, funky. Flavor is citrus rind, brett, sour apple, coriander, peppery spices, finishing with acetic sourness and light bittering hops.. Light bodied with nice active carbonation. A lot going on here, lots of sour citrus fruit and a moderate amount of brett. A bit too sour for me, but should please tasters who like a tart bretty saison."
""
"Overall, quite nice but not remarkable."

"o: Enjoyable brew, really lets your palate know it's there, better than expected."
""
""
"O: Decent, more sour and funky than I'm used to in a saison, this leans 'wild' without being out-of-control. Half a bottle of this was pretty pleasant."
""
""
""
"O - It's a simple, clean, tart filled saison. I like it for the simplicity of it."
"O- This was a fantastic tart, bretty saison that was flavorful, clean, refreshing, with a nice tartness. In my opinion this is probably the best Shaun Hill collaboration that was brewed and bottled outside of Vermont. Congrats to Darren and Shaun for crafting yet another great saison. Definitely worth picking up a bottle especially since its distributed fairly widely."
""
""
"Light body and heavily carbonated, but very soft on the tongue. Really dries out your mouth. Pretty interesting wild saison, but the saison yeast seems a bit overwhelmed by the wild counterparts and the hopping."
""
"O: A very tart/sour/funky saison. Too much, pretty much overshadows the normal saison characteristics and not in a good way. It's not horrible but not great either. I drainpoured it - not worth teh calories."
"Overall, an excellent saison."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - like the sankt Hans, huge difference in flavor as the beer warms up. Sourness may be a little too weak after 30. Consuming no were than 50 is probably what I would suggest going forward (45-50)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The palate opens with a pleasing acidity, a blend of lemon and lactic acids, and a quenching, refreshing saison base - grain, husk, some fruit (apricot, a little peach). The mid-palate has a moderate floral character (rose hips, a little bit of jasmine). The earth/mushroom flavors from the Brett are, at this point, light, complementary and delicious. Drying on the finish with a mild oak tannin bite that works really well with the saison base, there are also flavors of lemon, a carbonic acid touch, and floral flavors. Light in body with moderate carbonation, this beer is mostly great, but does feel a touch watery at times. Still, this is an exceedingly enjoyable beer. Refined stuff."
""
""
"A solid brett saison. Nothing unexpected, but well done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hopleaf tulip - aroma was offputting - moldy fruit and cheese. Flavor profile was an improvement with notes of lemongrass, mild brett, lots of hay, cheese, grass. All 3 grassroots beers i've had have been slightly underwhelming."
""
""
"M - Medium body. Dry. Moderate carbonation."
"Overall- Solid saison, very good beer. Definitely worth a try but if you're wary of the price, you might just stick with DuPont."
""
""
""
"Worth trying for sure, and that nose is the best I've ever sniffed on a saison, But it kind of falls short when it comes to that flavour profile- it tastes pretty much like a really good smelling Saison Dupont (the one we drink in Belgium, not the imported crap)"
""
""
"O: Solid Saision. Refreshing and easy drinking. Like liquid springtime in a bottle."
""
""
""
"O: Very solid summer beer."
""
"Verdict: A very nice Saison from Grassroots/Anchorage. I really enjoy this style of beer from both breweries and it's clear that Shaun's vision came to fruition here, a really palatable saison that is both earthy and rustic, but a little wild. While it doesn't offer up much in the way of over the top complexity or risk taking, it's very refined for a simple, straightforward saison. I do wish that there was a woodiness to it, which is a great signature of both breweries."
"O: I am skeptical of all beers with the name ""Brett"" in description because they tend to be one dimensional and thin. However, like other Anchorage products, this finds a balance that makes it extremely drinkable and at the same time fairly complex."
""
""
""
""
""
"A generally approachable saison - from afar, of course, until your taste buds acclimatize, if they ever do. A lot going on here, the wood the most innocuous of the bunch, while the guest bacteria does what it does best, and the citrusy hops do well to keep things in traditional beer territory. Quite well made, this one is, and definitely worthy of seeking out, especially if you're an avowed funk-head, eh, Greg?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-good Saison, well-made, but straightforward"
""
""
""
"Overall: I think this Grassroot's beer is way under appreciated. It is very hard to find any major flaws. Another really enjoyable saison! What a jem!"
""
"The new way that folks like Anchorage, Prairie, Hill Farmstead and Grassroots have reinvented the ""American-ized"" Saison style is truly inventive as they retain what's classic about traditional farmhouse taste but injecting them with the lively character of citrusy hops. They simply flirt with perfection."
""
""
"This beer was a little sharper than I wanted it to be. Overall not a bad beer. I probably would have ranked it higher if I hadn't had Boulevard's Saison Brett the day before."
""
"OVerall, a very tasty saison, one with a good amount of balance, with the fruit and hops playing leading roles. I would like a little more funk to the smell and taste, so the subdued nature of that element is the only drawback."
""
""
"O- Really like this beer, wish i would of grabbed more bottles while i was in Vermont. Very refreshing beer. Would drink again in a second."
"Overall a rock-solid, if somewhat middle-of-the-road saison by a pair of brewing masters."
""
""
""
""
"O/D-It starts funky and wild then re-composes itself. Interesting flavor transition. I enjoyed it."
""
""
""
"O-Could have been more on the sour side. However a sweet, citrusy saison that hit the spot."
"O: Not my favorite example of the style. Leans too far towards the funk and oak without any balance to bring it back to enjoyable."
"O - Overall I enjoyed this beer quite a bit. Good Apple notes along with barnyard. Well done collaboration cc which is fast and few between."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability is pretty high, this is a solid saison. Just enough funk to be interesting, more of the tropical fruit notes which are nice. Much thanks J!"

"Poured from a bottle marked Batch #1, May/2013. Poured in a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, hazy, golden wheat coloring with a steady flow of carbonation throughout the body and a clingy, bubbly, chunky, bright white head that has a decent retention around half an inch. Nose of buttered biscuits in the backbone, with floral highlights, toasted grains, and a subtle dose of spices, including pepper, orange zest, and coriander. Flavors of sour and tart forward, with an acidic undertone. Citrus tart profile follows, with a heavier spice blend of coriander, all-spice, pepper, orange zest, and another solid shot of sour. The aftertaste is citrus and sour, with a slowly regressing boldness. The finish is tart and tangy, with a slightly drying feel and spiced linger. Decent brew, with a building spice profile as the rest of the palate quietly subsides. Interesting."
""
""
""
"Poured from tap into tulip at Humpy's in Anchorage, AK. Pours a golden color with white fluffy head. Nice hoppy malty and slightly funky aromas...a bit of lemony citrus as well. Taste is big on the cat piss/lemony hop notes, but is met with some good dose of brett funk and corn/maize malt. Very smooth and nice balance. Really great brew and glad I finally got to snag it on tap. Now to just get a bottle for the basement..."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Dangerously drinkable, thirst quenching flavors. I do feel this will shine even brighter in 6 months, will probably revisit in 12 because of my fondness for brett"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste begins with a roasted maltiness but just like the aroma the citrus grapefruit tartness kicks in from behinds and remains on the back of my throat for a few moments."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy golden color with a large white head that goes down quickly. Scent is VERY funky! I love it! Funky barnyard and brett with some hay and tart aromas. Fresh baked sourdough bread with some sharp cheese and citrus notes. Slightly spicy, but more funky than spicy. Love the aroma on this beer. Taste is initially tarts with a good amount of lemon and other citrus flavors. Good amount of barnyard, grass, and pepper. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, crisp, and dry. Drinkability is very high. Overall, I think this is an awesome saison that certainly lets the brett shine through as a fresh beer. I would still like to buy another bottle to see how it evolves over a year or so."
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: This is a pretty sessionable beer, and would probably do well on a sunny summer day."
""
""

""

""
""
"Pours a hazy yellow-orange with a foamy beige head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, earth, yeast, and Brett aromas. Taste is much the same with Brett and yeast flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of Brett bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that showcases a solid earthy Brett presence in the aroma and flavor."
"M: Medium bodied. Richer mouth than expected"
"O- I tried this a couple of times and can say this is a truly great saison. It has a near perfect balance of earth, spice, hops and sourness. Reminiscent of fantome saisons I've had in the past. Hats off to a near perfect saison!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Funk and tart citrus. I enjoyed this one way more than the fist bottle."
"O: This is an enjoyable saison as it has lots of brett aromas and flavors, but neither of which are overpowering."
"This is a pretty good brew. Yummy notes of of funk and brett with a nice fruity backdrop with some slight spice."
""
"D: Had high hopes for this one...it started out well, but didn't quite hold up. A decent example of style, but nothing special. Still, a nicely refreshing and solidly sessionable brew. Would go well at your next picnic."
"O- I was expecting a bit more from this, but overall I enjoyed the beer quite a bit. It is a very nice refreshing saison perfectly suited for summer. Not the best grassroots/hf/abc offering, but very good either way."
""

""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O~ i love how you can really tell that both Grassroots and Anchorage had something to do with this. even in a blind tasting i'm sure i could point it out. it has the amazing citrus smoothness and carbonation of Arthur, and the incredible brett characteristics of Galaxy White IPA. i've never had anything from either of these breweries that hasn't exceeded my expectations!"
""

"Pours bright yellow-gold. Quite cloudy. Solid white head. Good sized layer of foam. Good retention, some lacing. The aroma has fresh grain, dusty barnyard, some light stone fruit, lemons. Lots of brett presence. Clean. The taste adds in more oak than expected. Big acerbic woodiness, particularly in the finish. It’s mostly pleasant. Lots of clean brett flavor. Some apricots and citrus peel. Mouthfeel is lively and light. It’s almost a touch thin for my taste. Very good saison but a touch boring with so many others coming out. It could just use some sort of twist to stand out."
"C+"

"Moderate but distinct Brett flavor. Some peppery notes. Pleasant, delicate fruitiness with more of the barnyard funk. Just a little pineapple and some pear flavors. The modest bitter aftertaste is just right for the light body and dry edge. There might be a faint woodiness, but I don't taste the alleged oak tank fermentation without some imagination. Still, this is a delicious and restrained example of a Saison, and I like this Brett version rather than the often over-the-top yeastiness. From the 750 ml bottle bought for $14.10 at Bottlecraft in San Diego."
"Remembrances from last night when consumed right after La Vermontiose. No where near as dry as Vermontoise on the back end with a more floral, fruity characteristic. The beer pours with a thin head for a Saison that rapidly dissipates for a saison without much lacing left behind. Some barnyard, but not wholly pronounced as much as a sweetness that disappears as the beer warms, switching to the more dry saison character."
