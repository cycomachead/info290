4.35,18.5,4,4.5,4.5,3.75,4.25,"Had this beer from a bomber recently and back in 2012 so I will try to bridge the two tastings. Then it had overwhelming tastes and smells of cucumber. Also rather creamy, perhaps too much and not much crispness or hop. Now in 2015 this beer definitely mellowed out. However that could be because I drank it over six months after its bottling date, not intentionally fyi. Cucumber flavor and smell was still there but not as much as before and still quite a good beer. Also seemed more hoppy and carbonated to the point where there was a massive head even after a slow pour. I think this style and flavor of beer is a fantastic idea but needs some tweaking. Like some sort of twisted beer Stockholm syndrome I want my over the top cucumber flavor back.","barfootbandit","Jan 31, 2015"

Aroma of cucumber is actually quiet dominant with some peppery yeast notes also easily identifiable. Taste is dominated by cucumber notes with loads of peppery yeast and some rustic malt notes. This beer is really dry with loads of attenuation. Body is full with limited filtration and good carbonation. A really interesting experience but cucumber notes are a bit too strong to withstand large quantities of this beer – this is a beer I would share gain with multiple friends.","Phyl21ca","Jun 17, 2014"

3.88,5.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 5/29/2013. Pours lightly hazy bright golden amber color with a 3 finger foamy and rocky white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big fresh cucumber, lemon, pear, pepper, clove, coriander, floral, herbal, grass, cracker, and yeast earthiness. Nice and unique aromas with good complexity of yeast esters with big cucumber presence; with decent balance and good strength. Taste of cucumber, lemon, pear, apple, pepper, clove, coriander, herbal, grass, cracker, bread, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of lemon, cucumber, pear, pepper, clove, coriander, herbal, grass, cracker, bread, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of yeast ester, cucumber, and malt flavors; with a nice malt/spiciness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. High carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice and unique saison style. Well balanced yeast ester, cucumber, and malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 08, 2013"

It smelled like a fresh vegetable garden. I don't care if I was about to drink a beer, the smell is crazy fun. However, upon tasting it you are literally drinking water from a fancy restaurant with cucumber in it. There is a lot of complexities to this beer, but the cucumber is quite powerful. If you are not a fan of cucumber beware, as if the name didn't give it away! The beer is however, very light, crisp, and extremely easy to drink! Just how a sasion should be. Glad I was able to try this guy. Not for me, but a fun unique beer for sure.","beatenbyjacks","Jul 27, 2013"

3.92,6.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"750 ml bottle from ABC Liquors in Oviedo. Pours a golden color with a very slight haze and a medium foamy white head. The aroma is medium with cucumbers, peanuts and more cucumbers, papaya, honey and pepper. The taste, like the aroma, features lots of cucumbers, a tangy lemon bitterness that settles quickly into a grassy finish. Just enough malt to keep the beer actually tasting like a beer. The palate was light and fizzy. A very dry finish invites you back more more swallows. The taste of this beer exceeded my expectations. I found it very refreshing and unique. I have come to expect nothing less from this very creative brewery.","chickenflea","0"

The aroma is muted by the large head, and it seems relatively modest even once the cap is cleared and it is allowed to warm a little bit. The smell is full of cucumber skin, light grains, and a bit of peppery saison yeast. The flavor is over the top cucumber. Even though the flavor is nice, it is simple and really destroys any chance of complexity there could be to this beer. Light grains and notes of pepper add a little bit of depth. A slight vaguely vegetable note comes in at the end. The finish is still more cucumber. The body is a bit fuller than I usually expect from a saison, but it is still on the light side overall. The carbonation has a light creaminess to it, but overall is crisp and smooth.","jbaker67","Jul 12, 2013"

Now, that's a good thing if you really, really, really like cucumber, otherwise... I like it well enough in the aroma, it lends a crisp, almost floral note, with a residual creamy vegetal nose. The taste is just too much cucumber, though. I have palate fatigue after 1/2 of a glass, and I'm craving something more- a blast of white pepper, some sourness, a heavy herbalness, anything to break the unrelenting cucumber assault. A bit too slick on the palate as well. This one is a miss for me.","Georgiabeer","Jul 03, 2013"

But if you're in the market for cucumber, this is the beer for you. Unlike Magic Hat's new HiCu, this is not a complete cucumber bomb. Instead, it offers a nice, mellow cucumber aroma and flavor, with just a touch of citrus and a pilsner-esque malt backbone. There's a very slight touch of yeast spiciness, but it's kept in check very well. Cucumber Saison is an excellent vegetable beer. Realistic flavor without being overpowering, this is a winner. Just don't expect much in the way of saison flavors, at least when as fresh as this bottle is (bottled last Friday). Perhaps more time brings out more saison aspects.","shand","May 28, 2013"

Poured from the glass, the beer was a golden color with a fizzy white head. Cucumber is the most noticeable element in the aroma. In the initial taste was cucumber, cucumber peal, a little straw and salt. If you have ever been to a restaurant that serves cucumber slices in their glasses of water, this should give you some perspective. The aftertaste is dry, which is the most saison-like element of this beer. The funkiness of a saison seems to have been cancelled out by the cucumber.

I won't lie, the aroma scared me into thinking my wife, a cucumber lover, would be drinking the vast majority of this bottle, but Cigar City did a fantastic job with this beer. Like a cucumber, this saison has a heavy nose that's lighter in flavor, letting more saison through. It's incredibly authentic and the comparison of the cucumber's crispness with the saison is a wonderful pairing. I still may not like cucumbers but I can get behind this unique saison and say it's one well-crafted beer!","BeerFMAndy","Feb 01, 2013"

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, cucumber, spices, and earth. The flavor was of sweet malt, cucumber, spice, earth, and earthy hop. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. If I am honest here, I really like cucumber, however the cucumber in this brew was SO intense that it was almost unnatural. My guess is that they used an extract on this brew as the cucumber isn’t know for being too strong on taste for the most part. While I’m glad Cigar City wanted to try something new I just don’t think the cucumber addition was the right choice on this one.

Head retention is very good, and while there's a little bit of lacing, there could definitely stand to be a little bit more. Amazingly enough, cucumber is indeed the first the to jump out as I take in the aroma. There's a little bit of tropical fruit and citrus present as well, but that's all *very* much in the background. Again, cucumber is the centerpiece of the flavor profile, but the fruity, lemony accents from the Citra and Sorachi Ace hops are a little more present here. In fact, they actually are a little too loud, and clash a bit with the delicate, refreshing flavor of the cucumber. The body is just a little too full for being a low ABV saison, though the carbonation attempts to sparkle through it admirably. Cucumber is definitely on the list of ingredients I never thought I'd see in a beer, but Cigar City has definitely done an admirable job of infusing a beer with cucumber flavor. It's just the rest of the recipe that's a little lacking.","axeman9182","Aug 12, 2012"

The shop had a few selections from this brewery and I chose this one (of course i was seeking their heralded imperial stout to no avail). But anyway, good timing as this was July when bought, early August when consumed.  I think Cigar City must be in the same spirit as DFH is up in Delaware.. that is, unique effort here!!

4,9,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a hazy yellow color with a white head. The aroma is full of cucumbers, water and a little bit of biscuit malt. This smells like I think it would if you ran cucumbers through a Jack LaLanne Power Juicer. The flavor is more of the same. I get a ton of cucumber, as well as some biscuit malt, Belgian yeast, pepper and a hint of lemon and orange. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. My only complaint is that I wish the beer was green.","Mora2000","Jul 01, 2012"

Smell is of grain and lots of cucumber aromas. Taste is of grain, cucumber, herbs, and spices. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel.

But I don't think this one should have ever left the tasting room. I'd take their Guava Grove or Table Saison over this any day of the week. If your looking for liquid salad, have fun but making a cucumber/lettuce/vodka blend will give you the same effect without spending $12 for 750ml. Hyped up, yes.

Spicy and lemony behind that wall of dimed cucumbers. Taste: cucumber and lemon, mildly tangy, sugary honeyed-biscuit, then more lemon peel and cucumber into a drying finish. Carbonation is perfect with a light-medium body and a pillowy feel. I like cucumber, but after the initial few sips, I wasn't sure I'd get through a bomber... then the Sorachi Ace started kicking in. A great combo. It's quite tasty, and does a fantastic job featuring cucumber. Bottled 6/8/12.","babaracas","Jun 23, 2012"

At first I wasn't sure how cucumber fits with beer (I can definitely see why people might not like this that much), but I definitely think this was a perfect summer beer for a hot night (drinking this in 90 degree summer heat). It was light, crisp, refreshing, well-balanced, and flavorful. If you like interesting beers I definitely recommend picking this up and giving it a try. Not your typical saison, but definitely enjoyable.","jaasen64","Jun 15, 2012"

The cucumber is more prominent than the nose suggests but ts not over the top or unpleasant at all. Really light and refreshing, making this beer extremely drinkable.

The taste is Cucumber also, I like that it really stands out and isn't masked in any way. The beer is surprisingly refreshing in my opinion. The mouthfeel is clean and carbonated with a light finish.

This beer is well balanced with the right amount of cucumber in the nose and taste. It doesn’t over power the beer but enhances the flavor. If it wasn’t for the fact, FB had a CCB tap takeover with Virgin Oak Hunahpu on tap, I would have drank this beer til the tap blew. From start to end, this is a great saison.","biggsbowler","Sep 24, 2011"
4.54,23.7,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured a glowing gold with a thin white head that settles to a slight haze. Huge aromas of cucumber and Saison yeast, with a slight pickle brine character. Taste follows the nose nicely, just slightly briny, yet so crisp and drinkable. Just a perfect melding between a cucumber and a Saison, if you can imagine such a thin. Mouthfeel is light and crisp, with a medium body and good, sharp carbonation. Tied with Final Push for my favorite beer of the day, this was an amazing offering!","jsanford","Sep 12, 2011"
