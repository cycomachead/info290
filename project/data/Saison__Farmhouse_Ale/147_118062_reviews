"This was good, and I will have it again to see if each batch brings something different to the table, but it was only above average for the style and almost like a Stone book report since the brew was very non-aggressive. Worth a try for sure, but those who fancy themselves as saison purists will be a little let down."

"Overall:  This is a pretty good saison, but to my palate, not great.  I like the flavors of toasted malt, orange-like citrus and the spices, but for my taste, there is way too much hops and bitterness.  It really doesn’t even come off as a saison, in my mind, just a very spicy American pale ale or IPA.  I shouldn’t have been surprised, this is a beer brewed by Stone Brewery, however, I am disappointed."
""
"Overall: I enjoy saisons, and I enjoy Stone, but this was disappointing. Didn't taste too much like a Stone take on the style, and the differences between this and a traditional saison don't bring anything to the table"

"I find it interesting in that the dryness at the end prompts you to go back to the beginning where you found that juicy fruitiness, making it almost compellingly drinkable. What it lacks is something that I find kind of intangible, or at least hard to explain in many cases, and that has to do with the complexity of the yeast. This is fairly straightforward, and essentially ""clean", which is usually a great thing but this time around I'm missing a little bit more of the funkiness or unusual yeasty character that you sometimes find in a saison. On the other hand, they do state that it's ""A MODERN TAKE ON A BELGIAN CLASSIC", so I can hardly complain - and as I look at an empty glass I really can't complain! If you can handle the spicy pepperiness that'll build on your palate I'd recommend you give it a shot."

"Very yeast forward with some slight Cyrus but heavy on the spice.  Very creamy with lots of carbonation.  Big big big head"
"Pours a deep cloudy gold with a nice thick creamy white head. The head has nice retention and leaves little soapy specks of lacing. The aroma is great, with big fruity esters and spices. The taste, though, is kind of off. And hard to describe. It's not bad, but it doesn't match the aroma or the style completely. I'm guessing it's the different herbs used in the brewing process. It's light-bodied and pretty effervescent. The flavors may work for you. They don't do it for me."

"Stone's own attempt at a saison does no harm. A fair changeup from their hopped-up lineup."

"O- Your opinion of this beers depends on how you like spices in beers. To me they really could have called this a spice beer rather than a regular saison. After a bit I got used to the thyme flavor but it still overwhelms and detracts from what you usually look for in the style. Tone down the spices and don't filter it and Stone might have something."
""
""
""
"Leave it to Stone to take a complex, complicated style, and put its own stamp on it.  However, this time it's a subtle, yet firm touch, rather than the usual slow-swinging sledgehammer - a pleasant, enjoyable warm fall day sipper."
"D:  Not really a big fan with this one at all.  I find Stone’s Saison to be just too aggressive for the style.  Has a sharp bitterness with some harsh smoky phenol components that really stand out.  I typically look for a more delicate and balanced approach here."
""
"Overall - something different, but enjoyable...if I'm looking for a change of pace beer during the Summer, it's great!"

"Golden in color with excellent clarity.  A fingernail of white foam covers the vast majority of the top of this beer.  Faint Brussels lacing.  Aroma is comprised of light bready malt and a whiff of lemon zest.  The flavor features the Belgian saison yeast and a nice lemon zest fade.  The mouth is slightly carbonated and the lemon zest provides a refreshing angle."
""
""
""

"Aggressive spice nose and flavor. Complex. An enjoyable diversion from my usual corners of the world, but not conducive to session drinking."

"Every time I review a beer from Stone that I do not particularly enjoy, I say the same thing: I really love Stone and they make great beers... This just isn't one of them. It's somewhere between an interesting experiment and a flop. I really wouldn't call this a saison. It's lacking all the subtlety that the style demands. As a lavender & herb beer, I guess it works."
""
""
""
""
"O-to much sprice and citrus rind taste ill avoid this one when wanting a saison"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"(3.60) O:  big visual, spicy dry flavor, easy consumption, an everyday saision if that's what you are looking for. Hardcore farmhouse fans may find this a bit of a let down flavor wise."

""
""

"Overall: Solid saison, but not my favorite Stone brew. It's slightly more aggressive than I typically prefer in this style. Worth a try."
"Overall not a bad beer but nothing to write home about.  Worthy of a shot."

"unique that you are thrown into oddity is not."

"Nice to see Stone offering up something that's ostensibly not a hop-bomb of sorts.  This stuff pours a hazy amber-brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam.  The nose comprises clove, light black pepper, sweet flowers, light grass, light wheat, a hint of lemon zest, and a touch of Belgian candi sugar.  The taste continues to bring the spice pain, the lemon, wheat, and yeast tossed on the back burner to languish.  Some leafy greens try to peak in from the distant background, but to very little avail.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel.  Overall, though not necessarily a bad beer, per se, it's a pretty weak excuse for a saison.  Yeah, I'm probably not gonna grab another bottle of this any time soon."
""
""
"TONS of spice and floral notes, overwhelming almost,still,an interesting beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Wow this thing is a spice bomb. It seems like there might be a decent saison in there but it is so aggressively spiced that it's hard to tell. It also takes, what should be a refreshing style, and makes the drinkability very low. If you're a big fan spiced beers, then this may be your thing, but otherwise I'd stay away."
"A superlative example of the style, and probably the best saison I’ve ever had. Really."

"12oz. bottle served in a tulip.  Pours a dull orange-gold with a murky clarity and a frothy, 1.5 inch bright white head.  Nose suggests coriander, citrus zest and an herbal presence.  Taste is much more herbal than suggested by the nose, with the addition of lavender and thyme, and finishes with a slight peppery kick and a lingering medicinal bitterness which I can't say that I'm overly fond of.  The mouthfeel is the best aspect of this beer.  Light in body with a bright carbonation and a mild, citric acidity.  All and all, an interesting take on the style but there is too much happening in the herbs department which makes it far from refreshing."
""
""
""
"Light bodied, modest carbonation. Has a strong lavender aftertaste. Not a good beer in my opinion, and I say that as one who likes most Stone beers."
""
"Does NOT taste like a Saison.  It's too assertively spiced and has a strong medicinal flavor.  It's almost completely undrinkable and I poured it down the drain after drinking half the pint, hoping it would grow on me.  This beer is a terrible offering from Stone.  Very disappointing.  Save your money."
""
""
""
""

""
"Not a saison. Not remotely close to a saison. Not even a good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not the best Saison in my humble opinion, but if you've had it and enjoyed it then that's all that really matters."
""
""
""
""
""
"It didn't blow me away.  Very average tasting saison.  Not a ton of spice and the aftertaste could be a bit more pleasant."
""
""
"Misc.: Went well with tuna and wasabi. Don't let this beer warm up too much, as it becomes overpoweringly sour. This is my first Saison, so I am not rating by style."

"A well done saison. The herbs notes are enjoyable, but prevent me from wanting another glass."
""
""
""
"If this is an ""expired"" beer, then I can only imagine that a fresher version would be even better. I can see that this beer would not be for everyone - but for an unusual, spicy, refreshing summer brew, it does the trick quite nicely."

"Enjoy by 08/13/14. 12oz bottle served in pint glass. Beer pours bright yellow and hazy, with a giant pillowy white head. Pervasive and pleasant aroma of lemon verbena and lavender. Flavor brings some immediate acidity. Sourness is accentuated by a heftly load of carbon dioxide. Past that, there's a little bit of fruit on the tongue, and a pleasant almost-dry finish. But really the sourness just isn't my thing. This is clearly a well executed Belgian Saison, but I'm not feeling it."
""
"O- I was really hoping this beer would taste like Tiger Cub saison because that was actually a good saison. This one just has way too many spices and is one-dimensional as a result. Drinkable, just not any fun to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I absolutely love Saisons and they are one of my favorite style; Stone has not done it justice. Making a good Saison basically involves using the right yeast and the right temperatures. It seems like Stone just through a ton of spices in the brew to cover up any imperfections. Not really worth seeking out."
""
"With a towering white head and a lot of carbonation, this beer is very refreshing. Cloudy, hazy, and golden-yellow. The appearance is great. The aroma is spicy, with notable hop, spice, and a little soft malt smells. The taste is peppery, dry, and more bitter than expected. Malt flavors are present, but fruit is distant and the most notable characteristic is spiciness and hop bitterness. Medium in body. The dryness makes the beer very enjoyable on a hot day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Good, solid saison. Safe might be the most apt word to describe it. I'm not usually one to suggest a beer / food pairing, but I think this would go awesome with a salmon and wild rice dinner."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"D - The appearance and aromas are appealing enough, but things begin to fall apart a bit in terms of the flavor profile and mouthfeel... Overall a bit less than the sum of its parts... The end result is one of the few overall misses that I've encountered from Stone... The recent Stone Matt's Buring Rosids Smoked Saison is far far superior offering... There are too many excellent Saisons out there to recommend this one with good conscious... Sorry Stone..."
"Pours a fairly clear medium golden color with a smallish bubbly white head that dissipates rather quickly. The aroma is filled with an overwhelming amont of spice that is barely backed up by some bready lemony malt, The flavor again is over the top spices with hints of bready lemon hints of earth and funk. Medium body mderate carbonation. Too spicy for me, I can see past the spice rack."
""
""
""
"Update: Doh! I finally read the bottle... This brew is made with lemon thyme and lavender, plus lemon zest! That makes so much sense. I picked out the lemon thyme ( quite proud of that, actually), but missed the lavender. It's there if you go looking for it, but is easily hidden and confounded by the thyme and lemony notes. Nicely blended profile, but I still get marjoram and sage... It's an interesting bouquet to say the least!"

"First off... huge Stone fan, pretty new to Saison-style beers. Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my tulip glass. 1/4 finger of white head left quickly, though slight lacing was present throughout. Beautiful copper hue. Interesting aromas of anise, pepper, lavender (as things warmed up), and Belgian funk (in a good way; again, new to saisons). Tasted a hint of lemon, and a nice peppery finish. Smooth mouthfeel. I enjoyed this beer. Nice stepping stones like this could get me more interested in the Belgian styles as a whole. Well worth a try."
""
""
""
"An okay saison. One-dimensional in a weird way, with a hefty dose of added citrus that's just too much, overpowering the subtler saison character."
""
""
"Overall a pretty middle-of-the-road saison, which is more or less what I was expecting. Enjoyable enough but not in the same class as some of the greats."
""
""
"Pours yellow and hazy with a thin head nof white foam that falls fast but leaves a film on top and some loose bubbles. Has a good bit of funk on the nose and some honey malt sweetness. A nice tart lemon with some bright lemon peel. A bit of floral musk and a maybe a hint of orange. Mouthfeel is a bit thin and could use just a few more bubbles. Drinks well though with a soft malt, cracker sweetened with honey. A bit of that funk gets to the palate and is a touch sour. The fruits combine in this for an overall fruity middle but nothing you could name. Finishes dry and a touch tart with some aftertaste to leave you thinking that maybe it is a bit too sweet. It has a musky floral that develops in the nose as it warms and that is light and powdery dry in the drink. Also shows some pepprcorns as I am finishing the glass."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I could certainly do without the added spices, but overall an adequate American-made Saison."
""
""
""
""
"I hope Stone revamps the shit out of this beer, because it sure needs it."
""
"O - Fruity and light. A soft saison. Tasty beer."
""
""
""
"Semi-dry from start to finish, the body feels light while maintaining closer to medium, but bright, zesty, crisp and refreshing enough that it's far from heavy. Dryness and spiciness work on the palate gently but convincingly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy golden color with thin head. Nose is moderately assertive with some nice barnyard and funky fruits, maybe smelly cheese. Palate offers a nice sourness, good drinkability, citrusy hops, and good carbonation. Easier drinking than many other American attempts."
""
""
""
"I can see this being a good BBQ beer, to be enjoyed with ribs, rotisserie chicken or kabobs. I could also see going into seafood with a great beer like this one. Toss back one or two while chowing down on some crab, lobster or even a nice piece of pan seared halibut."

"Overall, not a terrible brew, but I think it falls short in terms of the style. The metallic taste was hard to overlook. Seems muddled in terms of the flavors, nothing really ""crisp"" or well-defined."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a light golden color. Mostly clear with a chill haze and leaves a lot of lace. Aroma has herbal notes, clove, rosemary, sage. In the taste, pepper, clove, rosemary and sage. Light bitterness but definitely big herbal and spice. Medium bodied ale with a good carbonation. Overall, decent but definitely herbal and spicy."
""
""
""
""
""
"(And the more it lingers - and burns - in my mouth, the more idiotic this beer comes off.)"
""
""
""
""
""
"More bread in the initial taste with a kick of white pepper. Lower carbonation but still plenty of crisp bite in the finish. Dries out very well with more lemon. Easy drinking with some noble hop bitterness. Nice touch of herbal notes throughout."
""
""
"Overall it was tasty with a good hoppy taste and some lemon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, hazy, orange-gold coloring with a thin, sparse, bubbly, white surface coat of head, and a steady flow of carbonation throughout the body. Aromas of lemon, thyme, pepper, coriander, berries, subtle toasted grain backbone, spearmint, and floral highlights. Flavors are spiced and tart forward, with a blast of thyme, evergreen, spearmint, lemon zest, and a citrus blend of lemon and orange. Pretty balanced and flavorful. Toasted backbone, with a farmhouse highlight and subtle yeasty funk throughout. The body is light and slightly crisp, with a spiced and subtle fruity aftertaste. The finish is smooth, lingering, and slightly spiced. Solid brew."

"O: A very approachable saison for folks that want an easy drinking introduction to the style. Flavors and aromas are true to the style and this one is pretty refreshing. I could easily have a couple of these in a session. Alcohol is well hidden."
""
"I've always enjoyed a good saison, so I was happy to see Stone release its version. the appearance is nothing special--light yellow straw color--but, I buy beer to drink, not stare at. The aroma is such that there is no mistaking it as anything other than a saison. There is a hint of orange beyond the belgian yeast. Taste follows the nose with a citrusy yeast flavor, followed by a peppery characteristic. It's a bit more peppery than the ""run-of-the-mill"" saison, which I enjoy. A faint piney hop bitterness lingers on the tongue. Overall, a solid brew."
""
""
""
"O: OK for the style, Stone does better with IPAs"

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
"Peppery flavors, upfront, with more coriander and herbal notes. Sweetness lowered by chalky yeast dryness and multiple hop bitterness. Earthy, lightly citrusy (in the same fashion as the nose), and finishing dry and a little green. Wacky, but good. Carbonation is pointing towards high with a slick and light-medium weight. Easy drinking."

"Stone Saison ---3.5/5"
""
""
""
""
""
"Hazy yellow gold with a short, foamy cap of lingering bubbles, sort of off-white and clingy. Lots of spice character in the aroma, lemongrass, a bit perfumy. Grain and grass up front, more spices and lemon, then lingering, earthy, sharp bitterness. Medium bodied with plenty of coarse carbonation, lingering spicy warmth. Not my favourite Stone beer or saison."
"overall, i quite like this beer. i am not uber familiar with saisons, but this one impressed me quite a bit. i would drink it again and hope to try more!"
"Overall, kind of odd with the sweet lemon, soapy spices and a bitter peppery finish."
""
""

"Eric"
"O: A fairly simple and easy-going saison. Definitely leans more on the lemon and pepper notes than anything else. If you enjoy Stone, it's worth a shot. It'll probably get lost in the sea of different saisons, otherwise"
""
"Overall verdict: a decent saison. Like most of Stone's beers, this one isn't subtle. It's a good in-your-face Saison, but is a bit one dimensionally heavy on the pepper spice."
"O-Too one dimensional. Heavily spiced with little nuance, but still a decent saison."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Oh yeah sign me up for this when it finally gets to Illinois. A very American saison and everything you would expect from Stone. Stone haters be damned, this and Go To will be my summer beers all year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Stone have never been much for treading lightly, and this is hardly an exception. Once again, they've managed to take a style I almost invariably enjoy and leave me nonplussed and underwhelmed. I'll give them points for creativity though, as I've never tasted anything quite like this. I'd consider this as something of a concept beer as opposed to a proper saison. It's certainly an adventure for the taste buds if nothing else."
""
""
""
"Pours out a pale brass with a moderate head. Thyme and citrus is very evident in the smell, along with some earthy hops. Flavor is of crackery malts/grains, floral hops, thyme, citrus, and lavender. Finishes relatively dry. Body is light with prickly carbonation. Overall, this is a solid American version of a saison."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Lovely gold colored body with exceptional clarity. The head formation was about one finger thick, forming sheets of lace. The aroma was very floral and herbal, with a smell of lavender, dried coriander seeds, and thyme. The taste was a little unusual for the style, as the notes of spice and flowers, that were first evident in the nose, were followed shortly by an unexpected hop bitterness, and then finished with a dash of pepper. The feel was little on the lighter side for the style, making this more of a summertime Saison. A bit of a departure from the usual Stone offerings."

"This beer is more of an experiment than another addition to the line up for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Look, don't kid yourself, I'm actually a fan of lavender, but, wow, the wheels fell off FAST. What a complete shock of a surprise!"
"Mouthfeel is quite creamy and pleasant. Overall, this is a pretty good saison."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hazy golden yellow covered with a nice looking head of sticky creaminess. Smells like a pleasant blend of herbs and flowers on top of a biscuity pale malt base. Lavender, cardamom, coriander, honey, flower petals, licorice, and sugary citrus...spiced up and adorned like many American Saisons tend to be, but Stone pulls of the blend very well. Flavor opens up with a blast of spicy yeast, leading to a more subtle lavender and herb presence, and finishing quite crisp and dry. Zesty citrus, perfumey floral notes, peppercorns, grass. and mint. Definitely not a Saison where the yeast and funk do all the talking - again, more of a jazzed-up American style, which I'm generally not a huge fan of, but I like the end result here. It's a fun, pleasant, tasty blend of flavors that I found quite enjoyable."
""
""
""
"Taste carries on the concept with a light body and perhaps sensing some wheat in the mix. Smooth aftter a spin yet perhaps a bit thin without. Carbonation is there but not quite as firm as I would prefer. Interesting finish and a bit cloaking. Not very yeast/spice driven but yet not so in a negative/additive sense either. Starts off as a BPA but finishes differently but yet not to style as a Saison. Good but a bit chalky in the end for the style."
""
""
"This could be great, yet the sum of its parts is anything but. Close, and probably easily fixable, but as it is I can promise you that this particular Stone fan will never revisit it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: Overall an extreme beer - I'd almost call it gruit / herbed beer with all the strong herbal flavors going on with this beer. So an overall interesting beer, but I would not have recognized it for a Saison if it hadn't said so on the glass - too strong herbal flavors and not enough malt and other flavors to compliment. But maybe that's the point Stone wanted to make in complimenting the herbs from their garden. As for drinkability - one is enough. I could not have a second one as it awfully powerful on the palate and wears it out. It's the lavender I think. I've had it once or twice in beers and it always wrecks my taste buds. So great looking beer and it smells really nice, but then it drops off."

"DATE REVIEWED: May 16, 2014... GLASSWARE: Hennepin footed pokal... OCCASION: ""coerced"" by a free sample at Bottle King--oh well... APPEARANCE: a central bubble of life awakens the clear, golden body; thick, cascading white lacing that creates a lasting horizon... AROMA: immediate Cali citrus with a yeasty funk that melds well with the airy floral scents that evoke lavender or lilac--definitely a farmhouse concoction... PALATE: soft, active body--palate cleansing and refreshing; pleasant,, lengthy aftertaste...TASTE: funky, almost spicy yeast that finds the teeth as hops might; a complete profile, far beyond the hay and decay one usually encounters in this genre, with pepper sprucing up the yeast...OVERALLL: first off, I love saisons --not much needed to give this a thumbs up, but add Stone to the mix, and we have a new possibility: a refreshing yet boldly spicy, floral take...."
""
""
"Overall: an interesting beer, perhaps not my favorite saison but definitely worth a try if you're a fan of the style."
""
"edit: upon finishing the six pack, i really taste more of the lemon thyme, which of course is an herb not a spice, despite the label. its more refreshing than i remember from the earlier bottles, and while i still dont much care for the yeast, the beer is better than i first thought it was. worth a try i think."
""
"Light head retention and fades quickly. Aroma has strong clove and coriander with light fruitiness. I thought the taste was too strong with clove for a Saison but had nice spice with the coriander. I was expecting more fruitiness taste and aroma. It's not the best Saison I've had but worth trying."
""
""
""
"12 ounce bottle in to tulip glass, best before 7/30/2014. Pours fairly hazy/cloudy bright gold color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon zest, orange peel, pear, apple, clove, black pepper, herbal, floral, grass, wheat, bread, lavender, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, spices, and pale malt notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon zest, orange peel, pear, apple, clove, black pepper, lavender, wheat, bread, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Moderate earthy bitterness/spiciness and light tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, orange peel, pear, apple, clove, pepper, lavender, wheat, bread, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good robustness and complexity of pale malt, fruity/spicy yeast, and spice flavors; with a decent spice/yeast/malt flavor balance and minimal cloying flavors after the finish. Fairly intense on the spices in the taste, but not horrible. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately crisp, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice spiced saison style. Good complexity and robustness of pale malt, fruity/spicy yeast, and spice flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."
""
"It seemed overly bitter at first, but thankfully, that was fleeting. This beer just got better and better. Another classic over the top brew by Stone. Variety is the spice of life. Superb!"
""
""
"Very good beer. And the fact that it seems to be filtered is a big plus for me, as I have to limit yeast consumption for health reasons (which has really taken a toll on my consumption of Belgian styles)."
""
""
"Had on tap today at Sticks and Stones.Came to the table ina snifter a light lemon yellow with a half finger white head that left some froth.Lemon oils in the nose along with some yeasty spice.Tart lemon flavors with the sage just faintly is detected,mild white pepper in the finish.Not but it's not overly complex,basic but drinkable."
"As a long time fan of Stone I was excited to try their take on the saison. Picked up a sixer for a memorial day bbq. This one pours a hazy straw color with a small and short lasting white head that leaves little lacing. The nose is a refreshing blend of citrus (lemon peel and oranges), spices (coriander, pepper, and juniper, and bready malt and funky yeast. Its quite a nice bouquet. The mouthfeel is light, effervescent, and quenching. The taste is not quite as refreshing as the nose with more west coast hops dominating and not as much of the belgian and farmhouse characteristics coming through. It is still a nice blend of citrus, spice, and funkiness though. This was good but I was hoping for more from such a great brewer. Uts definitely a Stone style saison though."
""
"12 oz bottle. Pours hazy golden with small, short-lived, white head. Aroma is of funky yeast, spices, bready malt, wheat and some floral hops. Body is medium and tangy. Herbal hops, funky yeast, pale malt and lemon zest fill the mouth. Finish is long, dry and spicy. Nice brew for spicy foods."

"O: I love Stone, and think this is a well done beer. Its just what I look for in a saison. Certainly worthy of a try though."

"O - Not the best Saison, but still a nice refreshing summer beer."

"Not a bad attempt of a Saison. Though nowhere near close to some of my favorites of the style."

"Vigorously poured a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Half an inch of foamy white head sitting on a slightly hazy amber beer.Head dissipated quickly into small islands. Lots of malt and spices on the nose some hop, but mostly spice. Tastes like it smells. Decent beer, but there are better brews to be had."

"Overall I thought this was a decent beer and a pretty average example of the style, it had most of the aspects that I look for in the style, but they weren't as refined as I would like them to be and that made this beer feel a little rough around the edges and the balance seemed to be a little out of wack. This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it was fairly smooth, not the cleanest, slightly crisp, not too filling and the taste didn't do the best job at holding my attention so one would be enough for me, I don't have any urge to drink another one in a row. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance, I thought it was pretty good and it seemed to be the aspect that was truest to style. What I liked the least about this beer was the balance and the lower amount of carbonation, to me those were things that needed the most work. I wouldn't get this beer again, it's pretty easy to find a Saison that better suites my taste and I don't think I would recommend this as a good Saison. All in all I wasn't too impressed with this beer, lately I've found myself being a little let down with these new beers from Stone and this one is no different. It's for sure not my favorite Saison and it's not even close to being one of the better beers from Stone. I appreciate the effort, but this one could use some work, better luck next time guys."
"M - Light and refreshing, sans the lingering character mentioned earlier."

"O: I admit being completely skeptical in Stone's ability to make a proper saison. As a simple herbed/spiced beer, honestly it ain't bad. But as a saison? Fail, fail, fail. This actually makes a really good comparison to Allagash's saison I just had a few minutes ago: Allagash Saison is subtle and balanced, this isn't. Allagash Saison is easy to drink and refreshing, this isn't. But hey, this does do one thing better than Allagash Saison: it's far more overspiced. About the only things it really does right is A) it's not undrinkable, and B) could make a solid cooking adjunct."
"Good beer."
"Quite an interesting saison, I like the peppery tastes a lot. It ain't a Colette, but it's a good saison for sure."
""
""
"A good attempt at a saison, but a bit too spicy and bitter on the end. The light malt backbone is almost there, but still not quite."
""
""
""
"Overall a tasty and pleasant ale. Bit sweeter than the average Saison."

"I dig it. First sip had me disappointed, but it was just too cold to be sipped when I first tasted it. I wish I know the exact price I paid on this beer, as I got it at a beer store I don't usually go to and there wasn't a sticker on the bottle, or a receipt (wtf?). It really is a pretty interesting beer, and I'm not finding it NEARLY as harsh as some other reviewers do with the carbonation. The lavender is definitely there but not in an overly-done way, and the lemon zest and thyme make an otherwise-can-sometimes-be boring style more interesting. It's not blowing me away, but I like that little bit of Saison funk with the added flavors, as it makes for a light and refreshing beer. Nice job again, Stone."

"Lemony and herbal with a nice spicy base. To me none of the flavors are too over the top and I think they balance out nicely but I could see how some get turned off."
""
"Excellent beer, extends the dimension of the style in a dominating way, which Stone fans are bound to appreciate. Not anywhere near my favorite Saison, but a great hot weather cooler and far more affordable than the authentic Belgian ones. I'll definitely revisit this one a time or two this summer."

"O- A nice Saison for the price, worth picking up."
"Overall, this is a solid saison, but nothing to get excited about."
""

"The Verdict: Very good. Everything a saison should be, with some added Stone freshness and some California style spice. One of the better saisons I’ve had."
""

"It has an extreme sweet lemon and bitter hop scent. It's a gold with a very mild haze to it. Limited white head and little lacing."
""
""
""
""
"Overall OK, but nothing great, too much hop component but that's typical stone, nice spices but a bit too much, decent farmhouse but not enough I think, but typical American saison that doesn't quite get the style original style, but it's a thing of it's own but not my cup of tea as much as a French or Belgian."
""

""

"Overall: A really interesting and good twist on a Saison. Solid fruit notes with a bigger hop presence than typical for the style. The lavender adds a really interesting and nice kick. I haven't had such a lavender heavy beer since Indeed's LSD."
"Overall, I like this quite a lot, and would get it again. Though the mouthfeel leaves a bit to be desired, the spunky and refreshing profile wins me over in the end. I think it's a unique take on a saison and fits in well within the usual clean profile of Stone's lineup."

"It's going in too many different places at once with the flavor profile."

"Strange to have a Sasion coming from Stone. It was quite good, fruity and somewhat skunky, or sour, like a saison should be. That being said this still might be my least favorite stone beer. There are plenty of other amazing saisons out there, so why take a departure from what you do best?"
"O- appearance and aroma were wonderful, taste was too hoppy, mouth feel was OK. If they had cut the hops in half, this would have been much better. Let the yeast shine!"
"This is pretty tasty. It reminds me a bit of a super dry Nicie Spicy, with all that lemon and pepper, with a stronger bitterness. Pleasantly surprised. I would buy this again. Very recommended."
""
""
""
"O - Drinkable...for sure, interesting...yes, great...maybe not. Seems a bit dull and lifeless for the style - a style that is so broad and filled with countless stretches on the borders of the style in many examples. Seems a bit bland and lifeless by comparison...and probably overhopped and too bitter. The hops seem to push back all of the other character in the flavor and aroma."
""
""
""
""
"M - less of a crushable refreshing Saison and more of a complex sipper, akin to a Belgian IPA but with a very dry finish, not sweet one bit... Ample delicious hops let you know this is still a stone brew."
""
"this saison isnt a bad beer- the color threw me off a bit- i expected it to be cloudy. its clear. the smell has a lot of earthy spiciness- so that was good. the taste comes on spicy like i would expect in a saison- but this one finishes with a pretty big bitter kick- which i realized, this is a beer from stone- they typically throw a punch. this is what you should expect from a saison from stone."
""
"Nup. It's okay, but only okay. Stone are good craftsmen—they have the skill to get the fundamentals right—but there's absolutely no art to the beer, and this is a style that demands it. It's a weak, disappointing echo of a great style, and there are far better examples out there for you to find."
""
"O: An interesting twist on a farmhouse ale. Not sure I would put in the Saison category, but still a very enjoyable farmhouse style ale."
""
""
"O: awesome, very peppery saison, need to find in the stores.  I feel like this could be one of the first cheap saisons"
""
""
""
"YUMMY; GRAB A BOTTLE!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a nice hoppy Saison, with a complex mix of flavors that mostly works. Definitely off-style, but I don't care about strict guidelines."
"This does not seem quite true to style, but I found it tasty nonetheless."
""
"Overall – An alright saison, but overly spiced and rather unbalanced with too much herb and grass to really make it all that enjoyable."
""
"So, Stone's take on a Saison is really a Belgian pale ale, but it's a pretty decent one. More enjoyable than Cali-Belgique IPA as far as I'm concerned."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - The taste is ok but the sourness is too high, especially in the finish, really overpowers the overall flavor. Would like to see some more fruits take stage over all the lemon and sour flavors. Its decent, not great and nothing id seek out or really need to have again."

"I'm not a huge fan of the style, and I'm overly sensitive to bitterness, so this is not my cup of tea."
""
""
"Now, all that being said, would I buy it again? Hard to say. If I just wanted a beer and didn't want to think about it, I might grab this. If I wanted a saison, I'd still go with Dupont or Logsdon. Cheers"
"Certainly more hoppy than most farmhouse ales, it's easy to forget that Saisons can be quite hoppy. Stone's use of citrusy American hops may kick it out of ""Belgian"" style, but reigns in into ""West Coast"" style."

"Cracked open a fresh bottle. It poured a clear gold with a white head. Overall it's a dry and spicy saison, but with hits of citrus you won't find in traditional Belgians. The aroma is more grassy lemon, while the flavor matches juicy hops with coriander and peppercorns. There is an astringent touch in the mouthfeel that knocks the beer, but otherwise this is a very solid American take on the style. Definitely give it a shot."
"Light body with a crisp peppery spice presence that's countered by bready yeast, farmhouse funk, light fruit notes and tart citrus sweetness. The zesty spice is prominent with hints of white pepper, ginger, grains of paradise and coriander. This is complimented by a subtle earthy/grassy hop presence and a decent amount of musty saison yeast. Decent amount of funk without overpowering the other notes giving off hints of wet hay, straw and grass. Some bread and biscuit flavor present mid-palate followed by apple, pear and citrus sweetness. Again, the citrus flavor becomes more prominent as it warms with slightly tart lemon juice and zesty lemon rind. Overall, the flavor profile is very similar to the aroma in that nothing really stands out but there is an excellent balance of interesting flavor. Not in the top tier of saisons I've tried but it's light, flavorful and dangerously sessionable. A decent go to beer for warmer weather months."

"O: I'm very impressed with how well they made this! I think I would be more apt to buy this if it was $9.99 and not $12.99. This is a great summer beer and will pair well with seafood and lemon pepper chicken. Try it for yourself!"
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy golden-yellow with a foamy bone head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, spice, yeast, and herb aromas. Taste is much the same with herb and yeast flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of herb bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some nice herb forward aromas and flavors."
""
"Feel is a medium light body, very crisp with a dry finish. Alcohol hidden well, fun to drink on a warm day"

"O: Not what I was expecting at all from them for a saison. I feel like saisons are quite varied and have a whole spectrum unto themselves."
"Perhaps a less bold version of the saison du buff collaboration from a while back. Stone's Belgian style ales are really nothing to write home about, the added herbs are unique, bright and spicy but ultimately won't set this one apart from any other saison. Sessionable, available and a safe addition to the Stone lineup in time for summer."

"Overall (4.0): What the eff, Stone. Sometimes all people talk about is “do something other than hops for once, Stone, make a non-IPA for once, Stone.” Well, you did with this beer, and guess what? It doesn’t suck. In fact, it’s pretty damn good. This beer has a nice level of complexity: multiple distinct components, nothing clashing, nothing overwhelming, nothing muted. Personally I found the appearance somewhat lacking after the head died down, but the aroma, taste, and feel were all really, really good. Some self-professed purists will claim that this beer is too sweet (it really isn’t—the sweetness is moderate at best, but that’s just my opinion), some non-purists will be disappointed that it’s not funky, tart, or musty, and some newbies will drink it too damn cold, but in my opinion this is an excellent beer. It’s more or less a classically Belgian-leaning, non-funky saison that manages to TASTEFULLY incorporate some interesting ingredients that never clash. I’m very pleasantly surprised by this beer, and very pleased that Stone’s put a slightly-more-affordable saison in sixers. Very happy with this!"
