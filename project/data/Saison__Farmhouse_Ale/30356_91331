The mix of funk, body, drinkability, and complex mixture of bread, fruit, and vinous character make for a dynamic beer that’s easy for anyone to enjoy. I love this beer, but I sure do wish it didn’t cost $10 a bottle. Ah, well . . . and occasional pleasure, I suppose. But at least it gives me something to shoot for when judging other, similar beers, and hopefully the type of beer I brew in the future. Thanks, Prairie! I’ll definitely be pulling the tigger on your brews more often now.","fmccormi","Mar 15, 2015"

Massively doughy and grassy; flowery, white grape, white peach, pear, coriander-ish perfumey. Taste: pear, pineapple-ish (where the tiny bit of acidity ties in well), white peach, a little grapeskin, doughy back. A little chalky otherwise pillowy feel, medium bodied. Fruit forward is an understatement. It's good, although gets a bit sweet by the end of the bottle even for 500 ml.","babaracas","Mar 09, 2015"

There's also a good amount of lacing. The brew smells like bready malt, yeast, grass/hay, pears, funk and some lemon peel. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some green grapes/white wine and some citrus. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's crisp and also well carbonated. The soft carbonation helps make this brew very smooth and easy to drink. 'Merica is a pretty good brew, I certainly liked it.

4.06,-1.2,3,4.5,4,4,4,"Got in a trade with cyde. 750 ml bottle into tulip glass, 2013 vintage bottling. Pours moderately hazy bright golden straw color with a 1-2 finger foamy white head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin ring of lacing. Minimal lacing on the glass, and some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of huge peach, pineapple, mango, passion fruit, grape, lemon zest, orange zest, straw, floral, grass, pepper, clove, herbal, cracker, light honey, white wine, light funk, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with awesome complexity of big tropical/citrus hop and yeast/brett ester notes with moderate malt balance; and great strength. Taste of big peach, pineapple, lemon zest, grape, passion fruit, clove, pepper, straw, grass, floral, herbal, cracker, light honey, white wine, light funk, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Good amount of fairly tart/earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of peach, pineapple, lemon zest, grape, passion fruit, clove, pepper, straw, grass, herbal, floral, white wine, cracker, light funk, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of hop, malt, and fruity/spicy yeast and brett flavors; with a good malt/spiciness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and moderately prickly mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice saison style. All around good balance and complexity of hop, malt, and fruity/spicy yeast/brett ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 20, 2013"

Dry, earthy and bitter up front with peppery spice, earthy resinous hops and musty bugs followed by funky saison yeast, bread, biscuit and light fruit. Lots sticky, oily hop flavor up front with pine needle, grass and spruce tip along with a very prominent dry, musty brett character that's faintly countered by sweet citrus/tropical fruit, bread, biscuit, apple and pear. A bit one dimensional with all of the dryness from the hops and brett but there is subtle sweetness and a strong bready yeast component balancing things out. Some pineapple and grapefruit hop flavor buried underneath but overall, this beer is just a bit too dry/one note for my preference. Complex for sure, but the dry hops and brett and prominent bready yeast notes overpower almost everything else.","corby112","Oct 23, 2013"

I give most of the credit to their yeast strain: it produces an excellent Saison/Farmhouse ale that would give most other Saison's a run for their money. I really only have two complaints: 1) the taste is a bit too hoppy for my taste. I'd dial down the IBU's by 5 or so. 2) I wish the hop was more fruit-forward than grass-forward.

There is a mild amount of Brett bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel.

4.71,14.6,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.75,"Sooo good. Pale, slightly hazy light yellow (nearly a white ale) with a generous billowing white head. Hops and yeast dominate the nose. Citrusy Nelson Sauvin hops and spicy notes from the yeast make a great first impression. First taste lives up to the smell. The single pale malt lets the hops really be king, with the yeast a close second. Refreshing citrus and pine notes are nicely complemented by hints of spice and funk from the yeast. Every drink is as good as the one before. This is a perfect example of the virtues of simplicity in brewing- more brewers ought to follow this lead. Simply beautiful. My only complaint is that I paid $9 for a 500ml bottle, slightly higher than I think is justified.","jlisuk","Sep 07, 2013"

Nice tartness with lemon and grapefruit bitterness leading into the herbal lemongrass and peppery yeast notes. Moderate to high carbonation lets the full body feel nice and light on the tongue.

The combination of pilsener-like flavors up front and musty dryness in back is tough to beat. I like the very faint funkiness and appreciate that it contributes to, rather than dominates, the flavor. Definitely a beer worthy of repeated visits.","deadonhisfeet","May 04, 2013"

4.45,8.3,4,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Pours a pale orangish yellow, straw color. The beer is quite cloudy. The head puffs up into quite a mass at first, but it proves to be rather fizzy and dissipates quickly. Pretty much no bubbles are left at a minute, and there's no lacing. The aroma is chock full of Nelson Sauvin hops. It's wonderfully and fresh and juicy. I'm getting grape, melon and pineapple flavors primarily with peach, orange, lime, mint, mango and grass adding to the mix. It's a tremendous hop aroma. Underneath all of that hop fruitiness, there's a touch of yeasty, earthy funk. It doesn't hit you in the face like the hops, but the beer is definitely in saison/farmhouse territory when you look for the yeast flavors. Just a touch of soft honey-ish malt. The taste is starts off with sweet fruitiness and more of that honeyed pale malt before developing a firm bitterness of lime rind, lemon/grapefruit pith and earth. There's a spicy, herbal edge of juniper, mint, peppercorns and earl grey bergamot. The yeast dries out the beer and shows off some of that funky prairie flavor, but it's not the focus of this beer. This beer is a celebration of the Nelson Sauvin hop. I absolutely love Alpine Nelson and Keene Idea, but while a rather different take, 'Merica can stand with those beers as the best expression of the hop that I've tried. Mouthfeel is lively with lots of hop oiliness. The finish is drying and the bitterness lingers for some time. This is a wonderful beer. My only slight knock on it is that I think the malt flavor could use a little tweak, maybe a touch of wheat. Regardless, Prairie has proven themselves as a brewery to watch with a second round of excellent releases. I'm thrilled that they have wide distribution and look forward to more beers from them.","popery","Apr 14, 2013"

4.11,0,3.75,4.5,4,4,4,"A showcase for Nelson Sauvin hops to be sure. The complexity born from the simplicity of a SMaSH beer is pretty amazing. That said, I guess a small complaint would be that the pungency of the hops completely overwhelms any of the subtle nuance that might have been gained from the floor-malted pils. Still a really enjoyable beer and another great effort from Prairie.","bump8628","Mar 17, 2013"
