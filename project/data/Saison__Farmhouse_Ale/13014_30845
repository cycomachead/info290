Certainly not the most wild Saison I've had, but it's a very, very good example of one and one that is super drinkable. If it weren't for the price (and the fact Surly doesn't distribute to Michigan...), I'd make this a go-to Saison. Delicious.","Alextricity","Aug 29, 2014"

3.85,-3.3,,,,,,"Gotta thank VDubb for allowing me to finally try this stuff out.  It pours a mostly clear brass-gold topped by a finger or so of white foam.  The nose comprises mild clove, black pepper, Belgian yeast, light sourdough, and a touch of dried honey.  The taste brings in more of the same, along with a bit of grass and flowers for the sake of it.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish.  Overall, a pretty solid saison (or whatever they're calling it nowadays), especially from cans.  'Nuff said.","TMoney2591","Aug 21, 2014"

Apricots, pears, and some other light fruits are present in this one, but what's great about this beer is that it's NOT sweet, it's kinda peppery!

Don't expect anything super complex, however - this drinks far more like a Belgian pale ale or a lowly pilsner, at the end of the day. It definitely wouldn't be a bad option for me if I had it at a bar or something, but with so many far more complex and intriguing saisons out there, as well as those that are equally refreshing, this does feel a bit lost out at sea overall.","magictacosinus","Mar 02, 2014"

C’mon, don’t we all wish we could get saisons as such?) . . . good for them, I say, and I wish other breweries (ahem, Sixpoint) would follow suit. As for the beer, in my opinion it was slightly too phenolic (the herbal qualities were not always flattering), and could use more spice and hops to help balance the malt (not that it was a particularly malty saison in any way, but still). But, undoubtedly, a good saison that performs better slightly warmer, as fits the style. Glad to have tried.","fmccormi","Jun 30, 2013"

4,0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a clear golden color with a small-medium white head that disappears quickly. Scent is wow... not what I was expecting. Now that I read about this beer...a saison??? In a can??? If anyone can do it, it's Surly I suppose. Smells somewhat similar to a saison, but with a strang malt liquor aroma. There is the black pepper, spiciness, and Belgian yeast aromas of a good saison... not much funk though. However, this strange malt liquor aroma is somewhat off-putting. Taste is a little better. Luckily, it does not taste like malt liquor. It does taste like a saison. A great saison??? No. The pepper and spiciness is there. The light fruitiness and Belgian yeast flavors are there. A ton of floral flavors. It lacks the funk and has some strange flavors that I've never got from any saison/farmhouse ale before. As it warms...I'm starting to get that malt liquor profile in my mind again. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied, with a spicy, tingly finish. Drinkability is high. Overall, I didn't see ""saison"" anywhere on the can. So, there is a possibility Surly wasn't even trying to create a saison. Regardless, this is a very tasty beer. An AMAZING fizzy yellow beer (hence the title)... a mediocre saison.","DovaliHops","Dec 01, 2012"

White pepper and clove with a little Belgian yeast tang/funk. Earthy undertones. On the palate, this guy slides right in. Floral spicy notes up front. Some mild fruity esters (pear and apple) from the yeast with pine and earth underneath. Some cracked grains through the middle leading to a dry finish of spice and floral/earthy hops. Light to medium body, good feel. This is a fairly straightforward saison. The flavors all work well together, good body, the carbonation is a little too high, but never really gets in the way. Solid across the board. Will gladly have this guy in my glass again.","ColForbinBC","Nov 30, 2012"

The smell of the beer has some subtle fruit and spice notes to it, there is an aroma of fresh grain as well with a mellow sweetness. The taste of the beer is light, refreshing and doesn't really show it's true colors till the aftertaste. The settling flavors of the earthy hops and the black pepper notes shine bright. The mouthfeel is crisp, smooth and clean feeling, leaving behind some stickiness in the mouth afterward.

It is round and soft, it is fruity, slightly musty, and has some bubblegum, banana and clove. Very yeast driven flavors with some hop bitterness and flavor, citrus flavor. Dry, but sadly just not dry enough for the style. A good beer for sure, but it is such a hard style and a saturated style too. I'd seek it out again, and soon.","pmlondrigan","Aug 25, 2011"

4.32,8.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Mmmm, hits most of the right spots for a saison; grainy, grassy and bready. This is the best American-brewed saison I have ever had! It is missing some farmhouse that I find so appealing in a Saison DuPont, and of course to a greater degree Fantome, but damn....this is as close as you can get without going open fermentation here in the states. Surly has cranked out some of the best beers I have had, and deserve to be ranked amongst the elite brewers in America. Most impressive, young jedi.","twiggamortis420","Jun 29, 2011"
3.91,-1.8,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"O- Good example of the style. This isn't on the level of DuPont or anything like that, but if given the chance I would buy this over and over. Very pleasing and well rounded with a lot of complexity- just how I love my saisons...","TheGordianKnot","Jun 26, 2011"

4.02,1,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Pours a lightly hazed gold color with faint orange touches, big frothy bubbly head, long lasting. Scent is bold fresh baked bread, yeasty with herb and peppery spice notes, touches of light watery floral fruit peeks through. Taste is a big punch of yeast and spice, as tongue adjusts the notes of grain, herbs, watery fruit, flower poke through. Only thing missing is the earthy and funky notes i prefer in the style - in the end it compares in profile to some other belgian styles. Body is tremendously creamy for the style with faint graininess, active carbonation subsides quickly - maybe a bit too quickly, dry and lingering pepper and yeast notes. Very nice beer - bold with some original qualities.","rfgetz","Jun 21, 2011"
4.3,8,4,4,4.5,5,4,"O: A really nice brew that I think treads the line between saison and Belgian pale ale -- it has the fruity, lightly funky character of both styles with a tiny bit of peppery flavor to push it a little more toward saison.

3.96,-0.5,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"o: I could have 10 of these in a row based solely on the feel and how easily it would quench my thirst. The tartness is mild and welcome, though I think I could only take down about 2 of these before wanting something with more flavor to it. A good way to stay cool on a hot summer day, but lacks that pop from the spices despite a nice rich flavor from the tart fruits inside.","Preismj","Jun 06, 2011"
3.92,-1.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a clear light orange-yellow with a 1 inch off-white head that fades to a thin cap. Random chunks of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smells of grains, spices, and Belgian yeast. Taste is exactly like the smell with the Belgian yeast taking prominence and the grain and spice flavors coming through on the finish. Reading the can I see that the hops are supposed to impart apricot/peach flavors and I do get them if I search for it. Beer has a good level of carbonation but seems a tiny bit flat. Very smooth in the mouth. Overall, this is a good beer from Surly but not one of my favorite styles. I am glad I got to try this one.","UCLABrewN84","Jun 06, 2011"
4.46,12.1,3,4.5,5,3,4.5,"Poured into my surly pint glass courtesy of theduderules. Pours a apple juice color with a little head that dissipates almost instantly. The aroma is great, Belgian yeast, fruity and a little funk. Taste is amazing, everything from the nose only intensified and a peppery finish. Mouthfeel is nice, smooth with moderate carbonation. This is a great saison, if I lived in surly land, this would be a regular in my rotation.","jcartamdg","Beers"

Wouldn't really accompany this with any food IMO, maybe some light cheese","alf212","0"
3.85,-3.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"The mouthfeel is fuller and more lucious than most Saisons I have had recently. The carbonation also is not as in your face like most tradional Belgian examples yet still finishes crisp and on the dryer side.

Not trying to be lazy, but smells like a saison beer with no overwhelming scents coming through. Taste is much better than the smell. Some great sweet fruitiness with some spice and yeast in the mix, with a little funky flavor. Mouth is all about the carbonation which is quite nice.

4.03,1.3,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,"O-> I liked this beer, I really did. It is very good representation of the style and brings a lot to the table in the way of flavor. Not sure if being in the can for 5 or 6 weeks (whichever it actually is) had any effect on the aromas or the taste, but I certainly expected more in the aroma department from Surly. That being said, the taste of this brew more than made up for the smell. Chalk up another success for Surly Brewing!","Fluke828","Apr 22, 2011"

4.32,8.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours a hazy golden yellow with a thick foamy white head. Head settles into about a 1/4 inch thick and persists throughout. Aroma is pretty spot on for the style; yeast spice, lemon zest, apples & apricots, some horseblanket funk. Pale, grainy malts in the nose as well. Flavor follows the nose; grainy & bready, slightly funky, bright & fruity. Finishes with a peppery, yeasty funk. Can't get enough of this brewery (and this beer). Well put-together saision.","muttyd","Apr 18, 2011"

3.88,-2.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"From a can into glass, just like they told me to do. Pour results in a full bone-colored head topping a clear, golden-colored beer with active carbonation. The aroma is of oats and yeast. Complex and spicy at the outset, it mellows beautifully with each drink. It's pretty aggressive for a Saison, though I did enjoy it with my meal. It's smooth and eminently drinkable. Overall, if you're not looking for the subtle Saison, you would be very happy to have it as a table beer.","ActualAir","Mar 28, 2011"

A bready yeast with clove and coriander fade to horse blanket, which rounds out the flavors. Feels light and crisp with the medium to high carbonation I'd expect.

The good thing was that it netted me two fingers of eggshell-white head with decent retention. Color was a golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. I definitely got the peach and apricot notes. I reversed the order from the notes on the CAN because it seemed peachy up front with the apricot a lighter scent. I was reminded of O'Fallon's Wheach, actually. Mouthfeel was medium with a riot of flavors in the mouth and on the tongue. The honey flavor was immediate, followed by a fruity mix and then the black pepper kicked in, especially on the finish. Wow! What a wild ride! Omar & Co. need not worry about Greg Koch & Co. taking them to task for making ""a fizzy yellow beer"" because this was NOT for sissies.

In fact, I think it nails the style dead on and retains some soul and personality. Burnt gold with a white head that holds and leaves nice ace. Nose is... Wow- the french barley is really nice. Very husky and mildly toasty with a touch of whole wheat-like sweetness, but delicate at the same time. For those looking for funk, this isn't the one, but the mixture here really paints a picture of a sunny farmhouse lot; the hops adding some serious flower and fruit (mainly peach, but apricot and plucot too?), and the yeast adds a very subtle (and much less peppery than some) spiciness. it is so well balanced, it seems like the smell might be peach blossomy, but it's not, it's peach and wildflowers and earthiness and the seperate flavors are distinct yet not muddy at all. Really a great american saison, and like I said, nails it for the style. He must have read phil's book. Surly is creating some of America's best beers for sure.

Has an earthy taste but I first noted the spiced, peppery taste from the yeast. It's got a light malty sweetness but strong citrusy flavors.

Pours a nice burnt orange color, a little bit darker than I usually expect from a saison. A nice sized, slightly off white head forms and lingers for a minute before largely disappearing and leaving behind a disappointing lack of lacing. The smell is a wonderful blend of biscuity malts and yeast goodness. A few sips bring a taste that largely mirrors the nose, with a little bit of a lingering hop bitterness that seems out of place. The mouthfeel is probably the highlight of this beer, there's the normally slightly prickly carbonation I find in a saison, but there's also a creaminess that takes it to another level. I can't say it's my favorite saison (that would be fresh Jack D'or), but CynicAle is a damn good beer.","axeman9182","Beers"

4.02,1,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Pours a kind of deep golden color, moving a bit towards orange. The head is huge, rocky, and the bubbles pop up and leave giant caverns. The beer is hard to see through - I don't think it's that hazy, but the bubbles move so fast its hard to see through it. The head falls down, leaving only a bit of lacing. The smell is very grainy, pilsener malt, a tiny bit of sugar, but not sweet, and I'd bet there are other grains. A bit of tartness, a little lemon, maybe some acidity. Maybe a tiny bit of earthiness, a little leafiness. I think the taste has all of the good stuff. The taste is a bit tart, a little acidic. No real presence of hops, maybe a bit of the earthiness from Saaz. But every taste has something different in terms of grain. There's the grainy, powdery pilsener malt, the sweet kind of slick feeling of oats, and finish of a little spice. It starts to feel drier eventually, which I like. This one is good. The body is nice, around medium, maybe a little full for the style. But there's a brilliant dryness, which really goes far to compliment the tartness, and the rush of carbonation really carries it all through. No sting, but a pleasant mouthfull. I'd say this is easy to drink, though I think the ABV is a bit higher than I expect for the style. Still I could enjoy this almost any time.","taylorhamrick","Aug 17, 2009"

The mouthfeel is that of a traditional ale. The flavor goes from the gentle banana beginning to giving way to a rush of banana flavor and then a smooth malt finish. Its pretty easy drinking, but way too much banana in my opinion. I haven't really found the saissons that I have tried to have much in common. Eventually I expect that they will be widespread enough to develop some kind of ""theme.""","Ragingbull","Jul 24, 2009"
4.1,3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"A good, drinkable saison. CynicAle pours a bright, copper color with pale white lacing. The aroma is honey, caramel malt and floral hops.

This beer has loads of citrus esters with a slight bit of phenol pepper type twang. The esters linger on through the beer which eventually met by the bittering hops. I don't get very many hop notes in the beer, but the ester flavour is fanstastic. The malt backbone in this beer is quite pleasing and gives just enough sweetness that makes the esters even better.

You wouldn't want to drink your whole four pack in a row, but mostly because this is a beer that should be appreciated. One of the many reasons I love Surly brewing so much is because they have some of the most flavorful beers and remain relatively low in alcohol. I like getting buzzed as much as the next BA but I've come to realize that if they could make something that could taste like this, or any other Surly offering, and it was only 2%ABV I'd drink it just as much, if not more. As far as this brew goes, I highly recommend it. In fact, if you think you may not like Belgian-style ales, definitely try this. I always review objectively but I feared if I give another Surly an A+ I'd come off as a fanboy, but you know what?

It pours a nice light head only a few millimeters with a pungent yeasty smell. Clearly Belgian influenced, with a nice apricot and citrus flavor. I wish I could get this all year round. It has a nice lingering orange peel bitterness that sticks to my pallet. I like the fruitiness too. I disagree with what the can says, it's not Black pepper as much as it is pink peppercorns or maybe a little szechuan pepper. Bitter, sweet, and smooth with a lasting orange flavor. I thinlk improving the aroma with some dry hopping and it's five stars in my book. Maybe the brewers will read this and make a special growler batch that I can come by and pick up.

Scattered lace is left. Body is a glowing honey color. Nose is very fresh and clean with some spicey crisp fruit notes, mellon, honey, vanilla and fresh cut corn stalk. Enters the mouth very mellow and smooth as the flavors slowly develop. Crisp creamy citrus notes, woodsy hops with bitter bite, all rounded out with a even malt profile to balance this brew. Flowery smoothness is all over the body. This is a very smooth and pleasant mouthfeel on the beer.

Yeasty funkiness hits the nose first followed by some hints of orange and lemon peel. Slight malt character in the nose with the typical sour funk of a saison. Flavor is light, lots of sweet malts that turns awfully dry on the finish, some hints of apple cider in the background, bitter rind, and lemon that makes a quick appearance and then disappears. Definitely spicey, with some noticeable black pepper flavors mixed with some clove. Alcohol is present but not overpowering. Somewhat light on the body, medium carbonation and pretty easy to drink, although this style is not one of my favorites.

Malt is a little more pronounced than I remember it from previous tastings, could be because the can is about 6 months old. I love the hops in this beer, they play so nicely with the lighter malt, and the yeast used. That yeast is also one of the highlights of this beer, enough so that there is no doubt that it's a Belgian style, but not enough to overpower the other flavors. A very well balanced beer. It leaves you wanting more and more. Mouthfeel is very good. This is one of my favorite summertime beers cause it's light but extremely tasty.","brewgetter","Mar 21, 2008"

4.03,1.3,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Looks great, pours a big head and there's some lacing. Color is golden. Smell is just you would think a saison would taste like with the farmhouse smells, but then there's also floral aroma hops that make a big hop character. Funky farmhouse with huge hop floral notes that remind me of perfume, then leaves a bitterness on my tongue my lasts a while. Yeah, the hops are very perfumatic with their almost grassy fruity flavors. Mouthfeel is full and smooth, very good medium-full bodied beer. Overall I like it, but something in the hop character makes it a once in a while beer instead of a ""drink many of them"" beer. I think I just have to get used to grassier hops...especially since it's paired with a Belgian beer profile, I haven't had many of the grassy hop profile beers. Just read Surly's website and they imported some new hops for fruity character, so that's the perfume hops I must be smelling.","Erdinger2003","Feb 24, 2008"

Peppery yeastish wheat on the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is on the thick side, and carbonation is strong. Very drinkable saison, but maybe this is just the psychological effect of the can.

Flavor is quite good, a touch of sweetness up front conveying the fruity stone fruit notes, mixed with black pepper and coriander. The sweet side quickly gives way to a long, tar, hoppy finish, with lingering bitterness. This bitterness ovverwhelms when the beer is cold, but integrates better as is warms, permitting the peppery and fruity notes to peep through. Although I appreciate the dryness of this beer, somehow that white grapefruit pith bitterness just hits a little to hard for me--but much better than erring on the sweet side.

Somewhat spicy taste, backed by a floral hop mix. Some grassy elements, with hints of fruit mixed in as well. A pretty dry brew, medium bodied. I've been hearing some good things about this brewery, and this beer leaves me wanting to try the rest. I'm sure everyone else has talked about the can, so I will spare you.","Tballz420","Aug 16, 2007"

4.17,4.8,4,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"First taste of Surly, and I am excited to try it. Pours from the 16 oz can into my pint glass a hazy orange color with thick white head that dies down to leave a thin white covering on top of this one. Smell is of spices, pepper, and coriander come through strong. Taste is remarkable smooth with pepper dominating followed by the other spices and a slight hop punch. Carbonation is slim, so the flavors are able to be enjoyed sip after sip. First taste is a good sign of great things to come.","genog","Aug 14, 2007"
4.77,19.8,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Pours hazy golden amber with some nice tan head that disappears with little to no lacing. Smells of citrus, earthy undertones, tea, little hop and many different nice spices. Smells like a tasty saison! A burst of spicy malt, citrus, butterscotch, molasses and lemon. Everything shows up quite nicely and nothing is overdone. Very light in the mouth, little carbonation and a very subtle bite at the end that sits on the tongue. I think this brew is underrated since its so different from the hop filled siblings from Surly but to be honest its still a one of kind brew. Could drink this for days. Well done Surly, after tasting your three mainstays Im considering moving to Minnesota.","franksnbeans","Aug 12, 2007"
4.69,17.8,4,5,4.5,4.5,5,"Cynic Ale will turn even the most jaded cynic into a true believer. On the strength of four amazing beers, Surly has vaulted into a permanent place in my top-10 breweries of all-time. Believe the hype.","BuckeyeNation","Jul 27, 2007"
4.8,20.6,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Got in a trade with Faro - many thanks! Poured from a 16oz can (yes a can - get over it) with cool artwork and a blurb about the beer into my NBB snifter. It was a slightly hazy golden honey color. It really didn't have much of a head but I think I poured it a little too cold still since not used to judging temps in a can by touch like I can with a bottle. What little there was settled into a thin collar with no lacing. One thing I did miss with the can was the pop of the cork that you usually get with a saison due to all the carbonation. This one didn't pop at all and really no carb visible in the glass. Not sure if that is due to the can or maybe the sample was off a little. Either way it still smelled and tasted great. The aroma was spicy with black pepper and fruity with apricot and something else I couldn't identify. You could smell the dryness that was to come in the taste. The taste was classic saison with a fruity start that is followed by a sharp bite of spice. Great balance between the two. Mouthfeel was just a tad watery for a saison but still good. Overall, a really great beer that I highly recommend especially if you are into saisons. Glad I was able to acquire it and will have to seek out some more. (4.5, RR, T, Y)","TexIndy","Jul 24, 2007"

4.2,5.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Cynic Ale pours a yellow-orange with a white/off-white head. The aroma is very reminiscent of Belgian beers like Duvel Golden Ale. The taste also reminds me of Duvel, but with a subtle smoothness found in beers made with oats. Hops are present, but much more noticeable at the end of the taste. The mouthfeel is good with the oaty-smoothness mentioned above. This beer is very drinkable, but at 6.7% abv, I wouldn't drink more than two at a time. Cynic Ale is definitely a beer to try if you can get your hands on it.","slyke","Jul 11, 2007"
4.45,11.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"This brew pours a clear reddish-bronze color. The head is small, but long lasting. The aroma is of peppers, spices, yeast, apricot, and pears. I really like the abundance of pepper. The taste is a lot like the aroma; pepper and spice rounded out by apricot and pear. Bitterness is moderate, but firm in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is another fine beer from Surly. I cannot say I like it as much as Furious or Bender, but I would certainly drink it again.","KarlHungus","Jul 10, 2007"

3.93,-1.3,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Pours a burnt foggy orange with nice fluffy two finger head that slowly dies down to a nice lacing. Stickiness is here and there, pretty good. Smell is of mild yeast with a nice spice zing to it. A good pepper scent tingles the nose as well. Decent, but I've smelt very similar. Taste starts off with a powerful carbonated bang of a metallic yeast and is quickly overtaken by an acidic coriander spice. Ends with a bready malt that pleases the tongue. Good, but once again...not unique. Mouthfeel is light bodied with a good amount of carbonation, perfect for the style. Pretty good drinkability, I could follow this one up with another.","BeerTruth","Jul 07, 2007"
4.37,9.8,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Couldn't wait to sample this on tap. It was a one week wait as it sat in the keg cooler until we had a line for it. The wait was well worth it. Poured in a pint glass from the tap is a must try for anyone. It has good appearance, and a great aroma. That little peppery taste I get is something I have grown to like.","boochmonkee","Beers"
3.78,-5,4,3.5,4,3,4,"Overall: If you're judging this to style, it's not even close. That being said, this might be my favorite Surly offering to date. Where the hoppiness in their other brews can be overwhelming, here it seems to balance the spiciness of the Saison. I would've never thought of it, but it works. Go figure.","Windigstadt","0"

Body is quite full with some medium filtration and some good carbonation.

Some other fruits in the background. (Apricot?) Fresh yeastiness. Intriguing... Very unique taste. Peppery spicy. Mango like fruitiness. Dried apricots. Slight hop bitterness. Leathery finish. But also dry, hoppy and as quick as the crack of a whip. Nicely carbonated and refreshing feel. Light-medium body. I could see kicking back of a few of these tall boys on the golf course. Or with some grilled salmon steaks.","Bighuge","Jun 17, 2007"

The taste at first gave me the same toasted malts (bread like) with a touch of apricot at the end. This beer will be in my fridge all summer long right next to the Furious and Bender (my Surly triple play) extremely good, extremely drinkable. Another home run for Omar, Todd and the rest of the Surly crew.","mnstorm99","Jun 10, 2007"

3.45,-13.3,4,4,3,3.5,3.5,"Hmm seems a little thin on flavor and one dimensional. Nice hoppy backbone melds well with the chewy malt mid palate. Dominated by belgian yeasty quality, white pepper, honey suckle, and other spicey, herbacious qualities, some fruit backing of lemon and peach but not much else. Mouth is thin and bitter on the finish. A little dissapointed in this brew as the others I've tried have been top notch.","mcallister","Jun 05, 2007"

4.38,10.1,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Had several glasses of this at the brewery. Omar said that there were only a few kegs left! Too bad. Lovely hazy candy orange-glazed body with a thick, frothy white head. Looks great! Nose is sweet, almost worty, with prominent yeastiness. Some Belgiany sugar, and spiciness as well. Perhaps a touch too worty. But it tastes better. Sweet, candi-sugarish malt with a full-bodied, coating feel. Nice. Spicy, yeasty kick with rounded, spicy bitterness makes for a refreshing finish. MY kind of summer seasonal, as there's a slightly warming alcohol complexity to this. Give me more!","alexgash","Jul 10, 2006"
4.23,6.3,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I don't know how they do it. All the Surly beers I have tasted are an almagamation of styles, yet they taste excellent. This beer is no exception. It pours a pleasing amber color with a small white head and some lacing on the glass. The smell is somewhat fruity. The taste-where to begin? One can taste a fruity peach-apricot flavor, along with hints of a plum brandy-like flavor as well as a tart green apple taste. Somehow all the various flavors blend into an exciting whole. The mouthfeel is rich and tasty.This doesn't taste anything like the Belgian saisons I have tried, but Surly makes that a strength rather than a weakness. A terrific beer, whatever the style!","edbeered","Jul 06, 2006"

Flavor begins with corriander and spicey belgian yeast flavor. Moves to a nice firm and sweet malt base and then ends with a bitter hops kick. Its not as light or delicate as the best saisons, but this one's a different breed. Definately not your traditional saison. Surly is a very appropriate name.","tempest","Jun 01, 2006"
