"Not too tart, but pleasent"

"O: 4.25 Great drinking beer with plenty of interesting things going on while remaining refreshing and easy to drink. Takes some of my favorite elements of a saison and matches them with the flavors and aromas typical of a dry-hopped sour."

"Overal i enjoy it very much. First crooked stave"
"Bottle poured into tulip. Hazy orange-yellow with soapy white head that leaves streaks of lacing. Aroma brings brett funk, green oak, tart citrus and grapes, and light malt. Flavors are tart citrus, barnyard funk, oaky bitterness, and earthy throughout. Medium body, thin texture, moderate-high carbonation, and a dry finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is very similar to the nose. Starts with mildly tart lemon juice with some nice oak, moving through notes of funk, and a smooth, bready finish with very subtle notes of coriander or spice and lingering citrus. Seems at least a little under-carbed, but I would probably guess that's the age at play."
""
""
"Nice lemon sour tasting saison. Faint taste of oak barrel. Very well done saison. Wish I could get this on the regular"
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall:  My first Crooked Stave, two things come to mind.  Three Lions was more than honest in saying phenomenal and two where has this beer been all my life?"
"Kudos."

"Really nice, interesting, and super tart and funky saison. Great flavor for such a low ABV offering."

"Slightly hazy straw colored beer with a small white topping that fades rather quickly to a finely bubbled ring and thin patch at the center. Aroma is farmy flowers and barnyard hay scents plus country apples, acidic and sweet, woody, and gose-esque with a touch of something salty-like. Taste is tart and dry with light acidity, apple, white wine maybe, wood musk, and flowers. A bit mouthwatering with each sip. Texture is clean and fluid.. Overall very refreshing and pleasant. I could go for some more."
"Mostly clear straw yellow color with minimal head forming on the surface.  Aroma is quite funky...barnyard Brett, flowers, lemon/lime, and musty oak.  Nicely flavorful and Bretty without being aggressive with the yeast.  Tart white wine fruitiness, flowers, grass, lemon, and woody spice.  There seems to be a slight saline quality too that adds to the refreshment.  Light, slick, and dry, finishing a little watery.  Definitely a nice experience, though way too expensive to drink as much as I'd like."

"In love with this beer.  Poured a little cloudy with tons of fluffy sticky white head.  Brett and pepper on the nose.  Gloriously dry pretty body with saison character and some oak. A stellar beer. I wish I could access this beer more readily."
""

"Thought it was rather plain"

" The taste is very lemonywith pineapple sour and slight astringent taste with bretty funk and light medicinal aspect mid palate with grapefruit in the taste which is lightly acidic. The intensity of sourness is lingering after the finish. This is interesting and drinkable for the style -a very tasty session strength saison"

"I am nit picking, but the soapy hop character is just a slight detractor.  Outside of that, an excellent tart Saison and one I wish I could get more easily."

"Overall a really nice, earthy, complex, flavorful saison."

"2013 Batch 8. Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is a bright, hazy, gold coloring, with a solid halo of bright white head. Aromas of toasted grains and honey forward, with notes of vanilla, basil, cilantro, butterscotch, and grass. Flavors are toasted grain  and cereal forward, with a tart and tangy citrus blend to follow. Lemon and tangerine help kick up the sweetness, followed by an herbal blend of basil, all spice, subtle pepper, and lemon grass. Some astringent and medicinal notes in there, as well as subtle wood spice characteristics. The body is effervesced and extremely dry, giving the beer a dry white wine feel in mouth. The aftertaste has a sour overtone, with citrus and herbal spices lingering shortly. The finish is crisp and dry, and the carbonation helps to clean the palate quickly. Interesting brew."
"Mouthfeel left a pucker as it was like sucking on a lemon and then licking wet cardboard, but that’s to be expected from this kind of beer. It was a very light beer, almost watery with mild carbonation, and considering the high bitterness and sourness it went down easier than it should have. Overall it was good and I’d try it again, but it wouldn’t be a “go to” beer for me."

"Tasted a little watered down/weak...but that is what you get with a 4.2 beer...it was still tasty"
""
""
"O: While this is only the third Crooked Stave beer I've had, they've shown themselves to be more than capable of making a great brew. This one is well made and flavorful."
""
""
""
""
"O: This would be a good thirst quenching beer for a hot summer's day.  Lacks a bit in the complexity department to rate higher and perhaps justify the price.  Still, a quality sour."
""
""
""

"Mouthfeel: Very Dry"

"Light colored farmhouse ale with multifaceted funk and prevalent lemon overtones."

"375 poured into a leffe 25cl glass. Hazy or age with nice whit head which fades quickly. Smell is dank barnyard with some citrus and hay. Taste is great very tart with light dry funkiness. Mouthfeel is effervescent but thick. Lingering tartness.  This is what I'm looking for in a saison. Complex and enticing,  delicious."
""
""
"Overall: Really good beer. Lots of flavor, super refreshing and a pretty good value for a barrel aged beer."
"A fairly solid, if slightly un-exciting, funky saison."
"The flavor follows with that strong tart lemon juice, a hint of funk, slight breadiness, and is dry as a bone on the backend. A good mouthfeel for the ABV and highly refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
"375 ml bottle.  Served in a Prairie Teku glass, the beer pours a hazy gold color with about an inch white head.  Both the head retention and lacing are good.  The brew smells like lemon peel, earthiness, hay, limes, and oak.  Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of some tropical fruit, peppery spice, grainy/bready malt and green apple.  The tartness comes out more as the brew warms.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's refreshing and has a good amount of soft carbonation which helps make it smooth and easy to drink.  I liked this a lot, overall I thought it was good.  This was the first Crooked Stave beer I've tried, and hopefully I'll try more soon!  $8.99 a bottle."

"Tasty, tart, lots of barnyard and funk. Yeast is crazy. Reminds me of brie... with that almost ""footy"" thing going on, especially on the nose, but also pretty evident in the finish, which is long. Speaking of cheeses... I get a bit of bleu cheese here, too. Along with hay, and lamb's wool. Meyer lemon, or maybe preserved lemon. In the back, there's a little acetone (nail polish remover), faint and blended in very well into everything else, confusing the senses and confounding some of the other flavor notes, but not in a bad way... like that one cord that kind of both disrupts, but pulls together a piece of music. The oak is also subtle and mixes things up, but in a good way. I wouldn't have guessed oak. Very interesting brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- it's hard to think of another beer similar to this one. On the nose it seems like many funky, Brett beers but the mouthfeel and moderate tartness make this one entirely unique. A very enjoyable drinking experience all around."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is too much like a Belinerweiss to be reviewed adequately as a Saison. I also object to the price of this stuff. But if you're into trying sours, this is very approachable. From the 375 ml bottle purchased at Grapevine Liquors. Batch 10/2014."

"O: A very respectable and unique saison. It is well worth trying for fans of the style."
""
""
"O: Easy drinking and refreshing saison. Very enjoyable, but given the price, I was hoping for something a little more special."
""
"O - It makes me think of a Gewurtztraminer. It would be a nice picnic beer for a summer day. It's certainly not bad, just a bit light and flat in character for me."

"Overall, a decent saison, but I can't help if my enjoyment of it was negatively impacted by the fact that I enjoyed Surette so much more. That said, this would be a pretty tasty session saison, or as they were once known: saison."
""
""
""
"O - Great flavor with a bellow average mouthfeel for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly cloudy medium golden capped by a fluffy one and a half finger bright white head. Above average retention, traces of thin lacing. Earthy yeast, light accents of oak, hints of lemon and hay on the nose. Very light lemon, hay, and plenty of earthiness and funk. More light slightly sweet citrus midpalate. Finishes bone dry with continued light citrus, earthiness, and rounded out by wet oak notes. Light body, lively carbonation, slick and smooth mouthfeel. A wonderful sessionable saison. Recommended."
""
"I'm not surprised this is tasty. The sour notes, Brett funk, and light fruit notes are quite good. It's light and refreshing, and it's more of an entry level than some other Crooked Stave offerings."
"So easy and light. Must drink all summer."
""
""
"Balanced out mix of Saison spicy, citrusy yeast and Bretty straw funk."
""
"An easy-drinking Saison with a nice tart personality."
"O: A nice funky saison with a good oak presence and awesome drinkability. A bit pricey but it's a good take on the style that mixes it up a little"

"A really tasty brew with lots of complexity - hats off to the brewery for pulling this off at just 4% ABV."
"Bottle from Bottle Barn in Santa Rosa. Pours clear yellow to light golden colored with a fluffy white head. Brett on the aroma with light citrus and grass, dryness, tart. Flavor is dry citrus and hay, lemon peel, some tart Brett, dry oak, and a slightly dirty wheaty finish. Light bodied with high carbonation. This would be excellent if it weren't for the slight unpleasant finish, but solid overall."
""
""
"Pours a clear, golden/copper color. 1/2 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of citrus, wood, hint of spice, sweet malt, sourness, and a hint of alcohol. Fits the style of a Saison / Farmhouse Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. There is a strong tartness present. Tastes of citrus, yeast, hint of roasted malt, slight sweet malt, sourness, alcohol, and a hint of floral. Overall, good appearance, aroma, blend, body, and complexity."
""
"O: Great beer for a spring day. I paired it with some grilled chicken with a jerk rub and it was perfect."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I could drink this again, because that smell is just so fantastic. But the high carb makes a sipper. Still pretty refreshing though."
""
"Light golden in color with a bit of cloudiness. Not much at all in the way of foam. Brussels lacing. Oak and Chardonnay aroma. Crisp and dry on the palate with moderate carbonation. I get oak and green apples with a slightly tart and acidic finish. This is a very refreshing wild ale."

"O - Overall a good saison with well rounded, balanced flavors."
"Definitely drink this beer at the suggested temperature on the bottle. At a colder temp, this beer had an unpleasant tartness. At the right temp, it had some field-like funkiness with the esters from the Brett shining through. Nice representation of the style, but it didn't justify the price point in my opinion."
"Barrel aged table strength saison? Pours a cloudy amber, one finger thick white head fades quickly to a thin ring. Smell: doughy, light stone fruit, woodsy, herbal and lemon notes. Taste: tart peach, spicy and herbal, lightly grainy backing, drying finish with light oaky aspect. Very enjoyable."
"the taste is clean, and I like the reference to ""peach yogurt"" by someone else. still cant get over the blatant mis-labeling of this one but it's still a very fine beverage."
"Real easy drinking saison and full of flavor. Real nice."
""
""
""
"Overall pretty nice, good saison bit seems to be missing much of the funk."
"Atmosphere is really nice. Golden hue, fair head, and some spotty lacing. Fragrant fruit and bread components in the nose. Lightly bitter, sweet, and tart flavors of fermented fruit. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
""
""
""
"Verdict: A delicious Saison from Crooked Stave, the oak aging and light tartness really make it a unique and engaging take on the style. It was crisp, easy to drink, and brought along a really nice balance of flavors. I'd love to be able to enjoy this regularly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This is everything a saison should be, just ideal. And amazingly drinkable as most of the standard crooked stave beers are. Amazing how the Brett and/or lacto is integrated just enough to be a nuance to the beer not a dominating factor resulting in a beer I think any beer drinker would enjoy."

"On the fuller end of medium body with crisp, light carbonation and some tart, puckering sourness that lingers over the musty bugs, dry oak, earthy funk, acidic acid and sweeter fruit notes into a dry, acetic finish. Decent amount of tart sourness but could use more acidity. The sourness is cut by some lactic, cheesy funk and dry, toasted oak. Wild bugs contribute to the funk but there's a sweet vinous presence that compliments the bready yeast and ester-y light fruit notes. Almost has a white wine like characteristic mid-palate with some light grape and stone fruit flavor. Hints of grass and straw complimenting the bugs and funky yeast before hints of bread, apple and lemon juice come through in the finish. Citric acidity becomes more prevalent as it warms but it could be a little stronger for my preference. Some lingering acetic acid on the back end but it's not harsh or solvent like. Overall, this is a very interesting and flavorful beer. Kind of like a light American version of gueuze blended with earthy saison notes. Refreshing and easy to drink with complex flavors. Another solid beer from the folks at Crooked Stave."

"O-decent saison, a little on the light side"
""
""

"Nice appearance with a big rocky head of light foam. Not too cloudy, either. Aromas of lemon zest, grapefruit and sweet acidity. A bit of funk from the Brett. Balanced with a smooth contrasting light maltiness and citrus hops. Lively carbonation and refreshing, lightly tart finish. Pretty sour for a saison, but tasty for those who like sours. Beautifully complex, but elegant and drinkable at the same time. Quite well done."
"O/D - Nice stuff. Very easy drinking and good and complex with cool sour elements."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An extremely refreshing, drinkable and traditional complex beer. This is even more alluring since it has more character at 4.2 % abv than other beers nearly double its abv tag. At $9.99 for a 375 ml bottle its a bit high but it is worth every penny for this liquid art."
""
"A great saison in terms of all-around appeal. A loud nose with misleading sweetness, but damn fine flavor."
""
"O: Needs more carbonation, but nice aroma. Easy drinking, refreshing, and enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A fantastically flavorful, refreshing and sessionable saison. Crooked Stave really know how to harness and proportionately distribute the often overwhelming flavors of the wild Brettanomyces yeast strain. Vieille is probably the best modern day take on a Saison done traditionally, i.e. low ABV, and fermented and aged in oak barrels. Recommended."
""
""
"A lovely amber golden cloud. Decent head with a nice lacing. Funky dryness in the nose with notes of pale malt. Taste is more of the same with lots of oak and funk. Feel is crisp and effervescent. Drinkability is determined by you love of sours ales as this one has saison character but really has its feet in the sour camp. Nice beer"
""
""
""
""
"Cloudy amber pour into a CS tulip (thanks again to Corey), with a small creamy white head that receded to a foamy ringlet, leaving a good amount of lacing on the glass. Lots of earthy funk in the nose, notes of wet grass and water-logged oak. More of the grassy funk in the taste, but there's an accompanying tartness, slightly lemony, slightly lacto-ish, complex notes of oak, mineral, and a little green pepper. Fresh and crisp, juicy start with a dry finish, this is one complex saison-wild ale-thing. Medium body, moderate carb, very well-done overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A beautiful, deceiving nose leads one to think they're getting a citrusy, hoppy treat, but the taste is all sour. Quite a treat."

"O - Overall, this is a delicious beer. The mouthfeel really hurts this one for me. The aroma is awesome, the flavour is quite nice, but the watery mouth. Such a shame."
""
""
"o: good stuff. like i said, reminds me of a Fântome just missing some of the funk that is in there. its sweet, spicy, and just a little sour. really refreshing and flavorful"

"O: A beer that has an undeniable club soda character makes for an interesting drink, but not a $10 purchase. Maybe not even a $6 purchase. Nevertheless, Crooked Stave has shown me that they’re willing to mix things up, offering one of the most unique low-alcohol beers I’ve ever had. There’s excellent craftsmanship in this little bottle, and that’s not something that can be overlooked."
""
""
"The beer further recedes as the textures fall from full-on champagne to light and watery in an instant. Though this fuels its highly drinkable character, its earthen and complex aromas promise me a sharp and acidic after-palate that just doesn't develop. Its fleeting finish is watery and minerally- and a little alka-seltzer-like."
""
"O: Great flavors but not as good as I was expecting. I wish it was just a tiny bit fuller. A very good low alcohol beer though."
""
""
""
"M - Light to medium body. Dry. Moderate carbonation."
""
""
"T: We haven't been getting Crooked Stave for very long here in San Diego, but holy schnikes am I glad they're here. This tastes awesome. Opens with brett, lemongrass, hay and some oak. On the backend, there's some lemon like sourness, cucumber, salt and wet grass. A pretty dry finish with an almost dry white wine like sourness that sticks to the palate. I really enjoyed this one."
"o - Overall a very good beer from CS. Lots of brett in the nose and sour white wine and fruit as well. Would certainly have again, just wish their beers were a little bit cheaper."

"Pretty nice Saison. Dry and slightly tart with some good earthy grain and woody notes."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, some nice things going on, but the flavour just isn't working for me overall. I like it, but can't say much more."
""
"Mouthfeel is smooth but nice quite as crisp as I like in a farmhouse ale."
""
""
"O-The lack of a crisp finish and missing funk were the only draw backs, a good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Pretty good, especially for such a sessionable ABV. There are other options that are as good but significantly cheaper. At least cheaper than what I paid."
"Fantastic aromas that combine saison and lambic qualities. Flavor follows with a leaning toward lambic. It's got a fantastic biting tartness from start to finish. I really enjoyed this beer. It's great to see stuff like this coming out of American breweries. I just wish they were closer to home for me."

"Overall, what we liked best about this beer was its aroma. Here we were giving the classic saison, with funk, mustiness, grassiness, crispness, and juicy tartness. While it was somewhat lacking the nose, the oak aging took this experience one step further through the flavoring, and in aiding with dryness and astringency along the feel. The yeast/infectables, too, added that unique “Crooked Stave” twist to the thing, giving a tad more punch to the funk and the tartness throughout. The citric components were also heavily apparent, affording much of the bitterness in the final mix with the yeast. This is a bright, sessionable, experienced beer, and a great example of the style for those looking into it newly, and those who love it, as well."
""
""
""
""
"O – This is a pretty nice saison. It has all the elements of a fantastic beer of this style with grainy wheat, citrus notes, lactic yeast, and lots of Brett. However, with all of these aromas and flavors being present, it lacks the complexity that the great saisons have. Nevertheless, it is tasty and very drinkable. I’m interested to see what the other Crooked Stave beers that I have are like. Thanks for giving me the opportunity to try this one and the others, Jared!"

"Overall: Tasting side by side with Surette, I am afraid this one pales in comparison, though it has a dynamic sourness that may be preferred by others"

"OVERALL: This is an excellent Brett Beer, but my one criticism is that it is not quite what I expect from a saison. The typical banana, clove and other spicy characteristics are completely overpowered by the sour funk. Otherwise, what an outstanding summer beer this is. Another excellent offering from Crooked Stave."
""
""
""
"Taste is of citrus tartness and light grainy maltness of pilsner and wheat. Wonderfully balanced and easy to pair with many food. Super drinkable and refreshing. It's everything an everyday saison should be. I would consume this every day if I could"

"Overall I hate to say I'm not overly impressed given lack of depth and slight watery taste"
"O: I liked this beer because it was easy to drink and had some refreshing qualities while the funk made it interesting. The funkiness in both the smell and taste becomes stronger as the beer warms up."
""
""
""
"Taste is crisp straw malt with a dose of funky barnyard. Nicely dry and fruity. Quite an awesome saison. The way I imagine a saison would have been in old belgium."

"O: Certainly a crisp, funky and sour saison. Not really my style, unfortunately. It's not bad at all, my taste buds just aren't feeling this one today."
"o - overall, glad that i have a bunch more of these coming, but this might be one to amass a ton of and drink constantly this summer. what a crisp refreshing beer. i can only imagine what time will do to this winner. drink em if you got em though since they are fantastic right now."
""
""
""
"Good tart saison. I like to see a little more flavor from the yeast but this is nice."
"Overall the beer is okay. There are hints of acidity, a lot of funk, but the beer is nothing special. It is not very crisp or refreashing and gets too funky as it warms."
""

""
""

"The beer is golden with a soft white head. The aroma offers grain, floral hops, light spice, citrus, grass. Light candied oranges in the flavor. Mild sweetness countered by a touch of funk. Light in body with somewhat low carbonation. Quite enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. It's good, but in a plain way, if that makes any sense. Definitely not worth the price tag (in NYC, $13 for a 12.7 ounce bottle), but if you can find it for a more reasonable price it's definitely a nice sitting-outside kind of beer."

"This second incarnation of the vielle saison from crooked stave lacks the punchy complexity of its forbearer, and really seems like a dumbed down version, although it is still outstanding by most peoples standards of a saison, and in fact, if the first one had never come out, I would probably be raving about this. it pours the same hazy pale hay color as the first one, with some suspended yeast and a big airy white head. the nose is a lot less funky, just a touch of farmhouse really in this one, and more of a cultured French saison yeast profile, with touches of straw and cut grass. the flavor is identical to the nose, but with the bretty funk and complexity of the first one missing entirely here. not unpleasant at all, but just not as lively. some lemon and grassy notes in the finish, but the yeast to me again feels dialed back. good carbonation, bright and drinkable, like all crooked stave beers really, just classic feel. this beers best feature to me. overall a lovely saison, but it pales in comparison to its first edition, that really blew the doors off the genre and represents one of the best ive had. still, this is worth a try if you are new to crooked stave, as the first one aint coming back as far as I know."

"Pours a murky light orange with a foamy white head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, Brett, and yeast aromas. Taste is much the same with a Brett flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and refreshing."
""
"this is a very nice funky saison. i didn't get much of the barrel aging, but the brett was definitely there."
""
""

"Pours a hazy yellowish white with an orange hue and a slight white head. Aroma is kinda MIA, there is some sweetness from the fruity hops and I get a little tart brett, but really its justs messy and indiscriminate. Flavor is the same way, tastes a bit woody. some sweeter citrus, and a maybe some ripe earthy root type vegetables? A hodgepodge of random stuff that is just messy and fails to come together. Mouthfeel is thin and crisp with some slight activity. Overall, this beer is straight up no good, IMO. I LOVED the initial batch/variation and was disappointed when I heard it was not going to be continually offered. That said, I was excited when I heard the tweaks being done to this variation. Unfortunately, what sounded good on paper did not come out to be anything close to being good in real life. I gave this a few tries before I reviewed this one just to make sure it was a consistent problem and not simply one bad bottle, but so far all attempts have fared the same. Of all the Crooked Stave beers to buy a handful of right out of the gate, I wish it hadn't beenthis one. If these beers were cheaper, I honestly would have drain poured some of this."

"O - I really enjoyed this one. I brought home three bottle in my suitcase. Clean, crisp, and really drinkable. Try some, you'll like it."
"This poured out as a hazy yellow color with a soapy white head on top. The lacing was decent with a thin film-like retention on top. The smell of the beer has plenty of fresh oak aromas and tart lemon on the nose. It's also pretty funky. The taste of the beer is decent but a little one dimensional in my opinion. There isn't much depth to this, it's a very clean tasting beer though. The mouthfeel is a bit on the watery side but has a decent carbonation. Overall it's a decent beer but nothing I'd seek out in the future."
"This is apparently a different malt bill than the previous Saison Vielle Artisanal and dry hopped with citra hops. The label is different and I was confused at first as to whether it was really a new beer but I'm adding it. Golden hazy orange color, soapy head. I don't like the smell at all, onion and burned rubber, not good at all. Flavor was ok, grains, yeast, meh. Darn, I was hoping the citra dry hopping would make this something special like Tank 7 or something but I was bored. I also did not pick up on the barrel/foeder aspect at all."
