Bitter hops and earthy yeast flavor cut tartness.  As a multi yeast beer it gets a little too complex to the point where the flavors aren't agreeable.

Powerful aroma full of tart lemony citrus, pineapple, and lemon curd. Taste is similar. Strong lemony component, though the sweetness is toned down while the peppery spice is kicked up. The brett comes off fairly aggressively. Body is on the lighter side of medium with a strong, almost acidic, tartness which I find to be far too aggressive for the style. Still, a very good example of a brett-forward beer.","Florida9","Aug 22, 2014"

The brew smells like yeast, hay, citrus (mostly lemon), pear, bready malt, and peppery spice. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of some bubblegum, minerals, white grapes, and some brett. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's smooth and it's well carbonated. It's a good, lightly tart saison. Certainly worth trying if you've never had it before, it's a good brew.","bluejacket74","Aug 05, 2014"

After quickly getting a glass under the flow, managed a pour, appearing in the glass as opaque hazy straw, almost the color of fresh unfiltered pineapple juice with a massive white head that started to dissipate, but maintained a two finger head with good retention and pillowy lacing. Classic saison aroma of light fruit juice, coriander, wild yeast, peppery and sweet/sour. Flavor is dry dominant brett, light citrus and apple family fruit, hints of caramel, white grape, hints of lemon citrus; finishes very bitter from hops and Brett. Dry, bubbly and reminiscent of champagne (if champagne was brett infused). Fortunately not too sour, but a light tartness that was appealing. Light to medium bodied with bright, active carbonation. Brett forward and far over the amount I would prefer; however it is a credit to this ale that the overall peppery carbonation and otherwise well balanced saison flavors won me over. I like the underlying saison ingredients and if I was a bigger wild yeast fan, I'd probably go crazy over this. A very nicely made and tasty saison on the aggressive brett end of the flavor spectrum. This is one of the rare ales that could eventually win me over to wild yeasts. So good I regretted losing a third of the bottle on opening.","LiquidAmber","May 27, 2014"

Out of the bottle though, this beer is completely different. The carbonation and brett are immediately noticeable and true to style. Even though there's hops in this they're almost unnoticeable, and the malt is very subdued. The wine yeast is probably the most noticeable in the taste and aroma categories, and makes this one of my favorite Saisons.","DrumKid003","Apr 19, 2014"

4.18,2.7,4.25,4.25,4,4.5,4.25,"Wispy bleached white head of extremely airy foam, amazing for how swiftly it evaporates down to the surface, looks like a video game, no lacing at all. Light, shiny golden straw color, easy to see through, full throughout with huge bubbles which steadily move with authority, a proverbial maelstrom in the glass. The nose suavely unfolds pressed flowers, clove spice, sour orange to grapefruit citrus, has a vinous quality to it, it’s too wiry and focused for the banana to bubblegum aspect to shine, same for any sweeter element, be it the apple, pear or the meadow breeze, the yeastiness is like just about to baked bread, not like dessert “baked goods.” Full-bodied, has a heavier which impairs it getting out of the gate, carbonation injects some fuel into this. White grape, pear, apple, apricot fruit lean and mean, bursts through and picks up speed from the pepper, clove, and metallic earth components. Noticeable for its freshness and cleanliness, once it breaks past the mid-palate it develops a lighter feel which makes it food friendly. Minimal banana and ester presence. Very interesting, obvious it belongs in this category but it doesn’t play to the crowd, quietly classy and willing to accept your lack of appreciation.","farrago","Apr 05, 2014"

Interesting how the pepper dominates such a syrupy, highly carbonated brew. I'm not picking up the pineapple as the description says is present. I wonder if this is because the bottle indicates an 8.2% beer, whereas previous bottles were apparently 7% (according to BA at least). I like it, and I normally like spicing like pepper but it seems way heavily present in the taste..yet the sugar balances it out somehow. Did i miss a different batch, one with more complexity... that being the lighter version? i dont know, but this Prairie Ale was still nice to try. In the end this was more like a hefty pilsner to me rather than a saison. Their phenomenal ""Hop"" version of this is what led me to pick this up.

Pours moderately hazy golden straw color with a 2-3 finger foamy and rocky white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big lemon, pineapple, peach, pear, apple, clove, pepper, hay, grass, white wine, wheat, light vinegar, funk, and yeast earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast notes with funk; and great strength. Taste of lemon, pineapple, peach, pear, apple, pepper, clove, hay, grass, white wine, wheat, light vinegar, funk, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of citrus, pineapple, light fruits, clove, pepper, hay, grass, wheat, white wine, funk ,and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Incredible balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, hop, and brett flavors; with a moderate malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a lightly creamy, crisp, and fairly prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an incredible saison style! All around fantastic balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, hop, and brett flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A near world class offering in my opinion.","superspak","Sep 29, 2013"

4.28,5.2,4,4,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Pours a cloudy banana yellow with a smallish white cap. The head is a bit small, but otherwise, it's a perfectly nice looking saison. The aroma is dried out fresh grain with fruity, barnyard-y saison yeast notes and a dash of funk. The fruitiness is a mix of light citrus and light stone fruits, lemons meet apricots. It has that dry yeasty smell of a well-fermented saison. Very farmhouse fresh. The brett still seems young, but it adds on a pleasant complexity. The taste starts surprisingly sweet and fruity before drying out and pushing into a lasting, almost acrid bitterness. The transition from fresh light grain and apricots to yeasty peppercorns and lemon peels is fast, nearly jarring, but it works for me. I particularly like that dry, bitter, spicy finish. The mouthfeel is light but full. Lots of flavor. No booze. Carbonation is somewhat high, though not abnormal for the style. This is a very well done beer. Great to see more quality saisons being produced by American brewers.","popery","Feb 22, 2013"

The bottle itself is just fun to look at with the great hand drawn artwork, corked and caged. Poured into a Duvel tulip with a thick white head. Smells of citrus, mostly orange, and lemon to me with some pepper. The Brett funk comes through as well. Smells amazing. The taste is a light body with moderate carb. Spice, citrus, and the Brett, much like it smelled. This beer was a definite ""wow"" for me in local beers, I hope Chase has raised the bar for Oklahoma brewers.

Pour is slightly cloudy straw color with a good head that reduces and maintains great retention and consistency. Now a narrow strip in the glass the bubbles are creamy and tightly packed and cling nicely to the glass. Citrus fruit is the first flavor to come through, mango, pineapple and orange with small amount of lemon peeking through. Moderate carbonation is apparent throughout the taste. Coarse bubbles hold all the way through to the finish. Prickly sensations as you swallow. The Brett character is extremely mild at this point, but is noticeable and should mature as time goes on. The finish is slightly sweet with a dry *ting* right at the end and very well done. The alcohol is well hidden and doesnt have an impact on the flavor or finish. This is one extremely well brewed Saison! I love the way the fruit flavors are not overpowering, but help to balance the slightly dry low Brett character. Hopefully the balance will maintain as the yeast develops in the bottle. If this is an example of what Chase and Colin Healey have in store for us, then WATCH OUT, because the ride has only begun!","BierGartenok","0"
