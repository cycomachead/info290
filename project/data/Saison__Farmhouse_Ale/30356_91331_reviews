"Prairie 'Merica -----4/5."
""

"I admit some bias here because Nelson Sauvin is not my favorite hop, something about it often reminds me of day-old Chinese food, yet this brewery has delivered outstanding brews time and time again."
""
""
"Wasn't exoecting the funk in this one. Didn't see Brett listed on the label, but wow, a nice surprise.  Well done from Prairie, as expected."
""
""
""
"Overall (4.25): I really, really like this beer, a whole hell of a lot. If I brewed beer, this is exactly the kind of thing I’d want to make every single day. The mix of funk, body, drinkability, and complex mixture of bread, fruit, and vinous character make for a dynamic beer that’s easy for anyone to enjoy. I love this beer, but I sure do wish it didn’t cost $10 a bottle. Ah, well . . . and occasional pleasure, I suppose. But at least it gives me something to shoot for when judging other, similar beers, and hopefully the type of beer I brew in the future. Thanks, Prairie! I’ll definitely be pulling the tigger on your brews more often now."

"Overall just another delicious tasting Prairie saison to add to the arsenal."

"Pours a cloudy gold color with dense one finger thick cap of white foam, delicate sheet of glass trails the head by a couple of inches. Massively doughy and grassy; flowery, white grape, white peach, pear, coriander-ish perfumey. Taste: pear, pineapple-ish (where the tiny bit of acidity ties in well), white peach, a little grapeskin, doughy back. A little chalky otherwise pillowy feel, medium bodied. Fruit forward is an understatement. It's good, although gets a bit sweet by the end of the bottle even for 500 ml."

"O - I thought this was a very interesting, complex and tasty beer. This was my first beer from Prairie and they have set the bar high with this one."

""
""
""

""
""
"Tropical, white grape, peach, white pepper, sweet fruit, earthy, very light tartness"
""
""
"Too sweet. Tastes like someone poured a bunch of table sugar into a Brett saison."
"O- It is another awesome brew from Prairie. Something you would very much expect with a sour. Would drink again."
"Great sour! It smells really nice and fruit undetones. The mouthfeel is pretty solid for a saison and the sour really comes through."

"O- I've had my share of saisons and I think there must be something wrong here... I can't even call the after taste ""funk"".   I may try to find a fresher bottle and try this again, but for the mean time, I have to give it a 2.25"

"Overall: smells pretty good but tastes nothing like it in a very bad way. I found this beer very hard to drink due to the harsh earthy acidic flavor and bad dry aftertaste."

"Pour is heavily hazed straw yellow with a tight creamy white head. Nose is heavy grapefruit juice, tropical tartness, tons of hop, notes of leather. taste has lots of grapefruit, moderately bitter, light body. Balance of grainy malt, faintly floral and semi dry with a hint of leather. Brett? Rather hoppy."

"Overall: this is a truly wonderfully put together brew. Nelson Sauvin was an outstanding choice for this brew, their inherent cutting edge was a perfect marriage with the white wine and Brett aspects. Bravo."

"O. A very nice beer with an out of balance mouthfeel. Finish is extremely yeasty and dry, to the detriment of all the other pleasant qualities the brew presents. Even so, it glows with craftsmanship. This was made with love and the quality of the ingredients is notable in the flavor profile, which is complex and enjoyable. It's just too bad the finish is so over the top in its dryness and bitterness."

"NYE bottle share at Proof courtesy of Rachel. Pours an opaque creamy yellow. Tons of white frothy head. Head holds really well and by the time I finished the sample, the head was still holding. Aroma is straight floral hops and grass. Such a great, but unique smell. Taste is floral hops with a good amount of banana behind it. Nice high carbonation and medium-thick body."

"O: Flavorful, complex and delicious. Well integrated and executed. Definitely potent, cheesey and yeasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Lots of brett funk in the aroma with some nice fruity notes mixed in. I definitely pick up that 'cat litter' characteristic in this beer and it's a little overpowering at times, I see that as it's only downfall. Overall, very complex and a nice intro to Prairie for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"What can I say? This beer is highly attenuated and wonderful, the earthy funk and hop bitter combine with yeast and bugs to create greatness. Definitely recommended."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A hop forward saison. For me, the hops were a little too heavy handed and did some weird things with the brett. It’s almost like someone peed on a barn floor. Once the beer warmed up a pleasant lactic tangyness appeared in the nose and taste. I did enjoy the nice malty finish, and wouldn’t mind seeing more of that."

"500 ml bottle. Served in a tulip, the beer pours a cloudy straw gold color with a frothy couple inch white head that sticks around for a very long time. There's also a good amount of lacing. The brew smells like bready malt, yeast, grass/hay, pears, funk and some lemon peel. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some green grapes/white wine and some citrus. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's crisp and also well carbonated. The soft carbonation helps make this brew very smooth and easy to drink. 'Merica is a pretty good brew, I certainly liked it. Definitely worth a try if you come across some. $10.99 a bottle."
""
""
""
"O - Really good beer. Nice use of Nelson hops, and the Brett plays off of them well. Tropical and refreshing, it's like a not-so-tart Berliner."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a cloudy straw with a fluffy white head and good retention. Nice lacing. Great farmhouse nose, black pepper, pear, bit of funk. Lots going on palate-wise, fruit on the front, some lemon, grass, and funk, with a tart, pithy finish. Light bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, a tart, funky saison that is extremely drinkable."
""
""
""
"Overall - Overwhemled by Nelson, which isn't a bad thing. But one dimensional."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A decent saison, but for a style I've really come to love recently, this one doesn't stand up to many of the greats I've experienced lately."
"Got in a trade with cyde. 750 ml bottle into tulip glass, 2013 vintage bottling. Pours moderately hazy bright golden straw color with a 1-2 finger foamy white head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin ring of lacing. Minimal lacing on the glass, and some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of huge peach, pineapple, mango, passion fruit, grape, lemon zest, orange zest, straw, floral, grass, pepper, clove, herbal, cracker, light honey, white wine, light funk, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with awesome complexity of big tropical/citrus hop and yeast/brett ester notes with moderate malt balance; and great strength. Taste of big peach, pineapple, lemon zest, grape, passion fruit, clove, pepper, straw, grass, floral, herbal, cracker, light honey, white wine, light funk, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Good amount of fairly tart/earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of peach, pineapple, lemon zest, grape, passion fruit, clove, pepper, straw, grass, herbal, floral, white wine, cracker, light funk, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of hop, malt, and fruity/spicy yeast and brett flavors; with a good malt/spiciness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and moderately prickly mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice saison style. All around good balance and complexity of hop, malt, and fruity/spicy yeast/brett ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

"Overall pretty nice, good saison characters with a nice effervescent lemony character, pretty nice."

"I really like this beer. Not only because I have newfound respect for Okie brewing, but because this is a bold experiment in funk and I am a better person for having tried it. Cheers to Prairie Artisan Ales."

"O: One of the best American interpretations of a Belgian style that I’ve had in a long time. Looks like we’re taking this farmhouse idea and running with it; honestly, given the choice between an American wild ale and a Belgian one, I’m pretty sure I’d pick the American. There’s novelty and originality in every bottle of this brew, plus a yeast cake so thick you could probably scoop it out and spread it on toast; if that’s not good beer, I don’t know what is."
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is really good. Hazy with a thick white head, and plenty of persistent lacing. Nose is yeasty, with funky citrus. Crisp, hoppy, and yeasty, with some fermented citrus accentuates. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall this was a delicious saison, well done."

"Fuller bodied than expected with tight carbonation up front as well as strong zesty spice and earthy hop flavors that linger over the other notes into a bone dry finish. Dry, earthy and bitter up front with peppery spice, earthy resinous hops and musty bugs followed by funky saison yeast, bread, biscuit and light fruit. Lots sticky, oily hop flavor up front with pine needle, grass and spruce tip along with a very prominent dry, musty brett character that's faintly countered by sweet citrus/tropical fruit, bread, biscuit, apple and pear. A bit one dimensional with all of the dryness from the hops and brett but there is subtle sweetness and a strong bready yeast component balancing things out. Some pineapple and grapefruit hop flavor buried underneath but overall, this beer is just a bit too dry/one note for my preference. Complex for sure, but the dry hops and brett and prominent bready yeast notes overpower almost everything else."

"O - Saison, hoppy, pilsner. Solid beer that is easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Hazy yellow with a medium white head and good lacing. Aroma of white chardonnay with a good Farmhouse character, cat pee, funk and notes of pilsner malt. Taste is slightly sweet with white wine, Farmhouse yeast, light malty notes and citrus. Alcohol is well hidden. Medium body. Good carbonation. Slightly dry finish. Very good hoppy Saison."
""
""
""
""
""
"T: A slightly spicy hop presence upfront. A lingering grapefruit juice bitterness on the back with some grass, hay, barnyard and a touch of lemon. Finishes with a lingering grassy bitterness and some lemon meringue. Mouthfeel is lively and crisp without being overcarbonated. This is probably the best I've had from these guys to date."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A bitter, zesty, spicey farmhouse that has some unique flavors. I like the beer and might try it again, but probably not something i'd keep on regular rotaion."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm most impressed with how Prairie manages to create such a complex beer with one malt, one hop, and one yeast strain. I give most of the credit to their yeast strain: it produces an excellent Saison/Farmhouse ale that would give most other Saison's a run for their money. I really only have two complaints: 1) the taste is a bit too hoppy for my taste. I'd dial down the IBU's by 5 or so. 2) I wish the hop was more fruit-forward than grass-forward. I prefer my Saisons on the fruity side so a different hop choice would throw this over the top for me."
""
"Funky Saison yeast with a nice strong hop influence. Flavors meld nicely and it creates a unique brew. Would really like to know more about their yeast."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy sandy yellow with a big frothy white head. Aroma is passionfruit, lemon, grapes, sweet apples, a little spice, and a touch of bread. Flavor is huge bitter passionfruit and lemon, grapes come out to offer some sweetness once it begins to noticeably warm up some, pepper, cracker, funk, and grassy bitterness. A crisp, active, dry mouthfeel. Overall, worth the hype. Prairie wowed me with my first beer from them."
""
""
""
""
"D - A lot going on in this beer for 1 hop and 1 malt. Very nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Nice hoppy saison from Prairie. A little bit hoppy, a little bit funky, a little bit wine-y, a little bit spicy. Nice balance of flavors and quite complex overall. Really a quite nice american style saison."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a very solid Saison for how simple it is. Quite enjoyable. Thank you Harold for sending me the bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" The flavor is great, very nice tropical fruit from the both the hops and some with a little tangy brett augmenting with some light malt sweetness to cushion the bitterness level with a nice tangy white grape tinge of Nelson. This deserves the rating since it melds a nice wild character with a more hop forward saison, nice flavor, aroma and is very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"Someone below said its reminiscent of Fantome...not in any way is this accurate. Fantome is my favorite ""brewery"" of all time, but taste nothing like this. Both are amazing, but in different ways."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A rustic and interesting ale. Glad to have tried it. Was not inspired to drop another nine bucks on a bottle. However, as the beer warmed a bit in the glass, flavors opened up and showed more depth, and my opinion improved. Vaguely reminiscent of Fantome Saison, which is high praise."
"O - It's a bit 1-D, but that's obvious given the ingredients. I can't complain and it's very refreshing to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M: Light bodied. Very refreshing."
"Overall- Solid beer to very good beer. A good interpretation of the style and definitely worth a try."
"O- This is what it's all about boys and girls. Definitely my favorite offering from Prairie this far."
"Overall, this brewery has impressed me so much in the past few days. This Saison reminds me of the outstanding Blvd. Saison-Brett. Its slightly hoppier and a bit dryer but still amazing."
""
""
""
"Tart, funky, earthy, juicy and dry. Awesome Saison!"

"Pours a murky whitish-yellow with a foamy white head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, citrus and tropical fruit, earth, yeast, and Brett aromas. Taste is much the same with slightly sour citrus, tropical, and Brett flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of Brett bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with some great Brett forward aromas and flavors that make this one tasty and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
"Note: Pouring the yeast from the bottom into the glass yields a more milky appearance that resembles old stale orange juice. It does make the beer a bit better, albeit a bit more sourdoughy."
"O: nice example of an American saison. Extremely palatable and especially drinkable for 7.5%."
"The beer appears extremely hazy and pure yellow with an inch of soapy white head. The aroma is simply fabulous. Dank hops and farmhouse funk. So fresh. Wow. Great flavor as well. Beautiful blend of Nelson hops and saison character. A healthy amount of bitterness in the back, finishing dry. The aroma is slightly superior to the flavor, but the beer is firing on all cylinders. Superb."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Mouthfeel is nice and light, and carbonation is just about perfect. Very nice mouthfeel. Overall, I thought this was a pretty good saison. I am not a huge fan of the heavy white pepper and spicy sharpness, so downgraded it a bit. I like more well roundedness out of my saisons, but I definitely still enjoyed it."
""
"Sooo good. Pale, slightly hazy light yellow (nearly a white ale) with a generous billowing white head. Hops and yeast dominate the nose. Citrusy Nelson Sauvin hops and spicy notes from the yeast make a great first impression. First taste lives up to the smell. The single pale malt lets the hops really be king, with the yeast a close second. Refreshing citrus and pine notes are nicely complemented by hints of spice and funk from the yeast. Every drink is as good as the one before. This is a perfect example of the virtues of simplicity in brewing- more brewers ought to follow this lead. Simply beautiful. My only complaint is that I paid $9 for a 500ml bottle, slightly higher than I think is justified."
"Smells is appealing and very herbal on the nose. Lots of lemon zest and lemongrass with some peppery yeast notes. Smell leads nicely into the taste and is an excellent example of a beer tasting close to the nose. Nice tartness with lemon and grapefruit bitterness leading into the herbal lemongrass and peppery yeast notes. Moderate to high carbonation lets the full body feel nice and light on the tongue. I would like to try this again and would love to try it on tap."
""
"Glad I got to try this one. It's an awesome single hop saison, and the Nelson really complements the malts well on this one. Awesome. I need to try more of the Prairie beers."

"Yeat: Prairie Farmhouse"
""
"Overall: Yet another solid offering from Prairie. Amazing that this only single malt and hop. Easily a beer to seek out and purchase again"

"This beer pours out a very light golden color and is extremely hazy and full of life teaming with carbonation. It has one nice white head, very bubbly at first but then it dissipates into thins bubbles with a light lacing. Grapefruit and citrus fruits are the first thing to hit your nose, followed by some mild malts. I also picked up some mild berry aromas as well. Its light and crisp up front and is semi-dry; it’s tart overall and the citrus fruits reign the flavor arena. It gets a bit drier in its aftertaste, but overall is pretty smooth and very refreshing. It light-to-medium bodied and really hits your taste buds."
"A most interesting beer. One malt - Pilsner - one hop - Nelson Sauvin - and Prairie's pretty funky farmhouse yeast. Amazing what a simple bill of ingredients can do. The nose is unbelievably stinky and the Sauvin hops really shine as well. Highly recommended."

"Pours a hazy gold with a moderate white head. Smells of bretty funk and citrusy hops. Flavor is crackery pils malts up front with a presence of brett and citrus in the middle. Finish is moderately dry and slightly tart. The brett and citrus from the hops play so well together. Bitterness shows itself but isn't overbearing. Mouthfeel is highly effervescent but with a solid body. This is awesome. The first beer from Prairie that has truly wowed me."
"Appears cloudy golden peach, white head with fine speckled around the sides of my glass. Aroma tart funky yeast, bright lemon with a hint of band aid and medicinal quality. Flavor is citric lemony with grassy hay earthiness, medicinal phenolics. A bit of funky band aid and tangy yogurt notes, the body is medium with flowing carbonation. Overall it was a bit difficult to consume mainly due to the intense funky house yeast they are using on the prairie."

"O - The most satisfying from Prarie that I've tried, give me 12 pack of this in cans and I'd make short work of it"

"They packed a ton of character into this with only one malt and one hop. That alone is worth the price of admission. I do very much enjoy this. Though not as much as some of the other saisons this wonderful little brewery has to offer. That is not to say it is bad at all, and very much recommended."
""
""
"Pours a hazy straw gold capped by a foamy bright white head. Average retention, little to no lacing. Bright citrusy notes, most notably lemon, mandarin orange, and yuzu balanced by earthy yeast. Opens with light but diverse hoppy citrus notes and hints of pineapple and passion fruit and perhaps some white grape. Yeasty earthiness with mild barnyard accents appear midpalate. Finishes semi-dry with bright and slightly bitter citrus and continued earthiness. Heavier side of light bodied, smooth and silky with moderate carbonation. A very tasty well-balanced brew. Recommended."

"I couldn't help myself but to celebrate the birth of America (depending on what history book you read) with opening a bottle of Merica. This is clearly an American take on a Belgian style. Big thanks to BlueOkie for this winner!"

"O- very nice saison that has lemon and citrus notes and slight sourness."
""
""
""
"O: Yet another nice farmhouse which I would have again."
""
""
"O: The aroma on this is very nice. Funky, juicy, earthy - just what I like in a Saison. However, the Brett and dryness dominates the flavor a bit too much. I'd like more clove, citrus, sweetness, just more Saison flavors in general. This certainly isn't a bad beer, but I was expecting more after having a few of their other offerings."
""
""
""
""
"Light body with just a touch of carbonation, enough to tickle the tongue. Very interesting beer, with the brett really taking over the aroma and flavor. If you don't like bretty, you would probably hate this."
""
"I'm still exploring this style and don't have a lot of experience with it, but this is one of the best I've had so far. The combination of pilsener-like flavors up front and musty dryness in back is tough to beat. I like the very faint funkiness and appreciate that it contributes to, rather than dominates, the flavor. Definitely a beer worthy of repeated visits."

"Pours a pale orangish yellow, straw color. The beer is quite cloudy. The head puffs up into quite a mass at first, but it proves to be rather fizzy and dissipates quickly. Pretty much no bubbles are left at a minute, and there's no lacing. The aroma is chock full of Nelson Sauvin hops. It's wonderfully and fresh and juicy. I'm getting grape, melon and pineapple flavors primarily with peach, orange, lime, mint, mango and grass adding to the mix. It's a tremendous hop aroma. Underneath all of that hop fruitiness, there's a touch of yeasty, earthy funk. It doesn't hit you in the face like the hops, but the beer is definitely in saison/farmhouse territory when you look for the yeast flavors. Just a touch of soft honey-ish malt. The taste is starts off with sweet fruitiness and more of that honeyed pale malt before developing a firm bitterness of lime rind, lemon/grapefruit pith and earth. There's a spicy, herbal edge of juniper, mint, peppercorns and earl grey bergamot. The yeast dries out the beer and shows off some of that funky prairie flavor, but it's not the focus of this beer. This beer is a celebration of the Nelson Sauvin hop. I absolutely love Alpine Nelson and Keene Idea, but while a rather different take, 'Merica can stand with those beers as the best expression of the hop that I've tried. Mouthfeel is lively with lots of hop oiliness. The finish is drying and the bitterness lingers for some time. This is a wonderful beer. My only slight knock on it is that I think the malt flavor could use a little tweak, maybe a touch of wheat. Regardless, Prairie has proven themselves as a brewery to watch with a second round of excellent releases. I'm thrilled that they have wide distribution and look forward to more beers from them."
""
"Prairie has been kicking out some fantastic beers, and this is one of the best examples to date!! Full disclosure, I was a Redbud Cuvee 3 and 4 fanboy, so I call: ""In before the hype!"" lol Seriously though, I strongly recomend this and or any other things they've been doing."
""
"Overall, a very pleasant surprise and a great first beer from OK!"
"Tart, refreshing. I could drink a lot of these."
""
"The Nelson Sauvin hops are made for Saisons. But Prairie gives it a powdery-tart taste and texture that seems wood aged and sour blended. Their taste reminds me of Anchorage Brewing Company and what they do to achieve complexity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This paired very well with spicy artichoke dip."
"8.5/10"
""
"A showcase for Nelson Sauvin hops to be sure. The complexity born from the simplicity of a SMaSH beer is pretty amazing. That said, I guess a small complaint would be that the pungency of the hops completely overwhelms any of the subtle nuance that might have been gained from the floor-malted pils. Still a really enjoyable beer and another great effort from Prairie."
