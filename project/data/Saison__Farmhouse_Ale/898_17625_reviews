"DATE TASTED: February 8, 2015... GLASSWARE: La Fin du Monde tulip... OCCASION: watching the Grammys and waiting for more inclement weather... APPEARANCE: cloudy, light yellow body; creamy off-white head settles to a reasonably bubbly half-inch; ... AROMA: instant lemon grass and bubble gum; pepper, clove, and a bevy of hop varietals to tantalize ... PALATE: quite drinkable, with a smooth, rum-like warmth and comfort; the finish is dry but welcoming and lingering...TASTE: a dramatically packed burst of hops that evoke flowers and lemongrass; bubblegum, clove and anise (?) complicate the experience in a good way, with each sip invoking consideration; fruits like pear and apple arrive late in a loaded plate  ...OVERALL: this was the beer I took to the 2003 trip to OBX, and all as well until I found a claw (!) in a bottle; still, a fantastic beer for the summer--and, not bad in the months leading up to the spring..."

"Pours a slightly opaque deep gold with effervescence boiling up from the bottom of the goblet where the stem is attached. The pour produces 2+ fingers of white, moderately lasting, foam head that fades to a thin surface cap with a thick island at the center that leaves a thin collar ring & streaks lace. Aroma is mostly wheat but a hint of biscuit malt, notes of banana, Belgian yeast & perfumey fruitiness with a hint of acidic green apple sourness. Taste is sweeter than the nose with notes of wheat, cobbler dough & banana with hints of peach, white grape & slightly tart green apple, spices, Belgian sugar & yeast. Finishes peppery & mildly acidic with a light bitterness that lingers & builds in the wheaty, floral, dry & mildly tart aftertaste. Mouthfeel is divergent being medium bodied with a lively carbonation, sweet up front - dry in the finish/aftertaste, spottily acidic & prickly, creamy but slightly oily & slick over the tongue."

"ok beer...doesn't have the smooth finish that a good saison (e.g. Saison Dupont) has."
"This beer was a poor excuse for a saison. It was very heavy and spiced to the point of palate shock. I could barely get through it. If it wasn't given to me, I would have drain poured this one."
""
""
""
""
"Tastes like a spicy champagne."

"O: I would likely rate this beer a bit higher if it involved a bit less grassy hop bittering, and a bit more sourness / funkiness. As it stands, this drinks like an over-hopped hefeweizen."
""
""
""
"Pretty good saison"
""
""
""
""

""

"Highly complex flavor."
""
""
""
""
"As other reviewers have noted, this seems much more like some sort of hefeweizen-belgian pale hybrid than a saison. That being said, I thought it was excellent, whatever you want to call it. I think the scores here are a bit lower because it doesn't fit neatly into any one style. But if you like Belgian strong pales, you'll probably enjoy this one."

"9/21....hazy bronze, thick, specs of light at the bottom. with touches of foam remaining. Funky smell, sweet, candied, yeast, wheat. Complex fruity taste, peppery sharp. Nicely balanced and bitter."
"O: more like a Belgian Strong Pale than a Saison. I dont need my beers this strong unless they are from Belgium. But tasty."
""
""

""
""
"Tasty and full flavored. Nice golden color with lots of yeast floating around. Aromas of yeast and spices. Coriander, light pepper. Honeyed malt. Taste follows nose with an edge of alcohol in the finish. Crisp feel and a slight sickness. A touch heavy.Easy drinking, but a little sharp. A nice beer overall."
"On cask. Beautiful beer on cask."

"Pours a thin head that goes away almost immediately. Lovely amber color and well-balanced refreshing flavor. A strong yeasty aroma and aftertaste, which I normally do not like but I can tolerate in this one. Overall a nice brew that goes down pretty easily."

"O: refreshing and thirst quenching, but I would definitely have liked an orange component to the flavor;"

"This was one I have wanted to try for a while. Really great pour nice amber appearance with fluffy bubbly head. A rather simple nose, spicy, Belgian yeast, and a bit of grainy scent. The flavor is rather unique as opposed to other saisons I have had. Similar spicy notes including coriander and pepper. A really strange graininess follows like a hefeweizen. I checked the description and found that they do use wheat so I guess that explains the graininess. Last is the nondescript hop bitterness. It's certainly different and unlike other saisons I've had. Overall it was successful for me. Maybe not the best in the class but certainly interesting."

"Poured a deeper cloudy gold with a thinner white head. The head lingers on leaving some sticky soapy lacing. The smell is quite good, with some nice deep fruity esters and hints of spices. The taste hits it just right with some notes of grain, banana and sugar. It has a thinner body and is a well-made saison."

"This beer is interesting, but I wouldn't score it highly as a saison. While I like the banana forward flavor, I feel like a more varied yeast profile and drier finish would improve it."

"3.73/5.00"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Good, though a little too hot from that high ABV and the slick feel doesn't really work for a saison."
""
"not the greatest saison I've had. but it is drinkable. has the base flavors but its just not that complex. might be picking up some cinnamon spice. otherwise just a little too sweet for the style. good value though, and still refreshing. a bit heavy, I like this style between 6-7%"
""
""
""
"Overall, this was not a bad beer, but I don't think it was quite a saison either. It seemed to be more of a tripel or some other Belgian style. Not sorry to have tried it, but probably don't need to buy it again. Just didn't meet the truly expectation of a saison."
""
"O: This saison seems to be a little heavier in body compared to most of the other beers I've tried in the style, possibly due to its use of candi sugar as an ingredient."
""

"Overall, I've had better but I find this to be an easy, crisp drinking Saison that fits in its niche."
"Overall: Pretty solid Saison. A little sweeter than most, but still enjoyable."
"O - Not a bad beer, and I enjoyed it for the most part. However, I've had other beers that I much preferred to this one."
""
"Mouthfeel is well carbonated, but could be somewhat smoother, with sour beer bubbles. My sense is that this was over force carbonated"
"O- This was the first ""saison"" I ever had and had turned me on to the style. Years later it's both easy to see what I liked about this one and how it falls short of the standard set by many others in the style. A very drinkable and enjoyable beer which hides its alcohol well but not as complex or yeast driven as the best of the style."
""
"O- Pleasant and drinkable, but falls far short of the benchmarks of the style (Dupont, Sofie, etc)"
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours golden orange with a small white head. Smells of sweet grain and Belgian yeast. Tastes of sweet berries and a little of a sweet grain. Carbonation is right light bodied and goes down smooth. Overall a pretty good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"pours a clear golden color with a half inch head that quickly fades to the beer and no lace to speak of. aromas of ripe fruit and spice. taste is of ripe peaches with a slightly spicey rum alcohol finish. medium mouthfeel and light carbonation. tasted more like a lighter version of a barley wine. would try this beer again."
"More of a typical Belgian than a farmhouse, barnyard saison, but I like that. Good estery yeast character that dominates and lingers. Pleasantly surprised, but it's not to style."
"I have to give this one bonus points in the ""overall"" section. I quite like the taste and feel of this beer, I just feel its a weak representation of the style. I generally find that American saisons are average at best in this category."

"Tried this seasonal brew from Heavy Seas this weekend. I will not rate it among the best in Heavy seas lineup but still it was not disappointing. If you do not like hoppy beer, this might impress you. Taste sweet and a lot of fruits. 7.5% alcohol is well balanced by the taste."
""
""
""
"Overall: A nice beer from Heavy Seas. Good taste, but the smell was not up to par and kind of killed it for me. Would drink again, but wouldn't buy a 6-pack of it"

"O: Look, it's not really a bad BSPA at all. It's just a bad saison: the only characteristic Heavy Seas got right is the spice flavor, and that's simply too mild. Not only is it too sweet for a saison, it's too sweet for a regular Belgian pale ale. I don't plan to revisit this one."

"Single finger head on a murky golden with slight amber hues body. Excellent retention and some lacing. A lot of musty pale malt and Belgian yeast with light clove and little in the way of citrus. Flavor is good but not great, keeping it simple with mild lemon tartness, hint of orange peel, Belgian yeast and herbal hop character. The mouthfeel is full for the style and semi dry finish with moderate carbonation. I think Heavy Seas makes a lot of easy to drink beers which arent bad but lack creativity overall. I like most everything I have had, I just wouldnt call many of their beers memorable or complex."
""
""
""
""
"This isn't a bad beer, but the balance just isn't there. The flavors are there, but they just couldn't hold my interest. In the end, there are better saisons out there, but this is worth a try."
""
""
""
""
"o: very nice. i really enjoyed this, though I think it would have been improved (and closer to style) if it was drier rather than fairly sweet. still, out of the Heavy Seas mixed 12-pack, this was my favorite."

"O- I don't know what they were going for, but they missed the mark. Another big disappointment from Heavy Seas."
"Overall: Waaayyy to clean for a saison. These beers should'nt be headache machines, but that doesn't mean you should ferment them through in the low 60s either. They need to let this beer develop a little more natural complexity before it can compete with the best of American saisons (Southampton, GI, etc.)."

"O - Again quite refreshing and tasty for a Belgian Saison. I would definitely drink again. Initially server a little too cold (40F), once it warmed up it was much more smooth in the taste, mouth and overall."

""
""
""

"O - I love this recipe, the candi sugar and wheat malts take this beer to its max, I really enjoyed it!"

"O. A very tasty beer that is easy to drink that is not too bitter or too sweet."
"Overall I was surprised to find this was a summer release because to me age (4-5 month) kept it the same if not improved the flavor. If I find if fresh next summer I will have to compare but it's still drinking fantastic."
""
""
""
""
""

"O- Nice summer beer that can be drunk anytime."
"O: Good saison. Accessible to novices, with just enough odd sourness to keep it interesting. Drinkable and enjoyable. Vaguely recommended. Have had several, so probably won't have again."
"O: Not my favorite saison, but still quite good. I really enjoyed the spices and flavor elements, although something is missing from this beer that holds it back from being really great."
"A nice beer, one that I am glad I tried."
"O: A good solid beer. Refreshing and interesting. I would buy again."
"Not a bad beer, but it doesn't seem much like a saison- more like a light tripel. I like my saison's with a peppery bite to them and a bit dryer than this beer, but hey, whatever it is it's pleasant. Pours golden with a moderate head that fades to a thin ring fairly quickly, but the beer puts up a continuous stream of bubbles. You do get some spice and pepper in the aroma, followed by some grassiness and sweetness. Fairly sweet with some clove notes and perhaps even a little banana. Slightly hot in the mouth, but otherwise fairly smooth."
"This was a very nice beer, very easy to drink, nice flavor. It sort of reminds me of Fruit Stripe Gum in beer form. This is something I would definitely drink again."
"Quite drinkable."
"O - it's the wrong style, but it's not a bad beer."
"O- not impressed...I really wanted to like this one and it couldn't stand up to the task. I'd previously had this on cask and been very impressed, but the bottled version left a lot to be desired."
"O: Interesting saison brew. A little too sweet for me, but I enjoyed it thoroughly. I was surprised to see this beer had 7.5% abv. Alcohol was brilliantly masked by the sweet malt."
"cloudy gold in appearance. Has a nice foam that lingers. The aroma is good to average. The feel on the mouth is clean with very little lingering, nice. overall taste is ok, there is a spice to the taste, not for everyone. Over-Overall this is a good quality beer that goes well with soft pretzel with good yellow mustard."
"This is a one and done for me. I'm not a real big fan of saisons to begin with and it would take some real effort to drink another."
"12 ounce bottle into tulip, best by Dec 2011. Pours orangish golden amber color with 1-2 fingers of a fairly dense light khaki head with good retention that reduces to a fairly thick lacing cap. A small bit of lacing clings to the glass as well. Aromas of dark fruits, candi sugar, banana, clove, spices, and a bit of alcohol. Decent and interesting aromas here, with good strength as well. Taste of lots of dark fruits, clove, banana, molasses, bread, and spices; with a bit of caramel and alcohol noticed on the finish. Fairly dry finish, but there are a bit of lingering notes of dark fruits, bread, molasses, and spices. Alcohol is slightly present in the taste, and there is a decent amount of warming on the finish. Medium carbonation and body with a bit of a creamy mouthfeel. Quite drinkable despite the alcohol presence as well. Overall, this is a solid saison that is like a wheat beer in some aspects."
"O) A delicious saison. True to form. I'd have another one."
"O: I felt that the beer was a good attempt at the style but somewhat fell flat in overall complexity. The pros include a nice, spicy refreshing quality cold out of the bottle but the lack of depth is noticeable. Still, the beer was easy to drink and at $7.99 a sixer, I can't fault the price point for a saison-esque brew."
"O: Had no trouble finishing the bottle, but doubt I'd buy it again."
"O: a great, local and affordable saison! I buy this every time its out."
"O: A saison produced in Baltimore. It has some nice lemon sunshine zing and great carbonation. But is also has some earthy elements. The alcohol is blended well, and the slight bitterness in the finish balances out the very sweet malt opening salvo. There are times the beer feels a bit watery, which might be caused by the high level of carbonation. It is not as dry as a saison should be, and it is sweeter as well. The beer does not taste bad, but it is not everything the style should be either."
"Overall - Decent, i admire this beer for having a different flavor then most saisons ive had, just not sure id want this flavor all the time. Good fruit presence for sure, but the sweetness overpowers the beer and that makes it a little unenjoyable. Still not bad and worth a drink."
"Saisons are dry beers, and this beer isn't so I can't justify giving it a decent score. It's medium-bodied for the style, perhaps even on the thicker side, but the sweetness and wetness does the beer in. Overall, this is a curious beer that doesn't taste poorly but also doesn't rate highly. It's trying to be a Saison and it is more or less failing at it."
"a pretty average beer....nothing about this beer really even says saison!...as with all their beers its pretty malty i'll have to give them that...no dry mouthfeel....no strong belgian yeast taste....i just may have a skunked beer....has a diacatyl taste so it could be a storage issue...so i can't exactly give them an F...but ill give them a B for now"
"O: Too spicy. 3.5"
"O - This has good drinkability. It goes down easy and has nice flavor. It isn't my favorite saison by any means, but it is definitely enjoyable. The only things I would change is the lingering booziness in the finish and tone down the sweetness a bit. Other than that it's pretty nice. I think its worth trying."
"O - I'm a big fan of Red Sky at Night, and I was really happy to try the cask version with this medley. The big earthy hop resin flavor works so well with this saison--just fantastic. I would seek this beer out in any version. Easily the best offering from Heavy Seas."
"I am just starting to get into the Saison ales and this is my second behind Ithica Groundbreak. This beer pours a nice golden color that is crystal clear with lots of carbonation. The head stays as more of a thin constant layer than a thick foam and there is some lacing. The smell reminds me of some American wheat yeast strains but with a distinct sour aroma... almost like a sauerkraut thats been sweetened. The yeast strain is mellow in flavor with pepper notes and a continuation of the sour vibe going on here. The sour mixes with a mellow bitterness and the mouthfeel is alcohol sweet and dry. A great edition to the Saison arena which would go great with some seafood. Yum!"
"O/D: An easy to drink Saison is a pretty redundant phrase. It's a tasty example of the style, with a Heavy Seas higher gravity. Not the best, but certainly better than many (as far as ""larger"" produced Saisons go)."
"O: Very refreshing beer that was well balanced. I would drink this again."
"Overall, while there are many lovely and delightful flavors in here, this does seem like a featherweight Belgian: easy on the tongue, and not as nuanced or practiced as its bigger brothers. That doesn't mean that it's a bad beer, of course--in fact, it's very drinkable. But if you're a huge fan of Belgians, this is not going to add anything new to your repertoire."
"Overall - If only this beer produced a better head, I would have given it a 5. Appearance knocked it down a 1/2 nocth. Superb brew in all other aspects. I'm definitely going to sample some more saisons if this is what they are like."
"Beer is oddly bitter with a sweet edge to it, the yeast character is really strong, makes the beer slightly hard to drink but it has a decent finish, a little too dry. I don't think I'll have it again."
"The taste is spicy, with pleasant herbal hops, a light fruity backbone, and slightly too much booze. The spicy character is its best asset, but about half-way through the beer as it warms, the alcohol takes over and covers up some of the complexities that this beer exhibited in the first sip. The herbal hops are still there however, and provide a solid taste throughout. The mouthfeel is a little on the watery side, not being crisp or creamy. Dry in the finish though. All around, this is a just a decent beer. A couple things could probably be improved, but still a decent drink."
"O: a solid saison that comes in a sixer...what could be better? Very tasty and worth seekin out if you like saisons..."
"drinkability: has all the elements of the Saison style, adequate abv, quality ingredients and character, not too intense which makes it a good drinkable beer."
"The aroma was charged with spice, it was so carbonated it was literally tickling my nose as it went by. Lots of light fruit, grain, touches of grass and peppery like notes along with a touch of sour, the flavor was more of the same and was very nicely done. No hint of the alcohol here, rather a finely blended, and very light and airy feel to it. Sloshing it around created that coveted silky feeling of foam in the mouth. This was very good. Lots of light citrus flavors bouncing around and a very dry finish, a touch sour but not really, Very earthy in nature, and yet very light with a nice light grain base and a wonderful champagne like finish."
"Has some sweetness to it which is odd for a Saison. I don't really find this beer to be a traditional Saison brew. This beer was on the cloudy yellow colored side. Has a pretty good head that sticks around till the end. The beers sweetness kinda turned me off from this brew. To me a Saison should be more earthy or funky but this one just didn't have that."
"Purchase before September 2010 date on bottle. Served from bottle into a The Bruery tulip. Poured golden yellow with a one and a half finger pure white head that subsided to one finger slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, banana, and subtle spices. The flavor was of sweet malt, massive banana, very subtle spices, and a big sweet followthrough. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this wasn't too bad. If I'm honest I wasn't really expecting much from this one, but it came out nicely. Had a nicely balanced flavor going on in this one with a good aroma as well. Not sure why the reviews are so low on this one, but I found it to be quite nice and have robust flavors in all the right places. A must try in my opinion (and I usually hate Saisons)."
"As many flaws as I did find with this beer, It's still a pretty good deal at roughly $8/6-pack. I'm generally not one for taking style into consideration when reviewing a beer, but this one improves drastically when you stop expecting a saison. Expect a slightly above-average hefeweizen or American wheat and you'll be pleasantly surprised."
"From their Heavy Seas line (it's Heavy Seas that separate the men from the boys), Clipper City's Red Sky at Night pours a daytime sunny yellow with tons of carbonation and decent head and limited lacing. The smell is Belgium sweet, some citrus some spice, but noting overpowering or noticeable. The taste is good for a saison, which makes it much easier to drink. A sweet malt that has medium complexity and sweet candy and a slight peppery aftertaste are good. The yeast brings a tanginess and a citrus like taste to it. It's surprising to see that this is a 8% ABV. No really phenol smells or tastes. Overall I think this is a good beer for those starting Saisons. Although I think there could be more taste, more fruitiness, to bring out more of the styl"
"D - O.K."
"Served in a tulip. Appearance is a mild golden color with a nice white head and a good deal of lacing. Nose is subtle fruit plus some grain and spice. Taste has a bit of spice but is a bit lacking. Good feel with some light pepper. Drinks okay, but is not offering enough to be better than just a bit better than good."
"A golden amber ale which leaves a mere 1/4 inch of white head and minimal retention and lacing. The smell is yeasty, some bread and spicy notes, as well as citrus and sweet malts. Sweet upfront, with some spiciness coming through in the back. Quite malty and sugary, and hot - really not sure what is going on with this saison - certainly different, but not in a good way. Medium bodied, dry, and hot - not all that drinkable either. Not a beer I would revisit, average at best."
"D: OK for this style, it was more sour than I thought it was going to be but it was still a decent saison."
"Overall, this is a pretty good beer, though not my favorite of the style. Still, I liked the complexity of the flavor and look forward to trying more beers from Clipper City, as they seem to put out some pretty solid stuff."
"d- okay, not the best saison ever, but it's drinkable."
"Very drinkable. 7.5% and you don't taste the alcohol? Wow. I could have had a few of these."
"Lemon yellow color and semi-transparent. Nice white head with good retention and lace. Floating yeast flakes. Yeasty aromas of banana and lemony hops. Honey sweetness in the flavor and smell. Live yeast flavors, citric hop character. Mellow and smooth flavors overall, well-rounded. Alcohol gets involved with a mild bite. Medium-bodied brew with plenty of carbonation. A little drying on the palate due to the hops. Also leaves a sticky sweetness on the lips. Highly drinkable and sessionable and the 7.5% alcohol is deceiving. Overall, a refreshing and well rounded saison."
"M/D: It has a rich mouthfeel, a tad creaminess to it, maybe a syrupy quality, but overall a good saison."
"D - This is a decent saison, but I think the body weighs it down a bit for drinkability when compared to others in the style. Mouthfeel aside - it's a fairly tasty beer with some interesting character. I don't know if I'd seek it out, but I sure wouldn't be disappointed with another opportunity to have one."
"Cheers!"
"Got this as an extra from geryeb624! Once again, mahalo nui!!! Still trying to expand my palate, saisons have been a hit and miss for me, but this was one of the hits! Pours a nice straw-yellow color with a thick white head that fades fairly quickly leaving little lacing. The aroma is of Belgian yeast with a fruity background. The taste is earthy and fruity with an ever so slight lemony zest. There are spicy peppery notes at the finish. The flavor lingers pleasantly in the mouth with a light mouthfeel and very light carbonation. I was pleasantly surprised with this beer and would gladly drink it again given the opportunity!"
"I will definetly drink more in the future."
"TMD: A little crisp pilsner maltiness softened by intensified bubblegum esters. The pineapple is a bit more subdued, but still noticeable. Incredibly refreshing. Some definite grassiness that comes in with the white pepper mid-palate and lingers into the aftertaste. A tad light on the carbonation for the style, but it's fine with me. I prefer just a little more, but I have never been a fan of the huge champagne-like carbonation. Pretty good stuff."
"Overall I thought this was a pretty good beer. I enjoyed drinking this beer. It had a nice flavor that was mellow and would go with a lot of foods. This is a beer I would drink while having a burger with the guys, or just enjoying some cheese and sausage during a game."
"D: I tried it, but probably won't buy this one again."
"I like this one, as I did there Abbey Ale offering. Appearance for this beer is gorgeous gold color with a gold tinted foam. Smell is of complicated swirls of fruits. Taste is almost like nectarines or pear with a wheaty finish. The beer is remarkably smooth and there isn't much notice of carbanation or alcohol burn. Yet another really good offering from Clipper City."
"Pours a beautiful hazy yellow orange color with a very small head formed. The lacing is non existent and the retention fades with seconds. Looks under carbonated. The aroma is fantastic. Real Belgian fruity spicy yeasty aromas typical of saisons. Also has a white pepper spiciness to it. The flavor is great too. Really dry, spicy and floral at the same time. Leaves the tongue very dry and tingly. Has a spicy jalapeño pepper spiciness to it topped with white pepper and oranges. The mouthfeel isn't very good as it's under carbonated. Full bodied saison too which really offsets the style. Drinkability is fair as it's probably better with food considering the lack of bubbles."
"D: I could have more of this, but I probably wouldn't seek it out. However, if I bought another sampler from Clipper City Brewing, I would defiantly have this."
"Pours clear copper with a fluffy white head. The aroma is malty and conventional, with some light brown sugar and toast. The aroma is malty and tea-like, with a mouth puckering tannic bitterness. The flavor has toffee and brown sugar and a deeper hop bitterness behind it. The mouthfeel is tingly and very dry."
"Pours a cloudy golden with a thin white head. Not much retention and just a bit of laceing. Aroma is of sweet fruit and bready malts. Body is light to medium. Crisp,with some carbonation. Taste is of sweet bread and fruit,tangy finish. Very,very nice!"
"Fairly easy to drink but it's still very dry."
"I'm not crazy about this beer."
"Into a pint glass, it poured a golden orange, with one finger of white, decent retention, and decent lacing. Great citrus (lemon and apricot) nose, with spice and brett funk. The taste revealed some berry flavor as well, mixed with spice and citrus, and finished on a modest spice/peel note. Light- to medium-bodied, with a decent amount of carbonation. Refreshing alternative for the summer months."
"D: Not impressed. This is definitely a case where the sweetness (and possibly the ABV) is wayyy out of scale...not only in the beer in question, but also the style. I sure would hate to be laboring outdoors with this as a ""refreshment."""
"Pours a hazy, golden color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Slight retention and poor lacing. Smells of sweet malt, tart malt, yeast, pale hop, hint of wheat, and a hint of citrus. Fits the style of a Saison / Farmhouse Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of slight alcohol, tart malt, sweet malt, slight hop, slight citrus, and a hint of yeast. Overall, good aroma and blend, but lacking in body."
"Heavy Seas makes some nice brews and this is no exception, something to be proud of."
"Overall: had this twice now, don't think I will revisit ever again."
"D - ummm, this at best this is a mediocre Hefe...certainly doesnt have any of the good Saison qualities. too sweet and not nearly refreshing enough. ill pass."
"This is not a ""true"" saison per se but more of an American interpretation. The addition of Candi sugar makes this one a lot more sugary than the typical dry stylized saison. Nonetheless, this makes a fine Belgian Gold Ale which would border a triple in some folks' books. Refreshing, delicious, and mildly warming. I'll have to save a few of these for aging."
"Nicely balanced and drinkable. Not as spicy/interesting as other American takes on the style, but still a tasty and clean (doesn't overreach on the yeast) saison."
"I really like this ale. I think it is perfect summer. To hell with your basic summer wheat with a ton of citrus thrown in, this beats them in taste, complexity (and for me, price). I'm thinking that this would be a great breakfast beer with a quiche using swiss or fontiago cheese. Excellent brew!"
"D-this is a pretty tasty saison with some interesting things happening. the champagne flavors are interesting, the wild yeast has definitely added something to this. nice brew!"
"golden amber with a small head that doesnt leave much lacing. The smell is sweet. Lots of fruit, spices and nuttiness. The taste is rich of cherry and hazelnut. Cant taste much alcohol which is surprising for a light bodied beer with a 8% abv. Average mouthfeel and very drinkable. I enjoy this beer a lot, definitely recommend it."
"Drinkability: Full flavored and good for sipping; decent attempt at a Belgian beer"
"Notes: While not too remarkable it feels pretty good, and it is reliable. If anything the first thing that one misses is that while seemingly bottle conditioned it feels somewhat filtered and one longs for a bit of a stronger hazy/yeasty touch on the palate."
"Always suh-in' good on cask over at the CK. This nice li'l bit o' Maryland saison pours a thoroughly cloudy grapefruit yellow with a small bubbly head. Not to cast aspersions on things, but it looks as though some beastly urine is sitting in my glass. Yeah. Interestingly, I still really wanna drink it... The smell helps dig me out of this grave: lemon rind, coriander, wheat fields, and mandarin oranges comprise a zesty whiff. Nice, but lacking that hint o' funk that keeps a certain Mr. Clinton in business. (I mean, seriously, did you see him on Arsenio back in '92, rockin' that sax? No wonder that elder shrub got clocked...) Things stay pretty much unchanged when smell becomes taste (synesthesia not included), though some cardamom and OJ pulp (so long as it's not in my juice, I'm fine) join in the fun as well. In sum, a melange o' summery tastiness, light in body and carbonation, heavy on righteousness. Something like that. After seeing this brew in bottles at several stores, it's nice to finally put a face to the brown glass, especially in cask-conditioned form. Get some!"
"strong citrus-y nose, incredibly well bodied, i like this one very cold."
"D: I'd have another glass while sitting on my patio on a warm day."
"The way this drinks makes it very sessionable, although it doesn't pack the huge flavor punch or funkness of other saisons."
"Pours a hazy golden color with a thin white head that doesn't retain very well. The aroma has some hay and a little funk upfront, along with notes of pear and green apple, esters, biscuit, corriander, white pepper and a little honey. The flavor is fruity initially with notes of green apples, pears and honeydew melon, as well as some biscuit and hay, funky yeast, corriander and white peppercorn, a little honey and a touch of floral hops. The mouthfeel is light and sprightly, and drinkability is excellent. Very solid saison here, especially for the price."
"-had to bump up the drinkability a little because of my desire to drink another one of these on the spot..."
"Hazy golden in color.. Aroma is the expected farmhouse scent - bready & yeasty. Barn-funk yeastiness and astringency at first sip. Tasting some wheat flavor as well. Oily and mouth-coating. Quite refreshing; overall a fine summer sipper."
"Hits you with a half finger of bone white head which is short-lived, settles into a few scattered islands across the surface, curiously more stickiness to the lacing then first expected. Visually as much dilute orange as stronger yellow, excellent clarity and, in spite of the weak hue, has a glow which pleases the eye. The nose has an outdoorsy, natural character, you almost expect to drink it on an actual farm, big time clove, cinnamon, spiced orange and something like mulled cider, country style rye breadiness, the apple, pear, apricot fruit stays within itself even though the spiciness wants to tease out more tropical fruit nuances, waft of banana. Full-bodied for the style, hugs the curves of your mouth. Strikes a good balance between sweet and spicy, all that clove, coriander, ginger sweeps through, lees and raw bread dough, white pepper, then white grape, banana, peach, pear, cherry, apricot fruit. The carbonation perhaps adds too much fluff factor. The lemon, orange citrus a steadying influence throughout. Finish is sort of short but mouth perfume full enough to compensate. Nicely drinkable."
"Had this brew first time on tap at Capone's Norristown. It was poured into a chalice. It appeared to have a nice amber gold color. Smell was lacking, only slight yeast and spice. The taste was a great suprise! Not a traditional saison by any means but a pleasant escape. This ale is very sweet and has a almost bubblegum spice flavor to it. In terms of mouthfeel red sky at night is very smooth with subtle carbanation allowing it to glide across your taste buds nicely. This is such a unique brew I bought a sixer of it to go at the end of the night."
"The 8% ABV is so well hidden that it is scary. Very nicely done! I'm really surprised that the average is so low on this. For the style, it is excellent and very similar to Hennepin. Probably a bit sweeter, but very good. Defintely worth a try."
"D - Not a bad beer at all. Maybe I'm just used to drinking the phenomenal examples of saisons. By comparison, I find this one a bit dull and lifeless. The spiciness is good, but there is a drying off flavor in there that is spoiling it for me. The fruity and spicy flavors don't have a chance to shine...seems to bring out the malt more and dry things out."
"Overall, this is a very enjoyable beer, and I will definitely be seeking more of these out soon."
"Overall a decent beer, but uncomplex, and not really worth the effort to seek out."
"Drinkability:This is my favorite of the Heavy Seas line up. I love the sweet apple taste which is a bit sweet for the style. Want to buy a six as the ABV is well masked."
"This is my favorite of the ""Heavy Seas"" lineup. I'm not sure this would be considered a classic saison, but it is an enjoyable beer, nonetheless, with a nice balance between candy sugar and tart notes. Surpisingly drinkable for the relatively high abv."
"I enjoyed this one a lot, might have been my favorite out of the CC mix pack I got. This is one I will buy again."
"My first time ever trying a Belgian Saison/Farmhouse Ale. I was very much impressed with CC's offering. Poured cloudy, like a Wheat beer, with very minimal head. Incredibly, this beer smelled like...candy! The sweetness is because of the Belgian candi sugar that is used in making high alcohol beers to avoid creating a thick body. The scent took me back to childhood, but I couldn't put a finger on what treat it reminds me of. The taste is of citrus & wheat with a little alcohol bite in the finish. The mouthfeel is nice, not too thick, not too thin. The drinkability was fair as well. Overall, I discovered this interpretation of the Farmhouse style to be satisfying. I plan to try some more."
"Drinkability: An interesting beer of an under-represented style. Breaks a bit from the norm, and that's a good thing."
"Drinkability: An impressive beer and an interesting style. Very complex and certainly worth a try. I certainly wouldn't mind having this one again."
"Overall I thought this was a solid beer however it didn't quite have enough bite to be a very good saison. Worth a shot to decide for yourself."
"Review from notes taken on: 7/27/09."
"Morey's Bottom Line: Not a bad Saison. I could see drinking a few of these on a hot summer day. Not my favorite style, but well done none the less."
"A medium body with moderate carbonation, and very drinkable. I really enjoyed this beer and have had more than one on multiple occasions, despite the high alcohol."
"Poured a pale orange with one-finger head and minimal lace. A nice tart apple and pear fruit smell as some clove and pepper spices. A sharp tart fruit taste that is tucked in a light body that passes over smooth. Fruit flavors, while mild, include apple, pear and some tropical fruit. A little clove and pepper as well as minor sweetness from a little bit of caramel malt. While a basic saison this is easy to drink and very quaffable."
"Overall: My wife and I both really enjoy the flavor and experience of this beer. The best offering from Heavy Seas so far."
"Not my typical choice in beer but it is still a good."
"Drinkability: sour but refreshing, a really nice higher gravity saison ale."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some hints of yeast and cloves. Taste is good, yeast and cloves are there, as well as fruit and alcohol. Feels light in the mouth and has decent drinkability. Overall this is a pretty good brew."
"Good intro to the style, albiet not the best saison. A good seasonal from heavy seas and the mouthfeel is fine."
"Overall, I'll give it a drinkable meh."
"Overall, as a seasonal Clipper City brew, I won't be drinking this all summer, but I will definitely pick up at least two sixers to bookend the season in the future."
"Slight haze/sediment suspended in a medium golden body. Small, fizzy, off-white head. Not much lacing. Nose shows off a healthy amount of sweet tropical fruit, candied pears, yeast, and a mix of spices (juniper, grains of paradise, cloves?). Light hoppy bitterness up front. Toasted malt, hay, and wheat bread follow. Juicy fruits come through with sweetness. Sugary edge. Pears, bubble gum, and grapes before a spicy, earthy finish. Lingering fruit. Medium-bodied, with zesty carbonation. Not bad."
"Clean and distinct. Finishes very well and definately leaves room for more notable saisons, but all in all, a good show."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a rather small white head that disipated into a light ring. The aroma is of Belgian yeast, some banana, clove and pepper, and some candi sugar. Not much of any farmhouse funk aromas typical with saisons. The taste is very much like a BPA/BSPA. Pale malt with the spicy belgian yeast and candi sugar, some light bubble gum and banana flavors. The feel is light to moderate with fizzy carbonation, finishes with a candi sugar sweetness. This is a pretty good BPA/BSPA but the problem is that it is supposed to be a saison. The brew does not have many of the saison characteristics. No hay, horse blanket, or other farmhouse funk. I needed to rate it as a saison so it go lower marks but if it were labeled as a BPA/BSPA my grade would go up considerably. Oh well, still an enjoyable beer."
"Medium in body, with some substance. Highly viscous. Nice sipper on a crazy cool July afternoon."
"Overall: somewhat refreshing and satisfactorily complex, but not exactly what I was expecting. I wasn't blown away."
"Drinkability: At best a marginally passable, though not standout saison. It has a higher ABV% going for it, if that's your thing, but, if that is your thing, why not opt for a Fantome, as they do have some more boozy saison offerings."
"HV"
"CHEERS!"
"Overall, quite delicious and drinkable thanks to its light, dry, puckery character, but the relatively high alcohol content certainly manifests itself after the beer is finished, diminishing drinkability a bit. Definitely a nice summer offering that fits in with the typical wheat beer seasonals while breaking the mold at the same time."
"- Is very drinkable but a bit creamy and not so light like many others of the style are... although this is spot on for the style.. just not a huge fan of the yeast."
"Dr. Gack!"
"3.5/3.5/3.5/3/3"
"The beer is decent and drinkable - it just seems like it is missing something as far as taste goes. Decent brew. Alcohol is masked very well."
"Very clean finish, no aftertaste at all. A very drinkable beer, except it will knock you on your butt from the alcohol content which is not noticeable at all while drinking. Will definitely get this again, though--very tasty."
"This is the first saison I've reviewed, and while I do not have much experience with this style, I must say the flavor profile and the Belgian yeast quite suits my taste. Enjoyable and I know for a fact that the Heavy Seas series from Clipper City is quite reasonably priced. Definitely a beer to check out."
"D: The Heavy Seas series hasn't done much for me, and this did nothing to elevate my opinion of the series. In fact, it was so boring, I had to do a drain pour."
"Relatively dry, warm alcohol. Similar to the smell in that there is a sour finish. Not as flavorful as most saisons. In fact, it's pretty run-of-the-mill."
"D: you can tell the alc content on this is up there. I could have a few but I'd probably regret it later :)"
"Smooth flavor and mouthfeel reminds me of a carbonated juice. Very sweet. Not sure how I feel about this one. Easy to drink and the alcohol is masked appropriately. I have had most of the heavy seas collection and I must say they are quite tasty."
"This one's a good one to try, though the sneaky ABV limits the drinkability just a bit. It's brewed well enough to interest me in trying more from Clipper City."
"A light clear orange yellow pour with a big fluffy white head, lively carbonation. Aroma is lightly sweet and spicy,a bit of the funk,hints of apple. Flavor is very good, nice malty sweetness,honey,apple,pepper,clove,nice yeastyness,medium body,sharp bubbly mouthfeel,long finish with a spicy aftertaste,very sessionable."
"While the ABV is a bit high, I can definitely see this being a pleasant beer to slug back all day and all night. Something to buy a case of for a picnic."
"This beer pours a hazy copper color, with a one finger of foamy off white head. Decent head retention, leaving thick yet spotty lacing on the glass. Nose is of floral hops, spices - a bit of pepper, yeast, and some banana. Taste is citrus hops up front, with a definite yeast flavoring and a good deal of wheat in the middle. Finish then becomes a bit sweeter - some banana, sugar notes, and a touch of lemon at the very end. Mouthfeel is the lighter side of medium body, medium carbonation, crisp and clean finish to it. This is a highly drinkable beer."
"D: Light, refreshing, decent (though quickly fading) carbonation, very drinkable."
"the only thing this beer has going for it is the price $8 sixers but the beer doesnt bring all the flavors to the table or anything new"
"D: This is a wonderful saison that I'll be returning to again and again. It's brews like this that convince me never to move out of Maryland."
"For some reason, all of these features combine into a very drinkable package, another nice offering from Clipper City's Heavy Seas line."
"12oz bottle poured into a sam adams glass. This saison had a bright golden color with a nice head that went into a small cap. Not much lacing. Smells like a basket of fruit with apple and pear some belgian yeast and slight hops. Getting the same fruits in the taste also with some yeast and also bubblegum and candy. A step above light bodied with a crisp feel. I could go for this again."
"EDIT: just read on the neck label, it's a BELGIAN Farmhouse Ale. Brewed with Belgian yeast, and candy sugars. Nice...I'm digging it!"
"Very creamy, with only limited carbonation prickliness. Medium to full in body, it feels a bit heavy for a saison to me."
"There was little to no head on this beer and not much carbonation, however, I have had this in my fridge for a little while. Golden hazy appearance. Fruity and yeasty smells on first pour. Taste of spice, pepper, and fruit. Has somewhat of a belgian quality to it. Overall a pretty good saison."
"D:I could have a few of these, and this would pair well with a spicy Thai/Chinese/Asian dish."
"Note: Had this beer on cask again the other night at Max's (6/12/09), so maybe that indicates they will continue to make this version. I hope so. The red sky at night made with spices version is just terrific."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my New Belgium globe glass. This beer pours a shade or two lighter then straw, with just a speck of a white head that leaves just an inkling of lacing. I wish this beer had a better head, retention and lacing. The aroma is pretty typical of a Saison. Belgian candy sugar, clove, orange zest, pepper and big fluffy Grans biscuits. The flavor comes across as spicy. Big clove notes, cardamom, huge pineapple citrus, and white pepper mixed all together in a doughy bread. The mouthfeel is crisp and light bodied but finishes at about a perfect level of dryness. This is a really approachable Saison. I'm really glad to have had the opportunity to try it."
"The spice and apple come through in the flavor as well. Easy to drink and quite crisp. Easy to drink, this is a simple session beer - a nice take on a saison, not a traditional saison, but close, and worth it."
"I could probably drink a few of these in a night, but I could also see it being a bit sweet for my taste. I guess it would depend what kind of a mood I was in. Not a bad beer though, Clipper City delivers pretty well."
"Goes down smoothly."
"D: Very impressed by this one. I like what Clipper City does with its Heavy Seas line. A robust, adventurous line of beers with an extremely reasonable price tag. This is the standout of the Heavy Seas line in my opinion."
"The taste is very sweet, possibly a litte overly sweet, it destroys the subtle flavors that I associate with a saison. Overall it's a very inexpensive beer with a deceptive alcohol content that I could drink almost any day. I think that clipper city should make this a regular heavy seas offering as it's waaaayy better than the uber pils."
"Buy this now. Buy it often, Saison copies should follow..."
"This beer will be in heavy rotation throughout the season for sure."
"D. This is an easy drinking brew for an easy saturday afternoon. Good flavors, this one is a pleasant surprise."
"If you are looking for a Saison with a bit more kick than most, I think this might be the right one for you. Enjoyable."
"Drinkability: Tastes good, relatively high ABV might prevent me from indulging more, but I would be able to have a couple of these with no problem. Recommended"
"Drinkability - Very drinkable, though a little sweet which limits the sessionability. Alcohol is very well-masked."
"4.0 D: This is a good beer. Wouldn't mind drinking again."
"D - A nice, flavorful Saison with a great aroma. It looks like shit, but makes up for it with a great yeast character. The only flavor flaw is the slightly unpleasant phenolic character in finish. For some reason, I have neglected the Clipper City beers up to this point, but after trying this one I'll have to give them some more attention."
"This is a strange beer; it's better than the scores I gave it."
"Light honey blonde with a fluffy fine white head that leaves beautiful fine lace on the glass. Tons of suspended yeast particles in the body. Nice fruity yeast, cloves and apple cider come to mind. Smells Belgian. Tastes mild and fruity, overripe fruit with a nice funky sourness in the mostly dry finish. Medium bodied and highly quaffable for the style."
"Original notes from: 10/11/04 with additions from the bottle over time."
"My first stab at this style, a little odd if you ask me. Tastes very Belgian-like to me.. reminds me a lot of all the Unibroue beers I tried. Weird appearance to it.. light orange/yellow color with lots of floating sediment... but the sediment doesn't move at all and just hangs motionless, suspended. Very spicy smell and taste to it. One of the spiciest beers I've ever tried really. While I can't say it goes down smooth exactly, for 8% ABV it doesn't taste like it at all. Glad I tried it but not sure if this style is for me."
"Poured a golden amber from a 12 oz. bottle. Lively head forms quickly, but dissipates quickly; leaves minimal lacing down the glass. Much yeast floating in the glass, more than most. Smelled more of grass, fruits, hops, but some sourness as well. Taste was nice, but more sour than what I look for in a Saison. Taste I found very similar to the Fantome variety more than the Dupont variety. Mouthfeel was average. Drinkablity for me is limited, as I prefer my Saisons a little drier and less sweet/sour than this one."
"Tastes of mild wheat into pepper spiciness. Heavy spice finish. Some orange syrup. A campfire brew? My first saison...I think I'm all set with this style, pirates and all."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable and would definitely recommend."
"Pours a nice cloudy golden pale yellow color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger foamy white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. Then nose is malty, with some yeast, and bananna/coriander. The taste is malty/yeasty, very nice spice balance. Medium body. Drinkable, I like this one, not as much spice as other Saison I've had in the past."
"(rated Jul 28, 2007)"
"Pours a clear golden orange color with a foamy white head that settles into a thin lace. Fruity aroma with hints of apple, pear, cloves, spice, banana and bread. Very crisp and quaffable with golden fruit flavor (apple, pear banana), spice, cloves, bread, cherries and strawberry."
"Drinkability - I just dont think the Saison style is for me. I did not get any enjoyment from this beer. Just not my taste I guess, I would not try this one again."
"D: Pretty strong showing. This is one multi-faceted and tasty brew which keeps me coming back for the positive reward."
"D - Looks and smells good, and tastes pretty decent too. However, the flabby mouthfeel and crummy finish make this one fall apart."
"In fairness I will give this one another try. Maybe my bottle was just a dud. It's a good beer but I was hoping for more. I do like the Heavy Seas line of beers in general. If my next Red Sky at Night experience is great, I'll gladly change my review in accordance."
"Buy this beer and love it while you can. It's unique and delicious."
"Lightly hazed and a bright yellow with a thin ring and skim of white bubbles after the fizzy cap settled. Nice aroma, spicy up front with cereal grain and lemon, a little floral and fruity too. Mild bitterness with fruit and spice throughout, some citrus zest. Slight banana and higher alcohol character as it warmed, but not enough to throw it out of balance. Medium bodied with average carbonation, very smooth texture with a bit of dryness at the end. Pretty tasty."
"A nice summertime beer that hits the spot after a long run or some outside labor. This one isn't as rich as a Belgian ale but has a lot of the same characteristics. Quite refreshing with the perfect amount of carbonation a good balance of malts to hops to fruitiness and a nice semi sweet slightly dry finish."
"D: I was hoping as this warmed a setled on my pallate that it would get better, and it actually has a tiny bit but not as much as I was hoping. A really good beer though. Try her on for size, she'll fit nicely."
"Bottle marked to be consumed by 11/08. Smells like a fruit bouquet of cherry and maracuya with hints of mango and plum and of course, yeast. Pours to a cloudy golden red with lots of structure. Taste is slighty acidic, sweet yet sour with a good hearty mouthfeel. Om the finish the mouthfeel is silky, my guess due to the AC. The finish taste is is spicy and slighly bitter. Overall it leaves a fruity taste lingering. Complex and hearty. A good offering."
"I like this beer. It is different from the ""traditional"" saisons, but a very nice beer to drink."
"Golden colored, relatively thick white head. Sweet fruity, vanilla, yeasty aroma. Fairly strong. Vanilla, cream and banana flavors in the taste with a sharp alcohol note in there. A full-bodied refreshing type of summer beer although the abv in this limits that a bit."
"4/4/4/3/4"
"D - A decent saison, even if a little heavy."
"Overall this beer is more tripely than saisony. It's very good and I would have scored it higher if the label stated tripel, but based on the saison nameplate I gave it this less enthusiastic review. My least favorite so far from the Heavy Seas line-up, but really all of them have been good beers."
"Pours a very nice golden color with good head, nice lacing, and quite a bit of carbonation. Very nice scent, some clove tones and a nice maltiness, along with a slight pepper aroma. Excellent taste, some nice banana and clove tones, along with a fantastic honey flavor, with a nice spicy ending; very well balanced between malts and hops. Goes down quite well for a higher ABV, with just a bit of roughness from the carbonation. Nicely done!"
"drinkability - Easy drinking beer, I think it was ok for a Saison beer."
"This is another relatively good beer in the Heavy Seas line, but line the other non-hoppy beers, this one could use some refinement to sharpen the flavors and increase the complexity. What you do get here is a creamy assortment of farmhouse spices, fruity Beligan esters and touch of light malt flavor - so all in all a tasty brew. It does sit a bit heavy for the style and isn't nearly as refreshing as other saisons, like Dupont. Still worth a try though for something different."
"D: Much better examples out there and honestly not worth the price of a 6 pack, and only barely worth the price of a loosie. Overall less then moderate drinkability and enjoyment,"
"I got 3 bottles of this from a gift membership to the ""Microbrew of the Month"" club."
"As the weather begins to gradually become warmer, I find myself looking for those special spring time seasonal beers. I came across this saison at my favorite shop, eager for something that cried sunshine I quickly grabbed a sixer. Poured a very colorful light orange almost copper color into my glass, the steady carbonation quickly produced a thick creamy head. The lacing is moderate, and the head soon diminished to a thin yet creamy layer. I was pleasantly surprised at the presence of the lacing and head considering the higher alcohol content. As this beer warmed up a bit the aroma really took off. A mixture of semi-sweet malts and hoppy bitterness dominate the overall scent which is accented with an earthy affect that I found extremely appealing. The flavor is right in line with the aromas that are given off. Malty and considerably hoppy the flavor is complex at first but gives way to a simplicity that is difficult to explain. There is a peppery flavor that seems to lead to hints of citrus and cloves. The mouthfeel is fresh. The malts create a smooth finish that is surprisingly full. I really started to enjoy this saison once it warmed up a bit. The high ABV only made it's presence known as I exhaled, a real nice effect. Truly an enjoyable beer, and a great cure for spring fever."
"If I didn't know any better, I would believe this to have come from Belgium. Very nicely done! An enjoyable brew!"
"Clipper City's Heavy Seas series has produced some interesting beers. Not all of them are spot-on style-wise, but they're all pretty tasty. This one comes closer to the real deal than I expected, and though it's not quite as transcendent as the best authentic Belgians in this category, it should most definitely be sought out and savored."
"This poured a rather uninteresting gold with a white head that dropped to nothing fairly quickly; but the smell is good, light and refreshing with sweet summer fruits (peaches and apricots maybe) that make up for the unexceptional appearance. The taste is good. Its light and fruity with enough complexity to keep you looking forward to the next sip. This is a great summer beer to enjoy after you've been working outside, but your done for the day and ready to kick back (which is what I am doing now). Its refreshing and easy to drink, yet its got enough backbone too."
"The fruity spicieness is awsome in this beer. Very delicious. Would have liked some laceing."
"This one pours a hazy gold with minimal head and lacing. I expected much more lacing and head when comparing to its Belgian counterparts. Smells like hay spice and slight fruitiness. The taste is much of the same with a slight bitterness in the aftertaste. There is also a bready flavor that clings to the tongue. The body is light to medium with prickly CO2 hitting the tongue. This one is very drinkable and quite refreshing. I would definitely seek out again."
"Pours a slightly hazed yellowy/orange color, off-white head fades rather quickly, spotty lacing left behind. Smell is Belgian yeast, some lemon, some pear. Taste is tart citrus, more juicy pear, a light peppery taste. Tightly carbonated, dry, nice tartness... mouthfeel is just slightly thin, but it all comes out to a really refreshing brew. I'll definitely be picking more of this up in the future."
"Mouthfeel is nice perhaps aided by bottle conditioning. Drinkability is good due to lightness"
"This little soda pop of a drink is extremely mild and drinkable."
"Pretty fun beer, but it's more of a good wit (or double-wit) than a Saison."
"Red Sky pours a beautiful hazy orange color with a big white head that disappears pretty quick but leaves lots of sticking and a thin layer of foam. The carbonation is very visible and abundant in a Corsendonk tulip. Big fruity saison nose, lots of apricot, peach and melon notes with a touch of hops and sweet malts. Much is the same with the way the brew tastes, big and fruity, clean flavor transitions and bright. A bit of spice begins and is followed heavy with big apricot and apple fruit, subtle candy sweet malts lay underneath it all followed by a tangy hop bitterness on the finish. Not as funky or rustic as i prefer in a saison but a damn good beer never the less. It sports a medium body with a slightly coating/creamy mouth feel, some stickiness to the lips. Good beer, worth a shot if spotted!"
"Poured a hazy golden yellow. Low head but good retention. My first of the Heavy Seas since I live in Colorado and they aren't sold here. I am getting a tartness in the taste and a bit of warming in the throat. Creamy mouthfeel which is odd to me for this style. Not unenjoyable but not my favorite version of a saison. Not a bad beer and this style is so broad it's hard to pin down. More of a personal preference."
"This certainly isn't the best of the Heavy Seas offerings. A very mediocre beer. I like the attempt to make a bigger abv saison but unfortunately I don't think it's done terribly well. Southern Tier's Imperial Cherry Saison is a much better example of an amped up saison."
"Not sure on Saison style since this is my first one, but for sitting on my porch on a hot afternoon this beer was certainly a winner."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Light in mouthfeel, at least it is perceived that way. Carbonation is light as well as the color of the brew, so you've already got an impression that this is going to be light on the palate, this perception makes it much more so. I like to think that it is toward the lighter side, however, when I just think about how it feels on the tongue, it is much heavier and fuller than any light beer should be. You can just feel that thick malty sweetness pushing down on the palate. Overall good feeling. This is one I'd not be ashamed to pick up again, however if I really want a Saison, I'll be fetching Fantome. This is a decent beer, but after drinking Fantome I've been spoiled."
"As for the taste, this is a flawed Belgian. There is the candied sugars, the sweet malts, and the spices in the finish, but the beer is a touch watery and not making enough of a statement with what is there in its ingredients. Worse, there is an unpleasantness in the finish, tasting a bit like wet cardboard. There is too much of a throaty burn to this beer as well, which shouldn't be the case with a 7.5 ABV. The beer is leaving me quite unfulfilled."
"Wine Specialist/$10.99/12 oz Sixer"
"12oz bottle purchased for $10.99 for a sixer at Bauer Wines in Boston. Pours a clear light gold with lots of carbonation and head. Decent lacing. No sediment seen, regardless of what the label says. Very nice Belgian yeasty, spicy aroma. The first taste provides a surprising smooth mouthfeel without the expected bite from the spices and carbonation. As it goes down the throat, the spicy bite kicks in. However, the flavour is lacking something."
"Overall I wasn't impressed. I was hoping for something more. If I see this in a bottle, I will pick it up to try to get a better experience."
"Not half bad, but not groundbreaking. I love all things Belgian - the complexities imparted by the yeast strains are always fantastic - so I perhaps graded this one a little tougher than I normally would, and my score doesn't really do it justice. Comparing it to other saisons I've had (Hennepin, Dupont), it pales a little, but it's still a really tasty beer. Reduce the carbonation profile just a bit and enhance the aroma ever so slightly, and this beer would be great."
"($2.10, 12oz, Oliver's Bev., Albany, NY)"
"D: Good at the beginning but not much depth. I enjoyed this one the first time but the second had me desiring a bit more. A bit too much spiciness. A descent saison but could be improved upon."
"D: I rather enjoyed this brew. It's just different enough that it was nice to try something off the beaten path but by the same token, not something I would want to drink all the time. Well done. I would suggest it to any of my friends capable of handling something other than an American macro and to anyone in the craft beer world. Nice job!"
"I'm diggin' the flavor...nice blend of belgian yeasts, citrus fruit, and some spicy, grassy hops on the finish. Mouthfeel is a bit thin and undercarbonated, but overall it's refreshing and very drinkable for those summer days. Definately a brew I'll be picking up again."
""
"D- i've been really impressed with everything from the heavy seas line thus far. i advocate the imperialization of nearly any style and i feel it's the best way for american brewers to put their own mark on foreign tradition. bigger and bolder, without really trying to 'copy'. i have no problem finishing this beeeatch and in many ways it rivals the likes of hennepin and festive ale."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into 20oz Harp pint glass. Beer poured a nice hazy golden orange/amber. One finger head diminishes quickly. Slight pepper, and orange citrus fruit on the nose. Slight farmhouse funk on the tongue, mid-taste dominated orange and a nice light sweetness. Pepper becomes apparent in the finish Alcohol is completely hidden, but will sneak up on you. Mouthfeel is one of the high points. Very complex, carbonation plays a nice part in overall taste. Slight cloying sweetness. Nice dry finish. Very enjoyable. I look forward to this seasonal."
"Edit: I forgot to mention. The alcohol is well hidden. I'd have never guessed that this is 8%abv."
"Body is to big and sticky, slick. I prefer a light fluffy, expansive mouthfeel in a Saison. It also loses carbonation quickly. Still very drinkable and inexpensive compared to other Saisons."
"On a day with 105 degree heat, this hit the spot."
"As a side note this was my favorite beer at the Philly Beer Week Real Ale Festival this past March. It was quite refreshing on cask."
"Poured a hazy orange with a nice cream head that leaves spotty lacing. Sweet malt, spice and yeast dominate the aroma with a hint of floral hops. The taste is a complex blend of spices and fruits, wonderful initial, just slightly cloying in the finish. The beer is relatively light and very crisp with just the right amount of carbonation. I have to say, this is one of the best American-made Saisons I've had yet."
"pours a cloudy golden yellow w/ a thin whitehead which never fully dissipates leaving a decent lacing in my snifter ; a steely, bready malt smell w/ some hints of fruit and alcohol ; a crisp slightly tart flavor, mostly a cereal grain and coriander-like taste w/ some fruits and earthy hops underneath, a semi-dry finish ; a med. body on this one, lots of co2, could be a tad drier & lighter, though ; a pretty good beer, very drinkable for a 7.5% ABV brew..."
"D: Tasty, goes down quite easily, not filling at all, good kick, good representation of style, this is a very nice refreshing beer to drink for a long time."
"Served in my Delirium Tremens tulip. Poured a translucent honey-gold. Half-inch, loose, off-white head quickly dissipated into a thin skim of foam and tiny ringlets with a foam band that coalesced around the perimeter of the glass. Solid sheet of watery lacing appears during each tilt of the glass. Scent of belgian yeast and spice as well as candy sugar; perhaps some green apple and pear. Taste is more reminiscent of a belgian strong pale, rather than a saison. Somewhat sweet, with a honey-like character. Candy sugar is still present, but light fruit flavors are a little less defined (still going with green apple and pear). Mouthfeel starts out as light-bodied, but slightly oily with a little bit of effervescence across the front to middle of the tongue. More sweet and spicy, than pucker at the finish. Drinkabiity is fair. I found the brew cloyingly sweet at times, which would have been a little more tolerable if there was a little more carbonation to balance this out."
"D: Enjoyable, even though it comes off a bit like a saison-light."
"D: Very good another solid offering by Clipper City / Heavy Seas."
" Nose is sweet apple, yeast, and pear. Taste is a mild wild yeast, sweet fruit, quite gentle. More fruity and wild flavors come out upon warming. Mouthfeel is almost milky/creamy, which is odd for a saison. It's still nice though, and has a sharp tang on the end. Pretty drinkable. Almost sessionable, despite the 8% alcohol."
"Purchase Before: SEP 08"
"It was drinkable. i wouldn't seek this one out again, but it wasn't bad."
"M/D - Crisp, light, not so overpowering like some other Saisons."
"D - Very drinkable, but quite strong. Be careful with this one. Flavours are nicely melded and nothing overwhelms. I really like this one a lot."
"Eric"
"cheers"
"M/D: Mouthfeel could be improved. It's a little too heavy on the tongue for a saison, I feel. Carbonation is too light. Drinkability is so-so, not a bad beer, but not a very good saison."
"Very drinkable, good spring/summer beer"
"D: Well masked alcohol. Tasty beer with plenty of flavor but light enough on the palette to have a few. I would drink this again."
"After having one of these, I don't really plan to have another, so the drinkability takes a hit."
"D: 8% is very well hidden. There's a little alcohol zing hidden behind the spice hops and potent yeast but it's easily missed. Drinks easy and is great on a very warm day like today."
"It was drinkable because there wasn't much flavor. If it wasn't for the high alcohol content, this would be a great beach beer."
"Bottled beer, best purchased by Aug 08 on the label. Poured into a tulip glass, this beer was a hazy light orange color with a teeny head. It had a candy aroma, and smelled a little yeasty. Pretty muted aroma. The taste was mostly sweet, couldn't really tell much else. Thin mouthfeel. Not much of a saison."
"D: This is a fairly drinkable beer, but I don't think it's as strong as Ommegang's Hennepin or others of the style. Still, a worthy brew."
"Red Sky at Night pours a golden color with a nice bubbly head. The aroma has some phenolic character, some chalky, dry yeast and light sweet malt. The sweet pilsner malt hits first in the flavor, followed by the estery yeast profile. There is a slightly peppery spicy finish with just a hint of alcohol. Man this is a damn good beer. It's crisp and smooth, and remarkably easy drinking for its strength. Once again I'm impressed with Clipper City, I'd like to see their regular offerings around here."
"The funny thing about this beer and the Barbar beer, is that Barbar is called ""the rest of the warrior", and Red Sky has the ""rest of the pirate"" logo."
"Decent stuff... Worth a try..."
"fairly clear straw yellow with a white head that fades rather quickly. hay, pale malt, sweet malt, banana, corriander and some clove in the nose and taste. fairly well balanced, and noticably better than last year's attempt, but in my opinion, this is just another american knock off version of my favorite style of beer. the barnyardiness seems to be contrived. no true earthiness or horse shit smells that a real saison has. too much cloviness, and not quite enough (or maybe just not the proper type of) hop. kind of like hennepin, this is a good entry level saison, but nowhere near dupont or any of the delicious fantome saisons. i do appreciate clipper city trying to keep a dying style alive, and i am a fan of thier beer, so extra points for that. keep trying america."
"Taste is rich, fruity with hints of spice at the end. Wow, this is an outstanding beer. Its just so well rounded. It starts out sweet and just finishes in a way that makes me think its an imported Belgian saison but yet so much fresher. Served cool, its a very, very drinkable beer. I love all the flavors the Red Sky at Night imparts; spices, yeast and dark fruits. This is an excellent beer. These Heavy Seas beers keep on impressing me!"
"Red Sky At Night pours a medium golden with a finger of thick, durable white foam that spiderwebs the Yankees pint glass. Apricot, peach and clove tease the nose, though I'd really enjoy a more prominent aroma. The taste brings it all home very well, balancing the sweet fruit with spicy cloves, and I dare say a dash of pepper--really delicious. Creamy smooth and bubbly, this is another winner from Clipper City, a brewery to which I've really warmed up. Well within the boundaries of the style, but well worth remembering and snagging. Recommended without question or reservation."
"This poured a clear light straw color with white head. It smelled like lemon and honey mixed with yeast. It had a strong flavor of lemon hops and wild yeast, but nothing else to add any depth. It was thick with noticeable carbonation and a strong lemon aftertaste. Overall this was a fairly typical light Belgian ale, which is one of my least favorite types of ale."
"It's a somewhat honey golden color, but the slight haze gives it an almost Miller High Life deep corn yellow look that one can glimpse through the 40 oz. bottle. But that is just a color, an observation - not a judgment. The head is mostly white dying quickly. Aromas are mostly phenolic - bubblegum, banana with a hint of spice (coriander?) a little tart wheat, some alcohol and light sweet malt all in very good balance. Faint lemon grass on the flavor mixed in the same flavors from the above aromas. Medium-full body, and a pleasant soft malty quality on the sweet, spiced and warming finish. This is cotton candy, but better. This finally tastes like Saison. I would definitely keep a sixer of this on hand for gorgeous late spring/ early summer mornings. Morning paper on the porch in a hammock."
"Pours a nice clear, medium straw color with huge, dense brilliantly white head. Tons of clove in the aroma, a little too much for this style, a little floral citrus, but really, that clove is too much. Some slight, sour funk is there too but overall, aroma is not appropriate for a saison. On the palate, I'm first slammed by sweet, stick clove scented raisins. In addition there are some light malty, bready notes finishing with plenty of fruity esters and a touch of spicy hops. Residual spiciness is left in my mouth along with the persistent sweetness. Overall, there's a lot left to be desired from this beer. Saisons can be strong, but they must be refreshing, and this one has too high a FG and low a carbonation to be refreshing. Call is a Belgian Strong or Blonde ale, but not a saison."
"Overall this was excellent and possibly my fav from HS."
"Poured with no head and a pale straw yellow. The smells was a little fruity at first and then turned to bananas and yeast as it warmed. First taste had the fruity taste as well, then changed to breads and grainy flavors. Medium mouthfeel which leaned toward the heavy side. Very drinkable in my opinion, the ABV could sneak up on you though ringing in at 8%"
"Pours a five-finger white head that fades quickly leaving some lace. Clear pale amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Barnyard funky nose. Flavor is sour apple and lemon, lingering sour finish. Mellows as it warms. The higher ABV is not noticeable. $1.75 for a 12 oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Nice beer, not as aggressively sour as some saisons/farmhouse ales. Not a huge fan of the style, but this I like and expect many hop fans to be able to enjoy."
"Drinkability- Nothing to see here. I'll pass on this again."
"Crystal clear, with a small but dense head, which lingers, leaving scant lacing on the glass. Aroma is spicy, fruity with notes of pepper. Fruit is mostly candied citrus, followed closely by some soft clove and white pepper. Flavor is sweet and spicy, with notes of cardamom backed by some phenols. Finish is spicy and peppery. Body is on the low side of medium."
"Drinkability: the alcohol never becomes overbearing on this beer. Easy drinking and rather light and refreshing."
"Just the right amount of spice and sweetness for a late nightcap after hard physical work. Good aroma and lasting head, light colour. A fine saison. Magnum and Goldings hops. I hadn't realized this was out for about 3 years, and picked it up this year."
"D - It was a little different from what I'm normally used to but it was good"
"Pours a medium golden color topped by a creamy white head. Decent lacing is left on the glass. Great cream soda and slight fruity aroma with a touch of spiciness. Very appealing. Flavor is a little light. Notes of coriander mixed with vanilla and a slight bitter edge. Light bitter orange flavor comes in on the finish. Finish has a lingering metallic note that's a bit distracting. Mouthfeel is solid yet nicely effervescent. Drinkability is OK, but this beer just doesnt have me wondering where I should buy more. I don't think I'd pass on one if it was offered to me, but I also dont, think I'd buy it either."
"Beer poured a hazy golden huge into my tulip glass with a slight white head. The nose is of citrus, sweet and slightly funky as well. The taste is sweet and citrusy with a lemon and orange taste. Easy on the taste buds and perfect for a summer taster."
"Slight alcohol warmth as it settles in your tummy and nice clean aftertaste of the malt and fruits."
"Overall- A decent offering. Worth a try."
"This Saison offering from Clipper City pours a clean golden color, lots of carbonation trails rise to a meager head that drifts to splotches. No lace. Smell is sweet and yeasty. A bit of citrus fruit as well. Interesting. Taste is again yeasty, sweet malts, finished very sour. Not appealing at all. Any notes of the yeast and sweet malts get dominated by the sourness after a few tastes. Mouthfeel is bleh, the sourness ruins this brew for me. I see myself offering my remaining brews to a friend."
"Not a bad brew , but a saison..??? I dunno."
"Pours a clear pale gold, with minimal head which dissipates quickly. Bottle says yeast is in there but was expecting something cloudy. Smell was slightly grassy, but the spiciness is what really jumps out. Taste was the high point for this beer, which is always a good thing. Was slightly earthy and again, the spiciness comes through. Light-bodied and for the most part, a pretty easy to drink brew. Worth a try."
"This beer demonstrates solid complexity, and is quite drinkable despite the somewhat high ABV. A solid America version of the style."
"Fairly clean finish, with a lingering alcohol aftertaste, ever so slight. Even so, you could enjoy a couple."
"An interesting, ""busy"" pour--hazy golden straw in color with some active carbonation and a heap of perfectly-suspended sediment. The nose is full and complex with assertive yeast and spice, particularly clove. Fruity notes, particularly lemon, are present too. The taste starts with a crush of tart fruit (reminding me most closely of dried tart cherries), quickly sharing space with yeast-tinged spice. Alcohol warmth highlights the finish. Though a soft sweetness lingers long, the mouthfeel is wonderfully light without being watery. Solid drinkability for a beer with so much going on."
"Cheers!"
"This is a very nice American saison. I will certainly be tempted to taste some of the other Clipper City offerings after sampling this."
"Overall this is a good saison and one of the best American takes on the style."
"A real quality brew, that I could session easily. (if it wasn't 8%!)"
"Poured into my Hennepin glass. It looks great. Pale yellowish-orange glow. Hazy with a 1/2 inch head that slowly settles. As I hold it up to the light I notice some of the haze is actually a suspension of what appears to be yeast byproduct, or orange peel. Mellow yeast, sticky sweet orange peel, maybe some ginger or coriander. Predominantly citrusy at the first sip. Smooth, as if each sip is coated with a layer of wax. As I drink more the spicy earthiness starts to come through along with the floral hop presence. The mouthfeel is a little bit flat. I like my Saisons to have a crispy fizz of carbonation to keep it lively and raw. Although strong, this is a fairly drinkable beer. The alcohol is well covered up, the flavor is full and complex, and it is a seasonal release adding a little excitement to it."
"Heavy Seas - Red Sky at Night (Saison Ale) pours a golden yellow color with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. In the aroma there is some fruit, and the candy sugar is evident as is the wheat malt. Taste is pretty good, fruit is noticeable, this is clearly brewed with Belgian yeast. It doesn't have the depth of flavors or character that a truly world class saison has, but it is a very drinkable, very enjoyable interpretation."
"Another flavorful offering from Clipper City. Flavors are unified and interesting. A little on the sweet side but still quite enjoyable."
"although could be better"
"Pours a light amber color. Clear and clean looking, with a nice foamy white head on top. Some traces of lace are left along the glass sides as the beer recedes, but otherwise it's an unremarkable looking beer. Crisp fruity/spicy aroma. Some banana and pear, and maybe the faintest hint of clove? Pleasing scent, but again, nothing remarkable. The taste is nice. Clean up front, and almost a tad watery, with the spices and hops really emerging midway and finishing the palate off the rest of the way. Leaves a clean, bitter spice aftertaste. Mouthfeel is smooth and dry. Starts and finishes very clean. This saison is certainly not the best example of the style, but it's a very quaffable spring/summer brew. The 8% ABV is masked well, and could very easily sneak up on you if you're not careful. Worth seeking out if you've never tried it before, and a solid addition to my seasonal repertoire."
"Let me begin by saying this is not a very good representation of the style at all. It poured a golden straw colour with a white head the vanished in seconds. Crystal clear, this was bereft of any sediment or even a touch of cloudiness. A far, far cry from what any respectable saison looks like. Smell, while mildly spicy and yeasty, didn't exhibit the typical saison profile, and more closley resembled a hefe than anything else. Smell was, however, closer to where should be than the appearance. Taste was mildly sweet with some very suble spice. I hesitate to give this even average, but do so in lieu of there being a 2.75. This was a very poor example of the style, however, I will say that I was stunned to learn that this was 8,0%, as it drinks, well, well, below that. Glad I tried it to satisfy my curiosity, but I won't be ordering this again."
"The beer pours a gold color with a 1/2"" white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice pale malt scent along with a wondeful yeast ester aroma. It has an excellent clove quality to it. The taste is decent. It has a solid malt flavor that boasts of pale and Munich malts. It goes down easy and finishes a bit sweet with a nice fruity yeast touch. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking beer, but not the best example of a Saison that I've tasted."
"I love heavy seas, Loose Cannon and Uber Pils, but they missed the shore with this one. 1. overly sweet 2. not complex 3. No earthy quality 4. not a dry finish. If this beer was called sweet sally ale I give it good marks. It drinks alright if you have a sweet tooth for the night. And considering this comes in a 6 pk. for $8.99 at 8% abv. it's still is a bargain. If your waiter ask you for desert grab one instead of that peice of cake."
"Thank you Harry for sharing this one that's been on my want list for some time..."
"12oz bottle poured into a tulip glass. Pours a clear orangish yellow color with a white head. The slightly tart aroma features some citrus, spices and belgian yeast. The taste is sweet malt with some spices and fruit. Overall, this is a decent attempt at a saison, but it is lacking in many areas compared to it's belgian brothers overseas. Not bad, but not recommended as there are many better saisons out there."
"I say try at your own risk on this one so far."
"Drinkability: A tasty beer, but flawed, in my judgement; the carbonation and mouthfeel are clearly not Belgian and the flavor is more like a Belgian Strong Pale than a Saison; nevertheless, I am scoring it not to style but to my tastebuds and I enjoyed drinking this beer"
"Drinkability- Very drinkable, this is my favourite Heavy Seas/Clipper City beer that I have had on tap, and out of the bottle.. It's a toss up. I like Winter Storm and Hop cubed an awful lot as well. But this is one that I will revisit again sometime for certain."
"Overall - a solid interpretation of the style. Use of sugar keeps the body fairly light and the overall profile refreshing. Could be a bit bolder and more complex with the spice, could be drier, and could be more carbonated. However, these slight style flaws probably enhance the drinkability."
"D- I think it is good but really not a saison. I would say it is more of a Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Has to sweet of malts and not the classic saison flavors. I do really like it though just not a saison."
"12oz brown bottle purchased as part of a multi-pack at Florians. Translucent yellow-amber body with a good half inch of off-white head. Smells fruity, nutty and spicy (nutmeg, cinnamon?). Apricot, nut, and spice play equal parts in the flavor. While the sweetness can be overwealming at times, it's still pretty tasty, and there is no alcohol flavor and no real flaws to speak of. Medium creamy body. A solid brew, though unlike most saisons I've encountered."
"The mouthfeel is very light, almost thin. Light bubble carbonation wraps the tongue at first and leave an alcohol burn on the end. Definitely drinkable, and a great session beer."
"Simply not a great Belgian, gold pour with a white head, decent amount of different smells coming out, banana, cloves other fruit and spicy hop aroma. The taste is dry and all over the place, could be held together better. Goes down alright enough but a dingy aftertaste lingers, not the kind that makes you want to keep drinking but the kind that makes you want to stop. Passable beer but there are many better for the price."
"Pours a clear golden yellow with a small white head. The head left almost no lacing. The color is light without the usual Saison carbonation. The smell has clove,banana,lemon,wheat, candy sugar,and other Belgian spices. The taste is like the smell, lots of lemon,wheat,clove, candy sugar,and honey. Not bad,but nothing special. The m/f is light with all flavors mixing well enough. A decent beer.Nice try at the style by Clipper City,but if I want a Saison I'm going with a Belgian."
"Mouthfeel was spritzy. Medium/full bodied. This is not one I will return to. I have yet to find a Clipper City beer I really enjoy."
"Wonderfull ... wonderfull beer."
"Pours a light golden color, slightly hazy from yeast pour but otherwise very clear. One and a half finger head fizzles out quickly and doesn't leave much lace if any at all. Mild apple and citrus fruit aromas with a background wild yeast scent. Flash of pale malt sweetness and pilsener flavor upfront, then a restrained brett. character takes over. Slightly medicinal with a mellow sour-tartness, this is well-balanced against the subtle cidery ester taste and faint noble hops that are presented in the dry aftertaste. Medium-bodied wih a low carbonation. The brett. dries the mouthfeel and also gives it a crispness to combat the threat of cloying from the ester and high gravity malt. Finishes soft with no residual sugar but not overy dry; and the farmhouse flavor does not linger too much. The high drinkability and inviting mouthfeel make this a good intoduction the style; albiet a weak example."
"Poured a golden yellow, with decent carbonation and the signature Saison snow white head. Aroma was hoppy spice, and the taste was more of the same. This had all the characteristics of a Saison, but all just muted. Unlike others Ive had where the nose and taste jump out at you, I had to work much harder to detect the Saison style here. Not a bad drinkimng beer, just not nearly as good as many other Saisons."
"This is the first saison that I've tried.. had it on tap at the Boulevard Woodgrill in Arlington. Poured a nice, cloudy, orange-red tinted body, with a good creamy one-inch foam head. Light in carbonation, but full in flavor. Slightly sweet, with some apricot and pear coming through. A tad on the sour side, but nicely balanced. Definitely worth a try."
"Pours a yellowy gold and clear with a faint covering of white bubbles that quickly fades to nothing. Honey apple sweetness in the aroma along with some lemon and apple tartness. Taste follows with a good amount of sugary sweet honey that is well balanced with a lemony flavor. There is a small crisp bite in the effervescent carbonation with a somewhat dry and lightly bitterness following. A hint of spice is in the effervescence along with a rubberiness in the slightly bitter finish. I enjoyed this beer, the rubber taste that came thru in the bitterness was kind of unpleasant when it was strong but it didn't come thru strong often. The abv was very well hidden. Easy to drink a few of this one."
"Poured into my Goose Island tulip. Looks a little pale for a saison. More like a dark macro lager, but with saison like carbonation and head. Deep straw color. Aroma is a little sweet but not tart. Crystal and pale malts I'll guess. Light earthy tone with the first sip and just a hint of style=like tartness. But the rest a hint sweet and syrupy for a real saison. Not a bad beer, but if you want a real saison, go to Belgium."
"This beers is a slightly reddish gold color with very little head that diminished rapidly. Not a lot of aroma here at all. The taste is good a little bit of hops, kind of sweet at the end. No alcohol taste at all. Smooth mouthfeel with just the right carbonation. Overall a decent beer that I would have again but not neccessarily seek out."
"Sample at Brew Kettle: Pours a clear orange-gold color with a thin white head that has decent retention. Thin, spotty lacing. Aroma of spices (mostly ginger) and yeast, plus a healthy dose of fruit. Light-bodied and crisp with zesty citrus, wheat and yeast flavors. The finish is tingly on the tongue with a lasting spice finish. I ended up enjoying this one."
"Poured into an Ename chalice, it's a Burnt orange/straw color with moderate haze and medium head with large bubbles that dissipated fairly quickly, leaving only a little lace. The Saison has an earthy, mineral aroma with slight sweetness. The taste was quite similar to Belgian Saison's that I've had, with the appropriate spiciness and mineral hardness, a bit sweet but very smooth in regards to the high ABV, finishing slighly dry. I'm not normally impressed by micro versions of Belgian styles, but the Heavy Seas was top notch. The mouthfeel has a nice pop of carbonation to it, almost like a Brut, very refreshing and easy to drink. Highly recommended!"
"This is a really good brew to try. I'm not sure it fits the saison style, but I'd drink it anyway. Give it a try if you see it."
"Overally, its a nice beer, but it lacks something. Then again, its a regularly priced beer, so I have no grounds for expecting perfection. Its nice to see some smaller breweries at least trying to take on Belgian styles. We'll get there."
"-Oelergud"
"12oz. bottle. Poured a clear, straw yellow with a small white head. Aroma was Belgian yeast, pepper, candi sugar and citrus. Flavor was slightly sweet, with some spice in the middle. Would look for more citrus and earthiness than I found. Hops were minimal, and it finished with some acidity and pepper. Body was light, highly carbonated, and a bit too much acidity. Beer was OK, but there are many better saisons out there. I would drink it again, but I would not seek it out."
"Really tough to pin this beer down. Sure it's a tasty, quality brew, but it's only kinda Saison-ish. Aromas, flavors, and textures more resemble what I like in standard Pale Ales. But the flavor turns modestly Belgian quickly, taking on a mild vineous, cranberry, raspberry flavor that gains tartness and a light drying. The beer remains a bit sweet, heavy, and alcoholic to be a serious Saison candidate, but certainly enjoyable and drinkable nonetheless. Despite it's weight and alcohol a refreshing Wit-like texture takes on increadible smoothness and lightness. Really like this despite it's extra character."
"The mouthfeel is not as creamy as I would like a real ale to be, but it's still delicious. Notes of fruit and banana with a subtle hop note in the nose and the taste. This is a great beer to sit down and sip ... watch out though, after one without food in my belly I felt a little light headed! A great tasting experience and a wonderful recovery from my experience with the bottle!"
"cloudy, apple juice appearance with a big white head. sour, inviting malt odor. spicy taste is nice at first, anise, coriander, overripe bananas, cloves. taste becomes a bit overbearing as the drinking goes on. a bit sour and not really all that well balanced of a beer. somewhat harsh on the mouthfeel too. Kind of interesting overall but not really that great of a beer."
"Pours a crystal clear golden color with a nice white head. Good lacing present. Aroma is predominately saison yeast odor with some wheat malt hints. The flavor is excellent for a saison, good hop-malt balance, sour spiciness present, and a good aftertaste. Just right amount of sweetness is present, though a slight metallic flavor comes through. Compared to many saison style ales lacking enough aroma and taste up front, and a few others with too much fruitiness, this one has an excellent balance. The complexity of this beer is very nice, and the powerful saison characteristics are definitely not overwhelming in a bad way."
"D: This is the third of a six pack I've had and this being the worst so far. I thought this was a good example of a saison, but after three it's only worth a try. However, with all that said, it's still a drinkable beer."
"Stumbled on this at Twain's. Appearance was just like the Hennepin I just had on tap. Nice head with a nice yellow color. Aroma was a bit dissapointing, though. Not much of the typical saison aroma one would expect; very little spice, hay, grass. Tasted more like a saison than the aroma would've indicated. Kind of syrupy, though. All in all an OK saison, but not one I would rush out and get."
"Poured a briliant golden color with very sparse white head, only a thin coating. Smell is more like a tripel with nice yeast, bubble gum scents and a bit of spice in the background. Taste is extremely pleasant with nice malty and citrus notes present combined with the yeastiness. Very drinkable. Alcohol well hidden. If the label did not say Saison, I would call it a tripel."
"Good summer beer for a ""big"" beer line."
"One of the best Saisons from this continent that I've had. I'm on my last of six, and only now have I come here to find out the ABV is 8%. The thin yellow appearance had my expectations pretty low as you could easily mistake this brew for a cheap macro on appearance alone. Light floral nose with honey, clove and vanilla characteristics. The taste is just terrific for the style. Many times saisons can come across as slightly skunked (often because they are), but this beer is crisp and refreshing with a sweet smoothness that is completely void of any hint of bitterness or spoil. While, because of the perfume-like aromas and flavors, there are very few saisons I would consider overly drinkable, this one is definitely worth adding a few of to the mix."
"I don't think I could drink this in-session, for long. For a nice ""what's interesting in the fridge"" surprise, this is a definite go-fer-it in my books."
"Medium bodied and frothy carbonated. This was a nice sippin brew, it just needs a lil push to reach a more desired Saison  after all Heavy Seas is suppose to mean bigger brews. I would have another, but wont go all out trying to find this one."
"Gets a litle boring about halfway through due to the heavy spicing. Somewhat incoherent in its heavy-handed approach to taste diversity; the flavors simply don't meld in their assertiveness. Doesn't taste like a Saison, either -- it's just not funky enough. Fortunately, I grabbed this as part of a summer variety pack as I don't see myself drinking much of it. On the plus side, it's got a fair amount of alcohol and the mouthfeel is enjoyable. A good try for a tough style to do in America but it just doesn't cut it."
"Overall I liked this one. It had some good flavour and good balance to it and was easy drinking. It's definitely worth a shot."
"Drinkability/Notes: Decent little local beer especially for a reasonably rare style. Very drinkable, affordable and enjoyable. Not a bad easy introduction to the belgians for a newbie. Not too sticky or too tart."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is medium bodied. The flavors never seem to meld. The beer has a pretty dry finish. The beer drinks ok overall. I dont plan to buy this saison again. I think there are better ones for the price."
"easy to drink for such abv but not enthralling enough to substatially raise the drinkablility/desirability level. sugariness quickly becomes cloying."
"This is a very tasty, well balanced beer. A great treat on a warm summer evening."
"Pours amber-straw colored into my pint glass with a rich, big head and moderate carbonation. Aromas of bananas and coriander waft up from the glass. The taste is just what you'd expect from a domestic Saison: clean and pure with just a nod towards barnyard-much different from the actual thing. It is a real treat to see more domestic micros branching out in this category with six-packs and 22's. The finish is clean and the aftertaste lingers for a short time."
"Overall, I'd say that this beer is not to drinkable. It just seams that the sweetness would wear you out."
"Medium lemon color, small head, some lacing. Smell is wheaty, fruity..similar to a trippel. Taste is rich..sweet and fruity on the front, tart on the finish..can't really notice the 8.0 abv. Mouthfeel is extremely interesting..oily and rounded on the front, dry on the finish. Very easy to drink especially for the higher abv."
"Easy drinking for about half the glass, then I had to force it down."
"Very spicy, fruity saison. Light on the palate. Tastes of lemon, white pepper, passion fruit and yeast. Very acidic mouthfeel. A good brew."
"I enjoyed my case of ""Red Sky At Night", but didn't think they hit the saison style."
"This is a decent attempt at a saison and quite drinkable."
"D - Good. If the mouthfeel doesn't get to you than you could drink this indefinitely (well, ignoring the strength). The flavor is nice. Yet another pleasant Clipper city brew!"
"A very pale medium gold with almost no head and slowly percolating carbonation. Looks like a lot of beers, but a single sniff tells otherwise. The aroma is strong, earthy, and sweet, with a slight banana note. Tastes like a sweet, slightly thick tripel with a bit more funk and body. Very little bitterness, just plenty of odd phenolic notes in the taste and the smell. Interesting beer, but a little much to spend more than 2 or 3 bottles with."
"Solid saison. Definitely not an extreme/outlandish/over-the-top example of the style but just a simple, nice saison. Flavors are pleasantly balanced between the sweet malts and a quiet presence of pepper, cloves and other spices. Nice hearty yeast presence gives this beer a nice earthy tone. Medium to full body. Flavors come out more as the beers warms. Alcohol is nicly hidden."
"D - pretty high, a well balanced beer"
"Almost hop-burps sort of out of place. Passable, but not fantastic."
"Label says best befor Aug. 06. Pours a very brilliant gold/straw color. This beer is very clear, not what I expected. Thin white rocky head disappears immediately. No lace on the sides of the glass as the beer disappears. Citrusy, lemon zest and spicy aroma. There is a subtly funky aroma as well, but not as heavy as in other versions. Tart and sweet flavors combined with some floral hop flavor as well. Slightly zesty and perhaps corriander. Lacks the general ""funk"" that is associated with other examples of the style, although you do get a slight hint of it. Light to medium body. I found this to be enjoyable, even a good session beeer in the summer. This might be a good suggestion for someone who wants to get a taste for a saison, without diving headfirst."
"Drinkability: decent drinkability as the alcohol is barely noticeable and the general flavor components are decent but not overwhelming."
"D- This beer has some nice flavors and textures but they are very soft. I was surprised that the ABV is 8%. It is smooth and drinkable when chilled but at the bottom of the glass more of a cooked corn taste started coming out."
"Poured a thick, foamy, pale cream colored head fades slowly and after a good many sips leaves a coat of lace. Streams of carbonation rise briskly as fine sediment sinks in the the glowing golden beer. Inviting aroma of yeast, lemon, and spring flowers. Mellow yeasty Belgian character gives way to a wave of carbonation and a dash of zesty lemon. For an 8% beer it comes off as light and refreshing. Body and taste make me think there is a good portion of wheat. A solid Saison, especially from a brewery that doesn't specialize in Belgian ales."
"Cloudy yellow with a large foamy head and plenty of active carbonation. Smell is sweet alcohol, but nothing in the barnyard vein, there are some hints that this is a Belgian style in the notes over the alcohol. Taste has the dryness of a decent saison but it is overshadowed by the distinct alcohol presence. Mouthfeel is medium but the body of the brew is a bit shallow, with the finish being dominated by the alcohol burn. Drinkability suffers because of this."
"This very very drinkable. I'm looking forward to getting some more next summer. Sucks that I had to find a lonely single this late in the season."
"Very hazy yellow gold with a medium-sized head that is very pretty. Laces well. Aroma is very appetizing and very Belgian, with big bubble gum and spicy pepper. If I close my eyes I could swear this was one of the classic strong Belgian dark ales. Peppery and a bit hot going down, this one is exciting and still very drinkable. I taste white grapes, alcohol, and a backbone of spicy hops to keep the grainy malt at bay. Feel is fine, though not quite as dry and spritzy as I expected. I enjoyed this a lot, although I would not drink more than one in a night as the hotness would most likely bring on a headache."
"An effervesent pale golden beer. Has a big foamy bright white head with a small amount of lace. There is a light fruity aroma with hints of peaches and apples. The flavor starts with a light candy sweetness that gives way quickly to a sharp hop bitterness. The finish is dry and crisp. This beer leaves one feeling unfullfilled."
"Unlike typical offerings of the style, this one came in a six pack of 12 oz. bottles. Hazy pale yellow color with a ton of streamers and a large egg shell head made this look the part of a classic Saison. The aroma was more hoppy than anticipated, with a spicy, citric smell, more typical of an IPA, than a Belgian style. There was also a background of perfumey, alcoholic, earthy smells. The taste was light, spicy, and citric, and dry, but not quite as dry as other Saisons. Very delicious and quenching, and a good approachable take on the style."
"overall- first saison ale and im liking it. this one in particular seems to be a little unbalanced but overall it is very refreshing and easy to drink. seems like it might go well with some spicey food."
"side note on the label, it sucks and would make you not want to drink this beer at all. make you think its some kind of lager or pale ale. do not be fooled here. soak the bottle and pour it out of clear brown."
"Much thanks to ppoitras and BiF 19."
"drinkability: a little more alcohol dominated than I expected"
"A nice swirling beer, and certainly an upgrade over most picnic beer. This is really a great offering and falls just short of being excellent. I am glad on this one that did buy the six pack."
"Into an oversize wine glass pours this one. There it sits hazy and straw colored with an arduous white head, kept afloat by ambitious streams of carbonation. Aroma is grainy with some lemons, oranges and bananas (along with other fruits) as well as a dose of yeast. Flavor has lots of pale malts, displaying toasty, biscuity flavors with a slight sweetness. Yeast is present as well. Same fruit sensations in the flavor that were in the nose. Brisk carbonation enhances the blast of citrous. Some spices jump in near the middle and linger, melding with the spicy/bitter hops in the finish. Finishes with a splended blend smooth malt, spice, and slightly drying bitterness. Refreshing and satisfying saison."
"Pours a light gold with a nice two fingers of head. Aroma is slightly sour citrus with a good dose of spices and a hint of alcohol. Taste has a lot going on, a almost cloyingly sweet beginning is rescued by a tart fruitiness and a sharp spicy finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and very dry. Alchohol comes through more than needed in the finish. Overall this is a very drinkable beer, if nothing exceptional."
"I wondered why they called it ""Red Sky at Night""- when they poured it for me it started off all head. Then as I let it sit there the Head became this ""cloud"" and the beer, which has a red tint to it, actually looked like it was falling from the sky. It was amazing. The beer itself was good. Had a sweet to minty taste at the end, very refreshing."
"Golden and bubbly, with a small head, no lacing. Light bodied appearance for a saison. Slight citrus and grape come through the nose, no hops of note, but not really expected in the style. Taste is yeasty. Certainly a summer beer. Good for the style, not great, I think I would rather just have a wheat beer. It can't seem to decide what it is. Somewhat too bubbly. This is not a bad beer, and I would have more, but I wouldn't go out of my way for one."
"Not a bad brew. servicable in barbeques, and other hot days, but, nothing mind blowing. possibly a good intro brew."
"Poured a slightly hazy blond/yellow with lighter head that settles pretty quickly,wow there is a sure fire Belgian yeast aroma here a litle iron with some 10x suger and a little spice.Citrus flavors dominate with that iron-like dryness underneath but it keeps this brew from being overly sweet,I find it fruity and refreshing and extremely quaffable for the alc% content.A real nice summer seasonal here maybe not as good as some of the traditional Belgian saisons Dupont,Pipaix etc... but very nice."
"12 ouncer, notches on the label tell me to purchase this before 10-05 for fresh flavor. Pours golden, cloudy amber, moderate white head, quickly fades to a film, lacing is moderate. Nose is of melon and some gin. this a pretty decent little saison style ale. Some peppery spicing, fruity notes and a nice dry finish, not bad stuff. Not the worlds most exciting brew, but this is a respectable take on the style. Enjoyable and will go nicely with a variety of foods, can anybody say BBQ?"
"Pours a bright hazy lightly golden yellow color with a finger of head that falls to a very light coating over the top. The nose is orangey and lemony; a light coriander spiceyness and a puff of alcohol also come through. The flavor is okay. I get a light sweet graineyness and earthyness, a light creamyness, some lemon and orange and a light spice. Not too bad. The feel is moderate with a nice moderate carbonation. Overall, a moderate to good brew. I'm a little less of a fan of the flavor. Its refreshing and crisp. I'd have it again."
"Thanks to nerofiddled for this one. Pours a hazy orange color with a small head that falls fast and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma has a lot of citrus and a little bit of musty. The flavor has a lot of spice and some citrus. Interesting take on the Saison style - pretty good example for an American brewery. The body is moderate to light and the drinkability is good."
"I hold Saison Dupont as the gold standard for the saison style. It doesn't have to worry about being displaced by this offering from Clipper City. Don't get me wrong, Red Sky At Night isn't bad, it simply lacks the depth of character in a truly great saison. Give it a try anyway."
"Pours a light golden yellow, ever so slight haze. Big bubbles, lots of carbonation. Long lasting head. Aroma has that Belgian twang to it. Somewhat sweet/fruity/bubblegum phenolic. Tastes like it smells with a bit of funk for good measure. Light pepper aftertaste. An OK effort at a Belgian style ale, but if you are after a Saison, find something else. Im glad that MD brewers are taking on the style, and Im sure the hard working staff at Clipper City will be closer in next years version. You wont be disappointed, but wont be overly impressed either. The other Heavy Seas beers are more worth seeking out."
" Good drinkability, and a likeable brew, but it's not to style."
"disappointing"
"What was interesting about the appearance was the subtle but clear light-orange hue to the otherwise white head. Orange-gold body with thick carbonation. The nose was a bit too light for what I would consider higher alcohol content but it was a tad floral but not sharply so. Malty, a bit spicy, thick feelings and tasting, good acidity, clean enough finish. The feel was good with the heavy carbonation and thickness, lingering yeast perhaps. Readily drinkable."
"A decent saison, but for less than the cost of a six-pack of this beer, you could be enjoying a Saison Dupont."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Medium bodied, easily drinkable. Good spring/summer saison, something a little different for when a pils or amber ale just won't cut it."
"Drinkability and Overall: This is a nice brew, one of the better American Saisons I have had. It's tasty, feels nice, and warms the belly just about perfectly. This will be a great sipper on this cool summer night."
"While not it seems to broach true Saison territory, that's the best thing about it. Pretty enough, it never delivers anything specific enough to say that it's really good. It's a bit jumpy, with the flavors there but seemingly not wanting to be, determined to be separate entities in the same glass. I wouldn;t go so far as to say it's disappointing, because I had no expectations, but with the ABV what it is, it doesn't deliver enough in return to justify drinking more. Just not my cup of tea, or Saison, as it were."
"A very flavorful saison; light and drinkable for an 8% abv version of the style. One of my first Clipper City encounters and I'm very pleased."
"Pours a hazy gold with a nice tall stark white head. The aroma has some spice to it as well as kind of a weiss bier clove and banana thing going on. Taste is interesting, sweet yet tart. Fruity and spicy with a definate yeasty undercurrent. Refreshing to drink. Pretty complex, but the flavours dont seem to meld fluidly. Mouthfeel is pretty good with pleasant carbonation that keeps the palate clean and refreshed. Drinkability. Well I would buy this again to have at home, but I wouldnt want to make a session beer oout of this."
"A oragnish gold body with a white head that disapates quickly. The nose holds a pleasent hoppiness with some sweet malty notes containing a citrus underbelly. The taste is of gold grain and peppery citrus with muted noble hops. It has a long lasting aftertaste that is bready but not funky and with a spicy twang that makes this a good sipper and enjoyable. The 8% is well hidden making this dangerously drinkable if a little thin in the yeasty feel."
"Always my favorite in the Heavy Seas line-up, this year's Red Sky is a bit more balanced and less sweet (which is a good thing), but it still retains the berry-like and citrusy fruitiness that makes it so exciting and enjoyable. It's hazy golden body has an orange cast beneath its quick-to-fade head of bright white; and tiny bubbles can be seen steadily rising towards the surface, The nose is vibrant with fruity yeastiness and a sweetish maltiness. It's crisp and then smooth across the palate with a medium-light body and gently effervescent carbonation. Some touches of orange and lemon appear in the flavor, as well as some berry-like juiciness. It's sweetly malty without being overlydone, and a touch of spiciness sneaks in from somewhere and helps to balance it. Hints of hop flavor also appear, and it's nicely balanced with a restrained bitterness that lets the malt and yeast shine while still finishing with a bit of chalky dryness. I absolutely loved the previous, heavily dextrinous version, but this is far more drinkable! Kudos!!!"
"Since this is my first Saison, I'm definitely looking forward to trying more, as it seems there are many out there which are worthy. I'm really starting to love Belgian beers and the breweries' attempts in the US at many of the great styles. This is a pretty good beer overall, and I will definitely buy it again. And check out the artwork, as that's what led me to it (and I know Clipper City has a few more great Heavy Seas labels because there are a few more styles than just this)."
"D&N: Very good saison. Goes down fairly easily and the alcohol gives a nice warm feeling. Good one to try."
"Thanks to the Blitheringidiot for gifting me this in a sixer of the Clippers!"
"Cloudy bright golden orange with a nice creamy head that leaves some lacing in my glass. Fruity, spicy aromas, tropical fruit, orange and lemon flavors, a bit of a sourness in the finish. Medium bodied with a nice soft mouthfeel, alcohol very well hidden."
"Drinkability is good. Well crafted beer, not sure about the Saison designation though. Solid tasting beer that got better with a little warming."
"Drinkablity is very good, a very nice offerring from clipper City, I just wish I had another."
"I love what Clipper City has done with their Heavy Seas line; namely jack up the flavor and the ABV so that lovers of Big Beer feel right at home. Glancing back to the first paragraph, it looks like delighted wins the day. A hearty 'aye matey' and a big Thank You to lackenhauser for the bottle."
"Pours into my Belgian style glass with a clear gold color and sufficient white head. Smell is between a Wit and a Hefe with a little banana and spice and sulfur. Taste is pineapples, ginger and bananas with a dry alcohol finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and with zesty carbonation. This beer is very nice and seems addictive with its flavor, drinkability and warming alcohol sensation. It's distinctive and definately worth a try."
"This poured out a clear bubbly golden yellow with a very small white bubbly head that that left little lacing. Scents of spice, mainly coriander that I could pick out and a slight malty sweetness rose from the glass. There were also notes of doughy yeast kind, but overall a mild aroma. The flavor was better with a sweet spicy taste coming up front along with slight fruit notes such as apple. The after taste was a spicy bitter one with a touch of lime. Mouthfeel was about medium with a good carbonated feel to it. This is pretty good stuff, not as good as their double pilsner but I would definitely pick this one up again."
"As far as saisons go, I've definitely had better. As for locals, I stand by the saison at Wharf Rat. I do enjoy this, however. It is a nice fruity/spicy blend, with a nice lacing of vanilla that I detected in the nose. It is a nice creamy beer that would definitely be worth having a few."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 1"" of white head over the honey-hued brew. Dense head shows good staying power, with nice lacing of foamy bits. Aroma is a bit spicy, in that Belgian-ish, with an undercurrent of alcohol mixed in. Taste is initially grainy, like a wheat malt effect, and then seems to just spread out in the mouth, with the light alcohol notes touching all the bases, so to speak. I find the saisons as a whole hard to describe taste-wise, so bear with me. Mouthfeel and drinkabilty are both good. An enjoyable brew."
"Pours with a creamy white head. The carbonation is low, though entirely adequate, and the beer is a deep clear gold color. This beer has a nice, funky yeast driven nose that has spicy notes of orange, coriander, and musty cellars. It is lightly sweet and quite fruity, with notes of tropical fruit. There is a spicy sharpness here as well, which helps to balance the other notes. I get notes of ginger, lemon, and a slight astringency. When the yeast is added to the beer I get a slight nuttiness that develops. This is a nice mix of competing flavors."
"This poured a clear orangey gold color. Full of carbonation but no discernable head. The aroma is interesting with sweet and sticky candy malt with a hint of metallic notes. The taste is light, tangy and highly flavorful. Im getting orange liqueur syrup, fruity rock candy and a touch of bitter grapefruit. The finish leaves a bittersweet tang in the throat. Overall, this is very nice and enjoyable beer. A good one to enjoy in warm weather  sippin on while relaxing by the pool."
"($7.19 / 6-pack)"
"Drinkability: Decent brew, would go back to it, but definitely not the best saison I've had."
"12 oz. bottle best before 11/04. Pours a golden color with an off white head that forms lacing around the side of the glass. Some estery, tropical, fruity notes, with a malty backbone. Tastes a bit fruity, too. Sweet and a slight bit dry, it's a pretty good saison. Retains many qualities one looks for in a saison. I'd go back to this one again."
"12 ounce bottle purchased at Wine and Beer Westpark in Richmond. Best before Nov 04."
"Pours a pale orangey color with a bubbly white head that dissipates very quickly. It leaves no lace throughout the glass. The aroma reminds me of Hoegaarden, of bananas and medicine. The taste is medicinal and very strange. The first hit on the tongue is bland and uneventful, but, when the aftertaste hits, whew. Harsh aftertaste reminding me, again, of the Belgian white wheat. The bottom of the glass is hard to finish. Never again, on this one."
"Beer is good. Happy mixed style beering."
"A deep golden colour with nice clarity and a nice white head that sticks around for the show. The aroma is a bit simple and one-sided for a saison-style ale. I smell oranges, coriander, other citric fruits, spicy yeast, earthy hops, and a bit of caramel malt. The taste is good but very wit-like and one sided. Again the taste is wheaty, spicy, citrus-like and nice. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and gets the job done and the drinkability is just fine. This is another good beer, but this is not a trus saison in my book. This is more like a weizen/wit-part saision cross."
"Drinkability: Ridiculously so."
"A couple of bad bottles? It was pretty dead in the water, simple bodied, and the finish was long in the wrong way."
"Nice golden color.Slight head that lingers a while.Aroma of malt with a great floral aroma behind it.Nice 'Belgian"" yeasty notes in there as well.Great malt upfront-slightly spicy.Great silky sweetness in the mouthfeel.A very drinkable beer-hard to believe its 7.5%.I could see having several of these and then it sneaking up on you.Not too sure how it compares to a true Belgian saison but well worth a try and a great American example-sort of like Victory's Golden Monkey as a triple."
"Appearance: Bright golden copper appearance big white head leaves more than ample lacing around my glass. Aroma: Soft fruity tones vanilla edge, with tropical fruit tones chilling in the background nice with a touch of herbal hops I like this one. Taste: Not a true Saison farmhouse style ale but a very well made rendition of one, flavors that standout are vanilla, tropical fruit, and hints of a wheat possibly used here some evident alcohol with a citrus finish. Mouthfeel: Creamy texture medium body nice carbonation not as finely carbonated as a Saison Dupont. Drinkability: I'm amazed by this one really tasty great drinkable brew with some flavor, alcohol, and refreshing qualities."
