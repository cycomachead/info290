"Glass- 4oz tasting glass."
"very tasty"

"Unexpected Saison...very much a Porter feel to it, and it was awesome"

"Overall: I have a few more of these in the cellar. The bottles say that they can be aged for up to 5 years. I'm going to keep some around for at least that long. I really like this take on a Belgian ale. The pepper is very subtle but there."
"Overall, Pepe Nero is a different Saison/Farmhouse style ale than I am accustom to.  This ""black Saison/Farmhouse"" ale I feel is best enjoyed in the cooler months of Fall and Winter.  If you are looking for a different take on the style it is worth a try.  I for one prefer  a more traditional Saison/Farmhouse ale"
""
"Don't judge a book (or in this case) a beer by its cover.  Poured dark but had a nice smooth and light taste."
""
"Overall: I can only assume that (almost) three years in the bottle has softened this beer quite a bit. I remember it having more of a peppery note, and a bit more edge. It's components stood out more. It's quite rounded at this point, and I'm not sure that that really works. I would imagine that early last year was probably its ""sweet spot", so if you've got any in the cellar now would be a good time to start finishing them off."
"Cool beer.  2013 vintage.  Pours like a stout, thick and black, with little head and virtually no lacing.  A little deceiving as it drinks very carbonated.  Pepper, leather, and yeast on the nose, but the taste is floral and bright like the saisons with the pepper present.  There's a lot interesting about this beer, from the powerful label to the juxtaposed color and flavor.  I'll drink it again for sure.  Goose Island continues to impress me."

"Roasted caramel malt aroma. Deep dark brown body. Thick fluffy off white head. Smokey roasted malt taste. Clean wet finish."
""
""
""
"This is some pretty good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  Good beer, even though it’s more than a little old (2011).  Good flavors combined with a good mouthfeel.  I really liked it.  I’ll have to try some fresher bottles to see how different they are."

"Bottled February 2011, loved this aged even more than I did fresh."

"Bottled on 12/28/11 definitely aged well."

"O: Well this is really good. Don't know if it's just the aging this beer had, but this is a strong strong beer and I still scratch my head looking at the scores people gave this. Anyway, imagine a drier porter with some light Belgian elements, and you get this beer. Great stuff, highly recommended."

"Ages very well.  I recently drank a 2013.  It was massively better than i remembered it being.  I'm aging 2 more from the same year to see how they develop."

"O - I'd like to see if this mellows out even more and thickens a bit with age.  Aroma is awesome but taste was a little sweet for me."

"Over 2 years old, the bottle that is being sampled for this review. Sampled using a Sam Adams special beer glass. Pours with big head that goes down quickly and becomes thin, Nose is not significant. Has brown ale overtones. Balance leans more to  the acidic side than sweet. More of an Italian style dark than a Belgian. Definitely malty, Does have a few raisin, molasses flavors. A bit peppery. Does not have much length to it. This would probably have been better after one year of aging. It has the thin qualities of a two year old Belgian. That is why I give it a higher rating than it deserves, due to the age of the bottle sampled. OK with cheeses and spicy foods."
""

"Solid finger plus of tan microfoam, miniscule bubbles forming a very even surface, the lacing is a broad sheet, no streaks, head lasts well enough before becoming a thin coating across the surface. The liquid is a deep brown with yellowish rims, lots of particulate floating inside, still you can see the fat bubbles with ease. The nose is sweet, highlighting cola, cocoa, malted milk balls, vanilla and green apple to peach and cherry fruit scents, perhaps bready but not very yeasty and no citrus nor herbal/earthy notes. Full-bodied and lays thickly on the tongue, the carbonation adds initial prickle and then little much thereafter. Equally sweet here with chocolate, caramel, cola flavors, kind of like drinking an alcoholic Dr. Pepper. The fruit here more cherry to red berry in nature. Maybe, just maybe a little minerally earthiness at the end where it is also on the dry side. This beer provides pleasure, it simply leaves you a bit confused as to what its goal is."
""
""
""
""
"Decent beer but I can't imagine many drinkers will be going back to the well too often for this one. The body is medium and the carbonation dances a fine line between lovely and smooth, feel overall is pleasant and creamy and easy to drink. Better than many ""black saisons"" on the market these days but still, this wouldn't be a staple in my fridge."

"It's a pretty good Belgian style farmhouse ale. It has a VERY heavy mouthfeel, which if you like is great, but if you don't it's not. This isn't exactly a refreshing beer, but it has a very nice taste and I do appreciate what's going on with it. I would not be able to drink more than one in a sitting because it feels so heavy."

"The taste brings out those roasted malts and spices briefly but then the sour character teases the palate and lingers to the end. But it is not overly sour or tart. It does not make me pucker up. 16 months of aging enhanced this one I am sure."

"Poured from a 765 ml bottle into a Liefmans Goudenband glass (my preferred all purpose beer tasting glass). Tasted 6/10/14."

"2012 version..pours dark maple brown with slightly foamy off white head. Smell is not overwhelmingly Belgian in nature but the key characteristics are present. Taste reminds me of a Belgian style stout..definitely notice the 2 years of agey sweetness here. Mouthfeel is foamy and definitely sense the heat of alcohol here, although this is just stated as 6% abv on bottle. Overall, as a person who is not the biggest fan of Belgian style, highly drinkable. Could use more bite."

""
""
"O: Bottled May 28, 2013, drank May 8, 2014. Its stretching my perception of Saison, farmhouse ales. Saison Silly was dark, but not as dark as this one. A lot more toasted notes, darker and deeper flavours."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: As a fan of saisons, I had high expectations of Pepe Nero - particularly because it is a black saison; I can say with certainty, those expectations were exceeded. The aroma and taste threw me off at first because 'fruit' and 'chocolate' are not terms I would associate with a saison, but this has easily become on of my favorites."
""
""
""
"Remarks: not bad overall"
""
"O: good but not my favorite of the farmhouse ales. Interesting to have a dark version and I think that burnt malt takes over a little much for me. Surprising how much alcohol taste is there in a beer stored for over a year and at only 6.5%"

"Final Grade: 4.13, an impressive A-. Goose Island's Pepe Nero makes for a tasty spring or summertime treat, offering up an interesting marriage between dark, toasted malt notes and more traditional Belgian ale tropes. A bit more peppercorn would bump this up into world-class territory. A great beer that I would consider purchasing again, but I think I still prefer Sofie's lighter flavour (and lower price)."

"MF – Medium-light body with a dry finish, a little chewy 4.25"

"Overall: Nice balanced slightly tart, a little different than most saison's but in a good way. Would buy again. $7.99 22oz"

"Overall, I believe I'd have this again. There are three beers left in the pack- I shan't be buying this again though. This isn't for me."
"O- This is the first black saison I've had and it didn't really work for me."
""
""
""
"O: I'm a little confused by this one. Doesn't fit the style very well, and beyond that it seems to lack the complexity of other Goose Island craft beers. It's good, but nothing to go out of your way to try."
"O: I really liked this beer a lot."
""
""
""
"O: Aside from its diversion from the characteristics of the style, this beer just did not have an interesting flavor. Could have been more powerful than it was."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A descent tasting beer, however, in a blind taste test, its not styled like a Saison. Its appearance, complex spicy, malty, mild coffee flavor is that of a good Porter. I’m confused!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Goose Island classifies this as a ""vintage"" beer what with it being bottle fermented and all that. While I was never a big farmhouse fan, this one does make for a decent sessional any time of the year."
""
""
""
"Overall, a nice tasting brew but it seems to be between styles, maybe the yeast in the bottle needs time to develop? I guess I was expecting a dryer, spicier saison presence over the stout sweetness."
""
"uy again but I've said that about brews from most of the breweries I've had the chance to try. No slant on Goose Island intended."
""
""
"O - Nice roasted and light saison. I would drink this one again."

"Doable, but I don't think that I'm calling her back."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: an interesting beer that seems like it wants to be too much. I dig the saison with peppercorns but think the use of dark malts clash with the other characteristics of this beer. Glad to have tried but will likely stick with some of GI's other Belgian offerings."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I was happy to find this at such an old age, but this has not aged well in my opinion. The nose is very nice, and exactly what I'd expect given the yeast and malt profile, but it seems that the peppercorns have taken over whatever may have made this more appealing. To me, this faults the most with the overly tannic, astringent, thin body of the beer - it makes it difficult to drink and I had to pair this with fatty food to cut it down a bit. By the end, however, I had to pass it on to someone else to finish for me. Here's hoping I get more out of any future GI experiments I get to try."
""
""
"M-cream roast and smooth carbonated being well balanced saison"
""
""
""
"Prost!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a surprisingly clear, dark-ish brown, red edges in the glass, with big tan colored head. Settles quickly to a quarter inch, spray of lace down the glass. Smell: mild roast, caramel, a little cocoa, grainy. Taste: oddly dunkel-y, coffee and chocolate notes, grain twang. Wet, sugary finish. What yeast did they use in this? This is not a black farmhouse ale, this is a joke."
""
"O: Very smooth flavor, clean and silky drinking experience. very good recommend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Everyone's been saying this is the black saison to get your hands on and now I totally agree. Probably my favorite Belgian offering by Goose Island thus far."
"Deep brown, red where the light shines through around the edges, and a very light brown moderate sized head. Thin retention and not much for lace. Aroma is lightly sweet, a little flowery, and spicy. Figs, molasses, and black cherry. Some banana and bubble gum and slightly phenolic. Smell is creamy with light doughy malt and a darker roasty underbelly. Taste is interestingly basic and easily enjoyable. Malty with some brisk piney hop and soft Belgian saison characteristics. A nice blend and probably a good choice even if you don't really feel like the style. A little roasted malt with some typical Belgian flavors. Mouthfeel is velvety, creamy, and perfectly carbonated with super fine little bubbles. Pretty good beer. Nicely balanced dark Belgian saison."
""
"O- this beer was interesting from the look to the aftertaste"
""
""
""
"O: I was expecting citrus and got a dark fruit concoction that bordered on a sour. Different yet delectable. I really like the Goose Island upper crust collection."

"Some saisons are peppery. In this beer, they put peppercorns in a peppery beer. It's interesting, but not necessarily great. I'm glad I only have a 12oz bottle."

"M - Medium body. Creamy. Light carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Dark saison or really dry, fizzy Belgian brown? I don't care, this is damn good. It lacks some of the fine-tuned sophistication to make it a true great of the style (...whatever that style is), but considering I got this on clearance, that's really a moot point. Put it this way, I'd gladly get this again at regular price."
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's decent, didn't love or hate it. Likely wouldn't seek it out as a must buy but wouldn't be sad if I had it at a restaurant"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A rare miss from one of my favorite Midwest brewers. Not terrible by any means, it's fairly drinkable, but the beer doesn't go anywhere. The label says ""Belgian Ale", BA has it tagged as a Saison, but it really just tastes like a unremarkable brown ale with some spicy nuances."
""
""
""
""
"O: While the peppercorns do not overwhelm the beer, they do reduce the complexity of the flavors and aromas of a saison making a little one note for me. Still an enjoyable beer, the addition of the peppercorns make this one more of a sipper than an easy drinker. I guess I would call this one a Black Saison."
""
"Atmosphere is really nice. Large frothy head, plenty of lacing. Nose is bready with a citrus. Flavor is completely different.... roasted coffee, accentuated with dark chocolate and hints of raspberry. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
""
"O: Good beer to kick back and relax with."

"Extremely smooth. Almost velvety. Medium body. Pretty low carbonation. A very nice drink overall. Alcohol is well hidden. Not really a Saison though. More of a cross between a Belgian Strong dark and an English Dark. Nevertheless a couple of my favorite styles so I will go with it."
""
""
""
"2012 bottle.I gotta say I have never seen a saison/farmhouse Belgian this dark in color,it's a deep mahogany with a great looking fluffy one and a half finger light beige head atop that spits and billows as settles oh so slowly in my chalice.Aromas of candied sugar and hard toffee,a light peppery spice is detected.Dark fruit and toffee flavors with a smack of pepper in the finish wich I like,dark fruits as required are there.Although the bottle may say farmouse this isn't a farmhouse beer,it's a Belgian dark with peppercorns and it's pretty damn good."
""
""
""
"Overall worth a try. The body is not real heavy so any time of year works well for this dark brew."
""
""
"Definitely in its own league, Pepe Nero is polarizing. I think GI had noble intentions in making this beer, and while it has nice flavor, there's note a lot of unity here, and that's what harms its drinkability. Worth checking out, I suppose, if you're feeling on the adventurous side."
"Has a medium mouthful with a delightfully spicy carbonation that really tingles. The carb probably doesn't really exceed medium, or maybe barely, but it makes all the difference."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy chestnut brown with a large long lasting tan head, good lacing. Aroma and Taste of dark roasted malt, dark fruit, molasses, brown sugar and yeast, along with some sweet spices and bitter hops fill the senses. A medium to full body, slightly sticky with good carbonation on the palate. Finish is sweet dark roasted caramel malt, yeast, dark fruit, molasses, some sweet spicy notes and good bitter hops for balance. A very good, flavorful and well balanced brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a brownish body, slight reddish tint, with two finger brownish head that died quick and not much lace on top of a strong malt aroma, strong than is typical for this style, and the yeast and tropical fruits are background material. Beer is smooth, easy to drink, and tasty, but I think I just am being picky about style points rather than don't think this is a great beer. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the sweet and somewhat roasted malts along with some spice and touches of yeast and tropical fruit but it just didn't come together as a whole for me."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very nice and unique saison. While it could stand to be dried out a little more, it is one that I would not have a problem drinking again."
""
"Overall pretty tasty beer, will have to try a fresh one again but this one had great flavor. Worth a try by any belgian beer fan."
""
"Very decent beer overall, and it requires a slow careful poor if you do not want much foam."
""
"Overall, quite a nice dark saison. In terms of Goose Island saisons, i would go with Sofie before this one, but it is a nice change of pace."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this was a fun beer to drink. I didn't realize initially that I was drinking a 2-year old aged beer. I'd definitely look for this one again. Another winner from the Goose."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: this may be the most confusing beer I have had in quite a while. It calls itself a farmhouse/saison but it has a lot of BSDA qualities as well. It is not an unpleasant beer. I have to wonder if perhaps it is just immature? I have another bottle that I will leave for a while and then I will revisit this. Let's see what that brings..."

""
""
""
""

"O: This was a very good beer, not as ""saisony"" as I expected, more roasty and malty than anything else. overall not a bad beer, I'd drink it again but I wouldn't seek it out"
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 12/20/2011. Pours hazy and cloudy very dark reddish brown color with a nice 2-3 finger foamy khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice dense foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big raisin, prune, fig, apple, clove, pepper, molasses, dark candi sugar, toast, light roast, light smoke, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy esters with big malt presence; and good strength. Taste of raisin, fig, apple, pepper, clove, toast, molasses, roasted malt, dark candi sugar, light smoke, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of dark fruit, pepper, clove, molasses, toast, roasted malt, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity of fruity/spicy yeast esters with a great dark malt balance; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a fairly slick, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent black saison style. All around nice complexity and balance of fruity/spicy ester notes with dark malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
"This is a nice beer, sort of a style bender. I'd say its worth a try if you're a fan of Belgian Dark Ales. It veers away from Saison territory quite a bit. Still worth a try for sure."

"Overall: This is so different than anything I have had before. Unique and tasty. Definitely one to try."
"O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, decent kick, good variation of style, this is a solid beer to drink if you’re looking for something a little bit different."
""
"Bubbly beer, yet it retains a thickness that corresponds to its heavy color well. Light prickly feel, not surprising. The boldness in this one is tamed by time no doubt. Some yeast spiciness, mild sweetness pulls through, and a decent roasted aftertaste. This is more in line with a Belgian Stout, rather than a Saison, but whatever. Not bad. Thanks, Jacob, for the pour."
""
""
""
"There is a bit of a grainy feeling to this beer. Medium bodied with modest carbonation. There is a dark roasted malt aftertaste, which is too noticeable. If it played a smaller supporting role, it might be okay. As it is, I am glad I tried this, but don't plan to seek it out again."
""
""
""
"A decent beer to drink. Not really a top example of a black saison though. Fun to try."
""
""
""
"Overall – Perhaps a touch too carbonated, but a nice flavour that is potent but not too robust. Not something I could drink a whole lot of, but definitely an interesting beer that is well worth trying."
""
""
""
"Overall: I really would not buy it again as the taste is too dull when there's so much more out there."
"This is not a good offering from Goose Island. It comes in a beautiful bottle now though. I won't be buying any more, and would recommend people avoid this."
"Taste is thin with a little bit of chocolate/coffee in the background. Not a very impressive taste profile."
""
"O: Another excellent brew by Goose Island. I would grab this again and cellar it for awhile."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall fairly good, taste is a bit weak though."
""
""
""
""
"notes: tasty, imagine a porter with Belgian yeast and a few spices. very unique, quite good."
"Overall: this beer has a lot going on. I imagine the fact that this particular example was bottled 2 years ago (3/4/11) doesn't hurt. But this could end up being a go-to brew for my cellar; just great."
""
""
""
"A nice quaff - I like it for the unique combo of pepper/spice and smokey after-taste. Also: big plus for the Kalamata olive nose. A brew I'd drink again."
""
""
""
""
"Interesting, sort of works, but not sure how much of this style i would enjoy."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I like the dark twist on the saison. It has all the qualities of a good saison with some roasted malt character."
"Viscous texture of a stout and dry. I'm not as into the milky stouts so this plays well."
""
""
""
""
"O: I don't normally prefer saisons, including Sofie, but found the dry spicy pepperiness of this one to elevate it beyond the normal expectations of the style. It's easy drinking, perhaps a touch too strong to be a true session beer. This would make for a great ballpark brew. One surprise for me, however, was that while I normally like most beers to be on the cooler side, particularly the lighter styles, Pepe Nero continued to improve as it approached room temperature, releasing its full flavor profile and becoming significantly more complex."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: had the 2011 version but it s a good take on a farmhouse ale"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm not going to go looking for things that aren't there so that's about all I have on this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: An interesting brew for sure, but I feel that the yeast is overbearing and hides the complex malt base way too much. The Brettanomyces bottle conditioning has really taken over the beer since it has been bottled. I would definitely like to try this fresh before the Brett really has a chance to overwhelm the malt back bone."
"Overall: Pepe Nero is not your everyday saison, or even your every other day saison, but I liked it well enough."
"Overall - Not as complex as a Goose Island Sofie, another saison, but a pleasant experience. I would choose it again."
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a beer I really enjoy. Although it indicates it is meant for aging, I prefer it when it is young and a bit more peppery. I have a 6 pack that I am keeping for annual tastings -- I had my first one (after a 1 year wait) recently and did not enjoy it as much as the ones I've had closer to the bottling date. Nonetheless, looking forward to seeing how this fairs over the next few years."

" The flavor has some nutty tinges and light spice elements with a mild toasted graininess with slight dark cocoa astringency and mild almond type nutty sweetness. Overall this is a pretty solid saison onf the dark persuasion...Goose Island makes a flavorful Belgian style and this is no exception."

"O - An interesting experiment, but not something that I'll be hunting down again any time soon. I'd try it on tap (fresh) if given the chance, but I'm not going to be buying a (nearly) 2-year-old bottle again any time soon."
"From notes, 4/18/11. The beer pours black with dark brown edges. The head is tan and puffs up nicely, before dissipating to nearly nothing. The aroma is cola, chocolate, roasted malt, pepper and bananas. There’s very little saison yeastiness. It’s a nice beer but not particularly compelling. It smells a bit like a bland saison mixed with a stout. The taste is relatively sweet. There’s more pepper and cocoa. The cola flavor creeps up a bit much in the finish. Mouthfeel is pretty middle of the road. It’s a bit effervescent but tends to sit rather heavily on the palate for a saison."
"O: Delicious beer but difficult to tell it is a Saison at first. It is a mellow one and pretty easy to drink especially for someone who leans toward the stout or porter style."

""
""
""
"M: It's actually on the lighter side of medium."
"Heavy carbonation detracts a lot.. I feel this is a brew best served fresh without two years on the shelf.. Can't recommended, but just barely. It's to bland and unremarkable..."
"Overall an interesting schizophrenia of styles. Can see how this would be amenable to aging."
""
"Price was okay at $10/4"
""
"Overall Drinkability: I'd had this before but never reviewed it. Not quite as good as a remember, but it gets the job done as a novelty."
"Overall – Well nothing I really cared a whole lot about for the price that you pay. The tastes were a little confused with none of the flavors really melding well together. The nose, appearance and mouthfeel for me were all just average as well. It may be worth a try, but this is one I will likely not go back too."
""
""
"There are only a few dark Saisons I really like, and I wouldn't say this is one of them- like many in the style, a bit too muddled, with the light roastiness taking away from the slightly funky crispness of the Saison. Not enough Saison character, and what there is can't stand up to the darker style. Pretty enough, though. Pitch clack with a nice creamy head. Very slight funk and spice in the nose, less on the palate. Clean, but too much so. Drinkable, but fairly boring."

"Overall: Belgium’s are always a lively beer with all the bubbles and typically higher ABV and this one fits that bill...nice flavor, robust yeast and malt and fruitiness…very drinkable…tons of carbonation and fluff help make this a wonderful drinking experience…let’s hope this one isn’t affected by the sale of the brewery and remains a Chicago classic…gonna have to find one of these for the cellar…highly recommended for your consumption…(4/5)"

"Which style is it really? Let's forget about styles for a moment and just enjoy this beer."
"O: a decent saison, nice Belgian fruit notes, works well with the chocolaty and toasty grain notes."
"overall: dont taste the peppercorns much, much darker than it tastes, only hints of roast, more belgian not-so-strong dark ale, nice variation of a clovy/spicy beer, refreshing, easy"
""
""
""
"O - Started out great and ended blandly. I had high hopes for such an odd saison, but it did not compare to the norm, such as the Sofie."

"Overall: A pretty nice black saison. I'll buy this again in the future."
"Pepe Nero is a solid overall beer and an interesting take on the style. I am often not a fan of adding roasted malts to beer that typically do not contain any, but in this case it seemed to work."
""
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was the very spicy and nicely warming aroma. The peppercorns as advertised were present, with all the musk and sweetness one could ask from a Belgian saison. The flavoring also showed a surprising complexity, with a significant char to an otherwise toasty and fruity beer. The peppercorns were present in the flavoring as well, but did take a backseat to the malts on several occasions, and much of the expected heat of spice was lacking."
""
"Pours a murky dark brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, spices, slight peppery aromas, and Belgian yeast. Taste is much the same with a mild roasty and spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but I think it smells better than it tastes."

"a very unique beer, cant believe i waited this long to try one! the pour is nearly jet black, inky and thick, with a really nice off white head, patchy but sturdy, lasting and easy ro revive with a little jolt. the nose is really roasty malts with some bitter dark cocoa in there, also the black peppercorns really stand out, as complimented by the funky yeast. the flavor is consistent here, pepper and funk all the way through, with an alcoholic, almost bourbon flavor on the back end. spicy but not overbearing at all, delicate in way, despite its looks. the feel is legendary, expansive bright mouthfeel, lots of tiny bubbles like champaigne, with some mellow warmth from the pepper and a long lasting bittersweet finish where the yeast still shines. its so complex and tasty, im a huge fan. my bottle is from 2012, and says 6.4% abv rather than the listed 6, but you cant taste it at all. big flavors abound in this drinkable classic. hoping the sale of the brewery doesnt shut this baby down, because this is fantastic."

"I don't say this often, but the alcohol could have been stronger here. Beers like this shouldn't border on the level of a session but this came relatively close. A hint of fermented apricot and dark fruit remained in the aftertaste but there was too much to this that just didn't stick with me. While this wasn't bad, it was too underwhelming and hopefully, just a stepping stone for Goose Island."

"O - My first of their vintage line, and while I'm glad I tried it I was plenty satisfied with just the single I picked up."
""
""
""
"O: Overall I was expecting a little more from GI on this one. The nose is pretty good, but the taste just isn't there for me. For such a dark saison, I was expecting to be hit with some stronger pepper notes or at least something that would make me say ""wow!"". Not to be found here, and I don't think I'd buy another."
""
""
""
"O- I really wanted to like this one more. It starts out really good but becomes kind of boring halfway through. Not terrible by any means, but just not incredible."
"Final Thoughts: Believe it or not this is this is the first ""Belgian Style Ale"" I've had. Ever. I'm glad I waited long enough to understand the complexities of the style and was lucky enough to find a vintage bottle. While I'm sure it's not the best one out there, if this is any indication of the style then I think I'm about to start a whole new craft beer journey into the realm of Belgian beers. Would I drink it again? I'm definitely going to be cellaring this years release."

"D - A very interesting beer here from Goose Island... Loaded with character, charm, depth and complexities... While this isn't something I would enjoy on a regular basis it's something that I'll gladly seek out again when the mood hits... An adventurous offering that was very well received by this BA..."

"Bottled 12/18/11 and consumed 10/28/12. Pours opaque black with 3/4 inch tan head that dissipates. Nose is Belgian funk and some rye - nice but not too interesting. The flavor is not too far off a traditional saison until the finish where there is a slight roasted quality and savory finish that emphasizes some rich caramel notes that go unnoticed at first. The aftertaste is out of this world. Just a pleasant complex finish which coats the tongue. Mouthfeel is great - nicely carbonated to a point where the flavors are delivered on point. Also, just a tiny hit of spiciness from the rye (or peppercorns?) - for me, almost comes across more in the mouthfeel than the flavor. This is a pretty good saison - not too much to write home about. Not really outside of the box enough from a typical saison, which the brewery releases would have you expecting something far more interesting. I can imagine this beer would be stellar with some good bbq or a grilled steak."
"O: This is a really interesting saison. Dark and moderately roasty/toasty. Definitely mellow, rich and malty. Spiciness is really nice too. I really enjoyed this one, the only thing I can say against it is that it's rather simple. Not a very faithful version of the style either but a unique and delicious one instead."
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is the most unusual Saison I've had to date and I have some mixed feelings about it. The flavor is certainly a Saison, but with some Doppelbock characteristics. Even though this isn't an outstanding Saison, it's still very drinkable albeit a bit overpriced for what I paid for it."
""
"Bottle from 2011. pour is dark brown letting no light through with tons of tight light brown head. Nose is a balanced, light smokey note with a sweet Saison yeast, candied lemon, and peppery spice behind. The taste is far more smokey, the body is oily and falls off in the middle and the finish is short. The roast dominates but sweet lemon and faint Saison yeast come in towards the back of the palate as roasted malts come in at the end and disappear."
""
""
"O: A nice take on a classic style. Certainly interesting, with the dark roasted qualities providing another dimension on a fairly simple style of beer. A nice easy drinker, too."
""
""
""
""
"Certainly not your typical Saison with the toasted malt aspects that lend to its appearance but this is tasty nonetheless and I can certainly appreciate what the brewer was aiming for."
""
""
""
"O - A beer everyone who loves this style should try. It is an interesting take and I personally feel the mouth feel makes this one worth the price. Cheers."
""
"Overall, it's a tasty, well-balanced brew. It is unique enough. Sweet, slightly tart and spicy it's a nice beer. Pour carefully, as it really foams up. Enjoy!"
""
""
"This is a pretty good beer. There isn't a lot of challenge here, but it works well as a mid-week sipper."
"I was excited to try this one. Had from 12 oz. bottle (2012) at Brasserie in Easton, MD. Aroma is of slight pepper and Belgian farmhouse funk. An interesting dark brown to black color, and the first time I have seen a black saison since trying De Viento at Jolly Pumpkin. This one goes in a different direction, though. Aroma has funky yeast and roasted grains, with some definite black pepper influence. A light taste here, very refreshing with some slight roast, and with slight pepper and strong carbonation. It is pretty unique, but no flavor stands out entirely. Goes down easy, and is almost refreshing. I would like to try this again."
"Pepe Nero is a brown-black ale with huge brown foam on top. The aroma has notes of stone fruit, plum wine, soft, toasted grain, alcohol and... chocolate? It's pretty full bodied. It turns dry very quickly and vanishes upon the swallow, leaving the teeth a little chalky. Nice, dark, resiny tones mingle, staying fruity but never veering into sweetness. There's a touch of phenol after the swallow. A tangy aftertaste follows. This is just a very tasty ale! I chugged it at room temperature after letting it sit in a glass for a few hours."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I was afraid to try this, but it really works. I'd get this again. Well done."
""
"Poured a large 4"" cappucino head with decent lifespan. The body is dark as coffee. It smells mildly of roasted malt and cocoa. The taste matches the smell but also adds coffee and the slightest touch of sour. The finish has a nice slow burn building from the sour. Dark yet a true saisson easy to drink. Nice beer."
""
""
"A decent dark saison that comes off as balanced but maybe a little too astringent with the roasted malts. The strong classic saison yeast profile is nice though."
"OVERALL: An enjoyable beer that has some real strong points. Exquisite feel and moderately complex flavors. Decant slowly at cool cellar temperature for best results."
""
"The beer pours like mahogany, just as their website claims, with a big beautiful sandy white cream head that leaves sticky tendrils of foam along the sides. It sits in the glass like a black French roast coffee and is very appealing. Carbonation seems to be constant and a little fierce along the edges of the glass, but the head retention is beautiful. The beer smells like a saison, sweet and biscuity with a nice yeast sweet sour funk that hints at citrus and pear. As the beer settles in the glass it ekes out touches of toffee and roasted malts, but nothing too pungent or noticeable. The beer tastes odd for sure, quite tart with the citrus saison kick. The Roasted malts and toffee dance at the back of the flavor and linger on the sides of the tongue as beautifully candied drizzling. The aftertaste is also strong with a roasty nutty coffee like fizz from the malts which is lovely but bizarre. The funk suggests some slight dark fruits but mostly a sweet bready sour citrus. The taste is really quite bizarre and I am having a hard time pinpointing it exactly. Mouthfeel is very smooth and slightly chewy on the tongue. Carbonation is light and velvety, and the beer leaves the mouth with a perfect amount of saliva and dryness. This beer seems to be a perfect fit for the cold winter months in front of a fire, and is really a bizarre take on the saison. I am very intrigued, though I can’t say whether I actually liked it or not. This beer is definitely worth a try, but I don’t know if it’s worth coming back too."

"This beer poured out as a deep brownish black color. The head was foamy and tan in color. The head settles slowly and leaves a ring around the glass with some scattered lacing. The smell of the beer is peppery with some sweet roasted malts on the nose too. The taste of the beer has a nice soft breadiness, with a touch of spice and some very nice caramel notes in there too. The mouthfeel is kind of creamy with a light carbonation. Overall this beer is quite nice, very enjoyable, looking forward to having my next bottle."
""
""
""
"O: Hopefully it's better when it's newer. If I ever come by a better example, I'll be happy to try again and amend."
"Overall this is just a yeasty, phenolic mess that I cannot get behind. Little to know malt flavor and way too much phenolic yeast and spicy clove flavors. I can appreciate a good saison, even a black malt based one, but this is not one of them."
""
""
""
"O- Overall, a fine beer with enough complexity for relaxed appreciation, yet drinkable enough to quaff heartily. It has almost nothing in common with a saison, not sure why that's listed as the style. The label says ""Belgian Style Ale"" which is more appropriate."
"I'm torn between reviewing this beer on its merits, and reviewing it as a saison, which the GI rep said it was. It's really a different animal, though, more like a lightly-hopped black IPA than any saison I've had. Interesting, decently tasty, but not one I'm likely to drink again."

"Very nice and interesting beer."

"D: another winner from GI. really like all these bottled conditioned, belgian styled brews. cant really find a dud in the bunch. a very unique saison."

"I would describe this more like a Belgian stout than saison. The roasted malt detracts from any saison qualities."
""
"O: The roasty qualities of a Robust Porter mixed with the spicy yeastiness of a Saison. Licorice, cola, cocoa, black pepper and barnyard. Very spicy and crisp. A nice Black Saison."
"O - Great complexity and a really interesting contrast of flavors."

""
""
"I love the other Belgian brews from Goose Island (Pere Jaques, Demolition, Matilda, Sofie), but I'm not digging this one. It's a hodge-podge of unbalanced tastes, and the oxidation is so untypical for Goose. I had a hard time drinking this 4 pack and had to give 2 away. Definitely wouldn't buy it again, but support their other brews with bombast."

"D: This was a unique saison with spicy character and darker malt. Nice scent and taste, with smooth finish so it was easy to drink. I'm curious how it would be in 5 years, but it was nice fresh (not amazing)."

"Pepe Nero pours a very dark brown, just a shade of two short of full on black. More than three fingers of light tan foam rush up to fill the glass, coming right up to the lip before slowly edging back down. Lacing is left in a pretty solid ring at the top of the glass, but is fairly spotty below that. The nose features the rustic spiciness of rye moreso than the more intense heat of the advertised peppercorns. The peppercorns are still pretty subdued as far as flavor goes, again upstaged by the more earthy rye. There's also a big dry, roasted chocolate presence, that at best was minimal in the nose. It's just a bit too roasty for my taste. The body ends up coming across as a bit chewy or the style, between the chocolaty flavors and the heaviness contributed by the rye. Carbonation is just OK, showing a little bit of energy. There's a lot to juggle in trying to pull off a black peppercorn rye saison, and Goose Island just doesn't quite pull it off with Pepe Nero."
""
"O: Not amazing, but tasty. I would go back to this one paired with a grilled peppered steak and arugula salad."
""
""
"O: A really bad beer. If they labeled this as a dark belgian ale it would be a very mediocre beer. I was expecting a farmhouse ale and got a crappy stout. Not a good introduction to Goose Island."
""
"Overall: a nice slow sipping beer that has a nice flavor. It is a very enjoyable beer and worth seeking out."

"O: Pepe Nero is a really good beer with a great mix of roast, maltiness, pepper, and light fruity tones. Good job GI."

"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being above average. Overall, it was an interesting beer but it just didn't come together that well for me. The flavors just didn't seem very complimentary to me. Not a bad beer at all, but not on that stands out in the style for me either."

"Pours seal brown with the faintest of caramel highlights, along with an ample khaki head that gradually simmers down before reaching a respectable equilibrium. This looks nothing like any saison I've seen before. The aroma is more typical of the style, however--fresh and invigorating, with coriander, citrus, pepper, and some crisp hop notes. The first thing that strikes me with regards to flavor is how supremely well balanced this beer is. As you first imbibe, individual elements are difficult discern, but you can tell they're quality. Smooth roasted malt and a mild, grassy bitterness ride a wave of prickly carbonation. Pepper is discernbile as well once the first wave has subsided, which should come as no surprise considering it's the only ingredient Goose Island took the time to mention on the label. I think I'm also catching some apple peel in there somewhere as well. The kicker for me, though, is the hint of smoky, bitter chocolate that creeps in on the back end--now that's a sophisticated finish. This looks nothing like your typical saison, and the aroma does not match the appearance at all, but none of that matters when it comes to sheer enjoyment. There's something here for everyone, from chocolate malt to zesty spice, all expertly balanced. This is one of my favorites among a stellar line-up from the adept team at Goose Island."

"A nice loud hiss once the cap pops, the liquid is a dark brown, bordering on black color from a far but up towards light it still appears dark brown. Looks like a Baltic porter or perhaps a quad without carbonation as the skim is minimal with a dark tan hue. No stick on the glass. Smell is pretty pleasant with some dark Saison qualities, dark wheat with some live Belgian yeast giving bread. Some clove while the peppercorns come with warming. This saison is something different, it has a wheat quality while displaying some dubbel characteristics. Some cherry with wheat, going into a light bready yeast taste mixing in with a faint malting. Nuts in the background with light peppercorn flavor. Different for the style and very tasty stuff. Feel is less than medium with low carb so not much bite on the mouth. Goes down smooth and easy as pie. I thinks this would pair well with some cured meats and light cheese. I like this stuff, a bomber was simple to finish while Pepe Nero reminds me of some of Stillwater dark saisons."
""
""
""
"Overall, clearly not a favorite. This is not a traditional saison, at least not the way I think of them although that could be my lack of experience speaking. I wish there were a ""Belgian porter"" category; to me that would make a lot more sense for this one."
""
"Had this before, but tried again at a World Wines and Liquor tasting. Pours dark reddish brown, into a plastic 4 0z. cup. medium carbonated head. Aroma is rich with spices, pepper, belgian yeast, dark fruit. Taste is fairly sweet up front with loads of pepper present. Some bitterness. Fairly quick finish. Light to medium body with some carbonation. Nice, simple but solid brew."
""
""
""
"Overall: Goose Island makes some great Belgian beers and this is no exception. There were a few points where I felt this brew got a little ""busy"" and started to take away from the enjoyment. There's a lot of flavor here and it's hard to get you tongue into every nook and cranny. Still, this is more proof that the ladies and gents from Chicago are still putting out some good beer."

"o - pretty good and an interesting beer, but not really my thing. seems a bit rough around the edges. not in a hurry to try more of this."

"Overall I was quiet impressed with the beer. Didn't know what to expect from a dark saison, but I thought it was very interesting and worked well."

"Taste is caramel, roasted malt and spicy. It really is not characteristic of this style, but it tastes OK. Carbonation is high. Drinkability is good but alcohol was surprisingly warming considering it was only 6%. It seems to taste more like a saison as it airs out and warms up. MIght come back and update after I drink all four of these."
""
"Pours a jet black with a light tan head. In the aroma, a light roast and small caramel notes. In the taste, small caramel notes, roasty, and small dryer notes in the end. A small bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthful, with a small dry roast and somewhat light oatmeal sweetness in the aftertaste. Not so much Belgian, and more stout like."
""
"Plenty of carbonation to hold the head, and a nice lighter body with a dry finish. This is quite easy to drink, though, not quite session able. I still like it though."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a bad beer. Leaves a little bit unsatisfying however, like it could have used a bit more umph on the malt bill. The caramel just didn't quite cut it with enough flavor upfront to balance it out. Definitely would not have hurt to have a bit more of an herbal earthiness or spiciness as well. Would definitely also benefit with a bit more age I think. This one is about only about four months old and may become more complex with a bit more time."
""
"D: Not sure it is really a saison. More a light & interesting Baltic Porter or a very strongly characterful schwarzbier. Rather minimal on the peppery & earthy yeast notes that usually mark a saison (even with peppercorns added). And a bit lacking in the usual attenuation and dryness. No funk of any kind. Whatever style bucket it fits in, it is one drinkable and tasty brew."
""
"Pours a very dark red amber, almost black. Medium tan 1 finger head and nice lacing. Aroma of dark and roasted malt, light citrus. Taste is dry rye, dark and roasted malts up front. Finishes dry with a peppery aftertaste; a smokey flavor also present in the finish. Unusual flavors and interesting ale. My taste/smell is not perfect after a flu, so this is worth a retry. A bit too dry for me, but still intriguing."

"Its a very complex flavor - light and billowy on the tongue, it has an aerated feel while bringing to the front plum, pepper, chocolate malt in the middle, and a finish of cloves and white peppercorn. Delicious. Maybe it's running home in the rain, coming in soaked, and grabbing this out of the cellar, but it's really hitting the spot and I can see enjoying it regularly."
"Overall I thought that this was a pretty good and unique Saison, I knew as soon as I poured this into the glass that this wasn't your average Saison, the dark color threw me off at first but as soon as I smelled it I knew it was still a Saison. This beer has pretty good drinkability, I could drink a couple of these and if I had another one I would drink it, it also went very nice with the flank steak I had for dinner, one of the best dinner beer pairings I have had so far. What I liked most about this beer was pretty much everything, I especially liked the added complexity that the roasted malts imparted, that made for a Saison that was unlike any I have had before. There wasn't anything that I didn't like about this beer, I am usually not a fan of the barnyard funk. but with this beer I wouldn't have mind a little more which is very unusual for me and I think that given a couple more years in the cellar that the funk would be a little more prominent so I would like to try one with a couple more years on it. I would buy this beer again when looking to switch things up a little, it is a little pricey, but I think that this beer is worth the price. I recommend giving this beer a try, the roasted malts make this beer quite different from your average Saison. I am glad I took a chance on this brew and I am pretty surprised and impressed with how well this beer turned out, who would have thought that roasted malts would work well in a Saison, but they do, maybe more brewers will experiment with dark Saison's. I am starting to think I should give this brewery more credit, they can make some solid Belgian inspired beers and I liked the added creativity in this beer. One of the better Saison's I have had, Golden Cap is still my favorite traditional one, but when it comes to nontraditional Saison's this beer takes the cake, good work guys."

"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a CCB tasting snifter. The pour is jet black, big white head, nice lacing. The aroma is kinda bleh, some fruits, peppercorns. There are some fruity esters on tasting, peppercorns, dark fruit, the finish lingers with some sweetness. The body is light, good carbonation. A decent Belgian style ale, but not a saison."

"alright 12oz bottle poured into a tulip gives a big rocky off-white head that just sits on top of a deep coke brown color, showing moderate retention. the nose is very sweet with raisins, light caramel, yeast, figs and a coca-cola like scent. don't get a lot of peppercorn in the nose but its there and a good swirl helps. the taste is of yeast, clove, toasted malt, a touch of bitter hops and spiciness from the pepper is present in the finish with a touch of charred flavor. the mouth feel is just under medium with a very fizzy carbonation and is easy to drink. overall im glad i was able to try this but i enjoy more of a crisp farmhouse brew with some bitterness that is much less sweet and finishes much more dry and refreshing, this is really not a saison and i don't just say that because of the color. the balance between fruits, spice and bitterness is just not right. although this isn't the best of style it could still be enjoyed on a hot day while not confining to the typical brews. just not my favorite. thanks for the opportunity D!"
"Overall a wonder beer, very enjoyable."
"Pours a dark brown with an amazing cocoa head. Good lacing on my snifter glass. Way darker than I was expecting for this style of beer, but oh well. The nose is yeast, malt, peppercorn, and wheat. A little on the light side, but still very pleasant. The taste is a little surprising- it changes by the millisecond. Same profile as the nose, but it goes from sharp bite, to malt creaminess, barnyard funk, and almost a hefeweizen type finish. Overall, a good beer that has a few flaws keeping it from greatness. Cheers."

"Overall, a very drinkable twist on a standard saison. The roasted characteristics make it a nice alternative for the winter when you're not in the mood for anything too thick."
"O: I loved this, what a great idea. Really kept the surprises coming. Would recommend this to anyone and plan to age a few."

"On the palate, the Pepe Nero is just as complex and equally as subtle. Very soft hints of malty sweets, a little bit of coffee and chocolate here and there, and just a touch of dry bitterness on the finish. I let the Pepe warm completely to room temperature before finishing and the Pepe only gets better! Somewhere between a big belgian quad and a softer style stout, the Pepe Nero is in a class all it's own. I can hardly wait till the Goose Island beers are available regularly here in CT."

"Overall, this turned out to be a great pick up. I had one of these in my hotel room while I was still in Chicago and was extremely disappointed. Maybe it was the small dixie cup sized glass I used... I dont know. But this beer was ALOT better this time around. Very aromatic and a very creamy mouthfeel. I'm glad I have 2 more of these to enjoy."
"Overall this is a fairly tasty beer from a great midwestern brewery. I am a big fan of GI, so I am predisposed to liking this. There is no reason to not try this. Good stuff."

"D: Okay. A bit flat, a bit dry, not a very full flavored saison."

"An interesting twist on the saison. I love saisons, but the peppercorns are just too weird for me. I would much rather prefer a traditional saison. Like the bite of the rye though. I think Goose Island in general hit what they were going for."

"O – Worth trying once, would I buy it again, I doubt it. Surprised that it made the Draft top 25 of 2011 list, but also this could an introduction of the “newest” style, black saison."
"O: An enjoyable interpretation of a Belgian, although I do prefer Unibroue's offerings."
"O-Darker than I expected for a Saison but still tasty. They say you can age it for up to five years and now I'm kinda curious what that would end up like."
"Serving type: bottle"
"This is an interesting take on a saison with the most noticeable difference being the dark characteristics. It is ok but a bit overpriced in my opinion."
"Bottle: Poured a black color ale with a medium brown foamy head with average retention and light lacing. Aroma of light spicy yeast notes with some Belgian malt with light notes of spices. Taste is an interesting mix between some solid Belgian rustic malt notes with some peppery notes and some spicy yeast. Body is about average with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Very solid offering with an interesting mix between the rye malt and the spicy yeast strain."
"O: not what I'd expect from Goose Island for balance and representation of the style"
"Overall a pretty blah beer, a few good things going for it but it doesn't come together to make anything interesting."
"O - I haven't had a ton of experience with the style, but it comes across to me as a fairly underdeveloped dubbel"
"Overall this was a very unusual, but quite well executed saison. It was decently complex and the true flavor comes out in the aftertaste, I would say. It is just a tad flat (flavorwise) in the beginning. The bottle I reviewed was aged for 6 months."
"Overall: A most interesting beer; the flavor palatte comes at you from all directions"
"TheBeerAlmanac.com"
"Overall: A very complex and interesting take on a Saison. Very tasty."
"The flavor is closer to a Saison than the smell. There's some earthiness. The body is thin and the carbonation is very high--the only true distraction. The swallow features the true farmhouse sour bite. The beer doesn't look like a Saison, but it surely tastes like it."
"I was really in the mood for belgian beer and dark malt, so this fit the bill. I'm not sure if I'd go for it again, but I'm glad I tried it."
"Overall good to go. Nothing weird, just a great drinking beer."
"I freaking love this beer. It's one of my new favorites. Its earthniess and woodiness work wonderfully together. This beer is remarkable."
"O: Meh, just doesn't do anything for me. Too many flavors that I like to see at the opposite end of the spectrum, not mixed together. I could see how people would like it (my girlfriend likes it), but this just isn't my thing. I understand the gray areas and the Belgian concept of style, and I appreciate it, however taking this approach to it in this situation does not work for me."
"Tasty and enjoyable, this is simply unlike any farmhouse ale I've had before. Not much spice or herbiness to it, it reminds me more of a Belgian style porter with hints of dark fruit. Whatever label you want to give this though, I'd recommend grabbing one, warming it to a comfortable 50 degrees, and giving it a pour in your favorite chalice, goblet or tulip glass."
"Overall: A unique and interesting beer."
"Overall good but a little strange. Black Saison? It IS creative but I'm not so sure the Saison needs patent malt added to it."
"T: Dark fruit and yeast alongside roasted malt. A slight hint of chocolate and plum. I never picked up any pepper flavor and the beer doesn't really remind me of a saison in any way (almost like a quad-lite), but I like this beer, whatever style it may actually be."
"Pours a black color. 1/4 inch head of an off-tan color. Great retention and decent lacing. Smells of roasted malt, sweet malt, alcohol, yeast, and dark/tart citrus. Fits the style of a Saison / Farmhouse Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of slight alcohol, sweet malt, yeast, tart citrus, slight liquor, and slight roasted malt. Overall, a much different saison, than I am used too. Never had such a dark roasted saison, but it was still really good."
"Pours very dark brown, almost black , with enormous head on initial pour. Nose is surprisingly light with figs, dark fruit, and cocoa powder. Black pepper is all over the palate, especially once it warms considerably. Dark fruits again, some sourness, and plenty of carbonation. Surprisingly light for the dark appearance."
"A pleasant beer, but it doesn't seem to have much of anything to do with the saison/farmhouse style (or any Belgian style in general). There's not a whole lot to the flavor, though, and it gets a tad old."
"D - Overall, not a bad drink; I think there are a lot qualities that are hidden in the beer that come out after aging; could be a classic drink with age at least a few years; I think it would definitely increase in flavor complexity and mouthfeel"
"Actually reminded me a bit of Bestefar from Haandbrygeriet. Maybe not to style very well, but it's tasty. I'm a fan."
"O: Very unique beer. It has some different flavors but they seem to come together nicely."
"I do believe I'd enjoy this as a session beer without a doubt. If it weren't for the $9.99 (4-pack) pricetag, I most definitely would. However, the quality is top notch and without compromise. I honestly cannot find anything wrong with this beer. Great job, Goose Island!"
"Mouthfeel is dry and rough. Overall, it's an OK beer."
"O- I wasn't a fan at first, but this has grown on me a bit, or at least I begin to recognize its merits. As suggested on Goose Island's website, this is probably best served with some grilled meat to work with the peppery flavor. Certainly not your typical saison..."
"O: Despite some misgivings, it's a good beer. I'm glad I finally tried it. It's an interesting combination of bitter and refreshing. I do wish it had a better balance and more peppercorn, but it's good."
"O: this is an impressive beer. I like the surprise element involved here - a dark farmhouse ale that smells much brighter than it looks but tastes much darker than it smells. I've had this with enchilades mole before and liked it a lot. I wouldn't pair this with any spicy meal - it might overwhelm many thai dishes, for instance - but anything rich and spicy would be perfect. Vindaloo would be perfect. OK, yes, great beer."
"-JH-"
"This beer pours a brown color with a decent sized off white head. The smell is peppery with other spice notes throughout. The flavor is crisp a little roast character that you don't expect in a saison. Th flavor finishes with a nice peppery touch. The carbonation is high and the beer is fairly dry. Overall a pretty good saison"
"Overall as stated much better than I thought. Enjoyed the Peppercorns. Very drinkable."
"O. I came to this beer with no expectations, but I did a little research at the brewery's website first. A black saison? Why not? There's nothing to say that you can't use darker malts in beers that are traditionally pale. It modifies the flavour - sometimes for better sometimes for worse, and this case I think it works. It just makes it a bit more challenging to review because there are no benchmarks to grade it against - it's mostly down personal preference with something as uncommon as this."
"The body was also about average for the style, medium, crisp and tart. Drinkability was pretty good (but then I generally find Saisons to be VERY drinkable). Overall, a nice beer. I'm not sure I'd grab another 22, but if I saw it on tap, I'd surely have a couple. Worth trying for sure."
"Overall Impression- From the start, does not look like ANYTHING like a Saison! Even the smell wasn't so great but ended up being above average. Would rather throw people towards the G.I. Sofie instead of this one."
"Initially it seems over-carbonated. The flavors seem in between a dunkelweizen (light malt flavors, lots of wheat) and a porter (very roasty and toasty). There's also some funk in there, which the carbonation actually helps to even out. The's a hop bitterness in the aftertaste, but there aren't a lot of IBUs here. There is an interesting dryness through the middle of the mouth, too. I might have said a Belgian-American porter. Maybe that's why it's disappointed so many as a saison? I like it a lot."
"Disappointed in this brew. Was surprised to see this billed as a saison as I didn't get any of the spice flavors I've has with other saisons. Yeasty sour flavor with mild aftertaste. Pretty bland with no depth."
"O - This is almost like a borderline black ipa but with weak hops and lots of spice. Not my favourite mix of styles but it was okay. Wouldn't seek out again."
"O - An interesting brew, not sure I would call it a saison. Big tastes of dark fruits and a bit of Belgian yeast. Crisp carbonation makes it very easy drinking."
"O: A nice saison, different take on the style with the darker color. I would happily buy this again."
"O: not bad, but not the greatest. It was cool to try, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it again."
"D -- Interesting, worth a try. Not sure if I could drink more than one in a night, but solid brew."
"O: this beer is just too confusing for my palate I guess. The mingling of too many beers is what this feels like and even though it has some pleasant qualities it isn't very drinkable."
"Having Goose Island's Pepe Nero at Sapsucker's Hops & Grubs, in Huntington, NY. A very good dark beer with lacing on the creamy but thin head.  Notes of black pepper and hints of dark chocolate.  The roasted malts, black peppercorns, and slight bitterness that cleanse the palette. "
"Overall I'm not a fan of this beer. It was interesting to try but the concept was better than the execution. I've had one other black saison and I loved it. I think it was a collaboration from Mountain Sun and Avery. Wish I could do a side-by-side. Oh well...it was an experience."
"D - Not my favorite but could session."
"O: Great flavor, not what you think of with a farmhouse ale"
"Drinkability is fairly high. The flavor profile is decent and with moderate ABV it creates an easy drinking beer. On a side note, I don't see how this even resembles a Saison/Farmhouse. Edit: As it warms it's a little farmhousey. I don't know that I love all the roastiness in there though for this type of beer."
"O: I really like this beer. lots going on...perhaps a little too heavy on the roast flavor, but great otherwise"
"O A great saison, i am going to stash a few away and see how it changes id like to get more peppercorn out of it."
"Overall I purchased four of these and each time I have somewhat struggled to polish each one. Something about the peppery and tobacco combo just doesn't make me enjoy it too much. I have one more remaining and will probably cellar it for a number of years as the label states it can ""develop in the bottle for up to 5 years"". Worth a shot."
"O: Unlike any “saison” I’ve ever had. Some of the saison aspects are there, but there is a splash of something darker as well. It’s good, but I think I’d take a traditional saison over this one."
"O.- I wasn't sure what to expect from a dark Saison but I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. This is definitely a beer that I could drink all day and not get tired of. I really enjoyed it."
"O- Started awkward but ended nice. I would like to try this again, perhaps a bit fresher. Definitely a different take on a saison; not as crazy as Existent, but definitely not traditional."
"Overall: Enjoyable and interesting due to the fact that it was a dark saison. There were aspects that were familiar to a regular saison, yet there were also aspects that were new from the addition of dark grains."
"overall not a saison at all but a very good beer non the less."
"jd"
"This a really nice beer. Interesting taste, pleasant to drink."
"O-An interesting combination, this dark saison has decent flavor, the aftertaste is a bit offputting, will see how it ages"
" Overall Very good Saison crisp and refreshing.I want to get more of this. Not as good as Sophie but pretty good.Should try if you like Saisons."
"Overall, this beer is a very interesting take on saison. I've never seen a black saison like this, so I like it."
"Dark brown body and a 2-3 fingers of khaki colored foam. A little lacing. I'm mostly just getting some toasty malt in the aroma. The peppercorns come across nicely in the taste as a very fresh ""green"" spiciness. Pretty good beer overall, but I don't think it's worth the price. It's pretty much a brown ale with peppercorns."
"D- a very interesting melange of styles and flavors, one of the best of the recent ""hybrid"" type brews i've tried. the other half of this bottle will go with the ribs i have on the smoker as i type this, and with some grilled vegetables fresh from the garden."
"Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. It kind of falls flat in the aftertaste department and has a bit of a bitter linger to it."
"This is certainly an interesting beverage, and not bad at all, but it lacks the complexity and intangibles of a world class saison. Nonetheless, a beer I'd be happy to drink, and probably fantastic with food."
"O- a roasty and fruity saison with notes of smoke and pepper..not my favorite interpretation just different..it was enjoyable to drink.."
"O- Good beer, very well made, just dont think its the right combination of flavors."
"Pours a deep brown color with a two finger light tan head. The wad slowly recedes to some splotches and a ring. The beer is dark enough that I cannot see through it at all, not even to see carbonation. The smell is of molasses, spice and a touch of funk. The taste starts clean and slightly sweet. In the middle I get a bit of the lifting sensation from the carbonation, but not as much as I have experienced with other saisons. Onwards the end of the taste i get some coffee-like taste that I can't exactly place, then a clean finish. This does not match my definition of a saison, but it is a good beer nonetheless."
"Drinkability - good stuff, though it doesn't do a whole lot for me. I find myself enjoying the stout side more just because I tend to like that style more."
"overall, this was not a total dainpour but the offering just didn't work for me. i appreciate the think-outside-the-box approach, but i prefer to keep my porters and saisons separate (i.e. in the traditional fashion.)"
"An easy drinking, roasty and malty farmhouse ale like nothing I've ever experienced before. I'm glad I tried it."
"Quick review: Pours super dark black with minimal off-white head. Nose is packed with classic dubbel notes, fruity and figgy. Palate is smooth and wide with lots of roasted flavors but a clean texture. Reminds me a lot of an export stout. Peppercorns don't make a huge impression, sad to say."
"Drinkability isn't half bad. Neither the aroma or taste are truly powerful, and the latter isn't balanced enough from the dominant bread notes. Otherwise, this brew surprised me."
"Lightly roasted malts and coffee up front. Some nuttiness, along with some tannic woodiness. Lightly sweet milk chocolate and a bit of licorice mid-palate. Yeasty, slightly fruity notes lurk. More roasted coffee bitterness in the finish, along with some spicy, peppery, earthy notes. Develops more complexity as it warms. Moderate body, with a bubbly, effervescent feel. An interesting beer; would be nice to see how this ages (i.e. some sour notes would be cool)."
"- I did try this bottled and it was incredibly not as good."
"4/4/3/3/3"
"Medium carbonation, medium mouthfeel for the style. Overall not bad, nothing that stands out as amazing to me."
"Poured from 12oz bottle (2011 - though I wish I let it age a little longer) into a dimpled mug. Pours a dark amber color with a small light tan head. The aroma is mostly Belgian yeast with banana and clove, but also has some black pepper, bunt rye toast, and a dash of funky citrus. The flavor has a lot less potency than the aroma, but did pick up sweet malt, roastiness, pepper, and Belgian candi. Sweetness becomes toasty bitterness, with a touch of soap on the finish. Light on the palate, with a small amount of frothy carbonation throughout. Did not meet my expectations."
"One of the best beers to drink with meat, especially BBQ pork. I have had this beer on several occasions, and it is a wonderful Black Saison, with traditional citrus and wheat flavors, but has a smokey/black pepper finish. The smokey peppery finishes really compliments meats very well. Truly a great beer, good on its own, but really compliments food nicely! One of many Goose Island beers that really is made for dining."
"I don't like this beer as a saison and I don't like it on it's own. This is my second black saison and if I don't see another that's just dandy."
"Malty, dark and roasty, not getting much if any traditional ""saison"" characteristics. Maybe some light pepper in the finish. Eh...not really sure what to make of this one, others said ""stout", ""porter"" "schwartz beer/saison hybrid"" and even ""black IPA"" If you are looking for a nice saison that looks and tastes like a saison, this is not for you...Decent enough drinker, but not really doing much for this saison lover..."
"O: While this is begging for a new style tick (black farmhouse ale!!! Who's with me??), it's unremarkable in execution."
"It's tasty, roasty, toasty, chewy, gooey…and it's good beer, and you can drink it. That's a good one, two combo. let me assure you. All beers should have that."
"O: I really really like this beer. Normally, I'm a little overwhelmed by farmhouse ales. I like them, but cant drink them all night. This beer feels a bit lighter to me. The peppercorn is not very evident."
"Other than color, the black peppercorns didn’t seem to add much to this interpretation of a farmhouse ale — but it still succeeds as a flavorful, drinkable brew."
"Hops: Pilgrim, Saaz"
"Overall, interesting and pretty good; certainly one of the more interesting and unique beers I've had at this ABV level. Probably not something I'd want to have all the time, but I'd get it again."
"As a saison it's nothing amazing, but as a unique style-bending beer it's nice."
"An interesting beer, but at least for me, I don't think the rye flavor goes all that well with the saison style."
"O: This beer is very interesting because the peppercorns make it taste almost like a “black saison,” if there is such a style. The pepper is not overpowering, but it does mask some of the other flavors that you would typically expect from a saison."
"Overall: I strongly disliked this beer, and would probably argue that a dark saison is a mistake."
"O - This is a very dark saison, I have not experienced many but stays pretty true to the style. Easy drinking, and the bottle says will develop in the bottle for 5 years. I wonder what this would taste like then."
"The taste has malt and some peppercorns that don't play as integral a roll as I would have expected. I get simple, heavily toasted, and medium roasted bread grains with white peppercorns. Pretty pleasant and enjoyable brew. Nothing extravagant, but something I would buy again."
"overall, a very interesting take on this popular style. the peppercorn and dark malts go with the saison yeast very well. i can see homebrewing something like this in the near future..."
"Pours a dark bown with mahogany highlights, decent cap of bubbly khaki head, decent lacing. Scent contains notes of dark yeasty bread, carmelized sugars, touch of roast with dark fruit and peppery spice. Taste follows scent but with a musty and earthyness (a saison/farmhous i see). Medium bodied, quite bubbly and prickly. A nice beer which benefits from the darker malts and the earthyness brought about from the yeasts."
"Medium bodied and a bit creamier/fuller than expected with some tight carbonation up front that fades toward the end of the swallow. The spicy/peppery presence from the aroma is very powerful and dominates the flavor, lingering throughout into a spicy dry finish. In addition to black pepper I'm picking up some chilies that give the beer some heat in the finish. It's also slightly earthy and funky but not as much as the aroma suggests. A good balance of roasted malt, dark fruit and spice. Hints of roasted chocolate, toast, grape, fig, raisin and plum. Slightly sweet and vinous but the dark malt notes and spicy peppers even things out. It could be to heavy on the spice for some but I enjoyed it."
"Overall really interesting, pretty good, nice saison flavors blended with a bit of darker malts, touch of cocoa and some creamy malts, bit of funk and tartness, and fruits, nice."
"O - Can't remember a dark saison I've had befroe this. Definitely worth trying again."
"The beer pours a pitch black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has your typical saison peppery scent along with a touch of roasted character and Belgian yeast spiciness. It's quite dry and earthy with a pretty solid Belgian yeast nose. The taste is outstanding! It has such a complex array of flavors. It has a really nice roasted/chocolate malt character that does mute some of the traditional Saison character, but it also seems to enhance the experience. It still packs in a serious amount of esters as well as a bone dry finish. The black-ness really adds a layer of depth that contributes to a more well rounded malt character. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a very good beer. I haven't had much experience with this style, but I sure do enjoy this one."
"O: Very easy to drink with lots of flavor. I would buy this for a treat if I find it again."
"The flavor is a little bit roasted, a little bit pepper, and plenty of standard issue saison. Slightly woody, with lemongrass and earth notes. The roast is well restrained but noticeable, sweetness never drops in, and bitterness is the order of the day. Dry, medium bodied, and well carbonated. Interesting beer, I enjoyed this bottle."
"Goose Island is a brewery that rather than embrace traditional style guidelines, they hold them at arm’s length. Pepe Nero is a very unique creation that has elements of a Belgian Saison, a German Roggenbier and also the other few North American ales I've had that were brewed with peppercorns. Labeling it any style is out of context; it's an exceptionally well-crafted, ingeniously thought out, and delightfully drinkable ale. That's all there is to it."
"O - This has good drinkability. I was a little worried about this when I saw how dark it was, but it proved to be nice and refreshing. Overall, I thought this was a very nice saison, and I recommend giving it a try. I would buy this again."
"Overall, not bad, but I'd prefer a normal saison over this. Interesting enough though."
"- Hops: Pilgrim, Saaz"
"O: Just a really good beer, it's at its best over 60F for sure. No matter what is going on with GI and AB, there's no denying this is well made."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation. A nice black saison, like mine but less funky. Good stuff, thanks Rob!"
"Overall a beer that, from first impressions, seems like a winner. However, with each sip, my mouth grows more tired of the heavy-handed pepper. Worth a try if you're into such beers."
"Very dark for a saison. Molases brown with a smokey head. Notes of yeast, a little fruit, a little bit of pepper, brown sugar. Dry, but balanced. First sip yields to a burst of sweet, fruit flavored bubble gum and then quickly turns over to a dry finish with a good amount of pepper. The start and finish of each sip are very contrasting. The sweetness of the malt carries over towards the back end of the beer and covers up part of the pepper flavor, which seems to work to this beer's advantage. The pepper adds a nice dynamic, perhaps even better if this were a paler beer (it still, however, works nicely in the nose)."
"Drinkability – A black saison of sorts. An interesting beer with nice earthy, roasty, and herbal characteristics. Unique and a decent beer."
"Cheers!"
"Overall, one of these new fangled black saisons that I am not familiar with, but this leaves a good impression."
"22 ounce bottle, bottled 3/4/2011. Poured a dark brown color with a largeish light brown head. Aromas of roasted malt, bananas and brown sugar, but really none of the promised peppercorns. On the palate, this one is fairly light bodied and tart, with a little funk, roasted malt and spices."
"Overall (Drinkability): Not what I expected from this beer. The bottle says Belgian Style Ale, the style on BA says Saison. Ignoring labels, the beer is pretty good. It's got a unique array of flavors that I don't come across too often, and they come together nicely. I've got one more bottle of this that I'll enjoy, and I can see myself grabbing another bottle or two if I see it in my travels. Cheers!"
"O- A great beer for those times when you want something light, but not too light."
"This would be easy to drink. Interesting without being strange."
"Overall, an interesting and enjoyable take on the farmhouse ale. I'd happily have it again."
"O- Nice spice to it as a saison would, but very different. The malty notes balance it out and make it very easy to drink."
"O - I can't say that I hated it, but I seem to be the only person who doesn't really think it can be called a ""good"" beer. It's average... drinkable.. I didn't pour it out.. but even if I'd have brewed this myself.. I'd still think it was an average beer."
"A bit of a miss here. The beer needs some more of the yeast flavors. I like the sour note but it needs something else to go with it. I didn't pick up much from the darker malts. Not sure why they are there."
"D: it was actually really drinking quite well but was not as flavorful as other saisons I've had in the past. Still a cool dark saison."
"Light and thin in the mouthfeel, but not inappropriate. Overall, an interesting mix that works pretty well."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. Like a Belgian Saison, but with a bigger roasted malt profile. Interesting and nice."
"O: Well, a brown Saison. Worth the try - I'll likely try again."
"Creamy nice mouthfeel from the dark malts. Light enough for a saison at the same time. A bit of a bite at the finish. Nice unique beer I give it up to GI for this guy."
"O: Very different from what I was expecting. Doesn't have much farmhouse character, and I never found the peppercorns. I'm enjoying the beer, but it seems like something more in the middle between a brown ale and a porter to me. I'm marking this down a bit for not being to the advertised style, although it's quite good."
"O – Much better in the bottle than when I had it on draft last year."
"O- This is good, but I won't buy it again, flavors besides the peppercorn could be more intense."
"O - All jokes aside, the aroma, while somewhat cloying, is actually pretty good. I dig the peppery notes and spiciness. There's no flavor though! Certainly not worth my $3, Pepe will go the way of Hall's 'special beers'; down the drain."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D- This beer was very dry and astringent in the roasted black malt flavors and it covered up a lot of the other flavors. The fizz really enhanced the dry bitterness in the finish not that that was really a good thing and there was no saision yeast character noticed which was a bit disappointing."
"Pours black with a touch of chestnut at the rim with a creamy off white head into a tulip. It leaves some very thick beautiful lacing as well. Nose is sweet red fruit, belgian yeast, some interesting funky spice notes, and maybe some sour apple/pineapple. Taste is classic saison, odd as by looks you wouldnt expect it. Earthy barn yard funk, yeasty spice, sour red fruits that hint at citrus. Mouthfeel is slightly diluted but a nice beer regardless."
"EDIT - After much deliberation I lowered the Taste score. After I was done eating I proceeded to polish off the bottle and the black pepper became more and more assertive and astringent. This was not noticed when paired with the steak, but the score needed to reflect the beer as a stand-alone...not everyone will be having a nice steak with it. So if you get this, make sure you've got enough steak to last through the whole bottle."
"Glad to see this one on tap to try. Really surprised by the appearance of this beer. It's a very very dark brown with tints of ruby color held up to the light. As given to me the head was about 1.5 fingers worth of sandy brown foam. In both smell and taste I found this beer to be light on the spice I was expecting. Really the spice taste was more in keeping with what I get in some rye based beers than in the peppercorn kick I thought I'd have. I picked up on some light hay/grassy notes with small notes of citrus, maybe some orange zest and slight lemon touches as well. I was struck by how ""dry"" this beer was. Nothing sticks in terms of the mouthfeel, and it almost reminded me of a dry champagne for that category. Overall this beer was very different than anything else I've had in the saison style, but it just wasn't what I would want on a regular basis. I still am glad I tried it though just for it's uniqueness."
"O: I really enjoyed this - I wasn't so sure what to expect, and was even less sure when I saw the color of the beer, but it's a very interesting (in a positive way) take on the style. I loved the challenge of everything that was going on, and the flavors that counter those in your typical saison really shine."
"Overall: I like it, pretty solid. The flavors are nice and would certainly be refreshing and great on a warm summer day; ABV isn't too high to enjoy a few, I would gladly sip on this all evening. Cheers to Goose Island... Well, at least for now. We'll have to see how this whole InBev thing goes..."
"this is def a beer you might want to share, not boozey at all but just a kinda wierd taste. I couldnt drink a whole bomber of though, just beware of the nasty pepper sage aftertaste"
"I remember enjoying the other black saison I've tried (though I can't remember right now what that was exactly), so this one from Goose Island sounds pretty intriguing. It pours a smoky-garnet-tinted black-brown topped by a finger of sandy off-white foam. The nose comprises dark wheat, mild Belgian yeast funk, rye bread, light figs, and a hint of clove. The taste explodes the clove, adds some black pepper, lightly chars the wheat and toasts the rye, and morphs the yeastiness into a light green apple-ish flavor. The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a pretty damn dry finish. Overall, a pretty nice brew, but the dark spices are overdone and seem to o'erwhelm and lethally strangle the other flavors. More balance would be a great boon to this beer."
"Had a bit of trouble figuring out what Goose Island was up to with this beer. The bottle notes that it is brewed with peppercorns, so I was expecting a prominent black pepper bite, but there was only the barest hint of pepper. Fairly malt-forward, with moderate caramel malt flavor. A touch of yeasty funk, but quite reserved. All in all, one of the less impressive Goose Island European takes."
"o - pretty damn good. not too funky, not too spicy. nice balance with a sophisticated flavor."
"O-Very deceptive for a dark beer, refreshing. I've had other beers brewed with black pepper and had a similar experience where the taste turns out very clean and refreshing."
"A unique approach to the saison style overall. Exactly the type of creativity I love about Goose Island."
"overall - I was expecting much more peppercorn flavor. instead, it was kinda non-descript."
"Like I said before, these guys are one of my favorite breweries in the country and this is just another reason why. Complexity, flavor, and easy drinking all mixed into one. Another huge plus is that saisons are not really my favorite style but this one is probably the farthest deviation from its origin but my favorite example so far. Goose Island has another one under their belt in my eye, and I sure hope this whole merge with AB doesn't end up sour because I know they will be truly missed."
"Overall this was a good beer. I really enjoyed the flavor of this thing. The whole experience seems well crafted. I encourage you to pick one up if you see one and give it a try."
"I've been impressed with Goose Island's recent Belgian releases. Pepe Nero isn't the best of the bunch, but it is the most interest and intriguing. I was not expecting a black Saison. Didn't know such a thing existed. It honestly works better than you might anticipate. The dark, malty flavors aren't at odds with the Saison flavors, but I don't think that they add a great deal or advance the style in any degree. It's a bit like a Black IPA in that respect. Nonetheless, it's definitely interesting, and it is good beer. Certainly worth checking out."
"Interesting! Is there such thing as a Belgian Black IPA? Yeast looms a bit too large, which keeps this from being a classic, but complex layers of black malt and hops (and peppercorn) spice plus a luscious feel making this compelling drinking."
"O: I wouldn't have pegged this as a saison type of beer just from drinking it. It's not bad, but fairly uninspiring."
"Good but not great. I probably would have again."
"The palate opens with a moderate bitterness with cocoa and a moderately resiny, spruce-like character. Mildly grassy and hay-like with a moderate acidity that's grainy in nature, this is a pretty dry beer. The acidity is enhanced by the high carbonation, making this really crisp (like a good saison should be). A prominent roasted malt character is present, not really what I was expecting, but given that the yeast isn't particularly expressive here, it adds a big and interesting character to the beer. Medium-light in body with high carbonation, this is not really to style, but is still an enjoyable beer. Even warming it up doesn't really bring out the aromatics like I was hoping."
"D - Fairly drinkable. Taste is a bit different than most saisons with the smoky flavors. Otherwise, interesting and different and fairly tasty. Pretty decent balance."
"Notes: Not a bad offer from Goose Island at all. Maybe short of the marketing, or the way it has overflown the isles in some places, but it is still quite a good brew. In fact it may be good as a social quaff."
"Overall a solid, but not terribly interesting Black Saison..."
"I like this. A different take on the saison. Checks all the boxes of what I look for in a more sessionable saison, but adds in some complexity to the malt."
"Overall- A decent idea from Goose Island, but the beer is just not that good. Not a whole lot going on, the first real miss from their otherwise excellent Belgian line."
"Drink- Overall this was different, unqiue and quite tasty. I would have this one again. A nice big bottle with good flavors and was nice to sip on over about an hour."
"4/3/3.5/3.5/3"
"O: One is enough for me."
"in the world of saison. I'm particular towards the dark stuff in march. The spice bombs, and meaty. This was something that was that but so clean around the edges that latitude is marginalized. The malt and spice make it a tight package. The peppercorn close the palate and make it quite dry... The feel is frothy that contracts like a lager. A fallout like a good doppelbock. Malt is similar to something along those lines. Toasty. Pour is amber with a off white head. Not meaty. Grassy citrus with a toasty finish malt and bitter munich."
"This beer is interesting, complex, fun, and very drinkable."
"Finish: Coriander is still very subtle with pepper flavors lying on the palate"
"It doesn't seem to fit under the saison category as I mentioned earlier, but I don't care, this is a solid, solid beer. I guess I would hope for a more of the peppercorn to stand out since they tout it on the bottle, but this is a really drinkable beer that I could see many novice craft beer drinkers liking."
"I think it's an OK beer. It's easy to drink. But to rate it according to its style as a saison, one of my favorite styles, I found it came up lacking in flavor. I give it points for originality on the pairing of pepper with a saison but wasn't in love with the final product."
"O: I kinda like this. Not what I expected. I was expecting either heavy pepper or heavy Belgian funk. This was neither. More like a woodsy, leathery, spicy rye stout."
"O - Slightly better than average overall impression as it is a little bit interesting due to the peppers, but not like I really would seek this out."
"Thanks to seeswo for the extra. 2011 vintage served in my New Belgium Globe glass at 53 degrees. Pours a reddish brown with a dense, two inch cream-colored head that eventually settles into a solid, quarter inch skim. Spots and strands of lacing revealed during the tasting and exhibited good retention. Nose expresses clove and coriander and a trace of earthiness. Taste consistent with nose; however, there's also a slightly buttery flavor that comes out in the middle of the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a lively carbonation and a mild, creamy texture. Overall, a decent domestic farmhouse, but not a lot of complexity here. Nonetheless, it's pleasant and drinkable, although lacking some of the character I've come to associate with the style."
"O - I like this one a whole lot, had it on tap next to Stillwater's Existent and I enjoyed this one more. Not sure if I would be down paying bomber prices for this one though, and glad I don't have to."
"Overall: An interesting take on a saison. There are a few too many flavors fighting for attention. I don't think I'd have it again, but it definitely wasn't bad."
"O - Overall I like this ale, and as I must admit to a great deal of ignorance of this style of ale, I hope my review doesn't do it an injustice. It's very good and I would try it again very happily. The one negative I would attribute to it is its price. At $8.49 for a bomber I think I could find greater value elsewhere."
"Great marriage of contrasting styles working together surprisingly well, very drinkable."
"This beer is very porter-like, but has the funky yeast quality of a saison. Interesting and flavorful."
"D - This isnt bad, just not my kind of saison. Was looking forward to this one but I'll stick with something else."
"Reviewed from notes. Pour yields a nearly-black beer with a mocha-colored head and some nice retention. The nose has a bit of earth and pepper along with some Belgian yeast spiciness. The peppercorn really stands out in the nose, and that carries over into the flavor. A bit of roasted malt in the flavor along with some earthy woodiness. Mouthfeel is medium with a bit of spice and good carbonation. Drinks fairly well."
"drinkability not good - if you dont like the flavors why drink it"
"Notes: more obvious peppercorn would have really made this brew great. otherwise its just ok. this whole blackening of pale beers isnt my thing - there is too much of a negating factor going on. not a bad beer, just nothing great"
"D - Very different, certainly not a session beer, but great for a night of tasting different brews."
"The finish is smooth and clean, and even slightly quenching. It would be easy to drink lots of this beer, but not the most exciting to do so."
"D - this is an interesting brew by Goose Island - it is a new take on the saison style for me. It is another winner in their Belgian Ale lineup, however I was hoping for a bit more peppercorn from this beer. Either way, good beer from Goose Island."
"This Belgian farmhouse-style ale opens with some rather beautiful bottle art...sparse, stark, and classy. It pours a deep, dark amber (almost black), with a nice, thick head and lacing on the glass. Hmm. A provocative aroma! I get a little heat, no doubt the peppercorns, rather than the alcohol (it's a relatively tame 6%). The taste? Wow. This is different. I get a strong malt sense in there, but it's quickly tamed down by the spice. It all finishes well with a peppery roastiness on the palate. It's all balanced and well-tasty. Superb!"
"A black saison. A winter saison. Jon's bottle, and finally caught up with this one that I missed in NYC. A dark body, above average mouthfeel, a sipper of chocolate, coffee, spruce, pepper. Cross-style with a shwartzbier. Wonderful aroma.Bit of smoke."
"Pours black, brown shows up in light, slight white head and light lace on the glass. Smells of yeast, dark fruit, slight chocolate and coffee notes, raisin and a leathery note round this off. Taste is of yeast, light sourness, tart, lemony and a slight roasty quality are here. Solid and runs a wide range of flavours very complex brew. Solid mouthfeel, medium to light weight and good use of carbonation. Drinks very well and would be a great all night brew ABV isn't too high so it can be sessionable. Good stuff."
"D: This beer is very nice. Not among the better saisons I've tried, but then again, I'm new to the style."
"D: I'm not sure this is a true saison, but it is pretty dern tasty!"
"D - I think it's drinkable. I like it, and it's not too big or whatever makes things undrinkable. It's not that."
"Drinks like a Saison with a little twist and no peppercorns are evident to me. I'd like it a lot more if they did show up."
"I drank this while eating some spicy bbq pizza which turned out to be an excellent pairing. Overall, it's ok. Something a little different."
"Another good Belgian beer put out by Goose Island."
"Pours very very dark. Almost black. A decent amount of off-white head that hangs around for quiite a while. Coats the edges of the glass nicely. Smells malty and sweet. Some floral yeast aromas and a nice touch of almost chocolate on the nose. Tastes rich and malty. Sme subtle roasted flavours combined with the floral yeastiness. Might have almost a peppery taste. Fairly sweet compared to what i was expecting. Good mouthfeel. I fact, feels great on the palette. Vry drinkable as i would expect for a beer like this."
"Aroma and taste were very surprising as I thought this would be more of a Belgian dubbel at first glance. This beer is obviously a ""dark"" or ""black"" saison. Very interesting and different. Curious to see if any of the big name Belgian saisons will try this style."
"An enjoyable beer, but if I was forced to rate this purely against other saisons, it probably wouldn't come out as great as I'm rating it here. Here, I'm not going to let the idea that I don't really think this is a saison interfere with my enjoyment of the beer. Very good drinkable beer, but as a ""dark saison"" I think Jolly Pumpkin's Bam Noire outclasses it, not to mention Fantome's Dark White."
"Notes: Not sure what to call this. Saison doesn't seem right. Reminds me in some ways of a porter (the burnt toast/char flavors and the color), but not exactly. Whatever it is, it's solid, as expected from Goose Island."
"D: This is a nice saison. I'm a little confused as to why it was blackened. I was searching for roasted grains and came up empty. Pretty good balance of flavors, but again, the carbonation is a little harsh."
"A beautifully crafted saison with great drinkability. Lighter bodied ale pours a bright coffee brown with mild tan head. Aroma is sweet and roasty with yeast undertones. The sweet caramel, toffee, and pepper spice blend nicely with the light roast malts that carry this enjoyable brew."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - A very smooth and silky feel that is quite pleasant. Sort of feels more like a red ale with porter characteristics. Quite creamy in the mouth."
"(12oz bottle courtesy of jcnd9803!). Pours cola color with thin off-white head. Aroma of candied sugar, belgian yeast and spice. Taste is malty sweet with a slight punch of spice. Medium bodied with a creamy texture. Fizzy on the tongue. A pretty tasty beer!"
"D- A bit dry which keeps it refreshing. Not particularly interesting, but not bad."
"The beer appears shockingly dark with a tan head. Initially, I think that I have been served the wrong beer, but alas, Pepe Nero is a dark saison. D'accord...The rye comes through quite strongly, with an odd and interesting aroma and flavor of funk. Not funky like wild yeast, or odd like I got a bad beer, just funky and odd. Ya dig? The flavor brings subtle chocolate and roast flavors, but I can't discern peppercorns, per se. The feel is medium bodied with a solid carbonation level. Overall, this was intriguing and fun to try, but I'm not interested in having it again."
"Overall- somewhere between a dubble and strong dark for style. A fine, very enjoyable beer. But I'd be lying if I said I wasn't disappointed that the black peppercorns weren't showcased more. The chocolate flavors totally overwhelm them. Thinking about this, I recall reading that Goose was going for a dark saison--boy a saison sure didn't come to mind while drinking this. Worth a try, but don't expect the peppercorns to take you for a wild ride. "
"D: It is an easy drinking beer but this really is not a saison other than in name. Not a bad beer at all just not a saison. Call it something else and the scores might go up."
"Beer is light in body and smooth but the finish is quite bitter and roasty. There is some spiciness / yeasty breadiness in the midpalate, it was OK but nothing special. I was disappointed."
"D: While the bulk of the review may make it seem as though I am giving a rather harsh review the beer is really more enjoyable than this review lets on. Standing back from the beer a bit and giving myself time to enjoy its nuances opens the beer up just a bit more. Good beer but will not be replacing any of my current favorites from the Goose Island reserve series."
"Decent carbonation level. It could stand to be a little bit less carbonated for some palates. I appreciate that the beer remains dry despite the addition of malts not usually found in the Saison style. Unfortunately, this expirement does not make for a shining example of drinkability in the style. It lacks depth, favoring an aggressive clove & peppercorn flavor profile, and the cooked spinach-like finish becomes tiresome in a hurry. Still, it's a fun beer and worthy of a purchase if you haven't tried it before. While this beer disappoints me, I remain very excited about Goose Island's entire, fantastically-labled, Belgian-Style Ale series."
"All in all I enjoyed it. The pepper wasn't what I expected which turned out to be a good thing. I want to see if the pepper comes out a bit more if it sits for a while, the botttle claims 5 years."
"It's an interesting take on the style. I enjoyed it, but with so many other options out there I doubt I'll have it again."
"D: It's drinkable, but not something I would purchase again. Nothing too special about it other than it being dark for the style it represents."
"Pours black with a fluffy off white head. Smell is roasty and fresh and phenolic, with a little plummy sweetness. Flavor is roasted and plummy, with a sweet coffee-ish toffee character, with a chalky, slightly metallic bite. There is a pleasant coffee-like bitterness on the finish, with brown sugar and beets in the mix. The mouthfeel is achingly dry, almost astringent."
"This beer pours a dark brown almost black color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into a small cap of lacing. The aroma is of bubblegum, roasted malt, dates, and a hint of anise. This beer smells nothing like any saison I've ever tried, but is does smell quite good. The taste is similar to the aroma. It is very malty with a lot of Belgian yeast phenols. and a bunch of roasted malt in the finish. The mouthfeel is on medium bodied with a cloying texture, and low carbonation for any Belgian style. Overall, this is a nice beer that I could drink again."
"Drinkability: Comes across as a more mellow Saison with just a touch of roasted malts (most noticeable by the molasses aroma and taste). Also, reminds me a little of a Dunkelweizen. Overall, mellow but very drinkable and enjoyable."
"D- meh, this wasnt my favorite saison, or my favorite thing goose island has produced. ill sit on a couple of others i have for a while to see if they get better, but i wont be rushing to try this again for a while."
"22 ounce bottle, bottled on 1/7/2011. Served in a tulip, the beer pours dark brown with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is peppery spice, roasted malt, chocolate, and some bananas and dark fruit. The brew tastes like roasted and charred/burnt malt, bananas, peppery spice, bittersweet chocolate and a bit of dark fruit. There's also a slight bitter roasty/burnt finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and silky and has good carbonation. A little too much carbonation for me, but that's not a big deal. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and enjoyable. I think it's a solid overall brew, it's definitely worth a try. I liked it."
"D: This is pretty good--a successful brew. Not a normal saison, but well-executed nonetheless. Very balanced with a nice ABV make for a solid drinking experience. Perhaps too tart for winter but too dark for summer, I'd call this a mid-March quaff."
"4.5 D: Good beer. I decided to give this a 4.5 for drinkibility because a lot of the above scores could have easily be the next highest. Good flavors and interesting. I would like another, but I only have this one."
"D: the abv and the unique mingling of toasted and sour flavors are unique and worth a bottle or two."
"(D)- An interesting take on a saison that I rather enjoyed. A bit richer and darker representation, but it was well done."
"Not for me. Something simply was not happening here, the beer looked fantastic and after having Ithaca brewings dark Saison this passed summer, I was looking forward to trying some more but this was a beer in conflict."
"One of these a night is enough. Not bad at all, in fact a solid offering, but just not what I'm looking for for the long haul."
"D- Would have no problem drinking two or three. Goes down smooth. The mouthfeel is the best part about this beer. Another solid Goose Island offering"
"Drank in February 2011 - will drink again in a few years."
"Overall this beer was only OK. I think this beer could likely get a lot better with age and I will throw a few in the basement and maybe review again in a few years."
"First the black IPA and now the black Saison, I certainly applaud the creativity. Whether or not this beer would ever be top notch for its ""kind"" it has definitely set a path for a new direction that I hope will be explored by other brewers. I don't know if I would give it a definitive saison label, but I have little to suggest otherwise. I would say if you can find it, and you like either saisons or stouts, give it a try. There are worse things you could spend $7.99 on."
"Notes: Bottled 01/03/11. Interesting beer, not quite what I was expecting and doesn't seem entirely focused but it was good and definitely has some potential. Not really like a saison with roasted malt, chocolate, rye and earthy flavors being strongest. Worth of try and it is good, but it could be better."
"I've been anxiously awaiting this beer's release, especially since I've never had a black saison before this one. This beer pours a silky dark, dark brown that is on the verge of black with a light half finger dark khaki head that laces the glass. It resembles a stout. The smell is very funky and earthy. It kind of smells like wet dirt after a rain, but in a good way. The aromas are a little subdued. The flavor is interesting. Comparing this to a usual saison probably isn't fair. It has a lot of funk, a good amount of yeast, but then it finishes with this slightly bitter flavor, kind of like plastic. I don't know if it's the peppercorns or what. The mouthfeel is probably the strongest part of this very fresh saison. It drinks and looks like a stout. It's crisp when it hits your palate then mellows to go down very smoothly. I'm a little disappointed yet I didn't know what to expect from my first black saison. The flavor is just very different. I'll age another bottle to see if it ages as gracefully as Goose Island's other bombers."
"D= A very tasty beverage. I can see myself drinking this with some grilled meat in the early spring for sure. This begs to be paired with grilled meat. Drinking it by itself I don't think it holds up as much. This is really a beer that is for pairing and sort of makes one step back and realize how well integrated beer can be in cuisine."
"Drinkability -- While this beer didn't wow me, it was incredibly easy to drink. This could possibly be my favorite of the non-sour Goose Island Belgians. A quality dark saison."
"D: Quite drinkable. Very nice overall, and the peppery finish is interesting."
"D: easy to drink: i love that it is a dark saison - unique and interesting beer. worth a try...."
"Creamy feel, medium bodied, dry and slightly bitter. Not so much as a tingle from the pepper. Pleasant mellowness in the finish, the light roast and mild coffee flavors arrive first, with some earthy peppercorn notes, but again, not all that spicy. Feels more like a straightforward Belgian Dark Ale without the sweetness. Not sweet at all, again fairly dry. Some estery qualities for sure, banana almost... Fairly phenolic with notes of clove and licorice."
"D: This tastes nice, BUT very disappointed after reading the label stating it a was Belgian Saison/Farmhouse Ale w/peppercorn. Tasted more like a Belgian Strong Dark Ale meets a porter. Still worth trying, but not cosmically divine."
"A fairly easy to drink saison for a change, but seems to be missing the so called pepper feel that it boasts about. So I am not exactly drawn to it."
"D: Glad I tried it, a nice version of the style, but wouldn't personally seek it out again. The alcohol is about right with the 6%"
"D: It'll take me a while to finish this 22oz bottle, and I wouldn't be longing for another."
"D: I really dug this. I really liked that this take on a black Saison included lots of earthy hops, pepper, and bitter dark chocolate. This is not a dark Saison with lots of bright fruit, funk, and hay...it's somehow a little more sinister."
"Overall: A great beer from a great line of beers. It is a unique and interesting twist on the typical Saison, and is unapologetically original and interesting. Recommended!"
"Pepe Nero is a let down after being so pleased with Sofie. I'd be interested in trying this after spending some time in a cellar."
"D-This is a pretty easy drinking saison. I've had a couple that were a little too in your face with the yeast notes and barnyard, but this one avoids going in that direction. As a result, this is a very approachable beer that I would recommend to people who are new to the style."
"Drinkability: I have not had a black saison before, but this is a valuable addition to their lineup. Definitely something I will come back to when I am thinking about a GI, particularly after their very middle-of-the-road Belgian series thus far."
"I liked this beer, but it is not a session beer for me but is an exteemly easy drinker. Well worth repeating and it went well with my Farmer's Panini."
"Though Pepe Nero is a very clean and drinkable Saison, it lacks the intensity of flavor and the raw earthy notes that make authentic Saisons so desirable."
"1/2"" dark tan head at pour. Dark brown/black, pretty much opaque. Good head cover doesn a good job of trying to hang on throughout entire drink. Spotty lacing on glass. Spicey, peppery, dry saisony aroma. Has that musty, earthiness to aroma. Mild to moderate carbonation. Hop and woodiness to the finish, malt picking up a little on the long finish. Mild fruitiness to the middle of the drink. Also picking up some roasted malt and coffee notes. Really carries the drinkability of a regular saison. Flavors overall seem balanced with a good level of complexity. Not your typical Saison/Farmhouse but a good take on the style and another good speciatly from Goose Island."
"Very drinkable beer. Interesting to see what it would be like with 6 or 12 months in the cellar. Have to stock up on a few, or just brew my own."
"Very drinkable, but not a beer I wold make a long session out of. Had one 22oz bottle and that was a good amount. Will be picking up another bottle soon to see how it conditions over time."
"Overall, an interesting take on the style, but I kind of like it. Somewhat drinkable, but I wouldn't want too much of it."
"could drink a lot of this but the finish is missing something. nice beer!"
"Fairly drinkable, a couple in a sitting would be welcome, though not necessarily my first choice."
"An interesting style, but not my favorite."
"d - An ok beer but more like a brown ale than a saison, as others have noted. Probably wouldn't seek out again."
"D - Not what I look for in a saison. I really like the soft and light saisons (hennepin/sofie being my favs). This would be the deeper darker cousin to sofie. I'd have a sofie over pepe nero any day of the week in the summer (or any time really since that's one of my favorite beers period), but this one could be a great fall beer if you are into matching beers with seasons. Today seems a bit warm for such a dark saison...I think I'll stay inside with the AC instead of bringing this one on the deck in this 95+ degree weather. I don't think I'll have much trouble polishing off this 1/2 growler. I'd have it again for sure. Great gateway saison beer for fans of darker beers."
"Pours a dark black with very little head. Smells sweet with hints of fig. Taste is sweet like molasses with a hint of pepper and tobacco. Mouthfeel is thin but I like it. It's also quite sweet. Drinkability is good bit the unusual flavors detract. Overall a very good brew as it's quite different from the norm."
"Pours a clear amber with a decent eggshell colored head that falls to nothing after not too long. Nose is a tight pine tone. Flavor is...a bit unusual for the style, I think. A bit earthy and rough on the aftertaste and slightly stringent. And there is a bit of an unpleasant alcohol burn on the end too that stays in my mouth as an aftertaste. Seems a bit wrinkled and needs a run through with an iron to straighten things out a bit. Which I guess sums things up for this beer in general really. Not entirely a miss, but could've and should've been a whole lot more."
"D - This is a pretty nice brew. I'm glad I found it on tap."
"Tasted on draft at Bad Apple. Pours almost black with a tint of amber. The head is thin but long lasting and off-white. Nose of rock candy, yeast, some breadiness, and both light coffee and coconut. Flavor is very light considering the color with citrus, candy, black pepper, yeast and bread. The dark malt comes through on the back with coffee and chocolate. Carbonation and body are both fairly light with a long, dark finish. Overall, this beer is good but not great."
"Dark semi-translucent brown with some sandy head. Leaves little lacing. Smell is a bit of funk, some fruitiness, and a bit of peppercorn. Tastes pretty good, a some more of the fruity saison flavors, but with some chocolate and peppercorn mixed in. Very interesting. Light body, not a ton of carbonation, very smooth. Very good drinkability, I really enjoyed this while I was waiting for the Cubbies to start."
"This is something like what Fantome is doing, but much cleaner. It isn't bad."
"I enjoyed this beer. It was easy to drink and very refreshing."
"This beer is really good to drink, just don't call it a saison or drink it expecting to get that."
"drinkability: ok, didnt need a 2nd"
"D: This one isn't mind-blowing, but it's still quite good and a great attempt at pushing the envelope."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is a bit weak, slightly watery. Reasonably drinkable, the complexity is something that needs to be focused on to appreciate."
"d. goes down easy. just like GI's other offerings it goes down easy with loads of flavor. a dangerous combination typically, however it's $4 beer night and I think I'll have a few more."
"D: Pretty good. Unique take on the style."
"I dont know if I had a bad glass due to the fact that it was a new keg or a keg that was tapped wrong or mishandled or if that is the nature of the beer. Based on previous reviews I think I might need to revisit this beer."
"Overall a nice beer, not something worth trading an arm and a leg for, but fans of unique American takes on Belgian farmhouse beers would love this. I dig some other GI beers more, like Sophie, but this was worth a shot!"
"Pretty good, albeit different and interesting brew from Goose Island...was surprised at how dark it poured for a ""saison"" and thought the roasted malt was definitely different and unique..."
"Notes: I was very surprised to not find this listed on BA but re-checking with Ray's Place in Kent and then the Goose Island Web site I was assured that the name of the beer is correct. No word on the ABV, unfortunately."
