"Cloudy straw color...smells exactly how it tastes...moderately tart, lemony and peppery...every once in a while I'll get some sweetness that I assume is the honey fighting through...the flavors being moderate seem deliberate though and makes for superb drinking...typical chewy HF mouthfeel rounds it out and makes for a very nice experience and probably my favorite non fruited HF saison"

"My second HF saison, and I continue to be unimpressed. Yes, it's clean and nice and inoffensive, but man does this bite the hell out if me. Tastes like brett, super dry, very little flavor otherwise from the malts. Very light bodied almost to the point if watery. It's just fine and inoffensive, but I've yet to find much more overrated than this. Hand me a Tank 7 off the shelf, please."

"Poured into a tasting glass, Anna is glassine golden straw with a robust, rock-and-cream head and a central column of effervescence. The bouquet erupts from the glass, dominated by green apple, wet grass and honey. The taste opens with a mix of tartness and earth, but this gives way to a biscuit and spice finish. If there’s one adjective for Anna, it’s dewy. This is a sweet, pastoral ale, mixing citrus, bread, honey, apple and hints of ginger, brown sugar and pepper. Anna is full and zesty but also refreshing. This is a product that showcases the liquid component as strongly as its malt, hops and adjuncts. It’s just so damn drinkable, you have to stop yourself from swilling it down."

"Bottled on 09/2014. Drank side by side with East Bank. I liked the East Bank more, but would love to drink this again. Worth seeking out."

"Overall - Complex with lots of taste and a great mix of flavours.  You can tell this is made of some high quality ingredients and it is well crafted.  It would be nice to drink beers like this every day.  World class stuff."

"It's the same base as other Hill Farmstead saisons and the honey adds enough dimension to keep it interesting. Well worth the try and just a touch above the rest."
"Much love and thanks to @Roguer for this one as well. This whole box has been one revelation after another!"
"Over carbonated, tart, funky not my favorite thing from them ever."

"Yet another good Hill Farmstead beer. It's not quite on the level of their best beers, but it's still better than 98% of farmhouse ales out there."
""
""
"Light, crisp, apple skin, bit funky. Delicious."
""
"O - This is delicious and just right for me. The flavors play off one another and are surprisingly balanced."

"In a nutshell I am NOT a fan of beers brewed with honey. Most have a slippery/slimey mouthfeel, and are over the top sweet. But being a Hill Farmstead product I was excited(but not optimistic) to give  Anna a try.  This beer breaks the mold for Honey brewed beers. The mouth feel was soft not slimey, the flavor was incredible. You could taste the wildflower honey but the uniquely sour flavor brought balance and complexity. The weak link in this brew, if you can call it that is the slight sour milk aroma, but that is nitpicking. This beer was probably the best beer I consumed in 2014, and probably top 10 all time. Bravo Hill Farmstead!!!"

"Described as a Honey Saison, but it is much more complex than that. First bottle was good to very good. A few weeks later and my second bottle was so much better to me. Very smooth. Definitely honey-like and not unlike Biere De Miel. Before opening my second bottle I described Anna as geuze-like, but 750 ml was too much geuze. I take that back, this is simply a delight."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very refined beer with hints of wildflower honey and mild but addictive sour taste.  Definitely a world class beer.  Pots fruitful, pours beautiful with a nice light color, white head and 6.5 undetectable abv."
""
""
""
"Damn good beer, although the hype may have caused me to be slightly underwhelmed."
""
""
""
"This is a nice brew, and brings a unique flavor profile.  Not sure it should be wildly sought-after, but it's better than most any off-the-shelf farmhouse ales with wider distribution."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I am not a big fan of the soapy and slick character I seem to get throughout.  Along with to much honey sweetness in the finish.  Not that it is bad at all, just not particularly what I am looking for in the style."

"Anna is perfect example of a farmhouse brew.  The aroma is filled with barnyard straw, hints of honey, and pepper.  The taste is spot-on: soft lemon and honey flavors are balances with hints of clove, allspice, white pepper, and orange marmalade.  Love this brew fresh, and curious to see how it ages."

"O: This ale is clearly the culmination of travel, and insight, of friendships and explorations, and of realizing a sense of one’s place.  Would drink again; among saisons, this is good but not to the level of most Fantome stuff."

"Fruity on the nose with a sweet banana and ripened pear aroma. Notes of clove and spice with a bit of peppercorn the scent takes a doughy, malty turn. The flavor as a nice direction of honey, lemons and tea with some peppery taste. It's very light, sprite and bubbly on the tongue with a finish of Apple and pear. This really is what a Saison should be."

"O- Another nice saison from HF, but I do not get much honey. More of a lemony sweetness to it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Quite the accomplishment with this one. Love the honey sweetness changing it up. The tartness balances it out beautifully. Complexity is not over the top but the sheer mastery that Shaun reigns in this style category shows up all over Anna. A beer to drink now, and one I suspect well age graciously over the course of a few years. Stoked to sit on some and revisit in two years or so."

"Pale blonde colour, big white head with some lace left behind. Smell is quite fruity, apple and lemon, some orange, a bit of wheat and honey, lighjtly funky as well. Taste is fruity and tart, lemon and citrus fruit, dry with grassy flavours and a bit of dill also, the slightest suggestion of honey, funky with just a slight sourness to it. Dry spritzy carbonation, medium bodied. Solid stuff as was expected, however I think I enjoyed Arthur more but would certainly entertain this again wiothout question."

"Pour is hazed golden color with a tight white head. Nose has a strong floral note, faint honey, juicy notes and light sweetness. Taste is very nice, floral up front like Clara, juicy bright fruits as the well carbonated finish brings in the sweet honey balance. Very tight and balanced, nice dusty quality mid palate from the Saison yeast with an interesting sweetness of honey in the finish."

"One of the better saisons I've had from HF. I'd say that this is Brother Soigné without the extra citrus flavours- I may even appreciate the more subtle flavours here. It's just so damn good and refreshing; somewhere in between a lambic and a saison as all Hill Farmstead sours/saisons tend to be."

"O: This beer is the real deal; I love HF saisons and this may be my favorite. With nearly a year of age on this bottle there's so much nice funk and sourness. You can taste the brett lambicus. HF's house ale yeast is bacteria heaven! I can't get enough! This bottle of Anna was just short of spectacular for me."

"O: The essence of the style. Vermont Farmhouse Ale. No other American brewer that I know of can either match or exceed the qualities and characteristics of the finest Belgian Saisons/Farmhouse Ales."
""
""
""
"Overall. A very nice and flavourful saison with that signature Hill Farmstead style. Always a treat to drink something from these guys."
""
""
"O- A nice saison, has a solid mix of flavors, highly drinkable, I would definitely have this again if it were available."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I always approach trendy, hyped beers with a bit of caution, but Hill Farmstead is legit. There's a reason they have just exploded; their beers are world-class and completely worth seeking out, Anna being no exception. This bright and aromatic saison is fermented with their strain of exceptional yeast for a total sensory experience that's dangerously drinkable and quick to disappear. Cherish each rustic sip, for this saison is hard to come by and worth it's weight in gold."
""
""
"Verdict: A truly wonderful Honey Saison from Hill Farmstead. Wonderfully complex and delightfully balanced, this really is one of the more remarkable American made Saisons, a must try for anyone who enjoys this style."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a nice, light, easy to drink beer and I'd love to have more in the future."
"In a word, gorgeous. Hill Farmstead stemware - Glowing hazy straw body, a healthy white snowcap. Earthy and tart - waves of yeast, honey, grape and pear, and earthy wheaty malts collide. Lemon zest, cut flowers, white pepper, grassy hops. A great saison."
""
"O - Solid Saison with a good sour presence, funk, and slight sweetness from the honey"
""
""
"A very good saison. I preferred this to Clara."
""
"9.0/10"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o - Overall I loved this one. Interesting to see the older reviews of this aren't as great as the newer ones; maybe like some of their other beers they're refined and improved it. Some nice floral hops, citrus hops, and sweet honey throughout and easy to drink, certainly worth getting. Would love to have it again."
""
""
"Medium body, higher carbonation, effervescent and refreshing on the tongue. Flat out, this is just ridiculously delicious. Wonderful balance, depth of flavor and an excellent drinking experience. I want more."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""

"Overall: As a person who isn't huge on sours, this is wonderfully approachable. The taste is right one in terms of sour notes, fruit profile and fantastic appearance."

"It's always a treat to enjoy anything by Hill Farmstead. I thought this was outstanding."

"Original overall score-4.29"

"kind of a funky beer, jazzy and different from the legions of mediocre saisons out there. the fact that this was in colorado, even by trade, had me very excited. arguably the best thing new england does at all is hill farmstead, in my humble opinion. the pour is a really hazy muted yellowy color, creamy white head several inches high continues to rise. the nose is obviously sweet, a honey focused brew no doubt, but the low key spice and cirtus qualities of the yeast are evident as an equalizer, and this is promising to be delicious. its an assault of flavor, coating the entire palate, polleny springtime honey is prominent, but there isnt that much residual sugar. the yeast is also just behind center stage, more peppery funk than i thought from the nose, but it does cut right through some of that sugar. there is lemon juice too, mostly in the finish. there is a very mild hop bitterness (also on the citrusy side), before everything gives way to a sort of off yeasty aftertaste, which is the weakness of this beer for me. its not quite metallic, but it is minerally and bitter and not quite congruent with the rest of the beer. creamy texture though and a nice full round body for a beer this light in color, i really appreciate its expansive properties, and the carbonation is fine, although it may contribute a granular character when combined with the unfiltered yeast. overall a nice take on the saison, im now even more curious to try their others."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Let's be accurate here.... There is no question that HF knows what they are doing when it comes to the saison style. Anna is a work of art in the saison department. The honey and grassy component makes for a champagne like experience. I'm glad we have more of these!"
"O-The honey and wheat go together perfectly, having Hopslam before this, this is how honey should be used in a beer. Fantastic stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I must say this is one of the best Saison I have ever tasted. The carb was very creamy, aroma and taste amazing. The hint of honey was ever so light on the finish and the color was yellow as a golden straw. I want more this will be on the top of my list for a long time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - How do they keep doing it? Sweet and tart. Smoot and very nice."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy straw color with a big white head that hangs around for a while and leaves some nice lacing on the glass. The smell is pretty subtle with lemon, grass and a strange yeast smell takes over for me after that. The taste is is more complex with a lemon bite right off the bat followed by a honey sweetness and a lingering citrus tang and spicy after taste. The mouth feel is pretty light but right for the style. Overall Im very impressed with another beer from Hill Farmstead, hopefully they have this the next time I make the trip."
""
"Pours a hazy lemon yellow with a huge bubbly white head that persists forever being constantly fed by a steady stream of carb bubbles and leaving much lace on the sides of the glass. The aroma is citrus, spicy and a bit funky. Light pepper with lemon and grapefruit aromas mixed with a spicy wheat bready character and a solid shot of earthy yeast funk. The flavor is a little sweet with light sugar and honey before we segue into some really nice juicy citrus and tropical fruits. A hint of pepper and spice and a little bit of yeasty funk and a light tart fruitiness provide a really nice contrast. Medium body with a spirited level of carbonation and a sweet bubbly mouthfeel. This is a great saison! I normally won't go for the style, but if this were more available I could see this being my go to warm weather beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: really great sweet taste with phenomenal mouthfeel the smell isn't heavy or strong as I'd like and the color is close but not perfect with a lot of head still a really great offering from hill farmstead true to style tastey and easy to drink I would definitely drink again"
""
""
"Anna was definitely not the best beer I have ever tried, but it was truly flawless in every regard. Furthermore, it was one of the most unique beers I have come across in a very long time. Hill Farmstead does it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"It's hard to get a firm handle on the color of Anna due to the dim lighting, but it appears to be a mildly opaque golden to lemon yellow. Two fingers of airy white foam crown the beer and hang around for a minute. A light dusting of lacing remains attached to the glass. The nose is very pleasant, with aromas of lemon zest, straw and a touch of freshly cracked black pepper. I take a sip, and here the malt character is more bready than straw like. Subtle black pepper comes in next and quickly transitions to a finish that features both lemon and a soft fruitiness. The body is well dried out, and the carbonation supremely lively on my palate. Just a superb mouthfeel all around. I haven't always been as impressed with Hill Farmstead's saisons and sours as I have with their porters and hoppy beers, but Anna is a fantastic brew."
"Very tart for a saison, and yet still get a whole lot of layers of interesting fruit combinations. More tart and less funk than what I remember from the bottle. A fantastic saison."
""
""
"O: this is a good beer, and I think it shows how much a yeast strain makes or breaks a saison. I am not typically a fan of this style, however, with this one, even though the yeast is a major component of the flavor profile, i still find its lightly earthy tart funk very enjoyable...."
""
""
"O - A very solid and well made saison. The addition of honey is nice and provides a subtle sweetness to balance out the spice and floral aspects."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: My least favorite Hill Farmstead saison to date, but still a home run. Delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with an effervescent lively level of carbonation. It opens up awkward and slightly off-putting but grows on me as the experience continues. For 6.5% the alcohol is present and warming but not distracting. Having this once was enough to satisfy my curiosity, I dont have much interest in trying this again."
"3.5 D: I looked at some reviews after making mine and I must say that either this bottle is different from what others have been drinking or they are imagining smells and flavors. That said, it's a good beer, but I'd take a HF IPA or porter over this anyday."
""
""
""
""
"Bottle generously shared by colonelforbin. Thanks Mike. Pours a slightly hazy golden amber with a big white head that has good retention and leaves a decent amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is a funky barnyard earthiness with some honey as well as a light peppery note. The taste is funky and earthy with a bit of honey flavors, but also quite dry. The finish is dry with some floral notes and a bit of lingering honey. Medium body. Medium-high carbonation."
""
"Bottle: Poured hazy bright straw color ale with a super large foamy head with excellent retention and super good lacing. Aroma of light rustic malt notes with nice floral notes with lightly sweet honey notes. Taste is a good mix between some rustic malt with light hay notes and sweet floral honey notes with light hoppy notes. Body is above average with great carbonation and no apparent alcohol."

"Cheers!"
""
"M-The mouthfeel is incredible with the carbonation being high with a medium to low body. A perfect exacmple of this style. Will be sad to see this one go when I drink it all."
"O- This was the first bottle we tried during our tasting. Personally I enjoyed it a lot more then E. and Art. I loved the honey flavoring that balanced with the light barnyard funk and made an very drinkable saison. Definitely one of the better saisons I've had."
""
"O: I thoroughly enjoyed this saison; very much so that I almost ordered a second glass, despite the fact that there were 14 other Hill Farmstead offering on tap. Very glad that I got to try the base beer for Ann the night before Ann was released."
""
""
""
"Overall - Yeasty as hell with some nice flavors, but nothing outstanding. It's actually a little dull. As always, it's perfectly crafted."
"Overall great, nice saison flavors, just a hint of floral hops that add and don't subtract from the beer like a lot of hops would, honey adds an interesting component that is light but dries the finish nicely, decent malts, and great yeast flavors that bring good farmhouse flavors and border on funk but don't quite get there. Wish I could get lots of this for the summer."
"This isn't my favorite saison from HF, but it's still a good or better than many out there..keep up the awesome work!"
""
""
""
"Saisons are on the very low end of my style preference, but this was a very well made one that accentuates the good and downplays the elements of the style I don't like. Another winner from HF."
"Initial taste was extremely Bretty and sharply bitter. Mellows out into a much nicer beer as it warms with the yeast taking its place amongst the other of flavors. Malt somehow stays with the nose and doesn't permeate into the flavor profile. The final balance is rounded and clean, yet still sports tons of yeast. Good carbonation level. A pleasant saison, though it's a healthy step or two below the best HF brews."
""
"Golden straw honey pour with an enormous head, lots of lacing that sticks around. Smells of earth, spice, lemon, honey, banana and pepper. Taste is similar, although somewhat sweet with honey. Decent saison but nothing to write home about. Medium body and mouthfeel."
"Overall this is classic Saison and well made. If you're fan of the style, as I am in the summer, don't pass thist one up if you see it."
""
""
""
""
"Take the label off of the beer and any aficionado of Belgian ales will undoubtedly declare this as one of the country's finest farmhouse ales."
""
"Drink- Good, but I think they do DIPA's better. Although, wanna give Damon a go."
"Pours a clear light yellow with a bone colored head that settles to some small bubbles on top of the beer. No lacing on this one. Smell is of grain, spices, citrus aromas, and a sour/tart presence. Taste is much the same with an emphasis on the spices along with a yeast flavor. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer but I think this one smells better than it tastes."

"O: Very solid overall. I would have liked a little more mustiness, but it was enjoyable and easily drinkable."
""
"O: Wonderful beer. I found myself returning to this bottle for more samples. It has just the right amount of funk and flavor that I love in saisons. Hopefully I'll have another chance to try a bottle of this brew."

"Overall, another excellent saison from Hill Farmstead. I wouldn't say this is my favorite saison they brew at all, but it is really light and refreshing. Great for a summer day."
"pours an effervescent pale yellow with a thin white head. the nose is a big Bretty funk with an interesting hoppiness. This nose is outstanding with a slightly sour, funky, sweet, and bitter. The beer is very drinkable with an excellent aftertaste, highly recommended and worth trying."

"Anna is a very tasty, well balanced beer. Savor each sip."

"Anna pours a light bodied beautiful bright honey gold in color with a soapy two finger, bright white head. The nose is full of citrus fruits, an array of spices, dried oatmeal, lemongrass, and bubblegum esque Belgian yeast. A GREAT nose. The flavors feature a floral and citrusy bouquet of deliciousness, more bubblegum yeast, slight hop bitterness, and light funk. It has great and well rounded flavor. The bugle gum and yeast are superb. It drinks light and off dry. It is extremely drinkable and has great appeal all around. This was a great beer and I actually prefer it to the other Saisons I've had from Hill Farmstead, but those were in bottles."
"Great beer, glad i had the opportunity to try it."

"Hazy golden-yellow pour, with a cap of delicate white bubbles for a head, decent retention, nice lacing. Floral aroma, light, crisp hops, citrus. Taste of floral hops, citrus zest, mild fruit esters, distant pear notes, grass, light yeasty spice, biscuity hops in the background. Light mouthfeel, soft yet prickly, clean and drying, very nice overall."

"Beer is super duper flower honey flavored, hurts my teeth, not really, relatively light in body, very floral, flower forward beer here. Decent but not my favorite saison from him."
""
"O- A great Saison that is very easy to drink. I really wish I had more than one bottle. I am a big fan of Saisons and this is just jumped up the list to one of the best I have had."
"O: a pretty decent beer, though needs a bit more depth of flavor."
""
"pretty awesome, love the honey used in this."
""
"Pours a light crisp yellow hidden beneath a persistent finger of white billowy foam. Brilliant clarity. The ale yeast dominates the nose with hints of apples and coriander. The nose also has some lemon and the slightest honey note. Flavor is crisply saison with a good bittering addition of hops and some sweetness from the yeast it seems like. There is an industrial flavor on the beer I can't quite place, not unpleasant. Good long musty finish. The beer is thin with high and lively carb with a watery finish. Good stuff. Not sure I can taste the honey as much as others can, but a solid beer nonetheless."
"O - Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. Really like that faint honey in the saison. Very nice farmhouse from an excellent brewery in a farmhouse."

"O - Brewers from the USA have a tough time developing good Saisons, and at times I think it may be a lack of appreciation for the style. This brew really is quite nice for the style, and should (but won't) get points for being American."

""
"This is one of the better Saisions I believe I have had. I seem to like balance more and more, and that is one thing this beer possesses. A little yeast, a little malt, a little bitterness all adding up."
""
"This is an immensely drinkable beer and very enjoyable all year round. It's tasty, light, fresh, and satisfying. So happy to have a chance to try this one. Thank goodness my boyfriend is from New England :)"
""
"I have really enjoyed each style of Saison thus far from Hill Farmstead. Anna is as simple as the others but perhaps a touch less impressive. Rustic and engaging but not as honest and brilliant as the other siblings similar in style. I would certainly not turn down another glass."
"O- A solid saison with just the right amount of honey to add a nice touch, giving a nod to the rich local agriculture that is a staple of Vermont."
""
"O: Goes down easy, very tasty, not filling, mild kick, very nice representation of style. I often forget about the saison style - this isone to enjoy for a bit."

"Many thanks to BHollas for hauling this back from Vermont for me! Poured from bottle into 512 Anniversary glass. Pours a cloudy yellow/orange color, thick fluffy white head fills the top of the glass and recedes slowly. Beautiful Saison appearance. Smell- rustic bready esters, a sweet honey aroma, cloves, ground pepper. Taste- a nice sweet honey up front- a nice hop bite with a peppery finish. Bready, incredibly easy to drink Saison. No ABV at all. Just a really pleasant well made Saison. Would def drink again."
"Can't wait to try more of their brews. I have a bottle of Arthur in the fridge that is calling for me next."
"A superb saison. I would love to have the opportunity to drink more and more of this."
""
"O: This is above-average, but against Hill Farmstead's other saisons, it doesn't climb into upper-tier territory."

"O: Well balanced Saison, low in the funk department, high in the fruity lemon department"
"Notes: A wonderfully bright saison with great refreshing length and texture."
"O: A good saison, but seems a bit one-dimensional. Tasted this one alongside HF's Flora and just felt Flora was much more complex and nuanced, where as Anna felt a little flat and uninteresting."
"Medium body, maybe a little heavier than usual but not by much, nice coating mouthfeel. Overall another excellent beer from a brewer who uses malts & hops as if they were paint on a canvas. Excellent."
"I really liked this beer. I spoke with a trading partner about some of the beers I brought in with my haul from Pete. He said Anna was his least favorite of the beers i received. How much better can the others be?!"
"O - Good saison, complex, fruity, funky, spicy and refreshing. Look forward to trying more of the Hill saisons after having this one."
"This guy gushed a little bit, but not too much... After settling, it pours a hazy pale-ish straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises wheat, lemon zest, orange zest, and mandarin orange syrup. The taste holds notes of tart lemon, wheat, light coriander, and orange rind. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a pretty dry finish. Overall, a pretty good saison, but one that doesn't really express itself all that much: It's solid, but bordering on boring. I hope that makes sense to somebody else out there..."
"4.5/4.5/4/4.5/4"
"O: A really nice saison. Lots of different flavors going on, all of which are enjoyable."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall I thought it was a very good beer. It had a lot of great flavors to it but managed to stay pretty well balanced at the same time. Very drinkable and tasty beer overall."
"Thanks to Thirstybird for bringing this back from his VT trip. 750ml bottle served at 51 degrees in my ST tulip. No freshness dating evident. Pours a translucent orange-gold with a rocky three inch bright white head that sizzles and pops as it slowly recedes into a consistent 1/8th inch head. Some thin spots and swaths of lacing presented during the tasting. Nose is on the clean side but quite pleasant - grassy, sweet, light fruit, citrus, coriander and a trace of medicinal phenols towards the back. Taste expresses many of the qualities present in the nose, but the sweetness is a bit more downplayed - there's more citrus and rind and less coriander, but the medicinal/herbal character seems more interspersed throughout the flavor profile compared with the nose. There's also a slight peppery quality that comes out in the middle. Mouthfeel is light and lively with an assertive, palate cleansing carbonation that falls just short of prickly. Finish is not quite semi-dry, but you definitely get something to that effect at the tail end. All and all, a very pleasant and interesting Saison - perhaps a little too on the clean side, but an excellent beer nonetheless. Well worth your time if you enjoy the style. I'd be curious to see what a little age might do to this one."
"O: My 2nd HF Saison was considerably better than the first (that being Florence), and this is a great saison, definitely on the high end of the spectrum, and further proof that HF pretty much knocks every beer style they brew out of the park."
"Every Hill Farmstead beer I've had to date has been good to excellent and this is no exception. Their beers have a distinct character to them that I'm wondering if it comes from their well water."
"Mouthfeel is medium with lots of prickly carbonation all the way through to the finish. This is a nice example of a light saison and the honey adds an interesting element."
"O: One of the better saisons I’ve had, and a pleasure to drink. Thanks again Michael."
"Medium bodied with lots of earthy, bready yeast  adding fullness to the palate.  Slightly funky but not too much so with hits of grassy hops and straw as well as a lot of crisp, light fruit.  Hints of apple, pear and banaba add to the sweetness of the honey.  Spicy presence with hints of coriander and pepper linger into a dry finish.  Complex, flavorful and refreshing.  "
"Easy easy drinking, smooth like honey without any of the sticky overwhelming sweetness, Anna is really kind of bad ass. Just maybe no more. No barnyard, no funk, just zest, honey, pepper, easy drinking goodness."
"Pours a moderate honey golden color with a large, creamy white head. Great retention and loads of spotty lacing on the way down. Thin cap throughout. The nose carries some light earth and spice. Mild white pepper in the background as well as a touch of sweet honey. Light wheat and bread notes as well. The flavor is very mildly sweet with a nice malt touch and a bit of light honey flavor. Saison yeast is there as well as slight pepper. Light to medium body and slightly chewy. Very tasty."
"Light and crisp feel. The carbonation is a little expansive in my mouth but otherwise solid. Overall a pretty rockin' saison. Another well done beer from the folks in Vermont."
"Another winner from these guys. Their saisons always hit the spot."
"O: This was my first beer from their house (and not a style I usually go for) but this was delicious stuff. Thoroughly enjoyed! Would definitely drink again if the chance came."
"Pours a chilled golden lemon color with a frothy white head. Thick clumps of lacing and never ending retention. Smells like a slightly sweet, funky barnyard. Dominated by pepper, clove, and lemongrass and backed up by a surprising punch of candy like honey. Medium bodied, soft and delicate on the palate, but doesn't finish as crisp or dry as expected for the style. Flavor is very similar to the other non-BA HF saisons and has a traditional earthy, musty and funky finish. Strong grass, biscuit malt and earthy flavors complement a surprisingly noticeable amount of honey. Another solid saison from HF, with a subtle, enjoyable twist."
"a beautiful nose when popped of brisk hopping. this is the high light in my opinion because as the beer opens up it give way to some interesting floral grassy notes that are actually very similar to dandelion. and when i think saison. i think two things. honey and dandelion greens. look is formally perfect. golden... clear if you don't let it blend with the settlings... big white head with bubbles that are a bit soapier than cotton candy. palate is unique i that it has a nice hint of acidic brightness and bitter greens. very much so like a field in flavor. the honey gives it a hint of pollen protein texture that is sort of grainy. there is some adjunct huskiness but nothing too overwhelming. the quality and feel of most the farmstead beers. all around solid but still american."
"Overall: A good Saison with a great nose."
"O- another great brew from hill farmstead. Man shaun can brew like a champ. One of the better saisons this side of the pond."
"D - I'd prefer Art over this one, but this is a rock-solid take on the style that I'd be happy to drink any time. Goes down quickly and easily, and has a nice balance of malt sweetness and spicy yeast. The honey is very subtle, but I think I prefer that."
"Anna came to me looking quite like her sister Flora. Anna is a bright saison with a shade darker than Flora looking bright yellow with a slight shade of orange. A nice whisp of bright white bubbles on top leaving squiggly lines here and there. The nose is quite bright with citrus and a dab of honey, but this is one bretty/funky lady. I mistaked it for Bullfrog Undead Ed because of the scent of brett but this is indeed Anna. Come to think of it Brett rules this one. The brett comes out in taste in full and is not messing around. It reminds me of Flora because the lemon is big as well which plays nice with the brett. Can't really pick up the honey under all of that. As expected the body was light and refreshing other than the brett aftertaste and the carb was spot on, semi tart finish but dry as a bone. I enjoyed this one but did not love it. I would marry Flora while I would make Anna my girl on the side for a piece every now and then, LOL!"
"All and all, spot on for style and taste! Well done!"
"Overall I was impressed with this beer but tasting it back to back with Flora did it a disservice. A nice and spicy saison that’s worth a shot."
"O: Anna is an exceptionally well brewed beer that is solid in every aspect of the word. A great example of the style and highly drinkable. Worth seeking out and highly recommended even for someone who isn't a big fan of the Saison style."
"Quite enjoyable. Very bright in the nose and raw, yet strangely finessed, in the mouth. I wish it popped as much in the taste as in the nose, but it's hard to argue with qua bière de miel."
"Drinkability is good. This is a very easy drinking saison and the honey addition is showcased nicely without being overdone. Definitely one of the best saisons I've had in the New England area and another solid offering from Hill Farmstead. Seems like they never miss on a single beer. I won't have any problem finishing the rest of this bottle."
"Overall this is a very well done beer. Makes me think of spring."
"D - Loved this beer, went back to the bottle a few times on it, and would love to drink it again. It is quite easy to drink and a great brew to boot."
"D - An excellent Saison that I really enjoyed. Another great brew from HF and I would def recommend this one. I look forward to having this again."
"A very solid saison, recommend."
"My first taste was prior to eating dinner (chicken piccata). My wife uses a good amount of lemon in her recipe. After eating a bit and trying the beer again, it seemed that the citrus on my palate was muted from the piccata and the beer was smoother at the end. Possibly a good pairing even though food should amplify beer not mute the flavors."
"HV"
"Appearance is a hazy golden color with a thin head. Anna`s smell has citrus, some honey, herbs. The taste has honey, belgian yeast, grapefruit, some overall funk to it too. MF is medium with low carbonation. This saison from Hill Farmstead is very nice, would order again if the opportunity presents itself. It was my first beer from Hill Farmstead, glad that I got to sample them."
"Nice, dry, slightly tart finish."
"Solid beer overall, interesting to say the least."
"Taste is really well done. It's dry and sharp and crisp - a bit sweet from the honey but it's suble. There's a nice bitter/tart taste that's really crisp. Delicious!"
"Highly enjoyable saison that you can't go wrong with. Check it out."
