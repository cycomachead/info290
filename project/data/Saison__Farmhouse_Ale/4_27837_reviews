"Juicy, barnyard beer, big funky taste with pear and grape fruit flavor."
""

"A little funky and a little sour.  Outstanding beer."

"The nose is bubblegum and a bit of funky yeast. The funkiness comes through with the taste along with apricot and Graham crackers. Another great offering from Allagash!"

"Will drink again."
"A really unique barrel aged saison. The red wine doesn't show up a whole lot, but the Brett here is the real star. Restrained and elegant and just tasty as fuck."

"Great Great great great sick"
"Overall:  It has been some time since I have had this beer, but won't forget it now.  So delicious and each dip got better and better."
""
"Overall, the Brett is off the freakin’ charts throughout this beer.  To make matters even more tart and sour, the oak barreling and bitterness of the wine grapes catapults Interlude to the next level.  The latter is remarkable in that you get all of the grapey, skinned bitterness, without any fleshy juiciness or cloying sweetness.  At the same time, however, it never comes across at all like a winey flavoring, as the oak itself tends to be more subtle.  It is obviously present enough to be able to transfer that intense grape quality, but again, they are distinct and separate entities in their intensity and showiness.  For anyone looking to satisfy their craving for a bitter, sour, puckering wild, farmhousy beer, you’re in luck on all accounts.  We are so happy to have had the opportunity to try this well-rounded, yet wonderfully unique beer."

"Overall: Like the hot girl at the bar that sucks in bed this is all about looks and smell.  It's a show with no substance or style.  At the end of the day you're better off with your old sock!"
"Overall.  The appearance and smell of this beer are really quite exceptional.  The taste and mouth were both disappointing and unpleasant.  Not what I was expecting.  It's like all the bad parts of barrel aging with brettanomyces came together with this beer.  It's unfortunate.  Probably would not buy again.  Well that's wrong.  I would like to try thus fresh and note the differences but after a year and a half I'm not really a fan."

"Just drank a 2011 bottle (02/12/15) and it was phenomenal.  Taste score on the 2011 would be a 4.5 with a similar bump in the overall score. Not sure if it's the age or the particular vintage but the 2011 was a different beer, and by far my favorite (compared to 2012-2014) vintages."

"Love Allagash! If you see it on tap, try it!"

"2014 release in a red wine glass on New Year's. All I remember were the crazy cantaloupe and honeydew melon flavors, presumably from the brett. Would love to try again."

"Picked up at Costco for ~$16.  Poured into glasses and shared with friends who love Brett.  This beer was wonderful.  It has a fruitiness that I'd not experienced in a beer before because I believe it comes from the Brett rather than hops, which I'm more accustomed to.  Pineapple, apricot, peach and some dried fruit and none of the horse blanket/straw I'd learned to expect from Brett.  Just about perfect mouth feel and carbonation.  Overall, this beer really floored me with how good it is."

"One hell of a beer."

"03/29/13 At Rattle N Hum on tap. Strangest assault on the ol' taste buds in a long time. Not sure what they were going for here as much as ""let's just throw some stuff down the chute & see what comes out"". IMHO this is an aimless taste profile. Befuddling at best. If it wasn't that I paid for it & the 9.5% ABV, I would have poured it on the floor as a wax remover. The only ""notes"" I'm registering are ""don't waste your time & money on this focus-less nonsense""."
""
""
""

"Plenty of red wine flavors with oak too.  These also permeate the aroma where hints of barnyard smells detract."

"so much character to this beauty, lucky enough to find it on tap at the farmhouse Burlington. pale in color, unassuming, and even drab, but one sniff confirms its place amongst the top dwelling wild ales of the word. a ton of jammy red wine essence, the barrel character is first and foremost here, with the brett right behind in tow. the flavor is a little different, with the yeast way out ahead of the red wine, almost strident in its assertiveness, packing both alcohol rawness and oaky maturity, its truly a weirdo in the best sense of the word. flavor features more base malt than anticipated, with some amount of wheat and the brett before other yeasts. its super dry but doesn't lose its fruity red wine character. I am impressed with the subtlety of the alcohol, and all the cherry character of the booze. enough body for all the flavors to hold up, but it still seems light to me for some reason. carbonation is relatively up beat too. complex as they come, and different from the wild ale crowd. something special here."

"Overall, a great beer, incredible flavor and complexity when you understand where its subtleties come from. And to top it off its strong and sweet but not overpowering, another great ale from Allagash."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: An excellent saison that tastes like it is mixed with a healthy helping of fruit juices. I think this beer is right up there with the best that Allagash makes. I would certainly get this on tap if again."

"Overall this beer was a great experience to which I can hardly do justice. Each sip is a little different as the flavors play off one another. Sour, sweet, earthy/funky. Some beautiful stuff here that I think speaks to the skill of managing two separate fermentations, letting each contribute to the fullest."

"O - This is first full glass of a sour beer that I've gotten through and enjoyed. It's a luxury, and not something that I see myself having a lot of, but I definitely look forward to more of these from an outstanding brewery."

"Overall: This is my first experience with red wine barrel aged ales, and my fourth or fifth experience with wild ales. The nose is amazing. But I am torn between the pleasant flavors and the unpleasant amount of alcohol on the finish. The beer is too delicate to withstand the presence of alcohol. If I can find another 2013 bottle I will age it for another year or so. If I can find another vintage I will definitely try it. Otherwise, and it pains me to say this because there are some really attractive elements to this beer, I would have no reason to buy this beer again."

"Paired this beer with grilled chicken and coleslaw. What a great beer to pair with many different dishes! The beer doesnt overpower the food and it doesnt get boozey after a bite of food either. This beer is a class act all around wether you are just drinking the beer or having a food pairing with Interlude! I would recommend chicken, pork, any seafood, or freshwater fish paired with this beer!"

"Pours hazy dark golden in cool or with a thin fizzy off white head. Smell has a tart brett aroma With notes of white wine, apples, pears, hay, and some sweet malt. Taste is brett forward with earthy notes of barnyard, straw, and must along with a very faintly tart acidity and flavor of lemongrass. Light wine barrel, malt and peppercorn presence in the finish. Lots of dry brett and Belgian yeast meld with high amounts if carbonation, faintly tart acidity, and tannins to leave an overall well balanced beer"

"O/D-I really enjoyed this beer. Allagash makes some killer brews and this one is no different. Happy to have grabbed a pint of this. A bottle is it a bit too pricey. I was however, very happy with a pint of this wild Saison."

"Pours a slightly hazy reddish copper in color with a spare light tan head that dissipates to nearly nothing after only a minute. Aroma is quite nice. The first first waff of aroma was pretty darn amazing; fruits in the fore, mostly pears, some oak and background funk. As the beer gets a chance to breathe the character changes a bit and turns more vinous and funkier. The taste is much like the aroma only it leans towards the funk and vinous aspects. When i say funk, I'm not going as far as all out horse blanket; the funkiness, while the dominant taste isn't excessive. Fruits remain in the background and there is a light breadiness that confirms the malt backbone. There isn't much hop character in either the the aroma or the taste but that may be due to the age of this particular bottle. Mouthfeel is good with a light-medium body. Alcohol presence is relatively low and not apparent in aroma, taste, or mouthfeel; its very smooth and the alcohol definitely sneaks up on you. The finish is fairly balanced, its a bit dry at first then some sweetness comes in the balance it out. Overall this is a pretty enjoyable beer. Its not the typical saison given the aging in wines barrels but has many characteristics of the style. If you have the patience to let it age for a few years you'll find a beer that mellows quite well."

"October 2012 vintage. Poured from a cork and caged bottle into a snifter, the beer is a ruby-tinged golden coloring with an uneven, sparse, quickly dispersing white head. Aromas of tart wine-like characteristics, cherry and grape sweet, woody notes, and some earthy character. Smells robust. Flavors are dark cherry sweet forward, with an effervescent body that keeps everything very light. Subtle cinnamon spice noted as you drink. Very sweet, crisp flavor profiles across the palate. The fruit characteristics diversify into grape, apple, and berry towards the end of the palate. The tart and sourness builds as you drink, with a slightly acidic building character. Fruits and esthers in the aftertaste, with a slight puckering feel in mouth. The finish is crisp, dry, and slightly astringent. Very drinkable, very robust."

"As with many Allagash beers it is pricey, but leaves you feeling it was worth the pinch in your pocket."

""
""
""

"This is a real treat, though I wish I could get some more sourness in the flavor. The alcohol is warming but not overbearing and the Belgian flavors and dryness is balanced. The beer achieves most of what it's setting out to accomplish. It's quite the tightrope walk and mostly successful."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, August 2008 vintage. Pours very hazy reddish copper color with a 1-2 finger foamy off white head with decent retention, that reduces to a nothing. Minimal lacing on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big sour apple, lemon, grape, cherry, straw, hay, clove, pepper, oak, leather, funk, and earthy yeast spiciness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity and balance of wild yeast character and barrel notes. Taste of tart apple, lemon, grape, cherry, pepper, clove, oak, wheat, hay, straw, grass, leather, funk, and earthy yeast spiciness. Light earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart light fruits, oak, pepper, clove, wheat, leather, hay, straw, grass, funk, and earthy yeast spiciness on the finish for a while. Very nice balance and complexity of malt and wild yeast flavors; with a nice malt/ester flavors balance; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a slick, crisp, and fairly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent wild saison style. Very nice balance and complexity of wild yeast esters and malt notes; and quite smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering. Would like to try a younger vintage of this in the future to compare."

"O: While tasty, I would have liked to see a bit more of the base saison shine through."
""
"*Overall--Good saison taste, the aging in barrels adds to its appeal. I would not seek this again unless someone wanted a bubbly wine tasting beer or to show this as an example of something you would never think to call ""beer""."
""
""
""
""
""
"Clear golden orange body with a slim collar of white foam. Tart, funky aromas greet the nose...grapes, hay, Brett, fruit, and light oak. Flavor follows the smell: tart, slightly sweet grape, Bretty funk, light wood, lemon, and berries. Pretty interesting and satisfying. Dry, medium bodied, tart, and somewhat crisp. Drinks a lot easier than it should..."
""
""
""
"O: I feel like this beer stopped 10 yrds before the finish line it has a lot of potential to be good but it really isn't there yet which just leaves me confused and kinda disappointed"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a real neat take and strangely not wine like, but with great wine character. Enjoyable."
""
""

"Re-Review: I tried this again on tap and it was a totally different experience. The Brett flavors were amazing with a perfect balance of fruit, yeast, and sour. Revising score significantly."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"A really interesting brew that blurs the lines between saison, gueuze, and red wine. Would love to try it out of the bottle next time to see if the carbonation issues are resolved."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"A decent beer. But I can't help but feel there's significant room for improvement. Ultimately the $23 price tag renders this beer not worth the money (at least not for repeat purchases)."

"T: A musty funk right away with heavy white grape and triple notes. A definite touch o white wine in the middle with a finish that's heavy on the crackery malt and shows some brett as well. A kind of lingering tartness throughout that never turns sour. Overall a really tasty beer."
"I am glad I drank this now as I dont anticipate it would have improved any more."
"O: Tough beer to score. Initial hit is very sour like a wild ale or a really bad saison. But it slowly gets better through the taste - decent in the middle with a really pleasant graham cracker crust aftertaste. I tried not to knock it down too hard, it's well balanced, complex and it has some aspects that I enjoy. But it has some really off flavors too with the extreme funkiness and sour notes. I ended up drain pouring it but tried to give it a fair shake on the scores."
" O: This is everything I was hoping it to be and more. They nailed the style and the barrel/aging/brett component perfectly. Been waiting to try this for years and it completely surpassed my expectations."
""
""
""
""
"I had some issues with this beer, but in the end, once it approached room temperature it was a very nice beer although I still feel the wine character was lacking. I'd definitely drink this again after letting it warm, but probably won't go out of my way to get a bottle."
"O: this is a delicious brew, excellent work with the yeast strains and barrels. Excellent balance and great flavor... Give this a try if you get te opportunity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I know I should go on about how wonderful it is but I'm running on empty right now."
"M: Medium bodied with nice carbonation."
""
""
""
"Pours a bright amber color with essentially zero head. Very good clarity and color. Smell is pretty funky with plenty of yeast. Some doughs and fruit are also noticed. Taste is fairly dry with a nice tartness. Some fruit comes through as well. Mouthfeel is pretty dry but light. Overall this is really nice. Pretty dry but still some sourness."
""
"Overall. A well made beer, but not what I look for in a wild. To dry and not enough sour for the nice fruity flavours present ...for this guy anyways."
""
""
""
"2007 bottle opened in 2012: The bottle opened with a loud ""pop"" and a little foam overflow. It poured a cloudy, murky lighter caramel color. It had a small off-white head that dissipated quickly. It did leave some lacing. Getting a whiff of sourness to the nose. Aromas include wheat, lemon, breadiness, spices and some oakiness. The taste is excellent. Touch of sour funkiness to it. Wheat, lemon, spice and oakiness also. Excellent!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - I think I paid $21.99 for a 750ml bottle, so it's not something I can afford to drink every day. But... if you are looking for a VERY fine example of a barrel aged, farmhouse Brett beer - I would suggest this over just about any other beer out there."
"This was the 2011 version. This isn't a beer for everyone due to the amount of funk, but it was perfectly fine by me. Great depth on both the aromas and feel. There is a real good dry finish to this as well."
""
""
""
"O: This one certainly shouldn't be classified as an American Wild Ale. I enjoy the flavors and the mouthfeel suits them well, but my expectations were skewed. That said, it hides its alcohol very well. Pretty enjoyable, but I wouldn't have it again, especially given the price."
"Low B-"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tart upfront and in the middle. Tart grapes and young red wine f;avrs. Then some woody, toasted water cracker flavors pop up to help round out the funk and Earth. Not too tart, and just a little warm. This was a nice sipper with great carbonation."
""
"A world class effort from the folks at Allagash... How I wish I could get their brews here at home... I don't think I've ever had a bad beer from this brewery and this one lives up to its reputation... I enjoyed every sip of this..."
""
""
"This is a special beer with complex aroma and flavors, but easy to drink."
"the beer pours a slightly dark amber and smells of apple cider vinegar. the 11 smells like Jesus with potent wine notes, some funk, and strong sourness. The 11 packs a super B.O. pungency as well. Both taste excellent with strong notes of apple cider vinegar sourness and malt sweetness. The alcohol is more pronounced in the 11 than the 09, but both are quite drinkable. This is definitely one of the most drinkable sours. I would recommend a warmer cellar temperature for drinking, but it's still a very flavorful ale."
"Personally I like the 09 better but I'm sure if we sat on the '11 for 2 years it would be just as nice."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - In my mind, this is a great example of a wild ale. It smells great and tastes well-balanced between sweet, sour, and funky flavors. I was expecting this to be a bit more sour than it actually was, but this lack of sourness (and the resulting balance) seemed to make the beer more drinkable and less heartburn-inducing. Maybe a little pricey to get more than a couple of times, but absolutely a very good beer."
"Feel matches the taste profile very well- light to medium body with only a soft carbonation. Rolls over the tongue; this is an exceptional beer. Given what other exceptional wild ales cost (Consecration is $13 for a 12 oz), paying 20 bucks for this is reasonable. I'm using it celebrate and I encourage you to do the same : D"
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy golden color with an off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. A foamy curtain of lace forms on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain, grape jelly/jam, and some grape juice aromas. Taste is the same with a nice fruity flavor that lingers on the finish. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer and I am really enjoying the grape aromas and flavors I am getting from this one."
""
""
""
""
"O: Was this as good as I remembered it? No, not really.... but it was still quite good. This was almost like a brown ale that went slightly sour (in a good way). I guess that is not totally fair here since I guess the whole point of the wine barrel-aging is so that the harsh acidity would mellow out, making this sour, but not primed for the sourhead."
"o- i was expecting something much more sour than this, and i was slightly disappointed.but the beer is still delcious and i think i might go get another bottle to age."
""
""
""
"O: An awesome beer, I ate steak tips with this and it was absolutely incredible, grab a bottle of this if you can."
"Overall this lacks the complexity I was hoping for, but I imagine it would be a good beer to pair with some nice cheese."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Although the alcohol is well hidden from this beer, the amount of dryness lends it to being more of a sipper."
"O: Enjoyable but not the best of the ""brett"" offerings from Allagash, probably would not pick it up again."
""
"O- I really liked this better with some age on it but had never had it this fresh before. I think at least a year and this would be the beer I remembered."
""
"Overall a very unique tasting strong ale, one like I have never tasted in the past, but definitely plan to do so again in the future."
""
""
"Overall - Not Supplication and not really close, even though this is very good. The gulf in class is vast, even if the numbers in this review say otherwise."
""
""
"I got me a sweet connect to a cheap supply of this stuff and boy am I glad. It is delicious. If the top teir sours out there are better than this, I have great things to look forward to. It was just sweet and had a great brett flavor that was not to sour. No vinegar at all, which I imagine I would not like or want. I could sip on this all day in the winter or summer, day or night, in jail or on bail. No matter, you could do a heck of alot worse. Enjoy this no matter the cost. Try it just once, it is worth it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"In the body you also pick up the wine presence. This makes for a very good sipping opportunity. This beer has lots of great layers. The feel is also really good. I enjoyed savoring this beer."
""
"O: Quite nice. I love wilds and wine drinkers would really like this as well. Its price point is similar to a lower-end to okay bottle of wine, but this is far more complex. I'd choose this over a wine any day."
"O: a very good ale, close to a wild but not quite. Would characterize as a good and approachable entry to sours. Highly recommend."
""
""
""
""
"Hazy orange hue with a small head that recedes quickly. Honey, oak, brettanomyces, light funk, subtle fruit. Good flavor, though not as lovely as I remember upon sampling the draft version. Sweeter than expected, with a pronounced honey presence throughout. Nice brett quality. A solid beer. As is customary with me, I would prefer more sour & funk character in lieu of sweetness."
"Pours an orangish color with a nice one finger off white head. Fairly murky in appearance as well- like river water. The nose is Brett, with some caramel, malt. Fairly sweet, but not overly so. The taste is really good, just a tad sweet for my tastes. Honey, caramel, cherry, oak and Brett are the main tastes I get in here. I don't get any of the 9.5% ABV at all. Maybe some straw in the aftertaste. Feel is medium, syrupy, sweet, and bitter on the back end. Overall, a very nice beer.. But I'd like a little less sweetness in it, and more sourness. I'm sure it would age very well. Maybe I'll try that some day. Cheers."

"Enjoyed this beer quite a bit. Very clean and drinkable."
"It pours a medium bodied and cloudy dirty auburn in color with a slight white lacing around my snifter. The nose is very dry, funky, bretty, with an interesting fruity tartness which is almost melonesque. Perhaps it's aged hops? Regardless, it has more fruit in the nose than I anticipated. The flavors are extremely dry and funky. It is barnyard galore and a brett bomb. You get some slight fruit like sweetness but this is all dry brett. It drinks fine but like I've said, is almost too dry. Overall it's a nice sour and has enough going on to keep you interested throughout. I wouldn't say it's worth the $20 pricetag though..."

"Poured a clearish amber brown body with minimal head that leaves lace on top of an oaky, woody, malty aroma but also has some floral hops, sour fruit and funk. Body is more of the same as I get a smooth, somewhat creamy medium bodied beer that has this puckering sour sweetness; I get this rush of sweet caramel malts that have some thickness (yeast/bread) along with light fruits (grape and tropical like pear) and this rush of a sour, almost tart finish. Very well balanced and I was shocked at the almost 10% ABV. I don't want to say ""wine-like"" but it reminded me of a heavier white wine w/ the sweetness being prevelant and the plush fruit taste afterwards."

"Taste is really tart and funky with a nice rich red wine flavor, dry and its almost like there's some tannin in it. Very unique and tasty."

"Overall I really did not enjoy this sour ale from Allagash. In fact I think this is probably the least enjoyable sour ale I have ever had. I found it to be overly tart, sharply so, and a bit heavy on the oak. For me, this left the overall taste to be rather disjointed, with nothing really coming together for me. There were no wine barrel flavors and the acidic, tangy flavors were just too disjointed and left me wanting so so much more."

"Taste is super funky with big spikes of flavor left and right. Hops, yeast, Brett, earthy funk, oak barrels, and a Belgian Tripel spice profile. Tastes like a Tripel hooked up with a sour one drunken evening. Crazy and fun and enjoyable, but hardly sessionable. An interesting drink for sure."
"A flavorful, fruity, very mildly sour ale from Allagash. I was actually somewhat disappointed with this one, though I didn't know at all what to expect."
"Pours a reddish brown apple cider color with a one finger head that disapates almost instantly, leaving a ring of foam around my glass producing great lacing. Aroma of oak, red wine, funk and slight vinegar. Taste is tart and fruity with a finish of oak and redwine. This is a fantastic sour, just behind Russian river's Consecration in my opinion."
"Although I enjoyed this beer and I can appreciate the efforts made by Allagash to concoct a creative version of an American wild ale, the end product did not come together quite as well as I had hoped. Perhaps putting some age on a bottle of Interlude would result in a beer with a more rounded, and better integrated, flavor profile."
"This is a high quality wild ale. Broad, complex flavors and aromas. Highly enjoyable."
"I like that - too sour is just not enjoyable sometimes. (2011 note: I now disagree with this perspective, but that was my viewpoint back in the day). Smooth palate."
"O: this is a really good beer. wish we had more."
"Overall, I was impressed with this brew, and thought the oak aging was well worth the time and effort."
"O: Highlight of this Allagash tasting. Truly stands out. 4.5"
"8.1/10"
"Wow, sourness does a total 180 and is very light on the taste. Brett still holds firm, as well as sweet grains and alcohol. Barrel conditioning is quite evident and shows off some pretty impressive oakiness. At first I was a bit disappointed at the downturn in sourness, but the depth of oak and complexity are really quite enjoyable. Actually reminds me of Curieux, minus the bourbon and funk of course. I dont think it quite lived up to my expectations, but was enjoyable nonetheless."
"O: A reasonably complex brew. The different characteristics of this beer really blend for an introspective drinking experience. Love the dryness and crisp flavors. The mouth really accentuates the flavor transitions. The silent champion of this beer is the oak, strong flavors are subdued in favor of nuanced ones. Sour oaking is quite nice."
"O- Not a bad beer at all. I am not sure the age has helped it though."
"Pours an interesting reddish orange hue, somewhere between a blood orange and grapefruit, minimal spots of head. Scent was quite fruity, white and red wine, with notes of tropical (mango) and citrus (tangerine), notes of musty hay, damp wood and dry oak - quite unique. Flavor was quite exquisite, the notes of wine grapes work wonderfuly with the notes mango and tangerine, the woodieness of the beer contains both musty notes from the yeast and dry, toasted notes from the wine barrels. Light notes of vanilla and grahmn cracker provide sweetness. Medium bodied, carbonation is under control, quite dry on the palate. Quite the standout beer."
"O- Good beer, wish it had more wild characteristics towards the way of a lambic, then this would be killer."
"Definitely worth trying out. It's a shame its so expensive or I'd be drinking this all summer. Definitely a good beer to let wine drinkers know what's reallly good"
"Super clean and dry mouthfeel, really well attenuated beer almost no after taste. Really pleased I let this sit for very well near 2 years. It has aged very well, now I wish I had more. I must say Allagash beers always seem to age well."
"o: I loved this as is, but I would love to try it with the funk dialed down sometime."
"Overall: Huge thanks to whichever generous trader hooked me up with this bottle (sorry, it was last summer)! I saved this for a special occasion (turns out that I got an A in medieval Latin and finished grading 120 student exams). I'm glad I saved it for a special occasion, as it's a really interesting/special beer. The verdict? Tasty beer, and one of the sexiest-looking libations I've ever had grace my glass. That said, at $20.00, it's not quite perfect enough to justify picking it up at the asking price (unlike Allagash's Curieux, which I'd probably pay double for)."
"This is a decent beer. I think I like it fresher better, but still enjoyable."
"Overall a tasty beer. Not in my top 10 sours but still tasty."
"( 41/50, 9.5% alc/vol, Degustation Alpha BDT) Body is dark red, blood red with a generous but dissipating head of cream color. Aromas are of an old oak barrel, dusty and dry. Notes of balsamic vinegar rise to the nose along with ice cider whisps. Deliciously belgian, Flemish aromas. Wonderful achievement for an american beer. Brettanomyces - belgian wild yeasts - abund in this complex nose. Raspberries and gueuze-like acidity pucker the tongue and play with a deliciously fruity, vinegary alcoholic profile. Reminds me of a duchesse de bourgogne, only cooler, and more fruity. The body is rather light, with a citric demeanour that gives lightness to a body that otherwise is controlled by its vinegar tartness. Dry and puckering. Dry, puckering, sweet and tart raspberry-flavoured sour beer. Wonderful."
"D - Drinkability is moderately high. Alcohol is invisible, and flavors aren't abrasive at all. I would've liked to see a bit more depth out of this, most noticeably out of the wine barrels, but Brett has a way of imparting its own distinct flavors. Worth a try for sure!"
"Drinks well. A nice wild ale that obviously took some fine craftsmanship to brew."
"O- This was a 2007 vinetage, which I thought was pretty cool, but these wilds I think are just my thing. I think this one is just too sour, but some BA's will clearly love this one. If I had access to another I'd split for sure no way I could handle this dude myself."
"Maybe this beer is past its prime because the brett has really taken hold here. Its by far and away the dominate flavor and aroma. I can't get any notes from the wine because of it."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish to yellow color with a small off white head. In the aroma, white grape sourness and hints of cabernet. In the taste, sour white grapes, Sweet Tarts, and a small dryness of a cabernet. A sour bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry sour whine like aftertaste. Big sourness and I think I might like wine now."
"Very nice wild ale. I really want to grab another to cellar for a bit longer and open at a tasting."
"Ultra-drinkable. Great bottle, can't wait till another one bounces its way in front of me."
"O: Overall, a good wild ale. Nothing superb, but it avoids being nothing but sour funk like many wild ales seem to be."
"O - Overall the flavors show restraint and balance, and have some nice beveled edges instead of dominating your palate."
"O- Fantastic stuff. My favorite Allagash beer."
"CHEERS!"
"Drinkability was ok. About half a bottle was just abouth right for me. Overall not a bad beer. Just not worth the money."
"- Overall not too bad.. but seems a mediocre beer was soured. Proof a good sour is usually made with a stellar beer as well. Not too much as far as any wine notes go in this.. though it is a nice funky framboise of sorts.. but not up to the likes of Cascade and Russian River."
"D - Nicely drinkable, despite the subdued flavors. This would be a great beer to pair with food, or to lure a wine-drinker to the dark side."
"Overall- A nice wild ale, with some depth and complexity to the flavor. Expensive yes, but worth trying atleast once."
"Edit: I was able to enjoy a 2006 version that I had aged for about 5 years. The hop notes that I felt before have all but disappeared and the tartness has also diminished as well. The beer is still quite delicious. It seems t have developed very nicely. There seems to be a nice slightly sweeter more mature fruit character. Quite delicious. The vinous notes have shifted to a more apple juice/cider type flavor with not as much tartness. Very good brew for aging."
"Overall impression: Not the most complex wild ale you'll find, but well worth a shot."
"This is good... maybe not as complex as some other varieties of the style, but tasty."
"Overall, a nice, drinkable beer. Goes nice with food. Would definitely have another one of these."
"Vintage December 2009. Once the cork popped, I got a nice whiff of funk and Brett. It pours a hazy golden-orange color with some beautiful carbonation. The head is medium size and white as snow. Scent is wonderful with some very strong resemblance to wine. There are some heavy grape aromas, as well as oak and sour funk. I also get apples and cherries as well. First sip is yeasty and funky...you can definitely taste the Brett in this one (which isn't a bad thing). Not as sour as the nose tends to imply, but rather pleasantly tart. There are some flavors of oak, grape, Belgian yeast, and apple...leaves a champagne-like aftertaste. There is also a nice alcohol warmth. Mouthfeel is well carbonated and full bodied. Drinkability is scarily high for a 9.5 beer. Would love to see how some more age would treat this beer."
"Finally getting another shot at Interlude, and it's on-tap. (Interestingly, the news that they've got some Darkness kegs downstairs intrigues me further...) It pours a slightly hazy golden orange topped by a quarter-finger of white foam. The nose comprises apple cider, light Brett, mandarin oranges, lemon zest, and cinnamon. The taste holds notes of lime, orange zest, light nutmeg, pepper, mild Brett, and a few sparse cobwebs. The body is a light-ish medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly oily feel. Overall, a nice bit o' wildness, but a tad mild on the flavor (I was looking for just a pinch more pop, so to speak). Good times, nonetheless."
"D - Very enjoyable, high alchocol content cuts down on the drinkability though."
"This beer pours an translucent orange color. There isn't much head to be seen on the surface of this particular pour, perhaps it's just the way it was served. The smell is of a woodsy funk more of the sour from the oak in the funk but it was definitely a brett smell. The flavor is strongly of citrus and not nearly as much sour as I had expected from a wild ale. Though I must admit the main flavor tasted almost exclusively of oranges, tangerines wedges to be more specific. However I found the beer to be a little too flat for my liking, again I don't know if that is the tap or if that's just the way the beer is supposed to be, I've never had a problem with their levels of co2 before though. The drinkability was more unpleasant as you continued, not a bad beer not a great beer."
"Not something I'd drink every night, though probably more a factor of cost than desire..."
"Mouth is fairly prickly and tingly...actually a nice compliment to the sourness. This is definitely a slow sipper to be enjoyed. The sour is fantastic and I love this take on the wild ale. Definitely will seek out again."
"Nice stuff."
"D: Another solidly made, drinkable beer from Allagash."
"This beer just got better and better as I made my way through the bottle. Great balance, good flavors, and very nice with spaghetti and some chicken with Italian spices."
"D- i liked this beer, but there are certainly better examples of the style. i feel its a little pricey at $22 a bottle. maybe the other bottle i picked up will be better in another year or so. i dont think ill be reaching for this one again anytime soon, nor will i be tempted to pick up another."
"a beligan triple quality with a brett twist and a flavor range that seems to be in the midst of all that. pour is cloudy orange with a small head of about a finger. nose of tart and mild fruity geuze quality. palate of brett and strawberries and cherries. crisp enough to not detect the alcohol. thought it was about 6 actually. not too bright to contort the pollen malty finish. a difference to a Belgian geuze with a distiction of zesty floral and distinct fruit qualities."
"Drinkability - I can taste the alcohol, and can feel it warming my throat. I try not to compare it to other beers, but knowing Consecration is a 10% beer aged in wine barrels I can't help bud do so. I'd take a RR over this any day."
"Exceptionally well crafted beer. There are a couple of things I would change but hard to complain with what the people of Allagash accomplished."
"The beer has a light body with a full carbonation that makes a light feel on the tongue."
"D: it drank really good and was a solid wild ale that I would definitely like to try again. It kind of reminded me of supplications little sister but the cherry flavor was more mild."
"HV"
"I've always been a fan of Allagash, but their beers are unavailable out here, so my opportunities to sample are limited. Having recently picked this one up in a trade, I was excited to renew my acquaintances with this brewery. Pours a medium golden color with a little white head that hangs around for quite a while. Aromas of brett, white grapes, light oak, pears and green apples. Light bodied, crisp, tart, white wine, apples and well-hidden alcohol. Another great beer from Allagash."
"Overall this was a solid beer however the different flavors didn't seem to meld terribly well. Still, it's worth a shot."
"Taste is bret sour, a bit, but the main flavor I have is merlot... a dark red wine. It also has that dry red wine finish. The more I drink it the more the sour fades and the merlot comes through. I really wish this was more sour. the nose lets you think it is crazy sour, but the taste is disappointing if that was what you were looking for. The more I dig into this, the more I dislike it. If you are a Merlot fan, this is for you. if you dont like red wine, like me, dont buy this."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium high carbonation. Drinkability is good, it had some great flavors and was a very good beer overall. It had some very nice sour and tart flavors without becoming too extreme. Paired great with dinner tonight too."
"2009 Vintage. Served from bottle into an Allagash flute. Poured yellow-orange with a minimal white head. There was no apparent lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of malt, apple cider, and wheat. The flavor was sweet (almost sugary), apple cider, and dark fruit. It was light on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a nice wild ale. The feel on the palate with the high carbonation was quite nice and refreshing for me throughout this one. The flavors were spot-on and not overpowering as you can get a massive sour aftertaste with some of these style brews. This is a definite must try."
"D - Good beer with good balance and nice drinkability but it's definitely one better to share with a few other ""wild"" friends."
"D - Very enjoyable wild...love the funky, bretti character here. Combined with the oak and the complex fruitiness, this one is a winner. 9.5% - really? Not really sensing this - probably means disaster is waiting ahead of me, but oh well...this is so good I'm easily finishing the bottle on my own."
"Drinkability-The tartness definitely ensures this beer is far from cloying and the fruity flavors can get rather addictive with successive sips. For what it's worth, and costs, this beer is dangerous on the drinkability."
"I was starting to think allagash beers wern't worth the premium price point but this certainly changed my view."
"D: very easy drinking, this would be a great starter wild for someone whos just getting into the style, hard to beleive this is 9.5 abv, I found no trace at all"
"(D)- I like this wild ale. Its got a harmonius balance and feel with a solid drinkable body. Would be curious what a few years of age would do to it."
"It's lightly carbonated, a little peppery mouthfeel, matches the style nicely. The 9.5% ABV isn't noticeable, very drinkable and delicious."
"D - It is hard to rate in a traditional sense as this drinks like a really dry and complex red wine, but I am really enjoying it. I wish every day was ""open a cool bottle in the back of the fridge because it is Tuesday"" day."
"This is a fantastic take on the wild ale by Allagash, I just wish it wasn't $20 for a bottle."
"Notes: This is an amazing beer! People should be talking about it more and drinking more of it!"
"One of the best wild ales I've tasted. Way to go."
"Holy cow, this is killer beer! With an aggressive pour, I get a small to medium sized, cream colored head that soon settled out and no lace. Color is a hazy apricot. Aroma is fantastic, literally, with yeast, Brett, malt, wine fruitiness, caramel. Flavor is like aroma and has the acid from the yeastoids and gas to cut through the sweet malts and residual sweetness of the wine barrels along with the bitterness of the hops and yeast. Complex. Body is very good and too the carbonation. Finish is like flavor and includes alcohol warming. Would be good both before and after a great meal."
"d - A very nice Allagash beer with some nice sour cherries in the smell and taste. Would like to have again."
"D-extremely drinkable and tasty. great balance of sweetness and sour. light acidity to balance with a great oak aginging imparting oak, vanilla, and vinous characteristics."
"The red fruit qualities are much more prevalent in this beer than the 09"
"D - Probably not worth the price."
"Overall, a nice, complex and enjoyable wild ale. The wine barrel aging seems to give this a nice sweetness and complexity that matches well with the Brett. An enjoyable sipping wild ale."
"At the Allagash promo recently at the Coppermine Pub in North Arlington, NJ. Into a tulip, poured a golden hue, with one finger of white head, with decent retention. The nose was very impressive; lots of brett yeast, with some sour raspberry and numerous spices, including clove and cinnamon. The flavor was even more impressive; very winey/berry start combined with brett funk, dissolving to a more sour mid-palate, and then finally crisp sugary finish. No hint of the alcohol content. Very interesting flavor progression to say the least. Medium-bodied, spritzy mouthfeel. Excellent refreshing substitute for a lambic or summer ale."
"Amber gold with an off white head that thins quickly and leaves a bit of lace. The smell is very vinous and fruity at first. There is a bit of wood in the background. The funkiness of the brett is also noticeable in the smell. I'm not a huge sour ale fan but I do have to say that I'm pleasantly surprised by the taste of this beer. Up front this tastes very much like a wine. Although it has enough beer characteristics to make it clear that it isnt' wine. There is a bit of malt and hop in the background along with the acidic character of the brettanomyces make it clear it is beer. Very complex though altogether. The mouthfeel is sharp and very dry the acidity of the brett and moderate carbonation combine to make this very tart. So this is very good I'm definitely a fan and will have to seek out more examples of this style."
"The mouthfeel dries up quickly leaving you wanting more. The drinkability seems good after the first glass, but bret usually wears on me pretty quickly. Overall this is the most enjoyable wild ale I've had."
"It's a very drinkable beer. I can't see this one getting old at all. The alcohol is well hidden. The sourness is there but never oppressive. I highly recommend this beer."
"This beer is a bit rich and indecisive for me. The funk, sour and wine just don't come together enough. But I respect the intent and think it others might have a very different opinion."
"Notes: Exotic and interesting."
"This is a beer where I enjoy the aroma much more than the flavor. Interesting, but the astringency is really powerful."
"D: The drinkability is high, mainly because the aroma and flavor are so incredible, but also because your palate won't experience the same type of fatigue that comes with other heavy hitting wild ales. One of my favorite brews from Allagash, a brewery that I have come to expect great things from."
"ABV is a bit high to put away more than one, but I will definitely snatch Interlude up as often as I see it."
"D- I'd tear this bad boy up and drink every bit of the mass production of it."
"Overall, Allagash Interlude is a nice beer, but doesn't really deliver. I enjoyed it a little more than the Confluence, but it still didn't really impress me. I think Allagash has a nice base beer going on here, but it needs something a little more. Still enjoyable to drink and worth checking out if you haven't tried it."
"A fantastic example of the diversity of American brewing, and a primo crossover beer for wine drinkers. It is complex and bold enough to challenge most wines on its own or when pairing. Stand it up against a stinky cheese, smoked salmon or charcuterie plate."
"This beer is well balanced all around and was enjoyable all the way through. It plays nicely on the tongue, and was certainly drinkable. Will be looking for this again and may have to pick up a bottle. Another strong beer from Allagash."
"The sour and funky character is somewhat understated, as this is a saison first and a wild second. The finish is dry and satisfying. Easily my favorite regular offering from Allagash, this trumps the 2009 that I had on tap recently. I would like to grab a couple of these to age to see how they develop."
"4.5/4/4/4/4.5"
"Drinkability is very good. Overall it's a perfect balance between sweet and sour. The flavors hit the tongue in layers, it's very deep, complex, and leaves you wanting more. I bought a bottle to add to my beer collection, I may try to get a few more bottles of this stuff. Overall, a really cool beer."
"The palate opens with plenty of Brett with a blend of clove and Bandaid and plenty of citrus with an orange juice-like character. Some more fruit - I get a flavor that reminds me of peach juice - and some spice coming through mid-palate and along with the clove, there's a nutmeg/mace like character. The red wine is also noticeable, lingering on into the finish that is drying with a little citrus, spice and bandaid as well. Excellent stuff, this is the best Allagash beer out there."
"Of all the times I've had this beer, I think this time was the best. Does talking to Mr. Rob Tod while imbibing make it better?"
"Interlude by Allagash is a wild ale aged in French Merlot and Sirah oak barrels. 9.5% abv. It poured a deep sienna orange brown without any head. It smelled of cherry, dark fruits, malt, toffee and some red wine. It tasted like lemons, malt, caramel, touch of vanilla, oak and a sour ending with a dry finish. It is very wine like but it seems a bit off. There's some astringency going on with some phenol and solvent characters- not a good sign."
"Amazing. The flavors meld seamlessly, and the 9.5% is nowhere to be found. Allagash, your my hero today."
"Allagash, once again, lives up to, and exceeds, my expectations of a great brewery! Very well done."
"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a Belgian goblet. The beer has a hazy golden, almost red, tint to it. Foams up pretty nice upon pouring, but doesn't leave too much lacing behind. Aroma is pleasant, but slightly disappointing. There's a good deal of funk, but not a whole lot of the tangy and sour notes that I would expect out of a barrel age, Brett fermented wild ale. Taste is nice as well, but falls a bit short of my expectations. There's a smoothness to the beer that is pleasant, but it lacks the lively acidity that I was hoping for. It's a very balanced beer, but gets to be a little boring after a while. Overall, this is far from a bad beer, but didn't strike me as wonderful. Perhaps I went into it with the wrong mindset, but I probably won't be dropping the 22 bones to try this one again."
"The finish is dry and had a slightly unappetizing bitterness. Sad end, but on a whole, definitely worth the money!"
"D: Very drinkable, I'll easily drink the whole 750ml bottle."
"D - Absolutely outstanding. One of the best beers I've ever had. Drinks very similar to a saison. I'd drink this with a fresh-ripened goat cheese, a hearty rustic charcuterie plate, or with a big, heaping plate of sweet potato fries. An absolute must-have. Go find a bottle right now."
"Pours a dark golden copper with a fairly slight head that leaves a good ring around the top of the beer. The aroma is quite nice, with a lot of citrus, green apple, ripe fruits, Brett, and a bit of acid. Taste is quite similar. A lot going on here, and in addition to the nose I picked up a bit from the barrels. Mouthfeel is very nice. Some puckering qualities, but nothing too harsh. A bit sweet in addition to the sour. This would be more of an everyday drinking sour. Very drinkable all around."
"Consumed: 3/12/2010"
"I think the beer is better with bottle conditioning than on tap. It's one of those rare things."
"Cheers!"
"Overall Impression: A very complex beer that had too much of a wine-like flavor for my palate. It is no doubt an excellent beer, but the flavor combination did not work for me. At $19.99 + tax, I would advise against trying it unless you're big on wine."
"This is my first wild ale, and I am quite frightened. Pours a strange hazy light brown/pink, small bubbly off-white head. Sticks around decently and leaves a little lacing. Smell is faint sour berry, a little funky. The taste is great, not nearly as harsh as I thought it would be. Lemon, berries. A little sour but not overly so at all. Kind of a pink Starburst and raspberry lemonade vibe. Definitely a white wine vibe here as well. Alcohol is well-hidden. I want to give the taste a 4.5, but it gets a bit tiring over time, there's not much to it after the first couple ounces it seems. One glass was enough for me, for a bomber I would probably have to split it with someone. Long finish. A nice change for sure from IPAs/stouts. I enjoyed it, I am looking forward to trying more wild ales, I can see why people like the style so much and the complexities that can be derived from it."
"A very excellent Belgian Strong from the folks at Allagash. Well worth a taste, especially if you enjoy sour ales, or just Belgian ales in general. Deliciousness in a glass, YUM."
"It's a good brew, but not great. For $18, I expect greatness. Considering the pricetag, I see little reason to revisit this brew."
"Nicely done from Allagash. Poured a medium to smallish head, while releasing an interesting and pleasing aroma. Notes a bit of citrus, as well as perhaps some apple - or otherwise fruity taste. Complex and a bit difficult to pinpoint, but nonetheless delightful. Perhaps the oak barrels give it that difficult to corner taste. A smooth mouthfeel, albeit for a touch of crisp. Also very dry, even before the aftertaste. On the lighter side for such a complex beer."
"Definitely interesting, and it does grow on you. Doesn't quite justify the price tag, though."
"D - Glad that I tried this unique offering. I'd sum it up as complex with several layers of flavor. However, I probably wouldn't specifically seek this one out to try again."
"Overall, I enjoyed this one, and all around it's a good beer. However, this beer isn't as good as the sum of it's parts. For some reason I don't think this is memorable in any way. It's pretty much exactly what I expected, and while good and enjoyable, I don't think I would have this again."
"Pours a murky orangish-brown with a white head. The aroma is light sour with oak, sour apple and vanilla. The flavor is tart apple with oak, lemon and vanilla. The beer finishes very dry, making you want to drink more and more of it. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice sour that has a lot of flavors besides just sourness."
"The alcohol is almost imperceptible. So be carful"
"Willing to pay the high price to enjoy more."
"Pours a dark amber orange color with a medium white head, and light lace. I have to say that I reall y loved the color of this beer, but that's where the love affair ended for me. Light berry notes on the nose, grassy, heavy mustiness and little to no sourness. Flavor is unripened berry, really no sweetness or tartness in this one, just sort of a muddled funk of a brew, musty, earthy, some funky cheese at times. Where is the sour on this one?? This brew really needs some bugs in here to make things shine. This is too Brett-forward, and the funkiness needs to be offset by some sweetness or sourness or both. Dry finish translates into a dry beer overall, but without the tartness to balance things out. Not really what I was expecting out of this brew. Too much Brett funk and not enough sour and I'm not really a fan of these type of wilds. Reminds me of the mediocrity that was Perseguidor 5."
"D: Very good. Even at 9.5% I've been wanting to try this beer for a while, but the price was holding me back at 17.99. Glad I finally splurged. Very good, and I would buy again, but only for a special occasion."
"Bottled in December of 2009. Poured slowly from a corked and caged 750ml bottle into a red wine glass. Pours a brownish-orange color. Like a cider in appearance. No head of any substance and very little to no lacing on the glass, but it seems very carbonated. Smells of funk and brett. Oaky and with wine like qualities. The barrel aging did some nice things for the overall complexity of this brew. Pear and overall fruit flavors are apparent along with the funkiness and bready notes. I found it to be mild and restrained for a wild. Very little sourness to it. This is a good beer, very drinkable with delicious wine-like qualities. I was however slightly disappointed this time. I have had only bottles and had this on tap and felt that this particular one was slightly lackluster and over carbonated. I think some age will do this beer well. Luckily I have two older bottles tucked away in my basement. I can't wait to review this beer again in a few months."
"Drinkability: The abv holds it back and the strong caramel with the lemony brett isn't the best pairing so I'd say this beer was much better fressh and the current flavor profile also contributes to my lower score in this category."
"drinks pretty well. i guess its got close to twice the alcohol of most of the sour beers ive had. not one of the outstanding examples, but by all means an enjoyable one."
"D: A nice offering from Allagash. I found it to be slightly more enjoyable than Confluence and some of their other beers. I'd definitely recommend this one and would have no problem with having it again."
"The feel is on the low end of the funky side with a mild spritz, the carb is at a nice level. A easy drinking Belgian strong that is kind of hard to identify. Crisp and refreshing. I only wish I had another bottle of this, I need more of this year."
"Another intriguing and contemplative wild for me. An interesting style, but once every now and again is good enough for me."
"Is a beer worth 20 bucks? This one definitely is. Wonderful scents of grapes and sweetness. Excellent drinkablilty, however catches up with you rather quickly due to how WELL it does go down. Oak comes through nicely, but not overwhelming. Interesting mix of sweet and dry with the finish. Id love to be able to try an older bottle to compare, but from what ive seen here, it can only get better."
"M/D - Light body with crisp carbonation. Lingers on the lips. You can feel the alcohol warmth. This is my first wild ale, so it is difficult to compare. I usually associate sourness with something gone wrong, but this is a pleasant tartness. Very refreshing. Can't drink too many of them due to the alcohol. The half-pint was a nice serving size. Definitely recommend this beer, particularly to other wild ale newbies, and I would have it again."
"M/D - slightly old, or more mellow, flavors seem to be slightly dull, but very enjoyable and i would seek this one out again"
"I've always been a fan of Allagash, but you can count me as a huge fan after experiencing Interlude. I stand by my statement...this is indeed a special beer. It's expertly crafted all-around and doesn't really have any glaring flaws. Personally, I'd like a little more Belgian yeast flavor. But, that's really nitpicking. This is great stuff. Definitely worth seeking out. Trade for it if you must. It's well worth it."
"Some good funk going here. Flavors are all over the place: sour, sweet, and dry. I didn't get to try this back in 05 when the beer was released, but this is an excellent beer. Not overly sour, so there is accessibility for beginners to the wild ale scene. I'd be interested in trying other years. Highest recommendation,"
"D - This is a very nice beer that is easily drinkable despite its sour character and high ABV. It is nicely balanced between the complex, sour funk and the rich malt. The malt notes are quite rich and creamy for a sour beer and they are accentuated by the oak aging. The final impression is of a complex and somewhat saison like beer."
"Overall, not a bad beer. Not anything that I am overly impressed, but solid and I am glad I got to try it. However, I do wish it had some other bugs in it."
"D: Quite an easy to drink wild ale, but probably wouldn't get it again. As a beer, good, but as a wild ale, nothing special."
"D: I could drink this beer all day. The sourness is no overpowering, but actually very refreshing. Wishing it came in more than a 8oz serving!"
"This beer is rad. I was really apprehensive about a return to wild yeast for myself. I was pleasantly surprised I need to grab a few more of these for dinner parties."
"Ddrinkability: I'm having a hard time with this one. The old wine flavors don't really invite me to take another sip."
"marmalade, melon, with a lightly phenolic finish leading to a tart kick. Not as tart as a nice gueuze/wild could be. A little twang that makes it slightly rough around the edges, but this was improved by letting the bottle breath and warm to room temperature. Just a little off, can't really put my finger on it. Overall, a nice wild that may benefit from a little more time in the barrel."
"The feel is ok, not totally drinkable."
"I really enjoy this. A nice hybrid type beer to cross the gap to wine drinkers as well. The flavor is just a little off for me for some reason. Really interesting and worth the price tag. It might not be my favorite wild ale, but still something I would recommend."
"This is a beer that I'm, very glad to have tried. It seems pretty unique amongst its wild ale brethren for being so influenced by the world of wine. This is SO worth trying."
"D - Rated good because so strong and because of the price point would have given a higher review but is very expensive but would want another given the ABV and how well this holds up."
"Overall, this beer was interesting. The wild in this beer takes on an earthy, yeast flavor along with plenty of brett. The grape tannins and vinous attributes offer an interesting dichotomy within the beer itself. Overall, it was pretty enjoyable."
"Two glasses of this was my limit but I enjoyed every drop. It is somewhat pricey but worth it for a special occasion"
"750ml bottle, June 2009, drank 11/6/09, poured into an Allagash chalice. A tight two finger head receds to nothing, a bright perfectly clear, copper hued body. The nose is fairly complex, tart tropical fruits, some nice funkiness - that damp cardboard thing goin on, also some sweetness around the edges, hard to pin down. The taste is great, tart, funky, pineapple, many layers, I am having a hard time pinning them down, but very balanced. Mouthfeel is medium/light bodied with a light carbonation. Yum, this one really does it for me, I love the tart tropical fruit flavors I am getting, goes great with my duck confit panino and belgian fries!"
"Overall a solid beer that I was happy to try. The high price tag would perhaps deter me from buying another but its certainly worth trying at least once."
"D- The aromas and flavors of this beer are big... big enough that I can truly enjoy a glass of this beer, but not any more than one glass..."
"Overall, a curious brew but well worth trying. If you're looking for something new and interesting, give it a shot."
"Drinkabaility is really nice, very well balanced and a refreshing delicate-flavored beer."
"Allagash Interlude pours a hazy light copper with a nice thick head that lingers. The aroma is a mix of sweet malt and sour, tart funk. The aroma is mild, and it is hard to pick up on the complexity. The flavor is sharp upfront, a mix of tart bitterness and carbonation. There are a lot of flavors mixing together here, green apple, tart fruit, and earthy, vinous notes. There is a characterist funk from the Brett, but it is more along the lines of sour. There is a hint of oak and the finish is dry and sharp."
"D: Pretty drinkable. Mild sour that allows you to drink the bottle all by yourself."
"For me, the overall flavor lacks a defining characteristic. The wine is very mellow. The brett is present on aroma (sediment pour) but is too mellow for me. I wonder if the 9.5% on this one prevented a bigger brett profile."
"Easy drinker and an excellent bottle to share."
"Even after about a year, the heat of the alcohol shows. I do like the aroma."
"Passed up many opportunities to have this beer up until now...not sure why. I know Russian River's sours get a lot of buzz here in the north east, I guess because they are scarce in the area, but we take for granted what great brews we have coming from places like Allagash that are so easy to come by out here."
"Flavor has much more brett and funk than the nose will let on. Wonderful bretty and wine flavor. Perfect amount of carbonation to keep this lively and dance around the mouth. The barrel effects really shine through in this beer. Wonderful beer. I'll definitely pick up one or two more of these and put them in the cellar to see what time will do to them."
"M/D: Light to medium body, carbonation is very subtle but there. Drinkability is decent. Overall, not the best wild ale I've had, perhaps it's better fresh. Solid, but nothing great."
"D: It calls to you. I don't think i need to say anything else."
"Silky body is well carbonated. Finish is a bit thin, but has lasting vinous presence. Another tasty bottle from Allagash."
"D: Reminded me of a Gargamel light. Really an excellent Wild Ale. I really do like Allagash's strain of brett. At $18 a bottle it was a pricy treat but a damn fine beer."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Super foamy, big, but thankfully the bubbles are smooth. It improves dramatically after the yeast addition towards the end of the tasting."
"Bottled Aug 2008; drunk Apr 2009. This poured a hazy copper with off-white head. It smelled like peach and honeysuckle and clover, with wild yeast and salt, and a bit of lemon and alcohol. It tasted like orange peel and peach, wild honey and wild yeast and salt, with a bit of floral hops and sweet spices. It was watery with moderate carbonation, and had a tart aftertaste. Overall this was a very delicate beer, with nice flavor and a decent body. It wasn't exciting to me, as I prefer richer and darker flavors in Belgian ales. I was also surprised this didn't have a stronger oak character, which could have nicely added to the beer's complexity. I'm not sure if age would improve this or not. It's nicely brewed and enjoyable fresh, but not great for my personal taste."
"8/4/8/4/15 (3.9/5)"
"A delectable brew. Would definitely recommend this."
"Drinkability is excellent. Did I want more? Hell yes. Would I shell out $16 for a bottle of this? For special occasions, easily. This was a well crafted beer. Everything knit together perfectly."
"Crisp and refreshing, the beer definitely hides the abv pretty well. I just wish it wasnt 20+ for a bottle..."
"Sip & enjoy on the dock, over dinner, or by the Growler - easy to drink!"
"Notes from and tasted on: 3/14/09"
"M - Very dry; well paired with the flavor influences. Low carbonation."
"D: This is a delicious beer and I would definitely try this again. However, the amount one could drink in a night is fairly limited by the high alcohol content. It is a great beer to go with food. I enjoyed this beer paired with a warm mouselline of foie gras, Interlude-sauteed pear with a sweet Interlude sauce and a crouton."
"Mouthfeel was effervescent and mouth-filling. Medium to full bodied. Overall a little underwhelming, I hoped for a little more."
"Drinkability - Enjoyable change of pace that improves as it warms. I had one tulip of it and found it to be enough."
"M- quite light, refreshing, packed with flavor. A Really interesting good beer."
"P St. Whole Foods/$20/750 ml"
"D- This is my first experience with this beer. It is good but not quite what I expected. Its quite dry and the hops seem to have faded though the oak makes itself known. Allagash always does a nice job with their beers and this one is no different."
"Drinkability: Great, especially for the Brettanomyces. They have tamed the wild yeast quite well. Personally, I prefer their other offerings a tad more. This one is a complex artwork, but not my cup of tea if Curieux or even Musette was on the table."
"D. Oh so drinkable. I really like this beer."
"i actually found the taste to be pretty disappointing after such a good start. like i said, this is a lively beer, to the point that it has champagne like qualities. still enjoyed this beer."
"Overall - I liked the beer very much, but I don't know what to expect since I haven't had many Belgian Strong Pale Ales. I would try this again and suggest it for someone who's into Belgian beers in a big way."
"Drinkability: This one improved greatly as it warmed, but also as I ""got into it," and after about half the glass, I was really enjoying it. This is a well-crafted and unique beer, exactly what I'd expect from Allagash, balanced and tasty. Alcohol is nowhere to be found, at least to the senses, and if you don't like the ""sour bombs," this is the wild ale for you."
"At first I didn't find myself rushing to finish this one, but letting it warm for about 20-30 minutes I was all over it. To me, this deal can't be too warm, but if it's colder you're really missing out. Well-constructed."
"Pours a glowing honey/golden color, rapidly diminishing off-white head leaves just a handful of spots on the glass. The smells coming out of the glass are almost more than I can even process...sourness, earthy, funky, some sugary vanilla aromas...wow! And amazingly enough, all the aromas are showing up in the flavors, with some more fruitiness throwing down. Straddling the line between full-bodied and the heavy end of medium-bodied, some spicy alcohol on the lips, and belly-warming alcohol as well. I need more of this."
"Pours just shy of an amber color with a brilliant white head on top. Smells strongly of brett funk with a hint of oak barrel as well. Tastes slightly sour and tart, full of tannins. Somewhat fruity, and with a crisp belgian pale backbone holding it all together. Really an amazing beer. Mouthfeel matches the smell and drinkability is phenomenal. My favorite allagash brew so far. I wish this were more available to me."
"D: This beer is incredibly drinkable and gratifying. My only slight complaints are in the lack of head and the price point. At $23 a bottle, I don't see myself buying this one as much as I'd like."
"Split a 750 ml bottle w/ my brother. Pours with a fairly small, white head that dissipates after a few minutes into a thin layer. Leaves a bit of lacing on the glass. Color is a gold/amber, pretty clear, effervescent. Smell is out of this world. Some definite wild-yeast aromas going on - reminds me of a gueuze in a lot of ways. Aroma is some lemon, mixed with a bit of jolly rancher green apple and some watermelon. Taste falls a bit flat. The funky sourness promised by the nose isn't really reflected in the taste. Taste is some caramel and some spicy hops, but the finish is a touch of sourness and substantial alcohol burn. The booziness is fairly prominent and hurts the drinkability. But the aroma is fantastic. Definitely worth trying, especially since they used a Brettanomyces strain from Maine. If they could tame the alcohol a bit and get just a touch more sourness, this would be world-class."
"A highly drinkable offering. While you can't necessarily taste the 9.5% ABV, there is a boozy quality that makes me want to pace myself. A solid beer--especially when considering the delicate nature of a belgian strong aged in oak."
"2008 Batch. CCRIDA's review nailed it. Wine barrel aged, brett-ridden beers can be heavenly. For my palate, this falls short. I was hoping for a vinous delight, but there was no trace of wine-like qualities to be found save for wood tannin. An acidic backbone would help, and would make this a much more enjoyable quaff."
"Overall: This beer is incredible. I only wish we could get this in New Orleans."
"Pours a cloudy light golden amber color with a thin white head that quickly fades and some visible bubbly carbonation. Aroma is funky with lots of sour oak, with some dark cherry, strawberry, vanilla and hop notes. Very funkt and tart oaky flavor with plenty of hops and crisp apple and strawberry fruit flavor. Nice balanced and very quaffable. Excellent."
"overall a good brew that is heavey on the spice"
"Good start, soft finish."
"D: This is a nice complex beer best served a at cellar temperature and sipped to allow its complex flavors to come to the front. Not a session beer but one for an evening reading a good novel by a fireplace."
"December 2007 bottle, bought at the same time as the bottle reviewed above, and cellared. The profile is quite similar, surprisingly it hasn't changed much, but it is a bit subdued, not quite as exuberant as it was fresh. Was probably better fresh, but still a very tasty and complex beer."
"Extremely drinkable, a great beer."
"Drinkability isn't that hot, cramped by the outrageous price it was even harder to enjoy then had I only paid $10 for it, which is certainly a fair price compared to many of the other brett beers being put out by US craft brewers. But to charge what they do, they need to be offering a masterpiece, not a test batch."
"drinkability: good"
"750ml bottle from The Lighthouse in Manchester. 2007 vintage Pours a virtually translucent amber-red with a thin film of off-white head. Smells sweet, fruity, and sour/acidic. Tastes fruity, bready, and sour/funky, but not overwhelmingly so. Flavors are extremely subtle and balanced. Medium-bodied with surprisingly low carbonation. Wow. This beer is the most unique beer I have ever encountered, unlike any other beer I've had. Delightfully sour/funky, but not a sour bomb. Nothing wrong with this beer, very well-crafted doubt. Even at the cost, (about 17$ per bottle), I would not hesitate to buy up more. Can't wait to see how it ages (have a bottle of 2007 and 2005 aging now)!"
"I poured the beer into a wide mouth goblet. A nice honey color with a thick head. I couldn't smell a thing, which disappointed me. However, this isn't the first beer this has happened to, so I am not sure what to make of that (maybe I'm losing my sense of smell?). I took a taste. Vanilla, cream, and a fruitiness. I couldn't quite identify the fruit. The beer felt nice and creamy and soft on my tongue, really easy to drink. One concern I have about the drinkability of this beer is that you can't tell it is 9.5%ABV, and it goes down quite smoothly. That's not necessarily a bad thing, it's got not to be whacked in the face with an alcohol taste."
"just a little too much oak, while other flavors are too dulled and thus overpowered. what happened? i enjoyed this a lot at the EBF. but now, meh..."
"This is quite an interesting, complex and very well crafted brew. The flavor profile is not my favorite of the Allagash line, but it is still a stellar beer. Definitely worth picking up."
"Giving the high ABV this beer was a delight to sit and savor. During the course of the night, I quickly began to enjoy the full body texture this beer had to offer as it warmed slight in the glass."
"Tangy fruit and tart cherry-citrus notes up front. Herbal, grassy hoppiness as well. Powdered sugar fruits (pears, grapes) bring in a little sweetness mid-palate. Slightly funky hay and cherry skin tartness come out before an oaky, almost banana aftertaste/aspirin bitter finish. Lingering vinous tannin quality. Dry. Medium-full body with an almost sticky feel. Sparkling carbonation in the finish. One of the best American Belgian-style beers around."
"2007 Bottle: There was lots of carbonation in this bottle. Very crisp and refreshing with a wonderful herbal funkiness running throughout. It was well-balanced with plenty of flavor running through the midpalate and long finish. Quite a nice way to end the night."
"I poured this beer from the 750mL bottle into a Dogfish Head oversized wine goblet. The body pours an amber color with a just off white head that keeps a nice ring around the edge of the glass and a fair amount of foam across the top of the beer. Some lacing also remains on the sides. The aroma displays tart apples with caramel and chardonnay along with some spiciness. The flavor hits you first again with the tart apples but the spiciness from the farmhouse yeast lingers throughout and is then complimented beautifully by the tart character of the Brettanomyces and some caramel sweetness. The beer exhibits a medium body with a high amount of carbonation, but a bit of dryness from the oak. This combined with the tart edge provides the drinker with a rather refreshing beverage. The beer seems to be a Saison, Belgian Strong Pale Ale, and Flemish Sour Ale all in one. That is fine by me, seeing they are all great styles. It is pretty intense, making it more drinkable to split the bottle three ways, and can become overwhelming over the course of an entire bottle by one's self. Still it a great beer as one would expect from Allagash."
"Light bronze with a full, lasting foam. Lots of depth in the nose, with hints wine stained oak, fruit and funk. Lots of taste, with hints of oak, a caressing funkiness and light fruits. Vinous character, showing light hints of red fruits. Authentic and unique. It's quite an ale."
"D - Excellent. Impressive overall. This beer needs to be reclassified as a Belgian Sour. Not a BSP in many aspects."
"It's drinkable, but not in the best way, especially considering the price of a bottle."
"Overall I thought this was excellent. Definitely a different take on the style and the complexity was just excellent overall. I was shocked by how the aroma differed from the flavor though both were well above par. It's a pricy one at $20 a bottle, but it is something that is well worth a try. Another winner from Allagash."
"Overall, definitely not my cup of tea, and in my humble opinion, they make much better varieties. This 2007 sample I had missed the mark."
"Tastes like the sour up front. Not very much yeastiness but a pretty nice selection of fruit. This moves into a seltzery middle and ends on a lingering sour node that's quite pleasant but not really what I was thinking I'd get out of an oak aged Belgian pale."
"Drinkability: Here's my problem, I found it to be overly tart, sharply so, and a bit heavy on the oak. For me, this left the overall taste to be rather disjointed, with nothing really coming together for me."
"A very great tasting beer, if only the head had better retention with aroma release, it would probably push it to a perfect score."
"Excellent beer all around. Quite complex on the palate and well balanced...the funk is well integrated and not overwhelming. I'm not sure it's worth about $20 a bottle, but then again, what is?"
"Drinkability: It's a good thing I had only one bottle of this because I would have drunk it until I lost consciousness. It's that good, and although you feel the high ABV, the tartness makes it so quenching that it goes down smooth. If it's not obvious, I really like this beer and, even though it may not be for everyone, would urge everyone to give it a shot at least once."
"This is just fabulous stuff; one of the best and more interesting beers I've had in quite some time. Probably my very favorite Allagash beer ever."
"I'm becoming a real sucker for these sour beers. This one is nicely carbonated, with a splendid mouthfeel. Allagash has let me down a bit recently, but this one hit the mark."
"Overall, very complex and very drinkable."
"Rating it straight '4's' is because the qualifier for 4 is 'good'. It's good. But almost to the point of being 'average'."
"D: Well, I'm certainly intrigued by this one. I have to admit that I'm not the biggest fan of sour ales, and this skews heavily in the sour direction. I have to give Allagash credit though as I've never tasted anything like this. Very unique."
"A complex beast of a beer. Immediate hit of carbonation followed by flavors of funky fruit, cherry, apple, plum, bread crust, oak, and barnyard. No I've never tasted a barnyard, but seriously it has this lingering flavor of how a barnyard smells, minus the shit. A dry, crisp finish with lingering tartness. Overall an AMAZING beer."
"This is an excellent beer, and yet I was a little disappointed, because I had HUGE expectations based on my love of the other Allagash oak-aged beers and the price -- $19 (compared to $14 for Curieaux). It pours a golden ruddy color with a good head, nice lacing, and a continuous stream of fine bubbles. Big aroma dominated by oak and Belgian-y floral notes. More of the same flavor-wise, with some late fruity notes (cherry? peach?) and maybe a little anise. A pleasantly bracing sharpness hits the back of the palate late. Not as complex as expected, but still very very good. Truly, I do heartily recommend this, but I enjoyed the Curieaux and the Musette more."
"edit: 10.15.10... drinking an august 2008 bottle that has been stored properly. brett really, really coming out and blending with what i call ""blood of the earth"" scents and tastes from the wine barrels. really morphed into a very well-balanced, complex beer, but the sour has gone spicy and the wood has really come out. it'll be cool to see where these bottles go after a few more years. cheers!!"
"D: This is pretty complex. I have killed the bottle over the course of about 4 hours, and had it with dinner. This isn't an everyday thing for me. I don't even know if a once a month sort of thing. I certainly enjoyed it, but most likely when I buy another it will be aging for a while."
"Drinkability is ok. This is a pretty nice and interesting beer to sip. But there is too much brett yeast flavors for my tastes. I think this is probably not balanced enough for me, and I know the price tag is too steep as well."
"Pours a cloudy amber/blood orange, thick off white head, tons of lacing, great retention. Smell is funky, vinegar, fruits, wine, oak, salty, strawberries, cherries, caramel, some acidity, insanely complex. Taste is also insane, acidic, lemons, vinegar, vanilla and oak, cinnamon, spices, caramel, biscuits, grapes, wicked good. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, some warmth and goes down easy. Insanely good and complex. Thanks a ton for sharing Russ!"
"A fine beer indeed. Thick and creamy on the middle ending with a burst of carbonation that dives even further into some glyceryl notes. Leathery earth ridden with a belgian spice and yeast shading everything. So fruity and succulent with a multiplex of fruit happenings. Some alcohol shows on the finish in the throat and chest but don't let this deter from the experience this complex beast brings to the table. Too bad I don't enjoy Belgian ales more."
"More brett here, the flavor has mellowed and turned a lot more pineapple-y than I remember. This is getting very good. Oak is in the mid and backend, carbonation is still quite nice and fluffy. The sweet-tart-sour interplay is interesting and deeper than previously, but more mellow and blended. Very nice. 4.3. Thanks to Chris Dotson for sharing!"
"D- Very drinkable. I wish I could have this more often..."
"D - Great brett beer, very flavorful w/ wonderful oakey notes from the Syrah barrels, If you like brett you will like it. I would love a second bottle to make sure, haha."
"drinkability is great. the brett funk is balanced and not overpowering. nice fruity character coming from the barrels. balanced and very nice overall. thanks stan!"
"Poured into a chalice a nice slightly cloudy deep orange color, real nice carbonation, nice little creamy off-white head, which leaves some little islands and sticky lacing. The nose is malty, yeasty, nice touch of oak, and some caramel. The taste is slighlty sweet, malty/yeasty, some oakyness/caramel. Full body, a well rounded/complex brew. Very drinkable, this one is very tasty, highly recommended. Thanks Alan."
"Highly recommended. Altogether an exceptional beer."
"Sampled at the Odds and Ends Tasting II on 10/19/07: Deep amber color with a medium thick beige head that burns off pretty quickly. Rings of lace. Aroma of yeast and sour fruit plus some spice. Medium body with a vinous and oaky character. Yeast and fruit flavors over a decent malt base. The finish is is spicy (anise) and yeasty with a fruit aftertaste. Allagash typically does a good job with their offerings and this is no exception."
"A very nice sipper. Probably a good company beer."
"D- This is so complex it's hard to say that it is drinkable. As others have said I think there is a bit too much going on with this one. The Belgian pale aspect of it has some amazing flavors that get a little undercut by the brett. If one focuses just on the wild ale characteristics of this brew still something is left to be desired with balance. I think this one comes close but falls short in the fact that it is just trying too hard to be too many things. I like complexity but sometimes its good to master simple things then throwing a bunch of different fairly good aspects together. While I am pretty hard on this brew, it was excellent and I commend the people at Allagash for putting it together. With some minor adjustments it could be up there with some of the better Russian River wild Ales. Was it worth $20? I'd say probably not but if you've got the itch sometimes you just have to scratch it. I might buy this one again if it were in the 12 dollar range."
"D: A great beer by Allagash, but at the price, I can't see myself buying it except for once or twice when it comes out each year. Still, it is a beer every craft fan should try at least once. One of the most complex beers I have ever had for sure. Thanks to Kenny at Hollingshead's for having the last stash of this at his Deli, I can't find it anywhere else in the Southland."
"I'm guessing this would pair well with a blue cheese, or Morbier and pears."
"D- This beer has some nice mysterious complexity and a good flavor but the plastic note at the end is a bit odd yet interesting."
"D - Ok, not my favorite beer. Scores higher in A,S,T because of uniqueness, not necessarily because I really dig it. Personal thing. Really different beer, though, and I am glad to have had one!"
"Pours slightly darker than 'golden', yet mostly clear with a reasonable white head and some lacing. The smell is first a pungent sourness and a little spice. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is rather light IMO. The flavor is a tart harvest fruit. The 9.5% ABV seems to be well hidden. Granted I'm not hugely experienced with these but i have sampled a handful of the top 10...i surrender that this is not my style. This one is, by far, more expensive than the other top five and I'm just not able to discern that much difference. To those that live for Belgian Strong Pale...I salute you."
"Overall: This beer is good. I love sour beers, and this one is no exception. Not only is it sour, but it is different, with it being very saison like. Too bad it is not cheep."
"Quite well done, satisfying in small amounts, a bottle to be shared, but can also be had by one person, so smooth and easy going it is."
"Thankx to franksnbeans for the hook up!"
"2007 vintage. Pours a burnt orange color with a thick, fluffy head that lingers - impressive for the higher alcohol content. Smell was mostly tropical fruit - pineapples mostly - with a hint of alcohol. Taste was outstanding with lots of flavor - pineapples, funkinesss-wild yeast characteristics, and vanilla and butterscoth flavors. The flavors blended really well together. Was velvety smooth on the mouth with some slight sweetness. Would call it medium-bodied. It was very drinkable and left me wanting more. Will definitely seek this one out again."
"Had this on tap at Toronado in San Francisco. Poured a perectly clear amber brown with little head but fantastic lacing. The smell was somewhat thin with a slight sourness a la Rodenbach, but delicate and balanced with wood and a touch of sweetness. Amazing taste. I had this on draft, and it really seems to change the flavor profile a good bit. Not like the smell at all. The sourness was way downplayed in favor of a fantastic creaminess- like a beer cream soda. Utterly creamy, and with a hint of sourness developing in the background, and a strong note of hazlenut on the finish. Utterly amazing- the transition from sour to nutty creaminess is magnificent. The mouthfeel is smooth, creamy, and delicious. Wow! Such a fascinating brew. I could sip and sip."
"March 29th, 2008 update: This beer has cellared well. I just cracked a Jan 07 bottle. The carbonation was initially explosive but then mellowed out. The beer is soft and lovely with a healthy sourness and remains wonderfully complex and drinkable."
"2006 vintage. Orange/amber with a slight chill haze that cleared up as it warmed. Off-white foam settled quickly to a thick ring with a skim of fine bubbles, then wouldn't go away. A bit of chunky lacing. Fruity aroma with some tart funk, sour cherry, sugary malt sweetness, apples, and mild alcohol. Moderate bitterness, a little funk, oaky with cherry notes, a bit of alcohol towards the end with lingering booze. Sugary sweetness and tropical fruit filled out the middle. Medium bodied, fairly light but with a bit of stickyness. Alcohol warmth was a little rough to start with. Carbonation remained spritzy throughout and it had a grainy malt texture. It really opened up as it warmed - I definitely suggest serving at cellar temperature or above. Quite tasty and interesting, though the finish was a little aggressive."
"Drinkability- Hey, the last of the rip off Allagash series turns out to be the best one of the bunch...still not at $19 (which is cheap as I have seen it for as much as $26). $12 would be a good asking price. A really tasty and complex beer nevertheless."
"Overall: A serious beer to contemplate carefully"
"This one was a slow drinker for me. I was excited from the aroma but the taste didn't seem to match. I would like to try a more recent version to compare..."
"The beer pours a golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a wonderful mix of pale, Bret yeast, and oak barrel scents. It's tart, but nothing too intense. The oak mellows it out quite a bit. The taste is exceptional. It has a warm pale malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes sour with excellent oak notes. It has quite a complex palate. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a damn fine beer. There is definately a lot going on here. The flavors are very intense and blend well together."
"Pours a two finger thick cream head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Cloudy amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Sweet/sour fruit nose. Flavor is complex it is almost sour fruit, almost apple, maybe some merlot, clean finish. High ABV is hidden. Wicked pricey - $22.00 for a 750ml corked bottle (2006) from Tully's Beer and Wine Wells, ME."
"Drinkability: The intense complexity makes this a slow-sipping beer, though it's entirely enjoyable. It's a beer best shared with someone; more than one glass might be a bit too much, but less than one glass leaves you wanting more."
"An exceptional experience, all around. Very enjoyable. Sure seems like an Americqn Wild Ale to me."
"Mouthfeel is sweet up front with honey and booze hanging on during the dry finish."
"DRINKABILITY: How can you not love sour Brett beers. And at 9.5%, this is fantastic. I split the growler with a friend, and we had NO problem drinking it all (though I could feel it afterwards). I hope I'm lucky enough to be able to try this again in the future."
"Pours a slightly orange/peach color with a dance of bubbles floating up from the Duvel 'd'. 1/4 inch head quickly deflates to a slight cap. First whiff presents a sweet malty flavor, a bit like cake and candy. Second noseful reveals the sour bret yeast and a slight peach smell. Not much in the way of hops that I can detect. And then that taste... A big sweet Belgian Golden at the start, with tart apple (plus earthy skin), pear, and a cakey middle. Then, like a damn whip crack, the sour pops up... dry, bitter, and long as a summer day. The tingly carbonation attacks the palate and underlines the pear like flavors that appeared initially. Only as the beer warms do the oak notes appear... almost a honey note that mixes (rather surprisingly) with the tart sour finish. In fact, Interlude isn't finished with the long, dry end. The sweetness from the barrel is actually the last note I get. This is unlike anything I've tasted before. Body is on the fuller side of light. I would prefer it a bit ""thicker," but its rescued by the tap dancing of the carbonation across the tongue. As for drinkability-- its delicious and unique, but certainly not something I would more than a glass of at a time. Certainly this wasn't intended as a session beer, so for what it is, it succeeds in that regard. This is a fascinating creation that I feel fortunate to have put my hands on. Well worth the $20/bottle I paid."
"Cheers!"
"D: The ale is satisfying from first to last, with a flavor explosion that is rarely even seen in a beer. The ale is pricy but it will knock your socks off."
"Brett--- I love brettanomyces, and this beer has just the right brett taste for me. It is not that great looking, smelling, or even tasting. And it damn sure isn't worth the price, but the tiny little moment of Brett makes this bottle seem like it might be worth it the $16 I payed for it. My review score might not be that great, but this is a beer that is worth seeking out for any lover of wild ale tasting beers. Good stuff."
"Got in trade. 2006 Vintage. Poured from a corked and caged 750ml bottle into my NBB snifter. It was a slightly hazy reddish orange color. It had a small bubbly head that went away in a flash. Slight carb. After reading other reviews, I was expecting this really powerful and great aroma. But mine was kinda muted. Really had to sniff to get anything but was there was yeasty, a bit oaky and slightly sweet. The taste also seemed muted. Got in a trade so hard to tell exactly how old the sample is or if it had been traded a couple times and shipped multiple times. Mouthfeel was really good. Overall, it was just an average beer (again maybe bad sample) in my opinion. From what I read and from other Allagash's that I've had I'm hoping mine was just off and will seek out another. (3.5, RB, T, O)"
"Drinkability is good, I'll have no problem finishing this 750. But for sour I'd prefer a Rodenbach Grand Cru, for a BSPA I still like Duvel or Don de Dieu, and for Allagash I still love Odyssey."
"Overall this beer is a pleasure to drink."
"An absolutely fantastic brew.... will I spend $20 for it again? Undecided as of yet."
"Incredible beer, hats off to Allagash. This is their Temptation."
"I have every intention of consuming more and more of this magnificent brew. a huge cheers to Rob and Allagash for continuing to push themselves and their art. this is the work of a master brewer."
"A potent concoction with a lovely blend of interesting flavors and smells. This is a strong ale and it shows in the alcohol warmth."
"D: I wasnt super impressed with this beer off the get go. It did grow on me but not leaps and bounds. The beer had very good depth and complexity but the overall flavors didnt blow me away. I did enjoy this beer but for the price I wouldnt buy it again."
"D - Very tasty. The Brett gives it a nice sour touch."
"Very enjoyable beer, but the flavors are so strong that I don't think I'd drink more than one at a time."
"Interlude may not rise to the stratospheric heights of some of the brewery's other offerings, but it isn't far behind. I'd like to see them mix things up from year to year, perhaps adding a little less Brettanomyces next time. I hope they continue to push the brewing envelope because I almost always love the result. Allagash is a national treasure."
"Overall: This seems like a stronger, fruitier and more sour Orval. I really, really like beers that use Brettanomyces, so take the ratings with a grain of salt."
"Definitely try this one. Fancy enough for wine drinkers, but beer enough for beer drinkers."
"A truly complex beer with a great idea behind it. I'm looking forward to trying Allagash's other special releases. A really great concept behind this beer that I look forward to drinking again."
"drinks fairly easily, with a slight woodiness and a medium carbonation. funky, slightly fruity, and with a sour, woody finish. for its impressive pedigree, it's got a fairly reserved character; for the price, i'd much prefer a more assertive nature all around."
"Light-Medium bodied finishes dry with a wonderful aftertaste. Easy drinking as can be for a 9.5% beer. Was it worth what I paid? Yes, definitely, but I can't afford the 16.99 I spent on it."
"Very few beers deliver on the promise of the lable, nor the hype. This beer exceeds all expectations. Though I'm not sure about the Belgian Strong Pale characterization, the beer is great at any style. Distinctly Belgian aromas (tartness and sourness) with a musty, farmhouse astringent that challenges the tastebuds. The challenge of the brew stops short of agression or harsh, instead tempered with aged hops, oak barrels and a complex vineous roundness. The beer is well matured and balanced offering rich, over-rippened pineapples, peaches and pears for sweetness. The alcohols are well woven into the fruity, spiciness with merged with nuttiness, oakiness, and strong berry tartness. This is one of the better beers sampled in quite some time, and just in time for the spring season."
"D - Good. It is easy to drink, I had no difficulty finishing the fifth alone. Absurdly pricey. I would have to say it is not worth the $20 it cost me. Maybe for a special occasion - like if I am having dinner with several beer aficiandos and a saison would go perfectly, then it might be worth that much, but it is still overpriced (maybe it actually costs a lot to manufacture, but in that case the product return is fairly mediocre). Sure it is a good beer, but you can do better in the style. Worth a try if you can afford it."
"D- I think this beer is great and gets better the more you drink of it and the more flavors you can figure out. I don't think this is just a relaxing beer to have that you could drink every day but it is a great special treat and one you would want to sit down and think about. I think I would pay the money for it again but it wouldn't be a lot."
"Notes: My favorite from Allagash and one of my favorite of all time. Price tag is worth every penny."
"I couldn't drink too much of this but it was an absolute delight."
"If I could get this at a decent price and it was available I would consider this a great session beer. The high ABV(which is very well hidden) might scare some off. Great brew here."
"Honey wheat colored body is a little darker than expected from the style. It yields a little more light twords the bottom of the glass. Off white head at three fingers is fluffy, and leaves nice lace. Invigorating spicey nose really penatrates the senses and opens the eyes. Includes hints of apple and peppery spice. Enters the mouth with a sharp fresh fruit with a large dose of spicey tongue tingle. There is a lot going on with the palate, very complex with nice layers. Nicely hidden alchol. Good balance overall. Mouthfeel is souredsweet and long. Very drinkably good. This beer is very good but not worth its almost 20 dollar price tag."
"Economics. At around $20/750ml, many will ask is it worth it? My opinion is yes. A champagne like mouthfeel and an incredibly complex taste you have to work to figure out. This is not an every day beer, but it is certainly one I will revisit a couple times a year. Bet it would be great with sushi."
"Appeared a yellow-hay color with a big frothy white head. Semi-murky with some nice lacing left behind. Aromas of yeast, pines, honey, and passion fruit; very interesting. The taste was bold with brett flavors working seemlessly with unique fruits. Clean and a touch of spice. Very flavorful and exciting with so many things going on. An excellent beer."
"This beer reminded me a lot of Orval, no doubt because of the yeast used. Its very complex and dry. Very light and easy to drink for its ABV as well."
"This is another sipper to enjoy from Allagash. Fans of tarter sours might like this more than say, the tripel styled Curieux, or heavier Musette. Certainly going for blending and fuzzying of that line between beer & wine, but doing so with success and quality."
"I remember thinking when I bought this that it was expensive, but having tasted it I'd gladly pay more - although I hope I don't have to as I intend to buy more!!! It ranks right up there with the other Brett and oak enhanced ales coming out of the US, and in my opinion it's a little more rounded, softer, and more drinkable. The alcohol is never noticeable, and there's enough Brett character to satisfy even the die-hard fan without becoming sharp. It's rounded, well-balanced, and interesting! Superb!"
"A cidery aroma and appearance, something Cantillon. Some lace. But more enjoyable on the palate, malt and incredibly subdued from being wild and funky. Wine and woody taste, an easy drink, far better accompanied by food. Spicy and herbal.Not sweet, a fine beverage."
"Thanks MRMOJORISIN for sharing this pricey brew. . . ."
" I am pleasantly reminded of Supplication from RR as I drink this, and I am off to eat goat cheese and lobster tail with the rest of the bottle."
"On tap at BARCADE BKLYN NY, on Allagash night 11-17-06, one look at this beer and you know something special is about to cross the lips, cloudy, light apricot with a crazy, puffy, tiny bubble head, leaving outstanding lacing/sheeting, funky, yeasty, floral nose. More funky woody,Brett notes, fresh, tasty, bold, complex, herbal, yeasty, spicy, my kind of beer, thank you Allagash and Barcade for this world class creation which was super to enjoy on tap!"
"Drinkability was top-notch as it is with most Allagash beers. Great addition to their stable of wild Belgian-style American beers."
"Wow. The aroma was most intriquing, with spicy/ fruity phenolic earthy complexity. The flavor delivers on the aroma, and adds tartness and a hint of fruity banana. This tastes like what you would get if you crossed a Saison with Flemish brown ale, and Geuze! Weird. Delicious. Expensive. Totally worth it. Do not miss the chance if it comes your way."
"drinkability: easy, ABV well hidden"
"Pours a hazed butterscotch with a very brief off-white, fizzy head of foam. Settles to a light ring quickly. Smells of sour cherry Brett and light notes of alcohol. Taste is similar, along with grapes and some green apples. Prominent dark-toasted oak finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied and slightly drying. Every sip should be taken with slow appreciation. Outstanding!"
"After writting this, I REALLY need to write them an email, and figure out how they primed this beer. The carbonation is just so perfect in everyway, I need to know how to do that for my next homebrew belgian."
"This beer is a king in it's class, absolutely enigmatic and amazing all at the same time."
"Earthy/grassy hops are there in the fruity flavor. I thought that it came off more tart than anything else. Some pear/apple tones running the show. The oak is here too, just quite subdued. Light bodied with the loads of carbonation being somewhat tingly on the tongue. A little pricey, especially given that brett brews arent necessarily my favority. Otherwise, very nice complex brew. Ill have to try the musette next."
"Delicate is the best way to describe this one as it dances across the tongue. I've never loved saisons, but this is spectacular. Sweet ripe cherries with a mildly oaked quality pervade the mouth.	 Notes of merlot and dark berry jam explode upon the tongue as this warms. This is luscious and subtle all at the same time. Intensely complex, this is one of the best offerings out of Allagash or any brewery."
"an absolutely awesome saison. I wish i had picked up a couple more bottles, and i hope it's planned again for this year."
"Very light and airy mouthfeel, like champagne without the excess carbonation getting in the way. Incredibly easy drinking, with the ETOH hidden stealthily in the background. Complex and incredibly interesting, though I'm not sure that I know if it is worth the hefty price tag to have multiple times."
"Taste is fruity, hoppy and refreshing at first followed by flavors of wildeness and farms. Berries, apple and bananas come in and tickle your palate and ends in a dry sour finish."
"Tart, livlely, with a balanced acidity. Oaky, earthy. Notes of cinnamon and pear come out as it warms. Medium bodied, lively carbonation. With all that brett flavour and the barrel aging, it's a tasty hybrid between saison and lambic."
"Both the brettanomyces and the red wine notes come through in the taste. Very well balanced between sweet and sour, with very little bitterness. Not nearly as strong tasting of the brett as some other beers made with the yeast I have tasted. Superbly drinkable! The 9.5% doesn't come through at all, even as it warms. The mouth feel is a bit prickly, but the carbonation fades quickly. Overall, a tremendous, complex, and delicious beer. Expensive (over $16!), but pick it up if you see it!"
"A clean sparkleing copper/amber beer. Has a nice fluffy white head and a little lace. There is a sweet and tart apple like aroma. Very much like a cider. The flavor starts with a quick bit of apple tartness. Followed by a serious dry character in the middle and finished with a light crisp tart finish."
"Mouthfeel smooth and on the lighter side with a fast paced carbonation that fills the mouth. An extremely pleasurable brew that is equally easy to imbibe. This bottle is quickly disappearing and I'm loving every minute of it. My new favorite Allagash brew, I'll be looking forward to having this again and see what else their experimental series has to offer. Do yourself a favor and track down a bottle. Cheers to both goodbyeohio and blitheringidiot of the opportunity to sample this one."
"What an enjoyable brew this is. The balance of this beer is enlightening; fresh vibrant fruit notes intermingle with the funky wild yeast notes and provide an entirety to this tipple that the individual components could not hope to achieve."
"Poured into a wine glass a burnt orange that leaves a white lace on top of the glass. There is a slight cascade in the body from carbonation. The smell is horse blanket, very vinos, with some fruit essence. The taste is sweet a slight hop citrus profile but dominated by a wine (tannin) quality. Finishing fruity, with a grape, sweet fruit balance. I paired this beer with a grilled steak and artichokes. The savory flavors in the steak really went well with the fruit, tannin, qualities in the beer."
"Brewing this one must have been quite an undertaking from start to finish, but the blending of ingredients and aging were obviously well worth the effort. Close your eyes and it could almost be a fine wine, but that beasty duo of yeasts makes it all beer. The ABV is big, and quite gutsy in its presentation, but it's also warming, and a pleasant enough caution. I'd imagine this is one that would challenge some folks' palates, but it sits wonderfully on mine."
"A masterpiece. 17 dollars is a bargain."
"On-tap at the Blind Tiger, November '05. I enjoyed this guy, though it didn't quite strike me as a saison. Poured a pretty clear orangeish color. Reminded me a lot of champagne, with some very buttery and nutty notes. There's some citrus rind to be found in the taste, and some floral hings as well. A nice, zesty twist a the end of a sip. Mouthfeel was oily and slick, with just enough bubbles. A really lovely brew- gotta find this in bottle form."
"Corked 750ml. Somewhat murky golden orange body with a small white head. Some scattered webbings of lace. Interesting funky brett notes with some backing of citric fruits. Notes of spices and a bit of woodiness are present. Light tartness as well. Flavor starts with some fruit sweetness of the funky brett notes that come on strong. Some oak and tart flavors really added to the complexity. Some hot alcohol was also noticeable through all the other intricacies. Finishes up with some brett laced sweet fruits. Well carbonated and lively in the mouth. Easy drinking but quite the sipper with everything going on in it. Quite a unique and tasty treat."
"This new funked up bretty saison from Allagash was aged in French merlot and sirah barrels and it shows. A light toasted orange colour with a nice head off cinnamon sprinkled off-white this one lookes like a real winner. It smell slike a winner with farmhouse and brett induced funky yeast notes in the aroma. The taste is funky as well with a nice winey touch from the wine barrels used. The oak is subdued, how I like it, and the beer is not hot at all for a 9.5% brew. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and the drinkability is very, very good. This funky one-off brew from Allagash is a winner in every category as far as I am concerned. I just wish the price point was lower so I could drink this more often. As for now i'll keep my eyes out for this on tap again!"
"I can't wait to try this after it's had more time in the cellar. Recommended!"
"Bottle: Poured a deep hazy and cloudy amber color ale with a medium white bubbly head with minimal retention. Aroma of Brett is quite strong with some sourness and some sweet white wine characteristic. Taste is quite sour with some tart and oak flavouring. The wine oak aging can definitely be notice but does not overtake the beer. Funky Brett brings a nice finish to this beer. Alcohol is not noticeable but Im not sure that the high level of ABV really brings anything more to this beer and would probably have preferred a slightly lower ABV (6.5%-7.5%). Another great American wild ale that even though is excellent is still one notch below the RR Temptation."
"What a wonderful, interesting beer. This would go well with many foods, but it's absolutely fascinating enough to have on its own. Yet another triumph from the Allagash guys."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1"" off-white head above the slightly cloudy orangy copper brew. Head lasts and lasts, largely due to continued effervescence rising in a fury from the bottom of the glass, with lacing consisting of various bits of foam throughout. Aroma is tart and fruity, with underlying spiciness. Taste is fruity upfront, with the tartness in play as well, with oak, spices, and alcohol warming coming on towards the swallow. Mouthfeel is dueling dry and sweet, yet somehow makes it work, and drinkability is good. These brews pique my interest and curiosity keeps me coming back."
"This poured with a thin, white head and the beer itself was very cloudy and deep amber in color. The nose was musty, apple-like, and very much brett-driven. The mouthfeel was thick and full, very bubbly and scrubbing. I got a taste of sour apple and brett mustiness on the tongue. The finish was utterly sour and puckering and vividly comes back as I type this. It was a very memorable beer. This is a beer that will wake up the ol' palate and leave you thirsting for more."
"Absolutely great full flavor. At first sweet but then quickly followed by a clout of spices (pepper, clove, cinnamon). There is also some nice sourness going on. Not enough to make me pucker but enough to make me run my tongue across my lips. Really get some nice flavors from the yeast--quite juicy and chewy actually. Also got some nice fruit: apricots and peaches. Kind of a grape juice feel to it--syrupy. Some nice flavors from the oak (not sure what the word is though). Nice dry finish that completes this beer perfectly. Such a nice digestive beer and to work slowly through the whole night."
"Well the beer looked fine but the smell of uric acid made me think of cat piss and I couldn't get it out of my mind as I sipped this beer. There was also leather and a bit of tobacco in the smell mixed with a farmhouse malt funk. It had a taste like none other, but the mouthfeel was the first thing I noticed how the dense carbonation gave the taste an explosive life on the tongue. Full of spicy peppery notes but subdued by a tart asprin flavor only to live again as earthy flower and a touch of pine. The aftertaste carried some tonic water feel in the back of my mouth. The third of the bottle I had was just right, but I could have finished off the rest with out help."
"This is exceptional, absolute beer drinking Nirvana. The beer, a hazy luminescet gold. The head, pale white and thin, touches of lacing grip the glass. The aroma, decadant, with shades of currant, plum, red wine, spice. The flavours, lightly tart, vinous, orange peel, currant, earth. Beautifully done...."
"Just as stunning as expected to look at, it jumps out of the bottle a pale gold, creating waves of white foam that sticks around the glass edges. The brett tickles the nose with its dryish pineapple, limey, exotic musty flavors, while the wine barrels offer a different floral to look at. Im at first surprised by the syrah and merlot declared origins as the grape character certainly seem paler, tarter, not overly tannic and juicy enough. Gentle mineral character remind of salt briefly, but the fruits offer flavours to match, notably in the shape of sweet berries, banana, apple. Crunchy in its yeastiness, like an elaborated pie crunch slowly heads toward sourdough territory as the tartness grows, remaining centered on the vinous fruitiness and oaky elegance. Soft rounded body drinks easily, light-medium in size with delicate if very active carbonation. Despite the juicy profile being pretty sweet initially, it dries out a fair bit toward the finish. Restrained, peaceful. This is delicious and a revelation to one who thought their barrel experiments never approached the originals, I may not enjoy it as much as their triple, but few other brewers would have this as my second favourite of their lineup. As playing with wild yeasts is quickly becoming the next fad of the industry, it is excessively pleasant to see experts like Rob Tod making some of the first steps and defining benchmarks examples after which others should inspire their desired quality."
"This beer was very carbonated when poured and created a very large head that dissapeared quickly. Hardly any lacing on the glass. The appearance was a cloudy orange color with many tiny carbonation bubbles making their way to the surface. The aroma was very strong. What I smelled was wine and a sourness with a faint hint of the oak. My initial taste was again the wine and sour flavors and at first I wasn't extremely impressed. There was too much carbonation in the mouth. However, when I let the glass sit for a bit, I was much more impressed. It became much more drinkable at that point. I was very impressed with the uniqueness and complexity of this beer. It's hard to believe it is 9.5%. Although this is a pricy beer, I suggest everyone try at least 1 if you can find it."
"All in all, a great beer. I am often skeptical about barrel aging, but in this case it worked beautifully. Not really your typical Saison (which maybe I was happy about) but certainly an interesting and delicious beer."
"Pours an amber color with a tall head that sticks around and leaves quite a bit of lacing on the glass. The aroma has a bready character with some spicing and a sourness along with some woody hints. Complex. The flavor was well spiced with sweetness and fruits to go along with the slightly sour finish. The slight sourness sticks around along with the fruits. The body is moderate and the drinkability is quite good."
"Man, this smells woderful. I hate to mention other beers when reviewing another, so I won't. BUT, it really reminds me of at least two of my very favorite beers, distinct common smells. Those are: a very flowery scent, rose-like, just really fresh and green. Also some fairly sweet sugar cookies in there, and maybe some sweetness from the wine barrels? I know that tart or sour aren't really smells, but tastes, but I can tell this will be slightly sour. And yep I'm right. But just slightly sour. This is a great saison though, and definitely somewhat of a hybrid style. It's got a rugged earthyness to it, plenty off grassy, woody character and lots of crab appley attitude. Your basic saison. Then there's the whole barrel aged goodness of this beer. I must say I'm not that hip to wine, so I don't really know what I'm talking about, but I love the flavors that are imparted here. This beer started pretty cold, and it's easy to tell what the base taste is, the basic saison I was talking about. Then as it warms there's lots of complexity piling up. Lots of sweet and tart vinous notes, and a hearty oakiness. This is definitely a hearty, wintery saison. Though not much of an alcohol bite, nice. My only complaint is that it seems overly carbonated, almost like a champagne or something. Very tingly and fizzy on the tongue makes it tough to pick out the many complexities of this beer. Wish it had a softer mouthfeel. Maybe some aging would do this one a favor? Either way, still an excellent beer, with some really classy packaging that lives up to the talk. Funky American beer. Yum."
"Aroma is sour and spicy and a little bit funky. Taste is sour fruit, with some spicy dry notes and some slightly buttery merlot and peppery sirah flavors that linger. But this beer isn't overwhelmed by the barrel it was aged in. It still tastes like beer, and even some hoppiness or is it just earthiness makes an appearance in the aftertaste. Medium to full bodied with a high rate of carbonation. I wouldn't call this a saison, though - just an amazing beer. This would probably cellar well, but I wouldn't be able to hold on to it long enough to find out."
"Didn't quite strike me as a saison but this is definately worth a revisit. I look forward to getting a bottle of this."
"Drinkability: This is one dam fine beer. The alcohol is listed 9.5% I cannot tell in the taste, smell, or mouthfeel. This beer is definately good now. I wonder how another year or so would make the beer taste. Perhaps some more of the dryness would come out. Overall a definate treat now."
"By the way, I sampled this at the NEBF last October, and don'y remember it tasting this good."
"Props to gabe for sharing this treat!"
"750 ml bottle. Purchased at Brawley's in Charlotte for $17."
"Buckets of karma go out to Delirium on this one."
