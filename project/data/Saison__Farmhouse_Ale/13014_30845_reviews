"Bubblegum yeasty with a spiciness to it. Ok saison but for the cost I would prefer a lift bridge farm girl"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Funky farmhouse smell, not off-putting. Heavy in the malt sweet smell. Taste is somewhat citrus but a lot of black pepper spices and dry malt finish. This is good beer."
""
""
""
""
"Didn't care for this one."

"a real generic saison for a brewery i know to be one of the most distinct of all, so this was a real letdown, not that i expected much from their saison, its not their game, but still, this was disheartening. a flat looking hazy blonde beer, thick with sediment and hardly holding a quarter inch head. its all belgian yeast esters, very little real grain character or funk to this, and without that, it needs to be elegant, but unlike the lively belgian or french versions, this one is just heavy with spent yeast and wheat malt, and never gets anywhere. there is a grassy hop thing to it, which is its only real unique feature, but the mouthfeel is dense and sweet, and it really doesnt work all that well. against all saisons on the market, its not at all bad, above average even, but by surly standards, its pretty poor. stick to what you are good at here, because you are SO good at it!"

"The price is preeeetty steep on this beer (no doubt cheaper per can in a pack), but it is a very good Saison that hit the spot, since it's been awhile since I've had one. Certainly not the most wild Saison I've had, but it's a very, very good example of one and one that is super drinkable. If it weren't for the price (and the fact Surly doesn't distribute to Michigan...), I'd make this a go-to Saison. Delicious."
""
""
""
"I just started getting into Saisons this summer and although I don't have a huge sample size to go off of, this was one of the better saisons I have had. I know Surly is known more for their IPAs but this beer was very refreshing on a hot summer day."
"Gotta thank VDubb for allowing me to finally try this stuff out.  It pours a mostly clear brass-gold topped by a finger or so of white foam.  The nose comprises mild clove, black pepper, Belgian yeast, light sourdough, and a touch of dried honey.  The taste brings in more of the same, along with a bit of grass and flowers for the sake of it.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish.  Overall, a pretty solid saison (or whatever they're calling it nowadays), especially from cans.  'Nuff said."

"Overall: Alrgiht. Probably wouldn't spend $10+ on a 4-pack, but would like to try this on tap sometime. A decent lawn-mowing beer, a bit more Belgian than I was expecting."

"The Belgian yeast really comes on strong with this one and that's a good thing. Great balance between the malt and hops. This one comes on slowly and leaves you thinking, ""dam, that's an awesome farmhouse style beer."" If you like this style, this is one of the better examples."
""

"Surly Cynic is a light, enjoyable drink that keeps you on your toes with a complex, sweet finish."

"D: Probably my first Belgian style from a can and a tasty one at that. Flavors are rather restrained making this good but not particularly great IMO. Perfect for warmer weather affairs. Light and refreshing with a nice crispness. Surly doesn’t make a bad brew. Would have again."

"This a very unique very enjoyable Saison, I like this style of beer, and wow... this stuff is good. As for why it's good, it's refreshing, but not boring at all, the black pepper flavors are flat awesome, I've never tasted that in a beer before. Apricots, pears, and some other light fruits are present in this one, but what's great about this beer is that it's NOT sweet, it's kinda peppery! Just so cool, so good, so refreshing, a very underrated beer, even at the 90-Outstanding rating you see above, in my humble opinion."

"Overall: No surprise Surly brings another high quality brew. Really enjoyed the carbonation in this brew which really made it an easy drinking saison. Excellent balance of fruits and spice."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Recommendation - A must try for belgian drinkers."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"I really think that Surly decided to make a pretty easy going Belgian-style pale ale when they made this, and rebranded it as a saison due to the grassy hoppy profile, as well as the spice and funk in the yeast. Don't expect anything super complex, however - this drinks far more like a Belgian pale ale or a lowly pilsner, at the end of the day. It definitely wouldn't be a bad option for me if I had it at a bar or something, but with so many far more complex and intriguing saisons out there, as well as those that are equally refreshing, this does feel a bit lost out at sea overall."

"Overall this is an enjoyable saison will def pick some of this up for warmer weather.  Binnys had a $2 off coupon so I had to try it"
""
""
""
"Overall: This is my first saison in a can! I have drank a beer that tastes exactly like this, but I can not put my finger on what that beer is... This beer is a well made sasion that does not have too much wow factor, but it is a nice straight forward saison thats true to it respective beer style. I would call it effortlessly good. I would consider this my personal lawnmower beer since I dislike ""flavor less light beer"" aka BMC beers. Bonus points as always for beer packaged in a can!"
""
"A surprisingly delicious beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall just super easy drinking. ABV absolutely undectable. recommended!"
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is great. Crisp but good bodied. Carbonation is spot on for the style. There is a creamy finish from the oats that is really nice."
""
"Another really impressive beer from Surly. Their brewing is a lot more sophisticated than the average well respected American brewery's. Furious, Abrasive, Darkness, all these beers are in big, bold, popular American styles, but they are all very multifaceted and subtly crafted. CynicAle is no exception to the trend of fine work from Surly."

"O/D-A supremely drinkable, refreshing Saison. Nothing too inventive or crazy here, just a fun can of beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: An easy drinking saison that will pair with any meal or on its own."
""
""
""
""
"D/O: A satisfying and approachable saison; this beer has just the right amount of Belgian yeast influence, not to mention the other detectable continental ingredients. Surly's Cynic is something of a black sheep for that brewery, and probably worth a try even by those that do not favor ales such as Furious or Bender."
""
""
"Pours a pale gold topped by a pure white two finger head. Above average retention, significant lacing. Peaches, farmhouse yeast, lemon zest, light citrus, and a hint of spiciness. Opens with apricot, floral notes, hay, and light citrus notes. Earthy yeast and lemon zest join in midpalate. Finishes dry with continued yeastiness and citrus joined by white pepper. Light bodied, pleasant lively carbonation, smooth mouthfeel. A nice saison brewed with American hops. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall- A wonderful American take on the farmhouse ales of Belgium and France...and it comes in a sweet can."

"Overall – 3.75 – It does taste a little bit like a standard wheat beer, I was hoping for more funky-ness."
""
""
""
"CynicALe pours a hazy golden color with a long lasting lacing head. There is a strong sweet and yeasty aroma, with creamy bread like notes. The taste has a subtle Belgian candy undertone, with a stronger yeasty and beady like flavor rounding it out. Perfect carbonation, and very drinkable. Overall the best saison I have had to date."
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a refreshing and easy drinking saison with plenty of flavor to boot. If this was available to me regularly, it would be a staple for me during the summer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very interesting take on the Farmhouse style. I definitely like this better than Ommegang Hennepin.. which is ironic as Minneapolis is located in Hennepin County. Funny that Ommegang is pricing themselves out here.. Surly makes some great shelf beers here that holds up well, style-wise."

"O - This is a very easy drinking and tasty Saison. If I had this I would have it often in the summer. Very nice flavor profile."
""

"O/D - Drinkable but definitely not too intensly interesting. More hopping might improve this a tad. Spice was a bit much, but it was decent."

"Overall (3.75): This is a pretty good saison. I may have been sliiightly generous on a point here and there, but I give this credit for being a quaffable saison in a great package (4-packs of 16oz cans? C’mon, don’t we all wish we could get saisons as such?) . . . good for them, I say, and I wish other breweries (ahem, Sixpoint) would follow suit. As for the beer, in my opinion it was slightly too phenolic (the herbal qualities were not always flattering), and could use more spice and hops to help balance the malt (not that it was a particularly malty saison in any way, but still). But, undoubtedly, a good saison that performs better slightly warmer, as fits the style. Glad to have tried."

"Overall - Only touches on the components that would make a it a really good saison, but there aren't any flaws or off-flavors. Surly always makes a good product."
""
"O: Decent, but not something I'd seek out too often. The mash-up of styles doesn't work well for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer is medium-light to medium in body, with carbonation of medium intensity, resulting in a beer that foams up nicely as it moves across the palate, traveling fairly smoothly and without harsh fizz. Closes out semi-dry and with little stickiness lingering across the palate."

"O: I have to admit, I was pleasantly surprised. Surly has done an excellent job of re-imagining the saison style, and has delivered something that is far from cliche'. Really solid brew."
""
""
"O: A nice saison from Surly. Pretty standard, well balanced and drinkable. Not a huge in-your-face beer but it comes together nicely and goes down easily. Great example of the style."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy yellowish gold color. The nose is strong with yeast, a slight bubble gum, and slight citrus fruits. Comes across the palate as balanced hops and malt with slight floral notes. It has subtle finish that gradually dissipates. Very good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear golden color with a small-medium white head that disappears quickly. Scent is wow... not what I was expecting. Now that I read about this beer...a saison??? In a can??? If anyone can do it, it's Surly I suppose. Smells somewhat similar to a saison, but with a strang malt liquor aroma. There is the black pepper, spiciness, and Belgian yeast aromas of a good saison... not much funk though. However, this strange malt liquor aroma is somewhat off-putting. Taste is a little better. Luckily, it does not taste like malt liquor. It does taste like a saison. A great saison??? No. The pepper and spiciness is there. The light fruitiness and Belgian yeast flavors are there. A ton of floral flavors. It lacks the funk and has some strange flavors that I've never got from any saison/farmhouse ale before. As it warms...I'm starting to get that malt liquor profile in my mind again. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied, with a spicy, tingly finish. Drinkability is high. Overall, I didn't see ""saison"" anywhere on the can. So, there is a possibility Surly wasn't even trying to create a saison. Regardless, this is a very tasty beer. An AMAZING fizzy yellow beer (hence the title)... a mediocre saison."
""
"A light amber body with a bit of a golden tint sits beneath an ecru cap that rose a good two+ fingers. Good retention with tons of clingy lace. The nose is floral and spicy. White pepper and clove with a little Belgian yeast tang/funk. Earthy undertones. On the palate, this guy slides right in. Floral spicy notes up front. Some mild fruity esters (pear and apple) from the yeast with pine and earth underneath. Some cracked grains through the middle leading to a dry finish of spice and floral/earthy hops. Light to medium body, good feel. This is a fairly straightforward saison. The flavors all work well together, good body, the carbonation is a little too high, but never really gets in the way. Solid across the board. Will gladly have this guy in my glass again."

"Overall: A highly underrated saison."

"O: This might be the easiest drinking saison that I have tried and it comes with the bonus of being in a can. There is very light dryness (especially compared to others in the style) and good flavors. Quite enjoyable and just shy of sessionable - a little too strong in ABV to be truly sessionable but I could have a couple of these."
"Good saison."
"Final Thoughts: This one is geared more towards the BMC crowd (although maybe not intentionally). I wonder why this is brewed year-round. Would I drink it again? No. Hell, Bitter Brewer, and SurlyFest are much better options (close to this style) if you're in the mood to get Surly."
"This poured out as a slightly hazy golden color. It had a nice looking white head on top with a good retention and a touch of lacing on the glass. The smell of the beer has some subtle fruit and spice notes to it, there is an aroma of fresh grain as well with a mellow sweetness. The taste of the beer is light, refreshing and doesn't really show it's true colors till the aftertaste. The settling flavors of the earthy hops and the black pepper notes shine bright. The mouthfeel is crisp, smooth and clean feeling, leaving behind some stickiness in the mouth afterward. Overall I didn't know it was supposed to be a Saison but I could definitely make that assumption from the first sip to the last."
""
"O - Yet again Surly delivers the attributes of the style offering a solid dose of flavour and a unique fruity twist. Flavourful and drinkable. This is a brew that I could drink all night, and I'm certain many would agree. Do yourself a favour and grab a can."
"O - a fantastic example of the style with its own surly character, this would be a go to sessioner were it available in my hood"
""
""
"I'm not really big on farmhouse styles, I could take them or leave them but this was most enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: It does not blow me away but it is a very well-crafted brew. Enticing nose, great flavor, and excellent mouthfeel."
""
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. Goes well with poutine. Would go well with other foods with subtle flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A decent enough beer but not really up my alley, would be cool to have this with just a touch of the traditional American hops taste added to it."
""
""
""
"Eh not bad for what it is, but Surly has so many better offerings, I probably won't seek this one out again."
""
""
""
"Cost: $8.99 for a four pack."
""
"This is a light to medium bodied saison. It is crisp and easy drinking with a pleasant uplifting level of carbonation that is spritzy throughout the entire duration. Fans of saisons need to give this one a try."
""
""
"O: 4"
""
""
"Hm, bit of a disappointment to me. Poured at a good temperature with a smallish, off-white, foamy head that quickly subsided to a large island and ring with almost no lace. Color is a clear amber with one bubble trail. Aroma is yeast, malt, grass, caramel. Flavor's similar to nose, a little too sweet for style, and sweet up front, some carbonic tang, and yeast/hop bitter. Body and carbonation are ok. Finish is like flavor, kind of long and again, too sweet; couldn't finish it. Not for me."
""
"One of the smoothest drinks I've had in some time. Some may lament the lack of high carbonation and hops often found in saisons but I think it only enhances the drinkability and makes this one a great tasting beer."
""
""
""
"Just one of many fantastic beers from Surly."
""
"O-A wonderful Saison, not the best one but a solid one indeed. With a few more Surly beers to go from a trade I'm starting to see why everyone is so high on this brewery."
""
"I like this one in that it leans towards the hop side of the spectrum of Saison instead of the spiced side."
"O- not too shabby. The canned format gets bonus points, but I'm not sure I'd love drinking a saison straight out of the can..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the better domestic examples of the style I've tried - though lacking in the floral notes or intensity of the best saisons - the Surly cult was not founded without reason."
""
""
""
"O: solid, nothing spectacular. The smell got me really excited that it would be a bit more balanced in taste, but it's a pretty regular but good saison."
""
"Overall nice Saison, interesting blend of yeast, fruit and spice. Really nice balance with this one, good one for an introduction to this style."
"O: I enjoyed this beer. As mentioned above, I really enjoyed the peachy taste near the end. I wish it was a bit less sweet and lighter (and more refreshing) in mouth feel."
"The beer is orange with a thick head that leaves some random spots of sticky lacing on the glass. The aroma offers oranges, spice, lemon, grass, dank hops, lemon zest, malt. Light in body, this is easy drinking. While I would not put it on par with the better, authentic Belgian saisons, this is a solid brew. Refreshing and enjoyable. Another solid offering from Surly."
""
""
"this is a very tasty saison with a nice pepper kick! i was told by a friend who is a lot closer to MN to not bother with this one, and almost listened. since i ended up placing an order form a company that also had it, i figured what the heck - surly hasn't let me down yet, so i picked up a 4-pack. i am not at all disappointed. i think it's a great saison, even though a bit one sided with the pepper kick, it's still very refreshing and very tasty. looking forward to the rest of the cans on hot summer days!"
""
""
""
"A good saison the bubble gum phenols make this one stand out a bit but other wise very much stock saison flavor. A clean good ale and represents the style well. Worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A good basic saison, nothing that sets apart."
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy peach color, with a nice fluffy head. Smell is very yeasty, funky, with a light tropical fruit sweetness. Taste is along the same lines– lots of yeast, plus a bit of pepper and slightly sweet malts. Smooth, crisp, light body; medium carbonation, and dry finish. I was expecting a hoppy ipa style beer, I'll have to start reading the description. But it was a nice surprise."
""
""
"Bready, malty, spicy, hints of banana. Finishes mildly hoppy with lingering bitterness. Flavor profile is quite mild for a saison. Almost as though they blended a full-flavored saison with a pale ale."
""
""
""
"This is a great weird example of the style. Just what you'd expect from Surly."
""
""
"Very tasty and well balanced; light cracker malt, peach and apple, black pepper, bitter grassy hops in the finish, lots of yeasty esters. Light bodied with medium carbonation, very easy drinking and smooth. Fairly dry, quite refreshing. I really enjoyed this surprisingly nuanced saison in a can!"
""
"o: easy drinkin and tasty. just not quite what i look for in a saison."
""
""
""
"Overall it comes off just pretty simple and straightforward but good."
"Definitely not one of the better saisons I have had, and not one I would seek out."
"O: A very good saison, definitely worth seeking out."
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice and drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Poured from can into pint during my travels. Pours a hazy golden yellow with good white head decent lacing that lasts well throughout. Aroma of peaches, grass, cereal grain ,light pepper/herbs, fruity. Typical saison characteristics. Taste grassy, fruity, cereal grain , nice bitterness, peaches, mango, apricot, yeasty, lemon. Medium mouth feel and light carbonation throughout. Overall a nice spring/summer drink from Surly!"
"D-Overall this is an awesome Saison. Im not big on the style.. Ive never had one i thought was bad but this style never excited me. I feel like this is a great session beer. I would like to get this again and might actively seek this out in a trade with some furious of course. If you get a chance try this."

"(164th)"
"O: I would drink this again, but it feels and tastes more like a tripel and is on the sweeter side of my personal preferences."
"A saison in a can!? And it's awesome. Done to almost near perfection. Don't pass this one up, even though I can see it being overshadowed by their hoppy offerings."
"O - This is my first saison/farmhouse ale, and I am really enjoying it. Definetely a style I need to dive heads first in. Hope places around me have similar brews comparable to this. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a refreshing delicous craft brew."
""
""
""
""
"On tap at Old Chicago. Poured honey golden with creamy white foam cap. Nose is fruity and lightly malt as well as yeast. Taste is apples, peaches and peppery with floral notes in a background of biscuit malt. Medium heavy body, holds together well, carbonation imparts a nice crispness. Very enjoyable."
""
""
"Overall, a very good beer that would be a staple in my fridge, if I could get it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""

""
""
"O: Its nice. Surly didn't stray to far from the mold with this one, but it tastes good, its quaffable, and its offered in a great format (pint can = awesomeness). Tastes like a winner."
"Overall; if the carbonation was tighter and more rabid and there was a touch of tartness, this would be a perfect Saison. But, those two key components were lacking and thus it missed the mark for me..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall not bad, similar to most saison farmhouse ales, but a little light is a few categories. Tasty and drinkable, nothing really wrong per se, but not the best representation of the style and nothing that really stands out, and I've been drinking lots of saisons this year."
""
""
""
""
""
"Dr: Very drinkable, but innovative for the style. A unique take on the style that I'd have again. Lovely on draught."
""
""
"O: Very good drinkability: light, with good flavors. A nice accompaniment to food."
""
"Thanks Ryan! Pours a lightly hazed peach with a small white head. Nose is sweet saison yeast, bubblegum, mango, tropical fruits. Mouth is a soft collage of tropical fruits, a pretty agressive Belgian yeast component a-la DuPont, but with a much softer, fruitier mouth. I'm not really a fan of sweeter saisons, but this has some good fruit expression going on."
""
"What is Ryan smoking... this beer is very nice."

"O - Nice beer, not a traditional saison, but a great American take on it. Would drink again."
"O - ""Lively Slovenian hops provide the floral, apricot and peach notes."" That from the bottle--these all do come through, though not with much sweetness. I thought this beer was ok overall. A little funky for me. I'm on the fence between thinking all the flavors come together quite nicely and thinking it was a mess."

"O - A solid all-around beer. Very enjoyable."
"Canned 06SEP11 A: caramel with three fingers of egg whites whipped atop fall in a few minutes to a solid sheet of the same with cobweb lace. Near excellent clarity. (4) S: grainy yeast and peppercorns with slightly sweet oats. The belgian yeast dominates. (3.5) T: Again, yeasty. Classic saison flavors of lemon, pepper, sharp sour yeast flavors. Lasting finish is reminiscent of a slightly underdeveloped apricot. (3.5) M: medium on full bodied with moderately high carbonation and a dry finish. (3) O: Not a bad example, but far from the upper echelon. Won’t be going out of my way for this one. (3.5)"
"O: This is a tasty beer, nothing fancy but it does hit all the right notes. One more reason for a road trip north."
"It's a pretty unique beer in it's own right, but in a very good way It's sweet/spiciness flavor will be off-putting to some, but those looking for a slightly different kind of beer should try this out."
"O- A nice Saison, but doesn't seem to have the high level complexity that I enjoy in other Saisons. I am happy that I still have three cans and probably will hide one away to see how it ages."
"I'm a big fan of farmhouse ales/saisons and I could drink alot of this."
"this beer is very aggressive in coriander flavor. I never been a fan of coriander and this feels over the top to me. the beer itself is light and a bit watery. does not taste like a saison. more of an american version. not impressed Surly makes a great IPA so far nothing else"
"O: I’m really starting to get into this funky farmhouse style, and this had just the right sweetness to keep it drinkable for a newbie like me. Like I said, I would never have put this beer on a list of Top Surly Wants; as it stands, though, I love it! I guess that’s the power of trading – thanks again, Brian!"
"D - Saison in a can! And a damn good one. I'd drink this all the time if I were in Surly territory."
"D: Really easy to drink.  Balanced well and tasty, but is a little less complex than some of my favorite saisons.  This one is certainly good, but doesn't hold up in comparison to many others in the style.  I think I had my hopes up a bit, but was slightly let down."
"O- overall a great everyday saison. Not the best in show nor my favorite of the style, but an appropriately priced saison that would be a mainstay in my fridge but for Surly's limited distribution. Well done on this."
"Overall: I really liked the herbal notes in this one. The bitterness in the finish was a bit much, but I still really liked it. I would have another."
"Mouthfeel is fairly light, but just where it should be in my opinion. There is a good amount of carbonation, about average for the style. Overall, this is a very refreshing beer after a day outside. Makes it very easy to relax and it all goes down so easily and the flavor complexity is great."
"O- A fun take on the style. The plasticy element of the flavors are a detraction for me, but it is pleasantly complex. Worth a shot."
"Nice extra from mnbearsfan! Poured into a pint glass, golden, clear, typical Surly carbonation, not spectacular but good looking. The aromas are familiar, some farmhouse aroma, a little ester-y, banana, some clove and spice and faintly hoppy. A very pleasant experience for my nose. The flavor is rather nice. It is round and soft, it is fruity, slightly musty, and has some bubblegum, banana and clove. Very yeast driven flavors with some hop bitterness and flavor, citrus flavor. Dry, but sadly just not dry enough for the style. A good beer for sure, but it is such a hard style and a saturated style too. I'd seek it out again, and soon."
"overall what a wonderful beer. It is a great beer year round. I wouldnt pass this one up. its a great beer for baking beer bread or beer cheese soup."
"D - this seemed different than most saisons I have tried. More fruity and less Saisony. Worth a shot, but I will go for some other Surly offering next time."
"Not a bad beer, but not a must have."
"In the end, it's really a boring Saison. Maybe having several Stillwater Saison's has ruined me. Either way, for as long as this has been a want, I'm left unsatisfied."
"I have to say, a canned saison is something I’ve never experienced before. CynicAle’s an interesting brew that makes use of a myriad of international ingredients. Very drinkable and refreshing."
"O - Sessionable Saison in a can? Yes, please! Great Summertime beer, I'd very much like a steady supply of this!"
"O - Overall this is my favorite of the Surly year-round lineup. Great flavor profile and creamy mouthfeel. I'll get this whenever I can."
"O: A saison that can both be sessioned or sipped and decoded through savoring. For a saison that comes in 4 pack cans, this is damned good."
"Light bodied with a decent about of prickly carbonation, just enough to help keep the beer crisp and refreshing. Very easy to drink, solid beer overall."
"From appearance to mouth feel, CynicAle is in my opinion a standout beer in its style. It has a ridiculously awesome look and creaminess about it that remains unseen in many Saisons. The flavors aren't overpowering nor too subtle to remain hoping for me. Simply put, the balance of all components of this beer are really wonderful."
"Overall-Crisp and Refreshing under 7% Saison. Not too filling and easy to drink. Definitely one of my favorites for the style and surly is yet to dissapoint."
"Overall- This is a decent Saison. I like the use of oats, but the huge yeast phenolics keep this beer from realizing its full potential. I would definitely drink this again, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."
"O: This beer is goes down very easily due to the lack of dryness and strong spicy flavors. I would have no problem having more than one of these on a hot summer day; the beer actually seems to be somewhat thirst quenching."
"This is a really nice beer. I love what Surly is doing and have achieved with this saison in a can. The spicy flavours work really well with the malt and fruit."
"O – Bready side of the style."
"(O) It's a different take on a Saison. It's quite good. The pepper was a bit surprising. It has the spiciness and overall refreshing quality. There's just something a bit different to this one."
"o - liked this one a lot, another fine offering from surly."
"Or maybe I'm just being cynical and should go back to eating ice cream."
"O- The more I got into it, the more I enjoyed it. Very well made."
"Overall, this was a good beer in general, but weak sauce for the style. In fact, when I first smelled and tasted it I thought it was a bitter with a little yeasty spice, only to find out that it's categorized as a saison."
"Overall: The blast of pepper is difficult for me to overcome, or at least, difficult for me to overcome and give it a rockstar rating. I like this beer and appreciate the different components, but it is not my favorite."
"O: Goes down easy, tasty, not too filling, mild kick, nice representation of style. This is another fantastic offering from Surly. I seriously love this brewery."
"O: I really like this brew. It's grown on me after a few tastings, and I think it's an excellent example of the style."
"Overall - a delicious beer. Not an astounding example of the farmhouse style, but something I will continue to purchase."
"Overall: a good beer, but maybe not to style for a saison--saison on roids would be closer, but that's the direction of Surly. Not my favorite of the Surly beers but an excellent beer nonetheless."
"Overall- Very good drinkable beer, not quite worth all of the fuss that I have heard about it. But I would drink it again."
"Mmmm, hits most of the right spots for a saison; grainy, grassy and bready. This is the best American-brewed saison I have ever had! It is missing some farmhouse that I find so appealing in a Saison DuPont, and of course to a greater degree Fantome, but damn....this is as close as you can get without going open fermentation here in the states. Surly has cranked out some of the best beers I have had, and deserve to be ranked amongst the elite brewers in America. Most impressive, young jedi."
"O- Good example of the style. This isn't on the level of DuPont or anything like that, but if given the chance I would buy this over and over. Very pleasing and well rounded with a lot of complexity- just how I love my saisons..."
"Overall a decent example of the style but a bit of work to do to take this into the territory occupied by the best."
"Slightly hoppy, a little grapefruit, easy drinking. This beer is highly drinkable and could lead to trouble as the ABV is a little high for a session."
"Pours a lightly hazed gold color with faint orange touches, big frothy bubbly head, long lasting. Scent is bold fresh baked bread, yeasty with herb and peppery spice notes, touches of light watery floral fruit peeks through. Taste is a big punch of yeast and spice, as tongue adjusts the notes of grain, herbs, watery fruit, flower poke through. Only thing missing is the earthy and funky notes i prefer in the style - in the end it compares in profile to some other belgian styles. Body is tremendously creamy for the style with faint graininess, active carbonation subsides quickly - maybe a bit too quickly, dry and lingering pepper and yeast notes. Very nice beer - bold with some original qualities."
"O: A really nice brew that I think treads the line between saison and Belgian pale ale -- it has the fruity, lightly funky character of both styles with a tiny bit of peppery flavor to push it a little more toward saison. But, all in all, this is an excellent beer and I think the best of the Surly lineup."
"mouthfeel - strange for a farmhouse again, light, crisp, medium body, drinkable thats for sure"
"Overall, this is a great Saison for coming out of a can... But it finishes too strong on the peppery spice for me. It isn't bad, but not one I see myself drinking very much."
"O: Initially, the nose gave me reservations, but this one turned out to be absolutely fantastic! It's great to finally sample one of my favorite styles brewed by one of my favorite breweries!"
"O- an interesting saison and will certainly be returning to this one and it's in a can!"
"o: I could have 10 of these in a row based solely on the feel and how easily it would quench my thirst. The tartness is mild and welcome, though I think I could only take down about 2 of these before wanting something with more flavor to it. A good way to stay cool on a hot summer day, but lacks that pop from the spices despite a nice rich flavor from the tart fruits inside."
"Pours a clear light orange-yellow with a 1 inch off-white head that fades to a thin cap. Random chunks of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smells of grains, spices, and Belgian yeast. Taste is exactly like the smell with the Belgian yeast taking prominence and the grain and spice flavors coming through on the finish. Reading the can I see that the hops are supposed to impart apricot/peach flavors and I do get them if I search for it. Beer has a good level of carbonation but seems a tiny bit flat. Very smooth in the mouth. Overall, this is a good beer from Surly but not one of my favorite styles. I am glad I got to try this one."
"Poured into my surly pint glass courtesy of theduderules. Pours a apple juice color with a little head that dissipates almost instantly. The aroma is great, Belgian yeast, fruity and a little funk. Taste is amazing, everything from the nose only intensified and a peppery finish. Mouthfeel is nice, smooth with moderate carbonation. This is a great saison, if I lived in surly land, this would be a regular in my rotation."
"Side note, do not eat with korean food or very flavorful meats haha. Had the first half as I was cooking it was going fine but then I drank the rest with my meal and it went downhill. The food killed the taste and it started tasting a lil watery. Wouldn't really accompany this with any food IMO, maybe some light cheese"
"The mouthfeel is fuller and more lucious than most Saisons I have had recently. The carbonation also is not as in your face like most tradional Belgian examples yet still finishes crisp and on the dryer side. Overall this is a nice American interpretation of the style, which I prefer to the traditional examples but that is personal preference. Highly recommended for lovers of this style of which I am not, but this may make me one."
"I'm very impressed yet again by Surly. I'm looking forward to having the rest of the four pack at a barbecue tomorrow."
"Overall very good farmhouse ale, a lot of great flavor, funk, and carbonation make for a very enjoyable beer."
"O- this is a great beer on a warm summer day with much more flavor than a beer that swill drinkers would want. Maybe a good beer for someone to start trying micro brews."
"O: Overall, I am glad I tried this beer. I do know it's not a style of beer I usually go for but can appreciate the appearance and the fruity smooth taste of this beer. I would recommend it to a person who likes this type of beer for sure."
"o: I am beginning to love saisons. I have had this a couple times and it is enjoyable and easy to drink. Very complex beer that I could sip on for a while. Surly makes me wish I lived in Minnesota sometime."
"O ~ Pretty good. Not had a bad brew from Surly, this was no different."
"O: A great tasting well made beer but I prefer other saisons to this one. Won't mind having it around for regular consumption though :)"
"Pours clear golden color with a big fluffy head. As the can says it is a yellow fizzy beer, well not really but it is golden and fluffy. Didn't get much smell off this one. Not trying to be lazy, but smells like a saison beer with no overwhelming scents coming through. Taste is much better than the smell. Some great sweet fruitiness with some spice and yeast in the mix, with a little funky flavor. Mouth is all about the carbonation which is quite nice. Overall a very good beer."
"O: This is a different but nice and easy drinking saison; a great beer for the summer but I wouldn't necessarily put just one season on this guy: I could drink this any time; nice work again Surly"
"D - Very drinkable. The flavors are really nicely balanced. A nice American take on the saison style. The flavors are all there and could have been just a touch stronger."
"A light, refreshing Belgian lemony and nice. Good spice and balanced. Great mouthfeel. A nice beer. My scores will reflect this can."
"O- What can I say another solid beer from Surly, I feel like this one is a little under rated, very refreshing, quality saison."
"Another beer that seems to benefit from some homerism. Totally lacking in complexity, barely made up for in its simplicity and drinkability."
"Notes of sweet stone fruit emit. I pick up some cut grass mixed in there as well. Farmhouse funk, but not overly. Light and refreshing is my overall impression. Fizzy is best way to describe the carbonation. Peach and black pepper are here and they play well together. This beer is very light and easy drinking to me. This 16oz four pack is goin down to China Town. A great summertime brew."
"O-> I liked this beer, I really did. It is very good representation of the style and brings a lot to the table in the way of flavor. Not sure if being in the can for 5 or 6 weeks (whichever it actually is) had any effect on the aromas or the taste, but I certainly expected more in the aroma department from Surly. That being said, the taste of this brew more than made up for the smell. Chalk up another success for Surly Brewing!"
"D: Cynicale feels a bit too symplistic for the style, but I think what it lacks in complexity it makes up for in drinkability."
"o - to me the benchmark on a saison is hennepin and this beer did a nice job of capturing a lot of what i like in that beer. probably should've drank this one a bit fresher since the canned on date is about 3 months ago, but i am still a big fan of the flavor and the beer in general. i wonder if the flavors would be more pronounced or what the beer has lost over time, but it is quite tasty and enjoyable. another winner from surly."
"Pours a hazy golden yellow with a thick foamy white head. Head settles into about a 1/4 inch thick and persists throughout. Aroma is pretty spot on for the style; yeast spice, lemon zest, apples & apricots, some horseblanket funk. Pale, grainy malts in the nose as well. Flavor follows the nose; grainy & bready, slightly funky, bright & fruity. Finishes with a peppery, yeasty funk. Can't get enough of this brewery (and this beer). Well put-together saision."
"O: Pretty good, if the flavors were a bit bolder I would have liked it a lot more, but they seemed slightly weak. A solid brew I would love to drink on a hot day hanging out with friends, good for BBQs and horseshoes."
"For those of you that like to play around with blending beers-try blending Cynic with Bender-it's awesome."
"D/O- One of the better saisons I've had for sure. This would be a great beer after dinner on a warm summer night. Another hit from Surly."
"O. Overall pretty good beer. Not my favorite saison, but this holds its own. Lacks some of the complexity and flavor of some of my personal favorites. Nice summer beer."
"The CPJ"
"Medium body, higher carbonation, refreshing and invigorating on the senses. Drinks nice, solid balance between fruit and spice, and the hop profile makes this something I'd drink often during warmer weather."
"Overall: A very good interpretation of a Belgian ale."
"O - If I find this again, it's a buy for sure."
"O: Not a bad saison, but not great, either. The body is a bit weak and the flavors somewhat bland."
"D- wow! This is the most drinkable saison I have ever had! Fantastic flavor is met with a refreshing tasting! The brew is so full of livliness and flavor. Wow! Props to surly!!!!"
"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, but suddenly gets thin and crisp midway through each sip - it happens to be a good thing in my opinion. Slight chalk during the yeasty portions kind of intrudes on both separate mouthfeels, but is nice by itself. Drinkability is helped by the change from the nose to the taste, as lighter fruits make for an easier drinker."
"From a can into glass, just like they told me to do. Pour results in a full bone-colored head topping a clear, golden-colored beer with active carbonation. The aroma is of oats and yeast. Complex and spicy at the outset, it mellows beautifully with each drink. It's pretty aggressive for a Saison, though I did enjoy it with my meal. It's smooth and eminently drinkable. Overall, if you're not looking for the subtle Saison, you would be very happy to have it as a table beer."
"Overall a nice Belgian choice. I'm not a Belgian purist or expert but this is a tasty rendition of the style and is very appealing on the nose and in the mouth. Maybe not the best but definitely good"
"I hate to be harsh, but the Americanized hoppy saison just doesn't work for me, it's a clash of flavors that just tastes like a mess."
"O - this doesn't taste like a saison really. Smells like one, but taste is definitely an American take with Belgian yeast. It really works well though. I've seen and tasted plenty of failures in trying new takes. This is not one of them. A must try!"
"Overall this is a lovely beer indeed and I'd happily pick up a sixer if it was available in my area. I love that it's in 16 oz cans too."
"I find this beer good, but rather unremarkable. I like the spicy aroma, but the flavor is a let-down. That's a first for me with Surly. It tastes good, but there's just not a whole lot to it."
"D - As with all Surly, easily drinkable and love the cans, just think there are better Surlys out there to enjoy."
"Drinkability is moderately high. Not my favorite saison, but the flavors are pleasant and the alcohol is hidden well. Honestly, this is probably the only saison I know of that's canned, so for hot summer days on the beach this would be a nice can to pack in the cooler for those locales that don't approve of bottles."
"Not my favorite saison of all time but a pretty solid beer. 6.7% ABV? Yeaaa, right... seems no more than 5% until you drink a pint of it. I love the idea of saison in a can, this would make a phenomenal beach beer. It would definitely be a summer staple in my fridge if it wasn't so damn hard to come by outside of Minnesota."
"I realized a little more than halfway into this one that I should have poured it harder, as it's gassy to the point where it's difficult to drink. After a few good swirls in my glass, it was less prickly and easier to drink."
"D: A really solid saison that I could easily drink over and over again. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and if you like saisons then you should too. Thanks again Chris!"
"D. Very good example of a saison that I enjoyed quite a lot."
"Pours a golden yellow with tons of whit frothy head. Geat head retension and beautiful lacing. Smells peppery and floral. A nice light malt profile with lots of yeasty smells. Tastes sweet and malty. Pepper hits hard and the floral flavours meld well. Good mouthfeel and very drinkable"
"Cheers!"
"On the other hand, that lightness, combined with a pleasant mouthfeel and some lively carbonation, makes for a very drinkable brew."
"D: Really good. I could have a few cans. The 6.7% alcohol isn't even noticeable."
"D - A highly drinkable beer that is very refreshing and enjoyable."
"Drinkability is very good. Great idea to can a farmhouse, this is an excellent cross-over to craft ales for a macro lager drinker. I'm ready for summer BBQ season now!"
"Pours a slight hazy blonde with a small tight head. The aroma is fruity and spicy with some peach and citrus. Flavor is good and spicy with some earthy hops and some citrus, overall it is quite dry. This is one of the more Americanized saisons I have had. Not that that makes it any less tasty, it's just pretty gosh darned domesticated."
"A really nice saison. One of the few beers where the discription on the can nearly perfectly matches what you actually taste. Its not a dupont, nor is there anythinf remotely aproaching anything wild in this beer. Its just a really nice, if slightly diferent example."
"D- its all right not the best of the style or from this brewery."
"Color is wonderful--an amber-hued pale yellow number, almost like a color you'd see on a 1975 Lincoln Continental. Thankfully, the can has far less metal than the car. But the beer will take you much further..."
"Reasonable. It feels like a good standard. Probably more of a summer beer. Not my favorite from this brewery, but it still lands on solid ground in it's style. I'd like to see a lower ABV though I think."
"I like Surly. Come to TN...please."
"D - Drinks clean and quickly, with just a tiny bit of lingering sweet orange and coriander."
"D- This was the last of my Surly cans. I wasnt as excited for it as I was for Coffee Bender and the rest. I guess the middle of January isnt the saison. *rimshot* This turned out to be a stellar beer that I wish I had more of."
"D: A decent beer, but certainly not my favorite from Surly. Sort of Surly's interpretation of an everyday drinker. I didn't realize this one was categorized as a Saison until I looked up the review and, I'm more than a bit surprised as this beer simply doesn't remind me of what a Saison should be."
"Drink- I am amazed this came out of a can. I am very happy I have four of them."
"The taste is pretty similar to the smell but with the yeasty flavor more upfront. Once it warmed a bit, I also picked up some pepper, an ever so slight amount of alcohol on the finish. That being said, I could drink this beer all night. (...and considering how good it is, given the chance, I would!)"
"Surly is pretty well known for their hop-bomb Furious, so this is pretty different from what I have had from them (bender, furious, smoke) but it brings a roundness to their beer offerings. I normally like a dark beer or IPA, but if anyone wanted a sweeter easy drinker I would probably recommend this one."
"Thanks to brewnic for this one. I poured from a 16 ounce can into a snifter. The pour is hazy orange with a fizzy little white head. The aroma is spicy, citrusy, even some peaches. The beer is spicy and zesty. It has a very drying, sharp finish. The beer is light and well carbonated. A damn fine saison, very glad to have tried it."
"D: Amazing. Surly does it again and again. Really good."
"This beer pours a yellow color, with a white head. The aroma is amazing, it has a lot going on. Hints of clove, hints of banana, a little band aid, bubble gum. There is a lot going on in the aroma, it makes it a very fun beer. The taste is very complex as well. It is sweet, bready, bubblegum, slight banana flavor. It is a very complex delicious taste! The mouthfeel is light, and at the same time the flavors and aroma that come out of this beer are so complex. This is a very good beer!"
"Drank out of mug. It had a 1 finger white head, and was the color of honey. Had a nice ale/hops/citrus aroma. The carbonation was low-medium. It tastes like a good ale, nothing outstanding, just a good brew. It is a very drinkable beer, with a slight hop/bitter taste on the end."
"D: Great beer. Very easy to drink. Crisp and refreshing, ideal for summer."
"Medium bodied with hints of honey, floral notes, light crisp fruit such as apple, pear apricot and peach. Slightly spicy with hints of pepper and lemon zest as well as a subtle hop presence and a nice malt backbone. Dry finish. The flavor of this beer was surprising considering how unimpressive the appearance and nose were but I would pass on this one again."
"By far my favorite Saison so far. I have a couple others in the fridge that I'm even more excited to try now. CynicAle is very good in the flavor department, but not quite as refreshing as I expected because it isn't as dry as I expected. This does not diminish the other excellent qualities this beer possesses."
"Poured from the can into a shaped pint glass with a golden/honey colored body with a finger of white light head that fades and leaves a little lacing in the glass. Smells of grass, citrus, barnyard and typical Belgian spice. Taste is lemony and spicy right away. Nectarines, golden delicious apples and sugar come in to play. A bready yeast with clove and coriander fade to horse blanket, which rounds out the flavors. Feels light and crisp with the medium to high carbonation I'd expect. Light in booze and big on flavor, this may have just edged out my previous favorite of Hennepin!"
"Drinkability is great, dryness combined with the flavor make this a super drinkable beer."
"Drinkability: Recommended. Perhaps a skosh fruitier and sweeter than most, but overall a rather tasty beer and a very enjoyable saison from Surly. Darkness is a fine treat now and again, but, I think I'd prefer to have this one on a regular basis."
"Overall- This is an old can, has over 1.5 years on it, Saisons hold up well, but the flavor is fairly muted. I really wanted to try this one, and it is good overall. I need to try this again fresh and re-review when it is released!"
"I was a little heavy-handed on the Crack & Glug and nearly caused it to foam over the lip of the glass. The good thing was that it netted me two fingers of eggshell-white head with decent retention. Color was a golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. I definitely got the peach and apricot notes. I reversed the order from the notes on the CAN because it seemed peachy up front with the apricot a lighter scent. I was reminded of O'Fallon's Wheach, actually. Mouthfeel was medium with a riot of flavors in the mouth and on the tongue. The honey flavor was immediate, followed by a fruity mix and then the black pepper kicked in, especially on the finish. Wow! What a wild ride! Omar & Co. need not worry about Greg Koch & Co. taking them to task for making ""a fizzy yellow beer"" because this was NOT for sissies. Hell, whoops - different Surly beer, I would intermingle this at the top of the cooler with Wheach and let the honey bees swarm."
"Bravo!"
"O: Typical solid offering from Surly. Not my favorite saison, but definitely gets the job done."
"Mouthfeel is good. I could drink this one all day. Especially during a hot summer day. Really impressive mix of flavors."
"Drinkability is pretty good, something I'd have to be in the mood for but if I were this would definitely go down easy."
"M/D - Mouthfeel was full, rich, creamy and smooth. This was a very drinkable beer that I wish I could get regularly!"
"I'm going to go out on a limb and say this is the best Belgian-style beer I've had out of a can. I've yet to be disappointed by Surly."
"Very drinkable and fairly enjoyable. Everything was spot on but I am slightly disappointed with the flavor, while it was good I expected more. This is still one I would pick up every now and again if it were available to me. Huge thanks to Eric, gratefulbeerhead, for giving me the opportunity to enjoy this beer."
"The flavor is a little less vibrant in the nose, but it is still a pleasure to drink. There's a nice pie crust malt flavor and a dry, somewhat bitter finish. Mouthfeel isn't as great as most other saisons I've had, but it fits the style and doesn't hurt it at all. Drinkability is excellent. This version seems a little more restrained than most Saisons, but that helps in some aspects. I'm suprised at how quick the 16 oz. can went. Another great Surly."
"D: Extremely session-able beer. Very easy drinking, I'm glad this is a year round offering from Surly."
"D: pretty darn good. I can sometimes prefer a more earthy/musty saison but this is very good."
"D-A wonderfully flavourful and easy to enjoy brew. Out of a cooler from a can at a summer BBQ or fall football tailgate this beer packs a lot of punch! Delicious!"
"The taste impressed me a bit more, with a nice balance of yeast flavors, surprising malt crackery note and delicate hop character leading to a nice slightly yeasty, dry finish. The mouthfeel was very nice with a great substance, a little more body than some saisons, but it worked here and still maintained a crisp carbonation and good finish. I liked this beer and though it wasn't particularly aggressive, it was well balanced and I could see picking it up again locally if it were available."
"M/D: Beer is thick/heavy in the mouth but also smooth. Besides the fact that it has a relatively high ABV and the heavieness may fill you up, it is a great session beer. However, I find that it is only really enjoyable in the summer."
"I was cynical about how good this could be even though I am a huge fan of the brewery. I was wrong... This beer is NOT a let down. In fact, I think it nails the style dead on and retains some soul and personality. Burnt gold with a white head that holds and leaves nice ace. Nose is... Wow- the french barley is really nice. Very husky and mildly toasty with a touch of whole wheat-like sweetness, but delicate at the same time. For those looking for funk, this isn't the one, but the mixture here really paints a picture of a sunny farmhouse lot; the hops adding some serious flower and fruit (mainly peach, but apricot and plucot too?), and the yeast adds a very subtle (and much less peppery than some) spiciness. it is so well balanced, it seems like the smell might be peach blossomy, but it's not, it's peach and wildflowers and earthiness and the seperate flavors are distinct yet not muddy at all. Really a great american saison, and like I said, nails it for the style. He must have read phil's book. Surly is creating some of America's best beers for sure. Keep up the good work!!"
"This doesn't feel quite like a saison, but it doesn't seem like Surly set out to create an authentic farmhouse ale. Characteristics of Saison, Biere de Garde, Belgian Pale, and Czech Pilsner are present. It is a hybrid that ends up being pretty unique. Craft in a can always makes me happy. Glad I had the opportunity to try this one. Many thanks to chixdighops for hookin' me up!"
"d- personally this doesn't perfectly click with my palate, but I would definitely reach for this on occasion. you have to give credit to a brewery having an affordable year-round belgian style ale. plus the can adds some style points."
"I can use a bit more carbonation here. The feel is good, light and direct, but it's a bit filmy on the end. Some bubbles could help dry this out just a tad to get a crisper feel, and keep the aftertaste minimal or fresher feeling."
"D - Excellent drinkability. A ton of flavor but yet very dry, very clean, very refreshing."
"Cynic is good, but nothing mind-blowing. Surly makes so many great beers, with many being among my favorites of the style. This is not one of them, but it's worth trying if you're a fan of saisons."
"Not my favorite style, but a great example of the style nonetheless."
"- Overall a good Belgian.. hits the style very well."
"Almost like a mini Belgian golden ale. Was pretty happy with this one and lamented being done with it."
"D: Easy drinking, crisp and refreshing. Solid for the style. Would definitely drink again"
"Thanks Connor for getting me Surly. Poured into a standard pint it pours a clear gold color and when standing next to Hell it appears about a half shade darker. There's a soft, fluffy thin head on top with lacing that slides slowly. It smells of sweet citrusy hops, fruits and Belgian yeast. Has an earthy taste but I first noted the spiced, peppery taste from the yeast. It's got a light malty sweetness but strong citrusy flavors. This lighter-bodied beer is actively carbonated and gives that drying alcohol sensation in the back. Like beer, drink more."
"D-this is a decent brew, interesting crusted bread flavor, not a ton of typical saison characteristics. tons of carbonation."
"(D)- A solid saison that fits the style well. Crisp and refreshing too. I like the grassy and spice note within the funk. A solid brew."
"D - Pretty drinkable brew, not one of my favorites from Surly but still a good brew none the less. I recommend trying it even if you not into the style"
"d- for a fraction of fantome's cost, why not? An excellent saison overall, especially for an American that is available year-round, (if you're in the twin cities). try it!"
"Drinkabilty - Not a bad Saison, I think that it could have benifited from either a little more hoppy flavors in the aftertaste... or a little more fruit throughout."
"Poured from a 16oz. can into a Becker glass. Pours a slightly hazey pale golden color with good carbonation that produces a nice soapy head. Can smell some lemon, pepper, and peach with some cereal notes. Very nice aroma from the yeast. Taste some lemon and pepper with some honey. Meduim body mouthfeel with a sharp bitterness. A very nice drinkable saison that I really enjoy."
"D - very refreshing, yummy, and drinkable. this one really grew on me about halfway through. saison in a can? wish i had more."
"D- Very nice and very easy to drink this beer. As stated above I enjoyed the balance of malt/funk/citrus in this beer. Glad that I have been able to try all of these Surly beers, I now know what I have been missing."
"D - Pretty tasty. I could see myself doing a few."
"Drinkability: A very tasty and drinkable saison. It has some simple but good flavors, and isn't intense enough in any category to take away from its sessionability. I'm really enjoying this, and I look forward to the next time I get to try it. Thanks Kevin!"
"I have been saving this beer for awhile now and once I decided to raid my cellar I wanted to give this one a try. This is a good tasting beer and is the second Surly offering I have had and their stuff has been up to par so far."
"Drinkability -- Not my favorite saison, but certainly a solid offering from Surly. There is very little chance that you will find a better saison in a can!"
"Notes: I really enjoyed this saison and I woudl definitely buy this one again. At $10 a 4pack its a bit steep (obviously not by much) but it is refreshing enough and complex enough to keep me coming back."
"Hazy, golden color to it. Moderate aroma-somewhat fruity and yeasty. Almost wet hay smelling. Crisp, wheat flavor. Mild spicyness to it. Yeasty and somewhat clovey-comes off like a low level hefe to me. Very solid hop biterness. Solid mouthfeel. A bit sweet and sticky in the finish. Enjoyable beer-bring on a hot day for this one."
"Overall, a very enjoyable drinkable saison. Good buy."
"D: Saison's really aren't my thing but with that being said, CynicAle is really quite solid. Not that I'd expect anything less from Surly. Great mouthfeel and complexity though a little bit dull at points. Flavors are muted to a point due to the odd heaviness of this one. Seek this one out if you're not really into Saisons. It might change your mind!"
"D - If this beer were about 2% to 3% ABV lighter, I could drink this all night. Maybe I'm just getting too used to some of the cleaner American hop varieties, but I felt the bitterness was a little rough on this beer. Still, I think it's a beer that you should get if you can get your hands on it."
"D: this is a great saison. Saison is one style that I have trouble enjoying, but I think this one is nicely done and features a lot of unique flavors with good balance."
"pours a mostly clear golden color with a small head in comparison to most saisons ..the smell is classic with that belgium yeast with honey and pepper notes then some clove and bananas..the taste is citrus and honey and pepper with a nice clove bite with some oats and barley this is really delicious,,it has lots of flavors but its all balanced out at the end..a pleasure for the taste buds..the mouth fell is medium but with lots of carbonation and crispness..this is very well done ..but no surprise her it say SURLY on the can"
"A very nice and smooth beer, but the long lasting sweetness and weight hurt the beer's body in the end. Thanks Chicksdighops!"
"Simply amazing that this much complexity came out of a CAN! I CAN't believe it. I never expected anything like this! As much flavor if not more then some of the best Belgians."
"Overall a pretty good beer, and anything decent from a can is awesome to me! Drinks more like a Belgian pale than what you would expect from a Saison, but still good nonetheless..."
"D- Pretty drinkable, each sip left me wanting more but 16 oz. was plenty. Very pleased with this beer as I have been with every other Surly beer. Surly is slowly creeping it's way up as my favorite brewery."
"D- Surly makes yet another amazing beer. This seems to be the norm with Surly though. I will be on the lookout for more of this beer. Damn...please for the love of God come to Indiana!"
"I had one of these from a can at the Bedlam Theater, and it kind of blew me away. Fantastic drinkability, going hand-in-hand with a sharp, bite-you-in-the-ass kind of flavor. I've only had two beers from Surly, and they've both seemed like ""regular"" beer, but this one's on the good side of regular. Don't hesitate to pay $5.00 for a can of this guy."
"Good drinkability, good saison."
"Overall, a very nice beer, one worth seeking out. I know I'll be getting more."
"Thanks to BDlbrewster for hooking me up with Surly goodness. Poured from a can into my Duvel tulip. Pours a nice burnt orange color, a little bit darker than I usually expect from a saison. A nice sized, slightly off white head forms and lingers for a minute before largely disappearing and leaving behind a disappointing lack of lacing. The smell is a wonderful blend of biscuity malts and yeast goodness. A few sips bring a taste that largely mirrors the nose, with a little bit of a lingering hop bitterness that seems out of place. The mouthfeel is probably the highlight of this beer, there's the normally slightly prickly carbonation I find in a saison, but there's also a creaminess that takes it to another level. I can't say it's my favorite saison (that would be fresh Jack D'or), but CynicAle is a damn good beer."
"D - Surly is awesome; they are easily one of the most underrated brewers in the game. And this brew is definitely worthy of the brand bestowed upon the can."
"Overall, very drinkable and interesting brew. Surly is always somewhat unique as they don't seem to be beholden to style constraints, I could see some people really loving the beer, personally, I enjoy it but think it might be a bit overpriced."
"3.5 D: I heard that there is a lot of variability with this brew. I think I got one of the duller ones. Good, but not great."
"Very good drinkability. Alcohol well hidden."
"D: Who would have thought, a Saison in a can? A nice beer, perhaps a bit sweet for me, but still a pretty good (American) example of the style."
"D: I've always wanted to try a regular Surly beer and this one did not disappoint. A stand out effort."
"SkÅL!"
"Overall, not your typical saison to me but it was a nice change of pace that was funto drink."
"16 ounce can poured into a Unibroue tulip. Never thought in my life I would be pouring a saison out of a can. Totally strange. Thank you kindly to kbutler1, for trekking some Surly cans across the country for me. 1 inch of pillowy white head lingers on a blonde/golden body leaving some soapy lacing. Aroma is spicy, fruity, hoppy and refreshing. Taste is of apples, apricots, sunshine and a touch of funk. Actually leans more towards a Belgian saison versus and American one. Really, really hard to believe that these flavors are coming out of an American CAN. Wow."
"Not the strongest effort from Surly here but this still possessed enough flavor and smooth drinkibility to keep me entertained during the duration of this can. This would be a good one to crack when the weather gets a little warmer."
"Haven't had many other Saison style beers to compare this to, but well balanced and enjoyable. A good exploit of yeast characters. Would definitely enjoy this beer again."
"Pours a nice orange/yellow with a nice 1 inch head that settles down quite nicely. Aroma is of belgian yeast, lightly roasted malts, subtle spice & fruit. The flavor is very smmoth for a Surly, no in your face hops, but a nice smooth beer that is very easy to drink. Nicely done. The mouthfeel is light/medium. Very drinkable. For me, it's a great summer time beer as well as I nice break from the heavier RIS I have been drinking lately."
"Don't think I have had a Saison before. Very interesting. The taste is not quite my thing, but still very good. Everything else is great in this beer."
"Drinkability: Solid enough with nice flavors -- I think if it came out of a bottle the the head may have had a different appearance that would be a little closer to style, but beyond that, it's spot on. I would gladly stock up on this if it was local."
"There is a nice light hoppy taste with a lingering bitterness. A nice little bite in the background of some sort of spiciness I cannot describe. Very, very good."
" CynicAle is light to medium-bodied, but full-flavored. The finish is silky and long-lasting as well. It's a great American twist on the style. Complex, but very easy to drink."
"Pours a hazy golden straw color with a white head. The aroma is bananas and cloves, not what I was expecting but still nice. The flavor is bananas with some spices and maybe the slightest bit of funk. There are some other flavors in there, possibly orange and bubble gum. Medium mouthfeel. This is much more like a hefeweizen or dunkel weizen, but still a very good beer."
"Thanks man!"
"Driz, you're a good man, despite what 2tal says about ya. : )"
"d - Overall this is an above average ale that is very easy to drink. It has a strong yeast taste to it and also a little citrus. Not my favorite Surly product but I would definitely drink again."
"D - The relatively low ABV makes this a pretty quaffable beverage if you don't mind the spicy nature of this brew. As always, Surly has yet to let me down."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate to above average carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's tasty and easy drinking. The only thing that would stop me from having more of this is it isn't one of my favorite styles. Like most things Surly does though this is a very good beer."
"3.5/4/4.5/4/4.5"
"D - Easy to drink, and pleasant enough, but it's not really making me crave more."
"I've loved all of the previous Surly beers I've had, so had some high hopes for this one, especially since I love saisons too. A good beer, and worth giving a try, but I have to say I am a bit underwhelmed by this one."
"Overall a very nice beer. The best Saison ever to come froma can for sure."
"D - This is a great beer. Amazing to find a great saison in a can."
"Pours a rich orange with a high white head, some lacing down the glass. The smell is white pepper, stone fruit, jasmine, well water. The taste is sweet black plum, mild malts, raw barley, wet-hay funk, pepper in the finish. The bubbles are fine and the consistency is only a little thick -- more suited for fall than summer, maybe. It's quite enjoyable -- one of the better American attempts at the style -- and goes down slow and easy. Another good one from Surly."
"D - This beer is fantastic, I cannot believe I Surly continues to make such great beers, the can thing is something I can get on board with, they have all been great"
"Furious is one of the best beers I've had but recently Bender and Cynicale have turned me off slightly from this brewery though there not bad brews, they are just average and a bit watery."
"a decent saison that is very light and very easy to drink. very light funk for anyone wanting to try a lighter saison."
"D - Well if I was looking for this style would have again might go easier to have belgain ale that this reminded me of altough good it didn't blow me away."
"D - A god lighter beer with nice components giving it some good flavor. If it wasn't for the brilliant clarity and color though, it would be good looking at all. A nice and drinkable offering from Surly."
"Not one I'd trade for again, but big ups to GoldenJet for the trade!"
"Overall: Not that much to say really. American style saison."
"drinkability: nice"
"Really a great beer (can or not) and definately one to seek out. Yet another reason to wish I lived in the twin cities!"
"Looking forward to having this in cans at Bonnaroo next summer!!"
"Makes me think of a hoppy belgian witbier, minus the wheat."
"This beer had serious potential-hence the belief it was bad or outdated. If the head retained much longer and left lace, and the mouthfeel was crisp, dry and carbonated sufficiently-the whole beer would score better. As it was- a major letdown after reading many of the well received reviews here."
"Mouthfeel is moderate, beer is a little thicker than I expected but its still pretty good. Drinkability is moderate, that aftertaste really damages this beer."
"D: Drinkable as all hell, and very interesting."
"Drinkability: I've had this thing quite a few times now, and I'm really beginning to enjoy it. I really enjoy the subtle spicyness of this easy drinking brew with just enough body to be savored."
"Poured a deep orange color with good carbonation but no head to speak of. Nose is pepper, belgian yeast, malty and chewy. Taste is malty, chewy,belgian yeast, pepper, some fruits. Mouthfeel is very full and nice with a peppery backlash and big malty presence. Drinkability os damn good!"
"Poured into my pint glass. Pours a dark, hazy orange with a small ivory-colored head on top. Leaves very little lace. Smells of tart apples, apricots, pineapple, and spices. The mouth is crisp, but with a bit of subtle creaminess on the finish. I like that. This is a hop-forward Saison for sure. Nice bitter earthy hops at the forefront, plenty of fruity funk in there as well, and finishes with a touch of black pepper spiciness. This is really good. Wow. This isn't one of my favorite styles, but this may become one of my favorite beers. Well done, Surly."
"D: A little bit much to be too drinkable, but the complexity brought me back for more."
"D: It drinks a bit more like a belgian pale, but sure does go down smooth and easy. Another triumph for Surly"
"A highly drinkable, highly sessionable saison."
"Overall a very solid and interesting saison from Surly who never seem to disappoint."
"Sprightly carbonation that is not overdone, full gamut of flavors and smells, nice cheek-drying but not puckering finish - refreshing all around. If I had access to Surly this would likely be my summer drinker of choice. An absolute delight - thanks a ton for leaving me this one Eric!"
"This is a good saison, but I think the spices are almost a bit too much. I'm not wild about the nose either, and I wish it were a bit smoother. If you like your saisons on the spicy side you will absolutely love this beer. I'd have it again, but I'm not sure I'd do so with regularity. When I do I will certainly let it warm."
"Pours a kind of deep golden color, moving a bit towards orange. The head is huge, rocky, and the bubbles pop up and leave giant caverns. The beer is hard to see through - I don't think it's that hazy, but the bubbles move so fast its hard to see through it. The head falls down, leaving only a bit of lacing. The smell is very grainy, pilsener malt, a tiny bit of sugar, but not sweet, and I'd bet there are other grains. A bit of tartness, a little lemon, maybe some acidity. Maybe a tiny bit of earthiness, a little leafiness. I think the taste has all of the good stuff. The taste is a bit tart, a little acidic. No real presence of hops, maybe a bit of the earthiness from Saaz. But every taste has something different in terms of grain. There's the grainy, powdery pilsener malt, the sweet kind of slick feeling of oats, and finish of a little spice. It starts to feel drier eventually, which I like. This one is good. The body is nice, around medium, maybe a little full for the style. But there's a brilliant dryness, which really goes far to compliment the tartness, and the rush of carbonation really carries it all through. No sting, but a pleasant mouthfull. I'd say this is easy to drink, though I think the ABV is a bit higher than I expect for the style. Still I could enjoy this almost any time."
"D - excellent example of the style, not only is it American made, but also from a can?!?! who-woulda-thunk?"
"Crisp in the mouth with a light-medium body and a fine, tingling carbonation. Suitable warm-weather beer, and plenty of character to boot."
"D- This is not my favorite style by any means, but I found this to be really easy to drink."
"Dark gold in color, almost a walnut color. Frothy head of foam. Mild nose of malt and faint banana notes. The initial attack is gentle banana. The mouthfeel is that of a traditional ale. The flavor goes from the gentle banana beginning to giving way to a rush of banana flavor and then a smooth malt finish. Its pretty easy drinking, but way too much banana in my opinion. I haven't really found the saissons that I have tried to have much in common. Eventually I expect that they will be widespread enough to develop some kind of ""theme."""
"A good, drinkable saison. CynicAle pours a bright, copper color with pale white lacing. The aroma is honey, caramel malt and floral hops. The flavor is quite clean for a saison, but there's still some farmhouse character in there. The bitterness is particularly nice on an otherwise honey-sweet beer. The feel is medium light and appropriate to the flavor. Drinkability is quite high, but I'm a sucker for the style. Again, I dearly wish that I could have easy access to Surly's beers."
"Overall this is another great Surly beer that comes in a can. I'm still new to the whole Saison style so I need to get use to it a little bit, but for what its worth, this represent it well and is good. Definitely one to check out if you have the chance too."
"D: In the end, this is a top notch brew... might be improved if i had served it on the cooler side of the spectrum... Many thanks to mnjeff for the trade!"
"D: A good summer session beer."
"Drinkability: Great thirst quenching summer brew with an ABV (almost 7%) that will sneak up on you."
"D--Definitely the best aspect of this beer. This is just so damn refreshing. Get this beer!!"
"Overall, this is a really great Saison that is offered from Surly. I really enjoyed all the unique tastes and this pint will be gone fast. My mother even enjoyed this beer! I will definitely be drinking more of this beer during the summer. Easy to drink, but backs a ton of flavor!"
"Drinkibility - Great, I could drink the whole 4 pack of cans easily, great session beer for the summer."
"Great drinkability. This is a perfect summer beer. Easy to put several of these back."
"Overall, I do feel this beer is quite drinkable. The taste and ABV are not too much and although the mouthfeel could be better, it goes down fairly lightly, making it easier than many of the more potent beers."
"hmm... if you look at the story and description printed on the can, this peppery, spicy, phenolic character seems to be what they were going for. with that in mind, it's not so bad. just not what i'm looking for in a saison. could use more farmhouse character too."
"D - Easy drinkable beer - flavors are smooth and easy. Certainly lends themselves as a summer drink."
"a golden color and a medium body head. a nose of yeasty protein, apricot, and pilsner hoppiness. i would say that is pretty much the palate... a tad sweet though. not necessarily earthy or dry. not meaty. resembled a pilsner type beer actually with a mealy peach fruit and a bitter finish. in a can i would say the weakest link of the line up of ready available surly beers in minneapolis. that isn't that big of an insult seeing as how good there line up is. don't bother can wise. significantly more authentic on tap."
"CynicAle delivered just about what I expected. A refreshing beer in a can that is nice to cool down after a long day in the summer heat. Thanks again Jamie!"
"Thanks to mikereaser for giving me the opportunity to sample this fine beer."
"Pours a bright golden color with a thick white head that reduces to a thin foam cap with good lacing in the glass. Aroma is floral and estery yeast. Light bodied with subtle carbonation medium sweetness and a slightly sour and bitter finish. Excellent drinkability."
"D= A very good saison here. Probably my favorite Surly beer to date and that is saying something! Nicely sessionable despite the ABV."
"Pours a golden straw with a thin beige head. Nice nose of herbs, spices, citrus, bready malts and peppery yeast. Taste is also quite fruity but well balanced by the earthy yeasts and floral spices. Light body is well carbonated and has a crisp, lingering finish. One of the best cans around. Can't wait to try more beer from Surly."
"This beer is too damn drinkable for it's ABV. If your girl likes a light tasting beer and you want her tipsy in a hurry then toss back a couple of these with her."
"Drinkability - A nice drinkable beer, another solid offering from Surly."
"D - I've long been a fan of craft beer in a can, but they typically take the form of porters, IPAs, or pilsners. A word-class American saison is what the craft beer movement in the US Is all about... Maybe not the best Saison out there, but it's very close... Plus, I absolutely love the name of this beer..."
"D- Wish I could order cases of this stuff..."
"ADDITION: I have found this beer to be an excellent pairing with spicy foods, especially spicy curry or Indian dishes."
"Drinkability: easy to down this refreshing brew."
"Drinkability is, as ever with every Surly beer I've tried, top notch. This isn't exactly a world shattering beer, but it's still quite satisfying after a 3 hour walk and visit to the botanical gardens. Kudos once again to Surly."
"Once again, I'm glad I'm a Minnesotan, if only so I could get Surly!"
"Once again, great Surly haul - props to sonicdescent. I'm generally a fan of the can, but this just reaffirmed my enthusiasm for it. I just love the fact that I poured a beautiful saison out of a freekin' can. Awesome. Bright orange color, nice head initially but wish it would've lasted a little longer as per the style. I drank it out of a pint but maybe I should've gone with something more shapely. Great nose on this - peppery spice with a nice pale malt sweetness and honey notes (as suggested in the description on the can). Excellent cripsy flavor, lightly malty and plenty of herbal floral notes and spicy hops. Fruity flowery yeastyness. Creamy, honey flavor too. These guys do so many styles so well - all I've tried have been great ""textbook"" examples of the style while remaining individual and unique. Big points for that in my book."
"D: Pretty easy drinking, might have to stock up on this next time I got to MN. Great summer beer."
"Poured into pint glass. Pours a relatively light amber with tasty-looking white head that sticks around for awhile. Smells of coriander and citrus fruits; a little funk comes through as well. A wonderfully refreshing taste of spices is first and foremost, and nice tartness follows and is great on the palette. Its nicely carbonated and has perfect thickness; it hides any abv pretty well too. An absolutely drinkable beer, one of the most so I've ever had."
"It was a very drinkable brew I really think Saison are a great brew to get me thinking of summer .I would drink this one again If I could find it"
"Overall: Really good drinkability, interesting flavors that combine to make a delicious beer! The smell is somewhat subtle but really shines when served in a snifter/tulip."
"The beer has a huge Belgian ester character. The most prominent aroma is the citrus, but there is a bit of peppery phenols in there as well. The yeast character overwhelms this beer, in a good way. The beer is pretty clear with a golden colour too it. The white fluffy head is there and stick around. This beer has loads of citrus esters with a slight bit of phenol pepper type twang. The esters linger on through the beer which eventually met by the bittering hops. I don't get very many hop notes in the beer, but the ester flavour is fanstastic. The malt backbone in this beer is quite pleasing and gives just enough sweetness that makes the esters even better. With a medium body and slightly high carbonation, this is quite fucking drinkable!"
"It has a golden color with a smallish head that doesn't stick around(PG lacing). It smells like a saison with its fruity aroma but it has a quite strong hop aroma as well. It tastes fruity and spicy and it has some good bitterness. It has good mouthfeel and nice carbonation. I don't know what it is about Surly but they seem so drinkable. Maybe it is the cans."
"D: Both refreshing and a great sipper. I look forward to trying more Surly beers...from a can!"
"Body seems a little heavier than the saisons I've tried, but it's still no fuller than medium. Crisp and refreshing, like any good saison should be. The lively carbonation gives the tongue a nice tingle. This is one of the easiest drinking beers I've ever tried. I really need to establish permanent trading ties with a Minnesota BA. Any volunteers?"
"I'm tempted to give Cynicale top marks in every category, but on reflection there is still some room for improvement (minuscule, but room nonetheless). Good beer in a can? I'm on board. Thanks Bryan!"
"Overall this is a fairly hoppy Saison, but it is very good. This is a nice summer beer but I think I could enjoy this in any weather. Subtle flavors and light mouth feel make this beer very drink able and refreshing."
"D: If you can get past the first 1/3 glass it's golden. Something I might try to give to a BMC drinker after something a bit more familiar to them."
"D: I love it! I'd drink another and buy 4 periodically if I lived within the distribution area."
"This is the last of the assorted Surly cans that used to call my beer fridge home. Time to start thinking about trading for more. Poured from a 16 ounce can into my nonic pint glass. With about an inch to go in the can, I stirred up the goodies and finished pouring. Appears a cloudy muted amber color with about an inch of tight, creamy light ecru foam. Smells and tastes of fruity, slightly spicy Belgian yeast, grass, bread, sweet malts. A notch above medium in both body and carbonation. A tasty, quenching ale."
"7/4/7/4/14 (3.6/5)"
"A nice refreshing saison. A little more tartness and a bit less bitterness and it would be a contender for my fav."
"."
"16 oz. can poured into a New Belgium goblet. Hazy golden, with a thick, light head that settled down into a thin blanket of foam that persisted throughout the drink. Restrained Belgian fruitiness in the nose and on the palate, with a hint of maltiness. Mouthfeel is slightly thin, but appropriate to the beer. A firm, balanced bitterness in the finish makes this beer very easy to drink and enjoy, and a perfect refresher for a warm afternoon."
"Can thanks to DBhog, thanks man!, poured into a normal pint glass. This beer has a murky yellow color. There was a very thin head that disappeared quickly. The aroma smells of pine, fruits and hops. I found the beer to have a nice spicy taste and a bitter finish. It was very well balanced and I would love to seek it out again. Not a bad seasonal beer."
"Overall it tastes fine I just wouldn't call it a saison. Probably won't seek this one out in a trade."
"Easy to drink. Nice on a warm summer day. Wish they sold these at Giant's games."
"To bad I live in PA and not MN and I don't see Surly coming to my state anytime soon, here's to hoping."
"Overall: CynicAle is quickly becoming one of my favorites of Surly, I think I just got a bad on-tap."
"D-Nice drinkability. Smooth character and surprisingly refreshing."
"many thanks to mandy for this one"
"Overall awesome beer. Was very surprised and could definitely throw a bunch of these back. Mouthfeel and drinkability were quite good. Medium body mouthfeel wiht a nice creamy taste make for one enjoyable drinking beer."
"I wanted to make this a theme based review, but it was more of a combo of random thoughts. Surly you must be kidding, Dont call me Surly. Good thing Surly looks out for one guy, Surly."
"Another great extra from Dbhog. Served in my New Belgium goblet. Poured a translucent burnt orange with a two inch frothy off-white head. Sheets of stickly lacing are revealed as the brew receded. Nose suggests belgian yeast, some candi sugar and an herbal/grassy quality; missing the funk I've come to associate with the style. Taste follows nose with a slightly herbal residual aftertaste that lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel was very lively and fairly light-bodied. This is a very nice farmhouse; easy drinking and flavorful, but somewhat lacking in the characteristics I've come to associate with the style."
"Usually I don't care much for Saisons, but this one really clicked with me. I could easily put back a couple cans of this."
"Fantastic, a great and very enjoyable Saison."
"Complex, unique, totally unexpected. High marks for fitting the saison style well, but not a personal favorite style. A complex beer that might scare away the uninitiated."
"amazingly drinkable. light but not vapid, flavorful but not overpowering. definitely a fan of this one... and would probably drink can after can, if I had the option."
"The ash-aged is still a little more jaw dropping than the canned cynic."
"This was surprisingly good, Surly is doing big things. 16oz can thanks to vwcraig. Great orange color with a scant head. Smells like bready spices, nice. The flavor is deliciously fruity, lemons and malts with a little pepper thrown in. Overall a very tasty saison from a can."
"D - Very high. I could have this all night."
"Surly! Come to New England!"
"The body is moderate but still easy drinking. The carbonation is light but if it was more then might hid the light malt character there is. Overall there are some glaring off notes, specifically the malt, the Belgian yeast character, and some water notes, but some positives with the fruity presence and drinkability."
"Enjoyable beer in a can. Props for that."
"Maybe its old. I'm surprised Surly would neglect to print a canning date."
"Drinkability: This is Surly's most alcoholic canned beer and still sits at just 6.7%. You wouldn't want to drink your whole four pack in a row, but mostly because this is a beer that should be appreciated. One of the many reasons I love Surly brewing so much is because they have some of the most flavorful beers and remain relatively low in alcohol. I like getting buzzed as much as the next BA but I've come to realize that if they could make something that could taste like this, or any other Surly offering, and it was only 2%ABV I'd drink it just as much, if not more. As far as this brew goes, I highly recommend it. In fact, if you think you may not like Belgian-style ales, definitely try this. I always review objectively but I feared if I give another Surly an A+ I'd come off as a fanboy, but you know what? I just don't care, this is an A+ beer and it deserves exactly that."
"D- This is a great saison overall and a good representation of the style. I had been looking forward to trying this one for awhile and was glad I had the opportunity to do so. Will trade for it again!"
"Drinkability: I'm noticing that the theme so far with Surly has been ""simplicity"" - their brews thus far have been straightforward, balanced, and pretty darn drinkable. This one is no different - just a good, reasonably light, solid saison, low in alcohol, high in enjoyability."
"Light bodied and very light on the palate with good carbonation."
"Mouth: Very peachy flavor, but not the lush, dripping-with-fructose type of peachy. More like underripe, bruised, didn't-ripen-on-the-vine peachy. Accents of black pepper and earth. Diacetyl is just barely apparent. Mouthfeel is pretty nice, although the carbonation is noticeably coarser than a real Belgian saison. Solid drinkability, but overall this beer is only decent."
"Mouthfeel is crisp, smooth and refreshing with a solid medium body and touch of creaminess. An incredibly easy drinking brew with a great overall flavor profile. I could see myself going through a 4 pack of this in no time flat! This ranks up there as one of my favorite Surly brews I have yet to sample. A fine example of a Saison."
"A lot like Dernière Volonté by Dieu du Ciel. Sticky Styrian Golding, floral/herbal hops. Pepper/cardamom, apricot. Sweet grainy malt and a nice smooth fullness in the mouth, but with a firm clean bitterness. Hazy golden-orange with slightly disappointing head formation/retention, but it's still pretty good. Very aromatic, very much like Dieu-du-Ciel. I might even prefer it."
"M + D: Softer, foamy... it goes down rather nicely. Not too bad, and a decent offering from Surly. I have, so far been fonder of the hoppier offerings, but I would do this one again."
"Future outlook: I am upset that I cannot get this stuff here in Ohio....damn good."
"Drinkability: Very good beer. The complexity is nice, it is quite refreshing, and the ABV is at a good level where you can have a few and it wouldn't be too much. Glad to try this one and would definitely buy if given the opportunity."
"Easily sessionable. Light and refreshing. Would be good on a warm day, a beer geek replacement for lawnmower beer. Goes down pretty easily."
"M/D - very easy drinking, flavorful beer. I could drink plenty of this and am glad that I was given a 4 pack to enjoy. Really nice brew. Then again, I haven't found a Surly product I didn't like. Too bad they're so far from PA."
"Overall another superb beer by Surly. I did not expect this type of beer from them, but damn is it good. Luckily I have 2 more cans to drink. Go me!"
"This one pours a medium cloudy yellow, with a quarter-inch white head. No lacing to speak of. Smells strongly of yeast, with some apples thrown in. Tastes like a mild belgian ale, strong yeast favor mixed with apples, white wine, pears, and other fruit. A nice mix of flavor. A slight amount of pungent aftertaste, carbonation slightly lower than it could have been. Overall, a very drinkable beer."
"Mild but sharp carbonation make it pleasant to drink."
"Overall: Thanks to OHLRangers, and Scoobydank for both generously hooking me up with this great Saison. I like it a lot. I would drink this stuff all day long."
"This goes very smoothly and is a welcome treat. Would enjoy having a lot more of this around in-season/early summer. Excellent offering from the crew in Brooklyn Center."
"this one was poured into my duvel tulip, poured a slightley cloudy orange/yellow color with minimal head on it, the smell is sour and bitter. the taste is yeastey and golden malt in the begining, apricots, peaches honney, and a strong spicey black peeper notes in the middle, the end is floral/piney hops that fade quickley and leave only a minimal aftertaste."
"Pours a standard lager like golden with very good clarity. Minimal white head some lacing. nose- spice and light fruit, honey. Taste- pepper, other spice, grassy with a dry spicy hop finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonation. Drinkability decent, a little hot."
"CynicAle was yellow-orange in color and hazy. It had a short beige head with decent retention and a little lacing. The aroma was doughy and fruity with peppery spices. The taste was more peppery spices, doughy malt, lightly fruity, and some hops with a fairly dry, lingering finish. It was medium bodied with good carbonation. Drinkability was very good. This beer is definitely worth trying."
"All told, it's flawed amd simple, but it's alright."
"I remember being underwhelmed when I had this on tap at the Long Room. I'm glad I gave this another chance, although I wish there was a little more sweetness in the taste and not just the smell. One of the better American Saisons in any case."
"D - I gave this a low number because it does have a rather high alcohol content to be a session beer. Throw back two of these and maybe the Hamms would look better....Nah."
"A unique offering that fits broadly into a saison-style ale. There's a fair amount of complexities to it. Floral, fruity, spicy - a bit much on the black pepper after awhile. All-in-all a nice ""something different"" that is saison-ish brew!"
"D: Above average farmhouse ale, but not quite thrilling. Good but maybe too typical, especially in comparison to the other Surly beers I have tried. I would be challenged to finish an entire pint can here."
"Surly is the Pete Maravich of brewers. You think there's nothing they could possibly do to liven up a certain beer style and then BAM they go and dribble through the defender's legs. I had this oak-aged, on cask, and I have to say it might be the only beer I've ever had that'd better from a can than on cask. The yeast and hop complexity is so wonderful that doesn't make any sense to blot it out with oak flavors."
"Much more spicey and peppery in the taste. Very good mouthfeel. Wonderfully biting and carbonated. This could use a touch of sweetness and funk. Very easy drinking and very delightful."
"D= great I love surlys. Everything they have is just so fresh and tasty"
"Got it in a pint glass right now. Lots of sparkly bubbles, nice head even halfway through the glass, lots of lacy residue down the side of the glass. My sniffer isn't that sensative, but there is a marked fruit/spice aroma coming from the glass. The flavor is outstanding, rich malty fruity flavors abound, nice long finish. It has a very good mouthfeel, kind of squishy and full-bodied. At 6.7%, a couple pints of this would be plenty, plenty good that is."
"Overall: next"
"Wow...this is a smooth one. The flavor starts out with a mellowed lemon citrus and crystal malt body that soon transitions to a mix of white pepper, soft hoppy bitterness, and other grassy spices. The yeast adds a few fruity papaya and banana notes. Mouthfeel is creamy, well-carbonated, and light in body. Excellent aftertaste and drinkability, and a beer I'd be happy to trade for again. First impressions are important, and Surly has made a good one on me."
"After Darkness, this is my favorite Surly."
"This is a seriously drinkable brew from Surly, like most of their offerings. Another great beer in a can from the boys in Minnesota."
"An affordable and accessible Saison, Surly CynicAle is definitely worth a try. This and Furious are two Surly brew I would love to have in my fridge at all times."
"Drinkability - an enjoyable can of beer, much thanks to OHLRangers for tossing this is with the Munsterfest LIF."
"D: Good interpretation of a Farmhouse/Saison. Don't be skeptical - toss a couple CynicAles back and enjoy!"
"Poured a 16oz can into my Tripel Karmeliet tulip. This beer pours a beautiful, clear gold with a 1 inch head that left just a spotty lacing. The aroma is biscuits, yeast, and hints of apples and tangerines. The taste is biscuity, with a bit of fruity phenols and just a hint of must at the tail. The mouthfeel is light and refreshing with a sharp carbonation. This would be the perfect beer on a hot day. Great stuff by Surly"
"D) for a beer that I initially find to be good for some reason with every can I find myself struggling to finish the beer once i get past 3/4 of the way through a can. although the 6.7% abv is well hidden"
"Quite drinkable. A bit underwhelming overall, sadly. Definitely worth a try, and interesting to get a somewhat belgian ale from a can, but it's not the best example I've had of the style, by far."
"Impressive saison, and generally an impressive beer. Recommended."
"Mouthfeel is a lighter medium body. Dry finish with a blanket after taste. Very excellent!"
"Overall not bad here at all. The style is one that I have become a tad bit bored with lately, but this one really came through quite nicely. I would have no issue with trying this again any day. About as solid as they come."
"Drinks alright for the style, spot on for the style; except for the bloody dryness. I expect more from surly than this"
"a very nice concoction and definitely recommended!"
"Light in body, smooth, crisp, and perfectly carbonated. Great drinkability and incredibly well balanced - I usually tire of the flavor of Saisons midway through, but this one was just about perfect."
"Drinkability: Saison in a can - who knew?"
"Taste is crisp, lemon and yeast come to mind right off the bat, weird aftertaste that is slight funky and slightly unpleasant."
"It's funny how Surly has this reputation as a big-beer brewery, but it's really just their flavors that are huge (with only a couple big-ass exceptions). Most of their beers have reasonable ABVs, and that makes them insanely drinkable, including this one. All this flavor from a can...you gotta love it. [Thanks to my brother Nick for this kickass hookup!]"
"Solid brew. Styles is noted as ""saison", I get more of the farmhouse ale noted on BA. Funky farm smell, bread, yeast but refreshing none the less. I enjoyed 1 can more than the other. Not sure why. Smooth and balanced. If I were to buy more Surly I would pick this up with the other 3 major brews they make just to have options. And hey it's Surly!"
"Poured into my Surly glass a nic hazy golden yellow color, nice carbonation, tiny white foamy head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty/yeasty, with some corinander, slightly grassy. The taste is malty/yeasty, very nice touch of corinander, with some grassy notes. Medium body, this is a slightly not as spicy/yeasty typical Saison, I like it because of that and it makes in more drinkable, but quite different. Drinkable, this is a nice one."
"Drinkability: My second Surly in a day and another winner."
"Medium-bodied and well-carbonated, and very smooth. This thing is disappearing dangerously fast for a 16 oz. can that's rated at 6.7% ABV. Finally, a fizzy yellow beer in a can that nails it."
"The recipe is true enough to style that this is allusive to some of the foremost traditional example of saisons. It is also ever so slightly creative in its new world approach which, to me, again makes Surely beers some of the most impressionistic examples of what American craft brewers are capable of."
"CynicAle is simply another fine beer from Surly. I used to be somewhat can averse when it came to my beer. Not so any more. These guys (as well as some others) brew some remarkable beer and put it in a can. This beer could use a little work on the nose. Otherwise, it's highly recommended."
"Pours a hazy gold colour with a big head. Small lace with great retention. Smells of bannanas, yeasty bread and citrus hops. Flavour is very spicy with a lot of yeast character and hops. Some bannana in there as well which seems odd in a Saison but it works. It has a honey like malt character along with a pleasing breadiness. Bitterness is there in the finish and is quite nice. Mouthfeel is medium and the carbonation is medium high. Not as dry as a lot of Saisons Ive had but that really doesnt matter as this is an excellent beer. Great for disc golfing."
"Drinkability is moderate to high. This beer is pretty easy to drink, but the flavors aren't quite where I'd hoped they would be. A good brew nonetheless."
"d: This is my first Surly brew and though I am expecting a lot from the brewery, I wasn't expecting much from CynicAle. Well, I should have been, this is one of the better Saisons I have had the pleasure of enjoying. A wonderful Belgian beer poured from a pint can, what's not to love about that?"
"Poured into a 20 ounce Nonic showing a nice light copper color. Not much of a head - it dissipates rather quickly (very un-Saison like). Smells of orange marmalade with a yeasty, spiciness lingering in the background and a slight hint of hops. I expected a bit more depth from the smell. Tastes very good with floral, pit fruits and bread dough all emerging. Finishes with a hoppy bitterness that invites you back for another sip. This beer is very drinkable / ""sessionable"" - I could easily kick back 2 - 3 of these."
"Big thanks to tprokop for this awesome extra. Poured in to my Stella goblet a glowing, slightly hazed orange/gold, with a white laced heading. Smell reveals some clove, chalky medicinal smell, bit of must, orange and peach. Taste is dominated by the peach, but some floral notes come in to play as well, similar to chamomile tea. Some bitterness is there to balance out some of the initial sweetness. Body is medium, with lots of different complexities with each pull. Drinkability is very good, I only wish I had more than one. Great Saison from the guys are Surly, this one is as good as any I have had. A beer to take your time with and let unfold. Cheers"
"Mouthfeel was on the thinner side. Light/moderate carbonation."
"Thanks again to pepsican."
"Overall: At the moment it reminds me more of a amped up Stella Artois because the hops hide so much of what I was looking for. But this clearly has a lot more complexity to show over time."
"This was a nice Saison, didn't knock my socks off but it certainly was nice. It pours a cloudy amber with a 2 fingered white head. The smell is nice of the wonderful yeasts and malts used to make this beer. The taste is nice and smooth you get the nice belgium spice flavor as well as the malty saison flavor. The mouthfeel is comfortable, seemed a little too carbonated for me. I could see myself drinking a few of these but not an all nighter."
"D: All together not a bad beer, nicely balanced and quite tasty which helps this beer go down quick and easy, but just not what I was expecting from a beer that calls itself a saison."
"d- very drinkable, goes like a lower ABV session beer."
"M/D - Light to medium bodied and very crisp. Easy drinking saison...out of a can!"
"Notes: Very good stuff, definitely up to Surly's standard of excellence. Doesn't quite compare to a lot of authentic Belgian saisons, but great nonetheless (plus I love the idea of a saison in a can)."
"A well-crafted saison that was quite enjoyable. Cheers to the folks at Surly!"
"Another excellent beer from Surly. Wouldn't hesitate to order this beer again if I ever see it."
"Thoughts: My first Surly experience. So far, worth the hype. One of the best canned beers ever."
"What more can I say other than, it's a thrill to get the style in a can but a bigger thrill to get so good an example of the style, that happens to come in a can. Great stuff and highly recommended."
"A very intriguing beer, wavering between soft fruit and full strong light grains. Taste keeps me coming back for more as it develops new flavors with each sip. Pleasantly drinkable."
"HV"
"D-Probably wouldn't reach for another-maybe not my favorite style. Enjoyed the beer mostly because of the added hop flavor."
"served on-tap, this was a solid beer. golden amber and mostly clear with a thin white head and lacing. tropical fruit in the nose along with some honeyed and floral notes. also a bit of vague funky earthiness and spice. lightly sweet bready malts upfront lead to a drying finish with a light, smooth bitterness. creamy and somewhat lightly carbonated. light to medium in body. i would have guessed that the abv was lower than it is. seems sessionable based on the flavor, aroma, and mouthfeel."
"D: I'd drink another!"
"spot on- a great summer quencher, but just a little assertive."
"I'm thinking about using some in a bread recipe."
"D: Easy to drink and very refreshing. I really liked the slightly amped up hoppiness."
"Thanks to Tytoanderso for the MN goody! Poured from the can into a sam perfect pint. Light orange color with a small white head. Dissaptes quikly with no loacing. Smells of some fruit- peach, orange- a good saison aroma. Taste is fairly full- lots of the fruit and a bit of bite- maybe the pepper they say. A bit oily for me, not enough crispness or carbonation. Pretty drinkable, though. Good flavor for a summer type session beer!"
"Thanks to Scoobydank for this one in a mixed Surly 4-pack."
"Thanks to dfried for the opportunity. Pours a soft copper/orange with little to no head. Carbonation is weak. Smells is equally as weak, maybe some fruity esters, pepper/soft spicey hops, MAYBE. Taste is balanced, as it should be, but isn't hitting in all the right places. Some maltiness with minimal sweetness, a nice spicey hop finish. Not a very dry finish. Maybe some oranginess to it as it warms. Good but could be better."
"Very tasty and drinkable. I would love to try it out in a can koozie on the beach for a true summer drinkability test, but I only have one..."
"Derek's can from a trade in WI. Yellow to grapefruit with a good head, lacing. Really easy drinking, 35 IBU but show more. A great summer deck beer. Restrained spiciness including the pepper. Light clover honey mouthfeel, about middling. I repeat, really easy drinking."
"I have had the pleasure of this one for some time. I think of it as one of my top 5 beers, for any place and time. It pours a nice light head only a few millimeters with a pungent yeasty smell. Clearly Belgian influenced, with a nice apricot and citrus flavor. I wish I could get this all year round. It has a nice lingering orange peel bitterness that sticks to my pallet. I like the fruitiness too. I disagree with what the can says, it's not Black pepper as much as it is pink peppercorns or maybe a little szechuan pepper. Bitter, sweet, and smooth with a lasting orange flavor. I thinlk improving the aroma with some dry hopping and it's five stars in my book. Maybe the brewers will read this and make a special growler batch that I can come by and pick up. Hopefully the do, e-mail me, and make my dreams come true. I will really miss this one if I move out of minnesota."
"Thanks for the trade DaPeculiarDane!"
"Pretty good, although I'd take Hennepin over it as an American Saison. Serve this one somewhat-chilled."
"D: Very refreshing and a nice summer brew. Not the best saison I've had, but a decent offering. And even a decent beer from Surly is still worth while trying!"
"When I first opened the can I didnt think there would be much carbonation. A three finger head quickly prves me wrong with fat light tan bubbles with nice staying power. Scattered lace is left. Body is a glowing honey color. Nose is very fresh and clean with some spicey crisp fruit notes, mellon, honey, vanilla and fresh cut corn stalk. Enters the mouth very mellow and smooth as the flavors slowly develop. Crisp creamy citrus notes, woodsy hops with bitter bite, all rounded out with a even malt profile to balance this brew. Flowery smoothness is all over the body. This is a very smooth and pleasant mouthfeel on the beer. Exceptionally drinkable, I could see this beer at many a cookout and family get together."
"Poured a burnt orange, out of can into a snifter, developing a finger's worth of bone-white foam that recedes awfully quick and leaving some nice lacing down the glass. Yeasty funkiness hits the nose first followed by some hints of orange and lemon peel. Slight malt character in the nose with the typical sour funk of a saison. Flavor is light, lots of sweet malts that turns awfully dry on the finish, some hints of apple cider in the background, bitter rind, and lemon that makes a quick appearance and then disappears. Definitely spicey, with some noticeable black pepper flavors mixed with some clove. Alcohol is present but not overpowering. Somewhat light on the body, medium carbonation and pretty easy to drink, although this style is not one of my favorites. A good representation of the style, but I've enjoyed Surly's other offerings to a much higher extent."
"EDIT: The original review was from a tap, but after having it from the can, I'm adjusting this upward. I don't know if I had a bad keg or what, but from a can the mouthfeel was much stronger and the taste cleaner. We'll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that the keg was near the end (or something)."
"This beer is really refreshing and a great summer session beer but the ABV may come back and bite after a few."
"on tap at stub n herbs in minneapolis. orange colored, wispy not-head. nice lacing though. smells of old orange rinds, noble hops, coriander. Flavor is spicy, citrusy, with a nice strong bitterness to follow. Nicely balanced between the crisp malt, citrusy saison character, and the bitterness on the finish. a good interpretation of the early summer saison style. refreshing and quaffable."
"Ahhh, this is nice. I think I had one last year, but don't really recall. A fine summer beer from Surly."
"I remember this being much more gingery. It is very well balanced."
"Poured a slightly hazy golden yellow with a light amber center. One finger of frothy off-white head has good retention and leave lovely lacing. Smells of an assortment of fruits like pineapple, apricot, apple, as well as wheat, floral hops, and a touch of honey. Tastes of pear, pineapple, melon and apples up front with wheat and spice following as well as a hint of bubble gum. Finishes dry with floral hops. Medium in body with good fizzy carbonation. Refreshing and fruity, a perfect summertime brew that hides its ABV great."
"Very light on the palate, with pleasant fruity notes, mostly lemons and oranges, with some hoppiness but not as pronounced as on-tap, likely because this is not nearly as fresh. There are some spices, and a mild earthiness and malty sweetness. Well balanced and refreshing, but could use a somewhat lower ABV."
"Hazy Pale orange with a white head and lace. Smells of orange zest and lemon w/ a grain background. Malt is a little more pronounced than I remember it from previous tastings, could be because the can is about 6 months old. I love the hops in this beer, they play so nicely with the lighter malt, and the yeast used. That yeast is also one of the highlights of this beer, enough so that there is no doubt that it's a Belgian style, but not enough to overpower the other flavors. A very well balanced beer. It leaves you wanting more and more. Mouthfeel is very good. This is one of my favorite summertime beers cause it's light but extremely tasty."
"Drinkability- @6.7%, I wouldn't call it sessionable, but I can definitely see having this in the future."
"A careful pour left me with a crystal clear medium amber brew with a thin white head that left quickly. Lots and lots of lace on the way down the glass. Aroma contains some dried fruits and spicy hops. Tastes of bready malt, spicy, peppery, earthy, barnyard funky, quite complex tastes coming through. Great crisp carbonation, medium body, leaves a spicy taste in your mouth. Overall I was surprised by this one. This is not my favorite style of beer, but I rather enjoyed this tasting tonight."
"Pours a slightly hazy pale golden color with with a big foamy white head that fades slowly. Visibly effervescent surface pools struggle to keep the head alive. A good amount of Belgian lacing left behind. The smell is earthy yeast, light and floral with a touch of orchard fruit. Towards the bottom it picks up a spicier character. Nicely carbonated, the mouth feel is medium bodied and refreshing. Full flavored, the spicy orchard fruit taste and earthy yeast follow the nose and linger appropriately. A real nice drinker."
"D: A terrific version of a wonderful style. Surly is making some amazingly good beers; the novelty of ""beer for a glass, from a can"" is rapidly disappearing. Not quite a 'Saison Dupont', but very good...likely the best US-made version I've found to date. Thanks again, Dana; this is one I'd love to have again and one I strongly recommend."
"Looks great, pours a big head and there's some lacing. Color is golden. Smell is just you would think a saison would taste like with the farmhouse smells, but then there's also floral aroma hops that make a big hop character. Funky farmhouse with huge hop floral notes that remind me of perfume, then leaves a bitterness on my tongue my lasts a while. Yeah, the hops are very perfumatic with their almost grassy fruity flavors. Mouthfeel is full and smooth, very good medium-full bodied beer. Overall I like it, but something in the hop character makes it a once in a while beer instead of a ""drink many of them"" beer. I think I just have to get used to grassier hops...especially since it's paired with a Belgian beer profile, I haven't had many of the grassy hop profile beers. Just read Surly's website and they imported some new hops for fruity character, so that's the perfume hops I must be smelling."
"Excellent drinkability. Can't say that I've ever had more than one at a time due to availability, or lack thereof, but if this was sold here I'd buy it in a heartbeat, especially for summer."
"Beer poured a somewhat cloudy yellow color with a nice white head. The nose had a touch of citrus and some definite wheat characer. The taste is scotchy and sweet but also had some bitterness on the back end. Overall a well rounded beer and medium body."
"This is simply another superb brew from Surly. It's unfortunate this is a seasonal release, I wish it were in the rotation all year long."
"Drinkability is moderately high, I can't believe that such a well-balanced and flavorful saison came out of a can, score another winner from Surly!"
"Drinkability- Well, like all of the Surly brews I've had (thank god I got coworkers going back-and-forth to Minneapolis) this one is pretty much really good and super quaffable. I'm not really sure how they do it but all of their beers are so damn appreciable and so delicious. Can't wait for this one to come around again. Big thanks again to Greg!"
"D: Really drinkable stuff and another awesome Surly brew. It's very interesting and Belgian yet has the drinkability of a lager, which fits into the taste as well. I don't know what that is, but this is recommended for sure."
"D- This is clearly a very drinkable brew. Perhaps a bit different than something I would session but I liked it none the less."
"I've tried 4 Surly beers so far... and in my book, they are 4 for 4."
"Pours out of the can a slightly cloudy (chill haze?) peachy/brown, on the dark side for a saison. Head is good, but goes fast. nice lace. The nose is of wheat, grain, belgian yeast and pepper. First taste brings out wheats and spice. Strong belgian yeast flavors abound with some almost hefeish banana note on the end (very slight). Peppery yeastish wheat on the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is on the thick side, and carbonation is strong. Very drinkable saison, but maybe this is just the psychological effect of the can. A great offering and I will certainly seek out some more surly after tasting this one. Thanks again, Dana."
"Full mouthfeel, moderately carbonated, finishes bubbly and tingly, crisp and dry."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, I found this to be a very enjoyable beer. I could definitely keep drinking this beer for a very long time."
"This didn't really make a big impression on me, not bad though."
"Overall: It gives a sense that i'm not sure how to describe. Like i should be in a nice cottage in the country in front on a fireplace instead of a city. Definitely a go-to winter snowstorm brew."
"Overall- For the style, damn good! My personal preference, I probably could only drink 1. I really liked it although Saisons aren't my cup of tea!"
"Poured a pretty nice golden color with a pillowy white head; good retention and lace. There is some clove and other spice in the aroma, some earthy hops, and maybe a hint of bubble gum. Taste starts out much like the smell, but there's maybe a little more bubble gum in the middle; has an earthy finish. Nice medium body, carbonation is about medium. Sits on the tongue pretty nice and doesn't get cloying. I think I like this a touch less than my ratings will show, but it is another well made beer from the guys at Surly."
"Overall - A great Saison from Surly! Not my favorite Saison but definatly an honerable Saison. This is a nicely balanced beer that stays true to the style but adds a few non traditional flavors."
"Pretty good. Easy to drink, slightly tart. Spices are not overdone. I am impressed by Surly."
"Another good beer from Surly, I am glad I got the oppournity to taste this seasonal beer from those canning maniacs, highly recommended but go after Bender and Furious first, would drink again if given the chance"
"Mouthfeel is fairly crisp and light, with adequate carbonation that somehow lacks when compared with bottle-conditioned Belgians. Flavor is quite good, a touch of sweetness up front conveying the fruity stone fruit notes, mixed with black pepper and coriander. The sweet side quickly gives way to a long, tar, hoppy finish, with lingering bitterness. This bitterness ovverwhelms when the beer is cold, but integrates better as is warms, permitting the peppery and fruity notes to peep through. Although I appreciate the dryness of this beer, somehow that white grapefruit pith bitterness just hits a little to hard for me--but much better than erring on the sweet side. Certainly this is a solid, impressive effort at a complex and interesting style."
"Thanks for this delicious beer trade surprise, tavernjef."
"Incredibly fresh tasting, it's like someone pulped up these flavors right next to my table."
"m: medium bodied beer with average amount of carbonation"
"Pours a hazy golden, thin sticky white head forms, big lacing, great retention, certainly looks like a saison. Smell is sweet, oranges, caramel, spice, marmalade, citrus fruits, some vanilla, apricot, floral, excellent aroma. Taste is oranges, wheat, spices, marmalade, bread and yeast, spicy caramel finish, solid bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied with medium to high carbonation, very refreshing with a great dry and spicy finish. Awesome saison! Thanks Scott."
"Another very solid beer from Surly...a good first shot at a Belgian style. Well worth seeking a can of this out."
"Overall: Surly knows what they are doing there is no doubt about it. Their brews are so expertly crafted it's just sick. I love this one, when you think Saison, you think of the best sent over the pond from Belgium, but this one stands up to all of them."
"Another example of how it's possible for a fine beer to exist in a can. Plus it's a Saison no less! Special thanks to Bighuge for the sample."
"Oddly, the can felt wierd. I was able to squeeze it and push in the sides. Wierd for a carbonated can. Some flower like flavors and a sweet honey or syrup flavor. Actually perhaps more of a honey flavor. Light body that does not bear down on me as I finsih my glass."
"D-Very surprised by this beer. I reviewed the 1st from the pack, which is not common for me, becasue I thought the other might sit because I wouldn't love it. But it is certainly really awsome."
"drinkability is great. balanced and very interesting. excellent restraint on the spicing. overall a great example of the style. definitely hoping i can get my hands on more of this one."
"I like where they were going with this but feel the execution is a bit lacking. It's not quite the full-flavored, exceptional beer that I've come to expect from Surly."
"IPA meets Saison, and its a good marriage."
"Medium body beer with a nice light feel to it. Very active carbonation mixed with the yeasty bite adds a nice prickly feel on the tongue. Extremely enjoyable saison. My favorite, so far, by quite a ways. Thanks, Ed. When can you get me some more?"
"Medium body, lightly carbonated, dry finish, awesome taste, easy sips, refreshing, all around great to drink!"
"Throw style out the window and you have a great summer beer here with a hop kick that can match up to most Pale Ales. Don't expect a typical Saison here and you will enjoy this beer very much..."
"Pours a clear golden color with a creamy white head that leaves a good amount of lacing. Smells of spice and fruit. It tastes like mother's cupboard. Very peppery and many spices mixed together. It tastes somewhat like a ginger-snap cookie. Very unique and unusual with it's blunt spice flavor. It is light bodied and finishes clean with little aftertaste. Maybe too spicey for me to enjoy many of these. Another Surly beer that assaults the taste buds. Nothing boring here."
"Drinkability is pretty good. This is a heavier beer than I'm used to for the style, interesting though. Recommended."
"Thanks to tavernjef for another Surly brew. Poured a pretty clear golden orange color from a sixteen ounce can. Beer was capped nicely by a dense, bubbly, bright white two finger head. head dissipated on the slow side , and left sticky streaks of thick lace behind. Noticed a good amount of carbonation bubbles streaming up from the bottom of the glass. The nose on this one was a bit different. Had a somwwhat strange fruity, spicey, earthy aroma with a bit of hay in the mix. It's like nothing I have ever smelled before. Taste was about the same. Lots of spice, cinnamon, yeast, bread, and a nice thick malty flavor. Just a bit peppery. A very earthy feel to it. Somewhat bitter, but, with a sweetness to it. Nice smooth medium body to it. Above average drinkability. An aquired taste in my opinion."
"Poured from a 1 pint can into a Delirium Tremens glass (it took a few pours). The beer is golden colored and clear, with a spitty head which leaves some fine celled lacing on the glass. The aroma is just a tad funky, barnyard odors and such, but not quite as much as I'd like. Likewise, the flavor had a bit of grass, a hint of bubblegum, but mostly just a dryish bitter taste that was pleasant but not robust. This was my second of the 4-pack, I remember liking the first a lot more (3 weeks ago on a boat in the Mississippi river). Oh well, this is nice but not as style-defining as Furious."
"Pours out a somewhat hazy, copper/gold color. Pillowy white head tops it off, leaving behind some lace trails. Some fruity elements on the nose, some earth tones as well. Somewhat spicy taste, backed by a floral hop mix. Some grassy elements, with hints of fruit mixed in as well. A pretty dry brew, medium bodied. I've been hearing some good things about this brewery, and this beer leaves me wanting to try the rest. I'm sure everyone else has talked about the can, so I will spare you."
"Wow. This is the easiest sippin saison Ive ever had."
"First taste of Surly, and I am excited to try it. Pours from the 16 oz can into my pint glass a hazy orange color with thick white head that dies down to leave a thin white covering on top of this one. Smell is of spices, pepper, and coriander come through strong. Taste is remarkable smooth with pepper dominating followed by the other spices and a slight hop punch. Carbonation is slim, so the flavors are able to be enjoyed sip after sip. First taste is a good sign of great things to come."
"Pours hazy golden amber with some nice tan head that disappears with little to no lacing. Smells of citrus, earthy undertones, tea, little hop and many different nice spices. Smells like a tasty saison! A burst of spicy malt, citrus, butterscotch, molasses and lemon. Everything shows up quite nicely and nothing is overdone. Very light in the mouth, little carbonation and a very subtle bite at the end that sits on the tongue. I think this brew is underrated since its so different from the hop filled siblings from Surly but to be honest its still a one of kind brew. Could drink this for days. Well done Surly, after tasting your three mainstays Im considering moving to Minnesota."
"Cynic Ale will turn even the most jaded cynic into a true believer. On the strength of four amazing beers, Surly has vaulted into a permanent place in my top-10 breweries of all-time. Believe the hype."
"Got in a trade with Faro - many thanks! Poured from a 16oz can (yes a can - get over it) with cool artwork and a blurb about the beer into my NBB snifter. It was a slightly hazy golden honey color. It really didn't have much of a head but I think I poured it a little too cold still since not used to judging temps in a can by touch like I can with a bottle. What little there was settled into a thin collar with no lacing. One thing I did miss with the can was the pop of the cork that you usually get with a saison due to all the carbonation. This one didn't pop at all and really no carb visible in the glass. Not sure if that is due to the can or maybe the sample was off a little. Either way it still smelled and tasted great. The aroma was spicy with black pepper and fruity with apricot and something else I couldn't identify. You could smell the dryness that was to come in the taste. The taste was classic saison with a fruity start that is followed by a sharp bite of spice. Great balance between the two. Mouthfeel was just a tad watery for a saison but still good. Overall, a really great beer that I highly recommend especially if you are into saisons. Glad I was able to acquire it and will have to seek out some more. (4.5, RR, T, Y)"
"D - A good beer that just seemed to be a little overpowering at times. I am having a hard time describing it but it just seems like there is too much going on."
"The drinkability was good, but that strong clove flavor is not my favorite."
"Cynic Ale pours a yellow-orange with a white/off-white head. The aroma is very reminiscent of Belgian beers like Duvel Golden Ale. The taste also reminds me of Duvel, but with a subtle smoothness found in beers made with oats. Hops are present, but much more noticeable at the end of the taste. The mouthfeel is good with the oaty-smoothness mentioned above. This beer is very drinkable, but at 6.7% abv, I wouldn't drink more than two at a time. Cynic Ale is definitely a beer to try if you can get your hands on it."
"This brew pours a clear reddish-bronze color. The head is small, but long lasting. The aroma is of peppers, spices, yeast, apricot, and pears. I really like the abundance of pepper. The taste is a lot like the aroma; pepper and spice rounded out by apricot and pear. Bitterness is moderate, but firm in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is another fine beer from Surly. I cannot say I like it as much as Furious or Bender, but I would certainly drink it again."
"Medium bodied...finishes mildly dry....I enjoy this because I hate overly dry saisons....this to me is pretty easy drinking but at the same time has depth and character....another winner..."
"Pours a burnt foggy orange with nice fluffy two finger head that slowly dies down to a nice lacing. Stickiness is here and there, pretty good. Smell is of mild yeast with a nice spice zing to it. A good pepper scent tingles the nose as well. Decent, but I've smelt very similar. Taste starts off with a powerful carbonated bang of a metallic yeast and is quickly overtaken by an acidic coriander spice. Ends with a bready malt that pleases the tongue. Good, but once again...not unique. Mouthfeel is light bodied with a good amount of carbonation, perfect for the style. Pretty good drinkability, I could follow this one up with another."
"Couldn't wait to sample this on tap. It was a one week wait as it sat in the keg cooler until we had a line for it. The wait was well worth it. Poured in a pint glass from the tap is a must try for anyone. It has good appearance, and a great aroma. That little peppery taste I get is something I have grown to like."
"Overall: If you're judging this to style, it's not even close. That being said, this might be my favorite Surly offering to date. Where the hoppiness in their other brews can be overwhelming, here it seems to balance the spiciness of the Saison. I would've never thought of it, but it works. Go figure."
"I'm in awe. I truly thought the Surly hype was just that but lo and behold this is a pretty fine beer. I greatly look forward to the Bender and Furious compliments of WankerWeasel and the Brews-N-Tunes BIF."
"It's up there with other summer-type brews. I've bought it a couple times."
"Served chilled, in a tall cocktail glass."
"Can courtesy of Stine: Poured a medium amber color ale with a big foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of light pepper, medium sweet malt and some ester and yeasty notes. Sharp note of pepper are noticeable as well as some medium toffee sweet malt and a nice yeasty finish. Body is quite full with some medium filtration and some good carbonation. This beer was well done and I am getting to be more and more impress by the quality of the beers brewed by this brewer."
"This beer poured a cloudy orange/gold with a one finger head  decent lacing, but not persistent. The aroma is sour and a bit yeasty. The taste is spicy and floral. The mouthfeel is thin and carbonated. This is a refreshing beer that is easy to drink."
"D: There just wasnt enough flavor in this one for me. Seems sort of watery. Although Id imagine this would make a great session brew while grilling."
"Slightly hazed deep golden hue. Thin and bubbly dirty white head. Carbonation is active in the body of the beer. Very nice aroma. Big lemon notes. Some honey. Some other fruits in the background. (Apricot?) Fresh yeastiness. Intriguing... Very unique taste. Peppery spicy. Mango like fruitiness. Dried apricots. Slight hop bitterness. Leathery finish. But also dry, hoppy and as quick as the crack of a whip. Nicely carbonated and refreshing feel. Light-medium body. I could see kicking back of a few of these tall boys on the golf course. Or with some grilled salmon steaks."
"I could still wish that this finished a bit drier (my preference is usually for a bone dry Saison), but I feel this is well within the well-made-commercial level. The thing that this really brings home (something that I already knew, but hadn't experienced so drastically in the recent past), was how much ones palate can change in a short period of time."
"Mouthfeel is medium in body."
"Dark golden brown color with a white head that lasted to the end of the glass. Aroma was a hint of belgian hops but toasty malts were the star. The taste at first gave me the same toasted malts (bread like) with a touch of apricot at the end. This beer will be in my fridge all summer long right next to the Furious and Bender (my Surly triple play) extremely good, extremely drinkable. Another home run for Omar, Todd and the rest of the Surly crew."
"D - Very nice drinking brew, enjoyed this one more than Hennepin. I'm very glad Surly decided to can this one and I hope they do it with more of their beers. Surly rules!"
"D - Very easy drinking beer. A Belgian saison with a Surly twist - interesting and refreshing. Definitely worth drinking a couple in one sitting. Not overpowering but more sublime. I'm happy that they've added this to their canned beers - I can see myself drinking many of these in the upcoming hot summer months."
"Hmm seems a little thin on flavor and one dimensional. Nice hoppy backbone melds well with the chewy malt mid palate. Dominated by belgian yeasty quality, white pepper, honey suckle, and other spicey, herbacious qualities, some fruit backing of lemon and peach but not much else. Mouth is thin and bitter on the finish. A little dissapointed in this brew as the others I've tried have been top notch."
"Very dry on the tongue and easy drinking with nice carbonation."
"Many thanks Surlyman!"
"Its funny how I've started to rate things from Surly. I try to be objective, and therefor start by giving them lower scores. But as I keep drinking, I just keep loving their beers more, and give them the high scores they deserve. Another fantastic brew from Minnesota's favorite brewers."
"Yes! Another can from Surly! Since I prefer to do my drinking at home it's great that Surly is canning another of their great beers. This one is another great offering, a little more substantial than a wit bier but still easy to drink. Good stuff."
"Overall: I only had like 2 or 3 pints of this beer when it was out last year, so I decided to review it again. The more I drink of this beer the more I love it. This beer is made using premium ingredients and it shows with its premium complexity. The flavors meld so well, I have nothing to say but really good things about this beer."
"Had several glasses of this at the brewery. Omar said that there were only a few kegs left! Too bad. Lovely hazy candy orange-glazed body with a thick, frothy white head. Looks great! Nose is sweet, almost worty, with prominent yeastiness. Some Belgiany sugar, and spiciness as well. Perhaps a touch too worty. But it tastes better. Sweet, candi-sugarish malt with a full-bodied, coating feel. Nice. Spicy, yeasty kick with rounded, spicy bitterness makes for a refreshing finish. MY kind of summer seasonal, as there's a slightly warming alcohol complexity to this. Give me more!"
"I don't know how they do it. All the Surly beers I have tasted are an almagamation of styles, yet they taste excellent. This beer is no exception. It pours a pleasing amber color with a small white head and some lacing on the glass. The smell is somewhat fruity. The taste-where to begin? One can taste a fruity peach-apricot flavor, along with hints of a plum brandy-like flavor as well as a tart green apple taste. Somehow all the various flavors blend into an exciting whole. The mouthfeel is rich and tasty.This doesn't taste anything like the Belgian saisons I have tried, but Surly makes that a strength rather than a weakness. A terrific beer, whatever the style!"
"Missed on almost all counts for a saison. Needs spice or more creative fermentation, and better use of hops."
"Dvery much so as is the other two Surly brews Ive had. I hope they get the city of Brooklyn Park to allow them to sell growlers, soon. If they start bottling, I might need to get on a liver donor list"
"Solid for style, though would have liked to have let it warm more but had to scoot off for a nearby show."
"Drinkability: Easy drinking, a solid interpretation of the style."
"This Saison from Surly is looking good, although a little more amber then I expected. Bright, clean fresh lemon-lime upfront, but seems to be haunted by slightly heavy hops,although this could be interupted as balance. I am curious to see if this will evolve if or when its brewed again."
"One of the best beer names conceivable, and one of the least apt, in this case. I can't imagine any cause for skepticism, Surly has done it again!"
"Orangish body with a short white head. A complex beer in aroma and taste. Smells of belgian yeast, orange citrus, malts and hops. Flavor begins with corriander and spicey belgian yeast flavor. Moves to a nice firm and sweet malt base and then ends with a bitter hops kick. Its not as light or delicate as the best saisons, but this one's a different breed. Definately not your traditional saison. Surly is a very appropriate name."
"Hopefully this appears in more places because people will (and should) be searching for it."
"I may add to this review as I have more of this in the future, as I know between this and Bender, I will be enjoying a alot more of these while it lasts."
