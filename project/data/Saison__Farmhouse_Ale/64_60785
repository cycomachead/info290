However it is very well crafted and leaves enough room in the overall flavor that the spice in the beer doesn't consume it entirely. I would not recommend it specifically to Saison drinkers, but rather to pale ale and IPA drinkers who are always searching for new hop flavors (specifically herbal ones). This actually does a fair job of scratching the itch for new hop flavors (even though it is predominantly flavored through cooking herbs). I would recommend it.","teromous","Jan 16, 2015"

4.1,8.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled on 6/10/2014. Pours fairly hazy deep golden color with a 1 finger dense and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big lemon, pear, white grape, pepper, clove, herbal, floral, grass, cracker, bread, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, herbal spicing, and pale malt notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, pear, white grape, pepper, clove, herbal, floral, grass, cracker, bread, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy yeast spice/herbal spice flavors on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, pear, white grape, pepper, clove, herbal, floral, grass, cracker, bread, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast, herbal spicing, and pale malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast/spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately crisp, and slightly bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent herbal spiced saison. All around great complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast, herbal spicing, and pale malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 12, 2014"

This beer had ok drinkability, it was fairly smooth, crisp, slightly prickly, dry on the finish, not too filling and the taste doesn't do the best job at holding my attention, one is enough for me, I don't have any urge to drink another one in a row.  What I like the most about this beer was the appearance and aroma, they were both good and I thought the aroma was pretty unique and a little intense.  What I like the least about this beer was the taste and the drinkability, they held this beer back a little and they could use a little work.  I wouldn't buy this beer again, I'm glad I tried it, but it isn't something that I feel the need to revisit anytime soon and I can't say I would recommend it as a great Saison.  All in all I wasn't impressed with this beer, the combination of herbs with this saison wasn't bad, but it wasn't something that really wowed me and in the end I wanted a little more out of this beer.  It's not my favorite Dogfish Head beer and it's for sure not a favorite of the style.  I appreciate the effort it took to make this beer, keep up the solid and unique work.","StoutHunter","Oct 31, 2014"

The spices are not only St. Patrick's Day-friendly, but (Canadian) Thanksgiving as well, so this is a seasonal offering, in a manner of speaking.  At any rate, nice to finally have gotten the chance to hit this particular DFH collaboration.","biboergosum","Oct 01, 2014"

I recall the spices really reminding me more of thanksgiving, maybe just the sage was a bit stronger.  The smells and tastes were never overpowering, but they are muted in this pour.  A decent beer that I can leave until next year's offering to try again.","cjgiant","Sep 23, 2014"

The herbal notes were quite faded, albeit still present. There's much stronger lemon and citrus tastes which really hijack the beer, and change it for the better IMO. If I see anymore of these around I'll snatch a couple to lay down for a year. I'd give it overall a 3.5 fresh and a 4 aged, so for the overall score I met in the middle","lordofstarside","Aug 07, 2014"

Nose is light sweet biscuit and a sugary smell form malt. Then some savory herbal from the herbs that have been added. The nose is open and airy and light. Some hop floral. Taste is excellent. It has a a delicate malt with a soft and silken body. A few bubbles and an overall creaminess. The malt is a sweeetned biscuit and the herbs are prominent. The sage stands out the most and I love sage. They tickle the palate and make you think of herbal teas. The malt sweetness stands side by side with the herbs so that they do not become too pungent or loud in the drink. There is a sweet bit of lemon peel that comes forward as this warms and again in the after taste. This beer has an all over dryness and finishes with a light bitterness in the flavor as much as in the mouthfeel. The sweet lemon resonates in the aftertaste with the herbs. I loved this and thought it was one of the most unique beers I have had in this style.","utopiajane","Aug 04, 2014"

It feels like you are directly smelling parsley and thyme. Very big notes from the earthy herbs. The taste was a little lack-luster though with big herb tastes in the beginning but I felt the ending wasn't as good and the sour taste at the end, while enjoyable, didn't leave a great lingering taste. This was a nice beer to try and appreciate the inventive style of Dogfish, but I don't know if I need more than one.","WhiteHillsStore","Jul 08, 2014"

Flavors are also herby and slightly medicinal. Savory with a sort of savory vegetable aftertaste. Body is very smooth, drinkable and has a nice crispness. Overall this is good, different and quite herby for a saison but I appreciate the unique qualities.","Braz","Mar 20, 2013"

3.78,0.3,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"A turgid golden amber that gives a nice head and has good retention. Lacing is quite nice, and the beer remains covered all the way down. The aroma has a sweet pale malt body and light notes of the herbs used, not as big as the Stone version. A whisper of alcohol and not much funk. Taste is sugar biscuit malty with the herb blend and hops melding into a lovely complex counter to the sweetness of the malt. There is a white grape fruitiness that is great. An alcohol edge flows into the hops and herbs with a touch of mint. Finish is mild and dry with an herbal flavor that leave the blend lightly lingering. Feel is velvety smooth with a lightly creamy carbonation. Easy drinking and just light enough to quaff a little too fast. A nice one and while similar to the Stone version I find this one to be a touch more subtle in its herbs and maybe a touch more alcoholic.","scootny","Dec 29, 2012"

The smell of the beer is herbal, the aromas that come off of it the most of probably the sage, thyme and rosemary. The taste has the same herbal elements that the smell does but it doesn't last as long. The flavors kind of die off in this one in the finish. The mouthfeel of the beer is light bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Overall it's a good brew, I feel the Victory version was a lot more flavorful. I would like to get the Stone version to try that sometime. Regardless it's a decent beer and worth trying.","Knapp85","Dec 29, 2012"

The nose is vegetal and floral, and quite pronounced. The flavor shows typical saison notes (a little bit of sulphur, grainy malt) and a leafy, hay-like quality. The finish is quite dry. There is more carbonation prickliness than seems likely from the pour. Light-bodied, despite a reasonably high alcohol content. A very interesting experimental beer of the "garden" saison type.

3.93,4.2,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"The beer pours a hazy yellow-orange-gold with a light soap bubble head that dissipates quickly and leaves little clouds of lacing on the sides. This is another dehydrated piss-looking beer, and it has some lovely carbonation seen through its murky interior. The beer smells richly biscuity with some lovely subtle spice notes which must surely be parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme. The spices give the nose a slightly minty cool feel, and there is some wet citrus floating at the edges of the smell, which suggest oranges and lemon. The beer tastes surprisingly bananay with the esters, and biscuity with strong citrus undertones. The spice is much softer in the taste, leaving a hint of mint in the aftertaste mixing with the bread and banana esters to suggest a wheat malt backing. Mouthfeel is superbly clean and refreshing, making this an excellent summer beer. The mouth is only barely kissed with saliva after the beer passes, and is ringing with a slight spicy burn that helps to beg for more beer. Carbonation is bubbly and frothy in the mouth which helps the flavoring feel fresh in quick and the mouth, and probably washes away some of the more brutal bite from the spices. This beer reminds me more of a spicy wit than a saison but that isn’t a bad thing. Overall it is a fantastic summer sipper and a lovely collaboration by Dogfish Head, Stone, and Victory. If I can find the other two I will definitely try them, but I’d say Dogfish Head has done this beer well to their company’s name. It is a quirky saison that is more of a wit and definitely worth a sip.","Maxwell","Aug 25, 2012"

Has the typical spicey saison smell, ad a bit of sweet malt and a tad citrus. The flavor starts out alot like a typical delicious saison too, but those subtle herbs swirling around throughout work really nicely. Herbal flowery notes, with the sweetness and the bit of spiciness. This is nice. Enjoyed drinking this one, and could see myself possibly having a couple more before this summer ends.","AngusOg","0"

I was intrigued to see them produce a style that traditionally leans more on spice for flavor. But with DFH and Stone on the label, it had to be hops in the bottle.

At $3.99 per 12oz. bottle, it’s just not within my budget. If you see this on the shelf, I highly recommend grabbing a 6 pack (or at least a couple of bottles).","Morey","Apr 19, 2012"

Aroma of bready malt, sage and other european herbs. Nice intriguing aroma. Flavor follows, with a nice laid back bready malt and complex herbs. I can pick out sage, but the herbal component is well blended and nothing really dominates. The herbal level seems perfect for the malt backbone to support. Thought I detected a hint of funk in the finish, but it may be the herbs. A very nice, medium to heavy body with creaminess.

Aroma - picking up a sharp herbal character from the thyme/rosemary/sage/parsley that was added. Has a bit of a smoked beer hint to it as well. I also notice the farmhouse yeast in there. Flavor - as others have said, just what the description says - imagine a Belgian pale, with added herbs and a bit of farmhouse funk. (not too much of the latter though). The mouthfeel/body is typical for a Saison. Overall, I did not expect much out of this, as I tend not to care for the really 'out there' beer ingredients, but in this case, it is very interesting that all of the elements in this mesh nicely. Good to drink by itself, and I bet this would pair well with mild hors d'oeuvres when entertaining. Now I'm curious about what the Victory and Stone versions are like...","Neorebel","Mar 31, 2012"

Aromas of spearmint, cedar, and pepper on a roasted grain backbone. Flavors are cedar and pine initially, like a moutful of evergreen, with a brightly sweet spearmint kick at the tail end of the palate. Spices abound the more you drink, with a strong rosemary and thyme character dominating. Very green on the palate, if you will. Like knocking a spice rack into the brew. Decnt layered lacing along the glass as you consume. The aftertaste has a touch of malty tang quickly overwhelmed by the spice profile once again, with a quick, tangy finish.

The beer starts with a prominent wheat base from which the fruity character found in the nose builds. Lemon and orange. The spices then enter and dominate the taste with again a large rosemary and thyme character, a little too much for my liking, but not too bad. Earthy pine hop character provides a medium bitterness.

Nice appealing smell and an easy to drink taste. Recommended to try, but probably won't buy again since they only sell in single bottles at my local liquor store.","jaasen64","Mar 15, 2012"
4.27,13.3,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Interesting. It's quite a delicate flavor across the board, despite having a hearty saison core. Some staple flavors are there: lemon, core Belgian yeasts, a very slight touch of funk. The interesting parts come from the herbs. They're all present if you want to focus on it, but work better together for a nice, fresh, herbal undertone that provides a refreshing crispness and a unique take on the saison. Rosemary and thyme linger a bit later, but that's okay :) Tad too much drying until you've been drinking it a bit, but not bad. Pleasant beer. I would eat this with some roasted chicken and root veggies . . . hell yes.","CheezyBlaster","Mar 15, 2012"

Carbonation isn't overwhelming but very noticeable. I feel like it hides the true flavors of the beer, which for what I can detect is a positive aspect. Well done on the mouthfeel of this beverage. A bit drier than other Saison Du Buffs, but it does present more sweet background to play with. I feel like this one hits it stronger on the head for a saison, but still not amazing.

Powerful flavor, earthy, grassy, lots of citrus; despite the amount of spice used, it doesn't come across as being too strong in the spice department.

I admit that I am not yet skilled at recognizing all the qualities of a Saison as I am somewhat new to the style, but at first taste I can tell that I will enjoy this brew. A pleasant tartness is met with creative herbal qualities that I can't quite put my finger on. I can, however, detect the rosemary and thyme. The mouthfeel is much like the few belgian style beers that I've recently started trying, with big carbonation almost like a champagne.

The flavor is again fruity but dry with a bit of crackery malt and plenty of bitterness, there is some cooking spice in there as well that makes for a bracing bitterness at times. The glass finishes somewhat transformed of what it was at first sip, messy and oddly minerally. Oddly this seemed less focused on the cooking spice than did the stone one, however there seemed to be more characteristics identifiable as 'saison' in this one than the stone.

Very light pour with a small 1-2 finger head, minimal lacing, but a small film remains atop the beer as you drink. Much less head and much less lacing than the Stone version. Citrus right up front, with some other herbs. I think I'm getting some rosemary. Good smell. Herbal and hoppy taste, much more smooth than the Stone version on both occasions. IMO it tastes better than the Stone. Smooth and light on the palate, much less carbonated (less punch) than Stone Final Verdict: While Victory looked and smelled better, I did like Stone's as well.

Very yeasty in flavor which is odd because I poured myself a very clear sample. Some black pepper notes going on at the end of the sip. Very acidic feeling. Thin body which is traditional for the style. I wish I had served it colder, and on a really hot day. Liking Victory's and Stone's Saison Du Buff so much, I wanted to like this one, but I had troubles with it.

A giant's tiny misstep is viewed from the lower perspective as an enormous error, a short stumble is seen as a crashing fall. Because saisons are best when balanced, any tipping toward one extreme or another can be a tragedy to the essence of the style--so when a trio of brewing giants makes such an imbalance, it is unfortunately magnified in the mouth and heart of this reviewer.","washingtonydc","Jan 23, 2011"

The smell is a complex mix of spices. The aforementioned spices combine to give it a piny, almost spruce like sappy aroma. The taste too is piney and again reminds me of a sahti.

As with the Stone and Victory versions of this beer, the herbs used in the making of this really shine nicely and compliment the aroma with a nice earthy aroma. The herbs blend together well, but the rosemary is what I can smell the most. The flavor on this one seems to be dominated by the herbs. I can really taste everything and it's finished with a bit of hop bittering. Not bad at all but this one seems heavier on the herb flavor.

4.35,15.4,4,4,4.5,3.5,5,"D/M: Light, crisp, and refreshing that tickles the tongue. Great beer for the season. I like the creativity.","pzrhsau","Aug 28, 2010"
4.12,9.3,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Flavor is complex and runs over the palate satisfying all parts. After the assault of carbonation, there's a citrusy pale ale component, followed by another bright/acidic flavor which is definitely herbal but still doesn't taste specifically of parsley, sage, rosemary, or thyme. The backbone of the beer does have a nice barley malt flavor to it, but the aftertaste is dry and not at all annoying. If I had to guess, I'd say the thyme flavor comes across as the hot variety, rather than the "roast chicken" variety, and the rosemary is really tempered, not at all overpowering as it typically can be. The rosemary beer flavor does actually remind me of CBC's Weekapaug Gruit from a few years back.","hreb","Aug 27, 2010"

3.97,5.3,4,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"D - I like herbs as much as anyone, I grow basil and oregano but the drinkability is not extremely high since the herbs dominate and come off as a bit domineering in this ale. I could see one here or there, but not in regular rotation IMO","Slatetank","Aug 23, 2010"
3.27,-13.3,3,3.5,3.5,2.5,3,"I had an idea mid-way through however. Went to the fridge, grabbed some leftover Chinese noodle and had some dinner with this beer. Made it much more enjoyable to consume with food. A surprising enjoyable brew once married with other food/spice flavors. Not a saison if you ask me but I guess it has to go in some category.","claspada","Aug 22, 2010"

3.82,1.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"D/M: Nice carbonation, early on a lot of small bubbles were being released from the bottom. Has a light mouthfeel, and the 6.8% is hidden very well. I had no problem putting this one down, but I don't know how many I would want to drink in one night. Overall, quite enjoyable.","mdaschaf","Aug 20, 2010"
3.7,-1.9,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Drinkability is average - the herbs are nice in small doses and one to two bottles of this would be very welcome. These flavors would get old given a few of these beers. Definitely a worthwhile experience, but I would prefer a Hennepin when I am in the mood for a Saison.","JayQue","Aug 19, 2010"
4.32,14.6,4,4.5,4,4,5,"This is definitely a light and refreshing beer. The herbs take center stage again, and the sage definitely becomes more apparent in the taste than in the smell. Rosemary still dominates. The citrusy hops come across brightly bitter, and a light yeastiness adds body. The overall feel is light, effervescent and bright. A perfect summer beer, and really enjoyable with Latin fare. Could drink this all summer.","kels","Aug 18, 2010"

3.22,-14.6,4,4.5,2.5,3,3,"Pours a beautiful just hazy yellow orange color. Big head that leaves nice lacing. The aroma is off the wall. More bitterness and parsley and thyme than the stone one. Really has a strong fresh herbal note to it. Really inviting and def has a bit more hop bitterness than the atone version. The taste is not my cup of tea especially in this style which is my favorite. The flavors are stingy, almost rubbing alcohol like with extreme sourness to it that leaves you wincing. Herbs come through but not pleasantly or buttery like the stone version. Mouthfeel is ok. Has an astringent dryness that is off balanced and leaves an extreme tangy aftertaste. Drinkability is limited for me. Really not impressed but a good effort with all these ingredients.","Augustiner719","Aug 16, 2010"

3.88,2.9,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,4,"D - Enjoyed drinking this one and I would definitely get it again when in the mood for a saison. Big and bold enough that it paired well with grilled sockeye salmon and brussel sprouts.","garuda","Aug 12, 2010"
4.5,19.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours with a bllowing bright white cloudy textured head rises well above the rim of my chalice. Slightly hazed bright straw golden color, lacing left behind is fine and intricate. Nose is blasting with rosemary and thyme it smells like somebody just roasted some chicken. Sharp spicy acidity with hints of citric undertones and sweet grassy layers as well. Flavor this one is tasting nice a saison/gruit combo with aromatic/spiy herbal additions. Much more appealing than the Stone version I had, it was so spicy I had a hard time detecting the saison characteristics. This one actually accomplishes the balance that would go nice with a meal using these same aromatic herbs. Citrus combo of herbs/lemongrass/thyme bitterness very green and fresh tasting lively carbonation on the palate helps the flavos not fall flat. Eye opening appeal that brings out the point that what else could be used to spice a beer up instead of straight up hop additions, I like the creativity no boundary approach that went into play when formulating this saison style. Light effervescent carbonation that works nicely with the style body is moderate very killer mouthfeel. Drinkability was easy, no problems consuming this fantastic gruit/saison, can't wait to try Victory's version.","WVbeergeek","Aug 11, 2010"
