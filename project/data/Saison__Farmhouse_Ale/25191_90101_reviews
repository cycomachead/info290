"I'm not normally a fan of Saisons, but this one was fantastic. Just the right balance of sour. I didn't detect any oak."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice tartness and brett funkiness in aroma. Flavor is full of citric acid and a touch of brett funkiness. Lemon sourness and grapefruit tartness complement a modest toasted malt body and light sweetness. Pricepoint is high, but damn good beer."
""
""
"Lots of funk and sour going on.  Didn't detect the oak."
""
""
"First CS, sourness overpowers all funky tastes in this bottle."

"Another outstanding Belgian inspired creation from the masters at Crooked Stave. I have yet to be disappointed by one of their brews. One of my four or five favorite breweries in the US, and probably the only one that can compete with the Belgian giants."
"I am so glad I went back and had this sour beer.  Makes me think about how great they can be"

"O- Very good saison that has all of the farmhouse funk that I love"
""
""
"A lovely example of a soured up take on the style.  So happy to get to try these guys again"

"Overall this is my first ""sour"" beer and I really did not expect it to be as sour as it is.  An interesting style.  Not sure it's my thing."

"O: A delicious saison. Clean and easy to drink, but nothing earth shattering. Just the right amount of funk and tartness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I would most certainly get this again."
"Foggy golden yellow, topped by a small, beautifully creamy white head.  Deeply funky, somewhat acetic aromas featuring musty earth, barnyard, damp hay, oak, and grape.  Flavor is equally funky, but with a larger tart lemon note through the middle, grapes, and grapefruit.  Some wheaty grain and grassy freshness, but mostly bright citrus acidity and funk.  Medium-light with some pretty serious pucker, leaving the gum line dry.  Very nice.  Not exactly something I would consider within the realm of Saison, but good nevertheless."
"Bright, citrusy and very tart saison. One of the best examples I've tried. Picked up a bunch of Crooked Stave when my liquor store began stocking it and, despite the steep price tag, have to say I'm glad I did."
"Overall: Well I'm leaving what I said above to say it all and a little Dazed and Confused reference Alright Aalright, Aaaalllright!!!"
"Taste: Yeah well... okay...just go out and buy all of these that you can find, then mail them to me. K thanks.  Mouth follows the nose.  Tons of lactic and citric acid, tons of orange, tangerine, berry, candy perfection.  Barrel notes, although overshadowed are there to balance out the onslaught of epic flavor.  Borderline divine beer.  So good.  So worth the price.  So worth the drive I'm going to take on Wednesday to get as many as I can get my hands on.  Actually everyone please don't buy any and leave them all for me.  End of review."

"Overall a nice sourish saison, great balanace."
""
"Pours a pale straw color with a white, fizzy head that dissipates quickly. Smells of brettanomyces, lacto, pale malts. tastes nice and sour/tart for a saison, but in an awesome way. Great flavor from start to finish. Pleasant sourness throughout the experience. Mouthfeel is slightly prickly, as saisons tend to be with a smooth finish. Awesome experience overall with this brew. Would definitely seek out again."

"overall: Balanced, quaffable tart, sour ale."
"Might have again; definitely worth a shot (as is most stuff by them) if you ever see it.  (4)"
"Fantastic, and surprising, tart saison. Much closer to a sour than most saisons, but still very easy to drink."
""
""
""
"Great sour apple flavor along with an acidic vinegar note on the nose. Despite being aged in oak barrels, wood notes are muted. Very tart in a pleasing way, don't pass this up if you haven't experimented with sour beers. I love what Crooked Stave can do with a saison, so refreshing to see this take on it."
""
"Wow, great sour, well done"

"Excellent beer. Fantastic really."
""
""
""
""

"O-   Tons of sour and tart taste right in your face. To me this one has some power and kick behind it.  This beer is enjoyable, thirst quenching and delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An excellent saison, delivering a complex flavor profile with a strong sour bite that seems less reliant on hops and more on yeast. Will repeat."

"O-First time trying Crooked Stave. Overall a great saison love the oak. Will get some more."
""
""
"O- Never have I encountered a beer with such a clean/dirty duality in the flavor.  The Brett presence is moderate but impactful as it complements all the other elements present.  Not the best Brett beer I've ever had but it's certainly in the top ten.  This is the first beer I've had by Crooked Stave and I can't wait to seek out more of them."
""
""
"Just a nondescript acidic and sour note with no definition.  Of my recent Crooked Stave get, I looked forward to this the most but ended up the most disappointed.  I have another bottle, so I will be giving it another try, but this left me flat."

"2014 Batch 13. Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is an extremely bright, slightly hazed, straw-gold coloring, with a filmy, wispy, white surface coating of head. Aromas of lemon, apple, honey, and an herbal blend of clove, lemon grass, all spice, and coriander, all on a biscuit backbone, with subtle tart and sour highlights throughout. Flavors are tart and sour forward, with white grape and lemon blending for the sweet characteristics. Spiced wood highlights, with subtle farmhouse funk, cut grass, and earthy notes. Very light and refreshing in mouth, with a tart and sour aftertaste of citrus and white wine notes. Crisp, tart, dry finish. Amazingly well balanced, well crafted beer."

"Mouthfeel - A bit thin.  My bottle had very slight carbonation which I see differs a bit from other reviews.  The flatness of the pour may have effected the taste profile and my review.  I will try to weak out another bottle for comparison someday."
"Very fine soft carbonation, medium low with medium body."
"O: Very enjoyable and a nice example of a saison with brett that is barrel aged. Tart without being overly sour. Very approachable. Nice amounts of complexity."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I recommend it and I would drink it again. It's a great tasting saison that isn't over the top sour, and isn't so mellow that it bores you to death. It's right there in the middle where it should be."
"Overall: One of my favorite saisons yet.  A must try!"

"2014/Batch 12. Outstanding. Big Tartness and Oak"

"375 ml bottle, 2013 Vintage, Batch 8.  Served in a Prairie Teku glass, the beer pours a hazy golden/orange color with about a half inch off-white head.  Head retention and lacing are both good enough.  Aroma is nice, the brew smells like citrus peel, bready/grainy malt, oak, hay, green grapes, and some pear.  I think the taste pretty much follows the aroma, but there's also some tropical fruit and funky/mustiness noticeable.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's easy to drink and has a moderate amount of carbonation.  It's a good tart, fruity and funky brew!  I've enjoyed the few Crooked Stave brews I've had a chance to try so far, and I'll have to make a point to try more in the future!  $8.99 a bottle."

"O - An outstanding and refreshing Saision with a lot of tart, twangy funk."
"O- loved this tart take on a saison"
"2013 batch 4. Poured a hazy orange, with one finger of fluffy white head. Lots of staying power on the head that left some pretty lacing down the glass. Smell was kinda tart and lemony, with a bit of that barnyard funk and some slight sour apple. The taste is pretty sour up front, but then I get some grassy, wheat type flavors. The finish is where this one really stands out, with such a nice woody clean aftertaste. Mmmmm! Nice and dry with just the right carbonation to compliment the tartness. Overall, this beer really stands out, glad I live in Colorado and can find this all the time."
""

"Overall: Really good beer and one of the better values out there for what it is. I'd definitely get this again."

"Overall: I really like the oak characteristics in this brew. Sour notes are rounded yet kept in check. Tasty base beer allows for it to develop well in the barrel. I actually got to enjoy this on tap and I preferred it in that format, but both are excellent. Well done Crooked Stave."
""
""

""

"Beautiful balance of flavors he. It's not overly spiced, yeasty or dry -- just a solid, drinkable Saison. Wish this were in a 750 so I could time how quickly I make it through the bottle. This little one was gone within minutes."
""
""
""
""
"This may be an excellent sour beer, but it's not a Saison. But I'm only being pissy because it makes my teeth hurt. From the 375 ml bottle purchased at Grapevine Liquors. Batch 10/2014."

"If you're into dry, tart funkiness this is something you might want to seek out. I think it's fine for what it is but it's ""charms"" are lost on me."

"O: Wonderful saison. Was hoping for a bit more on the nose, but the tastes more than make up for it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Definitely a beer I will drink again and again :-)"
""
""
"O: More restrained, subtle, and straight-forward than some of Crooked Stave's other work. This one would make a good quaffing beer. I like it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very nice summer saison. Funky with some acidic tartness and has a well rounded body. This brewery has yet to disappoint me."
""
"O - Certainly not your average saison - very tart, but nicely structured. Elegant in a Belgian farmhouse sort of way. Really tasty and well done."

"Overall, we are always happy to try another offering from Crooked Stave, and are happy they finally hit national distribution. This is a bottle of “2013/BATCH 5”, and it certainly doesn’t disappoint. We are most excited about its funky zing right when you take that first sip. This is our second beer of the day, and it still punched the tongue without reserve. The bitterness and tartness of flavor comes from both the yeast strains used and the extended oak barreling, acting synergistically together. Comparing this guy to one of their other national releases, Vielle, it is much, much stronger and muskier, as expected, but drinks a bit slower for the same reasons. This one stays with you, lingering for a long time on the tongue, palate, esophagus, and stomach, but there is a certainly clarity to it that you just don’t find in your typical sour or saison."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very well done ""wild"" saison and one that I will likely pick up every time I run across it on shelves, since it doesn't sit for long. My only regret is that the price is a little hefty for 12.7 oz of beer, but it's nice for a once-in-a-while treat."
"The beer is cloudy and yellow almost moving toward a brown-orange color with a sticky head above. The aroma is tart, unripe apples, berries and a sense of funk. Tart and tangy on the palate. This is a true pleasure to imbibe. The light bread mixes with the Belgian sourness to a create an enjoyable Saison. Of the Saisons brewed in the U.S., this is one of the best that I've had. Great Job!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Just one of the best sours available on the shelves and stands up with world class brews."
""
""
"Overall: Great earthy, brett forward saison. The brett really plays well with the medium bitterness. I wish I had this as an everyday drinker."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is great stuff, doesn't look or smell like an impressive beer is coming, but the palate makes up for it easily."
""
""
"If Crooked Stave made a sour or a saison and named it ""Dog Turds," I would still want to try it. These beers are consistently interesting. Surette has some nice oak, Brett, and fruit flavors. It's a worthwhile cross between a sour and a saison."
""
"Overall: Amazing offering from Crooked Stave. I'd love to see how funky some age makes this beer. Awesome to drink now, will see what some age does. Highly recommend if saisons are your thing."
""
"Very good beer, wouldn't mind trying it again."
"Magnificent beer. I could drink this until life re evolves on Mars."
""
""
""
""
"O: An extremely well-crafted saison with some great notes of Brett and pleasant barrel aging. A real treat to drink, I wish it came it lager bottles even with the high price tag. Definitely worth $9-10 if you can snag some"
""
""
"$9 for a 375 ml. A bit pricey, but worth a look if this style is your thing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"And the trifecta comes to a close. This stuff pours a hazy sunset gold topped by a finger or so of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises thick funk, tart green apple, candied lemon peel, chardonnay must, a hint of oak, and a splash of toffee (can toffee splash...?). The taste focuses on the funk over the sourness, though, make no mistake, there's plenty of pucker lying beneath the funky tarp. Tastiness, indeed, son. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a very nice saison, one that really pulls in those vogue directions of funky and sour. Good times."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I enjoyed this, mainly because it's slightly more tart than the average saison. Still, it's missing a certain X factor to make it great - maybe it's the lack of carbonation, or the fact that the brett notes are rather generic. Overhyped and overpriced; I pray that this isn't going to be a trend with future Crooked Stave beers."

"Pours a clear, gold color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of tartness, slight apple, slight pale malt, hint of sweet malt, hint of hop, and a hint of alcohol. Fits the style of a Saison / Farmhouse Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. There is also a strong tartness. Tastes of pale malt, slight sweet malt, hint of hop, slight citrus, and sourness. Overall, good appearance, aroma, feel, and body."

"Batch 8, 2013. Bottle from Bottle Barn on my California trip. Pours clear dark copper colored with a small creamy white head. Tart citrusy aroma, sour apples, tart cherries, lots of bright things to like on the aroma. Flavor is sweet wheaty grains, hay, some light oak, vinous notes, a little yeast funk and light tartness. Bit of a dirty wheat-like finish. Slick and on the heavier side for my tastes in the style. Low carbonation, really needs a good bit more. Not really what I was expecting here."
""
""
""
"Moderately dark brown in color and is mostly hazy. Just a trace of white foam on the top. I get white Chardonnay and oak in the nose. The body is fairly light and the tartness prickles the tongue. The taste is a lightly tart white Chardonnay and oak. This is very crisp and refreshing and with plenty of flavor."

"Pours a murky amber, dense but fast fading white head, sheet of delicate lace down the glass. Smell: fleeting grainy and barnyard note then acetic and fruity - nectarine, white raisin - mingled with herbal and vanilla pops. Taste: a little caramel, nectarine, spicy and herbal hopping, lemon, funky aspects of brett, finishing grainy and tart. Really excellent. 2013 batch 4."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall pretty nice, great Brett c tropical fruit and little funk, decent malts, very enjoyable."
""
""
""
"O - Overall, this was a delicious saison. Love the brett."
""
""
""
""
"O: Expecting more funk, perhaps some age would add."
""
""
""
"Pretty tasty; powerful white grape notes dominate the smell and taste, and there's an odd twang in the taste that I don't really like."
"Pour is a hazed bright amber with a white bubbly head. Nose is lactic, light soap, tart lemon with moderate oakiness. Taste strong oak, lactic notes and faintly soapy. Very dry, tart lemon finish and biting on the tongue, thin in back. The strong soap with the lactic acid and assertive barrel don't mesh well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is another one of the well balanced and flavorful saison that makes CS such a great brewery. There is complexity here as it has both nice funk and tartness that balances very well."
""
""
""
""
"An enjoyable first endeavor. Easy drinking pseudosoursaison. Barrel influence runs a tad heavy, but it's good and worth drinking again. *hint*"
""
""
"Overall. Crisp and refreshing but with enough body, flavour, and complexity to satisfy. Diggin' it."
""
"Overall this is a very enjoyable brew with a range of flavors. Certainly not your standard saison."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very drinkable and the flavors are big but not fatiguing at all like sours can be. Good blend of tart lactic and fruity spicy Saison yeast."
"O: This beer has a nice mix of tartness and sourness, neither of which is overpowering, that add to the complexity of the smell and taste. It is a pleasant beer to sip and savor."
""
""
""
""
""
"A really nice saison, a great beginner sour beer, sour, but not overly so, and light on the funk. Great drinkability."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured golden orange in color with a light head that dissipates quickly. The smell is divine with a distinct tart fruit aroma (apple and lemon). Good carbonation and the beer overwhelms your mouth with each sip. The taste is tart, and you get some barrel. The beer finishes dry with a citrus tang."
"On the lighter end of medium body with a tart, puckering mouthfeel and prominent acidic sourness that lingers over the earthier flavors and vinous barrel notes into a dry, acetic finish. Feels more like an American wild ale with little saison character to speak of. There is some funk but I'm guessing it's from the bugs and acidity. Vinous barrel presence really stands out with dry oak and sweeter fruit notes, especially apricot and dark berries. Lots of zesty lemon acidity dominating the flavor with lingering acetic vinegar in the finish. Not harsh or solvent like but makes the beer feel a bit one dimensional. Pretty much just tart citrus acidity, dry oak, subtle vinous fruit and lingering acetic acid. Refreshing and somewhat drinkable but not very complex or interesting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Really good beer that lacks a certain je ne sais quoi in order to be considered great. Definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
""
"Pours hazy golden / orange with almost no head. The aroma has chardonnay, buttery oak, red berries, saison earthiness, light nectar fruit and a very rustic edge to all of it. It has a medium / light crisp body with some fairly sharp carbonation. The flavor begins with vanilla, oak, nectar fruit, funk, spice, berries, graininess and dry malt. The finish is dry, earthy and vinous and a little thin. Great saison."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D - Nice stuff. Good tartness and nice to sip on."
""
""
""

"Great saison yeast presence with softness and light peppery spice. Light fruitiness with tart apple, pear, and lemon. Some tannic fruit skin flavors. Some good breadiness and a righteous tartness with Bretty funk and mild horse blanket. A little cheesy, but smooth. Excellent refreshing feel with a light-medium body and a well-diffused carb presence. Awesome saison."
""
"Poured a beautiful light brown opaque body with thin white head. Bubbles dispersed fairly quickly. Reminiscent of apple cider vinegar on the nose, which nicely cleared up my sinuses! Taste is a very clean balance of bitter and tart, reminiscent of an unsweetened Arnold Palmer. Despite the tartness, a very smooth finish makes this a highly drinkable beer. One of my favorites, I wish I could drink it every day."
""
"Overall this is another exceptional beer from Crooked Stave. This is a great saison, mostly because of the tart flavor and wild yeast characteristics. A very vinuous beer"
""
""
"A great shelf saison. I would buy this fairly frequently if Crooked Stave made it to Wisconsin. Unfortunately it does not, but I would recommend buying this if you are looking for a very good everyday saison."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-A wonderful tart beer. Not quite sour but tart. Still yummy, with good balance."
"T: Light and tart with some lemon, hay, grass, sour kumquat, white pepper, oak, and a good amount of brett. Might be the best I've had from them so far."
""
""
""
""
"Between the two, I much preferred batch #7. Interesting to see the variation between the batches."
""
""
""
""
""

"O: This is pretty tasty. Easy to drink with great flavors. Well-done, recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Flavor profile is a bit more muddled. Starts off pretty funky with some mild tartness that is definitely more vinous than the nose would indicate. Pleasant mild tar notes envelop some of the vinous character with some mild citrusy and lemony acidity. There is definitely some underlain funk and musty wood notes that make the brew very refreshing. Mouthfeel is light and carbonation is light. Might benefit from some more bubbles. Overall this brew taste yummy. The vinous character shows up really well and blends nicely with the woody funk."

"I really want to have this on a warm day out in the sun - this is a Fall appropriate beer that is still screaming to be consumed during the warmer months of the year. So far, this has been my favorite Crooked Stave offering to date. It's really flavorful, juicy, funky stuff while still being wholly accessible in the end. Can't recommend it enough!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M - Medium body and very dry. Light carbonation."
""
""
""
"A very intense Saison to say the least. The level of tartness really pushes the boundaries of a Saison, but still retains enough of the trademark Saison spiciness to stay within the style's guidelines. The mature and developed Brettanomyces character really adds some nice contrast to the tart, lactic acidity of this beer. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An exceptionally well crafted Saison with a fair amount of the Brett and barrel sourness to it. There is a light oak character to the nose and flavor and very dry making for a very food friendly beer."

"Pours an almost-clear golden color with a large white head that goes down quickly. Scent is funky as all hell. Such barnyard funk, it reminds me of a good batch of Fantome Saison. A ton of hay and barnyard yeast aromas with some tart wild yeast. Lots of Brett. Some green apple with more citrus and hay. Taste is like a traditional saison up front, but then it quickly becomes something as amazing as a Fantome saison (on a good batch). That amazing tart flavor up front that quickly become peppery spiciness and lemon zest. Funky horse blanket and barnyard hay with citrus fruits and pepper. Super dry finish. Mouthfeel is dry and refreshing...a little on the ""juicy"" side for a saison. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this is one of the best American-made saisons I've ever had."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is just another 375ml reason why Crooked Stave rocks! This really shows how focusing your graduate school research on Brettanomyces fermentation can, will and has payed off. Highly recommend this brew to any Brett head and Saison fanatic."
""
"A nice fruity and oaky sessionable Saison. Not incredibly complex but certainly tasty. I wish Crooked Stave would mix it up with their regular offerings. These beers would be perfect for fruit and wine barrel treatments."
"O: First Crooked Stave offering and very impressed. A sour ale I could drink all day. Approachable, yet just complex enough."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Nice aside from the metallic flavor. Very malty, not what I expected."
""
"A fantastic and tasty saison. It's got a lot more funk than most saisons; even Famtone. But it works and probably more closely reflects the original historical product. Crooked Stave has a good thing going. I'd love to see more of this kind of creativity and commitment."

"O – This is a really nice beer. I would almost rather call it a wild ale than a saison (not that it matters) due to its serious tartness. There’s lots of tart fruit and lots of Brett in this one. A really, really tasty beer. Thanks so much for this one and the rest of the Crooked Stave beers, Jared!"
""
"O: WOW. This just hit KY and I was very surprised how much I enjoyed this ale. I did not know it was a sour, so I liked it even more. This is definably recommended for fans of sours and saisons. I thought it was lightly carbonated, but it made me a little burpy. Outstanding."

"As much as I love the funk, and this certainly has it, I also appreciate some level of balance. This doesn't have much of that. Punch in the mouth wild ale flavor. Vinegar tones. Minimal earthy edges. Not much more than a blast of funky yeast. Reminds me of a lot of Jolly Pumpkin."

"O - I'm new to trying the offerings of Crooked Stave, but the level of sour ales they are producing is on point. If I were ever introducing someone to the style, I would probably start here to really bring them in. Everything a sour farmhouse ale should have is provided here in full. Quite impressed."

"Pours yellow-orange and cloudy. Looks like it could be a bit clearer with better bottle handling; I'd be a terrible bartender. Medium white head. Some lacing and pretty good retention. There's a thin layer of bubbles on top of the beer after a fair bit of time. The aroma is big on lemons, limes, underripe apricots, cherries and peaches, grapes, oak, earth, medium to mild funk and a nice dash of saison yeast spice. Smells nice and tart. There's a bit of yogurty flavor in there, but it comes off more fruity sour than anything. Taste starts out with limes and sour grapes and keeps building up with more tart fruit. Underripe stone fruit is prominent. Funk is somewhat more in the background, but there's a definite musty, barnyard-ish character in there. Quite dry, particularly in the finish. Aftertaste is tannic oak, lime rind, peppercorns, grass and light vinegar. Lots of tart fruit flavors bouncing around. It's only medium sour, and it's a pretty gentle ride, really. Light on the palate. Some pucker, though you do feel the vinegar on your teeth after a glass. Another very good bottle from CS."

"Super quaffable and refreshing exactly what a saison should be. Plain and simple but dare I say elegant in its balance."
" Overall: Really tasty, with a moderate level of tartness."

"Its another stellar wood aged and intentionally soured ale by Crooked Stave. These guys are spot on! I would love to sit down with a couple of these ales and a pot of mussels. Talkin' about dying happy!"
"Pours a golden hazed ale with a solid quilt of loose whites. Smells funky with a bit of lemon and some oak, and some pear as well. Flavor is slightly tart, with some cherry, lemon and apple juice, some grain and a touch of bitter. Thin with a moderate carb and a wet finish. Good stuff."

"O: Refreshingly tart and lightly funky. It's very good but not quite great. Nonetheless though, another very solid offering from Crooked Stave."
"Overall- Everything feels likes it's exactly where it belongs, and in the perfect amounts. Nothing is overwhelming, and I'm not looking for more of any aspect in this beer. Seriously impressed with this, I'm very much looking forward to trying more CS stuff."

"Overall- Damn near perfect. Akin to a tarter Arthur, but still unique in its own right. Phenomonal."

"Another tart saison from these folks. A little sweet with a big white grape presence."

"This is a light bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. Overall it is easy drinking with minimal alcohol impact but the overall arrangement of character was a bit awkward for a saison. I am admittedly not a fan of vinegar in any beer, especially saisons and that was a pretty significant role in this brew."

"O. I bought a 12.7 ounce bottle for $13, though I heard there are places in NYC that sell it for $10. Much like the Hop Savant that I had, this is a good beer though the price is a bit steep. I like a bit more than the Savant, though two different styles."

"o - overall, crooked stave has proven to be a brewery to watch. this was a really nice beer that feels like it might sour up really nicely over time. pretty good out of the gate, but a bit subdued. glad i have a few of these."

"O: My first bottle by Crooked Stave. I'm impressed by this ""saison"" beer. Quite refreshing for a tart and funky beer! Will try to get this item again."

"Pours a murky orange with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, and sour aromas. Taste is much the same with some sour fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."

"375ml bottle $6.99. Bright yellow-orange color, decent head that disappeared quickly, looks nice in a wine glass. Aroma is pretty much all brett to me, a bit of that animal funk and a tinge of lemon, not bad. Flavor is more brett and it does have a slight tartness to it as described on the label. Overall this was a decent beer but I just think most of the Crooked Stave beers are priced higher than the quality of the beer."
""
"i really like this saison. a very refreshing and flavorful beer. quite funky, but i can't really tell if there is brett in this or not. you don't taste much of the oak barrel aging either, but that's usually the case in the recent handful of sours i've had.. though this is not a sour. definitely one of the better saisons i've had."
""
""
"O: If you like Brett, this one is all about it. If you don't, you may want to consider another beer. In the end, I enjoyed this one as it has a bit more punch than the typical Saison, but doesn't overdue it."
"This poured out as a lightly hazy yellowish orange color with a white head on top. The retention is thin and the lacing is lightly scattered. The smell is funky, there is a plenty of lemon and fresh oak aromas. The taste is tart, it's very earthy in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is light bodied with a good carbonation. It's a juicy brew with a dry finish. Overall it's a pretty good brew. Worth trying."
"7.5/10"

"O - Light and refreshing with a slightl tart Belgian yeast and funk."
"O: Nicely done. No major complaints besides letting the breet chill out for about 6 months and maybe the baby diaper will pass on."

"Served in Crooked Stave barrel room. Appearance is slightly cloudy and a yellowish orange. Thin layer of white head with some lacing and decent retention. The nose is a little less funky than the vieille but still has a funky farmhouse/barnyard quality. Some oaky acid quality with lemon and peppery spice. Taste is somewhat tart up on the ont and followed by citrus and funk. Mouthfeel is light and highly carbonated. Overall, very nice Saison with some unique qualities."
"O: This is my first experience with Crooked Stave and I am impressed, but definitely more excited to come back for more. If this is notable of their general offerings I will most definitely be back in the future. This is a really solid saison with a proper use of brett it is not unbelievable but solid and very well done I recommend this beer."

"A very good saison. The odd smell is the only major flaw I perceived."
"May not buy it again because I admit that sours aren't my favorite style. But especailly on pouring the lees, this one grows on me."
"Pours a hazy yellowish-golden with a fiery orange hue and a nice white head. Aroma offers some funky hay, sweet fruity sugars and a liitle oak. Flavor offers mild funk, wheat malt,sweet juicy fresh pulped oranges on top of a slightly tart lemon, a a kiss of some oak. A somewhat crisp, somewhat creamy mouthfeel. Overall, another solid brew from Crooked Stave. Probably my favorite variation of the Surette and definitely glad to have tried. Realy digging the smaller bottle format too."
""
"Overall: Another nice saison by Crooked Stave. I really got nothing, but good things to say about this brewery! I would consider this to be a soured saison. Its a really enjoyable beer."

"another winner from crooked stave. the surette is taking on all kinds of new forms, and this one I like a lot. also a surprisingly affordable bottle for them at under 7 bucks. the pour is a bright yellow color like the sun, fogged a little with yeast sediment, but really glowing. there is a few inches of well retained white head too. the nose is bretty and funky, but probably not as sour as some other versions, particularly the reserva version. there is a springtime sort of cut hay vibe to this, with some pucker citrus sour on the back end. the flavor is well rounded, with light wheat malt and some white grape acidic flavor too. herbal on the hop front, and indeed quite sour in the finish. the finish is really dry, which I like a lot. light in feel, but interesting as anything they make. upbeat carbonation and a signature crooked stave sourness that leaves me wanting another bottle. not my favorite in the surette line, but a fine example of the style. bravo, once again."
"O-Although this is a decent saison, with some nice flavors and an above-average mouthfeel, this is far from the most intriguing beer I have had from Crooked Stave. It lacks the complexity and intrigue of the old-world styles and it isn't exactly a hit-you-on-the-head new-world monster (with tons of flavor or pucker power). Instead, this is a decent effort, but nothing I need to search out."
""
"Cloudy, orange-yellow brew, frothy white pillowy head. no lacing at all. Farmy, light lemon and orange, soft, smooth, buttery, oaky. Dry, bitter, oak, smooth, tons of horseblanket, not too much fruit, no tartness either, high carbonation. Lots of chardonnay. Recommended, just not as a sour. It could be more rounded to provide better flow and blending.."
