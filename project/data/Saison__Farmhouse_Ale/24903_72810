Aroma is heavy on the Brett funk, with grass, floral hops, and lightly bready malt sweetness.  I also get some orange zest.  Taste is again with the brett funk up front, some citrus zestiness, very faint watermelon and fairly floral.  There's a nice deep oakiness that works behind everything; but holds it's own.  Light body, tart and bright on the tongue.  Bubbly med-high carbonation.","mverity","Feb 14, 2015"

My only qualm is with the finish, which has a lingering bitterness that cuts against the integrated harmony of the rest of the beer. Not a huge deal, but enough to keep me from elevating this beer into the heights of the pantheon.","Georgiabeer","Jan 27, 2015"

Smell: citrus peel, moldy overripe peaches, floral, musty, with grape skin and red wine vinegar notes. Taste: moderately acidic with big flavors... herbal and woody, bitter orange; beneath some sweet and sour fruit balance... unripe peach, melon note, sugared dried mango.  Some snappy grain character quickly overwhelmed by red wine grapes and pepper. Interesting composition, with all of the components dialed up and dialed in. Really nice.","babaracas","0"

Huge Brett aroma, orange peels, lots of floral and peppery notes, barnyard funky and dry. Not a lot of wine on the nose. Flavor is sweet mango intermingled with rose hips, citrus, funk, and light peppery spice. Lightly tart from the Brett, full bodied with a vinous red wine heaviness, but strong carbonation. Wow. This might be the best Brett beer I've ever had. The big juiciness of the beer balances out the dry funky Brett outstandingly.","BMMillsy","Nov 09, 2014"

Orange-yellow color, small but visible head and a bit of lace. The nose is really incredible in how intriguing it is. I knew right away I liked it but I just have to keep inhaling away to try and figure out what I smell. This beer sets the standard for complex aromas. Its sort of perfume, candy, a touch of brett hiding in the back, slightly earthy, slight touch of alcohol. After reading the bottle it came to me. It's the rose hips. The taste is pretty damn crazy too, funky with sweet, sour, and bitter all in equal portions. Unique. Surprisingly pleasant. This one is fit for a very special occasion.","chickenflea","Jul 29, 2013"

In the initial taste, one detects notes of mango, pineapple, tart apples, a hint of sour candy, and the barnyard funk that is emblematic of the style. As the taste evolves into a dry tart apple taste the aftertaste. The mouthfeel proves to be smooth and perhaps a little sticky. One may find his/herself wishing the taste would linger a little longer. If the staying power disappoints, just buy another bottle. This is really good stuff.","JohnnyHopps","May 26, 2013"

Lightly tart, quite bitter, medicinal, some bitter orange peel, a little bit of tart and the aftertaste is really grassy and filthy to me. Medium bodied on full with low carb and dry finish.

Aroma of Brett is dominant with some notes of rustic malt and some citrus notes and some vinous notes as well. Taste is a complex mix between some Brett notes with a dry aftertaste mix in with citrusy hoppy notes and some vinous notes which work very well altogether. Body is about average with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Again lots of flavour that are very well balanced.

Juicy citrus and tart fruit sticks to the tip of the tongue and stays there. Here is where the Brett reveals itself, but it's not super funky. Lingering peppery bitterness, drying wood, flower petals, and earth. Some wine-like tannins perhaps, but the Pinot doesn't really come through in any significant way. Very dry and quite tart, yet soft and fluffy in the mouth. With the rose hips, peppercorns, orange peels, dry hopping, barrel aging, and wild yeast, this could be a total mess in other hands.

The smell of citrus is delightfully simple and dominating. Immediately puckering on the palate, citrus and tartness follow. A bit peppery indeed but lacking the ""caramel beauty"" promised on the bottle. Simple, tart and perhaps better paired than alone, Love Buzz neither impresses nor disappoints.

Orange-yellow color, small but visible head ans a bit of lace. The nose is really incredible in how intriguing it is. I knew right away I liked it but I just have to keep inhaling away to try and figure out what I smell. Its sort of perfume, candy, a touch of brett hiding in the back, slightly earthy, slight touch of alcohol. Great aroma. The taste is pretty damn crazy too, sort of sweet, dry, some orange, pretty good. I must say these Anchorage beers are quite unique and while they seem expensive at first they are actually priced less than Russian River and about equal to Jolly Pumpkin and I'd say the quality is not questionable.

It looked clear and amber, with some red in it. But it was only the first glass which was clear, the deeper I got into the bottle the more turbid the liquid became, because the yeast was in the bottom of the bottle. I smelled it and the aromas of rose hips and some funk revealed itself. The first sips were wonderful, the rose hips were really prominent and some nice, fruity sweetness was there too. In the end a nice, rather special, bitterness took hold. The beer continued in the same elegant fashion. It had juice-like qualities and some real freshness to it. The brett is there and provides dryness in the aftertaste and some subtle sourness, and also some funny flavors once in a while. The mouthfel was light and the beer was easy drinking. Drank a whole 750 ml for myself, never feeling it was too much. Overall, a beer different than the rest, it was more alive and kicking than most other Saisons.","egohepar","Mar 13, 2012"

Taste doesn't really provide the sourness I anticipated, but still offers sweet lemons, more brett, fantastic citrus/fruity notes (great hop profile here). A touch of green olive and oak. Good effervescence on the palte, more of a sweeter saison and doesn't really have that tart/puckering sensation that I had predicted based on the nose.

Smell- Pinot Grapes, Orange peel, coriander, ginger, pineapple, tart bretty funk. This is a really complex aroma, a lot going on. Taste- on the first sip, as it hits the roof of my mouth, I get a funky blast of wet hay mingled with some sour orange/tropical fruit flavors. This is a very fruity and funky saison- the wine notes from the pinot are present as well. There is a cracked pepper note as well in there. This is a great saison. Incredibly unique and creative, the flavors are balanced and the brett delivers a nice funkiness as well.

Lovely french oak flavors with very noticeable Brett and barnyard flavors. The pinot noir is more noticeable as it warms. Quite a hoppy saison also. Finish spicy, bitter, and a little tart.

Much more so than I expected resulting in a dryness that is exaggerated by the berrel notes. Dry toasted oak with a faint vinous red wine character that gives off hints of grape, strawberry and other dark fruits. Pretty complex but the funk/brett donates slightly overpowering the eatery fruit notes and Pinot noir elements. Pretty good with a well masked ABV but could use bit more balance.

While the Brett character is quite nice, it's a bit one dimensional and I would have liked to get a bit more spice. As it warms further, some of the wine comes out, but still none of the other additions. Light-medium body with good carbonation and a very dry finish. Brett heavy. Good, but not fantastic.","Thorpe429","Sep 30, 2011"

Beautifully balanced and deeply flavored, this beer is among the best. Drink it fresh if possible.","flannelman808","Sep 27, 2011"

3.93,-8,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Sweet and sour, acidic, tangy, fruity. You can pile on the adjectives. Pineapple and herbal tea. Beautiful long-lasting head on a cloudy golden brew. Quite aromatic and spicy in the nose. Gets more bitter as you sip.","mactrail","Sep 23, 2011"
4.24,-0.7,4,5,4,4,4,"This bottle was sampled during the South Carolina tasting, It pours a nice cloudy dull Orange in color with a very soapy head that turned into a white lacing around my glass. It smells of fresh mangos and tangerines with little spice or wine influence but it smells spectacular. It instantly reminded me of Guava Grove. The flavors are somewhat chalky and very dry. I get some rose or hibiscus as well. The brett makes itself known. It drinks light, grainy, and dry. Overall its a solid saison and pretty good overall. It's a nice beer to share but I couldn't drink a whole one by myself.","aasher","Sep 23, 2011"
4.06,-4.9,5,4,4,4,4,"O: Anchorage Brewing, how I love thee. Winners popping up every time so far. I prefer to think of this as Bitter Monk Lite. It's not really a saison by the everyday definition but neither is the Monk a DIPA by the usual definition. A very good beer, but I'd take Bitter Monk instead next time. 4/5","hopsbreath","Sep 04, 2011"
4.64,8.7,4,5,4.5,4,5,"Bottle (Batch #1, August 2011). Basic review: Pours with a hazy, deepish gold body with a large and lasting, fluffy off-white head. Great lace. Aromas amazingly good! Right off the bat: fresh tangerine/grapefruit juice. Good acidity, a little funk, red wine, tropical fruit hop notes, CITRA! Smells a little bit like Le Terroir with the hop and funk note. Sweet, perfume, floral, estery. Light bready malt. Very fragrant, pineapple. Amazing! Flavors are funky as well, juicy, oak, barrel, red wine, fruit, a bit grassy. A touch grainy, bready and straw like. Surprisingly bitter (both hop and tannin). Nice tropical fruit, grassy hop notes, rich, delicate, lots of nice tropical brett C esters. Lingering, slightly acidic stonefruit. Blown away, this is OUTSTANDING! Lively, playful carbonation, lingering funk, nice tannin, lightly warming, creamy bubbles. Balanced and complex. This might be one of my new favorite breweries, and one of the top 5 beers I've had so far this year.","BMan1113VR","Beers"
