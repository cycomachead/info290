Hints of overripe citrus and stonefruit, slightly bready character, peppery yeast notes summing the aromas up. Overarching peppery yeast notes on the taste. Subtle peach and apricot are really quite pleasant. Slight metallic taste on the finish. Crisp and refreshing, minor lingering flavors (the metallic finish too unfortunately)... still wanted that next sip! Enjoying Prairie's simple, clean takes on classic styles. Very good brew. Might not need to buy THIS one again, but growing increasingly impressed with PAA.","Mikus","Saturday at 03:38 PM"

4,6.1,4,4,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 10/7/2014. Pours lightly hazy bright golden color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, lime, orange peel, pear, pepper, wheat, cracker, herbal, straw, grass, light funk and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, earthy hops, and light pale malt notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, lime, orange peel, pear, pepper, wheat, cracker, bread, herbal, straw, grass, light funk, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, lime, orange peel, pear, pepper, wheat, cracker, bread, herbal, straw, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and robustness of fruity/spicy yeast, earthy hops, and pale malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and fairly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.4%. Overall this is a damn nice session saison style. All around great balance, robustness, and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, earthy hops, and pale malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 15, 2014"

Aroma of lots of hay and grass, light lemon peel, rustic dusty yeast, a hint of apple, and more dried out grass. So light and refreshing smelling. Flavor is hay, very (very!) light citrus rind, dry hops, yeast, and a bit of a pilsner character. Super light bodied with lots of carbonation. Thirst quenching even.

It’s dynamic, too, showing different aspects at different times, depending on vessel and temperature.

Flavor is very much in the farmhouse style with lemons, bananas, white pepper, clove and other spices mixed with soft sweet grains to make it a perfect balance.

Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, spice, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with slightly tart grain, yeast, and spice flavors on the finish.

4,6.1,3.5,4,4,4.25,4,"birra is a cross between a classic saison type and a hefe, a big fruity robust unfiltered wheat designed for all day drinking. instead of banana though, the most evident fruit is lemon, a beautiful hop profile as citrusy as ive seen in a wheat beer. lots of sediment in the pale hazy beer, some chunks and some haze, two inches of heavy off white head. fresh cereal grains and the lemon zest comprise the aroma, with not too much yeast to speak of, but the flavor brings a lot of yeast, a subtle spice complex, and an impressive degree of refreshment. the lemon cuts the cloudy yeasty beer to something not way different from a good shandy. the body is larger and the carbonation is softer, but the same flavor profile is sort of there, only wheat beer base instead of standard lager. a craft beer drinkers summer drink, this needs a bit more meat for wider seasonal applicability. i love the finish too, with the best of the grain and the hops, a very delicate but full flavored beer that is in line with the quality of prairies other offerings.","StonedTrippin","Feb 16, 2014"

They describe this as more session-able than the Standard, but the 1% difference in ABV doesn't really do much to make it more session-able, really. Still, at $2.25 a bottle after tax at my local liquor store, it's still a steal. This may be the worst beer I've had from prairie, but it's still better than 80% of what's out there. This brewery continues to put out phenomenal products and really deserves more recognition. keep up the good work.","zerocrane","0"
