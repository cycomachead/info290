"O - Very good saison with a little twist.  This bottle is almost a year old now and is tasting just like they said it would."

"Nice spring saison. Tastes like there's a bright golden haze on the meadow."
"Overall, I think this is a wonderful Saison that I would be happy to drink again."

"The taste follows suit with an earthy, bready character, a touch of spice, but mainly a very expressive Belgian yeast strain. Borders on tart but never really gets there. Medium bodied, highly carbonated feel. Overall, this is a really solid Belgian style ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a really drinkable, and very enjoyable saison. There's a cleanness to the funk, and a smoothness from the additional sweetness. The peach character is what sets it apart, and it's a fine character for a saison. Very nice indeed."

"Overall: The spice is really nice on this not too harsh where it kills the taste just a nice smooth brew all the way through."

"o: first thing i noticed when tasting was that i wished it had the same spice presence in the flavor as it had in the nose. some coriander in the flavor would have really made this pop. all the flavors in here are nice, and this is a seriously good drinker - would have just like some spice & some more funk to harmonize the sweet green fruits. that being said, this is still quite delicious"

"A good Saison for sure. I’d have it again."

"Overall: Pretty solid Saison with a little funk and tart to it. I dig it."

""
"Overall - Nice juxtaposition of flavors."
""
""
""
""
"Drinks more like a hoppy Trippel if you ask me…which is probably why I am digging this."
"O: Love this saison, one of my favorites for the reason it is strictly just a simply brewed saison nothing extra. Everything that comes through in the flavor and smell is from the yeast doing its marvelous job."
""

"Pleasant and enjoyable."

"Overall not bad but very little Brett. Age didn't seem to do much."
"O - Overall, this was a fun beer, the brett is a bit too soft for me. Still, nice to see where this beer goes."
""
""
""
""
""
"Terrific!"
""
""
""

"Pours pale golden yellow with a large soapy white head. Smells like hay with a bit of citrus and solid barnyard funkiness. Taste is a bit dry with some mild bitter citrus and hay funk and a subtle touch of sweetness behind it all for balance. Medium-bodied with a crisp texture and active mouth-carbonation, Lost Abbey Carnevale finishes wtih a drying, almost woody sensation."
"Overall: A very solid brew. The brettanomyces add a nice extra level in the aroma mainly with some accents on the taste. Maybe with some more time the yeasty funkiness will come out some more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall an impressive beer even though I do not detect any Brett qualities."

"The flavor begins with raw grain flavor. Not as sour as most Saisons. Strong black pepper finish. This is an easier Saison than most to drink. There's nothing over-the-top about this except the long aftertaste. The body leans to the thin side like most of this style. The carbonation is very high."
""
"O: this one let me down. thought the appearance and the smell was terrific, but it completely misses the mark in my book on the mouthfeel."
"This is a real easy drinking saison from Lost Abbey. It always surprises me that their regular offerings are so interesting and enjoyable."
"Good choice by me."

"Slightly hazy, golden colored brew. Champaign-like effervescence is notable in the the appearance. A floral funk and tartness is notable...some earthy barnyard and appleskin scents stand out. The taste is on the sweet side, with the tartness and funk alongside. Sugar in the mid taste. Full in body and a solid bitterness in the finish."
""
""
"Smells sour fruity and initial pour has massive white head that lingers for a while. A bit dissappinted with first sip that tasted watery but got better with the second sip and tasted some good slightly bitter fruits and a lingering taste in a good way. It's good, not great but I'd drink it again"

"overall, a very decent brew. emulates the belgian sister very well. rich, fruity. huge head."
""
""
""
"this is as much a tripel as it is a saison, a beautiful marriage of the two. the pour is hazy and golden, with just a finger or two of white lasting head that leaves wedding style rings on the edges of the chalice. the nose is sweet and yeasty, big high gravity malt body with some attitude, also more booze than it really is comes through. I taste Belgian cultured yeast before any farmhouse funk, and there is that malty sweetness of a classic tripel, cornsyrupy in a good way and lots of carbonation and body. this is sort of a genre bender, dry and sweet both, unusual in that way. maybe a little overpriced, but its complexity is appreciated here. really round and smooth in the feel, I wish it would quit straddling the fence between a farmy saison and a sugary tripel, it cant quite decide, and that hurts it a little. this is a beer without a true identity, but one with plenty of unique flavors and a mind of its own. on tap at cheeky monk on Colfax for more than its worth, but it tastes good and itll drink forever. lost abbey is back."
"Cloudy straw-yellow pour, with a huge puff of white head that took a while to settle to a servable size, but was pretty tame after that. Barnyard funk in the nose, hints of citrus pith and fruity esters. Funky taste, echoing the aroma, toasted grains, notes of peppery spice and citrus pith. Light-medium body, with a dry, bitter aftertaste. Pretty typical for the style all around. If you like standard saisons, you'll like this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - slightly more bitter than the typical Saison. The flavor isn't quite as interesting as the wonderful aroma. Overall, it was a pleasure to drink and reasonably priced."
"D/O: This attractive-looking saison exhibits some potent Belgian yeast character against otherwise traditional and unremarkable sensory qualities."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A nice saison - I like how the Brett plays with this style. That said, the taste was a little off balance. Sweet then dry. Fruity then earthy. Interesting, but I also felt it was lacking continuity."
"O: My first from The Lost Abbey. A decent saison. Great with Swiss cheese. Ready for Carnival season now."
""
"Pretty classy actually. Not a huge measure of Saison or Brett yeast character, but very neat and technically sound. Satisfying."
""
""
""
""
"O: The malt doesn't have much of the Pils character and the bit of sweetness is a little unusual for the style but it comes together well and accentuates the fruitiness. The bitterness has a bit of orange zest character to which lingers a bit in the finish but would pair well with simple preparations of fish like sushi or a pan fried with a light lemon sauce. Does not pair well with marshmallows by the way."
""
""
""
""
"O- Weird beer. Not a huge fan. Might like to try it again though. I feel I wasn't able to give it a fair shake."
""
""
""
"Overall: A very nice Saison. I'm going to set my last few bottles from this vintage aside and let the Brett do some work."
""
""
"I like this beer, but not as much as some other saisons. A little too bitter, and that upsets the balance and all of the other wonderful nuances present. Very worth trying, and any flaws are minimum."
"Overall: I find this to be a highly tasty and drinkable saison. I would gladly have this beer again."
""
"O: This is a nice and refreshing saison; the subtle hints of funk make it quite interesting to drink."
"O: Very enjoyable and easy to drink with an appropriate amount of funkiness. The brett flavors are very complementary and do not dominate or overpower the other flavors in the beer - good amounts of complexity."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Not a bad Saison, but a bit of a disappointment overall as this one is average at best... Perhaps a bit more time in the bottle would help meld the flavors and provide much needed complexity..."
""
"The taste may be a little too spicy for my tastes. It covers some of the complexity. But really I'm being picky and this is a good beer. The hops are spicy and American providing a twist onthe common saison. An effervescent mouthfeel with tiny Belgian bubbles. A solid beer from a great brewery."
""
"Carnevale pours a crystal clear golden yellow. The monstrous pile of foam atop the beer maxes out at about four fingers in height. Head retention and lacing are both very good, but neither are quite on par with the very best of the style The nose has lots of earthy brett funk, but with a light peppery aroma present as well. The flavor profile follows a similar layout, with the brett profile having a prominent, wet hay, barnyard essence to it. The pepper-like phenols are muted and in the background, but definitely present. The label advertises American hops, but outside of a gentle bitterness I don't find evidence of any. The body is nice and dry, and the carbonation has plenty of life to it, spot on mouthfeel for a saison. I really enjoyed this relatively fresh bottle o Carnevale, and I'd be curious to see what it's like with a little bit more age on it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- as this is my first lost abbey brew, I am very satifsfied. Too often do saison attempts have only thin yeasty qualities. Carnevale makes for a thicker, fuller version. Enjoyable."
"bottle"
"This is a real nice saison. Has the good feel with it along with having a slight bit of bretty touch to it on the back end."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, vintage 2012 bottle. Pours lightly hazy golden straw color with a very nice fluffy 3 finger white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Some nice soapy lacing on the glass, with a fair amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of big lemon, apple, pear, orange zest, herbal, floral, pepper, wheat, grass, coriander, mustiness, and yeast spiciness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity. Taste of lemon, pear, pepper, apple, orange zest, grass, herbal, floral, coriander, pineapple, wheat, earth, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of citrus, pear, apple, pineapple, herbal, pepper, coriander, earth, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic flavor complexity and balance of sweetness/peppery flavors. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very nice crisp and slightly slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely fantastic saison! Huge flavor complexity and balance; and extremely smooth to sip on. I had no idea this had Brett in it when I bought it online, but the outcome was fantastic."
"The color of a hazy wheat yellow, with a lot of white foam and a fair amount of lace on the side of the pint glass. The smell of citrus, hops and alcoholic carbonation filled the nose with a pleasant aroma. The taste had the flavor of carbonated lemons, hops and a bitter/sweet finish on the aftertaste that lingered for quite awhile. The longer you sip this ale the more complex flavors you got on your palate."
""
"Overall a refreshingly different Saison, with a nice sour spicy taste that had an outstanding blending with the hops..."
""
""
""
"O: Haven't had an aged Saison prior to this review but I am already a fan."
""
"overall, this is a damn good saison. i'll have to keep an eye out for a bottle of this and hope it's as good as on tap."
"overall not my favorite from lost abbey but having said that, still a stellar brew heads and shoulders above most."
"O: Overall a nice level of funky sourness that is balanced just right, not to pungent, not to light, but finds that sweet spot drink ability wise while still giving you enough to appreciate per style."
""
""
"This is light bodied with lots of carbonation. Very drinkable; very enjoyable."
"The body is light and has somewhat coarse carbonation. Overall a pretty solid offering. Glad to have tried this."
"Super saison style bretty, fruity/apple aroma mixed with Brett. Nicely dry, but still a bit big. Amber-toasty malt flavor lingers with sweet/sour funk: not a standard saison, but pretty tasty. Another solid offering from the lost abbey . Z z.. 250 words yet?"
"Poured on-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a slightly hazed, goldenrod coloring with a slow flow of carbonation bubbles and a dense, chunky, white head with decent retention. Aromas of subtle coriander and nutmeg spicing, with a toasty biscuit backbone. Flavors are smooth, with a subtle honey sweet kick to the toasty backbone, both supporting the spicey overtones. Nutmeg, coriander, and lavender flavors dance on the tongue, and the more you drink the more diverse the flavors get. Smooth bodied with a crisp finish from all the spicy input. The aftertaste is slightly hopped, with some cedar and bitters joining the already complex spice profile. Tasty brew."

"Overall; I wasn't impressed by this one. Saisons are similar across brewers and this one doesn't stand out really."
"O - Pretty sessionable farmhouse ale. Not my favorite of styles but this was refreshing after a long day."
""
"O: I could see this maybe being good if you enjoyed this kinda thing... But it is deffinatly not my style.... To much Belgian yeast for me...."
""
"A complex brew with lots of fruit rind flavor. Enough tart like quality on the back of the tongue to remind you its a saison. Traditional yet innovative. Yeast bite really takes away from the beer though unfortunately ruining its drinkability a bit."
"B-"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I really enjoyed this brew. It's got such a wonderful balance between tart, bitter and sweet that I loved. It was refreshing and looked and smelled very inviting. I really recommend this brew to people that like the style, and softer, more refreshing tasting brews. Cheers!"
"Refreshing but a bit heavy for a hot summer day. Excellent beer overall."
""
""
""
""
"Cloves, citrus fruits, yeast, with a little caramel sweetness. Clean and refined, yet uninteresting in the saison world in my opinion. Delicious, yet safe, this beverage yields a great light yet fluffy saison feel, but lacks in depth. I'd have a second, but I wouldn't seek it out."
""
"O: Great saison, im not much of a saison fan, got turned off by the super spicy offerings, but this is mellow, not many spices in this, lost abbey let the yeast and hops bring out the spice in this one, pick this up, if you find it i know i will"
""
"Overall – Not bad. It got some nice spiciness and flavors. Well worth a try."
""
""
""
"O - Really enjoyed it, and paired well with some seafood. I'd get it again."
""
""

""
""
"-Overall 4.5: Overall, a fantastic beer. It hits so many unusual points in the standard Belgian palate of tastes that I would unconditionally recommend it to any and all fans of brews from the land of awesome beers, moules frites and that weird statue in Brussels. If you can find this beer, buy it."
"This Saison needs refinement. The head and the light tea color are fine, but the finish needs to rounded out, and the mouthfeel slightly less forceful: a good Saison has a mellow fruitiness with tart overtones."
"O- An interesting twist on a great style. I really like their interpretation of this one. The mouthfeel stands out to me as a positive. I like the oat additions."
"Pours a clear yellow with an off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain/malt, citrus, spices, and yeast. Taste is the same with a mild spice bitterness on the finish. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good saison that is pretty tasty and easy to drink."
""
"Overall: an easy drinking saison that is nicely flavored and has enough spiciness to keep it interesting."
""
"D: This is an extremely drinkable brew and this is going to be a perfect brew as the weather warms heading into summer"
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy golden color with just a hint of orange. Large white head that goes down very slowly. Scent is very spicy with a hint of funky brett and some citrus fruit. Belgian yeast and citrus hops. Taste is initially spicy, with pepper and just a bit of lemon zest. A little bit of alcohol with orange and grapefruit. Some nice farmhouse flavors and mellow brett character. Finish slightly bitter and dry. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and dry. Drinkability is very high. Overall, I really like this saison. I also really like Red Barn. I would like to do a side by side with the two."
""
""
"Undated bottle to Duvel tulip. The beer pours a translucent golden yellow with a very impressive 3 finger white bubbly head. Great retention and lacing. Looks impressive. The aroma is a blend of spice, earthen hops, grassy almost though fresh like a field of wheat rather than a lawnmower, if that makes sense. It's nice. The flavor follows suit with a nice foundation or toasted malts from which the peppery citrus flavors build. Earthen hops with mild bitterness. Crisp and clean. Moderate carbonation and lighter end of medium bodied. Overall, another fantastic Lost Abbey brew. Very enjoyable."

"A solid Saison from The Lost Abbey."
""
""
"O: Typical Saison. I like the majority of the Lost Abbey's brews and this is one of them. Give it a shot."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - It's a pretty decent American Saison, but the brett didn't seems to take off the way it did in Saints' Red Barn or Saints' Devotion (or even Brouwers Imagination 2008). Perhaps I'll revisit this fresh to see if I like it more."
""
""
""

"Overall: Very drinkable. A very tasty saison. Good balance between spice and citrus."
"Pours a slightly-hazy peach color with a thick and foamy white head. Loads of lacing on the way down and a thick collar throughout. The nose carries some light fruit plus a bit of white pepper and spice. Light coriander character and a bit of citrus peel. Light wheat. Slight dryness to the finish. Medium-high carbonation. Good malt backbone with a nice bit of spice and yeast bite throughout. Quite nice."
"overall - This is a great Saison. The brett is very melow, and the bitterness is a little high. Over all, a finely crafted ale. I'd definitely buy this again!"
"O: I'm giving this beer an average rating. I'm picking up a lot of lemony citrus flavors that aren't really to my taste and there is a taste, maybe from a combination of flavors that reminds me of a metallic taste, not sure how else to describe it."
"Overall this is a very good example of a Saison that has been hopped up with some American flare. A bit simple perhaps, with not as much complexity in the fruity profile as many other Saisons, but very refreshing and tasty in its own regard."
"A delicious and classic version of a great style."
"Poured into a wine glass with great half inch head. Dark golden color and white head but it faded quickly and there is a slight chill haze to add color. Not overly carbonated and the smell is traditional saison. Good spice notes of coriander and orange with a slight back end herb flavor. Over all good beer but the finish left a bit of an oily mouthfeel. Another pretty good beer from Lost Abbey. Need to make it back to the brewery for some Ten Commandments."
"Overall, this is a well-made beer, having been obviously brewed lovingly and with a good amount of ingredients. I'm not sure it necessarily brings anything new to the table, but it is quite delicious."
"Golden yellow in color with a light orange hue and excellent clarity. Poured with a dense belgian-like frosty head that reduced fairly quickly but left sheets of lacings on the glass. Wheat, biscuit, banana aromas. with a bit of funky, fruity belgian yeast that is difficult to describe. On the lighter side of medium bodied with a light oily feel that surpresses the carbonaton a bit. Wheat, biscuit malt, and banana flavors up front that taper as hoppy lemon bitterness is introduced. Hops and underlying banana flavor carry through and lead to a tangy, not quite spicy feel toward the finish. Finishes with a clean feel accompanied by a lingering hop bittterness. Lots of different aromas and flavors with this ale."
"Had this one during the 'We Want The Funk!' tasting that was graciously hosted by beermeX2! Big thanks goes out to BRoss242 for sharing this one with the group! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured a hazy golden yellow with a one finger pure white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, banana, and fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, banana, fruit, and wheat. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I did not pick up on any of the spices usually associated with this style unfortunately, but it allowed the rest of the flavors to step forward and take the show. This was a pretty nice and easy drinking brew and was a nice palate cleanser during the night. Definitely worth trying if you get the chance!"
"I don't want to say that all American brewers are crafting Belgian ales that meet, or often exceed, the quality and complexity of their creators, but I think it's fair to say that Tomme Arthur puts out enough of them for the whole country. Carnevale is another one in a long line of Lost Abbey beers that remarkably captures the charm and character of a Belgian classic."
"Overall: This is an exception example of the Saison style, which seems to be becoming easier to find as more breweries are taking a crack at it. It's delicious, highly drinkable, and not overwhelming at a modest 6.5% I highly recommend it if you dig this style."
"M: Semi tart and crisp with great sweet to citrus, medium and refreshing."
"D - A very good saison. I would have guessed a higher abv than the 6.5% it is. A very good beer"
"Pours a hazy orangeish color with an off white head. In the aroma, earthy and a small hop presence. In the taste, small tartness, earthy, fresh hops, and a nice dry yeast presence in the end. A small hop bite and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry fresh hop in the aftertaste. A nice hop presence in a fine saison."
"O- A spicy/ citrus Saison yet down to earth... the way it should be. Perfect for a summer night like tonight!"
"Overall, I think my expectations were mostly on target. Just as much a golden as a blonde or saison, just imagine more concentrated and heavily hopped. As with most of similar styles, this would make a fine, versatile table beer."
"O – A saison on the citrus end of the style. On whole, I’d say the quality is on par with Red Barn. Delicious."
"O: Solid saison from the Lost Abbey. It is not particularly earth shattering, but delivers what one would expect for the style."
"This is a solid example of the style, but in my opinion, nothing more."
"O - Solid example of a Saison, especially for those hot late-Spring/early Summer days!"
"Pours out as a typical looking Saison brew. The beer is yellow and kind of cloudy looking. The smell is a little earthy but not too much, had some nice fresh hops aromas in there as well. The taste didn't give off much of a farmhouse taste but it did have a good floral quality to it. The mouthfeel overall was pretty good. I enjoyed this beer the carbonation was pretty good despite some of the issues lost abbey was having. This brew is worthy of trying I think."
"Overall this was a solid beer but lacked anything to really set it apart. Worth a shot but not worth seeking."
"Strong, inviting aroma is malty, fruity and yeasty with a grassy hint. It pours a clear amber with a thick, fluffy, rather persistent white head. Mouth filling flavor is crisp and malty and has fruity and floral undertones as well as an herbal hint. Texture is fizzy and sassy, and can unexpectedly bite the tongue, so watch out! Another winner from Lost Abbey."
"This saison is nice in that it is very drinkable and refreshing, but it lacks depth all around. There are SOME subtle elements but not enough to make this anything special. Even the lower alcohol percent stands out because of this. It just needs something more in any direction."
"This beer is what summer saisons are all about you need to pick one up if you see it."
"Narrative: ""Carrot. Zucchini. God is that all there is? Vegetable medley every Wednesday, lasagna on Thursdays."" She lamented idly while cutting away the vegetables and her Wednesday afternoon. The granite counters were not pedestrian, but nothing to write home about. The routine provided stability yet- ""Why hello..."" her eyes strayed as a festive Guatemalan man began skimming her pool. ""I don't recall seeing him before"" She watched him, pep within his step remove dead frogs from the skimmer basket, an artful spin while he skimmed the weeping willow leaves from the surface of the pool. ""Such grace, finding majesty in the menial"" her eyes glazed over as she startled herself upon cutting to the end of an overly ripe zucchini. ""How could he add such panache to seemingly uninteresting tasks?"" The spring heat seemed to lean oppresively upon the task of the ceiling fan, clicking under the stress of its laborious gyrations. ""HE FINDS SUCH PLEASURE IN THE MENIAL"" Menial to some, a festive reatreat to others, he removes the dead leaves of fall with aplomb, casting their black vestiges into the soil. ""Senora, la piscina esta limpia"" she exhales and pushed the vegetables into a united medley, ""work on joyful Pan, the season of Carneval is upon us."""
"The CPJ"
"Good looking saison here, with a nice straw gold color and bone white head. Good retention too, though maybe not as good of head as you might see on Fantome. Nose hits all the right notes for the saison, lemon, grass, bready malt, yeast notes, apples, maybe a hint of funk. Flavor was spot on too--just a straightforward refreshing saison. I don't think I could spend all day searching for nuances in this beer, but it was clean, crisp, and just plain good. Feel was light, well carbonated. Overall, this is a good saison--doesn't change the brewing world, but it is well-executed and worth the try. I'll definitely order it again if I see it."
"jd"
"D: Really easy drinking for a nice hot day. Saison’s are porch beers: Sip and enjoy the day pass by."
"O: It was 65 degrees out and we were putting together our new BBQ and this really hit the spot. An exceptional example of the style."
"A nice beery Saison and quite drinkable. A little harsh in the back of the mouth. Worth a try. Personally I like a little more mellowness to go with the tart."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: This is a wonderfully drinkable beer with each sip leading easily to the next. I'll be happy to see this beer again and I'm already trying to figure out where to get a case. My overall impression is of a well-made saison-like beer that is an imaginative combination of a Belgian style made with some uniquely American ingredients (the hops) that just works."
"Medium body, higher carbonation, slightly creamy and smooth. Super drinkable, refreshing, and pleasant from top to bottom."
"D: This is a nice beer that has just enough funkiness. A nice a pickup."
"Medium body with a crisp spicy presence up front with sme slight earthy tarntness and sweet light fruit. Slightly creamy mid palate with faint bitterness balanced out by the sweeter light fruit notes. Hints of apple, pear and grape as well as a pale malt character. Well balanced and easy to drink with a well masked ABV. Refreshing with a slight dry finish."
"Poured into a tulip from a 24(?)oz. It pours a nice hazy peach with a dismal head and not much lace. Not bad looking, but certainly not a beautiful Saison. The smell bumps it up a notch for sure. We have the pale, bready malts, some pear, some sour, stinky funk and a buttload of earthy hops. It's just a little light, it took me a bit to sniff this one out. The taste follows the mouth but with a very distict french bread and dried pear taste. Super easy going down with a perfect dry finish. I LOVE saisons, this one hit the mark on almost all notes (except the price, pretty high for not being imported). This was my second brew from Lost Abbey (the first being a 2009 Judgement Day) and I'm pretty goddamned impressed so far."
"Props to my brother for finding this bottle intriguing enough to give it a try! It pours a hazy pale straw topped by a minor finger of white foam. The nose comprises lemon zest, orange zest, coriander, wheat, grass, and black pepper. The taste holds notes of coriander, black pepper, grass, light lemon zest, a touch of tart mandarin oranges, and a hint of dry blanket. The body is a very light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry-ish finish. Overall, a nice bit o' saison, one of the more low-key and drinkable versions I've had in a little while. Good times from my bro."
"Drinkability: defendantly a lovely beer to drink would have been great if I aged it to cool off on a hot summer night."
"D: Decent Saison, but I have had better, this is my 1st Lost Abbey and a tad disappointed. I will definitely try a few more different styles from them before I pass judgement on the brewery. Could down a few of these with ease. Try this, but you don't need to seek it out."
"A gentle pop of the cork from a 750 into the Watou chalice it went. A bright hay color with a slight and quickly dissipating head that was not too surprising given the lack pressure behind the cork. Ah, how often do I get a Lost Abbey that lacks in the carbonation department, a quality control problem I suffer because when it turns out right, they are great. Back to the review. The nose is of a sweet malt character with an orange citrus. I suspect the lack of CO2 allows the malt character to dominate the nose and muddles the lemon citrus character others describe into a sweeter citrus, the orange I'm detecting. In the background is the funk...ah the funk. Open the mouth and down the gullet taking time to dance on the tongue. A tang hits under the tongue, almost a carbonic bite, but not. Dominating is brett's funk intermixed with hoppy citrus notes, and a slightly harsh hop bitterness that lingers obnoxiously. Its good, but I have to say it lacks complexity. Even for its faults it is an easy drinker, no problem finishing the 750 and feeling better for it."
"D: the brew is a solid saison which is good on tap as well and drinks fairly good. Definitely a beer to enjoy on a hot summer day poolside."
"D: This was a pretty easy drinker and the ABV was virtually undetectable, but I've had much better LA brews. Still, it was worth the $7.50."
"D: Best non-375 I've had from the Sinners and Saints ..."
"Reminded me of a hefeweizen with a bunch of hibiscus flowers in it, with some wet dog to round it out."
"Drinkability: Easy drinking Saison. Not much else to say; gulpable even."
"D - This is a good enjoyable Saison it tastes good and its easy to drink I could drink a few of these in a sitting worth getting to try sometime"
"M/D: Light to medium body, carbonation is relatively low. Probably could use a little more carbonation and little less body. Drinkability is good. Overall a solid beer."
"Caged and cork much like all of the Lost Abbey ales, this is a saison with American hops. Pours a clouded orange golden hue with a bright white head forming thick fine bubbled. No pop when I decorked it but no carbonation issues to speak of. Aromatics spicy peppery notes, herbal citrus qualities as well. A touch of phenolic plastic, hint of band aid. More so tropical fruits like mango and pineapple standout than the off tones. Especially in the flavor the tropical fruits are juicy pineapple and ripened mango with nice cereal malt sweetness. Hints of rounded herbaceous, citric hop character. Sometimes American hops and Belgian yeast strains clash, that's not the case here. Back ground has hints of spicy yeast tones with a black peper kick. Mouthfeel is medium bodied carbonation is effervescent, dry finish nice hoppy saison. Drinkability overall is solid a beer I would like to have access to, I hear local Pittsburgh shops are going to start carrying some Philly brews, namingly House of 1000 Beers."
"Honey drizzled grains with a nice farmhouse character that many American brewers struggle to impart in their saisons. Hops are there in enough quantity to put a west coast stamp of approval on it, although Tank 7 has this beat by a wide margin in the lupulin category. Mouthfeel is perhaps the beers best quality, rich and creamy with perfect carbonation. Light melon fruitiness comes out as it warms. I am still not sure if any brettanomyces are present...the nose says yes and the taste says no. Good beer nonetheless."
"Overall a tasty beer that could be categorized as a Belgian/American IPA - Saison. Now that's a nice hybrid."
"D - Crisp well carbonated and refreshing. Very delicious and good ABV."
"Very drinkable. This is a quality saison, and I enjoy the slight diversions from the usual style. It is not quite up to par with the big players in this style, but it is an enjoyable beer I will seek out again."
"this is a nice saison, but not extremely dintinctive or a standout brew."
"*From notes taken on 6-17-10"
"I've now had around forty saisons, and while I wouldn't say this is a bad beer, it doesn't stack up that well against its competitors. It seems to oscillate between subtle balance and blandness without really achieving the complexity or finesse of other beers."
"Drinkability - Relatively so, though there are so many other Saison's out there I'd rather have."
"My first beer from Lost Abbey will not be my last!"
"D - A different Saison interpretation. I would probably try something different next time. Might be worth a try on a nice warm day."
"Bottle. Pours Cloudy Copper/Straw color, 2 inch head. Aroma: Grapefruit, Sav Blanc, Hay, Light Spice. Taste: Sour, fruity, spicy, hint of grapefruit, tangy, slightly hoppy. Medium bodied with with a soft clean finish. Another banger from The Lost Abbey!"
"Overall, a tasty take on a Saison from Lost Abbey. I'm glad I grabbed a bottle of this and wish I had bought a case."
"Poured into tulip. Poured a hazy golden yellow with a tall, fluffy, white head that had very good retention and OK lacing. The aroma was the expected spice and yeast. The taste was very similar, grain, spice and yeast. The body was light and crisp. Drinkability was good, but the beer was a touch over-carbonated for my taste. Worth a shot if you see it."
"D- very drinkable and so easy to do so. Favlorful but never overwhelming. Great saison to kick back with."
"D- Certainly a non-traditional interpretation, but worth a try. Very fresh, invigorating."
"Pretty good, enjoyed this one with a year on it much more than I did fresh...mouthfeel was a little lacking and is the only real part of the beer that was subpar to rest..."
"I really enjoyed this as a saison."
"smells like a rodennbach, tastes like an oerbier mixed with an IPA. not my favorite Saison (or whatever) but good."
"At 6.5%, this is an easy drinker. This was a very enjoyable beer that I'll try again."
"d - Thought this was a decent saison. I thought the smell was better than the taste and enjoyed the funk it had. Would try again."
"This is the 2009 vintage which was brewed using Brettanomyces. The beer pours a slightly hazy golden color with a white head. The aroma is brett with some citrus. I also get some tartness. The flavor is a nice mix of citrus, spices, Belgian yeast and some brett characteristics. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Light golden body, some visible carbonation, 1/2 finger white head, quick dissipation with minimal lacing. Nose is fairly dry with some fruitiness and spice, floral hops. Taste is fruity, orange peel, some pepper, not too much in hops, subsumed by fruitiness, though I do note some floral hops. Mouthfeel is quite dry, high attenuated finish, pretty sweet but not too cloying. In terms of drinkability I prefer Red Barn to this sweeter Saison and the hops were very muted, defeating the purpose of the dry-hopping. Actually, I prefer Upright Seven to both, but that's another story for a sunny Beervana day."
"Medium body. A bit more carbonation would liven this up a bit. Alcohol well hidden. Not bad."
"An OK beer that honestly isn't as good as Hennepin. I find myself thinking OK I drank it, give me a Duvel or Hennepin now."
"D - Lost Abbey does it again. Another really, really good brew."
"This is a decent beer but its definitely not my favorite and probably wont order it again"
"A great beer to start to session of with. All the flavors are so subtle, gets the palat primed for something a bit heavier!"
"Bottom line: get it on tap if you see it."
"Flavor is solid for its style. Has the typical light fruit, grass-earth tones, a little funk, a small amount of spices. Booze isn't even detectable. Crisp and light mouthfeel, light body, high carbonation...which is nice to see from Lost Abbey! With that said, their still one of my favorite breweries. Carnevale is an easy drinker...I am easily going to finish this whole 750ml myself."
"A very nice beer overall. I had no problem taking down the whole 750 and enjoyed every sip."
"Drinkability:A nice and dry, flavorful saison that is good not great for the style. I do like the flavor combinations. I would get this again, but there are other Lost Abbey beers I would get sooner."
"Pours a mirky, cloudy orangish-yellow haze with a decent fluffy white head. Yeasty nose with spicy notes like clove and allspice. Some citrus oil scents also seem very inviting. Biscuit bite is up front with a dry and slightly tart finish. A bit of fruitiness and some Brett funk in there too. Refreshing and pleasant. Lacing clings well. Wishing there was more funk. Overall a good one."
"D- An easy drinking saison for sure, but also a very unique one, different from most i've had."
"After trying this one the other night, the brett is really doing wonderful things. This one, already good, is getting better."
"vintage 2009. yum. this beer turns my gears for sure. burnt gold with a slight haze and a nice, white head that shrinks but never disappears and leaves splotchy lace as the beer is drained. not really sure how it could look much better, but i'm not in to 5's. a lot going on in the nose although it seems to all be harmonizing nicely. the first things that come to mind are lemon, grape, apple and pastry. almost like a really good, proper apple pie that is laced with lemon. some pear and horse blanket as well as musty cellar and grass. just like the nose suggests, the taste is very well balanced. all the tastes are defined yet blended very well and the acid levels are just right to produce a lingering finish that is extremely pleasant. really good job balancing bitter and sour. hops come out in the middle and then gently dance with the sour funk in the end. earthy stuff comes out more as it warms up. soft. medium body on the light side of medium. impressive. tomme arthur deserves every bit of hype he gets. i need more!!"
"Bright yet murky with an intense earthiness in the nose. You get a little of that pungent hay barn smell that some saisons present. Taste is pleasant and not overwhelming. I like that this beer laces nicely and a little more than other saisons. I think the drinkability of this particular beer is where it wins in my book. Very nice. No real bite in the back of the throat and great on a warm day."
"Mouthfeel is on the lighter side with above average carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's a very good tasting, easy drinking and refreshing beer. Very good all around beer."
"D: the Brett doesn't really hit the palate until the finish and leaves a prominant lingering flavor that balances against some nice hop bitterness; pretty interesting slightly against-style effort that works pretty well; likely a one-and-done"
"This is an extremely easy to drink saison that was much better and more interesting than I anticipated."
"(D)- A solid saison made even more dynamic with a more pronounced hop addition than what is usually found in the style. Not as 'funky' as what you would typically consider in this style, but why follow what others do? I am enjoying this one thoroughly."
"Really enjoyed this. I guess I don't have enough experience to say this was a classic Saison, but it meets the criteria of being fairly dry, refreshing, and somewhat rustic. Nice all around."
"The feel is a pretty easy drinking feel to this beer and is slightly acidy but very pleasing. The first Lost Abbey beer I have had and I am very happy with this experience."
"This is a great Saison. Lots of subtle complexities. There are a ton of hops, but they are never overpowered by the funky yeast and sweet fruity esters. Highly recommended."
"Very good beer. One of the better saisons I've had, & certainly the best I've had for the first time in quite a while."
"This one has been hiding in the back of psycohops fridge for more than six months. Thanks for sharing this one with me Bob! A corked 750ml bottle purchased at Abe's in Bethlehem for $9 - 2009 vintage on the label. Uncorked and poured into a pair of shaker glasses. The ale appears a hazed apricot color with a good two fingers of creamy light rust colored foam. Nose and flavors consist of musty, funky brett-like notes, albeit somewhat mild, (good in this case), lemon, apples, pear, spicy yeast, citrus-y. At least a notch better than medium bodied for the style with ample carbonation as well. Very nice! Thanks again Bob!"
"The beer labels itself as a hoppy saison, though the hops do not overpower the naturally delicious flavors of the saison. No drowning out of flavor with too much citrus or mustiness. The Belgian flavors are first and foremost on the palate. The funk of the beer is pronounced and enjoyable, a sweet and acidic brew. Less dry than Saison Dupont and without the skunk some SD's suffer from. The beer is almost a clone of Fantome's original Saison in terms of flavor and funk. I will be buying more of these very soon. The only downside was that the beer was slightly undercarbonated, but this didn't affect its drinkability."
"pretty damn good saison but it was a tad sweet. Poured with a nice white head and good lace. Color is a clear amber gold. Aroma is spicey, grassy, light malt, yeast, bread, and bit of sour fruit. Flavor's the same and big on the saison flavors but a little over sweet. Body is decent and so is the carbonation. Little strong alcohol in the finsih. Maybe a session."
"Carnevale is a very solid release from Lost Abbey. It's not in the upper echelon of their release, but it is quite good. Personally, I'd like a more pronounced Belgian yeast flavor. That would easily ratchet up the score for me. But, that really is nitpicking. Carnevale's a really good Saison that's well worth checking out."
"Mouthfeel is medium carbonated and silky smooth; excites the palate. Overall a refreshingly crisp brew."
"This is a style of beer I usually enjoy, and this one is average to slightly above average when compared against it's peers. Nothing outstanding but it's worth a try."
"D- easy to finish and sessionable. this beer very much reminds me of summer and is certainly something i will be checking out next year. another lost abbey product with no QC issues. check this one out."
"75cl bottle. Gold with a medium white head and light lace. The nose is a nice fruity mix of hops and funky yeast, with s dusty, almost sour tinge. The flavor is hoppy with some lemony bitterness, a hint of acidity, and yeast fruitiness. A little sweeter than I expected but still finishing pretty dry. Light on the tongue with medium carbonation that seemed like it needed to be a little higher to give an optimum feel. There was a promise of a funkier, more acidic beer, but it turned out a little more straight forward and simple. Very drinkable stuff. The hops provide a nice balance and bitterness to the malt that is just a little sweet."
"D - It's not hard to drink, I just don't like it and won't drink more."
"D-A rock solid saison with plenty of spicy zip and a nice touch of lemony zing. Easy to drink and flavourful. A well done take on one of my most favorite styles."
"Overall - A pretty good saison. Nothing groundbreaking but well worth a try..."
"D: Very manageable ABV and drinks easy enough. Very tasty and unique."
"Drinkability: Not my style but I can appreciate the quality of this beer, and it does seem to be surprisingly easy to drink."
"This is a true to style brew, albeit not overly notable. Good flavor with glaring weaknesses elsewhere, the 750 will satisfy my thirst for this one and I will not go out of my way to get another."
"The taste is interesting, and but plain. The mostly tastes hoppy, light notes of citrus. Its very drinkable, smooth taste through out but nothing overly special."
"2012 edition much better owing to fresh lemony taste and hops n finish.This rating is the 2012."
"drinkability is good. very refreshing and light on the palate. just what a good saison should be. excellent. cheers!"
"D: Was sitting outside at the Belgian Cafe on a humid summer night and this beer, served cold was perfectly refreshing and light, without sacrificing flavor and complexity."
"Drinkability for me is very good, but this is a complex beer that deserves a critical pallet. If you love Saisons, seek this party out!"
"Pours a hazy straw color with a silky beige head. Nice lacing and retention. Nose has a collection of tropical and citrus fruits, bready malts, zesty spices, herbal hops and musky barnyard funk. Taste not quite as impressive, but well balanced. Fruity malts, earthy hops, peppery spices and a subtle wild yeast presence. Crisp body is well carbonated. Tasty stuff indeed."
"drinkability: good"
"[1xBOA]"
"Say Say Say what you want, but Sir Paul McCartney himself would argue its human nature to like this beer. Carnevale is not my lover, its just a beer, but its a pretty good one. RIP MJ."
"Pours a semi-hazey, dull golden hay color. Maybe some faint amber hues mixed in there as well. The aroma is sweet toasted malts, light apple juice, and some unindetifiable herbs. Starts off sweet from the malts and fruity from the yeast. The middle is more grainy and herbal with the effervescant bubbles throughout the entire palate. I love the carbonation, but the mix of favors don't segue well from one o the other. Not bad though."
"D: Quite delicious. Delicate and relatively complex. More like a Belgian Golden Ale than a Saison or Farmhouse because it lacks the musty and funky yeast flavors. Instead flavor relies on the balanced and smooth malt flavors."
"Excellent Saison, one I'll be happy to procure again and one that ensures I will seek out more from the storied Lost Abbey. Very well done. I'm certainly impressed."
"Before my trip to the West Coast I would say that I wasn't a huge fan of the uber hops, but I am a changed man. I can't wait to go back!"
"- Super drinkable and just the right amount of carbonation... a very nice light ale with the strength of an average IPA... super drinkable!"
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with decent carbonation."
"Was excited to see something from Lost Abbey that I haven't had.... probably my favorate brewery. Looks almost like an IPA, and the head doesnt' really stick around that long or leave any lacing. Smell is different.... almost like there is some brett in there. very funky. Taste is weird also, this is a freakshow of a beer. Not really sure what to think. The American hops don't stound out too much. Some sweetness, some funk, and that's about it. Decent, but not quite one I would buy again. It goes down easy enough, but seems like it isnt' any one style, which almost detracts from the taste. An interesting concept, but is a little too weird for me. I love saisons, but this was too different."
"D- Easy to put away. The Brettiness might start to get old after a while though."
"D: Very flavorful and easy to drink with the nice balance."
"Pours a medium golden hue, some haze, and bright white head. Nose comes across as sour fruit mix and peach juice. On the palate, this is a whopper of a sour ale with pear flavors, some malt sweetness, a pleasant sourness, and some candy sugar sweetness at the end on the finish."
"This is an interesting, very tasty saison. The aroma pops a bit more than the taste, which is more subtle and dominated more by the spicing and hops, but overall I enjoyed this very much. It doesn't rate with my favorite saisons or my favorite LA beers, but it's one I would certainly come back to."
"I thought this was a good domestic saison, nothing more. The addition of American hops was a good idea, although I don't believe it did a whole lot in this instance. The main issue here was the carbonation which, admittedly, could have been due to the fact that I had the beer shipped all the way across the country (although I doubt it because I've had other beers shipped from the same place that were fine carbonation-wise). Still, I have to say that this was a good beer. It's probably not worth ordering online and paying for shipping, but if it's available in your area, give it a try. Recommended."
"D: Seems very similar to their other saison, Red Barn. It's not bad at all, but I think I'd go with something else in terms of value."
"Bone white head of mixed large bubbles to pure froth, moderate lacing, settles quickly into a half finger coating. Cloudy yellow color with some orange for hue depth, healthy glow to it and completely opaque. Slowly works its way up to being very full in the nose, unhurried unfurling of uncooked bread dough, orange and lemon rinds, nutmeg and cinnamon spice, underlying earthiness anchors it, the white fruit palpable but doesn't diverge into distinct parts, ends with suggestions of both white pepper and field wildflowers. Full-bodied, moves like it's still slightly buzzed from the night before and thrown off by the light when the shades are pulled back at 11:00 AM. Hence, the flavors have the same gauziness as the liquid itself, the slabs of lemon and orange, the just out of the oven sourdough bread, the mixed baking spices and flowers need mastication to get working. Carbonation active for what it has to cut through. Nectarine, pineapple, peach, pear fruit a background element. Overall round texture but definitely firms up the focus through the finish."
"Overall I really liked this one. Like their Red Barn, I think ther 750 ml is best split due to its filling nature."
"Drinkability is, like any great saison, fantastic."
"M/D - Light and crisp, very well carbonated. Easy drinking. An excellent saison, but nothing exceptional."
"Drinkability- I kind of feel like I've had this beer before. It has that same sort of yeasty tone that I've had in a lot of Lost Abbey's beers. Now I'm definitely not saying that is a bad thing, it's just that this didn't feel new. Ya know? Anywho, Nancy Negative aside, it's a damned tasty brew that I really enjoyed. Thanks Matt!!"
"overall good. Not my thing, but good."
"Poured at cellar temp producing a decent head over clouded light gold color. Good amount of lacing that lasted quite a while thoughout the session. Nose was light floral with some sourness though taste had nothing but floral, sweet, belgian yeast scents. Not as complex as was hoped after smell though quite a good beer and though not really a 'session' beer (as stated above), at 6.5% ABV, it's not over-the-top in alcohol and the taste is light enough that it is quite drinkable...if this were on-tap, i'd say i would be happy to order a few of these during an evening. Mouthfeel is good and certainly a solid representation of Belgian/Farmhouse ale."
"Conclusion: This is a nice Saison, which definitely pushes the earthy/funky notes more than the fruit."
"First time trying this. I love the nose but spicy finish is almost a bit too much for me and kills the session potential of this beer because I'd seek out something with a tad less spark on the tail end of the sip. It's not bad though, and I would drink it again if it were offered to me."
"Lost Abbey never fails. If you get your hands on this drink this cold on a hot day. Be greedy don't share."
"D - This one is very drinkable, will drink again."
"This is a good sipper for a warm evening."
"Overall, a solid saison. A little too sweet for my tastes, but still a worthwhile pickup."
"Bottle courtesy of Kegbear: Poured a bright golden yellow color ale with a pure white large foamy head with great retention and perfect lacing. Aroma of European dry hops with light notes of Brett. Aroma of dominated by European hops (Saaz?) with some light bretty notes and some distinctive Belgian malt. Taste is also dominated by some dry hoppy notes with a nice Belgian malt backbone. I didn't notice as much ester as I would have expected but I still quite enjoyed this one. Full body with great carbonation and no alcohol note whatsoever."
"Pours a foggy gold with a quite thin white head. Nose is inky, dough, and some funk. Flavor is citrus themed with quite a bit of dough and spices to match. Quite earthy. Feel is smooth and slightly thin on liquid and carbonation is low. Seems appropriate on all sides. This is a nice saison. Earthy and inky, it's bringing the right levels of funk and flavor."
"Drinkability: The most drinkable beer I've ever experienced. I guess this probably has to do with me not being a huge session beer guy, but it just was a great drinking experience - it's infinitely quaffable, you could have ten of them and it would just fly by."
"D - For me, this beer would get tiring pretty quick."
"Another one down in my quest to drink all lost abbey's."
"Jason is a proper trader.. we should do it again, yet I doubt I have the ammo."
"Perfectly carbonated for the light-medium body, an easy to drink for the style, that tastes like a little piece of Belgium nicely done. Enjoy!"
"Great representation of the style."
"Drinkability: Having just consumed a Red Barn, this kissing cousin has a tough precedent to live up to; I think I prefer the layered complexity of the Red Barn, but this is well suited to a warmer summer occasion - too bad we are in December, right now"
"Pours hazy gold with a short white head. Aroma reminiscent of a German hefe; banana, clove, apricots, and lemon. Clean, light taste that is a cross between a hefe and a trippel. More yeast and clove, but now with bubblegum and spice with a little sugary wheat flavor. I really liked this beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, spritzy of CO2, with dry, peppery notes in the finish."
"750ml bottle courtesy of numbeercruncher. nice hazy orange color with a filmy white head. Smells rustic and reminds me of red barn. Taste is very similar to red Barn with a candy sweetness to it. Decent beer but after having Ne Goien this just doesn't do it for me."
"Drinkability- Better than average saison. Would have liked some funk though. Maybe a bit more of a lemon flavor as well. Still very drinakble."
"Notes from 6/27/08"
"D. I would like to drink a whole bottle myself or perhaps share with one person. Nice experience and a great beer. My 1st Lost Abbey beer and I really like it."
"Fairly clear, gold in colour with a dense layer of white foam. Good head retention and thick, chunky lacing. Crackery, fruity sweetness in the aroma with grassy and herbal hop notes, a bit yeasty and spicy. Bitterness was restrained, but was a bit more forceful in the finish where the hop flavour lingered. Up front it had a fruity, wheat cracker flavour with spicy and earthy characters throughout. Strawberry with a bit of tartness. Good stuff. Refreshing, medium to light bodied with moderate carbonation. Quite smooth in texture and very drinkable."
"Drinkability is pretty good, a nice little saison, pretty reasonable price from what I recall, although I had to drive across the river into WA to get it. Better then my first time drinking it, which was granted a bottle split 3 ways, it goes to show you should always try something a second time."
"D: A nice Saison, but not the best, and even not the best from LA. Red Barn Ale, their year round Saison is comparable, if not slightly better."
"Nice take on a Saison with the additional hopping of this, adding some punch to the taste. This was quite tasty and refreshing. I liked it."
"Two solid inches of foamy off white head slowly fades leaving scattered lace. Body is a glowing straw colored gold. Nose is brisk with evident notes of crisp hops, raw wheat and sweet yeasty doughy notes. Hops are the distinct driver to the taste profile to this beer. It is quite abrubt and hoppy for a Saison, but not in a bad way. The grassy hops mix well with the yeast and wheat. This really reminds me of a ""hopenweizen"" for lack of a better term. Mouthfeel is laced with hops and thick bitterness. A solid drinking brew."
"Overall impression: Nice drinkable beer - some interesting yeast flavors. Nothing quite as spectacular as I've come to expect from Lost Abbey, but a solid beer."
"Pours a clear gold with lots of frothy white head before all the yeast empties the bottle. Nice retention with great lacing. Smells of apple, honey, light bread, spices, and citrus. Tastes of pineapple followed by butterscotch and honey sweetness and light grainy bread notes, with a sour apple, lemon, and orange peel finish. Medium in body with good carbonation. Smooth with a nice light bitterness in the finish. Another good brew from The Lost Abbey, refreshing, easy to drink, and flavorful."
"D- excellent saison, delicious flavor with a great nose, sessionable and refreshing, great balance, recommended"
"Pours a cloudy yellow/gold, thin white head forms, drops some spotty lace and settles to a thin layer. Smell is sweet, lemons, light funk in the middle, strawberries, very fragrant, citrus, sour fruit and a tart spiciness. Taste is toasty, citrus, honey, wheat, fruits, coriander, tart finish with spice, off dry. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation, easy drinking saison. Pretty standard, the tartness is nice, and I could drink this stuff all night. Thanks Jan!"
"overall a slightly above average beer."
"Bottle courtesy of WasTrikenSie. Thanks Tom!!"
"Pours a slightly cloudy golden straw color with a fluffy white head that sticks around forever. Aroma is sweet malt and spicy belgian yeast. I don't get much of the American hops that they talk about on the bottle. Taste is overpowered by the spicy belgian yeast, Slightly sweet honey type malt in there too, its really tasty and complex. Medium to thick mouthfeel. Ample carbonation. Great brew, a bit Belgian spicy, feels heavier than it is, but very tasty."
"Tasty brew, but short of expectations form such a highly regarded brewery. Pretty tame for the style, and another Lost Abbey brew that's short on carbonation."
"Corked and caged 750ml bottle. Pours an orangish yellow color with a pretty solid head that sticks around for quite a while. The aroma is malt and citrus (most notably oranges), spices and yeast with some hops as well. The taste has a very interesting farmhouse taste that features a very good mixtures of citrus and spices with a good dose of spicy hops in the finish. Wow, this is a pretty kick ass Saison that is very well crafted by the guys at The Lost Abbey. Definitely worth seeking out, highly recommended."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1 1/2"" bright white head above the clear golden brew. Pillowy head recedes slowly, with heavy frothy lacing. Aroma is lightly sweet and dominantly spicy yeast. Taste follows the nose, but the spicing is more blended and it all comes together nicely, with a crisp close. Mouthfeel is soft over the tongue, with easy drinkability. I expected quite a bit out of a $12 beer, but this one was all that and more."
"A good mouth feel, not too carbonated. Overall, high drinkability. This is a good Saison and another fine example of a Lost Abbey beer."
"D: This is an extremely drinkable brew and this is an ideal drink on a hot summer evening."
"Pours a very nice hazy golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little white foamy head, which leaves some nice sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, yeasty, some nice spicyness, and some caramel. The taste is slightly sweet at first, then some bitterness crawls up on ya, yeasty, I like the spicyness on this one, just right, not to overpowering like other Saison's, nice touch of caramel notes. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a exceptional Saison, again not like a Belgium, but I like it. Thanks Bill."
"Notes: My saison kick has been supremely satiated with this brew. Love everything that's going on in it, and really love the fact that I have one more bottle. If you're a fan of the style, pick it up... you won't be sorry. Spanks Red Barn with a paddle."
"Light golden color with a full head that lasts well. Aroma is ok, with some doughy malts, spice, some fruit, some belgian character. Flavor is heavily spiced, with some fruits and farmhouse. Overall, it's a pleasant beer, but really doesn't compare to most imported Belgians."
"drinkability is great. balanced, not overly spiced. very nice!"
"This is another well made farmhouse-style brew from Lost Abbey. Red Barn was a good saison but Carnevale nudges it out, in my opinion. Both are very good and I wouldn't hesitate to drink this again. Thanks for sending a good brew my way Derek."
"Pours a hazy pale yellow amber color with a full finger foamy white head that fades fairly quickly. Spotty patterns of lacing left behind. It smells bright and earthy all at once. Like harvest fruit, pears and bananas over the Belgian yeast. Adequately carbonated, it has a coating quality that lingers on the tongue and lends some depth to the mouth feel. The flavor and nose are quite similar. A reall easy drinker. Recommended."
"Pours a sparkling clear golden. Lots of bubbles seen rising in this but surprising the mouthfeel isn't overcarbonated, in fact it's VERY smooth. The smell initially makes you go ""Woh!"" It's very sweaty, musty. However the taste isn't anything like that. Just slightly earthy, very light, and a bit fruity, finishing dry. So easy to drink. Just what was needed on a hot night in southern California like tonight. I even preferred this to the Saison Dupont I had right after."
"A very intense Saison! I would like to pair this up with some apricot goat cheese!!"
"Drinkability: Pretty drinkable and enjoyable. Overall, this may be my favorite of the style."
"Not a big saison fan but had to give this one a try because it is from Lost Abbey, tried to go to this release party had to get some work done instead unfortunately, not a bad brew but average among this brewery's other beers, might drink again next year when it is released, worth trying"
"this beer all sort of qualities from tripel to wit to saison, but stays firmly in the latter for the most part. it has a range of flavors, but they remain subdued letting it's saison colors shine through. highly drinkable, the bottle goes awfully quick."
"D - Reasonably drinkable and very reminiscent of a witbier. Not too complex, but enjoyable overall, with an excellent mouthfeel."
"Served in my Delirium Tremens tulip. Poured a translucent orange-gold with lots of effervescence present during the tasting. Three-quarter inch off-white head quickly dissipated into a skim of foam and ringlets. Some watery sheets of lacing, but poor retention. Scents of lemon zest, yeast (funk was very much in the background and hard to detect) and some spiciness. Flavors similar to nose with a bit of a grassy presence, and the addition of clove, hops for bite, and green apple. Lively mouthfeel with a bit of a burn across the tongue and palette, followed by a clean, tart finish. Good drinkability that really hits the spot on a warm day. Solid offering from Lost Abbey."
"Pours a darker straw color with a finger of actively bubbling foam. Smell has some funk to it, a bit of sweetness, some Belgian yeast, and maybe a touch of hops. Taste follows suit, with some sweet malt, a nice Belgian yeast flavor, mild hops, and a nice bit of funk to it. It's almost more like a Belgian Pale Ale than a Saison I would think. It's pretty good overall. Mouthfeel is crisp, with a nice dry finish. This is a fairly drinkable saison. Not my favorite style by any stretch, but Lost Abbey has done something good here."
"Carnevale Ale has some serious competition, since Belgian tripels, BSPAs and saisons are some of the finest beers in all the world. The fact that it doesn't quite enter that rarefied air is nothing to be ashamed of. It's still delicious, immensely drinkable beer that continues the seemingly unending parade of excellence coming out of San Marcos."
"D: My feeling about this is about the same as with their year-round brew Devotion. It's not bad, but at the rate that I'm going to drink a hopped up pale ale, I would probably look elsewhere."
"Typical LA presentation, caged and corked w/o freshness info of any sort to be had. Pours moderately cloudy light honey, light tan loose head, leaving clouds of lacing. Floral notes and light pepper in the nose. Yummy typical saison notes, spice, yeast, hops. Pepper up front, drying hops throughout.Minor sour character, add just a bit to the complexity. Major league yeast cake on the bottom of the bottle, leading to an enjoyable yeasty final pour and nutty/yeasty final memory of this offering. Pleasant and worthy creation from Lost Abbey. Bring on the spicy food/BBQ and enjoy this one."
" This is a nice pick-me-up after a hot summer day style brew. The lable is a keeper."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, medium bodied and creamy. Very refreshing with just the right punch of carbonation. This would be a great brew on the beach on a hot day. Overall, a tasty take on a Saison from the Lost Abbey crew. I'm glad I grabbed a bottle of this and wish I had more!"
"Pours a medium golden orange with a light white head. Semi hazy look from the first pour of the bottle. Smell is floral, and honey like, with a delicateness about it. Some lemon perhaps as well. Taste is lightly bretty perhaps??? Somewhat of a drying, dusty floral taste with light malt presence and a touch of hops coming through as well. Didn't get smacked in the face with spices, but perhaps a light amount were there. Really easy drinking and nice. Just a tad mild flavored, but perhaps that is why I was so pleasantly surprised..."
"Carnevale Ale is a well-crafted, excellent beer. It is not my favorite offering from Lost Abbey, but well worth drinking."
"Taste is earthy and spirited with a great hop blend mixed with fresh baked bread and a wonderful spiciness. Hops come again in the dry spritzy finish, damn this shit is refreshing! A mild barnyard funk in the background, no brett in this one, but somehow there is a slight funk, not sure of Tommes secret on this but it is the most controlled funk I Have come across in a saison before. Mouthfeel is yeasty, dry, spritzy, perfect summer quaffer. Drinkability is perfection, a phenomenal warm weather beer. Probably the best Saison I have had in years. It's like a lighter more refreshing Avec! Fantastic job"
"Drinkability: Refreshing and quite tasty. A real mouth-pleaser!"
"D: pretty tasty and easy drinking. I'd have another if I had one."
"Pours a hazy golden with a slight head. What head there is sticks around as a swirly cap. The aroma is an intereesting combo of earthy/piney hops and some typical Saison aromas of Belgian yeast, coriander, white pepper and citrus rind. Pretty pleasant. Taste has similar components with a fairly pronounced bitterness at the end. Lots of citrus rind flavors here. These American hopped Belgian styles seem all the rage for certain breweries now, and while this shares some of those typical flavor components, it doesn't go overboard with the hops or spicing and achieves a nice balance. My only complaint is that it's a bit soft in the mouth. I need a litttle more bracing pepperiness or herbal zing in my Saison. Still, quite nice."
"For American everyday saisons, I'd take Hennepin esp.since it's a for a couple dollars less. That shouldn't take away from this as being one of the better American versions."
"I like this one. It's refreshing and easy drinking. It's much lighter than some of the other beers in the Lost Abbey lineup, but it's tasty and very sessionable."
"Pours a foggy toasted gold with a puffy white one finger head that dies down to a thin layer of bubbles. Some stickiness on the sides, nothing to go crazy over though. Smell consists of yeast, banana, clove, and pepper. Some honey and a bit of citrus hops find their way in the nose as well. Taste is very similar to the smell. Fluffy banana and spices but nothing over the top, very calm and clean. Sweet honey throughout. Hops show up towards the end with a slight citrus zest and a somewhat puckering mouthfeel. I was hoping for more in the hops department though after reading the description. Mild carbonation for the style with a light to medium body. Another Americanized Belgian, not bad though. I could see myself enjoying this one during a warm summer night, luckily I have another bottle to do just that. Definitely worth a try."
"The body is mid but high for style. Overall this is more of a funky Belgian Wit but some nice positive qualities to really enjoy."
"750ml corked bottle purchased from the Beverage Warehouse in LA for $8.99. This was my second Lost Abbey beer, and it matched the style very well. The smell was funky with aromas of grass, spice, maybe some apple, and generally good things. The taste was just like the smell, very funky and addictive. I think this competes well with any saison I've had to date, including the best from DuPont. Highly recommended."
"D: A really nice ale from Lost Abbey, had it with an Italian style dinner, it really hit the spot, another winner from Tomme Arthur."
"Drinkability is very good. Not a great beer, but a very good one. All in all... a nice and interesting Saison. This is my first beer from Lost Abbey, (though I've had Port Brewing before...) if this is any indication on their beer quality, then I look forward to trying more."
"This was a real let down. I wasn't sure if I was drinking a saison or a witte. Either way, it wasn't very impressive. If they somehow kicked up the flavor and made it more rich, it would have some legs, but it's just not there."
"D- I am torn on this beer. It drinks like a wit but is billed as ""Saison-style."" It is a decent wit but a poor saison. Give it a shot if you can but it is leaving me conflicted."
"D. Carnevale is just... ok. More carbonation and a little more assertiveness would do wonders for this beer. It's not bad by any means, but it's Lost Abbey and they can, and do, make far better beers."
"Purchased: Patron Saints"
"Lost Abbey brews have always been a bit of a ""hit or miss"" experience for me. This one's clearly a miss. I was kind of taken aback by some of the high reviews, as this beer, while solid, is not one of their upper tier efforts. If this was priced in the three to five dollar range, I'd probably chalk it up as an interesting experiment and maybe buy a few to sample later. At 8.99, though, there are far better options amongst Lost Abbey offerings, let alone other breweries."
"Overall, this was another knockout from Tomme and crew. I have said it before; there are two breweries that are just consistently outstanding for me, Lost Abbey and Pisgah. Lost Abbey though is a whole new level and this just reinforces it. If you can get this, you must it is insanely good and well deserving of any hype."
"Well balanced and refreshing, it will go down better in summer - well, perhaps California is warmer than Wisconsin now :)"
"Overall: Another quality brew by Lost Abbey. A nice Saison for a 80 degree Florida winter day. It was pretty good tasting, and rather refreshing. Glad I had the chance to try it."
"Bottom line: This Saison is hitting my taste buds really well and I look forward to drinking it again. My thanks to Joey for grabbing some for me!!"
"Easy to drink, and I'm excited about trying more down the line, but I feel like one bottle for the cellar is plenty."
"I see this one as a cross between a saison and a Belgian Strong Pale Ale. It has characteristics of each to me. But having said so, thoroughly enjoyable."
"One of the lower abv beers I have had from Lost Abbey but tasty indeed."
"Good refreshing taste with alcohol well hidden, a balanced flavor, and just a hint of bitterness on the finish. Highly drinkable."
"Overall, I enjoyed this beer, but it probably would've gone better with a hot summer day and some babes in bikinis rather than me sitting here freezing on a friday watching UFC."
"I think if you like the grapefruit overtones in your beer that you need to try this one.. it isnt my favorite flavor, but for what it is, a saison, its right on target with the description of what it should be."
"Another tasty addition to the Lost Abbey line-up."
