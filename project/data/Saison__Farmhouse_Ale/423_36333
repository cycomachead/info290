4.24,-1.2,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.5,4,"Got to try this on draft at a local watering hole. I am not yet a big fan of Belgian style, but based on ratings I wanted to give this a shot. I have to admit, I was apprehensive given some of the descriptions of it tasking like "funk" or "Band-Aid", but I enjoyed this more than expected. Pour was clean and clear with ample head; scent was ripe with that Belgian spice. Taste was malty and sweet up front, and I caught the Brett earthiness on the finish but by no means was it distressing. This was my first taste of a Brett beer, and I'll be trying more when possible. Coming from a non-saison drinker, this is a good brew.","LouZ","Feb 02, 2015"

5,16.6,5,5,5,5,5,"I have had this bottled and on tap and it is better bottled. The cork releases with a pop which gets louder as the beer ages releasing herbal and spicy hop aromas mingling with cidery, yeasty fruit aromas with a little barnyard funk that gets more pronounced as the beer ages. It pours a lively, hazy straw with a fizzy quickly dissipating, fluffy head. In older versions the head is more pillowy and persistent. Bread and biscuit malt flavors support and mellow the tart, citrusy funky, earthy saison yeast flavors. Mid-palate reveals some peach. The palate finishes dry and tart with a moderate hop accent. The Brettanomyces really shows up with a very finely bubbled, soft, moussey texture that becomes more luscious and alluring as the beer ages.","pat61","Jan 25, 2015"

Don't get me wrong, I love a good IPA.  I just think they over did it a little bit.  The intense bitterness and slightly tart flavors create an overwhelming flavor, in my opinion.  Nonetheless, I am enjoying it.","bnes09","Oct 09, 2014"

4.91,14.5,4.5,4.75,5,5,5,"To me this is almost as perfect as a Saison can get. It looks amazing in a tulip glass, the colour, the head. It hits you first on the nose with that beautiful sweet funky brett. Your first sip has a little bit of bite from the carbonation, almost like champagne. For me the real winning part of this beer is the taste and the mouthfeel. It has a little bit of a pepper kick which to me is my favorite part of a Saison. The mouthfeel starts off with a bit of sharp carbonation bite but then as you let the beer sit it smooths out so much. Silky, funky, and sweet. On the finish, you notice more of the hops and dryness. I love this one with about a yr on it, but it has always been amazing. Changing ownership hasn't done a thing in my opinion, aside from make it more available and maybe lower the price? Love it!","JonnyBeers","Jun 10, 2014"

Not much is lost though, and pouring results in a predictably massive, airy head of persistent sea foam that extends an inch or more above the rim of the glass. Things eventually settle down to reveal a hazy orange body. The aroma is fresh and elegant rather than anything I would describe as "funky"...very Orval-like in its flowery nature, along with pear and hay. Big, flowery Brett, some pale malt sweetness, grass, orange peel, spicy yeast, and pomaceous fruit juices in the flavor. Medium-plus bodied, creamy, yet pretty drying. I wish it was a little lighter, something in the 6% ABV range, but still a tasty treat. I'll probably snag a bottle of this year's batch to try it fresh for comparison.","wedge","May 05, 2014"

I have no idea why this needed to be an 8.5 percent beer but the alcohol is way over the top, solvent, and ruinous. Wouldn't even say it is sharp or acidic or really even very sour. It has none of the classic brett characters except a few notes I picked up in aroma. Undrinkable. I love Bouevard, Tank 7, and sour saisons but this is not good. Maybe I kept it too long, but it is vintage-dated and says "best by 2-2014". If others are having positive experiences with this beer than I suppose it is intended to be enjoyed fresh.","JudgeRoughneck","Jan 26, 2014"

4.42,3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled in 3/2013. Pours moderately hazy/cloudy bright golden amber color with a 2-3 finger foamy and rocky white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty foamy lacing clings around the glass, with plenty of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big pineapple, pear, lemon zest, orange zest, apple, hay, floral, grass, pepper, light bread, light must, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity brett, earthy yeast, and moderate malt notes; with good strength. Taste of pineapple, lemon zest, orange zest, pear, apple, pepper, clove, hay, grass, floral, light bread, light must, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of pineapple, bright citrus, pepper, clove, bread, hay, grass, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and balance of bright citrus/tropical brett flavors with fruity/spicy yeast and moderate malt balance; with a great malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. High carbonation and medium bodied; with a very crisp, smooth, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an incredible saison! All around amazing balance and complexity of brett/yeast and moderate malt flavors; and super smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. An extremely delicious offering.","superspak","Nov 01, 2013"

The taste is Saison crisp meets Brett funck. Citrus, funk, grain, and hints of sourness and pepper. Dry, crisp finish. Medium-light body with crisp carbonatin. Overall, this beer is a winner!

4.19,-2.3,3.75,4,4.25,4,4.5,"I didn't expect to get this beer during this visit, but I'm not one to argue. It pours a partly-cloudy golden-brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises orange zest, cracked wheat, coriander, light black pepper, mild Brett, and a vague sense of banana peel in the background. The taste brings in more of the same, the Brett mixing with the wheat, citrus, and spices to form a very pleasant sweetness with a swirl of spices. A pall of Belgian-style yeast hangs in the air, intermingling cooperatively at times with everything else. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation, a smooth feel, and a drying finish. Overall, a damn fine saison, one that uses the Brett to an immense benefit, rather than overdoing it and turning things into a damn Brett-bomb. This is some tasty-ass shit right here.","TMoney2591","Aug 15, 2013"

I can also detect lemon and banana.  Very bready, malty taste up front with strong Brett funk and more of a banana type aftertaste.  There is some spiciness and very slight tartness at the end.  Good beer, but I do favor other saisons over this.","jngrizzaffi","Jul 13, 2013"

5,16.6,5,5,5,5,5,"When it first opens a rush of floral notes hits you. The eggshell white head about 2.5" thick. Lots and lots of carbonationation. It was like looking at a champagne glass. Very light straw color like SRM 1. Citrus and floral notes followed earthy notes. Stronger than the Tank 7 and can pick up on the Brett yeast. Medium body followed with light lacing. So many flavors jump out like pineapple, lemon, grass and white peach. I am so glad I waited until the release of the 2013 to drink the 2012. Boulevard really out did themselves this time, may need to get a second bottle of the 2013 to age as well.","darthhamby","May 29, 2013"

4.22,-1.6,4.25,4,4.25,4.5,4.25,"The beer pours with a very aggressive and massive head which has me thinking that the brett has been busy in this beer. The head is slightly off white and made up of a gradient of bubbles going from small to large and creating a creamy crown that stretches above the lip of the glass. The head also takes forever to calm down in the glass, which makes drinking the beer a bit difficult. The head leaves a lacing of large soapy bubbles on the sides of the glass, leaving a roadway of lacing moving across the glass. In color, the beer pours a pale golden yellow to straw yellow with a maelstrom of bubbles whirling around and feeding the massive head. The beer’s body actually looks stunningly clean and clear, with only the slightest hint of a yeast haze. On the nose, the beer smells of hay and sweet funk with bits of pineapple citrus and slight sweaty horse. This beer smells bretty and beautiful with nice grassy spice notes and hay-like character. On the tongue, the beer tastes of spicy funk and bitter, chalky grass with bites of acidic citrus. The flavors begin as spicy malt, moving quickly into grassy bitter notes with splashes of funky pineapple with touches of chalky bitter flavors and big hay-like hops. A slight sweet caramel malt sits beneath everything, and the finish alcoholic pineapple across the palate. The aftertaste rings with slight citrus funk and touches of hay. In the mouth the beer feels medium in body with some thickening of the palate. The carbonation is rich and creamy on the tongue and helps to keep the sweet funk in check. The mouth is left with acid-neutralizing spittle swimming on the tongue and a slight dryness from the grassy bitters. Overall, this is a lovely, funky, complex saison with some nice weird characters. The alcoholic finish is the only complaint I have with this beer. This is a superb saison.","Maxwell","Apr 14, 2013"

Overall this was a beer I have been wanting to try, Thanks Dan this was an unexpected treat. I like the drinkability I could have probably drank the whole bottle myself.

The resulting mouthfeel is that you're drinking the head of the freshly poured beer: not exactly desirable and kind of amateurish. Closes out semi-dry, with notable ethanol burn on the back of the palate and in the nostrils. In general, this was over-carbonated, and a tad too alcohol-heavy for its own good.","falloutsnow","Oct 20, 2012"

The beer appears to be quite carbonated, and there is some nice lacing coming from the head which retains itself well. As expected, there is a lot of sediment visible as well. The aroma is very intriguing! I can sense a background of juicy hops, with herbal brett, and farmhouse funk front-and-center. The taste is spectacular and complex, starting with a big smack of tanginess and lemongrass. There's some tart candy, lots of peppery spice, alpine herbs, and fruit esters in there as well - apple and pear come to mind. The entire package is medium bodied, coats the mouth, and is very smooth and relatively balanced. Overall, I don't think there is any other beer quite like this.

Some sediment seen floating around, but still clean looking beer. Smell is overrun with brett, a very nice effervescent scent coming from it with some pale malt backing and biscuits. Some faint fruit shows up to with some barnyard characteristics with warming. Taste is very good, meaning I really liked it. I've had a lot of saison/brett beers recently, a lot running middle of the pack. Boulevards got it going on while this bottle has 2 years on it. Bright brett notes, funkiness, damp blanket, hay, earth, orange, lemon, citrus. Some pale malt backing rinses everything out at the end while the brett stings the tounge a bit, which Im all for, spicy. Feel is at about medium with sparkling carbonation and a spicy aftertaste. I could do a half bottle of this, but a whole one would be a bit much, sharing is caring.","BARFLYB","Sep 03, 2012"

As a Kansas Citian I'm embarrassed to admit I probably talk more shit on my hometown brewery than needed, but this shows where Bully's true heart is at. It is beers like this, the Rye on Rye and the Double Wide IPA that make me want to boast of KC's beer scene. It is an exceptional take on the trending, but nonetheless classic, saison style. The Brett, in my opinion, should respect the taste buds of regular fans of the Saisons (such as the DuPont), but I also found it pleased the palates of my APA drinking buds.","jrenn","Jun 09, 2012"

I was a bit worried about a gusher, but the beer stayed put. Pours with a big billowy white head that has some great staying power with a bit of nice lacing, but there is definitely too much head here. Aroma is very nice and fruity with a lot of Belgian pale ale characteristics, not much funk or brettyness than I would have expected or wanted. Flavor is mildly sweet and fruity, but nice and dry and crisp, a bit more barnyard than the aroma (especially in the aftertaste), and a mild alcohol bite. Mouthfeel is very light with good refreshing carbonation. Exactly the dry effervescent beer I would have wanted.","Agold","Jan 24, 2012"

Served in a tulip glass, the beer pours a hazy gold color with about an inch and a half frothy off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. Aroma is a bit spicy, the brew smells like peppery spice, bready malt, citrus peel, apricots, earthy yeast and brett. The brew tastes like bready malt, citrus peel, herbs/flowers, earthy hops, hay, brett and a bit of mint. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, and it's well carbonated.

The beer was poured into a tulip glass. The appearance is a yellow hazy color with big cabonation that lead to a foamy head that is lacing. The aroma is quite interesting....lavender, corriander, orange peel are all possible scents. The taste is a crisp ale that has spice and tartness, not much malt...if at all. The combination helps to mask the higher ABV. Mouthfeel is good...higher abv and carbonation make this more of a sipping beer. Overall it is a good beer!","WoodBrew","Oct 09, 2011"

Smell is of sour apples, spices, and the classic funky earthy brett smell. Taste is of grains, spices, yeast, and a subdued funky brett flavor. I was actually expecting this to be more sour and funky than it is. The aftertaste is of spices and yeast. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a medium body and smooth mouthfeel.

4.57,6.5,4.5,5,4.5,4,4.5,"Vintage 2011. Consumed 8-7-2011. Lots of hype with this beer. Outstanding ratings and reviews, which I always get excited about, but in the back of my head i wonder if all the reviews follow the initial good ones- not wanting to go against the crowd so to speak. Popped the cork, and a CRAZY huge head, just as expected. Smelled like tank7, perhaps even more pronounced barnyard aromas. Hay, dusty wood, that horse blanket thing, some tropical fruit from hops, and a faint balsamic tart smell - the brett. Tastes amazing. Refreshing. TONS of flavor. that tartness from the brett, the yeasty funk layers, and some earthy hops in the back. Mouth feel is great- not too carbonated, but a very bubbly drink. It really matched the hype. I hope the ones I tossed in the cellar will become more funky over time.","JonasJonas","Sep 22, 2011"

The Brett is quite bold throughout which creates an interesting predicament; I don't know if aging this would make the brew evolve and become more enjoyable or if it will get completely dominated by Brett. Regardless, as-is the dryness an snap to the finish kept me interested, I'm sure I could have tackled the bottle myself. I really appreciate you sharing this one with me Leon.","stakem","Aug 17, 2011"
4.52,5.4,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"O: This is truly a sensational beer. The interactions between ingredients makes for a refreshingly unique crisp veggie and herby bread character. The flavors never appear naked. Lemony Kale, buttery watercress, sharp raw onions, creamed artichokes, and the list goes on. This is a fine dining pairing with infinite potential. Alone this is a fancy resturaunt appetizer, but aged this might be a delicious bretty feast. I'm so glad to have a bottle to age. This a magical earthy garden beer, where hops act as mentor to young funk.","Cavery","Aug 15, 2011"

4.5,4.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Aptly named, at the brett is center stage with this beer. Aggressive head that quickly settled down. Earthy, funky, tropical-fruity - the odd but interesting mix that brett brings to the table is abundant. Fairly crisp malt, but the yeast softens it a good deal. Alchohol is a bit too up front and asserts a harsh edge at the front.","Brent","Aug 08, 2011"

4.33,0.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"O: Highly drinkable and amazingly refreshing, especially on this hot July evening. The funky notes from the addition of brett are a great complement to the base beer. The 8.5% ABV is really well hidden.","Azurescens","Jul 24, 2011"
4.48,4.4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"The taste is also brett-dominated. Appropriately dry. Far too drinkable for the ABV... though you can tell it's there. The funk is the base of the taste. Earthy and horse blanket. Maybe a bit of sugar cookie and lemon back there. All well blended and something I keep wanting to drink more. This is great stuff and I'll enjoy downing the rest of the bottle.","UTCengOwl","Jul 22, 2011"
4.55,6.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"D/O - Drinkability is high. This isn't the most sexy beer, but it's an interesting concept that has a near flawless execution. Although Brett beers and saisons aren't exactly near the top of my list of favorite styles, this is an excellently crafted beer that is worthy of praise. Solid and keeps me coming back for more. This is a beer that shows that craft beer can be considered in the same realm as wine and fine spirits.","nhindian","Jul 19, 2011"
4.3,0.2,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"7fity of the 2009. Pours hazy straw yellow with a huge pillowy head. Aroma is brett-a-riffic with citrus and soap.

World class.","sleestak4life","Jul 19, 2011"

3.61,-15.9,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a hazy yellow-ish orange color with a large white head that left some sheets of lacing on the glass. Aroma is dry, grassy, some notes of lemon and only a very light brett funk. Taste is pretty much the same, brett notes are very subtle, lightly tart, a touch of lemon and leather, but man this thing is dry and really crisp and refreshing. A bit of fruit and citrusy hops in the background. Nothing really stands out in the flavor, everything is just very light and mellow. I suppose I was expecting more brett/lemon character, but it's bone dry and not overly complex. Crisp, dry mouthfeel, carbonation is also lower than expected. Maybe I was expecting way more brett character,maybe this just needs more time in the bottle, but I'm not overly impressed. It tastes good, but just not much flavor overall. I say hang on to these bottles for a year and see what happens.","KeefD","Jul 15, 2011"

4.03,-6.1,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Overall I really enjoyed this beer. It is equally as good as the Saison Valtour that I had the other day but not as Brett influenced as I was hoping for/expecting judging from the name. Two years haven't added much funk so I assume this guy can/should be saved for at least 3 more years, so if you have one, hide it from yourself and forget about this for a while if your looking for more funk. I think it just fine right now though, highly recommend, definitely 1 of the top 2 Saisons I have ever had.","claspada","Jul 08, 2011"

But overall, this fits like a glove for the hot weather. My only criticism is, I think that Tank 7 (known for being the little brother of this bad boy) is actually my favorite.

4.47,4.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The flavor hits the palate with spicy, herbal hop notes and a bready, Bretty follow-up. The Brett cuts through the grainy maltiness before clashing against a fruity, boozy finish of Granny Smith apple and lemon.

The rocky white head is absolutely *massive* (think 4+ fingers worth of foam), and has crazy good staying power. Lacing is a bit of a letdown though, especially for the style. Nose is very powerful, I can smell it even before I pour the bottle. It's pretty close to an equal blend of granny smith pale malt sweetness and the expected barnyard funk, with the scales maybe tipped just a bit in favor of the brett. The flavor largely follows, but the addition of a strong black pepper presence really elevates the beer. The mouthfeel is really superb. The body is exceptionally rich/smooth while still maintaining a dry finish, and the carbonation is very explosive, giving Saison Brett a sensation of lightness that belies its 8.5% ABV. This is my second beer from Boulevard, the first being BBQ, and I'm not sure which impresses me more.","axeman9182","Feb 24, 2011"

A little bit of nice floral earthiness that comes in at the back to really bring a nice layer of additional complexity. The taste starts with a little punch of band aid funkiness followed by a peppery lemony sugar sweetness. The very nice funky Brett notes follow and really bring a nice bit of dusty earth in the finish. The beer is fairly alcoholic requiring it to be slowly sipped, but the flavors are so nice and complex that I keep going back for more. I also think it is slightly too carbonated for me.

The back of the bottle suggests aging this for a few years to get the Brett to really come into its own; I think I'd like a bit more Brett presence here, and might hold onto my second bottle for a little while.

You can tell this brew had a pretty heavy hand of bittering hops to begin with and some of the lemony fruitiness helps that linger on awhile. Dry, effervescent finish, carbonation is high and I like that in a saison. Malts are a little less neutral than some of the classic Belgian examples - still light, but contributes some sweetness and even some biscuity flavors. This beer is so easy to write about, so much going on. I think I like this beer at about the 1-1.5 year mark the best.

Some alcohol is present in the aromas but not overpowering. After the head fizzles away, I finally got to take the first sip. Taste is unbelievably good. Plenty of yeast and breads with a semi dry finish. No alcohol is tasted. I would love to see how the yeast characteristics continue to develop with more aging. Mouthfeel is dry and medium bodied. Drinkability is good. Taste is right on queue. A very refreshing saison that can be enjoyed year round. I hope Boulevard continues this as one of their smokestack series brews.","abrand","Apr 18, 2010"

The taste is spicy, yeasty and citrusy, with some apples and a very little amount of funk, but it's delicious! The carbonation is too much, but if you age it I'm sure it will be okay.

The taste itself if amazing. Smooth and funky all the way through. Thoroughly enjoyed this one.

4.27,-0.5,4.5,5,4,5,3.5,"Poured into a tulip which quickly formed a monsrously huge white head. Cloudy orange-yellow beer with good levels of lacing and retention. Normally I would not describe saisons or brettanomyces as smelling amazing, but Saison-Brett's nose is absolutely off the charts. Sweet lotus blossoms, rose petals, hibiscus, and various flora made for one of the best saison aromas I have experienced. The beer itself tasted of dried apples, spicy cloves, and a very light level of funk. The flavor was good, but honestly the aroma is what makes this beer. The mouthfeel is also spot on, super creamy medium carbonation and a nice light body. This beer looks, smells, and feels amazing, just too bad the taste may be the weakest link here (though it is still good).","vacax","Dec 24, 2009"

I mean, I like their Bully Porter and such, but this beer borders on outstanding. It is visually very well represented with solid and diverse aroma and flavor profiles. What more can you ask for? All this said, there is no way in heck that I would put it up there with the top of the Dupont heap of Saisons, but this is a solid offering from an American brewery.

4.2,-2.1,4,4,4,4,5,"75cl bottle shared by Diomede. Opaque gold with yeast chunks floating around and a white, frothy head. The aroma is just straightforward citrus and brett with lots of lemon peel, grass, and hay. Not really intense though, and seemed to dissipate after awhile, needing a top-up to kick back into action. The flavor is relatively clean for a saison, but gets all the nuances in there, with dry malt flavors, soft yet spicy bitterness and hop flavors, and a nice light bretty funk. Medium-light body with higher carbonation and smooth bubbles. Nothing really amazing about it, but it is no doubt a quality and well constructed saison. Everything balances out to make an exceptionally drinkable beer, especially considering the alcohol content. I'm not sure how old this bottle was, but it did have a relatively bright, fresh quality to the flavor and aroma, so maybe more time in the cellar would add some interesting stuff to it with the yeast developing a little more. Definitely worth seeking out again.","bulletrain76","Dec 06, 2009"

A mix of fruits but nothing specific and has that wonderful Belgian aroma. The taste is much like the aroma but more hops and a bite at the end. I keep getting a sour apple taste just before the hops and pepper take over. It has a the earthy feel nailed and I bet would be even stronger over time. I can't get over the finish on this one. You keep thinking sweet but the spice like finish is great. The carbonation is a bit much but expected. This is a really good Saison and the Brett takes it to another level.

Taste is great, it's not over-the-top with the brett, balances nicely with some citrus (lemons?), a bit tart, some leafy hops again, some apple. Definitely a subtle sipper.

As a result, it's enjoyable, easy-drinking, and I can see how it could have an appeal to most everyone who enjoys good beer.

Pours a cloudy orange, almost a pineapple juice colour, loose white head forms, drops to a thick ring and leaves a ton of lace all over the glass. Smell is real neat, pineapple, very tropical, mangoes, hay, honey, really funk, some earthy sourness, fruit, barnyardy, really cool. Taste is good too, lots of pineapple up front, very tropical like the aroma, mango, hay and honey, grassy, barnyard funk and horse blanket, fruit, sharp and acidic. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with really high carbonation, it works with this one though. Kind of lemony and tart going down, probably the closest in flavour to an Orval I've ever had.

4.35,1.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"I have had this beer numerous times, and it is one of my favorites in the Smokestack series. The Bright gold-yellow body is covered by a thick, creamy head that was created with a not too agressive pour into a wine glass. The foam settles down to a 1/4 inch thick cap that remains until the end. In the nose I get wonderful fruity spicy and funky aromas. The beers flavors pretty much match its aromas, but with a hint of sweetness that help create balance. It also displays a really appealing fruity tartness. The finish is long, dry, tart, and a bit bitter. The mouthfeel is medium-full, but with active carbonation that kind of sets the flavors dancing around my mouth. Boulevard Saison-Brett is nicely drinkable, and as it warms, and the carbonation settles, it becomes more-so.","Sanford","Jun 29, 2009"

The brett is very potent- and beautifully so. Peppery and spicy throughout with a great funk flavor that isn't to intense in any one way- It's Diverse and lets many different flavors shine.

Poured a pale orange-gold with a bright white head and webs of lacing. Clarity changes from fairly translucent to hazy over the course of the tasting. Nose is pretty mild - a little medicinal and some phenols. Taste follows nose - medicinal, minty and some citrus. Mouthfeel is light and lively and clean finishing. Really drinkable brew.

I wish I had another bottle or two to see how the brett continues to develop over time, because I'm sure the hops will fade a bit while the brett imparts more funky, tart character.

4.5,4.9,4,4,5,5,4,"Thanks goes out to Avalon68 for throwing in this awesome extra, which was on my wants list. This is batch #1 and is bottle number 5269 out of 11950. I decanted this beer in to a Stella Artois glass. First thing I note is that the head is massive, nearly three fingers worth of pillowy, fizzy white heading. Color is a radiant gold, with what looks like a chaotic amount of carbonation going on inside. The heading really doesn't seem to want to go down on this one. Aroma is of peaches, lemon grass, some barnyard funk, mild spices and something very earthy. First taste reveals a real array of flavors. Big bursts of orange zest and lemon come through along with a dry champagne flavor. Some chalky medicinal show up as well. The Brett presence is not nearly as apparent as in the taste as it is in the smell. The carbonation on this beer is amazing. It really scrubs the palate like no other beer I have had, with the exception of Duvel perhaps. The 8.5% alcohol is masked very well. It never comes off boozy, and in fact just becomes more drinkable as it warms up a bit. My final thoughts are that this is my first Boulevard beer, and that it is a real achievement. I can see why it has risen to the top of the ranks within the Saison style. One last thing, make sure to pair this with some type of food. I found it went well with some simple Muenster cheese, but I can see it complementing all sorts of dishes. Cheers","jamie2dope","Mar 29, 2009"

I think I might have actually preferred it a little funkier with less strong of a comforting malty, bready presence.

Taste begins clean with a dash of sweet apple and pear followed by dry hay and spicy pepper. Midway is pretty grassy with a good amount of sour lemon. Aftertaste is lip smacking good, bready and sweet, just a great tasting Saison from start to finish. Mouthfeel is the only area that seems to suffer, but I say that loosely because it still got a 4 from me. Light and fluffy with a carbonation that's a bit too strong, but still not bad at all.

The aroma is of barnyard funk, wet wool, leather, oranges, sour apples, and the huge sour/tartness only bretta can provide. The aroma is very beautiful. It is so complex and so strong that I find myself losing myself in it. The taste is a bit mellower than the aroma. It has more the the saison characteristics (e.g. barnyard funk, leather, wet wool), and not as much of the bretta. It is still very nice, but it lacks to wow power the aroma has.

Just a great flavor-a perfect balance between sweet and sour. Very smooth and subtle maltiness. The sweaty aroma runs right into the flavor. Very pleasing spicy bite to it. No real hop bite but the spiciness makes up for it and accentuates the whole thing. Good mouthfeel-the lingering dryness is never out done as there is still a decent sweetness behind it all. Wow what a beer! I think this might be the first brett beer I have ever had KNOWING it had brett in it. Wild, weird and wonderfully funky. I need to try and homebrew a bunch of this. Simply great. Big thanks to jtrockchalk for the Secret Santa super treat!","lackenhauser","Dec 25, 2008"

4.16,-3,5,4,4,4,4.5,"This is pretty tasty, I do wish that it finished a bit drier (especially since as this ages it will get more and more carbonated, it is already over carbonated, and could become a bottle bomb, though with a champagne bottle this is not too likely). Visually perfect for a Saison, the ample carbonation projects a magnificent head, with lots of lacing and lots of staying power. Despite being a bit thicker and a bit sweeter than I generally prefer in a Saison, both these components work quite well in this beer; the extra touch of hop character (especially the American bent) certainly helps with this. It will certainly be interesting to see how this develops as the hops fade and the Brett becomes more prominent, especially if it can keep from becoming explosive. Taken as a sum of its components (at least as far as aroma and flavor go), this beer is not nearly as good as it is in the complete whole; e.g. it is lacking in funky aromatic notes, isn't nearly dry enough, nor is the texture perfect. On the whole though this beer just works quite well and is very enjoyable. I am glad I have a couple bottles of this to age.","Gueuzedude","Nov 19, 2008"

If you don't like the funk, don't step up to this one. It's not overdone, but there is enough of it. Feel has a full carbonation that lays on the softer aide. Liquid is typical. A good saison. I haven't had the regular version, but this one is working for me nicely.","RblWthACoz","Nov 06, 2008"
4.65,8.4,4.5,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Batch 2008-01. Numbered bottle. This is a great beer, and I'm very interested to see how this ends up as the sourness increases from the Brett. Right now its delicious, andd the Brett is there, but its definitely a subtext to the other flavors. This is a beautiful beer as well with a hazy golden/orange color that almost glows in the glass and has a beautiful pure white head that leaves some lacing. The aroma is a wonderful mixture of the dry hopping and the peppery, fruity Saison notes, and the Brett. Smells of Lemon, coriander, white pepper, orange and grapefruit citrus- very juicy- and a slightly funky sourness. Lovely flavors of bright, juicy tangerine, lemon, an earthy bitterness, and and some herbal flavors with an underlying sourness that is light, but bright- not at all washed out. Fantastic! Smooth and creamy with that bright tangerine sourness in the background. Very easy to drink and no hint at all of the abv. I love this!","Georgiabeer","Nov 05, 2008"

3.62,-15.6,4,2,4,4,4.5,"Poured gently into a tulip and let the frothy head settle. The funk is not in the aroma, even as it warms, not inviting but not bad either. Spicy hop flavor washed away by a sweet/tart wave. I don't really get any leather/horse blanket funk until the aftertaste, which stays around for awhile. It is still very minor even as it warms. Real sticky mouth feel, keeps you licking your lips and roof of your mouth. More aggressively hopped than the original Saison with more body. Brett is extremely well balanced and according to the label with become more pronounced with age. I with I had a case cause I want to follow this up with my second bottle which is going away until August. I will update this review at that time.","sfreshnock","Oct 22, 2008"
4.35,1.4,4.5,4.5,4,5,4.5,"Drinkability is fairly high. It comes off as more bitter than tart to me. I dig the flavor though and I love the mouthfeel. I would certainly drink it again. I do wish it had a bit more in your face brett though, maybe I should age a bottle.","Goliath","Oct 21, 2008"
4.43,3.3,4.5,4,4.5,4,5,"Poured a corked and caged 750 into my Boulevard goblet. This beer pours a slightly hazy, golden pale straw with a huge 3 finger fluffy white head. This beer has great head retention leaving about a inch of a foamy head all the way down leaving behind beautiful lacing on the sides of the glass. The aroma is fruit esters, especially tart apples, a light grain bill, and just a hint of light funk coming through on the end of the nose. The taste up front also has the tart apple, fruity esters, a hint of spice - almost peppery and a really great musty flavor. The funk isn't overpowering but it comes through very well. The mouthfeel is light with just a bit of astringency. This is another home run in the Smokestack lineup. I will say that this bottle is on the funkier side of the 3 that I have drunk already. Each bottle seems to be developing on its own time.","hwwty4","Oct 20, 2008"
4.15,-3.3,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Great aroma. Citrus and spice with a little Brett funk. Medium bodied. More citrus, slightly sweet at the start but a dry finish. There is a bit of hop bitterness. More spice in the finish. Crisp and refreshing. Very drinkable. The last glass has a little more funk as the yeast is added in. It will be interesting to see what some age does to this beer.","homebrewhawk","Oct 19, 2008"
4.32,0.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Overall Impression - After looking forward to the Smokestack series for over a year I was pretty disappointed in the series. I felt that the saison was one of the better of the four, but not much better than average. With the brett added this beer is given the character that it badly needed. This had been turned into a pretty great beer. For an 8.4% ABV the alcohol is well hidden. I could drink several pints of this. I would put this in my regular rotation if I could. I will go get a couple more bottles while it's still there. If you have the chance to get a bottle I highly recommend that you buy it.","Hullabaloo2","Oct 17, 2008"

Smooth drinking, creamy. Absolutely smoother than can be expected . A mild bitterness.

According to my uncle, the bottle had been aging for about nine months. But he doesn't know where he is half the time, so take that for what it's worth. Pours a pale yellow color, with a rich, creamy head on top. Smell is complex...floral, fruit, grain, and peppery. Taste is even more complex. It's earthy, a hint of dried fruit, and horse blanket. After aging, the bret and horse blanket undertones become relatively subdued and make this beer very drinkable... but not with family. A very drinkable beer that requires some aging, but is well worth the wait.","jdubjacket","Jul 05, 2008"
