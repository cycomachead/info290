"Feel: medium-high carbonation; near medium body."
""
""
""
""
""
"But still a nice, unique example of the style"
"Overall:  This is a really good American version of a Belgian saison.  Very nice citrus flavors balanced with a bready, slightly sweet overtone.  The only thing keeping this beer from being great or even outstanding is that slight metallic taste in the finish."

"This is one of the best domestic Saisons I've had - the complexity of the smell and flavor keep me interested.  The mouthfeel, however, is very prickly, but the finish is pretty great. This would probably be a fantastic beer from a keg or aged for year in a bottle."
"I've been eager to try this one for quite sometime...  Two fingers worth of big fizzy slightly off white colored comprised of big and bigger chunky bubbles...  Decent retention...  The color is pale hazy lemony straw yellow...  A light to moderate bit of carbonation can be seen towards the top of the glass in small streaks...  The aroma is led by a big punch of lemon zest at the forefront...  Some hay and fresh cut grass...  Some very subtle Belgian yeast undertones...  The aroma is world class...  The flavor profile is almost equally exquisite...  The lemon zest is again at the forefront...  There are rich layer or grassy and earthy notes...  The faint Belgian yeast is also quite noticeable palate...  There is a faint bit of candied sugars as well...  The faintest hint of pepper on the deep finish...  The end result is a very nice, deeply complex and world class flavor profile...  The mouthfeel is on the fuller side of light bodied...  Spry with loads of prickly carbonation...  A bit chalky throughout...  Color me impressed by this offering...  This is a top notch Saison that I would welcome in my glass anytime and one that I would also highly recommend..."

"Another Two Roads production, this is worth trying if you get a chance."

"In sum, one of the best hoppy saisons I've ever had the pleasure of drinking. The yeast and hops work really well–hop selection here I think was key, as the use of more grassy, clean, and lightly fruity hops play well off the yeast's spiciness. A super beer that is great to see in 4-packs."
""
"Wow, I am usually a fan of the style but not familiar with the brewer.  But I had heard good things so I was optimistic.  Bummer!  Not a bad initial taste but very off on the finish.  A metallic taste that lingers with something that was off.  Had a decent saison smell, although still something off, overall barely got over a 3 from me who is generally over average and definitely for this style.  Maybe it just caught me on a bad day but for me there was something off that I could not put my finger on."
""
"Clear pale straw color.  A touch of pepper on the nose with a mild yeastiness but no heavy funk like many of this style.  Light bodied with a crisp flavor and a dry finish.  This works but it’s nothing I’d order again."
""
""
"Translucent golden brown with a pleasant foamy white head. Scent of alcohol and malts. Tastes is alcohol and fruit without being overly sweet with a faint bitter finish. Carbonation is pleasant for the mouthfeel. Overall a really delightful beer... I feel this review doesn't quite capture it's flavors, very complex and delightful."

"A strong, full-flavoured brew. Has a quite unique, earthy and peppery flavour on top of the usual hop bitterness. On the bitter side of the scale, and not for everyone, but offers something different to enjoy. Not the easiest drinking beer out and its heavier carbonation bloats slightly. However, good if you're not drinking many, and would pair up well with a spicy vegetable curry, stir fry or some grilled kangaroo which has a charred and grassy/gamey taste to match."

"Coriander leads the way on this beer, and I am not a big fan of that spice.  That being said, the body is right, the look is great.  were it not for the coriander, this would have been a good to very good beer."
"Overall AGAIN I went in giving it some leeway for being old and it still has a good taste for a hopped Saison. Worth picking up if you see it discounted."
""

"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip.  Pours a hazy medium golden amber with a half figer white head with good retention and nice lacing. Aroma of saison yeast, orange citrus, light sweet malt, coriander and clove; spicy. Flavor starts spicy and semi dry, develops semisweet citrus and fruit with a bit of funk the finishes dry with wild yeast funk and saison spice bitterness. Medium bodied with peppery carbonation. I really like the flavor progression on this saison, with both dryness and light sweetness alternating. Good fruit and malt flavors and a just enough funk to give it character. Stillwater was the first brewery to turn me on to the saison style and this is an example of how they succeeded. Nice domestic saison."

"330 ml bottle, cloudy golden colour with really good lacing. Smell has some apricot and a full fruity yeast aroma, banana, hay and pale malt, sweet a bit with also a ton of complexity. Taste is got a hefty carbonation with some banana and grape flavours, some cinnamon and bready malts, some peach and slight barny flavours, a bit of a hay overload before coming to a full finish with a bit of a high hop bitterness, finish then dries out. A ballsy full flavoured saison, some of the alcohol comes through and eventually it become apparent this is not up to the highest standards despite a full flavour. Pretty solidly built saison though, lot of flavour and good stylistically, perhaps my criticisms were a bit too harsh as it's quite tasty."

"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied by good flavors and aromas."
""
"taste: Bubblegum, clove, orange, spice, honey, artificial banana, slight lemon and a touch of grapefruit. A nice dry tartness to it with a good malt backbone."
""
""
""
"Overall: this is a bit on the sweet side up front, and a bit on the harsher side at the end, but overall is a quite drinkable and appealing saison. Worth a try if you like the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Over-the-top carbonation notwithstanding, this is one beautiful, tasty saison. There's plenty of complexity to keep the palate occupied, and few beers look prettier sitting in the glass on a hot day. It could probably benefit from a little restraint and refinement, but I like where Stillwater was going with this."
""
""
"O: A very solid, very respectable saison that is nicely styled and confidently executed."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: An above average saison that has nice crisp bitterness and good dryness. The smell and look were excellent however. Worth a try but I have had better in the style."
"O-delicious well represents the style nice barnyard fruity hoppy"
"Very impressive. I would gladly buy this one again."

"Fantastic example of one of my personal favorite styles. This will make a great grillin' companion. Easy to drink and refreshing, you definitely want to add this to your shopping list."
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 9/4/2013. Pours fairly hazy/cloudy bright gold color with a 3 finger dense and fluffy white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon zest, tangerine, orange peel, pear, apple, black pepper, clove, straw, grass, herbal, floral, light bread, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast ester, hops, and light-moderate malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big lemon zest, tangerine, orange peel, pear, apple, black pepper, clove, straw, grass, herbal, floral, bread, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Good amount of yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, tangerine, orange peel, pear, apple, black pepper, clove, straw, grass, floral, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity of fruity/spicy yeast ester, hops, and moderate malt flavors; with a great yeast/hop flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent saison! All around great complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, hops, and moderate malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
"Good job!!!!"

"Hazy peach color, aroma of sweet orange. Taste is light and refreshing, highlighted by orange peel and a floral and herbal presence. A hint of tartness and a very mild spiciness. Active creamy carbonation. Very easy drinking and enjoyable. I could see this being a crowd pleaser and I nice warm weather beer."

"O: A good beer. Glad I got to try it. I'll have to come back to it after I am able to enjoy some more saisons for another review."
""
""
""
"Definitely a keeper, and kudos to the brewery and to Twelve Percent."
""
"O- Well above average saison, though not nearly an Arthur or any other HF saison."
"Overall: a complex and tasty beer. probably the driest beer i have had. definitely worth trying more of stillwater's saisons"

"American saison to the fullest. The bitterness is a bit overwhelming but totally appropriate. For the style the beers dryness maximizes the biterness presence. The beer has a great apperance an Orange hue thats a bit hazy. A very appealing.g beer. Creamy texture wheaty. Low head retention, med high carbonation. A nutty slighty fruity aroma and flavor. Dominant nose is spicyness, black pepper"
""
"O-Great beer by Stillwater I only got one to try I must get some more soon."
""
""
""
""
"o: Really nice saison, but not quite up there with my favorite domestic examples of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Unique floralness together with sweet malts and citrus notes - this beer is not a typical saison but is very enjoyable nonetheless."

"O-A decent beer which would be perfect on a hot summer day."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Well above average beer. Enjoyable all-around."
"Aroma is spices, lemons and a hard to describe tangy/sweet/grainy element. The flavor is lemons, spices, citrus, very mild/slight spiciness from the malts and a tart/sour finish. Good complexity and not too spicy, another pretty good ale from Stillwater."
""
""
""
""
""
"Wonderful flavor, with a crisp, clean taste of citrusy goodness and a mellow estery character. I loved it."
""
"Overall, a great saison and one of the more memorable I've had given its crispness and the pronounced citrus aroma and flavor."
""
""
""
"Bright glowing yellow, big white head, spotty sparse lace. Aroma is great. Super refreshing clean and stinky citrus, earthy and herbal, doughy chewy malts, spicy and soft, juicy dank fruit and miscellaneous flowers. Taste is all of the above plus sugary through the finish. Briskly carbonated. I like this saison more than many I've had. Really well done. I could proceed to enjoy a lot of these."
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Bought off a store employee's recommendation. I'm loving this brewing company. It is astounding how much respect I have gained for this company in the limited beers I have tried (3 with a 4th in the fridge). Extremely affordable, sitting at 3 bucks a bottle. Very glad Crooked Stave and Stillwater formed this this beer trading alliance. I will promptly be snagging everything that I haven't tried from this company, they are that good!"

"Medium- plus  bodied,  dry, spicy and very slightly chalky finish.  Classic yeast character and finish;hoppy and fruit forward."
""
""
"12oz bottle ~$2.50. Bright orange color, slightly hazy, filmy head, looks quite good. Aroma is fruity, citrus, hops and at the same time derivative or maybe its just reminiscent of another well-known saison? Fruit flavor, hint of rusty metal, easy to drink. Overall an interesting saison but not something I will purchase again."
""
""
""
"O-This is a very solid saison. I appreciate how drinkable it is, while maintaining a complex flavor profile. The floral flavors are not overly perfumed and there is just a bit of spicy, grassy bitterness to keep things from getting gummy and sweet. If I were to pick nits, I wonder how this brew would be at about 5.5% ABV, so it is more of a table beer? Maybe it would lose some of the complexity, but as is, it is a solid beer."

"a real nice light saison. wheat malt driven, with a great yeast strain happening. pours real cloudy and pale light orange, with a dying off white head and good lace. I smell grazing cattle and white wheat in equal proportion, nothing out of the ordinary, but some real creative stuff here too. almost a Belgian triple, with candy sugar and spunky yeast. I taste wheat malt on the lighter side and a flocculated yeast that just adds tannic funk and coagulated protein density to a beer that should be real delicate otherwise. not a brewers error, but a critique nevertheless. great carbonation and a medium body that would be heavy if it didn't work so damn well. overall a great first beer from this crew, and something I am real eager to get back into. special stuff, and being American made makes it epic compared to its peers. worth your hard earned shrappy!"
""
"Overall – Very drinkable and enough flavour to keep you interested. I actually really enjoyed this one and will be buying more the next time I see it. I also really like the smaller format in 4 packs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly firey golden with a white head. Aroma is spicey, some ripe banana, pepper, atouch of lemon and grassy. Flavor is spicey,, lemon, a touch of toasted bread, pepper and a touch of some earthy hops. Again a little alcohol comes through, which detracts just a little. A crisp active mouthfeel. Overall, solid saison that I am really happy to see in Colorado. One I will buy again."

"Poured an orange-like gold with decent head and lace and a funky aroma, some spice and citric notes, and a little bit of spice and yeast but not much else in the fruit department. Taste is more of the same as a smooth, light to medium bodied beer passes my tongue with moderate spiciness, citric hop and light/tropical fruit flavors. Not much sweetness but beer is lively with lots of carbonation. I enjoyed this beer; consider it a simple saison that complements a warm day."
""
"Overall: A Saison verging on a Dubbel, this beer has a lot of complexity; the more you contemplate it, the more it surprises you"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-pretty solid and straightforward. I didn't enjoy it as much as some other stuff from Stillwater but still very enjoyable"
"O - Very nice Saison with a ton of spice. It is well balanced. Nick was nice enough to send it my way."
""
""
""
"Overall: I like this beer, but the perfume flavor is really distracting. I really loved this beer as a base beer that is put into barrels. I have tried the stateside saison that was aged in chardonnay barrels and that beer was awesome!"
"O: not going on my must have again, but I wouldn't shy away from it either. Little too tart up front, but that fades quickly into a fine beer."
"I'm admittedly no expert on saisons and have only tried a few but this one does nothing to make me want to delve further into the style. It's drinkable enough but the funky spicyness just isn't for me. I prefer the others I've tried like Jailhouse's Reprieve or even the Ovila with mandarins."

"Im a huge saison fan and this was a decent one."
""
"O - Another great, new world hopped farmhouse. Edges out Tank 7 for me by a nose. Stateside's citrus forward hop profile just really pairs well with their yeast strain."
""
""
"O: Saison's can be hit or miss for me. Id classify this one as a hit. Nothing exceptional but good nonetheless. Cellar Door is much better IMO though."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Refreshing when absolutely cold, but as it warms up, it harshens up too. Not the best, but not really the worst either. Its a bold saison."
"Overall its a pretty good saison enjoyable worth having again and again when the saison modes hits."
""
""
"I've been going out of my way to try several Saisons this summer and this is one of the better ones I've had. It is herbal and flowery like a good Saison should be, but it brings a nice subtle fruitiness to the game that makes a wonderful complement to the more earthy flavors and set it apart from some others I have tried. This is an excellent beer."
"More citrus, fruit and floral forward than the Cellar Door for me and reminds me of the classic strain from DuPont in many ways. Stillwater is brewing some damn good Saisons it seems. I gotta track me down some Debaucher to review because that beer was amazing on-tap a few months back."

"Overall- Very solid beer and very close to being a four. Definitely worth a try (unless you hate sage)."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 750ml bottle. Pours a cloudy/hazy orangey-yellow. Big billowy white head. The nose on this is really pleasant, very vinous with pineapple and typical spicy saison yeast notes. The taste is a lot different, though. It's very fruity and dry with a strong hoppy bitterness. Something is creamy and buttery here that seems a bit out of whack. The carbonation is huge. Interesting saison."
""
""
"Overall, very characterful saison. I don't think this is the freshest bottle so not a lot of hoppiness comes through, but that's okay. Perfect for a hot summer day. Would drink this again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Toasted malts and herbal, woody bitterness up front. Sweetish, slightly fruity banana malt fills in the palate. Peppery, spicy, herbal bitterness around the edges and increases into the finish. Yeasty, slightly funky notes. Dries out some in the finish. Lingering peppery bitterness and bananas. Medium body with a lively feel. A nice, easy drinking saison, with just enough funk and peppery bitterness."
""
""
"Bought in bottle but poured into glass. Way way too much carbonation to enjoy beer as fully as I should be able to. The color and haze are very nice and the smell is fantastic. Unfortunately the dry, somewhat bland taste is quite a disappointment....combine that with the subpar mouthfeel due to the carbonation and I graded this as a bit better than ok. I would drink it again, but only if someone else was buying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Nothing spectacular, but worth the single price I payed for it. I'll definantly try other Stillwater offerings, especially now that they're in 4 packs."
""
"Notes: Tasty from start to finish and quite drinkable. Cheers."
""
"Finishes sweet dry and bitter. An excellent saison that surely could compete with the more famous ones."
""
"Not as much flavor depth as imported version, but this one works well. Nice balance, easier drinking as you get thru the glass."
"O: I really enjoy this beer a lot and try to pick up a 4-pak whenever I see it on the shelves. I'm a big fan of the boys over at Stillwater and encourage everyone to try their stuff as they will not be disappointed. Balance is a bit bitter, which I like, and initial tartness is absolutely satisfying. Great yeast character that helps drive the entire beer. A must have Saison in my book and a go-to Saison, especially for the price when compared to some more popular imported examples. Great Beer."

"Overall I think this is a very well saison. Nothing spectacular about it, just very good."

""

"O - Great refreshing brew to quaff in the summer, the hoppiness is much appreciated. I also appreciate the fruitiness, there is some mustiness but it is subdued. Will certainly reach for this again."
"this beer pours a lightly hazy copper gold, exactly what i expect from a good saison. it has a huge head, thick, white and pillowy so be careful while pouring. Excellent lacing, the head takes about a minute or two to die down to a finger so thick it looks like you could peel it off. it certainly isn't going anywhere on its own... The smell was that of nothing more than a golden ale. Spice and little else which makes the taste, perhaps even more enjoyable than it is on its own cause, guess what, its a ruse. This is one complex and nicely balanced beer. I am usually not one for spicy beers so saisons are tricky for me. This one has a nice sweet malt flavor, the spice is similar to maybe a belgian dubbel. It's strong, but well complimented. There is also some decent hops presence here. Actually, nothing is very subtle, its all pretty strong but at levels that don't out do one another. Now, with a beer like this you can either add the yeast at the bottom of the bottle or not. This will do one of two things depending on the freshness of the beer. This one is still only about two months old and i made the mistake of not checking before i added the sediment. In the case of a young beer it is going to make it spicier. However, if you have a beer that's been around a little longer, 6 months to a year, you're going to get some added banana bread-ish sweetness and body which is what i was going for without really thinking. Oops. still good but i'm now having my second and enjoying it much more. Mouthfeel is nice, a bit sticky, full, small carbonation. Overall, a really ideal saison. i have a new regular."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: An excellent saison for the coming summer months. Strong enough to satisfy the beer geeks in your circle yet accessible enough for even the Bud drinkers to enjoy."
""
""
"Carbonations seems a bit excessive."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a very good brew - a Belgian/American IPA/saison hybrid-type of beer. I would buy it again."
""
""
"O- stateside is an excellent full bodies saison that is drinkable and forward of flavor simultaneously. Very impressive and creates a mindset to come back for more"
""
"Almost like a bready champaign, probably the best saison i have had."
""
""
""
""
"O - A very fine beer indeed. Excellent, standard take on the Americanized Saison. Complexity is there if you look for it, but you can simply drink and enjoy this one on a beautiful spring day and love it without thinking too much."
"A solid Saison, good to style. Makes me look forward to try more from Stillwater."
""
"One of the best American made saisons, for sure."
"Right on! ...And finally in a 12oz bottle. Thank you!"
""
""
""
"Saisons kind of come, and kind of go in my world, i.e., I don't really get a lot out of them, and don't find many embracing. That damning caveat out of the way, I have to say that I really like this one - the crazy amount of input flavours are deftly integrated - subdued, even, into a straight-ahead drinkable affair, one bereft of any extreme elements, which may be the one aspect of this style that I do wholly endorse, when suitably followed through with as it is here."
""
""
""
""
"O: A wonderful saison: dry, floral, complex and funky. Superb."
""
""
""
""
""
"Well done - complex, fresh and tasty. Go get some."
""
""
""
""
"this is a decent saison. i think personally, it would be a bit better if it weren't so bitter. when combined with the high carbonation, the bitterness just smashes the palate with a dirt like taste that makes this beer kind of hard to drink."
""
""
"O- This is a bit better than Cellar Door IMO. So glad they started distributing to Florida."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - First crack at Stillwater and I enjoyed this. A good farmhouse ale for the warmer months."
""
""
""
"O: this is a decent saison but nothing to go crazy over needs more flavor and smell but pretty good drinkable beer worth a try if its not an effort"
"Most sour of the 4 offerings I've had tonight. Good citrus character, a little funk."
""
""
""
"A decent saison, though it's not the side of the style that I prefer. Little funk, more light-fruity, flowery, and hoppy than I like. But not bad."
""
"O: There are some good parts of this brew, and there are some very underwhelming parts of this brew. I can think of dozens of better Saisons and Belgian Ales that I would prefer before this. Not that it's a bad offering. The appearance and Feel are quite nice. Good effort."
""
""
"Hazy golden with a couple fingers of lingering, wafty cream foam. Smells of co2, spice, a touch of citrus, some clay, a little bit of belgian yeast, and a good dose of light malts. Flavor is legit with yeast, creamed corn, sweet malt and a little touch of coriander and slightest hint of peppercorn. A little bit of herbal hops in there as well. Medium bodied with hi carb and a quick slick finish becomes slightly dry after a moments notice. Really good beer. Everything I've had from this brewer makes me happy."
""
"D - Nice balanced saison. Good yeast character."
"Overall: A very good saison and worth every penny i spent on it."
""
"This was a good domestic take on the style. It's not a style I visit often, but this was good. Thanks, Marco!"
""
"On draft Gainesville House of Beer. Pours cloudy orange-yellow with no head. Smells like a mimosa with hints of yeast funk. Taste is pumpkin, butterscotch, banana, caramel. Very unique saison. This is way heavy for the style, but lots of complex flavors going on. Relatively low carbonation to boot. I'm not sure where they were going with this one, or maybe the keg was sitting around a while, but something seems off. Neat flavors, but not what I was looking for int he style."
""
"Overall: A very nice, very drinkable saison."
""
""
"On tap at Final Gravity into tulip glass. Dark golden color with some haze, penny thick creamy white head with medium retention. I think the keg was shaken around a bit, lots of head on initial pour. Aroma gives a tropical fruit smell and the yeast really comes through. Flavor is kinda hot on the back of the tongue. Solid malt flavor and a little sweet, tastes like honey. Mouthfeel is thick, and I like it!"
"An interesting take on the style. A ""brown"" Saison if you will. All- around flavorfull food brew."
"O- A very good saison, one I will definitely want to revisit."
""
"Poured from a 750 ml crown capped bottle into a tulip. Pours a murky dark gold; opaque from the haze. Forms an enormous meringue-like head that continues to expand well after the pour; several inches follows the beer down the glass. Nose is pepper, crackers, apple skin, and a hint of banana. That all comes through in the flavor as well, with a noticeable graininess in the mid-palette, leading to a a very dry finish. A light hop bitterness is present toward the end. Light-bodied and spritzy, but not ""delicate."" An excellent saison; perhaps the best American version I've had."
""
""
"Overall this is one of my favorite American produced saisons. Nothing reaches out and grabs you. But what it does, it does very well. A very well balanced drinkable beer."
""
""
"Not bad, I do get a sulfur character that does not mesh for me. I can see why people would like it, just not for me. Still interesting, and something I would recommend."
""
""
""
"Where this beer remains creamy as most authentic versions would exhibit champagne-like dryness- this is where I struggle to find characterize the beer properly. As well as a stronger conversation between the fruit and spice would also elevate the beer to compete with classic DuPont examples, then these small details could propel this beer to the best of Belgium."

"Mouthfeel/Overall: Mouthfeel is fairly heavy for the style and not the crispest I've had. Not bad though. Overall, I liked this saison pretty well. It's not overly flavorful compared to many of the style, but there's nothing bad about it. I would definitely have this again as it is very easy drinking and pretty refreshing."
"A very nice saison, not super wild about this brewery, but they haven't hit any klunkers either,Very easy to drink"

"A good saison in the dupont style. Not big and bold in the flavor but its good."
""
""
""
"Taste. Nice thick mouth feel with citrus and spice. Beautiful Belgian hops profile. A little earth in the finish and background. This beer is really close to what a saison should be. Really easy to drink. Great fresh taste."
""
"Goldish color...significant lingering head and lace. Aroma of minerals, liquorice, yeast, funk, anise, herbs, spice & fruit. Flavor also has a tongue piecing bitterness. I'm not noticing big hops but there's some there! Minimum malt or sweetness. Rich but some roughness."

"Notes: A nice saison. Touch of funk, plenty of yeast and nice hoppiness. I kept going back and forth from really liking it to kind of liking it. It just couldn't hurdle that bar into really liking it for some reason, but I'd like to try it again some time."

"Overall (4.0): This is a very pleasant saison, and I wish there were more like it. I like saisons that are full-flavored, but not overbearing. Hennepin is great, but it’s like a saison balls-to-the-wall. This is elegant. I like this. Very glad to have tried, and looking forward to grabbing some more (a lot more) Stillwater in the future, when I can."

"Pours a clear honey orange with a foamy white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain, yeast, slight spice, and lots of fruity aromas. Taste is the same with some perfume-like flavors. There is also a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good saison with a nice fruity presence."
""
"D: Most of the right parts are there, but the proportions are all FUBAR. Way too sweet and too herbal. Sort of oddly herbal as well. Not enough peppery / spicy / earthy saison character. Not attenuated and dry enough. Strength without the needed matching robustness and strength of flavor. Still interesting and fair overall."
"O: This is a solid saision. I'm really enjoying it. The flavors are all over the place, but everything works nicely together. If this were available in my area I'd buy a bottle from time to time."
"Besides all the foam in the pour it's a great beer. Bright and fruity, but not a fruit beer."
"A huge Sasion fan, but this felt all over the shop to me. There's some promising elements but they seem to fight each other. Concur with a previous reviewer that there are some ""off"" elements."

"Pours a cloudy honey hue which leaves a creamy three finger head from a gentle pour and lots of lacing everywhere,the smell straight away is pineapple its really strong but i love pineapple so thats cool also some funky barnhouse aromas and a touch of bananna,the mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy with tastes of lemon sherbet,pineapple,mandarins,dragonfruit and the finish being a mix of light citrus and candy and overall its definately an above average Saison and i would definately buy again cheers."

"O - Not my favourite saison but a solid multi-faceted and interesting beer. Worth a try."
"O: not bad at all and definitely a beer I want to revisit again when it's fresh. This bottle was at least 5 months old."
""
"D: Easy drinking brew and definitely easy to have more than one in an afternoon/evening. One of my favorite saisons and recommended to those that like saisons."
""
"Foggy gold with a thin, creamy white head. Floral, sweet, mildly phenolic aroma...grassy lemon, pear, and peppery spice. Tastes sweet and floral; creamy with some grain and light zesty citrus. Belgian yeast nails the Saison profile. Medium-light and drying in the mouth. I'm a satisfied customer. I've heard good things about Stillwater, so I'm glad I finally got around to trying one of their beers. They certainly seem to be able to pull off the style in an authentic way."
"O- Good first beer from Stillwater. If the beer was slightly drier I think it would make this go a little further. Nonetheless, a great beer."
""
""
"Explosive carbonation here with a light body and an uncomfortable lingering feel. Overall this one is a disappointment. My least favorite of the stillwater offering so far. It really doesn't come together and has some off flavors."
""
"The beer pours a clear amber with an initially dense white head. The head falls flat but he beer doesn't. Smelling this beer leaves me unsatisfied, but I'm willing to blame a certain amount on it being served too cold. The taste paints a different picture. There is an incredible sweetness - bitterness interplay, followed by bold yeast character. The beer is paired with some fatty duck fries...excellent mouthfeel. The bitter aftertaste is not characteristic of most saisons, but it's a nice addition. It's worth trying and a great bar drink."
"Will pour (without trying) a five+ finger thick cream head that takes forever to fade, leaving a good lace. Hazy amber color, some yeast left in bottle. Strong carbonation and medium bodied. Light fruit and hay nose, flavor is light sweet citrus, some yeast, ABV is hidden. Decent saison, not sour like a lot of them. (gift) 750ml bottle from Madden Beverage Saco, Me."
"Overall - a solid saison, just enough spice and hops to keep it interesting. Very refreshing and the perfectly easy drinking summer kind of beer."
""
"I’ll have another."

"Bomber from some expensive NY place at $14. A farmhouse ale without the farm, nothing funky at all in the aroma. A tasty ale, overcarbonated but still fairly tasty and drinkable. Some orange citrus, some cola, all within some nondescript saison ingredients. Dark coloured with small white head."
""
""
""
""
""

"Aroma of warm alcohol, herbes du provence, coriander, and clove. A definite malted wheat character is also evident. The flavor brings on fresh grassy hops, earthy notes, and a cracker-y crispness. Extremely dry in the finish, this is a winner in my book. The only real problem that I have is that the phenolic spices fade on the palate. Regardless, I would get this again."
"Poured a golden orange color with a small white cap of head that retained well and left a bit of soapy lacing. Floral aroma, spicy yeast. Taste is a bit mild and subdued, but crisp and flavorful, with notes of spicy yeast, white grapes, citrus zest, and floral hops that keep the bitterness in check; minimal funk. Crisp, light-medium mouthfeel, and very easily drinkable. Nice."
"Based upon this beer I'll buy and try all the other Stillwaters on the shelf. Still waters do run deep. Gypsy brewing seems to be the domaine of the obsessed...thank you."
""
"Some sweetness is quite noticeable at first sip. The yeasty flavors add to the fun, along with some bitterness of the Belgian funky sort. Hops are not really apparent, but there is a nice edge to the maltiness. Another nice feature is the big fruity tanginess-- not too dry, and not too acidic. A touch of orange rind. A great beer that make the Saison such an interesting style."

"A very good saison. Very citrus based as opposed to funky. Smooth with a good feel, this is very enjoyable"
"O - For the pricepoint, there are better and cheaper saison, but I enjoyed his and would have it again."
""
""
"This beer is not only an excellent example of the style but just an all-around excellent beer. Stillwater is knocking it out of the park regularly. So happy I can purchase their beer."
"O - I really enjoyed this beer and will buy another bottle soon. This has been sitting in my beer fridge for a few months and no telling how long it was on the shelf prior to that. Regardless, the beer has held up quite well. Worth a try if you're a fan of Saisons."

"Interesting beer, lots of talking points but also the sweetness lends this a drinkability that the yeast mars at times."

"O: tasty beer that didn't hold up to one year of cellaring. somewhat of a disappointment on that front as the fresher version's hops balance the malt much more. i'm a fan and will still seek out, but only when fresh. nice aromas don't match the taste anymore."
"Overall, a well crafted saison with moderate but well done flavors. Slightly more carbonated than I would like. Well made beer, would have again."
"Pours a cloudy golden orange with nice cap of frothy white head, decent retention and lacing. Scent is of hay and dried grain, kiss of citrus, splash of peppery spice, some fresh bread, light watery fruit and a hint o earthy funk. Taste follows scent, milder than anticipated but still blended very well. Medium bodied, dry finish. A good saison which doesn't wow the palate, but is solid in all areas."
"A pretty interesting saison from Stillwater, and an interesting introduction to the brewery. It has loads of character, and some interesting twists, but manages to keep it all well within the realms of the saison style. That's a hard ask any time, and to do it with such class is quite a skill."
"Lovely appearance, though it seems to have some rather large carbonation bubbles (maybe it was the glass). Aroma is mild, just a little underwhelming. Taste is excellent. Good spiciness and saison rusticity. Nice peppery quality and almost a bit of funkiness. Mouthfeel is fine. Well worth a second or third drink."
"O: A very enjoyable beer. I wouldn't call it a true saison, but it has all the right elements of one. I recommend it."
"Overall: Decent enough saison, nothing memorable."
"Taste - Moderatley sweet with a nice hoppy bitterness, much hoppier than I would expect from a Saison, but I guess that is what makes it ""Stateside."" The brett is noticeable, but definitely in the background."
"For me this was a saison with a twist; one could argue it was part way to an American Strong Ale, so frankly seems like a bit of a hybrid. Definitely worth a try - recommended!"
"O: Very much a saison, but really like they married an IPA with it. I can enjoy that, you'll barely get anything traditional, but if you're a fan of the hops you'll like this"
"O: Unfortunately I'm not a fan of funky beers so I couldn't rate it too highly here. I tried to be at least somewhat objective with my other ratings but this was over the top and I poured out most of it."
"This had many good qualities about it from the appearance to feel, but the actual flavors seemed too one dimensional for me. Though, for the style it's plenty good and one I would recommend to try if you get the opportunity."
"Drinkability: Medium to high, depending on your hop tolerances and preferences."
"D: A solid and easily drinkable saison. Certainly not top-tier though."
"I like stories."
"Drinked at Brian Stillwater Conference @ Delirium Village"
"O: 4.5"
"Another good Saison from Stillwater here. This brew poured out as a hazy yellow color with a good foamy head on top. The head settles and leaves some scattered lacing on the glass. The smell of the beer was floral and grainy. The taste was nicely balanced between some grainy malts and some smooth farhouse funk. Really an interesting brew. The mouthfeel was bubbly but smooth, overall very good stuff."
"Overall, this is another good offering from Stillwater, but I feel like the price is still higher than it should be ($10.95)."
"O- overall a very solid saison from the crew at stillwater."
"O: Just not as excited about this one. I've had it a few times before, and while it is a pretty good example of the style, I'm just too stuck on Fantome."
"O: Not the most in-your-face saison I've ever had, which, depending on your viewpoint, is either a good thing or a disappointment. I find that this beer is very drinkable and really tasty. With an intense spiciness, taste of alcohol and elements of Belgian beers, this is a really drinkable beer."
"D- quite drinkable. A solid beer but it could be a bit more intense. Worth checking out."
"Overall, a nice saison with good balance. It never reaches the height of some of the best of the style, but it is nice nonetheless."
"O: Excellent example of a saison and hides the 6.8% very well. Slight alcohol"
"Great saison. I'm really looking forward to seeing this here on the regular!"
"Mouthfeel: it's a medium to full body beer with decent carbonation.  It's crisp and drinkable. "
"Stillwater has been very American in its approach to this classic Belgian style. With a big body and an even bigger hop presence, Stateside isn't the most refreshing or stylistically stringent saison out there, but it's a tasty new addition to an Arizona market that’s always ready for newcomers."
"Overall: Tasty saison; the meadow grass and very light, delicate malt notes are quite nice. The really clean hop bitterness makes this refreshing, even though the somewhat full mouthfeel counters the refreshing aspects of the beer. One of the better fully 'American-style' takes on the style, but still lacking the vibrant fruit/earth/funk that I love so much about the best Belgian and Belgian-style examples."
"I am the pickest critic when it comes to the styles that I love most. Saison is the style that I love most above all other styles. So, yes, I might be scoring Stateside Saison by too strict a measure. I can;t help but feel, though, that this should be labeled a Biere de Garde. The two styles are close cousins, obviously. They are both farmhouse ales, and the styles developed in extremely close proximity to each other. This beer just happens to taste like the farmhouse ales of France more than those of Wallonia, Belgium. This is a tasty beer, just not a great example of the Saison style."
"jd"
"Very solid, worth the price? Not sure. I'll definitely try a few more from them."
"Mouthfeel is slightly dry with lively, bubbly, and light mouthfeel. Overall, I'm really enjoying this saison with a stronger musty yeast character than many but it doesn't quite stand out against the best of them."
"(750ml bottle from Total Wine Desert Ridge). Pours a cloudy yellow-orange color with piloow-top white head. Active carbonation. Aroma has lemon, spices, pepper and wheat. Taste is malty sweet, emphasis on malt, with some bittness. I’m not digging the maltiness at all. Medium bodied with oily texture. Slightly bitter finish. Not bad, but too malt forward for my tastes."
"Overall: While this was a good beer, it's not my favorite of this style. Would certainly drink again, but won't become a staple."
"Overall is good. This isn't my first bottle I've had of this beer and I could certainly see buying it again."
"Glad I picked up this beer. Will seek out again."
"Pours a clear, gold color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells of fresh malt, hint of hops, and slight yeast. Fits the style of a Saison / Farmhouse Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, slight pale malt, hops, and slight yeast. Overall, not complex, decent appearance and aroma."
"Onto the taste: At first you get the sweet fruity flavors. Lemons, citrus, and apricot with a mix of the hop for a little bittering effect. The finish is more spicy and peppery with a touch of the hops lingering through out. Quite complex and QUITE tasty Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Just overall a truly fantastic beer. Would def. purchase again."
"O- Lots of pear and buttery flavors that dominate this beer. The fruity esters and saison yeast blend well together but they are not strong enough for the diacetyl that takes over. As the beer warms there is a nice pear and cottage cheese flavor underneath with the yeast and fruit."
"O – A great, herbal, spritzy saison."
"Beer is an attractive hazy gold with a nice ivory head. Medium aroma of yeast and grapefruit. Taste is very good. Some malt, nice and yeasty, with a pleasantly bitter and somewhat dry finish. It's very well balanced. Mouthfeel is excellent. It's a very drinkable beer. An excellent saison. Definitely one to have again."
"The CPJ"
"O: This is a well made, easy to drink beer. Extremely drinkable."
"If we ever get some warm weather up here, it would be a perfect beer for a summer day."
"This was a corrective saison: I split a large bottle with my wife after hacking through a Sam Adams saison earlier in the day. I'd give this an A if not for two things: the soda-poppy carbonation, which adds a needle-pointy edge to everything; and the over-hopping, which adds an acidy feel that belongs in an IPA, not in a saison. I like my saisons with fewer abrasives and a bit more of that pillowy, yeasty taste. If you like to belch, however, this beer will give you championship results."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this saison. Wonderfully complex and drinkable. A perfect complement to a warm afternoon. And some pretty cool label artwork as well."
"enjoyable even if not and everyday beer."
"Very nise saison that would be a great intro. saison for a new comer to better beer. Then they could work there way to the drier saisons."
"Enjoyed on tap at Blue Monk in Buffalo. Poured what appeared to be a hazy light orange color. It was a little difficult to see in the light from the bar. It had a nice efferescent white head that lasted a good while. The aroma was grainy, yeasty, slightly citrusy. The flavor was a nice balance of yeast character, grainy malt backbone, enough hop bitterness to balance, some lemon and grapefruit citrus, light spiciness, and a wonderful tart dry finish. Light to medium body with lots of carbonation. Enjoyable throughtout with nice changes as the temperature warmed the beer. Would definitely recommend to have as soon as possible and often as possible."
"Shows promise, but for now, entering the dustbin of mediocre American-made saisons. Sad, because the bottle alone makes me want to fall in love."
"Poured into my dfh snifter- pours a dark golden color, with some frothy foam, but not too much- it quickly recedes and leaves little cover on the beer. Appearance is overall average. Smell- lemon, wheat, the wheat is overpowering and a little off putting. Taste- sweet, bready, but something that I love about Saisons is really missing here. I love the cracked pepper and coriander flavors, I dont see any of that here. I tried the Stillwater Cellar Door Saison a few days ago, and find it much superior to this one."
"O - I'm struggling with this because a) it's way too carbonated and filling and b) it's overly yeasty. A solid attempt but it makes me weary of dropping the coin on their other offerings. Too earthy."
"Overall this beer is good and fairly well crafted but falls flat of many examples I have tried that posses much more rustic character, more fruity yeast notes and much higher carbonation."
"D-This beer made my night. Very nicely balanced flavor and a pleasant aroma along with a very nice mouth feel. I see that there are some dry hopped varieties of this beer, I suspect that dry hopping would round out the aroma and make this even better than it already is. I really look forward to a warm summer afternoon with a bottle of this, I think that this would make an excellent refreshing summer beer."
"O- A nice Saison and easy to drink. I feel that I would not want to drink this too often but would like to keep a bottle or two laying around for when I am feeling this."
"Very drinkable, nice rendition of a saison."
"drinkability: good"
"Verdict: too expensive to be a great beer, but very good none the less. Won't cure your hankering for a Saison/Farmhouse though..."
"A very drinkable and enjoyable Saison from Stillwater."
"Overall- My first offering from Stillwater Artisanal, had to pick this up after reading the article about Strumke in the BA Mag. This is almost IPA meets Saison and after further rereading the article, that seems to be the aim of this one; so nice job to me for identifying that, and a great job to the brewer for spot-on execution. So far so good, I will be keeping an eye out for more from Stillwater."
"The palate is rather unique. Surprisingly juicy from the hops, there's a little grape-like character present (from the Nelson Sauvin, I guess?), as well as a bitterness that's mildly grapefruit-like. The malt character isn't as raw as the nose suggested, and it _is_ whelmed by the hops and the yeast here. Like any good saison, this is quite spicy and moderately phenolic. In fact, the first few sips have a sharpness to them that I can't really describe better. Drying on the finish with hop flavor (grapes, sweetlimes), spicy (white pepper, a little nutmeg-like bitterness) and crisp with plenty of carbonation, this is an enjoyable and refreshing beverage. Very well done, Brian!"
"22oz. bottle served in a Blvd. Tank 7 tulip. Bottle conditioned. Poured a hazy gold with a thin white head. Citrus and melon in the aroma. Low carbonation, light bodied. Some grainy malt. A little spice and fruit from yeast. I wish this had been a little more crisp and dry. It was a little flabby for me."
"D: Very drinkable. Very good representation of the style in my opinion. Complex, but not overly dominated by one aspect."
"Poured out of a bottle with no head. Clean smell, like a proper saison. After first sip it tastes like a great example of what I like in this style. I taste a little bit of spice, not sure if there is any or if it's just the yeast. Straw color with a little amber and hazy. This is a very good no nonsense saison."
"D - This is a really tasty saison. I'm glad Stillwater finally made it to Missouri."
"If only this were drier it would be a great Saison. For me it checks all the other boxes. More pepper would be nice too, but this is not that variety of Saison."
"D: This is a very interesting saison but needs to be sipped slowly given its intense flavors and the combination of bitterness and dryness."
"So, with that kind of head, you know to expect carbonation - and good lord is it carbonated. It's kind of out of control - which makes it memorable - but that wheaty, fresh taste might suffer. I recommend this to try once, but not a huge fan overall."
"M - Highly carbonated, lighter bodied."
"Stillwater is an ironic name for a brewery that is creating so many ripples in the craft-beer pond. The mind behind this outfit is clearly a visionary and, fortunately, one with the proper appreciation and understanding of classic styles to possess the necessary tact when putting his own personal spin on them. Stateside Saison is exactly what it says it is: an homage to old world tradition and a celebration of new world innovation."
"Good spiky mouthfeel. Here's my Stillwater winner, so far."
"Drinkability gets to be solid but mostly cause this saison out of the cask comes as a cross between and American IPA and a weak Belgian saison minus the things about saisons I don't care for. This beer out of the cask is NOT a typical saison at all so keep that in mind if you are a fan of that style."
"Drinkability - A quaffable saison for sure, however, as previously mentioned, this is just a hint too sweet and for the price, I would pick up a JP saison instead. I will say there is no alcohol in the flavor, though I do get a hint of warming in the throat from each sip. If a JP saison was not available, I do think I would pick this second from the others I have tried."
"Lighter medium body, higher carbonation, a little dry. Drinks well, light alcohol, and a decent balance between funk and spice. Overall not super impressive but a solid saison."
"This is a solid Saison with a good balance of all reviewing categories. Very drinkable and tasty."
"D: Compared to the Les Bons Voeux of a couple of weeks ago, this brew is simply very good, but it still has a lot to suggest it including components of malty sweetness, citrus-herbal hoppiness, and yeasty farmhouse funk that still packs a good punch of saisony goodness."
"Poured a capped and foiled 750ml into my Dogfish Head globe glass. This beer pours a hazy golden honey with yeast particulates floating around in the glass. The head retention is spectacular. A massive 4 finger head erupted from the bottle and 2 inches of creamy white head are always perched on top of the liquid. The aroma is musty funky up front, almost like a closet full of clothes that hasn't seen daylight in a year. Behind the funk is just a hint of floral and herbal hops. Just a little bit of damp grass. Also at the tail end of the aroma is under ripe tree fruits. Hard pears and apples. The flavor is funky. Damp, musty earth intermingled with hard pears and dried hay. Tasty stuff but the depth of the flavor profile of a great saison just isn't there. Regardless, its tasty stuff. The mouthfeel is dry, but not cat tongue dry. I've had the pleasure of drinking this beer on several occasions. I've even brought it to 2 or 3 tastings and its a great saison. I wish Stillwater distributed to Missouri."
"750 ml bottle. Served in a tulip glass, the beer pours a cloudy golden/orange color with a couple inch frothy off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both very good. Aroma is lemon peel, bready/grainy malt, peppery spice, and a bit of clove and grassy hops. I pick up a strong herbal flavor in this brew, along with some lemon peel, peppery spice, grain/bready malt, bananas, and some grassy hops. Very tasty brew. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's dry and well carbonated. The soft carbonation makes this easy to drink, and quite refreshing. I think this is a good overall brew, I'd definitely buy this again."
"Drink: Grab one, very nice saison."
"D-this really is a fantastic beer. recently at a beer event in nyc i sampled some stillwater for the first time and was blown away. in a day of drinking dozens of different beers, the stillwater brew cut through as a clear highlight. stateside saison is a winner and a beer i will be looking for again and again."
"3.5 D: Good beer, but drinkability suffers from the vegetal component. While the herbal flavor is good for a few ounces, it gets old before the second glass. Still, the malts contribute tasty and aggressive flavors. Worth a try."
"A good saison, but I'm perplexed by its spot on the best in style list - there are far better ones out there."
"burnt gold with a big white head that holds and leaves lots of lace. nose is traditional saison with hints of American-style hops popping up. flowers, fruit, spice (pepper), euro malty sweetness and a bit of country barn all ring out in balance. very impressive. medium body with lively carbonation makes for a nice, prickly, cleansing mouthfeel that goes down way too easy. one of my favorite saisons to date and definitely my favorite American made saison. avant guarde traditional? yum. finally, a breath of fresh air!!"
"A bit of floral hoppiness detected and tartness on the finish. If this was offered in 12oz bottles it'd be an everyday saison for me. 750ml only as far as I know."
"Bottle: Poured a bright light orangey color ale with a large pure white foamy head with good retention and great lacing. Aroma consists of fruity ester with dry floral notes form the hops with some light funky yeast notes also discernable. Taste is also a nice mix between some funky notes with floral hops and dry aftertaste. I thought the malt bill was great if maybe a tad too sweet for my own taste. Body was full for style with great carbonation and no signs of alcohol. Very well brewed and something I would seek again fro sure."
"A very tasty beer, but way too funky to be a session beer. A bold beer for those with an adventurous palate, but just not my cup of tea. I'm glad that I tried this, but I won't seek it out again."
"Big huge pour with a ton of bubbles and a massive frothy head. Big sweet yeasty notes on the nose, a ton of spice and banana. Taste was a typical saison, very earthy, but with a ton of carbonation that carries through to the finish. Very drinkable once it settles, as well as complex, picking up some funkiness on the end. Very good, glad i grabbed this from the bottom of the fridge."
"The body was just a little livelier than average. Drinkability was very good, I would certainly have this again. Overall, a slightly better than average example of the style, worth trying if you see it and is probably worth asking for in a trade."
"Cheers!"
"Pours murky gold with two finger head, above average sized bubbles, some lacing. Smells like some basement, bit of lemon, faint grassy aroma and a hint of spice and banana. Tastes like an over yeasty saison. Too much spice and banana, but some good notes, grassyness and a faint flavor of basement. Too many malt flavors for me, needs to be more simple. Nice effervecent mouthfeel. However a little tough to drink and slightly cloying. Overall I think this beer tastes a bit too much like a golden ale, too many esters."
"Nice mouthfeel and drinkability."
"Zesty and hoppy, with a singular flavor profile, the dryness and bitter fruity notes really distinguish this ale from its peers..."
"Even a gentle pour is going to get you between three and four finger's worth of light, airy bone white head, the delineation of the bubbles is such that you watch each one pop as the foam disappears, zip for lacing. Fully clear orange rust to zinc color, pales to a yellow tinge around the rims, there's a wealth of bubbles but no beads at all, more like softly falling snow. But going up. Silky smooth nostril presence, fits like a $1,000 suit, which in some ways may not be for the best, as it makes it harder to grab the scents and identify them. In any event, there's suave orange, tangerine, lemon citrus spray, a biscuit and scone breadiness, well blended banana, pineapple, peach, nectarine, yellow apple, cherry fruit scents, no clearly dominant force, no real chocolate but the coriander, cumin spice sweet enough to cover, clean with nary a trace of funk. In the mouth it's medium-bodied and the carbonation foams up quickly, certainly contributes to additional perfume, yet forestalls your ability to really get into the flavors. That said, über-friendly orange, lemon, pink grapefruit citrus as well as apple, pear, peach, apricot, cantaloupe fruit. Anise, mint, chamomile more prevalent here. The yeasty notes soften as well as add cling factor. If you can acclimate to the level of carbonation you'll find that it is a fairly dry beer with good outline and length. Ambitious beer."
"This is a very enjoyable saison style beer, light in body, yet packed with flavor. When I let my first pour with the huge head settle down, the brew became kind of flat. But that served to highlight the wine-like, acidic quality of the beer. Next time, the beer was colder and I managed a better pour. In that pour, the flavors were much better integrated. Nevertheless, I think it is the citrus/wine acidity that makes this an especially different saison. Food pairers be on the the lookout, this will go with lots of good, spicy foods. Honestly, this could go with any dish that white wine (sauvignon blanc, chardonnay) goes with, and in my opinion, better."
"Pours a bright golden color with a nice white head and hints of orange coloring. Pretty good lacing as it makes its way down. The nose is a bit light, but brings through some hay, orange, lemon, grain, and some light stone fruits. Hints of earth. The taste is similar, with some well integrated flavors. At the same time, there's nothing too deep and most of the flavors are fairly subdued, failing to produce many of the hard-hitting flavors I really look for in a saison. Feel is a bit dry and well carbonated. Overall, this drinks quite well and I'm excited to see what else this new brewery produces."
"D: This was a wonderful american Saison. Honestly, the only reason it didn't score any higher was its' relative lack of rustic funkiness. Other than that (which isn't even a flaw for crying out loud!) I loved this beer!"
"3.5/4/4.5/4/4"
"Overall very drinkable, a distinct American Saison."
"Nicely drinkable. Beautiful balance between complexity and just sheer beautiful taste. Very well crafted beer, can't wait to try more from Stillwater."
"pour is clear and yellow orange with a large head of very thick head at first that seems to be less and less assertive as the bottle gets pour. not as it sit for a quarter of an hour but it seems the carbonation is rich but gone fast. nose not as farmhouse funk and hop fused as others but the hop character is predominant and brisk floral. grassy lemon zest, and a tad herbal but nothing that could be pin pointed. rosemary, thyme or sorts. hearty earthy meat herbs and floral palate. tight on the tongue and cleansing to the point that you want to accommidate the dryness in the mouth. a bit harder on the gums than i would like for the style but still a step above and american. a good example but i lacks the musk i enjoy. or more so does not have the amount i would expect. the herbal quality seems to be broader in that. this is just a soapy interpretation. i like saisons and you should try this only if you are in search of that american fashion of it. that is if jolly pumpkin isn't enough."
"A very good American saison. Stateside is a light orange beer with big frothy white head. It has a very professional, tattoo art-inspired label. The aroma is fruity with some funk and spice. I smell peppercorns, grapes, lemons, sweet melon and fresh grain. The funk is light, though definitely present. It tastes light to medium dry with good bitterness and funk. The flavor is a bit rounder than the aroma, but it could stand to be drier. I'm having a good time drinking this beer. It's refreshing and full-flavored. The hop choice is interesting without getting in the way of the style. This was a happy surprise."
"Slightly hazy amber color with a huge white head that had very good retention. Plenty of lacing is left on the glass. Looks fantastic. Aroma is herbal, woodsy, with a little musty note in the background. The taste was a little bit of a letdown. Heavy phenolic with an almost overwhelming herbal quality. Hay and pepper as well. Dry malt charactor. Bitterness is balanced. Medium body with a soft carbonation that goes well with this beer. Not the flavor profile that really appealed to me. It would probably be a good pairing beer for those so inclined."
"Overall, a nice drinking saison. A good representation of the style. Good drinkability as well."
"Picked up a bottle at Abe's Cold Beer and split it with a couple friends. This amber ale has a tall white head and a very spicy character. I'm reminded of Coronado's Hoppy Daze Belgian IPA for the big citrus hops mixed with coriander. While the hops rule along with the the Belgian spice character, there are also subtler, earthy notes. And while this is delicious, I think it's distinctly American."
"Drinkability is pretty good. Certainly thirst quenching. While I hesitate to fault them for the dry minerality that most fail to achieve when then attempt the style, this starts out to such an extreme that it dampens the taste until I pour some yeast in with the second half of the bottle. I recommend to serve it 'mit hefe' by rolling the bottle gently on the table before opening."
"Drinkability is good. This is a fairly refreshing saison with the generous hop addition. Definitely a well crafted brew, but it doesn't quite have the complexity that it's Belgian counterparts contain. However, for a new brewery to kick off with a beer like this is fairly impressive. I'm excited to try a few more of their offerings. Worth checking out."
"Overall a solid offering and one of the nicer American-style Saisons I've had. Glad to try this one."
"Price = $7.00"
"Poured into a glass stein, this has a pleasing, cloudy yellow-gold color with a thick head that settled to 2.5"". Aromas of sour green apples, lemon, grains and yeast. This has nice yeasty flavors that combine with citrus and faint herbs. The bitterness and abundant carbonation provide a nice mouthfeel. This is a very refreshing saison."
"The beer pours a yellow color with a white head. The aroma is yeast with some spices and citrus fruit. The flavor is a mix of orange and lemon with some Belgian yeast and assorted spices. A nice drinkable saison. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D-great saison, everything you want to see, strong yeast presence, nice bit of hop balance with a solid spicy herbal showing accompanied by a nice peppery spice in the back. the doughy forefront and citrus afterplay give it the balance and complexity you want to see."
"D - Delicious brew, definitely ISO more (hint, hint Adam...)"
"Drinkability: I was looking for a saison and this one definitely satisfied me, Tasty and easy to consume."
"D: Overall, a very solid beer. I really liked this one quite a bit and wouldn't mind having this one again."
"F: Mostly dry finish, slight lingering creamy malt though. Some spices still there, with a touch of toasted malts lingering. Slight sticky feel as well as the sugars disappear. Slight bitterness, perhaps from hops or just the spices added to it. Almost a slight wheat lingering too, with some Belgian golden malt flavors lingering. Again saison like but not really farmhouse."
"D - I could drink this all night. Slightly heavier beer with an interesting nose/taste."
"Overall a very solid Saison. Stacked up next to the guava grove earlier in the day it certainly held its own."
"Pours a slightly hazy but very bright golden orange with a slight bubbly head that leaves small splatches of lace hanging off the glass. The smell is nice and refreshing full of lemon zest, slight amount of funk, earthy tones and citrus sweetness. This tastes very nice, simple not as much complexity as it smelled but still great. Lemons and funk come through with a nice yeasty zest to brign it all together. So easy to drink, light on the tongue and perfect for a summer day. I could drink this all day and would if given the chance."
"p.s. in looking back now over the last four reviews - one month's time - every beer was purchased at Capone's, incl mine. That's just straight silly."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, crisp, refreshing, and dry."
"As it warms, more and more barnyard musk seeps in, which makes for an interesting, if not particularly ground-breaking, brew."
"Drinkability: Is good if you enjoy saisons and like a bit different interpretation of one. Without knowing for sure, since I didn't have them side by side, I feel like the tap version had a better taste than bottled."
"Poured at a recent BA tasting event. Pours a cloudy lighter yellow with a nice bubbly head. Nose is citrus and funk. Taste is apples mango, barnyard funk, leather, and pink grapefruit. Pretty complex and well flavored. A tiny pinch of sourness and has a pleasant grassy aftertaste that lingers a bit."
"d - A decent saison but nothing special. I thought it had a nice smell to it, but not much to the taste or mouthfeel. Not bad at all and very drinkable, but nothing special and I wouldn't look to try again."
"Amber/golden color with a huge head that seems to go on and on and on. I was concerned it might be infected at first. Moderate spicy and earthy aroma. Mildly copper/mettalic like. Very solid malty flavor with enough spiciness to be quite noticeable. Some caramel sweetness though the whole thing. Phenolic and peppery notes. Velvety smooth creaminess considering the spicy bite-quite a solid mouthfeel to it. Just a great US saison. Lives up the the hype I have read about this beer."
"D- This is an awesome local saison. Much like a hoppy belgian, amber ale. There could be more funk present to make this better for the style-but the beer as is is really good. Saison is one of my favorite styles-I've had the good, the bad, and the ugly... this is a VERY good brew...though a bit of a different example of the style."
"All around a solid as far as this beer goes. The beer pours honeyish gold with a thick white head that evaporates fairly quickly. Smell is kind of like freshly cut bales of hay. Taste is somewhat sweet followed by a bitter taste with a flavor not unlike chamomile but stronger. The mouthfeel is pretty smooth with a bit of an alcohol burn in the finish. The beer goes down easy enough that going back for a second won't be hard to fathom at all. Another example of a good maryland brew"
"Tried this one at the recent City Paper Brew Fest in Baltimore. It was one of my favorites of the day. I believe this is one of the first Saison's I've tried. Beautiful orange in color, woody and spice in smell and taste. Highly recommended. Will definitely seek this out and other offerings from this brewery."
"This is a nice Saison; it certainly will be enjoyable to those that like all Saisons including American interpretations. Having said that, for some reason I was expecting something with a paler malt character and a little more hop aggressive; I really like Nelson Sauvin hops and was hoping this had this hop featured as a signature note. Instead the hops, while substantial, play on an equal footing with the yeast character and to a lesser degree the malt (which does actually become quite a bit more noticeable and complex as this warms). It is a bit weird that I feel a touch disappointed from this fantastically tasty brew, due to my preconceived notions on how I would have brewed this particular beer (meaning a Saison with Nelson Sauvin hops). In the end this is very enjoyable and I am quite happy to be polishing off a 750ml bottle of this."
"D - Pretty decent farmhouse style ale, although I found it to be a bit heavy on the earthy notes. Still, this was pretty drinkable overall, though not one of my favorite saisons in the grand scheme of things."
"Overall this was perhaps that best Saison that I have had (but I am by no means an expert on the style) and the complexity was off the charts. Well done Stillwater. Highly Recommended."
"D: Very drinkable with a relatively low abv price tag. A serious saison (especially when you consider that it is Stillwater's first release) that I want to have more of."
"After dinner I decided to try one of these. Shortly thereafter, I found out that the brewer was there and a Stillwater Event was taking place. I had a chance to chat with him briefly. It turns out that this is his brewery's very first product - how awesome is that! I wish them continued success and I hope all of their offerings are as good as this one! PROST!!!!"
"Feel is lighter than medium with light carb, light pricks, smooth as silk. I will drink this again."
"Beer is medium bodied and tastes really nice. There is a mild bitterness and the beer finishes cleanly. I enjoyed all three incarnations of this beer but the oak chip aged was slightly better IMO. I hope to get more of this beer."
"Notes: Great firs-offering from Stillwater. Welcome! I sure look forward to see the name hold itself, and have a chance to provide other brews in the future. Nice quality offering and addition to the beer landscape."
"D: All said, a very nice effort from Stillwater... impressive for a first release and one I hope to be able to enjoy for some time to come."
