"Halia is a damn fine beer. It's juicy, bright, and approachable to the point I can't see anyone disliking it whether into beer or not. Drinkability is absurdly high while there's enough tartness to make it totally refreshing. Recommended."
""
""
""
"More sour on the nose.  Butter and a bit of tart taste profile, minimal peach, very drinkable."

" Overall:  Outstanding brew. The big sour funk punch works seamlessly with the white wine and peach notes to make one hell of tasty American sour. The dry finish really sells this guy by leaving the fruit and wine notes buzzing on the tongue! Letting you really enjoy the complex flavors of this beer after every sip!"

"765 ml bottle, 2013 Vintage, stamp on label says bottled on 0733, 12AUG13.  Served in a Prairie Teku glass, the beer pours a hazy gold color with about an inch white head that fizzled away quickly.  However, there's a lot of lacing.  The brew smells like lemon peel, peaches, white wine, oak, and some funk.  I think the taste is just like the aroma, but there's the addition of some green grapes/grape skin.  It's also nice and tart.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's refreshing, a bit coating, and has a good amount of carbonation.  I liked this a lot, but it's pricey at $20.99 a bottle.  Definitely worth trying!"

"O-  5.0 The nice white wine character in the aroma is delicate with great brett character blending in and strong support from the fruity saison yeast and peach notes.  This is a delicious beer that didn't last long on a cool summer evening."
"Overall (4.25): Hell of a beer. The price is a little prohibitive, unfortunately, but forgetting that, itâ€™s a great example of why sours are still the future of craft beer. Any wine lover should be able to appreciate this beer, in addition to the beer geeks already in the know, and it feels like a crowd pleaser for anyone with a discriminating palate (and plenty of folks less interested in such things, too). My only gripes are that the mouthfeel could be smoother, the oak could be more understated, and the fruit could pop a little more. But the sour dynamics are spot-on, it drinks like a champ, and is as refreshing as a cold shower in the tropics. Love it."

"(O)- A great wine barrel aged fruit beer if there ever was one. Just a touch of funk and tartness to make this stand out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. Very drinkable and high quality, but I have a problem with the price tag and the false advertisement of peaches. A little less white wine and at least a discernible level of peaches would benefit it. I would definitely drink it again but I wont be looking to dole out the chedda for it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall. It's a good fruited saison but doesn't hold a candle to the PnB I've been spoiled with lately."
""
""
""
""

""

""

"Vey nice sour. Not too much of the peach flavor came though in the taste more in the nose with nice waft of sweetness. Hazy complexion with good head retention. Nice smooth sour flavor (if those 2 adjectives go together). Nice drinkable sour. Possibly good introduction to sours."
""
""
"Overall: The peaches play nicely in the background of this slightly funky/sour/white wine influenced beer. Well balanced and quite drinkable, this is a tasty, well crafted farmhouse ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours clear straw yellow with nice initial head that dissipates a little quicker that I would've liked to see. The smell is big. Bretty barny funk is nice, hints of wood also that then gives way to fruity peachy notes. Taste is sour peach and cherry, fresh cut wood, and a little bit of wild yeast/Brett. Mouthfeel is right for the style. Dry, good amount of carbonation. Overall I enjoyed this beer, but it's not my favorite of the goose island ""sisters," I prefer the Lolita if I'm looking for a wild/sour offering in this price range."

"Mouthfeel - Looking at the beer, I suspected a thinner feel, but it left a rich coating that allowed me to wait before taking another sip. It hung around, and I like that. I didn't want that flavor to go away."
"easily one of goose islands best, halia is a wild belgian saison type aged in wine barrels with peaches. im guessing chardonnay barrels here, the acid is right on for that, as is the body infused into an otherwise rather light wheat based brew. great color, hazy burnt yellow color, shining bright brass when i hold it west towards a setting sun, crowned by just less than an inch of frosty white lace. the nose is peachy, awesomely so. a million peach beers taste fake or no fruit at all, this is right on, juicy and ripe, and the effervescent carbonation tickles my nose, a welcomed addition and improvement over some others in this series, wine tannins are there, white for sure, and the saison yeast and brett complex is remarkably more tart than anticipated. the flavor too has a great tartness to it, low on acid, but high in pucker. the peaches stay strong from the nose to the flavor too, especially in the finish when their sweetness and softness is front and center. wine barrel character is enormous, sharp but also mellow from the oak, a nice dichotomy of textures. finally, the proportionality of it all is what impresses me the most. not too much peach, not too little. dead on between wild ale yeast and saison or belgian yeast. not too much barrel, but certainly prominent time in them. a great balanced and interesting beer, that seems perfect for the first real warm night of the season. maybe overpriced, but i like this a whole lot, and appreciate the extra 15ml in these bottles, that last sip really is sweet!"

"O: I found this to be saison that is easy to drink and has lots of interesting complexities, neither of which are too strong."
""
""
"Good beer even though I was expecting more peaches. In my mind I was singing: I am going to the country and eat a lot of peaches..."
"Luckily for my poor ass, VDubb's brother was willing to share this bottle with us. Good man. It pours a partly-hazy gold topped by over a finger of lightly cream-white foam. The nose comprises white grape must, mildly-funky citrus, cracked wheat, light Belgian yeast, and a touch of black pepper deep in the background. The taste basically mirrors the smell, though with more funk, mostly growing on some faded fruit that they tell me is a ""peach"". Sure, whatever you say, he says, nodding condescendingly. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, there isn't enough flavor (especially in the peach department) here to warrant the price tag. In the end, it comes across as a week, lightly Brett-ed, lightly fruited saison. Not a bad beer, but a thoroughly disappointing one."
""
""
""
""
"Tastes refreshing but is quite tart, and the flavors pick up on the farmhouse funk from the nose, but in a sour fashion with white wine grape and lemon being the fruit presence. Old leather antiques, but this is not harsh. It is well- rounded in its own right. Crisp, medium bodied and with a bite at the end that juggles sour with sharper perfume. Interesting. I love farmhouse ales/ saisons. While I'm not sure why it was about $20.00 for this bottle (very limited?), it is quite good."
"The $ is a little too steep for a regular purchase and while this is a good, im not sure it warrants the $27 I laid down for it... might be worth picking up a bottle to age though...."
""
"the beer makes me think about having sex in a peach orchard. it is wonderful. each sip makes me go ""whoa"". it is a wonderfully balanced sour with bright peachy notes. it is exquisite. I hope they do it next year so I can put a vertical together."
""
""
"I bought this bottle several months ago and put it aside until springtime. I am definitely digging this beer from Goose Island. It's not a sour bomb at all, Instead, it is quite gentle and agreeable. The flavor is a bit on the light side and I feel it could use more fruit (especially peaches), but nonetheless an excellent offering. Unfortunately, the price makes it unlikely I shall revisit this one."
""
""
""
" The flavor is excellent a lot of tangy tropical fruit flavor with light peachy taste and mellow white wine aspect adding to the slight sourness of wild yeast with some nice citrus elements and a very tasty wine barrel element adding to the complexity - a very nice blend of peach with the sour ale flavor and only a hint of alcohol in the finish with the tangy lemony aspect lingering. Overall I consider this delicious and drinkable with enough sourness without becoming to acidic to drink more than 1 glass."

"765 ml bottle into tulip, bottled on 8/12/2013. Pours moderately hazy bright golden amber color with a 2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big tart peach, pineapple, lemon, pear, apple, white wine, clove, pepper, hay, straw, grass, musty funk, wheat, cracker, bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of peach, yeast, brett, and moderate malt notes; with great strength. Taste of tart peach, pineapple, lemon, pear, apple, white wine, clove, pepper, hay, straw, grass, musty funk, wheat, cracker, bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy tartness/spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart peach, pineapple, lemon, pear, apple, white wine, clove, pepper, hay, straw, grass, musty funk, wheat, cracker, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity of tart peach, yeast, brett, and moderate malt flavors; with a great fruity/spicy yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome brett fruited saison. All around great complexity and balance of peach, yeast, brett, and moderate malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Pours a clear yellow with a foamy white head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is slightly sour with malt, peach, funk, and wood aromas. Taste is much the same with slightly sour peach, funk, and wood flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and dry mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink, but I am not getting any barrel aged characteristics other than wood."
"Overall, good. The nose is the standout and had me expecting a truly first rate beer. Instead, it is just a very good beer. Still quite happy to drink it - but it is not worth the high price tag."

"Poured from a 765mL(?!) bottle, into Belgian tulip glass."
""
""
"Pours hazy yellow gold with coarse, rapidly settling head. Thin lacing. Aroma is tart, lactic, quite funky, oaky, barnyard. Flavor is acidic, mildly tart, fruity, peach, apricot, with a buttery, oak finish. Citrus, fruity, moderate oak aftertaste. Vinous and mildly herbal. Soft to moderate carbonation, light body. An oaky, buttery, moderately vinous sour. Quite good."

"This beer is definitely my favorite so far of the Goose Island sisters series. A wonderful beer that hides it 7.5% and is super drinkable. The combination of tartness, light bread malt, Brett, gentle peach, and huge carbonation is beautiful. A great refreshing beer by itself, can't compliment this beer more."
"D: Really enjoyed drinking this one. Starts out strong and only gets better from there. Refreshing and highly drinkable. Even decently sessionable with a reasonable 7.5% ABV. Goose Island knocked it out of the park with this one!"

"Second beer I've had of the sister series from goose island. Hazy golden yellow with a ton of bubbles, looks like champagne, a half inch slowly dissipating white foamy head. Smells very funky/yeasty, with some mild peachy fruit aromas. Taste is very tart! Pretty good if you like sours but very rich, the peach is there but kind of hidden, was hoping for more peachiness. Good beer from a great brewery but for the price I don't think i'll try this one again. If you can split the cost one this one with one or two other people then it would be well worth it considering it's just too tart to take on one your own."

"Bottle grabbed during the holidays and poured for the Super Bowl. Pours a very light yellow color with big white frothy head. Aroma is lots of sour vinegar and hearty sweet peaches in the background. Flavor is smooth and sweet peaches, very light touched here, behind big sour vinegar flavors and bretty funk and plenty of dry bite at the end. The mouthfeel is light and nearly spritzy, lots of carbonation bite, but very easy drinking. A nice light sour beer that goes nicely in the family of ladies. Enjoyed this more than Gillian by a good margin."

"Kinda was expecting more for they style, not sure it represents it right"
""
""

"Bottle from Proof. Poured into a Goose Island wine-style glass. Slight haze to this beer. Color is like the skin of a lemon. Yellow/gold with a twinge of straw. Tons of bubbly white head that held about a minute before fading into a thinner head and medium collar. Lots of lacing. Aroma is like dry earth, faint barnyard funk, a healthy amount of peach is noticeable, but not at all overpowering. Taste is delightful: peachy farmhouse goodness. Dry/tart yeast. Earthy/floral hops. Simply divine. Nice high carbonation and medium-low body really make this fun to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I really dig this beer. It's not a great representation of a saison to style but it really showcases the Brett and fruity qualities."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. Very similar carbonation level, viscosity, sour level, and overall feel to the older sisters. The peaches are subtle but apparent. Totally worth the price and highly recommended. I feel this is excellent where it's at in the aging process. If age brings out the peaches, then I hope the feel doesn't change. I'm glad I enjoyed it on a playoff weekend. This is certainly a bomber one can take to the head."
""
"O: an excellent ale - peaches added a nice, understated fruitiness, the wild yeast was balanced and kept things earthy and tacky; elevation of ale via wine barrel aging on-point. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Great beer that has a heavy $ tag on it, but worth it non the less. Wish there was a little more peach but the sour element is a very nice surprise."
""
""
"O: A great beer with tons of character, even if it is a simple one. Curious why it was released in the winter, this would be an amazing summer refresher. I might pick another one up for a hot summer day, if I feel like paying the $25 premium again."
""
"O - One of the best peach sours I've had as it has a strong juicy peach flavor balanced with slight tartness and Brett. I hope they make this one often and a lot if it"
""
""
"Overall, a wonderfully tasty beer, and a definite candidate for people looking to crossover into sour beers. I especially love the fact that you can somewhat manage the level of sour based on the temperature at which you drink it. If you're new to sours, grab a bottle, pour a glass and take a few sips straight out of the fridge. Then let it sit a little while and take another swig after it's warmed up to something closer to 50Â°F. If it hadn't been so expensive, I might've tried to grab a second bottle to see how much it sours over time. Oh well."
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is really nice. A little hazy with fair amounts of carbonation evident throughout, bubbly head, and some dry persistent lacing. Nose is yeasty and fruity. Crisp and lightly sweet fruit components, balanced with lightly bitter yeastiness. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: My favorite Belgian-style beer from Goose Island, hands-down. I definitely got my moneyâ€™s worth here â€“ even at $25. Excellent."
""
""
""
"Really looking forward to this beer. The bottle poured a nice orange colored body with a one finger foamy white head. Pretty cloudy as I would expect it to be. There is no fruit on the nose. You get some of the Belgian yeast esters and a bit of oak. The taste is loaded with lactic/yogurty tartness. The base saison does come through, but it is certainly an oaked beer. You get hints of the white wine barrel, but the barrel seems to have really killed the efferevescence in the mouthfeel. I just don't know where the peaches are. That was the lone reason I bought this beer. It would satisfy you if you're looking for a tart saison with some wine character, but if you tell me I'm getting peaches then I want it to taste like peaches. This one was a far cry from Gillian for me in terms of delivering the flavor. I only got hints of peach when the beer came close to room temperature."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Light body with plentiful soft carbonation."
""
""
""
""
"O: Highly drinkable, refreshing with nice flavors, and pairs well with food. They got the peach addition right on this. The price tag makes this unreasonable for everyday drinking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours yellow with a touch of orange. Quite cloudy. Small to medium white head, a bit fizzy. The aroma is fruity with some mild grape and oak. The peaches come through bright and clean. Not terribly jammy. There's some lacto sourness and a touch of funk. The beer tastes mildly sour - picks up a bit as the beer warms. Again, the fruit is relatively strong and quite pleasant but not very jammy. Rather dry. More wine barrel flavor. Seems like a mild, buttery white wine. Finish is fruity and pleasant with a strong tannic oak note. Mouthfeel is a bit effervescent. There's more body to the beer than I'd expect from the flavor. This beer doesn't have the depth or complexity of some fruited sours, but it's very pleasant and easy to like. I can't really find a fault with the beer. It would be an excellent choice for someone new to sours, and I don't mean that as a slight. It's tasty, fun to drink and unlike most other fruit sours. Interesting and delicious."
""
"Overall a passable wild ale, but not one I'd feel compelled to drink again."
"O: A nice wild saison with a bit of a weak finish. Tasty but it doesn't stand up to other peach-brett saisons like Logsdon's Peche 'n Brett."
""
""
""
"O - Lots of wine and subtle peach. Nice, but spendy."
""
""
"Overall, an awesome, somewhat sour, farmhouse ale. Not too sour, not too spicy or grainy, and tremendously easy to drink. It's refreshing and just a touch fruity."

"2013 edition."
"Its a bit acidic but otherwise really a great brew. I have another aging for a while...this should be an interesting one to see how it develops."
""
""
""
""
"Mouth feel was same as orange juice with extra pulp."
""
""
""
"A real impressive beer that's solid in every aspect. A great addition to the Sisters collection"
"Medium body with tight, tingling carbonation and a strong white wine barrel presence that slightly overpowers the wild yeast, peaches and saison flavors. Not much oak with just a touch of wood/toothpick but there is a really strong sweet vinous fruit flavor with light grape, raisin and buttery Chardonnay. This is followed by some peppery spice, possibly coriander or grains of oaradise, wild bugs and funky farmhouse yeast. Some grass and hay-like flavor along with musty brett and crisp light fruit, especially cider and pear. Light, crisp and refreshing with nice flavor but it's lacking depth and complexity. The white wine flavors are pleasant enough and this beer is very easy to drink, but I just wish that the peaches and farmhouse/saison flavors were a bit stronger. Decent beer but I wouldn't buy it again, especially at it's high price point."
""
"O: A very nice take on the Saison. Not sure it's worth the price, but an enjoyable beer none-the-less."
""
"Overall, this is a great farmhouse ale from goose island. It is meticulously crafted and all the taste profiles that were attempted were landed. I might have like to have more peach taste and aroma in this. In addition, there was a large amount of carbonation, more than I typically enjoy. Finally, the taste is more so lactic than funky. I think this brew drinks great now, but could really benefit from spending a couple years in a cool dark cellar, as the wild yeast develops a funky taste and aroma, and the carbonation calms down to lend to a smoother drink. Well-done from Goose Island. I'd drink it often if I could afford to!"
"This has some great Brett and peach flavors. Overall, the Brett, the peaches, and the sourness could definitely be more intense, but it's great for what it is. I'm curious to see how this evolves over a couple years."
"Brett and peach. Funky and fruity in good measure. It's worth drinking, but it might need a little bit more time to develop more complexity."
""
""
""
"Halia is a wonderful sour ale but misses an opportunity to express more earthen character. Though I like its expressive and clean acidity, it seems overly simplified. It would certainly provide a perfect counterpart to rich french reductions in entrees."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- not worth the ridiculous price point, but still a very good beer worth trying"
""
" B-"
""
"O: Overall, just the beer, this is very nice. Great flavors, well crafted. At the price point though, I would definitely not buy this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Doesn't hold a candle to Lolita, or even Matilda for that matter. Nice for a fruity Brett fix but definitely not worth the $21 I paid."
""
"This beer was so disappointing, I just didn't want to finish my glass yet alone the bottle. Watery, not interesting enough. In fact, the Crooked Stave Vielle saison we opened up after this was just so much flavourful, Halia tasted like water after we cracked the CS bottle. No way this is worth $23, and I'm absolutely done with Goose Island sours/saisons from here on. If you're thinking about taking the plunge, don't. You're better off with a Saison Dupont or something like that."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Halia pours a light bodied, opaque bright yellow in color with a light white lacing around the glass. It looks very similar to Temptation or Beatification in the glass. The nose offers aromas of acidic tartness, a touch of butter ala oak influence, and moderate tannic peach skin. It smells fantastic. The oak influence definitely stands out. The beer drinks light and smooth with a wonderful, slightly rich and buttery mouthfeel ala an oaked California Chardonnay or an aged Russian River Temptation. The flavors are very well rounded. There is a nice tannic tartness from the peaches and the beer has the perfect level of acidity. The brett is present in the near perfect amount. It all goes together so well. The drinkability for this beer is very high, further increasing its appeal. Overall this is an exceptional sour. Juliet has long been my favorite Goose Island sour but I've been longing for Goose to do a blond sour that I can get behind. That sour is Halia."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Would not be worth it at half the price. Probably would improve with age but I wonder where the peaches went."
"O-Juliet had more fruit flavor and more sourness, was expecting the same from Halia, but it didn't deliver."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"06/08/13 large format, poured into a snifter. Bright white fluffy head, thins out a bit but maintains a clear layer, decent cling/lacing. Opaque pale yellow, not quite like urine, but really cloudy. Light fruit aromas, zero sourness, but a light tart/fruit character to it. Some tart flavor up front, but overall creamy with light peach notes. Feel is incredibly smooth and only a little tart/dry. Light carbonation. Overall great beer. So different from the other ladies. Might be my favorite. Cheers."
""
""
""
""
""
"Similarities with Sofie are many, though the extra tartness and fruit character give Halia a slight edge. While not really a great value, this is still a great saison."
""
"That being said, Halia has noticeable oak character that really sets it apart. A bright and hazy golden yellow with a white head that quickly settles into nice lacing. It's very dry and has a wonderful mouthfeel about it. There are definite layers of flavor and aroma, peaches, buttery wood, bright tartness. I could enjoy this one for a while on a spring or summer's day, and I would definitely recommend having one now and saving another to savor at just that moment, though at $25+ for a bottle, that could be difficult."
""
"Head and shoulders above the other GI wilds I've had."
"O- Very tart, very juicy, very dry. It's a very good beer, but I'm surprised that there is only slightly more barrel presence than something like sofie, which is partially barrel-aged. All in all, a very nice peach sour."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: If you're expecting a sour you'll be disappointed. It is however, a flavorful, complex and easy to drink saison with just enough funk to remind you it's a wild ale. At $22.99 it's overpriced for what it is, but if you take price out of the equation, it's a definite winner."
""
""
""
""
"O-This is a pretty good beer. I'm not sure it is worth the price that Goose Island charges, but it is reasonably complex, offers a nice balance of flavors, and drinks more easily than many wild ales. The acidity is particularly pleasing here...there is just the right amount of tartness to pair with lighter foods and cheeses, etc. without going overboard and killing my gut."
""
""
"This is a fine Bretty Saison/Wild Ale. Not the best however. Considering that and the outrageous price, not something I am coming back to with all the great Saisons sitting on the shelf. A good beer, but Praire Artisan price point is so much better. Let alone a much better product."

"o - Overall a good wild ale, though I prefer Juliet and Lolita; would probably put this on par behind those with Madame Rose. I thought the nose was awesome and had a lot of peaches, but that didn't translate as well to the taste, which had more spice and citrus to it. A good beer for sure, but not worth the $30-40 I've seen some places trying to charge for it. I'd love to try it again sometime, but personally would picked up Juliet or Lolita again before this one."
""
""

"Hazy, pale yellow pour, with a foamy white head that settled to a thick ringlet; soapy lacing. Aroma heavy with Belgian yeast (brett), flowery, with notes of white wine, with a slight earthy funk; almost BPAish. Didn't really pick up any peaches in the aroma or the taste. Otherwise, flavors of pale malts, white grapes, a rather controlled acidity/tartness, brett, and some barnyard notes. Light-medium body, slightly prickly mouthfeel, but seemed like it might get a bit chewy if not consumed at a cooler temperature. In other words, this is basically a bottle to share, and I wouldn't tackle it on my own (especially for the price at which I've been seeing it). Decent, but not too memorable."
""
"This pours a mostly clear, golden color with a slight foamy head. The aroma is a mixture of peaches and grapes. The taste is very carbonated and yeasty with lingering hints of sour peaches. Interesting but not quite what I was looking for or expecting in a sour/wild ale."

"This is extremely refreshing and I will certainly be seeking out another bottle. I was hoping for a stronger peach presence but it is still very delicious."

"T: Led upfront by some sweeter peach and green apple flavors. White wine, lemon faint brett and some underripe pear flavors. Crisp and nearly perfectly carbonated. The flavors in here meld together amazingly well."

"Overall. This has to be my favorite GI sister. Delicious mild peach notes with great musty and funky yeast notes along with some good dry wood notes. Good base saison notes that work so well with the delicious notes of the peach and the Brett funk and tartness (4.75)"

"Overall this beer is a little greater than the sum of its parts. Unlike many sours I don't feel like the brett overwhelmes the profile and it ends up with a pleasant, extremely well integrated flavor. I won't profess to be an expert on sours but i've had my fair share of them at this point and I can say without hesitation that this is one of my favorites. For the price tag, I wish it was a little less drinkable to be honest. Goose island continues to be an extremely impressive brewery, despite what one may think of their in-bev association."

"Overall it's not a bad creation but the body lack some depth and the aromas and flavor don't seem to deliver the peaches very much."

""
""
"I'm marking the ""Overall"" score down quite a bit for the price, but if you have the cash and like peaches by all means go for this."

"The beer is hazy and yellow with a half inch of white head. The aroma brings white wine, peaches, brett, white grapes, oak. Smells nice. Tasty peaches. Mellow and smooth on the palate. A delicate sweetness. Fruit and white wine. Grape skins with a touch of funk. Overall, very enjoyable."

"O. This is an excellent beer and I'm glad I sought it out. Is it worth $25 for a bottle? I'm not sure any beer is worth that, but I can tell you I am happy with my purchase. It's a very well-crafted saison that has been aged with love in wine barrels and given a nice does of earthy, acidic peaches. It's outstanding, and worthy of your attention."
""
""
"Overall: A good beer, with a great nose and absolutely gorgeous, but one which is a bit lighter in flavor than I'd prefer. It would be interesting to see what some age could do to this beer."

"Served on tap at the Micro Brew Review in Oak Park. Pours a hazy gold with pillowy white head and heavy lace present. The aroma is peach forward with ripe peach flesh paired with moderately acidic notes and a bit of oak. A small amount of tart cherry Taste features an initial tartness which is followed up by juicy notes of peach. The fruit juice quality picks up intensity towards the finish and has a clean mildly tart finish. The peppery notes that typically give saisons that spicy bite is present, but very mild. A very small hint of farmhouse yeast character is present, but is mainly overshadowed by the peach which I appreciate in this instance. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing. A terrific offering by Goose Island and a very refreshing and moderately sour saison. Certainly worth a try."

"Tart and crisp with zesty carbonation, it has a certain depth to it, and not just a one-note sour ale. Peach pit with bits of clinging flesh, wild yeast elements, light acidity. A touch more oak presence in here would be nice. Crisp with a pleasant dry finish that triggers the salivary glands. Light bodied and refreshing. It would be easy to finish a bottle solo, hope they release this eventually."
"Overall: A nice Saison/Wild Ale. It's more Saison than Wild Ale."
""
"Mae is a great wild ale. I really hope we see it again in the future."
"O - Probably the best beer of the night for me. It's an excellent sour that I would love to have again, if offered. Hopefully, it stays as sour and tart as it is right now, because other beers like this (ie. Scully) have changed since I last had them."
