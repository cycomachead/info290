"If someone gave this to me early in the afternoon or as a substitute for champagne, I would happily drink it, but I don't think I will be buying any more for myself."
"Deep tangerine hue, very little head. Clearer than I thought it would be. Good looking, maybe expecting something a little bit more rustic and cloudy? Hints of overripe citrus and stonefruit, slightly bready character, peppery yeast notes summing the aromas up. Overarching peppery yeast notes on the taste. Subtle peach and apricot are really quite pleasant. Slight metallic taste on the finish. Crisp and refreshing, minor lingering flavors (the metallic finish too unfortunately)... still wanted that next sip! Enjoying Prairie's simple, clean takes on classic styles. Very good brew. Might not need to buy THIS one again, but growing increasingly impressed with PAA."

"M- To me, very creamy. At first it was cumbersome but as I settle in it seems about right and is enjoyable on the palate."

"Beautiful hazy honey color. A complex nose that I can't really explain: Slightly fruity but with a vague almost peppery smell. The taste is solid but I wish the nose come out more in the taste. The body is light and make this an intriguing and very drinkable beer."
"Interesting mix of spicy and fruity yeast tones with a ton of flavor for such a low end ABV. The body was a bit of a letdown considering the very big Saison type flavors but in the end it is still rather solid."

"3.48/5.00"
"Prairie Birra -----3/5."

"Overall: Its not the best Prairie beer I have had but its still decent. I think the reviews are a little bit low, Its better than an 85 to me."
""
""
"O - A decent option for a low-ABV non-funk-fest saison, though actually closer to a hefe than a saison really. Not a whole lot going on past green grape/clove."
""
"O: Good brew.  My first from Oklahoma.  I got it on Wishbeer in Bangkok, drank it in  Kunming."

"Serving type: bottle"

"Pours hazy,cloudy , golden yellow with enough sediment or yeast to dirty up the color a bit.  Soft matte glow..  White head of foam that fell fast but left spots of lace as I drank.   Nose is light floral and a slight breaddiness.  lemon, lemon peel.  An herbal that's leafy and grassy,a little pungent and peppery too.  Taste is  lemon.  Very juicy and very fruity.  Tart.  Lemon peel and pith combine for a bright earthiness.  Light sweet multigrain cracker. A drizzle of honey.  Active carbonation and medium mouthfeel.  Spice and peppery herbal finish this one with a lovely bitterness that seems tailor made to bring out that cool and vivid herbal.  Light overall tartness makes this one very easy to drink. As it warmed it drank flatter though."
"Odd funk to the smell, but overall a very drinkable sipper for a cool spring evening."

"Overall: I do like this beer. It is very drinkable and inviting. I like the emphasis on flavor over alcohol content. This is my first beer from Prairie Artisan Ales. I have one of their collaboration sours in my cellar as well that I probably won't wait to drink."

"For a beer which is attempting to hold something back, this beer is a revelation.  While it is definitely a good beer to have with food, the really special thing about it is the nose.which displays an ethereal funky barnyard which is so restrained but omnipresent that it just delights.  Wow..  It just shows the prowess of these guys.  Even when throttling back they can deliver something special."
""
"D:  I would love to work this into my summer rotation in place of a German Pils.  Packs a huge flavor punch at 4.2%.  A solid well made beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very heady throughout the session, the beer's color is pale sunlight with bubbles running through the body. It smells like a saison with vague spices, bubblegum, mint, and a note of manure like you're wandering around a barnyard. The beer has a spicy, grassy, flavor overall. Not only that, but it brings some tartness to the palate as well.  It's light, airy, easy drinking, and was an excellent drink to go with dinner."
"O- I understand having a more approachable offering to give to those who aren't familiar with craft, but I feel Prairie's saisons are approachable enough as it is.  This one can pretty much be thrown in with a lot of other mediocre Belgians that are on the market.  It tastes fine but is definitely the least enjoyable I've had thus far from this otherwise stellar brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
"This was my first Prairie beer after obviously hearing quite a lot of great things about them. To be honest, I really don't care for it. Hop bitterness and peppery saison yeast is about all i'm getting,  unfortunately not smelling or tasting any of the citrus or fruit that some have noted. Not terrible but just not something I would buy again."
"Great saison beer. Electrifies the taste buds."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dull, weathered gold color with a tight head of white froth.  Peppery floral soapiness, buttery white wine, biscuits, and crisp apples in the nose.  Citrus and apples, prominent spicy yeast, hay, and cracker-like grains.  Fresh, floral, and fruity sweet.  Fairly crisp, medium bodied, lingering dryness.  The yeast is talking a little too loud in this one."

"Overall I enjoyed this beer, it was surprising in some respects."
""
""
"Exhilarating flavor leaving your tongue tingling and craving more. Perfect balance of fruity nodes and bitter hope. Can spend a day in the sun with this well crafted beverage. Only complaint is ABV. Not much risk. With that being said, this is a beer I would definitely reach for again and again."
""
"Color looks like an unfiltered beer or almost even a mead. Quite an interesting bite to it. Slightly tangy. Overall good beer from Oklahoma."
""
""
"Overall - Can't think of anything bad to say. I could drink a bunch of these. For the alcohol level there is a great amount of flavor and body."
"Straw to golden in color with considerable cloudiness.  A half inch of dense off white foam is present.  Brussels lacing.  I smell a hint of lemon,a touch of grassy flavor, and pale malt.  The taste is lemon and then a blend of a grassy flavor and pale malt.  The mouth is crisp and heavily carbonated."
"I love Prairie beers, this one is well made, light and crisp with a bit of citrus and grassy notes.  Overall this beer to me is only OK - doesn't stand out like some of their ""bombs"" ... just not my particular favorite but overall nothing wrong with this beer."
""
""
""
""
"A pretty tasty home-grown saison, very fresh and emulating of the old-world goodies.  The extra hoppiness and lower alcohol goes a long way towards this one's drinkability, which I would imagine being improved further by a sunny patio or harvest moon.  Anyways, what's with the Italian spelling of 'beer' in the name here?"
""
""
""
"Cloudy yellow color, smells of an average saison, tastes almost like Budweiser- absolutely nothing on the back end, mouthfeel is very thin, medium carbonation"
"Not sure why this is rated so low. For a straightforward 4.2% saison, this beer has a ton of flavor. It's not funky, but this is a very solid sessionable saison."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Ok, best 4.2% beer I have ever had.  Full of flavor.  Great Saison!  Very well done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Didn't like it at all."
""
""
"The feel is good, maybe not as dry and soft as I'd like in a Saison but with a firm crispness and pretty smooth in a light-medium body."
"O - A great looking beer, but creamer and sweater than I typically like my saisons."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Light bodied, crisp, well carbonated ale.  This drinks like more of an Import saison than American version, as many tasters agree.  Well crafted beer and certainly worth the try."
""
""
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 10/7/2014. Pours lightly hazy bright golden color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, lime, orange peel, pear, pepper, wheat, cracker, herbal, straw, grass, light funk and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, earthy hops, and light pale malt notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, lime, orange peel, pear, pepper, wheat, cracker, bread, herbal, straw, grass, light funk, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, lime, orange peel, pear, pepper, wheat, cracker, bread, herbal, straw, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and robustness of fruity/spicy yeast, earthy hops, and pale malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and fairly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.4%. Overall this is a damn nice session saison style. All around great balance, robustness, and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, earthy hops, and pale malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
"A very traditional interpretation of the style. Very reminiscent of Saison Dupont. I think I like the ``Americanized'' versions of this style a little better, but this is a terrific beer for fans of Saisons."
""
""
"O- Overall this is a nice, light, drinkable saison.  Pretty typical for the style.  The only miss for me is in the carbonation.  This is my first brew from Prairie and I am looking forward to trying more."

"Pours a hazy golden color with a 3 finger width foamy head.  High carbonation.  Head retention is excellent.  Lacing is very good.  Slightly sour Farmhouse ale aroma.  Yeasty and slightly fruity.  Yeasty up front with fruitiness in the back.  Taste of cloves with high carbonation.  Good beer, but not one of their better beers or farmhouse ales."
""

"Overall: Fairly decent, it's low ABV and relatively easy drinking qualities were its best attributes."

"Great fruity earthy peppery funky farmhouse ale."
""
""

""

""
""
""
""
"O – I drank this with some fairly spicy Tex-Mex food, and it was a great beer to complement that.  The hop bitterness accentuates the flavors while the carbonation really washes it away.  Strong enough to stand up to the flavors, but mild enough to refresh between bites.  A really, really good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours out a hazy gold with a bone white head.  Smells fruity, with bready and honeyed malts.  I also get some spice and Belgian-ish yeast.  Flavor is of bready malts.  I get some spicy Belgian yeast.  Lots of clove. Very dry.  Lightly tart.  Aftertaste is big on yeasty slow dough bread.  Mouthfeel is light and bubbly.  This is awesome."
""
""
""
""

"Hazy, straw yellow body with a thick, white head. Aromas of wheat, grass, hay, floral notes. Tart citrus flavor with a touch of lemon rind. Mild bitterness. Light bodied and refreshing. Solid."

"Light body, carbonation is a little high."

""

""
"Tart and crisp, a building herbal hop bitterness lingers into the dry aftertaste. Earthy bitter herbs and tart underripe green stone fruit. Light and spritzy, with a signature rustic quality missing from so many domestic saisons. Simplicity is underrated, and this is a fine example of how good something simple can be."

"O - Branded to be sessionable as per the label, but the extremely high carbonation takes away from that a bit, making it a sipper. Overall, a very good saison."

"O: Outstanding, incredibly drinkable but with depth. Great offering from Prairie"

"This is an outstanding Saison across the board. It's light and easy drinking, low ABV, and full of flavor. It doesn't feature huge wild notes, nor unrestrained sweetness, that many Saisons focus on. Rather, it's fairly straightforward and delicious."
""
""
""
"Lack of flavor. Prairies worst offering for me this far. I think I'm just bitter that I will never get another Standard, which was one if my favorite offerings from Prairie. If I wouldn't have heard that Birra was replacing it, I prob wouldn't have been so hard on this beer."

"(3.75) D: This is a real good easy drinking farmhouse with all the boxes of the style ticked off. Added bonus of a lower ABV which is nice in the hotter weather."

"Overall, really great farmhouse ale - nothing mind-blowing, but refreshingly simple and well-executed. If I was a farmer in Oklahoma (or Belgium, for that matter) I could imagine drinking this every afternoon after working the fields... or whatever it is farmers do."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Lemongrass with a tad of peppercorn in the nose. Citrus, wheat, hay, and (of course) caramels (as is expected of most ales). Milder hops presence and quite a thin finish. A nice beer fr one of my fav breweries, but def not one of the best brews from this brewery. I remain a strong fan and dedicated... Just sad this beer isn't the star I'm used to from prairie."

"Not bad at all. Just not as well made, and all around great as Standard. Basically just mild esters, and mild funk. Enjoyable for what it is, but not close to one of Prairies better Saisons."
"O: Quite tasty – a nicely done saison in a 12 oz container. An enjoyable, easy drink. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""

"O - Very solid, no frills saison."
""
""
""
"This has become one of my favorite saison/farmhouse ales. I love the size and design of the bottle too. It's such a great flavor but not overpowering like many farmhouse ales. It's smooth and light, yet very flavorful. It's a bit of splurge but it's worth having. The artwork is always a pleasure coming from Prairie ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy light amber with big fluffy white head, a few blobs of lace on the glass. Smell: pepper, bready, grassy, mild herbal, dried fruit note. Taste: peppery, grassy, powdery dried herbs, cracker. Nice, low abv saison, but Prairie has several better ones."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is another take on the Saison/Farmhouse Ale. It is my opnion not as good as their other variations. While it does have its moments i have found it to be a little bitter at times and a bit to hoppy. It would be better if it had a slight more touch of citrus."
""
"This is a tasty and even delicate Farmhouse style of brew that is totally drinkable. From the 12 oz bottle purchased at Bottlecraft in San Diego."
""
""
"Cloudy golden-yellow color, topped with a huge three-finger puff of rocky white head; this simmered down to a thick collar and held there, lacing the glass nicely. Effervescent carbonation. Nice saison funk in the aroma, earthy, dry, grassy, some decomposing fruit. More barnyard funk in the taste, toasted wheat, pepper, earthy, floral, very subtle citrus pith. Got a little metallic as the temperature rose. Light-medium body, crisp mouthfeel, with a little harshness in the finish. But overall this was a decent saison."

"O: One of the most versatile beers I’ve come across in a long while: it’s light and refreshing enough to drink on a hot day, but perfectly complex enough to pair with some mild cheese or a nice meal. Another winner from Prairie, a brewery that is quickly climbing to the top of my favorites list. Cheers!"
""
""
""
"Overall it's just so impressive and nearly perfect, I don't know what else to say about the saisons these guys make."
""
""
""
""
"O: I thoroughly enjoyed this offering. Hit the mark on the style dead on IMO. Much more juicy and less dry than some traditional Saison/Farmhouse ales... However the zest kick still gives it the crisp dry characteristics. Brilliant. I would buy again and again in the future given the opportunity."
""
""
""
"very good. easy to drink. if it were a higher abv I could see myself drinking more of it."
""
""
""
""
"From the reviews I wasn't expecting this to be so tasty and refreshing. I think we'll see more of these, what they call a Belgian table beer. Sessionable and refreshing, this will be great with the oncoming hot SoCal weather."
""
""
""
""
""

"12 oz bottle from Tipples. Pours light golden colored, a hint of haze, with a big fluffy white head on top. Aroma of lots of hay and grass, light lemon peel, rustic dusty yeast, a hint of apple, and more dried out grass. So light and refreshing smelling. Flavor is hay, very (very!) light citrus rind, dry hops, yeast, and a bit of a pilsner character. Super light bodied with lots of carbonation. Thirst quenching even. What an awesome summertime brew."
""
"O: A wonderfully constructed beer. Highly recommended. Would have again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (4.0): Well, it seems that this is just my kind of beer. A light, well-constructed saison with plenty of character and no trouble going down. It’s dynamic, too, showing different aspects at different times, depending on vessel and temperature. Generally speaking, it’s just an excellent, table or almost-table saison that’s absurdly easy and pleasing to drink. Go getcha some, ya weirdos."
""
""
""
""
"O. A tasty beer but I'm not all too experienced with Saisons. Would like to try this one again."
""
""
""
"O: Could drink this alll day. If this was more availalble in CA I would pick it up regularly as a daily drinker. Great balanced flavor and aroma for such a low alcohol package. Prairie's saisons always impress!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The pour is muuurky wheaty golden with lots of lacing and head. Big wheaty oats saison aroma - some slight hop and citrus. Flavor of wheaty, malty, oats, citrus, saison - overall rustic quality...just so good. Its dry, flavorful, rustic...amazing. Love this and want more."
""
""
""
""
""

""

""

"Overall - I am not big on the style, but I like this one."
"Overall- I payed $3.99 for this Prairie beer at a local craft pub/bottleshop I cannot complain this beer is pretty darn good...I love Prairie beers and this one was a steal for that price...CHEERS"
"Pours to a frothy bubbly white head and dirty gold color. Aroma is peppery, clovey, and fruity with a sour/grainy note as well. Flavor is very much in the farmhouse style with lemons, bananas, white pepper, clove and other spices mixed with soft sweet grains to make it a perfect balance. Mouthfeel is slightly puckering due to funky yeast which is a good thing. Made by people who care about the funk. Damn good call."
""
"Overall, a decent offering, but like so many beers I come across with sub-5% ABV, this one just leaves me a bit wanting. Not Prairie's strongest offering, but still much better than many of the saisons that seem to be out there these days."
""
""
""
"This is a super solid all day drinker, but...it's $11/4-pack. Worthy of a try. Thanks Chris for the recommendation."

"Pours a cloudy, golden color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Slight retention and slight lacing. Smells of sweet malt, pale malt, wheat, slight citrus, and a hint of alcohol. Fits the style of a Saison / Farmhouse Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of wheat, pale malt, sweet malt, slight hops, slight alcohol, and hint of grass. Overall, decent appearance, aroma, and body."

"Pours a hazy light yellow with a foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, spice, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with slightly tart grain, yeast, and spice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness and an alcohol kick on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty but I wish the mouthfeel was a bit more crisp on this one."

"Overall: decent session farmhouse style beer. The balance of Brett and bitterness is slightly astringent but it is pretty interesting for the low abv."
"This may not be the best Saison I've ever had but it's light and fun an well worth a try."
""
""
""
"Overall, a quality farmhouse ale that is a good everyday beer. This beer is spicy, grainy, and a little fruity, providing the right level of complexity in an easy drinking package."
"T: To be honest, there just really isn't that much going on here. A kind of dull graininess throughout with a touch of lemon, hay and light barnyard. Finish shows a light breadiness and maybe a touch of grapefruit and spice."
"A fairly laid-back Farmhouse ale. The taste and aroma were pretty subtle. I still enjoyed it."

"Flavor follows the nose and is nothing amazing but its still well crafted. Notes of bread. Freshly backed baguette and notes of sourdough. Nice earthy mild funk that compliments the grain. Very drinkable with a crisp clean carbonation. Great for spring days!"
""
""
"This is a very easy drinking beer with plenty of flavor. Another well crafted beer from Prairie. Almost like a cross between belgian wit, low abv saison, and berliner. Recommended."

"Simple and sublime and never uninteresting. I think I've found my new favorite session beer."
""
"birra is a cross between a classic saison type and a hefe, a big fruity robust unfiltered wheat designed for all day drinking. instead of banana though, the most evident fruit is lemon, a beautiful hop profile as citrusy as ive seen in a wheat beer. lots of sediment in the pale hazy beer, some chunks and some haze, two inches of heavy off white head. fresh cereal grains and the lemon zest comprise the aroma, with not too much yeast to speak of, but the flavor brings a lot of yeast, a subtle spice complex, and an impressive degree of refreshment. the lemon cuts the cloudy yeasty beer to something not way different from a good shandy. the body is larger and the carbonation is softer, but the same flavor profile is sort of there, only wheat beer base instead of standard lager. a craft beer drinkers summer drink, this needs a bit more meat for wider seasonal applicability. i love the finish too, with the best of the grain and the hops, a very delicate but full flavored beer that is in line with the quality of prairies other offerings."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Birra is a highly refreshing and distinctive flagship-type beer that's highly preferable to ordinary lagers. But its a slight step down from Prairie Standard- you will be sorely missed!"
""
""
"Taste sways from the nose a bit, doesn't taste like corn but has a yeasty semi bitterness to it with a touch of sweetbread in the backend malt"
""
""
""

""
""
""
"O- I love what these artisan ale places are doing. Keep up the good work!"
""
""
""
"Cloudy banana peel yellow with a soapy white head that leaves some light lacing on the glass. Mostly yeast driven with black pepper, coriander, and general floral notes standing out. Hopping is mild lending more floral notes and fresh grassy bitterness. Despite the lower gravity nothing is sacrificed in terms of flavor or interest. Good dryness with a lingering bitterness. Doesn't come across as thin, which might be expected. The only major fault in my mind is that this knocked Standard out of the rotation. I wish there was room for both. Great to have a true local session beer though. A great light (but not ""lite"") option."
""
"Drinks easy, very refreshing, nice take on the style. I preferred the Standard, but this works as well. This will go down easy during our Hellishly hot summers here"
"O - I know I shouldn't try to compare this to the Prairie Standard, that it replaced, but this doesn't hold a candle to the standard. They describe this as more session-able than the Standard, but the 1% difference in ABV doesn't really do much to make it more session-able, really. Still, at $2.25 a bottle after tax at my local liquor store, it's still a steal. This may be the worst beer I've had from prairie, but it's still better than 80% of what's out there. This brewery continues to put out phenomenal products and really deserves more recognition. keep up the good work."
