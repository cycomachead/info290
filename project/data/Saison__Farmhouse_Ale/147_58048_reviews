"Yuck!  Way over spiced, no balance."
""
"An interesting experiment, but not what I expected and another beer I’m glad I tried but I would not try again unless it was a food pairing designed to compliment this beer. Each sip had sensory distortion as the aroma coming up through my tulip glass just blasted me with herbs and kept the overall experience out of synch. Gotta support the cause and the craft beer movement, but these misses are like collateral damage in the war to keep the beer machine flowing. One and done on this collaboration."

"O: An interesting saison, but it could have been better. The flavors do not separate enough, and in terms of texture, this beer falls apart in the mouth. For me, it was somewhat difficult to drink. I'm glad I tried it, but it is still a missed opportunity."

"The mouthfeel is light-medium bodied. It washes down rather clean. There is no real bite from the carbonation. Dry finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The sweetness and hint of spices blend well together to create a refreshing farmhouse ale."

"O - 4.25 - good beer, I'm not sure about how it measures up to other sAisons, but I Like to see Breweries collaborating on beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A unique Saison that uses various herbs. This is not for everyone, but I enjoyed the variety of flavours."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I wouldn't buy this again. It's not a bad beer, but I wanted to say that up front. I hold all three breweries, Dogfish Head, Stone, and Victory, in high regards, so I guess my expectations were set higher than what I experienced."
""
""
""
""
"Three style pushing breweries creating an American Saison- sounds good! The aroma is a herb bomb with big rosemary and thyme notes. The taste brings a nice saison spice along with big herbal flavor. At the end there is a warming from the alcohol and some dark fruit. Overall, not a beer I would drink everyday, but a great example of what all three of these breweries are all about."

"Looks good with a bright golden color, big, fluffy head and good lacing. Smell of hoppy citrus and lots of herbs also. A little herb, spice, hop bite on the tongue too which was nice and a dry finish. Very smooth I enjoyed this beer and would definitely have this again."
""
""
"O: A pleasant and moderately complex saison, refreshing when imbibed fresh out of the refrigerator, but permit it to drift toward room temperature to appreciate its more subtly nuanced elements."

"Last years vintage and still drinking mighty fine. Bright gold hue, good clarity thin white foamy head. Musty attic on the nose with spice and a belgian funk. Hints of rosemary and banana, strong yeast presence. Drinks almost as it did fresh, spice presence is still noticeable and so is the balancing hop profile. Spicy through out with a sweet belgian flair and herbal hops to round things out. Pretty nice. Touch more alcohol heat then i remember."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very interesting beer, for sure. However, the overall aroma and flavor of this beer was not pleasing. Again, I hate giving this low of a score for these three breweries, but this beer left me dissapponted."
""
""
""
""
"Live life drink beer!!!"
""
"The beer should have a disclaimer to require it to pair with savory meats like roast beef, pork belly, or tequila lime tacos. As a stand alone beer, the exotic herbs seem to be veering off in left field and lacking purpose."
"Overall this is a well crafted beer in which non traditional ingredients are well played. Glad i had the opportunity to try and i look forward to my other single!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A fun spicy, herbaly, grassy, grainy, fruity beer; a decent little collaboration from three great breweries"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: As expected, an interesting if not wholly successful collaborative experiment. Bold flavor combinations, but the contrast between the lemon/spice flavors and the harsh finish is too much. Still, worth trying."
"Overall- I like this one a lot. Nice and refreshing. Would be perfect on a summer day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - On the high side ABV wise for a Saison, maybe a bit to much hoppy bitterness, but refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nothing particularly amazing to look at, but I really loved the funky herbal aroma that came off this thing. Because of the herbs I paired it with a pesto chicken pizza with red peppers and goat cheese. While this pairing looked good on paper, I'm not sure it was really the best idea. It turns out, the flavor of the beer is so interesting that I almost forgot that I was eating pizza. I noticed the rosemary first, and then a sort of sweet citrusy flavor which gave way to an herbal/hoppy bitterness. While the flavor was unique and memorable, it wasn't so overpowering (as many of these ""experimental"" brews can be) that I wouldn't be happy drinking more than one of these in a sitting."
""
"O: very interesting and very different from a ’standard’ lager, but refreshing and not challenging ... once you get past that funky aroma."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very good beer. Seek it out, unless you don't like herbs."
""
""

"Pale hazy gold with a two finger head in my Sam Adams glass. Respectable amount of lacing, some specks floating around and light carbonation visible. Smell is very good with a firm pale malt body and a caramel honey sweetness. Some of the usual Belgian funk and yeast esters. The signature spices are not shy here with the rosemary being the biggest player. Taste has more of the spices up front with a grassiness from the parsley and sage flowing in the malt. Strong almost grapefruit like bitterness seems to be from an equal amount of hops and spice blend that covers the aforementioned citrus. Finish is spicy and hoppy with a touch of mint. Light tingley feel is crisp and highly drinkable. An interesting take on one of my favorite styles."
""
""
"I wouldn't drink this one all the time but, once in a while i would."
""
""
""
"Overall: Nice brew, would I drink it everyday...that's another story. To have it every now and then , why not? It's good to throw something different into the mix. Drink and enjoy, Salud!"
""
""
""
"Poured surprisingly pale and clear compared to the other versions, straw-yellow color, with a thin white head that dissipated to nearly nothing. Aroma was herbal and slightly fruity, spicy, with the rosemary taking a slight edge, as in the other versions. More of this in the taste, the spice blend coming to the foreground, lesser notes of somwhat sweet pale malts, light citrus, herbs bordering on potpourri. Light mouthfeel, moderate carbonation. Good in small doses."
""
""
"O: Complex and yet clean. A great beer to relax with. Clean flavors and nicely blended. Well done collaboration. A very subtley funked saison but I enjoyed it very much."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A delicious and unique take on a very commercially and culinary underrated style. I went in expecting a decent brew, but this is definitely a few cuts above decent. Just like any other saison, this is a great holiday feast beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Try it if you like the style. I wonder how this recipe differs from DFH's version. Maybe it doesn't except for geography."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O --- It's a solid beer, but nothing I would need to seek out. Somewhat tame for the brewers involved in the collaboration."
""
""
""
""
"O - An excellent collaboration. Love a good farmhouse ale, and all of the herbal spices add an interesting character."
""
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a light to medium golden amber. Half finger white head dissipates slowly to a thin film, thick ring around the glass and lacing. Pleasant aroma of bready malt and Mediterranean herbs, especially sage with a hint of saison yeast. Flavor is citrus, bready malt, nicely herbal with distinct sage and rosemary, finishing slightly dry with lingering herbs, light hops and saison yeast. Medium bodied. Very nicely made and enjoyable. Maltier and more heavily herbal than traditional for the style, but worked perfectly for me. This is the last of the three versions I've tried and I'm interested to see from past reviews how much more I like this than the first I tried (Victory). I'll have to start the cycle again with the Victory version, because the higher ratings of the last two are more likely due to my increasing enjoyment of saisons."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is very tasty Saison. Took a few sips to get used to the herbs, but this beer became delicious to drink halfway through. Will have to try the other two breweries take on this collaboration."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Somewhat interesting but not much of a standout saison. The best quality is the earthy aroma on this beer. For that, I can give props to San Diego and this craft beer community."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a honey gold with a disappointing, thin white head that fades quickly. The nose is herbal and pungent with a modest honey sweetness. It smells quite interesting and is definitely the most herb-forward of the three. The taste is a blast of freshly cut, spicy herbs, sweet clover honey, and a touch of yeast. It's a very drinkable beer and more bitter/dry than expected. You definitely get the intimate herbal experience that you're expecting with this beer (over the others). It's definitely the best of the three and worth trying."
"O: An interesting Saison with rosemary and hops dominating that would probably pair nicely with some garlicky Italian food."
"I loved the taste. It was very different to me, as I have not had too many Saison beers, or any beers with Sage and Thyme (my two favorite spices) The sage and thyme were definitely predominant throughout this beer. I thought the coolest part about this beer was how the thyme brought out the hops. Really cool stuff, I'll definitely have this again!"
""
"a far far superior product to the dogfish one. it pours clearish for a saison, pale yellow in color, with a prominent white head an inch or two tall. the nose is real herbal, floral, and funky. maybe a different yeast strain used in this one? lots of peppery stuff happening. flavor is much more herbal than the dogfish version. the sage really stands out to me more than anything else. its fresh and light in the mouth, with excellent carbonation and a light medium body. the herbs in this beer make it pretty unconventional in taste, and this isnt for everyone, but i thought their forwardness in this beer was an improvement. id like to try the victory version now to round out the trilogy. definitely not as hoppy as most stone brews, and might benefit from some more of that, but not a bad beer to try as a single."
"O-I loiked this better than the DFH version. spices came through more and had a great balance. really enjoyable"
""
"cloudy yellow-orange in appearance. thin white head clears quickly leaving very little sign of there being any to begin with. smells like chicken stock, which I like. lots of herbs like rosemary, sage, parsley and thyme with some lemon rind in there also. taste is kinda chicken stockish, but better. the herbs and citrus blend well to make for a tasty treat. mouthfeel seems kinda creamy and buttery. carbonation is present on the tongue, unlike in the appearance. a little dry on the finish but not too much. overall this was rather tasty and didn't last long, so i must of really liked it."
""
""
"Pours a slightly cloudy pale yellow with ample white head and great retention. Big aroma with herbs very forward, sage, thyme, rosemary and something I can't put my finger on (after reading bottle more closely parsley). Fruity esters also dominate with lemon-orange. Taste follows with strong herbal qualities, sage and rosemarry. Fruity esters here as well with lemon-orang tang. Slightly spicy and sour as well. Mouthfeel is well balance with bitterness and a bit of sour. Overall a great beer, although not your traditional saison."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Wow, this is an interesting beer. Not even remotely refreshing. I wonder what the experts would pair this with? Maybe a rotisserie chicken? How about a strawberry, rhubarb & rosemary Popsicle? Maybe if you held the sugar at bay. Either way this is a savory beer that needs something savory."
""
""
""
"Overall, a unique and tasty take on the style. As I mentioned, a bit one demensional, but still good."
""
"Overall (4.0): Definitely enjoyed this beer, and I really appreciate what these three breweries have done. It’s not a perfect saison, but it’s good and it’s innovative. I really enjoyed the different components, but at least on the palate it didn’t mesh perfectly—in the end it had a little too much herbal-medicinal bitterness on the finish that I think could have gone in a different direction if done a little differently. Now I just need to try the red wine barrel aged version . . ."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Interesting take on the style, but not something I would want very often. May be a good one to pair with food."
""
""
"O- This is an interesting beer. Not a classic Belgian Saison, I'm missing the yeast and some of the phenols and esters but the herbal stuff is aromatic and tasty."
""
""
"The last of the pack to be tried. Enjoyed this one as much as Dogfish Head's, if not more. 4.0"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I think I prefer the DFH version, but its hard to say as there has been a few months between trying each version. The stone version has a slightly harsh flavor on the end, and the abv bump is kind of odd. Different yeast maybe? Either its a solid beer with a well integrated herb presence. An enjoyable experience/collaboration for sure."
""
"O: Very interesting and enjoyable - not something that you would drink like a session beer but the herbal notes are very tasty. The smell of this beer is probably the most enjoyable part as the smell is quite inviting."
""
"I'm pretty sure this is the Stone version. Drinking it straight outta the bottle at the pool! Aromas of pine, floral hops, sweetness. Tastes of definite rosemary, subtle honey, nice pale malts, hoppy hoppy. Smooth as eggs. Perfect balance of carbonation. I dig these three breweries and I dig this collab."
""
""
"This is solid. A great saison with an intense herbal aroma and flavor. The herbs remind me of my grandmother's kitchen. Overall, this is a great, drinkable beer. The only downside is that the herbs become intense after a bottle or two. It's worth splitting them up."
""
""
""
""
"a bitterness that's much like swallowing pine cones, much more earthy than the other 2 versions of this.. and still my favorite of the three. it's exactly how i remember it last time (2010?).. which is ridiculous, because i've had hundreds of different beers since then. a very unique taste mixed with a medium body, nice creamy feel hits your lips but still so bitter and refreshing at the same time that you can't help but want more and more of this. an excellent saison series, and the best of the best right here."
""
""
"I am not quite sure what to make of this beer. It's the most unique tasting saison I have had to date. The herbs dominate this beer from beginning to end. The alcohol is well masked. This beer doesn't come close to drinking as strong as it is. I can say with confidence that this beer would pair well with poultry, or work wonders in a marinade/brine. Props to three great breweries for creating an interesting beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Definitely one of the more memorable takes on the saison. Usually not a huge fan of spiced beers but these add more to the great aroma rather than dominating the taste. Feels like a real collaboration with each adding something that adds up to greatness."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is one of the better saisons I've had and maybe the best American one"
""
""
"Poured a hazy light yellow/gold color with a thick long lasting head, awesome lacing. The aroma is very intriguing, strong herbal notes of rosemary and thyme along with other earthy and fruity notes, light citrus. Taste is equally as intriguing. All of the herbal flavor comes through right up front with more notes of pine and very slight citrus flavor. There is a lingering sweetness, as well as a slight hop bitterness, very well balanced, clearly the herbs are the star of this beer. Medium carbonation and medium body with good mouthfeel. This really is a good beer, however it's just so different. I don't know if I'm ready to commit to have this on multiple occasions, but it's definitely worth picking up just for the experience. The BUFF trio really are trying to push the envelope as far as developing new beer trends, and this is an excellent example."
""
""
""
"O-interesting, but wouldn't want to drink alot due to the overpowering herbs"
"O: This is a very nice beer with a lot of character and flavor. It for sure a good collaboration and I cant wait to try the other takes on this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Stone: Poured from bottle into glass. Slight hazey golden, with foam that is gone quick. Lots of carbonation. Really herbal and citrus hop aromas. You really smell all the herbs in this one. Taste is typical saison funk, but herbal and very citrus hop flavors. Its easy drinker and pretty tastey. Not amazing but not bad."
"O: This was an interesting brew.... you could even say unique, but is it for the better? Well all I can say is that I'm conflicted. I don't think I was satisfied, but I encourage these sort of experimental beers. It was truly worth the price if anything. So with that said, I would recommend for the experience, but wouldn't continue to buy. Savor Great Beer!"
""
""
""
"Overall, not bad. Some good qualities but the herbal focus is not my thing."
""
""
"O: a pretty tasty beer. it has good flavors and nice complexity but isn't quite to style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Interesting, but not necessarily over the top as one might expect from three particularly talented breweries. A really nice domestic saison in my opinion and while the herbs definitely have a presence, it kind of leaves you wanting just a little more. A fine beer none the less."
""
""
""
"I think this is a pretty good spice beer, but out of the three Saison du Buffs... I like the the DFH the best."
"Overall a pretty good summer beer, I still like more traditional Saisons better"
""
"O-It was a complex beer, with a long finish. True to its label, it was very herbal. However, that vegetal aspect rubbed me the wrong way and I could have used more yeast/fruit. I just don't think it was for me."
""
""
""
""
"O - Ironically this was the first of the three Saison du Buff that I tried, but the last I am reviewing. This one, like the others, is big on the herbs. I really enjoyed the aroma but my palate fatigued of the flavors somewhat, by the end. I would still rate it just above the DFH version, in the competition of interesting, but mediocre beers."
""
""
""
"O - A nice rendition of a Saison but, not something I would look to drink a lot of. The problem lies with the sage. I feel that they used it a tad too much and it completely masked the other flavors that I'm guessing they wanted the drinker to experience. Nice novelty item but, that's about where it ends."
""
""
"Pours a clear yellow with a foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, herbs, and spices. Taste is of malt, grain, herbs, spices, and yeast. There is a mild spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is pretty easy to drink but I think it smells better than it tastes."
"I really enjoyed this version of SDB after waiting a long time to get ahold of this second brewing from Stone. Nice looking beer - golden color, crystal clear, and with a good head. Even after 20 minutes some head remains. Smell is bright with the spices and a good dose of lemon. Taste is enjoyable - very refreshing - in addition to the expected Saison flavor the hops come through a bit more in this version that Victory or DFH. Well done!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Very well executed, but not a necessarily a combination of flavors I'm really looking for or craving in a beer. The ingredients list reads off like something you might use to spice up one's spaghetti sauce."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, delicious and easy to drink. No hint of alcohol. Distinctly HERBAL as opposed to the floral/citrusy flavors we're familiar with from hops & white beers."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: if both DFH and Stone are involved, always worth a try - very interesting tasting beer - enjoyed the spice combination, as it came through in both the aroma and flavor"
""
""
"I took the suggestion to try this beer not knowing anything about it. When I opened the bottle and smelled what was in there I knew that this would be quite different from beers I've previously tasted. It's a clear see through gold liquid that adopts the colors of whatevers behind the glass. It smells like a garden. The aroma of the herbs blend together to make this smell like a flower garden. The smell alone is relaxing and can take you to a different place. The taste is very unique. I noticed the bottle doesn't say beer anywhere but malt beverage. The flAvor of he herbs has a stronger accent on the overall taste than most recipes that you'd see them in. This is fine and pleasant in this case because they're guided by the light malt and carbonation that present the herbs to your tongue. The herbs still gently tingle on your tongue after a sip. Is a very nice beer for relaxing on a quiet day."
""
""
""
"C"
"O - A descent beer, not my favorite from Stone and not my favorite of the Collaboration series but I'm glad I tried it. Fans of the Saison style beer should definitely try this one out"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o - very drinkable and refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very easy and refreshing to drink. These breweries should do more together."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Interesting take on the style but this wouldn't be an everyday saison for me."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is like curry in a bottle, crazy ammount of developed spices, other than initial spice kick not a hole lot going on though, minimal malt/hop flavors. One of the more unique beers I've had. Nothing I would drink everyday but one of the best ""tick"" beers out there. Give it a try as I dont think you'll have anything similar."
"O-Very unique Saison and would definitely recommend to fans of the style looking for something different."
"Poured from bottle to tulip the beer arrives a brilliant golden color, fairly opaque in nature, with a decent 1.5 finger white head, good retention and lacing. Fairly translucent. The nose is an aggressive blend of peppery lemon, yeast, and herbs. Similarly the flavor is a punch of lemony pepper, yeast and then an abundance of sage, allspice, rosemary spice. Different, aggressive but not overly so. Mildy bitter and fairly clean. Not much hop character. Finishes a bit thin in nature with a lingering herb flavor. Overall, glad to have tried it. Might go well with a rosemary lemon pepper chicken? I enjoyed it but likely won't be back."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I fell in love with this beer when it first came and i am so amped it came out again. Easily my favorite Saison. I could drink this all day."
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is a light gold, with a white head, fairly frothy. It has a nose which contains yeast, sugar, hay, sage and other herbs. Taking a sip of this saison and I taste rustic style bread, citrus and some soap. It has a mouthfeel which is medium, rather dry in the finish. A fairly sweet aspect to the finish as well. All in all, a solid saison, which I am happy to see has hit the shelves again."
""
""
""
"A bit hoppier than the other versions of this beer but it seems to sacrifice some of the herbal notes that make it so unique. Lemon citrus and bitterness are welcome addition."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not up to snuff on this collaboration, although I’ve heard Dogfish Head’s BUFF is well put together. As disappointed as a true saison lover may be you have to appreciate Stone, Victory, and Dogfish Head for daring to risk their street cred and assuming the costs of such an undertaking."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one different Saison. It seems to me that most other brewers try to highlight the yeast in their Saison, but this one really pulls it back to showcase the herbs. I could get nearly all the herbs in the nose, but I'm wondering if I'd have tasted them if I hadn't read the bottle. It's funny, that power of suggestion. Regardless, this is a very drinkable, delightful beer that I'd like to see in bombers. It's commendable that the brewers took one of my favorite styles and did something different, yet it still fits the style."

"O: An awesome Saison. Only flaw is the sage dominates a tad to much. This is a must try Saison IMO."
"Sage rocks. I almost want to have this with cast ironed-skilleted pork chops with apples and sage."
"i love tgat brewers are experimenting with beers but this should not be sold to the public. it should just be made available as an experimental beer maybe at the breweries themselves. I think I'm done with saison beer in general."
"Pours a hazy pure golden yellow, with a creamy two fingers of head leaving thick curtains in its wake. Wow, the nose hits you straight away with its bouqet garni - strong coriander seed right away, wild fennel (strong licorice scent that you would smell when hiking in the bay area) along with a wet earthiness as well, nothing like i have spelled before - very intriguing though not necessarily what i want from a beer. Also there is a layered hint of belgian yeast spice as well. The mouth brings all the herbs together which is impressive to taste all the flavors thats its made with though to me thats not a good thing as im not the biggest herb fan in the world. Coriander sings first, with sage coming in right behind it holding till the end - with a wisp of rosemary showing itself in the middle. The finish is good and refreshing and somewhat cleans up the herbage on the finish. A well made beer though not my taste whatsoever."
"Note: to the purists who don't like reviews that don't live up to their standards, stuff it. :)"
"Overall a great beer with an amazing list of odd ingredients which seem to work very well together. I loved it and am looking forward to this and further releases."
"D: A good drinker and well-crafted. Plenty of depth, but nothing is the least bit overwhelming. It doesn't come off as a kitchen sink brew either, it works."
"Perhaps my least favorite beer from Stone. I did not like this, though it was more of an interesting experience/experiment, than it was a bad beer."
"Overall this is a decent beer and one of those beer that is better then its individual parts."
"O-Amazing how well this has held up over time. Bravo"
"D - Very drinkable. One of the most unique and amazing beers I've ever had! Great credit goes to the 3 brewers!!!"
"O: better than I anticipated. Unique. Would go great with pizza"
"D- Not what I expected at all, better! The aroma and flavor are so complex, but incredibly refreshing. I just hope I can hunt down another bottle. This is the first beer to really excite me in a while."
"Poured all head at first, white and slow to drop. There's an immediate strong hoppy smell like a strong IPA. Body is a hazy yellow. Tasty is both hoppy and herby and considering it has a spice cabinet of parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme in it no wonder. Finish is too bitter. I'm not sure where they get off calling this a saison because the flavor isn't really from the yeast or malt so much as the spices and although other saison's might have zest or peppery spicing they don't go down the savory route like this example. Saisons are supposed to be refreshing beers brewed for farm hands whereas this is more of a savory broth I'd target to the autumn."
"D - Very drinkable. The spice addition to the Saison style makes for a pretty solid beer. Maybe not a traditional Saison, but a good beer nonetheless."
"From notes. Tasted in mid-August 2010 from bottle at Lush Roscoe. Pours clear golden with a fluffy white head that retains good lace. Nose has that signature saison dustiness and hint of sweetness with the added element of sage strongly hitting the nose. The palate has a nice bread flavor with some bittering hops, and then moving to that hard to miss sage flavor. The body is medium with lively carbonation and a long finish dominated by sage."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Overall: This is a good, but not the most interesting saison. The herbs dont intrude in this one like in the other two. I like it fine."
"D - Very nice interpretation of a Saison. Very glad I got to try this collaboration between three amazing craft breweries. However, the intensity of the lemon notes and its one dimensionality have me longing for a Belgian saison/farmhouse....Fantome..mmm."
"I really wanted to like this beer, and the pour was nice enough- nice golden color, and a very white head with nice loft to it. Unfortunately, the rosemary destroys this beer. Very powerful aroma and flavor that just overwhelms everything else. Very singular note here. Sharp and herbal in the mouth, this just isn't my cup of tea."
"This will probably be the last saison I drink, but hey, I gave it a try!"
"D/O: The first sip of this beer is a doozy--the smell does it no favors--but if the drinker can allow their palate to acclimate, then it may become a thoroughly different and enjoyable take on the saison style. Aside from the unconventional qualities developed by the herbal amendments, this beer is remarkably clean--so much so that one would not immediately believe that Belgian yeast was responsible for its fermentation. I liked this beer much more one year on than when it was young. Better late than never, if it took that long to become acclimated to (or accepting of.)"
"O: Overall a nice take at the style and maybe a bit better than the or examples."
"O- Excellent experience, very refreshing and enjoyable. Can't wait to try the other two."
"Overall, an interesting take on the saison. Not exactly what I'm looking for when I go in search of a saison, but interesting nonetheless. I also have the Victory version lined up for this evening as well. I'm looking forward to comparing the two."
"The beer pours a hazy yellow color with a huge white head. The aroma is full of Belgian yeast, lemons/oranges and some pepper. The flavor is more complex and completely different. I get a ton of herb notes in the beer, mainly rosemary and thyme, but possibly some other herbs as well. I also get a lot of wheat, pepper, ginger and yeast notes. While there are a ton of flavors present, something about them doesn't sit quite right with me. The flavor is a little bit of a mess, but still enjoyable. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Hey, pizza in a bottle, why not?"
"Herbaceous ! I think it's like ouzo...you like it or you don't. I like it. It reminds me of beers from three floyds like rabid rabbit and gumballhead. The herbs are exited by the carbonation and the wheatiness. This is a very good lawn mower beer and I mean that in a good way. It's also a very good food beer. Try it with chicken marinated in Goya Mojo Criollo and slow roasted on the grill."
"Drinks pretty well but this particular hasn't really wow'd me."
"O- easy to drink, feels light and would be nice to drink during a cookout. im not too familiar with saisons and am hoping from this type of brew down the road"
"D - Very easy drinker could have this again. A really well put together collaboration brew."
"the CPJ"
"Drinkability: One is enough for me, a little too lopsided."
"I was on the fence on whether I liked this or the Stone version more at first, but when I think of which I would rather have again in the future, I think it would be the Victory."
"T: Something a bit medicinal about it. The herbs are well balanced by some sweet malts and not allowed to take the taste over, which I think is a good thing."
"D: Great taste, lots of lemon zest, a little prickly in mouthfeel, but very workable ABV. Could drink a few of these on a hot day."
"Pours a very clear very pale yellow with a small head and some good lace. The aroma is amazingly strong with cooking spices, fresh parsley and mint with plenty of cage some clove, some cardamom, the whole spice rack indeed. The flavor has some lemongrass and mild spiciness, the beer is nicely dry and bitter with some parsley and sage. The palate is a little thin. Nice enough beer!"
"Starts with a sweet citrus and spicy it milds and finishes dry with a dry mouth the spices present themselves and finishes bitter much like you'd get from licking a lemon"
"On a spring evening, this was still a good choice, and an interesting experience overall. I'd pick this up again if they continued to brew it but really I'm looking forward to the next collab..."
"Pours a golden hue that reminds me of wheat but is a bit more amber-toned. Almost a figer of frothy, bubbly, uneven head, which doesn't seem huge for a saison, but looks very nice. Very hazy, with small carbonation bubbles mingling around the glass and larger ones streaming in a variety of sizes and at a variety of speeds to the top of the glass. Very strong smell--a bit like Bell's Hopslam, oddly, with only a few herbal saison notes that I'm picking out. Pleasant enough. Smells like it'll get a lot funkier as it warms, and is pretty nice. Tastes good, love what they did with the style/creativity. Mouthfeel is absolutely awful and inconsistent. Drinks smoothly on a nice spring-like day."
"Drinkability is just average for me. I can finish one, and if there was nothing else, maybe a second in a social situation. But if it's just me at the computer, or watching TV, one would be plenty. I had Stone's version, and initially considered trying the other ones if I could find them still on shelves. But after making it most of the way through this one, I think I'll pass."
"D: i love whats going on here, but i gotta say ones enough. very very interesting concept, just too much concept."
"A complex, deliciously flavored beer, great to enjoy regularly or with a good dinner."
"D: I would like to taste the actual beer instead of an herb garden. I'm curious if the other versions are at all different, but not terribly so."
"I've been interested in this beer since I first read about it and I'm glad I tracked it down. It is even better than I expected, one of the best, most interesting Saisons I've had. It would pair very well with food."
"Pours golden with the most head of the three. A bit murkier than the others. Smells strongly of Rosemary actually. And thyme. More balanced than the others. A bit overfly carbonated but definitely the best of the three"
"Mouthfeel - decent"
"Pours a chill-hazed goldenrod with a three-finger plume of dense off-white head that takes several minutes and several pours to fill the glass properly. Aroma is golden malts coupled with a heavy helping of both rosemary and sage, which imparts a sweet and zesty quality. The parsley and thyme are much less forward. Flavor is very similar. Very herbal and green with a flabby pale malt baseline. Finishes dry from tannic astringency and I'd be lying if I said the high carbonation wasn't distracting. Body is too thick and sweet for the style. Perhaps DFH was in charge of the attenuation process in this collaboration."
"Drinkability: I'm not really sure; I was able to drink this glass pretty fast, but I may need some time to drink about whether I would want this again. Or maybe I just need to explore the style a little bit more."
"Yet another collab, this time between Dogfish Head and Victory. Fresh herbs and attitude. Clear golden orange, and the lacing impresses. Herbs in the nostrils in this order: rosemary, sage, thyme and parsley. Crisp medium body, a little bitty. Dry maltiness meets a slightly chalky yeast. Herbs are very forward and all over the palate. Alcohol shows up with a dried fruit flavor and some warmth in the back. Baste a chicken or drink with one? Vive la American Saison!"
"D - perfect, I could have many of these"
"Taste is dominated by the aromatics, sage, thyme, pepper."
"One of the most complex and interesting saisons I have ever had. Poured light bright adn full of life. Nice head decent lacing and just pretty. Made with herbs and they were very present in the aroma along with lemon zest and slight funk. Very fresh and lively both in aroma and in taste. All the Herbs are present in the taste as well as the lemon, zesty yeast flavors, grass and some earth. Again, this is a lively beer in every way and it's having a party in my mouth. I was told that I was dirnking the 2nd to last one in London, so after I finished I had the (what was said to be) the last bottle. I would drink mor eif I could find more. Really a beautiful beer."
"M/D - Medium bodied with just a hint of chewy wheatiness. Excellent carbonation carries the beer through and the alcohol is not at all noticeable until a light warming at the end. Given the wide array of tastes flying around I still find the beer rather drinkable. Not sure it is somethign I love, but it is definitely interesting and not something I would turn down in mhe future."
"D: An OK beer that could likely improve considerably with a few tweaks."
"I poured this bottle into a tulip glass and was greeted with a short lived white fizzy head sitting on top of a extremely orange bodied brew. The aroma was like sweet oranges with a lot of herbs thrown in for luck. I mean some herbs, sage rosemary parsley and pepper. I thought I was a cooking a Thanksgiving turkey. Flavor wise I got pretty much the same thing a big old herbal mess not to much Saison flavoring going on. In other words a little bit of herbs go a long way. It had a medium feel in my mouth and good carbonation. I think drinking the 12 oz bottle was enough for me there was just to much going on."
"This is a bold and flavorful saison. There is complex spiciness and intricate flavors, although no distinct or dominant single herbal flavor. There is nice subtlety to this beer. It's dry with a slightly bitter finish, has nice citrus and Belgian undertones."
" Body is nicely carbonated, but not overly bubbly, and not velvety like a true Belgian saison. Finish is nice and dry, why is quite true to style. While an interesting experiment, I think this beer suffers a little from too many flavors jockeying for position. Nonetheless, try it if you see it, it's worth the experience."
"Gorgeous golden yellow with a marshmallow fluff head; white and soapy and stalwart. The aroma is everything you'd hope for, a roast chicken without the chicken: parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme, with more than a little grapefruit for good measure, a whopping quenelle of mango sorbet, and some crackers in the background. Super-focused citric-herbal flavor without a tremendous amount of nuance, but what's there is delightful: tangerine and grapefruit laden with holy basil and kaffir lime, purple sage and lemon thyme, round and meandering yet somehow snappy and focused. Deliriously tasty - a wonderful beer in spite of its soapy overtones."
"D - Very drinkable, this should be available in 6-packs all year long. One of the most unique and amazing beers I've ever had, major props to all three brewers!"
"Serving type: bottle"
"12 ounce bottle. Pours slightly hazy bright amber color with a 1.5 finger white head with great retention and good lacing. Aromas of malts, rosemary, and sage dominating with floral hops. Taste is strong of rosemary and parsley, with a good amount of bitterness on the finish. Spices sit on the palate for quite a while after the finish. Very interesting beer, never had anything like this before. Solid, I enjoyed it."
" A very intriguing beer, but I feel like it fails to meet the intended goal, it seems a bit messy but overall its not bad. Still, I walk away a bit disappointed."
"Drink- The 2nd of 3rd in the vertical. So far 1 of 2."
"For a saison it was extremely clear and light in color, no cloudiness and closer to a yellowish orange than a deep orange. Large white foamy head and beautiful lacing. Golden color, light crisp, very drinkable flavor. The nose is a strong citrusy and sage like hop aroma but without the strong bitterness hops in the taste. A unique spin on a saison style that is light and refreshing. Would definitely buy a 6-pack of this if they had it."
"Amazingly complex. A real foodie saison. Worthwhile."
"Personally I thought this collaboration was nice in theory, but fell short in execution. Stone, however, brought on a beer I'd try multiple times."
"It's a very herb-forward saison but seems more well integrated and balanced than the Victory. Very fresh and clean."
"Lighter medium body, dry, and a little bitter feel. Drinks pretty nicely, alcohol is masked well enough, although it was a bit sweet overall for me."
"3.0 D: None of the versions are that good, but I think I'd probably pick this one. It has the best overall traits, though a bit more carbonation is needed."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style even though it seems a lot like a Witbier, if you're into the spicy flavor this is a good beer to drink for a while."
"Drinkability is great given this brew's experimental nature. Really liking this style lately. Definitely give this one a shot if you can find it."
"Poured a hazy incandescent gold with a fluffy white head that lasted the entire time. But the smell, oh my god, what happened to this beer??? Sure, there's parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme in it. It's an awesome combination on chicken or in Scarborough Fair, but this is awful. It smells like someone took a spice bag, added some herbs to it, and boiled it in a pilsner. Then threw brettanomyces in there and let it ferment a couple months. Spice tea gone bad. Ugh this is unbearable. Sorry Stone, Victory, and DFH. I love you guys but this was the worst beer I've ever had from any of you."
"Pours a hazy golden yellow with lots of carbonation bubbles racing go the top. A persistent thin white head hangs on for the duration. Aroma is very herbal, and the taste follows suit. This is a unique Saison. I would typically associate these flavors with cooked meat, but they work very well in this beer. Body is light, very enjoyable brew."
"It is a pretty good beer and while Im not that rounded with Saisons is seems like a pretty unique brew!"
"D - A very drinkable beer. I enjoyed it and in the next few days will be trying the Victory and Dogfish versions."
"The citrus touch makes this stand out against the Vic. Both are very nice, but this one gets the nod by a hair."
"This beer is definitely a sipper, not one to be gulped or tossed back. If you're going to try this beer, you need to really put your heart into it, you need to let yourself be taken over by the aromas and quality of the seasonings. At the same time, don't take this craft brew too seriously, it is the epitome of summer, after all. I would recommend pairing this with grilled chicken, maybe with a lemon marinade to further enhance the lemon hiding in the beer, and don't forget the herbs."
"Whoa, this is extreme brewing! Herbs galore, reminds me of the 13th Century Gruit Bier. Hops define a difference as it is very bracing on the palate, minty even. High carbonation, grainy malts and heavy hop load makes it a complex sipper that makes you think. Not sure I would want to drink this all the time, but it sure is a helluva ride while it lasts. Like drinking Granny Dewey's herb garden, fun, fun, fun!"
"get one if you can find it! we still have some in the store"
"Drinkability: I was pretty surprised and enthralled by this brew. I wasn't anticipating that it would be a mess, but with so much going on, I also didn't think it would come together this well. Sessionable, complex, delicious, and a fantastic experiment overall. I can't wait to try more if they all keep it up."
"*Note: This beer gave me a violent case of the hiccups. Crazy hiccups. I can't stop. Seriously. Old wives' tales are no match for these hiccups."
"D: Refreshing, although the spices are just slightly too aggressive."
"D - This is a good beer that I liked quite a bit easy to drink with its good taste worth finding to give it a try"
"D - Very unique flavor with the use of the herbs. Light bodied and an especially easy drinker. Highly sessionable."
"- a well crafted beer that just doesn't really fit my palate; can't really point any fingers, just maybe a tad astringent to me"
"D: Easy to drink but not for everybody."
"Pours a moderate gold color with a white head and some lacing. The nose really brings out a lot of herbs with the sage and rosemary being the most prominent. A bit of zesty citrus in there as well. The taste is pretty herb-forward as well with a bit of zest and spice. Feel is nice as the herbs present a good bitterness. Drinkability is a bit poor, as all the strong herbs are a bit much in the end."
"D: easy drinker, but I can see why others might not enjoy. Definitely tasty imo."
"Pours a five finger white head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Cloudy amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Slight sage nose. Flavor is sour citrus with a lingering sour/herb finish. $3.49 for a 12oz bottle from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, VT."
"Drinkable - oh so drinkability 4"
"D: If I were to make a hop salad and serve it with some sourdough bread, I think this about what it would taste like. A very unique treat."
"12oz. bottle served in my DFH goblet. Pours a hazy golden-orange with a half inch, loose, off-white head embedded with tiny pinpricks. Head eventually settles into a skim, with a dense dollop in the middle and slashes of lacing revealed during the tasting. Huge sage presence (reminiscent of the Russian Sage growing in my garden), as well as rosemary and a suggestion of citrus. Taste follows nose - extremely herbal and slightly bitter and acidic. Mouthfeel is light and lively with an acidity that lightly stimulates the salivary glands - finish is semi-dry. An interesting beer, but herbal qualities are a bit overpowering. A six ounce pour was more than sufficient. This beer is best split amongst two or three in my opinion."
"O - This is a wildly creative beer, and it's well worth trying at least once. I bought a few and I'm glad that I'll have a chance to try this in multiple situations."
"Drinkability - unique for the style, tasty"
"D: My final beer of the trilogy seemed to be much like the DFH version. For some reason the Victory was much different and inconsistent with the others. Overall a solid beer and a nice collaboration by the three breweries."
"Served from bottle into a Duvel tulip. Poured hazy golden yellow orange with a massive four finger head that came right to the brim of my tulip and settled down to two fingers very very slowly. The head also had a nice fluffy/pillowly appearance to it. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, subtle hop, banana, subtle oregano, and other spices. The flavor was of spices, bitter malt, slight hops, and subtle fruit. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall it takes a little bit for your palate to adjust to it, but once it does the flavors are very nice. The only downside is that it has too many flavors going on at once rather than having them come on individually from each other to keep changing my palate. It almost seems to explode. Sometimes shock-and-awe tactics work, but in the case of this brew it did not."
"M/D: Very herbal, as expected, and medium bodied. Was the last of the three I had and probably my middle choice. Its well done, but I wouldn't want more than one in a night."
"Saison du BUFF is interesting beer. It's also delicious and drinkable, especially given the rather unconventional ingredients. Here's hoping the Dogfish Head and Victory versions are at least this good. There's no reason to think they won't be."
"Overall this saison was heavy on the herbs but somehow the light malt profile made it work. Worth a shot."
"Had hight expectations for this one when I first heard about it and overall it doesn't dissapoint. The first thing you notice is the massive aroma that comes with this beer. Massive aroma of rosemary, sage and parsley and other spices, and there is a lot of funk going on here. The taste is citrussy, tangey and real spicy. Very complex and impressive. Not the most drinkable, largely because there is so much going on here. Definitely pick it up if you can find it."
"Overall, it's a fairly bitter and herbal beer, but it still seems to offer a pretty good amount of drinkability. Unless you let it warm, the herbaceous character is pretty much kept in check, and there's a solid bitterness there that helps to cut it short in the finish. I could easily see drinking two of these in one sitting, and yet there's still a good deal of complexity to it. Nicely done!"
"d- so great, i was blown away by this. i wish all saisons were this tasty, this is truly a one of a kind beer that i really hope that they will brew again. really wonderful."
"overall i am bowled over with this one. really a sublime beer that defines style. perfect beer for a perfect."
"Drinkability was the downfall with what to me was an overpowering pine or herb taste that just wasn't enjoyable. i wished i had ordered any other beer that i had already tried."
"There is a nice bright lemon note in the nose that doesn't quite translate to the flavor. It is interesting how much this smelled like it was aggressively hopped during my first few smells of the nose, especially when all this came from the herbs with a touch of yeast character thrown in."
"yeah this beer is magic. It goes down so smooth and is quite deliciousl It tastes like tree sap, honey, lemon, and chewed bubble gum with a mouth feel of tingly butterflies. Smells very citrusy with no hops really present. An amazing session beer if it wasnt five dollars a bottle. I would never buy it myself but nonetheless delicious."
"Very interesting but the spicing is way overdone and kills the drinkability."
"Overall, worth a try especially if you like the three breweries involved."
"Pours the expected hazy golden. Huge herbal scent and flavor. Nice mouthfeel, as one would expect from a saison. I think the rosemary note overwhelms what I hoped would be a slightly more crisp flavor. But I'm not disappointed, because you have to expect these breweries to push the brew in a new direction."
"A novelty saison, don't think I'd order/buy another."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Dogfish Head snifter. This beer pours a hazy golden with a big 4 inch white cap that leaves pretty significant lacing down the sides of the glass. The aroma is lemon rind, a little grass and a whole lot of herbal. The rosemary and the thyme are really prevalent. Massive herbal notes. The flavor is very similar. Its really herbal. Rosemary up front and thyme finishing on the back end. In the middle is lemon grass. Very herbal. Light on the hops, light on the malts but huge on the spice cabinet. The mouthfeel is a bit disappointing. It finishes really full and sweet. Saisons should finishes at least somewhat dry. This one should have fermented out just a little more. To me, this is a middle of the road Saison. Nothing spectacular."
"This is a collboration beer between Stone, Victory and Dogfish Head...Pours a hefeweizen-like cloudy, lemonade-ish color. Lightly carbonated and has a very short head. Good lacing...Aroma is heavily loaded with rosemary, but has a real Tuscan shape to it overall. Kind of like the spice that makes a good fricasse...Some citrusy notes in there too, keeping with the style. Not bad but I'm not a huge herbed beer guy...Flavor is very herbal. Lots of the Thyme, sage, rosemary notes but I'm not getting the parsley. Very good mouthfeel, and the carbonation is nice. Very bitter, in a bad way, on the finish. The herbal notes don't diminish at all. Well-priced at $2.99/12oz. bottle, though, so that brings the drinkability up. A light-bodied and crisp ale, but not really sessionable because the herbal notes are overpowering. They likely accomplished their goal with this, but it's not up my alley. Worth trying for its unique qualities and many of you might like it, particularly if paired with a Tuscan meal."
"Brewed wiht parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme - I had no idea what to expect going into this, but the savory herbs were wonderfully woven through the flavor profile. Rather than a novelty beer, this is something I could see rotating through my beer fridge on a regular basis. I'd love to have a bottle at Thanksgiving."
"A light bodied and well carbonated beer is refreshing. Lingers on the palate a little too long for my tastes for a saison, but is otherwise a good beer that's easy to drink and is nice on a warm evening like tonight."
"Overall- This was my favorite of the three different batches. I feel like Stone played with the herb addition timing more than the other breweries; this one was layered very nicely. A very interesting beer that if I revisit I will be doing under Stones interpretation."
"D- Amazing. Unlike any saison I've ever had. Find two and save one for later."
"D- This was a bit much for me, a bit rugged and not very quaffable, I suppose I like more str8 forward saison's."
"Final Verdict: While Victory looked and smelled better, I enjoyed the taste of DFH and while I would I would never turn either down, I would take DFH by a slim margin."
"D - Although it is a great idea, I don't feel that it really came together as nicely as Stone may have expected it to in this brew. I probably couldn't drink too many of these as the herb punch was a bit too much."
"D - This is a very interesting offering. It's worth picking up to try before it is gone."
"Tough to say about this brew. It definitely isn't like a lot of saisons out there and I don't think it is representative of the style however the innovation involved is impressive. This one definitely isn't for everyone but if you fancy yourself any kind of slight beer enthusiast, it is worth buying a bottle."
"More interesting than good - freedom from convention here supersedes respect for tradition. Best served with food, but otherwise avoided."
"Grabbed a bottle of this cause I'm a huge fan of all three breweries. This was quite a tasty beer, a unique Saison and one of the better collaborative brews that Stone's put out. It was a light yellow color with a big bubbled head that dissolved quickly - looked like it had some fizz to it. Flavor was nice and fruity, dominated by big herbal flavors of rosemary and possibly other. Not surprisingly there's a bit of Stone hoppiness, orange, some yeast and wheat in there. A very light and fizzy brew, sort of a combo between an imperial pilsener and a saison. Tasty and unique, with the herbs in there."
"Crisp & smooth throughout with good carbonation. Pretty easy to drink, but while the herbs make it unique, it also makes it something I couldn't drink too much of."
"Pours a luminous golden color with slight haze and white head. Nose has a very appetizing herbal quality with lemon creme. On the palate the herbal qualities dominate, and the sweetness I anticipated was not there. It was rather peppery too, with a good mouthfeel bite, and finished peppery as well."
"D: Nice on a hot day - refreshing. Bit odd overall, not sure if I could drink too much in a sitting. Warmed up a bit, and with the yeast it gets a good deal better and easier to drink."
"D: Pretty good."
"jd"
"A tasty and unique take on the style, but not something I could drink everyday. I remember the DFH version I had a few weeks ago as being a bit less bitter and more balanced, so I'll have to revisit it. A worthy brew, and I applaud them for the creativity."
"The second half of the bottle is very challenging to finish though..."
"Overall: I am exceptionally pleased with this beer, and can't wait to try it in bottle. Perhaps that will be on the menu this evening. If you see this beer, get it. It's limited, and is worth trying. And if you live within radius to Moe's, call to see if it's still on tap!"
"V8 is great, but not in a carbonated beverage."
"Drinkability: This one is tough. It's a good beer, just a bit too heavy on the spices. I'm glad I got a chance to try it as I love the beers that each of the three breweries make, but this one just goes overboard with a good thing. Worth a try, certainly, but there's no way I could have more than one of these in an evening."
"The herbs really come through in the mouth, particularly the rosemary and sage. Surprisingly bitter and instantly paralyzing to the tongue, but not in a bad way - I can't taste anything else. It's ok, though, because this is creative and enjoyable."
"What I come to expect from a saison is no where to be found here to help this. Its almost as if someone took carbonated water and added spices and hop juice to it. Great to smell and look at, but average everywhere else."
"Fairly drinkable, but more intense than other farmhouse ales I've quaffed. However, as a limited run beer, its drinkability doesn't matter much, because I doubt I'll ever find it again."
"Decent mouthfeel and drinkability. Interesting beer, but it doesn't quite come together. Too much of a mish-mash of spices."
"The beer pours a slightly hazy gold color with good head retention and lacing. The nose is impressive and spice filled, showing considerable honey, clove, sage and rosemary. While the flavor profile generally replicates the nose, on tap I found the spices to be a bit over the top. There just wasn't enough sweet honey and clove flavors to handle the amount of spice I encountered in this beer. Mouthfeel was medium bodied to full, with a long, moderately sweet, spice filled finish. Drinkability wasn't too bad, but again, the amount of spice in this beer really wore on me after a while. I just thought it a bit too prominent and dominant in this otherwise interesting, well made beer."
"Great Summer beer! Crisp and carbonated with lots of zest.The bubbly beer is what I call it. With lots of carbonation which is great on a hot day. I could definitely taste layers of herbs.Rosemary beginning followed by hints of parsley and thyme. Overall a nice beer to enjoy on a hot summer day!"
"DB- Yes this is sort of unbalanced. Yes it tastes like a spice rack. That is the point of the beer... With that in mind, I judge it to be that way and it does a pretty good job. It isn't offensive. The rosemary and thyme notes are fulfilling and fresh."
"A good summer beer, just not a fan of the style."
"D - A unique take on the Saison style... Friendly and inviting... Unique and worthy of a try, though I'm note sure I would ever indulge in this on a regular basis..."
"taste is somewhat tart, yeast, malt, a little sweetness in the back, grass, some crisp citrus, and spice."
"D: The tart-herbal combination is interesting but this is a pretty atypical saison."
"Absolutely... too bad it's a one-off."
"This collaborative beer is a nice Saison, very light and drinkable. Just not my style of beer that I enjoy."
"D - Very drinkable with alcohol at a reasonable % and quite interesting"
"I can also guarantee that this beer would pair so perfectly with a huge range of foods! I'm thinking herb lasagna, pesto, roast turkey, beef or chicken. Even hamburgers, fish and chips, chili or pizza would be an amazing accompaniment for this unique and exciting beer. I am very excited to see what the next two versions will produce!"
"Drinkability is high. I think I could drink this all night and not get palate fatigue from the herbs. Done very nicely. Worth replicating at home, since I have a nice supply of fresh rosemary in the garden."
"Thoughts: The brewmasters all did a great job on this. I love all the flavors and their balance is incredible."
"Big up to Axic10 on this one. Pours golden wheat color with a billowing rocky white head and a little lacing left around the glass. The aroma is pretty wild with definite notes of rosemary and sage, as well as nice wafty yeasty notes. Flavor is well, what you would expect very herbacious, peppery, and a good bit hoppy for a saison. Not too much yeast driven flavor hear, well on second try there is a little. It is dry however which is nice. For what it is it drinks well. Very glad to have tried this beer. I think I will revisit this one before summer is out, on a hot as day with thai food."
"Drinkability:This beer pushes the limit of spices that are included in a saison. With all of these spices, I bet this would be a great beer to make beer can chicken with."
"**If you don't like rosemary, this is not for you.**"
"D - This is a very cool beer unlike anything Ive had. I couldn't have more then one or two not because of the taste but because you would be unable to appreciate it after one or two. I would like to see this become a seasonal beer. I picked a few bottles of the Dogfish Head and the Stone versions, I have yet to come by the Victory but will pick up if I see it."
"While I really enjoyed this and all it's interesting and different tastes, 12oz is just enough for me. Could never have more than one, but it is good enough that you need a whole 12 oz to completely enjoy/appreciated this beer. Good collaboration, but let's not start mass producing this gents..."
"Simply an A+ on all counts. The taste rolls on for ages and this scent will haunt me until... tomorrow when I get more. This is not your grandfather's Saison. As far as improving on Dupont I have no comment, but this is an incredible concoction that I could not ask more from. Good work, boys."
"D- saison to me is a strange style with all its odd characteristics and i think i would like it much more if the hops weren't so acrid and astringent. the herbal additions are cool but also novelty and i would probably give a no thanks if another one were offered to me. better to give it to someone who hasn't yet had a chance to try this rare, however ridiculous, offering."
"Bottle: Poured a dark golden color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma consists of primarily sage with a sweet malt base with candy-like feature which surprisingly works well together. Taste is also a very unique mix between a sweet malt base with candy and soap notes and a distinctive sage finish with other spices also coming through. Body is quite light for style but seems perfect in this case as it makes this a very refreshing drink. A lot better then I had anticipated and something I would seek again for sure."
"D: OMG, I could drink this every day and night for the rest of my life. A truly wonderful brew. My hats off to the three amigos that crafted ;this fine concoction."
"Poured a clear golden amber with an over the top fluffy white head, carbonation galore. Lots of sticky lacing. Aromas of grassy hops, herbs and malt. On the palette is where this Saison shines, with as plethora of spices, pine, cloves, coriander, sage, lemon zest, and pepper predominate. Medium bodied with tons of carbonation. A true trifecta, well done! Two thumbs up."
"D: Didn't really know what to expect with this, but it turned out alright. Probably could have used a little less spice though as I found it a little hard to finish just one bottle. Glad to try but not sure I'd drink again"
"Really really like this. Beautiful but discrete bottle with a beautiful beer inside. Really happy I wasn't disappointed. Makes me want to try and brew something similar. Would buy this again and would love to try to try more beers with these type of herbs added. Thanks and kudos to all 3 breweries."
"D - Really nice, though it still feels like a gimicky saison. Would I drink it again? Sure. This beer has alot going for it, definately unique and worth checking out."
"D: A little to minty and grassy to drink much of. Happily split this bottle - could probably drink a whole one but not much more. Interesting beer and I wouldn't expect less with Dogfish involved."
"D: An interesting beer. The relatively odd flavors advertised on the bottle show through, but remain subtle, allowing this to still be an enjoyable beer."
"Finger plus of frothy white, mixture of all bubble sizes, loose enough to dissipate quickly, little, if any, lacing. Hazy light gold to darker yellow in color, although not the clearest liquid lots of bubbles floating upwards within. Orange blossom and cinnamon catch first in the nose but it's just a second before the noted herbs take over, white grapefruit too, yeasty but not soft nor leesy, witch-hazel, nothing here overly malty, leafiness predominates, extremely long presence with a full, pungent lift. Medium-bodied, nicely balance with same amount of fullness from start to finish. The herbs once more dominate and there is a clear, strong note of basil as well. Nothing crazy about the carbonation level but it does add to the total cleanliness factor. The tangerine to pink and white grapefruit lend a sweet and sour juiciness. Slight yeast to baker's dough element. Much more savory ending and aftertaste, good deal of retronasal activity. Hard to imagine an oddball one-off succeeding much better than this."
"drinkability: good"
"D- Very easy to drink one bottle, however by the end of my glass I remember feeling as if I had just ate a salad of herbs and didn't feel like having anymore... Maybe just me but I felt that this beer was just over the top..."
"M/D: Light to medium bodied, carbonation slightly prickly. Very drinkable for me, wasting away in a hot house with no AC, very refreshing. This wouldn't make my saison short list, but it's certainly a good beer."
"D - I plan to try all three just for comparison's sake, but I wouldn't keep this in stock due to the nature of the herbs."
"This is an interesting saison to put it mildly, but from these brewers, anything too traditional would be disappointing. Well done, will try to pick up at least one from each brewery."
"Really interesting, but for me, more of a novelty, it's well executed for what it is, but not really practical for me to drink on any regular basis- I wouldn't even want a whole bottle necessarily. Another solid collab though."
"Drinkability: A very interesting brew, but the aftertaste is too medicinal and leaves it lacking compared to the other versions of this beer"
"4/4/3/4/4"
"Drinkabilty is fair - I'm thinking it would go nicely with a meaty fish, or perhaps a nicely grilled chicken."
"I appreciate what the collaboration did here in trying to push the envelope. Its an interesting and good beer, but a bit too herbal which overwhelms what is probably a good saison under there."
"This was an interesting beer that's packed with aroma and flavor. It reminds me of a gruit more than a saison."
"Saison is not a style I'm very familiar with. This beer is exceptionally herbal in aroma and taste. The rosemary, sage, and parsley it was brewed with help explain that; but the hops are the outstanding herb and very nice. The mouthfeel is light, but resinous, which I appreciate. The color is light, hazy yellow--it's a visually attractive beer. Along with the herbal, piney hopes, the defining character, for me, is what I'd call ""Belgian funk."" This might not have been the obvious choice of style for Stone and Dogfish to brew together, but, by my lights, it is a creative and well-crafted beer. Well done!"
"Drinkability: This is the third time I've had this beer, and while it's not great or the style, it is very enjoyable/drinkable. I'll probably pick up another bottle if/when I see it. Recommended."
"Notes: this beer is a nice change of pace, I have had it a few times, and it makes a wonderful marinade for chicken."
"Super herbal saisons, or any styles really, are always very hit (ie Rabbid Rabbit) or miss (ie Great Lakes Grassroots) with me. Surprisingly this one is neither. I don't love it, but I don't hate it either. It falls pretty much in the middle. It's pretty good, although not something I would drink with any regularity. An interesting beer."
"A very nice saison from these guys."
"Nice golden color. Tons of carb bubbles kicking off the bottom give this one a lively look. Big frothy, sticky white head is the clincher for this one looking great. Smell starts off surprisingly fruity, some orange peal apricot. Smell quickly moves to spicy, coriander being the highlight. Pepper, sage and a full complement of others kick in to give this one incredible complexity. Taste matches the smell in complexity. This is one of the best saison's I've ever had. As good as expected from this all star team of brewing. Thanks for hooking me up cisco."
"Pours a very light orange yellow color with a huge 3 finger head. Unmistakenly clear with a golden yellow apple color. The lacing is ridiculous on this thing too. Aroma is great. I really get a spicy sage aroma on this one. Basil, thyme, parsley on the backend. A sweetness from the herbal notes really plays perfect with this one. Really a perfect nose. Taste is spot on too. Really has that nice spicy floral herbal thing going on here. Full bodied saison with a nice oily back note to give this body. Mouthfeel falls a bit short as the carbonation is lacking a bit. Herbal oils take away from the crispness of this slightly. Drinkability is high. Very delicious and does wonders with food. Wish this came in larger format bottles for sharing."
"D - I could definitely put down a few of these. The abv is non-existent as you drink it. Kind of regret only buying one. At least its easy to get here."
"Drinks: like a salad. It was light, crisp, refreshing, and would be the perfect pre-dinner beverage. I found this incredibly easy-drinking, though the subtleties of flavor are diminished when paired with food. Best to enjoy this one all on its own."
"D: This is such an interesting experience. Full of interesting spices, but they don't detract from the brew. Seems like with ever sip the flavor changes. This would be great to pair with some aged gouda."
"Purchased a bottle for $4 at BWX in Downtown Crossing. Served in a tulip style glass. Hazy yellow colored body. Excellent sized white head that remained intact for some time, plus some good lacing. Smell is where you first start to notice the herbs. It's like sticking your nose in a garden. Unusual, and I kind of like it. Taste was not as overpowering as the smell may suggest. All of the flavor profiles of a well built saison were there, including hay and fresh bread. The herbs were pronounced on the palate but added to the unique flavor of this beer. Mouthfeel for this beer was also quite good, as it had the tart crispness of a farmhouse ale. Drinkability may not be off the charts due to its interesting flavor, but it was tasty and refreshing. I can see how some people may not like this beer. But, I enjoyed it. Must be nice paired with an herb salad."
"Simon & Garfunkel would be so proud (or so litigious...whichever...). It pours an almost clear, somewhat hazy golden straw topped by a more-than-healthy couple fingers of white froth. The nose comprises a dichotomous mixture of wheat and citrus assaulted by a a horde of window-box garden spices (must be the S&G ""Canticle"" spices). The spices return to dominate the tongue as well, providing more than enough garnish for the dish, both literally and figuratively. Some citrus flies in behind them, but this is quickly quashed by a strong earthy/spicy collaboration. Still, though, the herbs/spices maintain their iron-clad grip on the situation. This is the first time I've experienced a sammich's filling be completely o'ershadowed by the bread. Honestly, I think I find it a bit too much. The body is pretty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, I gotta say I am underwhelmed by this brew. Brewing with the window-box greens is fine, but I don't think they should dizzominate the proceedings like they do here."
"D: The herbs make this beer very undrinkable to me."
"I don't know how these three breweries were ableto work together, with that much talent in the room. I have to say they were successful in bringing the best of each of them into one very tasty saison."
"Starts off odd, as from the appearance and aroma I'm left expecting an IPA. Aroma is very crisp and fresh, dominated by herbal and floral notes with mild citric hops and slight medicinal pinch. Appearance is a clear golden amber color with a massive foamy and rocky white head that leaves billowy patches of lace and a persistent thick layer of film and bubbles with a large foamy splotch in the middle. Given the description of ingredients for this beer, the flavor isn't very surprising, but certainly isn't a let down as this is very unique; but is it any good? Front of the palate is gripped by a citric, almost DIPA like flavor, though not remotely bitter. Moving back the palate a unique, musty earthiness dominated by herbal and floral flavors. Body is medium thick, mildly creamy, with strong fine carbonation that tries to clean up some of the sweet and herbal mess of the body. Very little about this beer makes me think of a saison, and I'm usually not crazy about herbal and medicinal flavors, but I'm strangely enjoying this beer. The only thing detracting from the drinkability of this is the long lingering dry aftertaste that is dominated by sage and other earthy spices. As with all the Stone collabs, an interesting beer, but not one I'm necessarily motivated to revisit."
"Not a lot of traditional saison character but that clearly wasn't the point. Had a nice balance of herbs, tart/bitterness, and funk. Unique and delicious."
"Successful experiment. I don't think I would want more than one in a night, but I would buy it again, if it was available in my area."
"All that said, ultimately this is one of many beers that hits really high notes (great feel, really worthwhile aromas and flavors) but also messes up a few times (this soapiness is overboard, and the really busy aromas and flavors ruinously clash from time to time)."
"Pours a hazy yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, sage stands out and other spices are in there too. In the taste, spicy, yeasty, and a small tartness. A spicy bite and a small to medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry spicy, and small tart aftertaste. Nice spiciness, like the small tart and different spices used."
"D: An unparalleled saison in terms of stretching your imagination. But the drinkability is average only. Points given for creativity, points taken for creativity. Some hits and misses, all within this one brew."
"Sure, this beer is innovative (although Right Brain Brewery did a better version last year) but the flavors just don't mesh too well. The rosemary, sage and thyme are nice, but I swear the parsley (which dominates with grassy chlorophyll) was just thrown in to match the Simon and Garfunkel song. And, while I generally love saisons, the slight sourness makes everything even more confusing. While this is appealing from a novelty perspective, palate fatigue sets in about halfway through one beer."
"D- I had to try it, I'm glad I did, and I'm glad this one was priced reasonably..."
"Saison Du Buff really impressed me. Oftentimes these Stone collaboration brews are hit or miss (much like the weirder Dogfish stuff) but this is one of the better things to come out of the Lab in a while. Blame Victory's calming influence if you like, but this is a winner. Highly recommended - a delightfully fun take on a classic Belgian style."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonation is on the higher side. Drinkability is OK, the herbs were definitely interesting and made for a very unique beer but I'm not sure it's a flavor I'd want often in a beer. Cool beer that was definitely worth trying though."
"D- Easy to drink and enjoyable. I have been looking for this since I first read about it, and I have finally found it on the east coast. A little disappointing for being a collaboration between, Stone, DFH, and Victory, but still good beer and worth the price if you can find it."
"Pours a hazy golden with a medium white head. Smells of freshly squeezed lemon, and phenolic yeast. Taste is light bread like malt up front, with a very spicy herbal lemon middle and finish. Quite a bit of bitterness here the clings to your toungue. Mouthfeel is good, slightly high carbonation. Very good beer, other than the fact that the intense spicyness limits drikability a bit. I would get this again though."
"Overall, one of the better I have had to date. I love the fruity addition not commonly as prominent in others- mostly due to the herbs brewed with this, I assume. Also, the phenols present are a bit different than you find in Hennepin or DuPont... Would love to buy again, albeit a tad pricey"
"D: It's a pretty hot day here in Portland, and this was crazy satisfying. Had two bottles while I roasted some lamb doused in olive oil and sea salt."
"D: Very enjoyable, tart, crisp and vanishes off the tongue quickly with very good results. A surefire summer time quencher that comes highly recommended per style. Case worthy."
"Drinkability is great, i'd drink a lot of these. Fantastic beer."
"Overall everything i expected from a collaboration of brewers of this caliber. Highly recommend it to everyone. the smell alone is worth buying this beer."
"I'll be looking for more of this on my next trip to the beer store."
"D: I wasn't expecting much looking at the ingredients of this beer, but I'm surprised how well they actually worked! Very unique and interesting flavor. Like chewing mint bubblegum you dropped in a muddy herb garden. Glad I tried it."
"Pours a beautiful hazy golden color with a frothy eggshell head that retains impressively and leaves nice lacing. The aroma has some fresh hay and bread dough upfront, along with white pepper, floral hops, spices (thyme, rosemary, parsley), a little honey and mineral. The flavor is similar to the aroma with biscuit and hay initially, along with some white pepper, spicy hops, rosemary, sage, cardamom, a little honey, some fruity esters and a little alcohol. The mouthfeel is light but not watery, and drinkability is good but a little limited by the prevalence of spices. An interesting saison here, definitely heavier on the spices that most examples I've tried."
"I was first drawn to this brew when I noticed who had collaborated on it. The herbs really are the main feature of this beer. They take over the taste of this brew and deliver something so unique to your palette. Nice head for this one and it sticks around for quite a while. Aroma is spicy and matches the flavor of this beer perfectly. As my first saison I have to admit I'm very impressed and I'll be looking for a few of these to stock my fridge when i can."
"D-This is one heck of an interesting beer. It's hands down the best saison I've had to date. This isn't a terribly easy to drink beer though as I fee like after one or two of these you'd get some hardcore palate fatigue from the herbs."
"Either way, I am not getting quite the malt flavor or the levity I expect in a saison. A little disappointing. I will drink the beer and appreciate the novelty but probably not pick this one up again. If only it had lived up to the smell!"
"d: Its been a long time since a beer caught me completely off guard. What an outstanding collaboration!"
"in any case, big points for creativity!"
"The first thing that hits you is the amazing aroma of the hops when you pour it. This beer has a wonderful complex hoppiness and light mouthfeel. There are also some sweet fruit flavors on the backend. All round great beer. I don't think this is a beer you would be drinking a lot of, but it is certainly enjoyable with or with out food."
"D - Definitely a great experience. Not something to be over consumed, but as a drink alone its a great overall taste and texture, and refreshing on top of that."
"D - I like spice in my beer. I also love saison beers. This beer is a combination of two things that I love which only proves that, sometimes too much of a good thing actually can be too much. I DO think it's good but I also think the spiciness is a bit harsh and could use a little less bitterness on the finish as well."
"D- This was a interesting beer to say the least. the aroma and appearance was better than the overall flavor. The rosemary in this beer was a little too much for me moreso after the beer itself warms up. Would love to try this again."
" D- The nice saison with strong American hops has an interesting herbal twist with mint and rosemary that is not over the top but.... interesting."
"The body is light and carbonation is spot on. Overall this is just unfortunately not a good beer."
"D - A mind-blowing beer. That's all I have to say."
"Drinkability: This is a superb beer and probably the best Saison I have had. I hesitated a little to buy this beer at first, but I am very glad I ended up purchasing it. If you haven't already tried this beer, you definitely should- strongly recommended!"
"D: I don't know that this wins me over from the traditional farmhouse saisons, but I certainly applaud the effort to push the boundaries and try something new. This is my second bottle and I'm bound to get a couple more and (since they're bottle-conditioned) keep at least one for a while to see what develops. A 'try' recommendation is an easy call..."
"D-it's a unique offering but not as crazy or intense as the description says; the flavorings blend well and nothing is too overpowering; a bit gimmicky? perhaps, but it's worth a try."
"Mouthfeel is light, airy, and good. Solid, drinkable beer."
"D - quite a tasty treat."
"This one is a hit, to me. If the next BUFF collab is even half as good as this one, I'll buy it. This one is great, and if you can find it, buy it. Well worth the 3.99 per 12 ounce that I paid."
"Drinkability - This is a one-off beer and you'll most likely never get a chance to taste anything like it again to get it while you can."
"What I find incredible about this beer is that its use of herbs is right on target, making a statement without going overboard. It begs many questions for tweaking. I hope see more collaborations like this in the future!"
"d - An interesting saison that makes it very clear it was brewed with a lot of different spices. Glad I tried it and different, but a little too much spice in the taste for me; would have liked more going on. Wouldn't seek out again."
"I was really excited to hear about this collaboration between Stone, Victory, and DFH. That's three world class operations. The end result is a good Saison. It's rather aggressive with the spices and herbs, but it never seems to go over the top. Not for me anyway. Fortunately, it doesn't have a vegetal flavor in the mix. Overall, I'm impressed. Unless you're averse to spicy/herbal Saisons, check this one out."
"Clear gold with a dense white cap, about a half inch after the pour. Clumpy lacing, good head retention. Citrus and fruit aroma, lots of oranges and grapefruit, pineapple, powdery, peppery, a little bready with mild cloves and alcohol. The flavour is cleaner than the aroma, but a little less intriguing for it. The same character is present - citrus and tropical fruit, crackery malt, light spiciness - just a little more subdued. Lingering fruit. Mild warmth as it goes down. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation, dry, a little creamy, nice texture overall. I liked this quite a bit. I'll probably (hopefully) grab a couple more before they're gone."
"Pours a pale straw-yellow with a nice white head. Good retention and some lacing. The smell is a huge mix of different herbs. I get rosemary and maybe some thyme and pepper. Taste is really strong on the spicing, maybe a bit too much so. Lots of herbal flavour to go with some earthy hop bitterness. Carbonation is spot on. I think the over spicing of this is a bit to its detriment, but still a fine beer."
"D: Immensely refreshing and goes down far too easy, I could go through a few pints of this in an afternoon without even blinking."
"I use seasoning blend for duck confit (sage, salts, thyme, rosemary and garlic,) this beer would be perfect."
"D: A flat out 5.0 drinkability. Complex and flavorful, yet refreshing and quaffable. Alcohol is not apparent."
"The palate opens with a blend of rosemary and thyme with a mild hop bitterness. A flavor akin to wet grass takes over, a little unpleasant even, this really is an herb bomb. For the profile, they could have used practically any other yeast, the saison character is just whelmed here. Sweetness is (thankfully) low, there's a little honey present. Somewhere in there, there's some ripe orange. Drying and bitter on the finish, there's a fair hop character too. Carbonation is high, making this crisp on the palate. Despite the flavors, this is just a touch watery too. Very herbal. Interesting, unique, but not something I'm interested in revisiting. My 12oz bottle did not prove to be a bother at all."
"Cheers to Stone, DFH & Victory for this great Collab Brew!"
"I got this beer as a 4th of July present. It pours a hazy yellow with a fizzy white head. Lots of herbs on the nose, sage, with bit of funk. The herbs blend with some lemon and make an interesting taste. After the initial sip the herbs take a back seat to a pleasant grassiness. It is very light and highly carbonated. An interesting brew, very glad I got to try it."
"Drinkability is also hurt as a result of the lack of balance. A shame really, as good examples of the style are one of the best examples of combining drinkability and complexity. This one has some complexity, little subtlety, and average drinkability at best."
"D- this fit nicely as something to sip on a very hot day after cutting the grass- the tart notes would take the edge off the heat. Outside of that, I'd rather have an IPA."
"ETA: Not that it matters, but the artwork on the label leaves much to be desired. Which is surprising as Dogfish Head, Stone, and Victory's labels are usually topnotch."
"I had moderately high hopes for this one but it seems to be another collaboration that is less than the sum of its parts. The good ones continue to be few and far between."
"Drinkability: Really interesting take on the saison style, I can't wait to see how the other two versions compare."
"O: Not my cup of tea at all- I tried it because it was a one-off collaboration. Seems to be a pretty good beer for the style; it's like eating cardamoms to me though. So not something I'd buy again."
"Delicious, complex and very session-able. Not exactly something you'd want to start your night with if you were thinking of trying some lighter fare as there's a lot going on there...but still: very approachable. Many of my non-beer-drinker friends really really enjoyed this one. Good job, you triumvirate, you! Can't wait to see how you fine tune the next one!"
"D: This one won't appeal to everyone, but I think it's a drinkable beer."
"Taste and mouth are a little heavier than expected. The finish lingers and isn't bad. For a saison this is to hoppy. I think with some age this will do much better."
"Are you brewing of Scarborough Fair?, parsley sage rosemary and thyme. Who would think of something this out there? Probably Sam Cologne, none the less it is quite refreshing. It pours pale with a thick foamy head. Smells like ground up herbs. Tastes quite strongly of mint and hops. I have never encountered anything else like it that is beer. feels sudsy and bubbly to the tongue. Very Very drinkable, I hope dogfish and stone get together again at some point, preferably on a russian imperial stout"
"D-Quite good. I am enjoying this in the heat of the summer. Very thirst quenching. Hope to find some more of it. Again, not strictly traditional, but a solid brew."
"D: This was a very interesting novelty beer, but it wasn't something I would drink more than once. It hid the alcohol well, so it wasn't difficult to drink, but it was better to sip given all the unique flavors. A fun experiment that I could appreciate, even if it didn't yield the most delicious results."
"Bottle at Cole's, Mike's private collection. Great lace on light body. The aromas are a delightful, funky and fresh. More complex as I drink it, and that has to be done sip by sip. The herbs lead to a soup of tastes, still lemony and bitter, with white paper and the rosmary and sage. Above average mouthfeel and approachable by averge"
"A good idea on paper, I like the concept. THat said I feel like there is just a bit too much going on in this beer. It is too busy and kinda messy. I am glad I got to try this collaboration from 3 of my favorite brewers."
"Perfect golden pour with a foamy white head. Lots of hops and citrus in the nose, atypical for the style but very mouthwatering. Tangerine, pineapple and peaches dominate the taste which come with a grassy hoppy aftertaste and citrusy bitterness. Wow, a great tasting and unique brew. Comes out like a marriage between an American IPA and a saison. This brew is a treat and must be sought out immediately."
"this was good, and very interesting, but insanely spicy so one at a time...."
"D- This is a winner for me. I am big fan of all three breweries and was nervous when I heard the style/ingredients. For a one-off(or three-off by the time they are finished), I was not let down. I think people may have expected a monster hop-bomb from these heavy-hopped hands, but I was surprised when it was a beer outside their comfort zones. I would not say this is a must, but if you enjoy a change-up give this a shot while it is around."
"D - pretty easy drinking like many of the brews in this style. A unique brew for sure. The spices used in this are readily noticeable in the taste and smell. I enjoyed this one and will need to pick this one up again before it disappears."
"The mouthfeel is light and airy. Perfectly carbonated and well done for the summer season. Consequently, it is highly drinkable."
"I feel like I can taste each brewery contribution in this beer. From Victory's golden monkey, and Dogfish Heads midas touch, to Stones your not worthy bitterness from some great hoppedness. perfect for this summer. If you can get some I highly recommend it."
"Wonderfully complex and superbly drinkable, with the bone-dry finish practically screaming for more. I had no real idea what to expect going into this beer; being brewed by some of the biggest names in American craft brewing, it seemed like it could go one of two ways: overly-hyped, too commercial and overall lackluster, or spectacularly brilliant, and it seems that these guys pulled it off and created a well-crafted and amazingly delicious brew."
"D- This is a decent Saison overall-a very good dry summer beer. I would like to taste a little more funk/yeast and a lot less Euro malt-which IMO kinda kills the mood. Good overall and worth a try."
"D: This one says its deliciously herbacious on the back... and its definitely herbacious... too bad most of the herb is covered by the lemon and actually ends up being rather chalky and unpleasant. Fruitiness is appreciated though. An very pretty beer to say the least the the finish and aftertaste are too aggressive on the palate. Worth a try since its definitely an interesting beer. But not my cup of tea."
"pours cloudy golden with a light fluffy head, looks really good! Aroma is spicy/floral with a hint of herbs. Taste is powerful, lightly bitter/hoppy with spicy, grassy, herbal perfume notes. Medium bodied. moderately bitter aftertaste that is also herbal."
"mobile review"
"D) A well crafted brew. I'd definitely have another."
"Certainly timed correctly for summer. This is a refreshing/complex beer and one I enjoyed quite a bit."
"All in all, I like this brew. It's a lot different from the Kona coffee porter I like, obviously, but it's still very good as that one is. This to me is a good example of a saison. I'd say hunt this down once just to try if you cannot get it in your area."
"12oz bottle into a DFH Signature glass pours a crisp bubbly orange with a nice frothy eggshell head that is slow to diminish and leaves great lacing on the glass. Aroma is a nice amount of spices with lemon zest in the front with some pepper and rosemary present as well, there is also a nice amount of sweet malts as well. The taste is a nice amount of sweet fruits and lemon citrus with a nice hop backbone that leaves a slightly bitter finish. The beer is quite light, smooth and refreshing, just about perfect for the style. This is a very enjoyable Saison, certainly a worthy collaboration brew."
"D - As I said before, it starts alright, but continues to go down hill and gets all Simon and Garfunky... (get it)... anyway, overall the drinkability takes a big hit in my book as the flavors just become more muddy as it warms and as I make my way through the glass. I wouldn't go for a second in one sitting. But all said, defiantly worth trying (though the price makes going for a second try less appealing)."
"Really interesting. Definitely something I need to be in the mood for, but I was and it was great."
"D: It's solid. Would be great to have with a meal for sure. On its own, can only drink maybe one or two. Great beer, under the right conditions. Definitely try it."
"A saison well done. I'm glad to see that I liked this one."
"However the taste was awesome. Hops with herb blended citrus makes this a Saison i could see always wanting if it wasn't so limited. The spiced herbs hit the pallet first with a large hop punch leaving a after taste of rosemary, citrus and hops."
"compliments to the Chefs."
"Overall, this is a unique take on the style, and pretty tasty. Definitely worth a try."
"I like the experimentation, but this one for me, was a miss. For the price, I'm glad I got a chance to try it. $3.69 I think."
"Overall: If you've never had a 'spice, herb, or vegetable' beer this is a very good place to start. The beer nicely demonstrates that herbs normally thought of solely for cooking, can be successfully applied in brewing. The hop bitterness and flavor are surprisingly high considering they're not recognizable in the aroma. In fact I wouldn't mind if the hops were backed off a little to Ellet the spices come through even more."
"What can I say? It's what you might expect from such a collaboration: a very unique beer tasting experience. The aromas are fantastic it was just a little too salty in places to make me really want another one. This is something that must be tried."
"Drinkability - Despite the bitterness i am very intrigued with the citrus taste and want more of it."
"Overall, this is not what I would call a saison. I really loved this beer regardless, but I do think it should be re-labeled. A great brew from three of my stand-by breweries. If it were a seasonal or year-round, and a bit cheaper too, I would buy this much more than once."
"d: Although I really enjoy this beer I doubt I would be able to drink more than 1 or 2 of these in a sitting."
"Drinkability - This is definitely something I can have a couple of (bought in a single bottle.) It's not a good beer for someone that doesn't enjoy a lot of flavor or is just looking for a straight up unfiltered beer. The undertones of spice are very noticeable."
"I do have to say the high price is a turn off on all these ""special"" beers that have been coming out lately. Its almost enough to chase someone to drink hard liquor..."
"This is increcibly drinkable. I know this is probably atypical of Saisons, but this is my favorite Saison to date. It goes down easy. Everything meshes. Waaay refreshing. Perfect for a hot summer night."
"Poured this into a tulip. Not as much head on this straw colored beer as I though there would be. About a fingers worth of head and decent lacing. Smells great. just like a fresh herb garden. The thyme is really what shines through the nose along with citrus and a bit of a spicy kick. I don't really taste the herbs as much as I thought I would but this hopped up saison hits the pallet nicely. Fresh hops and spices all across my tongue. The carbonation takes away a bit on the mouth feel for me. I guess I would like a little less but this light bodied beer is a great summer time treat. This drinks easy, especially due to the great flavor and aromas."
"D: I grabbed a bottle in New York for $9. Then I saw in in MA for $3.99. That should never happen. As for the beer it was nice but even at $4 these Stone collaboration beers are a one and done. Nice beer though. Just not worth $24 a six pack."
"An excellent collaboration beer between all three breweries. It showcases the strengths of each brewery and I believe it's the first time I've seen a DFH/Stone collaboration as well. Both breweries are known for pushing the limits of beer and combined with Victory, certainly push the saison style to something with more character."
"Maybe my favorite collaboration yet, looking forward to the next one. Stone keeps pushing boundaries, sometimes it works and sometimes it's weird."
"Overall a really unique Belgian-style beer. With saison being kind of a catch-all interpretive style, this one stands apart from many Belgian inspired beers. This would be a good one to pair with spicy food or a vegetable course."
"D - Just don't really like this enough to call it very drinkable."
"12oz bottle. First of all no way is this a saison. Its more like a terrible collaboration where each brewery took one of their beers and they just mixed them together....Gold with a light tan head, nothing in appearance of note...This goes downhill in the aroma, super herbal, horrendous spice, almost smells like a cactus or aloe lotion. Taste sucks equally, all oily sticky aloe cactus. Might was well cut open a cactus and suck it. Feel is ok, but if you can drink a whole bottle of this sober, you're quite a person."
"Very drinkable, filling, but refreshing."
"D - The saison hit its mark IMO, a very drinkable beer with lots of herbal flavor, yet this would not be something your average saison would be turned off by. I recommend it as it was pretty easy to quaff and overall well-balanced."
"I prefer beer with more body, but The light sparkly feel of Saison Du BUFF, coupled with the subtle natural flavor, make it a refreshing hot weather beer."
"D - Didn't come into this with extremely high expectations, but I am very pleasantly surprised. Love the saison style in general and the fairly unique herbal flavors in here add some nice complexity and interesting overall effect. Like the cool feeling, spicy and grassy flavors. Glad I grabbed a few of these."
"Bottom line, with a juicy Margaharita pizza on a hot summer day, fantastic beer. I think you just have to be in the right mood/place for it though. As a stand-alone on any given night, definitely wouldn't qualify as a go-to. Props for what they did here though. B+"
"woah! weird beer, but i guess they meant to create something avant guarde... it's hard to rate because for a saison, it is completely out of the box. interesting. kind of awesome. not what i was expecting. of course. burnt gold with an off-white head that holds well and leaves tons of lace. very pretty. earth (dirt) and herbs hit me first in the nose, followed by lots of lemony, grapefruity, orangey hops that are boosted by a sweet malt, and maybe some salt and pepper in the background. taste is bitter sweet herb hop with a bitter finish that sings with pepper and lemon basil. like drinking a sweet, hoppy ipa in the garden and a little dirt and some of your cooking herbs got in the glass. well-balanced though and ti seems to kind of work. here's where it gets tough to review... mouthfeel. i like my saisons much, much, much more well-attenuated. i want them dry and crisp (it does come off pretty dry in the end, but there is sweet all over the place in this beer and the slickness of the mouthfeel is easy to misperceive as sweetness or fullness), and i want the herbs and spices (if there are any) to be subtle and mysterious. not muddy... mysterious (think fantome). the psr&t do play with the other ingredients in du buff, and they do help to amplify the desirable flavors, so this is kind of cool, they just stand out a little too much in their own little corner. mouthfeel is a little too full for me and carbonation is too low, although i guess the really old saisons were more lightly carbonated, so who knows?... easy to drink. lots of fun food pairing options here. old-school saisons are in and hopped up belgian style beers are cliche. come on guys! what happened to being ahead of the curve?"
"Stone's most complex offering to date. will be interesting to compare to the same brew created at DFH and Victory"
"D - Not my favorite saison, but a fun one to try. I love the concept of these collaborations, but usually I find that the sum of the parts isn't as good as the parts themselves...seems more like a marketing and community thing than about making a great drinkable beer. Not something that you'd drink a few of, but more of something that you'd want to just give a shot to."
"(D)- An interesting take on the style with the addition of all the spices. Reminds me more of an IPA than a Saison however. Still, its good, but not really fitting the style in my opinion. Yes it has the spice, but not the funk or bigger fruits."
"Damn this is one hoppy beer. It is an excellent taster but I don't think I could enjoy anymore than a couple on a hot summer day."
"D - one of the most unique beers ive ever had. drinkability takes a hit because of the at times overwhelming herbal flavors, but this isnt a bad beer. would be paired nicely with a myriad of food, from spicy thai to fresh salads."
"D- Easy to drink. A little spicy/hoppy, but nice."
"Kudos to BUFF! They have realized their mission of freedom of flavors and made a song into a beer. I would go back to Scarborough Fair and would hope that it was being served on tap."
"I'd try it again after some bottle aging, which I may have to do once I buy a second one, but I wouldn't really order this again just because of the very un-beer taste of it."
"Taste is as good as the nose, very interesting, the finish is all spices. Really something totally different and it's hard to explain but a great job from the guys at stone, victory and dfh! Keep um coming!"
"D: The booziness isn't very strong, hidden well behind the wall of flavor. I am very impressed with the reckless abandon of the ale."
"D - Because of the extreme spice notes it has to be drank a bit slow. But overall - I am blown away."
"Mouthfeel is dry and too spicy. Also makes for a not incredibly drinkable beer. This is a sipper and one's enough for me."
"D- pretty easy to drink, would be a great one to pair with something like lemon chicken"
"D: Having a hard time with this one. Being in the culinary field, it's hard for me to not love the flavors going on here. I am just having a hard time with the intensity of each herb. Could see this working well as a soup base or stew beer. Herbs are just a bit too strong to make this enjoyable every sip."
"D-the spice is insane in this and lingers for quite some time. it is actually a little weird and I just don't think it works for me."
"There's too much going on in this beer. I don't like those spices in beer. It got a little better as it warmed up but I still wouldn't buy this again. Carb and stuff was good but I hate beers with too much spices and Sage should never be on food."
"I think I'm gonna go pop a frozen pizza into the oven, cause this really makes me wanna have beer and pizza. The more I drink it, the more pepper I get in the aroma. This is a pretty tasty brew here. I'm totally surprised by this one, I figured it was just gonna be a novelty brew, one and done."
"So, overall, it's not strictly a saison, and it's definitely not just a ""fizzy yellow beer."" It's pretty enjoyable, and I'm looking forward to trying the other two versions when they come out. I think I'll save a bottle and try all 3 side-by-side."
"D- Nice to have on a hot day, good beer all around."
"D- A cool take on a style that often adds a lot of complexity. The addition of the herbs was definitely a positive addition overall."
"I've had this a few times now and I keep finding myself coming back to it, a success."
"A great colabertaion for a very misunderstood style. Horseblanket funk that rules try it you will see what I mean."
"Drinkability- Awesome!! Wish I could get more"
"Very clean and drinkable,with enough hops ot mellow out the spices."
"Pours a slightly hazy honey straw color with a tall soapy pure white head that slowly settled into a slight cap leaving some webby lacing. The aroma is strong with grassy/floral hops, light herbs, pepper, and a spot of lemon. The flavor starts off with the grassy hops, fairly strong. The herbs definitely come out in the second wave, though no specific one really stands out. The candi sugar sweetness (?) and yeasty phenols keep the herb flavor subtle. There is a strong pepper flavor as well. The feel is light but no where near watery, solid carbonation, has a bitter edge but finishes sweet. An odd saison, very hoppy for the style, which probably masks some of the other flavors. Good base saison flavor and perhaps the hops helps keep the herbs in check. I would like to see a touch less hops, though it is a nice profile, and a touch more yeasty phenols."
"Pours straw yellow with a haze from yeast, smells of sage and rosemary or a herb garden. Taste great, sage, pine, floral, grapefruit, wheat. perfect carbonation and not in your face. Great version backyard farmhouse brew. I'd recommend it for any stone or dogfish head fan."
"Drinkability's difficult: the initial ""wow"" at the complexity of this one leads to some fatigue with the strong flavor profiles. Very enjoyable, but a little goes a long way. I'd definitely try this again, but maybe recommend splitting even a 12 oz. bottle."
"This is a beer that opens up to new levels of flavour and smells when it warms up. The nose is spices and herbs with that sharp citrus note found in many farmhouse ales in the background. The beer takes a few sips to orient itself until I got a very flavourful Saison with a peppery herbal note in the dry finish. Well thought out and very food friendly this is a great collab effort from 3 top notch breweries"
"The only downside to this beer is that it's almost strictly a novelty. It was very nice to try, and I'll get it again, but as far as drinkability goes, this is a treat beer that is more of an experience than it is a traditional beer."
"Served up a slightly cloudy light amber with a delicate fluffy white head. The smell is sweet and citrusy. It also has that nice ""saison"" smell to it that reminds me of summers living on a farm. There are also some complex herbal aromas, pepper and a clean malt character. The taste is more complex than your run of the mill farmhouse ale. Very herbal with plenty of peppery notes that are sharp and assertive. This beer has a firm bitterness, and a lot going on in the flavor department. The malt sweetness is there, but it is hard to pick up on the malt character with all the spices and whatnot. A tasty beer, but perhaps they were a bit heavy handed. The body is on the lighter side of medium with just the right level of carbonation and a nice dry refreshing finish. Very drinkable and a good beer, just not quite as good as I was hoping for."
"The drinkability is pretty good. Very tasty. The spices really cling to the palate. The taste lingered in my mouth for quite some time. Overall I have to say I was impressed. Though it does seem a bit of a stretch to call this a saison. Would it be something I go to a lot? No, probably not. I will say it left me with the desire to have a nice roast chicken."
"Overall: Epic Fail. I'd rather pour miller lite on a rag, wipe my spice rack clean and then drain it into a glass and drink it. This one tasted awful, if you are seeking a truly great Saison, try Saison Dupont or Saison Voisen."
"Drinkability is very good. Tasty yet quenching, light and smooth. Too bad it's a one off that's overpriced or I'd enjoy these throughout the summer...."
"Really dig the complex spice/herb character in this brew. Second beer I've had with sage and oh boy it's a welcome addition, especially for a saison style. Hope one of these breweries decides to put this out at least seasonally. Sure it'll go great with grilled chicken and or a spring salad. Well done."
"single from Whole Foods, Vienna, VA - look forward to the last two installments"
"This is a very nice siason, very flavorful with a nice nose. While these collaborations are a little pricey, this one is worth trying if you get the chance."
"Poured into a tulip glass a hazed light golden with a fluffy white head that left shotty lace as it settled slowly.A nice mix of citrus and overripe pineapple fruitiness, along with white pepper,and slight yeasty phenols.Citrusy on the palate with a bit of yeasty flavors,a sharp spicy white pepper and herb-like note hits in a long finish.A tad sharp in the mouth but I really like this collaberation,it has an American feel to it with its big citric flavors.A nice saison beer even if not true to form."
"Drinkability is good. Tasty dry Saison I like. Now I just need to save some for thanksgiving and drink it with Turkey and Dressing."
"Drinkability: Unique sipping beer; falvorful and garden-like...don't let the appearance fool you"
"maybe i have terrible taste but i don't want to feel like im drinking spaghetti sauce in a saison."
"Just not one for me, I guess."
"Impression: Yet another fine American brew which proves we can stand with anyone in the world. If you like the saison style this is a must try."
"D: due to rarity its hard to drink a few, over all its easy, yet not for a new craft drinker."
"Medium carbonation, light mouthfeel . This is a good saison, at $4 a bottle, not terribly priced, as I suppose all that travel for this collabo cost some money."
"D - Quite a bitter little Saison here with a strong herbal hop bite. I especially enjoyed the aroma of this collaboration brew."
"Pours clear golden with a huge fluffy head. The aroma is sharp and strong, with musky lemon, pine resin, and rosemary. The flavor is lemony, with rosemary, rose, pine, mint, lavender, vanilla, with a pleasant piny bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth."
"Poured a clear golden color with plenty of carbonation, and a creamy head. Smelled of many herbs, but Rosemary stood out for me. Same with the taste. Very complex and varied with the differetn herbs, each sip can almost taste a little different, depending on which herb your tongue picks up. I found it more interesting with each sip. Mouthfeel was dry, crisp and refreshing. Drinkability? Perhaps one would tire of this after one or two, so a markdown for that."
"D: I found this beer very complex and interesting, but at the same time, something I likely won't get again. It's not bad, but the herbal notes are just a little too strong for my liking. And the finish leaves something to be desired."
"Drinkability was also very much above average. I'm picking up a few of these for an upcoming tasting since the nose is so appealing. Will buy again, not the best tasting saison I've ever had but very complex and well crafted."
"Pours a hazy yellow straw color with active carbonation but little head and lacing. First scent brings medicinal herbs and lemon... almost like a cough drop... some pepper and yeast on the rear end. Taste brings more of the medicinal herb notes backed with a more pronounced lemon, yeast and pepper notes. Medium bodied, low carbonation, dry and lingering taste. Decent to try, but not my bag of chips."
"D - A pretty unique brew that turned out very nicely. The herbal flavors taste really fresh and add a nice touch to a solid base. I hope I can get my hands on another one or two of these before its gone."
"D: The beer is relatively drinkable, but only if you are accustomed to lots of herbal flavors such as those found in gruit beers."
"Strong aroma of hoppy lemon. Herbal taste up front followed by fruity hops, parsley, and a bit of soapiness. Moderate-to-high carbonation and a nice light mouthfeel. Very refreshing and easy to drink, but I couldn't quite get over the overall flavor, which was an odd combination of a very nice IPA and lemony dish soap. Glad I tried it, but one was plenty."
"Superb drinkabilty I could stay on this all night!"
"12 ounce bottle, $3.99 at DeCicco's in Ardsley, NY. Pours hazed light tangerine, golden amber, off white head, tiny bubble, that stays, goes to a thicker film and leaves fine sheeting and plentiful bits of fine lacing. Bright nose of the advertised spices, floral, perfumey, fruity, peppery. Highly spiced and flavorful. More pepper, flowers, pizza spicing, lime. Love the style, love the twist pulled off here. Bright, boldly flavorful, zesty and enjoyable collaboratory effort. Stinky cheese, smoky meats, spiced up Thai food? This beer can stand up to the boldest foods out there...interesting possibilities..."
"Well my notes say basil tasting, strong basil taste but after talking with Greg from Stone he said its parsley rosemary sage and thyme. Sounds great if I'm making sausage but this beer just didn't do it for me. It wasn't offensive but I doubt I'll go there again. Finishing was rather bitter and it has a creamy mouthfeel with a medium body. Too bad."
"Overall this is an interesting beer but I don't think that these herbs really belong in a beer, at least not this one. I wish it were bottle conditioned as well (I don't think it is) because this wiould lend a bit more authentic saison taste, depending on the yeast used."
"Flavor is very interesting. Its good, but not great. A little too much going on for my liking. Good complexity, but spices-galore! There's a hoppiness that comes on strong on the back side of the flavor...followed by a dry pale finish. Mouthfeel is crisp and carbonated. Booze is low...a decent saison."
"D: Good"
"drinkability: loved this beer depsite the low rankings so far. it's not on style, but its a great change of pace. I think we should rate this beer for the enjoyment instead of saying it's not a saison."
"Deep golden color with about an inch of white head. Brewed with parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme. The spice bill couldn't come through in a more clear and obvious way. Personally, I like the nose a lot. The taste is a little weaker, but still clean and packed with earthy spice rack. Lighter bodied, crisp and dry. There's nothing misleading about the label of this beer. So if you like the way the despription sounds, you'll probably like the way the beer tastes. Well done. Fun to share."
"I love saisons. I like the concept. I like the freshness and spiciness. But the herbs are a little too overpowering for me. Tone down the sage and rosemary flavors and boost the funky yeasty component that is so essential to saisons and I think this beer would be more successful."
"Starts off drinking nicely, but when the novelty wears off it's a tad boring. Still good, but nothing changes at is warms. Not sure what food would do well against this; powerful."
"I am blown away with the complexity and yet refreshing drinkability of this beer. All I can say is more, more, more! I raise my glass high to this ""holy trinity"" of brewing. Cheers!!"
"D: I was kind of hoping for a little more of the traditional Saison fruitiness. But with the herbs listed on the bottle (parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme) maybe traditional wasn't what they were going for? Just a hunch."
"Mouthfeel is light with a crisp amount of carbonation."
"Slainte..!(I hope)"
"Drinkability -- Wow, very unique. Herbs aplenty. This beer probably sat in my fridge for two weeks because I wasn't sure if I made a solid decision buying it. However, it's pretty good! Crisp, very refreshing. Can't see wanting this on a regular basis, but it has broadened my definition on what works for beer. Additional plus: fresh breath. So there you go."
"O: The herbs and the hops play really well with each other. Definitely one of the more interesting beers ive tried and very inventive on the brewers parts. Herbal and hoppy with a tinge of herbs, lots of nose and sweet body. I can only suggest more on the mouthfeel and carbonation."
"D: Drinkable. Strong in the herby flavor. One will do ya."
"I love the experimentation. This is worth seeking out if only to try something completely unusual."
"Overall, interesting to try, but the spices kind of killed it. Experimenting is fun, but doesn't always work."
"The beer pours into my Duvel tulip a brilliant gold color. A lovely white head forms, 2.5-3 fingers worth. There's some lacing, but not quite enough to earn a 5. The nose is decent, but fairly straightforward, as the sage and rosemary are pretty much all that come through. The taste is a bit more complex (thankfully), as the other spices begin to come through and there's some traditional clove/pepper notes that I'd expect in a saison. There's a little bit more bitterness than I usually encounter in a saison, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. The body is nice and dry, and the aforementioned bitterness is crisp. There's a nice, high level of carbonation. The beer is very drinkable, as the spice presence stops just short of being overbearing. I'm going to have to track a few more bottles down, as this was outrageous with a simple dish of pasta with garlic and oil."
"This beer is wildly herbal and spicy. It is very out of the ordinary and crazy. But if it werent then these guys wouldnt be doing their job."
"Extremely unique saison. The herbs are very present and pleasant and blend together great to make a very enjoyable/refreshing saison."
"Overall: This is a unique interesting tasting beer, but I don't think I could drink many of them. The ABV is reasonable, but the herbal taste can be a little overpowering. I enjoy this beer, I would drink it again, and I wish that I could try the versions from each of the other breweries."
"D: very good brew. Great on a hot summer day."
"The feel of this beer was very crisp and refreshing. Some nice smooth feel makes this beer a very drinkable offering and a really great collaboration beer. One of my favs."
"Mouthfeel is OK. Not my favorite of the Stone colabs. Just very herbal. Its a very creative attempt but not something I'd pay for again."
"Overall, the beer is missing the complexity that I expect out of a saison. It is even more disappointing when the nose seemed to suggest such a wonderful bouquet."
"D- After awhile the seasonings did become a bit overbearing. When all is said and done, this is a nice take on the style and my first three brewers collaboration beer."
"Didn't have my beer journal handy, so this won't be a full-scale review. I love the style, and this is by far the most interesting take on a saison that I've come across. The nose and taste were most similar to Moonlight's Artemis. Artemis was a hop-less beer, whereas this was not. However, the extreme floral and earthy taste which dominated Moonlight was just right in Du Buff."
"That being said, I will always support stone and its their choice to keep brewing whatever the hell they want. Ill probably buy it anyway."
"The body was average for the style, light and crisp. Drinkability was a little on the hard side, I wouldn't have a second 12oz bottle in a row, and I suspect that a pint would be hard to get through. Overall, I'm not too impressed with this beer, but it's probably worth a shot."
"Drinkability: as I said before, there's a fair bit to enjoy in this beer; however, the overall experience is a bit rough. Drinkable, but really sessionable."
"Poured into my La Fin du Monde chalice, beautiful slightly hazed bright sunshine golden hue with a bright 3-4 finger stretch of head. Lacing is fine and evenly scattered between sips, nice stuff. Aroma has a bright herbal garden nose, the rosemary additiones stand out but I don't think I could pick out the others individually very pleasant. There's also a pleasant lemon/lime tone to the nos. Flavor is harsh with herbal spices, the underlyng saison is hard to determine because the untraditional brewing additions create a blanket of bitterness I'm guessing the thyme did this. It overpowers chicken when fresh and overused. Mouthfeel is medium bodied not boozey just a cast of bittering herbs sticks to the palate like Tom's organic toothpaste. Drinkability isn't what I was expecting herbal Saisons don't work to well, checkout reviews from Great Lakes version last spring."
"The only place this beer is not scoring well would be drinkability. It's more of a novelty beer and not something I would have often. That being said, it's still a tasty brew and worth a try."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a tulip, the beer pours a slightly hazy golden/orange color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention is pretty good, and there's also a good amount of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is herbs, citrus (grapefruit, lemon peel), and peppery spice. The herbal flavors in this brew overpower the citrusy and grassy hops flavors, but that's not a bad thing in this case. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit coating with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and goes down easy. I think it's a good overall brew, the mix of herbs used in it work great. I've had mixed experiences with beers brewed with herbs, but luckily this one turned out good."
"It seems like these collaborations are the only Stone beers I buy anymore and maybe there is a reason for that. Bright golden yellow with a yeasty smell to it like a saison should. I like dteh flavor even if it was very heavy on the thyme. It almost seemed like it had some hops going on but that may have been the herbs. Overall, a good saison."
"After the outta-the-ballpark aroma, I was let down by the flavor. Not terrible, but doesn't live up to its promise."
"Interesting, but what the heck? This is pretty off the wall; seems that they were stretching to figure out what to do here. You know these guys can do better - sometimes it is best to stick to what you already do well."
"All these spices on the label had me worried, but the flavors have been blended to near perfection. A must try for Saison heads like me!"
"Overall a solid beer, and the sort of thing to excite lovers of the extreme. For me however it looses a couple of point for being just a bit to much across the herbs. If I weren't told this was a saison I probably never would have guessed it myself. I could see making a delicious lamb stew out of this ale..."
"Drinkability - One of the rare beers in my opinion that tastes nothing like the nose. The nose came across as amazing, but the taste itself is extremely off putting. I have one more left and will probably give it as an extra...to someone I don't like, heh."
"Another beer that is more interesting than good. I think this beer had a chance until they bombarded with herbs. The nose is fantastic however. Unfortunately, it does not translate well. I love the smell of a juicy steak, but I don't want to drink one."
"This beer poured a clear straw color and formed a foamy snow white head that coated the glass with lace as it subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of hops, malt, biscuits, citrus and pepper. The flavor was of hops, pepper and flowers. The body is medium light and the the finish slightly bitter."
"D - I'm not big into the whole spice thing in beer usually, but it works quite nicely for this beer."
"D-Flavorful and refreshing. Big flavor, different herbs come through on the end of the palate."
"Overall, I enjoyed this beer quite a bit. The herbs come through quite nicely and this is a refreshing summer beer. Another winner in the Stone collaboration series. If you like your herbs, then I highly recommend you seek this out; or if you're looking for a change from the regular saison style. Nice job BUFF."
"City Beer Store. Light Golden beer with a big puffy white head. Lots of big bubbles. The aroma is hugely herbal. It reminded me of a savory dish. Sage and rosemary are easier to pick out but it's all a pleasant muddle of savory herbs. The herbs make the malt aroma seem fresh and delicious. The flavor didn't work as well for me. It seemed oddly bland for a saison, much less a saison full of herbs. Medium sweet. Not much in the flavor really sets this beer out as a saison, and it doesn't compare favorably to the heavy hitters from Belgium. Mouthfeel is relatively light. The beer is good but off-style, and, in my opinion, it would have been better with more saison character."
"I'm looking forward to tasting the other collaborations that Stone has coming up."
"Pours a dark, golden-apricot color, with a big, rocky white head. Aromas of rosemary, grapefruit and lemon. Pretty floral and herb forward on the palate, with a little honey coming in on the finish. Another pretty decent Stone collaboration brew, but again nothing earth shattering and not worth the $4 price tag."
"I found this one really pleasant. Probably best in smaller doses. It would be really nice paired with a salad of stronger flavored greens like arugula and radicchio Don't expect to get something ""balanced"" as the herbs really take over, so if you don't enjoy fresh herbs, don't bother. I, however, thoroughly enjoyed it."
"Overall an interesting saison. I enjoyed the herbs but I felt that they could be a bit overwhelming at times. I had it with a BBQ chicken dinner and I though it went well but I am glad a split a glass because I feel this beer may be a bit unbalanced. An interesting and good saison interpretation from Stone DFH and Victory."
"D -- Very nice to style for the teamwork of 3 small American breweries. There is a certain acidity that lasts through the flavor and body of this beer, but I'm not sure if it's hop or yeast born, maybe both. This could probably keep me from more than one, but I can see this being delicious on a very hot day."
"The intense herbal flavor is something better kept in the realm of solid food. It tasted a little too much like sipping on roasted chicken broth. Bitterness lingers a bit too long, but not in a harsh way; but rather in a past your welcome kind of way. Nice idea, but better kept on the drawing board."
"Beer pours golden straw color. Herby notes followed by hoppy notes. Pairs well with the roasted shrimp Pho I brought home with the beer. Leaves a faint lace on the glass. I think this collaboration is a winner and I would definitely drink this one again!"
"Keep up the good work fellas !!!"
"You know, I'm going to go with ""really, really good"". This is what brewing in America is about: reinventing styles, experimenting, screwing around, but still coming up with something refreshing, tasty and drinkable, and something unique, unexpected and fascinating."
"Worst Stone beer I have ever had."
"Overall, this is a bit of a novelty beer, and here is why: lack of balance. The herbs and spices are WAAAYYYY too overpowering, to the point where the usual elements that make a good saison are barely present. However, it's still tasty; it could just use a little more refinement."
"I don't get excited about Collaboration beers, and this is the perfect reminder for me. No more plunking down my money for a bunch of brewers to get together and circle jerk."
"Pours straw gold, mild cloudiness, moderate white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma has a large amount of herbs to it, obviously in large part to the herb additions, though it melds nicely together with a light farmhouse funk and citric hop character. The sage, thyme, and rosemary all have a good presence but it all comes together fairly indistinctly. The flavor starts off with a large amount of geranium notes with grapefruit acidity and mild farmhouse funk and thyme, light sage. Sharp herbal bitterness in the middle and end, dry finish with mild farmhouse. Not sure if the herbs are bringing the bitterness up here or what, but it is a bit astringent on the finish, overly dry and really reduces the refreshment/drinkability factor. Light to medium bodied with forceful carbonation. The smell probably pleases me most here, I want to like it more than I do, the finish really brings down the drinkability for me."
"Fantastic collaboration."
"I bought a few bottles at Stone and will give it another try later to see if my opinion changes."
"A completely unique beer, even amongst some of the more experimental American takes on the saison style. It could've gone totally out of whack, considering each of these herbs is assertive on its own, much less thrown into a beer together. But when you take into account who's in charge, I'm not surprised at its balance. Worth trying at least once, even at the high price these Stone collaborations are usually set at."
"D: This is really good stuff. It's extremely herbal, but I like that so it worked nicely for me. Begs to be with food. I'm excited to hold on to my other bottle for a few months and see what happens to it."
"Going to pick up some bottle and let these bad boys age some!"
"Poured a golden yellow color into a tulip glass. Small head with a decent carbonation. Big smell of mints and herbs hits the nose. Almost ""herb-like", mon. The taste of herbs and a light mint flavor on first sip. Mouthfeel of different herbs and light spices. The drinkability is interesting with different flavors staying on the tastebuds. A saison beer from three craft breweries definitely makes this an interesting beer. Ran out of beer just trying to figure out the taste. Should have bought another bottle."
"Lemony sweet grain turns to a coarse and spicy bitterness briefly, then followed by a somewhat lingering citric finish. Feel varies through the palate and is generally somewhat coarse and dry for a Saison and thus not quite as refreshing as a cleaner version would be. Lots of hops and spice notes keep things interesting nonetheless."
"...Then she'll be a true love of mine."
"As a big fan of both the Stone/Nogne O/JP holiday beer and the Maui/Schmidt/Stone collaboration, it speaks volumes that this is perhaps my favorite beer from the collaboration series Stone is putting out. I had low expectations for this brew, and it far exceeded them. Though I drank it on its own, this strikes me as a perfect food beer."
"Poured from bottle to tulip glass. Incredibly complex saison...all herbs up front in the nose. Picking up the mint, all though I think that might have been the only herb NOT used in this. Mouthfeel is fantastic, nicely carbonated and the alcohol is present but not overpowering. The sage and rosemary really love to duke it out in this one, it seems every sip one outshines the other. Not sure where the parsley is in this, but perhaps that is what is attributing to the bitterness I am picking up in the aftertaste? All in all, solid collaboration...this is why I love craft beer. Keep on pushing the envelope and making interesting beers!"
