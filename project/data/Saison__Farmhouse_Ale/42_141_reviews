"Pours a dark cloudy yellow. Two finger head. Smell is grainy with dark fruit. Taste is sweet malt with Belgian yeast with notes of mangoand prune. Spicy pepper finish with a bit of clove. Some hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium in body. Overall an amazing saison and well done to belgian character !"
""
""
"I like the mouthfeel. The spice isn't overwhelming. Cloudiest beer I've had in a while."
""
""
""
"Overall - pretty good saison."
"Big white foamy crown. Golden color, lots of bubbles and a little cloudy. Typical saison: peppery aroma and flavor. Medium-full mouthfeel."

"I had had this a few times about 15years ago and had somehow had just forgotten about it. Glad I rediscovered it. It's a tasty, complex yet really drinkable beer."
""
"O: An outside the box take on a saison. It's big and it's spiced liberally. The ginger, coriander, and orange peel are all noticeable. It hides its potency easily, and the dryness and crispness of it make it very refreshing and easy to drink. Perfectly balanced too. A standout brew. Ommegang' recommended pairings are sushi and Asian dishes. This is spot on."
"Crisp and clear, really solid farmhouse. My favorite Ommegang, with Gnomegang a close second"
"A delicious example of an American saison. Very easy to drink, yet still complex enough to provide you something to mull over if yo want to."

"I'd make love to this beer, if  I could."

"huge,lingering, foamy white head. lightly carbonated with a yellow/green color. looks sexy in my Houblon Chouffe ipa tripel flute. Has the per verbal ""funk"" smell, with cloves and ""spices"". Some alcoholic comes through too. Great flavor for this style. Banana candy, sour mash, and lemons dominate. Great balance and carbonation. Drinks all too well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Citrusy with hints of cloves and banana. Booze becomes more apparent as it warms.  Very dry finish.  Decent beer, reminds me of Duvel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A well done saison, alcohol came through a bit more than I prefer, but still quite tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from bottle into wine glass.  Poured super cloudy light-orange, with 2in head of billowing white.  Strong notes of orange zest and Lemon bread.  Carbonation flirts with your tongue as you taste, and leaves you with a sweet clean palette afterwards.  Very refreshing.  Still learning saisons, but this is a very specific but delicious and refreshing beer nonetheless."
""

"Glass- Chalice"
"Tasty! Need I say more...bitterness was on point..."
"M: tart, high carbonation, good body for the style, dry at the end,"

"Hennepin is very drinkable and a fine brew from a top shelf brewer Ommegang."
""
"O: Reminds me of a blue moon, but much better. Spicy and flavorful. Will definitely get again."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a light straw yellow with a very fizzy head. The smell has a bit of spice up front but settles into yeast and fresh bread with some light citrus. The taste was very nice, almost champagne like with hints of banana as well as fresh baked bread. The feel was a bit overly fizzy but it was a great beer overall. Would highly recommend."
"Champagne like highly carbonated pale pilsner pour with light fruits & spices.  The palate and finish is very dry."

"O-somewhat disappointed in this one today as I had this beer before and thought it was great but just not living up to my memory..........maybe the palate is off today.........does improve with each sip but something just isn't working for me on this one"
""
""
""
""
""
"Moderate to high carbonation. The head is white, thick, and holds up well. moderate lacing. Pours turbid. Golden in color. Sexiest beer I've encountered thus far. Citrus, light bodied, and flavorful."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Refreshing crisp and flavorful. My favorite ommegang beer."
""
""

"Overall: nice farmhouse ale. I really enjoy Ommegang ales and look forward to trying more."
""
"Not a big fan of Farmhouse Saisons I guess.  Smelled and tasted like yeast."
"Exceptional saison. Another great ommegang brew. Pours light yellow with a relatively heavy top. Drinks very easy, and at 7.7% alc/vol they mask the strength well. Can clearly smell the sweet orange peel but it's the taste that's gonna keep me coming back. Until I find one to better it, the Hennepin is my new go-to saison"
""
"Pours a hazy golden color, two finger tall fluffy but fast fading off-white head settles to a thin ring, trails a few streaks of lace down the glass. Smell: pear, pepper, lightly grassy and lemony, with notes of unripe banana and something a bit oddly vegetal (like sprouting garlic). Checking the label I've never realized how many extras they throw in... don't see any expected offenders, but there is that odd out of place note. Taste: boozed ripe pear, mild whole-grain-bread graininess, lemon peel, significantly peppery with some really mild orange-ginger mix in the finish. Initially slick then fast growing carbonation hits, gets to be a little too much, then fades slowly into a crisp-ish but not dry, and slightly sticky, finish. Packaged 3/14, best by 3/16. This was my first ""saison"" many years ago and it's definitely an enjoyable beer... throttle up the gravity a bit and it's a killer BSPA... but for the style it advertises it's not great, and very reliant on the adjuncts."
"Even the beers from Ommegang that aren't outstanding are still worlds better than the same brews from a lot of other brewers. Ommegang just brews with magic, and the Hennepin is evidence of that: pretty pale color, fruitful, but not too sweet taste, and a smooth finish. Great beer."
""
""
"Beautiful appearance. Hazy gold with a resilient white head. Faint citrusy smell. Taste has a nice subtle tartness to it. Citrus notes with a metallic aftertaste."
""
""
""
"OVERALL/DRINKABILITY - Label indicates coriander, ginger, and orange peel, but the flavorings are very mild."
""
"Very enjoyable.  One of my new favorites!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A better than average saison, but just barely."
""
"This beer is a little sour not my favorite"
""
"Sweeter than expected.  Nice fruity notes."
""
""
""
"Aroma is light citrus fruit. Pour is a clear effervescent yellow with a thick white head. Head is long lasting with generous lacing on the glass. Taste is bold crisp , slightly alchoholic; like fermented grapefruit! Pleasant!"
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer tastes very lemony. Not huge fan"
""
"For about 3 dollars a bottle, this beer is cheap in comparison to other Belgian beers (normally 5 and up), however it doesn’t lack in complexity and character. It is owned by the same company that produces beers like Duvel (another favorite) and Achouffe, so that’s another perk of known quality! This would go well with many different food pairings. I think pairing this beer with something equally spicy would work well such as some excellent cured meats like hot coppa or soppressata.  Again, for the price, this beer is my go to! The only thing that isn't perfect is that as the beer warms up it gains a slightly more present alcohol hit (amplified by the flavor of raw ginger) that detracts from all of the other great flavors. It isn't terrible, however, I did have to mark it down for that reason.  However, I still give it 98/100 points!"

"Golden amber with a generous white frothy head that lasts a long time. Fresh bakery bread aroma with pepper and slight citrus, lemon. Taste is mostly fresh bread with after notes of fresh spice, lemon and pepper. Just like the aroma suggests. Nice bitterness at the back of the tongue that stays for a long time. Recommended!"

"Draft.  Poured a golden light orange.  Smells of citrus - orange peel maybe?  A little ginger?  No head.  In the mouth this is an extremely mellow saison.  Most taste like a dirt barn door but this one has hints of sugar, sweetness, citrus and hoppiness.  Extremely light and drinkable.   bubbles.  DANGEROUS.  It is a high ABV (7.7%) and you could drink several easily.  They should change the name to Thor's Hammer!  Really tasty and light.  Definitely a true Belgian style saison.  Like it a lot."

"Very good beer, great crisp clean taste, followed by a sweet after taste. Awesome flavor but satisfying for all beer drinkers, recommended out of a tap into a growler, served in a chilled beer mug"

"Pours a cloudy pale yellow with a medium fluffy white head, some lacing as well. Aroma and Taste is of citrus, wheat, some mild spicy hops, yeast with a light lemon twist, light fruity notes upfront. Palate is a medium body, crisp and refreshing mouth feel with good carbonation. Finish is sweet biscuit malt, citrus flavors, some wheat, yeast and mild spicy hops on the end. Overall a very good, refreshing and enjoyable summer time brew."

"Poured from a Bottle that had chilled in the fridge for about an hour. A very hazy deep amber color was present in the glass at first but cleared up some as it sat. The taste is very vibrant in the mouth and consists of several zingy citrus fruits, a light hoppy character in the middle with a reminiscence of wheat grain, and finishes beautifully in a cascade of flavors that dance around the mouth well after swallowing. Personally, not my kind of flavored but a lot of care and attention has clearly been put into the brewing process for this one."

"10/02/12 On tap at Rattle n Hum. I've avoided this brew as it's branded a saison which is such a wide open style. This is a fine concoction. Experience shows through. Great balance. Careful w/the ABV as this could catch you up."

"12 oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass. A cloudy golden yellow with a white head that starts large but quickly settles down to a comfortable half-finger. Very malty, fruity, spicy aroma: Fresh apples, hay, light grapefruit, breakfast cereal, pungent coriander seed, white wine, and just a touch of funk. Palate is correspondingly fruity yet quite dry. Robust rich malt backbone coupled with the fruit and spice notes mentioned above, subtle nutmeg and cardamom, citrus (lemon and grapefruit rind), shortbread, and a hint of rock candy sweetness. Body is thin to moderate, with carbonation on the low end. Quite a wonderful saison, not as tart and bitter as some, lacking that dry ""burlap sack"" note, and yet redolent with yeast phenols and esters plus added hop bite."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, it is a delicious beer and another example of why I’m being drawn to Belgian-styles.  Complex, yet well connected and easy to drink.  Perhaps just a bit too dry and astringent … preserve a touch more malt in the overall character."
""
""
""
""

"Slightly hazy light golden color, earthy fruity funky aroma and flavor. Deceptively easy to drink farmhouse ale."

"Gorgeous deep straw colored beer with a dense and rocky head. Endless strings of bubbles feed the head and never let it fade. Great lacing down the glass. Aromas of pears, apples, peppery notes, citrusy notes, a touch of earthy and floral hops and some of that barnyard funk. Taste follows through with citrusy orange notes, mild peppery tones, floral hop flavor, tart apple and Belgian fruity yeast flavors. Mouthfeel begins creamy with ample carbonation that finishes super dry. A great saison, one to have again for sure."

"O: Another very good selection from Ommegang, who is currently averaging a wonderfully high rating for me. Probably the most consistent and highest average brewery I've reviewed. Hennepin must be my least favorite beer from them so far, but it is still a very good brew that would be nice to drink on a mild summer afternoon."

"O: Overall this beer was good, but wasn't a stand out by any means. This is the only saison I've ever had so maybe I'm just not a huge fan of the style, but I would give this beer another go. Nice and refreshing on a hot summer day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, being one of the first saisons I have critiqued I found it pretty good. If anything a little too spicy for my liking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Exactly what I was hoping for with a Saison. Just a little bit of sweet and spice up front, with just enough hops to balance at the finish. Enough going on to keep me interested through the whole pint. Strong but still refreshing on a hot day - relatively high ABV but did not taste of alcohol. Would definitely get this again."
""
""
""
""
"This beer was bought for $9.19 at Hennessey Grocery in Butte, Montana, which continues to bring variety and exotica to beer drinkers in our corner of the mountains. The price is at least 2 dollars below Belgian imports of a similar quality for sale in the store."
""
"Upon sipping is where the orange peel kicks in, and everything else that was on the nose falls into place for a creamy, biting saison that embodies its listed ingredients very well. Ending is an earthy sum of all the ingredients, sharp, biting, some minerals. Not complex to me, but I enjoyed sipping this well enough."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - What else can I say, this is simply a fantastic saison, and a perfect representative of the style. Everything you want is here - yeast, spice, light fruits... and it's bold, effervescent and dry. A must try."

"If your a fan of Saisons I would definitely put it on a ""to drink"" list."
"It poured hazy golden, with a thick white head, average carbonation, and little lacings. It has malty, wheat and hops infused taste, with strong accents of orchard fruits. I t has a malt aroma that fades quickly and goes down smouth and leaves the mouth dry. It has a little edge, with a light after taste, and is somewhat filling. Great beer over all in my opinion."

"I'm not the hugest Saison fan, but this beer is fantastic. So very drinkable and enjoyable, just watch out for the abv, it can hurt you. Excellent."
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: This beer was rated without any financial bias, however, the pleasure it provided was frighteningly affordable. If I were to ever drink this with a buddy, we'd certainly need two bottles, because I'm not sharing mine."
""
""
""
""
" Still on a hot day and your dollar, I'd have another in a heartbeat. Let it also be known that I have immense respect for the ""gang"" and love many of their beers. Saison is the wild card of styles and one mans thirst slaker might be anothers ambrosia as there seems to be no clear consensus on what this style really is."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is just a really well-done American-made saison. It's one of my favorite beers from a stellar Ommegang lineup and one that I will frequently grab just on a whim when I'm looking for a solid saison that isn't Tank 7."

"Opinion: Amazing! Similar to Tank 7… Maybe better? I was worried a little because of all the adjuncts (coriander, ginger, orange peel), but the balance is perfect. The medley is hard to detect and many sips are necessary to fully appraise. The individual flavors are elusive and fleeting. Buy it again? Oh yesss, a more thorough examination is needed."

"Pours a hazy yellow with a big foamy head that lasts for a bit. Moderate lacing. Big aroma of grapefruit and citrus, with notes of yeast. The taste follows the aroma, along with a fair amount of sweetness and spice. Mouthfeel is light and crisp. This is such a good saison. It leaves me thinking of warmer weather and hoping for another glass soon."

"O: I agree with ajzbedo in that this would be great to pop the cork on a hot summer day it's refreshing and flavorful in the bread department. It can even at times remind me of caraway ie pumpernickel. I'd say I'm a fan, it's reasonably priced too."

"What a wonderful saison! I'd love to buy some bottles and watch as they all develop over time, in spite of the apparent freshness dates. This has to be one of the most underrated saisons brewed in the country - and I'm at guilt myself, as I've spent so much time running after the more hyped or limited ones while this would gather dust on shelves wherever I'd go. Highly recommended for saison lovers - a domestic offering that's up there with my favorites from Belgium."

"O: This is my second go around with Ommegang first time wasn't great (abbey ale), but they hit a home run with this one! From start to finish I loved everything about this beer. I probably would rate higher if it were 95 degrees in July instead of 2 degrees in February. Great hot summer ale. I highly recommend!"

"O: I'm not the world's biggest saison fan, but this proved to be a great choice. The spicy, orange peel tartness mellowed perfectly on the palate. I would drink this again. Easily drinkable and sessionable if you can find it at the right price. Paired well with a Neapolitan margherita pizza with a little black truffle oil on top. I would recommend this beer as a great example of the style."

"Pours a hazy light yellow with tons of head. Nice soapy lacing down the glass. Smells of wheat and banana in the nose. There is a hint of spice notes as well. Tastes of sweet malt, spices, whole wheat and definitely more than a hint of alcohol. This is a very refreshing wheat beer although I feel it's a little over carbonated for my taste."

"Ill admit off the bat that I overpoured this (little more foam than I'd like) and I'm not a huge fan of the style. Light in color w white foam. Smell is appealing and complex. Taste many distinct flavors and reminds me of a few belgian ales I have had, still smooth and rich without etoh burn. A very enjoyable beer, might be better on hot summer day vs ""winter warmer"""

"Overall: Easily my favorite example of this style so far. Complex, refreshing and delicious. Works well during any season. The orange peel is very apparent and the grains of paradise and coriander add a spicy complexity that's great with the Belgian yeast. The tanginess and hints of citrus add even more to the depth of this beer."

"I am a big fan of the ales from Ommegang, working in the brewing business not much needs to be said about this classic brewery from Cooperstown, N.Y. My sous chef and I enjoyed many Saison's one recent evening, one being a DuPont and I really liked the N.Y. brew better. The color, aroma and mouth feel were all what you would expect from a classic Farmhouse Ale."

"O - My first saison, and certainly a style I will continue to explore off the back of this experience. While 7.7% abv isn’t super high, it’s a good fraction higher than your average beer, and this beer carries the load with no stoop in its shoulders, a trait I must always commend. If this serves as an exemplar for saisons, then for me that means I ought expect a sort of musty, wheaty Belgian ale with a casual attitude towards carbonation. If this beer were cheaper it would be highly sessionable, but as it stands, while enjoyable, I probably wouldn’t pay $10 for a bomber again when I can get my hands on top notch Belgians, Weizenbocks and Hefeweizens for less."

"The Hennepin was bottle conditioned so it poured with plenty of head and a “majestic golden hue”. Once I fought through the head to get a taste I was rewarded with a beer that has a nice creamy texture but was very light on the palate which is as advertised. There were citrusy notes that added a bit of pep on the tongue and created an all-around excellent beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Hadn't had this one in a while, and was worried it may have dropped off in quality since I last did have it. Was happy to find that was not the case. Excellent, interesting. and wonderfully drinkable saison."

"Fantastic fantastic beer. Great Saison very light and refreshing beer could enjoy any time of year any time of day fantastic odor and fantastic taste. Has an amazing mouth feel and one of the best farmhouse's I have ever had. Everything I have had at ommegang is amazing and this is no different"

"750 ml caged and corked bottle, packaged on 04/19/13, best by 04/2015. Served in a Unibroue tulip, the beer pours a cloudy gold color with a couple inch frothy white head that sticked around for a while. There's also a good amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, it smells like bready malt/grain, coriander, cloves, peppery spice, orange peel and bananas. The brew tastes like bready malt/grain, cloves, bananas, ginger, orange peel, and some pear and sweet spices. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it has high but soft carbonation so it's easy to drink. I liked this brew a lot. I've had Hennepin in the past, but it's been a very long time since the last time I tried it. I don't think it will be as long of a wait until the next time I drink some! $7.49 a bottle."

"I had this at the Harvard Club of NY's saison tasting. It was poured from 750ml bottles. It was straw in color, a bit cloudy with a substantial sized head. Sweet malt and a bit of citrus where the first things to hit my nose. The taste was spicy yeast and again, sweet malt. The finish is dry. Perfect beer for the summer heat."

"Pours a lightly hazy blondish ale with a towering foam head that eventually fades with heavy lacing on the glass sides. Smells of coriander, some sweet orange. Spicy phenolics and spicy esters. Tastes dry and spritzy with an even bitterness firm yet not too assertive. Spiciness from yeast coats the tongue. Drinks easy, dry, medium light. Excellent beer. Seems like it came straight from Belgium. Glad to have this brewery in the States."

"Overall I thought this was pretty good beer and a very good example of the style, it had all the aspects that I look for in this style and I think it's pretty close to being as good as Saison Dupont which is my favorite of the style and I think I will have to try the two side by side to really find out which one I prefer. This beer had great drinkability, it was pretty smooth, clean, not filling, pretty refreshing, and the flavors did a great job at holding my attention, I could drink a few of these easily, I think it's a great summertime Saison. What I like the most about this beer was the how true to style it was, it had pretty much everything that I look for in a good Saison. What I liked the least about this beer was the how little the farmhouse aspect showed up, i wouldn't mind if it imparted a little more funk and typical Farmhouse flavors. I would buy this beer again when looking for a nice Saison, it's a little pricey but it is cheaper than Saison Dupont, but I don't think I would buy this all the time. I would recommend it to anyone who likes Saisons. All in All i was pretty impressed with this beer, I wasn't so impressed with their Belgian Pale Ale, but this beer turned out pretty damn good and I'm now a little more interested in checking out more of Brewery Ommegang's Lineup. Good job guys, I really enjoyed this Saison."

"M - Light body with some chew. Dry. Moderate carbonation."
""
""
""
"O- One of my favorite saisons. It is difficult to beat the price and availability of such a fantastic representation of the style. Ommegang makes it look almost easy here. Maybe the best year round saison IMO."
""
""
"Nicely done. Surprised that the carbonation was as aggressive as it was on the palate based on the appearance, but there are several things going on with the beer. Solid execution of the style."
""
"Overall - Not my favorite saison but still good. Very drinkable."
""
"O: A great balanced beer with an awesome appearance and small…and it tastes great. Lotas of yeasty flavor balanced with a mild backbone and a pleasant dry finish."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is the standard of the style in the eyes of many people, and I see why. Hits all the notes that a Saison should. Personally, I prefer my Saisons with some tartness, and Fantome is still the epitome of the Saison to me. This is a great beer though. Deserving of the Beers of Fame list."

"My lawn tractor is broke and my .75 acre lawn is six inches long. Borrowing my neighbors lawn mower with a broken drive, I had to push. Temp was apx 85 F and sunny. I was really looking forward to this after mowing feeling like a farm laborer. Man, this hit the spot and was ever so refreshing. Thoughts kept going towards how this really compares to Saison Dupont, my first saison. I just love a beckoning saison like this on warmer summer sunny days-good memories to have."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very flavorful example of the style. Not a fan of banana esters, and this isn't my favorite style, but a refreshing beer. Plasticy phenols were a bit of a turnoff, too. While I'm complaining,I find the carbonation to be too high."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-very refreshing and drinkable for the abv. I'm not saison expert but this is a very solid beer. Highly recommend"
""
"I must have gotten a bad 4-pack because this was really alcoholic smelling and tasting. Didn't have any of the subtlety I remember (tho' I must confess it's probably been a few years since I've had this beer). Boozy! And so overcarbed it was impossible to pour well..."

"Mouthfeel: Juicy and slightly creamy"

"First of this style for me. I like it....a lot. Clean and tight. A beer I would like to sip floating down the river on an inner tube with one of my old friends. Not an expert on this style so I won't act like it. However I know beer, and this one is real nice boys."
""
""
""
""
""

"Fantastic Saison. Poured with a very nice pure white head, golden below. Very drinkable and good lacing. Aroma is top notch, my favorite part of this beer with the spices coming through. Definite citrus notes with wonderful warm spices coming through."
""
"O: A very refreshing Saison, exactly what I wanted on a hot night like tonight. The flavors could be a bit stronger, but none of them were bad. A good brew that suits the style well, but I can find less expensive beers with as much flavor to cool me off."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a great saison and a beer that I've gone back to time and again. Another home run for Ommegang."
" This experience has not daunted me to try the many other Ommegang offerings, or even a fresher example of Hennepin."
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium to medium-light in body, with carbonation of medium intensity, leading to a slightly fizzy, though never prickly or painful, mouthfeel that settles into a thin blanket of foam on the tongue. Closes fairly dry, with little residual stickiness on the palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a very hazy golden color with a thick head.  Head retention is good.  Lacing is decent.  Has the funky yeasty fruity aroma.  A little more hop and a little less fruit would be nice.  Strong yeasty funk taste with very fruity aftertaste.  It is a little on the sweet side but still good.  Still would prefer a little more hop to it."

"overall: A great saison, probably only second to Saison Dupont in my opinion. Seek this out if you like the style, even most non craft beer drinkers will like this."
"O - This is similar to a Belgian Pale Ale, but lighter. It's a very good beer, and definitely enjoyable on a scorching hot day. The ABV is a little high for a ""refreshing"" drink, but you certainly don't notice as you're drinking. Overall, not a particularly complex drink, but definitely one I'd have again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very pleasant saison, but overall, nothing terribly special. I was a teensy bit irritated by the fact that I had to fight through the fizzy head to get to the liquid, no matter how much time went by or exactly how I poured the brew. Not sure I would seek it out in the future, but I certainly wouldn't turn it down. Next time, I'll drink it straight from the bottle to avoid the foam clouds."

"Served in a Samuel Adams Sensory Perfect Pint glass. Hazy straw with 2 fingers of creamy, white head that settles onto a foamy cap that lasts throughout. Spicy aroma - mostly clove and pepper - with a hint of fruitiness. Lots of Belgian yeast character. Tart upfront and through the finish. Nicely balanced. Light bodied and crisp with effervescent carbonation. Finishes dry with a slight bitterness. Well balanced and extremely flavorful. Highly recommended."

"Hennepin is my everyday favorite from Ommegang. It’s a lighthearted, somewhat prickly farmhouse saison. Pours a cloudy straw yellow with a great big head that lasts. Laces well. The citrus is not as prominent as some saisons but it’s there, and it’s not sour. Earthy flavors lend balance to the forwardly floral hops. The malt exudes a tender sweetness that’s somehow masculine. A great saison, easy to drink, mellow, a little peppery. Mouthfeel is crisp and light. In the glass this beer is equitable and upright. Bravo!"

"A true class act. Nice mix of earthy and musty notes in the mix and a fair bit of citrus hops. I am a fan of funky saisons but this does a good job having a good complexity and profile with some typically musty citrus yeast."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hazy gold with a gigantic white head (pour it into a 16 ounce glass). Smells like yarrow and milkweed, like an overgrown field (typical of saisons). Flavours of coriander, yellow curry, fresh cut grass, booze. You have to like saisons to appreciate this, but it's a good one."

"The beer pours pale, golden yellow with a lot of chunks and carbonation bubbles circling around. The beer pours with a nice tight white head on it that settles to a quarter of a fingers width and leaves a thin lacing of tight, dry bubbles. On the nose, the beer smells strongly of spiced coriander with hints of orange peel, and ginger. There is also distinct bananay yeast in the background giving lovely character to the nose, while the hops and yeast are properly downplayed with lights notes of grass and hay and some wheat notes. On the tongue, the beer tastes creamy sweet and grassy bitter with lots of spice character. The flavor begins as orange peel and light wheat malt before being steamrolled away by heavy coriander spices with hints of pickling ginger. This moves into bitter grassy hops and banana yeast. The finish gives a fresh kiss of coriander infused orange juice with just a hint of sweet wheat bread before mellowing into an aftertaste of light coriander spice and yeasty banana funk. In the mouth, the beer tastes creamy smooth and medium in body with a touch of fierce carbonation that mellows into a clean scrubbing of the tongue. The mouth is left slightly dry but clean. Overall this is a solid and interestingly flavored beer. They’re a little heavy handed with the coriander spicing, which hurts the other flavors, but these flavors still show through and are beautiful and fresh in feel. This is a classic American saison in a Belgian-style. Worth a try."
""
""
"Not a bad Saison, but the flavor doesn't really wow me. It's enjoyable, but it doesn't really surprise or excite, and it falls short because of the way some notes clash."

""

""
"Not sure if it's worth the steep price."

"I opened this bottle in March but I have read that it is really refreshing to indulge during the summer months. I do think this beer complements well with all seasons. Drinking it right now felt like a perfect occasion. It could be opened on a cold rainy day or on a hot sunny day. Best drink cold before the beverage warms up if drinking on a hot day."

"Murky pale straw color--definitely fits the bill. Sweet fruity aroma. Sweet and juicy tasting beer. Bitterness right at the end. Awesome for the summer sun. True to the style and an appropriate alcohol level. Mild carbonation. Flavor is in balance. One of our top five saisons right now."

"O - Overall, It looked promising, but since it's a part of the Duvel family I am not surprised that it is highly overrated. Tastes like urine. Plain and simple."

"Overall - This is a good beer, nothing spectacular, but good. I would rather have a couple of the other Saisons instead, but there is nothing wrong with this one. It just doesn't really leave the ""wow"" impression taht I look for out of a Beer of Fame."

"This is nice tasting beer, light and refreshing, would be nice in the summer. Hides its abv completely."

"O-This is one of my favorite saisons ever (new or old world). Ommegang really hits on all cylinders here: the brew is good looking, it smells nice (love the crisp lemon and honey), the taste is complex, and the feel is well-matched to the flavor profile. I will definitely drink this again."
"Overall a really good beer which is very close to being a top notch beer."

"O: Overall the wait paid off, this beer is a bit expensive, but for the deal I got, it's in amazing gig, but cost aside, this is a great beer, I mean it's perfectly balanced, rich, robust, and smooth all at the same time, great with food, excellent craftsmanship, a must try for everyone."
""
""
"Overall: I like this beer, and have it every chance I get. But when I finally set down to review it, it didn't hit the style notes I thought it would. It's perhaps a too-commercialized version of a saison."

""
""
""
""

"Overall: Liked the look of this beer and actually liked holding the bottle once I first grabbed it. Something told me this was going to be a special one, and boy was it! Quite disappointined this perticular beer isn't widely available in PA, but I'm sure I can do some hunting and locate it. I would recommend this beer to anyone interested in trying a traditional Saison. Cheers!"

"93-94 A"

"From a 750ml bottle as part of a Ommegang variety pack. Very tall head that recedes slowly. A fairly pale color with some hints of amber. The smell seems similar to a pilsner; very crisp and clean with some flowery hints. The taste is very interesting. Almost like a pilsner and wheat beer combination. Some sweetness at the end leaves you wanting more. Although I am not very familiar with the saison style, this is a very good beer overall."

"Pours a slightly cloudy golden amber. There is a layer of off white head. Has a pils like note in the nose along with some Belgian spice. More Belgian spice in the taste along with a pleasant sweetness. Just a bit herbal with a slight bitterness in the finish. Light and quite nice. The carbonation level is a bit high,"
"O: Really good Saison. Especially looks and tastes great."
"Final Thoughts: An enjoyable Saison. Light in body and mild in flavor. Would I drink it again? Probably not because I'm not a huge fan of the style but I would highly recommend it to anyone who is."

"Very good beer - almost similar to a Belgian tripel, but more spicy and less sweet. The added farmhouse funk on the tail end adds a different elements, as well as some unidentifiable fruit. Very pleasing, I'd definitely have this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a golden orange with a foamy white head which fades to decent lacing. Aroma is of citrus, baked bread, yeast, cloves, some sour fruit, and some earthy funk. Taste is of baked bread, lemon peel, yeast, cloves, sour fruit, black pepper, and some earthy wet hay. Has a medium body with a creamy mouthfeel and a dry, slighty bitter, champagne like finish. Overall, a nice example of a Saison."

"Overall (4/5): Hennepin is a quality Saison that really nails the essential flavor hallmarks of the style. And while it doesn't feature anything particularly adventurous, creative, or outlandish, it's still quite a pleasant beer and a wonderful introduction to the style. That I would recommend either Hennepin or Saison Dupont to those who have never had a Belgian-style Saison is a testament to how well Ommegang's creation stands up to the imported examples of the style (Saison Dupont being a paragon of the Saison style). Good stuff and a worthy buy."

"When poured from a 750 mL bottle into a tall glass (maybe the wrong choice) this developed a very tall, foamy head that took a while to settle."

"Cloudy white gold color. Long lasting head of mixed small bubbles and lace on a chalice glass...poured from corked bottle. Aroma of grass, bread dough, citrus. Taste changes significantly as the beer warms/opens up...floral hops, amber malts, black pepper...subtle notes of sour apple, soap, alcohol, clove, lemon rind. Lively carbonation with a crisp, enticing finish. Overall very flavorful with farmhouse yeast esters offering many flavors. Good alone or with various foods. Darn tasty!"

"Ommegang has done it again with this great example of saison, nice medium carbonation, golden wheat color, substantial head and crisp taste. very well balanced taste, alcohol is hidden and this would be a session beer but for it's 7.7 ABV...one of my favorite saisons. The label says they are part of the Duvel family."

"A beer that calls itself the True Belgian-Style Saison? It better be good."
""
"O: This is damn near close to perfect for a saison in my books. Light and refreshing with lively flavors. I'm so glad this brewery is close by and comparatively cheap. They really put out high quality stuff at a great price (at least around here, I know it's way more expensive in other counties/states.)"
""
""
""
""
"Poured into an Ommegang flute glass. Pours a light golden amber with a massive white head with great retension and chunky lacing. Aroma is very fruit forward with orange, stone fruits, pear, light sweet malt and a hint of spicing. Flavor follows aroma with sweet pear, peach, bannana, sweet malt and Belgian spicing, finishing slightly dry with the saison yeast flavor finally making its presence known. Very flavorful and refreshing. Light bodied with excellent carbonation and mouth feel. The wild yeast element seems a bit tamed down from Belgian saisons, but the other flavors are so great that it hardly matters."
""

"O-a delicious farmhouse ale from Ommegang in the classic Belgian style, will be enjoying a lot more of these in the future"

"O - I love the saison/farmhouse style and ive had many from its home country of Belgium. For a long time now American brewers havent truly understood this style of ale. Ommegang don't pretend to brew in a Belgian style but they actually do brew solely in a Belgian style. They give American craft junkies a true Belgian saison brewed and bottled right here in the United States and Hennepin holds true to the authentic farmhouse style. If you want the best American made saison then this is the one. American brewing has needed a farmhouse ale to give the great Belgians a run for their money and Ommegang's Hennepin is that saison we can call our own knowing it can compete. Pure class"
"O – What a great beer. I actually totally was not expecting to enjoy this as much as I did. I love the Saison style to begin with (who am I kidding I love just about every style), and I love Ommegang Brewery so perhaps I was being naïve in thinking I wouldn’t enjoy this, but I really really like it. Maybe the best Saison I’ve had to date."
""
""
""
"O: Quite good. By the end of the bomber my curiosity was satiated. It will be a year or more before I have to, well I don't want to unsettle those bits of yeast right now. So quaff able. I quaffed this bottle so hard, in positions illegal in both Pennsylvania and Utah."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours bright yellow with monster head. Smells of funk, spice and a hint of citrus. Nice light mouthfeel, good carbonation. Flavor is a nice mix of lemon peel, belgian yeast, and some peppery/ginger flavor. Easy drinking and nice beer. This is easily my favorite beer from the big O. I could drink this all day long and the sweet yet light brew is so nice."

"Overall, the only thing that needs to be said is ""I LOVE THIS BEER !!"".... Amazing from first sight in the glass.... It's complex and deep scents to the delicious and complimentary taste and mouthfeel.... This is amongst the most perfectly balanced beers I've ever had."
"Good Mouth feel, moderate carbonation. Creamy butterscotch with farmhouse brett and a touch of peppery spice with some banana, honey, and a hint of bread as it warms. A nice bitter comes through on the finish then fades nicely. Very clean beer, a touch of lemon with slight alcohol essence on occasion."
"As far as I'm concerned, this is the Gold Standard for Saison/Farmhouse in the USA as far as mass producers are concerned. Some micro out West might have a better one, but as far as a Big Time producers, this is it. Everything is right on. Smell, appearance, and of course taste. It has the classic Belgian esters you get with the Farmhouse yeast strains. Everyone is out to make an ""Americanized"" Farmhouse/Saison by going big with the gravity or the hops or more unfortunately, both. True Saisons are not overly hoppy and are modest alcohol % with just enough hops to keep them from going bad too quickly. This one is a bit on the high side alcohol-wise to really be a real traditional Saison, but it is otherwise on the money. Saisons were brewed to refresh the seasonal field workers in Wallonia, and the brews were generally 3-5% so the workers could have one and still finish the job. 7.7% is a bit too high to be a true traditional Saison. Still, if you don't like this beer, you don't like Saisons."

"Overall a really good beer. Unfortunately I don't have a lot of experience with this style but I know what I like and I like this beer. Ommegang is a really good brewery. Most of their beers are like this one - very good."
""
""
""
"This beer is hazy orange with a massive white head. Aroma is breaddy, yeasty, and spicy. There is also a nice lemon zest character to this beer as well as a slight dark fruit. There is a lot of wheat flavor and feel to this one. It is fruity, zesty and wheaty. The feel of the beer is highly carbonated at first but gets smoother and creamier over time. The dark fruit and the wheat flavors work well together and are constantly changing. The yeast adds a spicy character and feel to the beer. This is a nice offering by Ommegang and a solid saison."
""
""
""
""
"What makes this beer stand out is the distinctness of each of its myriad flavors. To achieve complexity without confusion is the mark of fine craftsmanship. I take my hat off to Brewery Ommegang for delivering an outstanding rendition of this extremely delicate and difficult style."
""
""
"what a beer!"
""
"Poured into a goblet. Pours hazy pale golden with a thick soapy white head. I can detect plentiful streaming bubbles in the beer. The head retreats slowly. There are aromas of biscuit from the malts as well as those typical spiced and fruity Belgian ale aromas like coriander, lemon, and pear. The beer definitely is spicier in the taste that in the nose. The coriander is more intense and it's somewhat peppery. Those fruity flavors are more intense, being pear forward. The hops on the back end provide some bitterness for balance. The body is medium with strong carbonation. The finish is very dry. For the style, this is solid. Those expected notes really come through and it deserves an A for that even if this is not my favorite style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (4.25): This is a really solid saison—always has been. Considering how light and dry it is for something of this strength, you can get a very good sense of the yeast character in this beer, which I like. It’d be nice to have some more head retention, but it looks good enough and has a nice nose, with a very good flavor and feel. It’s not transcendent at any point, but as classically styled saisons go, it’s well rounded and well done. Hennepin is a very solid, reliable beer."
""
""
""
""
"Taste-Pear, golden apple, spicy Belgian yeast, white pepper. Wonderfully effervescent, 'tingly' mouthfeel. Spicy,refreshing, earthy hop notes, crisp, peppery finish. ""Gulpable"" but be mindful of the 7.7ABV. Rustic,classic Farmhouse style. Excellent!"
""
""
""
""
""

"O: This beer is fairly tasty but really odd for the style. It's also been aged for over a year, so the yeast has really taken over the beer. Decent."

""
""

"One of the best saisons I've had, though I have admittedly tried very few."

"Color is golden, with a large billowy white head that lasts and lasts. Scent is primarily fresh cut grass, with some freshy baked bread too. The taste features lemon, biscuit, and earthy grass flavors, along with a bit of tart apple. The alcohol definitely makes its presence known in the taste - it is almost wine-like. Excellent mouthfeel, even though it is light-bodied. Nice complexity, and a fine drinking experience."

"A very well done saison - a bit pedestrian compared to belgian syle (I was just there), but hits on all charachteristics, fresh flavors and decent depth."

""
""
"12oz bottle. This beer pours a very light bodied and bright pear juice gold in color with a highly carbonated and active two finger bright white head. The nose is light and yeasty. It has nice white orchard fruit character, like sweet apple and pear. The flavors follow suit. It has a light, slightly sweet fresh fruitiness to pair with the light and off dry Belgian yeast. It's very well rounded and has great flavor. It drinks light in body with a little too much carbonation for a saison, in my opinion, but it really doesn't detract from the beer at all. This is a light, easy drinking saison and you don't detect any of the 7.7% at all. I can't believe I waited so long to try it."
""
""
""
""

"O: though this is not my usual choice of beer, it is surprisingly satisfying. I would drink it again if I was looking for a lighter kind of ale with character. Even now I am still curious about it and would definitely try it again."

"had a whole keg of this with the boys this week. pours a hazy bright yellow colow with very excited carbonation and a thick bone white head thats lasts forever. smells farmy, like wild yeasts and wheat malt. really funky nose with some spice as well. flavor is equally interesting and the yeast is the star. it has a bitter lemon rind component and a peppery barnyard finish. excellent saison. mouthfeel is magnificent. its effervescent carbonation and medium unfiltered body make it a pleasure to drink. the abv is a total sneak, and can really do you in if you arent careful. its not noticeable at all. overall another epic brew from ommegang."

"O: I had tried this one along time ago and wasn’t a huge fan. But now with a more developed palate, I can appreciate this style and this offering by Ommegang. All around this is an excellent offering for this style and the complexity is rather high. It has a high drinkability and has a great finish that works well during a hot summer day."

"As a whole, this is a very nice Saison, bearing all of the common flavors in decent quantity and nuance. The beer does seem slightly more watery than the 7.7% ABV would imply, but at the same time, the relatively high ABV is very nicely hidden, creating a strange contrast. Furthermore, the banana/clove and sour notes slightly overly dominate, especially if several sips are taken in quick succession. Still, this is a very nice beer."

"Pours a dark golden color, chunky white head with excellent retention. Grainy smell, a touch of sweetness as well. Nice delicate spices with a touch of honey. A mild fruity tart profile and dry finish. This is the most popular Saison on BA, and for good reason. It's got a great taste and warmth from the alcohol but remains remarkably drinkable. A Belgian noob will find this accessible without sacrificing flavor."

"M- Thick and velvety for a beer of it's color/gravity/strength but mixing with the taste it just feels gross. It is sticky and slick, lingering on the back of the tongue for some time."

"O - very complex, very balanced, lots of bright fresh flavors"
"Pretty darn good."

"D/O: Enjoyable from start to finish, and I get why so many suggest that this is a great summer beer. Sometime soon I hope to give it a go on a hot summer day. Until then, this was enjoyable, but it's still not something that I *crave* when the weather isn't hot."
"Overall: I think this might be my never-fail, go to beer. I really am never let down, it is both fulfilling and drinkable, and it combines what comes best in so many different styles that it truly is a no brainer if you want a Saison. Do not be deceived by the shelf availability of this beer: it will beat many of the best."

"Overall, this is one of the best damn things that has ever entered my mouth, beer or otherwise - and hands-down the best Saison i've tried (though Surly cynic comes close).

"Picked this up in Buffalo. Pours a bright, hazy, golden yellow with lots of white head. Tastes slightly of lemon and grass, with a faint spicey finish and the typical belgian pale ale mouthfeel. Very nice overall and the alcohol is well hidden in this one."
""
"I'm new to this style and I just LOVE it! I've recently really become a big lover of Belgians and this one is wonderful in that it's not quite as strong, but has a delicious, full Belgian taste and smell. I find it tangy and crisp, not as sharp as an IPA. Perfect with food, not as filling as hefes, great for a hot summer day."
""

"O: This dry brew is easy to drink, easy to enjoy and easy to pour another. The mix of malts and hops with a dry finish makes this a refreshing treat, uncomplicated and straight froward."

"poured into Sam Adams tasting glass. The beer has a light straw color with slight haze and light wispy head that disappears fast. There is a pronounced yeasty nose with a hint of lemon and much less sourness than some of this style. There is some tartness and a minor hop finish. Another fine Ommegang."

"Poured from a bottle into a chalice glass. Pours a slightly hazy, golden yellow color. It was pretty dense appearing and had a good solid, rocky head with good lacing left on the glass. The nose is a wonderful, sharp spicy hop smell, with some yeasty/doughy background. There is a touch of fruit there too. The taste is great with lots of floral, spicy hops and fruit esters. I don’t get the banana some other folks talk about, more of sweet fruit. The palate is lots of carbonation which sort of takes over the rest of the body with a very crisp, dry finish. Overall, a very excellent beer."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, best by 5/13/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear golden amber color with a nice 2-3 finger fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice thick cap that lasts. Some nice and dense soapy lacing clinging on the glass. Aromas of huge lemon, pepper, grass, clove, herbal, floral, grape, orange zest, coriander, earth, light funk, and herbal yeast spiciness. Absolutely fantastic aromas that are extremely balanced with nice complexity. Taste of big lemon, pepper, herbal, floral, orange peel, grass, earth, bread, coriander, slight funk, yeast spiciness, and slight tang. Nice herbal spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, citrus zest, pepper, bread, floral, herbal, earth, and yeast spices and tang on the finish for a good bit. Incredible balance of flavors; with a perfect contrast of the malt sweetness and peppery spiciness. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a slightly slick and fairly crisp mouthfeel as expected. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with no warming noticed at all on the finish. Very easy to drink. Overall this is an absolutely world class saison. Extremely balanced with big complexities; and very smooth to drink. Definitely one of the best I have ever had."

"This is not particularly remarkable, but it's very good for what it is. If you've had any Ommegang beers, you can imagine the yeast profile. Very drinkable and well-rounded."
""
"D - Only my second saison after Unibroue's Blonde De Chambly, and this is worlds apart in many aspects, but still distinctly satisfying in the same way. Also, for a 7.70% ABV brew, the alcohol is masked flawlessly well, a little too well even... Overall a remarkable and tasty beer, and perfect for the hot summer months ahead."

"Medium to light bodied, crisp carbonation; quenching. Very nice mouthfeel. Deserving of its place in the Beers of Fame, I’d say. A lovely saison that pairs very well with food or alone as a warm weather quencher."

"M: lots of activity, yet fairly light. crisp and easy to drink."

"I really enjoyed this beer during a break from yardwork on a hot Saturday afternoon. It's not as fruity on the nose as I'd like, but the flavor is pretty spot-on for this style. Moreover, it's extremely easy to find. Recommended."
""
""
""
"Very easy going down - pairs perfectly with a shrimp scampi. Would highly recommend."
""
""
"O: Pretty good. I've been drinking a lot of Saison/farmhouse ales and this is the worst I've tried so far. I love the style, though."
""
"I'm bewildered by the super-high ratings for this beer. Malty, finishes sweet, closer to a dunkel than a saison. Color is a lot darker and quite clear compared to other saisons. Pilsner malt flavor with other malt aromas I can't place, but not dry, tart, or refreshing. Where are the phenols and character>?Long lasting head and lace. I won't finish a glass."

"Probably my favorite saison to date, and one that I hope to come back to sometime. Well balanced, with a nice flavor profile."

"Overall: Nice, bold and complex brew. The spice dominates the fruitiness here, again perhaps due to the age of this bottle. Even so this is a good overall saison."
"I was annoyed that the bottle said ""product of belgium"" on it but close enough, geez."
""
""
""
"O: This is a beer that I love to get whenever I get the chance. I dont see it too often, but it sure hits the spot. Just an all around great beer."
""
""
""
"O: This beer makes me smile – every sip is just delicious. Complex, memorable, and intense at just the right moments. Every time I walked into the liquor store, this beer was right there; little did I know that Hennepin was just waiting to dispel the rarity-means-quality myth. Grip ‘n sip, my Belgian-beer fans; grip ‘n sip."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D-Not my favorite, but I can understand why this is such a well liked brew. Solid in every aspect but I would not put it among the best of its style."
"O - Pretty much outstanding. Lots of flavors going on and melded so well together. Excellent to say the least."
""

"Another great beer from Ommegang. Highly drinkable and refreshing. Could possibly be a new summer favorite for me."

"Cheers!"

"I dig super bubbly bottle conditioned Belgians but holy crap I have never seen so many bubbles in a beer. It settles after a couple minutes though and makes for a great drinking experience. A solid Saison for sure."

"Hazy copper-orange color with a fluffy white head. Flowery, citrusy, yeasty nose. Refreshing, spritzy mouthfeel. Flavors of lemon, orange, yeast rolls and green apple meld together admirably. Finishes with a bit of a hoppy blast along with a dry tartness. Improves greatly as the bottle warms into the 60 degree range as the nose, flavors and alcohol really intensify."
""
""
""
"Edit: I've had this beer again many times with a good amount of head. I think there was soapy residue in the glass when I did the review"
"O- I'm not too familiar with the Saison style. Having only had Saison de Silly, I was expecting something a little more funkier and out of normal range, but I suppose the Silly is an exception. Overall, a nice brew that I will be enjoying more of soon."
""
""
""
""
"O: hits the marks nicely. All around good drinking beer, it makes feel like I'm in the basement of the thirsty monk in Asheville."
""
"Overall: The first time I had this beer was on tap. It came to the table and smelled like a citronella candle. I've been putting off retrying it for 4 years as a result. Ultimately, I'm sad I waited. This is a damn fine American take on a non-American style. Nice flavor profile with a decent drinkability. Funk is on point."

"Hennepin has an impressive appearance - not just the golden color, of course, but the head, which is massive and long-lasting. Pouring along the side of the glass will not even help one bit - pour slowly. Very nice honey-toned spicy floral aroma. Though there's some raw honey sweetness as well, the taste overall is nice and dry, lemony, and herbal, all very well integrated in the mouth. Smooth stuff. This bottle was brewed in Belgium, the label says. Wherever they wind up brewing the stuff, it's bound to be a classic. This is one of my top go-to beers for special occasions."
""
"O - Quite tasty saison, nice floral flavours, ABV is well hidden and the mouthfeel makes for a refreshing ale. A tasty ale indeed and worthy of seeking out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Despite a few niggles, and the fact that it seemed past its prime, I liked this generally. Not a perfect beer, but I really think a fresher bottle of this would be a significant improvement. Worth a try."

"o - not bad, but not really doing it for me either. goes down easy enough. tastes like a standard belgian pale ale to me. will probably pass on this in the future."

"O: Very tasty, very clean and dry, a quite good saison."
"This a bright yellow almost orange color with a 1 finger fizzy head that fades quickly but leaves some lacing on the glass. Bubbles from the base of the glass. Smell is full of funk with hints of banana and sugar. Little earth and hop tones as well. Pretty good smelling beer. Taste is citrusy with some floral notes. Very dry funk at the end. Taste unlike most saisons but in a good way. Mouthfeel is fairly thin with good carbonation. Overall this is quite good. Will age very well and very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Top tier beer from a top tier brewery. The secondary notes in this beer is what did it for me. Its a proverbial dance of flavors mixed with a solid yeast profile. Its as if Ommegang has been doing this for hundreds of years. Its a sweet nectar. Would be a great summer beer too. Im drinking it in the dead of winter, but this would be a beer garden summer treat. Wow."
""
""
"Overall - Not the greatest saison in the world, but definitely one of my favorites (as is the case with all Ommegang beers). This beer was fantastic, but it was a little too clean for a saison. Probably one of the best American-made saisons though."
"Poured a beautiful hazy orange color with a beautiful off white head. Scent is all yeasty bread and citrus with the taste following closely to the scent. The mouthfeel is bubbly like good champagne and tingles the tongue. This is a good Saison. I would have liked a bit more humph in the overall taste but good nonetheless."
""
""
""
"Overall – A very nice beer. Sour and bitter with just the right fruit sweetness. Well done for a Brett fermented beer."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: One of my favorites for enjoying with a meal. Not my favorite saison but quite possibly the standard on which many great saisons are based. A classic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This was an interesting complex taste. I haven't drank too many Belgian Saison Ales, but I definitely enjoyed this one."
"A top notch brew. Good flavor and complexity while remaining balanced. Could use a little more body though."
""
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the interplay between the crisp and cleaning, and the earthy and the muddy. The flavors are all clean, but blend nicely towards the finish for a more robust and full flavoring collectively. Paradoxically, the flavors do muddle towards this end, but in a nice, balanced way. One negative is that the carbonation is painfully too much. This is a great representation of the style overall."
"As a caveat, however, I will note that the first glass from the bottle wasn’t exciting but when I came to the bottom of the bottle and refilled my glass, now with the dregs and yeast at the bottom of the bottle that my pour definitely had a more vibrant character to it. Is this something as simple as a top vs. bottom of the bottle difference? (+.5 for the dregs.)"
""
""
""
"Well folks, this is about as good as it gets. I mean, saisons can be quite varied; pour this, pour Jack D'or, pour Dupont -different strokes. The body and flavor are so clean, but with a deep, dank nose . . . lemon and hay, funk (of course!), light golden raisins, mmmm. Not too much spicing from the yeast. No cloy. Fresh, refreshing. 7.7%? GTFO. Love it."

"O- The best farmhouse saison I have tried thus far. Perfection in the melding of flavor and feel- the light yeastiness, flowers and spice and the perfectly dry finish make it top shelf champagne in the form of beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Not my favorite Saison but I'm glad I got to try it."
""
"Pours a murky golden yellow with a 1 inch foamy white head that settles to a thin cap. Foamy streaks of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain, spices, and Belgian yeast. There is also a bit of an unknown fruity aroma. Taste is of grains, spices, fruits, and some Belgian yeast. There is a slight funky bitterness after each sip. This beer has a high level of carbonation with a very crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good saison that is very lively and refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall : A great domestic version that could probably pass for a ""true"" belgian farmhouse ale. I would not hesitiate making a reccomadation with this beer. Another winner from brewery ommegang !!!"
""
""
""
""
"Wonderful beer. Complex and interesting. Very enjoyable."
""
"O- A very well done saison that touches the right flavor points, but just isn't my absolute favorite in terms of the style. I would prefer just a bit of a brighter flavor, often found in the more citrusy saisons I have encountered (Jack D'Or is what comes to mind for example)."
"clear honey colored body with a giant three finger tall head. the bright white head slowly settles into a frothy cap leaving plenty of big clumpy lacing behind. smell is sweet and peppery. belgian yeast and hops provide most of the smell. it has a slight funk in the taste, in a good way. nice bready malts and pepper shine bright. has a full mouthfeel to it with great carbonation. creamy texture and a spicy finish make this one of the better saisons out there. i would not think twice about recommending this to someone wanting to try the style."
""
""
""
""
"Overall (4): Light flavours that are exceptionally true to the style and pay homeage to their Belgian roots. A rolling thick head with a spice flavour that lingers in both the aroma and the taste, distinctive of a Belgian yeast production. An extremely drinkable beer that is very likely at the top of its style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I have had this plenty of times before and it is one of my go to beers for this style. You can't go wrong with this beer and very happy now that I have enjoyed another one."

"Note: Bought as part of the Ommegang christmas gift pack.. Well worth it for the price.."
""

"drinkable, but not as excellent as I had anticipated based on its ratings. Maybe I'm just not big on saisons in general, because it seems well constructed, but I don't envision myself drinking another one any time soon"
""
""
"O: Good beer. One of my personal favorite styles. Try this one out."
"Overall, this was a solid saison, and for it's availability and pricepoint it really shines. The only downside is that it could do a bit more to set itself apart."

"This Belgian beer is everything that this style is about. It is not over sweet or over refined. It is PERFECT!"

""

"O - Really nice Saison with a well deserved rep."
"Gotta say, this is a pretty damn good beer. A nice change of pace from my typical staple of IPAs and Imp Stouts."
"Overall: Not a bad beer. Give it a shot if you are a saison lover. I'd wait for warmer weather however. The saisons I've had this winter have just felt so out of season. Cheers."
"O: Very nice. Affordable too, this one misses the 10 dollar mark by a hair."
""
""
""
"Overall - Saisons are always interesting to try out from different brewers and fortunately Ommegang has delivered a solid Saison Ale. It's flavor is nice and complex and while the mouthfeel leaves something else to be desired, it's still an excellent beer"
""
"Poured from bottle into dogfish head snifter. Golden color with huge thick white head and tons of lacing on side of glass. Smells very floral with some citrus notes and cinnamon. Taste is citrus with very mild bitterness. Nice carbonation. Overall this is very nice and easy to drink. My first of this style. Will definitely buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-A wonderful Saison. One of the best out there."
""
"Overall - Considering this is a beer brewed out of pure passion versus hundreds of years worth of experience, it is damn impressive. Rich in color and taste, this is a beer to be revered (it's no wonder Duvel Moortgat bought this out). This is beautifully layered and yet represents the style almost perfectly. A great Farmhouse Sasion."
""
""
""
"Poured from 355ml bottle i ended up with a foamy head due probably to my over vigourous pouring technique. Once it settled the beer is pale and cloudy in appearance due to the yeast sediment. A hoppy crisp taste pleasant to drink, the beer belies its 7.7% ABV. Overall a very good Saison, worth checking out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Goes down very smoothly. Carbonation is a shade high but the flavors meld together masterfully."

""
""
""

"O: this was like a strong pale Belgian - not as sweet and creamy as their Gnomegang, nor as clean-finishing and strong as a Duvel. A good-tasting beer, easily quaffable - might be one of the few beers I preferred while it was a little colder - it had a brisk character that compelled me to take real hearty swigs as opposed to, say, thoughtful sips. Would definitely recommend."

"Drink- This was pretty good and flavorful. More of a sipping saison with big bold flavors and a good balance and feel. I like what Ommegang does. I'll come back to their beers for sure."
"Poured from a brown 25.4 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is alive with fruits, yeast, some sweetness. Taste is very good, fruits, yeast, mild hops, a touch of alcohol, just a bit sweet, very complex. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall this is a top notch beer."
"I give it a good grade for being outstanding on all levels."
"D - I could drink this saison all the time and with Ommegang's great beers being so low priced it's a possibility."
"I've enjoyed many bottles of Hennepin in the past, but this is the first time that I've detected overwhelming sweetness in this beer. Pleasant enough, but far from the best the style has to offer."
"Overall it's a great beer. A little less lingering bitterness and more lingering flavor would make even better, though. Still, for a saison that's relatively easy to find in single serving bottles it's hard to beat."
"Light bodied with generally great carbonation. This beer is excellent and very drinkable. A refreshing beer that goes down smooth. I'll drink it many more times to come, I'm sure."
"This is a solid and clean beer. Do I wish it had a bit more funk? Sure. However, the hopping and dry mouthfeel are so in line with where I want them to be that I don't mind the lack of huge farmhouse character."
"O: Flavorful and balanced. Has some malt character."
"O: Big, big flavors. Love the finish. This is an interesting, complex beer. I liked this much more than I anticipated."
"O: A great beer. Lots of flavor, but a beer that can does not scream for attention."
"I can’t believe I’m just now having this for the first time. I’ve been missing out! Great, great beer here. I’ll be trying all of Ommegang’s beer in short time."
"Carbonation is quite noticeable at first, but dies down fairly soon. A very nice saison, and one of the better ones I've had."
"This is a very good saison. Not as dry as many others."
"The feel is silky and very sharp and the light but robust body just coats the mouth with loveliness. The slightly dry finish keeps me sipping at an alarming rate. Ommegang definitely has a stronghold on the Saison market with this classy and well crafted brew."
"O- The standard of American brewed saisons, in my opinion. It has earned and continues to deserve the title."
"Overall? A great saison. Remarkable that it comes from NY, because this one tastes Belgian all the way. Really enjoyable. If I could get this locally, I would drink a lot of it."
"Overall: The hop flavoring in this one is different. The aroma is excellent"
"This does a great service to the style, a very approachable and enjoyable interpretation, and worthy of its reputation. Glad it's available locally now, this will be a regular go-to of the style for me."
"O- overall a very easy drinking saison. Solid all around - no 5's on the scorecard, but nothing missing either. Exceptional American-made version of a Belgian style. One of my favorites and a staple to keep on hand given the availability and price point."
"Over-hopped, especially for a saison. I don't pick up the hop character in the smell, but it's quite obvious in the taste, and its effects are largely negative. That's really too bad, as what's there underneath that bitterness is quite solid."
"O: a great representation of the style, nice taste and smell, intense head that lasts forever, didnt like the mouthfeel as much as i liked the rest"
"O - Another stellar choice from Ommegang. After trying a biere-de-mars, I didn't think I would ever like anything this dry and earthy. But this is so complex, yet balanced. Very drinkable. I went through the 750 mL bottle way too fast."
"Cheers!"
"O - This has good drinkability. Would have no problem having a few glasses of this in an evening (since I just did). Overall, I think this is a really nice saison. I just wish that it has a bit more funk to it. I think it is definitely an easily approachable example of the style. I would buy again."
"A well made, um, American saison? Heritage and corporate buyouts aside, this is just plain enjoyable, the delicate nature of the farmhouse ale decently ramped up, balanced, and quite agreeable, as the masked booze strength plays up well to the waning summer ethos up here in the soon to be Great White North."
"This is very good, but not as open on the nose as one would like. Has a funkier side to it, but doesn't go the full way. It's a good saison that aims more rustic than citrusy"
"D - Fantastic saison. It has high drinkability and is a relaxing, balanced brew. The alcohol is masked well but is very warming. There is a champagne-like vibe going on which improves the overall experience."
"O- This is a nice Saison that is easy to drink. Overall, I really enjoyed this beer, but I would like it more if the aroma and taste where bigger."
"The mouthfeel is light to medium body and refreshing. A nice Saison!"
"Overall Impression- A very fruity Saison. Easy to drink, has mild spice and sourness but not every brew this style can have these distinctive aromas/flavors. I was expecting more from this one but not bad. Wouldn't go out of my way to get again but enjoyed."
"TheBeerAlmanac.com"
"O: Extremely drinkable and definitely a beer I would enjoy again."
"Overall, I definitely will pick this up again. I think next time, it won't be a five-year gap before my next drink. If you want to start experimenting with Saison, then I don't think you can go wrong with trying this one first."
"a funky and unique beer. not my favorite, but I can definitely see the sense and sensibility in its novelty and respectfully so."
"Overall: Kickass! I can't believe it took me so long not to try this one. Will buy again and again and again. Quite possibly one of the best examples of this style that I can think of for sure."
"Presentation: Packaged in a custom twelve-ounce brown glass longneck bottle, served in a Sam Adams Boston Lager glass."
"The beer is a reddish amber with a cottony white head that sticks around leaving fine lace. The smell is a little herbal from the hops, spicy from the yeast, and bready from the malt. The beer tasted good, but it was definitely undercarbonated which keeps the aromas in the beer and out of my nose, but it kind of also ruins full appreciation of the beer. This was carbonated more like an English Pale than a farmhouse ale. The beer wasn't as fiesty and zippy as the bottled versions of this beer, which are perfectly carb-ed. That said I think this beer develops in the bottle a bit and it might be the micro-oxidiation (along with carabonation) from the bottling process that adds some earthy and fruity flavors I remembered in this beer that was not present."
"Taste is clean and bright with a smooth mouthfeel. Yeast, malt and hops work in perfect harmony here. Confirmed once again as one of my favorite saisons."
"Not as great as, say, most saisons actually from Belgium, but overall still quite good."
"Pale straw gold fairly clear with a careful pour however the head is crazy, even with a slow pour I get half a glass of foam, and it doesnt appear to be going anywhere. A lot going on in the nose with this one. It is dominated by yeasty esters like bananas and cloves but there are also lemon and peppery spice as well. The taste is classic saison. Fruit, spice and clean crisp grain. For the fruit I notice lemon and other citrus the spice is mainly light pepper and a bit of clove and that is all rounded out by nice pale malts. The mouthfeel too is good. Lively carbonation with a super dry and clean finish that manages to leave a touch of sweetness that invites the next sip. The alcohol is well hidden but does sneak up near the end of the glass. Overall a very good example of an often under respected style."
"O: Can't believe I've never even tried this before, what a treat. Available year round and reasonably priced, this one is going straight onto my go-to list. Definitely recommended."
"O: Smooth drinking saison with some nice flavors."
"Mouthfeel is a little dry and chalky. Overall, this seems OK to me. Maybe I didn't get the best bottle; it was on clearance."
"Light to medium bodied with decent carbonation, this beer has great drinkability. The carbonation is not overly apparent and does not cause the beer to fizzle when held in your mouth, but it is just strong enough to help push this beer along. The body is not coating and sticky nor light watery, but sippable and gulpable."
"A great saison, sweeter than some, and without a strong musky-farmyard flavor, but still lively and bright, and with lovely citrus and peppery notes. A pleasure to drink."
"Overall: I very much enjoyed drinking this beer. It was very refreshing, and affordable; I would easily imagine myself getting this beer again."
"O - If I'm in the mood for a saison, there are four others that I would choose in front of this one. Just ok."
"D-Great session beer especially for the summer months."
"Smell is fantastic. Spice, grains, fruit, pepper. Really well balanced, and really excellent for the style. Taste is amazing for the style. Same profile as the nose. It amazes me that a beer this refreshing and balanced can pack a 7.5% ABV wallop. Mouthfeel is really smooth and balanced- not much more you could ask for here. Overall, this is probably the second best Saison I've had, and the best from the USA. It's priced really well, and I can't recommend this one enough if you're looking for a Saison."
"O- It really doesn't get much better than this in it's style, or any other! I am in love with this beer, always have been. Light, refreshing, fruity, tart, bready, spicy... It's hard to believe that this is brewed only about an hour and a half away from me, and not half a world away! Take a bow Ommegang... you deserve it."
"An excellent brew!! I had thought that perhaps this would be more suited for a cooler month, but this seems lighter and more summery than some Saissons."
"Overall: A tasty and refreshing Saison. Enjoyable stuff."
"Best Saison I've tasted this year. Highly drinkable but with a rich set of flavors. Shows a good Saison doesn't need the excess of acidity and random bacteria so often encountered."
"Morey's Bottom Line: This is good...really good, but I don't know that it's quite as good as Lavery's Liopard Oir. Don't mean to be a homer, but that's just my opinion."
"O: Good, refreshing beer that might even be sessionable if it weren't for two things. 1: the alcy in this is higher than you'd think and 2: the carbonation makes you feel bloated."
"O: A great example of a refreshing, crisp saison that works amazingly as a summer beer. It can even be aged for a few years, which I think would be interesting to try"
"Interesting flavors. The toastiness adds some uniqueness but I wish it had just a tad more hoppiness to it to make it more distinguishable from a hefe, especially when sediment is added in."
"O- Pretty standard example of a saison, good but not great. I like this better from a bomber."
"O: Really quite good, and very easy to drink. I appreciated all the flavors in here, but there isn't too much complexity in here. I'd say the flavors are even fairly homogenized, but it doesn't really matter. This a very clean representation of the style, and it most certainly should be had with food. Stir fry, steamed greens, and light salads would do awesome here. You wouldn't even need to put pepper on your salad -- it's already in your glass."
"Sour out."
"A really fantastic saison. This might be the classic, benchmark, standard for the style--and I wouldn't argue the point."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. It is quite creamy and smooth in the feel. Very easy drinking with a low alcohol impact despite the conflict of listed abv on the label. Regardless if it is 7.5 or 8.5% abv, it drinks like it is half of that. Exceptionally balanced, this brew has gone through quite a transformation I actually enjoy it more with age on it than a fresh offering. Nice."
"Mouthfeel is full, but the beer is exceptionally dry. After the swallow it just vanishes off the tounge and you're ready for the next sip. Perfect on a hot day like today. Very refreshing."
"Overall- I can't think of a better example of the style. It's like reading the style guidelines for a Saison word for word. If I was stuck on an island and could only choose one beer for the rest of my life...it might be this one. The yeast flavors don't really hit Saison head on for me...and I think they might dry it out with the sugar rather then a traditional Saison yeast...but it just all works so damn good together."
"Certainly, this is not bad, but I'm evidently not part of the adoring crowd this beer has. Frankly, I gotta be honest, compared to the ""best of the worst"" of the macro-brews, stuff like Leinie's, Rolling Rock, I cannot say that Hennepin is better than those beers by an order of magnitude."
"This is just a really solid local beer for me. Brewed in the same casks they used to brew duvel in as they were shipped over to ny from belgium. Some people get turned off from this beer do to the very floral smell and taste and high alchohol. Side note this beer makes me sleepy if i drink it early on in the day."
"HENNEPIN GOES FOR THE WIN AND HENNEWINS"
"D- This is a good saison, there is some nice complexity but I would like it if the hops were a touch more subdued and the yeast flavors higher."
"prost!"
"Pours a bright clean hazy golden yellow with a fist of head that settles to a steady 1 finger reach. Smells of big citrus, lemons, orange peels, grapes, bananas, with the familiar Belgian yeast flavors, loaded with lots of spice characters. Pale banana and citrus malt fill the tongue, nice mild cloves and ginger spices float around. Light on the body, medium carbonation, leaves the mouth slightly bitter with a nice zesty dry feeling that begs for another delicious sip. This is a wonderful saison that can be enjoyed anytime of the year, everything works on this beer. Total home run. cheers."
"This pours a yeast hazy light yellow / straw color with a large white foamy head which ends up being about a finger in width and leaves a slight lacing. The smell is of belgium yeast esters, a little clove and citrus. The mouth feel is light to medium with lots of carbonation. The taste is complicated, its yeasty sweet at first, citrus, lemon, and then it ends with a nice slight hoppy, spicy, peppery, dry finish, very refreshing. This is actually my first Saison and I love it, this is much more of a good summer drink for my tastes than the SA / Brooklyn summer ales. Good stuff."
"O- This saison was pretty good, although too much spice and pepper and no detectable funk made this beer a little bit of a disappointment for me. A well-crafted beer that I enjoyed, but not quite what I was expecting."
"A very delicious brew. Not as interesting as I had hoped- by that I mean I wished perhaps for more spice and funk. But it does show consistency with my other Ommegang experiences- delicious and approachable Belgian-style brews with an unbeatable price-point being domestic and all."
"I really enjoyed this beer. Very easy drinking. Hides the alcohol well. I like the style and this is a great example. Will definitely have again. Highly recommended."
"M - light and very carbonated"
"O: A very nice saison. Big on the yeast and solid on the citrus."
"Overall-Good beer, not outstanding. A little too sweet on the finish to drink that much at once. Could use a little more hops. Still a good beer that I would drink again."
"overall i think this beer is an awesome summer quencher it proved to me there are good domestic examples as well"
"D-overall this was a nice saison. Had nice earthy yeasty flavor as long as good citrus flavor. Very easy to drink. I dont no how much i will seek this out again but wont ever turn down having a glass of this one."
"D: It's as good as sunshine. The overall balance of the brew is dialed in to perfection. Definitely did not disappoint Ommegang!"
"D - Exceptionally crafted. Quite possibly one of the tastiest beers I've consumed. Highly recommended."
"Is it my favorite style? No. Is it good? Hell yeah."
"This beer pours a slightly yeasty golden color with a finger of white bubbly head that doesn't retain terribly long or lace much. The aroma is somewhat weak with the usual banana and spice notes, as well some earthy and floral hops. The taste starts sweet with banana and moves to some spicy notes and finishes with some hoppy bitterness. The mouthfeel is very well balanced and finishes clean. Overall a great saison."
"This beer pours out as a nice looking hazy golden yellow. The head billows and needs to be given a moment to settle. The smell of the beer has a decent amount of funk to it but it's not as much as some of the authentic farmhouse ales out there. The taste has a pretty good amount of malts and yeast with some spices in there too. The mouthfeel is drinkable and has plenty of carbonation to keep it alive on the tongue. Overall this beer is pretty good but not my cup of tea really."
"Overall, great representative of the style."
"O: Ommegang's Hennepin is the quintessential American-made Saison. It's great summertime drinking, and is balanced enough to put back year-round. Worthy of most hype and worth seeking out."
"This is most likely the best saison I've had to date. Smooth, flavourful and extremely refreshing; this stuff would be positively dangerous outside on a sunny day at 7.7% ABV. This bottle disappeared; too bad there was only one."
"Light to medium mouthfeel that finishes very crisply. Very drinkable. Light enough to enjoy on a hot day, yet would be flavorful enough to combine with a meal."
"Mouthfeel: Light bodied and extremely well carbonated. It goes down easy. I could imagine coming in from a hot day of working out in the yard and being perfectly refreshed by this Saison."
"This beer pours a golden color with a huge white head, and tons of carbonation continuing to make its way up the glass. The smell is floral with hints of citrus. the taste is a little spicy with some fruit notes. the mouthfeel is right on light with high carbonation and a nice crisp finish. overal this beer is a solid A"
"Pale yellow, transparent, a couple of fingers of head, and lots of carbonation. A bit of citrus and some yeasty smell. The taste to me has a tart sour apple flavor followed by a peppery spice that adds to its complexity. I didn't expect this complexity when I first saw it poured. It finishes a little dry and has a nice and light mouthfeel. The alcohol is hidden well and I could drink more than one of these in a sitting. This is a perfect brew for this 95 degree day. Overall, I'm really digging this saison style. So far to me, this is the benchmark of the style."
"This is a very easy drinking summer beer. Get one ASAP."
"o - such a light refreshing easy drinking beer that the high alcohol content doesn't come through until the last third of the glass. perfect for a 102 degree MN day. i will definitely drink this beer again."
"Overall: This is my first Saison and I will say it sets a good standard for what I will expect pushing forward."
"D - Good drink; great summer beer; nice beer for food pairings, could be a bit filling after a few"
"overall an exemplary saison and an enjoyable drink for a hot day."
"A truly delicious and assertive saison, putting others to shame."
"Note: I just found a 750ml bottle of Hennepin that was brewed by Ommegang's parent company Duvel in Belgium, and was going to re-review this. No need, these notes still capture it. Amazing that this can be brewed in two distinctly different locations with the same results. The mouthfeel and carbonation is slightly better from the bigger bottles, but it is close enough where I wouldn't oppose the 12oz ones."
"D: After a bit you do notice that this is a fairly strong version. Still, it is easy drinking enough. Just too strong to be a quaffer. Best had with food – the lemon tartness would cut flavors well and cleans the palate. Rustic and hearty."
"A nice and fresh saison. Very nice with cheese and sausages."
"O: Overall, a good American saison. Nicely attenuated so it's not too sweet with a good mix of spice and light fruit flavors."
"Overall, this is a terrific and well balanced saison ale, and well worth trying. Perfect beer for someone looking for a kicked up, Belgian style wheat ale in the summer."
"One of the best Saisons I've ever had, and that's saying a lot considering its brewed in NY. The fact that this is available year around means trouble for my wallet, as I'm sure I'll be buying tons of it in the next few months. Can't recommend it enough."
"Overall I'm a little confused with this beer. It takes like a blonde bock to me. Flavor notes along with the smell are pretty flat. It's not bad and is a decent spring type beer. But I'm just so confused with what it's trying to achieve cuz it's just so simple. It kind of tastes like it's a homebrewers first attempt at the style."
"O: This is a really nice Saison/Farmhouse Ale. Light crisp and refreshing. Not overly musty."
"D - highly drinkable as I do like the style."
"Pours a hazy golden color with a nice white head that retains and laces well. Yeasty aroma, with hints of citrus, grass, and light spice. Biscuity taste, with flavors of orange zest, apple, banana; grassy with notes of spice. Light-medium mouthfeel, and easily drinkable."
"Wow what a nice suprise packet this ended up being from knowing nothing about it to being in love with it and it pours a very pale straw hue almost like a fine Crystal champagne with beautiful carbonation that leaves behind a frothy two and a half finger head with heaps of lacing,the smell is very spicy with hints of white pepper,corriander,lime and citrusy hops,and the taste is just as good as it looks which starts off with spicey citrus zest,funky tart white fruit,a tinge of boiled candy and finished off with a nice spicey,hop dry finish which leaves your palette wanting more of it and overall for me a truly unique tasty drop that will buy more of before its gone,impressive."
"even with a 750ml bottle I found myself smelling an empty glass before this review was typed. This one went down very fast and every sip left me wanting more and before I knew it there was no more to be had. Big Thanks to liamt07 for sending me this beauty,it's not every day I throw down an ""A+"" and this one deserves it."
"Very drinkable beer. Had this on my balcony on a nice summer night in Florida and it hit the spot juuust right"
"Light, crisp, and bubbly mouthfeel. Overall, one of the best widely available saisons around. Nice balance of funk with the rest of the flavors."
"O: Well I have to say this is one of the best Saison's I have tried and I have tried many. True to type. Did I mention that this beer is just spot on delicious!"
"O: Maybe not the best saison I've had, but certainly belongs in the conversation. In fact, I'd say this is the best of style available in Nashville for what it's worth."
"Pours a nice hazy yellow color. The head on this one is the best I've seen on a Saison/Farmhouse. Thick, creamy 3 finger head that sticks to the glass. The aroma is spot on. Ripe fruit comes to mind first, kiwi, bannana, green apple, and peach. You also get some nice bread/dough flavors in there as well. The taste follows the nose almost exactly. I love the fruit you get with this beer. There is a slight funk that is going on too. Musty like flavors on the finish. Overall, I loved this beer. Right up there with my favorite saisons."
"Overall, this is an excellent summer time brew thay can become dangerously drinkable. The comination of flavors is balanced nicely and rubs me the right way."
"O: Quite drinkable in spite of the sweetness and prominent booze."
"O: a delicious saison, and very drinkable. It pairs nicely with a grilled hamburger."
"D: the alcohol definitely is evident on this one. not so much in the taste, but more on the brain. at 7.7 this isnt a shocker. overall a great drinker and a great example of the style."
"O: Well done. I'm new to saisons, but I know each saison can, and IMO, should, have it's own unique characteristics. This one seems to be simple, subtle, unobtrusive."
"O-i found that the belgian spiciness makes this not very drinkable. I like it in other belgians, but in this the taste gets tiring. this is pretty much an average saison that i don't feel is great for the style. i wouldn't recommend this to people more accustomed to the style, but that's just me."
"(12oz bottle). Pours somewhat hazy light yellow with massive chunky white head. Carbonation is quite active. Aroma has hay, grass, wheat and lemon. Taste is sweet malt, but the hop bitterness is more pronounced. It’s a bit spicy as well. Light to medium bodied witha slick texture. Finish is dry and reminiscent of lemon peel. This is a refreshing and easy to drink beer with a well hidden abv. A good beer."
"Overall: A very good version of a Belgian Saison."
"Overall - what a fantastic beer, one of the best i have had in awhile, so complete and so well balanced."
"D: Can't taste the alcohol at all, which is great for the 7.7% ABV. It would be easy to sip on a cold bottle of this for hours."
"O: A nice farmhouse ale. Belgian yeast plays a large role and it is drinkable, dry and clean."
"I hate reviewing this style as they all seem to take on such different characteristics. There is always a hop/sour effect but after that it seems like everything is fair game. As a result all I can say is this one of the best I’ve had with the style, but I believe the results can still be far better."
"O - Really, really good saison here. So easy to find and reasonably priced. Really my ""go-to"" saison."
"Great beer. I can see why this is an A. Served around 54F."
"Overall: Wow, freakin delicious. I have no idea where the 7.7% ABV is and could easily drink a bunch of these. Aroma is inviting, taste and mouthfeel make me want to drink more and more. This is a very sexy beer that everyone should drink...if you don't like this, you don't like beer!"
"Gorgeous body of hazy gold or hay. White sudsy head that leaves lacing. This is a beautiful looking drink. Aroma of floral notes, citrus, a spray of lemons, soft honey, and wheat. Flavorful: citrus, lemon juice, wheat, some table sugar, hops come thru towards the finish complimenting the light fruit with some dry and bitter. Esters of banana and clove appear and bring subtle booze along as an aftertaste. Medium bodied with zappy carbonation and a slight cloying of flavor. A great Belgian-style saison with refreshing flavor and well executed booze and mouthfeel."
"D -- Solid pickup, worth a purchase and a repeat. I would gladly set this in front of me on a nice warm day."
"Not very experienced in Saisons, but found this to be a tasty, well-crafted brew. Particularly enjoyed the aroma."
"The corked bottle opened with a wonderful POP! I was very excited to try this beer and it poured a gorgeous hazy straw yellow that prevented you from seeing through the glass. The aroma was less complex than I expected and was yeasty and floral. The beer was notably carbonated and bubbles played on my tongue with every sip. However, the flavor did not have much depth and the only aftertaste was about a second of sour on the very tip of my tongue. The brew was enjoyable but will not be placed on the top of my list."
"Pours a glorious straw-yellow. Big, gravity-defying white head (at first) then settles down and washes the glass splendidly. Many tiny protein particles at the last pour. Smells great too; clove, citrusy herbs and spices. floral notes. Tastes great too; a bit of mineral on top of the aforementioned lemon-grass. Mildly hopped, bitter finish. ""Heavy"" for such a lite-looking brew. Alcohol is a tad warming. Great brew here, a classic indeed."
"I haven't had all that many Saisons but this one explains why they're becoming one of my favorite styles of beer. Smooth, crisp, refreshing, and tasty; perfect for nearly any occasion. I'd definitely buy this againa and can't wait for my next Ommegang brew!"
"Overall, this is one of my favorite Saisons and, to me, is the best of the ‘must tries’ that I’ve tried. Hennepin has continued my interest in the style and shows how the beauty of Saison is in simplicity with so many variations."
"Overall this is quite tasty but this doesn't feel like a saison at all, most saison's I find real polarizing and this is more into simpler Belgian pale ale territory with sweetness. I do admit though I like it, I would tell people to start here for this style before grabbing something like a Dupont or god forbid a Fantome for a first time saison drinker."
"very bland and boring for me and just does not taste very good."
"This beer pours very nicely into a glass. It has a yellow murky look to it. There is not a lot of smell to the beer, but what it lacks in smell it makes up in taste. There is a slight sour taste with some citrus hops added in. There is a decent after taste of thirst quenching juice like flavor. Great as a hot summer day beer. Cheers."
"12 ounce bottle poured into a tulip glass. Beer pours relatively clear, with some minor yeast particles present, though that's not unusal for the style. Good carbonation and a nice big head top the beer. Aroma is tart and fruity with damp straw underneath. Taste is honey sweet - almost surprisingly so - followed by a refreshing lemon dryness. Crisp light cracker malt can be found in the middle of the beer, with a light peppery phonolic finish that's dry and leaves you wanting to drink more. Mouthfeel is effervescent and somewhat sticky, kind of like a sticky soda. Overall a very solid example of the style and better than I was anticipating."
"Mouthfeel is clean and energetic. Overall, this is a highly enjoyable beer, although a little on the expensive side to be sessionable. Recommended. I've also had this out of the 750ml corked bottle, and this might be sacrilege but I enjoyed it slightly more this way, it was sharper...or perhaps that particular 750ml had been sitting on the shelf a little long...I don't think this beer should really be aged too much, it's a little low on the abv and heavy on the hops for that."
"O: Big flavors that I found very drinkable. I would prefer to drink this on a hot humid day. This really blew me away especially since the style is usually too over-spiced for me."
"O: I was slightly let down by this one. But that doesn't mean it was a bad brew, infact, it was very good. I guess I was expecting a little more complexity and a little more originality. But still good, and worth the try. Skal."
"Served from tap into a sampler shaker. Poured a slightly hazy straw yellow with a one finger pure white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt and banana. The flavor was of sweet malt, banana, and spices. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall thiswas a pretty decent and easy drinking brew. It was not overly complex, but still pretty nice for the style. I had this one a long time back and the spices just overwhelmed me. Really glad I re-visited this one. If it were more complex, this one would definitely be great. Definitely worth trying without a doubt."
"Very nice beer. Went well with the sushi!"
"D - Fantastic overall saison. Well balanced between the uniqueness of a saison and the sweetness of the malts and fruity esters. While the alcohol is not noticeable it takes effect pretty quickly. I would definitely get this beer again."
"O - I am pretty disappointed by this one. It just played it too safe with the funk. Maybe the bottle was a bit older, and the flavors settled a little?"
"Overall this is one my favorite year round brews. I mainly drink this in the spring and summer though. A great representation of the style!"
"Overall I say what a wonderful beer! Cheers!"
"D= a beer you can drink forever if you enjoy a Belgian-style beer. Beats Blue Moon out of orbit, for your pseudo-""craft"" BM drinking friends. Grilled or steamed fish (fried oil might disguise the enjoyment), poultry, seafood, popcorn, most anything non-red or dark. Aside from the tart-dry tongue that might put some people off, it's superb. Answer? Keep it flowing so you don't have time to have a dry tart mouth!"
"Overall this is a great beer to savor and my wife and I will probably split another one in the near future. I am just really looking forward to how this BA recipe with Hennepin is going to turn out! I will post a review of it later!"
"O - A beer that truly stands up to its Belgian friends and is definitely one of the better American copies of the genre."
"D: Very complex flavors kept me coming back for more. Overall I was not blown away, but did enjoy the beer and style, must revisit in the future."
"Ommegang Hennepin has a slightly-cloudy yellow colour and a big 4 cm head that fades to excellent lacing. The smell is mostly grains, musty yeast and a hint of hops. The taste is grainy and a little fruity (apples). The aftertaste is buttery, bitter and crisp. I'm not used to tasting Saisons so it's a little new and strange to me. This beer is foamy and strange, but very nice."
"Beautiful pour into sniffer glass. 3 fingers of white head with great retention and lacing. Smell is great - Belgian yeast, honey suckle, sweet bready malts, alcohol esters. Taste is solid with a very dry crisp finish - champagne like. Overall, a good brew, but for some reason I can't finish more than one. I've had a few saisons and prefer Stillwater."
"O - Very nice crisp, clean smell and taste with depth and balance. I'll surely buy this again."
"Very good overall. Hennepin is a great beer and goes fantastic with a meal."
"Overall, this is a great beer that manages to be refreshing while still being pretty robust in flavor. A good one to sip in the summer, and the most affordable Saison anywhere around here, as it comes in 4-packs."
"No complaints about drinkability. This goes down easy, but the taste is less than totally impressive so it doesn't compel me to drink another one or two. Good enough that I would probably buy another one for a tasting party or a nice meal though."
"D- A very easy drink, alcohol is not felt, all in all i was suprised by the quality of an American take on this Belgian style. Its no Fantome but its a quality Saison."
"It's not bad, reminiscent of other belgian-style ales. I would not call it one of my favorites for the style, but it certainly isn't bad. I'll probably have it again in the future."
"The reveal - Ommegang Hennepin. This is a very good beer and I'm now realizing I've been neglecting it. For a readily available saison its very good and doesn't kill your wallet."
"For drinkability, simply see the above."
"This is a beer that should truly be enjoyed by everyone who can get their hands on it."
"Body is a bit heavier than I expected for the style, but not overly heavy by any stretch, still a light and lively saison. So tasty and crisp, I wish I picked up more than four of these, will have to make another trip to NY again soon!"
"Overall: Saison beers might be my second favorite type. They frequently have pleasant complexion without being very heavy. Ommegang delivers with Hennepin ale. It has great flavor, nice body, and would be a perfect addition to a warm day (or a setting sun)."
"Poured a light hazy yellow with a huge pure white frothy head that was fully lasting and had extremely excellent lacing. The aroma was very heavy of an earthy yeast, and a moderate odor of straw malts and a citrus hops with notes of banana and some spices(clove I think). It tasted mildly sweet and yeasty with a slight acidic tinge at first and ended with mildly bitter yeast flavor and had hints of citrus, and other spices with the flavor lingering on the palate for a nice while. Mouthfeel was light to medium in body and watery yet dry and quite creamy in texture with a flat carbonation. Overall an exceelent representation of the style and a brew most definitely worth drinking again."
"Taste - medium intensity with a sweet finish. Carbonation remained consistent throughout drinking. It ended with a drying mouth feel."
"D: This was a solid saison. Sour and bitter with a little sweetness (but no funk) all nicely balanced and blended. Great body too, and well hidden alcohol, so it was easy to drink. Not too unique, but an enjoyable example of the style."
"Overall, Ommegang once again shows why they rarely disappoint. The Hennepin is a zesty, refreshing example of the farmhouse style. When the spring weather warms you NEED to have a bottle of this."
" I haven't had many saison's, but I can say with confidence, that this is an excellent example of its style, and one I will repeatedly return to."
"M, D- Delicious, very drinkable and alluring. Lovely balance."
"This is my first time experiencing both this beer and this style. I found it to be highly drinkable and look forward to drinking this and other saisons in the future."
"Overall: A great representation of a great style. This is without a doubt one of the better American Saisons out there."
"I had this first on tap at Fire and Vine. Excellent was the first word that came to my head. It was amber with 1/2 inch of head, lots of lacing on the glass. Fruity aroma that made me want to dive in. First sip brought a smile to my face, my wife isn't as into beer as me, but I had to share. Since then I found bottles at the local Total Wine shop. This is one I will always look far again."
"D: Not bad. High carbonation may limit consumption."
"Purchased at Beer Crazy in Urbandale. Pours a lightly hazy brilliant blonde color, with a big loose head that diminishes to a smaller slightly tighter head. Scents range from spicy hops to sweet bannana aromas. The taste is fantasically balanced with dry hop bitterness and some fruity esters. The palate is lightly sharp"
"M/D: On the lighter side with nice carbonation. Very easy drinking and overall enjoyable. While I really like it, its not something I will reach for often."
"D: Probably one of my most favorite beers now. It reminds me of some of the trappist dubbels. Very refreshing and the citrus is just awesome."
"D: Goes down extremely easy and really evolves as it warms up; I'm very impressed with this one, especially after sort of discounting Ommegang based on some of their other offerings I tried. Well worth the pick up, and from my experience, would be worth some time in the cellar."
"D=Great. Hidden ABV, sits lightly in the stomach, good taste make this an extraordinarily drinkable beer."
"Drinkability: Very chuggable, refreshing, easy. 7.7% is not noticeable. Only problem would be the linearity of this beer. Might get tired of the same sourness/tart apple taste running throughout. Otherwise, outstanding. Easily the best saison out there."
"D: This is terrific drinking, one of the best in its style, and widely available."
"D- This beer is a fantastic example of the style. A nice drinker which I always enjoy. The ABV is high but this beer doesn't really drink like it. I really like beer and need to pick it up more often to be honest."
"Pours a cloudy yellow with a fine white mousse head. Aroma is of clover honey and white pepper. Taste is fruity and wet stone. Mouthfeel has a decent body. As this is a farmhouse ale, I paired this with a French Altantique cheese and a rustic baguette -- magnificent!"
"This is not my type of beer (and it sat in my fridge for a while before I tried it), but gotta say, this is a keeper and will definitely pick this one up again."
"This so far is the only Saison that I would buy again."
"hennepin was suggested to me when I mentioned to my local beer store clerk that I had had a farmhouse ale the other day. Honestly I was just makin conversation. The farmhouse ale I had wasn't that great. However the ommegang hennepin isn't like the other one I tried. It's light years beyond the first farmhouse ale I tasted. It has a beautiful gold color with a hint of haze. The initial bite is like a strong german beer but it quickly wanes into a mild, smooth earthy taste. As far as saisons go this is the best I've had."
"D. Bring on the summer work and keep these nearby and you'll be a happy camper...if you like the type than this is your beer."
"From the tap, Hennepin poured a sunshiny gold color, slightly hazy, with a spumy one-centimeter head. The first sip left a strong impression of pears that receded with subsequent sips, unraveling a sparkling apple cider note with a trace of soapiness and lichen on the finish. For having so mellow a flavor, the beer was surprisingly crisp and thin. In fact, I would have preferred a slightly heavier feel, but perhaps my opinion was swayed by a craving for warmth on a chilly day in February. Well, I found it thoroughly drinkable nonetheless and look forward to sampling it again when springtime rolls around."
"Overall I really do not care for this beer, it is too sharp and lacks all the depth of flavor and character that I love in saisons. This is the fourth time I have tried this beer an I have never enjoyed it, I think I'm done giving it chances."
"Overall, a fantastic beer. Cheers!"
"Golden cloudy appearance with very nice lacy head. Pours nice, but pull back on the bottle at the last second to hold back the sediment. Really nice floral smell. Yeasty spicy flavor done right, with pure satisfaction in the finish. Snappy mouthfeel thanks to great carbonation, and very drinkable. Overall a superior beer."
"Bright yellow with a faint haze and some floaties. Maybe a hint of amber. Thick, frothy white head. Smells earthy, spicy (cloves), and somewhat medicinal. Hints of alcohol. Taste has some light sweetness upfront, more earthiness and spiciness, and a phenolic character. Light, herbal hops on the back end. Finishes incredibly dry, with some faint lingering hops. Mouthfeel is medium and a bit soapy. Huge, prickly carbonation. Very drinkable."
"Taste upfront is tart with a nice sweet finish. Very good mouthfeel. Crisp, tart, refreshing ale. Alcohol definitely warmed me up with every progressive sip. In spite of the higher ABV, this is a VERY drinkable ale. Very good lacing along the insides of the glass. This is a very good saison from Ommegang. Paired very well with some spicy curry. Definitely worth a try if you like this type of ale."
"Had this on tap. Poured a slightly cloudy straw yellow with active carbonation and spotty lacing. Served in a fluted glass about 14 oz. Peppery spice with banana and clove on the nose that leads to a nice peppery forefront and sharp bite on the palate. I just ate onions on my sandwich though. I feel a faint grape like mouthfeel in the back and finished spicy and slightly alcoholic. Overall a nice beer to have with any occasion."
"D: As with the style (again, more wit beer than Saison), it's light, crisp, and delicious. This is quite easy to drink, though it's on the high end (7.7ABV)."
"drinkability; delicious, get better as it warms, would drink quite a few of these."
"D - Huge drinky on this. Lacks in some spots but extremely refreshing and tasty."
"M: My only complaint is that it feels a little thin. This may be a product of the keg that it came from but it is still highly enjoyable none the less."
"D: Crisp clean and very nicely built beer. Love the flavors and the subtle Belgian funk. Would highly recommend this one to anyone as its easy drinking and at a reasonable price point."
"Poured from 750ml bottle into a heavy chalice glass. Pours a nice golden color with a sticky, thick, dish soap suds/divinity type of head. The head leaves fantastic lacing with big clumps of head on the sides of the glass. Aroma has a slightly skunky hallertau hops note with a bit of soured fruit and a really nice farm funk. Flavor is fantastic with a great sourness melded very well with a farm funk, light lemon citrus, pils grainy flavors and a light vanilla at the end. The beer feels very smooth with a great density for the style."
"Overall this is great. Really enjoyed this one. Great nose and some very balanced but complex flavors. Will be picking more of these up."
"This brew was so fucking good I went back the next night for another....and more taquitos."
"D: Pretty good, although the high level of carbonation may limit its drinkablility somewhat."
"Nice offering from Ommegang."
"Not the best saison ive had but good. Glad I can get it easily"
"The CPJ"
"This beer tastes like typical Hennepin. It really doesn't taste much different than fresher batches I have tasted in the past. It is still extremely drinkable and lighter, something I have come to expect from this beer. It's kind of cool to see how this beer compares to a newer vintage. On second thought, the beer has gained more of a champagne-y taste, a very delicate balance of sweetness, bubbles, and a little dryness. Very cool. Glad my neighbor had the patience to age this one."
"Drinkability - I would rate this beer well on drinkability. With everything going on from smell to flavors, it was really nice. Yes there is a decent amount of alcohol to it, so it is not sessionable, but it was very tasty."
"D - Due to the persistent bitterness, I wouldn't say this is an enjoyable ale/"
"d: pretty high. I'm a big fan of saisons because of their complexity and fairly easy drinkability."
"Hennepin was yellow-gold in color and hazy. It had a large rocky white head with good retention and lots of lacing. The smell was yeast and spices (clove and pepper). The taste was yeast flavors and spices with clove, pepper, and citrus. It had a long, dry, and slightly bitter finish. It was medium bodied with medium-high carbonation. Drinkability was very good. Hennepin is a good Saison that is crisp, refreshing, and well worth trying out."
"Drinkabilty - Its just strong enough and alcohol is up enough that 1 or 2 is good. Very tasty for the style, one of the better farm ales ive had."
"A very nice American-made saison. One of the better ones out there."
"D: this is an awesome beer even at the price; plus its available pretty much everywhere. I must say I would go pretty far out of my way to get a hold of this one if I needed to."
"the mouthfeel is a prickly medium bodied beer. It is very drinkable and I find it greatly enjoyable even so that this style of brew is not what I usually drink. A great brew which I defenetely pick up again and a brewery which I will try more from."
"I feel kinda guilty not giving this beer all 5's. I see why so many love Hennepin so much. This is one spectacular beer that I will come back to frequently."
"Overall it's a nice, drinkable Belgian, without breaking the bank."
"D: Decent, but an cheap awful aftertaste in my opinion."
"D: Bought a keg of this for New Year's Eve to go along with Michelob Ultra. Group was BMC drinkers for the most part but they were all adventurous and stepped out of their comfort zone. It was a huge hit with everyone says it was so much more flavorful yet refreshing and light."
"Drink - I was really impressed with this beer and I'll be sure to pick up some more the next chance I get. It was delicious and highly drinkable."
"The body crisp and sharp, with a nice semi-dry finish. Drinkability was excellent, as is typical for the style. Overall, this is a very nice example of the style and is certainly worth seeking out if you haven't already."
"This one is an easy drinker. I like that they kept it fairly simple. I will definitley go for this one again."
"D: A nice saison. I just wish I chose a better time to pop it than New Year's Eve."
"Drinkability: Absolutely."
"D - Very high. I absolutely love this one. It is funky yet still very re-freshing. One of, if not the, best american saison on the market today."
"D- Amazing, was sad when bottle was empty. Very nice Saison, good offering from Ommegang. If you like Ommegang or Saisons, it's a must try."
"Poured into a wheat glass, while pouring it slowly the enormous three finger head went all the way to the top of the glass. It has a very nice light yellow color. Not very cloudy actually quite clear besides all the yeast sediment that was floating around. I read a few reviews and no one really mentioned this. I hope my bottle wasn't tainted. The smell is a very nice yeasty balance with some nice citrus to it. has a nice hopness aroma in it as well. Taste is an amazing acidic but nice citrus taste. has a good balance of bitter and sweetness to it. its very bubbly in your mouth so it is a nice warm feeling. As for drinkablility, i would say this beer would be best served on a warm day with a nice grilled burger. so it is highly drinkable, and very enjoyable."
"D- Quite drinkable. A very approachable Belgian."
"The flavor is much more mellow on tap than from he bottle. The flavor seems to have more room for subtle flavor to rise up. Bubblegum, funky yeast, sweet grain and a rich fruitiness come through too. Over all a great saison. Mouth feel is good and drinkability is high. "
"Overall: I have really been looking forward to trying this out, as it has received some pretty great reviews and is something that isn't available where I live, but I was really let down with this. HOWEVER, I should note that I think I opened the bottle too soon after taking it out of the fridge. The second glass that I had was better than the first, and some of the things that I look for in a saison (biscuity, spicy, funky, and citrusy) came out slightly as it warmed. Even then, though, this was like a light saison, if such a thing existed. I would certainly recommend serving this closer to room temperature and will if I decide to pick up another bottle."
"Overall it is a very good beer that I am going to have to keep in the fridge. My wife is gonna love this one."
"Pours light yellow with some cloudyness, huge head, couldnt pour the whole bottle into the glass. Head is pure white. Smells citrusy, floural and grassy. Tastes great! yeasty, wheat, malt with a little sour, bitter and citrus. Mouthfeel is light and bubbly. Cant really taste the 7.7 abv. Delicious! I will be drinking this again and again and again."
"Drinkable and refreshing."
"This is the first beer I've tried from Ommegang. Let's just say I'll be trying the others...."
"Drinks GREAT. A wonderful beer! I want more!"
"This beers a bright hazy yellow color with a monsterous lacing head. The smell resembled a skunk. The taste is complex, mellow at first the a huge rush of flavor. Very nice to drink no weird flavors, but it seems like most people dont like saisons so they may not like this one. Overall a really good beer, great example of the style."
"Beer poured a cloudy pineapple juice color with a massive white head. Aroma was sour apple, yeast, ginger,coriander. Peppery. Taste was light and spicy with subtle umami on the aftertaste. Fruity and tart with a light hoppy finish. Mouthfeel had high carbonation. Light spicy texture was champagne-like. Overall an excellent and highly drinkable beer. Lively and refreshing. Complex and satisfying."
"D: Overall, a very good beer. It's actually scary how drinkable it is for the alcohol content. A six pack of this could make for a very good, or very bad, night."
"Drinkable. Almost too drinkable."
"Overall, a very nice beer. I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it. I am not sure if my grades do it justice based on style, so I just graded based on how I enjoyed it. Give this one a try!"
"Pours hazy light straw with a lively 2 inch head. Dry citrus and yeast with a bit of earthy spice. Carbonation really crackles across the tongue and mouth and drinkability for me is quite high. This was one of the first saisons I ever had and is my fall-back saison when availability or wallet contents is an issue."
"I had several goblet's of this great beer at a local German restaurant several weeks back and I have to say I was very impressed with it (hence the several goblets). I reminded me of my favorite saisons from Saint Somewhere. I would definitely order again when I see it on tap somewhere."
"A simple beer to drink. It tastes good and provides a crisp feeling as it goes down. Despite the spices and high alcohol, there's no burning whatsover, it actually seems to cool you. Would make a great beer for warm or cold weather."
"D - I could drink a lot of this, especially on a hot day. Now I'll know better for next summer."
"Pours a yellow golden haze with life. Has a medium foam head. Has a belgium spice aroma with hints of citrus and bananas. Has more carbonation then other saisons I have had. Gives it a creamier feel. Has a sweet grassy taste with a slight bitterness. Very tasty. I did not remember this brew being so good. But my palate is a bit more experienced then it was the last time I tried it."
"drinkable, but im feeling one and done right now. ill definatly come back to this. top notch saison, but i do prefer just a touch of funk IMHO."
"drinkability is good - one of the few saisons sold in 12oz bottles so that adds but i do question how true in taste is it"
"Tasted fruity with cleansing effervescence and bitterness at the back of the tongue. Light bodied with a crisp finish and momentary soft sweetness of alcohol along with some dark fruit like malts at the end. Slightly warming. Good drinkability."
"Kinda reminds me of Duvel in some ways (which makes sense), but I couldn't get into this one much. Feels too boozy and just heavy and uncomfortable when it reaches your guts. Flavors that were present didn't really leave me wanting more."
"Pours hazy golden with a lasting foamy head and much lacing. Aroma is of piney hops, yeast, biscuit malt and some pear. Medium-full, crisp body. Yeast, sugar, biscuit malt and piney, earthy hops nicely balanced on the palate. Long, dry finish. Very nice, rustic brew"
"This is a real aggressive saison. I can tell it's extremely well-made, as Ommegang doesn't mess around when it comes to making good Belgian beer. I was a little put off by the rather strong alcoholic character, but perhaps that's how it should be. I admire the complexity and adventurous quality."
"Definitely worth pouring this slow to get the right pour out of it. Very pleasing beer and will be buying another one in the near term."
"Notes: Another good offering from Ommegang."
"Drinkability: Probably the most drinkable Saison I have had yet. A refreshing treat for the warmer months to be sure."
"Overall: Very good beer overall. I would recommend giving this one a try."
"hands down i could drink this stuff all day long"
"Notes - A really flavorful and complex saison that's not afraid to be different or take a few chances. Luckily, those chances pay off."
"Pours a deep golden color with a white soapy head and great lacing that never goes away. Smells of coriander, orange or lemon zest, and a lot of booze. Tastes of lemon peel, a warming alcohol, hop bitterness, and coriander and black pepper. Mouthfeel is really nice and has a high drinkability."
"D - Drinkability is high. A very slight alcohol bite at the end is the only reminder that this is a 7.70% beer as it drinks almost too easily. An excellent offering from Ommegang and a great representation."
"D - Quaffable to say the least. Very enjoyable drink. Goes down easy and tastes great. This is a fantastic brew, light, refreshing and crisp. Easy to drink yet complex. Really must be tried. The best saison you can get any day in any good store."
"Wow, taste is bursting with citrus and fresh bitterness, lemons and lime are here. There's a good bite of spiciness from the yeast thats nice as well as some cloves and ginger and even a bit of pepper. Mouthfeel is really huge from the carbonation, maks it seem like a Belgian tripel. Overall really solid saison."
"D - Very drinkable, even with a fairly high APV and complexity of the flavors."
"Poured an almost clear golden yellow topped by a fluffy crown of white head, providing excellent lace and retention. Bready, sweet tones with just the right combinations of lemon zest, clove, coriander, and white grape without too much funk like many saisons. Taste was even more impressive, with all the aforementioned flavors and a champagne-like dryness, especially in the finish. Clean, light-bodied in spite of the abv, and bubbly, it accentuated the flavors nicely- I wish it came in a bigger goblet there, because I had to take small sips to really enjoy it for all it's worth."
"Overall: A nice example of an American saison. It's the the traditional componets. Lemon, spice, pepper. It's easily drinkable and enjoyable."
"Super drinkable, especially for the ABV. This beer is one of the all stars of the American brewed Saisons and one of my favorites. I am not sure if the 12oz. bottles are a new thing, or if I had never noticed, but I am pretty excited to be able to enjoy this beer without finding an occasion where a 750 ml. works."
"D/O- At 7.7% the drinkability gets dinged a notch because it's such a distinct taste. I don't think anyone would want any more than one or two of these. That being said, those one or two would be the best looking, if not the best tasting beers one would have that night. Another winner from Brewery Ommegang."
"This beer appears to be a hazy golden color with a coarse white foam head. The beer smells of pears, crisp red apples, sour white grapes, mango and slight cinnamon notes notes. The flavor is a mixture of old champagne, slight flavors of orange, and grapefruit and some peppery notes in the back. This is a nice complex beer and it's not too harsh on the sour which is one thing that I tend to avoid as far as the style is concerned. The mouthfeel is a little too carbonated for my liking it is quite prickly in nature. The remainder of elements for the mouthfeel are rather nice still. It drinks well, it was the right price, not a bad Saison for my money."
"The appearance of this beer is quite fabulous. It's crystal clear and the entire vessel is teeming with effervescence. The color is a light shade of yellow. The head is huge and white, containing a plethora of bubbles. As it fades over an hour or so, it coats the glass in sticky lacing. The aroma is of spices, straw, grass, lemons. The taste is better than the aroma, with notes of lemon grass, orange zest, clove, lemon, straw. There is a subtle, spicy kick in the finish. The beer has a nice feel, with an above average carbonation level. This is a great saison, and from the United States, no less. I definitely recommend it."
"D - I enjoyed it but it was strangely more of a sipper than something i couldn't put down, which is unusual for me when it comes to saisons. I think the balance was slightly off. Overall, I enjoyed it but its not something that I would look for in the future. I think I was hoping for something else, probably something comparable to what I've had in other saisons (in terms of balance at least). Perhaps its just a different style saison, perhaps I need to branch out a little more. A good beer but not a great."
"Takin' another swing at this brew. It pours a hazy pale straw topped by a solid finger of white foam. The nose comprises wheat, coriander, and lemon zest, with a touch of minor caramel in the very, very back. The taste follows along a similarly-landscaped path, though there's more wheat and a touch o' relatively minor funk hanging around the corners and edges and whatnot. And when I say minor, I mean AA, maybe even A (who doesn't love watching a Dunedin game, am I right?). The body is a very light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a somewhat dry finish. Overall, a nice, solid saison, not my favorite of the style but pretty good nonetheless."
"D-very good, don't be scared by the 7.7, everything here is in wonderful balance"
"Serving type: bottle"
"Perhaps the most salient feature of this ale still is the consistency of its quality. I've been drinking it since 2003 and am continuously impressed with how steadfastly it meets the expectations."
"I know Hennepin is a good beer but I will just have to taste it again from a bottle because this table tap experience was not very good."
" A pretty drinkable beer, I would say bust it out for a back patio summer day with friends and classic rock. Value was alright for a bomber got this for 8 with tax. A good price for a good beer."
"d- Drinkable but I couldn't do a lot of these."
"D- Moderate- Easy enough to drink but just not in my wheelhouse. A good beer but not for me. So it goes."
"Taste is subtle. Very nice, and very refreshing. Slight hop spice, lemon, honey, and clove are the main players. Everything works well together. Very crisp mouthfeel with prickly carbonation. Very nice brew, and one of the more drinkable beers I've ever had."
"Poured from bottle into Ikea beer mug. Poured amber gold with a hint of orange with a thick white head. A creamy, yet strong, citrus smell. A very flat front, with only a little bit of citrus taste coming through. Creamy mid-palate and finish, with an aroma and taste that reminds me of green apples. Leaves a slightly bitter aftertaste."
"Fine carbonation tempers the rich, creamy texture for a perfectly balanced mouthfeel."
"D: Residual sweetness keeps the drinkability score average. For me, a bold saison such as Hennepin is a sipper, and a seldom one at that."
"D: A really complex beer. Thirty minutes into it I was still picking out new flavors. This could be the best saison I've ever had, and certainly one I will compare other to."
"Poured a light hazy gold with a big head that took forever to die down. Bouquet is a big wallop of citrus and spice and the flavor holds the same as well as some fruitiness and malt. And it all blends together seemlessly. And just like their Abbey Ale I'm simply amazed I can get this at Trader Joe's for around the $8 range."
"Overall Ommegang does well in their saison offering."
"Conclusion: I wasn't as impressed with this beer as I had hoped to be, but I have limited experience with this style, so I may simply not be able to tell why it is rated as high as it is."
"Drinkability is fantastic, this is a great summer beer. Very drinkable, very refreshing, not filling at all."
"Quite drinkable, but lacks a bit of complexity and flavor compared to the better Belgian examples. Originally I would have excused this based on value, but over the years Ommegang has gone up in price making me less inclined to choose their offerings over those that are the source of their inspiration."
" Amazing beer, especially since this is an American brewed Belgian style with the yeast complexity to die for. A rightous value to at only $5.99 for 750."
"D - Very much. I like Ommegang and this didn't disappoint."
"D- If this was lower in ABV I would drink more of it. Either way you gotta try this."
"Scott"
"Drinkability: Quite delicious and quite possibly the best saision I've had to date (granted, I haven't had many). Thoroughly enjoyable and something everyone should try once. Truly a classic in the style!"
"Pleasant, tongue-curling dryness is straight to style, begs for another sip, making this a solid, enjoyable Saison. I am biased as this is my favorite style, but this is a solid standard. Takes a slightly drinkability hit because the strength doesn't keep it sessionable, however I'd not hesistate to give a full bottle a try."
"A very full mouthfeel from all the carbonation but a beer that at the same time finishes very dry. These make this a very easy to drink beer. Great stuff."
"The carbonation splashes these flavors deep into my tongue, impressing upon me the urgency of this flavor. I will never doubt a saison again.."
"D - I generally like saisons so I feel I could drink this pretty easily. However, I don't know if I got a bad bottle or something, but the bitterness is really overpowering and unpleasant. I'll have to re-visit, I know this can be better then this."
"D: This is a extremely drinkable brew, great tastes and aromas, while still being light and crisp. Good hidden ABV and I am craving another one."
"Overall: Despite the solvency and slight metallic taste, this beer is very drinkable. Most of the flavor comes through AFTER drinking and in the after taste. This would be a great beer for an October evening at a bonfire or barn party. This bottle could have been aged a little long. It was still a great beer!"
"Saison is my favorite style of beer. I am very passionate about it. So take this review with a grain of salt; I am a Saison nerd. I haven't tasted Hennepin for a few years until tonight, yet it is just as poor as I remember it being. I can't understand how people think this is a good Saison. if you like this beer then I implore you to check out better examples of the style."
"I love hennepin, and have enjoyed other bottles as much as Fantome and Dupont, so this bottle was a semi-letdown, which is rare for ommegang, great brewery."
"Overall- This is the best american made saison. Looks great, tastes great, and you could definitly drink a few of these."
"d- really nice, this is a great beer that i would definately drink again. very nice for non craft beer drinkers, i shared this with family and it was enjoyed by all."
"Perhaps I should buy some saisons that are actually brewed in Belgium and do some comparing. But I was certainly surprised by the restraint of my first beer of this style."
" I've been impressed with everything from Ommegang, but even moreso this. I honestly can't think of a better beer on a hot summer day..."
"forgot that duvel owns them now...but i wont hold it against them!"
"Poured from the bottle into a flute glass. Beautiful straw, yellow, carmel color with a big, creamy white head. Lacing hung onto the glass all the way down. Smelled like a typical Farmhouse Ale/Saison with it's earthy aroma. The taste was a superb, complex blend of some spice, malt and fruitiness. The mouthfeel is quick with the dry aftertaste that is unique to this style. Incredibly delicous beer. I have to admit I was very pleasantly surprised by what I was drinking. :)"
"D- Could drink quite a few of these, although it would eventually catch up and do damage from the abv. Very smooth and refreshing. A simple taste for me, but would definitely try again."
"Not my favorite saison...by far. I think this might be an issue of personal taste. I won't be searching this one out again."
"Extremely drinkable in warmer weather due to sheer refreshingness. If they weren't so pricey, i'd have no problem drinking this very often."
"Cheers, enjoy this well crafted Saison. Put on some good music and you will have no doubts about why this is Ommegang's best seller. I would definitely enjoy this beer every day of the year, but it's something special when summer is turning into fall and you're surrounded by different pumpkin infusions...but you choose this beer over all of them."
"http://1yob.com/post/1032386343/hennepin"
"D: Dryness and complexity of the beer are a great combo."
"Notes: Nice saison with a good balance and mix of spice, sweetness and bitterness. Very easy to drink and quite refreshing. Definitely recommend trying this at least once."
"Still a very drinkable saison."
"D: Excellent brew. This is a good Saison to compare others to."
"Everything about this beer leads me to believe that it is highly drinkable. I do not foresee any problems finishing off this 750ml bottle by myself. I except to feel the effects of the ABV by the time I'm finished, but this is the kind of beer to enjoy at home on a warm afternoon/evening. I'd recommend this beer to any fan of the style."
"D-this is a well balanced and delicious saison. it tends to lead more towards the wit but still seems to have hints of that summer funk in the back. tasty summer ale!"
"D- All in all a quite good saison. Not the best one I've come across, but it lived up to they hype. Very drinkable at 7.8%"
"Bought a 4-pack of this after a recent beer-rut. It's a great example of this style, and one that I would recommend to anyone needing something to excite their taste buds again. The pour was good - a nice, golden/oragnge body, with a thick, 1.5-inch head. Smell was citrusy, sweet, and of yeast and clove. Taste echoed that, with more pronounced yeast notes and a sweeter finish. I could drink several of these on a hot summer day."
"D: I could drink this all night long. Great drinkability. At 7.7%, this will beer will get you feeling good pretty quickly, without sacrificing taste."
"Drinkability: It isn't too heavy or thick, and the flavor completely outweighs the alcohol. I would drink this as often as possible."
"The mouthfeel is on the lighter side with carbonation being high. Drinkability is good, it's an easy drinking, refreshing and very good tasting beer. The spices and the citrus meshed very well together in it and made for a very good beer."
"D: Very nice beer and very drinkable."
"Yeah, Hennepin is a favorite of mine in any form."
"Very drinkable especially for the style. Very good job Ommegang!"
"d - An ok saison but nothing amazing. It smelled pretty good, but thought the high carbonation and the alcohol in the taste hurt it a bit. No funk anywhere either. Would try again but wouldn't really seek out."
"My first sip of this glorious beer was on-tap and it was slightly better IMO."
"D- another beer that I could drink quite often. Drinks easy. The spice might ware on me but to sit down and enjoy a few would be no problem."
"The most over rated beer on this site imho. I'd have to revisit to make sure I didn,t get a bad bottle or something."
"Fairly high carbonation and a full, creamy mouthfeel. Wonderfully balanced flavors of caramel followed by orange, spice, and a long floral finish. Pleasant, refreshing, and somehow light despite the interplay of full flavors."
"First time drinking this and I will definitely be buying more. Good place to start if you are trying saisons for the first time."
" This is a real aggressive saison. I can tell it's extremely well-made, as Ommegang doesn't mess around when it comes to making good Belgian beer. I was a little put off by the rather strong alcoholic character, but perhaps that's how it should be. I admire the complexity and adventurous quality."
"Very drinkable, but overall this is not quite as amazing as I expected."
"D_Pretty damn drinkable especially for the ABV. Not my favorite saison but good to throw in the mix now and then."
"Pours a light golden color with a big pillowy white head. Smells of orange, warm yeasty bread, and some sweetness. Light, bready initial taste, with a sweet citrus finish and some very subtle grassy, floral and peppery phenols. Mouth feel is just a touch thin with a moderate to high carbonation level. I don't think this is the most amazing example of a saison, but it is consistently good and usually serves as a nice standby for me at restaurants as it's neutralness seems to pair well with a wide range of foods."
"D: A clean and crisp beer. Great for appetizers or just an everyday beer. I'm not a fan of this style, but I really enjoyed this."
"D - Meh. A serviceable brew, but not something I will bother having again, as there are too many better options on the shelf."
"Poured from the bottle into my Duvel tulip. Light appearance with nine finger fluffy head. The head stayed forever. Smell was bright and lemony. Taste was light to medium with a bit of citrus. My first farmhouse saison didn't disappoint. Mouthfeel was light and spritzy. Easy to drink and delicious."
"D: I really enjoyed this one, it's complex yet still light enough to drink several of."
"I dunno, you could just go buy 6 SN Kellarweis or something for this price."
"Pours a cloudy pale yellow with a nice head and a bit of lacing sticking around. Smell has a good bit of earthiness along with some spice and a few Belgian-yeast esters. Quite pungent; a bit more so than the taste. Mouthfeel is very nice with a crisp carbonation and and nice dash of citrus/earthy dryness. Drinkability is very, very good; really wish this was sold in 4-packs around here."
"Ommegang got me into craft beer, and this is another great offering from them. My first saison, it has me craving more from the style. Great beer."
"Drinkability - Excellent. Finished my 12 oz in no time. A little more bitter than I anticipated but this is a strong brew overall. I've only tried a couple of saisons, so I don't know too much about them. You can't really go wrong with most of Ommegang's offerings... Delicious beer at a decent price."
"Taste is somewhere in between a wit, hefe and saison. Has plenty of yeast esters but not really all that funky or bright like a DuPont. One of the better American renditions for sure, but the malt seems a little sweet and not grainy enough, while the lemon feels more like an American wheat than a saison. Hop bitterness is spot on and provides a nice cleansing on the palate. Tough love I guess, as saisons are one of my favorite styles and tend to grade harder. I like it, but feel like it lacks a bit in personality and farmhouse funkiness. I'd like a yeast with more personality, less sweetness and some more raw grainy aspect."
"Drinkability is pretty high, but the ABV is a little high and will hit you before you get tired of the beer."
"drinkability- i could drink these for ahile."
"Drinkability - very drinkable, Im in love"
"pours a hazy golden yellow color with a big billowing white head that recedes slowly.with some nice lacing..smell is fruits and citrus some spices some cloves its a nice bouquet..taste is apples and pears with a citrus and slight lemon tart hit with a banana and clove slight hop hit..mouth feel was medium and very crisp full of flavors in a well balanced saison ..very drinkable and a pleasure to have abv..well hidden"
"DRINKABILITY - Complex flavors, strength and price make this one a winner. Constructed almost perfectly, delivers powerful product, this was a highly enjoyable experience."
"D- its amazingly drinkable and approachable to a noob. Great stuff at a great time."
"Drinkability: This is just a hell of a good beer. It has that ""big beer"" feel, but its still refreshing. Its really good anytime and with almost anything. Look for it in the 12 oz bottles-- not that you cant down a 750 alone, but they're a much better deal."
"Pours opaque straw gold with a dense, dense puffy white head that eagerly leaves lacing all around the glass. Initially smells like rock candy, and then the more familiar Belgian saison yeast. Fruity and floral with a small amount of farmhouse notes and vanilla. Tastes great, haven't had this in a while. Fruity and sweet with a clean malt bill and mild hop presence, dry but could be plenty more for the style...again there is a vanilla like candy thing going on and I can only imagine it is from the yeast. The more I drink this the more I think that vanilla thing is actually just some phenol type flavor. Wow great mouthfeel, awsome bottle conditioning by ommegang, other than the fact that this beer is almost 8 percent (and you can't tell it is) it is highly drinkable. Love it."
"Out of the few Saison's I've had, this is definitely the best, which makes me look forward to more of the style."
"It seems to spin on the tongue and then go down smooth. A well carbonated beer that feels really light going down."
"Drinks: like summer. The floral nose and enticing spicy flavors really agree with my current palate, and the sweetness of the beer is dialed in perfectly. An unexpected treat from Ommegang."
"For a brewer who puts out Abbey Ale & Three philosophers, this was extremely disappointing."
"A firm carbonation supports this Saison from start to finish, offering complex yeast and spice notes though less so in the fruit arena. Light and well balanced overall, dry and powdery. And again, a different and superior animal to its draft cousin."
"Wonderfull appearance. All rocky and vibrant head and pale effervescent beauty. the smell is dominated by the malt and some alchohol with little to no contribution from the hops. The taste is sweet but not cloying, as it is wonderfully balanced by the mild hop bitterness. there is almost no flavoring hops. Just a little bitterness to keep the sweet maltiness in check. The body is pleasant and satisfying, medium mouthfeel. There is a faint hint of alchohol, but is not too astringent. this beer is very drinkable and goes down very easy. this is interesting scice this is a 7.7% beer ( a litlle to strong for a saison). It is stilla very wonderfullly balanced farmhouse ale that is a very good interpretation on a beloved style."
"A very nice, rather big saison. Bold flavors and a smooth, fluffy mouthfeel. A perfect summer quencher and a nice change of pace from the typical summer ale offerings. After recently tasting their Three Philosophers quad, I'm really enjoying Brewery Ommegang. Fairly authentic American takes on Belgian ales."
"D: Carbonation limits the drinkability here, but altogether a great summer beer."
"D: wonderful, absolutely wonderful beer"
"This beer is so well-balanced, I could easily finish one bottle and go back for more. A wonderful interpretation of the style."
"D - the body makes this quite drinkable, though I do notice the 7.7% alcohol."
"smell is of citrus and spice and all things nice (sorry)... i'm noticing pepper, and some floral notes as well. in the taste i get coriander, clove, lemon, spice and malt. pleasant warmth from the booze. light to medium mouthfeel, somewhat high carbonation. definitely a nice, very drinkable saison."
"I consider this the best of Ommegang's offerings. It is a very strong showing for American Brewers doing the Belgian thing. An added plus is that this beer is easy to come by in the states (north east at least) and is a fraction of the price of some of its Belgian counterparts."
"jd"
"Poured from 750 ml bottle into a Unibroue tulip. Sudsy, foamy white head with nice retention. Soapy lacing. Body is hazy, lemony yellow. Aroma is a wispy mix of pepper, lemon, hops, grass and funk. Taste is fruity, funky, lemon zesty and delicious. Maybe the best domestic interpretation of the style? Maybe. Just great."
"M/D: It is well balanced with the carbonation. Crisp and clean, very thirst quenching. I could drink this again...nice beer."
"D- a great beer, I see what all the saison fuss is about. A great buy."
"Overall, very good, I love SD so I love this by default, but for my money I'd probably choose SD bc it's cheaper. Just being honest. Still very good. Perhaps if they tried undercutting SD they may sell more."
"D- this is my frst brewery Ommegang tasting and I am impressed. Hennepin is such a detailed crafting of the saison style that is ridicuously enjoyable. The ABV is so hidden as well. I am going to become a facilitator of the style by always having these bad boys on stand by. Great job Brew Omm!"
"Fairly long pour needs to be done in two stages. The first attempt results in a massive rocky white head that takes its time subsiding before I can continue. Haziness lends a bit of depth to its pale straw hue. Nice lace. Very pretty looking beer. Creamy mashed banana aroma; peppery, medicinal phenolics; and floral hops. I get a whiff of lemon and hay in the background. Lots of over-ripe banana in the flavour too, also quite peppery with a little bit of lemony tartness. Musty and earthy, when it gets close to room temperature. Noble hops and a mildly bitter finish. Medium bodied with a enough carbonation to keep it feeling light in the mouth. Has a little bit of warmth from the alcohol. Just a little. You barely notice it's there. Very approachable and easy drinking. I found myself having to consciously think about pacing myself as I drank it. Though it may sound odd, it reminds me of a hefeweizen in some ways and a tripel in others, and thats not a bad thing."
"For most States, this and Dupont are the only (or at least easiest) world-class Farmhouse Ale to get your hands on. Do it, you'll be glad you did. Then look for more."
"Overall, a very enjoyable beer, especially in warm weather. Readily available and high quality."
"A bottle from Wegmans that my mom brought back to Ontario for me... thanks mom! Pours a hazy pale yellow with huge white head and lots of lacing. With a careful pour, the head was still bigger than the beer. Smells very yeasty with grassy hops. Nice bitterness in the taste with the Belgian style yeast. Has some spicy sweetness to it too (that makes sense, right?). Great carbonation level and delicious."
"D- This is an excellent saison and will definitely be in my cellar from now on. Finished the bomber over a couple of hours and enjoyed this one to the last sip."
"D - More drinkable than most saisons. As rich but not as filling as most saisons. Typically one or two saisons is the most you can drink. I could probably drink the full 4 pack of these. This is a REALLY solid brew. Best saison I've had and that says something because I'm a big fan of saisons, even in my young days of beer drinking. Stellar as ever, and another fantastic release from Ommegang - one of my 5 favorites breweries in the country. Will be getting this again."
"Overall, a great warm weather beer and a nice way for someone who hasn't traditionally been a fan of the style to jump in. OK, it's not a ""real"" Belgian in the same way a Padron Anniversario 1964 isn't a ""real"" Cuban...but in the end, do you really care? This a great offering, no matter where it's brewed."
"Medium body, with moderately high carbonation. Maybe a tad drying on thge tongue, and has an evident warming characteristic. Overall, a refreshing beer with some nice complexity. Not something I would usually drink, but made for an enjoyable change of pace."
"Overall, this is a solid, solid beer. I love saisons and this did not disappoint! That said, I still give my edge overall to Saison Dupont; as I feel they are a bit more clean overall in the smell and taste especially. I would have liked the warmness of this beer to be a bit more subtle. In the end, still loved it and would enjoy again and again..."
"D - Easy to drink and hides the ABV pretty well. I got a little bit of the alcohol bite at the end but it wasn't very noticeable. A little high to be sessionable but it is a nice beer that I could enjoy during the summer even at the higher ABV."
"D: I could slam these until I pass out. Delicious."
"Extremely happy with how this turned out. At $9.49/4 pk it's not a steal, but well worth it."
"(D)- A wonderful Saison. Granted, this is not a true belgain; but its one of the best American-made of the style. One of my most favorite summer beers to enjoy. It is crisp and refreshing. A great example of the style. One of Ommegang's best offerings in my opinion."
"The feel and drinkability are amazing. Like freshly-squeezed orange juice. Hard (as in cider) but not entirely soft in the finish. Slowly warms you up and mellows you out. Wonderful."
"D - Very drinkable, very refreshing. This beer is gonna make me re-evaluate the style..."
"D: This beer is perfect for drinking while cooking on the grill in the middle of summer after mowing the lawn and playing fetch with the dog. It's perfect for drinking on a cool night. The alcohol content is low enough to make this a beer you can sip all night, and everything about it is enough to make you want to sip it all night."
"Outstanding. Very drinkable. A must have. I laughed, I cried, it was better than Cats."
"This is an excellent beer, and deserves all the high praise it receives. Looks great, and exceptionally tasty. A great Saison ale."
"D: goes down like a glass of lemonade on a hot summer day. This drinks way too easy for a 7.7% brew. Maybe it's the 30+ degree weather in Daytona? Either way, Hennepin is a satisfying Belgian-style ale. Worth a shot."
"Drinkability: perfect for a warm summer day but I probably could drink this beer all year long, well constructed."
"This is one of my favorite saisons and I drink it regularly. Interesting flavors and moderate alcohol level does the trick for me. Never have a problem finishing a 750 ml bottle."
"D--7.7% so not a session beer, but I could drink this all day. Just perfect anytime of year. I could also see it as a great food pairing."
"D/M: Good carbonation, tickles the tongue. Very crisp and refreshing. Overall a very good beer."
"M: Highly carbonated, somewhat thin body. Very refreshing with a clear and crisp flavor and feel."
"D- All I can say is I could drink quit a few of these, cause Belgian style beers is my 2nd favorite type of beer, cheers to all my New Yorkers who brews such a wonderful Belgian style beer."
"Good outing from one of America's most consistent breweries."
"Very good saison, nothing too out there in the flavor department, just a well flavored, balanced and easy drinking saison..."
"D: For an American interpretation of a Saison, Hennepin is probably the best and most drinkable of any I have tried to this day. An excellent beer and a benchmark of the style."
"Drinkability: Complex and refreshing - one of the ultimate summer beers."
"D - I enjoy this beer a bit more in the bottle but this was great on a warm spring day - it was made for it with crisp full flavor and I was sincerely glad I got to try it again on tap"
"Flavors are dominated by citrus sweet and sour, however my first reaction was something distinctly Caribbean.For me this can typically mean spiced rum or coconuts but after a bit more exploration I realized it was a very noticable plantain flavor. Keeping with the Caribbean theme (which is very subtle)there is a creaminess which combined with the pineapple flavor reminds me of a classic pina colada. Despite the appearance of a creamy texture there is a Champagne-like sharpness which makes this Saison extremely dry and refreshing."
"D: This is extremely drinkable. I would certainly have another and will make a point to seek this out when it is as hot as the Devil's Oven in the middle of the Michigan summer. This beer makes me excited to try many more Saisons."
"Body is light and bubbly, it works well for the style. This beer couldn't be any more drinkable. Fantastic."
"This is my first from Brewery Ommegang. They clearly know their stuff, and I look forward to other items from their portfolio, but I don't think I'll get this one again."
"No complaints here!"
"This is very very drinkable. I enjoy the refreshing aspect of this beer. It is one to be enjoyed on the porch during a 75 degree day in spring."
"D- A great one to drink when drinking more than one on the hot, dry days of summer. A true outdoorsman."
"D: The alcohol isn't hidden as well as I anticipated and the sheer complexity of this beer makes it almost a chore to drink. A very enjoyable chore, but enough work that I think one bottle will tide me over for a while."
"D: Good. Makes an excellent pairing with food: light enough to not clash with the food, but crisp enough to clean the palate."
"Overall there's nothing exceptional about this beer except how well all the flavors complement each other. A quintessential saison done by a great US brewery, well worth a shot."
"Final Words: This beer is worth a try for adventurous beer drinkers."
"Definitely worth having a few bottles of this in the cellar at all times. Very nice beer."
"D: Really good."
"Drinkability is great, normally I would only give a 5 to a hopbomb, but I could easily drink a gallon of this and feel great."
"Impressions: Not bad, pretty interesting low-brow tasting brew. There is some interesting funkiness in the taste of this beer. It's pretty bold though, so some people may dislike it. Fans of IPAs should try this."
"D : 2-3 of these is nice. It's as close to a ""light ipa"" I could consider."
"D: The ale nails every aspect, sweet and dry, sharp but lush. It's been my favorite for years and this growler is no exception."
"Given the high reviews that I have seen of this beer I was expecting it to be much more flavorful than it ended up being. Although it is a nice beer, it was a bit of a let down when it came to flavor."
"Notes - Good mouthfeel and carbonation level"
"I can definitely see why this is so well liked."
"Drinkability: The smooth transitions and robust elegance of Hennepin make it a drinkable model brew for the category."
"This is truly a great Belgian-style ale brewed right here in the Northeast. Excellent value as well."
"Drinkability: Very good. There is a lot happening in this fine Saison. It's been a few years since I've had one so I'm glad I picked this up."
"goes down well, definitely true to the style."
"Mouthfeel is dry as I can imagine with ample carbonation. This was a great, refreshing beer for outside on a hot day. Not sessionable, but certainly quaffable."
"D: This goes down smoothly and easy to drink, even on a hot summer day. I could coast through a bottle quick but I don't think I would have more than one of these given the alcohol content."
"Such an easily appreciated beer, at a great price, and that can be offered to those not in-the-know. A lovely beer that I far too often overlook, despite having offered it many a time during a weekly beer tasting at the liquor establishment where I was previously employed. Always a treat,never to be disappointed by this Belgian-styled beauty. Ommegang is always on point."
"D= Non-session beer for sure. It hides its somewhat high abv all day long. Easily enjoyed during many different seasons of the year and goes great with spicy food. Farmhouse saisons are becoming one of my new favorite styles. Great job ommegang."
"Crisp, clean mouthfeel. Alcohol sneaks up on you here, not very noticeable at all until the end. Overall, goes down easy and definitely a quality saison in my book."
"Excellent Saison, excellent beer. One that I should have more of."
"D - I type pretty fast to give you an idea of things... and while typing this review I've killed off the entire beer except for a mouthful without really realizing it. I can't get enough of this beer. Very high drinkability obviously... well until the near 8% ABV sneaks up on me. Cheers."
"Overall Impression: This is a beer I've had several times, but I have never been overly impressed with it. It's a good beer to drink on a hot summer day, but I can think of many others I'd rather drink in its place. That's just my opinion. If you look elsewhere, you'll see that this beer is very highly rated. Judge for yourself."
"Drinkability - again, very much like a light beer. While I enjoyed drinking it, I was let down by my expectations, come on Ommegange, you can do better."
"The 7.7% abv is what prevents this beer from being a 4 or even 4.5 in drinkability. This beer is easy to drink and not too hard of the wallet, but I'm a light-weight and I always will be so drinking too much of a 7.7% beer is just out of the question for me."
"D: I love this beer. I need to go buy more. As summer approaches, I can see myself sitting out on my deck on a cool MN summer night drinking a four pack of this lovely brew. I will be purchasing more."
"Flavorful and easily enjoyable, it retains its character well."
"7.7% abv = The perfect number!"
"D - Drinks very nicely. Refreshing, alcohol nicely hidden."
"Very easy to consume and improves quite well with warmth, so take your time and espouse your views with leisure."
"Great smell, banana, citrus, bready. Unbelievable taste, just enough funk/sour to give it an amazing character. I've never had a beer quite like this, can't wait to have another."
"Classic Saison. Easily the best widely available domestic version of the style. Pours cloudy golden color with a big fluffy head. Smells very fresh and inviting. Tastes even better. Fruity notes and soft yeast and grain flavor. Super tasty and easy to drink. Cannot get enough of this stuff. A must drink."
"Notes: Outstanding Ommengang offering. Great saison and a remarkable reinterpretation of the Belgian style."
"A grainy malt dominates the palate. The high alcohol lvel is masked very well; the yeast leaves a funky taste behind."
"Tart, citric finish that's not too puckering, great for the style. Very solid take on the style that's not too flashy. Pays homage to the originals but has a distinctly American voice. When you see this one for under $7, consider it a steal."
"Drinkability: as I said, simply delicious. I've never had Hennepin before, but this might have to become a staple in my household."
"D - Delicate but with a certain raw edge, and pleasingly complex. Like a Belgian thoroughbred through and through... but it's not!"
"I'd say this one raises the bar, even for Belgian brewers. A fine example of the style."
"Notes: I have long regarded this beer very highly. While it isn't the ""super beer"" that I remember it being the first time I ever tried it (because it was one of my first craft beers), I would definitely say it is an extremely superior beer. It has great flavor and is just so refreshing and easy to drink."
"Hennepin is a nice crisp Farmhouse Ale that is refreshing in summer and perfect with a rich meal in colder weather. It's a great year-round all-purpose ale."
"Overall, very easy to drink. An outstanding beer that will earn a permanent home in the ""mancave"" beer fridge."
"Drinkability> Easy."
"The beer was Saison but with the complexity of a good dubble. Get it while you can as new owners of Howe's Cavern no longer let Ommegang age beer there."
"D: Very drinkable, easy to have more than one. Alcohol is well hidden."
"A little heavy on the price where I get it but I definantly see myself partaking again in the future."
"This is a great beer. Very light, crisp and refreshing, yet full of flavor. It has almost an elegant quality to it."
"Drinkability: It doesn't get much better than this. If this beer could contain alcohol or could be exactly the same and contain no alcohol I would opt for later because if I could I would drink this all day every day. Absolutely the best Saison I have ever had."
"Would love to try this again on tap-will def enjoy again at 7.99/bottle, mirrors the quality of much more expensive Belgium styles at half the price."
"Mouthfeel is light and effervescent."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied and the alcohol was pleasantly masked by all that was going on with the flavors. Has to be the best saison that I have tried."
"D: An excellent brew from Ommegang. Full of flavor and highly drinkable."
"D - I have had this before and had it again. A great beer by Ommegang."
"Had on tap at the Moan and Dove. The drink had a pale gold appearance with a frothy head that lasted for awhile during my drinking session. The aromas were quite good with a hint of spice to the dominant grassy tones. The taste is really good; a perfect balance of sour tastes with fruit flavors like lemons, peaches, oranges. All of it mixed with a yeasty, earthy flavors. Mouthfeel was decent though the drink lacked a good punch and was a little too light. Overall, not bad at all."
"I like this beer OK but I think Foret is far superior."
"Sampled on January 19, 2010. The cork popped and flew across the room emitting a nice bit of carbonated mist from the bottle. The pour is pale yellow and quite cloudy with excitable effervescence. The fizzy white head diminishes after a few moments. The aroma is a nice pleasing balance of wheat, banana, yeast, and clove. There is a nice creamy, bold mouthfeel. The taste echoes the aroma with an additional breadiness and a dry hop ending. Ommegang really understands the Belgian style brtewing process and they emulate it well."
"Drinkability is good, pretty much classic saison. Crisp, refreshing, but with a huge, massively complex flavor. Textbook. Excellent."
"I would write more, but its a shame to be tapping on my phone while this beer sits in front of me. Do yourself a favor and go drink one of your own. Cheers!"
"Drinkability: If I didn't know what brewery this was from, I would say this was brewed in Belgium. Absolutely true to the style and very good overall."
"Value: I paid three bucks for a 12 oz bottle. Not bad for what is obviously a high-quality ale."
"I can't say that this style is my favorite beer, so I am always a little reticent about what I'm going to taste. However, this beer keeps the citrus and spice components very well balanced. Some sweetness on the front palate and some hoppiness on the finish. Gives the beer a crisp appeal. Good level of carbonation, surprising given how quickly the head dissipated. Again, this is well balanced and adds to this beers drinkability. I'm looking forward to drinking more of this beer and others from this producer."
"Very impresive beer as expected from the Duvel family of ales. This was the beer that started my love of Saisons. The flavor created by the high ABV is complex while avoiding the alcohol/solvent flavors."
"Drinkability- Though not one of my favorite styles, I would gladly have this one again."
"D: I could drink this all night long. When served chilled, I didn't notice the alcohol flavor much, and then it warmed up and was very noticeable in the finish. If I had a 6 pack of 12 oz. bottles, they would definitely be finished in one setting, good stuff."
"D: Just seems too tart for me to handle drinking a lot of this. Almost puckering."
"before trying hennepin, i was not a fan of the style, but since then i've really enjoyed saisons. i'd say this is still up there on my top 5 saison list."
"D: I finished the whole 750 ml bottle while making the baked ziti for dinner. I took the last sip with dinner. Next time I think I'll wait to crack this open until after dinner due to the sugary sweetness."
"D: High. It was shared with friends, but one can easily finish off a 750 ml bottle."
"Pours a hazy gold with a two finger white head with great retention leaving patchy lacing. Aromas of lemon, yeast, spice and some grass. Vanilla, melon, spices-corriander, sweet orange and floral hop flavors blend nicely. High carbonation, medium body with a dry spicy finish. A great beer to pair with food or enjoy on its own."
"D - This beer is pretty well done, it is light on the body, perfect drink in the hot weather of the south"
"Let me add that I have the big bottle often and this was the first 12 oz. bottle I have enjoyed."
"This beer seems like a good introduction for me to the Saison style. I will be on the look out for others as this one was pretty tasty, and a good change from the usual Belgians available."
"Poured into a tulip glass. Hazy golden color with big bubbled head. The taste took me by surprise, I was not expecting such a hard cider like taste to it. Great aroma of ginger and citrus. Very bubbly in the mouth. Very crisp and clean taste. Would have probably been even better on a hot day."
"D- On the low end of the drinkability scale for a saison, but pleasant enough to have a few."
"Happy Christmas to all--cheers!"
"D - Like all of Ommegang's beers, this is extremely delicious and drinkable."
"D: Highly drinkable, fantastic brew."
"D: This beer just gets better as it warms. I'm still fairly new to farmhouse ales, but I can definitely see making this a regular stop on my rotation, especially in the summer."
"D: Good drinkability. The flavors are strong and there is alot of carbonation and that could limit the drinkability. But the flavors are great and do not get old and you can barely detect the alcohol."
"Pours a fairly clear yellow-orange with a huge, crackled head that is slow to dissolve and never fully does. Strong spices dominate the aroma, Belgian yeast, clove, some flowery/spicy hops. Flavor is sweet upfront and followed by more driven spices and an alcohol warmth. Its light-medium bodied with a prickly carbonation. This has a great wealth of spices in both the aroma and the flavor that some people might find a little overpowering but I thought it worked nicely with the slight grassy/spicy hops."
"Pours the expected light yellow-orange color with a nice looking white head on top that dissolves slowly and allows for nice lacing. Aromas and flavors are huge - big fruitiness, some bread, cookies, farmhouse funk shows up as well. It's a huge flavor and absolutely fantastic. Body and carbonation are busy and good for the style. Would definitely have it again, and most likely will."
"D-its not my favorite style of beer, but I think a great version of the style"
"Random: I don't remember the banana from the bottle. Definitely more delicious as it warms."
"Drink is great a nice offering of alcohol but never really stands out. Easy drinking and easily enjoyable. A must have in my book."
"D: This is a fantastic brew that can be enjoyed in a limited session. For some reason, there is a huge difference between drinking this in the bottle versus pouring into a glass. I had drank this once just in bottle form, and for whatever reason, pouring it into the glass was so much better. Highly recommended."
"Overall Impressions: There is quite a bit going on here that I cannot quite put into words (this was one of my early reviews). Very refreshing Belgian that is not too heavy. Gets better as it warms a bit. I could and would drink this beer everyday."
"D: Highly drinkable. Quite impressed with the craftmanship of this beer. Saison is not my favorite style, but Ommegang does a great job with this - I would have guessed this was from Belgium in a blind tasting."
"Pours out like lemonade, hazy yellow that looks very dilute. Has an explosive head that goes up to about three fingers and dies down to about one and retains at that point very well. The color is not that attractive but I think the haziness is due to me pouring in some of the sediment. Other than that the appearance is pretty strong. Smell is a mix of Belgian yeast and malts, some fruit (apples, bananas) and a bit of sour. The overall strength of the smell is a bit weak and I start to pick up more and more alcohol as I drink it. Taste is pretty much the same as smell. Belgian yeast and malty flavors, fruits (apples, bananas), alcohol and some sour. A tiny bit of hops. It is stronger than the nose and pretty much just a solid Belgian flavor. It eventually dies down to a very dry almost rye like taste with alcohol, the loss of flavor is disappointing. Mouthfeel is pretty suitable. The carbonation is medium and the body is pretty light but a bit creamy. Not really watery at all. This beer is pretty warm for 7.5%. Drinkability would be better if the alcohol did not take over and the flavors did not die. The price is not that great for how much I liked this beer. Maybe I'll try it again after I have some more Saisons."
"Pours a yellowish oragnish grapefruit like color with a pillowy head that gives way to decent lacing. The aroma is of sweet malt and some citrus. The taste is sweet malt backbone with some citrus hints. The mouthfeel is very carbonated and bubbly. This is a very drinkable beer, nothing to turn you off, but it is a slighty funky taste, the alcohol is well hidden."
"I tried this beer out of a 22 oz bottle from Oasis in Spartanburg. The color is kind of hard to describe. Sort of a hazy yellow with huge, bright white head that fades some. Smell is sugar and alcohol with little hops. Taste is sweet and a bit dry. This one is really bubbly, but a very easy drink, espically at 7.7 abv! I was really impressed with this beer and can see why it's one of the best saisons out there!"
"This beer is just right for the style; it's not too strong to take away from drinkability, but it's still very flavorful and complex. I could probably drink this all day without getting tired of it."
"Drinkability: I say F bud light, this wins for drinkability. Perfect carbonation, mouthfeel and texture. Not overwelming at all, yet very interesting and complex. A must if you havent had anything from ommegang!"
"Purchase from Three Cellars in Franklin, WI. Poured into a snifter, this beer shows a bright yellow body with a thick puffy white head. Aroma is esters from the Belgian yeast, most notably lemon zest. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with a high level of carbonation. Effervescent with a wine-like yeast flavor. Very good drinkability."
"Medium body with a lot of sharp carbonation to it. This is very easy to drink and overall is much better than any fresh Hennepin I've had."
"D: Very good balanced drinkable saison--one of the best of its style"
"Taste: The beer changes flavor throughout the sip. It starts with a biting carbonation that is taken over by the tartness of the yeast. A slight sweet flavor (pear and orange) follows that is taken by a hop and malt bite. The taste dries on the tongue and leaves a sweet, husky malt behind with a bit of lingering bitterness."
"At Ommefest. Amazing golden color with light hints of softer fruits, spices, and zest. Amazingly crisp and dry much how i love saisons. Always a winner. I've had the original from belgium recently that is about 2 years old and can say that it is holing up very well. I was surprised how well it was doing censidering the time difference, but Ommegang did a great job with this one."
"Drinkability/Overall: This beer seems to get better as you drink it. I guess the tastes come out more as it warms. Also, this beer has one of the greatest differences between pre and post-agitation taste that I've ever had. Certainly drinkable, and I wouldn't turn down another, particularly with certain types of food. Still, I prefer the Rare Vos from Ommegang."
"Carbonation is high, not sure if that is appropriate or not, but it seems to go well. Mouthfeel is dry, leaving you wanting another sip."
"Overall this to me is just a little more pricey sessional, nothing special"
"Pours a slightly hazy very pale golden with bluish-green highlights. A nice rocky pale white head sits atop the beer. Smell is estery, fruity, and smells of fresh grain. Taste is light and fruity up front, hints of bananas and cloves. Very little bitterness which is to style. Mouthfeel is silky smooth, high carbonation though. Drinkability is very good, delicate flavors make this an excellent beer."
"This beer has a lot of odd bitterness to it. Its like orange peels or something. The flavors are complicated, fruity, sour, harsh, and finished by the bitterness. Drinkability moderate and the mouthfeel is a little thin. Not my favorite from this brewery unfortunately."
"D: this is what I expect from a Saison. excellent balance of tartness, floral and spicy hops (haven't experienced that before, hope I'm not misinterpreting something), and biscuity malt. this beer looks good, smells good, tastes good and has a very pleasant mouthfeel. Brewery Ommegang does it again."
"D- kept waiting for the catch but there isn't one. this is a really good beer. could drink one every night and not tire of it for a long time. looking forward to picking up a sixer and letting them age for 6-12 months."
"Just poured this from one of the 750ml bottles. It has a nice and soft golden yellow color with a strong head that slowly dissipates as it sits in the glass. Upon the first sniff I get a slight, slight malt fragrance accompanied with citrus. When drinking while smelling there is a strong hoppy aroma as well as a nice hoppy and carbonated dance on the tongue. As it goes down the hatch, I get a crisp, burst of citrus followed by a final goodbye of hoppiness. The taste left in the mouth is a battle between hops and citrus, with the victor eventually being the citrus. Indeed it should be served a tad bit out of the fridge as I think it helps battle the strong carbonation. But my goodness is this beer smooth, delicious and oh so good to the last drop. Hennepin, we will be seeing each other soon."
"Drinkability: Very tasty. By far my favorite in the style that I have tried so far. I like the hay taste without the big bitter taste. I will be having this again."
"Tastes are consistent with a couple different fruits. I pick up a little grapefruit specifically. Very refreshing and easy to drink."
"D- My first saison, and I love it. It's just perfect to sip on, but I really like pairing it with food. I tried it with some Humbolt Fog (an aged goat's-milk cheese) and it was just superb."
"The taste starts slightly shrp and acidic, but this quickly settles down into a lightly alcoholic fruitiness with herbal-peppery-spicey bite, yeasty dough. The herb has a juniper quality along with otherwise leafiness and grassiness. There is a light earthy hint throughout. It has light sweetness balanced by the bitter-spicey-acidic bite so ends up rather dry, but not too dry. It's quite drinkable and, though a bit thin, has some complexity and good balance while the character holds up well."
"D - this is the ultimate Belgian session beer. I could drink this all night!"
"Drinkability- This was really good. I enjoyed it a lot and will pick up more. I would drink it again."
"Overall, this is a very balanced and drinkable ale. Definitely one of my favorite American interpretations of a Belgian style, and I'd also say this is one of my favorite saisons -- regardless of origin. I recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable crisp, tasty pale ale with more character than the typical golden ale."
"D - Refreshing with higher ABV."
"This is a drinkable Farmhouse Ale. It's not as blatantly musty & earthy as I expect but it makes up for it in its nice fruit character."
"From a bomber or 750ml bottle (can't remember), this Saison poured a light yellow with enormous lacing. A fresh biscuity aroma hits the nose on this light yet potent saison. The typical Belg. flavor profile comes out with clove and banana - this reminds me less of a saison than of a basic ale. A decent drink, though I prefer some other saisons over this one."
"D: Drinkable to me at least as a sipper. This was my third beer of the festival, and noticed it took me much longer to get through this beer than the other two. I'll likely try this again in a more standard sitting and see how that goes."
"Great Belgian style saison. Nice big foamy, fluffy head that leaves good lace. White grape juice, lots of lemon peel and golden apples with powerful coriander to back it up. Very tasty and drinkable at 8%. Fine example and a great bottle to put back on a hot day. Appreciated the spice. Very little sediment in this 750ml."
"Poured this dirt and mold covered bottle into a hennepin glass. This is a bit of a departure from it non cave aged brethren. Its quite a bit more subtle and all of the flavors kind of meld together in a nice sequence of mouthfeel and flavor at the same time. It has wonderful looking floaties that look great when held up to the light. Has a more understated mouthfeel than the non cave aged version and is much more pleasant to drink. I may go to the brewery tomorrow to get some adoration ale, maybe I'll pick a few more of these up while I'm there"
"Light to medium body and very drinkable. I didn't drink it as quickly as I have some other brews, but I think you could sip this stuff all night. Very nice well rounded brew."
"Drinkability - Relatively drinkable for an almost 8% Saison. I can taste just a bit of the alcohol coming through the closer to room temperature this gets. A very enjoyable beer to have this find Friday evening."
"D: As above, so it is below...look out, these would fly away...almost too universal in its appeal...HUGE crowd pleaser..."
"I'm not that familiar with this style and don't have a lot of other Saisons to compare to but as a beer it's actually very good. It's almost a little like a wheat beer without the banana aroma. Color is a light copper, carbonation is reasonable (not too high), flavor very light for the alcohol content and the mouthfeel and drinkability are great. Aroma is quite unique without being too overwhelming."
"D- Had the whole 750 and could ask for more. Maybe because I'm intrigued by this beer, or maybe I'm just enjoying the buzz."
"Finishes bone-dry and crisp. It appears that much of fruit and spice is coming from actual spices as opposed to the yeast. A saison that has remained true to the history of this style; refreshing, nourishing, and perfect for warm weather drinking."
"Smells a bit fruity with a little spiciness. Delicious. Tingles the tongue. Mouthfeel is smooth drinkability is amazing. This shit is awesome. One of my first saison/farmhouse styles and I must say....Amazing! Please drink one. I could have reviewed this beer so much better but I'm a little too buzzed!"
"Drinkability is of a dangerous caliber, delicious, easy to drink, alcohol burn MIA. Warning flags are up on this one. It would not be problematic to finish this bomber before the end... ummmm, that was good... of this sentence."
"Drinkability: Pretty good, its pretty balanced, and drinks light for having almost 8% abv. Goes down smooth and tastes decent. Give this beer a try it wont disappoint."
"Overall: Big bold flavor for a domestic belgian these guys aren't playing around with the style. The extreme carbonation and the tremendously pale hue sets it apart from the expected brew but this one has started its own trek with a backpack full of the traditional guidelines."
"Poured a clear yellow with a one finger head that lasted throughout. The aroma was initially a lagerish skunk, but later, I could pick up a dark fruit smell. The taste was sweet and fruity with a little sour aftertaste. The feel was light bodied, crisp and clean with good carbonation. Drinkability was good. Overall, Hennepin was much more like a Belgian strong pale ale than it was a Saison. And a pretty good BSPA too."
"In short, I have tried a couple Saisons/Farmhouse Ales and the Hennepin is by far one of the best, if not the best. Ommegang has done an excellent job in creating a world class Saison."
"This is what I want a farmhouse ale to taste like. Thank you, Ommegang, for the delicious saison. Next time I'll get the bigger bottle."
"D: Delicious, smooth complex flavor, hidden ABVs"
"d: the beer goes down easy. highly drinkable even for a >7% beer."
"This was my first time having this on tap. I had a bottle a few years ago that I remember being funkier. Time to revisit a bottle of this."
"Very drinkable. An old favorite that I was happy to visit on tap - accept for the odd metallic taste."
"Drinkability - Balanced through and through a with the relatively low ABV it certainly makes for a drinkable beer."
"Refreshing beer that is easy to drink. Well masked alcohol. I'm personally not a big saison fan, but I could see myself drinking this one again."
"Above all it is exceedingly tasty and drinkable. I use it as the standard to measure other saison ales against. In my opinion, you can never go wrong with buying this beer."
"the taste in the mouth is almost the same as the flavor, not as spicy as it tastes though. pretty uneventful in whole, but very well balanced, mild and a perfect hot day beer."
"D: Mabye the most drinkable Saison I've had. Extremely well balanced and the alcohol is fairly well hidden."
"D - Goes down very smooth. What? Glass is already empty? This is a great session beer for sure"
"D- Quite refreshing and nice for warm weather."
"Overall: This is a brilliant beer. It delivers exactly what it promises. Keep up the good work at Ommegang."
"Drinkability is decent, I could easily have another, & the somewhat high ABV is not detectable. An unusual beer, but one I really liked."
"An amazing saison, lots of flavor, not sure if its from the malt or the added ingredients (ginger and orange, i think). Not super dry but being an American interpretation, one of the best for its style."
"Overall Impression - Another solid beer from Ommegang. I'm continually impressed at the amount of Belgian beers they make that are great representations of the style. If you're new to Belgian beers/Saisons this is a good one to try and can serve as a good comparison for other beers of the style. It may not be the best Saison, but it is solid."
"So... Great Lakes Grassroots Ale bills itself as a saison, but I am confused, because that tasted like crap and this tastes delicious. I am glad that I did not let the Grassroots scare me away from the style entirely."
"Poured from a growler into a pint glass small disappearing head, with slow but steady carbonation. Sugary, biscuity, sweet with a hint of clove aroma. Sweet and crisp with the carbonation makes it burst on your tongue. Alcohol extremely hidden. Very drinkable and enjoyable. An instant favorite."
"Personally: I love Hennepin; I would put this against any good Chardonnay or white Châteauneuf-du-Pape any day of the week."
"This is a very tasty, easy drinking beer. Something that would go great with an expensive dinner. No single flavor dominates as in some other Belgian style beers I've had."
"had it again. seem about the middle of the road for the this is an old bottle and this is a new bottle. didn't have the expanded palate. lack a lot of broadness. hard on the gums. i'm over this beer. ruining a style i love for me..."
"Overall, this beer is pretty good, especially on a hot summer day. Light enough to have a few, but still packs a nice flavor."
"Tasting this beer takes me back to Father's Day 2005. My girls took me on a brewery tour in Bruges at the Straffe Hendrik Brewery. They were serving their Saison. Hennepin has managed to capture the essence of the Belgium brewing style. A smooth blend of fruit, sour, and muted bread flavors that perfectly mask the relatively high alcohol content. I recently had one of these while watching Rick Steves give a HD tour of of the Grand Place in Brussels - perfect."
"Verdict: Hennepin is a great beer to sit down with an enjoy on a peaceful Summer evening. It may not be the most complex Saison out there, but it's still well worth a try."
"Drinkabilty - Ridiculously drinkable for it's ABV, maybe dangerously so. I could easily drink several more of these! Quite refreshing. Very good! This is the first Saison I've tried, but I can safely say I'll be buying this again, and trying some others."
"Overall while not 100% to my personal preferences for the style (I like mine funkier and a little more dry) I have to admit this is an excellent job by Ommegang. They somehow managed to take one of my favorite styles of ale and craft something that's extremely approachable without 'dumbing it down' one iota. A top class ale I'd recommend whether you're new to the style or a seasoned Saison drinker."
"Go Blue!"
"D: Delicious Saison, well balanced and interesting."
"Feel is great and is deliciously drinkable"
"D: A good saison. The alcohol is slightly too prominent. But still, it's fairly well balanced with a pleasant composition of flavors and aromas. Very easy to drink."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer, but it did remind me more of a Belgian Strong Pale than a saison. I'm looking for more funk and more of a refreshing feel... in essence something more traditional. That aside, Hennepin is a decent US take on a Belgian and worth the price (especially when you get it on super-special like ritzkiss did - cheers for sharing Eric!)."
"Probably the pick of the bunch last night, IMHO. Could easily drink this all summer night long and not feel lacking."
"D- This beer is extremely drinkable on a warm day, one of the best, if not the best, saison I have ever had."
"Pours a golden amber with an off white head that fades but leaves nice lacing. The smell is complex, some nice sweet fruit notes, some malt and spice notes as well. The taste starts somewhat sweet with the spice and fruit upfront, followed by a somewhat tart taste finishing with a malty taste. The mouthfeel is very smooth, some alcohol content detected in the aftertaste, but overall a silky beer with nice balance. This is a great drinker, not overpowering flavor, but lots of flavor is packed into this beer. Definitely worth checking out."
"drinkability is good. very tasty and lightly boozy saison. full of yeasty esters and fruity tones, this brew is solid. nicely proportioned, very successfull brew. the alcohol hurts a bit, but still very well done. cheers!"
"It's really a tough call between this and Dupont if you're deciding between which saison to go with, though in the end I Hennepin the edge. This one is absolutely a delight to drink."
"D: Highly drinkable, crisp and refreshing but with big flavor and alcohol."
"I saw this staring me in the face at my local beer store and had to give a taste. It pours an amber/yellow partly cloudy. Moderate head. The aroma is spicy and fruity with hints of yeast. The taste does not let me down. So fruity and delicious. I love the spice mix. It's like a piece of bread with cinnamon butter spread on it. I found the mouth feel to be pleasing as well. Not too thick. Seems right for a saison. I think this could easily be a session beer. The abv might get you but it would be worth downing a few bombers."
"Absolutely delicious and a personal favorite of mine. Very drinkable, very tasty and yet very dangerous."
"One of the best saisons I've had, Hennepin definitely gives Belgians a run for their money! Great value as well."
"D- Very drinkable and easily overdone... Be easy and enjoy!"
"Overall, this is a great summer beer. Nice for a hot day, but still enough flavor and complexity to be a quality craft beer."
"The mouth is very crisp and overly-carbonated. Too spritzy for my liking. This may be a style thing so my rating is a bit higher than my preference. Flavor is of pineapple, apples, tart yeast, and slight spicy finish. This is refreshing and pretty good. Had it with lunch and it paired well. Not bad. My first of this style. I will seek out more..."
"this is a great brew ,well made, and it can stand a long side the best saisons in the world."
"The mouthfeel is very light-bodied and crisp; sort of reminiscent of a champagne, but not as bubbly. Excellent drinkability - sippable throughout the night and great to share with a friend."
"Pours a pale gold color with a foamy, sticky, white head. The aroma has banana's, cloves, lemon, and yeast. The taste is the same as the aroma. Has some sweetness up front, and a dry, tart finish. Low to medium bodied, well carbonated, and good drinkability. Well made."
"Overall, I could take or leave this one. I was really looking forward to it based upon the advice of some friends, and, of course all the reviews and kudos here, but frankly I just don't get it. It is decent, it is solid, and would I take another if someone poured it, sure, why not? But did it blow me away and would I seek it out again? No, and probably not."
"Drinkablity - Very drinkable and a reasonable ABV. Could easily do a session with this one, and I have s3everal times. Very good American interpretation of a Saison Farmhouse style."
"Hennepin is a very drinkable dry brew. You have to be a fan of the spice/clove taste to love this beer; another delicious offering from the world class brewers at Ommegang."
"pours a nice cloudy gold with a billowy head. smells fruity with spice. I had never had a saison and have been wanting to try. It reminded me of a wheat beer with a touch of funk. it was interesting. the aroma was the best part of it. very refreshing fruit smell. light feel with lots of carbonation. enjoyed it, but the taste needed a bit more CRISPness. i really wanted just a sharpness to the flavor, great though"
"D- An ok brew that wasn't quite my style."
"Has that hard to find balance between complexity and drinkability. Good stuff."
"4 dangerously quaffible (at 7.5%, acc to bottle), the friendliest farmhouse i've tried so far. but so light on the funk, and the alcohol makes its presence known in an intrusive way as the brew warms slightly. given the seeming need to glurp it combined with the high abv, probably won't go for this very often."
"D: Its drinkable the more of it i have the more i like it but its just not my cup of tea i dont think i would buy it agian."
"D: One of the few American saisons that can go toe-to-toe with the big boys. Recommended."
"D - Lots of dynamic yeast action here. I could probably drink another bottle of this in one sitting, but I would certainly take it slow - this is the kind of brew that rewards the drinker who takes his/her time. It's pretty filling, especially when compared to other saisons. I would pair this brew with a creamy Robiola Tre Latti or a bready, yeasty cow's milk cheese like Tomme Crayeuse."
"D- At first I want to chug it, so refreshing, good balance, the ABV goes un noticed in the taste( for the most part. On a hot day i could slam these down."
"This beer is full of funk and bubble gum, yeasty, doughy, a little too sour for a saison. definately farmy! but it may be better with food not an easy brew to drink alone unless you want half 3 philosophers and half duvel in the same glass :( sorry hut dissapointed. Tastes better with Food"
"This ale is a delight to drink. Lots of great flavors without being too much. Strikes a unique balance of light crisp body with bold taste."
"I'm a big fan of Ommegang and Hennepin is one of my go-to beers."
"Honey malts, grassy and lemon flavors, and an earthy dryness are the signature of this beer. You can also find banana and little clove along with a slight bitterness. The smell is of spicy honey and grain. This cloudy yellow beer beer is one of best in style that I've ever had."
"It's wonderful all around. Pleasant to look at it, smell and feel. A beer for your senses."
"D--Solid brew that really hits the spot, would definitely buy again."
"This is an excellent Saison. Once again, Ommegang truly do give the Belgians a run for their money."
"I definitely want to see what age can do to it. Does the funk take over in time? A great brew from Ommegang!"
"O- Complex, but not too complex. Seems to have been a great choice for a refreshing beer on this hot day. Personally, I think that it has more to offer in the aroma than it does in taste. Definitely a fun time and not too expensive (750ml for $7.50). The bottle will be super-glued to my wall shortly."
"Quite light and refreshing for a strong beer, rendering ti eminently drinkable."
"Anyone in upstate NY should make a point to visit the Ommegang Brewery. Wonderful people, scenery, and delicious beer."
"Pours a light straw color with a prominent head that faded to a thick film with persistent lacing. Smells spicy, bready, sweet, piny, sticky, musty, earthy. Taste is thinner than aroma, the spices come through as do the hoppy tones, and some malt. Mouthfeel is very thin and unsubstantial, which leads to good drinkability."
"Poured into my Duvel Tulip just now!!! A beautiful 2 finger head that slowly falls leaving perfect lacing. Smell is of grass and earth with some light citrus notes. Taste is unreal!!! So wonderful and crisp and so many complexities. There is a ton of earthy, citrus and funky things going on with this one. I can't imagine a much better Saison than this example. (and it's from NY???) Wow, this is so almost perfect in every way. It hides the 7.7% ABV so well and dare I say, this may be a session beer! Another great job from Ommegang! Crisp, funky, earthy, PERFECT!!!"
"Pours hazy yellow with a fluffy white head. Banana and cloves dominate upfront with some lemon and coriander. Definitely taste the yeast and a little sweetness. Nice crispness from all that carbonation, but not overloaded. Surprised by the ABV because it drinks pretty smooth without too much of an alcohol bite. Perfect for pre-dinner or a day out in the sun. In my opinion, close runner-up to Saison Dupont for best in style."
"I love this beer."
"Overall: Really good drinkability. Great representation of the style! Nice fruity and spicy characteristics. Nothing is overpowering and all of the flavors work well together."
"I love saisons and this is one of the best I have had. The aroma and flavor is hard do beet. An all around great beer."
"I love to have this brew threw out the summer and I usually do. It is a great picnic brew as well"
"O- not too complex..but very refreshing...not a huge fan of the style"
"Also extra credit for the historical namesake!"
"Saisons were traditionally made for harvesting farmhands in rural Belgium--they were refreshing and light (~3.5% ABV.) Ommegang has unfortunately americanised this saison, and I feel it's lost something of its authenticity in the process."
"Prost!"
"Mouthfeel is soft, chalky, chewy. One of the best from America. Great to get it in 4 packs."
"D: This beer certainly goes down easily enough. I'm starting to realize that Saison isn't one of my favorite beer styles, but I still feel Hennepin is a great example of one."
"This has a lot more in common with a Belgian Blonde or Tripel than a Saison. Lots of banana, not enough hops, and doesn't finish dry enough, or crisp enough to keep it refreshing. It is still a very good beer, just not at all what I was expecting."
"Very dry finish and a smooth drinkability. A really complex beer. Thanks to DannyS for the extra in a trade."
"What else can I say but, wow. This is my first saison and I'm debating whether to try any others as it may ruin this first experience. Great job by Ommegang for creating such a complex yet simple tasting brew."
"It finishes well with a touch of plum sweetness and tartness, like a grilled apricot soaked in scotch."
"D: This is one of my favorite Belgians to date. Great rendition and readily available which makes it even better."
"Drinkability: I could drink this beer all day. I mean it is just a really enjoyable really easy going beer that feels like a session beer no matter what the 7.7% abv says."
"D. Very drinkable. One of my first forays into Saisons. This is a good beer."
"Drinkability: I would say especially high. This is a great tasting beer that is light and refreshing, as well as especially flavorful."
"Pours a beautiful light golden with a nice fluffy white head. Smells a bit of lemon and vanilla with some sourness and overall funkiness to it. The head has fantastic retention with very nice lacing to it. Outstanding flavor with notes of vanilla, lemon, and hay funkiness. There's a pleasant bit of hop bitterness at the end. This is a beer that I think is fantastic, but can't put my finger on why exactly. Does funky lemony vanilla hay sound good? Well no, but drink it sometime and you'll find that it actually tastes fantastic. The beer has such a nice smooth drinkability and alcohol is very well hidden. Highly recommended."
"Incredibly drinkable. This seems like it'd be the perfect way to end a hot summer's day."
"A 750ml corked and caged bottle share with psycohops and brothercannon. Poured into a trio of nonic pint glasses. Appears a cloudy bright yellow color with a healthy two fingers of fluffy white foam. Smells and tastes of spicy peppery yeast, lemon, pear, green apples and grassy grains. Moderately carbonated to say the least, with a medium to full body. Crisp, dry and quenching, one of the world's perfect food beers. This ale begs to be paired with some great pungent cheeses along with some crisp fruit."
"About three dollars less per 750 mL bottle than the true Belgians with every bit as much quality. I will definitely have this again and recommend Hennepin to friends!"
"Pours a cloudy straw color with an enormous fluffy white head and lots of bubbles floating up the side of the glass. Nice lacing down the glass. The smell was yeasty, with lemon/citrus and spicy wheat. Taste was what was to be expected from the smell, with a nice crisp twang to it."
"Drinkability: This is a very good farmhouse ale. It's definitely shocking that this beer is brewed in the U.S. This beer is quickly becoming a staple in this house."
"This is excellent!!! I never understood why people spoke highly of Ommegang until I tried this style. It is a better version of the parent Duvel standard brew. This has lower alchohol phenol scent and flavor with a better taste. Best Ommegang I've had."
"Had on tap at Local 44 in Philly. Poured a golden wheat color with a light white head. Smell was very yeasty and citrusy with some oils of hops. taste was similar, super smooth and full, mellow yeast then the light bite of the hops. Very balanced, great beer. Have a bomber of this which I'll open in a few months."
"I really like this one. I keep forgetting this one is brewed in New York. One of the best American brewed Belgian style ales I have had."
"D - Give me a warm day and some out door work and this is perfect. Or give me a cold day and a warm fire and this is perfect. Or leaves changing, or clouds and rain..."
"D - With the exception of the aforementioned clove, the drinkability is very high."
"Mouthfeel is a little spicy and there's a tart bitterness to the finish. The alcohol suits the mouthfeel and flavors, and while it is a refreshing brew, the nearly 8% ABV doesn't make this the most drinkable of beers. Interestingly, I remember the Hennepin I had on tap as a little fruitier. Nevertheless, this is a great offering from Ommegang, and I'd think about returning to it again when I'm in the mood for a Belgian."
"One of the best examples of the style and a great little number from Ommegang."
"D: Good, but I don't think I'll be dropping a lot of money into this one.. It's a good beer, but I think there are better belgians out there."
"D: An excellent saison that is readily available and a great value. It's Ommegang's most approachable beer, and could easily be a good gateway brew for those interested in trying Belgian ales."
"D: super high session beer, despite being almost 8%, can't taste that abv and lots of smooth crisp flavor"
"My favorite beer from Ommegang."
"Arrived in Hennepin tulip glass. A pale golden color with a giant sticky bright white head. Head last a long time and leaves great lacing all thru the drinking. Smells of grapefruit,cloves and a little hops. Outstanding taste, clean yet complex flavors of citrus, cloves and yeast. The flavors change with each sip and coats the mouth with unique adventures in flavor! So glad this is a domestic product as the price is right for such a great Belgian style. This will be making a permanent home in my fridge for the next several months. Great beer for those warm nights on the deck."
"In the end the beer is a fine saison, very much like Dupont in the sweetlesness quite inviting to explore this style to a fuller extent."
"What a Joy!"
"(Note: This is for the 7.7% ABV 750ml bottle. I've had the 7.5% ABV 12oz bottle since then, and, disappointingly, that definitely wouldn't deserve a score this high. I'll update this sometime when I can do a side-by-side comparison.)"
"excellent beer!"
"This beer pours a pale yellow or goldish color. It is not quite clear, but not far off. The head is like an ice cream cone bulging over the rim of my glass it is so thick. The nose has a grainy straw-like character that I find to be pretty common in belgian style beers. There is a nice structure to the flavor. The foam on the head lends itself to really ""creaming up"" the mouthfeel. The grains have a somewhat spicy character and I would go so far as to say the spice like flavor gives the beer some ""flair."""
"D - While it has a different flavor, it's drinkability is pretty damn high in my opinion. Hidden alcohol in this guy is a bonus I think."
"I've been bragging this beer up to a buddy of mine, so it's high time that I give it a review. I will likely be biased in that I've drank this quite a bit and feel that it may be the best beer I've had. I'm sure there are threads in the forum on the subject, but if I was forced to pick a single beer to be stuck on a desert island with, this would be the one. Pours a hazy, yet bright gold with a tinge of orange. The head is nice and fluffy with plenty of carbonation oozing beneath. Smell is somewhat typical to the Belgian style yeast with hints of lemon, grass, and a touch of bubble gum. I don't know how to explain it, but you do get a sense of earthiness in the smell and taste. Taste is magnificent. The 7.5 abv is unnoticeable. I think saisons were typically made in the winter to be enjoyed the following summer, but it would take more willpower than I have to wait those precious months for this beer to mature. Thank goodness for modern refrigeration! Also, I've read a few reviews perhaps complaining of too much carbonation, but I feel that it is in perfect harmony with this brew."
"I was shocked to learn the abv for this one. I couldn't taste it at all. It's delicious, smooth, refreshing, and intriguing. That's a great combination that makes it very amusing."
"light colored and looks very light. Has some awsome bubble carbonation that doesn't go away.Looks almost like a coors light with more head. Has some german characteristics in the smell. Light hops and sweet malts. Very balanced taste. Has slight hop bitterness with a nice sweetness and good, smoothe aftertaste. The drinkability is awesome. you could drink several of these in quick succession without feeling like streaking. At 7.5 %, not a joke, and kinda dangerous. My favorate from Ommegang, which is saying a lot."
"D: Overall very drinkable, extremely tasty, consistent carbonation makes for a very enjoyable drink that doesn't grow old or become overpowering with alcohol."
"I poured into a pint glass to a white fluffy head. It was a cloudy pale yellow color. I get lemony, citrusy aromas. The taste is better than expected. My friend Alkemy raves about this beer and we enjoy different styles of beer. It has lemon and spice flavors. It is very drinkable. I would have enjoyed this even more on a hot summer day than a rainy, cold Monday, but overall a nice selection. I would still drink Allagash White first though."
"A great beer to have on a spring summer evening as things are beginning to warm up. One of the better American interpretations of the style."
"D- This is a delicious brew and the light body gives it the drinkability that makes A-B blush. With the high alcohol content I am happy I can only afford this once in a while."
"D: I've had some outstanding saisons. This is in the middle of the pack, but it's a good option when I can't get the ones that I have to trade for."
"Ommegang will tell you that Hennepin is suited to every season but I'd insist it's absolutely ideal for spring and summer. Wait for a hot, sunny day and sit yourself down with a big bottle of this stuff. Find shade under a tree, nestle up with a good book or share it over a meal with family and friends at the table. But don't just take my word on it...try it for yourself!"
"D: One of my favourite saisons, I can't believe I haven't reviewed it yet. This and LA Red Barn are the top 2 easily available American saisons in my opinion."
"Great effort by Ommegang! Can't wait to review Three Philosophers."
"Overall a real nice offering from Ommegang, good to see some state-side folks nailing this Belgian staple."
"Overall: Light, crisp, refreshing, and a nice sweet/sour balance. On first swallow, all I get is a real earthy taste, with a little green apple/pear, a little barnyardy, but it isn't until a couple seconds have passed that the flavors of the beer really come out. This is when the tart funkiness starts to come out, not so much as some beers I've had, it does't really taste like ""horse blanket"" or anything like that. But it is deliciously tart, and the tartness stays on the palate without the dank earthyness. Very light body, crisp and ephervescent. I'd say it's only off-dry, not as dry as some others I've had, and that is a positive impact here. After a bit it starts to stick to the tongue. I can see why this is such a well-regarded saison. Everyone should give this a go, especially when the mood for something lighter strikes."
"D - this was a pretty excellent ale, especially for the price. I will definitely purchase again since it is so light and crisp, yet delicious."
"Pours a hazy, pale yellow color. One inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of slight banana, tart malt, earthy malt, and some slight bread aromas. Fits the style of a Saison / Farmhouse Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with a very high carbonation level. Tastes of earthy malt up front, slight banana flavors next, slight hop background, and some tart malt. A real nice blend of flavors, with only a hint of dryness. I would definitely recommend this brew."
"I could drink this beer all day long, given the abv that could get me in some trouble...but I would most certainly enjoy the day."
"Overall one of my favorite beers. I often forget to buy it, but should because it's 60-80% of the cost of most Belgians I like just as much. Highly recommend this one if you've never had it. This beer would be good for ANYONE who likes beer in even the slightest respect."
"Although this rivals some of the other Saisons I have had, the alcohol taste is too promenant for 7.7%. If they were trying to hide a 10 or 11.5% sleeper in a farmhouse ale I might forgive 'em, but at 7.7 it should taste like a sweet dream. I would recommend this to others, but not if their favorite was a saison. They would pick it apart."
"This beer reminds me of summertime at every turn, it looks bright and light, it smells of fruit and flowers and it has a crisp taste and mouthfeel that are perfect for the warm weather. This beer would be great on a deck in the July sun. It's great right now and it's barely spring!"
"-Dotson"
"D - Extremely drinkable and full of flavor. A very good beer."
"I'm guessing that the whole horse blanket Brett taste isn't for me. I just found it to be a taste and smell that I'm not fond of. The beer looked fine with a nice head and nice lacing, and I'm sure that the fine craftspeople at Ommegang made this beer just how they wanted to, but unfortunately its not for me. Not gonna have another."
"Nice brew, very similar to a Duvel. Just not quite the masterpiece."
"Mouthfeel is light, and solventy almost acrylic in nature. I could feel this beer lingering on the enamel of my teeth. Highly drinkable Belgian Farmmhouse style. Get some..."
"Ordered a bottle last Friday at Picco in the South End. Poured into an Ommegang stemmed glass. School bus yellow color. Huge white head, and lacing down the glass almost on par with a stout. Very nice looking. Smelled like an excellent German hefe, with lots of bananas and cloves in the nose. Taste was awesome, with more of the same flavors and some wheat and bubble gum flavor mixed in. Very light on the palate. Didn't even notice the abv. Very easy to drink, as a saison should be. Better than most Belgian or French versions I've tried in the past. I should drink this more often. Paired nicely with a goat cheese and roasted red pepper pizza."
"D: This beer is as refreshing as any wheat...in the beginning anyways. I thought there was a serious breakdown of flavors near the end, so much so that I thought someone threw a farm into a blender and served it to me. I look forward to trying other Ommegang brews, because this one was a minor letdown."
"Ommegang makes some first class beer. The taste for this style is the best I have had. Until I find something else that is better, this to me is my desert island beer for the style. Awesome."
"750 ml bottle I'm having this side-by-side with Saison Dupont. This pours a slightly hazy (much clearer than SD) gold with a nice white head that sits high above the rim of the glass. Smells are floral, yeasty, with an almost selzer-like element. A bit phenolic but not in a bad way. Tastes completely different than SD but is still out of this world. Tastes of a rich blend of green apples, pineapples. Finish is quicker and dryer than SD, and doesn't punch you with citrusy zest. Hennepin is pretty suave. I'd consider SD's equal except that its body lacks that electric tingle owing (I assume) to less carbonation. This beer is fabulous and proves once again that Ommegang is an amazing brewery. I hope they keep it up."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Highly carbonated and medium bodied. Not bad but I dont think it is the world beater some people do."
"D: This is very, very tasty. It blends some flavors from several different styles in a very interesting and unique profile. Reasonably priced as well; around $6.50 for a 750mL bottle. I will definitely be treating myself to this again in the future."
"For me drinkability is moderate. If you would like to acquire the taste of a sour this saison may be a good place to start down that path. Probably best drank in the warmer months."
"Overall, this is a good beer. I was a little let down by the nose, and nothing in it blew me away. It is nicely balanced, though, and it is a very pleasant drink."
"Notes: This is the first time I had this one... and it's awesome. I love it. Very refreshing and highly drinkable. Although it's typically best to drink in the summer, I could drink this any time of year. I highly recommend it."
"Overall, this is an excellent beer. I have a few in the cellar that I'm going to let sit for 6 - 12 months to see how they mature. Mostly experimental. I would enjoy this fresh any day. It reminds me of a warm summer afternoon sitting on the patio enjoying the weather. This beer definitely makes these cold late-winter nights bearable!"
"Exceptional beer. Has a cloudy orangeish yellow with a tan head. Has a spicy orangeish smell. It has a taste like a wheat beer with citrus flavor. Has a spicy and crisp finish to this beer. This beer goes down extremely smooth and is very drinkable. This beer is definetly worth getting."
"I must confess this is one of my most favorite beers indeed. I was turned on to it on a business trip to Rochester, MN at good old Newt's (shout out to Matt the bartender!) I have converted many a beer drinkers to this fine brew!"
"mouth is crisp with a slight bite in the body and a clean finish, This beer drinks way too easy for the ABV. Definitely buying this one again."
"D-I'll have this one again its nice to be able to get hold of this more frequent now that I can't get Saison brett from boulevard."
"Cheers!"
"This was my first Ommegang beer and I am quite pleased. For a beer brewed in New York they have out done themselves. Not quite as good as a true Belgian but it's definitely knocking on it's door! Very nice take on a hard beer style to master. Can't beat the price either...payed less than $7 for a 750ml."
"Overall: Quite different from the usual 750 ml bottles I've become used to. I feel somewhat let down since this is one of my favorite beers. May have to go buy a 750 ml for a side-by-side comparison."
"overall a very solid beer. Kudos!"
"Taste: Very juicey and peppery. I wish there was more fruitiness to the taste. Alot like a tripel."
"Mild straw color, kind of like apple juice. Smells of a mild malt with butter, cream and some spices. Flavor is full of wheat and cloves, smoothed out by a buttery flavor and with a bit of hops in the background. Nice body and flavor all the way through, easy to drink and just generally a good brew."
"Drinkability: Very pleasant. Reminds me a bit of a Tripel. One or two of an evening would be just fine."
"D - very nice; a classic saison through and through. I'm a big fan, and I'll have no trouble finishing the 750 mL with my lady. Would gladly buy again if in the mood for a saison"
"D: Dangerous. I could spend a LOT of money on this. Goes down amazingly easily."
"Hazy orange-yellow with lively bubbling and a solid head. Coarse, grassy hop aroma and some Belgian spiciness and funk. Sharp is a good word for the nose on this one. Feels a bit watery and finely carbonated - champagne-like. Grassy hops are in the flavour as well with a little bit of fruit and spiciness and banana. Overall, the flavours have a bit of a rough edge I think."
"D: I could certainly drink the entire bottle. This is an excellent beer."
"Pours golden into glass. Nice head, good retention. Nice yeasty esthers on the nose. Taste is marred by high alcohol content - not very balanced. Good carbonation - fit for style. Overall drinkability flawed by lingering alcohol flavor on finish. Not bad - but not balanced enough to be great."
"Pours a light golden color, some bubbles, average head, diminishing. Malty Belgian aroma, not as floral. Some nose of alcohol. Malty, sour taste. Some Belgian, and also some alcohol. Floral aftertaste. Warming up a bit...the tastes blend together better. Not bad, a decent Belgian."
"Overall it is a big beer, very complexed with a whole lot going on as far as flavor. It is definitely not for beginners. But this beer is without a doubt worth a try, a very fun beer to drink and breakdown."
"d - I'm not quite used to the sour, especially sour without a powerful bitter alongside it. It's an energetic little brew. I see myself pouring to the end of this bottle quickly with no complaints. Great masking on its 8.5% ABV - if not for savoring the sour this stuff drinks like a light beer. Ommegang, I continue to enjoy tasting my way through your great beers."
"Pours a light transparent yellow, slightly cloudy but mostly transparent. Tons of carbonation apparent in the body. Tons. A smooth white head leaves nice lacing. Aroma is lemon, grass, bubble gum, pale malt sweetness and yeast. Taste mostly mirrors the scent, but with just a touch of tartness. A nice earthyness which matches the sweetness. Enough hops to make their presence known in the backdrop. Mouthfeel is perhaps a touch too carbonated, though that is fairly typical for the style. Smooth and refreshing. Alcohol barely noticeable. A great blend of sweetness and earthyness, and a touch of tart. Fantastic beer that can be enjoyed with any meal or at any time. An extremely versatile brew."
"D - It was pretty good except for the strong metallic, earthy taste."
"A beer I liked more then I expected or thought I would whether you are a real hard core fan of this style it is one worth giving a shot. Could see pairing up real nice with a spicy meal."
"Note: I didn't like this beer at all. However, it's somewhat highly rated because it does exhibit the characteristics that the style description lists. Once i get more experience with Saisons, I may edit this review to better reflect that rating of its characteristics."
"Poured a golden hazy color with a big head. Smell is impressive, almost hefe like to me, big banana and coriander. Taste is nice and is slightly sour to me. This was highly carbonated and medium bodied. ABV is surprising because it was fairly light beer...abv became more apparent as the beer warmed. High abv would prevent me from pounding these back but that is the only reason. Nice brew."
"D: A high point - both extremely 'easy to drink' and notably desirable in the 'want to have again' categories. A fine example of the style, haven't had more than a couple US-made saisons that can compete."
"If this is the archetype saison, I shall be having more!"
"This is one of the finest brews I have experienced. Wow you have got to try this one. It satisfies my hop head desires while still preserving the ancient Belgium art of bottle conditioning unfiltered ales with a boat load of living yeast."
"Drinkability is solid. The dryness might limit it (if drinking it by itself). I bet it would go great with Fetuccine Alfredo...just might have to try that next time."
"Drinkability - Complex and balanced flavor makes this an excellent quality brew. The last drink leaves you wanting another. This is quickly becoming a favorite."
"On tap at father's office. Absolutely brilliant color - luminous straw. Ok, I smelled and smelled and smelled this with myself, some friends, and my mom (who has the nose of a bloodhound). This stuff smells like cooked strawberries, and then a bacon and pancake breakfast - like nothing I have ever experienced. Taste was a very very very good farmhouse, almost to the caliber of Avec Les Bons Voeux, but not quite, citrus was nicely balanced by malt. Very smooth mouthfeel, and drinkability is extremely high due to great taste and its feeling as a ""session"" beer. Good good stuff. I went to an opera after this, and this saison added to that experience."
"Drinkability: One 750mL is about all I would care to drink in one sitting. Not bad but a little filling and not exactly what I typically choose to drink. I do however appreciate the style and will continue to try new saisons. I believe this to be a very good representation of the style."
"I haven't tried many Belgium-style beers before so wanted to give this a shot. It's a good beer, but I'm not a fan."
"drinkability: good quality, not my favorite, but a great crossover beer from macros. Suprised about the alchol content. it was very easy to drink. Serve with a lemon and i think the bud drinkers can handle this. Especially if they like Blue Moon."
"D: Very quaffable. Would make for an amazing lawnmower beer. Could drink many in a session. 7.7% alcohol is hidden well. Highly recommended."
"Overall, this was a real treat. It was cool to try a new style and I really liked it."
"D - Excellent. Crisp, dry finish combines with a soft malt and complex fruity ester character to make a very drinkable Saison. Bring on another pint and cheers to a wonderful American brewery brewing a strong example of this Belgian style."
"Mouthfeel is light. Carbonation makes this a crisp, easy drinking beer. Dangerous b/c the alcohol is completely masked."
"I've only tried these three saisons, but without a doubt I enjoyed Hennepin the most. With its lively carbonation it is a great beer to replace champagne with for those special occasions, and it also gets the job done on those extra hot summer days when a BA needs a cold one."
"A top tier Saison. One of my favorites and for the price you just can't beat it."
"Poured into Duvel tulip. A massive rocky head appears that hangs out with you for a while. Color was slightly murkey, light golden. Smell is great. A nice combination of some funk, tartness, fruits and yeast. I noticed some sour apple right away. Taste was pretty much on par with the smell. Some yeast and bread, typical of many Belgians, with that funky tartness (a good band name?) and sligh kiss of grassy hops. The mouthfeel was light. High carbonation and dry feeling almost is reminicant of champagne. Overall a good beer."
"This is extremely easy to drink, not nearly as scary as I had feared. Would buy again, now I want to try some more of this style."
"P.S. Living just 2 hours from Cooperstown, I decided a road trip was in order. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have some of the best brews in this fine country of ours."
"tastes of grass, a hint of lemon, fruit, spice, and a touch of citrus, end has a little bitterness to it."
"Pours a hazy, bright golden with a decent off-white head. Rich, wheaty, slightly lemony aroma calls for a sip. Flavor is crisp, mouth-filling, wheaty and yeasty with a hint of lemon and just a touch of hop bitterness. Texture is smooth and refreshing to give a pleasant and crisp finish."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied and it's chewy and sticky on the palate. The true ""Farmhouse"" finish is excellent. Carbonation is high, but in a very good way. The drinkability is outstanding - could definitely see myself downing glass after glass of this by the pool during the summer. It's extremely refreshing. Definitely my favorite Ommegang brew (so far)."
"Overall I am ashamed it took me soo long to try this one. It was spot on, just what I needed tonight and just what the style called for. I will make this my go to for the style from now on for sure."
"Poured a golden yellow with a huge, fluffy long-lasting head, good lacing. Plenty of activity with lots of bubbles rising up from the bottom. Smell reminiscent of a few other Belgians I've tried. Smooth and sweet at first, with a bit of a spicy bite at the end. Citrusy/fruity with a hop kick. Dry. The carbonation is tickly on the tongue. Very drinkable. This fits into the category of beers you need to know the ABV of beforehand. The 7.7% is very well masked."
"O - A flavorful and unique beer. Not something I'd want on a regular basis but a nice treat."
"Future outlook: Nice, solid tasting, versatile drinker. After being hugely disappointed in my sampling of Ommegang's ""Chocolate Indulgence," this offering has restored my faith that they can produce a quality beer. I'd have this brew again anytime."
"Incomparably smooth upon first drink, with a mild spark that quickly mellows to release a great number of flavors to envelope the tongue - hops, orange, lemon, something mildly floral, and other flavors that lull you into complete submission. And it's a flavor that sticks with you for a long time - rolling around in your mouth like a handful of glass marbles - a full ten minutes later, it's still with you."
"obey the label and drink it cool (not cold)"
"D- A very enjoyable beer that represents the style really well."
"Spritzy and sour; lots of yeast bite. Quite light in the body. Tastes as if there is a lot of wheat in this beer."
"A very nice beer."
"Slightly cloudy straw colored body with a massive white head. Tons of visible carbonation. Good wheaty body with lemon notes. There is a good bit of spice throughout including cloves. The body is pretty chewy and medium to heavy bodied. Nice feel on the mouth, very smooth. Pretty decent, a bit spicier than I like, but not bad at all."
"D- Excellent! This is good beer."
"mouthfeel is nice and bubbly, dry, lingering bitterness, lots of nice flavors blended well with a funky yeast backdrop - extremely drinkable almost deceptively so at the abv"
"I normally don't prefer this type of beer (it was misrepresented on the menu), but I would recommend it to anyone who likes a farmhouse brew. Nice, very nice."
"Drinkability is very good. This one goes down easy and isn't too strong so you can enjoy more of them than your average Belgian style."
"7/4/7/4/15 (3.7/5)"
"Okay. This is not so much a review as it is a warning. First I have to say that I'm a big fan of Omm brews. And all the reviews of Hennepin are pretty accurate concerning appearance, smelll, etc. But one reviewer said ""The beer finishes with sweet notes and yeast"". I'd say it finishes with a bitter over hopped taste that lingers until you brush your teeth. Now you serious beer guys aren't going to like this, but in the spirit of keeping the gravity, I cut this ale with Keystone Ice rather than flush it. I'll stick with the Ommegang Abbey Ale. Like I said earlier, I can't disagree with the myriad of excellent reviews of this offering from Ommegang, if this style suits your taste. But if, like me, you were introduced to Ommegang through their Abbey Ale or Wheat...Whit...Weiss, whatever you choose to call it, the Hennepin is a different beast."
"D - Quite drinkable... The ABV is well hidden... This beer does it right in all aspects... Worth drinking again and again..."
"D: Pretty good."
"(rated Mar 22, 2007)"
"Notes - A very interesting and refreshing brew and my first taste of a saison-styled ale. Overall, quite a good brew to pick for the summer to quench the thirst for a good beer that won't knock you on your ass and that has a great flavor to match. Definitely recommended."
"Drinkability - high. Another smooth, delicious Belgian Blond Ale that you could easily drink all night. And compared to some, the 7.7ABV is downright low, so drink away!"
"Cheers!!!"
"While I prefer Ommegang's Rare VOS and Abbey Ale to this one, it's a very interesting beer. I'll have to come back to it someday and see how I feel about it."
"Pours a beauiful golden color with a big creamy white head. Spicy aroma of coriander and citrus. Carbonationup front that is not too overpowering. Spicy with ntes of citrus balanced out by a hint of slight malt. The amount of spice perfectly balances out the sweet/sour flavor and reults in a crisp dry finish. Very good."
"Pours a nice hazy straw gold with a medium white head. Decent retention and lacing. Smells of sweet candi sugar and a malt, along with some yeasty character and citrus esters. Some tart notes with a bit of alcohol present. Taste is sweet and slightly fruity initially. Light tangy notes come through later, along with alcohol at the end. Feel is pretty decent; not at all watery and with a good amount of carbonation. Overall, not a bad beer, but too sugary-sweet and too much alcohol presence for a saison."
"A great value."
"Definite enjoyable, although the fruit flavors and high carbonation were almost overwhelming the other characteristics at times. Definitely a fan of this one and it's a fair representation of the style... not to mention easy to find, which is always a plus as far as I'm concerned."
"D- very easy to finish this one. the first time ive reviewed a saison and found this one to be much tamer than some others ive tried. the brett character is alot weaker than most, which might be a good thing as its not something that im too crazy about. this would be a good one to introduce people to the idea of wild yeast. cheap and very available, this ones a keeper."
"Pours a pale yellow color with a slight haze and even slighter transparency. monster white head with beautiful lacing. Sweet malts and mild funk in the nose other notes include sweetened grapefruit, plum, apple and grape. Great balance, more hop presence than you'd expect to find in a saison, fruity but with a very solid and very Belgian yeast character. Clean and refreshing, probably the best American version of the Belgian classic. Medium body, good carbonation and damn drinkable!"
"Smooth, crisp and clean refreshing taste. Good brew."
"D= ok, the alcohol taste turns me away a little. Too many and you would get pretty drunk so I'm gonna say its just good"
"Taste was light and watery, notes of citrus fruit and spices - cardamom, clove, pepper along with a sour yeast flavor. A metallic tin flavor leaves an unpleasant aftertaste. This ale lacks substance: almost no carbonation, very light, oily on the tongue. More substance and more carbonation would go a long way toward saving this ale, as long as the tin flavor could be vanquished."
"D: Very drinkable beer."
"D- Excellent. one bottle is enough to get you drunk quite well"
"Cheers!"
"Had this on draft, served in an official Hennepin goblet. The appearance is good, light in color, with a nice head. The small is a potent whiff of alcohol and other grainy ingredients beyond my humble experience to describe. The beer tastes like numerous Belgians I used to drink back in the day, quite impressive for a domestic beer. I had one, but one of my friends was on his 4th one when I showed up, and didn't look any worse for wear, so it's pretty drinkable in spite of its elevated alcohol. A very nice drink of beer that takes you overseas."
"Drinkability is high. A solid beer, and a nice showing for a saison. No major complaints."
"I bought this beer in summer. I stored this beer in my beer fridge at 65 and dropped temp down to 50. I have to wonder how good this beer would be if it was stored better by total wine or via delivery."
"Pours a clear golden color with about a finger of persistent rocky white head. Aroma seems to be somewhat subdued (its just not very strong) though relatively complex. A yeasty aroma is most dominant with light fruits (banana, pear, apple, peach) and a bit of white pepper. Taste is like the aroma but a bit stronger. At first it is creamy and mild with a light maltyness but then pears, peaches, and some light bananas take over. As we near the finish a peppery spicyness becomes more pronounced and builds through the finish. There is some occasional heat here, seems to be from the spices as it doesn't seem like any other hot alcohol I've taste. Doesn't seem too dry despite being well attenuated. Body is medium-light with very high carbonation. Overall its very creamy with a moderate alcohol presence that plays well with the other flavors. Drinkability is pretty darn good, this beer is relatively complex yet accessible. Very enjoyable, recommended."
"D: Like the other farmhouse ales that I've had, really drinkable; just the right spot between complexity and simplicity and thus easy to drink while still being interesting."
"D: This is an excellent drinking farmhouse ale."
"D Great. I could easily drink the whole 750 ml bottle from which this came in a session."
"All and all, a pretty good beer, but I don't think I want to try it again. There are beers in this style that are so much better."
"This beer pours a light golden color with a nice fluffy white head that quickly diapears. The smell is real funky with yeast and citrus notes. The taste is very clean spicy, citrusy. The spiciness pleasantly lingers. The mouthfeel is smooth, spicy and has medium body. Drinkability is high and the higher than average alcohol is barely noticeable. Overall one of my favorite U.S. Belgian style beers."
"This is a tasty beer, but I just don't think I can get myself to like Saisons all that much."
"The smell was real funky. You have to be a funk a holic to enjoy this one. Luckily I enjoy it. It gave off bananas, spice and a citrus orange smell. The taste was peppery, spicy and was like sour fruit. In the mouth it was highly carbonated with the pepper leaving the mark. Overall it was pretty damn good."
"Poured from a 750ml bottle. Appearance is a hazy golden straw color with a thin, white head. Aroma is heavy on straw and light fruits. White grapes, maybe? Taste follows suit with mild fruitiness balanced by a bit of mustiness and spice. Complex flavors here. Light carbonation and mouthfeel. Goes down easy. Great tasting brew from Ommegang."
"Review was from notes from the Albany Microbrew festival."
"This was my first Saison and my second Ommegang. Even though I don't think the style is going to become my new favorite this beer is great and Ommegang continues to impress me."
"note: the price on the ommegang stuff is such a deal that you'd be silly not to taste up and down the line."
"D: This is an all-star, one of the best Belgians I've had yet. Ommegang has a star and this is my favorite of ther lineup. I love the rawness of the ale, really fits the style well. This is a winner and a must try for those looking for an American Saison."
"Poured a moderately cloudy golden color with a lively white head. Excellent retention and lacing. Smells sour and spicy, very true to French and Belgian saisons. Hoppy, bright, earthy, and crisp. Tart Belgian yeasts, fantastic palate of spice and hops. Deliciously light and dry mouthfeel. This beer is excellent for it's taste, drinkability, and value. A real winner for American beers."
"You can't beat the price as with all Ommegang beers and I will put this taste wise against a lot o similar Belgains."
"Very drinkable, especially as a day-to-day kind of brew. When I want something special though, I grab a bigger bolder saison."
"Pours a orange amber that is cloudy with a rocky foamy quickly disappearing head. Nose is slight sour funky with a nice yeast underpinning. Some light citrus and hay also. Taste is way to strong on the alcohol. Thats all you taste up front. Creamy body with a lot of yeast and a lightly hoppy and lightly bitter finish of spice. As a western take on a saison though, this works pretty well. Lingering notes of Caramel and Vanilla and a very slight sour note redeem this one."
"D: Very smooth as the alcohol is very masked for having a moderately high ABV. After a few a tastes though, you can start to feel its kick. For being remarkably light tasting though, it can be quite an enjoyable session. Different and really enjoyable beer if you're looking for a little something but nothing overbearing."
"Very good american rendition of this style."
"Celebrating some new glassware, this brew is poured into THE Hennepin footed bulb... and forms a thick, foamy cloud that traces quite well.... body is a sediment-laden transparent orange-brown head... handosme and stout.... floral notes with grape and soft hops--a bit of lemon and something sweet... inviting... medium-bodied, lively on the tongue and effervescent on the mouth.... more than drinkable, but slightly more alcoholic than the average saison... fresh, crisp, hoppy in a soft citric way--somewhat tart but not candied or false--a bit of vanilla? a bit of malt in the aftertaste, but complex with some grapefruit elements... by mid-glass, hennepin setlles into a groove of Belgian elegance that belies its nationality... the Ommegang presentation two years ago at the PSU Brew Fest made this beer even more attractive--and it flirts like a true Abbey (Williams!) ale, but pulls back and only offers a soft eye--that, I can live with...."
"4.5 D: Wonderful beer. Though I prefer hoppier, darker beers, this one was a delightful change."
"pours a slightly cloudy yellow with a big white head that holds fairly well with a light to medium lace. smells great, with herbs and spice and pepper and clove. very peppery taste, with lots of spice and clove. lots of crisp carbonation and medium mouthfeel. slightly sweet and dry also. just a great taste can't wait to get more."
"It's really lovely."
"I haven't tried many others of this style yet, but I enjoyed this one."
"D: This beer is easy drinking but the feel seems to be off. Taste is good and interesting. Pretty good beer overall"
"Very golden body, this brew pours a voluminous 3 finger head and sticks to the glass. The flavors are subtle and bready with light color fruits of apricots, peaches and plums. The finish is crisp and dry, the taste lasts and cleanses the palate. Taste was very refreshing, just a hint of citrus and yeast. A very thin bodied brew, this one would be great on a hot day."
"Overall, this is an extremely high carbonated saison. Perhaps too carbonated, but not soda-like. It has a great crisp flavor and was perfect on this humid night in PA."
"I really like this beer, and is my wife's favorite, so I always have some in the house. This is a wonderful beer!"
"D: A great refreshing farmhouse with a tart citric lemons makes this a definite thirst quencher for the summer months. sure to leave you satisfied."
"Pretty drinkable here, but tastes overly spiced, whether it was or not."
"Poured from a dorked bottle into a goblet. Pours a hazy yellow with a huge, soft white head. Takes a while for the head to rescind. Lots of yeasty aromas. Bready, yet spicey as well. SOme light fruit also. Taste is fairly clean and light. Some spice and light sweetness form the malt. I get some banana and even some bubble gum. Great session saison. I love the style, but usually one glass is enough. I could drink a few of these."
"Good Saison from the Ommegang lads. Quite refreshing on a hot day in the city."
"Poured a 12 ounce bottle into a large chalice. TIt purs a hazy, straw colored yellow with a three finger head. The head had good staying power and left a hint of lace on the sides of my glass. Hennepin to me smelled of a sweet yeasty bread. This tasted sort of sweet and tart. There were also hints of fruit, perhaps pear. The brew is thin with good carbonation and is very drinkable. This is only the second saison I have had and it was much more enjoyable."
"This is a very likeable brew that pours a deep, hazy amber with an ever-so-thick head that stays for a LONG time and is accompanied by sticky, slow lacing. It smells of malt, slight hops and notes of grains. The taste is malty, with flavors of wheat, moderate hops and faint lemon. The mouthfeel is rich yet light and has just the right amount of carbonation."
"Great drinkability for a humid day in that oxymoron of places, the Brooklyn backyard. Went great with a slice of tomato pie. This beer got it all started for me, and while I've moved on somewhat, I've got much respect for it. Hope I gave it its due without sounding like a complete moron."
"Pretty much spot on for the style. I really enjoy this. Something I would recommend to lovers of the style and people that are looking to get into saison's. This needs to be in my fridge more often."
"D- I could easily go for another one on this hot summer night."
"Pours a clear bright golden color, an absolute monster white head forms, diminishing very slowly and leaving a lot of lacing in the glass. Really soft pepper in the nose, nothing too bracing, yeasty, and plenty of lemon aroma. Taste follows the nose, with some clove and pear notes, and a faint grassy hop presence. Really clean finish, medium-bodied, and refreshing as hell. Just a total classic, and one of those beers that should always be in my fridge....in fact, from now on, it will always be there, if anyone wants to check up on me."
"This was very solid, I'd gladly have it again."
"Light mouthfeel,lots of zing on the palate,excellent summer brew. Enjoyable,interesting somewat remisent of a white wine,would definatly go with the same foods.Must try beer in my book."
"This one comes out highly carbinated with a just off white head that has great retention and left some small patches of lace. The body is the color or golden honey with bubbles slipping through it constantly. The nose is a very pleasant combination of spice, fruit and a little funk. Taste is fruity to the tone of apples and pears with some clove spice and sour hints. Very nice bubbly medium crisp mouthfeel that combined with everything else makes putting a 750ml bottle of this away no problem."
"great overall flavor, mouthfeel and drinkability."
"This is the supposedly famous Saison style brew of Ommegang, NY. Great big fluffy head of clingy white head. Great retention of the cap that becomes rocky and chunky as the tasting goes on and great lacing throughout the tasting. Aromas are just a little funky, green grains (yeast and wheat), green apple with some lemon zest. Raw. The color is a rich gold which appears slightly hazy. The flavors are quite good, herbal hops, some balancing malts, a raw honey sweetness, assorted spices I have trouble putting my finger on, ALC esters as it warms. Complex and challenging. The dry finish has hints of almonds or roasted chestnuts. So deep and so well formed I would never have guessed it was American. Let alone so newly crafted. This beer tastes of tradition and pride. Famous for a reason. Dare I say it? World Class."
"This is a fairly drinkable beer, although nothing special. It's cheap though, so it has that going for it."
"Great beer that is full and still very drinkable. I can't believe I am just now trying it."
"A very nice, easily drinkable beer, and a great example of the Saison style."
"M&D - Nice balance of carbonation and alcohol warmth. Overall a good beer. Definitely worth trying."
"Drinkability- This is a great session beer."
"Pours golden orange with fluffy/billowing white head. Sweet aroma of yeast, citrus, slight hops and alcohol. Flavor begins with nice citrus and grapefruit and then transitions into crisp herbs, pepper and spice. Medium body. The head is thick and creamy, really gorgeous. Nice Saison."
"D: Definitely drinkable, not hints of the high ABV in the brew."
"I was a bit afraid of this one as I don't drink much that has a higher ABV, but my fears were unfounded. Though I could sense the alcohol as this warmed up it never became the main attraction. The flavor was way too complex for my little mouth, but I'm smart enough to know I liked this alot and will be coming back for more, and more, and then probably some more. My interest in this style is definitely stronger."
"Nice summer ale for sure, goes down very smooth and is quite refreshing."
"This is like a Belgian version of Weihenstephaner's Vitus."
"D - Normally something this high ABV would lower this score, but THIS is a great summertime/lawnmower beer for us 'snobs'."
"Pours a clean yellow color with a nice white head. In the aroma, hints of spice, corriander and a touch of cinnamon. In the taste, spicey and yeasty, hints of citrus as well. A spice bite, and a medium mouthfeel, with a dry yeasty spice in the aftertaste. A very nice saison, smooth, yet a nice spicey bite."
"/ I love ommegang 3p and abbey ale. This offering is just weak in comparison."
"HV"
"D - All in all, I definitely respect the quality of this brew - it just wasn't one of my favorites. For 7.7 abv, it wasn't too boozy at all - only a little hint of alcohol here and there."
"the birthplace of Baseball. Nice."
"D: High ABV limits this a tad; however, it's still crisp, flavorful, and delicious. Hennepin is going to have to be a staple of the spring/summer rotation for me from now on."
"Pours a rich golden orange and yellow with head and lacing that remain for the duration. The smells are sweet and slightly spicy, hops can be detected. The taste is crisp and refreshing and follows with the aromas detected. Finishes very clean. A nicely crafted beer, this is my first saison but I have had similar belgian style ales. From what I understand a saison is similar except for the way they were originally brewed. I was hoping for more flavors but the cost is reasonable for this beer. I will enjoy this one again."
"I really like the way this beer pours out of the glass. RIght away I can tell it is very carbonated from the hiss as I pour it. I tried to leave as much sediment in the bottom but the beer comes out sort of hazy. A huge foamy head arises and retains for quite some time leaving interesting shapes as it dissipates. Initially this beer gives off a skunky-lager type aroma and some citrus and somewhat sweet. The taste is very different. Clove, spices, and fruity esters shine through. The mouthfeel is extremely crisp and reminiscent of champagne."
"Very drinkable. Nice."
"Poured into a St. Bernardus chalice, pours a pale yellow with a fluffy foamy head that doesn't hang around to long no lace detected. Smell is pretty good bubbleguym, alchohol, clove and some ripe fruit. Taste is bit mild, alchohol not deteced and very refreshing taste of earth notes with a bit smoke character to this. Overall not bad I enjoyed this with some smoked gouda cheese, I believe the smoke character really intensified with the taste of the cheese. Good style that goes down pretty smooth."
"Wow is this one a winner. Great flavors and wonderfully balanced complexity."
"The mouthfeel is crisp and champagne-like, and it goes down very smoothly. Drinkability is hindered somewhat by its robust flavors but is still pretty high."
"Overall it's pretty good, but if I'm going to spend the money on an Ommegang product, I'd probably go with several others before this one."
"Pours a pale cloudy orange juice yellow with a small white head that leaves a touch of lacing.The nose is floral and faintly spicy,some sweetness also abounds.This tastes spicy and earthy from the get go,some sweet and tart flavors blend well.Lightly buiscuty throught and a hint of hoppy,grassy bitterness on the tail.The body is light to medium,drying on the tounge,and clean aftertaste is well above average.The alcohol is hard to find,until it warms and then it shows even bolder flavors in every aspect.This is a killer brew top to bottom!"
"D 4"
"I can see why this such a sought after brew. I am glad that I will now make this a staple during the Saison season. Awesome."
"Great wheat, balanced, yet extreme."
"One of the first saisons I ever tried and still love to this day."
"This brew poured a hazy golden color with a nice white foamy head, with lacing holding on the edges throughout the drinking of it. It smelled of spicy malts with some fruit in the background and maybe a bit of alcohol. It was full bodied with plenty of carbonation. Tastes of spices and citrus dominated this beer, with a nice hoppy finish. Drinkability was very nice and I will definetly be sampling this again."
"Fairly clear gold yellow color with a rocky, soapy white head. Smells of grain, light fruits... maybe banana, minerals, and... earthy funk. Fairly light, tingly hop spice, light fruit with the slightest hint of pear, minerally, some vinegary earthiness. Fairly light character but with a moderately bold spiciness. Fairly drinkable. Do not detect any alcohol... My first saison so it's hard to pinpoint the flavors or what I should expect but I don't find it overly exciting... The light sweetness or earthiness in this brew is a bit overpowered by the tingly, peppery, phenolic spice..."
"Pours a golden sunshine, light amber. At least six strong columns of tiny ubbles with a strong head directly after the pour, but quickly recedes after the initial pour. I love a grand head in a saison. The aroma is a great earthy hop and malt blend. Light notes of a barnyard,light fruits, and some grass in a Missouri prairie. The taste starts with some tart, unripened apples, light currants, and fresh cit grass. The finish shows some very lightly toasted, dry caramel malts with some mild funk. Good complex beer. Very refreshing with some light tartness. Very drnkabl, dare I say its sessionable even given its abv. This a good beer Johnny Cakes."
"Drinkability - This is very drinkable and refreshing on a hot summer day, though caution must be used because the well hidden alcohol will catch up with you :)"
"Pours a very light, yellow, straw in color. A nice inch of head forms on the pour. About, just under an inch and it's rocky. Smell is a bit funky, and spicy. Taste is more of the funk. There is a nice belgian flavor here. Very good amount of carbonation. Mouthfeel is medium, bubbly and funky. Good beer but not overly complex."
"Hazy yellow color. One finger fine bubbled white head that falls quickly. Sheets of lace drop quickly to the halo of a cap. A gently swirl brings back a small head. Smell is spicey pepper and clove with just a faint fruityness. Taste matches the smell. Only the mildest of bitterness in the finish but any sweetness is supurbly balanced giving a very dry clean finish. High level of carbonation with tons of tingle on the tongue. Another excellent beer from Ommegang."
"D - Not my favorite style but very good and very easy to drink. Makes a great summer beer; almost as if that was the intent ;-)"
"Drinkability: I could drink this like water, the 7.7 abv is so well hidden, it's downright dangerous. Respect."
"Thanks to julian for the opportunity. Pours a soft hazy straw yellow color. Nice lumpy head that is fed by a very lively amount of carbonation. Smells of earthy, grassy malts, soft spicey hops in there for balance. Some booziness is also noted in the aroma. Light mouth feel that is alive with carbonation. Lemony fruity esters mingle with a light malty sweetness, hops, and some pepper balance everything out near the end. Finish is dry but tends to have a stale grainy essence."
"M/D - Smooth and creamy feel. Very well carbonated and super drinkable. A damn good beer."
"Drinkability: I really like this beer. Great for a summer day. Well done Ommegang. I'll buy a 750ml next time."
"D - Got to be careful drinking this one, very easy to drink and stronger than your average brew. I would definately recomend this beer."
"D. Very good as well. No alcohal burn, just a nice example of the style."
"A fine outing by the gang at Ommegang. The Hennepin makes for a wonderful spring or summer treat. I liken it to Lillet in the spirits world. Makes for a great sittin'-by-the-poolside beverage when there just isn't any relief in the shade. Bottoms up."
"Flavors changed as it warmed. It took me a while to drink it, was definitely better warmer. Overall way too sweet to me. I'm new to the style, but drinkability was tough cuz of the overly sweet finish. I' going to try some more saisons, but not this one again."
"Poured into a Hennepin tulip glass at whistle Binkies North. Golden straw color, very light, but completely hazed throughout. Off-white foam that left some nice lacing. Smell is a little sour and funky with some sweet malty character to back it up. Taste is much the same. Funky farmhouse flavor, spicy, slightly sour, notes of grass, pale malt, and the slightest licorice flavor on the end. Good, slick mouthfeel with adequate carbonation. I've had this one out of a 12oz bottle before but this my first on tap. Very nice brew and prefer it from the tap personally."
"I will purchase this beer again, with no question."
"($2.70, 12oz, Oliver's Bev., Albany, NY)"
"The only drawback I can sense with this brew is the funk and tart/sour factor. I know it's not meant to have such powerful overtones, but something a little more tangy to balance the heavy citrus zing here would have made it truly exceptional. As is, though, still, a tremendous American-brewed version of a Belgian classic."
"Really, really good. I dig it."
"A light/subtle brew that is better experienced carefully and with great thought. No wild exciting flavors here, just relaxed summer evening contentment."
"D: This big bottle will do me for the afternoon, but, oh yeah, it's drinkable -- a little too drinkable."
"the drinkability on this would be a bit higher, were it not for it's nearly 8% abv. it's very easy to drink, but i'm afraid it would also be the one that would sneak up on me. goes down easy."
"Drinkability- I really like the saison style beers, and this one in particular I feel like I could drink all day."
"Overall this is a great brew and look forward toanother one from Ommegang. Hats off to a good beer!"
"Wow. This is definitely my favorite saison yet. It poured with a nice and thick 1-finger head in my St. Bernardus chalice which sustained itself, leaving some awesome looking lacing in the glass (you could even see the levels of each sip I took). The smell was straw, pale malt, and slight alcohol warmness. The taste was amazingly well balanced and smooth, which went through a series of phases before it subsided. This is the best example of a saison that I have tried yet, and I now understand why this style is so highly regarded. This stuff is great. The mouthfeel was also excellent in its smoothness and perfect carbonation. I drank a 750 by myself, and I could have easily downed another, if not two more. If you see Hennepin on the shelf, make sure to grab a bottle (or 4)."
"D: At 7.5% ABV, not sessionable, but like I said, this is a very complex and enjoyable beer. Simple if you drink it fast, but if you really slow down and enjoy it, a lot of those nuances will come out. A great beer to enjoy outside with nature during the summer."
"Drinkability- A delicious brew, a great sipper to sit down and enjoy with some brie, which im currently doing!"
"Notes: A solid beer that was past due for a review. For the price it's hard to go wrong with this stuff."
"Drinkability: Unreal, complex yet drinkable. Sweet, tart and almost bitingly crisp. I think this would be a fascinating intro for anyone who thinks they don't like beer. At $7 for a four pack I'll be picking up more soon."
"It's nice and dry, makes you want to keep the glass close for another sip, at 7.5% abv, its a dangerous one!"
"D) Purchased a few more bottles (at about $4-something per bottle), this beer is perfect on a hot summer day."
"Buy this. Now. Quit waiting."
"D- Well I don't know if I've ever drank an entire 750mL bottle by myself but I did with this so that's gotta score it some points right?"
"I will be getting and keeping this one from now on... This will be a new staple for me.."
"D: Well I'm preparing to drink the whole bottle...and I'd drink it again."
"Taste - Hennepin is tart, but not sour, which is appropriate for style. It's a little fruity, but not overpowering."
"drinkability- very drinkable and enjoyable. goes down too smoothly for a 7.7% (but that's good!) very good and easy to enjoy. Give it a try!"
"On tap at Track 84 in Warwick, RI. One of my favorite American Saisons. Pours yellowish gold with a large fluffy white head. Nose of citrus, spice, and funk. Funk very prominent in both the taste and the aroma. Finish is citrus and spice. Clean. Very nice beer."
"D- Very easy to drink and very enjoyable."
"This is one of my favorite beers, ever. An excellent example of the style, that on a blind test most drinkers would assume was imported from Belgium, not Cooperstown."
"The flavor is quite impressive. It has an orangey citrus full saison flavor that is closer to the BJCP guidelines of a saison than Saison Du Pont. Ommegang captured it well, and this beer should serve as a perfect example of the Saison style of beers available in the US. I've only had homebrew examples come this close."
"This is a beautiful beer. Golden with great bubbles like a great Champagne. Smelled of fruit and earth. Perfect feel in the mouth with a lingering finish. Paired well with an aged white cheese. Wonderful."
"Drinkability: I liked this beer quite a bit, but I found that I wouldn't be able to drink a whole lot of this in one sitting like I would with some other styles."
"I've had this both on-tap and via champagne-style bottle, and have been duly impressed each time. brilliant straw/golden in color with nice clarity. beautiful huge white creamy head that is quite persistent. continues to bubble up in the tulip glass like a fine champagne. nose is herbal, musty, floral, fruity, and sweet. very complex bouqet overall, and it should be noted that i normally do not favor the barnyardy/musty notes but it works quite well for me in this one. honeyed lightly sweet bready malts are mysteriously cleaned out by an extremely smooth hop bitterness, vague spiciness, and prickly carbonation. wonderful balance. medium-bodied with good mouthfeel from this expertly done secondary fermentation. a real treat and a fine example of a saison, if i may venture to say so."
"pours a gold color with a huge, frothy white head. the nose is lemons, bananas, cloves, some sort of dry, chalky aroma. definately a pleasing aroma. tastes of spicy hops, cloves, citrus, lemons. medium bodied, medium to heavy natural carbo. good stuff"
"D- I could pair this one with many different meals. I will introudce this one to a lot of my friends who do not yet appreciate beer."
"This is a great version of this style. If I had this in a blind taste test, I'd never believe it was brewed in the US. Really well done."
"This beer is alive inside! After popping the cork and pouring into the glass, the head is alive! Frothyness lasted quite some time until it rested. The beer is a hazy golden colour, tastes of citrus come to the palate. After the beer warms close to room temp, there are hints of mild hoppiness. Overall a pleasant, refreshing brew to savor!"
"Very smooth and easyto drink without sacrificing any flavor. This is one I'll definitely come back to."
"This is the beer to pair with a big stinky cheese."
"Smooth, rich, and tingly in the mouth with a nice clean finish. Nutty, yeasty character lingers; extremely drinkable and damned delicious."
"This is an excellent beer that leaves you craving another sip. The bomber goes fast, and I have found this is a great beer to share with friends who may be new to good beer."
""
"Notes: This is a fantastic looking beer, and the taste is truly one of a kind. I will revisit this one an awful lot, and urge you to pick one up if you haven't tried it. Quite obviously a cousin of Duvel."
"This was my first taste of this style of beer, and if this one is any indication, I will be looking for more of this style."
"D- I realy enjoy this style, especially on this hot day. I feel like this is a strong representation of this style, and Ommegang's skills."
"D- I liked this beer and initally tried it because it it the America sister brewery to Duvel and it was the strong ale version. Having said that you can tell a distinction between the two, while both are very strong ABV this one seems to be heavier even though it is not as strong. This was a good beer and I would drink it again but given the choice between the two I would pick Duvel everytime."
"EDIT: Having another bottle and pouring it more carefully yields clumpy splotches of lace, thick clumps at that! So got to raise the score again."
"In addition, for the price it can not be defeated."
"A good beer, even though I'm not a fan of the style. Mouthfeel was decently chewy."
"This is possibly one of the best beers that I have ever had. It was on-tap and served in a tulip glass. It was a slightly hazy yellow/wheat color. It had a very white head that was retained for a little while. It gave off a nice citrus aroma with additional hints of spices and yeast. At first I thought this was a Witbier until the bartender told me otherwise as the taste did have similar characteristics. The carbonation was good and the beer was very smooth. Overall this beer is very drinkable in any setting, perhaps not as a session beer, but should be enjoyed early and often."
"D - Nice brew. I don't know why it took me so long to try this beer, but I will not hesitate trying this beer again. Alcohol is well masked."
"D - Could have one after another. Medium body coupled with intense flavor makes for an easy sipper. Not only does it improve with warmth, but also gets smoother after repeated bottles."
"This is a good beer and I certainly enjoyed the bottle, but if I had my druthers I'd prefer a saison that's more fruity with just a touch more sweetness. Still, I certainly wouldn't turn Hennepin down when presented with it."
"All I can say is pure liquid gold. It pours a murky gold color with a white two finger head. It had a grainy,citrusy smell with a bit of hops thrown in. Big citrus and wheat flavor with a bit of honey. A very refreshing and crisp beer. It is easily a session beer for me."
"Drinkability - Good! Very smooth and easy drinking...7.7% ??? I was very impressed with this one."
"pours a cloudy light orange color with a beautiful white head on it, looks very yummy. smell is great, spicy, with almost a ginger like smell to it. taste is magnificent. its a perfect balance of alcohol sharpness, yeast, spicy hops, and mild malt. just a wonderful blend of everything a belgian should be. i wonder how the flemish feel about ommegangs beers. its amazing that is is as good as it is and as readily available as it is."
"5/31/10--updating review. Upgrading smell. Lots of good stuff going on with this brew. I'm surprised it's 7.7% abv; would have pegged it around 5.5% Goes down very easy. Lots of citrus and cloves. Great to look at with its pale yellow hue and pure white head. Some butteriness."
"I believe this is my first saison. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I do like it. This one is definitely worth a try."
"D = This is an okay beer, but I cannot rate it's drinkability too high. It is both too strong and too weak for me to really want to sit back and enjoy it. On the one hand, it has some potential scents and flavors, but at the same time doesn't seem to quite live up to the those since they are either too soft to really be a great funky beer, or too strong to make it a simple enjoyable beer. I'll have to come back to this again though because I have a sense I may simply not be in the right mood for it."
"d: This is a fantastic example of a style I don't pay nearly enough attention to."
"A perfect Belgian-style Saison for any season."
"The aroma is a wonderful lemony amalgam of delicious floral hops and bubble gum/hint of band-aid. Active carbonation conveys a light, crisp, stimulating experience. Sweetness up front with tangy lemony acidity and complex floral hoppy bittereness in perfect balance. Peppery allspice, long but restrained pink grapefruit finish. Delicious!"
"The appearance is golden yellow with a hazy body. A wonderful three finger head builds from lively carbonation. The head slowly fades back leaving nice lacing on the glass. Its aroma is fruity and floral, citrus and spice and every thing nice. The flavor of light malts, citrus and clove hits you first. Then earthy yeast and complementary citrus and floral hops leads you to a sweet and sour finish. Well balanced, medium body and very refreshing. Very well done, this one has turned me on to this style of beer."
"D: A nice combination of the mouthfeel and the smooth, banana ester/malty taste made this a nice beer. Definitely at least worth a session if not a sixer."
"Final thoughts - Clean and refreshing. If I had just one word to describe it would be outstanding."
"I'd rate this a great summer beer. The hazy gold color looks pleasant in a pint glass, and its fizziness would go down well on any hot, humid evening. Overall, I found it happily undemanding-- the taste is not so complex, but I enjoyed the straw and honey flavors, with some fruitiness as well. Definitely worth drinking again. And again. Love the bottle, too. I have yet to go wrong with Ommegang."
"D- A nice and complex beer. I will certainly buy this one again."
"This is a great beer, but I guess I didn't think it was as great as most other people."
"Mouthfeel is very crisp and refreshing. Alcohol is hidden well. This goes down very easily."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium bodied. Carbonation is excellent. This one goes down too easy. Drinkability is very high. It is a bit strong, but drinkability is not limited at all. Overall, this is very good beer. Definitely pick it up."
"D: This will be good to hang out with for a while. Not a session beer, but that is not the intention here."
"D: Great beer to complement a summer meal of BBQ chicken and a cold salad. It was refreshing and entertaining."
"Although not my favorite sytle, but this beer and the style as a whole comand respect. A must try for all beer lovers."
"D= I like this beer a lot, once it reaches optimal serving temperature!"
"D- A solid saison that I will revisit again, but not the best I have ever had."
"A 750 mL bottle of wonderful brew. Dull golden color, slightly cloudy, topped off with a big voluptuous cap of foam. A big nose: citrus, green apples dipped in caramel, cloves and peppery spice all entwined. It keeps coming in waves and waves. The beer seduces the palate with a sharpness and acidity opening the way for a pear fruitiness and malt sweetness. Noticeable carbonation and very refreshing. A spiciness envelopes the entire experience and is most noticeable in the finish. A great and complex beer."
"Outstanding. Clover honey coloring. Crisp with nice citrus flavors. Floral. There are also hints of maybe apple or pears. Mouthfeel is outstanding...thick. I will remember this one for summer sipping. This one may have changed my opinion of the Saison style."
"I don't know that I have sampled many saison style brews but if they taste like this one, I'm all for more! This went down so well that I'm ready to keep this one as regular stock in the fridge after just tasting it once. I have been very impressed with the Ommegang brewery and this one is just another jewel in their crown. Fantastic!!"
"Noting that it's brewed in Cooperstown, home of the Hall of Fame, my wife proclaimed it a future ""vacation destination"". Fine by me!"
"Poured a golden straw color that was slightly cloudy with a fluffy two finger white head that left some chunky lacing throughout. Smelled of the typical farmhouse horse blanket with a hint of some citrus and peppery tones. The taste starts out sweet and citrusy and then gets a little funky with some straw and pepper spiciness. Very great version of the style. Ommegang keeps surprising me with their belgian style but given their origins I can understand how they do it. The mouthfeel on this one was a little thick but the carbonation helped tone it down and make it very refreshing."
"This is such a great beer. I bought the 750ml thinking it would last me for days when I could have easily finished it in one sitting. Instead, I finished it in two. This is an easy drinker, yet a sipper. This is my first saison and I did a lot of research about the style before trying this. I feel this fits the category perfectly."
"Still would love it on a hot summers day. I will keep on keepin on."
"D- Well, although this comes in a 4 pack, it is quite drinkable. I think this is a brew best served with food, such as some bbq chicken, or a gyro (which is how I initially tried this brew).... *Recommended"
"Forget wine - bring a .750 L bottle of Hennepin to your next dinner party. Very pleased that this is a domestic brew - it tastes decidedly Belgian."
"Drinkability is great; this is just a pleasure to enjoy on its own or with food."
"Pours a clear golden wheat color. Semi-spicy aroma. Unfortunately, on-tap this misses a lot of the yeast and other sediment that one gets from a bottle pour. Taste includes spices and citrus, but the yeast flavor isn't present. Still totally drinkable and nice, but it's much more enjoyable poured from the bottle."
"This is very light on the palate and a pleasure to open up a 750 and sip it over time. Suggest as most do a glass/vessel with a wide-open mouth to best capture the flavorful aroma of this Belgian bombshell by way of Otsego County, NY. Very well done."
"This is a tasty and powerful beer. It reminded me of a Belgian Tripel and fans of that style would be very much at home here. It tasted of wheat, fresh yeast, and intense warming alcohol. It went down very smooth and it was deceptively intoxicating. It was quite enjoyable and I'd have it again."
"D: Satisfying... easily could drink another"
"My first Siason... I'm kind of excited! Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a slightly hazy straw color with a HUGE, soapy white head that looks like Swiss-cheese. The nose is similar to a Belgian Wit; phenolic with banana and cloves, slightly peppery, maybe some coriander. Taste is similar; there is a slight biscuity flavor about it with the slightly sweet, peppery cloviness coming to the forefront and being countered by a moderate bitterness of hops and alcohol. The alcohol has a slight warming effect but isn't overly noticeable in flavor. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a creamy, slightly aggressive carbonation. Drinkability is decent, but I think the cloviness and alcohol might get to you after a while. Overall, an excellent beer - I look forward to trying other Siasons in the future."
"D- smooth and refreshing, this would be great in the late spring after workin in the garden all day."
"Drinkability: You'd NEVER guess 7.7% abv!... very well hidden. I could enjoy a few of these in a sitting."
"Overall- I'm not an expert on Saisons, but I will say that this is a refreshing complex ale and a fine beer. When I try more of this style I will appreciate or depreciate it more based on its competitors."
"mouthfeel is a little thin, but smooth and well carbonated. this is a good beer, but over rated in my opinion, just nothing special going on in this one. I probably wouldn't pick it over most of the other beers available."
"There seems to be a lot of carbonation in the mouthfeel but it's not making me burp. Body is light and refreshing. Alcohol is only detectable with significant warming. Another quality Ommegang brew."
"Poured into a Hennepin glass, formed a 1 1/2"" eggshell head over the effervescent golden brew. Head lasts well, due to rejuvenation from all the bubbles, with beautiful frothy lace covering everywhere. Aroma is subtle notes of sweetness coupled with light fruitiness. Taste is upfront with sweet pale malts, switching to some spiciness and light fruits, and a crisp light close. Not really any sharp edges here, probably the cave-aging at work. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both excellent. A nice saison, perhaps not as complex as some others out there, but worth your time."
"Pours an attractive straw-yellow with a thick billowy head. The aroma is a nice blend of floral hops and earthy yeast. The taste is lightly sweet with orange and apple fruits, and slight hop bitterness. The 7.7% ABV is only barely noticeable. Nice and easy."
"I'm glad I tried this...overall, not a bad beer, but one I'm not sure I'll go out of my way for."
"Overall: For someone who usually sticks to ipa's and such, I'm totally glad that I tried this beer style. I think I may have found a new favorite."
"Overall- I would like for it to have been a little dryer than sweet, BUT it was a very good brew and was true to style in all other aspects."
"Pours a very nice golden yellow color, awesome carbonation, nice two-finger white creamy head, lots and lots of great sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty/yeasty, nice touch of spices, and some slight caramel. The taste is slightly sweet at first, some slight bitterness/tangy, yeasty/spicy. Medium body. Drinkable, a very tasty Saison, one of the best I've had."
"This is the third installment of the Ommegang tasting that I am offering to Beer Advocate. I have had this beer several times before and now have decided to review it. The beer poured into my 211/8th fl. Oz. snifter with an enormous head. It shortly subsided with massive lacing on the inside of the glass. The nose was heavy with hints of yeast and sweet grass. The taste is light and sweet with apples. Ommegang has hit another homerun with Hennepin...kudos Brewery Ommegang!"
"D: Eminently drinkable. Very versatile beer. Perfect in the summer heat, with spicy food, thick burgers, or to complement simple fare of bread and cheese. Also great on its own. Ommegang has a stable of fine beers, but Hennepin out-shines the rest."
"Not a huge saison fan, but this way did blow me away. Had before from bottle, this was first on tap and did it justice."
"All in all, this brew was outstanding. If there is a more impressive saison out there, I have yet to try it."
"The mouthfeel is light with very high carbonation. This is a fairly drinkable beer, but the high carbonation level would prevent too much imbibing."
"D - These are really great and easy to drink, I could imagine someone new to craft brewing enjoying this beer alot. There's nothing overpowering about the smell or taste and the alcohol is hidden well. I will buy this again."
"Deceptively high ABV , otherwise a beer I could drink all night."
"Pours a slightly hazy bright yellow color with a full finger loose white head that fades to surface but is kept alive by substantial effervescence. The smell is aggressive earthy Belgian yeast, sweet and a little fruity, a banana-pear character. The tiny bubbles lend a creamy texture to the mouth feel. It has a light-medium body. Full flavored, the earthy malt and fruit character of the nose is true to taste. There is also a spicy note about it that lingers nicely. A real nice drinker. I've used it to cook beer-can chicken before and it came out great."
"Tastes of spices, earthy hops and some fruits. It took a little time but I really started to enjoy this by mid bottle. Very well done but it seems more like a witbier/tripel to me (not that it matters to anyone)."
"Bought a 4-pack of this at my local store and I really enjoyed it. It poured a cloudy wheat color with a small, sticky head. Sweet fruity smell -- makes me wish it was a warm weekend instead of a cold January. Tasted somewhat sweet but not too sweet. Also some wheat/grain taste with some spice...maybe clove. Great flavor that isn't any too stong on one flavor but still different flavors to each mouthful. Easy to drink and a pleasure to drink. Wish it was a six-pack as opposed to a four-pack..."
"I felt this beer was a bit overrated. It was tasty but nothing about it really stood out to me. It smells a bit like honey and looks attractive in a glass. It has an interesting mouthfeel with a crisp flavor. There are hints of spice, grain and a tiny bit of hops in a sip. The finish is dry but its light enough to be drinkable. When thinking back on my first experience with this style, I remembered enjoying Dupont more. However, I'd have to try it again to explain what I liked about that brew. Although considering the quality I was surprised to see this was a domestic beer. I have a feeling I need to try more Saisons to see if my bias is against the style rather than the brewery."
"I'll just go ahead and say I'm very impressed with this farmhouse ale. The best American example that I have ever had the privilege of tasting and, at the very least, the funkiest."
"edit: okay... i get it. this is a grisette, not a saison. i have tried many many times, but i just can't take this beer. i avoid this beer like the plague. it is the sam adams of belgian-style beer. toned down and dummied up to suit unschooled palates. sorry ommegang, i appreciate what you do for us, i just don't like this one."
"Hennepin pours a nice golden peach color with a bit of a haze. Massive fluffy head seems to be lingering quite well. great lace. nose is wonderful wheat and barnyard funk. Clearly some strong spice in here as well. Great hard saison taste. Very pronounced wheat and yeast flavor with good peppery spiciness. This is no Dupont but it is quite good. At this point the haze is starting to fade a little bit from warmth, but is still very present. Flavors are becoming earthier at this point. The aftertaste has some nice banana notes. The mouthfeel is slightly abrasive on the tongue, but overall quite good. Drinkability is solid on this one, and is impressive. Overall this is a great saison style, certainly one of the best in america. Props to ommegang, I think this is my favorite brew from them."
"Would I drink it again? Certainly. Would I *buy* it again? Not at that price point--there are better alternatives."
"Another great beer from Ommegang... those folks up there in New York sure do know their Belgian brews... an excellent rendition of the style... full of style and flavor... great appearance with visible carbonation, off-yellow, and nice foamy head... sweet smell of fruits, citrus, and slight alcohol... great crispy, fruity, lemon-citrus taste with hints of esters and alcohol... the 7.7% ABV is noticeable, but not at all overwhelming... a thick, full-flavored beer that really hits home... mouthfeel is good, and if it weren't for the hefty alcohol percentage, drinkability would definitely be better... great example of the style... authentic and classy... a really good brew... another winner from Ommegang... Recommended..."
"This was my first Ommegang beer, as well as the first saison/farmhouse ale I've had. I'd have to say this was a super first go. It had a somewhat opaque appearance, with an amber hue. There was a strong odor of fruit about this one. It tasted strongly of bananas and other spices, giving it a smooth yet vibrant finish. This is lovely beer, one that you can easily get attached to."
"D - I enjoyed this brew a lot I thought it was very good very easy to drink I would recommend this beer"
"D: Great brew, very tasty and drinkable. This one really sets a bar, especially for an American Belgian."
"Poured a 750 into a Chimay chalice (3 pours). Pours a hazy golden color with a huge bright white head that has left no lacing down the glass. The aroma is amazing. This beer has more distant aromas then any other I've had. There is Nutmeg, coriander, earth, yeast, bread, and a plethora of others that I just can't name yet because my nose isnt refined enough yet. I definitely need to return to this beer later. Taste is spicy, lots of nutmeg along with cinnamon and allspice with an earthly, alkaline taste to boot. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a bit of carbonation. An oily residue coats your mouth with this earthy goodness. Great beer."
"Absolutely one of my favorite Saisons, and one of my all-time favorites of any style."
"D - @ 7.7% it's hardly a session brew but 1 or 2 is just about all you need. I guess thats why they sell it in 4 packs!!"
"Light-medium in body, clean and crisp. Pretty good drinkability, but a little too tart and complex to have more than 1 or 2. Solid refreshing beer with complexity."
"Very nice beer from upstate New York. Ommegang has several great beers, but this is the one that I seem to purchase most often."
"Pours a slightly fogged straw color. Nice white head. Nose is yeast funk with strong citrus and dough tones. Flavor is funky dough with an obvious yeast influence. Feel is a bit thicker on the liquid, it's the dough character peeking through again. Drinkable, yes. Not as good as I remember it being on the bottle though. Possibly a prime example of how bottle conditioning can really make a difference in certain beers."
"Bottle poured a light pale straw color with a hint of orange to it. Head was rich and fluffy white with many small bubbles that faded down to a good 2-3 fingers. It smells quite like fruits and citrus such as peaches, bananas, and oranges. It also has a somewhat spicy wheat aroma to it. The taste is sweet and fruity like the smell. Not a lot of hops with just a small bitterness to round it off. It has smooth mouthfeel that isn't real thin and watery but isn't thick and syrupy. All in all, it is a very good drinkable swill. I was expecting a little more out of it, but still enjoyed it."
" Poured out into a small Ommegang 10 yr anniversary goblet. Lovely hazy color, reminiescent of Hoegaarden.Nice foamy head,dissapates rather quickly.Citrus, wheats, spicy pepper,straw,hay,yeast on the nose. Delicious sweet apricot,peppery,citrus flavors. finish is tart and biting. Good slightly sticky mouthfeel. For the abv, very drinkable"
"drinkability  Drank this almost a year later, pretty good. Anything from Ommegang is good. Worth a try."
"this is my 1st. saison, i'm amazed at how close to a Belgian strong pale ale this style is ; pours a slightly cloudy pale golden colour w/ a decent, fluffy, white head which falls a bit too quickly but leaves a good bridge-like lacing in my snifter ; a sour, malty smell w/ a touch of hops, and some banana-like alcoholic fruitieness in the nose ; a full, crisp, pilsener-like malt flavor w/ a small amount of hops, a bit sour w/ some fruity esters and an aftertaste similar to a buttery Czech yeast profile ; amazingly light , especially for a 7.7 ABV, a bubbly one, too ; an awesome beer, i'll keep this one on hand at all times...."
"Pours a cloudy yellow/orange color with plenty of white and foamy, rocky head. A heavy amount of lacing sticks around on the side of the glass. Smell is of belgian spices, clove, banana, bubblegummy type bouquet. Taste is very sweet and dull in the finish with a creamy mouth feeling."
"The carbonation was spot on ... constant bubbling and very effervescent, this beer felt alive. The second pour I managed to coax all the yeast into the beer and it pushed the taste to 4.5 territory with a bit more bitterness and spicy-ness. I wanted to drink more right after putting the glass down on my desk."
"I'm not a big Belgian drinker. I like them, but infrequently consume them. This is one that makes me change my mind."
"First rate product, not to be passed up."
"D - Great, I could drink this all day."
"A cloudy golden liquid pours from the bottle with a two finger head in my wide mouth goblet. The smell is distinctly similar to a pino grigio or dry white wine with an astringenty kind of smell. The taste is at first tart, but mild fruit esters and a strong phenol spicyness comes through and then diminishes to expose a lovely malty backbone. This beer is sharply carbonated with a moderate body. Despite its subdued flavor profile the tart-spicy-malty transition is infinitely interesting to my taste buds and I find it draws me to that next sip before I really get to understand the first. I need more. Damn good beer."
"Very good beer. Remind me of why I like belgians."
"Mouthfeel is prickily yet creamy, and the drinkability is quite good."
"A very tasty, well made, elegant saison. The yeast and the noble hops shine."
"Very good beer, was longing for another."
"Light to medium body, and eminently drinkable. I'd love to have had another to share. Really just an all around pleasant experience for one of my first ventures into this style."
"Big white, rocky head, fairly persistent, leaves lots of foamy lacing on the glass. Pale straw color with a bit of hazyness. Phenolic/estery/spicy aroma typical of many Belgian yeasts, sweet pilsner malt smell. Light sweetness to the taste with dry finish. Bittered to balance; not excessive. A surprising softness to the mouthfeel . Drinkable, but the alcohol catches up to you."
"D-This is a very smooth and drinkable beer.It is a great example of Saison/Farmhouse style.At 7.7% I don't know about a session but why not! The complexity of this beer reminds me why I like Belgian Ales and will continue to try others from Brewery Ommegang."
"Overall: This was a very pleasant beer, I really enjoyed it. The spices weren't overbearing, but did linger as time went on. Tart and fruity, great on a summer day...and with that hint of alcohol warmth, nice on a 34 degree night (like this one.)"
"The taste is the same as the aroma. Fruity with some cupboard spices with just a touch of alcohol detected on finish. I don't get much of any hops and the malt is understated which is a bit of a disapointment. It is almost like a wine cooler or one of those malt beverages. It has a nice body with good carbonation. A saison on the overly sweet side but it does taste good but not really something that a person could drink a lot of in a day."
"First review of an Ommegang beer for me and it was an above average brew, will add an Ommegeddon review some time soon when I taste that beer again after it has been aging for a while"
"D: I enjoy this one. I think if I were trying to introduce people to the style I would offer this one before going to more robust and complex examples. Also, for quenching a thirst this is very nice. For matching up with savory foods may not be its role, but well worth repeating. (4.0)"
"Drinkability: the 7.7% alcohol is well hidden within a lively crisp ale that leaves my mouth wanting another."
"Don't drink and review."
"Poured into my tulip glass. The beer pours a beautiful golden straw hue with a dense cloudy interior and a huge billowy white head. You can also notice a massive amount of yeast in the bottle from the bottle conditioning. The nose is fruity, spicy, bready, and bit hoppy. The taste is very refreshing with fresh fruit flavorings coming to the palate including apples and lemon with a certain earthy graininess coming to the back of the palate, and a sweet malt profile makes itself known as the beer warms a little more. The mouthfeel is interesting due to the high carbination in the beer. Very refreshing and inviting in the mouth, and it doesn't leave a very heavy coat in your mouth. The drinkability is great for this offering. Perfect to share with someone over a meal or just by yourself."
"It has the same (relatively) light feel, but a little more spice and earthiness that makes it a great introduction to the style for those who are scared off by a strong ""horse blanket"" characteristic. Definitely recommended."
"D: i could definately go for a few of these on a warm summer evening. very refreshing and easy to drink but it's got enough punch to make it an end of the night beer. certainly worth searching out."
"A nice Saison. Not the most complex, and quick to reveal, but nice. I've come to enjoy, and subsequently look forward to, the simplistic complexity & slow ""burlesque"" reveal these typically provide. While tasty, this left little to discovery after the first few sips. In short, its short on foreplay, more of a quickie as far as taste. I did like it, and would pare very well with just about any cheese, some nice artisan bread, cured meats, seafood, a nice salad, etc. I'd definitely drink this again in a heartbeat, but if given the choice between this & others of the genre would probably pick the others. Its a great bang for the buck and would probably be helped by food, but there are better examples to be had. Still, definitely worth checking out."
"This was a much improved Saison over my first experience. I may have to go back to that one again to see if I did something wrong with the temperature or what. A moderate amount of lacing was noticed as I consumed the beer. I definitely would buy this again and will also consider some of the other Ommegang products."
"Drinkability: A unique and refreshing beer. This affordable beer is fitting for a special occasion or tasting as well as casual drinking."
"A good beer - as a fan of Ommegang, I really enjoy it."
"D: This is light enough to drink in the summer but enough alcohol warnth for the winter, perfect for the fall."
"The drinkability of this beer certainly doesn't belie it's ABV. I could easily have 3 or four glasses of this in a night and be very happy. This would be a beer that you could introduce people tto that are trying to get into beer but aren't ready for the more extreme tastes that are out there."
"It feels light in the mouth, though very present carbonation kind of bites, but adds to the crispness overall."
"Opened with a pop and whoosh that actaully scared my dog (she wouldn't come near me for 1/2 the tasting). Poured with a beautiful foamy white head into a goblet. Presented with a cloudy, pale straw color. Mild smell of yeast, corriander and clove. Nicely carbonated, yet very light and flavorful in the mouth. Again, the taste of corriander and citrus presented in the mouth, with a mild tart taste on the back of the tongue at the finish. Elegant white lacing clung to the glass every time I took a sip. Very nice saison. I had high expectations and was not disappointed in the least."
"Pours a cloudy/murky golden color with a fantastic white head. Aroma is somewhat citrusy but not real strong. Flavor is of light hops, citrus, and the alcohol comes through just a bit. The mouthfeel is good; this is not over- carbonated. The citrus in the taste is very refreshing. My first Saison. Yea for me."
"A bit disappointing because I was really expecting this one. Coincidentally, I even saw the Hennepin on a recent newspaper editorial of ""Best American Beers"". Poured out nice gold color. Smelled like a subtle version of the Brooklyn Local 1. Tasted of coriander and spices, but light and subtle without subduing the hops and malts. I'd say a slight step above the coveted Local 1, but I am just not a big fan of the flavor or category. I hate to ruin the rating, but I don't think every beer should have coriander! Overall: if you liked Local 1, you'll like this, but for me: it was disappointing."
"Drinkability - a great ale in the best of the Belgian farmhouse tradition. Where can i get more of these?"
"Pours out a hazy, golden color, lots of little carbonation bubbles form a large, bubbly white head. Fruity nose, hints of candy and spice, slighter hints of alcohol. Pretty spicy taste, lots of fruit tones, citrus flavors; loads of malt backed by spicy hops. Creamy, full mouth. A touch of alcoholic spicy way in the back. Pretty solid stuff."
"The beer pours a light hazy straw, forming a massive three figers of head, which fades down a 1/2 inch and stays. Medium rings of lace on the glass. The aroma is a largely spices and fruit, with a hint of alcohol. The taste is a smooth fruity flavor up front, and then ending with a slightly sharp spice finish. Doesnt seem to complex, but still full enough to deliver. Less than medium smooth mouthfeel. Low enough abv. and full flavor definitely makes for a few of these in one night. Overall, having never really had a saison ale, I was suprised at the taste and how well put together they are. Just another style for me to explore. Recommended!!"
"Pours a very pale color with a very nice, frothy, amount of foam. Heh. My snifter's broke so I had to use a pint glass. Shouldn't matter too much. Aroma is very nice and spicy upfront. I detect raisin, clove and mild apple flavors. A second sniff of the aroma brings up an apple pie flavor and leaves a decent amount of lacing. Taste is much of the same as the aroma except that the spice is more pronounced and the apple flavor seems to be dominant. Goes down very smooth. This is more of a sipping beer as well. Taste is somewhat sour towards the very back of the throat. Definitely a nice Saison!"
"Pouring this beer into a snifter produced a thick, tight head that complemented the hazy gold color of the Saison. Aroma was quite pleasant and familiar. The beer enveloped my mouth upon the first sip as bitter hop and spicy Belgian notes faded into a delicate fruit which lingered but a moment. Despite its 7% level only the slightest suggestion of alcohol mostly via warmth. This beer proved immensely drinkable."
"On tap at the Bavarian Lodge in Lisle... Served in a goblet, this beer was pretty to look at. A bright, cloudy golden hue, with some orange color. A little darker orange and it would actually look a lot like orange juice, Bright, white, fluffy head that lingered throughout leaving scalloped lacing all the way down... Smelled banana and clove, spicy phenols, maybe a hint of mint... Taste mirrors the smell on this one; banana, clove, slight phenolic/alcoholic heat... Mouthfeel was very nice; Clean not cloying, effervescent, sparkling... Overall a good representation of the style and a nice, drinkable brew."
"Drinkability is very good. This is a nice Saison, and I see why it gets high marks here."
"D: Very easy on the pallet and the ABV is not noticable to this quafer."
"Drinkability- Great! Maybe a little to good. This is one of those beers that you can keep drinking and drinking and before you know it BAM!...Drunk again. This is a fantastic brew and I cant wait to try more from Ommegang. Big thanks tpd975!"
"750 ml, corked and caged into a tulip glass. Pale honey and straw in color, with a persistent thin lacy head. A touch cloudy, to add that element of mystery. Smells of lemons, apricots, with a medicinal note in the background. Beautimous. The taste is sharp and crisp, almost bitter. There is a silky maltiness that holds it all together nicely. The finish is malty and dusty, but not too dry. The aftertaste is spiced fruit. I can only say :) The mouthfeel is slippery and tingly. Always a good combination. The drinkability? Pour me another! The alcohol is a plesant warmth as it trickles down the throat. Nothing off-puttish and the flavor balance makes you want more. And now I'll have more."
"D - This is a very balanced beer with several complex flavors competing and complementing each other at the same time. The higher ABV gives this a bit of alcohol punch that is deceptively lost in the flavor. Overall an excellent choice"
"D- The alcohol is completely hidden by this brew and I love to taste and smell it again and again. This is a great saison and a great Belgian brew all around. I love this beer and I can't wait to try more from Ommegang."
"This is a very nice beer. I don't think I can say enough nice about it. I could drink it all night."
"One of the great American Belgian-style ales. Surprisingly easy to drink and enjoy."
"I visited the brewery back in 2003 when in Cooperstown to see the baseball hall of fame. I've had their beers since then by mail order, but now Minnesota has Ommegang. They make good Belgian styled beers, and the price is usually better than the imports. Hennepin is a very good beer, quite complex but easy to drink."
"The taste is equally as good, with a smooth yeast / citrus character up front followed by bigger notes of hops, alcohol, spice, and more astringent citrus flavors. Mouthfeel detects a light, crisp body, fantastic carbonation, and (again) a great hoppy aftertaste. Despite the higher ABV here, this beer is exceptionally easy to drink."
"I'm not too much of a Belgiun style beer drinker but this isn't too bad. I like the citrus flavors but just a little to fizzy for my liking."
"Pours a nice slightly hazy golden yellow, with a frothy white long-lasting head. Lacing all over the glass. The aroma is grassy with a fruity/citrusy note. Peppery, spicy hop bitterness, but very pleasant. Not too sour. Finishes smooth and dry, but with a lingering spicy/peppery aftertaste. Overall, I find this to be a great summertime brew, especially on those hot afternoons."
"Overall, very easy to drink. A good session brew. Another nice feature is that this can go well with a variety of food. Quite flexible with food, so this makes a good beer to keep in the fridge at all times."
"This pours a dishwater grey/yellow, kind of cloudy, with a huge head of big time bubbles and plenty of lacing. The smell is very floral-biscuit but there is a sort of caustic overtone, something medicinal, of alcohol perhaps. The mouth finds a peppery introduction, very nicely carbonated and active, but the major flavor I detect is one of licorice. Bitter but very smooth and full bodied. Yeast presence is there but I can't get past this anisette quality that isn't really my favorite, and it aggressively overwhelms the taste buds right to the back of your throat. Quite dry but generally refreshing. I don't pick up hops or malt. It is something different and definitely a quality brew but this, like many other Belgian styles I've tried thus far, isn't right up my alley. Recommended for a try, this might be really special to the right palette."
"Pillowy, absolute white head filled with tiny bubbles that broke quickly but retained an excellent lacing throughout. Smell was a bit of citrus and malt with a little hoppiness , bread maybe- can't nail it. Hazy, urinesque color. Mouthfeel was smooth yet a kiss of fizz, spicey on the tongue, pepper, fruit. This is not one of my go to styles but I really did enjoy this beer and would gladly do a couple of bombers with friends during a cookout ."
"D: Tastes super fresh and with nearly no alcohol heat to detract from the subtle flavorings. Great for a hot day, or any day for that matter. The heavy carbonation makes this one especially good after mowing the lawn and is quite quaffable by yourself, I had the whole 750mL by myself and was as lucid as when I first popped the cork on this one."
"This is a beer worth the scores it receives. A great summer beer, now it's time to move outside and watch a fantastic thunderstorm move in and listen to Twins on the radio."
"D - Outstanding. The tart, dry spiciness keeps you sipping, Hell of a value, too, compared to the Euro saisons. An American brewery brewed this? I knew this going in, of course, but it still strains credulity. Great beer."
"--"
"This was a great beer. The smell was of apples and grapefruit. Heavy tanic taste which reminded me of camp fire smoke. This would be a great beer to have before dinner. It has a sharp smoke finish and is bitter at times but very drinkable and even refreshing."
"So, I might say that a full two years might be a bit much for Hennepin... not that I regret it, but it seems to be at its best at about a year old, imo. As it stands, its still a delicious beer that I thoroughly enjoy."
"750ml bottle poured into a large (24oz?) mug. I know, probably not the proper glass but it's what I like."
"d - easily drinkable and enjoyable. i've had this one for a while and enjoyed but i seem to like it fresher."
"great choice if you can afford it."
"Pretty damn drinkable and pleased that I finally ran across this offering. I will enjoy sharing it with others and will certainly tango with it again."
"Overall- Not as musty or funky as I was expecting. Light flavor with a big alcohol presence. The strong highly noticable alcohol knocks this 1 down a notch."
"The 12oz bottle poured into my pint glass a cloudy yellow orange colour with a snow white head probably three inches thick. Looks nice. Smell was good, but rather off for the style, I thought. Smell was more akin to a tripel than a farmhouse saison. The damp, musty, basement smell present in nearly every saison I have ever had is totally abscent in this one. Taste, too was far from a saison, IMO. Also, likely the worst thing about this is the detectable level of alcohol. To me, a farmhouse saison should be smooth and easy drinking, smell like a mouldy, damp basement, and have a rather pronounced tartness. This is bereft of any of the afore mentioned traits, and again, if I were just given this to drink, not knowing what it was, I'd probably enjoy it and exlaim, ""I've had better tripels, but this one's not bad.."" I don't know guys, for all the hype surrounding this one, I must admit, I'm quite dis-pleased with it. Perhaps I got a bad bottle."
"My first chance to grab a beer from this hyped brewery and it does not disappoint. Pours a perfect gold with a big puffy head, very carbonated beer. Aromas are passion fruit, pears and some berries, strawberry with a nice non-overpowering alcohol smell in there. Taste is great, the same fruits, some pineapple. Very smooth, somewhat dry and earthy, which must be the hops showing through. Saisons are a great beer, and to find a state-side brewery that does it this well is quite a treat. Go get some now!"
"Pours a hazy straw yellow with a nice big head into a snifter glass. A bit light on smell, but this isn't too unusual in the style in my experience. The taste is fantastic. Wonderful yeasty and herbal flavors. Slight sourness that defines the style. I love this for a summer drink. Quite drinkable despite the ABV."
"This wasn't too drinkable. It was just too husky and astringent, and not enjoyable enough. While the heat might fade in cellar, I'm not so sure about those grain tannins."
"*This is probably my new favorite beer, and one of the most complex yet enjoyable beers I have ever had."
"Two 12oz bottles with your BBQ makes for a relaxing time."
"Edit-At the end of the bottle i decided to pour the yeast in unlike what the bottle recommends. I have a smaller chalice so i get three glasses out of a 750 so the first two were sans yeast and the third included it. The yeast adds the funk i was looking for. The bottle says dont pour it in, which i think works for half the beer"
"Hennepin is a beer that is constantly stocked in my fridge. One of my favorite summer sippers and at an affordable price. Not as funky as a couple of my favorites but as thirst quenching and enjoyable as a saison can get."
"...Music- ""Lady Dana"" 'Climax' -the CD ..."
"Not the best Ommegang offer, but still quite nice."
"750ml bottle served at a refreshingly cool temperature. This was the third beer for my birthday, after Delirium Tremens and Odell's Double Pilsner. It proved to be an excellent relief. At 7.7% ABV it was the lowest of the evening. I loved everything about this beer. The appearance was a nice cloudy golden hue. The nose was aromatic and the taste was phenomenal. I absolutely craved the sourness of this amazing saiaon. It was sad to pour out the last of it, but it was time to attempt a double IPA."
"Pours a dark gold, medium sized uneven white head. A lot of bubbles, a lot of carbonation. Has a citrusy smeel, very fresh smellin.g Very rich and foamy mouthfeel, full smooth taste. vey slight bitter aftertaste, pretty sweet taste. nice lacing on the glass."
"Notes: Solid all around Saison. Recommended and I like to use it for cooking as well, but it's not a beer I always have on hand."
"Overall: not all that complex of a beer, but absolutely delicious and well made. I think of this beer as a standard for the style, what most saisons aspire to be."
"Overall: A great domestic version of a Saison. Summer is the season to enjoy a saison and this one is thirst quenching. I just finished cooking burgers on the grill and popped this one open. Like peanut butter goes with jelly, Hennepin goes with charred flesh (burgers), summer, and good times."
"Overall a very good Saison, probably the best American version that I have tasted. Prickly mouthfeel that scrubs the tongue. Very digestable. Paired with Cypress Grove's Herbed Chevre ."
"This beer poured a HUGE head even when I had the glass tilted. It took some time for the head to die down but the head actually gave off some nice aromatics. Slight fruity aroma, green apples, flowery almost spring-like aromas, if that makes sense. The mouth feel was huge because of the high carbonation. The taste was extremely light with the co2 rolling around in the mouth. Slightly spicy flavors, but very subtle. Finishes very crisp and clean. This is a very drinkable beer, especially in the summer heat. But I think the price tag is a bit much."
"great beer. no session for me. could get me messed up quick. follows style. hope to drink this again."
"Pours a foggy gold color with a one finger white head that dies down pretty quick after pour. Fair amount of lacing in this one throughout. Great smell of spices and mild citrus fruit with a hint of yeasty goodness. Taste starts off with a bubbley lemon and honey like sweetness. Continues with a good amount of spices that tickle the tongue. Ends with a mild bready malt flavor. Very complex flavored brew. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a whole bunch of carbonation. Great offering from Ommegang, I need to make a trip down there soon."
"M/D: Crisp feel, a lot of carbonation. Light-medium bodied, not spectatular drinkability. Maybe too carbonated, could be more drinkable."
"I first read about this beer in ""The Brewmaster Table"" by Garrett Oliver and was motivated to go down to my local ""City Beer"" to pick it up. Luckily I have a place to pick up great beer, you can't go wrong with this selection."
"Mouthfeel is perfectly smooth, with just the right amount of carbonation. I would drink this one all night if I could, but it does get a touch filling. Overall this is a beer that can be measured up to any of the abbey ales I've tried. And it's from upstate NY. Go figure."
"Poured into a goblet, it's blonde in color with a nice little head. This is a totally new style to me, so I didn't know what to expect. It was mildly fruity with grape and pear and a pinch of candy-like sweetness. The flavors aren't overbearing, and finishes pretty dry, making this a brew I could sip on all night."
"Pours a moderately hazy straw-gold with a big, fluffy white head that eventually diminishes to a crown and an island. Smells of citrus, spices and fleshy tart fruit. Taste is similar -- a refreshing, complex panoply of apples, pears, orange, lemon and peppery spices (did I detect some licorice/star anise?) with just the slightest hoppiness in the finish. Light-bodied with a crisp bite. Excellent drinkability for the alcohol content -- extremely enjoyable on a hot day. Highly recommended."
"If you'd like a terrific, engaging beer for the summer - one with a little more complexity than a hefeweizen - give this one a try."
"D - Quite easy to down. Even more so for others I'd imagine."
"D: Medium-Low. A very enjoyable, flavorful light beer. But the sweetness makes me only want one bottle."
"There was a hoppy flavor, that was no over powering as some beers can be. It had just enough hops to give that rich flavor, and the right mix to make this beer a very drinkable and enjoyable experience."
"D: A very crisp, refreshing, unique and interesting beer. It goes down very easy. A nice brew to have on a summer evening. It's light and refreshing yet complex and interesting."
"I have been curious about Saisons and I heard this one was the best so what the hell? I poured this one into a Chimay chalice and watched the bubbles rise furiously from the etching in the bottom of the glass. teh head was aggressive and foamy white. The beer was a cloudy, yet somehow bright yellow color. The smell was yeasty. The taste was crispy, a little phenolic (but not much), maybe a hint of pepper hiding in there. The alcohol was completely masked which was nice. This beer would be perfect for a hot day."
"I would describe this brew as sharp - it cuts right through on every level. The ABV is almost completely unnoticeable, which lends itself to easily be a session brew. Of the saisons I have sampled, this one is easily in the top 5. If you haven't had an Ommegang, I suggest that you get your hands on any one you can. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
"There's no hint of alcohol, even though it's much stranger than American macro brews. Great taste and easy drinking make this a superb session beer. Highly reccommended. I'm having another."
"Light slightly hazy orange color, good white head, great lacing. Smells are refreshing with a bit of citrus. Taste is great, refreshing like a wheat beer but a bit more complex. Some sweet maltiness with some spice and bits of citrus. Good carbonation and mouthfeel. Very good beer overall."
"Poured on tap, this beer was pale with very white creamy head with lacing that lasted through the entire glass. Very sweet smell with champagne-like odors. Taste was watery and sweet with white grape tastes and an odd perfume taste at the finish. Mouthfeel was light and dry and little aftertaste. I will say that it is very well balanced with the higher ABV. Drinkability was ok for a hot day beer, but not at the top of my list."
"Im glad I savored this beer today.Very good work Ommegang.I have never found them to have a bad beer."
"12oz bottle. Pours a lovely cloudy medium gold with a spicy nose. The taste is correspondingly spicy, and very crisp on the tongue. The flavour is quite nice and has some hints of a wheat beer. I think its own description is selling itself short by claiming it to be a ""light on the tongue"" finish, as I feel it's rather a full flavour. I like this one."
"D - Very drinkable! Deliciously complex but not overwhelming. The more sips, the more flavor."
"Pours a gorgeous straw hay color, very cloudy. A mouthwatering head of even sized bubbles slowly fades. Aromas are characteristic of style with lots of estery fruits, particularly apricots, apples with a spicy backnote: cardamom and black pepper predominating. Flavor wise it is incredibly flavorful with all the Belgianness you could want: tons of funky overripe fruits, a bit of grass and hay, with a tight dry finish. This sample is a bit cleaner than Belgian saisons, especially Dupont and Fantome, a trait I find in many American Belgians. The bubbles from this one are quite a treat, they are pillowy soft, not biting. Glad to see this one made it to KS, and I look forward to having the rest of the line I've not tried."
"D - Overall this is a very good beer, with excellent drinkability. Very comparable with Duvel. Depending on the price I may or may not have this one again as I'm not crazy about the style...it is good though."
"Served in a Koningshoeven chalice. Pours a golden straw in color, with a slight amount of chill-haze. Solid, densely-packed white head of good duration and with fine lacing, a full finger easily. The nose here is worth the price of admission, with the rare spiciness of the yeast verily prickling at the nasal passages, inviting wet horseblankets and dull fruity malt components up for drinks in the wee hours. Better than I remember in this regard. Equal parts tangy and sweet on the first sip, coating the tongue and promoting a sense of degustation; where's that sampler platter at? Pale malts sing the high notes in the background as the middle is cajoled through the wheaty-meaty bits, and the zest of the yeast parying a bit in the foreground, but not quite asI remembered from my last go-round some years back. Dry around the finish and with enough hop aromatics to make you notice them, but even for the stylistic interpretation that is Hennepin this is a rather tame component. Not a small beer by any means, it drinks so easily you'll forget where you left your car keys if you're not lucky. Some lemon rind peaking through here and there, but nothing to be overly offended by, and in the end this feels a bit tame overall. Still, this is the first time I've had it on draught, and seeing as how it's back it won't be the last. I look forward to another go . . ."
"Hennepin is a delicious, world-class Saison, that simply must not be missed. Definitely recommended."
"I can only hope my homebrewed saison comes close to this beer's awesomeness. I've been impressed with Three Philosophers, but now I'm nearly blown away by Hennepin. I think a pilgrimage to Ommegang and the baseball Hall of Fame in my near future."
"Best of all, many major grocery stores are starting to stock Hennepin, along with other Ommegang beers. Highly recommended."
"I could put a 4 pack of this away on a Spring or Summer day. A very tasty beer. I would like to taste this one super fresh."
"Pairs well with just about anything (here's to saisons!), but holds itself very well on it's own. You really don't feel like you're consuming just another beer with this guy. Tremendous job, and highly recommended due to the finesse achieved."
"Drinkability: definitely drinkable. I want another, but next time I'm going for the bottle. Another magnificent brew from Cooperstown."
"Overall: Damn this is a great beer. Ommegang really came thru for me on this one, my only thing that I don't love is that the candi sugar is a bit upfront. About 6 mos of aging and that sugar would likely mellow out and be a near perfect beer. I'd like to witness this brew's steps in the brewery. An absolute pleasure to drink that I will come back to again and again."
"Strangely, the after taste came to me 5 minutes after I left the bar with the previously mentioned banana esters and the bitterness of the hops. I thought maybe the keg was on the way out, so I'll hold back on any further thoughts."
"Overall: I'm honestly in shock that something this good is made here in the good ol' USA. No offense to American brewers, but beer this good is usually exclusive to Belgium. Arguably the best beer made in this entore country. If you have not tried this yet, do so immediately."
"drinkability is great. alcohol is hidden well. tasty and very refreshing. great stuff."
"D: Pretty good. Too hoppy and too mild in all the other flavors, to me, for the style. I'll take a Saison Dupont or De Glazen Toren Saison any day of the week."
"This beer was a great find. After attending the Strong Ale fest in San Francisco this year, I really have taken to Strong Ales. I would recommend if you are looking to broaden your beer drinking scope. If you are not comfortable with drinking beer out of a something other than a pint glass, avoid this one."
"Drinking Hennepin made me want to have a beer tasting party. Maybe some Asian-fusion-barbeque. Yeah. And it was only $4.95 at Sparrow's, FYI. Great deal. I'll be back next weekend for another couple bottles."
"Very, very drinkable, I'm glad I got 3 and tomorrow I'll probably go back for 3 more!"
"I must get more of this beer."
"Hennepin is a fine American example of a Belgian-style Saison. A rather complex and excellent sipping beer. An real steal at $6 for a 750ml bottle."
"Pours out a shimmering and slightly hazed gold with lots of bubbles in the body and a thick, frothy, fluffy head that maintains its size and clings to the side of the glass, leaving elaborate lacing patterns. Aroma starts off with a sweet mix of vanilla, jasmine, apricots and sweet oranges, with underlying bready and grainy smells. Alcohol is in there but doesn't detract too much. Flavor starts with a bit of grain, but underneath it is a malty, bready, and slightly nutty body. Belgian yeast characteristics are there with the fruity esters with a definite apricot presence. Hops add a great floral touch that really expands in the aftertaste. Finishes dry and rather clean. Only thing really detracting here is a warm alcohol presence which I'd rather not be experiencing. Mouthfeel is incredible. Isn't at all weighty from the alcohol level. Bubbly in the mouth, but not overly prickly: just enough to bring out the subtle flavors. Pretty drinkable, but I just wish the alcohol presence were a bit more subdued."
"It's great taste, good quality, extremely drinkable."
"Amazing overall. Best saison I have had."
"D: A 750 is never enough which can be trouble given the ABV. One of my all time favorites."
"This is one of those mild brews that sneaks around and smacks you upside the head with a surprising complexity. The key is serving at the right temp. Too cold and you miss it. I'm glad I decided to take a trip down beer memory lane with this one!"
"Light and bubbly feel, but with a major kick on the back end. There is even that hard liquor ""burn"" at the end. This is delicious, but let's face it, it's a one-off because of its strength."
"Poured a pale orange with a slowly diminishing head that left decent lacing on the glass. The aroma was malty with a light fruitiness that was accompanied by a good spiciness. The great spiciness overpowered the taste. There was a good balance of hops and malt that provided a good background to the spices. The beer sits lightly and very crisp on the tongue. The alcohol was also well hidden. This is a very enjoyable beer."
"The beer poured a straw-yellow color, with a thick, white head. It smelled yeasty, fruity and spicy. It has a slight sour, citrus taste, with a dry, yeast finish. It was well carbonated, but not overly fizzy. I would say this is a very good Saiason from and American (but Belgium owned) brewery."
"From a 750 corked and caged. I poured gently as not to disrupt the yeast at the bottom. It is a lovely bronze color with a thick white head with the prevelent carbonation of any good belgian style ale. Smells interestingly sweet and sour and the same time. I got hints of candy as well as a slight musk. Upon first tasting it was apparent that this was a belgian at heart. Sweet candy malts on the front, but a bit of hops came through later. The biggest taste left with me after each sip was of a sourish funk, and I mean that in a good way. Very unique, as this was my first foray into the saison category. Wonderful mouthfeel and highly drinkable. I actually paired it with a southern style potato salad on zesty vegetable crackers and that really brought out the flavor. Highly enjoyable!"
"D-The beer is good, but not as complex as I was expecting, and far more drinkable-dangerously so for a 7.7."
"Poured out of a 750ml corked and cage bottle. The color is like a hazy miller lite, though the second half of the bottle was more orange in color. The white head is nice soapy and rocky, that left some real nice lacing on the side of the glass. The smell is not very strong, it kind of reminds me of a pilsner, with the noble hops. The taste is of Belgian yeast, tart apple, some sweetness and finishes with a slight bitterness to balance the flavors. This ale drinks very much like a lager, it has nice carbonation and finishes crisp. A very drinkable brew, it has a nice balance of flavors but nothing outstanding to make it distinct."
"Drinkability: A very cool beverage regardless of style, refreshing like a lager but as complex as any. Very easy to drink and a cool complex saison."
"D- sessionable and delightful, highly refreshing and drinkable. alcohol not noticeable. loving this brew and this style"
"Impressive to say the least. Despite the 7.7% abv, this is a light drinking saison. It would be easy to quaff a few of these on a warm summer afternoon."
"This is one of those beers that turned me on to the style. I feel that Ommegang produces a wonderful saison. The appearance was a light straw color with a good head. The foam remained for a long time. The smell was unique and unclassifiable. Someone told me it had a hint of horse-blanket, and I would have to say I agree. Besides this aspect, the taste and mouth feel were wonderful."
"Cheers!"
"Poured from the big bottle, came out a nice golden haze, with thick head and lacing throughout. Smell was good, not great, had nice spice and citrus smells, good grain odors as well. Taste the same, with some mild hoppiness, good crisp finish. Mouthfeel was lively, with decent carbonation and the lacing reaching the mouth. Very good beer!"
"Poured from a bomber into my over sized wine glass. Radiant yellow with a big fluffy white head. Decent lacing. A bit cloudy with some fat carbonation trails. Smell is spicy malt and with a hint of hops. Taste is fruit and spice with enough malt and hops to make it a well rounded taste. Nice full mouth feel. The 7.7% alcohol is hidden nicely. I could drink a few bombers in a setting no doubt. Another Ommegang work of art."
"Like most Saisons I've had the pleasure of trying, the drinkability of this beer is quite high. Alcohol is a non issue and taste is not extreme enough in either direction (bitter vs sweet) to limit drinkability. After embracing Dupont, I looked upon this beer with some disdain. That was a dis-service. This is a fine beer, nicely priced, and easier to obtain than most Saisons."
"Fairly drinkable, saisons aren't really my thing but this one is pretty good across the board. As good as many I've seen in Belgium"
"I have since bought several bottles to keep on hand, and I would definitely recommend this beer to all."
"Drinkability is decent."
"Clear, light golden color with a firm white foamy head. The most impressive thing to me was the carbonation in the goblet I poured it into. The beads of carbo were very fast rising and spiraled to the top sustaining the head on top. This lasted the entire drink of 25 min. or so. Fresh green apple smell and a different sweet fruity smell also. Inviting smell that leads into similar tastes. Didn't know what to expect with taste because this was my first saison, but was impressed. Champagne-like dryness and fizziness. Sourness of like, a white grape thats not quite ripe. Fizzy mouthfeel but not overdone. Very drinkable and will have to try this again and some other saisons."
"I am re-reviewing this beer from my trip to the Ommegang brewery. When I first tried this beer before I didn't really like it, but the recent trip to the brewery changed my mind quite a bit. The beer is supposed to taste rustic and earthy, and in furthering my beer appreciation I think I respect this beer a lot more now. At a small bar in town I drank it all friday night (and it sure does sneek up on you...) I couldn't get enough of it. It changes so much with temperature being more grainy and earthy at colder temps, then warming up to a huge array of citrus, spices, and hops. This beer is awesome and next to the Ommegang it is now my 2nd favorite."
"enjoy!"
"D: So refreshing, so complex, a beer for almost any occassion."
"I could very easily entertain a session of Hennepin but without the price I found at a local pub. I would drink it again gladly... unfortunately, for the moment there are other ales that have caught my attention over this one."
"This poured a nice yellow/gold color w/ a nice fluffy white head that resembled a foam pillow more than bubbles. The smell hit me from almost a foot away. I actually had to get closer to be sure I was actually smelling the beer. It has a nice citrus smell. The taste was nice, citrus with just enough bite, some wheaty bread taste as well. A very nice beer to enjoy. I watched it during a movie and it held my attention more than the movie did I believe."
"Poured from a 750ml corked and caged bottle - no visible dating system. Picked this up in Indy during Xmas with the folks and just found out going to be avail again in Texas!!! I poured it into my Delirium Tremens tulip glass and it was a golden yellow color. It had a tremendous head with bunch of initial carb that settled into a thin foam with great lacing. The aroma was spicy and fruity but just a little too subtle to be a 5 but it's close. The mouthfeel was perfect was for me - it had a great creamy feel with a tongue tickling from the carbonation. The taste was also perfect. It's sweeter and less dry than some other saisons I've had which is perfect for me since I favor sweet over dry. Overall, this is a top 5 beer for me and I can't wait till available in Texas again. Highly, highly recommend. (5, HR, T, Y, HOF)"
"Now stocked regularly at Stop n Shop, alongside other Duvel products. Excellent. :)"
"Pours a cloudy golden with a big white head that retains pretty well and leaves quite good lacing. Smells of typical Belgian yeasty flavors with some clove and light apple in the mix. There is also quite a pungent sharp smell there as well that cuts through everything. Tastes a little sharp as well, but not necessarily in abad well- kinds a more stinky cheese flavor. Complex, with ripe, musty flavors and some subdued stone fruit. Fades to a more typical saison light yeastiness on the end. Decent body, good balance between creaminess and crispness, but finishes a little limp. Pretty drinkable, a a good value, but there are others similar to this beer I'd reach for first."
"All-in-all, a good saison choice."
"D: The lightness and dryness of this beer makes it quite drinkable. A great beer to break someone out of the macro beer pattern."
"Overall: Very different from my previous experience with Rogue Festivale Saison; somewhat different from the also excellent Saison Dupont, I find this style enigmatic to say the least. Must try more! Very good overall, cheerfully recommended."
"Bottled sample via trevorwideman. Gold in colour with lots of floaties (that's ok... yeast is good for you) and strong carbonation. Aromas of over ripe banana, vanilla, meadow flowers, white grape, and spicy pear. Flavors of lemon rind, soft fruit, spicy Duvel yeast, some wheat malt, and a slight metallic at the end. Smooth in the mouth with some nice lively carbonation creating some interest on the dry finish. Overall, this is a mellow and technically sound saison, but for me it lacks that certain something that makes a beer really special (like the signature funkiness of Fantome or the austere refinement of Dupont). Perhaps this sounds like damning with faint praise, but it's still a VERY good beer."
"A shade darker than golden and the beginning of a nice head but fizzles to a fine bubbled pool but some sticky lace remnants of its former height. Grassy, tart sour fruits, wheat, soft flowery esters all in the nose. Some unexpected light hops are noticed and are followed by fermented lemons pith and apple, grass, wheat, yeasty, husk. Later in the glass fruit characters gain in strength with some honey sweetness and notes of vanilla and banana. Mild carbonation and a light, airy mouthfeel. The finish echoes much of the flavor but is still relatively clean."
"I had 3 Monts a week ago, and found it to be similar to this in many ways, but much better. Drink that instead."
"The beer pours a light straw yellow with a thick, fluffy, white head. The smell is of fruit and yeast. Upon drinking, I first noticed a complex medley of flavors, hard to pin any one flavor down. There were over-riding fruit flavors with a bit of an alcohol tingle on the front of the tongue. After swallowing, a mild apple juice flavor lingers for a short time. Has a sharp bite when it first hits the tongue but mellows out."
"The mouthfeel, however, is fantastic. This is an exceptionally smooth and creamy feeling beer, and it really improves the drinkability considerably. In the end, I'd call this a drinkable, if not great beer. Might be worth buying again just to make sure my bottle isn't off."
"I enjoy this beer very much. A very respectable Saison offering that hides it's 7.7 ABV quite well. Excellent."
"Pours a beautiful clear amber with a fantastic head that lingers and takes on a meringue-like look. Fruity esters for the nose and a very complex and enjoyable taste that assails the senses. Just a fantastic brew, so glad I have 11 more bottles to enjoy."
"Overall, very easy to drink. One of my favorite saisons."
"Much like Duvel or Saison Dupont, this poured to a very carbonated, hazy yellow with orange tint, and a thick white pillowy head that eventually reduced to excellent lacing. Aroma was a very hoppy floral, with hints of citrus and some spices. Taste was along the lines of the Duvel as well, but not as well-defined. Nice smooth finish. I really enjoyed this beer and Saison style."
"An interesting, very unrefined beer that is nonetheless nicely balanced. The texture of carbonation was a weak point in my eyes. A fun drink, though not a session-er for me."
"Drinkability- Fairly easy to drink, but I'm not a huge fan of the beer overall... I mean, it's good, but not as good as others that I've had IMO."
"Flavour is sublime, with a Granny Smith apple sourness hitting the tongue first, them moving on to all kinds of mellow bready/yeasty flavour. Pears, white grapes, all come before the funky finish that stays for a long time. Sticky and dry in the mouth but not overcarbonated, just a little bite. This goes down super-easily, but still invites you to hold it in your mouth for a long time. Very impressive Saison, and all the more impressive for being a North American beer."
"This body is rather light and aggressively carbonated, more so than the U.S. brewed version. A very pleasant and highly drinkable saison."
"Kick ass beer!!"
"D: Very drinkable. I could have drank the whole bottle if I hadnt shared with my friends."
"750 ml. Poured with a nice head, but not too big, as many Saisons are. Fell kind of quickly as well. Golden color with poor clarity and lots of suspended yeast. Not very floculent. Light aroma with hints of lemon and cherry with a persimmon note. Palate was uncomplicated with a light but distinct sour ale taste and quick finish. Plenty of carbonation left on palate for an active mouthfeel. I didnt get the alcohol notes until about 1/2 way through the glass, then my palate opened to it and I could taste it then. My favorite Ommegang product so far."
"Pours a cloudy golden yellow color with a big rocky head. Spicy aroma with a subtle fruitiness. Slightly sweet with a spicy note, perhaps clove (?). Medium bodied with a fairly dry finish, The bottle I had said it was brewed in Belgium. Quite nice, thanks to my friend Barbara for this one!"
"Smells sweet for the most part. Murky yellow body with initially large white head. I realize I am serving it initially cooler than suggested (the label suggests 50 degrees) but maybe itll warm up, its a warm summer night after all... anyway... hm not bad. Mostly sweet (banana?) with a little hops and pepper. Good solid beer. Im impressed"
"At first glance, Hennepin looks innocent enough with its hazy, yellow color and fluffy white head. But it smells like no other beer you've had, featuring tangy orange and earthy hops. Upon tasting, there's an odd complexity of citrus and herbs. Peppered lemon flavor with a hint of vanilla gives way to a tart bite of green apples, grapes and finally a grapefruit-like bitterness. It's truly an adventure in beer."
"Overall one of my favorites. So good, you could drink this one all night but at 7.7% abv you might regret it. Or, maybe you won't."
"Very tasty stuff. Picked this up after a long day at work. Poured a thick white head and smelled awesome. It has good carbonation to it and nice hop and malt flavors. Also some mild fruity flavors. This beer was very refreshing, full bodied, and very drinkable. Highly Recommend it."
"Drinkability- Man, I would be trashed if if someone offered me one of these after exercising. It really hits the spot and if I were parched I do believe I would drain one of these before you could say Ommegang."
"The yummy ale is very drinkable and a rather good example of a saison. However, whether compared to its brethen across the pond, I feel this one is a bit simple. It pours a lovely golden hue with fits of carbonation busting out to yield a great rocky eternal noodle. The aroma is of noble hops and lemon mostly. The flavor has a nice malt character that well supports the hop and citrus flavors. The body is medium/light and mouthfeel is round and pleasant. The alcohol is mildly perceived which aids in the drinkability. I didn't get much of the complex flavors and aromas that come with some of the Belgian saisons. This one is very enjoyable though."
"D - Bring home a bottle and share with friends. A crowd pleaser for the sophisticated beer drinker."
"I wouldn't mind trying this one again. Still don't know how long that bottle had been there, so might have to keep an eye out for some fresh stuff."
"Highly recommended."
"750ml corked and caged bottle poured into a large Duvel tulip glass. Pours a golden yellow color with large fluffy white head. Nose is of sweet malt that is earthy, floral and some crisp citrus. Taste is fruity and earthy that finishes bone dry. I love saisons and this is no exception. Another solid brew from Ommegang. Definately recommended."
"it smelled of hops as well as fruits and flowers. The flavor was hoppy and pleasantly tart. There were hints of fruit and flowers generaly adding to the complexity of the flavor. I found the carbonation fun and enjoyable. Overall I enjoyed this beer and would ahve it agian."
"This is a tasty and refereshing beer with lots going on in it. Would make a decent session brew, and a good introduction to the realm of belgian styled ales. Challenges the palate, not due to the sheer size of its flavours, but moreso the depth, complexity and interplay between them. Ill be drinking this again."
"Cloudy golden color with white head, leaving a good lacing. Smell is yeasty, with different spices, some lemon and clove, has a flowery smell too. Clove and bread beginning, with some sourness and spices coming through. Average carbonation paired with a light and dry body. Pretty good, would try it again."
"This is the perfect special occasion beer...I plan on keeping some handy just in case."
"A solid choice for a saison. It's not my favorite of the style (it's just behind DuPont and Smuttynose Farmhouse), but it's certainly a goody I do recommend."
"Substitute this for a white wine at dinner. A great American take on the style, and a great price for what you get. (Although I think I might prefer my local Bam Biere from Jolly Pumpkin)"
"I know this is an oft-recommended beer for food pairings, and a popular beer in general. And, I agree that it's not bad. But I don't see anything spectacular about it, and I wonder if the only reason why it's such a good pairing is that its flavours are restrained and inoffensive. It's a good bottle to have around when friends come over and want something different but not too out there, though."
"Outside of it's normal brew appearence, you know, light blond w/ a rocky huge white head this beer rocks. IMO, it looked like a Bud Light but the flavor and aroma had me wanting more and more. To begin, I first got a nice heavy blast of grainy malt w/ a hint of honey, coriander and clove. The brew had a pleasant light body, watery, and fizzy(small bubbles) enough to make it feel like champaign. I could also taste all it components such as the coriander, malt, hint of yeast and etc. This brew is really good and will buy several bottles next time, so that my wife and I could enjoy thoughout the night."
"I think this is a marvelous beer. Ommegang is without question my favorite local (loose definition of ""local"" here) brewer. I wouldn't drink a six-pack of Hennepin, but it's a great, crisp, rustic, flavorful beer. A good example of the style, and a good beer by itself."
"At nearly 8 percent, this is a dangerously drinkably beer. Another winnner from the fine people in Cooperstown."
"Shared a big bottle at Zeno's. Pours light golden with a huge white head that leaves some nice lacing and persists the whole way down the glass. Visible carbonation. Nose is sweet and with a citrusy tartness. A bit of an earthy smell as well. Taste sweet at first, lots of fruit flavors are perceptable- perhaps a bit of apple and grape, finish is tart with spicy citrusy hops and a touch of warming alcohol. Very good and distinct. Very well carbonated. Excellent overall. Refreshing yet powerful and full bodied. I think this would be equally good on a warm summer or cold winter evening. A beer for all seasons."
"Pours a hazy straw color with a large frothy white head. The head is three finger widths and leaves some nice lacing. The smell is malty with many spices notes thrown in. Some yeast notes and citrus notes in the smell. The taste is very powerful with strong maltyness followed by citrus and yeast notes with hint of coriaander and lemon. The beer is heavier in the mouth with a large carbination. This is a good american version of a saison, a good drinkable beer."
"Overall, this is one brew that I imagine would be a perfect summer daytime sipper. It's as crisp as anything out there, has a very refreshing taste and lively carbonation character that wakes your mouth up. An excellent saison that I will definitely be coming back to in the future."
"D: Good, a very nice beer to enjoy on a warm day."
"Poured a very big and fairly dense head. The lacing sticks right away leaving layered lines behind. Color is clear and crisp golden. Smell is banana, wheat, orange with a hint of clove. A very flowery taste is present. It also has a saltiness to it. It has flavors of banana and orange. Mouthfeel is ok and softly carbonated. This wasn't a great bottle so I'll try another bottle later."
"Drinkability: Paired with a meal of chicken, sauteed mushrooms, homemade creamed spinach, and gnocchi in a gorgonzola cream sauce, this was delightful. More please."
"Drinkability: Great--what a treat to have had this on the same night as the Fantome Strange Ghost. At the price, this might be one of the best belgians--in fact, just one of the best beers period--available. Fruity, refreshing, fantastic."
"Hennepin pours a cloudy golden brown, with a silky white head. The nose offers a lot, most prominently orange peel and spice, with a littelf floral note. It drinks smooth with good efferesence. It has nice spice in the mouth, and is fairly well balanced. In my opinion, it's about as good a Belgian clone as is made in the states, but doesn't stand up to the complexities of the style from the traditional standpoint."
"I just can't figure this beer out - I think its a great beer, but I have a hard time articulating why I think that... This is the SECOND time that I have had this on-tap at home... The first time, I had a half-barrel - when I picked up that keg, it was already a number of months old... I don't recall the exact age, but I recall emailing the folks at Ommegang and they told me that this beer would age well... Anyway, the sedond time, I had this i in a log and it was more current... I think I preferred the first, older, version... This is just an unusual style... Sweet, carbonated and notes of honey. I dinged it a little bit for mouthfeel - I think you can sense the carbonation and relatively high alcohol... Even so, I just like it... A great beer, even if I can't say why I think so..."
"Pours a cloudy golden color with a creamy white head that fades quickly to a 1/8"" cap, leaving generous rings around the snifter all the way down. Aroma is fruity, with hints of raison, apple, and pear. A slight hop presence is there also, along with a hint of yeast. Taste is tart and fruity up front, with some hop bitterness on the palate right before washing away for a clean finish. This beer is slippery on the palate, going down with relative ease. This is a great beer! A very nice warm weather substitute to it's Abbey Ale companion."
"I like this Americanized version of a farmhouse. Pretty good stuff."
"Can't say I was overly impressed with this beer. I wouldn't get it again."
"A note: the brewer at the State College BrewExpo said they recently stopped keg conditioning, so perhaps this could explain a bit...?"
"A very fine and drinkable beer. Have one as often as possible."
"The beer is quite drinkable. Its crisp, tart and dry finish makes it a good one to have on hand like anyone else would have wine, but much less potent at 7.5% ABV. Highly recommended, though I cant say whether this Aged version is worth the extra $1. The Hennepin itself is delicious, no amount of agign would change that in any subpar brew."
"D - light bodied, yet somewhat filling beer due to the carbonation. Alcohol content also makes this slightly prohibitive as a regular drinker. But very, very tasty interpretation of the farmhouse style. Another fine offering from Brewery Ommegang."
"Pours a two finger white head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Pale, cloudy amber color. Strong carbonation and medium bodied. Spicey/citrus nose. Starts almost sweet reminds me of a wheat, tart finish. $5.35 for a 750ml bottle from Butter's Fine Food & Wine Concord, NH."
"Very peppery, with coarse carbonation, and an overabundance of carbonation. My second saison this weekend, and while I enjoy this more than the Fantome, this ain't my cup of tea. Bitter, unappealing, and even though cheap, not worth it."
"M&D: Medium body and clean mouthfeel. Very drinkable."
"D-This beer might sound awful the way I described it in my review but it was very taste with a very mysterious flavor that was hard to put into words. This beer is proof that you can make a fizzy yellow beer that taste great."
"Highly recommend. All-around delight."
"On the palate this beer is very light. It goes down easy and warms just a bit as it goes down. carbonation does not get in the way of the delicate taste of this beer.The beer is clean tasting and crisp, it finishes fairly dry. This is a beer I will definitely be buying again."
"Okay I admit I'm an American and English beer kind of guy in general and not at all into Belgians (gasp!), but I remembered liking this one in the past. Pours a bright, glowing golden hue, but is slightly cloudy or hazed below the one finger foamy head. Smells Belgian (uh oh, I think), yeasty, sweetish, and only gently hoppy--not too much smelling going on here as it makes me nervous and the aroma of Belgian beers make me think of dusty cellars by association... Okay here I go...tastes fruity and complex--fruity in a white wine kind of way. Nectar like. Has waves and layers of flavor. Definite alcohol presence. Starts with the fruit-like malts, flashes alcohol, adds a flair of spice, and finishes with a juicy, fruit-zest hops lingering on the tongue for a moment or two. I'm not in love with the taste, but it's intriguing. Mouthfeel is full but on the tongue sits slightly watery--more so than expected, I expected more syrup, but it is pleasing. Not sure how I feel about the carbonation level..a bit high. Drinkability wise, this is nothing I'll swoon over and plan my day around, but it's a good beer that seems it could go well with the summer bread, cheese, fruit, and spiced meats kind of picnic."
"I could drink this all day."
"Light, crisp, and refreshing. Goes down very smooth. If I didn't know better, I'd believe this was a true Belgian Saison. Excellent beer, would recommend to anyone."
"Pours a hazy medium yellow/gold with a nice head that evaporates at quick rate. Smell is of bananas, citrus, fruity, cantaloupe, yeast, spices, etc...One of the best noses I have ever experienced in a beer. Exceptional. As for the taste, it's right up there as well. Much like the nose, it tastes of bananas, yeast, honey dew melon, some spiciness that would be expected from this genre of beers, just party in my mouth. Mouthfeel is decent, creamy yet maybe a little too carbonated. For a 7.7% brew, this is EXTREMELY drinkable - even TOO drinkable. Hennepin is so tasty and refreshing, and hides the alcohol level extremely well so be responsible downing these gems."
"I popped the cork on this 750 ml bottle only to have it hit the ceiling, wall and then my chest with surprising force. No foam out of the bottle, but it does pour a surprisingly large head. Color is just slightly cloudy gold. Smell is slightly grainy and sweet, a bit reminiscent of tomato vines and just a little yeasty. Taste is a delicious sweet pungent flavor, a little bready and yeasty. the 7.5% is extremely well hidden. It is extremely smooth and refreshing, I could drink this after a run and feel satisfied. I had this beer for the first time last year around this time. It was my introduction to the style, as well as the first Belgian style beer that I truely loved, enough to go out and buy another bottle of it almost right away. All around a great way to break into the style, I feel that I now appreciate and enjoy a lot more Belgians."
"Poured a cloudy yellow orange with a real small white head, although it left nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of creamsicles, bananas, slight daiquiri. Taste of citrus and melong, with also a rustic earthiness to it. Nicely creamy mouthfeel. It had a smooth start and a spicy alcoholic finish."
"Verdict: I take back my comments that this isn't a top 100 beer. This beer deserves all the praises it should get."
"I've had this bottled and thought it was far superior. Could have been dirty lines?"
"Tips - You can get a ""universal glass"" from ommegang's website, they used to have a hennepin glass but it is discontinued. The best saison i have ever tried, hands down."
"D - Yessir may I have another? So so delicious and easy to drink. Polished off a bottle with a buddy halfway through ""Rescue Me""..so shucks I had to open another. Try this out...especially if you already like Saisons."
"D: I wasn't immediately taken in by this beer....but the more I drank it, the more infatuated I bacame. It went from an unsophisticated golden ale to so much more. Very pleased with this beer."
"The aging really takes any of the bite and harshness out of this beer. It is as smooth as can be and lush honey, fruity, floral combo on the nose and the palate with none of the champagne-like sting that can sometimes be apparent from the carbonation. I have always been a fan of Ommegang and the abbey ale seemed to really improve and add an extra layer of complexity with the cave aging wherreas the Hennepin is just smoother, mellower and more drinkable. Excellent !!"
"D - This is a very drinkable beer if you want a little more flavor and kick than the average summer drinking beer."
"Yes...it is the perfect dinner beer."
"This beer pours a cloudy pale orange color. The head is massive, fluffy and off white. Lacing is thorough. The aroma is just right for a saison: grass, citrus, orange. The taste is a little more barnyard than other saisons I have had, but that is not to say that I do not enjoy it. The mouthfeel is light and refreshing with a lot of carbonation. Overall, this is a very good beer that I would really like to see distributed to my area."
"This beer pours a very slightly hazy brilliant gold with a frothy white head. The head holds and laces very well. The smell is spicy from the characteristic saison yeast and lemony with touches of hops all around. The taste is very refreshing. The spicy yeast and slightly wheat characteristics are present along with some light fruitiness. Hops abound and interplay perfectly with the spice from the yeast. The mouthfeel is light-medium with lively carbonation. Overall, a fantastic beer. One of the best belgians out there..and made here in the US."
"Notes: My first saison, and I think I'm gonna really like this style. I'd love to try this brew with a selection of cheeses."
"Medium bodied with an active carbonation. Taste is quite complex morphing between candy sugar fruitiness and clove-like spice. Finishes dry but well received on the palate. Very quenching and flavor infused. Outstanding drinkability. Highly recommended. Cheers."
"Once again, another fine brew from Ommegang. I'll have to seek out the cave aged version of this one."
"I only had a loose bottle of this beer, but feel compelled to pick up a few others. I thought it was outstanding."
"Very nice ale, probably my favorite out of the three I've had from Ommegang. I'm not very familiar with the Saison style but this beer has got me interested. I'd definitely like to try a couple authentic Belgian examples and see how they stack up. I drank this beer alone, but I bet it would pair excellently with many types of food. Recommended."
"a solid saison, that age has definitely mellowed a bit. more than worth a try. it's actually better at a little bit of a lower temperature."
"Overall, a very nice beer. Light and refreshing, yet tasty and complex. Good beer, but i'm not sure i totally agree such a high rating. But still quite good. And for a beer boasting 7.7% alc. this beer hides it incredibly well."
"Overall: This is another great Ommegang beer. Incredibly tasty and refreshing."
"Appearance is a very impressive dark golden color with lots of little bubbles and a big, rocky, lacy head. The smell is of cloves, malt and a touch of spicy hops. The taste follows with cloves, malt sweetness, some fruitiness, a bit of alcohol and some spiciness. The feel is smooth with a nice, medium body. Overall, I liked this beer but I just felt it was too strong and boldly spicy/fruity to be a beer that would be really drinkable. But that's just my tastes I guess."
"I'd attribute the smooth mellowness to the aging."
"This beer poured a thick and abundant head and the color was a dark orange/gold, with a slight haze. The mouthfell was medium light, with bouncing carbonation. The aroma was citrusy, fruity with orange and a dash of spice that leans more towards ginger than pepper. The flavor was refreshing up front, sweet with notes of honey and grains. There is really little of any funk that you might expect from a ""farmhouse"" style. Little spice, aside from what adds sweetness. I do get a little bite from the hops, but not enough to round this out to as rich a beer as it could be. The drinkability is high. I know you shouldn't rate a beer based on what's not there, but I wanted more from this beer than what it gave."
"Side note - if you ever make a pilgrimage to Cooperstown to see the Baseball Hall of Fame - make the quick jog outside of town and visit this brewery. It's small, but one of the best to visit."
"from the bottle. poured a cloudy golden with a white head that did stay around for very long. aroma when I popped the cap on this I got a big wiff of sour fruit, than after the beer was poured into my glass I more of a yeasty citrus aroma some clove and banana. flavor hops, sugar, bubblegum, sweet citrus, alcohol, pepper. I like this one glad I bought a 6er"
"M for a beer with so much head I was expecting an overwhelming carbonatin but it as nice and not overwhelming at all"
"Drinkabilty - drank this out on the croquet court in mid-summer. excellent and very refreshing!"
"Mouthfeel is medium frothy, syrupy but crisp. Nice carbonation."
"Overall, heartily recommended."
"Medium plus in body with great head retention and the complexity of a fine Belgian, I'm craving one right now. Smooth creamy mouthfeel with a nice amount of alcohol to complement this brew, very enjoyable on-tap, cheers!"
"I definitely see myself buying this beer more often now that it is readily available. It is a great summer beer that is light and refreshing. AND at $4.99 retail, not a bad price for a very high quality product."
"From the 750mL corked bottle, to the pop of the cork itself it screams class. It pours a hazy golden-yellow with a thick, rich white head with some pretty impressive lacing. The head sticks around for a bit, too. The nose is hoppy, citrusy and spicy. Some fruitiness there, too. The first sip is like a slap across the face with flavor. Beautiful hops and malt with undertones of citrus and severe spice. It finishes smooth with a lingering bitterness and a dash of spice. Truly a great beer. Though I haven't tried any other saisons, I venture to guess this is a very good example of one."
"Poured from a corked and caged 750 ml bottle, this beer had a hazy golden color with a nice frothy head. Aroma was spicy and citrusy with some malt mixing in. Taste was very spicy and peppery. As the beer warmed I could taste yeasty flavors, some sourness and a lot of orange/citrus. This beer had a light body and was very refreshing. No alcohol flavors were apparent. This is another well crafted(and well priced)beer from Ommegang and one that I plan on drinking a lot of this summer."
"Oh...my. This beer is devilishly drinkable. I can hardly detect the alcohol, as it is well hidden amongst the spices. A 750mL is enough to send me to a happy place, as if the beer weren't enough. I'm not very familiar with Saisons, but all I can say for certain is that this beer is decidedly Belgian, and at $6/750mL, I will buy it again and as often as I can get hold of it. If you love beer, try this beer."
"I tried this beer at a tasting and thought it was pretty good. Now that Im drinking a a whole 750ml bottle, Im not liking it as much. Just being honest."
"Overall, a great example of a saison lacking some of the features of the best saisons available. You won't be disappointed."
"After a whole 750 ml bottle of this stuff I don't get tired of the flavor. Extremely drinkable and very refreshing. At only $4.99, this is an amazing beer for the price. I'm sure I'll be picking this one up a few more times this summer."
"Really gives my mouth a full feeling. This is the second time I have tried this and will definitely have it again."
"Taste; the bananas and cloves are present up front, with a bit of sweet pineapples mixed in. There's a definite belgian yeasty funkiness, with some outdoor/barnyard earthiness going on. A nice spiciness comes out and intermingles with a little hint of some alcohol, and finishes a bit dry. This gets even better once it gets close to room temperature. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, really easy to drink, and very refreshing."
"Poured into an Ommegang stemmed tulip this beer is full of carbonation and develops a rocky head. The head falls to a thin collar. I swear I can smell grains of paradise. and coriander. Coriander on the palate as welll as a touch of Marzipan sweetness. Finishes at first sweet, but then dry. It hides its alcohol content well. I swear this beer is stronger than it was when it was first introduced. Lacks a bit of the complexity that I remember or perhaps it's that other U.S. producers of this style are doing more exciting things. At least it's dry and not as chewy as some beers that American breweries call saison."
"Great for a summer day -- crisp and refreshing. Just enough funk to keep it funky. Pleasing and easy-going."
"Ommegang Hennepin pours a hazy golden color with a thin white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. I'm not getting a lot from the aroma, its fairly mild. Taste is heavy on the horse blanket aspect of Belgian beer. Some hops are noticeable as well. Heavily carbonated, like seltzer, which seems to be appropriate for the style. Interesting. Worth a try, not my favorite style, but probably a pretty decent example of it."
"Drinkabilty - this goes down very easy and I'd easily have another. This is very good."
"Drinkability: Hooray! This is a really drinkable, really interesting ale. Serve with anything that calls for white wine."
"As good as the regular Hennepin is, this version that was aged in caves for eight months in upstate New York is even better. It is not as sharp, and is slightly sweeter. There is a slight apple sweetness to both the smell and the taste that is wonderful. The is still a slight spicy bite upfront, but it mellows into a wonderfully smooth finish. This is one of the best domestic beer I have had the pleasure to try. I think it might be even better with another few months of aging, that would allow it to mellow even more."
"d - very drinkable, although I wouldn't probably do much more than one 750ml bottle."
"Pours with a cloudy, flaxen color much like a hefeweizen. This is the perfect beer for...let's see...just about any day. Summer is best I suppose, as it has a crisp, sweet, clovish flavor that lends itself to a barbecue. The carbonation level is just about right. This beer does not encumber itself with a variety of complex flavors but instead goes right for the jugular, offering a crisp, clean taste."
"Taste  here we go: sweet and sour, earthy, just some notes of Belgium yeast. Mouth was tart, dry, and on the downside, fairly thin. Somewhat bitter. All in all, I have to say I didnt care for it, and I like the Schlafly version of Saison. Wouldnt go after this again, but would not turn down a glass of it, either."
"Hennepin is a tasty brew. This pours a nice cloudy golden color, with a fair sized while foamy head. The smell is citrusy and hinting of hops. The taste is nice, a fine balance of hops and malts give this brew an uniquley understated spicey flavor. The pairs nicely with a turkey sandwich. This would be a nice beverage to have on hand to serve up with almost any meal, as it seems to pair nicely with most foods. If you see this on the shelf, buy some and give it a go."
"This Saison pours a cloudy gold with a thick 1 inch white meringue head. A decent amount of carbonation makes its way to the head. Yeasty esters with the usual orange, clove floral on the nose. Taste is spicy on the tongue up front and mellows to a fruity, floral finish. Very smooth with almost a dry champagne mouth feel. Dangerously easy to drink."
"Really challenging, and I had to take a few sips to reassure myself that this is indeed a beer. Halfway through and I'm really impressed. This is no easy beer. It's more of an arthouse film where you have to pay attention to every moment or you'll miss something critically important."
"Pours out a golden, yellow color. It was slightly cloudy. It also left some lacing. The head was very large. It smells of spice and hops. The hop flavor was very apparent as well as the yeast flavor. Mouthfeel was crisp and a little dry. It rates very drinkable, but due to the size of the bottle, maybe just one."
"Probably more third favorite Saison after Les Bon Voeux and Dupont. I've had this from a corked bottle and on tap many times. Hazy golden color with fantastic foamy head. Aroma is a little more subdued that other saisons. Nice grassy and fruity taste. These go down too smooth."
"astringent and quite hoppy saison.. has a nice mouthfeel and is straw colored.. alcohol is quite present in this light colored but nice bodied ale..excellent sumer quencher with fruity notes and lots of carbonation.. smooth and filling, yet highly drinkable."
"Drinkability: I am indeed impressed by this. A good amount of masked alcohol, lots of balance and flavor, and around $8 for a 4 pack, or at least that's what I paid. Ommegang's becoming one of my favorite breweries. Along with Allagash, they know what they're doing with the Belgians. Saisons are a singular and special brew to me, and this is definitely done very well and is highly recommended."
"This farmhouse saison poured a hazed but not opaque , golden straw color with a large , creamy white head that stayed around as a quarter inch of foam , more dense and chunky in some areas then others. Nice spots of lacing left on the glass and the beer cleared up quite a bit as it warmed. The smell is very inviting. Malt , clove ,spice , fruit , grain , yeast , and a tinge of honey are all in the nose. Flavor is pleasant and complex. Some tartness in the form of grain and citric/lemon tastes , clove, bit of medicinal phenolic qualites , bready malt , tad bit of honey , slight peppery spice, a bit of banana and herbal notes , and a yeasty dryness in the end. Mouthfeel is on the slick side. This is one tasty brew. So sooo drinkable and flavourful! I will be buying many more of these in the future."
"Bottom line: Here's an *excellent* example of the Saison style that should please the most discerning Belgian Ale drinker. Recommended!!"
"Mouthfeel is light to medium, somewhat slick but with plenty of fizz to keep it from sticking. Very easy to drink and refreshing. Easy to put back a little too fast, but it's a quencher of a style and it does the job well."
"Verdict: Sturdy and flavorful. Recommended."
"Now before trying this I preffered the darker beligians a lot more and I still do, but not by as much. This was surprisingly perfect. I can't wait to try others of the style."
"Final Thought: This is an excellent example of a craft beer with great creativity; it is not only a staple in its class but also an excellent buy."
"It sucks that beers like this arent available in Canada. This is emminently drinkable and extremely complex. Thanks to Nick at Bauer Wines for the recommendation."
"Pours a tarnished golden color with a big, rocky white head. Looks very appetizing. The nose is a pretty subtle and not nearly as forward as some other saisons... there's some spice in there, along with a bit of barnyard funk and some yeast. Flavor is quite fruity right off the bat, with a round sweetness that's overcome by those barnyard/horse blanket notes, helped by some hops. Highly carbonated mouthfeel that doesn't get in the way of the smoothness of this beer. Overall, a wonderful, versatile beer. Interesting, easy to like and complex at the same time."
"This is a fine beer and comparable to similar ones more fabled from Belgian. For the price, its quite a bargain considering its Belgian kin will likely cost you twice as much."
"A very drinkable beer, an absolute pleasure to enjoy on it's own or with a nice meal."
"it definitely leaves me craving more."
"Very natural and enjoyable."
"Very drinkable brew! Had I not known differently, there is no way I'd have guessed that this wasn't brewed in Belgium. Well done, Ommegang!"
"This is a no-nonsense Saison without any wild or unusual characterstics. As such, it's a fine represenation of the style, it's delicious going down, and I'm glad I've got more left in the bottle."
"She actually reminds me of a ""Saison Dupont"" who mated with ""La fin du monde"" as wannabe."
"It was only once the beer left the glass and found its way onto my tongue that disappointment set in. Admittedly, for my first sip the beer was way too cold, so i let it sit for some time. Unfortunately i don't like how it opened up. Tart, bubbly, mildly sweet, citrusy, and earthy. It all sounds nice, except the tartness was too strong. Resulted in an extremely unbalanced flavor. Not to say the beer was terrible, it wasn't, however it could use significantly more strength from the earthy/malty notes. Tartness and acidity need to be toned down a bit. Noting the beer's high rating, it looks like i'm in the minority here, but so it goes. I'll stick with the 3 Philosophers next time I hit up Ommegang"
"D - I'd still choose an American ale over the belgians right now but they are really starting to grow on me. I've had several in the past and this one is definitely the best by far. I would definitely buy this again."
"Bottle Pours a hazy yellow with a fair white fizzy head. Has a typical belgian aroma. Sweet with decent spicies. Has a nice carbonation and a good mouthfeel. A nice slight bitterness. Good crisp flavor. This one kind of snuck up on me. I enjoyed this ale very much."
"pours a light straw yellow with a monster 2in white foamy head that looks amazing....Somewhat of a yeasty smell along with some hops and actually a hint of apple...When it first hit my tounge it was fairly sweet and then mildly bitter from the hops...very nice combination...Medium bodied with a nice amount of carbination...Fairly good drinkability as well"
"very drinkable, but i'm not as impressed as others seem to be. pleasant to drink, but not a ton of depth or complexity."
"Slightly hazy golden color with white rocky head that has some good retention. Pretty good lacing. Yeasty ""belgian"" smell. Some fruitiness and a hint of lemon smell to it. Smooth crisp feel up front. Semi sweet lemony taste starts with sharp spicy taste following. Yeasty taste in the palate with slight bitterness left over. This is a great beer. Lots of flavor and VERY drinkable. If I had the money and resources, I could sit down with this beer all night long."
"Hazed pale gold with a short, bright white head made up of a combination of very fine and rocky bubbles. Great retention and plenty of lacing throughout. Aromas of lemon zest, bready yeast and vinous white wine grapes dominate, but there's a hint of caramel as well. Strong citrus component in the flavour that really lingers backed up by a bit of hop bitterness. Sweetness is light and there's a delicate fruity grape flavour and light spice in the finish. Soft alcohol warmth. Creamy carbonation and lightly palate coating. Off-dry. Refreshing and very enjoyable, this is one well-crafted beer."
"The flavor is good yet mild enough to beg for more."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle. The beer poured a hazy golden color with a thick white head with good lacing and thick lively bubbles. The aroma is a nice citrusy mix with some spice. Perfect farmhouse smell. The taste give a good balance of the citrusy, sweetness and the thick carbonation. These two mask nicely the 7.5% ABV. Overall this is an enjoyable beer in one of my favorite styles."
"Overall, this is okay, but a bit disappointing to me considering the source of brewing."
"I was looking forward to trying this beer, and came away unimpressed. I had a 750ml bottle, started cold, let the bottle sit at room temperature before pouring again. It was a cloudy yellow appearance with a very minimal head and no lace to speak of. It had a nice tart fruit odor to it, and a nondescript fruity taste, with some slight hoppiness. It felt just OK in the mouth. Was good to drink, but not exciting. I'll have to try it again to see if it was me or that particular bottle that wasn't working well."
"D - I'm half way through the 750ml bottle now and I'll assuredly finish it. What a pleasant, fun beer. I've had Ommegang Three Philosophers, and the Rare Vos, and liked them both for their own merits ... but this one, so far, is my favorite from Ommegang hand's down. Imminently drinkable and user-friendly, this ale ranks at the very top of the category ... Belgian or not. I had to remind myself that this wasn't an authentic Belgian ale, at least in the sense that it was brewed there. It IS authentic ... just from NY. Highly recommended and may well have a place in my top 10. An accomplishment. My hat (if I had one) off to Brewery Ommegang for this outstanding beer. I will buy more and propogate it liberally to my friends ... too good not to share."
"Super drinkable, a solid saison."
"Opinion: Well, after all was said and done, I ended up liking this beer even though I am convinced that it has some age on it. The flavor was complex and there were only minor flaws caused by the age. I would definitely try this beer again when it is a fresher example"
"Pours a hazed citrusy yellow, with the most aggressive head I have ever enjoyed...massive, sticky, and unrelenting, be careful when you pour this one. Nose is fruity with an interesting background of typical musty, sweatish notes that are expected in the style...smells very appropriate. Taste is a bit smoother than expected with delicious lemon and clove along with dry finish and mild alcoholic warming. This one is a balanced and easy drinking example of the style, very good...I'll have this again"
"D: Highly drinkable brew. Good balance of flavors, alcohol doesn't play too strongly. Mouthfeel is great. Highly recommended..."
""
"Pours a lightly hazy medium yellow with a large, white, pillowy head with good retention. The smell is if moderate wheat over yeast and mild malt aromas. Banana, coriander, melon, green apple and some light flowers. The fruitiness is light but very nice. Taste-wise, its quite similar to the nose, but better. Malts come on a little stronger accompanied by some fruity esters, dry hops, and a little more spiciness. The finish is floral, lightly bitter and slightly astringent. Very nice mouthfeel, light and refreshing despite its complexity. Nicely done."
"After struggling with the cork for some time, the bottle burst open and spattered my pant legs with beer. After blotting my self dry, I poured the beer and noted a golden colour with some murkiness. A small white head developed but flattened hurriedly. Some random fingers of lace stuck throughout the tasting. The nose had a funky wheat sort of spice quality. P'raps a bit clovey and peppery as well. Yeasty. The beer was also mildly alcoholic and was somehow reminding me of lagerish scents. The taste was somewhat ""farmhouse"" sour. Notes of banana and wheatish flavours as well as clove and strange esters were notable. The mouthfeel had a sort of creaminess and a solid pils style body. Easily medium. The drinkability was not a problem for me. Overall, this is a pretty good beer. Great, nah."
"Drinkability - Had a 750ml bottle, and I want more! This was good, was my first saison style and now I want another."
"I put 4 on the drinkability b/c of its richness."
"Overall, a great beer and the first saison I've had. I will definitely come back to this one often."
"Overall: A great beer-great flavor and lush. Definately worth a try and worthy of a permanent place in my fridge. Bumped it's way into the realm of my favorites. Excellent rendition of an (sadly) obscure style."
"I shared a pitcher of this beer with my girlfriend and a friend of hers. This beer looks fantastic in the Hennepin goblets they gave us. The beer has a hazy golden coloration. The head is very thick and an off white color. The lacing was very good and followed the beer all the way down the glass until completion it has a peppery-nutmeg spicy fermented fruit smell with nice musty spicy yeasty notes. The taste is floral-citrus sweetness with lovely spicy notes in the flavor. This beer is very balanced. This beer has a medium-light mouthfeel. There is good carbonation in this beer. This is just an easy to drink beer."
"This is my first beer of this style and I must say that it is delicious. I think it will be even better when the warm weather gets here."
"Another great one from Ommegang."
"With a medium body that leaned to the fuller side, I was surprised at this brew's lightness on the palate. The clean finish was nice as well. This is a really good beer. Kind of like a wheat but with more body."
"Ommegang makes such good beer. The fact that its practically in my backyard is a bonus. Hennepin was the first Beer i tried from ommegang, and remains my favorite. I love saisons, and this is a bonafide classic. cloudy, sour, refreshing, not to sweet, damn good stuff. This beer pours a light gold amber, hazy with a healthy foamy head retention, nice yeasty ring in the bottom of the bottle left behind. Smells of citrus, a little alcohol, light sweetness. The flavor is all saison, nice sour tartness, a little sweetness to balance it out, wonderfully refreshing. Great Beer ."
"On the whole this is one of my favorite beers. It has just enough hop bitterness to complement the yeast/fruit tastes typical of Belgians. To my mind this is the finest saison around. An American classic!!"
"Pours a hazy gold with big carbonation and a thick white head that lasts. Aroma is dominated by spice with a hint of fruit. The flavor displays a dry, peppery character with an underlying lime-like citrus essence. Spritzy carbonation, a medium body, and a slightly perceptable alcohol finish make this an excellent example of the style."
"Drinkability -- Quite quaffable. This is one I'll be seeking out on a regular basis. This is my first Ommegang product and I like it very much. You get a lot of value for the price you pay. I cannot believe this is made in New York. It totally feels like it's from Belgium. Great stuff!"
"This beer pours a light, mild golden yellow with a bit of smooth white head sustained by a stream of bubbles from the bottom of the chalice. Smells of caramel and spicy yeast with a wonderful sour grape smell. The flavor is dominated by an amazing musky yeast and malt that are beyond my vocabulary, but I must try none the less. Theres a mossy anis-like yeast that just grooves with my palate and a green grass undertone. Theres also an obscured foundation of sweet grains that taste like oats and wheat. Light airy bubbles seem to unlock a hint of mandarin oranges and a very subtle dry piney hops. The mouth feel was medium bodied with an unobtrusive carbonation. Absolutely amazing. I just couldnt/cant believe that this is made in New York. Highly recommended."
"Pours a very hazy golden, huge white head forms, good retention and lots of lace. Smell is sweet, honey, some cork, wheat, citrus, spice and yeast. Taste is sweet with notes of honey, spice, very malty, wheat, caramel and yeast. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium to high carbonation. Good beer but I don't think I'd put it in the top 100."
"The way this beer is presented and tastes, I could easily be fooled into thinking it's a $15 Belgian import. $5.69, are you kidding me? Unreal!"
"I recently had the Southampton Cuvee Des Fluers at David Copperfield's in New York City, and I feel that their offering and this brew would do a lot to expand the average beer drinkers horizons. The only thing that I would wish for regarding Hennepin is that it would be more readily available in my neck of the woods. I believe the effort to increase it's exposure would be well worth it in the end. Highly recommended!"
"Cheers!"
"D: Quite good."
"M & D: Mouthfeel is nice with a good level of carbonation that may seem overpowering at first but isn't that bad and has a very nice smoothness. Light feel that leaves a refreshing taste in your mouth."
"Light and airy, with just a hint of spice from the yeast, this one is a really special beer, mellow, full of subtle flavor. Get some, store some, love some."
"Bottle: Poured a clear golden yellow ale with a huge bubbly white head with above standard retention. Aroma of pear and lemon with some distinguishable yeast. Taste is really hoppier then most Saison I have tried with a dry finish. Body is quite full and spice mix is interesting but could have been more accentuated. Very interesting take on the style."
"Drinkability: This is just an easy to drink beer. Pure drinking pleasure through and through."
"Very nice amber/golden color with a great fluffy off white head. Vinuous and earthy aroma-heavy yeast and spices. Big malt flavor. Extremely spicy-peppery and a sour grapefruitiness to it. Earthy as all get out-almost dirt like in spots. Fairly dry finish to it. I dont really care for the mouthfeel-its too bright and fizzy to me, though it lessens as the beer warms. Even some of the highly carbonated triples arent this fizzy. Overall a very drinkable beer. Ommegang certainly gets high marks from me. They really got a good thing going on."
"Nice beer!! Bought two of these, one for now, one for later. Pours a hazy yellow color, thick white head. Smells a bit yeasty and fruity. Taste, wow!! A nice blend of some dried fruit, alcohol, fresh bread and bitterness. A bit strong but not overpowering. Something you want to relax with on a weekend night."
"This is one sick brew, one of my favorites. A+++"
"One of the better beers i've had from the Saison style. Pours out to a slighly cloudy golden color with a nice head of white foam. High level of carbonation. Aromas of earth and barnhouse are strong, with some sweet malts and spice notes. Taste is very quaffable; flavors of malts, volatile yeast, sweet grain and mild corn are present and blend quite well. I have to say, this beer gets better as it slightly warms. Mouthfeel is smooth and silky, going down far too easy for the higher ABV that it possesses. Drinkability is good. I really like this beer, and considering i'm not a big fan of the style, it's very good. Highly recommended for the style."
"750 mL, caged and corked. ""Cave-aged"" in Howe Caverns for 8 months; released October 8, 2005 and aged in my cellar for another two months. Bottle doesn't look any different than the regular ""non-cave-aged"" stuff, except there's a hangtag proclaiming that it sat 156 feet underground, etc. and there's a bunch of fuzzy cobwebby stuff and dust on the outside of the bottle. Hazy golden orange with massive, beautiful egg-white head that meringues and leaves an incredible webby lacing all the way down the sides of my Ommegang cervoise. Aroma is yeasty, bitter citrus peel, fresh apple juice, vanilla. Spicy, earthy, and fruity flavors abound. A bit vinous at the back of the palate. Granny Smith apples and newly-mown grass. Mellow ginger spiciness, yeast, and a lingering aftertaste of peach cobbler with vanilla and powdered ginger. Medium body; creamy smooth and dry for so much pronounced fruit flavor. This is one of my all time favorite beers from an all time favorite brewery. Saisons are all pretty unique (at least the ones I've tried), so it's a bit risky to say which one is ""the Best."" However, Hennepin, whether cave-aged or not, is absolutely one of the finest examples of the style in the world and easily the best Saison produced in the U.S. Difficult to imagine anyone pulling it off better than this. Fives all around."
"A great saison, and I would heartily reccomend it."
"Overall, really one of the best beer experiences I've had in awhile. The total package. it does everything perfectly stylewise, but still remains extremely accessible. From the Elk Grove BevMo."
"The balance and light-body made this very refreshing and quite drinkable. A delicious beer all-around."
"Pours a nice straw yellowed hue and makes an inch of densely bubbled white head into my petrus goblet. Sweet aroma, filled with banana, coriander & cloves. Sweet bready flavor with notes of light fruits, peppery spice, medium hop bittering, banana. Bit of alcoholic bite. I really am enjoying this. Mouthfeel opens with a peppery carbonation but as the bottle warms it becomes velvety smooth and finishes dry. This is an awesome saison considering how easy it is to get. Definitely will be a staple in my beer fridge."
"Full wheat body, very nice, drinkable food pairing beer."
"Makes me actually want to try other Saison-style beers. Maybe Belgium makes something worth consuming other than french fries. . ."
"Cheers!"
"All in all, I think it is a fine example of the style, but certainly not my thing. But if you love saisons, you have to give this one a try."
"Taste is mild and pleasing as well, a quality drinker. Hard to believe this is brewed in new york, as it screams Import."
"Very good. I'm looking forward to trying more of this style."
"A very dry mouthfeel due to the high ABV."
"This is a really nice beer, but it doesn't have the stones to really assert itself. The citrus bite is a little too strong for me to laud it as being highly smooth and drinkable. The beer is on the fence between a Belgian-style flavor bomb and a mellowed-out, easily-quaffable brew."
"Extremely drinkable beer, if you can handle the 7.7% abv. Wonderful spring/summer beer... glad this is finally available in NC, as it is certainly one of the best deals for the money out there."
"This beer is really good, probably a little too good for MNF but I'm definitely not complaining. Guess I'll need to investigate this Saison thing.."
"I prefer heavier darker beers in winter and lighter during the warmer months, but I enjoy Hennepin 12 months of the year. This beer is the benchmark from which I compare all beers."
"Feels creamy but light on the tongue. As I get toward the end, wow(!), I realize how much I am enjoying this beer. While I wasn't initially floored, the great balance in this beer makes it a great drink!"
"Overall I would have liked more of a tart flavor but that taste is good and a very enjoyable beer."
"Will be buying it bottled very soon."
"Tasty and quaffable, nothign stood out extraordinary, but I'd drink it again."
"Hennepin is one of my favorite farm house ales. The pour is smooth with a great white head forming almost immediately if poured into a fluted glass. The head is creamy and stays for the duration while lacing down the glass. The beer is a cloudy honey color and the bottle conditioning adds an interesting pattern to the final pour. The smell is a bit sour with great malt notes and yeast esters. The taste is exceptional; it is a tad sour but only in balance not in excess. The malty sweetness creeps up slowly as the aftertaste fades into complex notes of barley and yeast. The mouthfeel is crisp and clean and this beer is very drinkable. This is my favorite beer from Ommegang. Cheers!"
"Review edit...I tried this one initally over chilled. As the beer warms it unlocks hidden smells and flavors that are not present when cooler in temp. There is a sweeter more pronounced body and more hop character when warm, the boquet also opens up to a more spicy oroganic nose, with a definite yeast presence that envokes a bananna aroma that should make chaquita jealous."
"The thing I like most about this beer is that my friends and family don't give a God awful look when they try it, unlike most high gravity beers that are filtering into this post Pop the Cap state. It's enjoyable in every fashion but does not scream Wow in my opinion. Light and floral, the hoppiness is not overwhelming and is easy enough to consume (even though a glassful is still sitting in my fridge two days later). Cheaper compared to the other Ommegang choices available here."
"Overall this is a superior American made Belgian Ale. 750ml for $3.88 at the corner grocer is a no brainer for an alternative to anything else they have to offer. Upstate NY Rocks!"
"A nice, well-balanced offering from Ommegang. Very similar to Duvel, but more complex and fruity. For the price, I'll buy this again."
"There are a lot of things going on in this beer, so I don't know that this is a beer that you would drink glass after glass of. It could become fatiguing. Also with a slightly higher alcohol content 1 or 2 bottles and I would be ready to switch for the day, but only to come back again tomorrow."
"I would have given it all 5's, but I suppose it could be improved...not really sure how."
"Drink: Good"
"This beer pours a cloudy straw yellow color with a slight orange tint to it. It has a thick fluffy white head that fades very slowly leaving a huge amount of thick laces. This beer has a spicy aroma, with a little pepper mixed in. It smells slightly hoppy. I can detect a clove aroma. Also, it is slightly floral. The taste is not as spicy as the aroma would suggest. It is still spicy, but I just expected a bit more. The alcohol is slightly noticable in the flavor. It has a hoppy flavor also. It also has a very slight citrus flavor. Lemon, I think. Also, this beer has a slight sour taste. The sour taste is appealing. This beer is highly carbonated, which is good for the style. It is light, and crisp, providint a very refreshing, smooth beer. It leaves a slightly hoppy, slightly spicy aftertaste. I think this beer would make a great session beer. the only problem I have it the alcohol content. It might be a little high for the style, but it is still very good. This is a great beer."
"I think this is a tremendous bargain at $8 per 4-pack."
"The taste really does improve as the beer warms, and, by bottle end, I detected a nice dry, wine like flavor. Overall, it has many flavors and is very smooth and tasty."
"This beer breaks the arguments of wine snobs down to detrital slime."
"Cloudy straw yellow with a tall white fluffy head. A bit light on the lacing. Funky yeast scents with lots of fruity notes to it. A bit lighter grassy hops. Light fruitiness, pears and apples mainly with a backing of spiciness and yeast. A bit of doughy malt and citrus flavor blend in well. Spicy grassy and funky yeast finish this out. Lively in the mouth with carbonation this is also clean, crisp and quite refreshing. Very easy drinking to the point it almost goes down to quickly. Great example of the style."
"Pours a yellowish color like hay with a white head. The smell is very interesting because there is so much going on...malt, yeast, fruit undertones. A hint of bread as well (probably from the yeast). The taste was exceptional with it's complexity and balanced texture. I tasted a bit of fruit-inspired bitterness with some spice flavoring. As the brew warms, I taste more sweetness and less bitterness, but that may be my tastebuds being confused by this beer. My mouth is left wanting more; a bready texture on my tongue. Very simple and yet distinct. A terrific beer with great taste and easy to drink anytime."
"Not my cup of beer. The medicinal taste is just a bit too much. Maybe I need to grow in that direction. You should try it for yourself."
"Great carbonation with a full two finger head.A light color,but expected from this style.This has a full aromatic smell.It really reminds me of summer.Full of spices and a hint of fruit.A clear crisp taste with no after taste.Very drinkable, an excellent summer ale,from one of the best brewers in America."
"Drinkability: A very nice drop, with a lot going on"
"Driankability is good a decent saison, not one of the best but at the price a hell of a bargin now I just need to cave age some."
"D: A suburb representation of the style. The characteristic tartness is present, but not overwhelming, making this a very smooth drinking beer. For the value, there are few that can match this one."
"Palate- This is a clean, dry beer with a lemony, spicy character. It's clean and dry enough to whet the appetite for food. It doesn't quite match the peerless balance of some of the Belgian saisons, but it's very good, and a great value."
"Its corked bottle opens with a satisfying 'pop!' The pour is hazy yellow with a big creamy head. The aroma features citrus and pepper with a hint of hops. Lemon zest, spice, hops, and yeast come together nicely for a complex taste that's crisp and drinkable. The mouthfeel is light bodied and bubbly. The 7.5% is well hidden. At less than $5, this fantastic saison could be the best bargain around."
"What a gorgeous cloudy orange color- very nice, with a fluffy white head. Nice spicy smell with a little citrus fruit and hay. Lovely dance of bright flavors with nicely restrained sweetness. Again, spicy, peppery with complex fruit undertones, but especially citrus peel. The malts underneath are not overbearing. Feels smooth and slick in the mouth and fills it completely with bright carbonation. This is so easy to drink... so easy... there's no problem having one after another.... just do it slowly so you remain standing..."
"Yellow straw colored, slightly clouded, with a white tightly-bubbled head that rises up thick and settles down to a one inch cap. Aroma is not too strong, but has definite notes of yeast and spice, a little grassy floral, but not what I'd call hoppy. Mouthfeel is fairly dry and crisp, even carbonation. Flavor is understated, a little yeasty but not overpoweringly so, some sweetness and some peppery spice, no one flavor taking over the pallete. Finishes clean with some residual spice and yeast flavors in the aftertaste."
"At the big grocery store (Wegmans) it is $4.49 for a 750ML ... at that price, I am drinking this a LOT more. My first Saison ... boy I hope they are all this good."
"very good indeed. typical belgian character. this is very smooth and drinkable. most people might fight it hard to believe that it is 7.5% abv. i could taste hardly a trace of alcohol. it has the typical belgian crisp fruitiness too it, but nothing is overdone. i enjoyed it greatly."
"Overall, a very nice beer. I'm still new to saisons, but this is the best I've had to date."
"This stuff is very good !"
"Taste a nice wheaty flavor with definate fruit. I did a earlier reveiw on the same company and belive me they dont skimp on the fruits. Also smelling apples and citrus notes.By the way lacing is awsome . Medium body. Traces of the high alchohol only detected on the finish. A great summer beer very refreshing. Malty and sweet very impressed."
"Body hovers between light and medium, with a crisp mouthfeel and a light and airey texture. Way too easy to drink. Me and Gabe make short work of this 750."
"The beer after its release from the 12-ounce brown bottle resides in my glass a crystalline golden amber color with a monsterous creamy light tan head that very slowly erodes leaving a thick and glutinous sheet of lace upon the glass. Nose has a fresh citrus like crispness, tart comes to mind, also a sweet earthiness, start is sweet and perfectly malted, the top is light to medium in feel. Finish is striking in its acidity, hops delectable in their spicy bite, desert bone dry and long lasting is the aftertaste. Ommegang has been a favorite brewery for many years, and I always try to keep a few bottles around."
"For a higher ABV beer, this is quite drinkable. Though the alcohol is present, it is not overpowering. Try it."
"drinkability: very drinkable"
"Smooth on the palate with a touch of bubbles. Tastes of grain and alcohol. A little citrus, but barely. Dry. Great balance."
"This was my first saison."
"D - Goes down extrodinarily easy. Soothing and very drinkable."
"Pours a clear straw yellow with a thick, frothy white head that retains well. Aroma is a funky blend of malt, spices and hops; i detect pepper, nutmeg, corrainder, sourdough bread, lightly floral and mineraly hops, a subtle but intesnsely complex aroma. Taste is equally complex and challenging; at first the bready malt takes center stage, then onto the spices including but not limited to: nutmeg, lemon zest, corrainder, and pepper, and then a lightly bitter hops flavor that is earthy, mineraly and slightly citrusy. There is also a fruity yeast flavor that adds yet another layer of complexity to this fantastic brew. The mouthfeel is smooth with moderate carbonation, and the drinkability is excellent (especially on a hot summer day) and the alcohol is very well concealed and only lightly warming. An excellent saison from Ommegang, this is my first purchase of a beer over 6% in NC and it was definately a good one...looking forward to trying the rest of their beers."
"Cloudy, pale yellow beer with an ample--very ample--head and lacing. Smells of lemons, esters, bubblegum, yeast; basically, it smells like a witbier. I don't have that much experience with saisons, and I'm not exactly sure of the difference between the two, but Hennepin has a definite hop bite in its flavor. Feels nice and light in the mouth. This is good, but I don't think it's exactly my style."
"Very high drinkability with a long fruity finish. I am going to go back to the little store in Austin where I found these (Ommegang is not around TX anymore) and buy them out! Fabulous beer!! If you can find some near you....drink it!!"
"D - This is a fantastically tasty brew and a great example of this style. Easy to drink, easy to go in for the next sip. Well done, Ommegang!"
"A wonderful saison to say the least...many thanks to beerbuddy JiLLian for this one!"
"Mouthfeel was excellent ...nice carbonation tingling and oily remnace was a nice fit. reccomended. I found this to be highly drinkable and never boring. citrus/fruit compliments nicely."
"this one popped the cork into the ceiling so hard i needed to check for structural damage to the home. it had a huge head that heavily laced the glass. it was a medium yellow color. it smelled heavily of grain, some spice and a very faint fruit. hennepin tastes great but i expected a little more complexity. it finishes quite dry and begs for another, but this beer is strong enough that may not be a great idea."
"Overall, I will be glad to get the Ommegang line back here in NC. They are really doing fine work up there at Cooperstown. I sure do love their price point, too."
"Well, I've tried cave-aged Hennepin twice now, and I honestly have to say that it doesn't smell or taste any different to me than any other cellared bottle of Hennepin that I've had. It's a very decent beer fresh, and I appreciate that, but I like to put 6 to 12 months on it to drop the yeast and soften it a touch. So, that said, the cave age is no different from my cellared bottles except that there's dust and tiny chunks of rock (?) on the bottle. If you don't have a cellar that holds 55-65 F during summer, you might want to try one of these; but other than that, forget the extra expense and do it yourself. It's only a few buck put away for a little while (it doesn't really improve beyond conditioning, and I think it's quite nice and ready to go with even four months under its belt). But keep in mind, this is one of my favorite beers to begin with, and my favorite beer from Ommegang, so maybe I'm biased. Cheers!"
"Pours a golden straw yellow with a frothy white head. Nose is complex like its Abbey Ale cousin, but this time it's floral, fruity and spicy. Taste follows suit with apples, pears and grapefruit dominating with a spicy, hoppy bite. Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing and the 7.7% abv is hidden so well I think I could down a couple big bottles of this, though it would probably hit me like a train. A little more accessible for me than the Abbey Ale, I'm becoming a fan of Ommegang for their tasty Belgians at unbeatable prices.."
"Looks like I am reviewist #380. Corked and Caged 750 mL bottle, cork needs a little persuasion to get ejected. Cloudy yellow color, there are streams of carbonation visible in the body. Head is very large, about 3/4", with lots of creaminess and good retention. Smell is fruity and slightly peppery, with beligianesque yeast present. Taste is light and very crisp, citrusy and slightly spicy. Alcohol adds to the warm/spicey efffect. Great carbonation level, this is truely a beer bargain for $4.50 for a 750. I just wish it was available around here."
"oh, and the other negative is that i didn't get any hennepin passport promotional items from terry. hmm. i wanted that damn canoe too!"
"that being said, hennepin is delicious"
"750ml bottle served in a Hennepin tulip glass. Yellow, slightly hazed color with a thick white head. Very faint aroma; touch of hops. Tasty beer; clean, easy drinking with a nice mix of fruits and hops. Little in the way of aftertaste; this is probably the most accesible of the Ommegang beers I've tried for non-BA's."
"I am inspired to brew a Saison next time I open up the back yard brewery."
" notes: once ajusted to the style this is a great beer. this is not a drink alone and meditate beer like some belgians. this a drink in a hottub full of people at a party type of beer. there is no beer that feels this light for 7.5. recomended. for the price double recomended."
"I have always been impressed with all of the Ommegang beers. Hennepin looks very yellow, cloudy, and carbonous. Dense white head that laced well. Smells citrusy sweet and citrusy tart. Spicy, yeasty, and earthy with a mild hop aroma. Tastes Lightly malty. Sweet like pears, apples, and honey. Spices of corriander, cloves, and a bit peppery. Tart on the side of white wine or cider. Wheat and yeast round out the flavors. Light hop flavor compound the spice and offset the sweet. Feels tingly and mildly hot to the toung and palate. Medium body and creamy texture. Finishes powdery sweet and lightly tart, all the while, dry and crisp. The aftertaste leaves malty sweetness on the light side, leaving me wanting another sip."
"You will find this beer interesting from start to finish. There is so much going on here that you couldn't possibly get bored. Drunk, yes, bored, no! Great example of a farmhouse saison."
"When poured into a tulip glass, I got cloudy golden color with a massive head of foam. Got the same head of foam everytime when I poured a little more into my glass when it got a little low. The smell had lots of fruits and spices in it. It smelled like wine but better. The taste had a lot of spices, fruit and citrus in it and with a hoppy aftertaste. Very complex. This beer is cheap at below $5 for 750ml bottle and one hell of a good beer. This is another beer that I would buy again. Keep up the good work Ommegang!"
"Finally got around to trying this brew. Found it on-tap at Red Bones. Poured a slightly hazy orangish yellow in color. Slight copper tinge. Slight head that created a whole hell of a lot of lace. Nose is citrus with some spice hovering in the background. Flavor was great. Lots of spice and a solid malt backbone. Truckloads of spice threatened to overwhelm the tongue. Alcohol came through quite vibrantly also. Mouthfeel was more carbonated than I expected with a thick and heavy feel on the tongue. Very drinkable."
"A 750ml of Hennepin is my personal favorite for a post-work relaxation session. Goes well with winning streaks by the New York Metropolitans."
"Let me just say, I could not believe the appearance of this in the glass. I had a 750 ml bottle and the first pour was extremely clear! It had a nice golden orange color which was so clear it was like looking through a window. The second pour was a little bit more cloudy because of the yeast follow through. This is the best part - the yeast really intensified the smell and flavor of this beer. Had a scent and taste of coriander and citrus which was well-balanced with the malt flavors. Very refreshing and tasty in and highly recommended."
"this is one incredible ale. enjoyable experience indeed."
" The nose is extremely complex. It is earthy and yeasty. It is of heavy spices. The taste is wonderful. It is also earthy and yeasty, with a hint of lemon, backed by less spice than the smell suggests. The mouthfeel is slightly better than good. I could easily drink this all day, maybe even for two days. The $4.50 per bottle is a huge selling point."
"Pack up the picnic basket with some ham & swiss on rye and a playful companion. Enjoy the day."
"Deep yellow with a substantial light yellow head. Smells of tart fruits and delicate hops. Sweet grains also present. Lovely, balanced scent. The fruits are present to taste, but more citrus than expected. The hops are indeed delicate and subtle, but still noticeable. This beer has a beautiful taste that expands delightfully in the mouth. Fan-TAS-tic!"
"The taste is amazing. A lot of banana like esters with a little bit of orange or citrus zing. The flavor makes it very easy to give this beer a swish. Great mouthfee. Moderate carbonation on this one. You'll know when you pop the cork. Great drinkability. Thanks for sending me this one Weare138."
"Cooperstown!!)"
"Drinkability is awesome. I'm only getting the slightest warming in my stomach. I really like this beer. Big and quenching."
"This one blew the cork out along with the cork cage ... before I had fully undone the cage. Powerful blast. Pours an orange color with a very tall head that leaves tons of lacing on the glass. The aroma has a lot of spices along with a solid malt backing. Slight hop character as well. The flavor has a nice spice character and a definite hop presence. Very interesting mixture. Blends well for a crisp taste. Finish has a bit of sweetness. The mouthfeel is light-moderate and the drinkability is very good - the alcohol is well hidden."
"Now, I'm always in the mood for Hennepin- but, I can see this lovely cave-aged version being more of a specific craving. That being said... I can see cravings for this happening frequently. The sad thing is there are only 3360 out there... mine was number 1010. Oh well. Get it while it's there. Yummy, yummy, yummy."
"Where the hell is cave aged Three Philosophers?"
"Smooth creamy mouthfeel with champagne like effervescence. Easily drinkable, the 750 goes down like water. Fast becoming one of my favorite styles. Drink this one outside and enjoy yourself on a sunny day!"
"The drinkability of this brew is incredible. It is so smooth and wonderful you could drink it all night, but at over 7% abv, you'd regret it in the morning, I suppose."
"Hazed yellow with a monster head this beer reveals its pleasures when it warms up. The nose becomes fruity withnotes of yeast and flowers. The taste is incredibly complex yet easy drinking and summery. I think that next to Southhampton this is New World's best Saison. Try it with food as this beer is truly food friendly."
"Appearance is great. Perfect clear (no yeast in the pour at first) peach color with a totally luscious looking cream colored head that won't go away and leaves plenty of lacing. Smell is pepper and clove and yeasty spiciness more than anything. Phenols in the background. Taste is bursting with flavor. Orange and other citrus at the front, with plenty of spiciness to go around as the brew moves around my mouth. Dry finish. Very quenching and went suberbly with the Mexican food I had for dinner. This is highly recommended. Mouthfeel is very light which is par for the style. Adding the yeast isn't recommended as the extra spiciness kills some of the nuances of this beer."
"Pours a dark gold color with a tremendous head that never seems to settle. The smell is very pleasant and almost sweet like a Belgian trippel with the wheat really coming out. The first taste is much different than the ones that follow and there is a lot of layers to it. It starts out with some candied fruits or other sweet additives (presumably the hops), and leaves a satisfying citrus in your mouth after it is finished. The mouthfeel is good as soon as you are able to get through all the foam and really get into the beer. This is pretty light, but still good for anytime of year."
"This delicious brew will be a staple of my collection!"
"Overall still very drinkable but not as good overall as my last on-tap sample. I will surely still buy this, but wish I could have my own little stash of it on-tap in my house."
"The mouthfeel is a bit light. Sessionable if the tartness doesn't get to you."
"Second glassfull paired well with some asiago cheese."
"(no, I'm not an employee or stockholder in the brewery)"
"Drinkability- Probably the best saison I have encountered from the USA. Still no Fantome, but it's not that far off. Excellent!!"
"This is a great beer. This could turn out to be the highlight of my recent beer trip to northern Idaho. I really hope this shows up in Huckleberry's soon, though I wouldn't call 40 miles too far to go to get this."
"750 mL, bottle conditioned, corked and caged - served slightly chilled in a goblet. Looks amazing - 3 finger head that is so close to white and pokes out the top of the glass. It is rocky and sticky, leaving big clumps of foam for lace. The body is a hazy orange/amber with a buncha stuff floating around. Aroma is outdoorsy with grapes, white wine, lemons, some tropical fruits, and a big spiciness. It is sharp and spicy on the palate with yeast, lemons, wine, and is kinda dry. It has a very distinct taste that lingers and makes you want more. Smooth and warming with a full body and makes you really burpy. In a class all it's own."
"This is a world class brew. I had no idea what I was missing out on. Whenever I see a bottle of Hennpin, I'm gonna be picking it up."
"Fills my glass cloudy and pale gold in hue, topped by an intimidating white head. Strong aroma involving fruits, bready pale malts, yeast, a little spice, and some citrous hops. Taste is bold and complex. Bready malt jumps out quickly, before bitter lemons and citrous rinds attack the tongue. Some caramel-like sweetness dances with spice, but there is an underlying creaminess. Mouthfeel is pretty full, but crisp carbonation and the zesty hops really blast inside the mouth. Finishes just like it begins, but leaving a very enjoyable long lasting aftertaste with some fruity yeasty character to it. Overall a bitter impression is left on my palate."
"The taste is wonderful. Sweet honey hits first, which quickly makes way for vanilla, citrus and a slight banana. The sour fruit taste is dominant, backed up by a slight hint of spice and coriander. Hop hit is noticeable, especially in the aftertaste, but it does not take over. Alcohol warming is moderate. The beer is aggressively effervescent and medium-bodied."
"Served out of a 750 ml bottle into a Duvel glass. Beutiful hazy golden color with a thick off-white head. Smell is delicious --- sweet, fruity, banana bread, yeasty, and even a little peppery. Spices hit up front giving way to a fruity finish--orange mainly but a little lemon and banana too. Mouthfeel is amazing--thick and full bodied, it almost taste like your chewing bread. This is one hell of a beer. Most Belgian styles are a little too intensely spiced for me and not that drinkable--but this one has just the right balance and I could have it all night."
"Not a beer I would drink everyday for the $$, but that being said this was a great beer. Honey gold straw with a white head that became spotty. A hoppy fruity nose of citrus and yeast. Distinct Belgian yeast taste followed by a creamy citrus softness lined with noble hops. Quite a mouthful and deceptive with the high alcohol content."
"I had this once a long time ago, before my days of Beer Advocacy, and since then I have overlooked it. I'm excited to try it once again. Appears a very light orange color, almost yellow. Crystal clear... I mean I don't think I've ever seen a beer this clear. Rising bubbles and big white fluffy head that lasts and lasts. Smell is yeasty, bready, zesty, spicy, and dusty. Unfortunately, it's not as dusty and funky in the taste. Not quite a true Belgian in that sense, but it is very good, don't get me wrong. I've recently become obsessed with the best Belgian pale ales, De Ranke XX and Orval specifically. I love that dry, hoppy, grassy taste. I've been searching for a cheaper alternative that is equally satisfying and refreshing, and this is a close one. The taste is nice and hoppy, decently bitter, and with a nice soft buttery malt taste. The dusty taste I like is noticable too, a definate plus. Really smooth mouthfeel and this beer is highly refreshing, which makes it highly quaffable. Really a good beer. Really. I don't know what it is, but there's something about those beers from Belgium that are just indescribable that can't be found elsewhere. This beer is not to be faulted though for not having that quality however. An awesome beer from Cooperstown."
"What a friggin' great beer."
"What a phenomenal introduction to the saison. After not working well with Rare Vos, Hennepin has bumped up my already solid praise for Ommegang. The body and the finish would lead well into some grilled chicken or maybe shrimp."
"This beer tastes very much like a witbier. Don't know what thats about. Fruity citrus base with some grassiness. A tart sour-like finish. Even though this is a siason, I think it's a little too tart for the style. Big citrus sour aftertaste kind of ruins the complexity of this beer IMO. Finished clean and semi-dry. Not the greatest siason as many BA's have proclaimed it is. Southampton's is much better."
"Note - I've tried a couple of Belgian style beers in the past and never been impressed... this has changed my opinion. This may be my favorite beer to date. If you try this beer do yourself a favor and pick up more than one."
"Slàinte!"
"This is not my type of beer, but when I saw it and had read so many positive reviews I decided to give it a try. Comes packaged in a beautiful bottle with champagne style capping. Pours tremendously cloudy with very unsubtle sunset colors. The suggested serving glass call for a wide-mouth glass, (I used a red wine glass) upon pouring a swelling of orange, berries and some serious alcohol infused my nostrils. This beer taste like a summer beer, overloaded with sweetly hops that balance each other. This beer almost transcends beer at its strangest and purest points. A serious beer, but is it really a beer; or should it be in its own category?"
"Didn't quite know what to expect, as I've never had a saison, but this seemed to be rated pretty high. I'm glad I picked it up, along with a 750 of Ommegang. Pours a pale golden color with a constant source of fizz. The HUGE billowy foam cap seems to grow even after the pour is done. Smells fantastic, very spicey, but otherwise difficult to place. Tastes spicey as well, with a hint of a hop bite in the end. Taste seems to morph as the drinker becomes acclimatized and the beer warms. Seems to have a buttery banana ester quality at some point that fades into a funky belgian yeasty clove flavor. I will definitely try other saisons."
"Drinkbaility and Overall: Excellent. This is Ommegang's best of what I've had. Excellent. I'm really impressed, and I can't wait to get more. Try it."
"Chill hazed golden body with a big, frothy white head. Smells of caramel apples, yeasty bread, sweet malts and fruity esters. Very complex aroma and flavor. Taste consists of caramel and candy sweetness, overripe pears, winelike sour grapes, and a well blended warming alcoholic finish. Medium body and semi-dry finish make it highly drinkable."
" Very nice taste goes well with a good meal!!"
"Mouthfeel: Firm, effervescent body (lots of carbonation)."
"Initial ½-inch down of cream head that thins on its own schedule. Flowery/floury permissiveness on nose with coriander, sweet clover honey, and Kentucky blue grass all chortling around in there; as it warms, alcohol provides some heat. Biting pepper, lemon juice, chewy grape leaf hint, Hi-C fruit punch sweetness follows behind all of this with a finishing overall Sourpatch Kid puckering. Could take it or leave it; the sour aspect is just a bit off-putting."
"750 ml bottle. Pours a cloudy golden color. Thick creamy white fluffy head that held its own for the enitre beer. Small spots of lace on the sides of the glass. Citrusy notes, along with spices, and some funky smells. Tart and sour flavors combine with ripe pears and apples. Spices thrown in, along with some earthy flavors. Good amount of peppery earthy hops at the end. Very refreshing. The complexity works so well in this beer. This would be great in warm weather, or cold. High carbonation, great drinkability despite all of the complex flavors. Excellent saison."
"Taste: Yeasty with an interesting alcohol finish which gives it sort of a lactic and creamy feel with just a bit of funk, which reminds me of a Camenbert cheeze. Nice!"
"Wow, I really dig this one, it's a tart and spicy masterpiece."
"Bottle conditioned saison from New York. Hmm... let's give it a go. It pours a pale clear yellow (almost looks like a pale ale/Macro Lager). Not much head on this. Moderate lacing. Smells slightly funky, like outdoors in the spring. Taste is slightly metallic, and slightly sour at the same time. A hint of grassy hops in there as well. Overcarbonated in my book. Not a hit. Not something I'd look for again."
"Ommegang's best offering in my opinion!"
"The taste is lightly sweet up front through the middle, but then becomes quite dry in the finish. This is nice and spicy with competing notes of pepper, ginger, lemon zest, coriander. This beer has a nice soft sweet grain character which mixes quite well with, and in fact even accentuates, the refreshing, cool citrus notes. This beer is very good, it is just about the perfect beer to sit down and enjoy over an evening. The one flaw is that it is perhaps a little to thick in the body, don't get me wrong, it is by no means thick, it is just that I like my farmhouse ales with a nice dry, light palate. I had forgotton how tasty this beer was, and at $3.00 for a 750ml it is a steal."
"Pours a slightly hazy medium gold with a good 2 finger head, great retention and great lace. Excellent smell - yeasty with some hits of banana and sweet malt (both barley and wheat), some slight hop floralness. Complex but not overpowering. Outstanding taste. Somewhat tart and yeasty with nicely balanced hops. Some banana and clove notes as well. Finishes dry. Crisp and refreshing. An excellent example of the style and well worth the $4.99 I paid for the 750ml. An excellent value."
"This beer poured a hazy gold with a thick, rich white head, that settled to a complex lace in the tulip glass I used. The nose has a yeasty/doughy character up front with bright grapefruit from the hops and a mild candy character from the malt. Very layered and complex. The taste has an awakening tartness followed by a mild bitterness. The play between the sweetness and tartness is very pronounced. Light and slick mouth feel leads to a very drinkable beer. This New York brewery is producing a fine version of the Saison style."
"Still new to style, I have studied Jan/Feb Zymurgy for some details. It is sweetness kept in check with the hops, herbs( coriander) and spices(ginger & orange zest). This ""Grisette"" farmhouse ale really has a earthiness to it. Very unique taste. But very drinkable. This is a light-medium bodied brew. Very good long dry finish. Wish I was sharing it with an expert on the style."
"A slightly hazy pale golden body supports a towering, rocky, cotton white head. Muy nice. Nose is very floral and intoxicating. I'm also picking up banana-ish esters, pepper, candyish fruit malts, and yeast. Yum. Spicy, almost-bitter floral hops up front, that are accenuated with a lively carbonated spritzy feel. Rounds into a yeast-accented malt tang, with the bitterness remaining. Estery fruits and light candy sweetness swell into the finish, which is long, and strong with both sweet fruits/yeast and floral bitterness. Surprisingly full-bodied ale that has just the right amount of carbonation. One of the best US-made Belgian ales I've had."
"Had this brew the other night, from a 750 ml bottle. The brew poured to a cloudy golden color with a thick frothy, foamy head that had incredible retention and left chunky lacing through out. The carbonation is very active with a good deal of small (reminds me of champagne) bubbles coursing up the side. This is a very inviting looking beer; something about it just says it looks perfect! The aromas have a pronounced Belgian scent to it from the yeast I would presume (?), very earthy. Scene highlights of pepper, grapes, citrus like hop qualities, and a sweet aroma. Very drinkable brew; somewhat sweet with a fruit (citrus) like taste ending with a balanced hop ness. This is a very nice brew, over all it is highly drinkable and very refreshing."
"Ahh, near perfection in my glass... this is just one of those beers that you can drink all night long and never be bored by. Crisp and light, mild fruit (pears and apples) with subtle spice, clean and smooth. Very nice carbonation as well... not overly carbonated, but just enough to be refreshing. No odd flavors, nothing to make you go ""wow!"" or ""huh?", just an extremely well crafted beer that reminds you that great beer doesn't have to be anything extreme (not that there's anything wrong with extreme beers, and I enjoy my fair share, but Hennepin proves that simple and well-balanced doesn't have to mean boring)."
"Flavor is light and fruity with some apples and pears just like the nose. A bit of genearl tart fruitiness too. I also get some candy sugar that I find a bit too sweet and slightly unappealing. The flavor of the beer reminds me of champagne just like the appearance did. The beer finishes with some dryness, again champagneesque. OVerall the beer is okay, but if I wanted to drink champagne I would buy a bottle. Probably wont try this one again."
"Light to medium bodied. Pair this with Szechuan Style Chinese, Thai or Indian food."
"Poured a light golden honey color with a foamy white head that took quite a while to fall. It had a yeasty scent, with some citrus fruits hiding in there as well. The taste was initially sweet, with some bitterness at the end. Exceptoinal taste, it was balanced almost prefectly with some grassy and citrus undertones. The mouthfeel was light, crisp, and nicely carbonated. This is a very drinkable beer. I will be getting some more of these sometime in the near future."
"Pours an ever so slightly cloudy raspberry-tinted gold under a one finger white head that sticks around for a while, particularly after settling to thick film, leaving a few good strands of lace. The nose is full of fruit and malt, with a touch of sweetness reminiscent of good Belgian ales. The mouth is light and very, very prickly. Good smooth if not overpowering taste, with sweet fruit and spices up front, carried by a malt backbone. The finish includes some dry currant bitterness and more bready malt, which rises to dominate the aftertaste. Solid product, no doubt, even if not my favorite style of beer."
"This was a refreshing beer that would work well alone or with food. My spouse had just baked some Brie and she loved the pairing. This is one addictive brew. This came from Ommegang's 3-pack which included 750s of Three Philosophers and Rare Vos. I'm traveling this week, so I'll be breaking those out next weekend."
"A fine beer, I wish I hadn't waited so long to try it."
"A kick-ass, highly drinkable, relatively affordable domestic saison. We need more beers like this."
"Pours from the 750 ml. bottle a hazy orange. It's very murky even after a careful pour, identifying the beer as bottle conditioned in case you can't read the label. A large white head rushes to fill the space in my tulip glass. The head recedes leaving a rocky terrain of foam with lacing down the sides of the glass. The first aroma is a wet musty closet...very interesting. There's some fruitiness in the background, but it is kept at bay by the musty funk. The taste is wet blanket (cliche, I know, but still true), with oranges and apples mushed in. As the beer sits on the tongue and sails into the finish, a pronounced hop bitterness appears. Finishes fairly dry and is very drinkable. This is a great tasting beer, one I will buy often. A great example of a Saison that hold up very well when compared to Saison Dupont (the flagship of the style IMO). At $4.99 for a 750 ml., it's really a no brainer!"
"Nice Saison which is hard to believe it came from the US and not Belgium. Very citrus and orange flavor ale. The carbonation is very good-not too much or little, with a finger size foam lace at the top of a goblet. The mouthfeel is good with very slowly disapating foam. Very easy to drink but has a little alcohol kick to it. You can feel it as you drink (7% ABV) but you really feel it as it hits your head. Some beers have a delayed alcohol reaction-not this one. Don't drink on an empty stomach. This is a great beer to share with friends! My wife even liked it!"
"However, I still think this a good, solid brew that I would enjoy having again."
"I was happy to track down bottle # 1127 from the 2003 vintage at American Bev. in Cobble hill, Brooklyn, NY., Just a week or two ago. The cork was a bit tougher to get out then usual. Pours a cloudy orange/yellow shade, lots of tiny yeast particles floating around. Head was fairly active, but settled to a fine film, and leaves respectable, fine, long strands of lacing. Nose is at once Smokey,spicy, with pepper,cloves, and ginger picked up. This is a fine example of the style. Earthy, peppery, fruits,smoke,yeast. Hops cleansing the tongue and making it want more of this fine heady creation. Support Ommegang, they are pushing the Belgian/American brew concept into great places."
"To quote the bros: ""One of our favourites, bring a couple of 750 ml bottles to the dinner party and see if this sparks anyones interest away from wine"" It worked. I brought 3 bottles to Christmas dinner and only had 2 glasses for myself. Beautiful white head that lasted forever. My brother-in-law noted it looked like an ice cream float. He put down his drink and had several glasses with dinner which is where this beer really shines in my opinion. It was a perfect match for the stuffed ribs and garlic mashed."
"Pours a beautiful rapunzel like golden color with a massive rocky white head. Aromas are yeasty and citrusy with just a hint of lemon in the mix. Initial flavors start off sweet and spicy with a champagne like mouthfeel from the firm carbonation. The flavors progress to a lemony like citrus flavor with yet more spice and a slight alcohol kick to it. The finish to this brew is just as spritzy as the beginning with an almost clove like finish. Overall a fantastic brew with probably the best price around."
"In typical saison style this beer smells very grassy and farmish. It is exceptionally well balanced and hides its substantial alcohol very well. The aroma is a grassy banana and the taste complements with rolling mellow flavors. In my opinion, the mouthfeel of the Hennepin makes the entire experience. The beer is perfectly carbonated and delivers the perfect balance of earthy flavors, yeast, and CO2 to make this a delightful treat that is at home in any season."
"750 ml bottle, corked and bailed. Overall a well made Saison, with a slight bit more complexity this could be a contender, with the price it certainly could be one to have again and again."
" What a great taste. This ale compares more than favorably with Begium brews. I had it back to back with Delirium Tremens and was surprised with Hennepin's well balanced hoppiness and smooth malt character. And at roughly $5 a bottle, it is about the best beer bargain I can think of."
"The cork was very hard to get out, but when it went it went with an audible pop. It pours a golden orange with a huge white head that fades to a 0.5cm coating on the top of the beer. The aroma is floral, spicy (coriander and clove) with strong hints of orange peel. Taste is spicy, slightly sour, hoppy and pergaps a bit of clover honey. Slightly slick mouthfeel, with a warming alcohol finish. Extremely smooth and drinkable, and seems to have mellowed with its time in the cave and the cellar. A great celebratory drink and if you can find the 2001 edition, you'll be happy you did."
"This was my first saison, it is a style I have just never bothered to try. I will be trying more in the future. This is the second Ommegang beer I have had that didnt live up to its hype. But, in this case, Im not sure there is anything necessarily wrong, I just may not know the style well enough. Yet. Will review my scores after I am more knowledgable."
"This certainly lived up to expectations. I'm already looking forward to the next time I get to have one."
"Just had Hennepin on-tap @ The Elephant Walk in Boston, MA. Amazing. The aroma really came out more than before . Very citrusy. It was also dangerously drinkable. Served in a pint glass, but I'll let it slide because it just means I got more bang for my buck. And what a bang it was! (Insert dirty response here)."
"The drinkability is good, the after taste does not linger and dissipates in time."
"For such a weird mix of likes and dislikes, it's quite light and goes down way too easy."
"Overall Impression: Easy drinking Belgian! Light in style, simple and direct, but a nice flavor. A very approachable Saison, I could see this with fish or a light meal. A good summer quencher but a bit alcoholic for a session; highly recommended."
"This bottle was far better than the bottle of Saisson Dupont I sampled last month..."
"The beer came in a 12 oz. brown bottle with lots of useful information (like how to pour this beer, and what kind of glass to use) and some trivia (like origins of the name, and some tidbits about Belgian culture). When poured in my trusty goblet, the beer looked marvelous with clear, pale golden body, and an outrageously sized head that tried my patience as I could only get half of the bottle into the 16 oz. glass. As the head died down, there was tons of lace left behind. The smell was delicately floral, spicy, earthy, and fruity, with bananas, saffron, pepper, and horse blanket evident. The taste was tart and sweet, with flavors of lemon, banana, beet sugar, orange peel, and radishes. The aftertaste was spicy and semi-dry, and left me longing for more. Thin and delicate mouthfeel is a bit dusty. This beer has very good drinkability and offers a good value for the money. I will be sampling more beers from them again."
"A slightly hazey golden yellow ale with a big spoonable white head. Has a spicey hop aroma with a herbal aspect in the background. The spicey hop presence starts out the taste assertively. The finish has a lightly sweet herb garden floralness to it. The mouth feel is smooth and inviting."
"Cloudy, hazy, golden/straw/orange-leaning color. Thick, fine-bubbled, patchy head. Smells flowery, tastes fruity, citrus scent. Mango, banana, grapefruit, lemon, tart, sweetish. Light and lively in my mouth, and scent of esthers becomes very strong when imbibing. Aftertaste is like the scent, begs a second drink. Saccharine if left without a swig too long, but absolutely divine when I am drinking. Just at the edge of my palate skills at identifying tastes, it is extremely fun and interesting. Brilliant and exciting."
"Poured from a 750 ml bottle. It has a clean orange color with a lacy head. The aroma is grassy and sweet. The flavor has notes of apple, cinnamon, and white cranberrry sweetness. That maltiness is light but a good base for the complex fruity flavors. In the mouth this beer feels suple and soft and very easy to drink."
"A tasty, high quality brew. Very nice."
"I was much more impressed with this beer the second time around. I boosted my ratings accordingly."
"Drinkability: Are you kiddin me??? FANTASTIC!!! One of the best beers I've tried! fugeddaboutit!!!!"
"Very tasty and enjoyable beer. Excellent drinkability at 7.5 % ABV. Ommegang nails every Belgian influenced style beer that I've had. Check this beer out....recommended."
"Note: 12 oz. bottle. Pours with a rich pillow of snow-white head with a bead as tight as shaving cream. A swirl of the goblet sends the foam into a little galactic spiral. Lazy cling, o.k. lacing. Beer is peach chrome in color with honey-colored highlights and enough yeast haze to make the carbonation just barely visible. Smells involve peach pie filling, cinnamon sugar cookies, beeswax and clover. A twist of saffron and the perfume of shredded violets round out a cool, floral, humid nosefeel. Fresh ginger flavors dominate over the sweetness of ladyfingers in the front palate. Must, straw, and alcohol are incorporated into perfectly level transitions between fruit and spice before ending with a well-hopped, bitter finish of fruit pits that sticks the tongue to the roof of the mouth. Burps of red delicious apple appear by the time I'm reaching for my second bottle. Mouthfeel is lightly viscous with a calciferous, magazine-paper slickness and a sharp, tingling POW! of carbonation high on the tongue. At room temperature, drinkability soars... knocking off a 750 should be a piece of cake. This is like drinking a summer picnic out of a glass."
"I'm a sucker for saisons, and this is an excellent one."
"While it is a quality brew I just wasn't overwhelmed with this offering. Maybe a style I am not quite keen on. Sorry, Bros."
"pours a nice cloudy golden colour with bubbles rising to a fluffy white head which lasts and lasts. the smell is a nice mix of fruit berries, a touch of alcohol and spice. there is somewhat of a white wine odor here, but not as sharp. the flavour was unexpectedly good. everythign mentioned above is mixed in throughout and hits the palate just right: with a smooth, fruity dryness. the finish is sweet and a bit tart. yeast is evident throughout as well and adds that much more to this tasty brew. it is wonderfully easy to drink and spot on with its carbonation level. i didn;t expect to enjoy this one as much as i did (though i don't know why). easily recommended."
"Drinkability is great, although I may want to space it out a little more next time as I may have finished the last 2 glasses a little quick. Ommegang has a winner with this one, as if that isn't already evident."
"75 cl cork and caged bottle. Pours a bright yellow-orange with a big, fluffy white head. Honey sweet malt notes, some red licorice candy-like sweetness with a citrusy, peppery, and botanical (heather and lemongrass) nose. Initially sweet and floral, like an orange blossom, and then moving towards a more bitter, hoppy finish while still maintaining a general sweetness, overall. Good carbonation. Very complex, in aroma and taste. I'd love to get my hands on a cave-aged version, because this beer is rather sweet, and some extended cellaring would do this beer nicely."
"Again, I highly recommend that food pairing."
"Bottled . Not a huge fan of this brewer so far. Yeasty choc/caramel, pretty sweet and a little bit syruppy to be honest, a very flat mouthfeel, with not much interesting happening, definitely on the sweeter side of the scale, i've yet to be won over by this brewer, but this isn't a bad beer though."
"Drinkability: Great balanced flavor makes this one very drinkable. Another masterpiece from Ommegang."
"I purchased this 12 ounce bottle at the North Coast Co-op in Arcata, California, and I will try it again."
"Pours a light golden colour with a massive white yead that laces beautifully. Smell is of citrus and and spice with a bit of cidery tartness. The flavour is wonderfull with Just enough malt to balance the funky cider, citrus, spice notes. Mouthfeel is great with a nice carbonation that leaves the palate refreshed instead dulled. Drinkability-- Please sir may I have another. A really really nice beer and one that I will seek out again."
"Very nice, smooth, drinkable beer. I've never had a Saison before, so I don't know if this is characteristic of the style or not. I'd been told by people before that the Hennepin was favored over the Ommegang, and I definitelly echo their sentiments. A very, very good brew."
"This is a golden colored brew that poured a nice head. Nose was light fruit. Taste was heavily malty with a nice light hop finish to balance it out. Mouthfeel was nice and lively because of the amount of carbonation in this bottle conditioned brew. Overall, this is a well balanced beer that masks the high ABV very well."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. Mine went down about as quick as a good lager. The sweetness might be too much after a few, but by then, the 7.5 ABV should be slowing you down anyway (or perhaps barking at the moon)"
"Overall I would term this beer shocking. The appearance and smells really offer no hint to the treat that is hidden in the flavour and mouth. A pleasure, I'll certainly be having it again."
"A top notch saison. Exactly what you would expect from Ommegang. This is one to enjoy and recommend to a friend."
"The nice orangy color and nice thick white head were promising and the smell was nice an yeasty like you would expect from a belgian brew, and then the taste was very smooth at first and then moves to a well rounded sweetness that can only be described as mana from the beer gods. This was very drinkable and I really enjoyed hanging onto the lovely aftertaste of this brew. One of my new favorites."
"Impressive... I actually thought it was a true Belgian until I read the label more carefully. Poured smoothly out of a 750ml colorfully-labelled bottle into a tulip glass. Golden color and thick, almost sticky white head. Bouquet was everything a belgian should be - fruity and rich. Smooth taste, hint of nuttiness, just an incredible brew. It was about 85 degrees last night, and this was the perfect beer for such a warm summer evening. Worth every penny."
"Drinkability: Nigh unto perfection. Righteous!"
"The mouthfeel is medium-full and goes down smooth. A very drinkable beer. To bad is not available here."
"This is a very drinkable beer. I could drink this everyday during the summer. Even though this is made in NY, I think this beer could easily hold it's ground against some of the best Belgian ales of this style."
"This beer definitely has some kick to it, but it rewards with a very mellow, almost banana like aftertaste. Very yummy. Unlike other high alcohol brews, this one goes down smooth. If you can find this gem available in your area, I'd suggest that you try it."
"Ive always felt that saison beers were more of a late summer/fall beer. That spicy mix is usually for the cooler weather. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that Hennepin worked well in the sun and the warmth. That creamy smoothness is very enjoyable, even when sampled in-between innings."
"hennepin pours a cloudy honey color with a huge cloudlike head that is an off white. lacing is heavy. smell is white grapes, ginger and citrus (orange peel?). flavor is complex, dry with a light alcohol note. can taste something fruit-like but can't put my finger on it....i'm new to the style. a terrific beer though can really taste ginger and corriander. spicey. mouthfeel is almost fuzzy with plenty of carbonation. could drink a couple but definatly not a session beer. i ain't no rockafella. $9.00 a bottle but worth it. definatly happy that i bought this brew."
"The well-carbonated brew comes off creamy, especially because of that soft head. A 750ml goes down so incredibly smooth, I could drink another 750 if I didn't know better. In my opinion this is a beer approaching perfection, and it's amazing to think it's brewed in the US. There's no way to even guess this isn't a traditional Saison from Belgium, and it would rank near the top of any beers in the category, no matter the geography."
"I wanted to believe that the extra few bucks I spent on a cave aged beer would be worth it. Truth be told, although subtle, there is a difference. Smell is a little more pronounced, though has the same characteristic orange smell. Taste is outstanding. Extremely smooth, with a slight hoppy taste and lots of spice, orange and citrus. Unbelievably smooth for its ABV, this beer distinguishes itself as one of the best Belgian beers in America, and would put up a impressive fight in a Belgium itself. This beer kicks ass, and Im proud to say it."
"Dortmunder Gold in color, very clear, big head, great retention and lacing but a bit soap-sudsy with big bubbles. Aroma is very faint and of spicy pickles. Flavor is very polished - fruit esters are banana and cherry with huge carbonation that annoys me. Verrry drrry. Malt is non-existant, could be all sugar for all I can tell. This beer is just fizz on the tongue and then leaves a little flavor there that is esters and spice. Not as much ginger as I remember. Struck me as Unibrouish and triplish, but not worthy of either really. This is a well-made effervescent creation, but fails to inspire me."
"It looks, smells, and tastes really nice. This is one tasty beer. It has a lot in common with my favorite Belgian strong pale ales, but with a different kick in the taste."
"Hennepin is my first saison so I really have no idea whether it's a good version of the style or not. For all I know it could be great beer. My suspicion is that this bottle is a little on the old side, so I'll re-review when I get the chance."
"Pours a cloudy yellowish with a perfectly white head. Aroma of citrus & spice. All kinds of flavors competing for attention - earthy hops, spice, belgian yeasts, & mildly sour lemon. They all mesh well together in this heavily carbonated brew that finishes with fruity orange, a bit of yeast, & a flavor that reminds me of wheat. Extremely drinkable & an absolute steal for the price."
"An admirable expression of the style. Not a bad substitute for Chimay, particularly when you're light on funds (the Hennepin bottle was a full $3 cheaper than the least expensive Chimay). I'll come back to this one."
"Now, THIS is a summer brew. Full, complex, satisfying, yet still wonderfully refreshing. A perfect example of the style, really couldn't be much better."
"I make no apologies for admitting that I am a big fan of Brouwerij Ommegangs offerings, they still represent probably the best value for money widely available, high quality Belgian style US brews around for me. I am not sure what I did to deserve this beautiful, and rather prized, rare bottle as a gift - but a very BIG heartfelt Thank You indeed to djgonzalez and RokotGirl for sparing this gift from their stash during a recent trip to NYC. It was much appreciated and highly enjoyed. Ill have to get to NYC more often - the first beer in the Blind Tiger is on me next time!!!"
"Just an overall great OMMEGANG beer. Extremely enjoyable on all counts. Thanks to shapudding for the offering. I need to get my hands on my own bottle."
"I was fortunate to visit the brewery last fall and pick up a few bottles of this beauty. It is a hazy, pale golden with a voluminous creamy head. The aroma is yeasty (bready) and hoppy. It is creamy with citrus and earthy character and a bitter dry finish. Mellow and amazingly refreshing."
"Consider this one a very nice belgian with lots of great flavor here. Not overly sweet or carbinated. Enjoyed this one."
"I wanted the big Lance Berkman home run from this one, and it delivered a shot over the wall. It wasn't an upper-deck bomb, but it was respectable and solid. Good job from the Ommegang Brewery in Cooperstown. The Baseball Hall of Fame is there, check it out, and check out this fine beer as well."
"Mouthfeel is fairly light, just about a medium body. Good servings of small bubbly carbonation. Easy going down the hatch; simple body and flavor---simply delicious."
"Not as much carbonation as the fresh version, buts still a constant stream of bubbles. Big fat brilliant white head that leaves a thick coat of lace, but doesn't hold as well as the fresh version. The color seems a bit lighter, more of a golden straw color. Earthy doughy aroma with a bit of mild coriander and light lemon. Nice light fluffy mouthfeel on a lighter bodied beer. I don't know if it's the second glass of Hennepin but I'm noticing the warm stomach effect. A bit more flavor in this one, pale malt (or strong wheat beer) not noticing the spices or lemon, just slightly more bitter. The alcohol is more noticable and the flavor is a bit stronger cutting back on the drinkability. Overall a solid brew, but not as light and fresh as the month old version which I actually prefer in a Saison."
"rich malty nose,with a slight belgian nose,slightly phenolic. deep reddish brown,nice lace, thick head. Slightly metallic, but rich malt with a nice lingering finish that drys out nicely, well balanced, hops are well underlining, and blends nicely with the malts."
"Overall: A perfect example of a Belgian Saison - very refreshing and oh so drinkable. I could drink this day-in and day-out and not get sick of it. Thumbs up to Ommegang for this beautiful, beautiful brew."
"A fresher bottle has less medicinal taste, brighter pepper and more fermented funk. I'm upping the taste to a 4 from 3.5. And at $4.59 for 750 mL, this and all Ommegang products are a victory for the beer lover on a budget."
"This brew pours out with a familiar orange tinted gold colour, and a large, rocky head of white foam. This brew was slightly cloudy, yet still very attractive in my chalice. The singature fruity aromas were even more complex, in this sample, and the spicy/herbal hops were definately much more pronounced as well. This brew has a nice bready middle, and an everlasting spicy hop finish. The flavors melded together very well, making for an exceptionally smooth drink, that drained from my glass too quickly. If you like Ommegangs products, you owe it to yourself to try the cave-aged stuff...it's all really quite good."
"The carbonation in this beer makes for a very interesting and pleasent mouthfeel. This is another stellar brew from Ommegang. I will definitely have this one again."
"Hazy golden hue wearing a thin white head. A very vinous nose with more alcohol than expected. Quite fruity overall with grapes, lemon/citrus, but it could use a bit more spices to my liking. Saison-ish hay character is very well defined though and appealing. Lots of warming alcohol in mouth also, a solid hay field accompany typical cereals. Mildly acid with more lemon, yeasty with a dry bitter finish. The body is highly carbonated, a bit too much for my tastes with this particular flavor profile, it's smooth and big enough to support the warming effect nevertheless. I must say I expected more from one of the rare american Saison, the obvious alcohol at this moderately low ABV just doesn't allow for the quaffable yet feeding beverage I expect."
"Nice golden coloration with a lofty white head. Smell of light tropical fruits, lemon and dry yeast. Crisp lemon flavors and distinct tastes of apple peel. Esters floating on the palate and a good shot of hop bitterness on the finish. Great Belgian yeast flavors. Another amazing beer from Ommegang."
"I detected a plastic taste in earlier batches, but that is gone now. I enjoy this beer even if Hennepin County in MN is giving me headaches."
"What a great looking beer, with the taste to match. I love the color of this beer. It falls between a sparkling yellow to gold. Pours with a nice foamy white head that simmers down just enough to cover the beer. Smell includes every fruit in the holiday fruit basket...fresh pears and definitely a strong citrus aroma. One of the first Belgians I have had, so the taste was definitely a mystery when the first drop hit my lips. Smooth taste with a sweet aftertaste that is in no way dissatisfying. When I let my girlfriend try it, she thought she was drinking a champagne or sparkling wine. The carbonation is odd, but somewhat refreshing. Definitely a beer that I could have a couple of if it was in the budget."
"I'm with Todd, one of these in a night would not be enough."
"Taking the cage off and running my finger over the cork was enough to send said cork halfway across the room causing my friend to dump half of a storm king onto his lap. Wow, I like this beer already. It pours a cloudy orange color with a billowing fluffy white head. There is definitely a fruity/spicy smell to it. Taste is spicy, hoppy, and fruity all rolled into one. Mouthfeel is decent, consistent to many other caged and corked Belgians I've had. A great beer from a great brewery."
"Super drinkable, this is very similar to Duvel. Super pleasant to drink. Think of this as the Batman that opposes the Duvel Joker."
"I had this 3.5 years later on tap, at Cole's,and observed lacey and dry bitter and spicey."
"Overall not a bad beer but not my top choice."
"I admit that I am not all that familiar with this style though I have enjoyed Brewery Ommegang's several other worthy offerings. This pours a clear light golden color (I got the first pour out of the large bottle--the later pours got a bit of the typical cloudiness of a bottle fermented brew). There is a large white head, and the effervescence is evident right from the outset. The head receded slowly, and the lacing is tenacious but not sticky. The aroma is tart, dominated by citrus and ginger with an underlying wheat maltiness. The taste, I'm afraid, was initially a bit too rubbery for my palate, letting the alcohol reign for a moment or two, but as it moved to a finish the aforementioned aromas insinuated nicely themselves into the mix. The mouthfeel is thin to medium with lots of carbonation."
"Ive had this beer several times and I finally found out that I havent reviewed it yet, so here goes. The beer pours with huge frothy head, which seems to have a certain rigidity to itself, retaining a tall lofty shape in the middle, even as it dies down around the sides. The lace patches up nicely along the glass. Bubbles float aimlessly from the bottom. The smell is wonderful, with immediately recognizable hints of the heavy wheatiness of the beer, a ton of spices, a hint of lemon and an overall yeasiness that makes me think of bread dough. There is bit of hoppiness evident, and touch of straight alcohol is also present. For lack of a better term, it smells very thick in the nose. The taste follows right along with the smell. It is very warming and thick, with the wheatiness of a weisse beer, showing a strong yeast character again, with the alcohol definatley tastable. The exact characteristics of the spiciness escape me, but its a heavy part of the taste. Mouthfeel is a light syrupy viscosity, with tons of tiny carbonation filling the mouth. Drinking this gives me a nice warm feeling. A nice throw back to the past, as this was one of the first ""real"" beers I ever had."
"Hennepin was served from a 12. oz bottle. In a Duvel tulip, the beer was murky and straw colored, with a fine head that left fascinating tendrils of lacing. Very attractive. The nose was quite wonderful, with a zippy lemony acidity garnished with coriander, a rough orangy mustiness, and a touch of sweetness. The taste began with a lemony citric tinged sweetish malt base that developed accents of mandarin orange. The beer finished amazingly with an energetic smack of bitterness followed by ever lingering lemon-lime-orange notes...I loved this. However, I felt that the beer was a bit too sweet and not crisp/dry enough for a saison. For this reason I had to deduct a half-point, but I must stress that this was the only negative. The beer had the appropriate vigorous carbonation, and the body was full and smooth."
"this is a real crowd pleaser. all the complexity of the big belgians is here. a great blonde beer. i highly recommend it."
"The drier components vying with the subdued sweetness leads to a refreshing union of both. Each element works in proportions that seem something other than the usual. The result is a stylish marriage of common qualities, a unique result indeed. The ABV is credible and overt, but exists in a friendly symbiosis with the beer's overall goodness, making it drinkable in sensible quantities. Now that I've had this, I'll certainly find the time to have another as soon as the mood strikes me."
"Purchased in a 750ml cork and caged bottle, this brew was served in a flute. Amble bright white foam crowned a bright golden beer. It's aroma hinted of fruits and yeast. The flavors offered more complex spicy and fruit flavors balancing sweet caramel malts. This beer was neither heavy, nor thin but had definite presence in the mouth. It was a delightful companion to a meal of cheese-bread and soup."
"The first pour is a clear, glowing deep golden amber. The second pour turns cloudy and darker. The head is massive and stiff. It fades slowly and leaves a thick sheet on the sides of the glass. Beautiful beer. Orange and cloves on the aroma. Very bright and happy. The taste is also very bright and spicy. Fruity esters meld nicely with the orange flavor and a nice straw and caramel malt. A slight bitterness lingers in the finish. Excellent."
"Inexpensive and impressive, Ommegang is becoming a favorite of mine."
"I was surprised by the clarity of this bottle conditioned ale. (taking a sip) I was a little nervous about trying this because I am not a fan of the Ommegang. But I was pleasantly surprised by this. (sipping) A beautiful amber with lots of tiny bubbles. The head was a wonderful thick frothy white. The nose was a little harsh but that is do to the Belgian yeast. I am a hop lover. (sip and gulp) But the taste cuts through the nose and washes everything down with a clean and crisp mouth."
"Normally these are qualities that I like in a beer, but it doesn't sork for me in the Hennepin."
"Char"
"Wow, This brew could not be guessed it comes from Copperstown, N.Y. It pours a nice hazy gold with a higher carbonated (some fizz) head. The head is white that settles to a thin,close bubbled film that dose lace though it fades also. The aroma is lemon citrus. As with the taste the citrus comes through in a lemon pepper on wheat. Also a honey sweet spice lingers a dry mouthfeel. Alcohol at 7.5% hits home strong while allowing this brew to be very drinkable."
"Beautiful yellow coloring with a nice, lasting white head. Active carbonation lends an ongoing bubble-show in the glass. Sweet floral aroma complements nicely the rich mouthfeel and taste that starts sweet and ends dry. To tell the truth, it reminds me of champagne, particularly in how the effervescence feels on the palate (not just because of the corked bottle ;-). Overall, a very enjoyable experience."
"The taste is interesting. Syrupy sweet with a hint of malt and a lot of lemon/grass/pepper up front. Quite a good sized body for a mild beer. Finishes sweet as it began with some nice carbonation tingling on the tounge. Another gem from Ommegang."
"This beer is yummy. It pours with a golden color, with very little head and leaves only a bit of lacing. The aroma is reminiscent of honey, citrus, and that smell I refer to as ""earthy"" (kind of like smelling tree roots). The taste is nice, though a bit ""wheaty"" for me. I can definitely taste the wheat character in the beer. One of the only detractions is a hint of the alcohol comes through, (at 7.5 percent), so it detracts some from the flavor. I know I'll be enjoying more of this in the future."
"Crisp with a medium feel, a pleasure to drink."
"This is a drinkable beer that was a pleasant suprise. If their other beers are similar to the quality of this one, Ommegang will be receiving more of my business."
"Light flavored spicy wheat-beer flavor and banana. Hop spiciness is everywhere, but the hop bitterness is restrained. The tiniest bubbles give this the creamest mouthfeel. I love this stuff. If this were as common as budweiser, I would never ever drink anything else, and likely become an alcoholic."
"This is an amazing domestic Saison. Yards' brewery Saison should take some hints from this. Ommegang puts out a good product. Poured a slightly cloudy gold with a foamy white head. Hints of malt, not bitter at all. A great domestic brew in the Belgian style. I think I'll go get another bottle now."
"I really like this beer but I have to say I think I prefer the Ommegang and Rare Vos over this. Just my opinion."
"The flavors consisted of fruity, tropical flavors like bannana, pomegranade, pears and figs, it had a smooth and easy drinking texture that finished with a nice hop dry feel with some sweetness around the edges, like a nice dessert wine. This was served rather cold from my fridge and as the glass warmed, all of the above aromas and flavors grew until the last sip."
"Slightly hazy, light golden color with a foamy white head that leaves attractive trails of lace down the glass. Excellent head retention, as well. Wonderfully complex aromas of freshly ground ginger, orange peel, maybe some coriander, pepper, fruity esters and slightly earthy hops. More ginger, orange rind, Saaz hops, ripe apple and pear are evident before a mild finish reminiscent of freshly ground pepper. Mouthfeel is smooth, lush and downright pleasing. Drinkability is phenomenal for a beer of 7.5% abv. Though it's not a true saison to the traditionalist due to its alcohol content, it's a damn good beer that is clearly worthy of your attention. One of the better values on the shelves today, too."
"Alas, a good domestic Belgian imitation! It ain't Dupont, but it is a super brew!! Especially at the 4.99 price tag for a 750ml, here in Chicago.The color is right on, featuring blazing orange-the head pours big and frothy and maintains a fine stick. Flavorful and refreshing both, the beer salutes the style nicely. The taste is much like that of a Dupont Saison, with spicy citrus hop and a nice snappy bite. A well balanced, clean, and delicious bang for the buck!! I'll surely save money with this as an option."
"Hennepin takes all the best qualities of a hefeweisen, belgian, and ale... and combines them into a ridiculously drinkable beer. I'm totally in love with this, and rating accordingly. A new favorite; Premier Gourmet will be seeing my quick return to establish a personal stash, at $5 a bomber."
"poured into my duvel glass- didn't realize how appropriate that would be until i tasted it. it appeared slightly more golden in color than duvel, but the taste was pretty close. a little thinner and slightly less peppery, but overall not very different to me. thoroughly enjoyed, but if i'm going for that style i'll go with hennepin's older, more established belgian cousin."
"Flavors included all kinds of fruits, yeast, and spices. Not bad but certainly not what I was expected. Alcohol was well hidden though and it did leave an excellent lace on the glass."
"12oz. bottle: Nice layer of sediment at the bottom: I love bottle conditioned beers. It pours a cloudy golden color. It has a floral nose. Also there of hints of pear and apricots. The taste is full bodied, with undertones of citrus pears and caramel. Very nice!"
"Big thanks to Fishbone for the bottle!"
"Hope this Ommegang is better than the Victory 12 ""Belgian style"" I had earlier this afternoon. Pours a hazy straw yellow color with a nice, though small head. Hoppy aroma with citrus notes tells me that I'm going to like this one better than the syrupy V-12. Indeed, the mouthful is reassuring. Hop notes and carbonation assault the tongue. This is a very visually attractive offering, maintaining a small head and interesting vertical lacing. Taste is dominated by the interesting hops, which are tempered by hints of hay and pears. Dry aftertaste is pleasant. This is a very drinkable ale."
"Update  I re-reviewed this with a 2004 bottle and found it to be very enjoyable. I got a lot more spicing this time around but otherwise it seems pretty consistent."
"These New Yorkers should be made honorary Belgians."
"at $3.99 for a 750ml, its a steal."
"Fine pour!! Nice head and good yellow orange color. Nice tasting beer. Some grapefruit and tart apple in the taste.Very good hop character. One of the hoppier Belgian styles I have had. Good carbonation. Very warm alchohol aftertaste. This is somewhat like Duvel. A high quality beer from an American/Belgian brewery"
"Belgian style ale, but brewed in the states. Hennepin pours a cloudy blonde color with a medium white head laced with carbonation. The taste is light on the hops with clean crisp citrus flavors. The is one of my all time favorites and is hard to believe this is brewed in New York."
"First glass pours a nice deep copper with a billowy white head that quickly recedes. Light to moderate lace. Very fruity scents, including apple. Spices are ginger and coriander. This is a beutifully spiced brew from start to finish. Low peppery image mixed with fruit produces a cidery quality. This beer makes no apology and produces a very bold flavor. The finish is stong with belgian malt and a hint of alcohol. Worth the 3.99 price tag, to be as understating as possible. Second glass gives an entirely different character, as I add all of the yeast. Everytime I buy this beer I wonder why I don't buy it more often."
"Poured a clear light gold color with a thick head that last through the drink. The nose sensed some floral, yeast, and citrus aromas.There was nice carbonation. A nice balance of malt and bitterness, with a crisp yeasty flavor lasting on the tongue. Very smooth and a soft aftertaste. Great beer and should be sought out by all."
"Wow. Just... wow. Poured a hazy honey colored with a white head that fell to a nice Belgian lace that wouldn't go away. Sweet and fruity nose, yeast and earthiness, such a fantastic aroma. The flavor had accents of fruit, rum, cider, spice, all wrapped up with a nice crisp finish. Very full mouthfeel, and an enigma in every sip. Very tasty."
"Smooth, sweet, spicy and complex flavors assault the tongue, with estery notes, ginger, and a slight hint of banana as well. It's hard to say just how this beer can display so many things at once, but it pulls it off admirably. Alcohol is well hidden, but slight warming is there at the end. This could pass for Duvel anyday of the week. What an astounding brewing acheivement! Cheers to Ommegang for this masterpiece!"
"Poured a hazy golden yellow color with tons, and I mean tons, of carbonation bubbles shooting upward. Very large, foamy, white head with maximum retention. Aroma was full of banana, yeast, wheat, not too unlike a hefeweizen. Taste was soft and mellow, kind of cidery with a citrus like hoppiness and the banana in the background. No real indication of the higher ABV. Awesome brew, and the price ($4.29 per liter) can't be beat."
"I was very impressed with this beers head. Very soft and fluffy, leaving a very nice lace on the glass. A very nice spicy yeast flavor that isn't over done, but still an important, solid part of the flavor profile. There is a good dose of hops to this beer, with a carbonation level that is quite appropriate to the style. This beer is quickly becoming a new favorite, and at $4.99 a 750ml bottle, it really can't be beat."
"Medium copper color, large head. Hoppy floral nose. Nice carbonation. Mildly hopped, spicy, slightly malted. Some yeastiness and some fruitiness. Light and refreshing. Yeasty flavor. Finish is light. Aftertaste is slightly fruity with some hoppyness, not bitter. This beer carries it 7.5% alcohol well."
"The aroma and palate are good individually, the way they work together makes them very complementary. At 7.5% it is fairly strong, but soft enough to not be intrusive. The label calls it a Farmhouse Ale, which is a good description of a Biere de Garde, and it comes across as a brew that could have been done by a local in an uncomplicated yet pleasing result. THis can be an everyday drink on it's own or with a meal instead of a white wine."
"Overall, a little bit of a let down for me. Split this one with my drinkin bud, and poured it into one of our new tulip glasses. Had a nice appearance...cloudy orange with a foamy, two finger thick head. Smell was nice as well, sweet and fruity. Had a carbonated, crisp mouthfeel, but not as pleasing on the palate as other Belgian style ales I've had. Taste wasn't anything special for me, fairly typical for this style of beer. Had an average drinkability....I didn't have problems with my half of the 750ml bottle, but I didn't want any more either. Worth a try, but don't expect to be blown away or anything."
"A fine appeance, looks even better than it tasted, A luminescent gold but cloudy. It has a thick white head, even with a gentle pour. Smells spicy (ginger or coriander) and hoppy with a hint of apple. Tastes alternately sour and fruity (depending on where it's hitting the palette) with that ginger spiciness thrown in. Quite the hoppy aftertaste but not unpleasantly so. Aftertaste really lingers. Has a foamy mouthfeel with a medium body. For such a complex ale, it is very drinkable. I would have to say this is my favorite Ommegang product I've tried thus far."
"Golden in color with a high amount of carbonation and a thin white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma suggests tropical fruit and orange with some spices. Taste begins with a honey-like sweetness and finishes slightly tart. Very authentic and true to the style. Completely in the tradition of Belgium."
"The yeast pour turns it into a cloudy yellow, and brings out a fruitier character."
"Another wonderful brew from Ommegang! This Hennepin pours almost a clear honey gold, there is a slight bit of haziness in the beer. On top of this champagne like brew is a thick, tight, white head that stays around for a while. The aroma is a bit mixed of light hops, fruit and spices. The taste is great, it starts off with a sweet/sour mix. Not a bitter tart sour but a slight twang to it sour. Near the end is a hint of malt and some hops. This is a very busy beer, that is nicely bodied and easy to drink. Very very nice!"
"Had I not known what I was drinking, I might have thought this beer was straight from Belgium. A thick pillowy snow-white head sits atop this light golden elixir. The first sips are dry and a tad smoky... as it warms the flavors and complexity emerge. Clove and banana complement the sticky yeast and subtle hops, and there is an odd yet enjoyable sweetness to it as well. I have not had many of this style, but I know this to be a delightful brew. Very light considering the complexity. The alcohol is hidden well. A tasty brew...I'm awaiting the other Ommegang beers that are in my fridge!"
"Hmm...first thought was ""Is this a 7.5 ABV?"" Reminded me of Hoegaarden, even though I know it is a different style. Head and appearance were very interesting. Nice thick head that dissipates slowly and lingers with a large bubbly surface. Smell is sonewaht fruity, reminding me once again of Hoegaarden. Nice crisp, somewhat fruity taste that cleansed the palate quite nicely with a subtle aftertaste. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, which was good for the alcohol content...no extreme bite here. Hard to really describe this in terms of other beers I have tried, othe that certain aspects reminded me of Hoegaarden...I honestly think this offering would be best on the patio on a nice summer's afternoon (out of the sun of course!) Initial thoughts are that at the right place and time this would be an excellent choice."
"Although Rare Vos is my favorite Ommegang product, this is certainly a close 2nd. The Saison is such a wonderful summer beer........so light and estery, yet still packs quite a punch!"
"Lace stuck to the inside of my glass and dthis had a thick white head that dissipated slowly atop a amber gold beer. Aroma was of a light hoppiness with spices. The flavor was a distinct spiciness from the yeast with a dry maltiness that definetly reminded me of a wheat beer. The carbonatin was very fine and truly in the belgian style. Very clean and excellent to have with dinner."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a hazy gold color with almost 3 fingers of foam. There is lots of thick lacing left on the glass. The smell is a bit spicy, with some cinnamon and fruity and nutty aromas as well. The taste is kind of fruity, kind of spicy, and kind of hoppy. A really good balanced blend of flavors. It is just the slightest bit dry. The mouthfeel is fairly full and bold. At 7.5%, this is fairly drinkable too. What a bargain!"
"This brew pours a large invigorated white head of finely sized bubbles. It has a Cloudy wheat yellow color with yeast and carbonation rising in it. It has a mild malty hoppy aroma. Its a bit fizzy at first, but it soon dies out. I tasted a mixture of flavors that was unique to this brew. It was a bit chewy, doughy and had a hint of something else. It became very smooth with time. The good buzz I caught afterwards keeps making me raise my rating on this brew."
"($3.99 / 25.4 oz / 750 ml Corked bottle)"
"I can't believe this is an American brewed Belgian. It's better than most Belgians from Belgium! Very complex in taste. I note a sweet fruity wine taste to it that all ommegang products seem to portray. There's also some peppery spice that brings a slight alcohol taste with it. Further along I notice honey and more spices. Great mixture of sweet and spices. No bitterness here. Finishes light and dry but has an alcoholic kick to it that I liked. The best Ommegang product. This is an amazing brew, one of the best for it's price."
"Drinkability: delicious almost to a fault. Wonderful mix of tastes and 11oz bottles could have you hammered in short order as you quickly quaff this outstanding beer. Now I've got to try to find more."
"Luminescent golden body topped by a rather thin white head, but the head shows decent retention and slowly fades to a thin collar. The aroma is very sweet, but then has an intriguing herbal smell as well. Hard for me to place the individual components, but it is very enticing. The taste is not neraly as sweet as the aroma insinuates. It has a nice grassy hop component, atop decent malt that just seems to stay out of the way. The finish is slightly bitter, but has a strange complexity. The spices bring to mind homemade chicken soup, as they did on the nose (I just thought it odd to mention at the time.) It has a very dry finish, that is slightly smoky or something. I can almost guarantee this would go well with roasted chicken or turkey. The mouthfeel is light and airy, but doesn't leave me feeling like something is missing. The drinkability is very good. I think this is an ideal dinner drink for poultry, and less of an everyday drinker. This may find it's way to my Thanksgiving table. A very enjoyable beer that seems part wine, part beer."
"Nice golden-yellow color. Pours with a nice foamy head that laces quite well. Taste is definitely Belgian, complex and rich. Deviliously delicious with a wide-ranged palate of flavors, a little spice, a faint hint of banana. Will return to this one time after time..."
"Drinkability: I absolutley loved this beer. One was just not enough for me."
"Hazy pour with a formidable off-white head. Clean, crisp grain smell dominates the nose and is complemented by an interesting cinnamon-like spiciness. Those scents carry over nicely to the taste, which is characterized by a good combination of sweet, crisp grains and a spicy bite of clove. Eventually fades to a warm finish. Good, clean mouthfeel. Once the novelty of this refreshing offering wears, you are left with a good but not great pale ale."
"Given the opportunity, I would probably abuse this beverage by overdoing it, Hennepin is most delicious and drinkable. 7.5% abv be damned, this is one beer that'll make you look past that to see how many more are in the fridge!"
"Cool bottle, which is always nice, seems to make my tongue more anxious. It pours nicely, an slight orange hue to the golden yellow brew as the cascade of bubbles make their way to the top for their obligatory contribution to a nice sized head. I smell bananas, clove, ginger, some other fruits, and yeastiness. And boy it is a nice tasting ale, with the fruitiness (banana and grapefruit) and spices making a nice balance with a decent hop presence. I found it to be a smooth beer with the carbonation action livening up my tongue, by the alcohol content makes this one to be careful with since I really couldn't tell it was that high."
"Served from a corked 750 ml bottle it appears a golden hue with a vibrant white head leaving trickled lace a picture perfect Belgium style ale. Aroma has some of those farm house ale characteristics of spices and yeast notes very nice along with huge tones of malt sweetness, underlying honey notes and the phenols are also producing the fruit tones characteristic of any fine Belgium ale. So, far simply amazing I love it. Taste light trickled malt, this is the perfect combination of sweetness, light hops, and exotic spices and full rich tones with a nice finish of alcohol on the palate. The mouthfeel has the consistency of a light syrup highly carbonated just full enough to coat the palate and tickle the senses. Drinkability is just wow, I could treat this like a session beer until I tried to stand up. Really too drinkable and desireable to approach too often save it as a treat. Best thing about it is the reasonable price for such a great beer, classic!"
"Unquestionably top notch...why the hell did it take so long for me to review this? It's proof that the best Belgian-style beers don't always come from Belgium. It's also a bargain at $4 for a 750ml bottle."
"The beer pours a light gold color with a lovely white head that stands tall. The aroma is exceptional. I love belgian beers like this one. There is so much going on in here; bitter orange peels, corriander, etc. It has a sort of banana aroma. I can't say enough about it. The taste is also good. It rings of spices right from the first sip. The elevated alcohol level (7.5%) also lets you know that this is a beer to enjoyed, not slammed down. This would be great with some gourmet food. The mouthfeel is tremendously smooth for a bottle conditioned ale. It goes down smooth and is very drinkable. A great choice anytime. In my opinion, their best regular offering, only edged out by their limited edition Three Philosophers."
"Golden and strong, light citrus aroma. This bottle had a heavy ammonia odor also, so my sample and evaluation may be tainted. Otherwise, another failed American attempt at a Belgian ale. However, I will say that this bottle's label is the most artistic and attractive that I've ever seen on a brew."
"This fine brew poured a dark coppery blond, with a humongous sticky white head with amazing staying power. Forget lacing on the glass, this one left big clumps and gobs behind. Truly amazing head, bigger and fluffier than anything else I've tried. (I looked in the bottle for a nitro widget, none there...) The head was obviously inspired by the beer's namesake, Fr. Hennepin, who was the first European to see Niagara Falls. The aromas were abundant, malt, clove, leather and tobacco. The taste was mostly malt and clove, that faded to grapefruit. Faint notes of honey, caramel, and pine. The mouthfeel was creamy, and had (truly amazing, considering the massive head) light carbonation. The finish was very mellow, setting me gently down to earth with a smooth, mild hoppiness. Wow! What a trip! Not like a barrel over the Falls, more like the Tunnel of Love with your best girlfriend..."
"A good bit cheaper than all the other Belgians I picked up this weekend, and still pretty good. Typical head, thick, fine, almost white. I broke my regular glass and was forced to drink from a green glass so I can't comment on the color or clarity (guess I need to get some more). The aroma was fruity and hoppy, maybe a bit spicy. Taste was great, ranging from sweet, to tart, to a bitterness that seemed to grow stronger with each glass. Nice lacing, and the head persisted to the bitter end, of course it didn't take long to polish off this beer. While there are better Belgians out there I must say this is a steal at $4-5 for 750ml...at that price its worth it just for shooting the cork at your friends."
"Originally sampled 19 January 2002. Although the style says it is a 'Saison', this reminds me of the white beers I had in Belgium (like Hoegaarden). The crisp taste is wonderful. It didn't have much head, but it was very pleasing to drink. I'm glad that I can get Ommegang's beers easily in my area"
"This brew poured a large white foamy long lasting head. The lacing on the sides of my glass was so-so. It had a sweet lemony aroma to it in my opinion. The carbonation was seen rising to the top. The body was gold in color. There was no bitterness noted with this particular brew. It was a smooth tasting brew to me which is much to my liking. I would definitely drink this one again."
"Poured a light golden color,for some reason didnt get much head at all maybe and older bottle?Smell was fresh and amd very floral.The first thing I got on the palate was a spiciness followed by some fruity,yeasty estures.There is a definent citrusy kinda lemony taste rounding out on this one.A really well made ale but maybe not for me so much,but it still deserves a pretty good raiting."
"A light golden or honey color with a very thick and huge head, which sticks in sugary patches throughout, I love those sugary patches! The aroma is of fresh fruit and flowers, quite nice. The initial chewy and sugary and alcohol combo is brilliant, some pepper and banana can be detected. Towards the finish, some hops and fresh fruit, a dry and hearty finish, very warming, and this is brewed in my home state of New York? Incredible, awesome, add your adjective here, deserves to be a top 10 beer."
"A nearly perfect beer."
"I'm surprised by the maltiness of this ale. Has a terrific sweet malt flavor. Looks great in the glass, cloudy honey appearance with a great Belgian-like head of froth. Slight citrus aroma and good hop character. Also reminds me of some German beers I've had. I find this very unique as with many Belgian recreations. Nice Ale!"
"This is a hoppy beer, as the label suggests (""pale, hoppy, crisp and rustic""), but it is by no means strongly or assertively hoppy. The complex flavors balance nicely. And a crisp mouthfeel makes this a refreshing brew, especially after a day working (or relaxing!) in the spring sun."
"Definately one of the better Saison style brews I've had, especially considering it is made in the United States. Hennepin's strongest characteristics begin to present themselves as the beer airs out and warms up a bit from its bottly confines. At first I found the bouquet to be a bit on the sour side and thought that I may have bought a skunked bottle of Hennepin, but after a few minutes I began to discover its delecate honey and hops tones. Definately a sipping beer, probably good on a hot day (I had it indoors on a 35 degree day). Overall, another excellent BC offering from Cooperstown."
"Edit: 10/31/04 - My tastes for the Abbey-style ale have evolved. I like them more than I once did. I can't drink more than a few at a sitting because they create an acid reflux problem for me. But Abbeys and Trappists are always a welcome treat."
"Cork popped out of the 750 ml bottle and flew across the room. Poured in the glass and had to wait for minutes for the head to dissipate so that I could reach the beer. Hazy golden in appearance. Smell is wonderful - lemon and bubble gum? First sip reveals grassy, earthy flavor and on the dry side. I got a nice aftertaste that seemed honey like in sweetness with some sourness. I read a review after my initial notes that indicated a salty cheese flavor that I agree with. I also agree with remarks that this would pair well with food. I wish I had some cheese to try out with it."
"from the aroma. Medium bodied, slightly spicy, slightly yeasty and drinkable. The sourness was pleasant on the tongue. A nice beer."
"This beer is made for food. Me and the foxylady munched on some salami that went extremely well with it - I imagine any spring or summery picnic or dinner would go fabulous with this. Can't wait to woo my wine drinking family over to beerdom with this brew this summer. Ommegang has hit the nail on the head in terms of a saison/farmhouse/bier de garde kind of ale."
"This was a damn fine beer! Another pick up from my escapades in Cooperstown. This poured a beautiful golden color with a marshmellowy white head. The smell was sweet like candied fruit with some rounded maltiness. The taste was crisp, smooth a very dry with some incredible carmamel flavors and notes of slight grape as well. I cannot praise this highly enough. I can see why they call this a folk beer. I would definitely drink 4-5 of these on a hot day which is exactly what this day was. However, with the increased alcohol content I will have to limit it to two."
"It is very tingly and crisp. A very refreshing brew. I had it on the first pretty warm day of the year, and it definitely hit the spot. I could see it being even more enjoyable during the heat of summer. Sweet malts provide most of the flavor, and then you get a doughy finish. The yeast comes through in the aftertaste, and then a slight hint of alcohol."
"A delightful beer, the rawness of it entices me like the less-than-perfect recordings from a indie CD. This beer hasn't been polished, the rough edges are still there, and that's what makes it so great. It's a beer to drink and enjoy. Again and again.... and again."
"Pours straw-golden with a slight haze, forming a large (depending on how you pour it), though quickly dissipating white head with an airy, sea-foam consistency, perched atop large bubbles. Carbonation is moderately strong. Aroma is highly yeasty with lots of phenolic cloves and banana. Hops and malts are barely discernable. No funk, esters, diacetyl or other fermentation by-products noted. Mouthfeel is fizzy and spritzy with a light body. Retention and lacing are adequate. A simple, but relatively clean beer....cloves, bananas, autolyzed yeast, wheat spiciness, some well-hidden (in taste) alcohol, with an isopropyl-like dry citrus finish and watery mouthfeel. As it warms, a grainy pale-malt note comes out in the finish and as the carbonation dissipates, the mouthfeel improves. There is still that metallic, ruddy tang (bad water?) that I tasted in the Ommegang, but thankfully this doesn't taste like ass. Adding the yeast and letting it warm made it infinitely more drinkable. Somewhat inferior, but similar to Blanche de Chambly from Unibroue but with a more potent alcohol bite. A 750ml bottle gave me a pleasant buzz."
"A very complicated beer that definitely improves with a wide-mouthed glass and a little warmth."
"Another I had heard great things about but had anticipated not liking all that much...WRONG!!..this is truly a great beer....citrus and cloves on the nose...pours a pretty clear gold with a big frothy white head...as I pour the bottom of the beers chucks of shit start floating around and get caught inthe head...COOL!! Body is about medium in thickness....very very drinkable...flavor includes sweet lemon drops...honey...cloves...juicy oranges...and some grassy hop notes develop along with a very slight alcohol spiciness on the long finish...this is a dandy...I want more!!!"
"WOW what can I say? a great beer"
"Overall, this is a wonderful beer: fruity, spicy, flowery bitter. I love the complexity and the way it develops, even in the aftertaste."
"Ive been saving this one for my 250th review since Im such a huge fan of regular Hennepin. However, its been tough to resist the temptation to open it before tonight on many occasions! Pours a bright hazy golden color with a monstrous pillowy white head that billows out of the glass and very slowly fades into a heavy lace and coats the sides of the glass with thick sheets of lace as it recedes. Active carbonation is apparent as you can see many streams of tiny bubbles racing up the glass. Nose is sweet honey and fresh citrus with some floral notes. Similar to regular Hennepin but a bit softer. Medium in body with one of the smoothest mouthfeels Ive ever known a beer to have. The active carbonation also gives the beer a very crisp quality. Taste is very complex. Sweet and fruity at first with flavors of banana, grapefruit, melon, lemon, and honey followed (and nicely balanced) by a dry yeastiness and maltiness. Ive often been reminded of fine champagne while sipping a regular Hennepin, and this one is no different. It does have a more mellow yeasty and citrusy bite to it then regular Hennepin, though. This was simply a magnificent beer. Absolutely one of the best beers Ive ever had the pleasure to drink. A very special thanks to paceyourself for sending me this brew!"
"Balance, balance, balance, Daniel-san. Asssertiveness and Lightness, Yin and Yang, Theory and Practice, Black and White, Power and Persuasion. This beer is all of these."
"This is a great beer -- definitely a crafted product. Nothing immature or haphazard tasting about this brew."
"Pours out a hazy straw gold with a beautiful bright white head. Tastes almost like a hefe in many ways. A hefe on lsd maybe. This is one complex brew. Wheat and lemonish flavors arive and depart. Clove and yeast knock on the door aswell. This is a beer that anyone can enjoy. Not too hoppy to scare away the unworthys (to quote Stone) and complex enough to satisfy a wine-buff. Not sure this is my favorite from the brewery, but this is an awesome brew that every BA should try if it becomes available."
"For $3.99/750 mL bottle, this is an enormous bargain. Pairs well with Vermont white cheddar and an impending Nor'easter. Great brew overall, and an excellent beer for the price."
"Definately my favorite of all the belgian styles I have tried. I am not a big belgian fan, but I will make an exception for this brew."
"This was quite a pleasant suprise. Somehow, I had the sense that this would be more of a ""spritzy", carbonated type of beer. In reality, it is very much like some of my favorite Belgian (and Belgian-styled) beers. Quite the subtle flavor for the style, very refreshing . Pours a large, fluffy head, good retention. Fluffy lace remains. Similar to Orval in the body and mouthfeel, but without the spicy, flowery taste. This goes down so easy, it could get you in trouble! Dare I say delicate?! Quite a feat for a beer with a 7% ABV. This beer is a good bargain, and would be perfect for anyone who may like the Belgians, but doesn't want 'em too strong."
"Golden in color with a thick, chunky head. It leaves an excellent amount of lacing when sipped down. The aroma is sweet, medicinal with banana and clove-like aromas. The flavors are fruity, and sweet from candi sugar. In the dry finish I detected a bit of a banana flavor. This was another fine Belgian-style beer. Medium in body, but smooth and easily drinkable despite its strength."
"Lovely golden color. Perfect head and just the right amount of the little bubble guys. Great taste, and great aftertaste. This aftertaste is handy -- stops you from drinking it too fast! I take drink and enjoy breathing through my nose for a few minutes before taking another. Very inexpensive for the quality, too."
"Pours very thick hazed gold, with an enormous fluffy white head. The aroma is easily noticed, very fruity, and sweet. Taste is sweet at first with not much of a carbonation feel on the tongue, making it smooth. I can sense the herbal hints that others have mentioned but I can't quite discern them. Nevertheless, they add a wonderful touch to this amazingly easy to drink beer. My interestin Belgian style ales is growing rapidly and this is another beer to definitely try, and a good idea for a first try in the Belgian style."
"From what I can tell this is the best beer brewed in north America. It speaks of nectarine and pepper. From Cooperstown NY, it is exotic. Crunchy, tart fruit doused with nutmeg, pepper and mace. Green grapes, powdered steel, Epoisses rind, brick, Vermouth and wilted lettuce conjure. White crust in the shape of a crucifix adheres to the side of my glass. Freudian beer."
"Cheers"
"I may never touch another Belgian after this American offering. Poured a cloudy yellow with a good head. The taste was perfect. Great hops, nice ""puckering"" taste. As I finished the bottle, I cursed myself for not picking up more than one. Just all around supurb."
"Pours a cloudy yellow color, nice fizzy white head that doesn't last. Flowery, spicy and fruity aromas, fruity, yeasty spicy wheaty flavors. Light to medium boby, smooth with no bitterness, finishes light, crisp and dry, all in all pretty damn good."
"Pale golden with a hint of orange, and a white head that stays exceptionally well. The aroma is a spicy sourness that really is refreshing. I definitely detect saaz hops, also some delicate malt character. The flavor starts out quite tart and hoppy, then more hoppy and malty near the middle. There's also a lot of sour fruitiness going on. Grapefruit especially. More delicate malt is detectable, which is a little bready. Even with the hop bitterness, this is very smooth. Great mouthfeel. Sourness and malt in the finish. Great beer! This could be considered a warm weather refresher, but I'm enjoying it on a cool evening, and it's working great. Another one of those beers that I'm very glad to have 750 ml of to enjoy, 12 oz. just wouldn't be enough."
"Pours a cloudy orangish gold with a fairly thin off white head. Reminds me of fresh apple queezins in appearance. Sweet/tart aroma of apples too. Smells tart and yeasty, slight malts too. Citrus hop notes come forward first, slightly dry. Grapefruit tartness. I was expecting more depth and complexity to this brew, but it held back until the finish. It mellowed to a nice balance at the end and the tartness faded to sweet. There was a spotty lace left on the glass, kind of like the beer itself."
"Have enjoyed this many times but never sat down and tried to describe it. I'm finding it difficult for some reason, I think mostly because there's a lot going on. Shimmering platinum with blossoming head, although I did not experience the retention that many described. A floral, perfumey nose with champagne-like yeasts. Flavors include lemon, white grapes, almonds, apples (yellow or green), spices and pepper, with a quite sour finish. Malts are incredibly delicate and hops only underscore the spices of the big yeast profile. A saison perhaps, but I found this merging into Duvel / pale / tripel territory due to its brightness and zesty lemon flavors, and almost none of the tea or peach flavors that I associate with a saison. I imagine a good meal would bring out the heartier aspects of this brew. As such it remains an excellent US version of a Belgian and surprisingly cooling and refreshing."
"Huge off-white head on top of a quite hazy orangish-yellow brew. Sticky pale malt aroma with a healthy dose esters thrown in. Tastes sweet without being overly sweet itself. Flavors like pale malt, honey, vanilla. There was even a tiny toastiness that found its way into my glass. Hop flavor or bitterness wasnt too prevalent, however there was some pepperiness to the beer. Carbonation was bigger than Id like and the beer was more viscous than any Saison Ive come across. Although there was some sourness, there is not as much as I had expected from a beer of this style."
"This beer was received as a Christmas gift in the three pack from the Ommegang Brewery. The beer poured quite lively into the glass forming a dense long lasting head with a beautiful color. The overwhelming nose was that of apples. I took some time just enjoying the aroma. The taste on the palate was clean and light with the bitterness being subdued and later. The beer tasted deceptively light for the high alcoholic strength. The finish was short and clean. Before I knew it, the glass was empty. A fine and tasty example of the style."
"Taste merits a rating higher than 5!"
"Incredbly smooth tasting considering its crisp, hoppy characteristics, all of which make this a great choice for those lazy afternoons."
"Hennepin pours a cloudy honey yellow with a snow white head that billows out of the glass. The head looks of whipped egg whites. Buy the time you finish this ale the glass is covered with foam (it's not really a lace pattern). The aroma is heaven. The first thing you notice is the fruity yeast followed by grains of paradise, orange, lemon, coriander, and hints of alcohol. The taste is very well balanced with the malt flavors up front. This is followed by citrus flavors and spice flavors blending in with the malt and being balanced with the effervescence of this well carbonated ale. The finish is dry with notes of apple and pear and just a hint of hops balanced against the alcohol. The aftertaste is a lingering sweetness with citrus and alcohol notes. The mouthfeel is full and pleasant with effervescent tingling. IMHO this is one of the best Saison's made in the world. It goes great with food or just sipping in the afternoon. Summer or winter."
"Started out pouring a nice golden hazy yellow with an average head of foam. The smell and taste was pleasant, but not what I expected. The carbination and bitterness was well balanced, but I was just not impressed with the taste!"
"Are we sure this one isn't from Belgium?"
"Pale yellowish color. Fresh, floral,citrusy nose, quite like a witbier.Very beautiful, very inviting, who could refuse a sip of a brew so friendly?Taste is extremely satisfying, if lacking depth, but then, like many pretty things, it's not meant to be deep, just delicious, d'lightful, d'lovely!"
"The smell is fruity, almost like a Hoegaarden. The taste is great, fruit, a tad of spice, real light for the ABV. Very Drinkable - the 750 was perfect with the Thanksgiving Turkey."
"Had a 750 ml bottle and this beer was excellent. It poored great with a big foamy, rocky amber head. It has a great fruity, sweet nose. It's taste is malty w/ a honey start that drys a bit on the finish. 7.5% abv but very drinkable and one that I will be drinking regularly when I want an Belgian style ale."
"Holy crap! That's all I can say about this beer. It pours a hazy orange, with a thick head. The one overriding flavor theme that I found in this beer, yet no one else has mentioned is apple. Perhaps my tastebuds are screwed up, but everytime I drink this I can swear I taste apples, like in a strong (nay, very strong) cider. It's a shame I've only seen this stuff in four packs."
"All in all this is a decent beer, with a lot going on, but is not one of the best saisons out there. The finish is disapointing and loses a lot of the complexity. Aroma is great, and appearance is perfect, but just dosnt come all together like some. If you like this try the Fantome Automn, it has the same smoth malt bas and spicy complexity, but just works better and all blends. Dupont, Pipax, Fantome, Pizza Port...all much better."
"Very smooth, easy to drink mouthfeel, despite the zesty, high carbonation. It is a tradition in my family to bring a bottle of wine to the Thanksgiving Dinner for all to sample, but I think this year I will surprise them all with a couple of 750 ml. bottles of this. I am sure that they will enjoy it and if you have yet to taste this great beer, you will probably enjoy it too."
"To put it simple Ommegang is one hell of a brewery!  This nectar pours a cloudy golden color with a slight head and good lace along the glass.  The scent is somewhat of a fruity one but not overly sweet like some Belgians.  The taste is perfectly balanced more toward the malty side IMO.  And it sits well on the palate, this beer is very drinkable for anyone. I think this is the one i would choose for the uneducated beer drinker to start with, it won't scare them off, and we BA can enjoy it also.  I didn't think they could beat Ommegan but I think I loke this one better.  I look forward to trying the other beers from this brewery when I can get my hands on them........CHEERS"
"Cloudy golden yellow with a foamy head that pours with the deadly ability to climb with vigor right out of your glass and onto the table. (which happened to me)  The bouquet reveals musty fruit with a bit of spice and a slight alcohol presence.  The taste is strong at first with a bit of the alcohol up front and a yeasty spiciness which rounds out to reveal a strong fruit presence and some slight hop bitterness that surfaces towards the end.  Intense fruit flavors ride out throuh the very long and smooth finish enticing another swill.  Well structured with good complexity, very well balanced, and dangerously drinkable."
"Very complex body, very complex beer. At times fuller and chunky, at other times lighter and somewhat sweet. To call it excellent is an understatement. One of the best beers I have ever had."
"Nice and warm.  This beer is well balanced--the strong malt flavor blends well with the bitterness and subtle hop flavor.  Has a slight spicy/phenolic character, but not overwhelming.  Alcohol is nocibaly present at first, but fades.  Very complex, but no particular aspect dominates.  Thany you sir...may I have another."
"Initially a shiny clear yellow color, bottle swirl produces the famialer cloudy yellow. Highly charged, bubbly white head, faded fast, but left a small film of lace. Smelled everything from honey, citrus, pepper, and spices. Taste was deeply inticing, new tastes on every sip. Sweet, crisp tart citrus and honey to start. As the beer warmed, more subtle peppery tastes emerge, then noticable alcohol warming takes place. Noticable abv warms you as you drink, every sip is a new taste combination. Good beer to finish the evening. I'm very Impressed this one, and will seek it out again."
"A Votre Sante or Cheers or sumthin'!"
"Looks beautiful, smells soothing, tastes smooth and feels comforting and luscious.  What can else can I say?  Please drink.  Cheers!"
"Pours a hazy golden color with a decent creamy white head that never fully sinks and leaves a decent lace down the glass.  Huge bubblegum, banana and other lighter fruits, and spicy pepper dominate the smell.  The taste starts off with some great light fruity flavors that is mostly dominated by banana with some possible peach and orange.  About half way through the brew gets nicely spicy with some good peppery qualities to it.  Excellently creamy and smooth but also fairly refreshing and excelently drinkable with a medium body to it.  This is one damn fine brew and I can't wait to get my hands on some more."
"Coudy golden-orange, with billowy pure white head that sticks around for the long haul. Beautiful. Spicy banana aromas, very complex. Taste is herbal hops, pepper, clove, banana, candied ginger, caramelized orange rind, pear -- it's all in there! High carbonation creates a playful feeling on the tongue, and balances nicely with the spicy and oh-so-bitter finish. This is a damn good beer."
"This is a great beer for the price, $4.50 for 750ml in Indianapolis."
"This brew is a chill hazed golden and throws out a big pufffy white head that has nice retention.  Pretty sweet aroma with this one.  Honey like.  Almost like a braggot or that Midas Touch brew.  There's also some fruity esters perceived on the nose.  Maybe some slight herbalness too.  Nice aroma.  Now this is a style of Belgian beers I can get into.  This is really nice tasting.  It is sweet, but kept in check with the hops, herbs and spices (which I will only try to take a stab at).  There could be something like Rosemary or Marjoram throwing some pizzaz into this brew.  I like it whatever it is.  This brew really has a nice earthiness to it.  Very unique taste.  But very drinkable.  Honey also seems to be perceived on the tongue.  This is a light-medium bodied brew.  Very good."
"The fluffy, thick lace - leaving porcelin - white head tops a hazy light tangerine hued effervescent brew.  Orange zest, candied ginger w/ trace phenol in aroma.  Tart, citrus rind hit the palette upfront and are followed by a mild but refreshing hop bitterness.  A light sweetness persists throughout this brew and seems to be the foundation for other flavors to build upon.  Candied fruit, honey, pear notes all intermingle in a whimiscal fashion.  The light body and crisp mouthfeel add to the flavorful yet refreshing nature of this brew.  Finishes bittersweet, w/ a mellow lingering breadiness.  Hennepin is ""playful"" in flavor, yet is very clean, and its drinkability is superlative.  Alcohol warmth surfaces long after the sip finishes.  Excellent, and perhaps bit dangerous."
"Fresh fruit aroma with hints of sweetness.  There is also strong yeast odor.  Very pale hazy look with a thick white head.  I also smell bannana.  Very carbonated at first taste with bannana and hops on the tongue.  Great mouth very sharp tasting also on the tongue.  lots of complexity in the yeast/hops relationship.  This would make a great starter with cheese and fruit.  Awesome American ... as usual from Brewery Ommegang!"
"Orangey and opaque, 1/4 inch fine mist head replenished by ascending carbonation. Bubbles shimmer like sugar crystals on the side of the glass. Slightly astringent aroma. Good combination of fruit, a little banana, and very nice bittering at the end.  Pretty reserved and yet nice tasting.  Its hard to call a Belgian a  ""session"" brew to me, but this one would be for me.  Solid in most categories."
"This beer poured out a nice golden color.  It formed a nice white head with some lace on the side later on.  The aroma of smelled of malts and cirtus.  Good level of carbination to this beer.  Due to that, the initial mouthfeel taste of it throws me off a little, but it sudsides after the next taste or so.  Hides it's alcohol content well.  A very enjoyable beer."
"It all starts when you pop the cork from the bottle.  A nice loud 'pop' - almost like a champagne.  The beer pours to a hazy gold, with a thick, white head.  Solid head retention, with lace clinging to the glass as you drink.  Smell is lightly fruity and spicy, filled with sweet apple, pepper, hops, and yeast.  Flavor is rich and strong with the flavors hinted at in the aroma.  I also notice a bit of citrus flavor meshing with the apple.  Lively continual carbonation give the brew a bit of zest, but not too much as to make it seem acidic on the tongue.  Wonderful brew, and a great cost effective Belgian-style ale."
"Pours a hazy golden with lively carbonation. A long-lived head displays ample Belgian lace clinging to the glass. Nose is light malt, and a wee bit lemony. Taste is again light, fruity with some hoppy bitterness coming thru. Close your eyes and you'll swear this beer was brewed in Belgium. Goes great with Wise BBQ potato chips."
"Update: Maybe my opinion of Ommy has soured, but this is not the beer I once thought, aged or fresh. More tart than memory recalls with green apples and citric fruit taking the fore. Simplistic, light peppery and doughbal yeastiness. Good for what it is, but so many saisons surpass this. But I must say, for the price, this is still a soild belgo-quaffer."
"Tart and fruity. Heavily carbonated, obscenely so. Smells wonderful. Nice deep character. I didn't expect anything this good for what I first thought was a 'knock-off'. Definatly a re-visit."
"114"
"Cheers to frank4sail for the sample."
"Notes: Raw and complex yet oh so drinkable, impossible to tell it would have been from NY in a blind tasting. One of our favourites, bring a couple of 750 ml bottles to the dinner party and see if this sparks anyones interest away from wine."
"A pleasant fruity and spicey nose.  Extremely carbonated, quite the spectacle.  Head is thick and fluffy, almost weightless, endures long after your pour, sticky.  Misty yellow-orange.  Exceptional flavor.  Fantastic belgian character.  Home-town indeed.  Prost!"
"Cloudy and golden with lovely white head that sticks around. Very smooth and full bodied initially, followed by a bitter/alcohol/carbonation gang-bang bite at the back of the palate and into the nose coupled with a lingering bitterness with a slight tartness that leaves the outsides of your tongue somewhat numb. Taste is very similar to biere de garde style with lots of spiciness but not much wineniness."
"Very reasonably priced for the quality.  Nice balance of sweetness and peppery spice.  Probably one that would grow on me after a few more bottles to get to know the beer."
"This is American? Whoa. Hennepin is the best American approximation of a Saison that I have ever had. Slightly cloudy golden brew that pours a big white head. Fruity sweetness (orange? lemon?) balanced by a good hop character in the finish. And, at a little over four bucks for 750 ml, what a deal!"
"Damn this is a good beer.  Such a smooth light taste, but that Belgian strength and sweetness is still lingering there.  A top quality beer for an unbelievable price."
"This is my first saison, so I have nothing to compare it to, but this beer is awesome.  It usually takes me a couple of beers to warm up to a style, but I liked this one off the bat.  Are all saisons this complex?"
"A lighter, dryer brew than the Ommegang, but no less complex. Lemon, orange zest, spicey finish. There plenty going on with each swallow of this outstanding beer."
"Fantastic Beer.  Has a little cidery taste, but it works."
