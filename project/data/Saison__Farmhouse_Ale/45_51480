The waxy, musty, and dill-like notes detract from the beer and muddle what is supposed to be a very ""clean"" style, and despite the stellar mouthfeel, the disparate aromas and flavours never come together in a cohesive way. I can see what they're trying to do here, but this one doesn't do much for me.","cratez","Oct 25, 2014"

Carbonation is somewhat aggressive but softer than a sparkling wine. While this is no session beer, the flavor and mouthfeel give it a very refreshing character, with only a bit of alcohol warmth. Brooklyn's big bottle Belgians (Local 1,2) are great beers, and Sorachi Ace is no exception.","gr0g","Aug 17, 2014"

Crisp, clean, sugary, complex and layered. The Sorachi Ace also makes quite a statement. Very floral, funky and natural tasting, almost like flowers and cannabis with rich sugars and fresh yeast. Delicious. It doesn't get much better than this. Teetering on perfection -- in fact, I do not know what could be improved. I rate this even higher given the fun experimentation.","Agent1","Feb 14, 2014"

3.8,-7.3,3.5,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Sampled on tap at Beer Revolution in Calgary. A light yellow to amber colored brew with a minimal white head but ample carbonation, sparkly and with a champagne-like mouthfeel. Aroma extremely bright, fruity, and vegetal, redolent with lemon zest, green herbs, yeast-derived spicy notes, and a dry nutty earthiness, perhaps a tad musty. Palate is unique, a combination of more typical earthy, spicy flavors characteristic of classic saisons and assertive herbal/citrus hops, as one would expect from a beer billed as a single-hop showcase. The pilsener malt and nutty yeast elements are present but take a back seat to vibrant cilantro, lemon grass, and spice seed flavors that make for a memorable and perhaps polarizing taste experience. There is also a root cellar earthy peppery spice lurking in there, with a floral perfume and some alcohol peeking through at times. Crisp and dry, body is just shy of middling and the lack of sweetness becomes more apparent as one proceeds through a pint. Approach this one in the right mindset and you'll be intrigued by some unusual flavors. Sorachi Ace is a distinctive hop.","CalgaryFMC","Jan 17, 2014"

Carbonation was streaming to the top of the glass. The beer gave off a very good Belgian yeast aroma and slight citrus, lemon maybe. The taster was excellent, just what you would expect, but with a dry aftertaste. The beer follows the nose perfectly. The beer had a medium body, good carbonation, and it was extremely drinkable and smooth. Overall, very high quality.","PhillyStyle","Dec 06, 2013"

It definitely needs to warm a bit before all the complexity comes out. First glass was a bit too cold and I found it good but not great. Second glass, I let sit for about 10 minutes and that's when this beer really shined. Very pleasant mild funk on the nose with grass and lemon interwoven. Poured out with a nice head that held on till I drained the glass. Kind of earthy taste, again with the grass and lemon. And it goes down quite easily. A very good beer which I will definitely buy again; and can find virtually anywhere.","Ralphs66","Oct 29, 2013"

The flavor seems to match the scent as the hop's indescribably unique citron demonstration steals the show. More than subtle, less than front forward, Brooklyn Brewery does it again, for me at least. The only visual obstructing the view through this clear golden cloudless thirst-quenching indulgence are the crystal carbonation bubbles drifting up to support the stable fetching white head. This may be my new favorite beer! I can drink this all day. I better put some of this in the vault before it's all gone.

Aromas of big lemon, pear, pineapple, clove, orange zest, pepper, herbal, earth, grass, floral, and yeast spiciness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity. Taste of big lemon, pear, pepper, pineapple, apple, orange zest, clove, herbal, grass, earth, floral, and yeast spices. Light earthy bitterness on the finish with light tartness; with lingering notes of light fruits, lemon, pepper, clove, herbal, floral, grass, earth, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance and complexity of flavors; great spiciness/malt balance; zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a lightly slick and very crisp and prickly mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish.

3.96,-3.4,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Now, the strong points of this beer. Thee‚Äôs a brilliant mouthfeel: awesomely soft and fluffy. The carbonation is high, but very refined and pleasant. The alleged star of this Saison--the Sorachi Ace hop varietal from Japan-- is present, though seems to be more than balanced by the malt. The hop flavor is nice: lightly lemony and herbal. Bitter, but not totally dry.And the not-so-strong? I must admit, I was expecting more from this brew. There is a big, biscuity malt presence that I wouldn't say is par for the Saison style. But the main flaw I see in this beer is an annoyingly buttery flavor-- dare I say, diacetyl aftertaste. This doesn't fit into my definition of ""crackingly dry", as the bottle proclaims. Clean this butteriness up, Brooklyn, sub in a bit more Saison funk, and you'd have an awesome beer.","vickersspitfire","Jul 27, 2012"

Though, it‚Äôs clear they picked a pretty refined strain for this, given the surprisingly nuanced mouthfeel and unique but not overpowering yeast note on the palate. And then the hops. This is a very unique, VERY successful pairing of hops and beer style, and to be honest I‚Äôm amazed at how long they‚Äôve held on. Great job, Brooklyn!

Nevertheless, a fine looking beverage with drippy lace all the way down the glass. Perfumy floral and lemongrass aromas over a solid pilsner malt base. Increased juicy, zesty citrus and fresh herbs at it warms a bit. Sweet, juicy lemon and a certain soft, creamy, almost honey-like character in the mouth with, again, a nice pale malt presence. Dough, fresh herbs, clove, pear, and cedar. Overall phenolics are light. Very flavorful, yet soft and smooth. Medium bodied and fairly well carbonated. Properly bitter and dry.

The aroma draws you in with floral notes before honey and then a big lemony citrus smell finishes the beer off. The aroma is big but delicate. The taste follows suit with a green fruit tartness up front before there is a sweet honey and then a big lemon and other citrus flavor comes through. Again the taste is big but delicate. It is light and refreshing. The mouthfeel is crisp with moderate carbonation. Overall a very good beer, the beer is dangerously drinkable for the abv, and is surprisingly delicate for the abv. This beer is a must try.","goblue3509","Mar 26, 2012"
4.32,5.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Poured from a corked and caged 750 ml bottle into a tulip. Very white, large soapy head forms quickly, and never goes away. Moderate lacing. Beer is pale orange or dark straw, with lots of tiny bubbles, slightly hazy. The nose shows banana, mango, clove, and a little vanilla. Those flavors dominate up front too, especially the mango and tropical fruit, with a wheat-like graininess coming in, followed by a semi-dry finish with a bit of a citrus impression. They yeast characteristic shows predominantly in the nose, and less so in the taste. It's a light, spritzy beer, but it has some backbone to it. Styled as a saison, I'd also believe it as a non-traditional wit in flavor profile. Perhaps unusual at first, but it insinuates itself quickly. Really very good, and a beer I'd definitely seek out.","MCDuhamel","Mar 24, 2012"

The hops were more prominent than most Saisons I've tasted, and they added a lemony, herbal, and mildly bitter flavors. The malt bill appeared to consist mostly of pale varieties, which added a simple sweetness. The yeast was not as interesting as other Saisons, and added some pepper like spice, but not much funk. A bit lighter in body than the typical Saison of today too. That being said, this was very refreshing beer to drink, with little holding you back from downing it quickly.","rajendra82","Jan 29, 2012"

4.72,15.1,4,4.5,4.75,5,5,"one of the best beers i have ever had. no kidding. beautiful packaging cork and cage set up for 27 bucks at harry's seafood restaurant in wilmington, deleware. poured a heady golden a little hazy into a frosted pint glass. smells like a saison, yeasty, grassy, and way way way more hoppy than these usually are. almost ipa-esque in the nose. the flavor is unreal, not nearly the hop bomb promised by the aroma. instead a balanced complexity. i can detect vanilla, cut grass, citrus fruit, and a delicate malt backing band. mouthfeel is perfect, medium bodied, brilliantly carbonated, and smooth as anything. has a sort of richness in the feel that most beers dont have, especially saisons. the bottle mentions a champaigne yeast, which is the first ive heard of it, but it imparts wonderful flavor and feel to this beer. worth the money and was excellent with our massive seafood feast. i will be reccommending this beer to everyone, its absolutely winderful!","StonedTrippin","Dec 17, 2011"

3.53,-13.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"750ml bottle caged and corked poured into a weizen glass. A great looking beer with a cloudy golden wheat haze. Awesome 3 finger pillow off-white head that faded to one finger. Decent lacing start to finish. Smell was a bit faint, but picked up notes of citrus, honey, cloves and banana bread. Taste followed the nose with a tart front end and smooth finish. Some spices crept through as it warmed. A little bit of a fizzy afterhit that was odd. Didn't enjoy the bitter fizz as it sort of crowded out the citrus/fruit. Mouthfeel was a good bit of carbonation and fizz. Not watery and a little dry. Overall- I was wanting a little more from this Farmhouse Ale. The taste was a little bitter for me and I like this style with less of a hop bite. The honey, cloves and wheat are prominent up front and it is still a good effort from Brooklyn. Have yet to have a bad beer from them. Not bad and would have another.

Aroma is much more promising than the appearance - strong, yeasty, fruity, with grassy and rubbery notes. Refreshing flavor has malty, fruity, yeasty and grassy notes with a hint like clean rubber - I get notes of apple and banana in the fruit.

4.08,-0.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Sorachi Ace pours a clear dark lemon (I have a hunch I'll be typing that word a lot here) yellow. There's about two fingers of fluffy white foam capping the beer. Head retention is solid, and the beer leaves sheets and sheets of lacing stuck to the glass. The nose is an absolute lemon bomb, reminds me of making fresh squeezed lemonade at work. There's also a bit of pale malt sweetness, but it's very much an ancillary note. The flavor takes that foundation and layers in a subtle clove-pepper spiciness to keep things interesting. It was easy to pick out after having had Brooklyn Radius early in the night, as I'm guessing it comes from the brewery's house Belgian strain, and it's featured more prominently in Radius. The body is impressively light for a beer approaching 8%ABV, the dryness being the mark of a well brewed Belgian style beer. The carbonation is active and effervescent and really helps carry the unique flavor contributed by the hop that gives this beer it's name. I'm thrilled that I'll be able to pick up Sorachi Ace in bottled form any time I want going forward, it's a well made, fairly original saison.","axeman9182","Sep 04, 2011"

Drank it the same day I bought it, so didn't let it settle out, so I may be the cause of the hazy part. Gorgeous complex lemongrass, citrus nose and strong peppery spice that is clean and multi-layered at the same time. Carbon tang on the tongue and the yeast and spice fills the mouth fully. Dry finished that accents the hops. Brewed with rare Japanese Sorachi hops (according to the website), the lemony character is intrinsic to the hop.

Lighter body is fluffed by the bottle conditioning, adding a huge refreshing quality. Fresh herbs with some dried fruit; yeasty and medicinal, cracker maltiness and earthy.

Poured a hazy glowing light golden straw color withe a billowing frothy white head that holds shape when you finger it. Shrinks in a few minutes leaving minimal spotted lacing. Smells lemony with light herbal grassy verge notes. This doesn't taste like your average saison. The citrus notes are great but the sorachi hops are odd. There is a weird medicinal earthy taste from them. Fairly bitter for a saison. Feel is light to medium.

The taste is pretty good, I get a little citrus / lemony taste, a little peppery, a little bananna, a little grassy, and it has a nice bitter after flavor. Overall a pretty good beer, this is only my second Saison with the other being Hennepin, this doesn't have the long dry finish which I found in Hennepin and I prefer that one more to this, I'm not sure which is more correct though.

4.25,3.7,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Nose is super lemony, sweet, fresh mown hay, touch of cracked pepper. Love the Sorachi Ace addition, fresh lemongrass in the flavor, orange and citrus rind along the lines of marmalade, pepper, a touch heavy for a saison but beautiful bone dry finish, hint of mineral like character in it. Quite drinkable, very spritzy carbonation. Lacking some of the characteristics of a traditional saison but a terrific take nonetheless.","ritzkiss","Jul 21, 2011"
4.02,-2,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"Overall / Drinkability: Definitely quenches the thirst - and it's not quite like anything I've had before in a beer. Goes to the head quickly though, even with a meal, so it's either a slow sipper, or in this case, one and done for me per evening. The Japanese hops are the showcase for this beer, and I'm not sure how I feel about them. Interesting, unusual, and worth trying, but I think just one per night even if the ABV was lower. So a good experience, but not something I could have every night or something that I would go out of my way to have again. Something about that woody/herb/resiny flavor at the end doesn't quite do it for me. Still - a neat beer to try out for the reason of it being so unique in flavor.","damndirtyape","Jul 17, 2011"
4.22,2.9,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"O: This is a fantastic beer and, more to the point, a fantastic saison. The wonderful complex aroma (which is noticeable as one pours the beer into a glass) matches a nice flavor profile of spicy fruit and earth. The great carbonation keeps the beer fresh and crisp. However, the finish could perhaps have a bit less bitterness since citrus is already the star of the the beers flavor. I would also have liked it to be a bit more on the sour side. Slight negatives aside, this is an excellent beer well suited for the summer, and (really) it is good enough to be enjoyed year round.","ianjsullivan","Jul 15, 2011"

4.36,6.3,5,4,4,5,5,"What I love most about this is how it's a beer that features a hop in its name, nicely showcases that rare hop varietal, yet sticks completely to the traditional Saison style. It has an elegance that West coasters just love to kill with their bash-you-over-the-head hop profiles. The back label claims it's sunshine in a glass, and I'd say they're pretty right on. Raw and refreshing. I hear this is going to be a year-long release now. Hope that's true cuz I could do at least one of these a week.","TheWhiskerReview","Jul 10, 2011"

4.2,2.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Nice to see this on the shelves at BCLB stores at $9.99. This is a funky beer that shows off a unique hop that is truly reminescent of lemongrass and lemons. The farmhouse style works very well with the hop and uses the slight funk to counter the citric notes of the hop. I could see one eating Thai or Korean food with this beer and I really started to enjoy the way this beer tasted like no other I have had.

3.69,-10,3.5,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours exactly like champaign a little too much head. Smells like a sour with some mild floral hop aroma and some wheat beer scent as well with a slight bit of lemonade. The taste is very unique tastes like lemon rind, a slight bit of grassy hops, a lot of fresh black tea leaves and very dry. The flavor coats the tounge and stays with an after taste of sour skittles or warheads and an addictive lemon lime sting that does not go away. This is a great introduction to a sour in my opinion but the hop focus for this is not great, not the style to use in order to showcase the hop. Maybe would be more interesting as a pale ale without all the fancy.","jizfiasco","Jul 01, 2011"

It has a crisp bitterness up front along with a earthy/farmhouse finish. The malt bill provides a stable base with a basic pale malt flavor. It's light and lemony with a dry/clean finish. I'm not getting as much esters in the taste. I'm guessing the hops are canceling a bit of the character out. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low/medium bodied beer with good carbonation.

A bit of faux-lemon in the crisp and dry body of the beer. Once again it isn't sitting well for me for what I want in a beer. The body though does have a nice black pepper taste to it...

The aroma is zesty lemon, fresh cut grass, and salt-less, Saltine crackers. Oddly enough, I detect just a little blue cheese. The flavor is simply and refined. Bright lemon zest, just a slight tangerine, grass and pale German malts. This beer is really simple and straightforward but very elegant in its simplicity. The mouthfeel is just about perfect. Dry enough that it leaves the mouth lingering for another sip but full enough that it coats your mouth in dry grass and lemon.

The beer is a pale yellow with a foamy white head. Good looking, but that's not really atypical of the style. The aroma is a bright splash of lemongrass/grass/herbal hops. It's sweet-tart citric with some fruity peppercorns, as well. The yeast aroma is muted but nice. The grain seems good and fresh, but it's overpowered by the hops. The taste starts bright and sweet but ends quite dry and with a tartly bitter hop bite. It's oddly soapy, like a lemongrass hand soap, and I sort of enjoy it. Mouthfeel is full but light - interesting use of champagne yeast for bottling. Definitely easy to drink for the abv.

The aromas pouring out of this beer are pretty unreal... Deeply layered and complex. Starts of with a heavy dose of mango hops (the sorachi ace is the mango hop in my opinion), deep and fruity, and plenty of classic saison earthyness and dust. Excellent fruity esters from the champagne yeast. Really interesting, and I'm almost getting an umami or ripe cheese overtone here... Crazy. This beer is superb on the palate as well. So much going on. Again hops forward, mango to the max, but in a super floral juicy way, not much bitterness, though remains quite dry. There is a nice fruity aspect to this beer too - great yeast and bottle conditioning in effect. A deepness to it as well, a la Belgian tripel or something. Rustic. Super soft yet lively mouthfeel, delicious. Could definitely drink this all day long, given a keg and a day off. This beer is clearly paying homage to the great Belgian saisons, but is just another great example of an extremely creative American interpretation. And as such, it becomes something else entirely. Amazing, would drink again.","twelvsies","Sep 04, 2010"

Aroma is yeast, fresh hop that smells like weed, malt, grain, fruit and a bit of citrus. Flavor is similar but with the hop tasting only like fresh hop; good pungency which is true to style and a little sweetness in there to balance it all.

The hop character is extraordinary, the lemongrass and basil notes are like nothing that I have ever had before and it was an inspired choice to use them in a saison. The spicy yeast and creamy wheat character frame these unusual hops perfectly and seem to meld with the herbal, citrus character of the sorachi ace hops to produce a very coherent, well balanced beer. There is a really remarkable lemongrass aroma and flavor that, along with notes of coriander and basil reminds me vividly of Thai cooking. This is a spectacular beer, both for the way that it showcases this new hop variety and simply as a refreshing, spicy, and very drinkable saison.","nickfl","Jul 11, 2010"

Aroma is very grassy, earthy, zesty and lemony. Background of some candied sugars and spices, but something just isn't clicking for me with the nose. The flavor is also slightly off, with strong sweet notes from the champagne yeast and pale malts, and contrasting earthy, zesty, grassy hops without much bitterness from the Sorachi Ace. Mouthfeel is medium full, very soft with fine, light carbonation producing the expected clean dry finish. A grainy, yeast flavor also lingers in the finish detracting from my enjoyment of this. The flavors in this don't quite mesh as smoothly as hoped for, pulling down my opinion of this otherwise fine, unique beer.","yourefragile","Jul 11, 2010"

Pours a slightly cloudy, but glowing golden with a mousse-like head that sticks around and leaves some sticky lacing. Very lemony aromas, with particular emphasis on the zest- slightly bitter and oily, but with the bright, zingy essential aromas of the lemon. The taste is extremely complex. I can't put my finger on all the elements there, but the overall impression is of lemon meringue with a touch of pith mixed in with a zest accent on top. More pith than zest here, quite bitter, but in that particular pithy way, and with some creaminess on the finish. There is also a good deal of herbalness, but I can't put my finger on what herb(s) it reminds me of. Quenching and drying 9in the mouth, this is a Saison to contemplate.","Georgiabeer","Jul 06, 2010"

4.16,1.5,5,4,4,4,4.5,"Poured into a tulip, Brooklyn's Sorachi Ace appears a slightly hazed light straw yellow color with a monsterous head of white fluffy foam for a head that is more than 2 fingers strong. The head displays amazing powers of retension. Right down to the last sip more than a finger of white fluff remains. Patches of white lace cling along the glassware where the head previously came into contact. Aroma of this beer is a little spicey and a bit soapy but the prominent characteristics of the nose are the lemony citrus and grassy smell brought on by this unique type of hop. Throughout the experience, it is interesting how the citrusy lemon character flip flops with the grassy character to try and overtake the other scent. The taste of this brew is light and refreshing with a very lively level of carbonation that tickles the tongue. For a style that should be well carbonated, this one is on the verge of being over the top with carbonation. Upfront there is a spicey flavor that is mildly peppery but turns to a slight hop bitterness heavily flavored with grass and lemon zest. Very mild malt backing to this brew but at times it does come across a bit spicey and mildly sweet maybe a bit like pear but for the most part it finishes quite dry. The lingering flavor of this brew is all lemon and grass. I have had other samples of beer that had hints of lemongrass but this one really brings it home and is enjoyable without feeling like I just sprayed pine-sol in my mouth or under my nose. Very drinkable, I would enjoy this one again but wow I certainly wasn't able to detect the 7.5+% abv this has.","stakem","Jun 30, 2010"

The taste goes somewhat sideways: notes of grass, hoppy citrus and bitterness, greens, stinging lemon and lemongrass, garlic, and a very light butter in the background. Something is heavily amiss, though. I must just not like the sorachi variety, I guess. The body is a very light medium, with an active carbonation and a dry, strangely dusty feel.

4.08,-0.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Attractive bottle dispenses a fairly clear, dark golden brew with a just-off-white head that pillows up and holds. Wow. Amazing hop character right off the bat in the nose that is very lemon-centric, which also carries notes of citrus, flower and earth. The backbone contributed by the yeast and grains is spicy (pepper/clove? almost non-existent), biscuity and earthy in it's own way. Hops dominate though. Taste is lemony flowers with sweet notes and pepper just before the finish that is wiped away by a zippy heat from the booze, crisp carbonation, and what tastes to me like preserved lemon. As it warms, it seems like some light sweetness comes out and the spiciness in the middle seems to show a bit better. Very nice showcase for a really great hop. Unfortunately, I fear that this unique new hop is the soul of this beer, and if it were to be stripped away and replaced with a more traditional variety in a more traditional level of ibus, you would end up with a very well-made beer that may seem a tad contrived, exhibiting clean, textbook yet conservative, ""saison-style"" flavor.

Then comes the unique hop flavor. A sugar laced lemon flavor comes through imparting a dry and slightly tart note. It has some grassy/hay like flavors as well. The yeasty flavors don't come out as strong as it did in the aroma. The feel is light and extremely fizzy, sweet yet dry, finishes balanced. Not a traditional saison. I find that a lot of the ""funk"" "tart"" flavors comes from the hops. The beer has a good belgian base but the hops make it grassy, tart, and something that you can sense was made in a farmhouse.

3.87,-5.6,4,4.5,4,3.5,3,"Seems like quite the polarizing beer! Count me in the camp of ""enjoyed it"". What I love about trying a new saison is that you never really know what you are going to get because of the number of unique yeast strains used in their preparation, and in the case of many brewers, the use of unique spices/herbs. Knowing that going in, I was still surprised at the distinctive burnt rubber smells of this beer and spicy finish. Not for everyone, but I loved it! I also walked in with a preconceived notion that hops would be in the background only, and was again surprised at the modest astringency of this saison. Any comparison to a well hopped Fantome is reasonable, which also tend to be polarizing and confusing beers. If you are looking for predictable and boring, look elsewhere.","jwjon1","May 20, 2010"
3.92,-4.4,4,4.5,3.5,4,4,"Beer is light in body and quite hoppy. Lots of carbonation in the mouth and it finishes cleanly with no aftertaste. There is a growing bitterness in the back of the mouth. The midpalate flavors are a lot of tropical fruits like papaya and mango. Its relatively subtle. I don't really get saison from this but I'm not sure what I am getting from this. There seems to be a disconnect. It all tastes fine but its not coming together for me. I can't give it a bad review because I like all the parts but I don't put cheese on my Chinese food either.

3.4,-17.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"I have had this a couple times from the tap, but this will be my first time from the bottle. The color is golden straw, with tons of air bubbles, and a very large, frothy white head. I have to say that when I tried it last, it had a sort of burnt rubber aroma to it, which I attributed to the Sorachi Ace hops. In this case, there is still some of that, but significantly toned down, and more dominated by tropical fruit such as papaya, mango, as well as some dry grain. The flavor starts out on the sweet side, with the fruit coming through nicely, and then ends on a more bitter note from the hops. The mouthfeel is lively, and quite nice on the palate, with prickly carbonation. One glass is enough for me right now, though I will definitely be finishing this bottle over the next few days. Unfortunately, the problem with this beer is what it is centered around: the Sorachi hops. At least for me, this is not a preferable varietal. On the flip side, good for Brooklyn for jumping on this new hop strain.","jamie2dope","May 19, 2010"

Aroma of lots of spices (pepper, clove), lemon, melon rind, and wheaty malt. Flavor is quite powerfully spicy on the initial sip (peppery mostly, maybe some spicy hops) with a wheaty/grainy (corn and rice grains too) finish and some sweet fruits and lemon. Interesting beer and pretty tasty. Not exactly a session beer, but it worked fine!","LilBeerDoctor","Dec 18, 2009"

4.02,-2,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"I tried this on tap at The Great Lost Bear in Portland, ME on 10/30/09. Poured into a 16oz shaker pint. A nice tight one finger head died down to leave behind an elegant, thin lacing above a bright yellow, slightly cloudy, nicely carbonated body. The nose is intense on this one, big lemon, spicy hops, a lot of floral notes, and the slightly funky, damp brett. The taste is very floral, rose hips, a little lemon, a bit of black pepper or coriander, some nice notes from the yeast, very nice bitterness. Light bodied with lots of cleansing carbonation, nice dry finish. I could probably drink a couple of these, not sure I would though, it's nice for what it is but a little too floral for my taste.","GrittyMug345","Nov 04, 2009"
3.85,-6.1,4,4,3.5,4.5,4,"Served at the Tap & Mallet, Rochester, NY. Pours a relatively clear, light golden color. The head is pretty much gone by the time it arrives at the table. The smell is dry, herbal, CO2, slightly medicinal. The taste is interesting. I would definitely consider this an American style Saison. Residual sweetness despite trying to be bone-dry, a mouthwatering punch of citrus-like flavor, but a nice take on the traditional hops used. I don't know much about these Sorachi hops, but I do know they seem to be the American equivalent of Saaz, IMO. They have the same light, styrofoam-grassy taste, but they also harness that west coast American piny flavor. All in all, I would like to see a more traditional Belgian Saison, bone dry and more subtle in the flavor department, but the hops are full of character, nonetheless.","Rudgers73","Nov 02, 2009"

The Sorachi Ace hop is just as described, a lot of lemon citrus, no real fight with the pale malts for aromatic dominance. There's a fair amount of spice and what smells like honey in there too. The taste is damn near perfect, I like this hop and I like it's presence in this beer. Lots of lemon citrus and light floral tastes, this is delicous with a light touch. A somewhat thin body which matches my expectations for the style, overall another excellent beer from Brooklyn, outstanding.","TurdFurgison","Oct 14, 2009"
4.5,9.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured a pale golden slighty hazed hue with a bright white head, appears almost pils like with very nice intricate lacing as the head settles. Aroma was spicy with a funky welcoming yeast edge with a very nice citric and tropical hoppiness about it with a touch of coriander or other spice addition possibly? Flavor has more of the spicy citrus and herbal hop blend from this rare varietal of hop, a nice zesty edge to the whole experience sweetness is balanced with some dry yeast flavors in the finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied very sessionable brew comes off quite nice and definitely intrigues the senses with each sniff and sip. A complex satisfying drinking experience that was very unique and it reeled me in, I hope this makes it's way back to the beer drinkers.","WVbeergeek","Oct 08, 2009"
4.2,2.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Wow! A really unique beer. Pale straw gold and hazy. Medium bodied. Good head retention. It's spicy, lemony, and woody, no doubt due to the Sorachi Ace hops. In another beer brewed with them, I found them to be almost cedar-like. That's not the case here, but it is a bit woody, at least as far as dryness goes. It's a great combination: dry and bitter, but infused with citrus and some minor yeasty phenols. Interesting! Weird! I love the contradictions it offers, and also that it's not really that complex either - everything is put right out there on the table. A great summer beer. I would love to see this one brewed again next year!","NeroFiddled","Sep 24, 2009"

4.2,2.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"I ordered this beer knowing nothing about it. I vaguely recognize the name, but I don't know from where. BA says it's a farmhouse ale that was only brewed once, so I order one. It is served to me in a 12oz pint glass, and it looks good. A finger of white foam that goes tot he top of the glass atop a full pour of golden orange beer. It's translucent and has plenty of bubbles rising to the surface; I'm expecting some high carbonation. It smells sweet and spicy with a bit of floral hops hidden in the back. Wow, there is a really interesting taste to this beer. It has a strong malt character reminiscent of some other high quality farmhouse ales, and a unique aftertaste that is bitter and alcoholic. I bet that is the Sorachi Ace hops showing their stuff. It has a full body and decent mouth coating properties. I can see myself drinking a few of these, but not too many. It feels strong, and the aftertaste may not feel so impressive after a few rounds, but if you see this one on tap, I recommend getting a pint. It's another great Brooklyn beer.","ToasterChef","Sep 02, 2009"

The taste is more grain, lemon zest, mild funk, an intense bitter finish; it gets deeper and more complex as it warms. The carbonation is full, and it's medium in body: good to start off well-chilled, in this respect, but that's kind of at odds with the temp. at which it tastes best.
