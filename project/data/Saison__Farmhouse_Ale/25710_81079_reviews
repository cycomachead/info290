"Overall I love this; I like Logsdon a lot and this is their best beer by far. The nose is perfect; would love to get this one again sometime. Hope it comes to NYC more often."
"Overall - A tremendously enjoyable beer, I would be very curious to see how it ages.  I'm sure the peach aroma would fade, but the brett more developed brett character could add many layers of complexity.  4.75 paws."
""
""
"Overall another rock-solid brew from Logsdon. Worth the trouble hunting this down."
""
""
""
"T/M/O: That is a lot of Brett. And a lot of peach. I guess it's an accurate name! The two dominant flavors battle throughout the maintaste, neither particularly winning, though perhaps the Brett in the long run. Funky, dry, and very fun. Peach is a nice touch, but I think I prefer straightup Saison Bretta. Still. A great beer; recommended."

"O- this is all about the peach, and it showcases it brilliantly, one of the best of the style IMO"
""
""
""
"Drinkability – This is a pretty good sour – a style that I’m generally not a huge fan of.  Goes down easy for 10%abv."
""
""
""
""
"One of the biggest let downs I've had. Smelled like delsym cough syrup and tasted like peach perfume. Not pleasant at all. I'd did look very pretty though."
""
"Overall, this is a fantastic fruited saison. I wasn't sure how I would like the peaches in the base since I didn't especially like the base beer, but the spice and funk really mellows and enhances the natural flavor of the fruit. This is a terrific beer."

"One of the more unique and well made beers I've had of these style. A rich beer that pours like a meal."
""
"A beautiful and delicious beer, full of peach taste and especially aroma. It's an amplified version of Seizoen Bretta which is already one of my favorite beers. The brett dryness and fruity taste are perfectly balanced. What's especially wild is that the beer's appearance is opaque and pulpy from all the peach bits floating around in it. Just don't expect a ridiculously strong and sweet peach juice taste, as this is still certainly a brett beer that just happens to have peach as one of its main ingredients. It's all in perfect balance here, and they clearly hit what they were going for. And this really doesn't taste like 10%, I could drink it all day. Crisp, fizzy, fruity, funky, just delicious."

"Awesome aroma of peaches and apricots. Totally hazy light peach colored body. Spicy peaches at first in the flavor, tartness is assertive. Brett flavors come out more in finish. Very nice though a 750ml was a bit much to finish by myself :)"

"Wholly peach and brett Batman. These two equally dominate the smell and taste with some alcohol esters. Not really sour. Very balanced and good."

"something about me and certain fruited wild ales that i just cant get over. this is one of the best ive ever had, a truly unique brew, maybe the best example of peaches in a beer ive ever seen. its hazy and pale, heady as they come, faint glowing orange. im smelling the fizzy ripe yellow peach, sweet and like nothing else nature produces. the brett is intense, mature, getting tart rather than just funky. there is also this creamy vanilla aroma that is supported by a heavy wheat malt base and patience. the flavor is an oh my god moment, or series of moments each sip. im floored by this, its so unique. the peaches and the brett are elevated well beyond where they have gone in other beers, to the point of being explosive on the palate. i like the bottle more and more as it drinks down too, the dregs being almost my favorite part because of how alive it all seems to be. the peaches and brett are the perfect combination, its just incredible. my mouth waters for more as i write this. effervescent carbonation and a puckery dry finish thats about as expressive as brett can be. nothing subtle about it, but expertly refined. i absolutely must get my hands on more of this magic!"

"A big thanks again to Jeff for this hyped and hard-to-come-by brew. Certainly worthy of praise, this is one of the more unique peach ""sours"" I've come across. Not so much tart but really uses the sweet peach character very nicely."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, best before 1/2019. Pours slightly hazy golden orange color with a 2 finger dense and rocky white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big juicy and lightly tart peach, apricot, pineapple, lemon zest, white grape, pear, green apple, white pepper, honey, bread, hay, straw, grass, light musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with awesome balance and complexity of fruity/spicy/funky yeast, peaches, and pale malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of lightly tart peach, apricot, pineapple, lemon zest, white grape, pear, green apple, white pepper, honey, bread, hay, straw, grass, light musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of yeast spiciness and slight tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of peach, apricot, pineapple, lemon zest, white grape, pear, green apple, white pepper, honey, hay, straw, light funk, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of fruity/spicy/funky yeast, peaches, and pale malt sweetness; with a great malt/yeast spiciness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly slick/prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome fruited brett saison. All around great complexity and balance of fruity/spicy/funky yeast, peaches, and pale malt sweetness; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"O: Not sure what to think about this given how long it took me to chase it down. It's definitely good but the flavor isn't as complex as I was led to expect."
""
""
""
""
"This one hit the spot, the nose is unbelievable, 10% is completely hidden, not sure if I'd age this one with the peaches kicking ass right now, another one of those beers I want to drink the day its bottled and five years down the road."

"The flavor notes are fruity with notes of peach and pear juice. Softness and funky brett character are present in the flavor with some nice mild tartness. Notes of wood are present with some nice sugary sweetnes. Great dry notes. Chalky and soft yeast notes with some good carbonation."
""

"Light body with very fine carbonation. Very refreshing, leaves the tongue very clean and ready for the next sip."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a fantastic beer that perfectly matches the acidity, dryness and funk of the brett with the freshness of peaches and it reminiscent of matching cheese and fruit. While this beer was difficult to find it was definitely worth the effort."

"Verdict: Sensational saison from Logsdon and one of my favorite beers ever. The peaches are showcased perfectly without undermining the base beer or the style and crossing over into a wild ale. This is definitely a must try and just a spectacular beer."

"T: Opens with a tart note of peach and peach skin with a trace of underripe raspberry peeking through. A big wave of barnyard funk follows and it leaves a dry, tannic feel on your tongue. Soft oak, brett, peach pit and chalky malt. Everything is really well balanced and the peaches are a great addition. Mouthfeel is medium with some tight carbonation that allows all of the flavors to come through without being too distracting. The slightest bit of warmness on the swallow is the only trace of the 10%. A really well done beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a cloudy orange with a large white head. Aroma of mildly tart peaches upfront, some wild yeast, and a little oak - peaches mostly though. Flavor brings out potent peaches upfront, quickly transitioning to tart peaches, lots of brett and a little oak. Extremely peachy and mildly wild, with loads of complexity. Finishes mildly tart and wild. Extremely high drinkability, with no alcohol presence whatsoever."
""
"Very hazy amber pour with a nice two finger head that sticks around for quite awhile before receding to a lasting ring. Palate is peachy, spicy, moderately funky, with a beautiful balance among the three. The tartness is somewhat restrained, but its level works perfectly. One of the best peach sours I’ve had the privilege to enjoy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Excellent drinking experience, one of the best peach beers I think I'll ever have the chance to try. It's a nice improvement on the base Seizoen-Bretta, and I can't imagine the peach will stay around for much longer. This is a beer I definitely recommend drinking fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: One of the better saisons I’ve had. Fruity, funky, spicy, earthy, buttery and dry. I can see why this is so highly regarded. Having never had this aged, I’d still say drink fresh. The brett would develop further, but at the cost of the peach. Wish I had more. Cheers."

"Overall, this is just a fantastic beer. It brings to mind just how disappointing it is that brewing with fresh fruit is such an expensive proposition, because when done well, beers with fresh fruit are hard to beat. This one is no different, and whoever thought of adding that distinctive yeast known as Brettanomyces to a peach-infused beer was a genius. The natural characteristics of the fruit work well with the funk of the brett. I will likely buy this every time I have the opportunity, as it is outstanding."
""
"Word to the wise: despite what the bottle may say, this is not a beer to be aged. Peach fades fast, so drink this fresh! Age the base beer instead."

"2014 Vintage. So happy I snagged a bottle of this...apparently only a few cases made it to the central valley this year. Pours a hazy golden color with a large white head that goes down fairly quickly. Scent is AMAZING! Packed with wild yeast and peaches. Especially as this beer warms, the peach aroma builds up and the brett comes out beautifully. Taste is a little more tart than the aroma would imply...which is never a bad thing. Peach skin and funky farmhouse flavors up front. Slightly tart peach flavors with great farmhouse flavors and barnyard hay. This beer is not spicy at all... straight up fruit, barnyard, and funk. So damn tasty. The peach comes out more and more with each sip. Mouthfeel is a bit dry and full-bodied. Drinkability is very high, as the ABV is well-hidden. This 10% farmhouse ale is not boozy in the slightest bit. Overall, Logsdon never seems to disappoint, especially with this one. Such an amazing farmhouse ale. The peaches shine brilliantly in this one. Believe the hype."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, never had anything like this before and it definitely lives up to the hype however i've heard that this year's batch was better fresh than last years. Left the farmhouse with plenty of bottles to see how they age."
"Moderately sour upfront, lightly bitter in the aftertaste. Definite peach taste and aroma, seemed a little more prevalent in the taste. Overall a great wild ale, Brett wasn't all that expressive but you can't go wrong with a peach sour ale, imho."

" Having a saison showdown this week and this overshadows Prairies Eliza5beth pretty substantially. Still have a few more which may stack up against this, Convivial Suarez and Le Saissonier coming next."
""

"An orchard in a glass. Lovely, fragrant nose that is pure, high summer peaches. The color is a golden amber, not unlike a Bellini. The taste is very fruit forward -- one of the biggest peach-flavored beers I've had this side of Chez Monus. You can almost feel the peach juice dribbling down your chin. Absolutely lovely. The sweet peach is firmed up by a bit of Brett funkiness and the barrel oak. This is as close to summer as you are going to get after a long, cold winter. Great beer, but I think I still might prefer the Seizoen Bretta a bit more. The subtleties of the saison are drowned out a bit by the intense peachiness. Still, a great beer."

"Edit from 4/12/14. As others have noted, this is not a beer to age or sit on. Sampled one of two bottles I still have left from the most recent release, and the peach flavor is already starting to subside a bit. It was stil tasty, but when very fresh, the peach flavor is prominent and just amazing, whereas now it's just one more voice in the flavor profile chorus. Still good, don't get me wrong, but when very fresh, this beer is just out of this world."
"Overall- Great beer that is definitely worth the 20 bucks. I would definitely take one of these over any Cascade beer (not that they're necessarily comparable but in regard to the price point). Reminds me a lot of La Fin du Monde which also doesn't have great complexity but is exceptional at the few things it does do. A must try if you can get your hands on it. While I'm scoring this lower than what I scored Seizoen Bretta, I'm under the impression that this is a better beer. I will have to sample the regular Bretta again to compare."
"This is a lightly watery feeling brew with an abundance of carbonation. It is sadly cabonic an overall just ok. I have tried to approach this brewery with positive anxious thoughts but everytime I try their goods, im left underwhelmed. I would drink this again if given the opportunity but really, I dont see this as anything special or worth going out of your way for. Perhaps this was an off bottle?"
"This is a 20 proof beer?? No way - I could easily down an entire bottle of this without complaint. I would love to have a fresher bottle and open it right away, but the Brett here seems to build on some wonderful, creative aspects towards the beer's development. This could easily be the best beer Logsdon has made so far, and it's impressive that they've made a beer of this caliber so drinkable, and readily available for any occasion, as well. Excellent stuff!"
"To me, this beer is perfect because I can read a fucking label."

"This beer might be as good as it gets for me especially in terms of style. Logsdon makes an unreal saison. Their brett version is one of my top ten beers I've had and I love peaches. This beer delivered all of that. The color of the body almost had a peach skin note to it. The beer smells of fresh peaches. The taste is everything that is great about Seizoen Bretta but with beautful peach and floral notes. I can't recommend this enough and can't wait to get myself a bottle."

"Medium bodied with a prominent musty brett character along with dry oak and sour peach.  The dry brett flavor is really strong with musty funk perfectly complimenting the farmhouse yeast.  Oak is dry/toasted but blends nicely with the bugs and funky yeast notes.  Peaches come in at the end with a luscious organic feel.  Not cloying or overly sweet with some sour acidity lingering in the finish. Slightly puckering with pit and fleshy fruit flavor.  Very complex but it's one of most balanced beers I've ever had.  Flavor and mouthfeel are nearly perfect.  I wasn't a fan of regular Seizoen or Seizoen Bretta but I highly recommend doing whatever it takes to try this one."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is an excellent beer and I'm glad I got the chance to try it. I still can't get over how drinkable this is. I had to stop myself from gulping it down too quickly. Definitely recommend seeking out a bottle or two."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Had very high hopes for this beer...not bad at all, but a bit of a letdown considering my expectations. Not nearly as peachy as I had hoped...overall quite dry and earthy in character with a strong alcoholic aspect that detracts a bit."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a well-made beer, but as a lover of puckering sour beers, this just does not get there. It has a high ABV and a saison finish, but it does not have the intense sour fruit notes I enjoy."
""
""
""
""
"Rollicking fruit Saison, if a little too big for its boots. Bemused as to why this needed to be 10%"
""
""
""
""

"O: Fruit is less prominent than a bottle opened a few weeks prior, but still very enjoyable."
""

"Overall this is a great brew, I see it as a nice sipper on a warm day. I would definitely drink this again."

"Bought a bottle from the brewery and shared it five days later in a hotel room with one other; Logsdon Farmhouse Ales, Hood River, USA. As part of a six-week West Coast beer tour. I rate to taste, not to style. See my blog for more details: carbeers.wordpress.com"
""
""
"Drinkability is high, it's really hard to believe this is 10% ABV. Not to mention how subtle the brett and sweetness from the fruits are, no palate wrecker here, just extremely balanced. What an elegant beer, fantastic."
""
""
""
""
""
"Big thanks to Jedwards for the final pre-move blowout cellar crash. Pours a hazy tangerine hue with a loose, quarter inch, bright white head that dissipates into a consistent slick. The nose on this beer is fantastic - peach cocktail. Taste is lightly tart with peaches and perhaps apricots. Mouthfeel is light and lively with an assertive acidity. This beer is pretty incredible I have to say. I don't get much Brett, but lots of peach and an extremely well-hidden abv."

"O- The flavor and aroma are nice, but not as complex or pleasant as the Seizoen Bretta I had just two weeks ago. The mouthfeel held this back for me quite a bit, a little too watery but a nice brett beer. Can't believe this is 10%, it drinks like a 4%, very light."
""
""
""
""
"Pour is hazy golden yellow with a tight slightly off white head. Nose is light of peach fuzz, light dusty funk, cobweb, faint cheese. Taste is light, soft peach, dusty Brett and faint cheese, assertive carbonation, fairly dry finish and a well done light sourness through the back."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: an enjoyable beeroverall. The peach and Brett go well together, creating a light, tasty, and enjoyable saison."
""
"O: Exceedingly--nay, dangerously--drinkable. A very well executed farmhouse ale. The fruit is prominent but not overwhelming. I guess if I had any complaints, it would be that I don't get a lot of oak character, and the brett is pretty minimal."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a pretty darn good beer. I was really hoping that the peaches would be ridiculously over the top, but it wasn't. Still... the flavors are great and the brett funk is just right. I am incredibly happy to have been able to try this beer, and would love to try it again in the future."

"Drink- It was a good beer, but again didnt blow me away. I think letting a bottle sit, might help. I truly feel this wouldve been better as say a wild ale with more of a light flavor and more peche behind it. I am glad this was at a share and not a traded bottle."
""
""
""
"O - Overall, a good beer but not quite worth the hype. I have a few bottles myself and I think Jared just got an old bottle as there really should have been more peaches in this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow, what a truly unique and amazing beer. Perfect amount of peaches and a nice compliment to their wonderful Brett profile. I thought this one was a huge improvement over the Seizoen Bretta (although that was still very good). Took me by surprise, but I hope I'll have the chance to enjoy this one again. Top notch."
""
""
""
""
""
"This poured out as a hazy orange color with a white sticky white head on top. Nice thin retention on top. The smell of the beer is sweet, fruity and has a subtle grainy backbone in there. Some really nice aromas on this one. The taste of the beer is mellow, there is a nice sweetness from the Peche and a very subtle tart Brett finish. Very smooth mouthfeel, very drinkable. Overall it's very good. Really enjoyable brew."
"Overall. A very nice saison with plenty of peaches. Nothing too mind blowing, but a very high quality beer like everything from this brewer."
""
"Near turbid golden with a central dome of light cream foam and little lace. The nose is really nice, peaches, apricots, brett, seltzer, vitamins, tart tones and just a touch of sweetness at the end. Nice tartness on the sides of the tongue, some brett watery character, some bits of lacto style yogurt character and plenty of peach, but the peach seems unripened. Medium on full bodied with hi carb that dissipates quickly and leaves me quite dry - this forces me to take another drink...sadly/not! Nice beer."
""
""
""
"Overall: Other than the flavor profile, this is a really solid saison. I can only hope that a fresher batch would be tastier and hope to track one down at some point."
"8.4/10"
""
""
""
""
"O- Nice saison with some tart and sweet peaches."
""
"I will say as it warmed it improved modestly with some more funk notes permeating the palate , but unless you can get it on the cheap and don't have to give up much in a trade, i'd rather just spend that money on some RR varieties with a good sushi lunch ."
""
"Overall: Really glad that I got to try this beer! Its the best beer that I have tried from Logsden! Fastastia just edged out the Peche 'n Brett in the side by side."
"Had side by side with Fantasia and I give a slight edge to Fantasia. I'd say worth seeking out if you don't have to pay an arm and a leg. Base beer is great as well. Thanks egrace84."
"D: This is a very drinkable summertime beer. Its quite pricey for a bottle of this but well worth it in my opinion."
"O- One of my new favorite peach beers, I've loved everything so far from Logsdon, this was a real treat."
"A very nice beer, but maybe not all the way up to the hype."
""
""
""
""
"The beer is hazy and light orange with a small white head. The aroma offers peaches, brett (shocker), wild yeast, funk. Straightforward in both the aroma and flavor. Really nice. Juicy peaches throughout. Mild acidity with fairly low carbonation. A touch of spice in the finish. Mild bitterness as well. Really tasty. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone"
"Pours a murky light orange with a foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour, tart, and slightly funky with peach and Brett aromas. Taste is much the same with a fermented peach flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is light and refreshing despite its ABV."
""
"Overall not bad, but not as good as I expected. Drinks well, but peaches are too light, and funk isn't as much as I expected either."
""
""
""
""
"Less peachy, more Brett forward than when fresh, slightly sulfury/ farty with the peach being more of a tart peach/ character than the bright, complex redolent peach character that it had fresh. That said, it's still fleshy and mildly frothy. The palate still has a ton of peach, but it does seem to have lost some of the brash brilliance of its youth. The peach juice has fermented out, leaving an earthy, spicy Brett character. Moderately sweet nonetheless, this is still very good closer to a 4.3 than 4.6 fresh. Yeast character is moderate and a faint heat are noticeable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a top tier wild ale, no doubt. I think I prefer Mimosa a tad more, and Oak Aged Bretta more than both. I absolutely will be seeking this out again soon."

"O: Really a great beer, one of the best I have had recently, certainly lives up to its reputation. Look forward to trying the other Logsdon Saisons."
"O: After tasting this beer at least 5 times, it's safe to say: ""a terrific beer"". Considering the ""best by"" dating on all bottles extends 5 years into the future, ALL are pretty 'young', so it'll be interesting to taste them again in 2, 3, 4 years (or more). Suffice to say the 'peach' is upfront right now, the tartness zesty and aggressive. Thank goodness there are a few cellared to taste later. Well played, Logsdon."

"A+"
"Pours a light straw color, orange-ish, really. Very cloudy. Nice big head. White. Lots of small bubbles. Creamy. Very good lacing. Quite a pretty beer. Nice aroma of saison funk and smokey peaches. The peach character is fresh and deep. It has a very light smoke fruit character. Lots of yeast earthiness. A bit mineral-ish. It's a cultured peach flavor. Not terribly jammy or pungent, but a rustic citrus peach wood flavor. Taste starts with sweeter peaches and turns to sourer drier territory quickly. Finish is lightly bitter. Peach skins. Light mouthfeel. Very smooth and nice for the abv. Very happy to try this one. Big thank you to westcstbrlvr. This is another excellent beer from logsdon."
""
""
""
""
"Less peachy and more saison apple-tartness than I remember, but still very enjoyable. Dangerously drinkable at 10% ABV. My wife really liked it. One of the best farmhouse ales, at least Top 3, that I ever enjoyed."
"M: Medium bodied."

"It was hard to drink this one slowly. Amazing balance, totally delicious. Doesn't supersede the base beer for me, but I love how they integrated the peach. Not at all overdone."

"Hazy peach body - thin layer of beige bubble. ""Tastes like a Logsdon beer"". The brett is in full force - aging this beer seems foolish. The glorious peach notes hit in the finish and are a real nice contrast of sweet-tart. Grassy, funky, some oak, bready notes. Fantastic stuff."

"O- Highly recommended. Im curious to see how this one ages. Its so good though that im afraid my last bottle will be gone too soon to find out!"
""
"O: awesome. I was expecting this to be a bit of a letdown. So talked up, I generally assume that it can't actually be THAT good. This one lived up to it's reputation. I would put this above any other Saison I've had. And that is how I would characterize it after drinking it. Reads as a beautiful Saison with fruit. The Brett is apparent, but if you put this next to their other brews, the comparison would be obvious I think. Interested to see how this ages as the fruit fades and the Brett takes a funkier and stronger role."

"Poured a murky gloden orange in color with pale yellow highlights a half finger of bubbly head that left good wisps of lacing sticking to the glass. Good funky bretty character and peach fruit were noticeable upfron on the nose with hints of spice, herbs and wood oak with nice tarf qualities. The peach fruit was more apparent on the palate with good bretty barnyard funk, slight spice, hints of citrus zest alongside great oaky accents and a touch of apple pear flavor. The brew was medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a oaky, fruity, bretty funky, slight spice and tar finish. These dudes really now how to funk it up!"

"In past years I have given this beer a 4.5+, but I'm not crazy about the 2015 release.  Smells great, but tastes very perfume-y, and that aggressive Logsdon brett strain comes across slightly soapy in this case."

"Huge, huge thanks to boralyl for this one. Served in a cervoise. Pours a slightly-cloudy light peach color. Wow. Let's start that way. Nose has huge peach plus earth and mild funk. Dry and a bit creamy. Dry. Touch acidic. Some wheat. Incredible. Logsdon has really got some good things going."
""
"O: This is incredibly well-balanced and easy-drinking. There's no hint of the 10%. The brett and fruit are at a perfect level of expression. Very impressive, something I could drink all day."
"o - really great peach flavor. feels like peach vodka with fresh peaches swimming in it."
"Overall I would have liked a little a little more peach flavor to balance the saison backbone but that aside this is probably the best Farmhouse ale (and definitely the best organically produced beer) I have ever had. I wouldn't call it a wild ale, per say, because it was more rustic and less overly sour or tart. The fact that this was 10% was ridiculous, it drinks like 7% max. Not a drop of alcohol. I would say crack this ASAP as I believe the peach flavor is fading and the Brett is really taking hold. I definitely plan to seek out more beers from this new Oregon farmhouse brewer."

"O- Definitely the most surprising beer of the two day tasting, which included the 4 BA DL'S, Rare, BA Speedway, Damon and many other good ones. The 10% is nowhere to be found in this. I sure wish I could have had more than a couple ounces of this stuff. Fantastic beer and one I'll be seeking out in the future."
"Overall - Great fruit flavor, but the beer itself isn't necessarily great. Tasty, but definitely could be a better beer."

"O - Not a peach explosion as I remembered from Batch 1, but a nice balance and very layered. Super brew!"
""
"Simply phenomenal. I wish I could drink this by the barrel."
""
""
""
"O: Goodness in a bottle, and I wish this wasn't such a limited release. Definitely not a beer for people who hate this particular stone fruit, though. I'm hesitant to age my other bottle because I'm afraid the peaches will disappear."
"O - Amazing peach-saison of some sort...I wanted more but the bottle was crushed in 1 minute! I guess I'll have to track one of these down for myself...my wife would love this stuff."
"O-Goddamn this is a good beer. THe peaches are so prevalent and taste. The brett characteristics are spot on and again the peach is so tasty. This beer is dangerous at 10%. Luckily it was hard to come by. This one and one for the cellar until the next release. David Logsdon touche."
""
"D - Perhaps one of the most drinkable 10% beers I've ever had. I really enjoyed this, and probably would consume an entire 750ml bottle if I didn't know there was a monster hangover waiting at the end. I think some age might reveal some added complexity. I liked this a fair bit more than Seizoen Bretta."
"O: I would have liked a little a little more tartness and sourness for a wild ale, but it was really nice overall. The fruity sweetness from the peach was really a treat (I really like peaches). Definitely a must try."
""
"Overall: Exceptional. I feel fortunate to be able to try this. Highly recommended."
""
"Overall: This beer took me by surprise. I tried the base beer for this a few months back and thought it was quite good, but this is on another level. Seek this out."
"O: Grading as a saison, it's very good. I enjoy it a little more than the base beer, but not for twice the cash. Not that price is a problem with this beer. If you saw it on the shelf and didn't buy a bottle, you already missed your chance. Recommended if the opportunity presents itself."
