4.41,12.2,4,4.75,4.5,3.75,4.25,"I've been eager to try this one for quite sometime...  Two fingers worth of big fizzy slightly off white colored comprised of big and bigger chunky bubbles...  Decent retention...  The color is pale hazy lemony straw yellow...  A light to moderate bit of carbonation can be seen towards the top of the glass in small streaks...  The aroma is led by a big punch of lemon zest at the forefront...  Some hay and fresh cut grass...  Some very subtle Belgian yeast undertones...  The aroma is world class...  The flavor profile is almost equally exquisite...  The lemon zest is again at the forefront...  There are rich layer or grassy and earthy notes...  The faint Belgian yeast is also quite noticeable palate...  There is a faint bit of candied sugars as well...  The faintest hint of pepper on the deep finish...  The end result is a very nice, deeply complex and world class flavor profile...  The mouthfeel is on the fuller side of light bodied...  Spry with loads of prickly carbonation...  A bit chalky throughout...  Color me impressed by this offering...  This is a top notch Saison that I would welcome in my glass anytime and one that I would also highly recommend...","philbe311","Jan 10, 2015"

4.25,8.1,,,,,,"In sum, one of the best hoppy saisons I've ever had the pleasure of drinking. The yeast and hops work really well–hop selection here I think was key, as the use of more grassy, clean, and lightly fruity hops play well off the yeast's spiciness. A super beer that is great to see in 4-packs.","hagbergl","Dec 14, 2014"

Not a bad initial taste but very off on the finish.  A metallic taste that lingers with something that was off.  Had a decent saison smell, although still something off, overall barely got over a 3 from me who is generally over average and definitely for this style.  Maybe it just caught me on a bad day but for me there was something off that I could not put my finger on.","JamieDuncan","Dec 13, 2014"

On the bitter side of the scale, and not for everyone, but offers something different to enjoy. Not the easiest drinking beer out and its heavier carbonation bloats slightly. However, good if you're not drinking many, and would pair up well with a spicy vegetable curry, stir fry or some grilled kangaroo which has a charred and grassy/gamey taste to match.","baumaxx1","Oct 18, 2014"

Aroma of saison yeast, orange citrus, light sweet malt, coriander and clove; spicy. Flavor starts spicy and semi dry, develops semisweet citrus and fruit with a bit of funk the finishes dry with wild yeast funk and saison spice bitterness. Medium bodied with peppery carbonation. I really like the flavor progression on this saison, with both dryness and light sweetness alternating. Good fruit and malt flavors and a just enough funk to give it character. Stillwater was the first brewery to turn me on to the saison style and this is an example of how they succeeded. Nice domestic saison.","LiquidAmber","Sep 24, 2014"

Smell has some apricot and a full fruity yeast aroma, banana, hay and pale malt, sweet a bit with also a ton of complexity. Taste is got a hefty carbonation with some banana and grape flavours, some cinnamon and bready malts, some peach and slight barny flavours, a bit of a hay overload before coming to a full finish with a bit of a high hop bitterness, finish then dries out. A ballsy full flavoured saison, some of the alcohol comes through and eventually it become apparent this is not up to the highest standards despite a full flavour. Pretty solidly built saison though, lot of flavour and good stylistically, perhaps my criticisms were a bit too harsh as it's quite tasty.","mick303","Jul 23, 2014"

4.1,4.3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 9/4/2013. Pours fairly hazy/cloudy bright gold color with a 3 finger dense and fluffy white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon zest, tangerine, orange peel, pear, apple, black pepper, clove, straw, grass, herbal, floral, light bread, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast ester, hops, and light-moderate malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big lemon zest, tangerine, orange peel, pear, apple, black pepper, clove, straw, grass, herbal, floral, bread, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Good amount of yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, tangerine, orange peel, pear, apple, black pepper, clove, straw, grass, floral, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity of fruity/spicy yeast ester, hops, and moderate malt flavors; with a great yeast/hop flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent saison! All around great complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, hops, and moderate malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 12, 2014"

I smell grazing cattle and white wheat in equal proportion, nothing out of the ordinary, but some real creative stuff here too. almost a Belgian triple, with candy sugar and spunky yeast. I taste wheat malt on the lighter side and a flocculated yeast that just adds tannic funk and coagulated protein density to a beer that should be real delicate otherwise. not a brewers error, but a critique nevertheless. great carbonation and a medium body that would be heavy if it didn't work so damn well. overall a great first beer from this crew, and something I am real eager to get back into. special stuff, and being American made makes it epic compared to its peers. worth your hard earned shrappy!","StonedTrippin","Sep 04, 2013"

3.67,-6.6,4,2,4.25,4,4.25,"this beer pours a lightly hazy copper gold, exactly what i expect from a good saison. it has a huge head, thick, white and pillowy so be careful while pouring. Excellent lacing, the head takes about a minute or two to die down to a finger so thick it looks like you could peel it off. it certainly isn't going anywhere on its own... The smell was that of nothing more than a golden ale. Spice and little else which makes the taste, perhaps even more enjoyable than it is on its own cause, guess what, its a ruse. This is one complex and nicely balanced beer. I am usually not one for spicy beers so saisons are tricky for me. This one has a nice sweet malt flavor, the spice is similar to maybe a belgian dubbel. It's strong, but well complimented. There is also some decent hops presence here. Actually, nothing is very subtle, its all pretty strong but at levels that don't out do one another. Now, with a beer like this you can either add the yeast at the bottom of the bottle or not. This will do one of two things depending on the freshness of the beer. This one is still only about two months old and i made the mistake of not checking before i added the sediment. In the case of a young beer it is going to make it spicier. However, if you have a beer that's been around a little longer, 6 months to a year, you're going to get some added banana bread-ish sweetness and body which is what i was going for without really thinking. Oops. still good but i'm now having my second and enjoying it much more. Mouthfeel is nice, a bit sticky, full, small carbonation. Overall, a really ideal saison. i have a new regular.","Monalenard","May 07, 2013"

They are both farmhouse ales, and the styles developed in extremely close proximity to each other. This beer just happens to taste like the farmhouse ales of France more than those of Wallonia, Belgium. This is a tasty beer, just not a great example of the Saison style.","Reaper16","Jul 11, 2011"

The flavor was a nice balance of yeast character, grainy malt backbone, enough hop bitterness to balance, some lemon and grapefruit citrus, light spiciness, and a wonderful tart dry finish.

4.25,8.1,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"The palate is rather unique. Surprisingly juicy from the hops, there's a little grape-like character present (from the Nelson Sauvin, I guess?), as well as a bitterness that's mildly grapefruit-like. The malt character isn't as raw as the nose suggested, and it _is_ whelmed by the hops and the yeast here. Like any good saison, this is quite spicy and moderately phenolic. In fact, the first few sips have a sharpness to them that I can't really describe better. Drying on the finish with hop flavor (grapes, sweetlimes), spicy (white pepper, a little nutmeg-like bitterness) and crisp with plenty of carbonation, this is an enjoyable and refreshing beverage.

The head retention is spectacular. A massive 4 finger head erupted from the bottle and 2 inches of creamy white head are always perched on top of the liquid. The aroma is musty funky up front, almost like a closet full of clothes that hasn't seen daylight in a year. Behind the funk is just a hint of floral and herbal hops. Just a little bit of damp grass. Also at the tail end of the aroma is under ripe tree fruits. Hard pears and apples. The flavor is funky. Damp, musty earth intermingled with hard pears and dried hay. Tasty stuff but the depth of the flavor profile of a great saison just isn't there. Regardless, its tasty stuff. The mouthfeel is dry, but not cat tongue dry.

I pick up a strong herbal flavor in this brew, along with some lemon peel, peppery spice, grain/bready malt, bananas, and some grassy hops. Very tasty brew.

Fully clear orange rust to zinc color, pales to a yellow tinge around the rims, there's a wealth of bubbles but no beads at all, more like softly falling snow. But going up. Silky smooth nostril presence, fits like a $1,000 suit, which in some ways may not be for the best, as it makes it harder to grab the scents and identify them. In any event, there's suave orange, tangerine, lemon citrus spray, a biscuit and scone breadiness, well blended banana, pineapple, peach, nectarine, yellow apple, cherry fruit scents, no clearly dominant force, no real chocolate but the coriander, cumin spice sweet enough to cover, clean with nary a trace of funk. In the mouth it's medium-bodied and the carbonation foams up quickly, certainly contributes to additional perfume, yet forestalls your ability to really get into the flavors. That said, über-friendly orange, lemon, pink grapefruit citrus as well as apple, pear, peach, apricot, cantaloupe fruit. Anise, mint, chamomile more prevalent here. The yeasty notes soften as well as add cling factor. If you can acclimate to the level of carbonation you'll find that it is a fairly dry beer with good outline and length.

But that served to highlight the wine-like, acidic quality of the beer. Next time, the beer was colder and I managed a better pour. In that pour, the flavors were much better integrated. Nevertheless, I think it is the citrus/wine acidity that makes this an especially different saison. Food pairers be on the the lookout, this will go with lots of good, spicy foods.

At the same time, there's nothing too deep and most of the flavors are fairly subdued, failing to produce many of the hard-hitting flavors I really look for in a saison.

3.95,0.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"pour is clear and yellow orange with a large head of very thick head at first that seems to be less and less assertive as the bottle gets pour. not as it sit for a quarter of an hour but it seems the carbonation is rich but gone fast. nose not as farmhouse funk and hop fused as others but the hop character is predominant and brisk floral. grassy lemon zest, and a tad herbal but nothing that could be pin pointed. rosemary, thyme or sorts. hearty earthy meat herbs and floral palate. tight on the tongue and cleansing to the point that you want to accommidate the dryness in the mouth. a bit harder on the gums than i would like for the style but still a step above and american. a good example but i lacks the musk i enjoy. or more so does not have the amount i would expect. the herbal quality seems to be broader in that. this is just a soapy interpretation. i like saisons and you should try this only if you are in search of that american fashion of it. that is if jolly pumpkin isn't enough.","rtepiak","Sep 18, 2010"
4.22,7.4,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"A very good American saison. Stateside is a light orange beer with big frothy white head. It has a very professional, tattoo art-inspired label. The aroma is fruity with some funk and spice. I smell peppercorns, grapes, lemons, sweet melon and fresh grain. The funk is light, though definitely present. It tastes light to medium dry with good bitterness and funk. The flavor is a bit rounder than the aroma, but it could stand to be drier. I'm having a good time drinking this beer. It's refreshing and full-flavored. The hop choice is interesting without getting in the way of the style. This was a happy surprise.","popery","Sep 08, 2010"
3.76,-4.3,5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Slightly hazy amber color with a huge white head that had very good retention. Plenty of lacing is left on the glass. Looks fantastic. Aroma is herbal, woodsy, with a little musty note in the background. The taste was a little bit of a letdown. Heavy phenolic with an almost overwhelming herbal quality. Hay and pepper as well. Dry malt charactor. Bitterness is balanced. Medium body with a soft carbonation that goes well with this beer. Not the flavor profile that really appealed to me. It would probably be a good pairing beer for those so inclined.","morimech","Sep 03, 2010"

4.1,4.3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Picked up a bottle at Abe's Cold Beer and split it with a couple friends. This amber ale has a tall white head and a very spicy character. I'm reminded of Coronado's Hoppy Daze Belgian IPA for the big citrus hops mixed with coriander. While the hops rule along with the the Belgian spice character, there are also subtler, earthy notes. And while this is delicious, I think it's distinctly American.","tempest","Aug 24, 2010"
4,1.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Drinkability is pretty good. Certainly thirst quenching. While I hesitate to fault them for the dry minerality that most fail to achieve when then attempt the style, this starts out to such an extreme that it dampens the taste until I pour some yeast in with the second half of the bottle. I recommend to serve it 'mit hefe' by rolling the bottle gently on the table before opening.","ccrida","Aug 24, 2010"
3.86,-1.8,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Drinkability is good. This is a fairly refreshing saison with the generous hop addition. Definitely a well crafted brew, but it doesn't quite have the complexity that it's Belgian counterparts contain. However, for a new brewery to kick off with a beer like this is fairly impressive. I'm excited to try a few more of their offerings. Worth checking out.","sisuspeed","Aug 21, 2010"

This has nice yeasty flavors that combine with citrus and faint herbs. The bitterness and abundant carbonation provide a nice mouthfeel. This is a very refreshing saison.","malloyca","Aug 03, 2010"
4.2,6.9,4,4,4.5,4,4,"The beer pours a yellow color with a white head. The aroma is yeast with some spices and citrus fruit.

4.5,14.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D-great saison, everything you want to see, strong yeast presence, nice bit of hop balance with a solid spicy herbal showing accompanied by a nice peppery spice in the back. the doughy forefront and citrus afterplay give it the balance and complexity you want to see.","cpetrone84","Jul 30, 2010"

3.93,0,4.5,4,3.5,4,4.5,"F: Mostly dry finish, slight lingering creamy malt though. Some spices still there, with a touch of toasted malts lingering. Slight sticky feel as well as the sugars disappear. Slight bitterness, perhaps from hops or just the spices added to it. Almost a slight wheat lingering too, with some Belgian golden malt flavors lingering. Again saison like but not really farmhouse.","jlindros","Jul 09, 2010"

The smell is nice and refreshing full of lemon zest, slight amount of funk, earthy tones and citrus sweetness. This tastes very nice, simple not as much complexity as it smelled but still great. Lemons and funk come through with a nice yeasty zest to brign it all together. So easy to drink, light on the tongue and perfect for a summer day. I could drink this all day and would if given the chance.","thepeter","Jun 21, 2010"

3.7,-5.9,3,3,4,4,4,"Poured at a recent BA tasting event. Pours a cloudy lighter yellow with a nice bubbly head. Nose is citrus and funk.

A tiny pinch of sourness and has a pleasant grassy aftertaste that lingers a bit.","squaremile","May 14, 2010"
3.4,-13.5,4,4,3,3,3.5,"d - A decent saison but nothing special. I thought it had a nice smell to it, but not much to the taste or mouthfeel. Not bad at all and very drinkable, but nothing special and I wouldn't look to try again.","mdfb79","May 12, 2010"
4.38,11.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Amber/golden color with a huge head that seems to go on and on and on. I was concerned it might be infected at first. Moderate spicy and earthy aroma. Mildly copper/mettalic like. Very solid malty flavor with enough spiciness to be quite noticeable. Some caramel sweetness though the whole thing. Phenolic and peppery notes. Velvety smooth creaminess considering the spicy bite-quite a solid mouthfeel to it. Just a great US saison. Lives up the the hype I have read about this beer.","lackenhauser","May 10, 2010"
4.33,10.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"D- This is an awesome local saison. Much like a hoppy belgian, amber ale. There could be more funk present to make this better for the style-but the beer as is is really good. Saison is one of my favorite styles-I've had the good, the bad, and the ugly... this is a VERY good brew...though a bit of a different example of the style.","PittBeerGirl","May 08, 2010"
4.5,14.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"All around a solid as far as this beer goes. The beer pours honeyish gold with a thick white head that evaporates fairly quickly. Smell is kind of like freshly cut bales of hay. Taste is somewhat sweet followed by a bitter taste with a flavor not unlike chamomile but stronger. The mouthfeel is pretty smooth with a bit of an alcohol burn in the finish. The beer goes down easy enough that going back for a second won't be hard to fathom at all. Another example of a good maryland brew","hdofu","May 05, 2010"
4.18,6.4,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Tried this one at the recent City Paper Brew Fest in Baltimore. It was one of my favorites of the day. I believe this is one of the first Saison's I've tried.

4.13,5.1,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"This is a nice Saison; it certainly will be enjoyable to those that like all Saisons including American interpretations. Having said that, for some reason I was expecting something with a paler malt character and a little more hop aggressive; I really like Nelson Sauvin hops and was hoping this had this hop featured as a signature note. Instead the hops, while substantial, play on an equal footing with the yeast character and to a lesser degree the malt (which does actually become quite a bit more noticeable and complex as this warms). It is a bit weird that I feel a touch disappointed from this fantastically tasty brew, due to my preconceived notions on how I would have brewed this particular beer (meaning a Saison with Nelson Sauvin hops). In the end this is very enjoyable and I am quite happy to be polishing off a 750ml bottle of this.","Gueuzedude","Apr 06, 2010"
3.45,-12.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"D - Pretty decent farmhouse style ale, although I found it to be a bit heavy on the earthy notes. Still, this was pretty drinkable overall, though not one of my favorite saisons in the grand scheme of things.","ffejherb","Apr 04, 2010"
