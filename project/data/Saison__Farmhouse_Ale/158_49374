The yeast calms down as it warms up and develops a nice spice/pepper flavor which pairs nicely with the citrus/pineapple/bright fruit flavors  .  Overall this is a really nice saison with the refreshing fruity characteristics that is making me start to enjoy the style alot more.  The funky yeast can be the hardest part of enjoying this style, but the yeast here mellows out nicely, so I 'd definitely recommend this to people who are on the fence for the style.

Scents of banana, honey, earthy yeast, wheat, citrus peel, mango, pineapple and floral hops. A rich, bright, fruity aroma with a good yeasty character as well. Quite nice. Flavor begins nicely sweet with spicy, funky Belgian yeast, moving into a more sour funk, with notes of citrus, pineapple, honey and wheat malt. The finish is spicy, with notes of coriander and some floral notes. Aftertaste is floral and spicy, with coriander notes. A very good, relatively complex flavor profile, very much a Belgian and a solid example of a saison. Very well executed. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with moderate, prickly carbonation and a semi-drying feel. Very good and true to form for a saison. Overall this is a good saison. Great Divide managed to make a saison with a good deal of complexity, a nice flavor and aroma profile and good mouthfeel. A truly excellent beer.","Auraan","Apr 05, 2014"

This is a bit strong, but also very good; at 7.3% abv, it's not something I'll adopt as my summer beer of choice, but was a good call to have with dinner. Very happy with the beer, but it's certainly, as Great Divide says, their interpretation of the style rather than an authentic one.","pvo","Mar 24, 2014"

In case you've never had a good farmhouse, it tastes sort of sweetly tart, mild in body and flavor but oh so refreshing. Pairs great with meals since it won't overpower much, but still strong enough to stand alone. Smell is wonderful too, intoxicating. Cheers!","Johnny_Muir","Feb 16, 2014"

Enticing aromas of citrus zest and ginger entice the nose with hints of grass and a strong underying yeastiness. The taste is very yeasty with some spiciness. A slight sour funk follows the taste all the way through to the finish. The finish has a lot of lemon zest as well. The mouthfeel is lighter than I had expected and it dries the mouth out a bit. The carbonation, however, is perfect. Not too much or too little. Overall, I was very happy with this beer.","silverking","Feb 03, 2013"

3.32,-13.8,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,"nope. this one pours a thick hazy yellow color like a lemon, with yeast floaters and a small white head. smells really yeast, and not nice wild yeast like a lot of other saisons, but like rotting citrus fruit and shampoo. that said, there is some element of refreshing aromas, but the yeast spoils it for me. flavor is not bad, tart and crisp lemon notes, mild spice, and some crystal malt body. not sure how this one got so far off track, but the feel is not nice either. way way to thick and heavy for the style. this is supposed to be a crisp drinkable early summer beer, but it fails to serve that purpose. this might be my least favorite great divide beer so far, which is unfortunate. i had really high hopes for this one, as i am huge on the saison/farmhouse style, but this was a real letdown. might be better from the bottle rather than the tap?","StonedTrippin","Apr 02, 2012"

A bit of lacing clings to the glass as well. Aromas of huge grass, lemon, pepper, spices, bread, a bit of funk and some light fruits(apple, grape). Very nice and complex aromas here. Taste of grass, lemon, pepper, spices, grape and a slight bit of funk. Very slight bit of tartness noticed on the finish. Lingering notes of spices, lemon, pepper, and breadiness on the finish for a decent amount of time. Quite refreshing and easy drinking for the alcohol level. Medium carbonation and body.

4.08,6,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a very pale straw. A almost snow white head was on top, fairly thin, but lasted well. A bit of cling to the sides Fairly constant streams of carbonation rose from the bottom. Aroma had hints of a fruity sweetness. Also noticed a bit of yeast and just a tad of alcohol. Flavor was multi layered. Started out a bit like a hard cider, hints of sweet apples, with a finish of tartness. If it warmed up it became sweeter with less tartness.

I also got some toasted grain and a nice yeastiness. Flavor echos the aroma but with a tartness that you wouldn't necessarily get from another saison such as Saison Dupont. The tartness allows you to come back for more without wearing on your palate.","BeerAmbassador","May 26, 2011"
3.03,-21.3,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Pours a straw color with minimal white head. Nose is mixed citrus, with a hint of human bile & pineapple. Some barnyard on the nose too.

3.86,0.3,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer. It is more toward the hoppy Saisons that remind me of some Tripels, but this is still a solid attempt at the style. I suspect that they are using their Belgian yeast that was in Belgio (sp?) on this beer too as I was getting the same bread dough notes in the aroma, but that may just be a finishing yeast for this beer as the Saison yeasts never attenuate all that well. Either way, this is a pretty decent beer and I will enjoy the whole 6-pack. I doubt I will be buying it again...at least any time soon, but I am glad that I tried it.","SkeeterHawk","Apr 21, 2011"

The aroma is full your typical of a saison, lemon up front with biscuit and hints of pepper with slight hops kicking around the back of the nose. This smell has a lot of lemon up front in it. The taste follows the aroma nicely. Yeasty with a bit of spiciness and finishes with a bit of lemon zing. The abv on this is higher than I realized, but I would think it is much lower by the taste. This isn't really anything out of the ordinary but it seems to be done very well.

The beer itself was a cloudy golden color, reminded me of a hefe. Smell wasn't too strong, but what I did get, was hints of wheat and malt. Not too much on the hops. Taste was somewhat wheaty and fruity, maybe a slight sour bite to it. No detection of alcohol what so ever, which is impressive considering it's over 7%.

3.05,-20.8,4.5,4.5,2.5,2,2.5,"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Boulevard Tank 7 tulip. This beer pours a slightly hazy, lighter then School Bus Yellow with a massive 4 inch cap that leaves fingers of lacing all the way down the sides of the glass. The aroma was pretty prevalent from the pour. A slightly sulfuric aroma poured crept from the bottle right after opening it, just the way I like it. Damp earth, lemon zest, a hint of ground black pepper all mixed together with baled hay. I rather exciting nose from a American Saison. It has my hopes up. Unfortunately the flavor let them down rather considerably. The flavor profile seems to be a muddled jumble of flavors that are never really defined individually but do not come together as a whole either. Up front is the all to sweet mark of quite a bit of pale malts. It underlies the entirety of the flavor profile. Milled barley, slight clove, white pepper and just a bit of coriander. Almost no citrus or grass. Just a bit of wheat tang, no fruit and for some reason the after flavor really bothers me. I cant quite put my finger on the flavor but it irks me something badly. The mouthfeel is hands down the hardest aspect to nail on a Saison, and this one misses the mark. Medium bodied with almost a creamy aspect, not really dry at all. Sugary. Where are those high temperatures they were talking about. Other then the spices, I really don't think esters play that much of a role in the anything. I know I'm hard on Saisons. They are my favorite style and I really do love GD, but Colette just doesn't do it for me.","hwwty4","Jun 15, 2010"

This one says it was bottled in April 2009 that's fine with me a style that probably does okay with a little age. Aroma has a nice yeast spiciness label states that they used a blend of 4 yeast strains, I'm definitely getting some Saison Dupont characteristics with a citrus/tropical fruitiness. Sharp wheat edge with a nice spiced backend, ample sweetness a touch of biscuit drizzled with honey that herbal spice component is intresting almost lavender with a touch of black pepper. Flavor is dominant with the spices but bursts of honey biscuit malt and tropical fruit pineapple blend nicely with the spiced herbal additions. Yeast gives it that funky peppery slightly nutty edge that overall works well together a perfect beer to combine with most foods. Mouthfeel is slightly creamy with tart and sweet sensation over the palate dry yeasty finish, moderate alcohol. Medium bodied carbonation carries this one quite well, not really cloying to me at all.

I was expecting it to be a fully Americanized saison, the kind my local brewery brews and tries to pass off as a saison, when it just tastes like a slightly stronger witbier.

The initial nose makes me think of a pilsner, but the malty and hoppy notes are pushed aside by the expected sour notes of this farm-house ale. The body is medium-light with a pleasant lightly-sour lingering. Definitely an ale for food. The sour notes are more restrained than I expected of a Farmhouse Ale/Saison. The ale is quite tasty.

4.13,7.3,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"22oz bottle. Bottled on 4/15/09. Bottle conditioned. Served in a Duvel Tulip. Poured a pretty pale straw with two fingers of puffy white head. Wheaty spice in the aroma with some lemon, also a bit of sugar as it warmed. Slight hop flavor, also some yeasty funk. Fairly complex flavors. Light bodied, dry and refreshing. I enjoyed this.","homebrewhawk","Jun 28, 2009"
3.67,-4.7,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"D - Perhaps this brew needs a little more age to tone down the hop profile, but it just wasn't the most balanced saison I've come across. Enjoyable, to be sure, and a pleasing summer evening sipper. The nose really is remarkably good, though.","vrazionale","Jun 25, 2009"
3.97,3.1,3.5,4,4,4,4,"In the mouth it's medium bodied and gently zesty with a fine-bubbled carbonation that gently bristles the tongue. It's refreshing, and fits perfectly well with the rest of the beer.","NeroFiddled","Jun 19, 2009"
3.69,-4.2,3,4,3.5,3.5,4,"D: Sure its not the most dynamic Saison out there but it does what it is supposed to : it makes you refreshed on a hot day. Can't bitch about that. Sure the look, flavor and feel could use a bit of work, but the beer works. Its not the best Saison out there by any means but it works in a pinch and makes me happy. I am not upset by this beer at all, maybe just a touch let down. I figure that Great Divide will play with this brew and tweak it a bit as they are known to do. I see it as a work in progress and I expect it to get better the more they brew it.","everetends","Jun 14, 2009"
3.77,-2.1,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"M/D: Light to medium bodied, carbonation is actually not too prickly. Drinkability is decent. Overall, a decent Saison. A bit too sweet for my liking in a Saison. It has everything you'd think you'd find in a Saison, it just needs some more balance.","NCSUdo","Jun 11, 2009"

3.95,2.6,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Many thanks to Erik from Flying Saucer for the hook-up, 22oz bomber into a Duvel snifter pours a hazy straw yellow with a nice frothy off-white head. Aroma is lemon peel and sweet malt. Taste is a nice amount of sweet fruit, crisp spice and yeast funk that leaves a tart, sour finish. The beer is just as crisp and refreshing as the style calls for, the tartness is a little on the astringent side, however. This is an enjoyable Saison, just not as good as I hoped it would be coming from Great Divide, oh well, it is still enjoyable.","atsprings","Jun 02, 2009"

3.19,-17.1,4.5,3,3,4,3,"One bottle is enough to satisfy a hankering for a saison. Wouldn't make a session out of this beer, but it's a drinkable beer, 650 mls is enough.","BetterDarker","May 28, 2009"
3.75,-2.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"This Saison is brewed with Barley, wheat and rice using 4 unique yeast strains and fermented at a higher temp. It pours a cloudy yellow body. The aroma is light lemon and earth. The flavor is hay, lemon, grassy bracing hop bitterness, spicy yeast, and a light tartness. Light grainy body with crisp carbonation. Overall, I found this to be a pleasing but unremarkable beer. GD has spoiled us with so many outstanding beers over the years, I was expecting something truly remarkable here. Perhaps that expectation was unfair, but this beer feels like a letdown.","BradLikesBrew","May 27, 2009"
3.55,-7.8,4,4,3,3.5,4,"Not really impressed by this offering. Some what adjunctish flavor and aromas. Just a bit on the syrupy sweet side. Pours a clear yellow with a fluffy tan head. Taste and nose are quite sweet with a subtle Belgian yeast and floral hop presence. Some fruity spices. Medium body is overly carbonated.","rye726","May 24, 2009"

2.96,-23.1,4,3,3,2,3,"Overall, not a bad summer beer, but not too interesting for a saison - a little too sweet and the sweet sugary fruits don't jive well with the yeast funk.","Beaver13","May 15, 2009"
2.97,-22.9,4,2,3,3.5,3.5,"Great Divide churned out a turd in my opinion. Its funny how they can make 'grand slam' beers like Yeti and Titan, but make average beers like this and Samurai.

Overall, there are some good positives here, specifically with the yeast. But some negative, with the rubbery flavors (and the lack of more yeast). Still drinkable though.","Oxymoron","May 13, 2009"

4.1,6.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Bottled April 15. Very decent new Saison from Great Divide- a style I like very much, and what I find is a great hot weather beer different from all of the wheat beers out there this time of year. Pours a hazy pale straw color with a fairly nice pur white head that fades to a ring. Nice fruity nose of bananas, a touch of lemon, straw, and some coriander. Alittle citrsuy in the taste as well, especially up front, with some sweet banana and light grain and spice in the finish. The tiniest bit sour and very clean in the mouth. A relatively simple but tasty Saison. It is a touch on the sweet side, but the nice citrus finish helps make it very refreshing, balanced, and keeps it interesting.","Georgiabeer","May 10, 2009"
4.27,10.9,3,3.5,4.5,4.5,5,"From the day Great Divide tapped the Saison, I've had 2-3 a week. It's a great beer that's fun to drink, and it's refreshing enough that I like having more than one in a row. It's got a little citrus / sour taste to it, with some great carbonation and a beautiful color. Overall, a great beer.","HookedOnWinter","May 09, 2009"
3.7,-3.9,3.5,3.5,4,2.5,4,"D - all in all the flavors of this beer carry its drinkability. its mouthfeel definitely needs some work. the dominate yeast flavors (the label claims to have used 'a special blend of four yeasts') really give you the impression of a witbier of some sort. i wouldn't call this beer 'true to style' by a longshot however, it is a decent beer. go in without expectations and you might just like it... as for me? 9 bones can get me a beer much closer to style.","Jettanbass9","May 08, 2009"
4.05,5.2,3.5,3.5,4,4,5,"D- very high, would get again if i was in the mood for something a little different, If i was looking for a straight up saison, i would turn to Dupont of Hennepin.","bonsreeb85","May 05, 2009"
3.75,-2.6,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"I wouldn't say this is a great saison. Maybe it just needs more time in the bottle. However, it's not a bad beer for what it is. At this price, I probably won't buy it again.","GilGarp","May 03, 2009"

3.78,-1.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"22oz bottle $7 with a cool label that has a yellow checkered theme that reminds me of Dupont. Thick white head and a super cloudy whitish yellow color. The smell is just slightly funky, dusty, earthy, smells pretty much what I would expect for the style. The taste is quite refreshing or at least it makes me think I have been refreshed. Its been a long week. Nice yeasty, spicy flavor and goes down very smooth.","ArrogantB","Apr 24, 2009"
