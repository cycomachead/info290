"One pleasant, and sweet tooth indulgent Saison, I gotta say.  I've passed this one over on many trips stateside in recent years, only to find it on my virtual doorstep now.  Easy to drink, complex, and duly satisfying, in a world-wide sense, maybe save the part of Belgium who might have cause to complain of the smallest infraction."
""
"Dark gold draft pour with thin white head; some lace. Funky sour nose. Clovey and tart, with a white wine sweetness. Lite mouthfeel. Tasty lightly sour and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
"This refreshing beer reeks of tropical and citrus fruits."
""
"Surprisingly delicious. Golden hue and bright, refreshing finish."
""
""
"Really nice farmhouse ale. Nice sweetness and a little tart to even it out."
""

""
""
"Tank 7, this just might be a summer romance getting started..."
""
""
""
""
"It did not taste good."
""
""
""
"Beautiful white towering head stands above the light amber liquid. The head stays around the whole time and prolific lace coat the glass. Smell and taste is wonderful fresh bread and fruity esters with a touch of honey in the aroma. Silky smooth and very drinkable this beer is worth repeating and sharing!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"There was just something about the aftertaste."
""
"Was not expecting the odd flavors. May have to try another to make sure. Spicy Orange notes. Not a fan. Sorry"
""
""
""
"I couldn't decide if I could find myself a fan of saisons or not, but Tank 7 has won me.  Absolutely deliciously fresh.  Will definitely be buying again."
"Very nice! A pleasant surprise found at my neighborhood store.  Very smooth and drinkable...but beware, that ABV will sneak up on you.  :-)  Highly recommend."
""
"This showed up at Zeppelin Hall. Best Boulevard I've had. More robust and stronger than other farmhouse brews I've had. Recommend."
""
""
""
""

"Big Tank 7 Fan Here. Always good."

"Poured from bottle, quickly rising to two fingers of foamy head with strong retention and lacing. Aroma is a mix of tart, fruit, and a hint of malty sweetness and Belgian spice. Taste is not tart, but pleasant and lightly sweet; most resembles a saison. Feel is moderately carbonated and medium bodied, easy to  drink and not boozy for 8.5%. Overall, a good farmhouse ale."

"Nice balance and a smooth crisp feel, this slid across the tongue with almost no carbonation, a light to medium body and a nice sweetness from the overall complexities in the brew that minimized the farmhouse elements and brought the fruity notes up front. Boulevard just started to get distributed in NY and I looked forward to trying this and it lived up to the hype. A very tasty beer that I will definitely have again, and a great American version of this style."
"Light amber with great lacing. Fruity floral aroma hops. Grapefruit bittering hops with biscuity caramely malts. This one has great feel to it."
""
""
""
"Very nice rendition of a farmhouse. Fuller bodied but still to style. Nice!"
""
""
""
""
"Awesome beer.  So glad Boulevard now distributes in NY."
"Apricot smell. Grapefruit taste. Awesome head and golden color with a hint of orange. Lovely."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is the perfect Saison. This beer made Boulevard one of my favorite breweries."
""
""
""
""
""
"A great saison.  True to the Belgian style but has a hint of American hops.  I would rate this higher but it is a tad boozy for a style that I think should be more sessionable."
"O: an excellent saison - hits all the right points, well-balanced and very drinkable"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle dated best by 9/23/15.  Bright, hazy straw colored body with a billowing white head.  Typical peppery spice, lemony, yeasty smells for a saison with an underlying incredibly hoppy bouquet. A lot of tropical fruit all around coming out more in the taste, specifically after you swallow.  Mango and citrus, slight banana yeastiness, great carbonation, absolutely refreshing!  My personal favorite of the style, permanently secured because of its generous use of hops."
""
""
""
""
"Get this when you find, very good."
""
"My first ever saison!!! I really enjoyed this beer, nice subtle hoppy citrus tones with spicy and peppery tastes on the finish maybe some banana in there. Pretty complex but overall delicious and easy drinking to me. Will definitely  buy another bottle of this to age."
""
""
"Hazy light orange coloring, thick cap (about two fingers) that settles into a broken raft. Bready aroma with peppercorn, fresh herbs and slight citrus. A bit more citrus in the taste as well as tropical fruits, and biscuit. Very crisp dry finish with a fair amount of bitterness lingering. Welcome to NYC Boulvard!"
"Delicious beer. Highly recommended, actually."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Complex and enjoyable at every sip."
""
""
"Crisp, juicy, and dry. Higher alcohol and slightly noticeable ABV, but still very refreshing if you're in the mood for something a bit stronger."
""
"O – Had this before, long ago, but this time it’s a revelation.  Complex, fresh, beautiful, and very drinkable, this stands with any of the best Belgian saisons."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A superb farmhouse! This style is hit and miss for me, but Tank 7 is the standard bearer for me."
""
""
"Favorite farmhouse ale Of all time!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"That's an example of a farmhouse saison."
""
""
""
""
"O: Very nice american version of a saison. I like to see interpretations of this style instead of reproduction of the classics and this one did it well. Nice fruity hops with a bit more alcohol."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On guest tap at dfh Fairfax poured into snifter. Slightly murky orange-yellow with a white head that settles to a collar. Dots and streaks of lace. Aroma is tropical fruit, Belgian yeast, spice, and pepper. Taste is spicy, fruity sweet, and peppery with peach on the swallow. Medium body, foamy texture, moderate carbonation, dry finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very enjoyable beer.  This style has so much variability I'm not sure what is normal, so I can't really comment on its appropriateness for the saison style."

"Poured hazy golden orange. Lots of bubbles from bottom of Sam Adams glass. Fruity smell. Sessions and other fruity beers not my favorites but this one has enough going for it to be pleasant. Got better as the glass got emptier."
"Brew pours a hazy honey-golden in color with a good 3-finger white foamy head that finally settles down to 3mm after a good 20 minutes or so. The aroma is of lots of Belgium yeast, floral with some citrus zest. More going on with the taste as the sweet floral hops is right up front with some grass and lemon zest for the finish. Actually goes down easy with no bitter or harsh aftertaste at all. Medium-bodied with good carbonation. One of the BETTER 'Farmhouse Ale' style brews I have had since they seen to be not as good as this one."
"One of the best U.S. made saisons not made in Greensboro Bend, VT. A classic for good reasons."

"Tasty beer. No doubt about it. Drank it alongside one of the best burgers of my life at Pen and Quill in Bmore and it was amazing.  Two thumbs up!"

"Overall:  Really enjoyed this beer… Will buy when available.."
"OVERALL:  Tank 7 is an intensely satisfying beer.  I've only said this about a handful of beers in the past, but this is one that is truly greater than the sum of its parts.  Every time I reach for this beer I am happy I did.  It may not be the most rare, highest ABV, barrel-aged, hoppiest thing in the world, but it oozes class and consistency.  I know that it will be great every time, yet it still surprises me each time I reach for it.  This is one of the timeless classics of the American Craft Beer movement.  Long live Tank 7."

"A quintessential Saison, hits all the read notes with the bready, earthy malt and the dry fruit.  Mostly citrus in this instance.  Great mouthfeel, crisp medium carbonation, finishes pretty clean.  A great American take on the style."
""
"Extremely  complex flavors with a floral nose...High alcohol content is well hidden...be careful! great beer!  I was pleasantly surprised!"
""
"Boulevard has hit Eastern OH (and by default Western PA)... I was really looking forward to this. Poured a golden amber into my tulip. Two fingers of glorious white head that hung around for quite a while. This has a big, bready nose with a nice spicy note (coriander I would imagine). The yeast is also very present and accounted for. As the glass warmed a bit, some nice mango notes began to break out. The flavor was awesome. Big, strong bready backbone was supporting a tropical fruit medley... spicy notes from the yeast and just an overall clean presentation. The mouthfeel was smooth, definitely coated the palate and lingered a moment with a funky little punch that let you know you were drinking it. Nothing else to say, except that this came together into a fantastic beer. Get it."
""
""
"One of the best examples of the style I have had."
"Enjoyed this one a lot. Pours beautifully, a hazy gold. Very fruity, floral aroma. Taste is that of hops and clove with fresh citrus fruit mixed in. Overall this was an extremely pleasant experience."
""
""
""
"The body is as light and fluffy as the head but not insubstantial.  It's dry but creamy, with the juiciness cutting the dry edge just enough.  The finish lingers gently with some herb and spiciness.  Crispness is even and bites just a little all the way through."
""
""
""
""
"Boulevard just started distributing to NJ, and this is making a great first impression. This will be a regular Saison in my rotation."
"Far more complex than most examples of the style I've tried of late. Love the fruity character the yeast provides. The finish is more peppery bitter than I'd prefer."
""
""
""
""
"O. Really good farmhouse ale.  Would go real nice in warm weather by the grill.  Need to be careful though as goes down way to easy for the abv."
""
""
"A decent Belgian ale not a fan but worth a try"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Massive fluffy head with loads of lace. Smell and flavors are huge and fruity with yeasty esters. Noticeable hop flavor and bitterness. Good complexity. Feel is beautiful like a belgian style beer should be. A top notch beer for the style. An American made saison that stands up to the ones made in Belgium."
""
"Not my favorite beer by far"

""
""
""
""
""
""

"Golden color with good amount of bubbles. Semi fruity smell. Taste has some banana to it. Overall a good beer. Reminds me of Drunk Monk by 3Floyds."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fruity, saisony, hoppy, one of the best modern takes on a classic I could drink this any time of the year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The finish is quite crisp, a bit dry, and leaves you with a lemon tartness and flavor over an ever so subtle funk."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a great brew. Boulevard really seems to know what they're doing with these styles. Well executed. Recommended."
""
"Grapefruity goodness; but I typically like my beers less sour."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, a great saison, clean, crisp taste with yeasty flavors and dry finish."

"Fantastic beer, my new favorite!"
""
""
""
"Bottled 10-22-14. Poured into a tulip glass. Hazy golden yellow color, took about 10 minutes to pour a 12 oz bottle because of the great head of white fluffy billowing foam. Great retention and lacing. Aroma was a bit funky, piney and fruity. The taste had some lemony, peppery and spice notes, with just a tinge of malty sweetness. The mouthfeel was fairly light, somewhat dry, with crisp carbonation. This is one of my favorites of one of my favorite styles- just love this beer!"
""
""
""
""
"Lemony funky nose gives away some of what is to come next. A big earthy farmhouse ale that looks and tastes excellent. Lots of carbonation and an unfiltered view from the glass. There is a punchy brightness that makes this a perfect beer to accompany a meal, should you be so inclined. Hops hold up well amongst the bready elements."
"While I prefer IPAs, this beer was quite good.  Nice flavor and very drinkable"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great fluffy white head and lacing. Sweet aroma of pear, yeast roll, peppercorn and malt backbone. Tastes of peaches, lemon zest some spicy pepper notes and an great malt backbone. Carb level keeps the sips nice and interesting while providing a lush body."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Solid, though nothing stands out as a unique take on a saison."
""
""
""
""
"As a non saison fan, this beer has been consumed by me a number of times."
""
""
"Favorite farmhouse because of the balance and character it reveals in the mouth and going down.  Rich and spicy and walks the line between golden and saison."
""
""
""
"O: Its very drinkable I've never been crazy about Saisons but this isn't bad. It's nicely balanced "
"Way stronger than it tastes!!! A wheat apa with a kick"
""
""
"Smell didn't do it for me. Awesome color and smooth but overall not feeling the beer overall. Maybe just an off day. Didn't truly care for. Love other Boulevard beers. Not this one though."
""
"Great farmhouse beer with an incredible amount of head"
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy yellow with a large white lasting head. Aroma is of citrus pine, some ripe fruit, yeast and pale malt. Taste same as aroma with a bit of spiciness, citrus floral hops bitterness. A medium body on the palate, good lively carbonation. Finish is sweet citrus and fruity, mild spicy peppery, some tart notes, pale malt, yeast, has a ripe fruit flavor on the ending with a slight dry bitterness. Overall a good full flavored saison."
""
"Great beer. I don't have much bad to say about it. Would defiantly buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Amazing saison. Smells of lemon, Belgian yest and fruit notes. Taste is heavy on the lemon, grapefruit and Belgian yest with a little bit of that saison pepper. More thirst quenching than water basically."

""

"Would absolutely seek out and purchase again."
""
"Pours a hazy yellow with a nice amount of head that trails the glass as you drink. The smell is full of all sorts of smells. Grapefruit hops, a bit of wheat, some spice, and pepper. The taste was just as complex with a bright start with hops and yeast flavors, then mellowing to banana flavors mixed with spice and pepper for a remarkably clean finish. Absolutely loved this one."

"Pour is hazy yellow to straw colored.  Aroma is spicy, floral and hops with malt balance.  Taste is hay like with spice upfront and malt with hop balance and mild spice in the middle and finish with herb and earth notes throughout.  Mouthfeel is medium with a good carbonation to cut.  Overall a wonderful saison and a beloved offering from Boulevard."

"This beer strike the perfect balance between traditional Saision and American craft beer ingenuity. A golden amber beer with a medium-light body and light tropical fruit flavors.  American style dry hopping on the finish with some black pepper spice notes."

"Pours a bubbly four finger head over a gorgeously colored hazy yellow gold body. Exquisite lacing all the way down. The overriding impression here is of a sort of hybrid saison, one that has certain IPA-like qualities: floral, tropical, and citrus notes, and a consistent spiciness. It's like the flip of a Belgian IPA -- rather than an IPA that has a Belgian quality to it, it's a Belgian-type farmhouse/saison with an IPA quality. A unique beer. I'm in love."

"11/2/2014.  12 oz bottle purchased at Full Throttle Bottles, poured into a goblet.  Pours with two fingers of dense, white head with a few large bubbles here and there that lingers.  Massive Brussels lace on the sides of the glass, that stays a long time.  Golden hued and slightly cloudy.  Fruity aroma of apple, biscuit, yeast, apricot.  Floral hops notes.  Nice sweetness up front that stays around with the finish that also has a little bitterness from the hops and a little acidity.  Moderate carbonation - almost fizzy but just short of it.  Light body, on the dry side.  Long finish.  Wow - it's like I'm in Belgium!"
""
"O: Tank 7 is a slightly offbeat version of a saison that manages to stay true to the style, but is also somehow unique."
""
"Wow liked this beer very dry with a nice  hoppy almost spicy finish. I did not know its 8.5 percent after a few sips I can feel it in my head. Smooth easy drinking and very pretty in a glass. The aroma is very similar to what I was getting on the flavor. Cheers try this one and enjoy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (3.32) : A bit disappointed. I had high hopes for Tank 7. I've had better Saisons and this one is just too hoppy and too heavy on the burnt alcohol flavor. I re-checked the bottle after I poured because I could smell the alcohol right off the bat. Yeah, 8.5 is right. It's giving me a touch of heart burn. The flavor is there but the alcohol takes it over pretty forcefully, destroying any yeasty goodness it may have yielded. I'll probably not have this again."

"I don't have a lot of experience with this style, but what I've had so far has been really enjoyable. This is an outstanding beer that comes from a brewery I am liking more and more."
"Overall this is an awesome beer that is a must try if you enjoy this style!"
"Sweet, fruity, spicy and bursting with grapefruit and citrus aroma.  Almost like an IPA/Saison hybrid, highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"lived up to the hype"
""
""
""
""
"Bright golden color with some white froth. Pleasant fruity and lightly spicy yeasty aromas; grassy, herbaceous hops; and clean, light, crackery malt. Tastes good - yeasty, fruity, almost completely dry, with nice lingering noble hops flavor and slight bitterness. Terrific balance. Nice freshness. Good length. It's nice that one of the best saisons made stateside is so widely available."
"An excellent saison, exactly what I want from the style."

"Really good beer."

"O-  a solid American saison offering."
""
""
"Overall – This is one very nice, fruity, but drier and nicely flavor blended and funked brew.  This is a nice saison that is super easy to drink at 8.5 %. Delicious and dangerously good."

"Overall and Drinkability:  Overall I find this a very drinkable beer.   I definitely like the touch added by including some American hops here and I’m now about half way through a case and still enjoying the Tank 7 beer every bit as much as I liked the first bottle, plus I’m finding a growing appreciation for the complexity of the beer as my experience with it grows and deepens."
""

""
""
"Pours a clear gold with big fluffy head, settles to a dense cap, spay of thick foam down the glass. Smell: soapy, dried pineapple, floral, spices -not for cooking or baking but some bs bathroom smelly crap. This beer smells like your grandmother's bathroom. If you were eating dried pineapple in it, instead of whatever you're really doing. Taste: mirrors the nose...just a ton of spices that don't mesh, dried sweetened pineapple, pils/pale overly sweet. Sticky candy finish after the spices fade. Fruity without definition, overly sweet, overly spiced. Phenolic like a bpa. Ratings don't compute because this is not a good saison."

"Overall: While excellent, this saison would easily blend in with the higher quality pack were it not for a few very small surprises, such as the minty taste in the finish. For fans of the style, it's definitely worth having. For others, it may feel forgettable as it fades away nto the fruit and spice conglomeration of the other saisons they've had before."

"The booze is here and by the time I got to the end of this (I did split part of it with a friend), I could feel a nice, gentle amount of warming take hold. No matter - this was great stuff and a treat for those of us here on the East Coast who are new to Boulevard. Good enough to be confused with an import and simple enough for anyone to enjoy, this is what a good Saison should be about. The aroma wasn't anything memorable but everything else was and I'll probably give this a go again sometime soon in the near future."

"After hearing much about it, I finally had the pleasure of trying this now that Boulevard is being distributed in NJ. Paired excellently with a Thai Massamun curry dish I was eating. Will definitely purchase again and a beer worthy of keeping stocked in your fridge at all times."
""
""
"Overall: Really good hoppy saison. Not worth going to great lengths to get, but definitely with picking up if you come across it."

"O - a solid offering of an American made farmhouse ale that offers a classic Belgian aroma and flavor with letting you explore the real creativity of Boulevard 's yeast. I'd drink this again. Definitely a good offering."
""
""
""
"Simply Perfection"
"O:  A pleasant Saison.  Some may be put off by the strong peppery finish but I found it quite satisfying.  Not one of my favorite saisons, but still another quality offering from Boulevard."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Light and clear. Fruity and spicy saison. Peppery finish, lingers nicely. One of the best that I've had / what a saison should be."
""
"The taste is dry and tart with some pale malts and yeast but starts out sweet then bitter good."
""
""
"really an awesome beer! super hoppy yet not bitter.....fuity dry....its really wonderful!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall pretty tasty.  I like the hopped up version of the style, but it is a little buzzkillington if you are looking for a more traditional saison."
""
""
""

"Juicy and tropical yet it still keeps its rustic appeal. Absolutely phenomenal Saison!"

"This beer has great aroma of citrus, piney hops, yeast funk---love it! Anything with these attributes shows a great craft towards old-world style. And the best part, it is available year round at reasonable 4pk prices instead of uneconomical ""bombers""."
"I'm addicted to this beer right now. I have been working myself out of an IPA rut and this beer is a great step away."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste: Incredible depth and balance to this beer. It does not fizzle out like many American attempts at this style. This is a full-bodied, crisp and refreshing example of one of my favorite beers of all time and definitely a world class example of the style. Boulevard has impressed me with their consistency and portfolio as a whole."

"I haven't had this for a while because I usually don't buy large-format or 4-packs that exceed $10, but hey, 4-packs on sale today! The first time I had this my wife and I were in the mountains for a wedding during the summer, the whole town shut down at 8pm, and all we had was a frozen pizza and a 750 of Tank 7...and it was an excellent dinner. I'm no less impressed by Boulevard's legendary farmhouse tonight. Lovely soft haze, pineapple-meat yellow, and an airy head make this ale look as appetizing as it tastes. The nose is really so complex it's hard for me to sort out, but I get a lot of tropical mango-fruit and floral notes, and the spiciness just gives it that extra edge over a lot of others. Assertive for sure. Mouthfeel is smooth and velvety, nice carbonation, and bordering on thick. Alcohol is apparent in flavor, numbs the tongue and takes your breath away a little at first, wouldn't call this beer ""hot"" though. Tropical and light citrus fruits (notably lemon) play against a spicy backdrop. Really nice beer. And three left!"

"O: Bought this beer in a build ur own four pack and so far it is my favorite. This beer is a must drink!!! Get it!!"

"Bottle as an extra in trade. Forget who. Thanks. I’ve had this sitting for a bit so I’m 9 days past the Best By date. Didn’t seem to matter. This was good stuff. Pours hazy yellow with a massive fluffy whir head. Aroma of hay, yeasties, barnyard, very straight forward. Flavor is very nice and refreshing. Yeast, hay, dusty barnyard but balanced out by a bit of honey, fruit esters, pears, apples, and a bit of light spice. Light bodied and high carbonation. A really awesome beer here. Easily my favorite from Boulevard."

"This saison swings more toward the French style. Greater clarity than the Belgian type. Good bitterness, perhaps about 50 to 60 IBUs, with a mild Goldings nose and some more citrusy type of hop, like Columbus. Good hop complement to the more orange citrus profile of what I'm guessing is a French saison yeast, like Wyeast 3711. Sweet start and sweet finish, no tartness or barnyard funk, saved from stickiness by the high bitterness levels. Also, a bit of alcohol on the finish. Thick, long-lasting head. Generally refreshing as a strong French saison should be."

"O: Lovely beer, a top notch brew. Wish I had tried it fresh on draft at the brewery! A staple to add to your rotation of strong ales. No overpowering flavors. Predominately hops and sweet peppers. No bad aftertaste, slight bitterness and fairly easy to drink for a thick beer. A+."

"Poured into my trusty Ommegang glass.2 finger thick head.Smell was floral and sweet.First sip was bubbles with a quick taste of the typical Belgian style but not overwhelming.Pleasant and drinkable but I was very thirsty at the moment.A nice change for me since I am mostly into IPAs.I would bye again and would love to try on tap at some time."
""
"Overall this is one of the best examples of an American Saison. Get some!!!"
"By far one of my all time favorite beers. I prefer it on tap. I love the boulevard glass it's poured in. Always great. It's good in a bottle when I want it at home. It's aroma is fresh and the taste lingers on my tongue for minutes. This beer is a favorite at most local bars and pubs for a very good reason."

"Pours a clear gold from the tap with a foamy white head that lasts for a while. Lots of lacing on the glass. Smells of hay and fruit. Apple, pear and grass come through nicely with a bit of malt. Mouth is light and crisp. I think it was probably a bit too cold, but was really nice as poured. Very refreshing, very nice saison."

"This beer should be served at a slightly higher temprature than you would the normal lager beers. This allows the fruity flavors to come forward. There is also a slight hop aroma to this beer, and served cool, it is easier to notice. The main aroma are complex, some fruits and bananas, but also a spicy note. The taste is dry, you get some of the fruitiness. The body is very light. Easy to dring despite being 8.5 % ABV."

"I love boulevards beers, and I know they have GREAT beers. So I'll try to be as nice as I can about this beer. Ok, where to start.. I bought this beer for 11.99 for a 4 PACK. Yes a 4 pack. So I was thinking what anyone would think... This must be GREAT BEER!!! That assumption was wrong. TBH I flat out didn't like this beer, which almost NEVER happens...First of all its way overpriced, it doesn't go down smooth, it doesn't taste good, it doesn't smell good, and it barely even tastes like beer!.. I think the brewers were already drunk when they made this brew because its nothing like the other boulevard brews which are Great! It reminded me of beer made out of hay or straw that someone spiked with some vodka... literally. The only reason I think it says farmhouse ale is because it tastes like a cow brewed it. As a die-hard boulevard fan I am somewhat upset with this brew, especially at 11.99 a 4 PACK kind of feeling ripped off.. I'm surprised boulevard even releases this, and even more surprised with it's high ratings here?? Maybe this beer just wasn't for me but I couldn't find one quality about the beer I liked except for the label!.. If you like to spike your beers with hay and vodka this beers for you!!!"

"O- Lived up to expectations for me as a very good farmhouse / saison. Would definitely recommend."

"O: This beer is a continual favorite. It is sweet, fresh, and inviting. It is lush, but gentle. It is a complete sensory experience, it smells as good as looks, and tastes better. This is easily one of the top 3 beers I've ever quaffed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This beer is one of my long-time favorites and I am glad that I finally got around to giving it a review. The flavor is certainly on the sweet side, which I'm OK with, but those who like things dryer may not appreciate this brew as much as I do. Aroma and appearance are definite high points for me."
""
""

"O-awesome farmhouse ale by boulevard must try some the other smokestack. Had some taleggio cheese paired with it, awesome!"
""

""

""
""
""
""
"This beer does not stop with its refreshing fruit notes, with a tinge of sweetness, and then that drying on the finish. It combines to be an extremely well crafted saison. One of the best in the style. (This won over Hennepin in a blind tasting.)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I poured it into a frosty, wide-mouthed glass. The head is significant: it sits up like whipped egg whites and laced the glass very nicely. The color is amber-orange and somewhat cloudy. It has a dry, yeasty smell, and sort of ends there: there's almost no other scent of note past that, IMO. Initially, I thought I was tasting an alcohol-soaked clementine poked with coriander or peppercorns, but a few sips in realized--as described by others--it was more grapefruit overall. It feels snappy and a bit metallic, with a balanced carbonation and some gentle spice in the mix. Overall, I'd say it's definitely a precise and almost medicinal beer, perfectly suited to a warm early autumn day after you've toiled at whatever one ought to do to deserve this refined beverage."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's a well made saison, but I'm not sure I'd give it world class status."
""
""
""
"Overall a very good Saison. I like a bit more funk but this is a solid take on the style."
"O - This has become one of my go-to beers, an ale I like to keep in my stock for those times when I want a farmhouse ale.  Delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a great saison and would definitely go toe to toe with some of the big name saisons."
""
"overall, it's alright. awesome head, but the smell was generic and bland. the taste was a little different, but not very outstanding.... kind of an IPA with the Belgian yeast. I tried to take into consideration the best by date... was curious about this brewery. heard it was pretty good but the AB took over so curious to see which direction it takes from here."
""
""
""
"This really is a world-class farmhouse ale. First of all, the bottle itself is really beautiful. The pour was a hazy, yellow/orange, with a 2 finger white head. Had a very soft mouthfeel, but still refreshing. Malty backbone with a little floral component. There really is nothing bad to say about this one."
""
""
"O: This is a really good, unique take on a saison. It's unabashedly hoppy, but it retains the trademarks of the style rather well. This is a beautiful beer, on par in presentation with any hazy, foam-topped Belgian or German classic. I think the hoppiness lends a somewhat brash mouthfeel, for the style at least. Regardless, this is a very good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This beer is great and I like what is going on with it, it isn't too dry or overpowering in one respect compared to any other Saison attributes. Nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is actually my first farmhouse ale and if I didn't know better, blind review I would have thought it was an IPA. The fruity, hoppy aroma was superb. Loved it. Cloudy, golden color with a thick, white head. Lace was average. Migher than avg on carbonation. That first sip was lively. Hoppy flavor matched the aroma. Moderate bitterness lingered. I don't have any others I've had to compare but overall a very decent ale."

""
""

"Pours a pale straw with a thick white head. Good lacing. Aromas of tangerine, pepper and floral notes. Spicy on the palate, black pepper and bread that give way to lemon and clove. Very dry finish. Light bodied with effervescent carbonation. Overall, a very well crafted and drinkable saison."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A potent not-quite-IPA, it definitely has that farmyard musky/musty funk, crossed with a marzen"
""
""
""
""
"Tank 7 has always been a great example of the style. The 8.5% is unnoticeable. The feel is that of some of the world's best. The bright fruitiness and perfect balance also bring to mind some of the best examples of the style. This is one of the better American made versions of the style."
""
""
"Anyway there is a subtle undertone of that classic Belgian yeast flavor throughout this beer. It taste kind of fruity but mostly the Amarillo hops dominate the other flavors. This beer is really tasty and refreshing but I wouldn't recommend it as farmhouse ale because I don't think the Belgian flavor shines through clearly. I would recommend it as a great beer in general however."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a nice clean, fruity and peppery ale without overdoing any one flavor. Really liked it."
"Overall: A truly remarkable experience. This is one of slightly hoppier Saisons I have come across. The ale is slick, balanced, and refined. One couldn't ask for much more in a Saison/Farmhouse Ale. GREAT JOB BOULEVARD!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Damn good beer, tho it's pushing the envelope a bit. Bottle opened with a big pop at a good temperature and poured with a huge, foamy, frothy, fluffy, cream-colored head that lasts a very long time and some lace. Color is very slightly hazy yellow amber with some bubble trails. Aroma is dominated by lovely fresh hop, citrus, a bit of resin. Flavor's much like nose with again hop in front backed with some malt sweet and some bitter. Traditional saison characteristics have been supplanted by the hop domination. Body/carbonation are excellent. Finish is like flavor, hop strength carries thru for a very long time and only a little alcohol warmth. Great drinking beer. Wish we could get it locally."
"O- Heard great things, and this was expectedly very nice. Will return with some good food."
""
""
"O- solid, yet underwhelming, saison. About the baseline of what a good saison is - very no frills"
""
""
""
""
"This could pair up with a variety of dishes."
""
""
""
""
""
"A straw coloured ale with a white head. Firm bitterness into IPA territory with some alcohol warming. The aftertaste has some mild fruitiness and Belgian year character. The beer is effervescent and has a dry mouthfeel. The aroma is hoppy mixed with Belgian yeast. A very refreshing beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a great beer that's best enjoyed on its own. I would advise against trying to pair this brew with food. I found the flavor too sweet to be compatible....at least with the cheeses I paired it with."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Good beer, but I am thinking the 13.99 I paid for four may have been twice what it is worth. If the others go better. I will update the review."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours like you'd expect from a farmhouse. Light color with tons of head. Takes several pours to get into the glass. The smell is very nice. Can really pick up some spice in this one. The taste is the best for a farmhouse I've ever had. Then again I don't drink many of this style. It has that bit of tanginess with a lot of the spice you get from a Belgium tripel. The spice does linger just a bit but overall this is a very good beer. I would grab this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Light yellow color with solid carbonation and a strong, billowy head. Smells hoppy with a hint of grapefruit and orange. Wow. Great taste! The grapefruit comes through but it's not too overpowering. It's just enough to cover up the boozy taste but not too much that it blows your taste buds off. Very drinkable. Sweet and tart at the same time. Great balance. I'm a big fan of this beer at sip number two. I can't wait to finish it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A great example of the Belgian Saison with an American twist on the hops. I don't know if Boulevard uses American hops, but the flavors are a meld of our hop profiles and the Belgian yeast styles. A good combination. One of the better versions of this style done in the US."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a well-made base saison. There's no exciting twist (like Brett) or flavor additions. But the quality of the beer comes through. Recommended for someone who wants to go back to basics with an accessible example in a convenient bottle size."

"All in all, I would have to say that if you are a farmhouse ale fan, passing up this beer would be a BIG mistake. MUST TRY."
""
""

"O: Not bad but definitely would choose other more traditional Saisons. Farmhouse ales are so broad that two excellent beers can be complete opposites and although this doesn't do mutch for me it's still a great beer and worth the try. I will definitely keep buying Boulevard."

"This is a pretty good Saison, with lots of citrusy flavors. A bit more substantial than most in this style, due to higher abv, but it still drinks well. It does have a pretty fair amount of carbonation, lots of bubbles, but gets better and easier to drink as it warms in the glass. Still a tasty brew, and a beer you should try if you like Saisons."

"The smell/taste review by nsheehan below sums it up nicely but here is my review. Initially based on the smell I lost a lot of excitment for this beer. The taste then helped recover the experience. If I were to comparte this to another beer it would be the Left Hand St. Vrain Trippel, although in my mind it would be the higher end version. Definitely worth a try, I would probably have again, but glad I got the 12oz. version instead of the bomber. I hope this review helps you."

"O-Too much in the way of flavors that just didn't mesh well together."
""

"Had this beer as the first of a tasting on a 100+ degree day. Remarkably easy to enjoy while maintaining body and personality. Could have more bite on the mouthfeel, but overall a favorite. Fabulous with a 6 year old Manchego and dry aged salami. The grapefruit is refreshing."

"O: This is a top-notched farmhouse/Belgian-style ale. Good amount of barn house funk. Lots of bright colors and flavors, a great beer for a sunny warm day. My major let down was the boozy lingering taste. It becomes more pronounced as the beer opens, so I prefer the 12 oz. bottles."
""
""
""
""
""
"Tank 7 pours with quite a bit of carbonation and head, but this may be due to an aggressive pour; I don't remember it being quite this lively the first couple of times around. The color of this brew is somewhere between golden and copper, with quite a bit of sediment throughout the liquid; again, probably because of an overly aggressive pour. The scent of this beer comes through strong in the humulus arena, but yeast also plays a starring role. The flavor is also lots and lots of citrusy hops along with strong notes of bubblegum that comes straight out of the Belgian IPA handbook. This beer is not playing around, strong flavors all around don't necessarily make a beer great, but these flavors are fantastic. I cannot wait to pop open my bottle of Saison-Brett, but I may be able to hold of for a few months to let it develop that funk I think I would really love in this brew."
""
""
""
"O- This is a top notch saison. One of the best I have ever had. This beer has it all- perfect appearance and mouthfeel, huge complex aroma. big flavor profile, and very refreshing. Bravo Boulevard!"
""
""

""

"O: This is a very nice Saison and one that I would gladly drink over and over again. Wonderful flavors and very easy to drink + refreshing - the alcohol is well hidden. One of the best examples of the American take on a traditional saison."

"With an 8.5% ABV, this is really a tripel. The amped-up alcohol must explain why this is ranked similarly to Hennepin. I don't love Hennepin, but it is much more enjoyable than this."

"Beer is medium-bodied, with carbonation of medium to medium-low intensity, resulting in a gentle foaming sensation on the palate, gradually becoming lightly foamy. Ethanol can be felt in the nostrils and back of throat as this warms, somewhat disappointing. Slightly languid, pleasant overall, closes semi-dry with little residual stickiness on the palate."
"Poured a clearish orange with good sized head and lace on top of a slightly yeasty, pepper-spiced ale that gives off some light tropical and sweet notes as well as a good dose of citric hops. The beer is smooth and has a rather filling body due to the yeast, and I get a good amount of plush tropical fruit tastes and some citric hops. I'm also getting touches of breadlike and sweet malt so there is some balance in this beer between fruit, sweet and dryness, as I find the finish to be dry and also a little heat thanks to the alcohol that complements finish. An easy to drink flavorful saison that hits all the notes."

"O - Very unique beer. I think this is actually my first Farmhouse ale. I'm a fan."
""
"Really pretty beer, a straw yellow that flirts with pale orange. big rocky head. smells medicinal in a strangely good way. Belgian yeast notes dominate but toasty malt pokes through. a little alcohol burn. tastes great. Big surprisingly bready malt sweetness up front falls nicely into the hops and spicy esters. a touch of honey lingers. not overly long but wonderfully structured. mouthfeel is a little heavy but we are at 8.5% so its not completely unexpected. really very tasty but maybe not as crisp as you might be expecting from a farmhouse ale. this is one I will go back to often."
""
""
"O: This is easily a favorite, outstanding in every category. Not strictly a classic Belgian farmhouse / saison but in the ballpark and standing comfortably on its own. Very easy going, keeps your attention with interesting things when you want, stays out of your way if you want. I would have liked something else to stand out besides grapefruit, only thing stopping perfect scores. Good saison in 12oz bottles is hard to find. Pricey, but you get what you pay for here."
""
""
""
""
"4 pack purchased from Binny's. Cloudy appearance ascending from yellow to orange. Sharp smell of yeast, spice, and citrus zest. Obviously not as funky as Boulevard's Saison-Brett. Lots of grapefruit flavor as well as all the features you love in a saison. Little too carbonated for my tastes but all the flavors are so good it's easy to overlook. Dry finish. Definitely taste the 8.5% ABV as you get closer to the bottom of the glass."
""
""
""
"D – This is a different sort of beer for me. Not sure I really like the style or not. It is drinkable but I am not a fan of the pepper taste in my beer. Will need to try other beers in this style but jury is out for my appreciation of saisons."
"Easy drinking, Dangerous full flavored yet smooth. Sweet and spicy. Lots to appreciate."

"Hazy straw colored in appearance. A half inch layer of foam across the top of the glass. Smell that wonderful Belgian yeast strain. Perhaps a bit of candy sugar in the scent. Biscuity malt with some pine like Pacific hops in the aftertaste. Sort of European style meets modern American brewing. Moderate thickness on the mouthful. Deceptively smooth for the strength."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"D: really good stuff from boulevard here. definitely one of their staples as it should be. a bit of a bigger saison but definitely not raw or undrinkable. pick some up if you have it in your distro."

"Overall, it is a good domestic farmhouse ale. I haven't had a ton but it is a solid offering and when my palate is really looking for some funk and a dry finish I'd certainly consider buying again. What I really like is that this is sold in a 4 pack and the pricing is reasonable. Saisons are wonderful to have around in the summer months and it just seems impractical to stock a bunch of bombers so I applaud Boulevard for the 4 pack format. I'll probably continue to try a few others like Brooklyn's before seeking this out again but will say I'm happy to have 3 more in the fridge and could see myself coming back for more at some point."

"O - I thoroughly enjoyed this beer while sitting out on my deck waiting for the grill to heat up. It had a wonderful combination of hops, yeast, and appearance. In many cases I could care less what a beer looks like, but when I'm relaxing out on my porch after a fairly arduous work week and the weather is fantastic, yeah, the hazy, straw-colored glow really added to my enjoyment."

""
""
"The smokestack series never fails to impress. This was a nicely americanized belgian worth keeping your eye out for."
""
"Overall, a very good representative of the style. My only gripe is that the herbal peppery component at mid-palate is perhaps a bit too strong and disrupts the balance of the beer. Still, fans of traditional Farmhouse Ales should not pass this up if they see it. It's a winner."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy golden color with a thick foamy head.  Head retention and lacing are excellent.  Strong citric aroma with some piney hops thrown in.  Yeasty, malty backbone with a crisp piney hoppy character.  Slightly citric aftertaste but mainly a strong farmhouse, yeasty funk.  High alcohol content is evident in the aftertaste.  Even though crisp, it is still a smooth beer.  Very unique."
""
""
"Overall - The ABV is actually a little bit high for the BJCP guidelines which ranges up to 7.0%, this one is 8.0%. Not a bad thing but it's typical of American breweries to bolster every ale they brew. I would love this beer without the alcohol burn that it comes with but even with that, I REALLY REALLY LIKE it. Can't love it, but it's real close. This is an awesome beer for hot weather. As far as an example of the style it's acceptable but is out of parameters for ABV. I'm going to enjoy the rest of this big ole bottle and then head to bed with a quenched thirst and a spinning head!"
""
""
""
"Tank 7 poured a hazy bright color with a nice large white lacing head. The aroma has alo of pepper and flower notes. The taste has strong pepper and flowery notes, strong spice notes. Full flavor and nice feel, nice carbonation. Overall found the tastes a bit offensive and undrinkable not for me."
""
""
"A fantastic light beer. The aroma makes you think this beer will knock you off your feet with citrus but that flavor passes quickly and mellows. A nice bitter bite at the end reminds you of the high ABV - without it you could down a number of these and regret it later."

"Not a bad take on the style, even if it's totally a hybrid in the same way that, say, Saison Rue is. However, unlike that one, this is far more drinkable. The fruitiness is really refreshing here, as well as the grassy hops and crisp grains. Everything works out well, except for my lack of maintaining sobriety in the long run, due to that devilishly hidden ABV. I'll be seeking out more beers from these guys in the future."

"Overall very enjoyable brew or maybe just in the mood for a crisp Saison either way I would highly recommend and repurchase if I find again in the future. My second Smokestack Series from Boulevard both have been excellent."
"O- I really love Saisons. Extremely complex beers that are wonderful when executed properly. However, I feel like the yeast were too predominant in this beer. The pepper and clove overwhelmed the fruit and sour flavors I enjoy. A good beer nonetheless."

"Spice, like pepper and basil, that creates a sweet sensation on its own. Grapefruit, jolly rancher. Light-medium body. I think the essence of a saison is that it is light and drinkable. I'm afraid this is not nearly light enough (in alcohol, flavor, etc) to be a light summer drink. It is fairly well balanced, but why go overboard with the alcohol? Somebody explain... does it make it more ""complex""? Somehow Belgian saisons and lambics accomplish tremendous complexity while still being light and refreshing. I appreciate subtlety, and I wish American brewers would start using more of it."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
"Overall, a nice saison, and pretty refreshing for 8% (though that's probably dangerous!)."
"Pours a huge head at first, easily four fingers, extremely delicate, almost no bubbles per se save a few fat ones around the point of pour, bone white, looks like a soufflé as it settles, wispy yet sticky streaks of lacing. Hazy golden colored liquid, the lightness of the particulate hides it well, filled with active streams of bubbles. The nose is gently forceful, nutmeg, clove, caraway seed and lemon peel, taut yeastiness, softer pinch of bubblegum, as the spice normalizes you perceive more apricot, peach, yellow apple fruit, the banana stays further in the background, longlasting presence but even better stays fresh. Medium-bodied, tighter and more focused than expected from looking at all those bubbles, the carbonation is active but not frothy. Mixes in some sour white grapefruit and orange to the lemon base, refreshingly citrusy. The yeasts again are not doughy nor too soft and it is not on the funky side of the spectrum. Clove, nutmeg but also basil and oregano, not herbaceous as in grassy but herbal as in garden herbs. Blends in pineapple and mango with the peach, apricot, pear base. As it warms takes on a more honeyed dimension. Dryness ensures erect bearing through the finish. Very thoughtfully put together while not over-intellectualized."
""
"This is such a tasty and refreshing Saison all the while incorporating some juicy tropical fruit notes. It's a little light on the traditional funk and Belgian characteristics, but very good and slightly bitter for the style too."
""
"O: A very nice American take on a complex Belgian style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Live life drink beer!!!:-)"
""

"My only complaint is that it drinks a little flat from the bottle. On tap, where the carbonation can be manipulated, it can be an almost perfect beer."

""
""
"O- Fits the profile of a saison perfectly. Not the style of beer that I prefer, but i had to give it a shot. Would think it to be very pleasing for a more farmhouse person."
""
""
"Got the 4 pack with glass for half off, definetely worth that."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, I'm impressed. I think its appearance is this beer's weakest point while it's taste is its strongest. Things I liked: its tropical fruit aroma, its biscuit::sour ratio, and it's spicy notes. Things I didn't like: it's somewhat simple appearance (for a Saison). Also, I personally like my Saisons to be a bit sweeter and have a bit more of a yeast flavor than this one possesses. If I were to improve on this beer, I'd add some more honey to give it a slightly sweeter flavor and also keep more yeast in suspension to give it a bit more body. Overall though, I'm impressed. Not my favorite commercial Saison (that belongs to Funkwerks) but I'd say it's in my Top 5."
""
""
"O- one of the first that ive tried of the style, very good fruity notes. All of Boulevard's smokestack series beers have been awesome."

""
"O: Tank 7 is blvd's flagship beer I would have to say. They are one of those breweries where every single one of their beers shares a common backbone, particularly due to the yeast which is in most of them. Tank 7 to me is their best wisely available beer. It is the definition of a saison to me, with mabey slightly a higher hop content. It drinks great. That being said it is nothing crazy creative or innovative but hitting a style so right on deserves just as high praise as one that pushes boundaries. This is a beer for sipping"
""
""

""
"Overall - My first beer from this brewer and it's a winner for sure. The scent is fantastic and the appearance is spot on. I'd be happy to drink this again anytime and would make it a go to beer if it was readily available to me."
"Pours a hazy golden orange with a three finger head that dissipates fairly slowly and leaves. Lively carbonation. Smells grass, belgian yeast, little funk, a tiny bit of lemon or lime, pepper. Taste starts with bright flavors of lemon and grass. Then is followed in the middle by the belgian yeast, some peppery spice, slight breadiness. Then the finish is more of the belgian yeast, some light funkiness, some light citrus notes like lemon and grapefruit, more spiciness, some slight floral notes, sweet breadiness from the malt. Creamy, refreshing mouthfeel. High medium body. This was supposed to be drank by January, which was two months ago. Still in pretty good shape with some hop qualities, but I’m sure it is far better beer fresh. Not too bad."
"O: I was so disappointed in this beer. I was really bitter and just kept getting more and more bitter as I drank it. The grapefruit is nice and refreshing, but the hoppy, bitterness overwhelms any other tones within the beer. I will not be buying this beer again."

"As far as Farmhouse/Saisons made in the US, this is on par with Hennepin and just about as good as it gets. I'm still completely sold by the relatively high alcohol content as I just don't think that is true to style (can't serve 8% beer as a ""refreshment"" to field workers, they'd pass out in the fields after lunch!), but the flavor cannot be denied. And Boulevard has at least resisted over-hopping like so many US brewers want to do with this style. This is legitimate stuff. From the funky/horsey aroma when you open it to the slightly peppery finish, it's all there. Very few brewers in the US ""get it"" as far as Farmhouse ales go. These guys are on the list. Well done. Having said that, Farmhouse/Saisons are not for everyone. If you don't like the style, this beer probably won't change your mind."

"Good foam and color. OK nose. Taste is a cross between a Belgium ale and an IPA, done very well. I like the mix of the floral with a bit more hop bitterness than in a typical Belgium ale. Finish is very long, starting with the fortunately not too sweat malt and ending with just the right amount of bitter bite."

"Overall - A very good and refreshing beer. Complex and fairly well balanced. This is my first beer of this style, reminds me a bit of Duvel. A favorful beer that I would recommend."

"The beer pours a pretty golden straw yellow with a huge fluffy white head that lasts forever, and medium thick poofy lacing that leaves rings on the glass. The body is clear but for a slight haze, and carbonation bubbles can be seen steadily working their way up the glass, though there also seems to be some very small particles floating in the beer. This is a pretty beer. On the nose, the beer smells wonderfully citrusy, with proper bread accentuations. Peppery lemon comes to mind when trying to describe it. The smell is classic saison citrus-spice with wonderful bready notes and the slightest touches of hay and farmyard funk and even light banana esters. On the tongue, the beer tastes much more herbal and grassy than the nose. The beer begins more in tune with the nose, featuring citrus lemon bread that washes strongly over the tongue, crescendoing and ebbing backwards as a solid grassy bitter follows it, bringing herbal tingling to the mouth and washing away all but a lingering aftertaste that is reminiscent of banana esters. Green pepper tastes can also be found in the middle of the taste alongside stronger banana notes. On the mouth, the beer feels a touch off, sitting just below medium bodied, which makes it highly drinkable, but not quite thin enough to knock back and not quite thick enough to sip. It feels clean and creamy as it goes down, and leaves the mouth slightly wet with a light herbal dryness on the tip of the tongue. Overall, I’m a little disappointed in Tank 7, I’ve heard great things and I love Boulevard’s Saison-Brett, but this beer doesn’t quite marry its separate flavors in an appealing way for me. This is not a bad beer by any means, but I think I built it up a little bit too much in my head. Worth a try for the Belgian lover, but not a knock out in my book."
""

It is very similar to Lagunitas Maximus, i a some how feel like a sucker for rating it so high. If it were labeled as an Belgian IPA (as it should be it would get about a 4/5. Since it's labeled a saison/farmhouse, it's very unique and glorious, that i must give it this rating. If you looking for an example of the style, this isn't it. If your looking for something that's straight up tasty as hell... grab this!"

"The beer was picked as a part of the 4 bottle sampler pack with sweet tulip glass packed in, which I used for this review. The beer looked very hazy in the glass, with a three finger thick head, and a golden body. The smell deviated from the Saison mold quite a bit due to the use of grapefruit like American hops. There was some bubblegum in the nose, which I suspect was the yeast. The taste was expertly balanced between bold and delicate flavors,. There was a noticeable use of citric hops, and a peppery spiciness. But there was also a floral character, and some orange peel, and banana notes. The mouthfeel was airy, and light, with a creamy carbonation. This was one of the best American interpretation of a Saison,, I've had in a while."
""
""

""

"Mostly hazy golden yellow under a properly large, thick, fluffy head. Peppery Belgian yeast, zesty grapefruit, fruity tartness, herbs, and grass. Quite a bit hoppier in the mouth...bright, spicy, juicy citrus working very well with the yeast. Dry, fruity esters, subtle pale malt sweetness, and some grassy/flowery hops to back the citrus. Medium bodied and remarkably refreshing for its strength. I'd go ahead and stick this one in the ""Belgian IPA"" category. Bright and snappy...this beer pulls off the hop/yeast balance very well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"T: A bit of a peppery hop bite comes through first with some smooth light bready malt flavors carrying it. Grapefruit zest, a touch of grass, chalky yeast and a smooth finish with notes of lemon zest and pepper. A pretty remarkable saison and probably the best I've had short of Dupont and Fantome."
""
""
""
""
"First saison and highly impressed. This is an instant ""go to"" beer and I literally went out and bought some more. Light and refreshing, hoppy, citrusy, nice sour notes, great color. Some spice notes of clove(?). Dry on the finish. Slight acidity with no aftertaste - very clean. Maybe some fruitiness - almost an apple or maybe white wine grape, nice green notes (like good olive oil) in the nose, not so much in the taste but enough to perk up the taste buds. Loved it, looking forward to trying others in this style, but also wondering why...got a good one with Tank 7!"
"I got an opportunity to pour this saison/farmhouse ale beer into my snifter glasses directly from 12 fl oz bottle. There was a hazy yellow with big white head. Its smell is more yeasty and citrusy. Its flavor is quite nice even though it shows a long dry bright finish. It is also fresh, fruity, and very drinkable. Very good saison/farmhouse ale to cheer up with someone else who is avid of saison style."
""
""
"Pours clear golden with a persistent 2-3 fingers of loose, white foam. Leaves gobs of lace. Smells like a classic Saison, sweet grain with clay, malts, plenty of yeast character, a bit of lemon and hay. Middle of the road nose. Tastes like it's got some band aids in it, a good light malt backbone with some seltzer notes, a good amount of early bitterness, some metallic hints and a little vinous overtures. Medium bodied with tight, sharp and excessive carb. A thick, wet finish. Not a bad beer, but nothing I'm inclined to appraise or seek out. A great intro to the middle of the road for an interested party."

"This is a nice, simple yet tasty saison. The flavors are subtle but solid. It's smooth, well balanced, and highly drinkable. The ABV is hidden nicely. This is definitely a saison I will have again."

"Clean entry growing to higher alcohol body. Has good weight. Definitely some bitterness, straw/hay on the palate. Bright citrus. Heady wit nose that follows through to a rich palate. A serious beer that exudes power over its expected American Saison Witbier character. A bold citrus-toned Wit. Not a session but say a rich American high ABV version of something like Allagash White."

"Pours a murky orange with a foamy orange-white head that settles to a thin cap on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, spices, yeast, pepper, and some chalky aromas. Taste is much the same with a mild tropical fruit flavor on the finish and a slight alcohol kick. There is a medium spice and yeast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a great smell that is tasty and easy to drink."

"Poured into a small tulip glass an orange tinged dull light golden with a large fluffy,sticky white head that left two full rings of lace behind as it settled verly slowly into a frothy mass.Big lemony citrus notes in the nose along with bready malt and light phenolic spice.Crisp and quite dry on the palate with citric undertones to go along with light phenols.A very good American version of the style,alot of the time I stay away from the style because of the dreaded funk,this is funk subdued.Nice job here."

"Overall (4.0): This is a very good saison. I wouldn’t say it merits a 4.5 overall, but it’s better than just 4.0—it’s balanced and quaffable, especially for something that sits at 8% ABV. No sense of the beer’s strength whatsoever, to be honest. Some saisons are aggressively spicy and carbonated, prickling all over your tongue and extremely peppery. Others are lighter and softer, and this is an example of a saison that comes off as moderately fruity and wheat-forward, with a light tartness that matches the easy mouthfeel and modest fruitiness."
""
""
""
""
"O: Quite a good American saison, for fans of the big spicy American style this is one to pick up."
"I have tried this beer several times, the first being the 750 ml and most recently in some 12 oz. bottles that direct from the brewery (which I will admit were way better than the 750 ml bottle).  Overall, it is a slightly better than average beer for the style...perhaps I just prefer the Belgian brewers offerings better, but the beer is very drinkable and would probably offer to it to someone who is not into craft beer or someone who has never tried the style before.  Nice look, smell and taste, just did not overwhelm me."
""
"OVERALL- I drink this all the time despite the high ABV. Responsible for many nights that went too far. Definatly the best stateside saison I've ever had. Pretty-much textbook except for the beastly ABV."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, the appearance and flavor are really great but the mouthfeel needs work. If this could be lighter and dryer it would really be an outstanding American saison. Still, mouthfeel aside, it is a good beer that should be picked up should you come across it."

"Overall this is a very tasty beer. Wish i had purchased more then just 1. Price is not bad either for how good this is. I've seen this style of beer go for twice as much, with half the quality."
""
"An enjoyable, well done saison."
"Overall-I was not real impressed with the taste and have no real desire to drink this beer again. The main problem I had with this beer was it was more like drinking champagne or sparkeling white wine than beer. I dont really like wine which stands to reason why I did not like this beer. It looks like my opinion is in the minority so by all means try it out for yourself. If you like champagne or fruity wines this may be the beer for you."
""
""
"Pours a hazy light straw color with a huge white frothy three finger head. Smells of Belgian yeast, egg shells, pepper, and mild citrus. First sip is super refreshing with a great hop profile that has a tangy grapefruit and honey character that blends nicely with the light earthy malts. So very drinkable as the 8% ABV is well hidden and a tad high for the style. This is one refreshing brew and I can drink a lot of these."

"Overall: Great beer, ordered a second where I'd normally rotate to try something new. The taste and smell bouquet described is _almost_ overpowering, but Boulevard got it right in balancing things out to make it an enjoyable saison ale."
"Great Belgian inspired brew. Tastes like a Belgian pale ale due to the assertive hop character."
""
""
""
"D - very nice, the malt and hops work well together to give the beer sweetness up front but a suitably dry finish that makes it compellingly drinkable. The yeast adds complexity but not in as flashy a maner as some examples of the style. Very drinkable and well made."
"4.0 D: I'm not a huge fan of superly herbal saisons, but this is one of the best in that genre. Complex, powerful, and easy to put down."
""
"Overall: Definetly an interesting and seemingly pretty accurate introduction to the style - I'm not sure I'd buy a sixer of it right away, but then again I'm usually a fan of darker beers, so I certainly won't write it off. A very drinkable brew!"
""
"Overall: Great take on the farmhouse style. Not exactly blown away, but this beer is still solid."
""
""
""
"D - Very easy to drink; nice summertime drink; great wheat and floral farmhouse taste; I really like this and would consider making it a staple drink for my fridge"
""
"Herbal, grassy bitterness up front. Tropical fruit and sugary malt settle in. Papaya, pear, and fruit cocktail. Peppery, herbal bitterness increases into the finish. Banana and yeasty notes. Dry finish. Lingering fruit and peppery bitterness. Medium-full body. Thick, smooth, creamy feel. Very well done and delicious."
""
"Overall one of my favorite beers to drink. It's bright enough to be refreshing in hotter weather, but still has enough body and heft to it to make it a solid drink in colder weather as well. If I had to be stranded with only one type of beer to drink ever, for the rest of my life, Tank 7 might be that beer."
"In my opinion, the best beers in a 750mL. The hop bouquet is robust and citrus-full. I like this better than most other saisons because it doesn't have the overt, hot alcohol flavor in present in most belgians. The addition of wheat to it's grain bill gives it a fuller mouth-feel, but it is well balanced and finishes clean. Despite its higher ABV, it can easily turn into a session beer if your local bar has it on tap."

"Worth drinking regularly- especially on tap."
"O: pretty much a textbook saison, very well done and sure to please."

"Mmmmm, this is good, really good. Very fruity and juicy. I normally don’t gravitate towards Belgian Pales/Goldens/Saisons, but Tank 7 may change that for me. So glad to have them here in Georgia now. Lookin’ forward to trying more from the Smokestack series."
"Pours a murky golden color with an admirable, rocky white head that devolves into sporadic chunks of lacing as the beer recedes. Aroma smells richly of pepper, hops, yeast, and some light fruit. This combination actually works much more pleasantly together than one might expect. The pepper that was so prominent in the nose is even more so in the taste--almost distractingly so. There are some spices I can tolerate in abundance, but pepper is not one of them. The bottle touts tropical fruit as a main component of the flavor profile, and much to my surprise, there is an evident mango aspect to the taste. The mango is more noticeable initially, before it starts to get drowned out by the pepper and bitterness, but it's definitely there. There's also some of the funkiness typical of the style, and the 8% ABV is well concealed. The carbonation is nice and crisp, just how I like it, but that's not enough to redeem this beer overall. There's just too much pepper going on to give the rest of the elements a fair shake, though I do respect Boulevard for going big on flavor here, even if it's not quite too my liking."

"Overall, an OK saison. It doesn't seem well balanced to me."

""
""
""
"It's peppery, yeasty, lemony, grainy on the palate. Strong right up front and mellows out to a nice dry finish which rounds it out nicely. It's a fine drinking beer, and the alcohol is lightly warming but easily felt. Just a few sips and I can feel it working it's magic. Great Saison here, made in America."
""
""
"O: The aroma in this beer is wonderful, but the taste is a bit disappointing. Still a good Saison, just not world class."

"Pours a crystal clear yellow until you hit some yeast floater cloudiness at the bottom of the bottle. Has a big fluffy white head that fades slowly and leaves nice lacing down the glass. Smells of bready yeast. Tropical fruit and pepper on the tongue."
""
"O: A very good farmhouse ale. (Note: Farmhouse ale is not one of my favorite styles.) It has a nice spiciness and the Belgian yeast funk does not go over the top. This is a good beer for a summer day. This beer can cool you down and still provide some entertainment for your palate."
""
""
""

"Hazy dark yellow color with a nicely fluffy head that lasts for quite some time, some lacing is present. Floral and citrus notes abound in the nose over a lightly peppered biscuit malt aroma. The flavor starts out with the pepper tones and has the malt rise up to meet it around midsip alongside lemon wedges and some more sweeter citrus elements (many kinds of oranges and a bit of lime acid splash) and a garnish level of pear esters as well. Creamy, soft texture over a medium body. Other than swinging a hair too far into sweetness for my preferences, it's hard to find something to criticize in this brew!"
"Overall, a really solid beer. This was my first saison/farmhouse ale, and i found it to be quite enjoyable. I typically go for hoppy beers, but this was a nice change of pace. Will definitely try again...right now."
"o: An awesome American interpretation of the Saison style. A World class beer!"
"OV: A good saison, slightly underwhelming finish. I would return to this."
""
""
""
""
"Not a style of beer I'm overly familiar with, but which I've had a few over the years, and this has been a consistent winner to me. Light and vibrant enough with a distinct taste profile that, if given an open mind for the style, is readily appealing. Nice complexity and balance. Easy to drink, even if you're new to the style."
""
"O - A really solid farmhouse ale. Maybe not ground breaking but certainly a solid example of the style. No crazy additions or wild interpretations...but solid. Since it is easily available, a perfect into to the style. Nicely done."

""
"D: This was a solid saison with a refined scent and taste, and a fitting body. The alcohol was well hidden and the finish was pretty smooth, so it was easy to drink. Great refreshing drink for summer."
"Overall - Another exceptional offering by Boulevard. Go get this beer, drink it, and try not to fall in love with it. Absolutely one of the best beers I've had for a while. One of my new favorites. Highly recommended. Excellent job."
"Overall: A very good farmhouse ale. This was the first beer I've had from Boulevard and I'm pretty impressed. Nice job."

"O: Tank 7 is a beautiful, slightly hoppy saison; this is an everyday (and affordable) saison; perfect for summer but quite frankly I could drink this any time; I love this beer"
"O: this is a great beer and way to drinkable for 8%. I love a saison that has a clear citrus personality overtopping the yeast."
""
""
"O: Wow, what a great beer. Admittedly, as a biased IPA fanatic, I like my saisons low on yeast but high on hops, and since this fits the criteria brilliantly, I'll be hunting this one down in the near future. I, for one, welcome our new Missouri overlords to Maryland!"

"Overall this was a truly fantastic Saison from Boulevard. Complex yet approachable. This should be drank fresh as the hop flavors really complement the yeast. Love the drinkability. I would definitely get this again. Recommended to all. Cheers!"
"Overall, yes, it's a good saison: but perhaps a saison needs to do something exceptional to break it out of the banal. Still, I've had very few saisons this good outside of Belgium, and the smoothness, crispness and general drinkability of this one is commendable."

"Overall, a very good beer indeed! Quite a hoppy saison- perhaps more of a Belgian IPA. Whatever you call it, it is yummy!"

"Poured from the bottle into a tulip. Pours a golden yellow color with lots of carbonation and a big pillowy head that leaves good lacing throughout. The nose is beautiful on this beer. It is dominated by a spicy, zesty character of coriander, lemon zest, pepper, and as the beer warms, some hop character as well. Very quiet bready malt in the back. The taste and mouthfeel is very full of carbonation; it almost takes away from the beer, but not quite. It's quite dry up front. Lots of sweet lemons, spicy burn on the tongue with the very minimal touch of burn from the alcohol. Overall a very tasty beer. I'm glad I got the 4 pack."
"Fantastic, dangerously drinkable saison from KC of all places. High carb, tall lasting light frothy head, gold (not amber or orange) hazy. Dry yet malty pils, bitter with Belgian phenols blending perfectly. Perhaps a bit simple, maybe not enough farmhouse, but really so tasty and clone-worthy."
""

"Pretty solid saison, though a bit strong for the style. That said, the booze doesn't show through and it's well put together and easy to drink."

"The beer is transparent and golden colored with 1/4"" of white head after a slow pour into a snifter. The aroma offers grass, yeast, lemons, funk. Smells inviting. The taste is crisp and clean, with everything well balanced. A touch of funk sits nicely with light citrus notes, particularly lemons. The finish offers some herbal notes and lingering floral hops. Light to medium in body. Good stuff - I would like to have this again."
""
""
"A hazy golden body holds up a 1.5"" tall cream colored head of medium density. Lots of carbonation can be seen rising through the beer. Head retention is very good. This beer is appears as a saison should. Aroma is primarily of sweet saison funk, but I also detect citric hops. The taste starts with a slight sweetness and a touch of floral hops. As the beer crests the tongue I get a bit more citric hops and a bit of spiciness. The finish includes a touch of bitterness and funk. A decent funk flavor carries the beer across the tongue. Body is of medium thickness. Carbonation is not as aggressive as something like saison DuPont, but is is there in enough quantity to make this very drinkable. The 8% ABV surprised me. Overall this is a very good saison/farmhouse ale. I quite like the flavor profile, but as a saison enthusiast, I don't think this would make my top 3."
""
"Thanks Bruce! Pours a hazy, bright golden straw color with a large white head that disappears at a steady pace. Scent is quite spicy and funky with a nice amount of earthiness. Pepper and some citrus hit the nostrils along with a bit of clove and banana. Taste is very enjoyable and flavorful. A good amount of pepper with some citrus zest. Lemon and grapefruit with some banana to balance it out. Slight bready malt flavor with a bit of classic barnyard taste. Very light hoppiness and just a tad bit of alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and highly carbonated. Crisp, dry finish. Drinkability is very high. Overall, the only other saison I've had from these guys was Saison Brett, and I must say that they know exactly what they're doing when it comes to this style of beer."

" This medium-bodied Saison is packed with flavor and complexity. The alcohol is somewhat present, but not enough so that makes it intolerable. Very easy to drink. A damn tasty brew, and perhaps my favorite of the Smokestack series."

"Finger and a half white head, hazy orangish yellow clear body, a few streams of rising bubbles, big lacing. Fairly fruity nose, pears, some lemon and wheat, dry nose and floral hops. Taste is pretty dry mild lemon, light malts, with a bit of dry hay funk on the back end.. Mouthfeel well on the light side of medium, above average effervescence. Really well made, easy drinking at this ABV and rather refreshing. Not quite the character and depth of Boulevard's Saison Brett, but very enjoyable."
""
""
"A nice summer brew. Appearance is an appetizing golden color with an unfiltered hue. The smell is a strong citrus. Excellent lacing and a very decent head. Taste has a strong grapefruit flavor which is great if you like that. A little much for me. Very smooth feel however. An overall great pick for a hot summer day. I think it would pair very nicely with barbeque."
"Wow. This beer was at our after-golf watering hole, and it just was incredible! Dark, robust, the anti Bud Light. It was pretty amazing watching almost everyone give it a try. The light beer advocates didn't like it, but I thought it was great. The perfect antidote to watered down beer."

"Personally, I like this style to be a bit more light and dry. But this is a remarkable saison nonetheless. It's even more remarkable considering it is brewed in the US. This is a must-try, props to Boulevard."

"Had this on tap at Bitter Creek in Boise. Came in a tulip glass, light in color- wheat with a light amber, decent 1/2"" white head that laced the glass. Extremely easy to drink, belgian hops were mild, had a subtle sweetness. I have been drinking alot of Saison style beers lately and this is one of the better ones. I recommend it."

"Pours a bright straw yellow with a very bright, two-finger white head. Great lacing and the head doesn't go anywhere any time soon. Aroma of lemon zest, yeast, a bit of spice and straw, didn't have a huge nose. Nice lemon rind and apple notes to start. Moves into a yeasty, grassy flavor blended with a sweet, pale bready malt. Just a hint of spice in this one on the very back end. Some slight sweet citrus, bordering on tropical hop notes hide the spice, before a touch of bitterness on the finish. A lot going on in this flavor profile, really complex. Good sweetness and hop notes for the style, also great drinkability for a saison."
""
""
"PPours a slightly hazy whitish yellow with constant effervescence and a hufe frosty white head. Aroma offers some nice spice from the belgian yeast, bold lemon citrus juice, some of its rind as well, and a kiss of some bread underneath it all. Flavor mirrors the aroma quite well. I don't taste any alcohol, but I can feel the alcohol at the close of each sip/ A crisp, active mouthfeel. Overall, great saison. I only wish it was a little lower abv."
"Great example of the style, great flavors and aromas that work great together. One of the better American saisons I've had."
"Very good beer! Tank 7 is a keeper."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best by 3/31/2012. Pours hazy golden straw color with a nice 2-3 finger fairly dense white head with great retention that reduces to a nice lap that lingers. Some spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of big lemon, orange, pepper, coriander, apple, pear, herbs, biscuit, and yeast spices. Very nice and well balanced aromas with good complexity. Taste of big grass, pepper, lemon, clove, coriander, biscuit, herbal spiciness, pear, orange, lightly tart grain, and yeast spices. Good amount of spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, grass, pepper, clove, and herbal spices on the finish for a bit. Fairly dry on the finish. Nice balance of flavors with nice complexity. Medium body and carbonation; with a fairly creamy mouthfeel. No alcohol noticed other than a slight warming after the finish. Overall this is an excellent and very enjoyable saison; with good complexity and smooth drinking."
"Overall this is a really nice example of the style. Not one of the ""funkier"" examples of the style but still retains a little bit of the farmhouse character. Seek if out of you are a fan of the style."

"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a cloudy orange yellow with lots of carbonation from the sides of the glass. I may have poured too much from the bottom of the bottle because there are thouseands of white particles suspended in the glass. A one finger fine white head with great retention and lacing. Very nice looking. Aroma of complex light fruit, Belgian spicing. Flavor starts with light fruit, sweet malt and citrus. Becomes dry and spicy, Belgian spices and pepper and finishes with dry and with a hint of Brett funk. Light to medium mouth feel with pleasant carbonation. The funk is perfect for me at this level, adds interest without overwhelming the palate. I'm not a big fan of brett, but like the other flavors of saisons. Tank 7 has the right combination of flavors for me. Very nice."

"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a tulip glass, best by 5-2012. This pours a mid golden color with a nice foamy white head which leaves a lacing. The smells are nice sweet yeast esters, lemon, gum. The feel is medium to light. The taste is good, a little earthy taste, some yeast esters, lemon, more bitterness than expected, a little dryness."
""

"Tastes sweet and spicy, tangelo. Nice yeasts. Lacks a full-on barnyard stink I've come to love in some saisons. It's drying a tad in the middle, but just enough to warrant another sip. An aftertaste of nutmeg, cinnamon, and a hint of clove emerges. Not as refreshing feeling as some others in the style, and has a bit more of a body as well, but is delicious nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Hidden pretty well in this light-bodied, complex-yet-delicate beer, is a fairly high alcohol level for the style. While there's plenty of great yeast characteristics throughout Tank 7, I'd love to see some of the faint funk found in the nose to make it's way into this farmhouse ale's flavor. Regardless, Tank 7 is one of America's all-time greats when it comes to trying to reproduce the difficult-to-nail Belgian style!"
"Gotta give em credit. Got the right flavor profile, and the decent strength of tastes, but still thinned this out. It is no Fantome, but what is? An excellent domestic version of the style."

"A most excellent American saison, one of the better domestic versions I've sampled. Might rate this one higher if i had more bottles to appraise."

"12 ounce bottle courtesy of scray24, poured into a Unibroue tulip. Grapefruit color with a towering white head. Fresh citrusy aroma with lemons and candied oranges, vanilla sheet cake, light menthol. Flavor tends more toward bready malts, slightly sweet dough, oranges, cough drop herbs, honey. On the sweet side midpalate, but a dry straw/barnyard finish with a subtle astringency dries it out and gives it a nice saison feel. Easy to see why innoculating this with brett is such a good idea."

"Overall -- Fabulous beer that tastes as good as it looks. Hard to believe this is an 8 ABV -- very drinkable yet very rewarding. Sorry I only had one bottle."

"Overall – Not that impressed. Overly sweet and too little carbonation. I may give it another chance."

"This beer pours a fantastic cloudy, light orange with a 2 inch foamy, white head. Incredible amounts of lacing and a blanketing remains throughout drinking. The smell is pure saison yeast fruitiness and sweetness. Tasting also gives you a mouthful of spot-on saison. The beer's light effervescence crosses paths with a touch of barnyard and biting alcohol. The aftertaste is relatively neutral and light furthering this beers drinkability. I would definitely recommend this beer to many different types of beer drinkers, but I'm glad I snagged a bottle instead...to share with my lovely beer drinking partner...and girlfriend."

"This appears a golden straw color with a lot of foam. Lots. Billowy, cottony, foamy goodness releasing all sorts of flora aromatics. I pick up some coriander and a lot of, hm, floral/pollen-y aromas. It’s a smooth brew with a spicy kick towards the finish. A slight bitterness (from the grassy/straw hops) reminds you it’s an “American-style” saison, as does the less-than-sessionable ABV, but it’s also friendly enough to share with a less adventurous beer drinker (or someone who is not a fan of hoppy brews)."

"O: The beer is extremely good for a saison from the states. Wish I was closer to Missouri to be able to get this more often. Four friends and a Growler of this was a great evening."
"Taste has a fruity citrus presence, active carbonation that is slightly high but just short of being off-putting, sweet malt rounds out the aftertaste before it finishes once again with a citrus punch, slight dry finish."
""
"O - really solid beer with quite a bit happening; highly carbonated fluffy mouthfeel really stands out, but it doesn't offset the fundamental bitterness that parks itself at the back of the throat. Not bitter like an IPA: much lighter in texture and almost vegetal. Impressive beer."
"This is one of my very favorite saisons, and definitely the best I've had in a four pack."
""
"O - this fits right in with all the other awesome offering of the Smokestack Series"
""

"O: A really nice beer that I wish I could get my hands on readily -- when are you coming east, Boulevard?"
""
""
" Palate is lightly sweet pale malt up front, with light citrusy hops providing balance and a little bitterness before the swallow. Notes of coriander, lemon peel, and a touch of pepper on the finish. A lingering bitterness on the finish shows off the substantial hopping. Body is creamy and lively, and still heavy enough to support the substantial alcohol content. This beer is an impressive example of the saison style, one of the better American versions I've had."
""

"Mouthfeel: wet, lightly carbonated, but when held on the tongue and swirled around the mouth is much stronger than first impression. This is a very tasty beer so far."
"I thought this was a good take on a saison. I like the stronger-than-usual hop profile and the fullness of this beer. I could do with a bit less clove flavor, but it's not out of place here. One of my favorite saisons."
""
""
""
""
"Most of Boulevard's offerings have been average, IMO, but this one is better than that. I like it and the remaining supply of the 4-pack will likely be dissolved by the time this review is observed."
"Very bright yellow in snifter. There is a bunch of particulate matter circulating in it. Nice thick white head. Very nice lacing on glass. Smells nice. Clove and maybe some leather. Citrus is there too. Certain je ne sais quois to it as well (sorry to dork you out). Taste follows pretty well. Good carbonation. Overall nice and would definitely buy again but like others in this style a little better."
""
"Poured on-tap and served in a tulip stem, the beer is a light, bright, slightly hazy, pale yellow coloring, with a steady flow of carbonation bubbling and a dense, small bubbled, frothy white head. Aromas of sweet fruit and a spicy blend, with some clove and allspice in abundance. Bready yeast scents, also. The flavors have a strong roasting to them, with the clove and slightly sour yeast flavors following quickly on the tongue. Sweet berry fruits, and a slight highlight of honey balance the flavors. The aftertaste has a split second of sour, but a good showing of the spice blend. The finish is slow and slick, with a slight linger to it. Very good flavors, and one of the more sessionable Farmhouse brews I've had, despite the higher ABV."

"pours a thick straw golden color with a fading lace head into a snifter. would never guess this to be 8%. smells yeasty and fully fruity. taste is robust ripe sweet full flavored fruit. plums, apples, berries, all blooming in the mouth. yeast backbone and a hop presence in the middle. problem with this one is the mouthfeel. way way too heavy and filling for the style, i should be able to session this. as filling as my bbq ribs i ate with this. heavy feeling bust still properly carbonated. i liked it, but as with many of boulevard's beers, there are 50 better alternatives per style."

"O: Excellent saison. I can see why so many people recommend this beer when introducing noobs to craft beer. Fantastically balanced. Would go for one of these anytime."
""
""
"Appearance- very nice,great white lacing,head white foamy and hangs around most the duration. Color was a clean haze of yellow/orange. THE smell is just not good. Overwhelmed with a grassy ""farmhouse"" odor,and someone using a lemon fresh deoderizer to cover up the bitterness. THE tast is what I would imagine furniture polish tasting like, (*&($& pledge). The ABV may be too much, I dont know....but sip was hard to finish. Im truly sorry because Im a huge fan of Boulevard...wont willingly grab this again."
"Overall, the yeast flocs are a bit off-putting, but otherwise this hits all the high points of an American-style Saison."
"CHEERS!"
""
""
""
"M - Slightly funky and sour. Accurate for the style. Good carbonation. Fantastically drinkable."
""
""
"o: overall this is an excellent beer, although the over carbonation and pepper on the finish make for a tongue tingling experience."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not usually a fan of Saisons/Farmhouse Ales, but this can be an exception. It bordered on being too bitter for me in the finish, though. Regardless, I still enjoyed it."
""
""
""
""
"The feel of this beer is medium bodied with a nice drinkable feel. There is a great body to this beer that makes it feel like there is something there but then does not weight on you as much as you first fear. A really smooth beer with some nice overtones."
"Overall - Pretty good. I like funkier saisons, but it's still nice. Drink it quickly, because it loses its refreshing qualities as it warms."
""
"Overall: very nice. I would drink this again."

""
"Overall the Tank 7 is an excellent beer for the style. Not necessarily in the same neighborhood as the Saison Dupont or Belgian's other saison offerings but a fantastic beer with a lot to offer. I would recommend this to anyone that has sampled North Coast’s La Merle as another well-executed American saison."
""
"Overall I think this is a very nice Saison. Looks pretty, tastes nice and hides the alcohol very well for 8% abv. I am becoming a big fan of Boulevard. Too bad their stuff is very hard for me to find in the Northeast."
""
"O: I was expecting a little more from the beer, but still not bad. I prefer Saison more, but that one is long gone. Still a good beer and tasty."
"Overall, while the fruity, spicy, peppery, and citrus flavors in this beer are well-developed and finely nuanced, I found the beer slightly out of balance, needing a greater sense of earthiness from the malts to help ground the effect. A larger marble rye bread taste, perhaps, or toast crust would have sufficed. Without this, the sugars and citrus fruits overwhelm the profile, and the beer feels somewhat mimosa-like: alcoholic fruit juice mixed with champagne. The result is still very drinkable, but quite sugary, and wants for a bit of bread and cheese to help offset the beer."
""
""
""

"This truly is an excellent Saison. Dry, complex and refreshing, up there with the best American-made examples of the style."

"Thanks Glen."

"D: The beer is very drinkable and just really delicious."
"Overall this is a nice saison. This beer is very complex yet easy to drink at 8% abv. The sediment and over carbonation are the only negatives here."

""
"O- Im a little angry that I put off trying this for so long. This might be my favorite saison that I've tried to date."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Focus on the hops and crispness, and this is a brilliant warm-weather beer. Focus on the earthiness and the funk, the complexity and the mouthfeel, and this is a beer to be camped on and scrutinized any time of year. Brilliant."
""
""
"O 4.25 - one of my favorites for the style. Very well done!"
""
""
"O - Good, not great. Don't love much of the Belgian style anymore cause of the sweetness. I do like the complexity here."
""
""
"O- I am not very experienced in this style but the Saisons I have had have always seemed to sugary, headache inducing to me. Not a bad tasting beer."

"O: Goes down very easy, tasty, not filling, well hidden kick, nice representation of style. Well balanced, good flavoring, easy to sit with for a while."
"Overall- I'm not a big fan of this style but I enjoyed this beer. Just the right amount of spices make this one very refreshing."
"overall, for me, this is pretty much the staple of a clean saison. also a nice little american hop bonus. i could see anybody liking this, amazingly great drinkability."
"Overall: What little I have had from Boulevard, I am loving. This beer leaves a really pleasant aftertaste that I cannot put my finger on. However, it makes it a beer I like to savor. I barely notice the alcohol under all the flavor. Perhaps slightly hoppier than most, but this one jumps to near the head of the saison pack. I will get this again."
"Pours a golden straw yellow with a frothy white head. Has a sweet malty smell. The taste is on the sweet side. There is a large taste of honey covered green apples. Not as complex as I expect or want a saison to be, mostly just sweet, but still pleasant. Carbonation is pleasant and just right. I wouldn't reach for ths beer as a preferred saison but if I was at a bar that was serving it and nothing else caught my eye I wouldn't be unhappy with it."
"Mouthfeel is live and bubbly with a light texture to it. Overall, Tank 7 is a solid American-made saison. Crisp and refreshing with plenty of flavor."
"Pours a hazy golden yellow color with a big off white head. In the aroma, lemon citrus, spicy, and a small tartness. In the taste, dry spices, earthy, and a small lemon tartness. A spice bite and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry earth and small tartness in the aftertaste. Nice mellow tartness and nose is sweeter than the taste."
"O - Very drinkable. I don't like it as much as Hennepin, but it's good stuff."
"Starts off as a Saison but then I note a good dose of bittering hop. Interestingly, the swallow loses this as the sourness returns to the palate. In a word, complex. Rich body for the style. Fine bubbles and plenty of them."
"This comes in four packs, that is fantastic."
"Overall this beer is just great. From first sight, to scent, to taste it's a treat. I just love everything that comes out of that brewery. Keep up the good work!"
"Overall -- Very nice. For hoppy saisons, there are others I'd reach for first (see: Boulevard Sorachi Ace), but this is still definitely notable. One of the better Smokestack offerings from Boulevard, and that's saying something."
"Light to medium mouthfeel with a bit of a dry finish. Overall, another solid offering from the Smokestack series by Boulevard."
"Its not as spicey as I was expecting, but the lemony feeling is actually very refreshing and highly drinkable. Very well put together saison."
"A beer that promises much (it has a great label) and delivers mostly. Cloudy in the glass; zesty and bovine in the nose; a yeasty and dense body with some lightly-malted tones in the taste. It's a tad hoppy for my liking, but not overly so and doesn't lose points for being so bright. The funk level is somewhat high, in my view. Boulevard seems to take the ""farm"" part of ""farmhouse"" somewhat literally. Otherwise... well worth a bottle or two."
"O - Really good beer overall, best Farmhouse Ale that I've had. Definitely worth trying, wish I could get more of this one!!"
"O: I absolutely love this beer. I've been fortunate to have it many, many times, and it's always stellar. I really wish Boulevard beers were available in NY."
"Notes: Tasty but not super complex. A little prickly from the alcohol."
"750 ml caged and corked bottle, Batch number 711105, best before 12-2011. Served in a goblet (as recommended by Boulevard), the beer pours a hazy gold color with an inch white head. The head stays around a long time, and there's a good amount of lacing. Aroma is nice and fruity, it smells like mango, lemon peel, pears, bananas, yeast and sweet malt. The taste is mostly fruity too, the brew tastes like pears, bananas, peppery spice, yeast, citrus (lemon, orange) rinds, bready malt and also an earthy flavor. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's well carbonated and quite refreshing to drink. At $9.99 a bottle, I'd buy this again. Definitely worth trying."
"O: Hops take a backseat to the Saison here but they still really compliment the entire package. I really like what Boulevard has done here, a completely refreshing and tasty Farmhouse Ale. I've traded a lot of Boulevard saisons...might have to hang on to a few more."
"Pours a very pale yellow color with a frothy white head. The smell is kind of funky but very aromatic and floral with grass and hints of oranges a fresh pineapple. Tastes strongly of grass and lemony hops, it's a little funky, there is a nice firm bitterness and flavors of coriander and citrus peel. The beer is light and full of carbonation, the finish is very dry. This is a good beer although stronger and more bitter than most farmhouse ales if had before."
"O - This is a really good saison. Boulevard really seems to know their stuff when it comes to this style...really liked all they had to offer. Glad this is now available in MA...another one that I'll be going back to regularly."
"Probably the best American saison I've had, not a surprise coming from Boulevard. Not abrasive like many other hoppy saisons."
"O - Not my favorite of styles, but this is an excellent saison. Very simple and clean, and can roll with some of the best Belgians out there. Well done Boulevard!"
"On tap at Atwood's Tavern in Cambridge this past Sunday. Served in a Belgian goblet. Extremely bright yellow color. Lots of carbonation forms a nice bubbly white head. Good amount of lacing. Smell reminded me of a wet field - fresh earth and wet grass. Taste was malty and sweet, with just enough hops on the tip of my tongue to keep the taste buds awake. Mouthfeel was very dry and crisp, and I am a bit surprised to see now that this beer is an 8% ABV brew. Very well hidden. This is a super refreshing beer and it was quite enjoyable on a sunny patio on a warm weekend day."
"Crisp and clean on the mouthfeel. Active body is decently creamy but still can't touch Fantome Saison in this department. The 8% is well hidden, which makes this damn near sessionable. Wish I could buy this back home."
"Very good beer."
"I first tried this at Boston's Belgian Beer Festival, 2011, and now I have it at home for a proper review. Pours massive almost all head, white. Hazy light gold body. Smell is delightfully complex with citrus, pineapple, grapefruit, and some caramel. Taste has the same but is much more subdued than the smell. Fairly high alcohol at 8% but you don't feel it. Quite a nice beer, and hurray for the persnickity Tank 7 at their brewery."
"O: This is just quite simply a very good saison. I think that the flavors really pop off that yeast character, and the mouth helps give the beer pastry flavor experience. This is like a nutri-grain bar, but alcoholic and much more fulfilling. I'm a big fan of this beer, but I think it's much better fresher. I feel like the contrast is muddy due to it being a bit older than I've had it before, and the hops don't pop as much. If you want the full experience seek one fresh. Though the flavor still comes through as a consistent performer. Cheers to boulevard for this exemplar beer."
"O: Not a bad saison but not the best I've had. Seems like it's a little too strong for my preferences (I think I like more 5-7%ish). I think I enjoyed the smell more than the taste by a good margin though."
"O: This is a nice and refreshing saison. The alcohol is very well hidden. This is my type of saison as it has lots of flavor but isn't over the top with funk."
"So happy Boulevard is in MA - this is a very tasty saison that is shockinly drinkable given the ABV. I think Jack D'Or is my go-to, but I'm very happy to give this a go."
"D - A good farmhouse ale. Will probably be getting this again soo."
"O - Overall I really enjoyed this saison. Another solid offering from Boulevard. Glad I have 4 more bottles."
"For 8% it really works nicely. Some of the flavors are a bit strong but I like the final balance. A good American Farmhouse Ale."
"This beer has nice carbonation and a crisp, dry finish. Alcohol isn't really noticed much. An excellent example of the saison style. Wish I could find this one at home."
"its pretty good. would rather a more velvety mouthfeel to complement the flavor profile, but its good, and I'll definitely check out more of their beers."
"O/D-Overall, a good Saison. Unfortunately for this beer, it came after I tried Mystic's Saison. In my opinion, the latter blows this one off the map. This is still a nice beer, but if I am going to spend $8.50 for a 750ml of Saison, I will buy the local Mystic over this until I croak. Tank 7 is a good brew, but like their Double Wide DIPA, I am slightly disappointed."
"O: Great example of the style and just as good as their Saison Brett if not a bit better. Yet another excellent smokestack release."
"O: Very tasteful. One of the better examples of the style. Will definitely buy again."
"Drinkability: Hell yes! This is a fantastic Saison Farmhouse Ale with complex flavors and it is very sessionable, even at 8% ABV. No strong alcohol taste at all. I will definitely buy this one again. Nice job, Boulevard Brewing."
"overall, a very, very good saison. boulevard has proven a welcome edition to the boston market. looking forward to exploring more of their offerings."
"this was a very impressive Saison. The beer poured a bright yellow with at least an inch of head. There was a nice lacing pattern. The aroma was pure Saison with hints of spice, yeast and malt. The flavor was rich with the same essence. No alcohol is detected. The mouthfeel is foamy and refreshing. This is a very good beer and a significant example of the style."
"O: one of the best Saisons I've had. Tons to like about this beer."
"awesome American saison. recommended"
"pours a light gold color that is a little murky. Pungent and complex nose with various spices, grains, tangerines and a lot of fresh citrus as well. Great feel with real good depth on both the nose and palate. medium/full bodied with a real polish to it. The palate is just as complex as the nose. A great beer that never disappoints"
"Solid offering, not my favorite Saison I've ever had, but this one has a lot going for it, Cheers!"
"Pours a slightly hazy golden with a lovely, lively head. Smells lightly herbal but fresh with a lift of lemon. A bit grainy on the finish. The taste is similar, but lacks some of the zing of the herbs and lemon in the aroma. Crisp, as a Saison should be, but a touch soft on the finish. A solid, if not spectacular Saison. The flavors need to be a bit more vibrant."
"O- This was a delicious beer. A great representation of the style. I would definitely buy it again."
"Overall, an outstanding example of a saison. One of my new favorites."
"O - Really enjoyed this one. Nice flavor combination. Crisp and bright but with a nice depth as well."
"Presentation: Packaged in a custom twelve-ounce brown glass longneck bottle with a pop-off crown, served in a Sam Adams Boston Lager glass."
"O: a very good beer enjoyed it thoroughly as with the other boulevard specialties"
"O - A solid take on the saison, true to style but very unique on its own. The complex palette is sure to please those that aren’t normally into farmhouse ales. This beer is a great introduction into Boulevard’s Smokestack series."
"Pours a vibrant, straw-colored body with a large, fluffy white head. It lingers, and leaves patches, rather outcroppings, of bubbles behind as lacing. Smells a bit funky, with straw, hay, faint citrus, and clove rounding it out. The taste is almost identical to the nose, but with the addition of a faint pear finish to it. Mouth is crisp, clean, and refreshing; very well done here. Overall, a great farmhouse ale that I’ll happily revisit."
"O- The great aroma and thick head are very impressive but the taste is a bit too bitter in the finish detracting from the other great flavors. The fruity esters are large and try to balance but are a bit outshined by the bitterness."
"Another great example of the saison style, and another great beer from Boulevard."
"Pours a hazy straw-glow with a thin white head that fades to a slight ring and haze. Nice, crisp aromas of wheat, banana, coriander, and bubblegum yeast. Taste follows the nose nicely, lots of spicy white pepper/coriander and sweet bubblegum yeast. Very crisp mouthfeel, with a medium body, sharp carbonation, and a dry finish. Overall a really nice Saison, I'm surprised by how well the alcohol is hidden."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours a nice golden straw color typical to it's type. Also true to it's type, it wreaks of Begian yeast. However, it does also have a smoky scent to it as well, and that's refreshingly unique. Where this varies from most Farmhouse Ales/Saisons, is that the taste isn't pure heffeweizen. The smoke permeates the taste too, and for the second time, it provides a very unique surprise. The mouthfeel is typical for the style, and nothing to write home about. Overall, for me, to have enjoyed this at all is kinda nice. I still wouldn't go back to it, because it's not my bag. However, anyone who has an affinity for this style of beer should definitely try to procure some of this. It's sure to please."
"This Saison ale was served on tap and in a goblet. This beer poured a reddish gold color, and it produced a very nice amount of white head- excellent retention. Above average amount of lacing. The aroma of this ale was full of malted grain, earthy grass, with hits of apricot, and spicy clove. The ale is medium in body and tasted of semi-sour apricot/peach and it gave way to a grainy somewhat dry finish. This is an excellent version of a Saison...btw...this style is rapidly climbing my my personal beer style list... The balance is amazing...wonderful session beer- My new favorite offering from Boulevard."
"Great aroma, smooth flavor with a touch of bitterness. Not what I was expecting from the smell, but pleasantly surprised. Not too sweet, but with the right amount of citrus. Does not leave the signature filminess in the mouth like most Belgian style wheat beers."
"O – The hoppy side of saison."
"Hell yeah, Boulevard! m/m/"
"O: A very nice farmhouse ale."
"Pours a nice slightly hazy golden with a thick and rather persistent buttery off-white head. Aroma is wheaty and yeasty, rather strong with a hint of lemon, enough to tempt a taste. Flavor is wheaty and yeasty, as the aroma promises, with a lemon underpinning and a surprising strong hint of hops. Texture is fizzy, lively and firm-bodied. I’m glad I discovered this brewery!"
"O: Very good Saison. This might be #1 on my list (which isn't long), until I try their Saison-Brett here soon. Boulevard really knows what they are doing with this style."
"You know,I really enjoy this beer. Everything was great in every category. Lovely look, interesting smell, delicious taste, and agreeable mouthfeel. I highly recommend it."
"O: Not sure what to make of this one. I know it is 8%, but it drinks all 8% or more here. Haven't had enough strong saisons to really know their character here, but it just isn't my bag."
"Overall, tasty and pleasant. Nothing incredibly special about the beer, but everything about it was good nonetheless. The third I've tried of the Smokestack series and I've liked every one a lot."
"O - Another fantastic brew from Boulevard. Had been wanting to try this for a while, and I'm really happy to finally have had the opportunity. Cheers,"
"Overall it was a decent farmhouse ale. Admittedly I didn't used to like this ale, but I have discovered it hits the spot on a hot summer day."
"Overall: a basic but well-crafted saison with just amazing, amazing creaminess. Bonus points for that."
"I had been holding off on purchasing this one due to price. I finally tried it last night at Uptown Brothers on Colfax. Poured a pale golden color with a fluffy white head. Aromas of yeast, apples and lemon. On the palate this one was light to medium bodied, with flavors of lemon, yeast and burlap."
"Overall this is a lovely saison that I am happy to have sampled and would love to see at my local bottle shop."
"The CPJ"
"O: A pretty good American attempt at a saison. I'd drink it again, as it was pretty reasonably priced, and is better than most Stateside attempts at Saisons--not quite Fantome, but what is? A great effort that deserves commendation."
"M/D- Smooth, full of body. Shockingly light carbonation feel. Not as bright as the vision would lead me to believe. Sticky flavors. I think the mouthfeel is off from what it should be. The entire presentation up to this point feels disjointed from what it should be. Overall though, very enjoyable., Will be definitely finishing this no problems."
"Very nice hazy golden glass of delicious looking Boulevard beer. Fairly shorlived crisp white head, dissipates to a thin layer floating on top. Nice traditional aromas poking out, clove, banana, light spices. Definitely a noticable alcohol presence, but it doesnt personally bother me, i could enjoy it either way. In this case it gives it a heavier mouthfeel, brought alive by nice carbonation and some hints of peppercorn. Nice creaminess in the head with a swirl of the glass. This is pretty delicious, glad i have another bottle waiting for me."
"Style points for the retro label and bottle shape. Spicy and funky, but both in proportion to the style. Some orchard fruit notes, along with bright yeast character. The 8% ABV was noticeable in both flavor and some pepper bite, but not enough so as to dominate the beer."
"O- I am yet to find a high alcohol saison that really works for me. I look to a saison on a hot day for that refreshing, crisp, delicate feel. These aren't doing that for me."
"While I thought it wasn't quite dry enough, still overall a fairly nice farmhouse, the flavors were spot on and had a pretty solid nose."
"On the whole, this is a more harsh and unruly kind of Farmhouse, but quite distinctive. Just a promise of sweet malt with long acidity. Interesting example and worth a try if you like the style."
"D/O: This saison carries some of the most appealing features of a lower-abv saison into the 7-8% range, remaining labile despite its yeast-focused and fully established flavor profile. The smell is very straight-forward, even to the point of being simplistic, yet does not seem to offer much room for improvement. Considering the difference in price and availability, there really seems to be no motivation to choose a Boulevard Saison-Brett over this remarkable beer."
"Excellent balance, full flavor, and very light and drinkable for the higher ABV. Great brew!"
"o - overall another fine example of a saison enjoyed on a summer's day with the wife. hit the spot, but nothing crazy or earth shattering as far as saisons go. it is on the sweeter side, but hovers more along the middle than my favs which favor the sweetness. certainly a worthwhile saison if you are a fan."
"Overall a great beer, definitely done american style with the heavier hops, also quite a large amount of booze for the style, but enjoyed thoroughly"
"Overall: This is a nice tastey summer time beer. i am not a huge fan of this beer style, so thats why the scores are lower than the average. It almost reminds me of Orval with some similiar characteristics as that beer even though its not the same style of beer."
"Overall: Just an outstanding Saison."
"overall: good"
"D/O- A real pleasure to have and share with friends/family. Great for summer, during a picnic perhaps. Hats off to Boulevard for making a great, widely available saison."
"O: One of the best saisons I have had so far. Complex, fruity, and great tasting. Even at 8% it was easy drinking, could see it pairing very well with a meal."
"O- another nice offering from boulevard and their smokestack series. A little hoppier than other saisons, but a unique take on the style."
"Overall: very good all-around beer, a strong attempt from one of my favorite breweries: Kansas City’s own Boulevard Brewing."
"O- excellent beer for the style. Great American representation of a traditional Belgian farmhouse ale."
"The beer is a hazy but bright golden color with a light head that quickly dissolves into a thing lacy head. The beer smells very sweetly malty with delicate tangerine and a little spicy clove. Tank 7 tastes a little sweet upfront with clean grain, lots of spicy, clove phenols in the middle with an orange peel and yeasty finish. The mouthfeel is soft and light. I'm not a big fan of the hoppy Belgian-style beers with the citrusy hops, I think it's just a little too much to handle especially with the sweetness of this beer. Not my favorite, but also not bad."
"Overall-I finished this beer in about two minutes, it was great. Very refreshing, love the hop addition."
"O- One of my go to farmhouse ales by far. recommend to all that like the style. for 8% ABV very drinkable but only one or two"
"D-Overall thi brew was good for the style.Very drinkable and refreshing. Has a nice yeasty spice to it throughout. WAs't my fav. from this style but still very good. Def. try this once."
"Overall: A wonderful blend of flavor elements combine to make this an excellent example of the style; a bit hoppier than most Belgians but still a cut above most of the domestic examples of the style I have tasted"
"Taste is yeasty, the Belgian flavor comes right out & makes its presence known. Pretty decently carbed too. Has a pepper finish. I think I got this one a little too warm to start with & attempted to chill it down a bit. At the temp I started to drink this the alcohol was noticable. I really love Saisons so this is not unexpected from what I've had before. Has a nice thirst quenching quality to it. Fairly medium bodied to light. Overall, I really like this one & I regularly seek it out when I can. Love it. Prosit!"
"Appearance is a cloudy golden tone with a small white head. Its` smell has yeast, pepper, banana, and a general sweetness. Taking a sip of this farmhouse and I get an earthy quality with more yeast, grass, different spices and a subdued sweetness. MF is medium with a crisp finish...very nice. This saison from Boulevard is quite tasty...wish I could my hands on it in CT."
"F-A balanced and drinkable beer, but watch yourself with the alcohol, the 8.0% will sneak up on you"
"Overall, I thought this was a very refreshing and delicious beer. I walked by this beer several times and I'm glad I finally picked one up. Very complex flavors with a creamy mouthfeel. I will be picking up more of these for sure."
"VERY nicely done Saison here from Boulevard, with a well balanced mix of flavors and a very approachable presence for a higher alcohol take on the style. I’m not a huge Saison guy but this one left an overall good impression and a smile on my face. I would return to this again."
"O: Easy drinking and refreshing saison, the 8% ABV is very well hidden. Great choice for a hot summer day."
"D: The beer is stupidly drinkable and just really delicious."
"O: I'm not really familiar with the style but I loved this beer. Very drinkable with a nice mouthfeel. I can see it being perfect for any season."
"Not once did I specifically mention the word hops in my assessment. I love that the hops blend in perfectly, which is exactly in the spirit of belgian brewing (if you can taste a specific ingredient, you used too much). I love pale belgians that have bright citrus flavours, and this one delivers in spades. Superb!"
"O: Great Saison, keeps you reaching for more."
"O: Refreshing with very nice dryness for a Farmhouse ale. I enjoy this beer a lot in summer but would drink it year round. Very well made."
"D: great beer: the flavors don't compete with each other, very balanced, a go-to bottle if you are from the area"
"D-Very easy drinking... the flavor profile is very well balanced and although you can identify all of the different component on their own; none of them overwhelm the other notes. A lot of times with saisons the clove and spice notes are very overhelming to my palate."
"O- A tasty brew, one of the better saisons I've had recently."
"Layers and layers of flavor. Starts with a sweet lemon flavor that finishes peppery. A touch of banana and grapefruit with a slight of bitterness which lingers a bit before a return of the citrus."
"Well, since it's $3 pints, why only have one? This follow-up pours a mostly clear goldenrod topped by a half-finger (at best) of white foam (my bartender seems to have overfilled the glass...). The nose comprises lemon zest, clove, black pepper, light yeast, and grass. The taste holds notes of lemon zest, clove, nutmeg, black pepper, orange peel, cardamom, earthy (/flowery) hops, honey, and that characteristic saison earthiness/mustiness. The body straddles the border between heavy light and light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a thoroughly enjoyable farmhouse ale. It may not be the paragon of the style, but I wouldn't mind putting back several of these in a row."
"Very tasty, complex and bracingly refreshing...my kind of beer...please distribute this to NY or NJ or Mass or CT or VT sometime soon"
"Great one from boulevard and a staple alll summer."
"After having a few more of these I really like this beer, but the dry finish really throws a wrench in it for me. If not for that this would be a top saison."
"Overall- I was very excited to finally try this one, and it did not disappoint. A well-crafted American saison, that deserves to be in the same breath as Hennepin or Sofie. I will definitely be drinking more of this."
"Overall, a very good beer. The look and smell are the highlights, but it's darn tasty, too. I will definitely be drinking more of this, though its heaviness brings down the refreshing quality."
"On-tap at the Hanger Room in Minnesota. Nice looking golden-colored saison here with a decent white cap on top. Nose is pretty good, some light malts underneath yeasty spice notes with a ""fresh"" aroma that is a bit different than some other saisons that I've had. It's refreshing, making this one easy to drink. Flavor follows with a bit of a lemony kick atop a bit of sweetness and some clean yeasty spices... overall a very drinkable and enjoyable saison."
"The mouthfeel is on the lighter side with carbonation being moderate for the style. overall it was a pretty easy drinking and flavorful beer. It felt a little light and lacking the complexity of some of the best versions of the style though in my opinion. Although I didn't find it outstanding in the style it was still a very good, refreshing and easy drinking beer."
"O: A fairly complex saison but still drinkable. Good sipper for a hot day"
"This an average to decent saison."
"O - saisons are not my favorite style, but I could see myself seeking this out again if I need a saison fix."
"O: This was my first saison and I was very impressed. The different flavor profiles all compliment each other nicely and leaves you wanting a little more to replenish the dry finish."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and slightly chalky due to the yeast. I was very happy when this made it to four packs, as a 12oz bottle is about perfect for this one, but a 750ml can become a little bit to much in one sitting."
"Overall a very good American farmhouse ale. I would get it again in a 750ml and be more careful how I pour it."
"Big thanks to kkipple for sharing this one on the bus this weekend! Served from bottle into a Brewvival sampler imperial pint. Poured a golden yellow with a two finger pure white head that subsided to one finger slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, spices, and floral notes. The flavor was of sweet malt, spices, floral notes, and grain. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. 8%!?!? Holy crap... You never would have known this at all. The floral notes on this one were quite nice and made the rest of the aspects of this one standout even more. A really done brew for a style that I do not typically like. Nice job Boulevard!"
"Overall, this is an interesting and tasty beer. Flavorful and still easy to sip. This does hit a little harder than expected though."
"Overall: Just a great example of the style. I am very glad that BBC is now distributing in Chicago. I've already bought two sixers of this. Really solid brew!"
"O: I really enjoy saisons and this one did not disappoint. At 8% this is not a beer to quaff on a summers day, but I will admit it is tempting."
"O- my fist impressions of this brewery is a good one. one of my favorite saisons already. ill pick up some more of this as soon as i can. im glad its a year round beer. check this out if you get the chance."
"This is usually the go to beer at bars in KC that don't have many craft beers. This beer looks so good you just know it is going to be great. It glows yellowish orange with a great looking white head sitting on top. The smell is sweet and spicy. The sweet at first and then the spicy bready smell you would expect. Taste follows the nose and has hints of sweet lemon and then some spicy yeast. Really refreshing and one that you could drink a few of if you wanted."
"I'm a big fan of Hennepin, this one is right there with it. Another awesome smokestack series beer."
"FERMENTED LIQUID LOVE, TRY THIS!"
"From Notes...Boulevard never ceases to amaze me!!!! Tank 7 is another wonderful creations....I mean brew! The color is a golden cloudy, which is similar to most Saison's. The smell was similar to most belgium style ales...hints of clove and citrus. The smell of course fell in with the taste which was citrus/clove/bananna. There is a refreshing start which is followed by a spice/clove which hits the pallet perfectly...then dissapates...doesnt lag. I really like this beer."
"Overall, this is a very good beer, but for me, the hops overpower the saison elements in a negative way. The aroma leads you to think this is a saison with hop notes, but the taste seems more like a pale ale with Belgian yeast, or perhaps a Belgian IPA."
"made the mistake of over chilling the first bottle, so this is bottle number two. this reminds me of a heffeweizen. very citrusy. nice carbonation. sweet, much too sweet for me. much better slightly chilled than it was really cold however. very nice aftertaste that lasts quite awhile. the head was there until the very end of the beer. decent but not something i would drink again. not something i would recommend for someone that doesn't like em sweet."
"All in all, a really fun beer that I would kill to try with some mango/habanero salsa and some enchiladas."
"Overall: It took me a while to figure out what I thought about this beer. I enjoy the bitterness along with the spice. Could have used a little less carbonation, but I enjoy it overall."
"Pours yellow, with more than enough carbonation. The egg shell white head rises rapidly when this beer is poured into a five-ounce straight-sided tasting glass. I poured this a little too cold, so I let it sit at room temperature for about 15 minutes. As the foam calms down there is quite a bit of lace left behind on the sides of the glass. This beer is remarkably clear for a farmhouse ale, but Boulevard is a big enough brewery that it can afford to tightly filter its beer. The nose is rather complex, mostly fruity and phenolic. Fruity and flowery hoppy with a very pleasant dry finish. Much better than the first time I tried it."
"M ~ So comfortable on the palate, aromas and flavor dance until the alcohol hits; flavors mask alcohol well when drank in 12 oz portion, but could see getting heavy handed in large bottle format."
"D - I don't think I could drink a lot of this in one sitting, but a wonderful full bodied saison."
"Music on the juke box: Tame Impala - ""alter ego"""
"This is an excellent saison, definitely one of the best from the US. Hoppy, almost in the Belgian IPA category. Another great beer from the Smokestack series."
"not bitter though, actually quite smooth. very mild fruit and banana bread. very mild in general. nice overall but for the price i doubt id get it again. check out colette by great divide. better farmhouse and better price"
"This is a very well done beer that I really enjoyed."
"This is one of my first experiences with a saison. It was very enjoyable and I'll definitely start trying more in this style. Thanks again kansascitytrader!"
"O: Wow. This is simply the best saison I've had yet. It's everything the style should be and a little bit more. I'll certainly be returning to Tank 7, and I'm thankful that Boulevard has introduced the 12oz bottles as the 8% abv can sneak up on you. Boulevard has proven itself again with this outstanding beer, and is quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries."
"This beer is a pleasure to drink and dissect. It's worth every penny."
"Creamy mouthfeel, lightly carbonated but it flows well, excellent stuff."
"O- This is a fantastic Saison overall. Wonderful representation of the style. It has that classic funky, bready, bitter, floral, citrus profile that saisons should have-but kicked up a notch in most departments to make it even better. Another great Boulevard Beer. In other news-unbelievable that have had saison Brett 4 times and have yet to review it"
"O: Really happy to be drinking this right now, and will definitely buy again. Almost a comfort-food type of beer-- nothing loud, but leaves a warm feeling in the tummy. Just plain good."
"O: Very good beer. Light enough for a summer day with enough flavor for a cooler winter night."
"Overall pretty good, not quite a summer drink as the booze and overall malt content are a bit higher, some interesting hop characters as it seems to go from grassy and tropical fruit, to mild grassy and earthy, to earthy and spicy on the finish. Nice malt characters, and fruit, no off flavors, mild booze, tasty."
"Best by 6/11 on the bottle"
"o - such a quaffable beer, just begs for more sips."
"A nice, refreshing saison that is a good representation of the style if not a bit too straightforward. I'd gladly buy it again. Another win for Smoke Stack."
"O-Good warm weather beer from Boulevard.Clean and safe offering from them."
"Overall- This has been a great Farmhouse Ale and for now is going to be our first Saison/Farmhouse ale @ the Wolf Public House! Even though I love this ale, there is no way I could drink all night due to the ABV. Could be tough for others as well. Still good though."
"D - Had this with some great BBQ from Luling City Market, matched the food well to my taste, very refreshing and almost palate cleansing."
"picked up a 12 oz. single (cool bottle) in Ft. Collins"
"Inviting aroma is a mix lemon, sweet tarts, grass, and light peppery notes. Alcohol and malt character is barely noticeable. Overall a complex, yet clean aroma. Barely hazy pale yellow colored beer holds a swarm of carbonation that supports a tall, dense, bright white head that holds doesn't budge. Light flavors of lemon, spicy yeast and faint grassy/earthy notes. Lightly sweet up front, but that fades towards the end as the mild bitterness kicks in. Finish is dry with minimal alcohol warmth. Moderately light body with high carbonation support the dry finish. No tart character, which is fine with me. Overall a complex, delicate, high drinkable beer. Extremely thirst quenching. A great warm weather beer."
"Not a style I try often but this is a very enjoyable beer. Light and refreshing and great for a hot summer evening."
"O: Alcohol is well-hidden here. Wanted a bit more complexity with the malt & spices. Wasn't exactly blown away here, but this is a good saison worth a buy."
"Overall, a very good saison and a definite re-buy!"
"(D)- An excellent saison. Maybe a tad high in carbonation, but otherwise this is a top notch beer for the style."
"This beer has been in my cellar for a while. With spring in the air, it seems like a good time to break out a Farmhouse Ale. This one is dark yellow with a big foamy white head. The aroma is dominated by hops--just a few bready notes from the malt. The palate feels about right with lots of carbonation and nimbleness. The flavor profile again showcases the hops. The Amarillo hops provide a big citrus kick. Some pine notes are mixed in as well. The beer lacks a little freshness--that thirst quenching summerness of a farmhouse ale is wanting. I would like to see some more pale malt to balance this thing out. Some yeast and spice are proxies in that role. Overall, this is certainly drinkable and enjoyable, I would just like the citrus, piney hops toned down for a beer of this style."
"Poured into a chalice a cloudy yellow color, nice carbonation, very nice two-finger creamy/foamy white head, with lots of sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some yeast, slight hop note, coriander, bananna. The taste is malty, yeasty, slightly hopped, with some nice spice notes, slightly peppered. Medium Body. Drinkable, a nice Saison."
"Shout-out to GCurlow for the bottle. Pours a nice bright hazy gold with a shining white head, good lookin' and lively. Super floral nose, faint peach and some yeasty fruity esters, really a beaut. Excellent fresh flavor, grassy and floral, doughy, a nice balance of light malt and herbal hops, crisp and clean. Nice body on the palate though remains crisp and refreshing. Definitely a nice beer for the warming spring season or anytime. Another impressive brew from Boulevard."
"A little too sweet to be highly drinkable, this beer nevertheless has good complexity but would also be a great treat on a hot summer afternoon."
"Liked everything but the floaties. Didn't see anyone else mention them in their reviews?"
"Scores: Appearance 4.5/5; Aroma 4/5; Taste 3.5/5; Mouthfeel 4/5; Drinkability 4/5"
"M,D: lingering hop in back of mouth, tingle on tongue. Very nice and drinkable."
"Very nice golden color with a big, thick, foamy pure white head. Lacing all over the glass. The smell is nice with hints of fresh flowers and pepper. It is slightly earthy, but there is a nice hoppy fruitiness as well. There is also a scent of a very nice dry Belgian yeast. The taste is a little more overpowering than the smell. It is sugary sweet, not quite cloying though. I get a slightly unpleasant booziness that takes away from the drinkability. Not very complex and really just a tad too hot for a saison. Not my favorite from boulevard."
"This is a wonderful american interpretation of the Belgian farmhouse/saison style. Tasty, complex, smooth, crisp, and refreshing. Love it."
"D - very well done all around, one of the better Saisons I have had. nice, interesting mix of dry but with bits of fruitiness and yeast action going on as well."
"****I feel like I should issue a disclaimer with my review a bit. This is not my favorite style, so hopefully I'm treating it fairly.****"
"Big thanks to BucketBoy for knocking this off my 'wants'. 750ml corked and caged bottle served in my ST tulip. Batch number 7-9303; best by 10/10 indicated on the back label. Pours a translucent golden-orange with a dense, cascading 3.5 inch, rocky, bright white head that eventually settles into a quarter inch cap. Some spots and strands of textured lacing revealed during the tasting. Nose is fairly clean - citrus, lemon zest, and light, herbal aromatics. Taste follows nose - there's some citric acid as well as bitter grapefruit - flavors fall somewhere between a domestic farmhouse and a Belgian IPA as there is a light, herbal hoppiness to the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light and lively with an assertive, almost prickly carbonation and some astringency that light stimulates the salivary glands along the cheeks and the taste buds across the back of the tongue, before culminating in a crisp, semi-dry finish. A very solid domestic saison; however, citrus astringency is a bit too aggressive. Also a little too bitter and lacking that refreshing farmhouse quality."
"Pours a nice golden color with a fluffy white head and plenty of good lace. The aroma is spicy just mildly funky with just a hint of alcohol. Flavor follows with the spiciness and the mild funkiness. There is a hint of bubblegum right up front that makes you think it's going to go sweet, but the rest of the flavor is remarkably dry."
"Note: Mellows and opens up a bit as it warms up. Not nearly as bitter with some citrus notes showing up."
"Extremely drinkable. A good session beer. Even at that high ABV, the alcohol is completely disguised. One of Boulevard's best offerings."
"D: A fantastic Americanized Saison. Really funky and fun."
"On tap at the Fallen Rock. A huge head, yellow body. Pleasant aromas and a nice bitterness. Served a bit cold, on a freezing night. Belgian yeast, the beverage seems more to me as a Belgian IPA, with some lemon and grapefruit and other nice fruit. Nothing overt."
"It has mellow yeast spicy smell it is also very grainy. The body looked super model hot. It was cloudy and gold with a lot of carbonation but settled in the foam just right. The flavor was pasture and grain like with some spice. This was a very refreshing beer but could be very versatile. The feel was medium and very drinkable."
"It's a fantastically good beer and I'm gonna try and get this by the case"
"The body was medium-light, clean and nicely tongue coating. Drinkability was very good, as I find all good Saisons to be. Overall, a very nice example of the style. Worth trying if you see it."
"An enjoyable beer with some strong phenolic elements going on. Has some excellant qualites."
"Poured into my Dfh snifter, fluffy, cloud like head immediately fills my glass, and hangs around awhile before reseeding. Pours a light amber color, with nice barnyard, citrus, and banana scent. Taste- first the carbonation that you would want from a saison gets you, some apple flavors, some nice bitterness, and as it warms, some sweet and funky orange flavor. I love this beer, my best Saison so far."
"All in all, a lovely saison style ale. I could see drinking a lot of this in the summer."
"D: I'm glad they are selling this in sixers now and definitely feel it is a wise decision. I'll grab more of this stuff when I head back to visit family again in the Midwest."
"The lesson to be learned here is that Boulevard Tank 7 Farmhouse Ale is good beer even when approaching its 'best by' date. My suspicion is that the taste and drinkability scores would both have earned 4.5s if I had popped the cork last summer or fall."
"Boulevard just re-defined my understanding of Saison/Farmhouse ales. I'd had only 2 or 3 before this one, but Tank 7 might be one of the best beers I've ever had, regardless of style."
"D-high drinkability a little sour, a little funk, nice fruits,some pepper, nice zest crisp and very good..highly recommended"
"Drinkability: My favorite beer at the moment. First had this one on tap at Fiorella's Jack Stack BBQ (Freight House location in downtown KC, blocks from the brewery) and it blew me away. I've had it in the 750 corked bottle and the 12-oz. capped bottle and love this beer every time. I desire this beer more than any other I've tried to date. I have a lot of world-class beers to try yet, but that's why I'm on here! Cheers!"
"I could drink this all day."
"Bottle. I was happy I was able to find a small bottle of this instead of having to buy one of the bigger bottles. Poured into my Duvel tulip glass a very slightly hazed golden straw color with a bone white fluddy head. Such a rich aroma of wheat, slight pepper, grapefruit, along with some slight booze notes. Light mouthfeel with carbonation. Sweet start gives way to a nice belgian style yeast flavor of spices and slight fruit. Ends dryly with a lingering citrus rind bitterness. Minimal lace."
"D: Something about it is kind of weird, but I still kind of like it."
"I can see how the brewer decided this was an improvement on the original Saison that was in the Smokestack series, as the hops are definitely more complex here - still slightly prefer Saison Brett. from their line-up as it has a bit more ""farmhouse"" flavor...but this is great on a warm day (85ºF here on this Winter Sunday, making me wonder if Los Angeles fell into the Southern Hemisphere when I wasn't looking)."
"Probably won't buy again."
"Opinion: This beer has a lot of characteristics of a tripel. We don't get too many farmhouse ales here in Texas, and I only really understand this style to know that it varies. This beer is on the big side, but it remains really approachable. There isn't anything about this beer that clashes against your palate, so it is well crafted, no doubt. I would definitely recommend this beer and would like to drink it again. Testimony...good beer!"
"D: Pretty good drinkability. More of a summer night nightcap beer. You can tell its 8%."
"Like drinking sunshine."
"The drinkability could be a little higher. I've had other Saisons that just feel lighter than this one and feel a bit more refreshing as a result. Overall, a great Saison from Boulevard, but it's not going to blow anyone away like Saison Brett."
"D: The phenols are nearly outrageous. If not for this, I think it be pretty drinkable. I actually had to drain pour it after it warmed up further."
"Tastes of sweet malts, citrus hops and sices with a dry finish. This is a really tasty brew with a little bit of bitterness. The alcohol is well hid. I'll definitely be seeking this one out again. It's highly drinkable and I think that most anyone should be able to enjoy this brew."
"D: Perhaps not my cup of tea, but good nonetheless. I wouldn't have another, but I liked it better than the last saison I drank."
"Pairs well with food, and likely best shared, though a 750 was no problem solo."
"D -- Very good. I will be making a return purchase on this."
"Highly recommended!"
"D: Excellent. I initially wasn't sure of the hop aroma and flavor but I could drink this beer anywhere, anytime, and lots of it."
"D - this is a pretty decent saison. I was hoping it would be a little less subtle in the nose and on the palate, but it was still pretty decent nonetheless. Would I get it again, sure. Is it something I would seek out, probably not. I'll go for Saison Brett if I am buying a Boulevard Saison."
"I had this about six months ago in a 750 and remembered liking it quite a bit. I'm wondering whether a bit of age helped the first bottle I had, but maybe this is just a factor of reviewing blind. Very interesting, to say the least."
"An above average straight forward saison worth trying."
"D: Compared to other beers I've had in this style, this one is surprisingly mellow and light, while still managing to pack the punch of a alcohol warmth and jus the right amount of hop bitterness. Pretty fantastic drinkability for a Saison."
"drinkability a great saison in 12oz bottles makes this my new must go to sasion"
"Bottle: Poured a hazy and cloudy beige color ale with a super large frothy head with great retention and some very good lacing. Aroma of fruity ester with spicy yeast and semi-sweet malt backbone. Taste is very well balanced with great notes of fruity ester with lightly pepper yeast with a solid malt backbone that is just a tad too sweet. Body is full with limited filtration and great carbonation with no apparent alcohol. Another great beer from a brewery that just keep surprising me."
"O: Had this when it was 28 degress outside, nota good fit. However, this beer would rock in the summer."
"Drink- Pretty damn good! Thanks, JeepCop for the extra. I owe ya one!"
"UPDATE... Boulevard has since begun mass producing tank 7 and removed it from it's signature fermentation tank (obviously tank #7) that gave it its unique taste... The beer has greatly cheapened and the taste has dominated greatly. I was very disappointed when I discovered this. If you can still get your hands on a large smokestack bottle version of the beer I would still give it praise, but otherwise stay away."
"Good crisp mouth, as expected with the style. Moderate heft. Mildly sharp finish. The citrus comes through in the flavor, but where the spices were absent in the nose, they make themselves known more in the flavor. White peppery bite at the onset, mild funk in the middle, and there's even a nice grassy hop smack on the end. Good beer. I like all the various nuances of this one. Unique and satisfying."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Light bodied, medium carbonation makes for a very smooth mouthfeel. Easy drinking and one of the most flavorful saisons I've tried. Overall, this is my favorite Boulevard beer. I come back time and again and it never disappoints. It has garnered somewhat of a cult following in KC which is well deserved. Terrific favors, and is very easy drinking, however if you don't watch out it will kick you on the teeth in a hurry."
"This one pours a faint, cloudy orange in color with a three finger white head. It has funky, barnyard like aromas. It features straw, bread, and citrus. The taste is a little piny which surprised me. The flavors too are a little funky and has some straw to it. It's pretty flavorful. It drinks medium bodied and is moderately smooth. It's pretty drinkable. You'd never know it's 8%. It's a pretty solid interpretation of the style but not the best by any means."
"Notes: I definitely enjoyed this as a well balanced saison. Interesting on the tongue with all the flavors. Fruity, tart, sweet, and spice all present. Dangerously drinkable. Definitely worth picking up."
"The mouthfeel was medium with a fine sparkling carbonation. Very drinkable."
"Very dry in the mouth feel. Crisp and refreshing; however, a dry powdery feeling leaves this a dry one. There is a slight warmth from the alcohol, but not overpowering this brew's creativity."
"Overall, different and well worth a try."
"D- A really nice American take on the style. The more of this I drank, the more I enjoyed it."
"Despite being 8% ABV, this beer is very light and easy to drink due to the rich flavor and crispness. I could easily drink this beer all evening, and it would pair well with a wide variety of meals which makes it very accessible. I highly recommend you try this saison if you can find and afford it!"
"Not the best example of the style, but it's still damn good, and easy to put away!"
"Lighter body, with good carbonation. Seems like a hybrid of Belgian and American styles. Alcohol is well hidden. Nice beer."
"There's a bitter spicy finish and the body is on the thin side, making this dangerously drinkable for the strength. This is easily one of the best Belgian styles with American hops I've encountered."
"D - Great drinkability, not overpowering and the flavor profile is complex. Very nice."
"Drinkability - Quite drinkable. It was certainly not a chore to finish a 750 ml bottle, and not out of the question to pop open a second."
"D= Boulevard rarely dissapoints and this is another quality offering. Though it is different from many saisons I have had and loved (including Boulevard saison) it is still a very good beer that was way too easy to drink for the ABV level."
"Appearance is a cloudy, orange that holds very little head retention. Smell is very yeasty, fruity, and spicy. Taste is quite banana and citrus, yet clean midtones that allow room for tasting the malt. Medium body ale that catches up with you thanks to the 8%... an interesting brew worth at least a once-around, may not ask for this again - flavors were good and decent, but there was nothing I NEED taste again."
"D: Very tasty with good complexity, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is a nice beer to drink for a long time."
"A lot of visible carbonation, yet it doesn't feel that way in the mouth. Smooth, light, refreshing. Very drinkable."
"D - I think the hops are a little much but still fairly easy to drink."
"Pours a hazy deep yellow with a billowing white head that settles down to just a thin layer. A bit of spotty lacing on the sides of my tulip. Nose brings some grassy, herbal notes as well as a bit of American hops. Slightly earthy and a bit of grain as well. The taste is fairly smooth with hops and the grassy character competing against one another just a bit. Mouthfeel is nice with a fairly dry finish. Drinks quite well. Very solid."
"The taste has lots of toasted grains with a little toasted wheat with a dry gypsum mouthfeel. The hops and yeast seem to that that real Belgian farmhouse funk and earthiness. Another sensational and worthwhile saison that would make an ex-patriot Belgian shed a tear for their homeland."
"Notes: Another remarkable offering from the Smokestack Series. I'm really enjoying these big bottles from Boulevard."
"This beer pours a hazy golden-orange color. The head is a massive four inches in height, and recedes excruciatingly slow into a large cap of rocky, sticky lacing that lasts longer than the beer does. the aroma is of oranges, hay, pale malt, lemon, and a hint of spice. This is a very bright aroma, and is very inviting. The taste is more yeasty than the aroma. There is some good barnyard funk though out with nice hay, horse blanket, and mustiness. There is a hint of orange and lemon in the finish, but there aren't as strong as they are in the aroma. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with vibrant carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a very good beer that I will surely drink again."
"All in all, a very nice farmhouse ale. I tend to be hit or miss with saisons, and this was a hit. Very pleasant surprise. I enjoyed a few of these."
"D - While not a powerhouse, it is very nice to drink. For me it fits both a summer and winter drink. It's simple taste makes it refreshing for hot days, but the softness also makes it appealing to a cold night in front of the fireplace."
"This is much more hoppy than I expected, though not having read much on the beer beforehand that is not too surprising, and the American hops are certainly a nice touch. I was expecting this to be something a bit more like a ""traditional"" Saison, more like a riff on the retired Boulevard Saison, this is certainly not that, but it is tasty in its own right, but somehow I can't help but feel disappointed in some way. I can understand being enamored of interpreting classic styles coupled with American hops, I do it often myself, but sometimes (perhaps even often) a classic interpretation is really the best. This is a great beer, but not quite the equal of the Boulevard Saison, and the Saison Brett."
"Cheers!"
"Pouring a brilliantly clear light orange yellow with a dense white head, this is a great looking saison. Retention and lacing are great too. The nose is spicy, rather intensely so with a yeasty character along with a rather prominent phenolic yeast expression. A citrusy grapefruit hop character is rather prominent too. The palate opens mildly sweet with honey and citrus. There's a rather prominent american hop profile that doesn't entirely work with the yeasty spice. In some ways, this is a cross between a Belgian IPA and a saison, and as someone who doesn't necessarily see the need for tinkering with the style, this is a little disappointing. Rather intensely phenolic, this is drying and spicy on the finish with some hop character. Again, the fruity American hops are not something I think pairs well with the spicy and beautiful complexity that a saison can exude. Carbonation is moderate, and this beer is more than drinkable. I split a 750 with a co-worker, and this is something that I would drink again if it were available locally."
"D. Very drinkable. This is an incredbibly smooth beer while being complex and full of flavor. Might be a bit partial since Saison is one of my favorite styles and Boulevard is one of my favorite breweries, but this is a very good Smokestack Series beer."
"D: Very drinkable, the weight slows you down some, but this is one to sip and enjoy anyway. Overall this is a great saison and another incredible offering from the guys at Boulevard!"
"Thanks to the persnickity Tank 7 at boulevard for this delight."
"Tank 7 Farmhouse ale was hazy and golden in color. It had a thick white head with good retention and lots lacing sticking to the glass. The aroma was spices and light citrus. The taste was citric hops and spice upfront followed by light bready malt with a light bitterness, more hops and peppery spice coming towards the finish. The finish was dry and lingering with some throat warming alcohol becoming noticeable. The mouthfeel was good with a medium body and plenty of carbonation. Drinkability was good. This is a nice ale and worth a try."
"D: The saison doesn't feel like it's 8%. It does, however, have a rich flavor and pleasant finish. Thanks Bill, this one is very nice."
"Alcohol is on the higher side, but there is so much carbonation and flavor layers, you don't notice it at all. Tastes like a much lighter beer. Very enjoyable!"
"Beer is medium body. Mildly sweet. Mild bitter. Great drinkability. Mild overall. Like it. Would have it again."
"drinkability: solid saison and would recommend"
"Tank 7 = yum. Real nice golden straw/hey color with a soapy white head, though not much lacing or head retention. Aroma is tops, grassy earthy hay and straw, nice noble hops, some lovely spicy yeast and actually candy sugar. Flavor mirrors aroma. Clean grassy, simple malt bill, earthy noble hops and again weird for the style but I taste candy sugar. Great dry finish as a saison should be, could have higher carb however. Plenty nice."
"D - Drink on and enjoy! Just don't be fooled, the ABV will eventually catch up with you!"
"Overall this isnt what I expected when I saw ""Farmhouse Saison", but regardless, it was very tasty."
"Drinkability is ok, but this one just ain't coming together for me. To much noble hops I guess makes it kind of soapy, and it's a bit to strong to have the quenching digestibility I look for in the style."
"Overall/notes: Never had a Farmhouse ale before, and I must say, it's pretty damn good. Maybe I didn't like it as much as their tripel, but honestly, that was a tough act to follow, and this did just fine. After a couple of weeks drinking Stag and vodka (college student with 2 partiers for roommates), this Smokestack series has been a nice breath of fresh air. Definitely beers worth purchasing."
"drinkability is good for a bigger saison. a real treat but perhaps more delicious hop flavor present than i like saison."
"Mouth feel is a little heavy but really easy to drink. Comes across as hoppy. Alcohol is hidden. The first time I got this one, I didn't like it that much; but it has grown on me and I relish it now."
"D: ABV seems a little high for a saison (I'm feeling a bit light-headed) but the crispness and thickness is very nice. Not my favorite but good nonetheless. I'm hoping the bottle of Saison Brett (of which Tank 7 is the base beer) is better than this."
"This is a great beer. While the alcohol is slightly high, it is not noticeable in any form and is a very delicious and refreshing beer."
"D: Pretty high. I mean this is not ""chugable", and the abv weighs it down slightly, but all in all pretty good"
"Drinks typically of the smokestack series, very fine indeed. However, it was inferior to their now retired Saison, which I liked better and wish they hadn't retired."
"Thanks to ridglens on this one, and all of the other Boulevards Smokestack series stuff. This is an extremely refreshing light citrusy brew, and for 8%, that is good stuff. Funky earthy with a sweet very light finish. I could drink this all day, and can imagine on tap it is even better. You need to pisk one of these up if your a saison fan."
"Overall I could spend a night drinking this, but I wouldn't go out of my way to pick it up."
"D-this has all the nice flavors you want to see in a saison, the earthy funk is done just right with a good amount of sweetness and a nice herbal presence. the spice is a little light and the finish wasn't as dry as some of the top notch saisons, but very tasty and drinkable beer."
"D- the 8% is barely represented here. It drinks very easily and cleanly for me."
"I can be touch and go over most saisons. This one was certainly not bad, but I didn't really find myself reaching to refill my glass either."
"D: Pretty good overall"
"My head is telling me to note how assertive the dryness is, but that certainly didn't stop me from taking down my glass in just a few minutes."
"D: Not too bad, if the phenols were not there it would be real real nice."
"D - Almost mehhh territory, but not quite. Definitely a notch below the average Smokestack brew."
"D: Very drinkable. A surprising balance. Hop and malt character complements this style. Alcohol not too hot."
"What can i say about my new favorite beer. this one caught me by surprise as i've never tried saison's. the drinkability, flavor, appearance were all off the charts. i will be trying the 6th glass and bbq ales shortly from boulevard as they are light years ahead of my local tx breweries w/their smokestack series of beers."
"Golden yellow color with a white head that sticks a while. Pretty hazy after the final pour. Nose is pretty soft and pleasant; floral with fruity notes as well as some spicing. The flavor profile comes off pretty large for style (high ABV as well): on the front end, it's pretty sweet and floral, with enough citrics to pass muster for a saison. The spicing comes back with some coriander and ginger notes, along with pepper. Big mouthfeel for the style, but very drinkable overall. Interesting take on the Farmhouse style, but very tasty nonetheless."
"had it again from a bottle about a month later and the flavor was more balanced... funky and mature. a solid american saison... totally traditional... very nice and brisk."
"This is missing the tartness, mustiness and intense dryness... but I barely miss them in this very complex brew. Just another tribute to the diversity of this style I suppose."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden, with a medium pure white head. Smells of spicy herbs and a bit of lemon. Taste is a hint of honey sweetness up fron, with a spicy yeast middle, and an herbal, flowery, dry hoppy finish. Surprisingly bitter for a saison, but in a good way. Medium mouthfeel, medium carbonation. Drinkability is good. A bit more bitter than the average saison, this is an excellent beer I would get again."
"D: This is good stuff. A nice drinkable beer, the alcohol is there but adds to the overall flavor."
"d - A pretty good saison. I enjoyed the smell a lot and would like to try again."
"Overall, a very refreshing beer perfect for the warm summer months when one needs an easy drinking beer that is still flavorful. Definitely worth your time and money"
"Medium body, with moderate carbonation. Nice complexity, crisp, and refreshing with the alcohol hidden quite well. Overall a well done example of the style."
"Got a beermail from someone at the brewery and I was told that Tank 7 is the base beer for Saison-Brett. Looks like my wish has come true! Now to find it..."
"D: Light and fairly easy to drink. The dry hops combined with the sugar sweetness is off-putting for me. Definitely not your typical saison. Some may like this take, but it's not my cup of tea (or beer as it may)."
"Thanks again BlueOkie!"
"D: It's a big bottle with above-average ABV, but most people could have one of these alone, but I would prefer splitting it with a friend on a nice afternoon in the shade."
"Medium bodied with soft tongue tickling carbonation up front followed by a very spicy and hoppy presence along with crisp light and fruit notes, bready yeast, slight alcohol heat and a long dry finish. Peppery spice and coriander are very prominent up front and they linger throughout, along with a dry bitter hop character, into the finish. Hints of apple, pear and banana along with grapefruit and lemon peel countered by a slight malt backbone, bready yeast and alcohol warmth. I'm also picking up a slightly tangy, earthy funk that adds a subtle tart character. The floral, perfumy flavor along with the alcohol hints are a bit much for my liking but overall this beer is complex and drinkable with a well masked ABV."
"Overall impression: She's a little like a girl you'd meet at a Widespread Panic concert dancing on the lawn. She looks great. She's very earthy and granola. You'd like to hang out all night, but you know you'll just end up in trouble if you make it an all-nighter."
"A sophisticated alternative to your standard summer beers."
"Notes: A decent saison though I liked their old saison a bit more when compared to this farmhouse ale. Quite complex overall but I find the bitterness to be a bit overpowering at times, would be better if this was more subdued throughout in my opinion."
"Bottom line? Are the Saisons you've tried too spicy for your palate? Give this one a go. Highly recommended!"
"I was going to break out something insanely rare for review #500, but decided against it at the last minute. This beer I am sure is just as good as any other, regardless of rarity. Tank 7 pours out a hazed golden color, and wears a quick to rise frothed head. The nose is full of musty wood, barnyard funk, tropical fruit, and pepper. The taste is nearly identical, but extremely dry, and with a whole hell of a lot of hops backing things up. The carbonation is high, which adds a great level of complexity to the big hop presence. Mouthfeel is really crisp, only furthering the drinkability of this brew. I have to say that this is one of my favorite styles of beer, and goddamn, this brewery knows how to make their Saisons. I will have to refer back to my review of Saison Brett to see which one rated higher. I cannot wait to see how this one stacks up against the soft shelled crab I am about to partake in. Cheers, and happy #500!"
"."
"a beefed up and hoppy saison; maybe not even a real saison but it has enough overall characteristics to be considered thus i guess. not as sour as i thougth it would be since it's labeled a farmhouse ale, but i'm ok with this. surprisingly quenching and refreshing for a high ABV ale. would make for a nice treat on a late afternoon warm spring day or a boozy boost on a colder, windy and wet spring day. either way this is pretty good and much more enjoyable than the first smokestack series beer i tried, the DWIPA."
"Well carbonated, medium bodied, and refreshing. The alcohol is well hidden for 8%, and sneaks up on you gradually. I will be buying this one again."
"Pretty good saison, a bit too spicy for my tastes, but refreshing and something I would probably try again..."
"Not a lot of identifiable saison-ness here. Given it blind, I'd assume it was an IPA, though a light-bodied one. It's still quite drinkable. Quaffable even, despite the strength."
"Drinkability: A huge step up over the regular saison, though 8.0% is nothing to sneeze at and it should be approached with caution. That being said, I think the word I've probably used the most above is ""straightforward."" It's simple. It's unassuming. It's well-made. And for that, it's a pretty darn good beer. Honestly, it's almost too simple, or too deceptively simple, and sometimes it's nice to have a certain measure of complexity in a beer that you have to work for (or is that only the line of a beeradvocate used to deconstructing things and writing reviews?), but I won't knock it much for that. One that's definitely worth seeking out."
"A very enjoyable saison. I have to say I think I like it more on draft - not sure I know why."
"Overall I was very impressed with this beer, a different beast than the saison brett but just as good. Well worth a shot."
"D - I am splitting this with my wife, but only because I love her. I am drinking it slowly, but I could drink it all night - the balance is just perfect."
"M & D - Nice fluffy and crisp feel. Good and well balanced profile. Refreshing and not too intense with ok ABV."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp. Very refreshing beer and easy to drink. I love it that this is a regular offering. This goes well with meals as well as on its own."
"D: This is a nice Farmhouse Ale from Boulevard. The flavor is very complex and the alcohol well masked. The beer was a very nice compliment to the cool and windy spring day I drank it on."
"Drinkability: Tasty, refreshing, well-balanced, easily drinkable -- I enjoyed it. A great late afternoon patio beer. Give it a try, won't you?"
"D: Very enjoyable. It doesn't taste alcoholic so it's very easy to drink. The overall flavors are very much what I like in a Belgian farmhouse ale. This one is a bit hoppier than most, but it's not in-your-face about it, which I like. The hops lend a subtle punch to the aroma and finishing bitterness. Boulevard has another hit on its hands here. I'm definitely gonna pick up another one of these."
"Flavor follows with distinct candy orange, moderate lemongrass, and some hibiscus. Nice sweetness accompanies tart/sourness. Moderate maltiness, fruit, and floral tones. Finishes dry and herbal/tart. Tastes quite good. Feels good. Good drinkability."
"Mouthfeel was amazing, as was drinkability."
"Verdict: An amazingly solid Saison, Tank 7 is complex and simple at the same time. It drinks fast and refreshes well, yet has a deep well of flavors and a well-hidden punch. Any American brewer that can produce a Saison this good should be very proud."
"Another wonderful offering from the Smokestack series, and another great saison as well. This really does become much more complex as it warms up. Something I highly recommend."
"D: For the ABV highly drinkable, this brew definitely met my high expectations. The Boulevard Smokestack Series continues to impress."
"Overall, a really good saison that I highly recommend. Another excellent outing in the Smokestack series. Gonna age one and see how it develops. Really good as-is but I have a feeling it might be great with some aging and mellowing of the spice. Rotation - coming to TX any day now. Got this from ummagum as an extra. As-is couple a year maybe more after cellaring."
"Pours a hazy yellow with a large white head. The aroma is Belgian yeast, spices and some citrus. As the beer warms, you get some flowery aromas. The flavor is citrus - mainly lemons and oranges - as well as yeast, spices and flowers. Medium mouthfeel, low to medium carbonation and a very dry finish."
"D: Yet another fantastic Boulevard Smokestack beer!"
"Poured from a corked and caged 750ml into a goblet. Pours a rich gold color, with orange highlights. Beautiful two fingers of fluffy head, great lacing and head retention. Probably the most visually appealing saison I've ever poured into my glass. However, I didn't buy one just to look at it... So here we go! Smells are of fresh flowers and grass along with spices. Belgian yeast, citrus hops, ripe bananas, very dry finish. The mouthfeel is light-medium bodied, with a medium amount of carbonation. I love how drinkable this beer is, such great flavors with no hint of the alcohol, until you finish the bottle and try to stand up. 8.0 ABV will sneak up on you, because its such a smooth drinker. A+ offering from Boulevard!"
"One of the best, most easily drinkable and most sublte, soft, and most intresting beers I tried this weekend. Would love to have this again."
"750ml bottle $9. Super huge head on this, tenacious and bubbly. Its orange in color with a ton of bubbles rushing to the surface. it smells like citrus and dust but not really belgian. The flavor is more citrus and not enough spice in my opinion. Still this is a good beer and extremely easy to drink for the ABV. Saison Brett is much better."
"A really good Saison that definitely benefits from being bottled as the draft version is inferior to this. I still prefer the original Smokestack Saison, but this is one of the better Amercanized Saisons out there."
"Easy to drink, watch out for the abv as it will sneak up on you in a hurry."
"THis is not a homerun, but a decent brew and a welcome addition to the stellar line-up of Boulevard Smokestack Series brews."
"Drinks too easy, ABV is completely masked, nice effort with decidedly American slant. Another killer Saison from Boulevard! I may even prefer this to the saison-brett... must revisit..."
"This is clearly one of the best Saisons on the market. It hadn't occurred to me until I read other reviews, but between this and Saison Brett, Boulevard has positioned itself as one of the top Saison producers not only in the US, but in the world. And they have done it silently. Maybe BAs should give more props to good Saisons."
"I'd go for a bottle of this, but I'm afraid it would come in the $12 for a 750ml range, just a bit too much for this brew."
"The finish is very sharp is and a wonderful dryness lingers long after the sip is gone. This quality alone makes this the most interesting, best tasting saison ever. If the taste alone doesn't warrant another sip the finish makes you pick the glass right back up and enjoy some more. The drinkability is beyond great and the is one that is just as good out of the bottle as on draft. It's gonna be hard to keep these in the fridge"
"Poured a corked and caged 750 into my Boulevard Tank 7 tulip. Thanks Boulevard for such a lovely glass and a even lovlier beer to put into it. This beer pours a super hazy golden straw with a massive, rocky, bright white head that leaves lacing stickier then the vast majority of Double IPA's. Absolutly beautiful. The aroma is amazing. It hits you up front with big notes of mango and pineapple finishing with freshly ground white pepper, hay, damp grass, a bit of clove and just a slight medicinal aroma at the finish. The flavor is amazing. Big fleshy fruits up front leaving freshly cut mango lingering on the palate. Next comes what you expect from a Saison. Massive hay notes, cut grass, ground pepper, yeasty biscuits, a touch of clove and some freshly zested lemon. Beautiful. This is one big, bad mother of a Saison. At 8 percent, the alcohol is masterfully hidden. The mothfeel is full but doesn't have that stereotypical dryness that I prefer in my Saisons. Its something little but hey, we have to find flaws in everything don't we. This is easily (well besides Saison-Brett) my favorite Boulevard brew. Thanks Boulevard guys and gals for living up to my hopes."
"750ml corked bottle served in a Tank 7 tulip. Bottle conditioned. Lots of carbonation in this one! Poured a pale gold with a big white head. Nice aroma with lots of citrus fruit and some piney hops. Light to medium bodied with a spritzy mouthfeel. A bit phenolic, but not in a bad way. Some hop bitterness, but not as much as the aroma would suggest. Plenty of spice in the finish. Very drinkable."
"An earlier reviewer mentioned that, and I had thought the same before reading it, Boulevard could survive and get much respect as a saison/farmhouse ale-only brewery ala Fantome. Thank goodness that Boulevard does more, but the brewery is indeed the American masters of the Saison style. No one else can touch them when it comes to Saison. Since I both love saisons and live in KC it is kind of perfect for me. Now that Tank 7 is in bottles, those of you throughout Boulevard's distribution need not miss out on this little slice of near-perfection. A must-try."
"M- Starts sweet and oily and finishes with a dry bitter bite."
"4.5/4/4/4/4.5"
"If they didn't have as many other great beers (and if they were a Belgian brewery), I think they could get away with something like what Fantôme does making only saisons/farmhouse ales. I think this beer is better than their original Saison, so I'm not really going to miss it too much, but I also don't see what's wrong with having three saisons if there all very good."
"Dangerously drinkable at 8.3%. Consider yourself warned."
"I'm trying not to be a ""homer"" here, but I love this beer. A unique and enjoyable beer - it's nice to get truly excited about drinking a beer. Thanks BLVD for having a ""persnickity"" fermenter."
"Tank 7 is the most distinctive, well-crafted beer I've ever had by Boulevard, and one of the most striking, unique, and enjoyable beers I've had the pleasure to try this year."
"I'll admit it, Saison isn't my favorite style, by far. It seems I either really like em', or really hate em', with the ones in the latter category being the most prominent. That being said, this beer, as well as the Saison regular and the Saison Brett, are changing all of that very quickly."
"D - Absolutely, I dont drink Saison alot, but this one was Fantastic. One of the top ones at the tasting."
"There is some funk in the flavor, not sure if there is a hint of brett in here or if the yeast has a bit of extra funkadelic-ness. Whatever it is, it is tasty. Hops are a bit sharp and would mellow out nicely in a bottle. There is some wheat tang in here that works with the relatively high ABV and bitterness to contribute a dry, spicy finish. This is a bold and flavorful saison, not quite as thirst-quenching as some of the classic Belgian versions but it is a tasty brew that I would happily buy again."
"Draught @ brewery tour: This one poured a slightly hazy golden color. There was a good sized white head on it that left some lacing. This one has a complex nose. Grassy, earthy, spicy, yeasty, floral, some lemon. It has an equally good taste. I like the little kick of bitterness in there. A bit of citrus and slight piny hops, earthiness, coriander, This is a very nice brew."
"D - This is a very good saison. Great funky character withjust enough sweetness to balance things out."
"Boulevard is quickly and quietly building their reputation as makers of insanely good Belgain beer styles that remain distinctly American. Tank 7 Saison upholds this trend, delivering a blend of vanilla, pale malt, tangerine, coriander, white pepper, and piny hops. Finishes dry and bitter, but soft and juicy at the same time. Tight carbonation on the tongue, with a medium body that makes for exceedingly high drinkability. Recommended."
"D- Very enjoyable. Expect no less from the Smokestack Series."
"Taste follows the nose. A bit breadier than indicated through the nose, but this helps put the spices in line. Zest, clove, some banana and citrus. Hops in the back cleans out the palate for a fresh, new sip. Very drinkable"
"drinkability is good. nice balance. good depth. love hte citrus and floral character. i could drink this all day."
"Good stuff from Boulevard. I wonder if they'll put this stuff in a bottle."
"Pours a hazy straw with a white head. Good lacing. Nose has wheaty malts, citrus and a collection of spices. Taste has sweet malts, citrus fruits and more herbal spices. Body is a bit light, but still pretty easy to drink. Perhaps more of a Belgian Pale Ale, but still a decent beer."
"Overall Impression - This is good saison and another good beer in the Smoke Stack series, but not completely representitive of the style. Worth a try. In fact, I'm going to order a second glass now."
"On tap at the Stem and Stein in Madison, AL. Orange blossom color to the pour with thin top that dissipated too quickly. It might have just been a bad pour and it was served too cold. Spices and citrus hops in the nose and taste. A little bit of a tart finish. Loads of carbonation. I was surprised to learn that it's 9% ABV. The alcohol is noticeable as it goes down but not THAT noticeable."
"Pours a hazy golden yellow, some orange highlights, thin white head forms, drops to a medium ring and leaves some size chunks of lace on the glass. Smell is neat, lots of citrus and wheat, grapefruit, floral, yeasty, light spice, strawberries, toast, honey, like a hopped up saison. Taste is similar, but fruitier, apricots, citrus, floral, grapefruit and orange peel, some caramel and honey sweetness, lightly funky, except the finish reminded me of pickles. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation, pretty drinkable. An amped up saison, but for some reason it didn't totally sit right with me, but good stuff."
"A bit of a stretch for a saison, this one, but very flavorful and refreshing. I recommend it, and look forward to enjoying more and more of this one."
"Pours a cloudy, golden color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of tart malt, sweet malt, yeast, clove, and slight banana. Fits the style of a Saison / Farmhouse Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and slightly thick with an average carbonation level. There is a slight bitterness associated with this brew. Tastes of floral hops, tart malt, slight sweet malt, some pine, and slight spice (ginger?). Overall, more hops than I'm used to in a Saison, but I still enjoyed this brew a lot."
"Overall, I enjoyed th brett version more. This one has too much farmhouse flavor going on. This beer is actually starting to give me a slight buzz so 1 will be all I have."
"D: Very easy to gulp, despite the higher ABV. I downed three pints of this in about 40 minutes without hardly realizing it. An absolutely excellent brew."
"Nose had the distinctive musty/yeasty scent of a Farmhouse beer. The color was a slightly cloudy deep-gold. There was not much of a head, more just some white wisps floating atop the beer. Mouthfeel was medium with a dry, musty flavor underlain with honey. Unquestionably saison! I thought that it would be a good summer seasonal, provided that it was not served ice-cold and I would not want a whole bunch, given its ABV. It would be drinkable, but not overly so. Warming, it took on a really dry black pepper taste."
"D - Could session one of these and where is the alcohol? They could improve the flavor by adding additional spices and increasing retention, but otherwise a really drinkable and enjoyable beer. Wish they bottled it."
"Had this at Stub and Herbs with some friends. Instantly it reminded me of Hennepin without the Funk, and through and through, that's what it was. A decent carbonation, not too strong in any flavor. This would be a great beer to start to introduce people to Belgians with, IMO. Didn't take much notes other than score though."
"Good stuff, but I won't be seeking this out again. It's an above average Saison, but it's not even this breweries best. For the price I paid, it was well worth it, and if there are lesser options, I'll get it again. But if I'm going to be reaching for a Boulevard Saison, it's not going to be this one."
"A nice light creamy body that's light and refreshing in this blazing summer heat, and approachable enough my non-craft drinking friend loved it!"
"The best thing about this beer is that the drinkability is high for a 8.5% beer. You can easily ask to pour a few more."
"Edit: 6/20/09 I have been informed that there is no Brett in this beer, though it is the base for the Saison Brett."
