The brett dryness and fruity taste are perfectly balanced. What's especially wild is that the beer's appearance is opaque and pulpy from all the peach bits floating around in it. Just don't expect a ridiculously strong and sweet peach juice taste, as this is still certainly a brett beer that just happens to have peach as one of its main ingredients. It's all in perfect balance here, and they clearly hit what they were going for. And this really doesn't taste like 10%, I could drink it all day. Crisp, fizzy, fruity, funky, just delicious.","krustster","Nov 15, 2014"

4.22,-5.4,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, best before 1/2019. Pours slightly hazy golden orange color with a 2 finger dense and rocky white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big juicy and lightly tart peach, apricot, pineapple, lemon zest, white grape, pear, green apple, white pepper, honey, bread, hay, straw, grass, light musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with awesome balance and complexity of fruity/spicy/funky yeast, peaches, and pale malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of lightly tart peach, apricot, pineapple, lemon zest, white grape, pear, green apple, white pepper, honey, bread, hay, straw, grass, light musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of yeast spiciness and slight tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of peach, apricot, pineapple, lemon zest, white grape, pear, green apple, white pepper, honey, hay, straw, light funk, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of fruity/spicy/funky yeast, peaches, and pale malt sweetness; with a great malt/yeast spiciness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly slick/prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome fruited brett saison. All around great complexity and balance of fruity/spicy/funky yeast, peaches, and pale malt sweetness; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV.

A big wave of barnyard funk follows and it leaves a dry, tannic feel on your tongue. Soft oak, brett, peach pit and chalky malt. Everything is really well balanced and the peaches are a great addition. Mouthfeel is medium with some tight carbonation that allows all of the flavors to come through without being too distracting. The slightest bit of warmness on the swallow is the only trace of the 10%. A really well done beer.","notchucknorris","Apr 30, 2014"

It brings to mind just how disappointing it is that brewing with fresh fruit is such an expensive proposition, because when done well, beers with fresh fruit are hard to beat. This one is no different, and whoever thought of adding that distinctive yeast known as Brettanomyces to a peach-infused beer was a genius. The natural characteristics of the fruit work well with the funk of the brett. I will likely buy this every time I have the opportunity, as it is outstanding.","LambicPentameter","Mar 28, 2014"

4.55,2,4.25,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.5,"2014 Vintage. So happy I snagged a bottle of this...apparently only a few cases made it to the central valley this year. Pours a hazy golden color with a large white head that goes down fairly quickly. Scent is AMAZING! Packed with wild yeast and peaches. Especially as this beer warms, the peach aroma builds up and the brett comes out beautifully. Taste is a little more tart than the aroma would imply...which is never a bad thing. Peach skin and funky farmhouse flavors up front. Slightly tart peach flavors with great farmhouse flavors and barnyard hay. This beer is not spicy at all... straight up fruit, barnyard, and funk. So damn tasty. The peach comes out more and more with each sip. Mouthfeel is a bit dry and full-bodied. Drinkability is very high, as the ABV is well-hidden. This 10% farmhouse ale is not boozy in the slightest bit. Overall, Logsdon never seems to disappoint, especially with this one. Such an amazing farmhouse ale. The peaches shine brilliantly in this one. Believe the hype.","DovaliHops","Mar 19, 2014"

4.72,5.8,4.5,5,4.75,4.5,4.5,"An orchard in a glass. Lovely, fragrant nose that is pure, high summer peaches. The color is a golden amber, not unlike a Bellini. The taste is very fruit forward -- one of the biggest peach-flavored beers I've had this side of Chez Monus. You can almost feel the peach juice dribbling down your chin. Absolutely lovely. The sweet peach is firmed up by a bit of Brett funkiness and the barrel oak. This is as close to summer as you are going to get after a long, cold winter. Great beer, but I think I still might prefer the Seizoen Bretta a bit more. The subtleties of the saison are drowned out a bit by the intense peachiness. Still, a great beer.","jjdc","Mar 05, 2014"

Sampled one of two bottles I still have left from the most recent release, and the peach flavor is already starting to subside a bit. It was stil tasty, but when very fresh, the peach flavor is prominent and just amazing, whereas now it's just one more voice in the flavor profile chorus. Still good, don't get me wrong, but when very fresh, this beer is just out of this world.","John_M","0"
4.43,-0.7,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall- Great beer that is definitely worth the 20 bucks. I would definitely take one of these over any Cascade beer (not that they're necessarily comparable but in regard to the price point). Reminds me a lot of La Fin du Monde which also doesn't have great complexity but is exceptional at the few things it does do. A must try if you can get your hands on it. While I'm scoring this lower than what I scored Seizoen Bretta, I'm under the impression that this is a better beer. I will have to sample the regular Bretta again to compare.","artoolemomo","Feb 20, 2014"

The beer smells of fresh peaches. The taste is everything that is great about Seizoen Bretta but with beautful peach and floral notes.

Slightly puckering with pit and fleshy fruit flavor.  Very complex but it's one of most balanced beers I've ever had.  Flavor and mouthfeel are nearly perfect.  I wasn't a fan of regular Seizoen or Seizoen Bretta but I highly recommend doing whatever it takes to try this one.","corby112","Sep 29, 2013"

I would put this above any other Saison I've had. And that is how I would characterize it after drinking it. Reads as a beautiful Saison with fruit. The Brett is apparent, but if you put this next to their other brews, the comparison would be obvious I think.

4.31,-3.4,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Poured a murky gloden orange in color with pale yellow highlights a half finger of bubbly head that left good wisps of lacing sticking to the glass. Good funky bretty character and peach fruit were noticeable upfron on the nose with hints of spice, herbs and wood oak with nice tarf qualities. The peach fruit was more apparent on the palate with good bretty barnyard funk, slight spice, hints of citrus zest alongside great oaky accents and a touch of apple pear flavor. The brew was medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a oaky, fruity, bretty funky, slight spice and tar finish. These dudes really now how to funk it up!","Gobzilla","Jan 19, 2013"

4.5,0.9,4.25,4.75,4.25,5,4.5,"Huge, huge thanks to boralyl for this one. Served in a cervoise. Pours a slightly-cloudy light peach color. Wow. Let's start that way. Nose has huge peach plus earth and mild funk. Dry and a bit creamy. Dry. Touch acidic. Some wheat. Incredible. Logsdon has really got some good things going.","Thorpe429","Dec 07, 2012"

4.5,0.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O: This is incredibly well-balanced and easy-drinking. There's no hint of the 10%. The brett and fruit are at a perfect level of expression. Very impressive, something I could drink all day.","Etan","Dec 04, 2012"

4.35,-2.5,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.25,"Overall I would have liked a little a little more peach flavor to balance the saison backbone but that aside this is probably the best Farmhouse ale (and definitely the best organically produced beer) I have ever had. I wouldn't call it a wild ale, per say, because it was more rustic and less overly sour or tart. The fact that this was 10% was ridiculous, it drinks like 7% max. Not a drop of alcohol. I would say crack this ASAP as I believe the peach flavor is fading and the Brett is really taking hold. I definitely plan to seek out more beers from this new Oregon farmhouse brewer.","claspada","Dec 02, 2012"

The 10% is nowhere to be found in this. I sure wish I could have had more than a couple ounces of this stuff. Fantastic beer and one I'll be seeking out in the future.","iadler","Beers"

4.5,0.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O: Goodness in a bottle, and I wish this wasn't such a limited release. Definitely not a beer for people who hate this particular stone fruit, though. I'm hesitant to age my other bottle because I'm afraid the peaches will disappear.","Sarlacc83","Jun 25, 2012"
4.25,-4.7,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"O - Amazing peach-saison of some sort...I wanted more but the bottle was crushed in 1 minute! I guess I'll have to track one of these down for myself...my wife would love this stuff.","Sean9689","Jun 22, 2012"
4.62,3.6,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,"O-Goddamn this is a good beer. THe peaches are so prevalent and taste. The brett characteristics are spot on and again the peach is so tasty. This beer is dangerous at 10%. Luckily it was hard to come by. This one and one for the cellar until the next release. David Logsdon touche.","BrewsoBrewco","Jun 14, 2012"

I really enjoyed this, and probably would consume an entire 750ml bottle if I didn't know there was a monster hangover waiting at the end. I think some age might reveal some added complexity. I liked this a fair bit more than Seizoen Bretta.","MasterSki","Jun 03, 2012"
4.03,-9.6,4.5,4,4,4,4,"O: I would have liked a little a little more tartness and sourness for a wild ale, but it was really nice overall. The fruity sweetness from the peach was really a treat (I really like peaches). Definitely a must try.","Treebs","May 27, 2012"

5,12.1,5,5,5,5,5,"O: Grading as a saison, it's very good. I enjoy it a little more than the base beer, but not for twice the cash. Not that price is a problem with this beer. If you saw it on the shelf and didn't buy a bottle, you already missed your chance. Recommended if the opportunity presents itself.","hopsbreath","0"
