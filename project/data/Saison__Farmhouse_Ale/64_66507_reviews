"O: A light refreshing saison that straddles the line between wine and beer."
"O: Overall, very drinkable, but not something I'd rack back to the store to buy. Good, not great."
""
"Though it looked great and smelled fine it tasted awful. To me it was like a bad white wine. My wife loved it but this one was really  not for me."
""
"O-refreshing crisp beer that has a balance of tartness from the grapes and funk from the yeast.......both sweet and sour at times.......probably the perfect sunday brunch beer"

"Served in a goblet at Ashley's Westland. Two fingers of bubbly head sat atop a pale gold/yellow brew, filled with carbonation. Head dissipates quickly. Smell  is sweet, floral. Taste is much the same, sweet grape, with a dry, sort of metallic undercurrent. Pleasant and refreshing. Mouthfeel is much like champagne. Happy I had it, would try again."
""
"Viognier is my favorite white wine so I had to try this beer.   The Viognier presents in both the  aroma and taste.  Like the wine, Noble Rot has a dry finish and is not overly sweet.    The Saison fermentation comes through in the finish quite nicely.  Whatever hopping was done does not interfere with but only complements the Viognier or Saison aspects, which is exactly what the drinker should expect."
""
""
"This is one of the most unique ales I've tried and it was a nice deviation from the traditional saison. I'm not much of a wine drinker, but my wife is. Conversely, she isn't much of a beer drinker. Somehow we both came out enjoying this quite a bit."
""
"This beer was just too sweet for my taste.  I'm also not a fan of grape flavors, so I'm biased in my review."
""
"O - This is a very interesting beer, although not extremely complex.  Like most DFH brews it is efinitely worth a try, not many products our there to compare it with."
""
""
""
""
""

"A great saison for people like me that are 'saison'd out.'  Its unique flavors to keep me interested enough to buy it again."

"From tap at the brewery. A very interesting blend of ale and sparkling wine. Nose is overwhelmingly wine based but predominantly ale in mouthfeel and flavor. I was very pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear golden color with a thick foamy head.  Higher than normal carbonation.  Head retention is not great.  Lacing is moderate.  Has a sour fruit aroma that is almost sweet towards the end.  Typical  Belgium yeast funky aroma.  You can taste a little coriander and Belgium yeast.  More sour fruit, ending in a sweeter grape taste.  Almost tastes like a sweeter wine at the end with a little more of a hoppy aftertaste.  Good beer, but not the best saison I have had.  It is definitely different."

"Looks like a white wine; especially Chardonnay. A small head dissipates into a hint of lace is the only visual element that allows you to identify it as beer. Fruity, lemon like and honey like aroma. Delicious! Taste is fruity, like grapes. There is a slightly dry white wine like finish. Had it with fish. If you love white wine, this is the beer for you! Feel is low carbonation, light to medium bodied and refreshing. I love this one as I love all to most of Dogfish Head's products!"

"Weighting: Appearance 15%, Smell 15%, Taste 35%, Mouthfeel 15%, Overall 20%"
"O: Tasty with good complexity, goes down easily, not too filling, well-disguised strong kick, good representation of style, this is a decent beer to drink for a long time if you’re in the mood for the style."

"I would like to try one with a big head and lacing, like so many reviews mentioned, but the bottle I had wasn't bad either."

"O - Not a standard saison or farmhouse by any stretch, but a delicious and clean rendition that makes for a real surprise.  I picked this one up on clearance, and now I wish I'd grabbed a couple more."
""
""
"tastes like a west african"
""
"Not great. But you can understand the unique quality of this beer. You get the white wine feel, and the Belgian flare. You also have a slight sour aspect in this. I really was left wanting something more.But good overall."

"If you're a saison/farmhouse lover, Noble Rot is a must have. A pleasing, refreshing sour grape taste from the must. The wheat and yeast are bright on the tongue. Has a remarkable finish that makes my mouth water. One of the few beers I always buy when I see it at the store. Perhaps my favorite domestic saison-like beer (and I like just about all of them)."

"These ingredients lend this beer the tart, fruity sweetness of a white wine with the bready, grainy flavors of a malty beer. Very unique drinking experience, and the drinkability of this brew makes it easy for anyone to enjoy!"

"Pours a clear, straw color. 2/3 inch head of a white color. Good retention and slight lacing. Smells of grapes, pale malt, hint of hop, slight yeast, and a hint of sweet malt. Fits the style of a Saison / Farmhouse Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. There is also a slight dryness. Tastes of slight hops, grapes, pale malt, yeast, alcohol, hint of sweet malt, and tartness. Overall, strong grape characteristics in both aroma and body. Body has a good blend and is better then the aroma."
""

"Beautiful late spring day and this quaff just sparkles like gold in the sun. Love the white wines and this beer satisfies my taste buds. Great twist on a saison."

"Taste: Pretty sweet almost like white grape juice. It finishes clean and more like a light lager style beer. I really like the amount of carbonation and the refreshing feel is has and for having a high alcohol content, there is no evidence of that."

"This pours a clear, light yellow color with a slight, white head. The aroma is slightly tart and full of grapes. The taste is strong in flavor and drinks very much like a carbonated wine. This is a very unique take on the fruit beer category. Makes for great sipping beer that pairs well with lots wine based foods."

"Rich golden hued ale with just a trace of head that covers half of the top of this beer. Excellent clarity and vibrant carbonation bubbles. There's not much aroma here but I get the faint grape must that could almost be mistaken for a lager yeast smell. The taste delivers the strong,dry white grape flavor. The mouth is is moderately carbonated and dry."

"Overall I thought this beer was pretty nice and I thought it was a nice example of a fruited Saison, the Saison base was nice and it was recognizable as a Saison and the grape must wasn't too over powering and it worked well with the Saison yeast, plus the alcohol was hidden very well, there's no way I would guess this is 9%. This beer had pretty good drinkability, it was smooth, clean, crisp, a little refreshing, not filling and the taste did a good job at holding my attention, I don't think I would have a problem drinking a whole bottle by myself and I think this was be a great beer to enjoy in the summer time. What I like the most about this beer was the way that the grape must worked with the Saison base, It worked together much better than I originally expected, I also liked the way that the alcohol was hidden and the mouthfeel were also very noteworthy. What I liked the least about this beer was the appearance, it wasn't bad, but I wish the head and lacing were a little more Saison like. I would buy this beer again, but not often since it's a little pricey, I think $10 would be a good price for this beer. I would recommend this beer to anyone who likes fruity Saisons, it falls nicely into that category. All in all I enjoyed this beer and I'm glad that I bought a bottle to review. I'm not a big wine fan so I didn't think this beer would appeal to me much, but after I had that sample a little while ago I released that I was overlooking it for no good reason. Nice job guys, this was a nice and unique Saison, keep up the creative work."

"O: This is not a typical DFH. It may be 'off-centered' and unique, but it is not funky like many of their offerings. The white grape must is about perfectly balanced to the underlying beer. Easily one of the easiest drinking beers I've tasted, yet incredibly complex and full of flavor. This is the first time I've tasted this offering from DFH, and it is easily my favorite."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This was the first time I have had this beer and I thought it was good. Definitely similar to a saison or fruity Belgian ale. This beer is scary because you don't get overwhelming alcohol, just pungent fruitiness. Will buy again."
""
""
""
"Overall: A very good twist on a Belgian Saison/Farmhouse ale. Good Belgian yeast notes with a great kick of tart and funky grapes."
""
""
""
"O: This is like a mild funky champagne. I really like it, but there a much better saisons that have more of everything just kinda ""turned up"" a hair bit. Sam and company surprised me with this one. Was not expecting subtlety I encountered with this brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel was medium with a fine carbonation. Not really one that I would seek again."
""
""
""
""
"Pours super pale yellow with a one finger head that disappears immediately with faint lacing. Aroma is strong white grape juice, malt and slight citrus. Taste supports nicely; grape juice, white wine, malts, citrus finishes with some light yeast. Medium body with a long lingering aftertaste. Very very impressive."
""
""
""
"Much better than anticipated. Much less sweet than my expectations for a Digfishhead beer. The grape must adds a lot and it reminds me of some of the best ""wine-like"" beers. Dry and refreshing. I'd definitely drink it again. NOw I'm just adding words..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I would prefer if the mouthfeel were actually subdued somewhat, but aging this beer does not have a noticeable effect on the carbonation.  At the same time, unwanted bitterness is added to the beer over time as the other pleasant qualities of the beer fade."
"Overall: Subtlety isn't usually Dogfish Head's specialty, but this beer is the exception. The addition of the grape must works perfectly with the base beer without one overwhelming the other. Complex, flavorful and very easy to drink. This is one of my favorite offerings from Dogfish, and I really hope Sam and the crew continue making this in the future."
""
""
""
"Overall it was still very enjoyable, but it didn't meet the expectations I had and the grape got a bit too much by the end. I'd drink it again if I was offered, but I wouldn't seek it out."

"Overall: I love Dogfish head, not necessarily because they make ""amazing"" beer. Because a lot of their beer isn't that great. But they constantly make new beers that have taste that are so different from other beers. I can't help but try them whenever I see a new one, I don't regularly buy the same beer from them twice, but I'm always glad I gave their beers a try; just to see how else a beer can taste."
""
""
""
""
"I love the creativity of DogFish head beers. This is another one that is very worthy and should be tried."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: There is quite a lot of flavors and aromas of white wine in this beer - similar to a sauvignon blanc or a pinot grigio. This is a good beer to share with someone that is more of a wine drinker than a beer drinker and is a nice change of pace (not being all that similar to most of the other beers on the market). I would have this one again."
""
""
"Overall: An interesting experiment indeed, and one of the better Dogfish 750mL offerings I've had in awhile. Also, way too easy to drink. If this was in 4 packs of 12oz bottles it could be a dangerous summer refresher."

"Tasting now and The grapes up front! And a nice odd leathery taste, and oily feel here, yet bubbly and refreshing but with a tart lemony burn. Like a white wine married to a saison, which makes sense given the bottle description. Overall, a DFH success and certainly the best (albeit only!) grape-centered ale ive ever tasted."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it's pretty decent, and the 9% is masterfully hidden at least. It promised a bit more than it delivered though, and it ended up being less exciting than I thought it might be. Lower your expectations, and you'll probably have a great time with it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: If you are into the light, crisp saisons, this beer is a definite must try. Personally, I walked into this blind and was taken by surprise, but I appreciate the beer for what it is and what it is trying to do and I would give it a solid 4/5. Cheers"
"O: I found this to be a very interesting beer that's also quite drinkable—it's like sipping a ""light"" version of a pinot grigio white wine that isn't as full-bodied or dry and also hides its alcohol a lot better. I would definitely consider getting this again, especially if I was sharing it with a friend that really liked wine and was open to trying something different for a change."
"Tastes brisk and light-bodied, with a definite grape and champagne vibe. Goes down easily with a light effervescence. Finishes with a solid fruit and spice tone. I get a distinctive wine-like vibe here, and this is a superior hybrid beer that I'd easily enjoy again. Very good and a unique experience."
""
"This is an interesting beer. As far as a beer/wine blend or crossover it shows off both nicely. The saison characteristics come through up front with a typical, dry, white wine finish. Because of the lightness of the saison and the intensity of the grapes, this comes across as more wine than beer. Nonetheless, I enjoyed. This is worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it makes me think more of wine--or more accurately--sparkling wine, than it does of beer. Like a heavy champagne. I'm not sure if I would have this again, but I might give it to a wine drinker to help open their mind to the wonders of beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not bad, but I can only take the grape juice flavour for so long. Would be nice if that was toned down and the yeast ramped up."
"Looking forwards to this and pours just like a Chardonnay the lightest straw yellow hue with a wispy one finger head and sporadic lacing here and there,the smell is feint barnhouse funk with white grapes and sherbet,the mouthfeel is light bodied with nice carbonation and the taste is like hybrid of an ale a cider with a wine and has tastes of apple,white grapes,a touch of light bready malts,a slight mustiness and finished bone dry and fruity just like a fine wine and although this ain't for everyone I love it and pushes the boundaries between beer and wine and also shows the similarities in these two arts one for the wine lovers cheers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An odd beer for sure. Like a white wine and beer mixer. It has snappiness upfront but develops into a dull chardonnay like finish. I can't believe that this is 9%ABV! It doesn't show at all. It was unique but I didn't love it as much as I thought I would."

"Overall: When I originally grabbed this I knew nothing about it, let it sit in and once I cracked open the bottle I knew right away to pour this into a tulip. I originally thought it was a ""fruit"" beer looking at what I red on the label but after taking a sniff I was already going to indulge into awesomeness. Built for those in love with Belgian ales...all you need is a glass, Salud!"
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear light yellow with a foamy white head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, spice, and slight grape aromas. Taste is much the same with sour fruit and spice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is easy to drink but nothing all that special."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- The nice farmhouse flavors turns a bit more tart and astringent as it opens but it still has nice flavor and a unique character."

"2012 bottle. Pours a clear, bright, golden-yellow color with a large white head that goes down quickly. Funny, looks like Coors Light or some other light adjunct lager. Not gonna let this bring down the points though, because it's a lot prettier when you know the beer is going to be good. Scent is pilsner-like...somewhat disappointing. Will I be taking back my statement I just made one sentence ago? I pick up a bit of grape skin and some green grapes with some grain and Belgian yeast. Nothing too intriguing though. No longer excited to taste this beer. Taste is quite a bit better. Lovely grape skin flavor with a good amount of wheat and grain flavors. Belgian yeast, and a slightly tart finish. Not nearly as tart as I was hoping for or expecting. There is a bit of alcohol warmth. Mouthfeel is light bodied and very dry, almost champagne-like. Drinkability is scary-high. Overall, the drinkability on this beer is ridiculous. For being 9% ABV, it drinks like a light pilsner or adjunct lager. I'm not saying it tastes exactly like those styles, but it definitely drinks like them, except much more dry. Overall, I was expecting much more from this beer. Maybe it was City Beer's decision to put this beer as on-site consumption only when it first came out that made me get my expectations so high. Wouldn't call this beer a saison...more like an imperial pilsner with fruit. Very solid, enjoyable beer....just not as sour or ""offset"" as I was expecting from DFH."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Great Saison fusion, a little hot but it is 9% and it makes up for the heat with good drinkability."
""
""
""
""
"O - So unique, good saison, very drinkable."
""
""
"Pours a two finger white head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Almost clear very pale yellow/amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Grape nose and flavor is tart grape. Dry finish. Called a saison but really closer to a wine flavor. Not cheap at $14.99 for a 750ml bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, MA."
""
""
""
""
"Served from tap to glass. At first glance it has a light pale yellow color. Looks like a Belgium style and tastes like one too. Has a nice white head to it at first but dissipates rather quickly. Has a Belgium mouthfeel with slight apple and tart finish. You can taste the wheat too. Great beer."
"O/D-One of the only DFH's wacky beers I have like. Actually I think its the only large format DFH beer I haven't been pissed about after buying it. Its cool, especially if you know about its unique origins."

"Looks crisp, pours pale yellow. Could almost be mistaken for a Bud. Taste sweet with an overall boozy feel, almost like a port. It's very nice. Mouthfeel is good; it's foamy and creamy, and really warms everything up. Smell sweet and slightly boozy. Overall, this is one of my favorite offerings from one of the best breweries on the planet."
""
"O: Feels too artificial for me, probably from excessive use of herbs. Also, I don't know if I'm crazy or everyone else is, but where do you detect wine flavor? I would classify this as a saison/wit, and a bad one at that. Damn you Dogfish head! Stop making ""exotic"" crappy beers and focus on quality products already."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into tulip. Clear yellow with fizzy bubbles, looks like champagne. Fizzy but thick head that doesn't stick around, visible carbonation. Smells like champagne or white wine combined with belgian yeast. Taste is like a champagne, but with the belgian yeast sneaking in at the end to finish. If it weren't for that, you could tell me this was a sparkling white wine and I'd believe you. Incredibly drinkable, alcohol very hidden for 9% (which admittedly would be less than wine, however). This would be an excellent dinner or celebration beer, or a great starter for wine/champagne lovers who want to get into beer but can't."
""
""
""
"Certainly poured more like wine than beer as very light, clearish yellow color and intense carbonation, almost champagne like. Smell is very vinous and ""grapey", a touch of funk along with sourness and spice. Light bodied, easy to drink, crisp and dry finish, there's a touch of woodiness in this but mostly I am getting that grape, wine-like taste along with some tartness to match with it. There seems to be a touch of other light fruit like the possibility of sour apple and/or pear flavor, but in general one could say that this beer has a wine-like profile with a touch of saison funk and sourness. Didn't really pick up any malts or yeast prevelant in regular saisons but this beer did seem a little fuller and sweeter than your average white wine so there in there. A hard beer to describe, perhaps a new category, but for now ""sorta saison"" works. I will say this beer is at least worth a try by anyone and a unique (although in my opinion not overly great) brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Definitely a unique beer in DFH's lineup, and as good as any great noble rot wine or refreshing saison at the end of the day. It's pretty sweet, but it makes an excellent aperitif and good budget replacement for the actual wines themselves, which can be pretty pricey. It also has a beer-like feel that is more appealing to me, and not as syrupy as a result. Absolutely worth a try for the curious."
""
""
"Drinkin this with Amanda while watching Tai Chi Zero. Pours up and looks just like champagne. Light murky golden color with solid white head. Decent lacing. Aroma of white grape must, a hint of pale malts in the backdrop. Taste is Saison, green sour apples, white grape, musty, a lil hot, some lemon. Medium body. Smoothe easy carbo. I dig it"
""
""
"D: This was a very nice unique saison, with noticeable white grape must. It had an enjoyable scent and taste and body, and a very smooth finish, so it was easy to drink. Good brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not bad. It seems a little insipid at times but could be much worse."
""
""
""
""
""
"Excellent beer! Poured at a good temperature with fizzy, small, off-white head that quickly settled and a bit of lace. Color is a clear, light yellow with plenty of racing bubble trails. Aroma is yeast, grapes, and beer. Flavor is absolutely outstanding! This is the best grape beer I've ever had!! The grapes add a bit of sweetness but that is perfectly balanced by the fresh tart style of the beer and robust carbonation along with the yeast bitterness and of course, hop. Body is bang on perfect; ditto carbonation. Finish is like flavor, quite long, and extremely drinkable. Wish I had more."
""
""
""
""
"The taste brings out the grapes that they talk about with a zingy bitterness at the end. A likable enough beer but not one that I would go for regularly."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is pretty good, but could use a little more oomph."
"This has a tart, winey palate, and the carbonation of a Saison. Good sipping beer that I will buy again and share with friends and loved ones."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a great beer! The one thing I feel is missing is the smell. All that you really get is the white grape must and even that is somewhat light. However the lack of smell is compensated by the interesting character the must and botrytis infection adds to the flavor. Overall an incredibly unique wine-like character to this beer. I'd highly recommend this one to wine lovers. I've got one aging in my basement for future drinking!"
""

"O - I've had a number of saisons and this beer is very similar but very different. A saision with white wine like qualities. It is no where near the top of my saison list. Drink like a wine (slow, sips) and maybe you will enjoy it."
""
"The result is stunning. The look is classic straw-colored pale pilsner (or should I say sauvignon blanc?) with very little head. Smell is certainly fermented grape and light hops. Taste... Well, it gets weird here. A mixture of pilsner and white wine does not sound appealing, but this one is absolutely superb. Bone dry, delicate, floral, fruity, ever so slightly spicy. Amazing!"
"A nice surprise. I didn't bother to read the label or the ba listing but at first taste I immediately thought, wow, that's a weird pils! I generally don't enjoy saisons, so this was an experience for me. Much hyped, I first heard of Noble Rot while I was working with Napa Smith Brewery. I like that this beer is light, bold, fruity, crisp, funky, and boozy! A whole lot packaged into one beer. I think the grape additions give a nice companion for the pilsner flavor. Light and slightly tart, this is an excellent beer to break up a summer afternoon marathon. Would love to pair this with some funky or sharp white cheeses. It grows on you!"

"O: Clean, unique, drinkable while possessing multiple dimensions, making it not a straightforward golden ale. Not a must try but an expected solid offering from DFH."

"O: imagine a saisson mixed with a sour, interesing and unique"

"Overall: This drinks more like a sparkling wine or hard cider. I think it's a great hybrid between beer and wine. It's a crisp, clean and easy to drink. It has a nice tartness and is a great option for white wine drinkers. That being said, I'm glad I tried but don't think it will be a repeat purchase, especially for $14. 4"

"This is a lot like drinking vino verde or prosecco until the malty earthiness reminds you it's a beer. The intentionally infected grapes add this sweetness that really pushes the limits but stays within reason. I wouldn't drink this all the time but it is a nice departure from the norm. It tastes a little like Delirium Tremens."

"Pale blonde colour, 1.5 fingers of white head, lace all the way down the glass, good retention as well. Smell is of spicy yeast, certainly saison like, fruity, citrus in the way of lemony, grape is initially minimal in the nose but becomes more aparent about halfway through, some sweet apple also there. Taste is full of grape and wine upfront followed by peppery/spicy yeast, fairly fruity, lemon, both sweet and tart points present here, some sweet wine/grape in the finish. Medium carbonation, medium body, lush soft creamy feel. This was rather enjoyable, quite drinkable with lots of solid flavours and depth."
""
""
""
"O: I was quite excited when I read about the plans for this beer, and in wine-like servings, this is a wonderful achievement for DFH. I would recommend splitting a bomber among three people."
"O: I don't think the carbonation was obnoxious but I wish I could try it without so much...maybe it would be improved and taste more like beer to me. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it, but I want more out of this beer. Would like to have this for New Years!"
"Noble Rots pours out a very pale golden color with plenty of carbonation. The aroma is sweet and spicy, with a little bit of a strange twang that's probably the infected grapes. The taste is an equal mix of sweet and tart grape and spicy saison flavors. The mouthfeel is light and briskly carbonated, and the drinkability is good. Overall, Noble Rot is a success. It toes the line between beer and wine, successfully presenting characteristics of both. It's not something I'll drink something, but I enjoyed the bottle."
"Overall, an interesting hybrid beer that honestly tastes perhaps as much like a wine as it does a beer. I'm not usually a big fan of wine but this brew provides enough sweet and tart flavors mixed with the drying characteristics of a white wine to please my palate, although I couldn't drink this every time I was craving a beer."
""
"O: This beer reminds me of a really shitty demi-sec champagne. And while its commendable that this isn't a shitty champagne, I'm not sure that a beer that tastes like a shitty champagne is any better than a shitty champagne in the first place. So, like many of Dogfish Head's beers, this one just goes to prove that saying that just because you can do something, doesn't mean that you should."
"Serving type- 750ml bottle poured into a wine glass. Thanks for reading."
""
"This is an easy drinking beer that does taste and feel somewhat like drinking white wine at the same time. An interesting beer to be sure and one to try. It won't be for everyone."
"O: I was hoping the botrytis would come more to the forefront, since I love Sauternes and other botrytis infected wines like Auslese Riesling and higher QmP when I can find them and afford them. I could taste the grapes and the Viognier character. This is a varietal I am quite familiar with and this beer conveys true essence of that grape. At the end, certainly a good flavour, I want some more rot, but in the end I do like the beer just looking at it straightforwardly."

"Poured from a 750 ml bottle into a goblet, the bottled date is rubbed off. This pours a crystal clear light golden yellow color with a small short lived completely white head. The smell is of fermented grapes, white wine, some almsot belgian type of yeast esters, The feel is medium and fizzy like sparkling wine. The taste is good, plenty of grape tastes, a little like a white wine, no hops are present."
"Overall (4.25): All in all, this has been a really enjoyable experience. Noble Rot walks the beer-wine line shockingly well—it really does appear to be as much beer as it does wine, without detracting from either set of qualities at all. This was a really excellent experiment in beer, and I’m very happy to have tried this. Definitely recommended for anyone who appreciates saisons or dry, white wine."

"O-The wine character is very noticeable and makes for a unique brew. Flavor is not as complex as some, but the beer has a pleasing, drinkable tartness and feel. I'm not sure that I'm completely sold on the wine juice/must concept, but I have certainly tasted worse beers."
""
"Bright, transparent golden with champagne bubbly white head. Aroma of lemon skin, white grapes similar to fruit juice, vague vanilla, and floral notes. Tastes of spiked apple juice, grapes, sour notes, floral notes, slight funk, wine-like towards the finish. Light and bubbly. A champagne beer. The 9% is there but easy to handle. Sweet but reserved."

"This Saison (of sorts) was brewed with botrytis (noble rot) infected juice from Viognier grapes and Pinot Gris must, which was intensified by “dropping fruit” (cropping the grapes). It’s then balanced with Pilsner and wheat malts, and finished with a Belgian yeast strain. Although its wine-like flavors dominate, Noble Rot tastes just as interesting as it sounds; demanding a “must” try for adventurous palates."
""
"Overall, what we liked best about this beer was the juiciness of the flavoring via the grape, while keeping so much musky dryness, and qualities of champagne. This beer truly is the champagne of beers. The look, the nose, the flavoring, and the feel all overlap significantly with that beverage, all while keeping a distinct funky sourness to it, and enough seriousness to keep the flavoring appropriate, and the beer drinking smoothly. This is an impressive beer, and we might have to employ it every year now to ring in the New Year."

"O: Interesting take, sour grapes? not at all, a different take per style, but probably best split on the bomber. The alcohol doesnt seem to interfere and is well behaved for its abv."
""
""
"O- Outstanding experiment, I don't think I would want a lot of this one though, one serving was more than enough for me. The 9.0% ABV was well hidden and it went down pretty easy, except for the overly dry finish this could have been epic. Don't get me wrong this is a beer to seek out and try and it does blur the lines of what a beer can be. Nice job, Dogfish Head!"
""
""

"I'll hand it to Dogfish Head they try new things and take chances, this is far from a bad brew but perhaps I'm just not in the mood for a cidery, vinous style beer, props for hiding 9% though this one has some well concealed liquor"

"I poured this from a 22oz bottle, it has a nice clear yellowish color body with a nice small white head that hangs around for a while.

The mouth feel is very nice and smooth, and overall, a outstanding beer from DFH."

"D - This beer truly walks a fine line between beer and wine unlike any I have tried to date in 1,000+ reviews...

An interesting offering all the way around... Kudos..."

"O: quite an interesting beer and an interesting concept. it tastes like you would expect as a mix of a beer and a wine. it's a bit off for a saison but it tastes good for what it is. the complexity is nice and it's about what you would expect. I was really excited to get this beer in a trade and it did not disappoint."
""
""
""
"Off the charts excellent but not your typical beer. As indicated it is borderline wine - a great bubbly Chardonnay like white. Nose is white grape, sour and some citrus. On the tongue beer is not the first thing present - you almost have to search for the beer. For fans of wine and beer with an open mind this is a great surprise. Texture up front is excellent fading only slightly through the back with a lingering white grape and lemon flavor. Could be considered in the sour class but i think its actually in a class by itself. Excellent pairing with sushi. Thank you DFH for going outside of the box."

"Overall these Dogfish Head experiments are usually hit or miss for me; this one is a little different as I enjoyed it but would be unlikely to seek it out again. A nice blend of the White Wine Grape flavor with a Saison but the ABV/malt heft makes this a tad bit of a chore to finish the whole bottle."
""
""
""

"Overall, this was a worthwhile experiment IMHO, even though the beer qualities tend to get drowned out somewhat by the wine aspects."

"The beer pours and elegant looking, clear, golden yellow with a fluffy white head that laces. The nose is both tart and sweet with big notes of yeast followed by an alcoholic bite. The taste is a clean saison base with a very big presence from the grapes/rot. It has an outstanding, tart, green apple mouthfeel that helps balance the perfectly sweetened saison base. It finishes semi-dry and has ample carbonation, tricking me into thinking that I'm drinking a champagne. However, the saison is still a big part of this beer and contributes to DFH's overall success with this beer. Definitely worth trying, I may go stock up in case they don't re-release."
"Medium bodied with a good amount of earthy, musty funk that is overtaken by a strong, sweet vinous presence.  Hints of grassy hops and funky yeast followed by prominent vinous grapes as well as some apple, pear and sweet booze.  Not much heat though with a well masked abv.   Just a bit too sweet for my liking and could use some more funk for balance.  Decent but a bit one dimensional."
""
""
""
"O: I'm glad I tried it, but it wasn't great. Nice take on the saison-style, but I doubt I would grab it again."
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a slightly hazy beige color ale with a rather large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of rustic malt with light spicy yeast ester and some light dry grape notes light dry hoppy notes also distinguishable. Taste is a complex mix of rustic malt with dry hoppy notes with light dry grapes notes that are more subtle then I had expected. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Very well brewed and hard to describe but very complex and still easily drinkable. I was almost expecting a mess of flavour based on the description but Dogfish were really able to create a very unique and interesting beer."
""
""
"This was more wine-like that it was beer for me. Certainly showed off the botryitis but also showed the use of the viognier grapes as well. It was a very enjoyable drink though and one I'd like to try again."
""
""
""
""
"O: A white wine lovers dream. Not bad if you like saisons. I’m glad I took a chance and tried this. I wouldn’t buy it again, but it’s not the worst of DFH usual disappointing series of experimental beers."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled in 2012B. Pours almost crystal clear golden straw color with a nice 1-2 finger white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice small cap that lasts. Some very nice soapy lacing clings to the glass, with a good amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of big grape, pear, lemon, grass, herbal, bread, floral, earth, clove, and light funkiness. Very nice and well balanced aromas with good complexity. Taste of big lemon, grape, pear, apple, herbal, floral, earth, bready grain, grass, funk, and light spiciness. Light tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of grape, lemon, tart apple, earth, herbal, bread, and light spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and balance of flavors; with a nice funky tartness in the background that compliments the flavor profile perfectly. Zero cloying sweetness. Medium carbonation and body; with a slightly slick and quite crisp mouthfeel that is very nice. No cloying sweetness at all. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely outstanding experimental saison from Dogfish Head! Incredible balance of flavors with great complexity; and extremely smooth to drink. Really loved this one."
"O - I like it. Won't work to hard to search it out in the future but, it's good. Flavors are very subtle when cold so, I would suggest you let it warm a bit. It is very refreshing and if it wasn't for the 9 % ABV, it could be easily session-able. It says ""sorta-saison"" as a description on the bottle but, I would put this more in the market of a ""sorta overly fruity and warmish fermented lager with wine must added"" category, although that may not necessarily fit on the label. Noble Rot is definitely worth tasting at least once."

"O: I am very pleased with this beer. The flavor is complex. The original blast of fruit almost makes it too sweet, but the pleasant, tart bread finish balanced the beer nicely. The alcohol is present (there is a nice warmth in the throat), but it is not overpowering. This is a must try."
""

"Cheers!"
"D - Very drinkable. Really nice flavor added by the white grape, and the base saison is really nice. Good balance."

"If this were 2 percent lighter, this would be even easier to take more gulps from quicker. Body is a sturdy medium with spritzy carb and a tart finish. Alive with flavor, Noble Rot is a nice step away from the overly extreme beers that make DFH a hit or miss brewery with me. This one is a hit, I just wish it came back in 4 packs."

"A great attempt at fusing beer and wine, and also one of the best offerings, if not THE best, I've had from Dogfish Head."
"Pours a light golden color with a one inch foam head that lingers for a while. Very filtered and lots of light coming through. An unexpected and impressive appearance for a stronger ale. Smell is mainly of belgian yeast and some light citrus/ fruity notes. Almost a wine-like scent to it which must be the grapes used in the brewing. Taste is very interesting. Very very sweet notes from the grapes. Again almost wine like flavors. Not very bitter at all. Interesting and delicious. The high alcohol content is somewhat obvious. The high carbonation makes the mouthfeel very pleasant. However the sweetness and the high alcohol content don't make it an incredibly drinkable beer. Overall, a very interesting beer. Definitely worth a try at least once."
"O - A beer that is close to white wine, cool I guess."
""
""
""
"Overall a very unique brew, a mix of wine and beer that was done so superbly that it gives it an almost champagne like quality with the body and flavor of an excellent Farmhouse Ale. Be warned this is one to be careful of; it has a 9% ABV that is virtually unnoticeable in the taste…"
""
""
"Overall: A very interesting attempt at a wine/beer hybrid, and I'd say a successful one! It's a bit harsh at first, but I do really feel like drinking a champagne of beers! Dry white wine comes to mind as well."
"Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a pale golden orange, just about the color of sparkling apple juice. One finger fine white head dissipates slowly to a film and ring with good lacing. Aroma domintated by grape, leaning towards concord grape, faint malt, herbal hay. Very unusual flavor, vinous middle with a bit of sourness in the finish. Apple, grape and slight neutral malt. Dry with a hint of hops in the finish. Light to medium bodied. Some of the flavors are reminiscent of cider, but this leans more toward grape flavor and has a slight malt element not found in cider. I do not favor sour saisons, but this one I found enjoyable and quite different than anything I've had in the past. Another of Dogfish Head's experiments that worked out in an unusual, but satisfying way."

"Bleached white head, very airy and delicate, starts out over three fingers when you pour put resolves down quickly with lots of dimpling across the surface, not a large amount of lacing but what’s there is very sticky and longlasting. The liquid is a pale yellow to orange hue, shiny and fully transparent with a few bubble beads which sustain themselves well. The nose is sour and freshly penetrating, the wine component comes through clearly, boosting the florality as well as peach, apple, apricot, pear fruit, light banana, the citrus is a mix of lemon and white grapefruit, there’s a solid amount of ginger, coriander like spices, more leesy than yeasty, displays good lift given its relative heaviness in your nostrils. Medium-bodied, even sourer here with the addition of a strong grassiness alongside the elevating mixed citrus and unprocessed wheat and grains. You can make a better argument for yeastiness in the mouth, softens things a touch and supports the length of the apricot, peach, pineapple, green apple fruit. The baking spices take a step or two back from center stage. As it warms more of the pils qualities come out. The carbonation level is about where it should be, perhaps a little light. The funkiness is not dominant and, accounting for the overall sourness, the total experience is pretty clean. Good retronasal action after you swallow, extends presence."
"M: Light-bodied; tartness at the front of the tongue, then carbonation cuts and lends to a great drying effect at the end. Overall I appreciate what Dogfish Head is doing with this brew. Great saison-ish/pilsner/sour, whatever it is...it's good."

"Tart. Crisp. Medium bodied. Slight sour funky finish. Really does remind me of white wine in so many ways. Pretty good and interesting offering from DFH Ales."
"This is the clearest yellow that you'll ever see on a beer. It all starts off crazy biting with this acidic thing going on, but either it calms down or my taste buds get used to it. I probably get used to it as there is still a kind of bite to it. I dig it, but it may be too much for some. Nice sugar and sweet tones with lots of fruity aspects. It's a pretty unique beer that leans very much towards the Belgian style of things, though remains unique. I'd be interested to see what this is like in a few years with some age."

"O: The best American Saison I have tried. Very drinkable, and very much in the style of Fantome Saison."
"O: An odd conglomeration of a saison, a French Biere de Garde, and essentially. Midas Touch. The grape must is there, the 9% ABV nondescript ""spiced beer"" feeling is there. What sets Noble Rot apart is its eye-catching clarity and sour characteristics. I just hope it doesn't cause too much gut rot, either."
"This beer pours a very light bodied and very clear, bright gold in color with a white one finger head. It's very pilsner esque and not cloudy whatsoever. The nose is interesting to say the least. It's slightly tart, has a yeast that is very Belgian, and has both lemon and honey to it. It's an odd profile but interesting. The flavors are light and tart. There are semi sweet pale malts, a touch of honey, and then the beer takes an odd and grapy turn to tartness. It's very unique. It has high carbonation and drinks very, very light in body. This is a beer worth trying. There really isn't anything like it. It's just so unique."
""
"Golden yellow appearance, with a big frothy head on top. Aroma is pleasantly sour - I'm detecting cider vinegar, and a sharp, fruity tartness. The flavor had a wine like character to it, both in mouthfeel and taste - the white wine grapes are definitely noticeable. Slight grassiness/horse blanket funk. Medium bodied, fizzy, and slightly tingling on the way down. Complex and pleasant - an interesting experiment for the beer and wine drinking crowds. Would buy again."
""
""
"Very interesting beer. I'm no sour fan, but the tart qualities were fine in my book. Would drink again!"
"An interesting beer/wine hybrid. There isn't one particular aspect that I love, but it's a decent creation."
"Bought a 750-mL bottle down at the brewpub back in early May. Bottled on date reads 12/9/2013. Pours perfectly clear gold with fluffy white head with some lacing. Light carbonation present. Smells like a saison with Chardonnay. Some real interesting fruity characteristics in the nose like strawberries. No real hop aroma but maybe some light spicy noble hops. Tastes initially sweet with perfect beer-wine hybrid complexities. Dries out with a wine like aftertaste- like a dry white wine. Such an interesting beer. At times, I get waves of beer then wine then beer then wine, etc. demonstrates great complexities yet subtle all the same. Awesome job and definitely an innovative beer. Cheers to Dogfish for pushing the craft beer boundaries with this one!"
"Served in a DFH goblet at the Brick Store. Pours a beautiful straw gold hue with a fluffy, two inch, bright white head. Clarity is translucent and the nucleation point at the bottom of the glass produces a cascade of tiny bubbles that effervesce to the undersides of the cap. Thick curtains of textured lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose expresses candi sugar and light, fruity esters - I don't get a lot of complexity here, but I think that is partially due to the coldness at which the beer was served. Taste expresses white grapes, a grassy character, some spiciness and a trace of candi sugar. There is also just a hint of wine vinegar. The effect I get here is somewhat akin to a white wine spritzer with some saison-esque qualities. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body (but closer to light), with a bright, lively carbonation and a slight acidity. Overall, I have to say that this is one of the large format DFH offerings that I really enjoyed. It is interesting and complex but definitely closer to a sparkling wine than a saison; quite a nice hybrid however. One recommendation - if you are opening a bottle, I suggest having one or two friends on standby to help. The flavors are a bit intense."

"Pale yellow golden hue with a bright white head flowing thick...slightly clouded with a brilliant white head flowing thick. Aroma tart grapes with a fruity heirloom note, wild funky notes, bittering hops are minimal but explosive. Flavor has great white wine notes, including sugary notes of tart grape funk and wild hop notes especially deceiving considering the type of beer. I like how they call it a sorta-saison kind of a catch all terminology. Body isn't cloying at all, medium bodied with a dry finish. Mellow carbonation for sure, drinks much like a white wine. Overall as creative as beer ever gets using mainly infected grape juice to make a saison that doesn't suck. I just think it's more mead or wine like than anything related to a beer."
"Overall this is, as usual, a really unique beer from Dogfish Head. I like it. Would go great w/ poultry or fish."
"Overall. Nice and refreshing. The grapes add lots of wine characteristics. Mixed okay with the belgian flavours."
""
"O- More white wine than Saison. Bits of wheat and sour apple shine thru. Little hints of peppery spice and a nice banana/clove/compost yeastiness. I'll certainly try to grab a few more of these. Not your typical saison, but what with DFH is ever typical?"
"O - Really an interesting beer. If you like saisons and you like white wine, this could be your favorite beer of all time. Really enjoyable and nothing like I've ever had before...would buy again. Good stuff."
""
""
"O: While Noble Rot is good from the bottle, I remember an even better showing when I sampled this beer from the tap in early 2011, when it was drier, crisper and had more wild yeast influence. A stronger sour bite would have helped tremendously - on both the flavor and the mouthfeel. But all in all, I think the product is fair for the price tag. And I think that most DFH fans will dig on this beer too."

"Not quite a white wine due to the unique bitterness and hop/malt characters shyly peeking through, but it's halfway there."
"On tap, not bad. Very different than I thought it would taste. It was light but strong. Had a champagne type of taste initially. Turned out to be quite nice. i would purchase as a pack. i liked it because it was different. Disliked it because it was very outside the norm. hard to explain."

"Was skeptical at first, but I really enjoyed this one and would not hesitate to pick up some more... especially for a nice dinner pairing with fish."

"Overall – Way to go DFH. Not bad, not bad at all. Will pick another up to age. Enjoyable for sure and the alcohol is hidden extremely well."
"Another interesting beer from dogfish head, although I'm not sure I'd describe a beer (or even a wine) made using botrytis as merely a white wine. It's not what the average consumer would expect. Botrytis wines are known as desert wines, because the rot concentrates the sugars in the grapes and lends a (sometimes ethereal) sweetness. This wine certainly exhibits that sweetness, but not in a concentrated way. Since the must is used instead of the wine, you get more of grape juicy sort of sweetness rather than a botrytized sweetness, albeit one with a fair number of tannins providing some grip, particularly on the back end. There is also a nice amount of acidity here providing some balance, which is nice, along with some floral and stone fruit notes. Since we're not talking about a wine, but a beer, I'd be remiss if I didn't also say that there is a fairly luscious creaminess from the grain providing a nice mouth feel and the hops contribute some bitterness that marry well with the tannins. I love the creativity of this brewery. Sometimes it works and sometimes not so much. This time, it works."

"Wow. I've had vinous beers before, but this could totally impress a wine aficionado who might swear off beer. Definitely as much a white wine as it is a saison-style beer, for all intents and purposes. This brewery continues to impress in their gusto for trying new things. Hail!"
""
"I happened to kick the keg on this one and didn't get quite a full pour, but here we go anyway. Served in a tulip glass, a mostly clear golden liquid with a huge, four-finger, white head that didn't relent until the last couple sips, leaving a bit of doily lacing on the glass. Definite wine character in the aroma, pale malts, lemon pith, wet grass. Taste was a bit underwhelming, but followed the aroma, with vinous notes, white grape and apple skins giving a small sourness, light citrus, a bit of grassy funk, and leafy in the finish with some bitterness. Light-medium mouthfeel, pretty crisp and dry, fairly drinkable, but not really one of DFH's best creations."
""
"Again, really interesting beer here. I feel like I've tasted a lot of it before in some bolder saisons, but then there's that extra push of fruity sweetness AND dryness that gives it an additional edge. At times, it seems like the wine characteristics play more than their fair share, which can be a little tiring, but certainly doesn't ruin it. I'm only dropping the Overall score some b/c I think this is a lot to take in at once & can be cumbersome, but still very enjoyable. Can't say I'd rush back to try it again, but I really liked what I got here."
""
""
"O- A very interesting unique take on beer with wine/champagne characteristics. Something everybody should try, especially if they like wine. I gave it 4 out of 5 across the board because I really liked all aspects (but didn't LOVE any one particular area). With a name like Noble Rot you aren't sure what to expect but this was surprisingly good."
""
"Super-clear, this pale yellow beer has an ultra-white head and light complexion. It's aroma is reminiscent of tart apples, lemon juice, and dry white wine. It has a bit of lambic-like funk in the smell, but very sublet. The initial taste is sweeter than expected. It's got a grape-juice and pale malt flavor. Grape skins, apricots, and watermelon rind. It's quite wine-like. The finish is a little dryer, with a lingering tartness. Light in body, this beer is drinkable and would go well with many cheeses."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured on-tap and served in a snifter, the beer is a bright, vibrant, almost clear yellow coloring with a healthy, white, fluffy, frothy head. Aromas are rich in vino characteristics, with a white grape and boozey blend that is light and effervescent. Flavors are also wine-like, as is the body. This is borderline pinot gris. Sweet, smooth, and slightly dry grape characteristics with a rich, sugary body that avoids cloying. It really is like drinking a glass of carbonated wine. Slick, loose film along the glass as you drink. The aftertaste is tart, and slightly drying. A sweet, heavy finish that is slightly tart, leaving a bit of a pucker feeling in the mouth. Very unique, that is for sure."
""

""

"Improves with warming/breathing and when a little cheese and crackers are added."

"Overall, an interesting creation. I'd be a little hard pressed to call this beer, but who knows. I homebrew a 4.2% ABV light ale that is nothing but two row and a couple ounces of 10 degree crystal and this is still lighter in color, which is amazing. I wish there were more sourness to this. Maybe it would come on with age, but I don't love this enough to get another for the cellar. Bette than some of the other more recent DFH creations."
"O This was served with a green salad topped with olive oil and pepper and the tart taste off set the flavor of the greens....yum! Love Saisons"
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being high. Overall it was a decent tasting beer but it was a little too close to white wine for me. The aroma had some decent beer qualities to it, but the taste was dominated by the grapes. It was a cool experiment but not something I think I'd purchase again. If I wanted a drink that tasted like white wine I think I'd just buy a good white wine."
""
"O: I quite like it, but Chateau Jiahu will always be my go to grape ale."
"O- This is really agood mix, the dryness of the saison base is complimented by the juicy wine addition."
""
""
""
"Appears as a yellowish pilsner or light lager. Lots of nice little micro bubbles with little to no lacing and about zero head retention. Smells slightly of a Belgian blonde or ipa but airy and slightly bitter. Agressive carbonation topped with a winey sweetness. Sour and present. Pinot grigio like finish. Somewhat dry but has wet hoppiness to it? Balanced in a way. Wouldn't classify it as a gulper but I would say this would pair well with something peppery or salty. A better exclusive craft from dogfish. Reminds me alot of the mélange e trois from Nebraska but much more drinkable."
"meh. its hard to rate this to style. definitely strays from a saison. a touch of earthy hay flavors, maybe. I'm not a wine fan, so I guess this one isn't something I'd never seek out, but they definitely achieved what they were trying to."
"Dogfish Head never shies away from blazing a trail. Noble Rot is probably as good as a collision of white wine and beer can be. It’s actually good stuff. It’s very interesting and the mix of flavors is impressive. If you’re up for an interesting beer, grab a bottle. It’s surprisingly good!"
""
""
" This saison is dominated by the grape must used in the beer which gives a lot of tangy white grape flavor yet it is spicy too which could be the yeast or the fruit, mild sweetness from the grape which seems to blend well with the light sweetness of the malt which also has a slight toasty and wheat flavor. The mild acidity is nice which contrasts with the malt and there is a nice amount of alcohol to add complexity but not very apparent in the taste until midway into the glass. Overall I was very excited to try this and it lived up to my expectations. This is the most wine-like beer/wine hybrid I have ever tasted a very interesting and flavorful beer"
""
""
"Noble Rot basically tastes like a sour white wine. Although I did enjoy my one glass of this one, I'm not a huge white wine fan and will probably steer clear of this in future. With that said, this is certainly an interesting and well-made beer that hides its relatively high ABV quite well."
""
"Poured into a snifter, this is a clear light golden color. It is very fizzy with a decent amount of head. Smell is very sweet with a lot of fruit juice elements: pear, apple, white grape. There is some light spiciness, mostly clove. The taste is pretty unusual, with a tart and sour flavor being the dominating factor. There is still a lot of fruit presence, headed up by white grapes and apple. The alcohol is disguised very well. The mouthfeel is very unusual, a kind of silkiness I wasn't expecting from the beer's appearance. Pretty quirky, but I like it."
""
"O-A nice beer? it does have many wine characteristics. An interesting hybrid."
"This is a light bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. It is quite spicy with a good mixture of flavoring. It is a solid take on the saison style with a pleasant grape twist. As it warns up, the alcohol produces a nice warming effect all the way down. This is a brew I will enjoy again the next time I see it available."
"Beer is light in body, a little grainy on the finish, astringent but the grapes are the star of the show here. The must comes through quite well, I enjoyed it but it go slow going by the end of hte bottle, probably not a likely repeat."

"3.5 D: I never had Infinium, but it seems like this is what they should have been going for. Interesting as usual from DFH."
"O - Overall, I feel like this was one of the more successful ""off-centered ales"" that DFH has produced. I feel that this could be a great craft beer for any wine enthusiast to try. A really interesting mix of the two styles and one that I'd likely try again sometime."
""
"Another interesting beer from DFH, but too sweet for me and not that complex. Dry it up with some oak aging and bottle conditioning and this beer would be improved."
""
""
"O: I think Dogfish Head did a fantastic job of executing a beer/wine hybrid. Instead of a wine, I brought this to a family dinner to share, and everyone was very impressed with this. I would certainly have it again. This was a great conversation and crossover beer, and it is certainly well-executed. I would be interested to see if DFH could do the same type of thing with some red grapes to make a red wine/beer hybrid."
"Incidentally, this review had the most references to wine than any other I've ever written...understandably I guess."
"o- im a huge saison dude and i would put this up in my top 5. ipa and stout guys will crush this beer but if you like sweet beers this one is for you. Its almost like a summer shandy except its a riesling instead of lemonade. if you see it buy it! and enjoy"
"DFH is the only brewer I've found so far that finds that sweet spot between beer and wine. While Midas Touch gets you most of the way there, this one truly occupies that tart, malty and tangy place that you'd expect a wine/beer to be. That all said, however, this is not a particularly favorite style. Still, it is good as a once-in-while brew, especially when it is done as well as this."
"Overall, once I got used to the sour/tart combo, I found the beer quite good, especially after I noticed that the flavors were strong enough to mask the 9% ABV. I do wish something could be done about the tree twig aftertaste, but luckily another mouthful of beer quickly solves that (admittedly, this is a very dangerous solution). Certainly an interesting brew, and like almost everything Dogfish Head makes, is worth trying."
""
"Poured a very pale yellow, kinda of like the color of a white wine. Saison? Really. Weak,thin mouthfeel. Nothing realy complex about this concoction. Pleasant enough to drink, but if I want a white wine,I will drink a white wine. Its cool what DFH attempts in the beer realm, but this isn't my favorite and I will not revisit."
""
""
"There's lots of carbonation in this beer, but it's all quite soft. That works for sure. Body on the lighter side of medium. I wish the beer were dryer. Overall, this is a fun beer that I enjoyed a bit more than this score indicates (and this is a good score from me). I'd have no problems polishing off a whole bottle by myself (and if it weren't for the alcohol I'd want a second)."
"I would love to try this one again so I can appreciate some of the care that went into making it."
"I have to admit that the last couple of specialty brews from DFH have been disappointing so I've started to lower my expectations. However, this one surprised me on the positive side. Very good and very unique."
"The palate is pretty vinous, rather incredibly so. I'd be lying if I said bum wine didn't cross my mind, but there's more to it than a moderately fruity white wine. Yes, it's sweet, but it's musty, musky, mildly acidic (ripe lemons), and quite fruity (melons, grapes) as well as a moderate tannic character. Grape skins dominate the mid-palate. A touch spicy, though I'd be hard pressed to positively identify the yeast as a saison strain, it's almost tripel-like. A touch phenolic and fusel-y on the finish, this beer finishes a little sweet with some alcohol noticeable. Mildly funky but not really sour. Highly carbonated, this is one beer where that actually works. Yes, this beer has flaws, but it is a joy, both to drink and to deconstruct. I don't know what the botrytis has added her, but it does make me want to go out an buy a bottle of a beerenauslese."
""
"O-this is definitely a different saison, if thats what you call it. it has some really great flavor to it. not as funky or as spicy as i like my saisons to be, but very enjoyable nontheless. i guess you can't truly rate this as a saison, but instead as an off centered ale. in that respect, it's great and extremely easy drinking for the ABV. i will enjoy all 750 mL of this."
""
"Okay, I'm sucker for inventive (a/k/a wacky) beer experiments, but this one really works. Great dry character - amazing drinkability for the abv. Up front a typical saison funkyness, but close behind is a reserved but distinctive apple cider vinegar note that harmonizes with the beer in a way that I found surprising. Finish was clean with a lingering touch of vinegar acidity. Quite an interesting experience."
"another white wine style offering from dogfish. this one pours as average as can be, with a mildly hazy pale look and a modest white head. smells like tannins and cologne. flavor is musty and grapey, like an old starburst soaked in chardonnay. had a sour characteristic, but it isnt brett. hard to place this one. feel is nice, good bubbles and a drinkable body. overall a unique creation bordering on not beer, like a lot of DFH brews. i support the creativity here though, keep em coming doods..."
"As usual, with Dogfish Head, they're attempting to push the borders with craft beer. This beer has an interesting nose with light notes of sour citrus. The methods used in brewing this beer create a unique character that is quite different and mask the alcohol well. Mouthfeel is dry, like a sauvignon blanc, and complex. Nice job overall Dogfish Head!"
""
"Overall I am very surprised at how awesome this is. I love the sweet and the tartness going on here and feel that DFH once again is a top brewer!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I tend to prefer sweet to tart, and I can't stand Brett, so I am surprised I enjoyed this as much as I did. This is most definitely more wine than beer, but wow what a great marriage."
""
"O- This beer possess traits of a Saison (Hennepin), Belgian Tripel (La Fin Du Monde) and a sparkling wine. However, the extremely light body and delicate carbonation makes this concoction unique. Highly drinkable and a must for all fans of any of the aforementioned libations. Personally, I wish that the sourness was a bit more pronounced...something a bottle with some age might reveal. Very worthy."
"Very interesting beer here. Pours a light yellow color with very little head retention, very similar to a champagne/sparking wine. you can smell the white grapes in it right off the bat. The taste is dry and tart. Grapes mix well with the light malt flavor it gives off. i get a sort of apple flavor that is very pleasant and crisp. It's unlike any other beer I have had before. I great beer all around and something i would buy again though it is a little bit over priced."
""
"O-this is interesting. great mix. I can definitely taste the grape/barely mix. wouldn't mind having this on occasion. very over priced though."
""
""
""
"O- Quite enjoyable and complex, I very much enjoyed this beer and the marriage of wine and beer flavors and textures. Definitely will seek this out again in the future"
""
"I really don't know what to think about this beer. I'm not a wine drinker, but I appreciate the attempt at marriage. I have a hard time grading this as a saison so I am going on mostly personal taste with a bonus point for originality."
""
"O: Just a so-so pale ale. Nothing really special or anything I would remember."
"A hybrid ale brewed with grapes. Pours a bright, clear golden color. Aroma of sweet cider, phenolic yeast and a touch of malt. In the taste, some vinous qualities with lemon, citrus rind, mild Belgian ale yeast and faint hop. Gets progressively sour, which was the highlight of this brew. Almost as if aged in an old bretty barrel, there's a nice tang to this one. Strong comparisons to wine brew are well founded. Light to medium bodied, crisp, yet slightly syrupy. Overall, I like this ale alot, the sour component made it really work well."
"O-I think it is a very well crafted beer, the grapes definitely add alot to the beer without hindering the style. One of DFH's better experiments"
"Overall – It was an alright beer, but a bit too much on the side of wine. If I want wine I will drink wine thanks."
""
""
""
""
"Check it out. With some age, the grape essence will likely strengthen."
""
"Given the must that's supposed to create extra sweetness, this remains very citric and tart, and in fact quite dry."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is light and airy and slightly gritty, very fresh and pleasant. Overall, I like this beer."
"O- This is a great unique beer from DFH and I feel that they did a great job with this beer. I really hope that they make more of this, I will be buying more!"
"Noble Rot had a clear body with a white inch thick head. It had the smell of almost a white wine. Tasted of light grapes and and just like the smell almost of a white wine. The feel on the pallate was that of a light beer easy and smooth. Overall was a great beer and glad i got to have it."
"The experiment is wild but not offensive; I won't return to this one, though"
"O: I wasn’t expecting this to be sour. Tastes like Jolly Pumpkin and Midas Touch had a baby. White grape, sour lemon, honey and Brett are the dominate flavors. The 9% abv is well hidden. Very unique but I'm rather indifferent on this one."
"Overall a you think your drinking a wine with beer characteristics. Its refreshing, very champagne like, maybe the Champagne of beers, oops...I think someone uses that one already."
"o - Overall a pretty good and interesting beer. I remember having this on tap at EBF last year (2011) and not really caring for it, but a year later I liked it quite a bit. I think the nose smells a lot like a white wine, while the taste is a slightly sour white wine. My girlfriend, who drinks wine but normally doesn't like sours, liked the nose a lot, but wasn't a fan of the taste as she foudn it too sour; I didn't think it was overally sour though. Very nice experiment, might pick up a bottle now."
""
"Frothy three finger head with excellent retention and nice lacing on a clear straw with light gold hues body. Very crisp aroma with strong fruity ester presence mostly lemon and Belgian spice. Flavor is more on the sour side than sweet. More lemon mostly with an herbal note to the finish. Light to medium body and high carbonation with a moister finish than many other sailings out there. Overall a nice offering from dogfish. Little too sour for my tastes when it comes to saisons."
"O - As I said, I respect the effort. This is clearly a product of Dogfish Head's we'll-try-anything attitude, and lives somewhere between beer and wine. The problem is, it is neither a good beer nor a good wine. It is a fun experiment, but one bottle was plenty for me."
""
""
"Remarkably, the 9% alcohol is nowhere to be found. The alcohol warmth is surplanted by sharp acidity and making this beer much more drinkable than it should be. This is not a typical Saison. The brewers went and Dogfish Headed it up pretty well. Anyone seeking this beer should expect a lot of grape character and Berliner Weisse tartness to dominate."
"O-This beer is not worth it to me. I had high hopes for it as I do enjoy grape in beers when done correctly or if the wine notes are more subtle or if the beer was aged in barrels that once held wine. I feel if this was just made not as a saison but as even a stout it would have been so much better. The flavors do not mix right for my palette."
"O: I think oak would really add a dimension to this beer that would increase the enjoyability. This is very champagne like and has nice flavors, abv is well integrated"
""
""
"D - Different, but I like this one; goes great with a light meal or a pasta dish; could definitely have again; crosses the fermentation line between a beer and wine"
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a really nice Farmhouse Ale."
""
"O: I like this beer, overall. It's like a dry, sour white wine with a very light and refreshing body that makes its abv dangerous. Quite impressive."
"O - Ta Henket, Faithfull, and Hellhound made me question buying these large format limited DFH beers. Not since Bitches Brew have I felt that one of these beers is worth $15. This beer was. Its crazy how it has wine and beer notes. Very complex and unique while still remaining refreshing and delicious."
"750 ml bottle. Served in a tulip, the beer pours a clear light gold color with about an inch off-white head that sticks around for a little while. There's also a good amount of lacing. The brew smells like green grapes, yeast, apples, white wine, and some grain/bready malt. I think the taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's also some tart fruity flavors noticeable too. The flavors are more wine-like than beer-like (however I'm not exactly a wine person), but in this case it works for me. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it has moderate carbonation and it's easy enough to drink. I think this is a good brew, I'd buy it again in the future."
"Pours a bright golden color with brilliant clarity. Interesting nose, very vinous. Some detectable malt. Light and fizzy body yet full feeling in the mouth. Lots of white wine like taste. Like a sauvigoin blanc even though its viognier grapes. Tart like finish with a white wine like aftertaste. Truly drinks more like a wine than anything else and a pretty good wine at that. Unfortunately the beer aspects are covered up by the powerful grape like qualities. Not bad though, I like it. Amazing what you can do with beer."
"Overall: These Dogfish Head experiments are usually hit or miss for me; this one is a little different as I enjoyed it but would be unlikely to seek it out again"
""
"Mouth shows great carbonation and is creamy in the middle. Long finish is fantastic."
"Comes out of the bottle a clear, slightly wan solar yellow with a thick, fluffy white head. OK, so I prefer dark beers - I'll cut this some slack since it's a saison and not a porter. The head does leave some generous lacing - that's a half point right there. Aroma is robust and fruity, mainly apple and grape with a hint of banana and just a whisper of citrus, as well as a yeasty and slightly earthy undertone. Flavor fills the mouth with lip-puckering sour apple and yeast, plus subtle grape, malt and butterscotch notes. Texture is firm-bodied, edgy and lively, sour all the way down to the tummy. Though this is technically a saison, I recommend it to all lovers of sour beers - if sour is your, ahem, cup of tea, you should enjoy this one."
""
"O - There have been a lot of these wine beers coming out recently and I just can't really get into them. The wine kind of overpowers and is just not that good. I might try aging it for a bit, but right now it is not worth the $."
"O- this is really, really good. A unique take on a saison"
"O- Completely different than anything I have had before. I though Midas Touch was close to a wine, but this one is very wine-like. Very unique, not a good choice if you are looking for malt and hops."
"I really enjoyed this beer. Had this right after a big test. Poured a super clean, light golden color with minimal head. Very complex aroma, full of fruit and sour, with hints of wine in the backdrop. The taste falls somewhere between a sour and a white wine. Clean, oaky, with a bit of sour that rounds it all out into something fantastic. Lasts just a little bit on the tongue for an overall awesome beer."
""
"D: the grape aroma/flavor is so strong, this almost drinks like a watered down glass of white wine. even the appearance is a bit wine-like. tough to find the saison aspect behind all these grape notes, but it is certainly there on the palate. a very unique product and one that i am really enjoying."
"O: This is easily one of the most interesting beers I've ever had. It basically starts out like a saison and finishes like a white wine. My palate and brain hurt, but I enjoyed this offering. I've never had anything quite like it."
"Reviewed on: 02-16-2012 5:30pm"

""
"O: Certainly not like any saison I've had before - not sure I'd even categorize it as such. Nonetheless, it's an oddly drinkable, easy to like beer."
"Overall I'd say this brew is 90% wine 10% beer. The only notes one can notice of a beer in this brew is the very nice lacy , the small bit of head and the mouth feel on the way down. I love dogfish head but this brew is hardly beer at all as a wine or spirit it is top notch ! That's why id did not rate this beer in any thing over a 4."
"I have no doubt I will buy this one again. A fun unique saison."

"O: Not bad for a DFH project of late. Probably the best DFH beer I have had since Bitches Brew. I like where they were going with this and wonder if time will change this beer at all. Might pick up another bottle to see how it ages."

"Salute!"

"D- super drinkable and refreshing."
""
"Complex, interesting, tart, and wine-like. Good wine/beer? OK."
"This experiment definitely succeeded. I really enjoy highly carbonated beer, so the mouthfeel was great. With the high carbonation and slight dryness, Noble Rot would probably work well as a palate cleanser of creamy cheeses. Much better than I expected."
"O: The saison base is decent, and the grape must adds a huge wine character to the beer. I would definitely enjoy this more in a month or 2 when the warmer temperatures start showing up, even though the higher abv works well for this time of year. I'd say that this is a nice new addition to their rotating line-up"
"Pours a light gold color, very clear with a small white head. Almost looks like a white wine, or sparkling cider. The nose is very wine-like, grapes, citrus, yeast and a little funk. Very light in character. The taste follows suit- very interesting wine/beer love child. None of the 9% abv is evident. Feel is light, heavily carbonated, and has a dry finish. I enjoyed this experiment- very interesting take on the style. Cheers."
"O- very good, and honestly much better then I expected, very white wine like, creamy and dry and the way the rot and slight belgianyness intermingle leaves almost oak like notes of complexity. Deffinatly enjoyed this."
""
""
""
"Very pale and clear. Liberal amount of head quickly dissipates into a thin film. Not much lace on glass - just a few dots persist. Aroma is kind of funky like a Belgian blonde. Definitely some citrus and a bit of apricot. The taste is predominantly sour. There is not much bitterness from any hops. Some sweet maltiness comes out on the back end, along with a winey/alcoholy character. Robust body, with medium carbonation. Surprisingly rich for a beer with such a light color. Overall, I enjoyed it - a nice experiment with grape must."
""
"O: Overall I really like this new offering. The PJ Faithful Ale and the new Tweason'ale aren't really my bag. But this beer I personally really enjoyed. I feel like it'd be a great beer to pair with cheeses or meats, especially with the significant amount of vinous wine flavors present."
""
""
""
"This beer poured out with a very beautiful clarity to it. The beer was clear yellow in color with a fizzy white head on top. The smell of the beer has a little bit of funk on the nose but remains pretty soft. The taste of the beer bites the sides of the tongue. It's got an interesting amount of sourness to it but it's not strong enough to make you pucker up. It tastes more along the lines of a white wine. The mouthfeel is light, with moderate carbonation. Overall it was an enjoyable Saision."
""
"M: The mouthfeel has plenty of sweet white grapes without the dryness that comes with the wine - a sweet-bodied ale."
""
"D: I found this to be one of the more fascinating brews I've experienced, and one of the better experiments from DFH. I certainly plan on picking up more to experience it again. While I am certainly no wine connoisseur, I do know that much of what is acceptable (and even encouraged) in beer can ruin a wine. This rather significant difference between the two makes this an unlikely marriage, and I'm pleased to see that the potential negative could be avoided to create an intriguing hybrid of the two... now if it could be done with a red varietal,!"
"Cheers"
""
"O- Looks like its a joke but one sip will leave you wanting more. For the style i'm not sure its there with the Farmhouse but its a sweeter version... OK in my book."
""
"Overall lemon and grape in the palate, and a real interesting take that matches for a beer. I would love to give this to my wine friends. This would be great for a wine person (not unlike myself). Botrytis and classic dessert wines this is not, but a good marriage of wine and beer nonetheless, I am not sure why they used Vigonier but no complaints. This is also a bit of a style blur, it probably deserves its own category."
"O: This tasted like a mix between Midas Touch and champagne, which is not surprising, considering it is 49% wine. I thought the taste could have been more complex, especially as there were no detectable flavors from the yeast, and the carbonation was a bit low for the style. Having a sweet tooth, I did not enjoy this as much as the two other ancient Dogfish beers which use grapes, but if you have always yearned for a more tart Midas Touch, then you'll probably like Noble Rot a lot. A beer worth trying, and certainly more successful than most of DFH's newly bottled brews."

"Don't drink and review."
"Overall I did like this; a very interesting brew. However, I would appreciate the brewers taking this idea even further and make the beer more extreme. As a saison, it loses much semblance for the style beyond the aroma."
"Pours a fairly-clear golden color with a nice white head that sticks around before falling and leaving a good amount of lacing. The nose brings forward some nice saison yeast along with white wine and grapes. Also there is a bit of light citrus character. The flavor melds spice and white-wine character fairly well, adding in a bit of acidity. The mouthfeel is fairly light and has a lightly-acidic finish that is nice and dry. Experimental for sure, but certainly well made."
"The CPJ"
"O: An interesting twist on a saison, lighter on the Belgian spices and heavier on grapes. Deceptively high in ABV as well, drinks very easy."
"Overall: this was a very interesting take on a saison that has wine-like qualities. Enjoyable slow drinking beer."
"Had at the pub in Rehoboth. Poured a hazy straw color with nearly no head retention which looks alot like a glass of wine in my snifter. The aromas are very intense ranging from malty to phenolic and spicy,sweet. No lacing but good carbonation which I'm sure is due to the wine grape additions. The saison yeast is awesome and has a lovely spice character that balances out the maltiness. Sweetness hits the back of your palate and lingers. Tart fruit and some citrus are very present as it warms up a bit."
"Overall it was unique, refreshing, and interesting. Well worth seeking out!!!"
"O - I'm very glad that this was a snifter pour. Not counting the relatively high abv, it has a big smack to the palate of flavor. It's very good in my opinion as it blends the good qualities of a saison with a pinot gris wine."
"O: Great taste and very drinkable even with the higher ABV."
"O- great take on a saison style beer. a hazy golden beer with sweet citrusy smell. Had a very unique sour flavor that had hints of white wine and lemongrass."
"Drinkability: This beer was very different from anything else I had ever tried. I liked it and it was very crisp. I would call this a wine lover's beer."
"An interesting offering from the Dogfish brewpub. Unusual for the style, but definitely worth a try."
"Very interesting beer with lots of grape presence and some sourness to it. Since the Saison style is so diverse I guess this would fit right in."
