Pours a deep golden straw color. Smells yeasty and sweet, typical Belgian aromas. Taste a little on the sweet side. Cloves, maybe corriander and pineapple, other baking spices, sweet yeast, faint banana, very citrusy with a crisp finish. A think it has a solid flavor profile compared to a lot in the style. Very drinkabke. I like it. Dinged it overall just because $12 bomber price tag (man do I hate it when I find a beer I like that is 22oz only), but would love to have again.","WesMantooth","May 03, 2014"

It's definitely one of the least hoppy offerings I've had from them, but it was without a doubt flavorful and in particular was great to drink outside on a nice day, as I did. The floral notes are fantastic on this, and it's worth buying for that reason alone. The flavor is less complex overall, but it drinks quite well. It's a good way to take a departure from their hoppier offerings yet still get something that's complex in its own way.","magictacosinus","Aug 25, 2013"

Initially sweet, bready, and herbal. A bit of funk and wet dog aroma...Also get sweet apples and cinnamon. A bit of orange peel as well. Taste is at first grainy and a bit musty with some sweet apple flavor. Subdued hops with Belgian yeast and bready malt flavors. Tons of herbs and spices...somewhat winter-like. Very unique flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth and creamy. No alcohol flavor detected. Drinkability is high. Overall, this was one great beer.

Aroma has a big punch of citrus, and herbal spice, chalky yeast notes, and a touch of alcohol coming together. As I take my first initial sips, I get a strong assertive bitterness from the herbal chamomile, citrus peel edges, and strong long lasting spicy notes from the yeast. Bright citric notes initially followed by hints of bready sweetness all followed by a strong alcohol flavor, it was the last bottle available at Chalet Premier in North Lima, OH. Worth it to try it, sense I've been looking for this beer pretty much since they first brewed it. Mouthfeel was effervescent with sturdy carbonation medium bodied yet mellow and smooth nothing overbearing, a bit of alcohol warmth I welcomed along with a lasting spice/bitterness on the palate. Overall a truly tasty American brewed saison, which was definitely worth it. Will I revisit this one soon, probably not because I prefer the hoppy 3 Floyd's offerings.","WVbeergeek","May 22, 2012"

Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, earth, earthy hop, spices, and floral notes. The flavor was of sweet malt, earth, earthy hop, spices, floral, wheat, banana, fruit, and subtle bubble gum. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. The aroma on this one was pretty nice and inviting. It was really well balanced and was fairly good for the Saison genre. The flavor was fairly good, but it was a little more toward the earthy side of things rather than being really well balanced like the aroma. This was unfortunate, but didn’t kill the brew overall. Still really nicely done and I’m really glad I got to try this one just because the label art is SO badass…","thagr81us","May 04, 2012"

Initially sweet, bready, and herbal. A bit of funk and wet dog aroma...Also get sweet apples and cinnamon. A bit of orange peel as well. Taste is at first grainy and a bit musty with some sweet apple flavor. Subdued hops with Belgian yeast and bready malt flavors. Tons of herbs and spices...somewhat winter-like. Very unique flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth and creamy. No alcohol flavor detected. Drinkability is high. Overall, this was one great beer. Not very typical for the average saison, as it is unlike any one I have tasted before. I got this as an extra in a trade and wish I had access to purchasing it myself.","DovaliHops","0"

3.92,4.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"O: I thought this had some really good interesting qualities, but the alcohol is a bit too much of a villian here for my liking. I think that some people (hard alcohol drinkers) would be really intrigued by this saison, but I found it to be frustrating over the course of a pint. I was getting a lot of interesting notes at first, but after time the alcohol just seemed to make the flavor window smaller and smaller. I found myself having to focus on what comes before the alcohol, as I would lose sensitivity. That was too bad, but when this is good it's good. This would go very well with a full belly and some hearty dark greens and earthy veggies. Beet salads would make for a nice subtly sweet contrast.","Cavery","Jul 25, 2011"

Light aroma, light spice, bananas and light grain, nothing really over the top here at all and very understated. The taste was a bit bigger, grainy with a light fruit hint to it, but still nothing that is terribly over the top. Good, but not great. Light dry finish with a hint of peach and pear as it rolls out.

The nose comprises lemon zest, lightly funky wheat, light coriander, black pepper, orange zest, and grass. The taste maintains some the of the citrus leaned toward in the smell, but focuses more on an earthy and spicy character, with notes of clove, cardamom, nutmeg, light balsa, heavy wheat, and honey.

Tangy and herbal aromas of woodruff, mint, and birch. A symphony of saison and fruit elements. The body has a sturdy crystal malt underpinning that contributes a continual light voltage current of caramel. Flavors of malt, birch, woodruff, allspice, light orange, cinnamon cross the palate one after the other. Cinnamon-allspice also unveils itself in the bouquet. Light tingle of alcohol and cinnamon allspice finish. At a point I picked up some butter pumpkin/butternut squash. This brew reinvents itself with each whiff of aroma and sip after sip. Medium bodied and decent carbonation throughout.","CuriousMonk","Apr 18, 2011"

It starts off kind of musty in the taste, but then all of those spices come rushing in. Alcohol is nicely hidden too. Body is pretty thick for a Saison.

Faint barnyard is nearly lost under all the sweet fruit and spices only showing themselves after the beer had warmed up to nearly room temperature. Finish is very dry and doesn't linger.

Drinkability is great. Has a nice refreshing quality to it, like a spiced up Gumballhead. I love how this smells and tastes, truly unique. If it wasn't for the high ABV and the price tag, I could easily enjoy this one all night long. Highly recommended!","DavidEddie","Dec 22, 2007"

Aromas of spice, and a slight Belgian saison summery funk. A nice interplay of spicy malts and home grown malts with an atypical green hop resiny three floyds amarillo twist. Taste is spicy up front with a nice yeast and malt character, but the hops are there too. to me, this is Three Floyds major brewing fault and success. They really do have a trademark flavor. None of their beers taste to different from one another, but than again, they are all pretty damn nice and drinkable. This one features a smooth prickly carbonation and a great mouthfeel that lends to a nice drinkability. Nice.","francisweizen","Dec 18, 2007"

Aroma- was earthy spices and cinnamon. Poured out a foggy orange, with no head or lacing to speak of. First time Ive seen that with a saison style beer. Taste was like a big old bowl of cinammon toast crunch- very bready, toasty and extra helpings of cinammon and sugar. Mouthfeel was pretty thick and carbonation was medium to low- not in style. The finish of the beer was more dry than sweet , and I picked up some booziness on the finish. Not my thing, but an interesting take on the style.

Finishes with a little spicy hop bitterness. This has many similarities to a winter warmer, but without the dark roasted malts. It's kind of like a summer warmer. Packed full of flavor, but maintains a light, dry feel. An interesting sweet, spicy brew that's easy to drink, but the alcohol will sneak up on you. RR would certainly be enjoyable for fans of this flavor profile.","Daehpoh","Jun 13, 2007"

Sweet malt notes with touches of sweet fresh right out of the oven bread notes. Flavors are really built around the spiciness and floral aspects. Nutmeg plays the biggest role. Smooth though spicy mouthfeel that leads to a softness in the finish. High abv goes unnoticed on the palate with the spices lending to the smoothness. Drinkable, but not one I'd go out of my way to get more then once. You have to be in the mood for the rabbid rabbit.","bjohnson","Jun 12, 2007"

Balanced. I cannot believe this was 9%. No indication of that! The most mellowed of hops but an abundance of malt that keeps everything in check.

More cinnamon, all spice, nutmeg, and sweet candy sugar. Didn't notice the chamomile. A very sweet drink, almost too sweet. Mouthfeel was a bit on the thin side but definitely had a good flavor.

It is a strong fruity smell. I get a lot of soft fruits in there, but nothing citrusy or sharp. There are hints of nutmeg, cinnamon, and the dead on smell of fresh plain yogurt. The yogurt aroma is exceedingly overpowering to all other flavors. The chamomile is no where to be found. The aromas transfer to the taste but the yogurt seems to leave and turn into cinnamon and nutmeg. There is very little to no malt character, but the woody chamomile flavor comes out as it warms. The mouthfeel is rather full for the style guides, but then again farmhouse ales, are very subjective. It is a very drinkable beer. And something rather new.","quasimoto","Apr 21, 2007"

It was a golden orangish color that was slightly opaque with a visible alcohol shimmer. It has about a finger of head that quickly went away. The smell was herbal and fruity with a definite alcohol presence. It didn't really smell like the typical saison but nothing FFF's does fits the normal definition (which I'm finding is not a good thing). The taste was really sweet with a kick at the end. ABV also shows in the taste. Much more so than other saisons that I've enjoyed. Overall, it's a good one but a poor saison. This is the 5th FFF's that I've had and I find that I like them to a moderate level as a beer but find they don't match the styles very well. Now that's fine since I don't believe you have to rigidly follow a style guide but it makes it tough to figure their beers out. For example, saison is one of my favorite styles but I wouldn't recommend this a saison. It's more like a Belgian Strong ale (3.5, RB, T, O)","TexIndy","Apr 16, 2007"

Aromatically, it was a little too clean, which may have been due to me over chilling it. I could detect floral hops and green apple (which must be the chamomile), but none of the funk and spiciness that is typical of farmhouse ale. The taste was dominated by hops and chamomile with some unfermented candy sugar still evident. The warmer the beer got, the stronger the chamomile taste and smell became. Like Avery 12 (which has lavender), the flowers gave this a one dimensional quality. But unlike the 12, this was an agreeable one dimensionality. I much prefer the funky yeasty Saisons over these floral varieties. The Mouthfeel was medium thick, which was more in line with a Trippel than a Saison.

4.17,10.9,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Served on tap. Pours a hazy gold with a thick white head. Lavender and chamomile dominate the aroma. Some floral spiciness linger in the background from the hops. The body is full and very flavorfull. Definately something different to drink if you have not had a saison before.","jlh8643","Sep 26, 2002"
4.02,6.9,3,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Tasted at the 2003 Oregon Brewers Fest. Medium gold color. Medium head. Aroma is a touch barnyard, leather and must. A medium bodied saison. Malts are fruity and slightly sweet. Hops are floral. Smooth taste. Light and refreshing. Very nice beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet.","beerguy101","Jun 22, 2002"
4.25,13,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Very good beer:  wonderful aroma of Belgian yeast/banana, with the same initial taste.  Initial impressions are misleading, however, as the taste was dominated by hops, with a spicy kick.  Nice alcohol warmth in the end. Excellent.","jackndan","Beers"
3.78,0.5,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Amber-gold color, with a nice white head.  Good retention.  Very spicy aroma - the coriander really comes through, with undertones of citrusy orange.  Good flavor, spicy, yeasty, and smooth.  Taste of alcohol apparent as the beer warms.  Lightly zesty mouthfeel with the continual carbonation.  Overall, a tasty brew.  Not really my favorite style, so hopefully my review isn't skewed...","Viking","0"
