"O: This is a really nice saison/farmhouse ale. It is not the most complex example of the style out there, but it tastes great and is easy to drink. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
"Looks and smells fine, but the taste is just not what I was expecting from a saison.  The main flavor that I got was quite vegetal.  Maybe I'm missing the boat on this one, but I can't say I really enjoyed it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A marvelous brew that I would highly recommend. Extremely drinkable."
"On tap at Nix's Mate. Poured clear golden, no head. Apricot, walnut, champagne yeast aromas. Spicy and peppery with mild bitter hop finish on the back of the tongue."
"A little heavy and juicy on the mouthfeel, and more noticeably drying ABV for a traditional saison, but dry and very well-balanced. After all it's a ""Saison Americaine," and very tasty/refreshing at that."

"This is a good beer that is refreshing, relatively simple and easy to  drink. I enjoyed it but it has some subtle off flavors and lacks refinement and complexity for a saison."
""
""
""
""
"Just wasn't feeling it. Floral and citrus flavors with a bit of spice but it wasn't appealing my taste buds as it left an odd grassy aftertaste."
""
""
""
"Poured a lemony gold with lots of free flowing bubbles. Creamy and bumpy white head,  but if was gone pretty quick.  Funky apple, sweet and sour aroma; spice phenols really dominate from there on out. Very altruistic and light,  semi dry feel.  Tart and quite peppery.  Sweet outweighs sour. General berry,  starfruit, banana, honeydew."

"on tap in North Adams.  Probably unfair to rate a drinkable, mild beer so low; but I want some kind of funky character to my saison and this didn't get my attention: just went well with a burger."

"Could use a little more carbonation to break up the sweetness, but again, may have gone past its bottle-conditioned prime and has lost some CO2."

"Smells and tastes more like a heffeweisen than a saison, sweet and too fruity for my tastes. Cloudy and orange like one too. More citrus than anything else, and I prefer more earthy and peppery notes in my saisons."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a decent bubbly white head. The beer itself is a clear orange with slight yellow notes and is pretty well-filtered. The beer smell has strong hop and malt notes. The hop notes are primarily earth and bitter with a slight hint of citrus. The malts are sweet to balance the hops but a fairly faint in comparison. The smell also has hints of pepper and salt that make the smell smell pretty good. The taste is not as complex as the smell but is still pretty good. The taste has strong hop notes that are earthy and bitter while the malts provide a slight sweetness to dull the hops. The taste also has an ever present tartness that mixes well with the earthiness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with bubbly carbonation but still has a smooth finish. Overall, a very good saison and worth getting again."

"Better than your average Saison but in no way one of the best I've had."
""
""
""
""

"Interesting. Starts out like a better than average Saison. Bananas. Mellows out as it warms and becomes much more subtle. Cloudy, golden, decent head and lace. Medium carbonation. Dry, with a bit of citrus. Medium body."

"Light golden beer, thin head, funky nose.  Slight funky barn yard notes with dry hoppy finish and strong black pepper spice notes. Yeasty aftertaste, light-medium body, bisquick biscuity malt profile. Crisp finish."

"Mouthfeel is very lively, light and spritzy as often expected from saisons. Very drinkable and I would have guessed a lighter abv approaching more of a table saison. Nothing stands out to make this an overly complex or interesting beer. The cereal flavor felt out of place as noted."
""
""
"This might very well be my new favorite in the genre! Complex and easy to drink, this should be high on you shopping list."

"O - This is a refreshing saison. It hits the spot after working in a near 90° day. The bitterness is more than I care for in this style, but it is not overwhelming and compliments the lemon and must, so I won't complain."
""
""
""
"O- Not a fan of this one. I would not recommend going after this; definitely go after CBC or Trillium or even NIght Shift if you have to get a saison from the greater Boston area."

"The taste was all about the spice. It was quit different that the aroma. Spice an more spice. Then a touch of citrus came through. Pretty refreshing."
"Definitely worth the $7.50 I paid for it."
""
"A light clear yellow in hue, the beer is topped with a sumptuous, short, even head having the consistency and color of stiff, beaten egg whites. Its aroma is negligible. The taste is admirably understated, but that is not to say forgettable. It's a classic, buttered vegetables and lightly blossomy saison, done with refined understatement. The mouthfeel ably complements the flavor--not too smooth, not too prickly. Worthy."
"Overall this is a nice beer with the barnyard you would expect with a little fruit and quite a bit of spices. The spices are more prominent than any beer I have drank in a while. Quite nice,"
"O- Nicely tempered Saison. The flavor is good, not too strong."
""
""
"Great moderately high carbonation works perfectly."
""
""
""
""
"Golden color with small head. Spicy grainy malty slightly hoppy aroma. American saison for sure. Fantastic spicy saison flavor...malt, hop, spice from the yeast, really nice. Each is subtle, but each is dominant...its very drinkable. the sharpness of the yeast actually makes this very drinkable and not dull or mundane. What a fantastic brew...cant wait to have another."

"Pours a clear gold with thin fizzy white head, settles quickly leaving a couple of wispy runs. Smell: herbal, lightly grainy and bready, rindy and unripe banana notes. Taste: semi sweet pale, light stone fruit and pineapple, very herbal finish. Long finish eventually dries out but has a residual soapiness. It's alright. Think I've heard more about this one than is deserved. Dec 2013 bottling."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Worth a try, but not one of the better saisons I've had. It'd almost be better paired with something like a rich, ripened goat cheese as a compliment. It feels incomplete. More of a palate cleanser."

"About a half finger of bright white foam for a head, mixed bubble sizes, doesn’t seem like it wants to stick around much, the lacing is sort of wispy and itself only sticks around long enough to be polite. Bright yellow liquid, shiny, vague orange tinting, not many visible bubbles, despite the shine sort of lifeless. The nose produces the expected notes of banana and bubblegum but then it veers into another realm with tar, black earth, tea leaf, farmland funk, more peppery than floral, pulped oranges, not much fruit, mainly white pit fruit, this puts the “farm” in farmhouse. Full-bodied, muscular and not willingly mobile, same sourness from muddy earth, metal, fallen leaves, quinine, dried pine sap. The citrus recedes and the fruit still refuses to step into the breach. Banana, leesy yeasts and flower water try to pretty it up but nothing is shaking off the funk. Which, in the end, is not a bad thing because it gives it a veneer of authenticity. Carbonation is nothing special, enough to give it a swirling effect. Hard not to characterize this as a “food beer” where when paired correctly any perception of lack will be filled by the dish. But not a casual sipper."
""
""
""
"O- Perfect dinner beer that can be paired with a lot of light dishes. Fish, pork, chicken and other foods that pair well with citrus."
"Taste is much the same, restrained yet bold with very well blended flavors and a very nice backing bitterness for balance. All the perfect flavors, dried fruits, spicy, dry, silky body with prickly yet light carbonation, love it"

"And this really is top banana: great stuff. Reading what I've written so far I'd expect it to be a sipper, but I went through the second and third half pints fairly quickly...."

"My first beer from these guys, I really liked it."
""
""
""
"Definitely an American take on the style."

"Poured from the bottle into a wineglass like glass. Yellow in color with medium amount of white bubbly head. Head receded fairly quickly with very little lacing. Smell was odd. Lemon, white wine and some vinegar. I began to think 'infection'. Taste was like lemon juice and nail polish. I'd heard from several people that nail polish would be very apparent when you get it, and sure enough, it was. First infected beer that I didn't realize was infected before I opened it. I have seen bacteria floating on the top of a beer before and just didn't open it. This was unfortunate. This was an extra from a trade, so it's not like I spent money on it; but I'd heard good things about this beer and still am for the next time I stumble upon one."
"Great company. Just found them around May 2013. I feel in love with their Triple and then their IPA. I tried this Farmhouse Ale as my first ever Farmhouse. I thought it was strong and tasty, just the way I like my beers. You could feel the beer after just one glass. After tasting this I want to try more Farmhouse Ales"

"Wonderful beer worthy of repeat and even stocking in the fridge.drink and repeat."
""
""
"Atmosphere, is pretty good. Nice hue, good head (and everybody likes good head), and some sporadic lacing. Nose is yeasty with some fruit components. Yeasty, slightly fruity, and hoppy. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
""
"Overall - Delicious, would like to try this from the source. Keep it up PTB&AP! Distribute to Florida!"

"Overall a decent saison but nothing special. It probably doesn't help that this beer is 2 years old (even though I just received it via online retailer last week) so I don't want to judge it too harshly. Just OK to good."
"Overall, not bad, but does not live up to the ratings. I would take any number of well-known and readily available saisons over this one."
""
""
""
"this didn't floor me like it should have. on tap at grace (the coolest restaurant ever) in downtown Portland. knew the hype, but I didn't know what to expect here. it pours a clearish, but still a little brackish pale straw color, with an inch of lasting white head. very alluring. the nose is not like a saison at all, maybe a little bretty, but im thinking this is more of a lager yeast, crisp and decidedly Czech in nature. it certainly is on the malt front, and the yeast profile matches. nothing farmhouse about this as far as the taste goes. balanced, complex, and delicious, but its like a well hopped lager. traditional. light on the mouth, good carbonation, clean finish. its not living up to the style at all, but the taste is darn good. an oddity to say the least, asks more than it answers, but a jovial beer to slam down in the summer time. first impression from pretty things is a good one overall."
"Overall: Nice saison, with good funk character and a nice hop presence. Something I’ve had many times, and will likely have again. A solid beer, and highly recommended."
"My first beer from Pretty Things and absolutely enjoyed this farmhouse ale on a hot summer evening. The nose is a little funky yeast with grass and hint of lemon. Poured excellent into the RR-tion glass with nice head retention. Taste was superb belgian yeast, pepper, and herbs all complement each other with light carbonation and a dry, crisp finish. I found myself wanting more after the bomber was empty. Jack D'or will be in my summer saison rotation."
""

""
""
""
""

"O - One of the best Saisons styles that I have had; Pretty Things nailed this. I got this in a trade and wish it was available in WI. Thank you Nick!"

"O: A very nice American saison. The fruitiness, spiciness, and herbal notes mesh very well and combine to make some great flavors. Very easy to drink, especially on a warm summer day. Good price point at under $6 for a bomber, so pick some up if you get PT in your area"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I very much enjoyed this beer and would certainly have another. Although for the price there are other beers out there that I would enjoy a bit more. A bit too much spice and the mouthfeel was not quite there for me."
""
"Overall, a really nice Saison, but it lacks complexity and the combination of sweet marmalade and floral hops doesn't seem to work well for my palate. I prefer more tartness. The hop character, however, is on the money. It is not overdone and does not leave the beer smelling and tasting like a mouthful of flowers. It's a very nice, drinkable Saison that unfortunately fails to land a spot on the list of beers in this style I'll seek again."
""
""
""
"I am a bit surprised at the really high rankings for this one. As Farmhouses go, it's not nearly in my top bracket. Medium carbonation and golden color but very little in the nose or taste without much depth. Crisp and a bit on the too dry side for me. Maybe some citrus hints but was lacking overall character."
""
"Smooth taste, with a nice feel and kick. Little afterbite, but still mellow. I highly recommend it! They feature this beer at the Miler's ale house in Watertown. Great atmosphere and great food to compliment the beer! Try it with the Zingers! Awesome combination!!!"

"Poured from a bomber into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, slightly hazed, heavily carbonated, golden-maize coloring with a tall, frothy, white, clingy head. Aromas of lemon peel, clove, and pepper on a biscuit backbone with some fruity highlights. Well balanced aromas. Flavors are roasty and spicy on the forward tongue, with a tart citrus backbone. All-spice, nutmeg, and grains of paradise, with tart lemon and grapefruit notes all blending together very well. Roasty overlays, with a tangy mouthfeel. The body is light, and remains crisp with the flavor profiles and the carbonation. Smooth, slightly filmy finish, with spicy lingerings. Very soild brew, and a great representation of the style."

"Appearance is ever-slightest hazy yellowish-straw colored, mild pure-white head nice fluffy lacing on the glass. Smell is banana and dried apricots, a little floral hop essence and perfumey. Tastes banana and heavy floral notes, spice level is well balanced with the hops and malt..clean and refreshing bubblegum flavor here, and a slightly crisp citrusy bitey finish, body is light. Overall a very well balanced American Saison, with a good display of yeast and hops.. Should be paired with delicate flavors such as uni, fresh oysters, seafood, scallops."

"22 ounce bottle, bottled March 2012. Served in a Unibroue tulip, the beer pours a cloudy gold color with an inch white head that stayed around for a while. There's also a good amount of lacing. The aroma is nice, the brew smells like cloves, yeast, oranges, and an overall earthy/spicy aroma that I can't really identify. It tastes like citrus/citrus peel, herbs/flowers, grainy/wheat malt, cloves, bubblegum and peppery spice. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit slick and easy to drink with a good amount of carbonation. I liked this brew, I'd certainly buy it again in the future. $7.49 a bottle."
""
""
""
""

""
"Poured a cloudy yellow/pale gold hue with great two-finger head that left lace patches. My first reaction to the smell is very fruity, as I pick up both orange/banana like citric notes as well as some pears or apples and something tropical. Also yeast, some sweetness (candi sugar or derived from fruits?) and touches of clove in the nose as well. Light-bodied and smooth, easy to drink and slightly creamy/filling, there is a balance and crispness thanks to the hops. As tasty as refreshing to drink, I pick up good amounts of fruit flavors ranging from citric to touches of plush tropical and there is a sweetness but also dryness to the beer, although I really can't say sour or funk. Just take my word that is a well-balanced beer with plenty of fruit flavors and dry/sweetness from malts and hops (and fruits?) so it's not overpowering or overpuckering one way or the other. My notes are scattered on this beer but I know I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend to anyone."
""
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: This beer is essentially the antithesis of what I like in a Saison/Farmhouse Ale; earthy, bitter, hop forward and lacking any sort of funk or yeast profile and the dry bitter finish really spoils it for me. I'm left wishing this beer was livelier, creamier with more vibrancy, hard to call this an enjoyable beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- a wonderful Saison. I served it on the warmer side- about 53F."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pale and slightly cloudy with a thin head, it looks nice but nothing remarkable. But the aroma is is fruity - maybe more like a rind than the fruit itself - and earthy with complex hops. The taste follows the same - beautifully balanced with acid, hops, must, fruit and tiny wonderful carbonation. Find it. Buy it. Be happy."

"O - I've had some other Pretty Things beers and this one is the best so far. I love the experimental nature of the brew; it combines styles that I am into in a very accomplished fashion. Must Drink More."
""
""
""
""
"Fairly complex example of the style. Good yeast character. Finish is a little dry and hot for my palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I like the use of a blend of yeasts. I like that this isn't sweet. I like how there's a spice flavor without the use of spice. All that said this isn't just not my idea of a beer, but it frankly isn't all that good. I like the idea, but the end result is an interesting but not enjoyable beer. I think people who like this style of beer well be rather happy with it, but if this isn't a style you really seek out this is an easy beer to pass on."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: wow so I was really impressed heard good things so being from mass I have pretty lights a try and damn this is one of the best saisons I've ever had. Worth a try if you can get your hands on it for sure"

"O: Very impressive beer. Pretty Things is one of my favorites from the East Coast that flies under the radar. I was able to snag the bomber for 2.99 which is a steal."
""
""
""
""
""
"D: pretty solid saison, i do wish it was a touch dryer than it is, but that is my only serious complaint. otherwise quite enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Quite a nice saison. The smell is the definite highlight, and the mouthfeel is really interesting. Surprisingly floral, with more nectar and petal flavor than I think I've ever encountered in a beer before (Upright Flora Rustica is the one that comes closest). Interesting."
""
""
" O: this is a really good beer, very well balanced, nice complexity, I really enjoyed the use of the hops here. Suprised it took me so long before i reviewed this one ."

"Very complex beer that melds together perfectly. Lots of mellow components that when combined create a layered and complex drink that's very tasty. Worth seeking out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Just a gorgeous beer from Pretty Things. I pick this up at every opportunity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: this was an awesome beer beat pretty things beer I've had so far they did a great job on this it was almost like a hybrid between a great funky earthy saison and a spice and yeast filled whitbier if you can get buy this beer"
""
"o -not really sure what to think about this. i feel that this beer is like calculus for your taste buds. amazingly complex, but not super drinkable. have to take this one sip at a time just to process what's going on here. i can see why it's so highly rated."
""
""
""
"O: A style-bender. Wonderful, if somewhat unrefined, though that very bitter back end is a big part of what makes this beer special. Boisterous. Archetypical of American beer in the 21st century. Great stuff."
""
""
"Easy to drink, very good saison."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dry, grainy, and with a good balance of citrus, herbs and bitter funk, this brew is quite enjoyable. The finish is long and bitter with a lingering citrus pith and berbs flavor. Wheat malt is subtle, but there. Great brew, this: dry and flavorful."
""
"Overall: a tasty and tongue-tickling saison. I'd definitely have this again, given the opportunity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"For a style that I can normally shy away from this is one I could certainly have again. Really like Pretty Things so far, can't wait to try Fluffy White Rabbits next."

"Enjoy this one, I would be surprised if you didnt."

"Poured into a brandy snifter. Pours cloudy golden with a white head. There are plentiful tiny bubbles rising in the beer from the bottom of the glass. Fruity esters hit the nose first. I detect orange and lemon most strongly. I can also detect some spice, which is likely coriander. There is also some bready malt in the smell. There is bitterness up front, which comes through very strongly on the first sip. The malt backbone comes through after the initial sip, providing bready flavor. There is some of that spiciness I detected in the nose, but it is not very prominent. Some of those citrus flavors start to come through after I get used to the bitterness and I pick up that orange and lemon, but that bitter aftertaste is still strong. The body is medium with strong carbonation. The finish is dry. The drinkability is high. This is a very good beer."
""
"If you're in need of a great saison, I'd go with Boulevard's Tank 7."
""
"a clean straw yellow pour with a half inch of head giving off some great lacing. smells of lemon zest, orange peel, coriander, bready/spicy yeast. a funky tasting saison. lots of citrus bitterness.. almost like eating a salad of orange peel and lemon peel.. with a dash of pepper, and a slice of bread on the side. really crisp and refreshing. high carbonation, light bodied.. perfect summer refresher. really diggin' this one.. tastes like a traditional book recipe, however still manages to have a unique bitterness that lets it stand out from the rest."
"O: a really nice saison, very drinkable, very summery"
"Where the value of saison is measured by its classic complexities of dry malt, dry fruit, high spice, and high effervescence, Jack D'or delivers all these with pin point Belgian precision. Its truly unique to find well made saisons outside of the farmhouse. It's only the goofy name and artwork that leaves a bad taste in my mouth."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I'd say this is a good beer but had too much hop bitterness and dryness for my liking."
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm grateful a current resident founded Pretty Things Beer & Ale Project."
""
""
""
"Jack D'Or is a brilliant, clear golden color, topped with a soapy head about 1 cm tall. It later recedes to a thin sliver, leaving a decent amount of lacing. The aroma is wonderfully complex... and pleasantly yeasty, of course. On one hand, I can pick up very sweet, candied phenols, and on the other, there is very sour and tart stuff in there as well. Apples and bananas come to mind first and foremost. The taste has a smack of sweetness and farmhouse funk, but in a flash that all gives way to a sour bitterness. There must have been a more than average amount of hops used here, for the style. It has a bit of a champagne-like character, being somewhat crisp, dry and metallic. Overall, an extremely interesting and high caliber Saison."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a very well-done saison. Nothing crazy or overdone to really set it apart, but definitely good."
"Notes: Very clean and interesting Saison. Not all that spicy or complex. I was getting a little too much of the asprin to fully enjoy it though. So so beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Wow, very nice take on the style and great price point (considering its a large format bottle). Excellent on a hot day."
""
""
"O: One of the best saisons I’ve had in a while. I had no problem finishing the entire 22 oz. here – hell, I’d be down for more if I had another bottle. There’s just something about a beer like this without any additives of candi sugar or spice…it’s naturally good, and that provides an unnaturally awesome experience."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Saisons were late bloomers for me, now I jump at every opportunity I can get to try new ones. This is exceptional."
""
""
"The mouthfeel is Jack D'Or's greatest strength. It's light, crisp, and dry. Wonderful. Overall, this is a good saison. Not great, but certainly quite good. I appreciate the earthy flavor profile. Now, I sat on this bottle for a year...had I known it was pretty well filtered I might have consumed it fresher. Maybe its better when its hops are at their freshest. If I get the chance to confirm it then I'll revisit this score. As is, it's still a top-notch saison."

"Beer is medium-bodied, with high enough levels of carbonation to lead to an initially crisp mouthfeel, after which the beer foams up on the palate and comes across as somewhat creamy. Finish is semi-dry."

"Overall - Nice, just not the flavors I'm looking for in a saison. The weight detracts as well."
"Overall: As a beer this is also a great drinker. I’m not usually a saison fan, but I am definitely a Saison Americaine fan. With a strong a complex flavoring, I would definitely suggest Jack D'Or."
"Overall this is an excellently balanced but intriguing saison. Love it, truly a treat to drink."
"Overall, I've had Jack D'Or before, but I forgot how good it was. I would definitely have this again. Cheers!"

"Overall. I had this a while back and found the bitter hops to be a bit too much. Hasn't really changed with some age. Still a nice beer, pretty unique."

"O: A very nice saison. Atypical, but enjoyably so. The American hops give it a nice added spiciness that works very well."

"Bottled in July 2011.Poured into a large tulip glass a hazed lemony color that becomes almost milky looking when the bottom chunkies and floaties get in there.a little barnyard and alot of lemony/citric hops in the nose,a little crushed wheat as well.Nice flavor complexity with light phenolic spice and toasty wheat mixed with quite a healthy shot of American- style citric hops,alot going on and it's refreshing to boot.A great Easter beer it has kind of a spring feel and flavor to it."

"O: Very refreshing and obviously well-crafted. Not as complex as I expected but interesting nonetheless."
"O- A damn good saison, very refreshing and flavorful, the spice is really great."
""
""
"Poured into a Black Raven pint glass. Pours a clear straw amber with a half finger fine head that is constatant replenished by active carbonation, looks nice. Aroma of light bready malt, lemon, slight saison funk. Nice wheat and lemon start, with bready malt and light fruit developing. Finish is hop bitterness with funky saison yeast lingering. This starts off tasting like a weizen, but quickly develops more sour, complex citrus leaning saison flavors. A nice flavor progression. Light bodied but a nice sharp mouth feel from the active carbonation. Very refreshing and pleasant to drink. Another great Pretty Things ale."
""
""
""
"O: A nice spring/summer beer that takes a different approach to a Saison, and it comes out distinctly American. Would buy again, but maybe not immediately..."
""
"Overall: I like Jack D'Or a lot. Saisons are not typically my thing but this is beer so well balanced with its bold flavours and clarifying spices that I find myself very impressed. In a couple of words: highly recommended."
"O: it was definitely a solid saison and liked the little hop profile it did have, glad I got to try this one."

"O: Nice complexity. Has some huge pear notes that couple great with the lemon and hay. Moderate bitterness and lighter funk notes set it apart from other Saisons. Very refreshing and surprisingly juicy."
""
"O - Very good saison with a funky dry taste and an excellent feel. I first had this beer on draft but I think I prefer it out of the bottle. It is inexpensive and readily available. Saison is my favorite style and Pretty Things brews a good one in Jack D'or. I wish more breweries made an easy to get year round saison of this quality."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this was a quality brew. Definetely was all over the place in terms of smell and taste - which is what I look for in a Saison. Definetely would like to try this on tap."
"A certain winner for a lazy, warm spring day. Jack D’Or could replace white wine for casual occasions."
""
""
""
"Overall (4.0): This saison is a treat in a lot of ways. It’s light, it’s drinkable, it’s got enough going on to hold its own against heavy, rich food, and it’s got such a dry finish you don’t want to put it down. This would be a perfect candidate for some format other than bombers, though I’d have no trouble finishing one by myself."
""
""
""
"Overall, Damn this makes me want to be a better brewer. Great beer. I wish I could buy it in 6 packs, 12 packs, kegs. This is the beer that could convert those curious macro drinkers to craft....if it weren't so damn hard to get. For me anyway."

"Gold and clear in appearance. Smell is very aromatic. Smell is clean, with some floral hints. This is a well crafted beer, nice job Dann and Martha. Mouthfeel is clean and the taste is exceptional. Overall this is a very nicely brewed beer. We found this to sit well in the glass with real nice foam. Fridge worthy."

"O- I liked it beyond any other beer I've had in its type."

"O – Overall I really liked this beer a lot of hop bitterness upfront then mellows to that familiar saison on the backend. I am glad I have another bottle to enjoy!"
""
""
"M - Smooth and incredibly easy to drink. A sign of good beers to come from Pretty Things."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a very well put together Saison. I really like the complexity in the aroma and the flavor profile. If there was a bit less horse blanket character, it might allow the rest of the flavors to dance around a little more in balance. I think the mouthfeel could be improved a bit too, but all in all this is one of my favorites to have around."
""
""
"A decent and hoppy Saison. Not very smooth or balanced, but interesting."
""
"D - This is an interesting saison, very spicy, musty and peppery. I generally prefer saisons that lean more towards a fruity character, but the herbal, earthy character works well here and it really brings out the underlying wheat notes that might otherwise get lost in a fruitier example of the style."

"Discovered at the Beacon Grille in Woburn, MA this shows a brilliant yellow gold color served in a Pretty Things giant chalice. It includes a healthy white foam cap with solid lacing. The aroma is a delicious wheat banana blend with some subtle spice notes. Very refined. The flavor offers a grainy potpourri blended effortlessly with apple-banana and pear. A velvety smooth feel with a solidly medium body. This is very special and something not to miss, especially on tap! Beautiful."

"Overall - With saisons and wild ales as my beverages of choice I was excited to try this, yet came away a little disappointed. I'll let the other bottle I picked up age a while and see if the metallic tastes were a fluke. It does get better after the first half is finished but doesn't excite the palate like I'm more accustomed to."
"What a flavorful, tasty beer. Other than Saison DuPont, I don't think I've ever had such a funky, spicy dry farmhouse ale. Very well balanced, the meld of flavors work so nicely together, you can't help but say a silent thank you to Jack. Though he may be mournful, he certainly has made me happier this evening."
"O-Nice and easy to drink but was expecting way more cheers."
"Medium body mouthfeel with a nice crisp and dry texture. Overall, Jack D'Or presents you with a true American saison, hoppy but with a nice saison yeast flavorto round it out."
"Pour very pale yellow with a slight haze and a bright white finger head. The scent is light and slightly citrusy, or is that the lemon on the label confusing me? (The brewers have taken time to note on twitter there is no citrus in the batch). The flavor is pleasant, drying on the finish. There's a slight catch in the back of my throat from this, a touch astringent, almost a small bitterness."
"Pours a hazy golden to straw yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, dry yeast, spices, and a note of fruitiness. In the taste, dry yeastiness, fruity, and just a note of tartness. A spice bite and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry spice and yeastiness in the aftertaste. Nice representation of style, a nice tartness and spice all the way through."
"Overall: very enjoyable saison. Easy to quaff and is nicely refreshing. Definitely worth seeking this beer out."
"Started out looking great and smelling good, but the flavor let me down a bit, mostly from the aftertaste."
"This is an accomplishment. Truly one of the most sessionable Saisons out there, but also one of the most flavorful, and certainly one of the most multifaceted and unexpected. Hearty recommendations."
"I hope to try more from this brewery but don't think I'll buy this one again."
"Overall a great saison. Personally would prefer it to be a little less hop forward, but I'll take it none the less. This is my first pretty things beer and I'm looking forward to trying more."
"Pours a clear golden color with a nice white head that falls quickly without leaving much lacing behind. The nose carries a bit of fruit and light grain. Faint spice. The flavor is grainy and too dry. Excessive bitterness for the flavor, as there's not much there to back it up. Mildly tannic and thin. Good carbonation. Decent, but not something I'd go back to. Too much bitterness without any real saison flavor to balance it out."
"Solid Saison. Of course I am biased because of the local flair. Nice pour, great retention. Smell and taste are not bad. Haved many Saisons and this is still one of my faves. Good take, worth trying. This is definetly not a Bouelevard Saison, but a good brew."
"Overall - I was very impressed with this, i would love to have a case of this laying around for when i want a nice refreshing beer other than an IPA"
"Cheers!"
"Half finger white head, quick dissipation with not much lacing. Hazy deep gold body, hard to detect any visible carbonation. Huge coriander presence in the nose, not much in the way of fruity esters, some spicy hops in back end. Taste is very, very coriander/peppery, out of balance for style, even after lengthy warming the lemony fruit esters were subsumed by coriander presence, healthy dose of belgian yeast. Mouthfeel about right, on the light side of medium, pretty good effervescence, dry finish. Need to dial the coriander notes back. Not real drinkable, just to frickin' peppery IMHO."
"Looks like a saison, smells like a saison, tastes like an American saison. Hops are a little more forward then I like in a saison. The style is so difficult to nail down though because it varies so much. This on reminds me more of the St. Feuillien as I sip further the hop does start to give way to the barnyard covered in citrus that I do love so much. A very tasty one when I want a little more hops. Got it in Salem for $6.50, great at that price! Too bad I can't get it in Maine. I will have it again. Stoked to try their others beers."
"If I could give bonus points for the awesomely goofy brewer-made artwork and description, I would. It added a very cool character to the beer."
"Overall: I drink this beer very often whether in a bottle or on tap. Let's say Jack and I are really good friends. One of my favorite saisons out there. Plenty more to have, but this is an easy choice for me."
"Pours a murky yellow into the glass with very little white head that dies down quickly. Little lacing left on the glass while I drank the beer. Really love the smell of this beer and that was the standout here for me. Primarily a funky barnyard sourness along with a little bit of lemony sweetness. Taste was big on hop bitterness with a little bit of the citrus from the smell at the end. I was really looking for a little more of the smell in the taste but felt the hoppiness kind of overtook everything else (granted, I am not a big hop head). Mouthfeel was nice but nothing to write home about, decent prickly carbonation and pretty smooth. My girlfriend found it ""a little like a hoppy Allagash White," I kind of agree with her. She put a lemon in her glass. I did not. Overall not all that bad but just not quite what I was looking for here. I think there is more going on with this beer that I just wasn't able to pick up because of the big hoppy bitterness."
"A good saison, nothing groundbreaking, but solid. On tap at Bruery Provisions."
"Fragrant, heady light golden beer. Quite a slash of hops. Very appealing at first sip but in the end the bitterness is more than the delicate flavors can sustain. Pleasant citrus taste and acidity with an earthy nose. Fresh cut apple and a touch of something like artichoke. Toasted brioche and white grapes. Nice head in the tulip glass but the carbonation fades before two people can share the 22-ouncer. I will still buy whatever these people concoct, though so far this is my least favorite."
"Overall: Thanks much to Jlindros for this bottle. I'd had this once before in a trade, though there was no date on that bottle, and I was greatly disappointed by it. This, on the other hand, is quite nice. I'm typically not a huge fan of American-style saisons (tons of American hops or high levels of bitterness, for example), preferring the more earthy, funky, and fruity versions. This, however, is pretty tasty. The lemon curd flavors, nice hint of malt, and somewhat herbal, leafy hops meld well together. I have no idea what this costs (as it's not available here), but if it went for around 7-8 dollars I could see myself picking up a few bombers of this for warm weather sipping."
"Pours a vibrant, hazy, pale straw color with a thin layer of bubbly, pure-white head. The head dissipates very quickly, and leaves tiny batches of wet lacing behind. It smells of funky yeast, straw, hay, freshly-cut grass, pepper, and light citrus notes. It tastes very similar, beginning with the straw, grass, and citrus (lemon, orange) notes, moving into a funky, yeast flavor, and finishing with the peppery hops. There seems, however, to be a slightly metallic, medicinal flavor that predominates the finish and leaves an odd taste in the mouth. Mouthfeel is very crisp and finishes cleanly. Overall, a good saison save for the odd flavor towards the end."
"O- This is a very enjoyable Saison and I would definitely seek it out again. The pepper is a little bit over powering, I feel that this could be even better if there was not so much pepper. I can't wait to have more."
"The nose is just splendid. Basil, thyme, citrus, and an Indian summer grassiness that morphs as you drink. Certainly unique, and in my opinion, exceptionally robust. Once you take a drink, you'll notice a bit less bubbles than you expected, but give it a swish and I guaran-dang-tee you'll enjoy how this one excites palate. Give it a chew, why don't you? The taste is fantastic, just as your nose hinted. You've got some earthiness, but mostly a bright citrus taste that's just ready to burst. Can't wait to have more of their brews."
"They label the bombers with bottled stickers. Get one fresh and drink it up before the weather gets too cold!"
"Overall it's a nice fun beer. Alot going on. Light and fresh. Wide range of notes and flavors. Good summer drinkability."
"Overall a very good example of the style, if not a little dear."
"O- definitely not your typical saison, but a great American take on it. One of my favorite saisons, and relatively available on the east coast."
"O - Very muted and mild flavors."
"Overall: A decent saison, but not my favorite by any means."
"Overall not as interesting or complex as I'd have hoped. The bitterness really outshines the other subtler flavor aspects of this beer. Didn't really excite me too much. Kind of one-note."
"Very fresh and aromatic with aromas of citrus, spice tones with some malts and grain tones as well. Medium bodied with a real good feel. This is a really good domestic saison that plays to a more citrusy side"
"Overall - Definitely fits the farmhouse style. Very drinkable and perfect on a cool summer night."
"This is a classic (if that's even possible) example of an American saison. Hoppy, dry and downright delicious."
"A pleasant Saison, but it didn't blow my hair back. I don't think I'll ever be inclined to get it again with more preferable options in the same price range, but def worth a try if you haven't yet."
"Poured from a bottle into a tulip. Pours a cloudy golden color with little to no foam. It looks vibrant, smells every bit as dynamic. A wonderful, pronounced yeasty aroma. There’s a bit of a spicy bite in the taste. A hoppy saison, but dramatically different from the only other hoppy saison I’ve tried. There’s a dry finish to this beer, distinct and bold. Going out on a limb here but I think I catch some coriander as well? Thick mouthfeel. Enjoyed it as it warmed and released more of that wonderful aroma. Bit of an acidic finish towards the end, but not off-putting. I’d definitely pick this one up again."
"overall, off the pour and first smell, i wasnt expecting much, but wow, i was a little surprised. now i see why its called a ""saison americaine""- a solid saison with a nice hop presense, maybe american hops, not sure. very smooth, and dangerously drinkable. definatly an affordable price tag as well, something worth revisiting."
"A really drinkable beer where what is lacking in flavour adds up to genuine quaffability. Plus, it's intriguing enough for it not to be a flop."
"Notes: Nothing mind-blowing here, and I'm not sure the extreme hype is deserved, but so far all I've tried from Pretty Things feels like solid stimulating quality so what is not to like?"
"Overall is really good and I would love to try this again for sure."
"There seems to be a certain woodsy quality in the nose, joining (blunting?) muted presences of yeast and spices. A touch of funk. Tastes more lively, although the thickish body seems to bog things down a bit. The hop bitterness seems to cut through the body more effectively than the spices (cloves, allspice, white pepper) or tanginess (sweetened lemon, yeast, a vague sour presence). Modest funkiness develops as it warms. I’d love to see some more of the earthy and spicy notes coaxed out of this. Compared to upper-tier saisons, Jack D’Or is somewhat lacking in ‘oomph’, but pretty tasty and worth a try."
"O: Token example of this style for sure. I will be seeking out lots more from Pretty Things now that they are readily available in my area."
"O: A good Saison. I didn't know Pretty Things was distributing here, so am jumped on it. Doubt I will see it on tap again, but I would give it another shot."
"Bomber poured into my Saison Dupont glass. Opaque straw color - almost milky - with a coif of white foam that settles back into more of a combover. Aroma is bright, alternatingly fruity and musty. Citrus peel and soggy hay, candied orange and cobwebs, honey, fresh laundry. The flavor seems restrained at first, like there's something vivid struggling to get out, but it's truncated by a mineral character that approaches astringency. Still, a mild unripe mango fruitiness is detectable along with some dry pale malts and leafy noble hops with a clean peppery finish. I was hoping this would come out of its shell with warmth but no such luck. The only development I get is a more lingering astringency and a little more sweetness. Palate is also a bit off. The carbonation is inappropriately low, giving this beer a soft but unsatisfying mouthfeel. Not bad but I'd say this needs some fine-tuning."
"A good non-Belgian saison, but far from my favourite. It feels like it paints the broad strokes of the style well, but misses the little details. It doesn't have a true complexity, it doesn't have the acidity and it doesn't have the interesting organic funk of a great example. And that's a bit of a shame."
"T: I get lemon rind, orange zest, dry champagne yeast and a little sage. The finish is super bitter with a big hit of something that tastes like aspirin. Not the most pleasant finish. This loses points for me solely on that. The rest of the beer is solid."
"O: This one seemed to be a bit of a let down. The bitterness sort of killed off any chance the flavors had to mesh."
"Notes: Just enough American hops to make things interesting and add to the complexity. Great beer."
"O - Glad I tried this one, but probably wont pick this up again."
"Overall - A very unique beer. Extremely well balanced and yet still complex and flavorful enough to be interesting. It's not overwhelming though either, and is still refreshing and easy to drink."
"A pretty good saison. easy to drink and enjoyable. I'd probably buy it again."
"Overall, this is an interesting beer, especially considering the tripartite nature of the mouthful as the flavors change. True, the combination is a bit strange, and did leave me wondering what I was drinking, but the result was immensely flavorful, and worth a try."
"22 ounce bottle into wine glass, batch 25, bottled May 2011. Pours hazy golden amber color with a 1 finger foamy white head with decent retention that reduces to a small lacing ring. Some lacing on the glass as well. Aromas of lemon, grass, pepper, spice, a bit of funkiness and hay as well. Pretty nice and standard saison aromas here. Taste of big pepper, grass, spices, lemon, and a bit of funk as well. Some lingering notes of spice, lemon, and grass on the finish that linger for a bit. Medium carbonation and body. No alcohol noticed in the taste or finish. Overall, an excellent well made saison, with great drinkability and tons of flavor!"
"Overall, this is a decent beer. Pretty drinkable & body is on the light side to maybe a medium. Not delicious though. Prosit."
"Overall, I'd like to get more - a lot more. For generally being a porter/stout guy, I really enjoyed this. Ship some to WI...I'll be waiting."
"O/D - I haven't had many Saisons but I would venture to guess this is one of the hoppiest. I'm a fan of strong hop flavor so I thoroughly enjoyed this one."
"O: Really Really quality ale from Pretty Things, they continue to impress. A great beer for a hot summer night on the porch. Highly recommended."
"Sightly hazy with massive carbonation bright golden color and a three finger white head that sticks around forever. Smells floral and rustic. Yeasty and bready as well. The tastes follows the nose, but with a lot more complexity. Floral, fruity, and spice. White peppercorns, dry rustic bread like yeasty notes, hints of apple, and husky malt. Also, the finish is really hoppy, bitter and citrusy for a saison. Mouthfeel is dry with loads of carbonation. Medium bodied. Smooth and slighty rustic, very dry. A really nice and refreshing saison. Glad these guys are finally getting distributed out west. A really solid brewery from eery thing I have tried so far."
"The beer was bottled in May 2011, batch 26, and was tasted on 13 Jul 2011."
"I like this beer. It is a bit heavy on the banana, but I don't mind that. I would definitely drink this one again."
"O: A very servicable saison, above average, but not the standout I expected. Still a nice brew, but a bit overpriced."
"O: This is a pretty beer that tastes and smells very refined, but is not what I typically expect from a saison. However this would be a good beer to convert wine drinkers to craft beer."
"O - Just a very, very good saison from the folks over at Pretty Things. You're really hard pressed to find a bad brew from these guys. This, like most others, are a definate ""must buy""."
"O - This had good drinkability. It goes down easy and the flavor is very nice. Overall, I think this is a really good saison, and just a really good beer in General. I think it has just the right amount of bitterness to it. It's a great beer to enjoy on a warm day. I recommend trying it."
"D- Hops maybe overwhelm slightly on the palate with the fruity esters not as up front as i would like. Nevertheless a nice summer thirst quencher!"
" Overall something maybe up with this Still not really bad,I would like to try this fresh.I always hear great things about this beer."
"O: A top notch American saison. Extremely flavorful yet easy to drink and goes down smooth on a hot summer day."
"Even for a saison, Jack D'or is very dry. IT starts of rustic and somewhat sweet, and about midway those flavors go way and in comes the bitterness and dryness that seem to last. Perhaps a bit too bitter at times though, however that isn't enough to keep me away from this beer."
"Overall, I really wanted to like this - but that end/after-taste of pepper & more pepper turned me off."
"O- Interesting take on a saison, not what I expected but not a disappointment either. The 6.4% ABV is well hidden and if you like the tartness you could session this one. Unusual enough that I’ll seek out other beers from this brewery."
"O- This is a really nice beer, extremely drinkable and very pleasant. The perfect beer to enjoy on your deck on a June afternoon."
"O - this is one damn fine take on a saison. one of my favorite interpretations and definitely worth picking up. not many beers beat this on a warm summer day."
"O - Pretty impressive and interesting saison. My first try from Pretty Things, and it is worth seeking out again."
"D- although groundbreak and cynic ale definitely top jack, the dry flavors create a very drinkable saison. I recommend this and will grab more"
"Overall: A great summer beer that i would try again. Enjoyable."
"O - I was hoping for more 'funk'. An average saison but nothing that really stands out; a touch heavy on the pepper and lemon. I am really wanting to like PT brews but so far they just haven't wow'd me. I have a few more to try and would like to get my hands on a Finest Regards."
"I didn't catch how old this bottle was, so I will definitely try to get my hands on a fresh bottle sometime to revisit this beer."
"O- Pretty nice saison here. Rustic. Reasonable abv. Just a tad heavy on the pepperiness. Great summer brew. Its a great beer for sure in general. I might seek this one out again."
"Dirtybeerguy.com"
"Brings a lot of nice flavors to the table without any of them being too out of hand, a nice balance. Drinks easily and would be a nice Saison to introduce people to the style."
"Overall: This beer has a lot to offer. What it lacks in smell it makes up in appearance and ever moreso, taste. I would love to try this one fresh from the tap one day."
"I WANT MORE! And at a ""mere"" 6.4% I can probably have another. And another. My only fear is that this is so good I may not know when to stop. Fortunately (or unfortunately, rather!) I only had the one bottle to enjoy!"
"O: This beer is fantastic. It is easy to drink, refreshing and tasty."
"O/D-I had been putting off trying this brew for a while. I would love to grab a few of these here and there...especially for the summer. Great brew, Pretty Things is a nice brewery. I cannot decide, do I like this or American Darling more?? Right now, with a cool glass of Jack D'or next to me, I gotta say I'm going with Jack."
"A deep gold to pale amber color and cloudy (it is unfiltered). The brew was positively glowing and radiant in the sunlight. A generous three finger head; white and frothy and left complex lacing just above the finish. The appearance was really quite sublime. The aroma was complex. Yeasty with peppery phenols, slight malt and a whiff of orange peels. Taste was subtly citric with medium spice and bitterness. Hops were clean/crisp and the malts toasty. Felt creamy with a medium body, yet very drinkable. This brew was enjoyed on a roof-deck during a beautiful 70°, sunny afternoon and is perfect for such an occasion."
"OVERALL GRADE: C-/D"
"I like saisons but this one was mediocre."
"O- My first Pretty Things brew did not disappoint. A very solid Saison that I need to get more of to cellar for a while, as I feel like it could dry out and be a better beer."
"This is a light, easy-to-drink beer and while its not the best farmhouse I've had, it's a good version of the style with some unique tastes. Overall, I enjoyed it and I would probably drink again."
"Had a sample of this on tap at the 2010 ACBF. I tried a bunch of Pretty Things that day including this one. The look of the beer is nice, strong hazy golden body with a decent white head on it. The aromas were hard to pick up for some reason that day on this beer. It was mostly a little funky with some wheat and some citrus in there perhaps. The taste was kind of light to me as well. I felt like I wasn't able to pull anything from this brew. There were some flavors that resembled the style well. I did pick up the farmhouse taste with some wheat and citrus in there with just a bit of tartiness. The mouthfeel was good I thought. I really sure buy and bottle and check this one out again."
"Overall pretty good, a bit heavy overall on the flavors from what I usually like for saisons, but it's still a great saison. Spices a bit too high, hops are added well, nice wheat flavors and fruits, all blended well, and nice dry finish."
"o: not a bad beer, just not too impressive to me."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"Overall it's pretty nice. It's quite complex for such a light feeling beer, and still tasty."
"Very nice thick foam that lasts throughout the session. Hazy color, light golden. Really nice aroma, bananna, great Belgian yeast character, no sulfur. The mouthfeel is amazing, makes the beer seem to have so much body, but still finish so dry. Some hop character, some lingering bitterness."
"First sip was crisp and refreshing. Half way through and I am pondering how this simple beer tastes more complex and bright with each sip. First taste from this Project (& first review on BA) and definitely need to explore their other offerings. Highly recommend this one."
"This one is all about the light fruits and the yeast. Pears and apples are the first thing on my mind as i smell and sip this, A citrus hint comes into play too,only kinda dry but this bottle is only 5 months old, i think i might let the other 3 sit a bit and see if they get dryer, i think that is what this one needs."
"O – Another fine beer by Pretty Things. It’s a complex brew with some really good things going for it. I however don’t really care for the peppery and bitter finish which seems to take away from the overall taste of it."
"O-An interesting beer, not one of my favorites by I enjoyed sampling it. The wheat/yeast for my taste is a little overpowering but worth sampling, not a beer that I could drink more than one of at a time."
"Overall: Easy to drink beer that's light. Maybe a little too grassy... But it does go well with Spicy food like Indian curries."

"O: Fairly drinkable, but a bit drier than is my preference."
"I'm impressed. This is a very, very good example of the style. Easy to drink, easy to enjoy and in the spirit of what a saison is supposed to embody (think light, flavorful and perfect for a seasonal endeavour)."
"Overall just a well done and enjoyable saison. While it may not be anything too fancy, it is what I think of when I think of a saison."
"O-Really great. One of the best I've had from Pretty Things."
"Moutfeel is very nice, crisp but retaining a nice smooth finish. A very easy to drink beer that packs a lot of flavor into a relatively light body. One of the most enjoyable saisons i've ever had and one to seek out particularly if you more enjoy clean, less ""funky"" saisons."
"Drink- A very good craft saison. A little funk, sweet, and delictate citrus. I paired this with a MahiMahi filet for Easter and was very good."
"O- Really enjoyed this one. To me this is what a Saison should taste like. Highly recommended."
"A very unique and drinkable beer."
"Pours an unfiltered golden yellow, finger of dense creamy head. Leaves a collar, mild lacing and retention. Nose holds lots of dry bread notes, wheat, bright citrus, lemongrass-iness. Hopped nicely, very American take on the style. Some banana and phenolic notes that feel a bit out of place but smells great integrated with this. Taste has the wheat, lemon and citrus, mouthfeel gets dry real quick and adds some spice in the finish. Great mouthfeel, dry and refreshing. Summer day perfection. Impressive and an interesting American take on the style."
"D/O: This saison is a predictable American-brewed example in some respects, comparable to the Bruery's Saison Rue or Lost Abbey's Red Barn. The composed flavor profile comes across as superior to most, making this beer resonate in the memory as a really strong example of the style."
"D - Very easy to drink. Nice presentation!"
"O - It's a decent brew, but nothing I'd go crazy for. It's a good representation of the style without going too extreme with extra flavors. It's good to support small breweries, and it's easy to do so at the current price point. Was able to get many Pretty Things bombers for about $6 each."
"Pours a slightly cloudy golden color with a quicly diminishing white head that leaves some lacing. Slighty funky aroma with lemon, hay, and yeast. Taste has good hop bitterness up front along with citrus, spices, honey and bread. Medium bodied. This is well-balanced and has good complexity. Extremly easy to drink, this is a great beer."
"Drinkability – This is a unique saison that does not play it safe. A definite success for Pretty Things, as they have crafted one heck of an American saison."
"Pours a cloudy gold with a nice pillow of white on top, smells of spice.. clove and lavender, bready malt and yeast. Taste is peppery, slightly tart, herbal esters and faint hops. yeast is very present in the finish and the mouthfeel. slightly chalky and tannic. Dry. It represents the style well although not my favorite saison, good but not great IMHO"
"O- A fantastic drinking Saison! Well Done! Light and refreshing, yet full bodied enough to match with many foods. I'm thinking grilled shrimp/lemon kabobs with chipotle/honey polenta... and a baby greens salad with a grapefruit/honey vinegrette! Fire up the grill!!!"
"Pours a clear and very pale yellow-orange with a 1 inch off-white head that fades to a small cap. Decent rings of lace on the drink down. Smells of Belgian yeast, spices, citrus hops, and maybe some wheat. Taste is exactly like the smell with the Belgian yeast coming out the most. The smell and taste remind me very much of a wit beer. Mouthfeel is very prickly and bubbly on the palate. Overall, a good beer but it's not really my cup of tea. I am glad I got to try it though and I was surprised to see it at a local shop."
"D: Good overall to me, nothing earth shattering though."
"D - Very drinkable. Dry mouthfeel is really great. A bit different than an average saison, but well balanced and very enjoyable."
"Bottled Nov 2009, batch 10. Pours a hazy golden blonde with clear lacing. Small, white head. Aroma dominated by bubble gum, some sweet malt, mild hops and kumquat? Taste is dominated by vinegar like, sour and maybe unripe honeydew. Really not very pleasing. I recognize an American interpretation of a saison should have a bit of funk but I doubt this is the taste they were going for. Should this beer have fallen apart in 1.5 years? Even at only 6.4% abv, this should have held up. I just want to move on and get this taste out of my mouth. A friend shared this with me, it had a $1.49 sticker on it, maybe it was marked down because of its age?"
"Bright and golden yellow faint orange hint. Not a lot of head but a good amount of lacing around the rim. A lot of bubbles coming up. Instantly got a lot of aroma just from cracking the cap. Smell is very spicy and zesty. Coriander, Belgian yeast and banana. A faint amount of a hoppy citrus zest. For the lack of hops in the nose there is a lot going on here. The bitterness and dryness is very present. A dirty, extremely astringent hop character is very present with a fierce lemon zest. The Belgian yeast characteristics are there at first but are taken over by the bitter hop assault. Almost sour. Not sure how to interpret this one."
"Lighter medium body, higher carbonation, dry and lingering on the palate. Quality flavor, refreshing profile, and something I'd drink again."
"Overall very enjoyable. A bit different than other saisons I've had. More malt and hop focused, but still with a nice yeast backing."
"D-a little too hoppy for me, but all the elements come together nicely. Another well made beer by Pretty Things"
"Great light body and crisp feeling. This one is super drinkable. This is one of my favorites."
"Retasted on 7/3/11, considerably worse than the first time i had it. Flavors were completely muddled, the abv oddly started showing and it almost gained a wine corked wet cardboard taste. I didnt change the score as i felt it doesnt deserve to be changed, but after a few months this is showing very poorly, maybe i just dont get jack dor."
"Great drinkability and great pairing with really creamy buttery cheeses"
"Bottled February 2011. So excited to try this one! I've heard great things about Pretty Things and never seen it in California, until today! Pours a very beautiful, bright, almost clear golden-yellow color with a small white head that disappears extremely quickly. Scent is very funky with some lemon zest and peppery notes. I also get a bit of bread and hoppiness with nice yeast scents. Taste is initially hoppy, quickly followed by some funk and delicious spiciness. This is a very good example of a saison if you ask me. There is a bit of lemon and citrus along with a lot of hoppiness. Very tasty brew. Mouthfeel is nice and dry...refreshing. Overall, my first impression of Pretty Things is a good one. I can't wait to try more from this brewery."
"Nose is primarily yeast and the mouthfeel is balanced yeast and hop. The flavor profile, besides yeast and light hop, tastes of citrus, and is quite refreshing. This is particularly complex for a farmhouse ale and keeps you thinking about it long after you finish enjoying it."
"O: very complex beer. the bitter aftertaste is offputting for me personally, though many hopheads will rejoice."
"It's a very well-made brew! Lots of creativity involved with this Saison Americain!"
"Pale golden hazy yellow in color with a nice white finger of head. aroma is slightly faint, with some yeast spice and some clove. Taste is nice and spicy lightly hoppy yeasty and bread y. Feel is lighter in body, crisp smooth, clean and with a hint of creamyness. Drink is great and very easy to put away. One of my top ten saisons...on a short list."
"drinkability is good. nice balance. good depth. neat hoppy character. not your typical saison, but i like it!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with with low to medium carbonation, a little chewy. Good example of an American saison, light on the funk, bigger on the hops, but nice character and very refreshing, Thanks Russ!"
"-Cheers"
"Highly drinkable saison with nice dry tart flavors. I love this beer!"
"Note: Batch 22, Bottled February 2011"
"Drinkability: Love some Pretty Things...they never steer me wrong...just wish I was closer to their distribution area."
"Thanks again, Evan for giving me the chance to try this brew."
"Pours a pale bright golden colour, Minimal white head, slight lace on the glass. Smell is yeasty, lemony, citrus, hay, green apple, very vibrant and fresh, nice slight hop profile as well, very inviting nose no complaints here. Taste is tart but dry, light sourness, lemony, their is an earth hop presence, green apple and a dry yeasty finish similar to champagne. Good aggressive carbonation, nice weight, good feeling in cheeks and mouth. Drinks very nicely, perhaps slightly too much dry yeastiness, good overall and would certainly pick this one up again."
"D - At 6.5%, this beer packs a ton of flavor, and it is incredibly refreshing. If I see it around on clearance again, I'll buy as much as I can."
"D: Wouldn't bother drinking this again, esp for $8 a bomber."
"Drinkability is good. This is an easy saison to keep coming back to and Pretty Things does a great job with the lemon flavors, which also sets this saison apart from the norm. Worth picking up a bottle or two."
"Pours a bright foggy yellow with a big 2 finger head in my Duvel glass, head takes a good amount of time to recede with decent lacing all around the glass. The smells that come through up front are of peppercorns, light bubblegum and little to no hop recognition, but upon tasting i realize that there is a hop presence here that shows through very well without getting in the way of that awesome yeast character. This beer is smooth with a good crisp carbonation bite that makes it refreshing all around, i would drink this all day if they distributed to Oregon..."
"Holy cow! Wow! What a great brew. Enjoyed one of these with with my BA Buddy, y2korey, who brought one of these down for me from New York. This Saison starts with a nice deep, hazy golden color and has a nice, light nose. The taste is amazing and very complex, so that it hits your taste buds in all the right places. Excellent mouthfeel and drinkability. Mmm..."
"D: can you say 6 pack? would love to session this one"
"The is a very drinkable beverage. It is one of the drier Saisons that I have had, but is pretty well balanced and tasty. I think it is a really swell example of the style and it held up well with a little age on it."
"D - The bitterness ramps up pretty hard on your palate. A shame too, I really enjoyed the rest of the profile."
"Appearance is orange, golden with a two finger head initially. Smell has yeast, citrus zest, spices such as pepper too. Taking a sip of this farmhouse style from Pretty Things, it tastes candied with yeast and some hops in the finish. MF is medium with some good carbonation. This beer drinks easily and is a very good saison."
"I would certainly drink this again. An excellent bomber from a very good trade."
"Drinkability: Very refreshing and delicious, but the bitterness might prohibit sessionability."
"Eh, not bad, but a weird mix of flavors...the Belgian side is nice and is strong but it'd be better if they toned down the hops alot, or just left it a regular saison. Or at least got rid of the weird ultra-lemon/medicinal/cleaning product aspect."
"Drinkability-> Really took me by surprise at first with the sharpness and bitterness and the bready, wheat-esque aromas. This beer is quite unique to anything I have had or enjoy regularly. Can't believe it took me this long to try it but now that I am living back in the area year-round I am getting to drink local a lot more often! Definitely worth trying and I would have it again."
"D: Great, a very very well made Saison. One of the best to come out of the USA by far."
"This is really pale straw in color with a white foam. The aroma is a bready, lemony, tart aroma. The flavor is strongly of lemon zest. A lemon tart biscuit flavor is pretty much the only way to explain this beer. It's good for a saison, but it's really odd. Strong lemon flavor makes this beer seem still rather one dimensional. This is a good drinking beer."
"""Jack d'Ov"" has been popped. Don't ask. It pours a hazy pale straw topped by a finger or so of white micro-foam. The nose comprises wheat, lemongrass, coriander, orange peel flesh, lemon zest, and black pepper. The taste holds notes of sharp lemon, lemon peel, orange peel, coriander, light blanket, and sharply bitter flowers and greens. The bitterness here near the end is a bit too sharp for my liking. The body is a hefty-feeling light, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a pretty nice saison, though that finish is not a friend of mine."
"Personally, I'd rather reach for a lot of other things, but I can say that this one is nicely drinkable. It's quite nicely balanced and at only 6.50%abv it won't hit you in the head with it's alcohol."
"D: Very enjoyable, glad I tried it. A good hoppy example of the style."
"D: Could drink these all day."
"Not sure I'd grab this next time with huge enthusiasm."
"notes: not at all what I was expecting. Absolutely delicious and I cannot wait to have another. One of the best and most impressive beers Ive had lately."
"A fairly good saison if not something I'd go out of my way to have again."
"For me, this is a first taste from this brewery. Served in a standard pint glass with a finger of fluffy white head. Bronze in color and a bit cloudy. Sharp, fresh nose with fruity, floral and spicy aromas. Palate is impressive. Complex layers of flavors. Apple, orange, banana, coriander, sourdough and a touch of peppery hop flavor. Mouthfeel is fluid and crisp on the tongue. Incredible drinkability from start to finish. Awesome take on the saison style. A must try."
"Drinkability: I like this one a lot. It would be a very good warm weather beer and I will probably search it out again some time. I would have rated the taste higher with a little less alcohol and bitterness at the end, but that's just nitpicking, quite good."
"o- The beer really is a good one and my first from the pretty things brewery. To me this beer seemed to be missing something. It was good overall but it is missing something that I expect from saisons and I cant put my finger on it."
"Bottle: Poured a bright light copper color ale with a rather large foamy head with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma of Belgian malt with light fruity notes. Taste is quite enjoyable with nice notes of Belgian-style malt with some light fruity ester and some residual sugar. Body is full with a somewhat oily texture and good carbonation. Not as floral or spicy as envisioned but very interesting nonetheless."
"D: The light body along with the yeast and spice characteristics make it similar to a witbier, and as such it goes down pretty easily. Unfortunately the lingering metallic flavor keeps me from wanting to go back for more."
"D: a great beer i would visit again."
"D - Interesting and very drinkable. The more quality saisons I have, the more I love the style."
"Poured a 2"" head which took a while but totally dissipated. Hazy straw yellow color with good effervescence. Smell of hops and citrus. Taste was on the mild side of hops. Although a pretty light beer it had a satisfying mouthfeel. Personally I don't think this is nearly as rich as other Saisons, BUT it's still very enjoyable, and probably my favorite beer from this maker so far. I certainly could drink this daily. And what a great value, a pint for about $6."
"Peace to all beerpeople"
"Awesome saison. Good to see a Mass brewery step their game up."
"Overall, a very good offering from Pretty Things Beer and Ale Project. Between this and Baby Tree, Pretty Things is shaping up to be a very exciting brewery. I certainly recommend this beer and hope that you will pick it up and try it as soon as you can. Cheers!"
"D: Very solid saison. All the flavors you'd expect where there and the pepper adds a nice touch. Will pick this one up again"
"I found this beer very much like a hefeweizen in flavor. Poured into a weizen glass, the beer has a golden body and a creamy white head with lots of carbonation action going on. Smells sweet and peppery, clovey. Noticeable hop, clove, Belgian yeast taste. Very crisp feel from CO2. The beer itself, velvety. Good beer, drink on."
"D: A great saison. Nothing really wrong with this one, it's all there. I've heard good things about Pretty Things and so far I'm loving it. Thanks again Michael, and please keep them coming!"
"D - Very drinkable. This is designed to be consumed during summer months, I can totally see that. It's not so bad in the winter though!"
"D - Excellent beer and a must-try for all lovers of Belgian and Belgian-style beers."
"This is a very drinkable and well done example of the style. If PT was available up here in Maine I could see myself drinking a ton of this in the summer."
"Letting this beer hang out in the glass for about a half hour really brings out that earth that I love so dearly in saisons. This is a great beer ... it never lets me down."
"D - Love this beer. One of my go-to beers. I absolutely can't get enough of it. Another great from one of my favorite breweries."
"Drinkability:I really enjoy the flavor on this one, it's full of delightful complexity. This has to be one of the best Saisons that I've ever had."
"Very drinkable. Nice americanized saison."
"O: A very good American interpretation of American Saison. Something about the taste is rubbing me the wrong way, but definitely enjoyable. I'd drink another bottle for sure."
"D - solid all around, with just a little amp due to the massive dryness (from added champagne yeast). drinkable and quite enjoyable."
"Overall, this was a fantastic beer. i was blown away by the flavors and think it worked the palate perfectly. I had this beer paired with my thanksgiving meal and it was exceptional. I would highly recommend people to seek this one out, regardless of whether you like this style or not."
"D: Very easy to drink, great beer."
"D: Really great. My glass is almost finished already."
"Drinkability: Saisons are a very drinkable style for me. And at just over 6% this one is straightforward and unobstrusive. A bomber is a good size for this beer. Has a thirst quenching property that makes you return for that second pint. Well done."
"Drinkability is quite good. This is a pretty solid and well put together Saison, drinking the whole bomber should be a pleasure."
"This beer is a picnic in a bottle. It emanates nothing but sun and fun, radiates relaxation and manifests a treasure trunk of sensual pleasantries - it's like a straw was inserted directly into the pleasure center of my brain. Pretty Things has captured all the best features of American and Belgian brewing and forced them to make babies. The children look a little like their mother, a little like their father - and are undeniably pretty."
"D: This would have been a great beer for the dog days of Summer, but it's still a great one for what'll probably be the last warmish day of the year. While nothing about this beer stands out as phenomenal, every aspect of this beer is solid and works together to create a very pleasant brew. If this were available locally, I'd definitely seek it out again."
"D - Really drinkable. This would have been perfect a few months ago when it was miserably humid and hitting 100 degrees routinely. I don't know what I was really expecting in this beer but this is certainly not it. That being said that isn't really a bad thing. This is a solid beer and would work great as a thirst quencher or paired with a nice meal. A solid beer for sure. I wouldn't mind having more of this but with limited suitcase space it isn't a must have."
"D - Drinks like a charm. Being quite juicy and fruity, this beer begs for you to drink it swig by swig. But do not succumb to its charms, take your time!"
"I've always said I don't like Belgian style beers, but I enjoy trying different varieties to see what all the hype is about. If you're a big fan of this style, I'd recommend Victory's Golden Monkey over a Jack D'or."
"Drink: Low Abv=Pretty easy to drink. A little too gassy/burpy"
"Jack D'Or (Golden Jack) is a delicious saison that can hold its head high in the company of the Belgian farmhouse originals. Pretty Things Beer & Ale Project continues to charm and impress. This, their flagship brew, is an easy recommendation."
"Drinkability: Not particularly expensive and very drinkable. However, If I'm looking for a saison, this wouldn't always scratch my itch."
"D: A very tasty, flavorful saison with a little extra lift at 6.4% ABV. It's crafted quite nicely and balanced as well as can be, although I feel it is distinctly American from the more aggressive than normal hop acidity in addition to the fruity, bitter ale flavors. A quality representation of an underrated style."
"D - This is a very, very tasty saison. I'd say it's the best brew I've had from Pretty Things."
"But that shouldn't be hard."
"D- Pretty easy to drink. Different and enjoyable."
"Drink: Jack D'or is a lovely saison. It starts out a little too dry for my tastes, but eventually reaches equilibrium and turns into one of the most drinkable saisons I've had. I find myself taking sip after sip. My first beer from pretty things, and hopefully not my last."
"4/4/4/4/4"
"Decent beer overall and well-worth a try. Points for the great label artwork. Too bad the flavors don't live up to the aroma."
"dark golden cloudy color with a pure white head. smells like belgian spices and slightly floral with a hint of funk. taste is of pleasant spices as well and somewhat grassy. light bodied. This is a tasty brew. nothing tremendously special, but a solid nice tasting brew that would almost be a session brew if it had a slightly lower ABV."
"D: Love this beer. I have yet had a saison that ""wow"" me, but this did it. Wish I could get more of these. Very easy to drink. A shout out thanks to 6DaysBottomOcean for sending this as an extra!"
"Great drinkability and fairly unique, I enjoyed this a lot and my next brew will be a Hedgerow Bitter!"
"M/D: A smooth drinking beer, very well carbonated. Reallly glad I picked this up and will probably get another."
"D: Very good and it livens up even more as it warms. A very complex and interesting Saison."
"D- Drinks so nicely."
"M/D - The finish is a little too sweet for the style, but the aftertaste if pleasant. It is missing the complexity found in Belgian saisons. I'd probably have it again."
"Overall: A very verygood Saison. So easy to drink. Pretty Things is a very nice brewery that I'm looking forward to trying more of their beers."
"http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/18371/57088/?ba=crusian"
"This just might be my favorite beer."
"Drinkability- Really dig this brewski. It's got a great hoppy/dirty start that is really unique for a Saison. The finish is interesting with a touch of caramel but I wish the beer was slightly less cloying in the finish. It's not a deal breaker (obviously) but it's just a touch more than I like. Thanks much Adam! <3"
"Paquette already has some new beers in the works, but tells us that ""the next is going to be the sort of beer I wanted to make in Yorkshire--an Old Ale/Stingo [slang for strong] type in both bottle and keg. It'll be named after, and dedicated to, the great beer city of Boston, called 'Saint Botolph's Town.'"" Um, would it be overkill if we said ""interesting"" again?"
"Had another batch and its seems this beers inconsistencies give it a bit of character. but with that said this is my nyc go to beer. that is if i can find it. I have had some that are no the brink of going bad or just a hint of banana. and others with a broad palate range of floral wonder and farmhouse straw. a good citrus with lemon zest... sometimes hints of candied pineapple and passionfruit. that malt is light drinking. but its a lean beer. has a good feel to it but that seems to be the most inconsistent quality. when at its best a nice pollen and twig. I would imagine once this beer is brewed regularly. and i mean in the same condition and the same brewery"
"An interesting Saison with flavors of bitter Granny Smith apples, black pepper bite and juicy pears. Tart citrus blends too, perhaps some tangerines? Funky yeast. Assertive hop snap on the finish. Gets a tad better with each distinctive sip."
"D - incredibly drinkable. I really enjoyed this beer, definitely worth seeking out."
"this is one of the most interesting saisons i have ever had. i was curious so i checked the pretty things site and there are no spices in this. crazy."
"Overall, a really nice and balanced saison. The sweet, bitter, and rustic flavors work nicely together to create a solid flavor profile. Another solid offering from Pretty Things. So far I've been really impressed by their beers I've had."
"D: One of my favorite saisons ever; spicy, earthy, funky, awesome!"
"Served: September 5, 2010"
"Drinkability - I could finish a bomber easy the dryness makes you want to come back for more."
"Pretty things Jack D'or pours a light copper gold with a nice head that doesn't linger. The aroma is light malt and some phenolic character from the yeast with maybe a hint of spice. The beer is crisp and dry, with some nice light malt. The same yeasty phenolics are there along with a nice earthy bitterness. The finish is dry with a bit of lingering bitterness. I am surprised to see this beer in British Columbia since it doesn't make it to Maine yet!"
"   D-  After the hops settle down the yeast and malt really come through make a good saison better with the big hops to compliment it.  Great way to take a delicious beer and hop it up."
"3.5 D: I'm not sure if it was the combo of beers befor it or batch variability, but when I had this a couple days ago at a tasting, I enjoyed it quite a bit more then. I remember it had a lot more fruitiness going on. Anyway, this is decent brew, but just not spectacular in any way."
"Drinkability is right up there, nothing you can really keep downing one after the other, best enjoyed how they sell it(per pint) or a glass or two on tap. Exceptional Beer."
"Jack D'or poured a hazy yellow-orange color with an ample head of foam and lacing. The scent is noticeably fresh -- airy grain backed by light citrus and floral. Unlike many reviewers I'm not picking up much spice in the aroma at all. The taste starts out all tart lemons with a floral undercurrent, though ends a touch sweeter with a orange and wheat. Jack D'Or has quite a bit of carbonation to spare, and it's dry, mellow flavors lend it towards easy summer drinking."
"Bottle. Pours a cloudy orange with a nice fluffy white head. Belgian yeast aroma is the initial smell followed by some fruity/floral notes. Bitter rind flavor followed by the belgian yeast, Ends with a lingering bitterness. Mouthfeel was light/medium."
"crisp, medium-bodied mouthfeel. drinkability is high, i could definitely see sessioning this even at 6.4% abv"
"D - Great drinkability. The simple and inviting flavor makes this a dangerous 6.4%."
"I was concerned about the quality of this brew, as the bottle reads ""Bottled Nov. 2009."" Three cheers for breweries who list bottling dates, and three cheers to me for not passing it up despite that. This thing is nothing but vibrant right now, and I'm relieved about that. Perfect for quality summer quaffing."
"Beer is medium to light in body. Finishes with a nice bitterness and there is some decent sweetness on the front and mid palates. There is this dryness in the middle of the beer that I find very interesting. There is almost a fruit like character in the late forward palate. The beer finishes with a mild graininess and some really nice feeling. I thoroughly enjoyed this unfortunately aroma-ed beer."
"Overall, this is a solid beer. However, I wouldn't consider this a good example of the style. A bit too hoppy and not enough yeast character for me. But still a solid beer for a ""Saison Americain""."
"Easy drinking and enjoyable, one of the better of the style. Just good beer."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a very nice beer to drink for a long time, especially if you like the mildly sour beers."
"Enjoyable to drink. This is a solid saison but right now it's really not knocking my socks off. The carbonation is good and I'm really digging how light this is right now. The only thing is I'm not crazy about how dry this is. All in all, a nice beer that I'll definitely have again. Very refreshing."
"D: This could be a good beer, but the lemon character needs to be dialed back."
"Drinkability was impressive. This beer is incredibly refreshing and packed with flavor. While it may not finish as crisp or as dry as some of its Belgian counterparts, it is definitely more interesting than many of them."
"overall - seems like a good saison, just not a huge fan of saisons in general. pretty drinkable."
"D-solid saison, very tasty and very drinkable. all the standard flavors, nose was nice, solid balance throughout, the body was just slightly lacking for me but still a very enjoyable brew."
"Pours a cloudy yellow with a white head. Not much lacing or head retention. Aroma is faint, but of lemons, yeast and wheat. Taste starts off with a nice kick of lemon zest and a strong wheat rush. Also a bit of orange. Strong yeast profile. Ends with a little bit of spice and a kick of pepper. Spices comes out the warmed the beer gets. Nice flavor, well balanced."
"Pours a really nice sunset yellow color with a decent head and nice lacing. Really has a glowing quality to it.smell is very floral with some belgian herbal yeast characteristics to it. Also has a sweet sugary lemony aspects. Taste is spot on for me. Has that nice crispness with a touch of balancing hops. Nice wheat lightness to it that makes it ultra crisp. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side but is packed with layers of flavors. Drinkability is high too because it's really refreshing and has that lemon earthiness to it that makes it delicious."
"Drinkability is okay, the high carbonation kind of takes away from the beer."
"For my first Farmhouse ale I was hoping for an overwhelming barn-must flavor, but was surprised with this mild and accesible brew!"
"Taste does not disappoint. Flavors of dry pear, slight bitter lemon zest and bready malt. It has a light body with a prickly level of carbonation. Minorly bitter, slightly drying finish. The bitterness lingers in the mouth with a drying quality that urges you to take another sip. As it warms, more sulfur twang comes forward and it becomes increasingly drying with the alcohol becoming more prominent. Overall pretty good."
"D-A most impressive brew that ranks up there with some of my most favorite saisons. A subtlety complex and very interesting beer that is a sheer joy to drink."
"O: should try a fresher bottle, i expected more but it is decent, good hop, good yeast, just wish both were stronger, aroma is very good but doesn't last"
"very drinkable."
"D: I can finish a bomber on my own, no problems. Really tasty. I enjoyed it thoroughly. I think twice about $8.50 bombers, but I'd pick this up once in a while."
"Drinkability is very good. Very tasty."
"Taste has quite a bit of lemon peel flavors, tart and bitter, a little much for me. Hint of sourness along with the lemon offset the grainy sweet malts pretty nicely though. Yeasty saison esters could be a little stronger and more prevalent. More funk, please! Still, pretty tasty for an American brewed saison."
"Quite drinkable and perfect for this 95 degree day"
"Poured into a chalice a nice hazy golden dark yellow color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger fizzy/foamy white head, which does leave some sticky lacing around. The nose is malty, nice touch of yeast, bready, slight pepper. The taste is malty, yeasty, nice little touch of pepper. Medium body. Drinkable, another fine example of the style and brew's in general from PT."
"D: Exceptional. And while Jack D'Or may not be the truest representation of the Saison/Farmhouse Ale, it certainly is one of my recent favorites while taking a few stylistic liberties. I have thoroughly enjoyed everything I've sampled from Pretty Things so far."
"Complex with a wide range of flavors. A slightly less astringent finish would increase drinkability, and slightly lower level of bitterness on the long finish would make this beer a balanced knockout."
"Pours orange, cloudy, and piled high with tight and retentive off-white head that leaves little patches of lace on the glass. Delicate aroma of lemon, green apple, orange, flowers, soda crackers, and phenols. Mildly tart lemon flavour, very dry, some clovey or peppery spice notes, finishes with a very earthy and medicinal sort of bitterness. Light bodied with fine, spritzy carbonation. Velvety mouthfeel, like champagne. Easy drinking and flavourful, elegant and delicate. Enjoyed it quite a bit."
"Pretty good one, enjoyed it, nothing mind blowing but quite refreshing and crisp..."
"M & D: very good mouthfeel, very drinkable"
"D- This beer just didn't do it for me. I like the idea of adding some extra hops to a Belgian saison, but in execution it wasn't so great. I think I was expecting more of a saison, but the hops and spice dominated the taste a little too much for me."
"I would definitely drink this again - another highly impressive brew from Pretty Things."
"I'm torn over this. Certainly flavourful enough, but it seems the stretch the style a bit. Little too much sourness for me and the malt isn't quite as light as I would've liked. Worth a try."
"An interesting beer indeed, but drink-ability is only so so. I reccomend giving it a try, but I personally won't be adding this to the list of stock saisons I keep around."
"D: Good."
"D - This is a great drinking beer, and a nice American twist on the style."
"Drinkability: Very good. Pretty Things could certainly do a whole helluva lot worse for a flagship beer than this! A fine, flavorful, but still keenly refreshing American-born Belgian-style brew."
"D: Crisp, refreshing, and not too strong so that having a whole bomber is a very pleasant experience. The price point is very reasonable on this beer too. An all around win and an excellent brew from an interesting local brewery. Will definitely buy more."
"Beer poured hazy golden which to me equals the bearer of good things (usually). Beer had a good head and decent lacing, but to be honest I found the taste more bitter/sour than I expected, with no real improvement while drinking. This wasn't a bad beer...I just didn't think it was an ""A" beer."
"Pours a hazy golden yellow with big white head, clumpy lacing. Smells delicious--a little tart, yeasty, some funk to it too. A bit of biscuit to it too. Refreshing. Taste has some more hops to it than I expected--a nice bitter kick to this one, even after that Surly Abrasive I had tonight. A bit of lemon to it, but definitely yeasty at the start, malty on the finish with some lingering bitterness. Light feel, nicely carbonated, dry finish. Good drinkability, not my favorite saison, but definitely one I was glad to try. I guess Pretty Things makes some legit stuff."
"Served in a flute with my brunch at Lord Hobo. The beer pours a lovely color, halfway in between bright gold and orange. The head and lacing are alright, but ultimately disappointing, especially given wonderful prior experiences in this regard with bottles of Jack. The nose is a blend of the typical yeast spiciness that I expect from any saison worth its salt and some citrus hop aromas (think orange/lemon). The taste largely mirrors the nose, with the addition of a noticeable amount of pale malt sweetness. The carbonation is high, which serves the brief crack of hop bitterness that hits mid palate well, but a by product of the aforementioned sweetness is that the body is a little rich for my liking for a saison. Ultimately a great beer, and I love the added american hop flavor blending with a traditional saison."
"On tap at the Brattleboro, Vermont Brewer's Festival on May 22, 2010. It has a ver foamy head above the cloudy, pale yellow body. The malts are in the aroma in a limited fashion but it seemed to come across as more ""beery"" to me. There is a creamy, medium texture with a nice enough wheat and yeasty taste. Also there seems to be a moderate strain of hops in here. But the flavor was also a lot more sour than I like for this style. Kind of dry at the end."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is pretty decent, it had some nice flavors to it. The citrus flavors were pretty nicely done in it and made it a pretty easy drinking beer and the fruity, sweet flavors gave it some nice balance."
"The feel is really refreshing and clean. Goes down well and is pretty light on the pallet. A really great refreshing beer."
"Pours bright golden with a lively head. The aroma is lemony and the flavor is wheaty and cereal-like, with a lemony edge. There is an apricot fruity character. The finish is clingy, with a late bitterness and a cereal-like flatness. The mouthfeel is thick and clingy, leading to an apricot bitterness."
"D: I buy a bomber of this every time that I go to the beer store now, and could probably take down two or three of these in a row. Saison is not even close to one of my favorite styles, but I have nothing but good things to say about this beer and brewery!"
"Drinkability: Very enjoyable saison that hits the spot and is very easy on the wallet. Will buy more."
"Drinkability: I don't know exactly what I paid for this, but I know it wasn't expense. As the weather here starts to get warmer in Vestal, I could easily drink a few of these down the road, and I wonder what leaving it around for a few more years would do also."
"I like it well enough & drinkability is pretty good. I can definitely see how this is considered an ""American-style saison."" My only qualm (a small one, at that) is that it seems to blur style lines; not a bad thing per se, but it just seems a little odd, strictly style-wise. I wouldn't mind drinking it again, though."
"Also, at least where I bought this at Zips in Minneapolis, the price was insanely good at $3.99 a bomber. If this is the going rate on this beer everywhere, this would be my pick as best beer deal around. This is top grade beer at a steel! Just wish I could get this at home."
"Drinkability: An outstanding beer - love the American hop element as a twist on the Saison style, not to mention the wheat and oat elements"
"D - Nice saison, easy to enjoy but for my taste the tart aspect will have me savoring this one bottle over a long night."
"D- Overall this is a great Saison and I'd buy it ALOT if I had access to it. Another winner for Pretty Things."
"This is a flavorful, easy drinking beer. I've wanted to try this one for a while now and it didn't disappoint."
"D- my first experience with this brewery has been a pleasant one. something ill make sure to keep in mind when visiting my sister in boston."
"Has this on-tap at the golden rail ale house in Newburgh, NY. I was craving this after work today and picked up a bomber. Delicious saison with a head that would give John Merrick a run for his money. This beer is not only great to drink but it's also a joy to look at. Nice amber color, which looks great in my Hennepin glass. No need to say much more, this beer speaks for itself! Drink this."
"This is a great beer. Really light and flavorful, the orange and lemon sourness is fantastic. A really unique flavor. I find this beer pretty complex. It has a dry bready malt, but light fruity sourness all at the same time. The flavors change throughout the experience. I really enjoyed it."
"Batch 10, bottled November 2009. The beer pours a clear, medium-dark yellow with a large white head. The aroma is Belgian yeast with some wheat and citrus notes. The flavor is awesome, with light funk, Belgian yeast, orange and lemons. There is the slightest bit of tartness in there as well. The citrus hops go very well with the rest of the flavor. Medium mouthfeel and medium-high carbonation. This is an intensely drinkable, awesome saison."
"Strong carbonation and a medium body make this a pretty drinkable Saison."
"D) A nice saison. I'd drink another."
"Not overly awe-inspiring but a"
"Thoroughly drinkable, but not really too style (at least with this batch). I like my saisons dry, funky and complex, and this one receives a strike on every count. I figure the variance I'm seeing is just a difference between batches, but on the basis of this one I'd be a little hesitant to return."
"D - Real easy drinker. Very good saison and worth trying."
"Overall I am very pleased with this beer. Granted I'm a big farmhouse fan, but Jack in addition to being spot on for the style, is very drinkable, with a complex enough flavor to keep me interested. Personally I find I could session this beer, and thoroughly enjoy the opportunity to support a local microbrewery."
"I would recommend this as a good summery beer that's not too strong."
"Pours a two finger white head that fades very slowly to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Medium-strong carbonation and medium bodied. Almost clear pale amber color. Nose is almost citrus. Flavor is unsweetened lemon and some hops. $10.45 for a 22oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA."
"Nice smooth drinking beer with plenty of complex flavors. It was not as earthy a Belgian farmhouse ale since it had more muted yeast flavors, but the American farmhouse spin made this highly drinkable as the hops and citrus added a nice taste to it. I highly recommend trying this beer and it went down refreshing and easy. This was tasty, funky and different, so I will seek this out to try it again."
"I poured from a 22 ounce bottle into a snifter. It pours a pale, clear gold with a moderate 2 finger white head, a bit of lacing. A bit of funk on the nose, but mostly citrus, and orange peel. Lots of citrus/orange peel up front. The beer is dry and sweet and funky. It finishes with some lingering funkiness. A well carbonated, medium bodied beer. A very good saison that I will buy again."
"Solid all around."
"Re-pouring to deliberately stir up the sedimented yeast proves it was really caked on the bottom of the bottle good. The beer is no longer crystal clear in my glass (raising appearance rating a full point from its starting point 2.5) but it is more...orange. The complex and earthy bitterness of the yeast fills out the saison profile and offsets the previously mentioned caramely sweetness. Still not unpleasantly funky though."
"Taste is equally as funky and sweet, light hoppiness makes is real easy to drink. Mouthfeel is very full and creamy. Has a light bitter finish overall very good"
"D- This is very very drinkable beer that I'm glad I have got to try. I need to do myself a favor and find a way to get more. I would suggest this beer to everyone who likes a good farmhouse ale."
"D- I'm not sure I could do multiple beers in a row, because it is quite tart, but for a bomber, it is very drinkable, very enjoyable, and an interesting take on the saison style. It seems to make perfect sense that they would call it a saison American."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Was a light amber in color, with a 3 finger milky white frothy head. It partially clung to the sides, and also formed an island of higher head in the middle. Streams of carbonation constantly rose from the bottom. Aroma was slightly citrusy hoppy. Taste was orangey, slightly sweet, with a hoppy finish. Felt very good in the mouth. Clung to the sides of the mouth, went down very smooth. Easy to drink, could drink over an extended period of time."
"Pours a hazy golden straw color with full, prickly carbonation, big white head but minimal retention and decent lacing. Scent is of pale malts, bready, wheaty and grainy backed by a bit of orange rind, spice and sweetnes. Taste again begins with the pale malts, grainy, earthy quality to them. The orange rind is more pronounced than the nose dictates, moderate spicyness, lacking any notable herbal, floral or yeasty tastes i expect from the style. Light bodied, adequately carbonated, very dry from start to finnish. Decent saison, but one that did not live up to my expectations from the style, overly mild and dry for my liking."
"D: I would drink this again, though I don't know if I could drink a full 22 oz by myself (I split this one with my drinking buddy)."
"Awesome beer. The influences of the saison style are clear, but the reinterpretation leads to something totally unique. Great use of hops without just turning it into another hop monster."
"Shared at a tasting a number of months ago, can't recall who brought this one. Thanks, whoever you are. Cloudy, nearly opaque blond in my glass, topped by a finger of dense white froth that recedes to a small cap. The nose is intensely estery with notes of hay, pepper and a low level of funk. It's dry and crackery on the palate, spritzy, medium-bodied. Flavors of white pepper, lemon zest and light citrusy hops lend complexity. Medium-light in body with a pleasantly dry finish, I find myself wishing there was a bit more funk to this, but it's a solid and very enjoyable saison nonetheless."
"Taste: Mirros the aroma, pale malts, light citrus and hops and orange/grapefruit/pear, lychee and cloves, not enough funk."
"D - easy drinking, good tasting brew."
"This is a fantastic Americanized Farmhouse Ale; eminently quaffable, full of flavor, but not over-whelming in any way; simply fantastic. I am definitely a sucker for a beer constructed like this."
"Light bodied with a light, tingly carbonation. Finishes dry. Very good drinkability. Too bad Pretty Things left Minnesota shortly after getting here. Lucky for me, I found all kinds of this sitting in a store which most BAs must not know about. It has been sold out for a while in most other stores."
"D - I've had this beer a number of times and it never lets me down. Definitely a go to saison. Great with food or by itself. I use this beer frequently to intoduce newbies to craft beer with good success. Happy to have this available easily to me...and I definitely take advantage of that."
"D: An excellent American-made Saison. Makes me sad I missed the Pretty Things tasting at that bar a few days earlier."
"Highly drinkeable. The strength is just right for this style. One of the better farmhouse saison's I've had, (which incidently isn't many)."
"I've been a big fan of this beer for the last year and I hadn't had a chance to officially review it. Pretty Things' 'twist' on the saison style is excellent. This is one of my favorite new breweries and this beer is in my top 10!!!"
"Overall, very good interpretation of a saison. Recommended. I also dug the artwork on the bottle."
"Bottled in July of 2009. Pours a cloudy orangish gold with a nice delicate white head. Aroma is very sweet and perfume like with zesty lemon, spice, flowers and straw notes. The flavor is also quite sweet with plenty of floral, bready and grassy notes. Also detecting some spice and a definite tang from the yeast. Pretty firm bitterness for a saison. A very tasty brew with a nice long finish that is sweet, yet dry. Mouthfeel is very good with a medium body and the previously mentioned finish. Very drinkable and an interesting take on the style. Glad I found this on the bargain rack, it is not showing its age at all."
"Bottle bought in Philadelphia, $10, bottled Nov 2009. Very cool cartoonish image on the label. Hazy pale golden color, really thick rocky head, about 3+ fingers worth. Faint bubblegum in the aroma, mild esters, very similar to Hennepin (unfortunately >2x the price). A very good saison, again like Hennepin but with a little extra hops punch. Not much extra, just enough to stand out. Peppery mouthfeel from the carbonation, on the thicker side for the style but it feels right."
"definetly a sign of good- rather pretty- things to come."
"Nonetheless for a brewer with no brewery this is an excellent beer, it must be hard to brew on someone else's system and produce exactly what you are looking for, still I would drink this again as it is a solid belgo-american."
"Overall a very nice and well made saison. There's some small room for improvement, but this is certainly one of the better american made versions, very authentic and to style. An excellent beer."
"Don't drink and review."
"D: What can I say but, wow. I was awed and humbled by this wonderful Saison. 10 months in the bottle and this feels like it's just getting started. Would've loved to try this fresh to compare it to how amazing it is now."
"Fluffy white foam topped clear, golden beer. Chunky lacing with good head retention supported by a constant stream of bubbles rising to the surface. Fruity hop aroma was apparent when the bottle was cracked. Notes of hay and citrus zest, apple and white pepper. Smooth texture, fine carbonation. Dry malt with an edge of fruit. Solid, but not overwhelming, bitterness. Light peppery spice in the finish. Great texture with a very refined, well balanced flavour."
"Oh, but one more thing, Pretty Things, ...don't you know you're driving your mommas and poppas insane? Got to make it plain, better make way for the homo superior!"
"Drinkability would be a 6 for me if it were a choice on here. I don't know if its a right place/right time thing for me right now but this beer is quenching my thirst amazingly."
"On tap at Rattle 'N' Hum. Strong aromas, with white pepper and apple. Cloudy white head and white lace. Good bitterness edge to it. Unique saison, very American owing to the bitterness and attention to aromas, and bold spice. Appropriate carbonation, wonder what it would be like on cask."
"Solid, impressive saison with lots of nice little details everywhere in the experience of drinking it."
"D - Quaffability (is that a word) is off the charts... This is my introduction to Pretty Things and I can't wait to get my hands on their other offerings... This truly is a special offering... Loaded with subtle complexities... Also an exceptional value given the price of other top notch Saisons... This one really hit the spot and I can't wait to have another..."
"Explosive head when poured into the glass. Slightly hazy golden color. Rocky lacing is left on the glass. Aroma consists of citrus fruit such as lemons, spices like cloves and pepper, and a touch of earthiness. Very saison like. The flavor is more fruity than spicy or funky. A bit of orange candy quality. Just light spice and barely any earthiness or tartness. Finishes dry with no lingering aftertaste. Light body with a nice carbonation. Maybe too much carbonation but it feels soft and silky so I did not mind the extra bubbles. Not the most complex saison but it is still quite enjoyable."
"d - Overall this was a pretty good saison. It wasn't as bitter or hard to drink as some other saison's I;ve had and I thought the flavors were good and it was a good representation of a Belgian."
"For some reason I smelled the empty bottle when I was done, and I got a very strong hop aroma, with a citrus/floral side to it. I've had this beer many times, and each time I pick up a new characteristic."
" A wonderful Belgo-Americano brew."
"Overall I am not overly thrilled with this one, and I had high hopes. A bit of an underachievement in my eyes but I can see how a lot of people unfamiliar with the style would enjoy this immensely. Good flavors, just not nearly enough of them."
"The beer is light bodied, well carbonated and a nice representation of the style. The beer is full of flavors that remind me of summer and early fall, with a crisp and dry mouthfeel. Definitely something I will revisit."
"M / D. Soft and easy, odd finishing flavors are not entirely complimentary, but still, this is a solid, different and malty example of a Saison. Recommended, especially if you're local to these cats."
"Drinkability? Since the abv is reasonable and well hidden and the tastes here are anything but boring...this is a very easy drinking beer though I think, when I finish the 22oz, I'll be fully contented and not looking to grab another if I had one. That's not a slant on the beer in any way; most Saisons I've had are 1 and I'm done for one sitting. Having another on another day is a whole new ball game. ;^)"
"Drinkability: A very interesting beer for my 500th review here. Very tasty for a saison and not as hard and biting as others I have had. A sipper and one per sitting, but I would like to have this again, especially on tap."
"Coating, but not greasy. Warming in a soothing, non-irritating way. Sane amount of carbonation. A solid saison. :)"
"Pours a very clear orange red with a nice sized head. Lots of thin lacing. Smells delicate like flowers with a hint of green apple. Taste is sweet and bitter. Very crisp and refreshing. Mouthfeel is thin and well carbonated. Very drinkable and very enjoyable. Pretty Things has become a great brewery and this is definitely their flagship beer."
"Drinkability is high, as this beer keeps you wanting more. This was my first Pretty Things beer, and is an absolute winner."
"D-Very nice all around flavor. This beer would be a great beer with foods of all types. I would drink this beer again."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a pint glass. Nov 2009 batch. Pours a rich golden-orange with 2-3 fingers white foam head which dissipates slowly. A lot of carbonation. Difficult for me to place the aroma, but ultimately hints of orange. Taste is pleasant complex combination of fruity, earthy, and spicy, the latter taking over into peppery aftertones. Initially carbonation was a bit overpowering, but fortunately died down with continued drinking. Bit hard to pin down, but very good."
"Impression: Solid beer, perhaps lacking some of the smoothness of some others in this broad style, the intensity of some others, but a beer I certainly will purchase again."
"This beer pours a clear orange-golden color. The head is a billowy off-white color, and lacing is thick. The aroma is funky, fruity, and floral. It has good strength, and nice complexity. The taste is like the aroma, but a little less strong. It is still quite nice though. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a carbonation level that is way too high. So high, in fact, that it really gets in the way of the nuances that I'm sure are hiding in the taste, and caries them away into oblivion. Overall, this is a nice beer that has a lot of the elements of greatness, but ultimately falls a little short."
"All I can say is wow, its not insanely complex only as complex as it needs be. Its a pretty bold sasion but you don't have to think too much about this. Stylistically on target, but remains very unique."
"Food pairing notes: I had this with a Japanese Hibachi steak and it was one of the best pairings I've ever had. The beer contrasted the steak nicely but really rode along with the Ginger sauce. It's a great sauce, and along with this beer, it tasted like I was drinking a liquid version of the sauce, but with more flavors."
"Batch 9, bottled Oct2009. In a tulip, the beer was a golden color with a thick white whipped cream head that was very sticky. A sweet, spicy aroma. Sweet malt taste, some orange, and lots of peppery spice. I thought this beer was a bit on the unbalanced side, and was too sharp for me."
"Plenty of other distractions are good but this is great."
"This is certainly a nice beer, and I'd recommend it to anyone, but it's not a favorite. I'd be interested in their other offerings."
"D: An amazing looking beer that delivers on the style."
"D= Awesome beer. After drinking Baby Tree last night I wasn't expecting much from this one but this beer is the quintessential American saison. This is what I want a saison to taste like. Great flavors and smell. Awesome looking beer. Great feel. One of the best saison's I've ever had no doubt seek this beer out."
"Good offering, I'll seek more out from this brewery and give them a try."
"D: Pretty harsh to drink. Low ABV, though."
"Flavor is also spot on for a typical solid saison. Light and crisp with a lemon aftertaste. A little grapefruit. Slight hop and wheat notes. Very good beer!"
"The palate opens with a delicate combination of spices (white pepper) and sweetness. While I usually dislike sweeter saisons, the mild sweetness works beautifully in this beer. Honey and mild caramel meld with the spice and estery character of the yeast. Citrus character is noticeable, lending a juiciness to the palate that works very well with everything else that's going on. Phenols appear towards the finish, one that's a combination of sweet and drying. Delicate floral and citrus flavors linger on the finish, with a touch of honey. The combination of the medium body and the high carbonation is enjoyable. While the flavors are excellent, I find the sweetness to be just a little distracting, keeping me from quaffing this beer like I'd with a Dupont. All told, an excellent beer."
"I'll have to admit this shattered my expectations (the benefit of avoiding reading reviews before tasting). I'm not sure how I got the idea in my head this would be one of those 'very good, but missed the mark for the style' American interpretations of a Belgian but it just isn't the case. Really a must try for lovers of tradional Saison's."
"D- Easy drinking with great flavors that challenge the palate just enough to say ""Enjoy!"" And yes, I will have many more please."
"D - Good for a saison. Very tasty but due to a slight creamy taste might be less drinkable."
"Unfortunately, I feel this is a little too hoppy, but it still a good beer."
"This is a drinkable Saison, but it's nothing special. All of its qualities are subdued."
"Overall, a saison that I am glad that is now available in MN. I traded for this bottle in the summer, but now I can get it a lot easier."
"Note - I rated this to style but should be noted that it would reach a 4 rating as an unique style."
"Bomber with nifty art; paper over the neck reads ""BOTTLED OCT 2009 BATCH NINE."" I like to drink saison from a pint glass; this time it's a S. Smith imperial pint. A typical pour, nothing too vigorous: but man, that's quite a head on this beer: huge, foamy, four fingers high, just off-white with an egg white density on top and big loose bubbles below; lots of thick lacing. The smell is classic saison: a little funk, lemon zest, wet tree bark, damp wool, pan drippings, soap. The taste comes on with some mild sweetness, moving through to some sour notes like wood sorrel, then a pleasant grain flavor that grows increasingly malty, ending with a dry bitter finish reminiscent of tangelo, plus a lot of white pepper. It's perhaps more highly hopped than the classic saison, but for a ""saison Americain," as the folks at Pretty Things call it, it's spot-on. It's highly carbonated, which keeps it nice and lively in the mouth, clean and crisp on the palate -- really excellent. I wish I'd gotten a second bottle, as this one is going to disappear all too soon. A really fine beer."
"22oz brown bottle purchased at The Liquor Shoppe in Tygsborro, Mass. Bottled July 2009, Batch Eight. Pours a murky orange amber body with nearly an inch of off-white head. Smells citrussy, pithy, with some lemon zest, lavender and vanilla notes. Tastes citrussy and floral, with some cinnamon and nutmeg notes, as well as some pith, caramel. Light to medium in body with moderate carbonation. Unlike many farmhouse ales I've had. An interesting and pleasant mesh of flavors, tasty and balanced, and way too drinkable for the complexity and abv. Definitely will be picking this one up again if I get the chance!"
"Drinkability: I would have this again and would recommend this to those who want a tangy, grainy open and a mildy hoppy finish."
"D: Nothing too out of the ordinary here. This is good, but the flavors are all so toned down that nothing stands out. Balanced for sure, but also a little boring."
"M&D - medium bodied, dry mouthfeel throughout, a drinkable saison, layered and complex enough to keep you guessing"
"Got this one as an extra in a grade trade with jlindros. Pours a light orange color with a nice 1/2 inch white head that left some very nice lacing on my NB globe. Aroma is of some light tropical fruit, pale malts, and a touch of Belgian-like yeast. Flavor is nice and fruity, but not sweet. Very dry, flavor of orange, lemon, some grassiness, and lightly toasty malts. Very nice, not overly complex. Mouthfeel is medium to light, dry and crisp, ample carbonation. A nice beer and would to have some more from Pretty Things in the future."
"Great to start the night off with a bottle of Jack. This bottle comes from batch #5, which was brewed back in May. Color is a beautiful hazed golden color matched with a large white heading that has some staying power. The champagne yeast is evident in the nose, along with some fresh grains and mango. A whole array of tropical fruits hit the palate (think pineapple, guava etc.) first, followed by some peppery notes. Hops intermingle with the champagne yeast to give this beer is nice dryness in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium, prickly and really complex. Drinking this by itself is great, but pairing it with food is a sheer delight. Since this beer has been released, it has been a go to for me, and remains my favorite from the Pretty Things line. Some have complained that the quality of the newer batches has declined, but I have to say that I haven't noticed much of a difference. This is one of Massachusetts' special treats to the world of craftl beer. Cheers"
"If not for the presence of a certain earthiness, I might mistake this for a Belgian IPA. It lacks the complexity or tartness of many saisons, but is a proudly ""Americanized"" take on the style. If this one were regularly available in my neck of the woods, I can see it growing on me, in which case I might throw another half point on top of the ""taste"" rating..."
"D: Once you get past the initial bite of this beer, it is actually very tasty and drinkable. I think that this is a beer for those with the proper palate. That is to say, I don't think that this is the beer for everyone and while quite enjoyable, I am not sure that this is a beer that I would drink multiple rounds of. It grows on you."
"I enjoyed the spice that emerged deep into the glass--and the tasts overal resembled that of an amber ale/belgian blend. Very easy to drink."
"Pours a cloudy orange gold color with a two finger white fluffy head with solid retention leaving patchy lacing down the glass. Lots of citrus in the nose, mostly orange with floral notes and some bubblegum aroma. Upfront, the taste is of orange and corriander like a belgian wit, which gives way to pear and vanilla then comes lemon hop and pepper spiciness. Well carbonated with a really nice, dry finish. An easy drinking beer, I only regret I didn't pick up some bleu cheese to pair with this great saison. I'll have to try that next time because there will definitely be a next time."
"d: I admit that I bought this because I like the label. I was rewarded with a very nice sasion, perfect for this warm fall evening."
"Overall this was another great beer from PT. The flavors worked well together and the lingering bitterness added a nice element to the beer. This is a really good warm weather beer."
"Highly recommended..."
"D = Goes down smoothly, but the taste just doesn't make me want to quaff this. Not a bad beer and I would certainly drink it again."
"The flavor mirrors the aroma well, but kicks up the hops a notch with notes of floral greenery, light citrus zest, and fresh-cut grasses that leave a light, lingering bitterness. Superb balance of biscuity malts with a hint of honey. Mouthfeel is equally as impressive, with a medium-light body and a crisp, tight carbonation level that drinks smoothly. Highly drinkable and refreshing, I could easily handle an entire bomber of this stuff by myself, but was glad to share it with a friend. Impressive stuff..."
"Funky, sea-salty and bright on the front of the mouth. Lemon, dry grains...This beer is bold, overpowering mild food pairings. This big taste is abutted by plenty of velvety carbonation to keep the beer honest and quick. Zest is apt to describe this. The citric quality grows into a metallic spine, then opens into something more complex... The beer is clean in the mouth, light to medium in body... It finishes with a slight caramel creaminesss that is overrun by plenty of bitter hoppiness and yeasty funk. The hop lingers in the jowls below my tongue, fitting. Zest is still apt, and I am pleased...One of the better farmhouse beers I've tried in some time. Be forewarned though: best to drink at a reasonable pace; we let the beer sit for too long (1hr or so at least), and it became hot, corny and a bit messy."
"Notes: Not quite comparable to Belgian saisons, but a nice american version. A very good beer to try."
"Pours a translucent, light golden/orange color with a bubbly white head that leaves sticky dots of lacing and a retentive film of tiny bubbles. Spicey (pepper) and yeasty nose, very earthy, slightly bitter. Very earthy, floral, spicy body, with a strong malt body, however that malt never really asserts and sweetness throughout. Medium body with very full, sharp carbonation. Subtle citrus flavors, more rind tartness than sweet. Very refreshing and drinkable, well balanced and subtle flavors, not my favorite saison, and a little too expensive for me to seek out again, but would recommend."
"I had the Jack D'or first, followed by both the Confounded Mister Sisyphus (an earthy, golden ale that's a little strong on the cherry flavors) and Baby Tree (a brown, malty, complex Quad with strong notes of Plum), both from Pretty Things as well. The Jack D'or was by far my favorite of the three, and I will definitely be looking for it when I next return to the New England area."
"I think the phenols could give this beer some more character with age, but for now it just reminds me of sanitizing with bleach, which has been sort of a hard memory to erase after a couple years of bad homebrewing. Overall, a cool beer. Interested in looking it up again in BA mag and seeing what's in it."
"D - A very highly drinkable Saison, I was willing to wait to pop it and was pleased that it lived up to the first experience over a month ago. One of the best I have drank lately it fits the summer humidity with its drinkability -I will seek this out again most certainly."
"Overall: Pretty great. Highly recommend. Very refreshing, very tasty muted fruit and honey tones, great for the summer. Wouldn't stand up to a lot of food, but something light like cheese and fruit would be delicious. Or just sip on it's own."
"pours a hazy golden color with a smooth white head leaving tons of lace on the sides of the glass. the aroma is mighty tasty, with a bit of malt and a lot of yeastiness. the taste gives a nice citrusy sweetness up front and nice amount of the farmhouse yeastiness, the sweetness gives way to a tart dry finish. the medium body and good carbonation make this a good drinkable beer."
"The beer pours a hazy gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a fine pale malt scent along with an earthy/fruity yeast aroma. It has a mild hop character that really compliments the esters. The taste is good. It has a very citrousy flavor that screams esters from the yeast. Also, the hops add a solid bitterness as well. It's quite earthy with tons of farmhouse funk. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with too much carbonation. This is a tastey beer with lots of unique character; a fine farmhouse ale."
"The beer is light bodied with a high level of carbonation. The mouthfeel is light, crisp, dry, and creamy. An enjoyable and refreshing beer on this warm summer evening."
"Starts sweets, and clean. Some bready flavor comes in afterward. Finishes slightly bitter, with this bitter aftertaste. Maybe a little more bitter than I would like from a saison, but I guess the ""American saison"" description covers this. Drinkable, yes, but I'm not sure its my type for this style. I can recognize it is a good beer, just not my taste."
"This beer for me has all day drinkability, another fantastic summer beer. Just a refreshingly clean well hopped saison."
"D: Perhaps a bit on the safe side as far as saisons go, yeah kind odd saying that with all the hops in it, but the funk/farmhouse flavors just aren't hitting home"
"Notes from and tasted on: 7/30/09."
"A really interesting take on a Saison I finished the bomber extremely easy and would have been ready for more. I was quite impressed with this brew I hope the others from the brewer stack up as nice"
"A golden amber with plenty of carbonation and some cloudiness. It smelled of funk and candied sugar. Lots of earthiness and lemon tart followed by some caramel notes. A bit of acidity and dryness in the finish. I easily finished the bomber and had room to spare"
"Personally, I would say that the addition of hops has made this beer more drinkable than certain traditional saisons. Although I can definitely put back a few Hennepins, the acidity often causes me to limit my consumption. This enterprising addition has not only made this beer standout, but much easier to consume and enjoy."
"D- wow this beer is unbelievable, cant stop sipping this, this is a real surprise. From the handful of saisons I have tried, I have not been a big fan of this style but this beer has converted me. Mark my words: PRETTY THINGS BEERS ARE GOING TO BE SOME OF THE MOST SOUGHT AFTER BEERS VERY SOON."
"Gadzooks, this is dry. I can feel it sucking the moisture out of my body. It's like a yeast infection in a bottle. Egads."
"D: Very good. Not offending at all and pretty enjoyable."
"Looking forward to trying their other offerings. I also love the fact that Dan used to brew beer at the North East Brewing Company, which was my home away from my Allston apartment from 1996-1999 or so."
"If this is a true rep of the style, it's amazing the saison didn't die centuries ago. I've had much better saisons, this one is OK, bordering on actively unpleasant."
"Pours a hazy straw with a nice white head. Nose has banana, spices, peppery yeast and citrus. Flavor is also on the fruity side with an earthy herbal yeast presence. Crisp body is well carbonated. Tasty Saison, great with funky cheese and fresh fruits or a seafood dish."
"Draft. Pours a cloudy yellow/orange with a thick white head. Aroma of wheat and yeast, very delicious! Flavor is bready with light fruits and spices in the finish. Well balanced. Just an enjoyable beer to drink! Very similar on draft compared to the bottle version."
"D- The 6.4% is low and not present in the taste at all so this one is a easy one to tackle. While I could down a whole bottle of this, I would rather share it. The freshness of the bottle really sows the array of flavors in this A great treat during the summer."
"A good saison, good american interpretation. Much larger hop presence than traditional belgians, but very nice."
"D: I think ACBF was their coming out party and it did make me pick up some of their beer. The brewers are super nice and their beers are really quite good. The artwork is solid and distinctive. They have a ton of potential."
"This is an extremely well-made saison and one that I'd consider having again for sure. More than anything though, it makes me want to try all the other Pretty Things brews. Definitely recommended."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied and crisp with heavy carbonation."
"D - Fine Saison with plenty of spicy, peppery goodness and strong yeast presence. I am beginning to like this style more and more lately, and this is a good example of the style."
"Split a bottle at Tap and Table in Emmaus, PA. This was a well-crafte and mighty tasty beer, reminds me a bit of Hennepin for the dry hoppy flavor. This beer had an obvious sweet candy malt undercurrent with light Belgian spice, but this is a delicously hoppy Belgian. Dry and drinkable, just like the style dictates, with herbal, peppery, and citrus hops all over your tongue. Good beer, go find it."
"This is one to buy again and again, and share, and promote. I feel like I'm getting in on the ground floor of something with huge potential."
"The feel is bubbly like champagne. Lots of fizz. Appropriate for style, but a little sharp. It's not stellar, because it's so sharp and so fizzy, but it's drinkable for a saison. Citrus, chlorine and a Belgian funk spice."
"Although I am drinking this by itself, I can imagine it would be great with food."
"Production is getting increased, hooray beer"
"Poured into my Duvel Tulip. A very nice large 4 finger head which leaves some very nice lacing. Smell is standard for the style. Lemon, spices and earth tones are light but evident. Taste is lighter and hides some of the earthy tones I really love from most Saisons, but still very good none the less. The mouthfeel is crsp and drinkability is also very good. I like what they are trying to do and plan on trying more beers from Pretty Things. Very solid effort and will definitely buy more of this."
"A great example of the style by an up and coming brewery."
"I've met Dann, the Brew-guy, at a tasting, and he and Martha seem like absolutely wonderful folks. Definitely the local brewers you want to support. Jack D'Or is a wonderful summer beer, great for beating the heat, and I will definitely be buying this again."
"Overall, a nice, and very interesting, saison. Reminds me of a cross between a saison and a Belgian strong pale in a lot of ways, but no matter what it is, it's a nice beer that I would love to see at a selection of nice restaurants in NYC alongside its brother St Botolph's. Seems like a fantastic food beer."
"1135"
"Mouthfeel I'd light medium bodied, spicy, citrusy, and dry. Not bad. It seems to be a good example of the style."
"Very tasty and way too quaffable for the upcoming summer. Good stuff."
"Bottle shared courtesy of glid207. Thanks! Dated November, 2008. Pours a hazy golden with a head that is a thin ring. Fairly light aromas of lemon, coriander, and white pepper. Good flavor with some nice herbal character, lemon, and a very light spiciness. A bit spritzy in the mouth, but acceptable for the style. Pretty pleasant beer, if perhaps a little simple. Still, this is a nice spring beer."
"HV"
"Pours a foggy gold corn hue with a full three finger fluffy white head. Some chunky lacing here and there holds on to the sides of the glass throughout. The aroma consists of spice, banana, and Belgian yeast. A good dose of floral hops and pear. An enjoyable nose, light and fresh. Taste starts off with light fruits; white grapes, green apple, and pear. Midway the dry hops emerge which clearly help identify this beer as an ""American"" saison. The spices linger in the aftertaste with coriander and dry grass. Soft and pillowy feel in the mouth with a strong sting from the carbonation. I hate to admit it, but I pounded this beer. My first from this brewery/project, but I picked up the Baby Tree as well that I look forward to trying. I'm guessing Kiernan brought these bad boys to the 'Cuse, please get more here!"
"The second pouring is as nice looking as the first. The flavors are coming out more as the beer warms with more floral flavor. This is a great Massachusetts beer!"
"overall this was a better than average tasting saison, there is a nice tolerable booze level to it, and I like the fact that another american craft brewer besides Clipper City is brewing one. Cheers."
"Overall solid, good, but not great. A nice representation of the style, though I really do not feel the need to seek it out again. Still though no bad."
"It's nice to have Pretty Things in the Philly area now. I'm looking forward to trying more of their beer"
"Been wanting to try this one for a while. 22oz bottle served in my ST tulip. Bottled March 09 Batch Two indicated on the paper band covering the cap. Poured a hazy golden-orange with a dense, bright white three inch head; excellent retention. Delicate, thin cloud-like patches of lacing coated the sides of the glass as the cap slowly receded. Nose reveals coriander, lemon zest and belgian yeast. Taste is consistent with nose. Some citric acid comes out, as well as some candi sugar - a very nice balance of flavors, but missing some of the characteristic funkiness associated with the style. Mouthfeel falls between light- and medium-bodied with a consistent background effervescence and some astringency detectable around the sides of the cheek. Great farmhouse. Easy drinking, flavorful and all at a 6.4% abv. A bargain to boot at $5.99. Can't wait to try Pretty Things' Quad & Brown."
"Final Thoughts - I was so happy to try this brew. Definite surpise at a tasting, and I had to get more. Next time I visit the store I would definitely try another."
"This is my first beer from this new project and I'm looking forward to trying more as this is a solid effort."
"Enjoyed on tap at a recent beer dinner at Vee Vee, had the bottled version a few times which excellent as well."
"Overall this is a very light saison that's perfect for this time of year. Certainly worth a shot."
"Poured a 22oz bottle into my Tripel Karmeliet tulip. This beer pours a golden honey with a huge, rocky, 3-inch white head that leaves some superb lacing down the sides of the glass. The aroma is spicy. White pepper, coriander, apricots, and a bit of mustiness all come together in the nose. The flavor is biscuity up front, toast and yeast, a bit of orange rind, and a subtle mustiness. The mouthfeel isn't as dry as most saisons but it does have a sharp carbonation that allows the flavor to cut across he palate. This is a very good saison especially for a new brewery. I'm glad to have the opportunity to try it."
"All in all, good stuff. Not in the upper echelon of saisons, but really tasty. I would love to have again."
"This is a decent saison, but not the revelation others have been. The harshness in the finish is a bit a deal-breaker for me."
"D: I'm glad that I traded for two bottles. This seems like the kind of beer that you want to drink fresh so that the hops don't lose their appeal. Well drink up!"
"D- This is a very drinkable beer. I could drink three bombers of this and call it a session, easy. Were I able to get this on a regular basis, I'd buy it by the case."
"Take De Ranke XX, mix it with some Saison Dupont and then finally add the perfect mixture of American hops and BAM... Jack D'or. Really an amazingly well balanced beer. Perfect combo of funk and flavor. Good stuff."
"D - In terms of early-spring beers, it doesn't get much better than this. There are so many flavors here, so each sip is different and exciting. Great job Dann!"
"22oz bottle purchased from Julio's, Westboro, MA. Sticker on the rear states ""First Batch! - Bottled in Nov 08"". Pours crystal glowingly clear, lighter/golden amber. The head is near white, loose, then tiny bubble fim and leaving plenty of scattered ribs and bits of lace. Citrus/grapefruit hoppy nose. Pepper, floral hops, more grapefruit and sweet malts in the taste area. Finishes crisply dry and with more pepper and citric hops finishing the deal. Subtly complex and thoroughly enjoyable. Nice Massachusetts take on the ever enjoyable saison/farmhouse ale style. Well done and well worth trying."
"D: Won't make me forget the great saisons of Europe (nor a few of my favorite US versions - Ommegang, Boulevard, Sly Fox), but still is as refreshing and drinkable as can be. Like the spice, the mild tang, and the creeping sweetness. Would have this again - just feels right to drink here at the start of spring."
"Had on tap at TPH last night, although it wasn't on the menu. Incredibly hazy from yeast with a lively full head. Immense lacing down the glass. Smell was of yeast and lots of hops, wonderful. Taste was classic Saison, dry and sharp with depp complex flavors from around the farm. Mouthfeel was also exceptional, completly surrounding the mouth and tongue. Drinkability is high, as this is sooo delicious."
"A pretty interesting take on the saison style."
"This is a very solid saison, quite enjoyable. It's not the most complex one you'll ever find, but it's well crafted and quite tasty. Definitely worth picking up."
"D - Overall an interesting take on the Saison-style. A highly drinkable blend of Belgian and American characters, this is an easy-to-consume brew."
"Good but quite a bit leass yeasty than most saisons I""ve had."
"Drinkability is very good for such a strong beer. One of the most well-balanced saisons I've ever had that also maintains a lot of good tastes in it. Go find this one and drink it on any occassion."
"Very tasty, not in your face at all but subtlety complex all over which adds to its great drinkablity."
"Has a orange, cloudy look; plenty of yeast suspended in the glass (my favorite!) and pours with a light head that lasted for a surprisingly short period, given what I've seen in others in this style. Hoppy aroma of citrus and peaches, definitely some grapefruit. From the smell I expected more hops in the taste but was happy to note more malt than hops. Nonetheless it had a bitter tilt that added some spice. Bananas in the background, both in aroma and taste. Lightly carbonated; overall a bit thin in the body. Compared to other saisons like Hennepin and Saison Dupont, this is rather a lightweight. But all in all, rather refreshing and worth a second try."
"Briefly starts as a malty beverage but this is completely overwhelmed by a very strong, raw hop flavor. This taste lasts through the swallow and long into the aftertaste. The only negative I feel is the body which is surprisingly thin given the aroma and flavor profile. The carbonation is spritzy which doesn't mitigate the mouthfeel."
"Overall, the beer doesn't do a whole lot for me."
"This is a boring beer, really wish the rest of the bottle was Hennepin or something like that."
"Saisons aren't really my thing, but this is very nice. Excellent smooth mouthfeel."
"Belgianesque in the taste. Sweet malts with little to no hop in the mix. Finishes with a slight tartnesss that that is felt on the back of the tongue."
"Light bodied, nicely carbonated and very drinkable. Glad to have the chance to try this one thanks to BA dmamiano."
"Feel is solid for the style, carbonation keeps it refreshing even while flavorful."
"D: I'm not huge until most Belgian stuff but I really dig this. Goes down easy and is very pleasing. Yes sir, I'll have another."
"After having this one, I was wishing that I had picked up more!"
"D, notes: This is a great bow for the Pretty Things project. Highly, highly drinkable/sessionable. Earthy character really comes out and I think it really defines this beer."
"pours a hazy, golden orange with some really cool snowflake lacing. herbal citrus hops and lemons dominate aroma, while more spices emerge in flavor. a elite session beer."
"Pours a clear golden color with a fluffy white head that sticks around forever. Smells of spicy pine, citrus, Belgian yeast esters. Tastes of citrus and pine, finishes spicy with Belgian yeast esters. Medium body, smooth syrupy mouthfeel, ample carbonation. Strange little saison, a bit hop forward, but it kinda works. I liked it."
"EDIT 2/13/09: i had some more small samples at a tasting with mr. paquette himself. with his explanation of what he was trying to achieve with the beer, i realize i had to think ""out of the box"" for this a little more. i'll bump up a half point each for taste and drinkability. it was certainly very quaffable, especially this second time around."
"Pours bright gold, with a fluffy white head that lasts. It has a pleasant, spicy citrus nose with some belgiany esters. The taste is very lemony, some malt sweetness, and nicely balanced by spicy hops. It is light to medium bodied in mouthfeel. The beer finishes smooth and clean, and is very drinkable."
"Purchased a bottle at Bauer on Newbury St. for $5.99. Bottle has a sticker on the back saying ""Bottled in Nov 2008 - First Batch"". Poured into a tulip glass. Huge head formed and it just lingered there like a snow cap. Hazy golden orange color. Lots of lacing present. Smell was a bit citrus-like, with some spice and hops also. Taste was excellent. Had a Belgian sugary sweetness to it, but it also had a bit of lemon flavor that lent a nice counterbalance to it. Extremely easy to drink. Since I had this on a cold January night, I'll have to pick up another bottle for a warm evening this summer. A great introduction for this new brewing company i.e. ""project""."
"Great job Pretty Things!"
"Quite a nice debut by Pretty Things.... I look forward to more..."
"D: very good."
"the drinkability is good, it's got a lot of complexity, but maintains a subtle profile. very, very nice, i hope to see more of this"
"The taste is a bit more tart, more acerbic, and slightly less sweet than I would have anticipated from the nose. That is not to say that the beer is not sweet, because it is. This is a very characteristic Saison beer, with lots of carbonation, champagne like yeasty fizz, lots of apple and rind in the taste. The beer has some orange notes, some spices in the coriander family, and a peppery spice and bite in the finish. This is a refreshing, fizzy beer with a bit of an ABV burn in the mouth to let you know that this isn't a light summer ale."
"Overall: Excellent brew. Everything about this beer screams quality. The malt is sticky, but not nearly overbearing. The hops are fresh and delicious, providing a wonderful compliment to the crisp saison tang. A refreshing beverage to say the least, and an amazing first offering from Pretty Things and Dann Paquette. If this beer was white wine, it would easily fetch upwards of $100 a bottle. Yes, it's of that caliber. On a separate note, I want to know where Dann gets his hops; these are unreal."
"Pours a nice orange hazy body and bubbly white head. Smells of fresh hop flowers that you just crushed between your fingers to smell, fresh orange peel, and some citrus zest. Taste: hmmmm a bit bitter from the hops, the bitterness dominates the pallet at first, followed by the smooth sweet malt. Some hints of fruit in the middle followed by a spicy finish. This beer has a lot of flavors battling it out, maybe some age will mellow them out and they will play nicely. Although the more I drink the less I notice the battle of flavors. All in all, a hint more balance would be nice (again, maybe aging). Mouth feel has lots of good carbonation that evaporates the beer on your tongue, but the beer has a dense unfiltered characteristic. That may sound contradictory, but true. As for drinkability the first bottle is great, but it's a big beer, heavy beer, so full of flavor that I would not say it's a session beer. Overall a great beer, as the bottle says this beer is an American saison due to it's much more flavorful characteristics from the Belgian style. If the brewer does a higher alcohol version we might have an imperial saison on our hands. Now start bottling shaherizad!!! (and send it to Baltimore)."
"Poured into a imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" off-white head over the almost clear golden amber brew. Pillowy head lasts well, streaming tiny bubbles keeping it going, with ample lasting lace. Aroma is doughy with light spice notes. Taste is moderately sweet, citrus in the middle and wisps of spices here and there. Mouthfeel is amazingly smooth, and drinkability is excellent as well. Nice place to start for this project of Dann's."
"Refreshing. It's spicy and hoppy, but balanced by a nice sweetness that doesn't overpower. I could have had a few more of these."
"This is a great brew from a great brewer and a really nice guy. I will have this on my shelves in my store as well as in my home a very solid brew."
"My first review, after talking about starting for ages. I picked this bottle up at Gordon's Liquors in Waltham MA. Sticker on back says first batch, bottled November 2008. The beer is cloudy with a solid head which settled down nicely. Very smooth, with a little bite at the end. I taste a hint of cloves, lemon, and tangerine. Very drinkable, and will definitely be picking this up again. Looking forward to more offerings from this brewer."
"I like this - good mix for a Saison/Belgian IPA. Very clean."
"Extremely drinkable. I flew through my pint of this."
