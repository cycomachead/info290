"A very unique beer. It's close to what I thought it would be and it didn't let me down. A nice risky take by CCB. Solid and worthy. I wouldn't give up much in trade, but still worthy."

"The beer pours an orange-amber color with a large white head. The aroma is classic saison, with some strong biscuit malt notes. There is also quite a bit of tartness, lemon and light funk. The flavor is similar. The biscuit and toffee malt go very well with the wheat and a little bit of tartness. The light acidic notes work very well and add to the beer’s drinkability. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."

"D/O: Although fruity, the guava component is far surpassed in degree of influence by the characterful but confused yeast and other fermenters. It comes across as the sort of sour that makes one wonder if they meant for this to happen. Challenging even in small doses, it is difficult to imagine working all the way though a pub-style serving of this misguided beer."

"Overall - A great Saison that I'd buy again, but not sure I would trade for it."
"O – I thought the fruit was incorporated pretty nicely into the beer, adding a good amount of sweetness and complexity to the saison. Very refreshing on a warm spring day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I have only had a few Cigar City beers and I have been impressed so perhaps I expected too much but I was kinda disappointed with this beer it is pretty good but I was expecting great. It does have a disnctive yeast flavor with a solid guava presence but nothing really super special flavor for me. I like it, but perhaps I expect too much worth a try for sure though that being said I don't know if I will be back."

"O-a solid Saison. Didn't get a lot of distinct guava flavor,but enjoyed this"
""
""
""
""
"I had high hopes for this one - I like CCB and I like guava-flavored things. I also like saisons. So this is a win-win-win, right? Well, perhaps it didn't quite live up to my godly expectations, but it was still a damn good beer. I enjoyed the saison and funk flavors that come through and pound hard from middle to end - but my main complaint is that the guava (and fruit in general) was too muted, both in the aroma and the taste. Still very enjoyable - very solid saison."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 9/4/2012. Pours hazy orange amber color with a big 3 finger fluffy cream colored head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big pear, apple, lemon, orange zest, pineapple, guava, pepper, clove, floral, grass, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity and spicy notes. Taste of apple, pear, lemon, orange zest, guava, pepper, clove, wheat, floral, grass, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, guava, citrus, pepper, clove, wheat, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a bit. Very nice complexity of fruity and spicy flavors; with great fruity/peppery flavor balance; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Very high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a lightly slick, very crisp, and prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent saison style. Very nice balance and complexity of fruity and spicy notes; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

"I will pick up a fresh bottle on my next trip to Florida for a good comparison."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Wow, really good stuff. I was expecting this to taste artificial and way too fruity. It's a great saison with only subtle hints of fruit. If I lived in Florida I'd take a truck over to Total Wine and but whatever they had left at 2.99$ for 750ml. I guess it's out of season but it still tastes fantastic."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a strongly spiced saison which is quite enjoyable, but the clove yeast phenols dominate and I would prefer more of the guava flavor to come through."
"EdiT...After a glass i have STRONG guava undertones that just linger on the palate. very interesting brew."
""
"I'm really happy that I got to try this one, but my experience did not match what I was expecting. Worth a try if it's in front of you, but nothing to seek."
""
""
""
"O- This is dammed tasty!... A little tweaking of the carbonation and this would enter into a world class level beverage."
""
""
""
""
"I found this beer to very refreshing. Certainly something that could be nice all year round. As I stated earlier, I didn’t really dig the smell and tended to avoid taking a sniff while tipping it back. There’s nothing overly remarkable about the taste, but it was very well balanced and good in that regard. Not sure it’s something I would make a point of picking up again, but I wouldn’t rule it out either."
""
""
"O: Not exactly sure what the ho hum is about. It was a light gusher when it opened and I picked up the medicinal plastic then. The taste has yet to South as far as I know. I only tasted a little plastic behind the scenes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- An interesting saison, I haven't had a lot of experience with guava but this beer seems to capture it pretty well. This is a really unique, tasty beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - this is a really solid saison with the right amount of sweetness. I enjoyed the way the fruit is utilized without an attempt to mask the proper style of beer."
""
""
"O: Nice beer, although a bit different than I expected. A solid saison, although I wish the ABV were a little lower."
""
""
"O: One of the best saisons I've tried. Would drink weekly. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Sweet and tropical, drinks easy."
""
""
"Overall: As with the Cucumber Saison I tried recently, I found that the concept was more interesting than the end product; just too much going on and it never comes together in an appealing way for me"
"Overall, a real nice beer. Tartness is just right for a Saison and the taste overall is nicely complex. Wish the body was a bit livelier but nothing else to complain about."
"Pours hazy, light brown with an orange tint. Fluffy off-white head that leaves some streaky lacing. Nose of sour citrus, funky yeast, and tropical fruit. The flavors are well balanced mix of sour fruits, cellar funk, and sweet malts. Very dry, moderate carbonation, and a puckering, tart finish. Very nice brew."
""
""
""
""
"Guava made an interesting choice to put in a Saison. It was clearly different, but the guava was toned down too much. One bottle was good enough for me."
""
"Smells of grapefruit and strong tropical fruits, which I guess is the Guava, some maltiness. Carbonation is good, not too strong, just right really. It caries the tropical flavors that blend nicely with a medium sweet-dry matliness with an interesting short or 1/2 bitter taste, has a sourness to it. Distinct Guava comes through as it warms. The bitter/sour flavor balances the brew and and provides for a refreshing finish that leaves medium fruit on the dryish pallet. Overall a great beer that I did not want to come to an end."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very pleasing to my palette. All the funkness of a saison but nice sour like qualities."
""
""
"A solid saison by any means. I like the bit of tropical fruitiness in this one. This style can. Get spicy and very dry and this one is less so. Still dry, clean finish, with a medium body and great carbonation. I definitely liked this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a light orange color with lots of head. Aroma coming off the top could benefit from a bit more guava coming through, but otherwise your standard funky farmhouse smell, yeast, fruit, earthy funk. Taste is unique, with a perfect amount of guava coming through the carbonation and yeast funk that dominates the palate, hint of crisp hops at the end. A refreshing beer that would be excellent any time, but especially in the summer. Pretty high on my list of saisons. I'm not sure if they're going to stick with the sour version from now on, but I liked this significantly better than the soured GG."
""
"O - 3.75 - This is a fine saison and pleasant to drink. But for something ostensibly built around guava, it seems to miss the mark. It's just a nice saison. The numby/powdery mouthfeel is unusual and not exactly welcome."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow! One of my favorite Cigar City beers. I wish they would make a more affordable and regularly available saison, because they sure know how to do it."
"O- Cigar City makes some great saisons and this one definitely isn't any different. Nice lightly sweet melon taste balanced with a lightly tart finish. Nothing stood out about this beer for me, but it was definitely an enjoyable beer that was tasty and definitely drinkable. I probably wouldn't seek this one out again, however if I was in Florida I would probably get it. If you like saisons and guava/melons I would recommend trying this one out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An outstanding very sour beer with enough fruitiness and spiciness to call it a saison base. This is a must have beer for fans of sours I just wish it wasn't so hard to find in Upstate NY."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Good, but I wouldn't get it again - just too sweet and fruity."
""
""
"I opened this expecting the worst, but I must say it was a wonderful surprise. Not something that I would drink daily, but I have to have it again. If I were to have had this blind, I wouldn't have guessed it a fruit, or a wild ale; the wild yeast, and guava seem to cancel one other out."
""
""
"im not sure if the brett was intentional or not, but it makes for a pretty decent saison despite the fact that any hint of guava is pretty much non exsistant. however, this could be an older bottle. im probably not going to seek this out again, but id be interested in trying its counterparts."
""
""
""
""
"Glad I tried it and might get it again, but not a huge fan."
""
""
""
""
"O: Great saison and I love the guava twist to this."
"A wild yet refined brew. So many great Saisons in this world, what a great style! From the big bottle purchased at Food and Friends in Philadelphia."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very nice beer to try. The guava is stronger than I expected."
""
"The beer pours an orange-amber color with a large white head. The aroma is classic saison, with some strong biscuit malt notes. There is also quite a bit of tartness, lemon and light funk. The flavor is similar. The biscuit and toffee malt go very well with the wheat and a little bit of tartness. The light acidic notes work very well and add to the beer's drinkability. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Glad I got to try this one."
""
"overall, this tastes nothing like a saison.. more like a cider. never had a wild ale, so this is my first ""sour""... it's not bad, but i don't really get the hype. it's tasty for what it is, but i was honestly expecting more of a saison."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - My first Cigar City brew. I had big expectations from the smell, but the flavors were a little bit sweet and it came off rich for my liking. It probably rates higher as a beer than it does against others in the style, in my eyes. I probably won't be getting this again, but if you like sweeter saisons (rather than dry or funky) give it a try."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, this is a good Saison.  I've certainly had better, and I've certainly had worse. I prefer Saisons that have a bigger tart/sour presence.  But I still enjoyed this one and its worth trying if you are a fan of the style, or if you are looking for a drinkable introduction to the style, as the portfolio is there but its not overwhelming.  "
"Overall: Great saison. Wish it smelled more like guava. Satisfied with the guava flavor once the beer warmed up a bit."
""
"O- I can't drink more than just a few sips. The astringency is just too much. Not the kind of tart I love in a beer. Very disappointing"
"Overall: A solid Saison with a subtle guava flavor."
""
"O - Interesting beer, on paper it sounds super funky. In a glass its entertaining, and a different interpretation of a classic style of beer."
"Overall I really enjoyed this. It's more tart/sour than it should be for the style... But I happen to enjoy that. Will buy again. 4.5"

"Enjoyed on oct´11. Tulip glass.Orangish amber color,copper to the light.Off-white small bubbled head.Creamy froth,good retention.Nice lacing rings & ""snow"" flakes left on sides.Fresh tropical fruit,wet grass,guava note aromas.High sweet upfront followed by an spicy banana & melon flavor.Orange candy in the middle,hints of lemon.Full body,medium carbonation.Rough sweet bitter finish.Earthy mango aftertaste.ABV well hidden.Should be recognize the difficulty when using this flavorful fruit (guava) but,unfortunately,the overall results quite cloying."
"Overall - It tastes good. No off flavors. Nothing I'm amazed by, though. Just a decent saison. I prefer them lighter and more complex than this."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a fine saison. I would be happy to have this again."
""
""
"O: A fun beer to try, but I was not the biggest fan of this one. Above avergae? Yes. Great? No. Good twist for the style, but I've enjoyed others more."
"Overall this was very refreshing and I enjoyed it."
"Serving type: bottle - 750ml"
"I'm really not sure why this isn't called a wild ale. The sour punch from the combination of the yeast and guava is quite nice, but definitely does not taste much like other Saisons I have had. Also, there is just a slight vinegar presence in the taste. Overall, quite enjoyable."
"Mouthfeel is also excellent- medium bodied and well carbonated. The reason I didn't give it a 5 is that to me it could be a little more carbonated (I love carbonation and what makes wild ales is their wild carbonation). This is a great beer however and I would recommend getting it if available."
""
"Highly carbonated, crisp, dry, bitter finish with lingering notes of pepper and guava. Very enjoyable, they nailed this one. Plenty of fruitiness with a very dry finish. Would definitely drink again!"
""
""
""
"I'm not terribly familiar with this style, but I liked the beer a lot. My only regret is that I did not get to pair it with food, as this would be unbelievable with a tropical fish dish such as mango mahi mahi."
"O - Overall this is an interesting beer with nice guava but cant help but wondered if this has soured. Still delicious but clearly not what the initial beer was."
""
""
"O - This beer has a very nice mouthfeel, taste, and drinkability. I enjoyed the plentiful carbonation, which made this beer unbelievably light for the amount of alcohol it possesses. I have to admit though, the unstoppable foaming head from the pour is a bit cumbersome for sure. Beyond this, I have no other complaints and would love to try this refreshing beer again. It's rare to see any Cigar City beers around my area, but I'll be sure to buy more of this brew and other offerings if I see them again in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"very good for the style. i really like this."
"Overall this was excellent. I acquired this one in a trade and now am kinda bummed I didn't get more. Best saison I've tried thus far"
""
"O: Overall, this is an excellent Saison. Personally I like a little more tartness in my Saisons, and less earthiness, but the fruity, peppery quality was great. I couldn't really tell if there was guava in this or not, and not sure how much was actually used for secondary fermentation. Still there is a fruity quality that I am not familiar with that I will probably attribute to the guava. Nicely done. I would drink this again. Alcohol is unnoticeable and goes down too easily."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A tasty beer. Very drinkable. Not sure if I've had a guava or not but this is a nice tropical drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"I would love to now more about this thing. Saison it is not, wild ale? what bugs or yeast did they use? this is a strange one, but I like it."
""
""
""
"O: there are bad fruit infused beers, but this is not one. It's subtle, and it adds to the complexity rather than overtakes the beer. Nice!"
"Delicious beer. I heard they took the sour/funk from this. Too bad."
"I liked this because it was different. The guava was a nice change of pace from all the typical fruits usually put in beer. Overall, though the flavor was one-dimensional and it drinks like juice and finishes like a dry wine. I wouldn't go out of my way for this one."
""
""
""
""
"O- definitely seek this one out. One of the best CC offerings I've had, up there with Zhukov. Very complex and unique for an American saison."
""
""
"O- very good saison. Great blend of a traditional saison flavors with all of the tropical fruits that accompany this beer."
"Overall, this is very good and can stand up with plenty of other saisons."
"Taste is much the same, almost lambic or gueuze-like. Apple skin tannins are rampant. Nice notes of Belgian yeast. Slightly dry. One hell of a saison shared with winbassett and peetoteeto (fullsteam brewery)"
"Gusher alert! Cloudy amber orange hue. Three fingers of white head. The nose is super fruity. Dusty wood, clove banana, guava, oranges, brett, mild lactic sourness. The flavors are just as dynamic as the nose. Sweet fruit, grape big league chew, lactic sour, banana, guava. Light bubbly body. This was awesome. Wish they would make this sour again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Interesting beer from CCB. Glad I got a chance to try this unusual beer. Give this a shot if you get a chance."
"The beer was fairly hard to acquire and had a relatively steep price tag for a saison. It was a fruity and unique saison, but it had a terrible carbonation overload effect on my stomach that detracted from my overall enjoyment. Therefore I'm on the bubble with my recommendation, but you'll probably love it if you love champagne."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I tried reading through the forums, as I remember some discussion of whether this was intentionally sour. I bought this last summer, but don't see a bottle date, so no idea what batch it is. I wouldn't call this a saison, but whatever it is, I really enjoyed it.Hope the tartness isn't absent in current batches."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Another great beer from Cigar City. Very easy to drink, you would have no problem finishing a 750ml bottle on your own. Get it if you can."
""
"Man, if it weren't for the foam, this would be really outstanding as a saison. It's still pretty darn good."
""
"Surprisingly like this more than Guava Groove which supposedly had more Guava. This one is good although I normally don't like saisons."
""
"O: An enjoyable saison to be sure, just not what I was lead to believe from reviews. Could do with more hops presence from a noble hop at 60 mins with say 5-7 alpha acids and dry hopping."
""
""
""
""
"I initially drank this without food and was generally pleased, but not wowed by it, though it certainly grew on me with time. However a second round with some spicy noodles (read: a good amount of Sriracha), and I was immediately hooked. I'm inclined to drink it only with spicy food from now on, but it's nevertheless a solid saison."
"Good stuff from a very good brewery."
""
"O: I can't really explain why, but this beer works. Granted, it won't appeal to those who like a classically styled saison, but it is extremely tasty and easy to drink."
""
"Overall - a fun beer to drink, and without the brett infection/over-carbonation, the beer might have been a real gem. Worth trying, but maybe not quite enough so to seek out actively."
""
""
""
""
"The feel is medium in body and very light and carbonated on the palate. The tingly feel lends itself well to the dry finish. Solid, but as far as the price goes, and the overall quality of the beer, I think that I would pass on this next time."
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
"O - A very average beer. The guava was too subdued and should have played a larger role in the flavour profile."
""
""
""
"Thumbs up"
""
""
""
""
"Honestly, I am impressed with this beer. It is a complex farmhouse-style beer that is fruity/floral and completely drinkable. It has all the trappings for the style and a unique identity in itself. Get on it."
""
""
"O- Overall this is a good beer.  Definitely in the funky/wild subfamily of saisons.  It actually tastes like it might have some brett in it (even though it does not).  It is quite tart in nature .  I like it-but it doesn't have that smoothness or balance that I am looking for.  Its not hoppy at all- but I don't think that it was before aging either.  It has cellared well."
""
"O: A good beer. I think I prefer the Groove because it is a little more intense in terms of the guava. Would have no problem drinking this one again though, and could see introducing people that are newer to beer to this one."
""
"O - My first Cigar City beer didn't dissappoint at all - this is a well crafted, well balanced and well thought out beer. Very super nice."

"O: This is one sour Saison. Unfortunately, I'm not detecting hardly any Belgian yeast, but it's still damn good! Tastes like a sour apple/pineapple/cherry candy. Very unique and quite refreshing!"
"Sip it. Enjoy it. Be kind to it - and it will be kind to you."
"Pours a clear brownish orange with a big white head. The nose is vinegar, guava, banana and clove. Smells distinctly like a sour. The taste is not tart, but more vinegar sour with orange and lemon zest, light guava, banana and a little pepper/clove spice. It's decent, but a little more tartness and guava would go really nicely in here. The mouthfeel is sour and very carbonated. Overall, this beer is pretty good, but makes me wonder what guava groove is like because it has potential. It does seem a bit off style."
"This is VERY unique.. Nice off white head that settles slowly in the tulip. Has the typical farmhouse smell with a clash of different sour fruits. Strong, sweet aroma of apples, guava, and other fruits I can't figure out and tastes just the same with an almost sharp vinegar like end. this beer makes the mouth water after each sip. It's very good and recommend trying it if possible."
"Pours a light copper color with a two finger head into my bruery tulip, great lacing while the head sticks around. Aroma of Belgian yeast, citrus, feint guava and light pepper. Taste follows the nose, nothing stands out intensly but the flavors come together in sweet deliciousness! I love this beer, it's easy to drink and rediculously refreshing. I wish everyone could try this beer"
"O: A super drinkable, tart saison that I'm really finding to be a wonderfully complex brew. Solid work CCB - this one's a keeper."
"Overall: A winner in my book. A really good Saison as the base beer which is given some nice tropical notes with the help of the guava."
"Unexpected sweet sour vinegar on the nose. Taste is sour and sweet immediately. Then a funky tropical bitter nutty dry fruit pits aftertaste dominates the back. As it warms the distinct contrast between sour and dry bitterness makes this a very interesting and unique brew."
"Pours a beautifully hazy golden orange with a massive four finger mountainous head. Looks amazing! The aroma is slightly tart with tons of banana and pineapple. Guava is coming through, but banana and pineapple dominate. There is a decent amount of clove coming through as well. The taste is absolutely incredible. Slightly tart in the front, but banana and clove shine all the way through. Guava and pineapple are present, but take a backseat to the banana and clove. Mouthfeel is medium and carbonation is relatively high. Overall, incredible interpretation of a farmhouse ale. I definitely taste some funk, but nowhere near a traditional Saison such as Dupont. Easy to drink and bursting with juicy flavor. A very unique brew and one that I recommend highly."
"The mix of these two (50/50) was phenomenal. You get the hint of the funk with the guava shining through. Very tasty."
"Overall: Superb beer! This must be one of the most easy drinking, yet complex and flavourful beer I have come across. If I lived in Florida I would drink this stuff every day in summer."
"O- I liked this a lot, moreso then the Dupont Saison. Maltier than any other I've had in the style, and the Guava fruit works to perfection. Unique for the style I feel, especially with the malt backbone. I'm falling for CCB and their brews."
"Overall: A tasty saison. Not as much guava as I'd hoped but still quite good."
"O: I’m really starting to love this style. Beer like this has a lovable combination of refreshing flavors, with complexity, to boot. Excellent brew, Cigar City; can’t wait for Jai Alai and Big Sound."
"O: Unique interpretation of the style. The guava flavor is left to linger way in the back of the sip, which is what I really enjoy about this. I have yet to try something that fails to live up to expectations from this brewery. Huge thanks to DaveHack for yet again sending me an amazing box. A true advocate."
"O: I really like this beer. It's an awesome example of a fruit saison with the funky, sweet, clove, banana, citrus, really nice carbonation, and the guava goes so nice with it."
"Overall a good brew, didn't get any of the hoppiness usually present in saisons but that's ok, I still enjoyed this. Wouldn't mind aging one for a year or so."
"O: Didn't expect this to be so sour, but I'm happy it was. An excellent offering from CCB."
"O: Really good flavor but it was a bit much after a while. Overall really enjoyable though."
"mouthfeel -dry and sugary, not as nice as the latter. decent body, a bit cloying."
"Wow! This is one interesting saison with a lot of funky character. More like a wild ale than a saison for the most part but very tasty and agreeable. Would love to have a few of these on hand. Thanks to mntlover for the opportunity to enjoy this bottle."
"this is a really great take on the style and is rather balanced. I'm a fan."
"O: This is currently my favorite saison. I get turned off by an overly funky/musty saisons, but this brew features the fruitier notes with a refreshing tartness. This is well worth a try, especially if you think you don't like saisons."
"I would take a Saison Dupont or Hennepin any day over this, but I""m glad I tried it."
"Overall: Ok, when I read the label I didn't read anything about ""wild", ""spontaneous", ""funky", ""brett", etc...I read about guavas and Saison and I expected a slightly dry, slightly fruity Saison. What I got was pretty damn sour, and a lot better and more unique than I expected, however, this is NOT a Saison, its an American Wild Ale if anything. Still very good though."
"93/100"
"O: an excellent offering by CCB, I was very impressed with this beer and will definitely go back for some more. It's very unique and nothing I've tried before tastes like this."
"O: Tough to call between 4 and 4.5, a great beer and I liked the unique qualities the guava provided. Highly recommended if you get a chance to try it; rather different than anything else I've had. Definitely different than any saison, but not super different from most American Wild Ales."
"Overall Impression- For my first brew from Cigar City, I'm over impressed! Unbelievable Saison in almost every category, especially from the site of it being poured. Refreshing, spicy, strong fruits and has the good sourness I always look for in a Saison. I'm ready for another Cigar City brew now! Thanks Mark!"
"Overall is amazing! My first Cigar City beer and I'm really looking forward to seeking out more of their beers."
"Pours a cloudy golden color with a thick, fluffy white head that fills almost half the glass. Aroma is almost overwhelmingly strong, to the point where it hits you the second the beer touches the glass. There's a strong acidic citrus smell with a lot of barnyard funk. The taste is extremely tart upfront with a lot of different citrus flavors coming together from the hops and yeast, a strong grapefruit, lemon, and of course guava presence. There's a bit of alcohol heat and yeast esters as well. The sour, tart flavors cover up a lot of the flavors at first, but as it warms up a lot more subtle notes come out. Carbonation is high with a super dry finish, combining with the tartness to make this one a real lip pucker-er. Somewhere between a Wild Ale and a Saison. A nice beer with tons and tons of things going on. Thanks for the chance to try it nugganooch!"
"For the style, this rocks."
"D: A very well done fruit beer. Judging it by style I am less impressed, but it is still a solid brew. ABV is extremely well hidden...very drinkable."
"Pours a murky honey orange with a 2 inch fizzy orange-white head that settles to a foamy cap. Thick streaks of foamy lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is extremely funky and acidic with vinegar and sour fruit aromas. A very mouthwatering smell. Taste is of sour fruits, vinegar, and funk. A subtle guava taste comes through on the aftertaste after each sip. The carbonation level on this one is high with a very crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is more like a sour than a saison. I have read that some of the earlier bottles were infected and I think this may be one of them. However, this is an extremely pleasant beer even with an infection in it. I am glad I got to try this ""version""."
"Very sharp sour beer; it makes an impression but could also have been very drinkable if the edges were smoothed out."
"Drink- A nice beer. I like saisons so I am kinda harsh on them. This was a bit lighter with a semi-crisp flavor and a bit dry. Overall, a really nice crafted saison. I'd love another bottle."
"The body is light and crisp with a king of lingering flavor profile. Overall pretty good here. For the most part I would say I would just grab a regular saison, but this is a tasty treat either way."
"tastes is sharp. broken up slightly by the intense carbonation. orange rind like crazy. this carbonation is too much. too many pennies in the taste. I don't like it."
"O- I like this beer, but it's nothing that I'd freak out over. Of course, i'm not much of a saison lover, though I do enjoy sours as a whole. I'd probably take Le Terroir of this beer 7 out of 10 times and take this the other 3 times just for a change. One of the better saisons for me."
"When introducing people to the saison style, I mention that there is considerably more variance in the spectrum of flavors present from one beer to the next than in almost any other style of beer. Saisons are meant to be funky and a little off-beat, and Guava Grove is a perfect example. Highly recommended -- I'll be buying another bottle soon!"
"Incredibly refreshing and quite astonishingly drinkable for an 8% ABV brew. I wasn't expecting anything quite as sophisticated as this, but this is a beer brewed with fruit done right."
"Really enjoyable."
"O- I like this beer alot. I admittedly am new to saisons and dubky brews but this is great and would love to get this more regularly. I would also like to try the original batchto see how much they differ."
"I like this one; it's a little different for a saison, but good."
"Overall very nice tartness on Flanders level more so then Saison but enjoyable non the less. Just wasn't expecting so much."
"<EDIT> This was the older, sour version. The new one is good, but not THIS good!"
"D: This is almost a perfect summer beer. If I was in charge, I would ask for this in the 6% range vs. 8%, but very easy drinking given the alcohol level. A keg of this would be great for the summer. Highly recommended."
"Overall, pretty light on the palate. Pretty easy to drink as well. Would go well w/ some other light foods or salad. Thanks again to HoptualBrew for this one. Prosit!"
"O: It's always frustrating when you have a beer that you have always wanted to try, and it turns out being compromised in some way. Unfortunately when there is no bottle date on a beer, this can happen. I will seek to give this (among other cigar city offerings) a second chance with a trade directly from the source. I have had a mix of things I really liked, and a mix of things I was incredibly disappointed with. The latter usually being an infected or otherwise compromised bottle. I don't wish to post this review as a form of slander, but it helps me document a negative experience with the hopes of eventually redeeming it. I'll give you another chance Guava Grove, but I won't get my hopes up."
"MF- Medium bodied, but crisp. A heathy amount of carbonation keeps it crisp and feeling lighter on the palate."
"Overall: Still trying to expand my palate with sours beers. Interesting beer, but I don't think that i want to have another bottle of this beer anytime soon."
"This beer was just great. Instead of the extreme tartness and sourness the old Guava Grove presented, this one presented a great Saison funkiness that paired very well with the up-front guava notes to make a delicious smelling and tasting beer. The drinkability is probably the beer's finest hour, if this is still clocking in at around 8%, it's some sort of miracle, since it now drinks like it's a 4.5% beer! Seriously. Try the new Guava Grove. It's really, really good."
"Nice pour into a Russian River snifter glass, pours a hazy orange with a big two finger head that starts to subside after a minute or two, head never totally disappears. With the first smell, Belgian session sort of grassy but then, quickly overtaken by the smell of guava, the finish is almost like I'm standing in a citrus grove. I pick up other citrus fruits beside guava as well, oranges. The taste characteristics almost mirror the smell, farmhouse session up front with the guava coming through strong in the finish. Not like biting into the fruit itself but, the taste you would get from the juice, slightly sour with some grapefruit taste as well. Sour on the aftertaste. Citrus, orange, guava and grapefruit juices mixed together. Nice and crisp, light bodied with balanced amount of carbonation. Great beer to drink on a Summer day!"
"O--This is a good saison. Very representative of the style IMO. Not my favorite Cigar City brew, but for this time of the year in Miami, I enjoyed it tremendously."
"O - 2nd saison of the night and we are two for two with unexpected sours. Really not at all what I expected before opening the bottle. Sour/tartness really gives this a wildness and makes it hard to think of this as a saison. It isn't bad, but certainly isn't going to blow you away either - even looking at it as a sour. Good to have tried it, but I won't go out of my way to find this again."
"Overall: When I was at the brewery, I had the less sour version of this beer. I'm not sure which one I prefer, but this was a nice sour fruit beer."
"O - Liked this beer a lot and hope to get another bottle in the future."
"Thanks to Thirstybird for opening this one up. 750ml bottle served in a Bells tulip. Pours a hazy burnt orange with no head, just a thin, bubbly band around the edges. Some lacing, but weak legs. Nose is pretty fantastic - lots of tropical fruit character, a tartness, cork and medicinal phenols as the brew warms. It actually reminds me a bit of Duck Duck Gooze in some ways. Taste is tart, citrusy, salty and a bit medicinal. These qualities really overwhelm any suggestion of tropical fruit. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a prickly, overly assertive carbonation, acidic and astringent. Overall - if you're expecting a Saison, you aren't going to get any of the classic qualities here. In my opinion, it's closer to an American Wild. It's definitely an interesting brew, but not something I would seek out again. All and all, less sour and tart than medicinal."
"O - Really enjoyed this one and I have had it several times. Like the mix of flavors and really dig how tropical the fruits are. Nice work!"
"O - Nice beer, something that would really hit the spot if I was in the mood for a guava beer. I've heard there was some batch variance in this, but the one I have is worth trying."
"NOTE: I've heard that the recipe for this year has changed fro. Last year to this year. Supposedly last year's was sour and in this years version, the fruity was the driving force. I'll venture to guess that I just had last year's, so I picked up a couple more bottles for comparison."
"The flavor is decidedly more tart than the aroma suggested, but the guava again saves the day with a fruity, juicy balance. Hints of acetone in the finish amplified by a spritzy carbonation level. Body is somewhat thin and, again, the bubbles are massive and numerous--a bit too soda-like for me. Still, a very tasty, very unique beer and a great summer beer despite the 8% ABV. Cigar City has a winner with Guava Grove."
"O: I read another review here that, if I recall correctly, stated very strongly that this really disappointed the reviewer as a potential summer beer but I have to say I really disagree. This is just the sort of thing I would pop open on my lawn chair on a hot summer day (assuming it's served quite cold). Another nice thing about this beer is that I didn't see a big flavor transition as it warmed up so I feel like you can pretty guiltlessly drink this ice cold. Really, super drinkable and pretty delicious with a good mouthfeel. My first cigar city and it has me interested!"
"Overall, I found this beer to be fantastic. It seemed more like a Wild Ale than a Saison to me. This was the major surprise hit at our tasting that night. Tart, juicy, fruit forward and refreshing at the same time. I will definitely be looking to find more bottles of this."
"EDIT: I will go back and try this one again. Got a feeling I got an infected bottle. I know about sour beers, this one had more of a rot thing going on."
"O: good beer but just don't know what it's supposed to be in the beer style world"
"O - This beer is pretty delicious and has some mild sour notes but they are still quite prevalent. The flavors are all very well crafted but work very well together. Good sour and funky Saison."
"Overall, this was a mostly forgettable and just decent beer, but the guava undertones save it from complete mediocrity. I liked CCB, but this wasn't the best offering."
"pours a light reddish/orange color. big white head that sticks to the walls. smell is brett-funkish, with some saison yeast and a light caramel aroma thrown in for good measure. Much more sour than I remember this being on tap. slightly fruity, but the sourness is what really comes through here. Less of a saison than it is a sour beer. Dry as well. Not so much reminiscent of wilds as it is flemish sours. Lively and very carbonated mouthfeel. Overall, this is a strange beer and I don't quite know how to rate it. On draft i remember this being refreshing and fruity and now it's very sour."
"D - Other than the color, this reminded me a little of certain batches of Fantôme (even though that beer doesn't contain guava). I'm told there's no wild yeast used in this beer, but perhaps some snuck in on the fruit skins, as this definitely had some of that character to it. We crushed the 750ml bottle no problem and it was one of the bigger hits of the evening."
"I've had some sour saisons, but this destroys them all. I was expecting a slightly more sweet flavor profile based on the name, but hey, I'm not complaining. This is a great beer."
"This beer pours a sunset Orange in color with a one finger self destructive head. It smells of lightly sweet guava juice with a light tartness. It actually kind of smells like sweet tarts. The flavor is an in your face acidic fruit juice with a dry yeasty finish. I didn't expect it to be this tart after the initially sweet nose. It's solid but lost between a traditional saison and a true sour, which is fine. Overall its an interesting beer and an interesting drink. Mad props to the random customer who passed on the positive karma."
"D/O- Loved it, as did everyone else. Very different. Mmm mmm. Alcohol was well hidden so I poured myself another. Recommended."
"O - Easily the most unique Saison I've ever had! Very well done!"
"Picked up a bomber, and poured in a weisse vase. The beer pours with a ton of foam out of the bottle, but settles into a bright, slightly opaque orange-caramel coloring with a final settle of about an inch of frothy, foamy, big bubbled head. Aromas are astringent, and robust with pepper and coriander spices, a little booze, some citrus sweetness and tangy guava. Body is slick and slightly oily, but with a decent lacing. Flavor is straightforward and tangy fruit sweetness, with orange and peach, ending on the guava again, with a boozey balance. The aftertaste is floral and spicy, with dry and slightly puckering finish. Very tasty."
"Poured into a tulip glass, a completely opaque, murky, burnt orange, with lots of carbonation visible, and a thin white head that receded to almost nothing. Earthy aroma, full of fresh fruit and spice, and a bit of funk. The taste follows the aroma more or less, yeasty, with obvious fruit in the foreground--guava mainly, with peach and apricot also noticeable. Very earthy with spicy tones of cloves and very light cinnamon, and a bit of barnyard funk. Full bodied, chewy, and pretty drinkable, though probably not something I'd go out of my way to get again."
"CHEERS"
"When it poured, there was a huge billowy white head which quickly receded to q slight ring. This beer is orange and opaque. Nothing special. The aroma is very nice. Lots of tropical fruit and a background of saison spice. The flavor is the same, except instead of just thinking tropical, I can specifically pick out the guava. Very nice. Mouthfeel is nice and light, perhaps a mild astringency. Unortunately, this is a bit undercarbonated, despite the large head originally. Very nice tropical summery saison."
"Don't drink and review."
"Really, this should be classified as a fruit beer. It's not like a saison, but I can understand how that was used as the base beer. This is missing the rich, funky spice, though it doesn't have a comparable bitterness - albeit a smoother, fruiter hop character."
"I will definitely get a few more bottles next time i see it!"
"Medium body, decent carbonation, a bit creamy and pleasant on the palate. Definitely a delicious saison, and I like the addition of guava - although I remember this being much tarter out of the bottle than it was on tap."
"Overall this is quite a different saison. It could be refreshing on a really hot day. I found this similar to the Duchesse de Bourgogne but more sour, fruity and tart. I wonder if there are other sour beers out there that are similar but I have not had many to try and compare. Not a bad beer but not sue how I feel about it yet. As the label states it is certainly unlike any other saison I have ever had. I probably won't be buying this one again but it was certainly a memorable experience."
"**Popped a bottle last night, 9/16....I don't think it was Guava Wild, but sure had a funk too. Way more so than the first bottle. Infected I think.... which made it more OK then Great as I was looking for what I had the first time...."
"It's a good beer overall. It's possible some aging would mellow the beer and if that's the case, most of my scores will go up. Though it's got some nice flavors and is enjoyable, it's somewhat difficult to drink because of the tartness and dryness."
"D - An interesting concept with decent at best execution... Neither a hit nor a miss, but would only recommend if you think this may be of interest... Probably my list favorite Cigar City offering to date..."
"O-i feel torn on this beer. On one hand i love the way it looks smells and feels, i also admire the innovation in this beer. On the other hand i am just not in love with how it tastes. Maybe with less carbonation i would enjoy it more but i still think i prefer a traditional saison. I'm glad i tried it but just not my favorite"
"Man, I don't know if i have had a better Saison brewed in america, this is excellent. Even from all worldwide versions i think this demands a seat at the best of table."
"Massive thanks goes out to kkipple for sharing this one while on the bus this weekend! Served from bottle into a Brewvival sampler imperial pint. Poured a hazy yellow orange with a two finger off-white head that subsided to half a finger slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, tart, and sour. The flavor was of sweet malt, tart, sour, fruit, and spices. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonaton. Overall this was an excellent brew. I had this a long time back via a growler and absolutely loved it. Not a lot has changed since this... This is a great brew and the sour/tart aspect really shines through on this one with flying colors. I would never have guessed this was a Saison if I didn't already know. Really glad I to try this one again. Get this one on your palate, you won't regret it!"
"Umm, guava? Light orange color, nice lacing. Off the sweet taps of Rattle N Hum. Yeah, so, I'm not the most familiar with the guava taste, but now I feel like I have a pretty good idea. Very interesting flavor combination. The guava and yeast play a great game, impossible to decide a winner. A little sour, a little sweet, guava fruity. There's a bit of funk in there as well and it finishes surprisingly dry for the initial flavor. Unique has been said before, and it will be said again. Digg it."
"This tasted closer to a sparkling wine than a beer. A very fizzy mouthfeel. The guava comes through nicely. This was in a large pint bottle, but all I needed was half a glass. As suggested in other reviews it could be interesting how this beer ages, it might be smoother, more drinkable."
"Bottle from Whole Foods Tampa."
"Beer is thinner than expected and brighter on the palate than I thought, more solvent, more acetic, finishes super dry, very acetic, very acidic. A little rougher and harsher than I thought it would be. I would like more fruits and less aggressive sourness. Overall it was OK, but I don't think I'd have it again."
"Quite the tasty treat we have here. Great mouth feel, obviously big spritzy, tongue clearing carbonation considering it's a saison. Lovely acidity, light funk, earth, bready malts in the middle, Belgian spice, yeasty, effervescent, tropical, layers of guava, clove, and banana peel. Love the way the guava adds length and depth to the finish. Delicious."
"Orangey brew with a big foamy white head, a lot like a Belgian gold, it lingers. You can smell the tartness in the next room, this brew comes out full force: A fruity funkiness. Taste is overwhelmingly tart, making this a sipping brew. Some sour notes mix in with the guava and the fruitiness of a saison. Definite alcohol presence at the end. Big and unique brew, closer to a true lambic than a saison. Getting some age on this one might do some good."
"This seems to be another ""miss"" in Cigar City's attempts to make a funky, brett-esque beer. Why on earth they are taking a would be nice, guava infused Saison and putting it through their rather awful wild fermenting process is beyond me. STOP doing this - and if you're going to - refine and master the process."
"o - intense and complex on the palate. a great beer and one meant to be shared."
"(D)- A Saison? More like a solid wild ale to me! A great burst of sour and acidic characters with a bigger carbonation level and a nice fruit profile. If the carbonation level was just toned down a bit, this would be very fantastic. The big surprise of our evening."
"Overall, as I said, the taste just isn't doing it for me. The idea is great and the execution in terms of layering and balance is top notch. Just not hitting it off with my palette."
"Overall this is a great summer sipper, may have to get a few bottles."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being medium to high, the higher ABV helps to balance this from being too carbonated or the other way around the Belgian Yeast prevents it from being to sweet/cloying, but I digress. Overall this is a fairly drinkable beer, and one that I will add to my warm weather arsenal; would have no desire for this in the colder months but perfect for right now."
"O- well this is a very tasty brew and I'm totally digging it, that being said its rather far from what I would have expected from a saison. I'm not knocking it I'm just saying."
"We all tasted some apple in it."
"I raised my original overall score since I feel that this will age well with time. The acid level paired with the 8% ABV should allow this to be able to be lain down for a few years. The acrid flavors should mellow nicely."
"Overall- I really loved this beer. I can't believe I have waited this long to try it. I will be ISO'ing!!!"
"O - Very enjoyable to sip on in the afternoon or evening after a long day. Despite its tartness it's fairly easy on the palate. Splitting this into three servings would also yield reasonable sized servings. I'd buy again if I could find it. Would like to try different dry-hopped versions."
"Overall, this beer was not good by any stretch of the imagination. I'm surprised it has been so well received. This is only the second beer I've had from Cigar City and well, I might have a hard time going back if Hunaphu wasn't so incredibly good. I was expecting a saison with a bit of guava added in and well, maybe they overdid the guava. I've already said what there is to say about this one. Very disappointed. I would avoid this. Cheers."
"The beer is a hazy orange with a thick, white head that leaves ample lacing on the chalice. The aroma is simply wonderful. A bouquet of citrus and tropical fruits. The flavor is fruity and fantastic. Well balanced with a subtle yeasty quality. Feels great on the palate. Overall, a terrific beer and something I would really enjoy having again."
"Overall, this is a real winner. Really hope they keep producing it."
"Pours a very nice cloudy orange/yellow color, very nice carbonation, very nice foamy two-finger plus white head, with some very nice thick/creamy sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some nice yeast notes, slight pepper note, guava, bananna's, coriander. The taste is very nice, malty, yeasty, a very nice complex brew. Medium Body, this one is not that hot at all, very nice. This is one fine Saison, good job CC."
"O: Awesome beer the exceeded my expectations. Really digging Cigar City."
"Pours a dark orange with a two-finger pearl white head. Very tart aroma. Sour green apples, guava, also some wheat and yeast. Flavor follows. Quick tart in your face burst of green apple. Kicking tartness. Guava and tropical fruits follow to a lesser extent which add some sweetness to counter the tart start. Some wheat and spice are up next, to a much lesser extent than your average saison. Finishes mellow with a combination of tartness and guava."
"O - A good first Saison for me, very interesting and unique flavor that I will aboslutely be revisiting in the future."
"A very tasty brew indeed. This beer kind of reminded me of my great uncles homemade hard cider. The aroma was super tart smelling and acidic. The flavor was a little tart but mostly sweet, very surprising to say the least. The afterteaste is is fruity kinda like a soft peach flavor. The appearance is rather nice too, it's this orange color that looks appealing with a nice lacy head. An interesting brew without a doubt."
"Pours a cloudy orange with a light, lacy head. Smells of tart fruit and tastes just the same... guava, bananas, little bit of flowery hops. Slightly tart but nicely balanced by a bit of malt in the background. Great example of a saison with some fruitiness to balance it out."
"D: Maybe not an entirely traditional version of a Saison, but a interesting and thoroughly enjoyable take on the style."
"Overall, this is one tasty saison. The guava plays well with the base beer and it goes down easy. I would definitely recommend this if you like some sweetness or fruit presence in your saisons. Hopefully I can get a taste of the Jolly Guava sometime in the near future."
"Tremendous sour beer. I just hope they can produce more of this to make it a flagship beer."
"D: For how tart this beer is, the underlying sweetness makes it easily drinkable. The crisp and dry finish is quite enjoyable and the carbonation seems to be at an appropriate level. Very nice."
"D: This one caught me off guard. Very delicious beer. Unexpected tartness combined with a good, but not overdone fruit flavor. Seek this out"
"This is definitely a strange beer; I get the feeling this is quite variable from batch to batch. The acetic acidity is a bit out of place, even though it is relatively soft; actually a lactic tartness would have worked really nice here (and would have been more in line with the other Saison notes). This beer is certainly enjoyable, but the acetic and the viscous body make this a bit of a departure from the type of Saisons that I usually prefer (dry, some times lactic tart); the viscous character must be coming from the Guava (or some wild bug). The label is certainly correct in that this beer has some unique flavors to it."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being high. Overall it was a pretty solid beer. The sour and tart flavors mixed very well together and helped balance each other. I really liked the fruity, guava flavors it had. Very enjoyable beer to sip on this evening."
"This is my first rating with the new OVERALL rating system. Overall, this one obliterates!"
"O: One of my favorite Cigar City beers and one that is quite easy to drink, despite a rather high ABV."
"D- I enjoyed this. I dont think it held many characteristics of a saison, but found this to be a good sour."
"O: I love this beer. anyone want to trade for one? wish this was distributed in CA!"
"A very unique saison, which works far better than it should. I might expect something like this from Fantôme in fact...though the yeast is a bit more restrained/commercial by comparison in this beer. Very much worth tracking down for lovers of the style who want something original/different..."
"D: I really enjoyed this one. Not for the faint of heart and reminded me more of a sour then anything. Very good. Would definitely get another bottle to have in the summer."
"mouthd...sour stinky bright and shiny guavaed lemons...taffy and grapefruitish...wowowowowow..i could drink this all day...goes right to the cheeks...quite malty...up there in carbonation...bubble gummy...all things that are good..."
"This is a medium bodied brew that is excessively carbonated and very prickly on the tongue. The bubbly aspect of this brew is fitting for the style but kick it back dialed down a bit would be great. The 8% abv in this brew is honestly not hidden at all, it packs a punch like it is swinging at a level above 10%. Overall this brew is a winner, it's interesting and enjoyable and I would like to have it again. However, ""naturalists"" of the style might forsee the guavas contribution as unwelcomed or taboo."
"D - like this beer a lot -- it's easy to drink and could serve as a segue/gateway into the wonderful world of sours"
"Pours a hazed orange gold color, big plume of prickly white bubbles, good retention and lacing. First whiff brings sweet, watery and puply guava, touches of other fruit souch as apricot and papaya, a bold sour and tart funkyness unexpected, hints of dried hay, light spicing and yeast. First quality noted in the sip is the somewhat strong tart, sour and funky acidic quality, the guava is still the star but the presentation here has me questioning saison as the label states. While not as strong as say a Cascade sour, still a balance of sweet, pulpy and watery fruit and a funky tart and sourness star and overshadow much of the rest of the beer - but i want to stress all this is said in a good way. Fuller side of medium bodied, coating and slightly lingering on the palate. Again, not as i expected (lightly fruited and delicately funky saison) but a pleasent suprise."
"I like the beer in general. Drinks way easy and has nice dry fruit flavors. I am a bit snobby with my saisons as I like to taste some yeasty goodness. This beer really doesn't display that. With that said, very crisp and clean beer, very enjoyable."
"D: When I saw this at DeCiccos I was intrigued but was not going to buy it. When I talked to one of the guys there he recommended it and said it was like nothing else. He did not speak untruths. This really is a singular beer. The guava works so well with the saison to bring out all those fruity esters. I am still stuck on the yeast. One sip screams Fantome then the next something less obvious like a US saison yeast with a bret secondary. Really well balanced. A must try."
"D: For 8% ABV, it drinks like a 4% beer. This would be an awesome food beer! 4/5"
"750ml bottle. Murky orange-tan, with a medium foamy head (served too cold). Sweet guava aroma...apricot, apple tones with some funky yeast tones as well. A complex beer. Sour and fruity. Tart wheaty dryness balances out some of the richness. Belgian-like effervescent mouthfeel. Soft and slightly oily texture. Big and rather brutal at times with its fruity pungency, this is completely original and uniqiue."
"A very interesting beer. As I got into the bottle, it became more challenging and jowel-watering. A sipper for sure. Don't know if the sourness was intentional, but it's a bit over the top. The fruit character is nice but not screaming ""Guava!""."
"had brought out a plate of Maytag bleu, Midnight Moon goat cheese, some raspberry jam, and rum soaked dates with small dish of crackers. The earthy, mouldy nuances of the beer and the bleu cheese and raspberry jam went wonderfully together!"
"Drinkable in the sense of wanting one again. Just not immediately."
"D - While extremely novel (think Flemish Sour / apple / saison), the profile carries a lot of flavors that just didn't sit well on my palate."
"D: Good overall, I was surprised by the tartness in this, I suppose I shouldn't have since it is a saison. The fruit is mellow but noticeable, and not artificial."
"i don't know what this beer is, or where it fits...but i don't really feel like it falls into the category of saison!!"
"the bitter taste hit me right away with a hard carbination follow, which faded fast and left a silky guava taste. Its not as fruity as I thought it would be and am a little let down by that. If I could get over the initial bitter taste i'd like it so much more. I might be off in saying this, but I feel it borders on a sour."
"D: its delicious now, but i can see it gettin heavy towards the end. glad i have someone to share it with."
"drinkability is pretty good. hides most of its alcohol. interesting fruity character. a cool funky and fruity saison."
"Just the slightest of haze in the bronze colored liquid. A very thin head forms and quickly goes away. Not much for lacing. Looks like it suffers from a lack of carbonation. Very interesting aroma. A combination of tart and spice. The guava is readily apparent along with hints of tropical fruit. The flavor was not as impressive. A little tartness upfront with plenty of fruit flavors. Finishes with some spice notes. The saison gets a bit lost under the fruit. The body suffers from very low carbonation. Feels thin as well. I like a little bit more life out of this style. Besides the carbonation issues, the flavor just did not click with me. That is something carbonation is not going to fix."
"Overall impression: I didn't really pick up a whole lot of guava, but this was pretty enjoyable."
"Drinkability: This is pretty tasty and unique, and in a really good way. I could easily sip on this for an entire night, and think it would be great to enjoy in the summertime as I feel it would be very refreshing with all of these fruity flavors going on."
"A bit more sour than a regular saison but still pretty tasty."
"For some reason, Mike kept on calling this thing ""Guava Groove"". Honestly, like him, I think it's a slightly better name. It pours a cloudy earthy amber topped by over a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises tart blood orange (the smell set off some of my taste buds), lemon, grapefruit, and a mild helping of Brett. The taste holds notes of lemon, mandarin oranges, a vague tropical fruit that we all agree must be the guava (I've never had one, so I don't know what it necessarily tastes like); then a wave of brine and vinegar; and then nothing: The flavors just die away, leaving my tongue wondering what the hell just happened. The body is a light medium, with an active carbonation and an incredibly dry finish. Overall, what could have been a really nice experimental brew turned out to be a slight miss. The saltiness near the end, the disappearance of any and all flavor at the end, and the overt carbonation all turned me off. I'm not a fan here."
"This beer appears a cloudy burnt sienna with a white foam adorning the surface. This beer is nice and fizzy which truly helps. The smell of this beer has the tropical fruit aroma from a distance. Though if I didn't know it was guava I probably wouldn't have guessed it seeing as I don't have much experience with the fruit in my life. There is some lemon and funk to go along with it. Has the smell of older applewine. The taste is a spicy fun light tart flavor. I think it's a rather pleasant sour when you are prepared for it due to the tartness only being involved with fruit flavors. The mouthfeel is a light medium but the higher level of carbonation gives an almost champagne like feel to the beer. I thought I might not enjoy this beer but I truly did."
"Overall, I would recommend Cigar City Brewing's Guava Grove Saison for anyone seeking a uniquely enjoyable and bold take on the traditional saison. Granted, my saison experience is limited but if they all taste this good, I'm going to need more."
"Drinkability- typical drinkability for your average saison"
"D: First Cigar City that I really liked. It has this complex, multi tropical fruit taste notes that a brew from a hot climate location should have. It's balanced for all that's going on. Finally I at least understand the legion of CC fans, and it's their beer that I look for in the future."
"All in all, this is a solid brew, especially for the sour fan. I think people who like some good balance in a puckering sour would appreciate this the most. Me, not being the best judge of sours, still thought it was a solid brew. I would definitely try this one again. Kind of reminds me of Raspberry Tart blended with a Monster energy drink and hints of wine. That probably is not the best comparison, but first things that pop in my mind when I taste this."
"had another bottle with date 4/20/2011 on it. this time around it had way more saison character and a very healthy dose of spiciness from the yeast. nose was full of pepper and clove as well as fruity esters coupled with a beautiful real guava scent that had sweet and tart character to it. much drier and way less tart than i remember. taste actually had a lot more going on and seemed a bit more like saison to me. still a fantastic beer."
"Drinkability (2.5): Huge, funky and fruit flavors make this beer quite tasty, but not that drinkable. Half of the magnum was enough for me right now, but I'd definitely have it again."
"D-oddly enough i found this to be a drink hard to put down. something about the taste...i feel it slowly became more loveable as the drink went on, i'm sure glad i drank all 750mL of this bottle with out help. This is the first sourish beer that struck my heart in this way. Maybe it'll be a gateway of some sort to more sours. It was a big expensive bottle, but I hope to buy more at some point."
"Tartness came at our noses right when the cap was popped. Hazed orange amber with some light sudsy action. Big, fruity, tart aroma with a quick pull of malt in the back. Modest smoothness, was expecting crispness. Tartness wants to put the boot to the throat, but pulls back quick enough to unveil a unqiue fruitiness ... the guava jumps up and does a crazy wave at the palate with both hands. Malt and yeast clutch each other with a nutty, earthy, lovely mess. Alcohol warmth in the back slowly grows in the dry finish. Some controlled chaos that grew on us."
"D= I think this is very drinkable wouldn't want a six pack but the bomber is great and I would drink it again really liking the brews of Cigar City right now."
"M - Fizzy carbonation, light creaminess."
"I found this to be a really nice drinker. Assertive in all the right places and playful in all the rest. This would be a welcome addition to my fridge anytime."
"D: Really enjoyed this one and could imagine drinking this one on a great summer day. Solid offering from CCB."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and is quite refreshing; no traces of alcohol are perceptible in the smell or taste."
"HB42's notes: too sour, ""very interesting", ""I don't know about this beer, man"". Yet he drank most of it haha."
"An excellent Saison. The guava fruit complements the Belgian yeast perfectly. I can imagine a lot of my non-beer drinking friends and family thoroughly enjoying this. Very delicious and refreshing. I'd highly recommend picking this up if it's in your distribution."
"D - very interesting beer here. I really enjoyed this offering quite a bit. Luckily I split this bottle, otherwise the sourness would have gotten to me after a while. I wish I had more, though."
"D- The guava makes it fun but the carbonation is tough to deal with so maybe let it air out for a bit upon pouring"
"This is drinkable and will be enjoyed by your non beer loving significant others or friends. Somewhat one dimensional and juice like."
"Thanks Dei and Alex!"
"d: very drinkable. Like I said I would have never known it was a 8% beer drinking it. Very fruity/tart/dry makes for a easy drinking beer."
"The aroma is lightly floral but then the guava dominates going forward, too strong for me. Slightly musty with a touch of sourness...The taste comes across as juice to me, very weird. Floral but way too much guava to me, not a fan of this."
"It would have been nice if they added some hops to this beer. Perhaps that's what could have saved it."
"I really wanted to like this beer, liking more saisons, and various sour beers, but there is too much of a vinegar-like taste for me in this beer. I split this with a couple of friends, and we didn't manage to finish it all."
"After having mixed reviews over the Cigar City offerings I've tried this one tips the scales in their favor. A very unique, refreshing, summer beer."
"D- This beer has good decent drinkablity but is definate a sipper due to the tartness."
"Cool looking 750ml bottle, thanks Hopscotch! Pours a really pretty, slight hazy orange with a huge head. Surprising, vibrant nose of sour citrus fruits, especially limes. Wow, really nice. Flavor is a bit yeasty with an interesting sour fruit kick to it, a little stone fruit. Not really a bretty or wild sourness, but focused and sharp. Good but not overly complex and slightly ""plasticky"" toward the end of the bottle. Still, I'm definitely impressed with this brewery so far."
"Pours a light copper-orange color with a white head. Starts out fairly large but falls a bit and leaves only a moderate amount of lacing. The nose brings forward straight-up guava along with quite a few earthy notes. A bit musty. The saison character combines really well with the guava. The taste is similarly excellent and all I could ask for in addition is that this always be the Jolly Pumpkin barrel-aged version of the beer. Great feel with some nice yeast notes. Drinks quite well; a nice Florida saison."
"D: The drinkability was good despite this being in the high end of abv for the style."
"D-Its a sipper for sure, and one is enough."
"Pours a hazy bright amber color with a three-finger frothy white head. Great head retention and lacing. Strong tropical fruit, pineapple, yeast and tartness on the nose. Flavor is dominated by lightly tart guava and other tropical fruit. Lightly bitter finish that is a bit too truncated. Medium-bodied with higher carbonation, a slightly sweet finish and not much alcohol warming. Very drinkable stuff though it's not particularly complex. Really good and unique stuff overall, well worth seeking out."
"Pours a very nice orange and yellow color with a medium sized frothy 3 finger head. Retention is on the short side but there is a nice amount of lacing left on the glass. really has a burnt orange color. The aroma is very tart, almost like a sour in a way or a berliner weisse. has an acidic quality that leaves off being borderline nailpolish remover in its esthers. The flavor is bitter grapefruit pith, lemon peel and some bitter orange juice. refreshing nonetheless and probably perfect with seafood dishes but its not really too classic to the style in this sense. I get the guave a little bit, but nothing significant enough to detract from the harsh bitterness. Mouthfeel is crisp and light, dry finish and a lingering acidity. Overall this is pretty good. Flavors arent classic saison flavors for me, but its got the backbone of a saison with the acidity of a berliner weisse. highly drinkable given the high abv. cheers!"
"D: Cigar City has hit the mark with this one. It reminds me more of a guava lambic than a fruited saison. No matter what they deem it, it is a damn tasty brew that can hold its own against 3 Fonteinen and Cantillon, and at a third of the cost! I recommend serving this in a white wine glass along with apple slices topped with strong blue cheese drizzled with orange blossom honey."
"Overall a very nice beer for this style and since its the first(full bottle) of this style that I have tried, I say awesome job Joey and Wayne! oh, speaking of this style, They make another farmhouse called seabass farmhouse. <<Had a small sample of it there at the brewery"
"D - Very much so. I polished off the 750ml bottle during the football games. I'm finding farmhouse saisons are becoming a favorite style. While this isn't quite Hennepin it is good, and even better if you happen to like sour beers."
"Poured a 750ml into my Hennepin globe. This beer pours a turbid burnt orange with a bit of suspend yeast. Really is a beautiful color for a beer. A bright white cap disappears into just a thin line on top of the beer. Quite a bit of lacing is left on the sides of the glass. Great looking beer. The aroma if fairly heavy on the guava. Light pear with just a hint of ripe berries. Quite a bit of spice including some fresh ground pepper and clove. Just a mild bitterness to the very end of the aroma. The flavor profile is a bit similar. Guava up front. Fresh ripe berries and just a bit of pear. Quite a bit of spice. There is a odd bitterness that lingers on the palate. It kind of inundates the the whole mouth. Also just a hint of sourness. I dont know if its intended or a by product of the brewing. Just not a huge fan of the flavor profile of this beer. The mouthfeel is spot on for a Saison. Nice and dry, fairly yeasty. Spot on. Really, this could be a spectacular beer is it wasn't for the sourness/bitterness that just dont seem to fit."
"Overall: Highly recommended. Excels as a sour beer and a fruit beer."
"Drinkability: Quaffable."
"D: Great nose, great flavor, good drinkability. All other ratable categories are below average. Still, I think the Guava Grove Saison deserves a better score than the 3.85 that I've given it. Seek out a bottle for yourself, but try to find a better price than I found."
"Overall this is an interesting take on a Saison. Worth trying, especially for tart/funk fans."
"It's been three years since I had a saison, and now that I'm more keen to different beer styles, I was excited to try this. Pours a murky burnt sienna tone with a light beige head that left excellent lacing in my Stone IRS glass. Smelled a bit like vinegar with tropical fruits, clove, and allspice. The guava truly stands out, with bready malts, sour citrus, and clove/banana notes. Smooth body with low carbonation and a sour aftertaste. Due to my inexperience with this style, and the funk inherent in the style, it took awhile to finish the bottle, but it wasn't too hard to polish off. I'm glad I got another shot at a saison, now that I know not all Belgian-style beers taste the same."
"Drinkability: Drinks well."
"Overall: Very good representation of the style with a unique twist. I would recommend trying this if you see it."
"Overall, a really unique and balanced saison. The guava is there without taking over the beer and everything matches really well. Definitely recommended. I can't wait to try more Cigar City beers."
"Very drinkable, and at 8%, Cigar City has yet another beer where the alcohol is almost non-existant."
"salud!"
"Mouthfeel is smooth and light with a creaminess imparted from the carbonation. Really enjoyable and refreshing as well. Well, this is just a damn fine beer and I would gladly drink this again. Cigar City continues to impress me. Well worth seeking out!"
"Not my favorite style, but this is a great take on the style. Perfect for South Florida."
"Drinkability: It really started to grow on me by the final sips (perhaps it's just the alcohol taking advantage of me) and was an overall interesting experience. I guess, technically, you could say it IS one of the best guava beers on the market today, as I can only think of this and the others from CC."
"I might buy a case of this to have on and off."
"A really excellent beer."
"D - Really good saison. A bit sweet to drink a lot of in an evening, but a quality saison. fans of sofie should definitely seek this one out. you'll be pleasantly surprised."
"Many thanks go out to bobby8405 for sending me this beer. It pours out a glowing hazed orange with just a small lacing of white. The nose is screaming with guava and other tropical fruit such as orange, pineapple, mango and lemon. More guava from the taste, with slight funk and sourness, finishing on a dry champagne note. Having had this before out of the bottle, this one comes off more sour right from the tap into the swing top bottle I received. Mouthfeel is medium bodied on the palate, coming off sweet and juicy, yet sour in many places. The alcohol can barely be felt on this brew, but the flavors make it so appealing that it should be sipped for a while. If I had this one available to me around here, I would be partaking on a regular basis. This is one of the best creations from Cigar City in my opinion. It takes all the best elements of a Saison, and infuses it with complex, yet completely approachable fruit flavor. I imagine this brew will remain on my wants list for some time to come. Cheers"
"Awesome Saison. Loved it and will have it again."
"d: this one does a nice job of quenching my thirst. I wouldnt consider this a true saison and think it belongs in the wild ale category but this is certainly a beer that i would like to have again"
"Overall, an intensely fruity, interesting take on a Belgian Saison. The level of fruit and tartness was unexpected, but were balanced and made for an interesting beer-drinking experience. I wouldn't want a steady diet of this beer, but it was a unique, very drinkable take on a style I love."
"Overall, this is a great saison with some amazing fruit flavors. Easy drinking and I want more of this one. A solid seasonal from ccb!"
"Drinkability- Really dug this one quite a bit. It's got this light tart thing behind all the funk that I'm really loving. The beer is super drinkable and would make a great beer to steam some clams in. Thanks much Jeff!"
"Top notch saison."
"Very nice saison, in fact one of the better ones I've had. Normally I don't even purchase this style, but I figured I'd give it a try. Props to CCB for a very nice beer."
"Pours a hazed golden grapefruit color with a quickly dissipating off white head that fades to a thin ring of bubbles with a few specks of lacing. Plenty of sediment left in the glass as well despite a careful pour. Aroma is fruity and mildy...wild? Also a slight solvent pinch in the finish. Not really picking out any particular fruit in the nose, other than sweet, juicy citrus in general. Flavor thankfully delivers on the guava right up front along with some tangy tangerine but has a fairly weak traditional saison presence (yeast, spice, mouthfeel, earthiness, etc). Mouthfeel is fairly thick and smooth with light carbonation, almost syrupy. Finish is drying, with a lingering citrus rind and seed flavor. I enjoyed this beer much more than my scores reflect, but I found it very one dimensional and disappointing as a saison. Recommended, but with tempered expectations."
"D- I'm gonna by a few more bottles of this one and that the best endorsement I can give. Great creation in brewing by Cigar City."
"Even though Guava Grove is not the guava-centric and guava-licious brew that was expected, it's still an enjoyable BSPA-saison hybrid from Florida's most acclaimed craft brewery. Thanks to ktrillionaire for this bottle and for another bottle from the Summer 2010 release. Hugely generous, he is."
"Bottle courtesy of cyrusthepup on BA as an extra in a trade. Glorius copper amber color with a tight white head and collar. Smells almost like a wild ale to be honest with outstanding fruit characteristics. Fruity and matly. A very good taste in my opinion. Fruity, tart, wild, barnyard flavors with actually what seems to be a touch of acetone notes. This is one that I would suggest not missing out on and seeking out."
"1st cigar city brew big thanks to dimenhetfield for this great trade. Pour is not so great for a saison, even with a hard pour. No real head, kinda murky looking and opaque dirty straw tan color. Smell is nice however, unique, a little sour smelling and fruity. I don't know if there is Brett in this beer but there should be (thats what it smells like at least). The flavor is also nice. Very fruity and yeasty, slightly funky flavored like a little hay and straw. Guava is surly there. Prolongued kinda fruity sour aftertaste but not bad. Good mouthfeel, its a dry and sour aftertaste, the beer itself is a little flat and stale in your mouth but somehow works for the flavors. The flavors in this beer don't really yield it to be that sessionable but I am so happy to have tasted it. I would have it again if I could. And oh yeah-reviewed as part of my summer saison saturday thing."
"I've had this guy a few times in bottles but I wanted to wait to write the review when I had it on tap. Served in a 6 oz snifter it poured a bright yellow. Good white head on top. The smell hits with a pungent ripe fruit smell. The one that tilts your head back a little. I went straight in for the kill though. The taste is glorious. The guava and the saison style should get married. I really like this beer. nice ripe guava, and mango flavors, with a little bit of the bitterness really made for a fun start at the tasting room."
"Notes: Guava makes a great addition to a saison. I'm a believer."
"D-The drinkability is stellar. After a small amount of warming this beer is soo balanced and smooth as well as flavorful and intricate. By far my favorite saison."
"Pours a very hazy amber with two finger creamy offwhite head. Smell: musty, sweet, earthy, my expectation of champagne soaked banana, nifty. Taste: yeah definitely get the guava, imo like an acidic papaya, tart almost vinegary but with a background sweetness. Very interesting, very fruity but one of the tartest saisons I've had. Pretty good, I'd definitely try it again... would actually be great for cooking but I'd rather drink it."
"Drinkability - One of the better saisons I have had, and definitely right down my alley. Very glad ShadesOfGray suggested this beer in our trade. Alcohol is unnoticeable and this beer is immensely refreshing on this hot night. Can't wait to open the Warmer Winter I was sent - I'm going to try and wait until it gets cooler here but we'll see!"
"Notes: Awesome summer beer, and a real nice change of pace from CC. Amazingly drinkable, and alcohol is seamlessly hidden"
"sweet and sour and slightly creamy. not to bad attal. not amazing but good. really i'm not the biggert fan of saisons but this one is kind of good. something i have never really tried before. i could probably have more than one of these but it really is just a touch too sweet. either way i am happy with it."
"D: Reasonably easy drinking, but the sweetness becomes a bit too heavy after a while."
"hint hint to the CC team ;)"
"Consumed: 7/31/2010"
"Drinkability:This is a really unique fruit beer. Refreshing and exotic."
"Overall this beer was pretty good and I'm glad that I got to share some with my wife because I think the whole 750ml bottle would have been too much for me. I really enjoyed the tart acidity taste that came along with the huge guava flavors and the beady finish. Again, I want to give one final thanks to Greg for sending me this beer and the glass for tonight's review. I would say if you get a chance to trade or if you come across this beer go for it because there really isn't too many fruit beers out there (besides lambics) that can take a great style like this and make it not over powering with the fruit"
"D-Very nice, it goes down pretty easy"
"D-the nose is a decent representation of the style but it is far too sweet in the taste with touch much malted barley."
"I poured from a bomber into a snifter. It pours a hazy peach yellow with a fizzy white head, quickly recedes. The nose is full of juicy tropical fruit, pineapple and guava. The flavor is sweet and dry. Pineapple and guava shine, followed by a drying sweet finish. There is a bit of wet hay/funkiness in the finish. The beer is light bodied, and highly carbonated and very vinous. A very good saison."
"D: This is my first foray into Cigar City Brewing company and I enjoyed it. If they upped the carbonation levels to lighten the body, it would've firmly held a spot in my top ten beers of all time."
"HV"
"This beer is perfect for a hot Florida summer night great job Cigar City really enjoyed this one."
"Pours light golden orange with a large white head with good staying power. Lacing isn't heavy, kinda' soapy. The nose is sour tropical fruit, spices like pepper, clove, yeast and some funk. Taste is tropical fruit, some sourness and some hops and yeast The guava is there, albeit faint. The mouthfeel is a bit on the thinner side of medium, creamy with heavy carbonation. 8% abv is certainly not what I would have guessed. Although certainly not my favorite Cigar City offering, it was interesting and I will try it again."
"Massive fruit flavor in this, low carb too, approaching a nearly viscous nectar. Sweet and savory, not quite tart, succulent with a very soft feel and dominant fruit flavors from the guava. Earthy fruit pith, very pleasant. So quenching and perfect for summer or any weather. I could drink much more of this..."
"Overall very, very good example of the style here and another winner from CCB. Would do this one again any day."
"Drinkability is pretty good, straddling the fruit beer experimental quality with classic saison characteristics that I cherish."
"D - I have cracked so many of these at tastings over the past year, it has never once failed to impress. Indeed, on many occasions it stole the show. A phenomenal beer; a masterpiece. And this particular bottle I am finishing now is not only one of the very few that remain(ed) out there; it is also one of the best I've opened."
"D: Far too easy to drink any day, whether on a dreary soaker (like the one last winter when this arrived) or on a sun-drenched beauty like today. Delicious, worth seeking, I'd love to have again...yadda yadda yadda... Thanks Seb!"
"HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!"
"D: Very, very enjoyable. I loved how this tasted like the part of the guava that's closest to the rind. Slightly sweet with a definite tart and tangy edge."
"Cheese pairing note: I tried this with a Bucheron, and it wasn't very successful. The beer's acidity seemed to diminish in the presence of the acidic goat cheese. This cheese needs a beer with more acidity."
"F: Still pretty dry, more lingering barnyard funk with malty saison flavors lingering, quite spicy with a touch of alcohol burn. A touch of the tropical fruit also sticks around with some flemmy feel and taste. A touch of tangy sour fruit lingers late too."
"Guava Grove saison is my first beer from Cigar City Brewing, and I definitely see some potential. Enough that I will check out another offering or two if I get the chance. I love the sourness and the fruit, but the off-tasting metallic finish is bad. Guava Grove is half a great beer, and half a bad one. I find myself looking forward to another sip, but also slightly regretting it as it goes down."
"Hazy peach color with a large white head which lasted the entire glass. Pleasant aroma of tropical fruit, some grassiness, and a touch of hops on the back end of the nose. Taste follows suit. There's a nice tartness to the guava, but also gives off flavors of peach and orange. Base saison is well-made, with decent dry, yeastiness on the finish. Carbonation is overbearing at first, needed a lot of swirling of the glass. A good tasting saison, and I had no trouble drinking even though saisons aren't my favorite style."
"D - Nice sweet nectar of a beer with fruity character and a Belgian yeast flair."
"Pretty good beer, but for a brewery that has pumped out fanstastic beer after marvelous beer, it's a let down. A standard saison."
"This poured a slightly hazy gold with moderate white head. It smelled like white grapes and guava and sweet honey and grapefruit and wild Belgian yeast, with some tart green apple and a bit of mango or papaya. It tasted like tart guava and wild Belgian yeast and sour apple, with some honey and candi sugar. It was thin with lots of carbonation, and had a sour aftertaste. Overall this had a very nice complex scent, with a clean and sour flavor. The guava added an interesting element that complemented the sour taste well. However, the body was too fizzy for me, and made it more difficult to savor the taste. This was otherwise a nice sipping beer, with well hidden alcohol, well balanced, and generally quite enjoyable."
"This is a pretty good beer, my first from this brewery, they are doing some innovative things and it has caught my intrigue."
"Overall- Thank god for Cigar City. Now we have two awesome breweries in Florida. Saint Somewhere and these guys! This beer is a must try. Can't wait to have easier access here in the Panhandle."
"A very tasty brew, Definitely one of the favorite Saisons that I have had. Definitely the first Farmhouse Saison that I have had, which added to the complexity and my enjoyment"
"Interesting brew, and certainly one of the more unique in the style that I've had to-date."
"Drinkability: Excellent twist on the style. I absolutely loved it!"
"Poured into a Unibroue tulip. Head is pillowy and fluffy and slowly vanishes after hanging around just long enough to show off. Lacing is soapy and lovely. Aroma is pungent, funky sour, some citrus (guava I assume) and some spiciness. Taste is sour, a touch sweet, fruity and just delicious. No way this is 8%. NO way. Wow."
"What a blend of saison and fruit lambic! A dark gold color with a hefty white head. Smells of tropical fruit, especially guava, mixed in with banana and a soft belgian yeast. Taste has a light funk to it which only adds to the fruit taste. Very soft feel to it with a sweet finish. I'll definitely have to drink this one again."
"This one's pretty damn contemplative. Opened it very cold, but it's getting its legs quickly. Guava or no guava, this is a solid new world Saison (not exceptionally hopped, but hops do emerge after a bit of warmth). Just a little brighter, deeper and spritelier than the average bear. I am savoring the living hell out of this."
"This is a beer that deserves more notice!!!"
"This is a tasty brew and an interesting foray into brewing. It's simply a very good saison with guava."
"This is an awesome beer, one of my all-time favorites; would be perfect for celebrating New Year's on South Beach."
"Bottle: Poured a cloudy dirty orangey color ale with a super huge foamy head with great retention and some super good lacing. Aroma of light Brett with some fruity ester and some spicy yeast is very interesting and quite complex. Taste is also a well balanced mix between some Brett with light sour notes and some fruity ester that are well mix with a spicy yeast finish. Body is full with limited filtration and perfect carbonation with no appearance of alcohol. Very well and I must say that I am very impressed by this new brewer."
"drinkability: awesome beer, cigar city is blowing things up."
"Overall i am very impressed with this saison. I had it about three weeks ago for the first time and liked it, and this full bottle has not only confirmed my opinion, but improved it. This is a very complex and very interesting beer. The color is a little off, but who gives a shit? And this is not a clone of your dupont or fantome, but its a very nice and very unique take on the style. I am excited to have a bottle of this to cellar, as i think it will develop well for a little while. Excellent beer, and a great addition to cigar city's lineup. Highly reccomended."
"D - Pretty high despite the bretty tartness. Great saison and the guava is a nice twist."
"Ultra-cloudy turbid blond body, looks like homebrew after a couple days in primary. I don't think I've ever seen a murkier beer. The head is dense, white and long-lasting, its only real saving grace. The nose is tart, musty, yeasty and fruity. Spicy with a subtle but plainly noticeable guava presence. Subtle but nice, these Cigar City beers aren't exactly olfactory delights. Tart and fruity on the tongue, lots of guava flavor and lots of yeast. Very dry and sharp with a ton of carbonation. Sour fruit juice mid-palate leading to a lightly bitter, peppery finish. Simple but very enjoyable."
"Thanks again Sam... I never would have tried to trade for anything ""guava"".. that said, this was not a bad ""guava"" beer, yet a sorta only okay saison... again.... in IMHO, CCBC has too much going on... I would certainly buy this again as it stands if I had it available, but probably only a bottle or two.."
"Drinkability: I would definitely have this again (if I could get my hands on more) and the alcohol in this is hidden pretty well."
"Very easy to drink and enjoy if you like sour fruit beers."
"This is another interesting mix of flavors from the guys at Cigar City and certainly an enjoyable saison. The fruity aspects of the beer are pretty strong and the finish isn't as dry as a traditional saison, but it's one I'd recommend."
"Overall this was very interesting and I'll certainly be paying attention to what CCB brews up in the future. Recommended."
"D - This is definitely on the acidic side for a Saison, and may not appeal to some, but it is refreshing and complex. The guava notes could just as easily come from the yeast as any fruit used in fermentation, but they are definitely there. A very good and drinkable beer, even considering the price and scarcity of this beer I would be inclined to seek it out again."
"This is an interesting beer, i like the acidity a lot. I think it might have some kind of bug, Brett, or otherwise, but that might just be the guava adding a bit of sour , either way its good. Its fairly simple though, nothing too complex, Its a nice beer, very refreshing, easy to drink but not worth the price i think. If it was in a 4 pack for about 9 to 10 bucks i would buy a lot of it, but a 12 buck 750, is a bit much."
"Drinkability-Yeah, pretty good. It isn't the beer that I'd want to really have more than 1 or 2 pints at a time but it's interesting and nearly unique. Seems like one of those ""like it a lot"" or ""it's not to my taste"" type of beers but truely it's an adventurous beer."
"This beer was very drinkable. I usually try to drink different beers, as there are almost 400 available any given night, but I was very tempted to order another one. The beer was very refreshing and even thirst quenching at times. It helped cool me on a warm night at an open-air bar."
"I can't wait until this becomes more available. i.R.I.S.? The hype-masters can keep that one, I'll take this one, thank you very much."
"I would get this beer again."
"Cigar City definitely knows how to brew and I can testify, I'm a huge fan of the Humidor Series Ale bomber but not ready to jump into the Guava bandwagon just yet. Can't wait for the Scotch Ale to hit the shelves."
"This beer is absolutely unique."
"D- Guava Grove is another awesome beer from an awesome brewery. It was a great beer to help celebrate the milestone."
"Poured into a snifter glass, pours a hazy orange color with a foamy head that leaves a bit of lace on the glass. Smell of funk, mangos, citrus, guava and pear. Taste is spot on for this style, nice refreshing blast of fruit with hints of pear, banana, pine and guava. Alcohol not detected in the taste but as it warms is detected in the nose. Overall a good offering from Cigar City Brewing and one that I would drink again."
"Cool taste! Sharp, a little acidic and tart, but with a cool fruitiness going on. The end of the swallow is sweetish and mouth-coating. Pretty cool, and very unique tasting beer. Alcohol taste is nonexistant; this thing could pass for a SOBE drink in drinkability."
"Thanks again fogdog, I really appreciate it!!!"
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is high on this one, I don't even notice the 8% ABV. Overall, I am not floored by this beer, again, it is my personal tastes toward guava, it's just too tart and dry for me. But I'm sure if guava is your thing, you'll love this beer. Skal."
