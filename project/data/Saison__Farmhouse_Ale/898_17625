APPEARANCE: cloudy, light yellow body; creamy off-white head settles to a reasonably bubbly half-inch; ... AROMA: instant lemon grass and bubble gum; pepper, clove, and a bevy of hop varietals to tantalize ... PALATE: quite drinkable, with a smooth, rum-like warmth and comfort; the finish is dry but welcoming and lingering...TASTE: a dramatically packed burst of hops that evoke flowers and lemongrass; bubblegum, clove and anise (?) complicate the experience in a good way, with each sip invoking consideration; fruits like pear and apple arrive late in a loaded plate  ...OVERALL: this was the beer I took to the 2003 trip to OBX, and all as well until I found a claw (!) in a bottle; still, a fantastic beer for the summer--and, not bad in the months leading up to the spring...","dacrza1","Jan 18, 2015"

The pour produces 2+ fingers of white, moderately lasting, foam head that fades to a thin surface cap with a thick island at the center that leaves a thin collar ring & streaks lace. Aroma is mostly wheat but a hint of biscuit malt, notes of banana, Belgian yeast & perfumey fruitiness with a hint of acidic green apple sourness. Taste is sweeter than the nose with notes of wheat, cobbler dough & banana with hints of peach, white grape & slightly tart green apple, spices, Belgian sugar & yeast. Finishes peppery & mildly acidic with a light bitterness that lingers & builds in the wheaty, floral, dry & mildly tart aftertaste. Mouthfeel is divergent being medium bodied with a lively carbonation, sweet up front - dry in the finish/aftertaste, spottily acidic & prickly, creamy but slightly oily & slick over the tongue.","mothmanscott","Jan 05, 2015"

A rather simple nose, spicy, Belgian yeast, and a bit of grainy scent. The flavor is rather unique as opposed to other saisons I have had. Similar spicy notes including coriander and pepper. A really strange graininess follows like a hefeweizen. I checked the description and found that they do use wheat so I guess that explains the graininess. Last is the nondescript hop bitterness. It's certainly different and unlike other saisons I've had. Overall it was successful for me. Maybe not the best in the class but certainly interesting.","ElderBeagle","Jul 31, 2014"

A lot of musty pale malt and Belgian yeast with light clove and little in the way of citrus. Flavor is good but not great, keeping it simple with mild lemon tartness, hint of orange peel, Belgian yeast and herbal hop character. The mouthfeel is full for the style and semi dry finish with moderate carbonation. I think Heavy Seas makes a lot of easy to drink beers which arent bad but lack creativity overall. I like most everything I have had, I just wouldnt call many of their beers memorable or complex.","kylehay2004","Oct 06, 2012"

Taste of lots of dark fruits, clove, banana, molasses, bread, and spices; with a bit of caramel and alcohol noticed on the finish. Fairly dry finish, but there are a bit of lingering notes of dark fruits, bread, molasses, and spices. Alcohol is slightly present in the taste, and there is a decent amount of warming on the finish. Medium carbonation and body with a bit of a creamy mouthfeel. Quite drinkable despite the alcohol presence as well. Overall, this is a solid saison that is like a wheat beer in some aspects.","superspak","Sep 09, 2011"

The alcohol is blended well, and the slight bitterness in the finish balances out the very sweet malt opening salvo. There are times the beer feels a bit watery, which might be caused by the high level of carbonation. It is not as dry as a saison should be, and it is sweeter as well.

The smell reminds me of some American wheat yeast strains but with a distinct sour aroma... almost like a sauerkraut thats been sweetened. The yeast strain is mellow in flavor with pepper notes and a continuation of the sour vibe going on here. The sour mixes with a mellow bitterness and the mouthfeel is alcohol sweet and dry.

The herbal hops are still there however, and provide a solid taste throughout. The mouthfeel is a little on the watery side, not being crisp or creamy. Dry in the finish though.

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, banana, and subtle spices. The flavor was of sweet malt, massive banana, very subtle spices, and a big sweet followthrough. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this wasn't too bad. If I'm honest I wasn't really expecting much from this one, but it came out nicely. Had a nicely balanced flavor going on in this one with a good aroma as well. Not sure why the reviews are so low on this one, but I found it to be quite nice and have robust flavors in all the right places.

A sweet malt that has medium complexity and sweet candy and a slight peppery aftertaste are good. The yeast brings a tanginess and a citrus like taste to it.

The smell helps dig me out of this grave: lemon rind, coriander, wheat fields, and mandarin oranges comprise a zesty whiff. Nice, but lacking that hint o' funk that keeps a certain Mr. Clinton in business. (I mean, seriously, did you see him on Arsenio back in '92, rockin' that sax? No wonder that elder shrub got clocked...) Things stay pretty much unchanged when smell becomes taste (synesthesia not included), though some cardamom and OJ pulp (so long as it's not in my juice, I'm fine) join in the fun as well.

Full-bodied for the style, hugs the curves of your mouth. Strikes a good balance between sweet and spicy, all that clove, coriander, ginger sweeps through, lees and raw bread dough, white pepper, then white grape, banana, peach, pear, cherry, apricot fruit.

Incredibly, this beer smelled like...candy! The sweetness is because of the Belgian candi sugar that is used in making high alcohol beers to avoid creating a thick body. The scent took me back to childhood, but I couldn't put a finger on what treat it reminds me of. The taste is of citrus & wheat with a little alcohol bite in the finish. The mouthfeel is nice, not too thick, not too thin. The drinkability was fair as well. Overall, I discovered this interpretation of the Farmhouse style to be satisfying.

Pale malt with the spicy belgian yeast and candi sugar, some light bubble gum and banana flavors. The feel is light to moderate with fizzy carbonation, finishes with a candi sugar sweetness. This is a pretty good BPA/BSPA but the problem is that it is supposed to be a saison. The brew does not have many of the saison characteristics. No hay, horse blanket, or other farmhouse funk.

3.97,8.5,3.5,4,4,4,4,"As the weather begins to gradually become warmer, I find myself looking for those special spring time seasonal beers. I came across this saison at my favorite shop, eager for something that cried sunshine I quickly grabbed a sixer. Poured a very colorful light orange almost copper color into my glass, the steady carbonation quickly produced a thick creamy head. The lacing is moderate, and the head soon diminished to a thin yet creamy layer. I was pleasantly surprised at the presence of the lacing and head considering the higher alcohol content. As this beer warmed up a bit the aroma really took off. A mixture of semi-sweet malts and hoppy bitterness dominate the overall scent which is accented with an earthy affect that I found extremely appealing. The flavor is right in line with the aromas that are given off. Malty and considerably hoppy the flavor is complex at first but gives way to a simplicity that is difficult to explain. There is a peppery flavor that seems to lead to hints of citrus and cloves. The mouthfeel is fresh. The malts create a smooth finish that is surprisingly full. I really started to enjoy this saison once it warmed up a bit. The high ABV only made it's presence known as I exhaled, a real nice effect. Truly an enjoyable beer, and a great cure for spring fever.","kinger","Jul 30, 2008"

You can just feel that thick malty sweetness pushing down on the palate. Overall good feeling.

Candy sugar is still present, but light fruit flavors are a little less defined (still going with green apple and pear). Mouthfeel starts out as light-bodied, but slightly oily with a little bit of effervescence across the front to middle of the tongue. More sweet and spicy, than pucker at the finish.

As I hold it up to the light I notice some of the haze is actually a suspension of what appears to be yeast byproduct, or orange peel. Mellow yeast, sticky sweet orange peel, maybe some ginger or coriander. Predominantly citrusy at the first sip. Smooth, as if each sip is coated with a layer of wax. As I drink more the spicy earthiness starts to come through along with the floral hop presence. The mouthfeel is a little bit flat. I like my Saisons to have a crispy fizz of carbonation to keep it lively and raw. Although strong, this is a fairly drinkable beer.

Some banana and pear, and maybe the faintest hint of clove? Pleasing scent, but again, nothing remarkable. The taste is nice. Clean up front, and almost a tad watery, with the spices and hops really emerging midway and finishing the palate off the rest of the way. Leaves a clean, bitter spice aftertaste. Mouthfeel is smooth and dry. Starts and finishes very clean. This saison is certainly not the best example of the style, but it's a very quaffable spring/summer brew.

Crystal clear, this was bereft of any sediment or even a touch of cloudiness. A far, far cry from what any respectable saison looks like. Smell, while mildly spicy and yeasty, didn't exhibit the typical saison profile, and more closley resembled a hefe than anything else. Smell was, however, closer to where should be than the appearance. Taste was mildly sweet with some very suble spice. I hesitate to give this even average, but do so in lieu of there being a 2.75. This was a very poor example of the style, however, I will say that I was stunned to learn that this was 8,0%, as it drinks, well, well, below that.

Flash of pale malt sweetness and pilsener flavor upfront, then a restrained brett. character takes over. Slightly medicinal with a mellow sour-tartness, this is well-balanced against the subtle cidery ester taste and faint noble hops that are presented in the dry aftertaste. Medium-bodied wih a low carbonation. The brett. dries the mouthfeel and also gives it a crispness to combat the threat of cloying from the ester and high gravity malt.

Tart and sweet flavors combined with some floral hop flavor as well. Slightly zesty and perhaps corriander. Lacks the general ""funk"" that is associated with other examples of the style, although you do get a slight hint of it. Light to medium body.

I taste white grapes, alcohol, and a backbone of spicy hops to keep the grainy malt at bay. Feel is fine, though not quite as dry and spritzy as I expected.

Yeast is present as well. Same fruit sensations in the flavor that were in the nose. Brisk carbonation enhances the blast of citrous.

It's crisp and then smooth across the palate with a medium-light body and gently effervescent carbonation. Some touches of orange and lemon appear in the flavor, as well as some berry-like juiciness. It's sweetly malty without being overlydone, and a touch of spiciness sneaks in from somewhere and helps to balance it. Hints of hop flavor also appear, and it's nicely balanced with a restrained bitterness that lets the malt and yeast shine while still finishing with a bit of chalky dryness.
