"cloudy light amber color. smell is alcohol and yeast. taste is the same but also fruit like. alcohol burn. as if beer could be a hard liqour. My first and maybe last saison. I am not a fan of Belgian style beers"
""
"O: This is perfect if you want a bit of hops but don't want to destroy your palate for the rest of the day with a strong IPA. I will definitely drink this again."
""
""
""
""
"They say miller high life is the champagne of beers? Then this is the DomPerignon of beers! Super duper dry! Lots of carbonation. Smell of grass and lemon. Dirt, bread. T- mostly grass and lemon, some pepper. Would go Amazing with some fresh Striped Bass or any white fish. Different. Would have again BUT only w the cuisine mentioned above."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- an extremely interesting, complex, and enticing beer that draws me back for another long, evocative and transforming sip. A slightly thinner body, more carbonation and a slight decrease in the bitterness might have really put this one over the top, but it's still a very good beer."
"Overall an excellent take on a traditional beer without resorting to West Coast hops for a non-traditional spin"

"Very much preferred at 38 degrees or less (warm it didn't taste like all that much to me). Love that it is 7+% and not filling. Overpriced for being sold in a 4-pack"

"Very grassy, earthy saison (positive, for sure) that gets slightly bogged down in Sorachi Ace. Still, an interesting beer that's well representative of the style and has a boozy overtone as well at 7.2% ABV (comes through more in the saison than that would normally). Maybe not a repeat, but as a one-time thing, you could do much worse."

"3/10/15 (Draft - The Laughing Man Washington DC) Pale light blonde pour, minimal head, mild carbonation. Slight fruit and lemon grassy hops scent. Mild taste, lemon and citrus noticeable, hops shined through. Mild carbonation, light texture. Overall good beer."
""
"This was exactly what it is supposed to be, but the sorachi hops mask what I love most about saisons, so perhaps not for me."
"Smell and taste were both very muted, it was almost odorless and flavorless."
""
""
""
""
"The lemongrass and pepper lingers to long."
""
"Pours golden with a thick fluffy white head. Aroma is very sweet and perfumey with notes of roses, grapefruit, and a hint of spice. Taste is much dryer than would be expected based on the aroma, starts almost buttery but with a hint of rose, transitions to a dry and slightly bitter finish. Hop notes are very complex, at times spicy and at others very floral and a bit fruity. Mouthfeel is creamy/buttery but slightly sharp."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Lemony spicy nose with light fruit and traces of pepper, light grains and white bread. Pours hazy gold under a 1” white long lasting fluffy head with very uniform, fine bubbles that produce classic cathedral window lacing. A spicy lemony peach palate with traces of white bread lingers. Finishes slightly dry with a bitter hop accent. Creamy full to medium full body and mouth feel, medium high carbonation, effervescent. Well balanced and refreshing."

"Something was just...off. Easy drinking for a 7% but to me it hit everything except the taste."
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: I really like this beer; perhaps I would prefer it to be just a tad dryer but that is only a quibble"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is quite good and different you think the Belgian yeast is going to be huge in this like in most beers but it hits your tongue and it's a little hoppy Lemony and then bam it's gone in a wash of mild clove spiciness.  This beer is so different it's really good."
""
"Pours a very cloudy golden color with a finger width foamy head.  Head retention and lacing are both well developed.  Somewhat of a farmhouse aroma with a little bit of a spicy zest and slight lemon.  Bready taste up front with a somewhat spicy hop and a lemon aftertaste.  Light bodied taste.  Not a bad beer but definitely had a lot better."
""
""
"(Overall) I like this beer, alot! I bet Garrett Oliver never anticipated making a beer like this, thank goodness for Brooklyn gentrification.....sorry New Yorkers you deserve it and you can handle it. I would love to drink this fresh in Brooklyn!"
"this beer has a lot of lemon/lime flavors.  the yeast is fully present.  it's a saison with more lemon lime flavor than usual."
"Had at Pittsburgh Winter BeerFest."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Great beer.  A very unique beer.  Could drink several of these.  Refreshing."
""
"Glass- Perfect Pint"
""
"O - A nice, balanced brew which includes standard farmhouse tropes (grass, spice, funk) and a pleasant lemony hit from the sorachi ace.  Tasty."
""
""
"One of my new favorite saisons. Nice lemongrass taste and smell with a lot of carbonation. Good summer beer."
""
""
""
"750ml bottle poured into shaker pint. Gushing foamy white head towers over clear yellow liquid. Some lacing is left after it settles. Aroma is of lemons, lemongrass, hay, grass, white pepper, spice, and cracker. Taste follows with the lemon flavors dominating and cracker-dry malts coming on the finish. A light body that’s inflated by the foamy mouth-filling foam, crisp and slightly creamy texture, highly carbonated, dry finish."
""
""
""
"F: thin, easy drinker, dry finish."
""
""
""
"Very interesting flavor. Floral, tropical. Tried at a beer fest and had to buy some. A good type of hop to try."
""
""
"First and very disappointing beer I've tried from Brooklyn. Tasted very little citrus and was overwhelmed by the watered down taste of a Bud Light."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: With a neutral malt character, this beer is all about the interplay of the Belgian yeast strain and the unique Sorachi Ace hops. The hopping itself brings enough complexity to drive the beer and keep the drinker interested throughout the session, but the yeast character adds much too. It really gets its hooks into you and draws you in with each sip. As far as pairings go this is an absolute slam dunk with sushi."
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a very well done Saison. The lemon dominates the flavor. This would be awesome for a summer day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"From the second I poured this beer I didn't really like it.  Too yellow.  Not enough carbonation.  Smell was decent, but nothing I wanted to linger over.  The beer did improve as it warmed, but only enough to allow me to finish drinking the bottle.  Too bitter, almost caustic.  Not really dry.  Aside from all those negatives I didn't like the flavor, although I can see how that would be a subjective element to this beer.  Maybe something went haywire with the first bottling for 12 oz 4-packs?  Glad I only bought the single."
"Crisp and clean with a huge lemongrass nose."
""
""
"Overall: A good American Saison, but not as much of the farmhouse flavors that make the style so special. It gets better as it warms and the carbonation dies down"
""
"O:  A good beer.  Some drawbacks, but a very original saison."
""
"O - A different take on the saison. Certainly not a light thirst quencher. Happy to have tried this and I would recommend to any saison lover."
"incredible. best of the year i had"
"In the imortal words of Uncle Eddie... It is ""Go-ood!""  Will certainly seek out again."
""
""
""
"It's nice to see this beer in a new format. It's a nice beer, but not my favorite saison. It's still something everyone should try if they haven't already."

""

"overall-very refreshing beer, something i'd love to drink in slightly warmer weather. great representative of the style."
""
""
""
"This is an amazing food pairing beer. Great lemon citrus notes, banana flavor from the Belgian yeast, champagne mouth feel and appearance, and it just gets more complex as it warms up. Would be an excellent wine replacement for a special restaurant night or dinner party."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-nice range of subtle flavors but the lemon dominates the show..........alcohol is well hidden..........very drinkable and would be great on a summer day...........nice representation"
""
""
""
"Crisp beer that featured lemon or lemongrass with hints of coriander.  Small bubbles in the head yielded way to a thin film of foam.  Very good beer that I will revisit."
"Will seek out again."
""
"Got a little too much lemon on the palette...nicely carbonated, easy finish, nice mouthfeel but hard not to think someone mixed lemonade with beer."
"Light gold pour. Quick dissipating white slight head. Lemon grass,  malt, yeast aroma. Totally interesting taste. Definitely a unique taste like saison. Great champagne carbonation.. Light mouth feel. Try it, you'll like it!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Exceptionally good with a very attractive flavor and aroma.  This beer is top notch and should not be missed."
"3.68/5: Really nice saison with a lemony focus"
"First experience with sorachi ace hops. Very interesting beer can't say I've had anything like it. While holding onto a lot of the saison character it differentiates itself with some pine and lemongrass citrus flavors. Very refreshing and drinkable, almost don't notice the 7.6 abv. This beer put me off balance and had me coming back for more."

"This is a slightly above average saison."

"This is a good looking and smelling beer, but what caught me was the taste. It just tastes fabulous, the funk and a touch of sour are really a fantastic combo and make this beer work extraordinarily well.  I hesitated a while before finally buying this beer.  I was Saisoned out, but this beer renews my faith in a classic style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Such a lovely beer, really brings to the fore what this hop has to contribute, lovely complex lemony, herbal floral notes and a very clean malt profile lend it a nice balance and a pretty ridiculous drinkability for the abv. This wouldn't be a go-to saison for me but I thought it was a pretty masterful combination that worked really well. Would definitely look forward to this again."

""

"Overall - a great saison, one of the best of the style with a lemon based feel and a great lightness. A great beer year round, but I can imagine this being even better on a hot summers evening."

"Cheese is done, apple core is turning brown on the board but I'm still nursing this last glass because I don't want it to end. Needs the chill. Buy, pour, eat, drink, repeat."
""
""
"O: An interesting experiment that falls short IMO. The waxy, musty, and dill-like notes detract from the beer and muddle what is supposed to be a very ""clean"" style, and despite the stellar mouthfeel, the disparate aromas and flavours never come together in a cohesive way. I can see what they're trying to do here, but this one doesn't do much for me."
"Overall: Aromatic and flavorful while still crisp and refreshing, especially given its 7.6% ABV."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a clear, straw color with about 2 fingers of marshmallow-soft white head. Aromas of the Belgian yeast (spicy and a hint peppery), some lemon grass, lemon, celery? This is a unique hop for sure. Delicious farm-style with really unique notes combined with well-intentioned balance. Slightly dry finish with some lingering notes of the lemongrass. This is a winner."
""
""
""
""
"O: Tasty with good complexity, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer to drink for a while."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A ‘classic’ saison that introduces a hybrid touch. North American-style dry-hopping with Japanese hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very nice. This beer pours a light yellow with a very fizzy head. Almost looks like a champagne. The smell was full of lemon but also a bit of bitterness from the hops. The lemongrass gives out earthy tones which then open up to the zest and hops near the end for a crisp and refreshing brew. Liked it a lot."

"Overall: I haven't dabbled with this style much as saisons don't usually impress me, but this was just interesting enough to keep me satisfied. The flavors and aromas are a bit subdued than what I prefer, but its clean, balanced, drinkable, and ultimately damn tasty. This is a summer beer for the record books. Recommended!"
""
""
""
""
"Dry and crisp on the palate, finishing with a solid hop bitterness. Citric hop character, solid malt presence, and just a bit yeasty. Carbonation is somewhat aggressive but softer than a sparkling wine. While this is no session beer, the flavor and mouthfeel give it a very refreshing character, with only a bit of alcohol warmth. Brooklyn's big bottle Belgians (Local 1,2) are great beers, and Sorachi Ace is no exception."
""
""
""
""
"Very, very dry.    Great carbonation tingles the young.  Mouthfeel not quite as nice as Hennepin.  Very original taste - probably from the Sorachi, that makes this stand out from other Saisons.  Pretty damn good."

"O: Excellent brew. Less is more as far as flavor, alcohol level and weightiness. This is more because of its light feel, less sweetness, dry character, and overall light herbal quality. Bought in Savannah, drank in Cocoa Beach July 10th, 2014."

"Had this on tap and it was the first batch. Poured hazy goldenrod with short lived white head. Aroma is awful. Weird lemongrass and lemon bitters type of aroma. Earthy, grassy, and more grass with an overcompensation of lemongrass. Spritzy carbonation. Refreshing if you can palate it."

"Overall - This may be one of the best Farmhouse ales I've ever had, personally. Perfectly balanced, perfectly dry-hopped, perfectly succinct. A wonderful Farmhouse. Crisp, clean, sugary, complex and layered. The Sorachi Ace also makes quite a statement. Very floral, funky and natural tasting, almost like flowers and cannabis with rich sugars and fresh yeast. Delicious. It doesn't get much better than this. Teetering on perfection -- in fact, I do not know what could be improved. I rate this even higher given the fun experimentation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Lemon sets the tone from the bright yellow color to the nose and taste. Some bubblegum and white pepper, there is a sweet and spicy feel about the whole experience. The malt is subdued but present with a more yeast tones an light lemony hops. Really like this, maybe not love it but worth the try."

"Overall: A good beer overall, and I'm glad I tried it. Perhaps this beer is better fresh, but it isn't knocking me out of the park. Prairie standard seems like a better representation of the sessionable hoppy saison style, I'll probably stick with that."
""
""
"Overall: i like some of the tastes but the combination comes off unbalanced and grassy"
"Had this before and gave it a good rating so I wanted to do a full review to see where it fell. Excellent overall beer, outstanding look for a saison, will even better smell, and a very interesting, and satisfying flavor. One of my favorites and one I will revisit from time to time."
""
""
""
"Overall: Really nice saison. The sorachi ace hops add a nice twist on a traditional saison. Definitely worth picking up a bottle."
"Sampled on tap at Beer Revolution in Calgary. A light yellow to amber colored brew with a minimal white head but ample carbonation, sparkly and with a champagne-like mouthfeel. Aroma extremely bright, fruity, and vegetal, redolent with lemon zest, green herbs, yeast-derived spicy notes, and a dry nutty earthiness, perhaps a tad musty. Palate is unique, a combination of more typical earthy, spicy flavors characteristic of classic saisons and assertive herbal/citrus hops, as one would expect from a beer billed as a single-hop showcase. The pilsener malt and nutty yeast elements are present but take a back seat to vibrant cilantro, lemon grass, and spice seed flavors that make for a memorable and perhaps polarizing taste experience. There is also a root cellar earthy peppery spice lurking in there, with a floral perfume and some alcohol peeking through at times. Crisp and dry, body is just shy of middling and the lack of sweetness becomes more apparent as one proceeds through a pint. Approach this one in the right mindset and you'll be intrigued by some unusual flavors. Sorachi Ace is a distinctive hop."

"O: I’m surprised such a hop-centric beer was still so great after almost a year and a half, but if anyone can make that happen, it’s Brooklyn. Definitely a must-try; and hey, if you’re looking for a gift beer, this one was greatly appreciated. Merry Christmas!"
"The taste is parallels what I get on the nose with a significant lemon zest and citrus zing flavor, mildly toasted malts, and a tart yet dry finish. It is very much like champagne with that slight maltiness to remind me it is a beer."
""

""
""

"Overall, a very nice Saison with a twist. The sorachi ace hop lends some very nice citrus notes that compliment the Belgina yeast nicely. A good beer that is worth picking up."

"O - This is a good saison with some unique flavors that I assume are from the sorachi ace hops. I find it just a bit too heavy in the body, but have no other critiques."
""

"The beer poured a hazy orange color that produced a huge white head that was very well retained and faded into a thin cap. Carbonation was streaming to the top of the glass. The beer gave off a very good Belgian yeast aroma and slight citrus, lemon maybe. The taster was excellent, just what you would expect, but with a dry aftertaste. The beer follows the nose perfectly. The beer had a medium body, good carbonation, and it was extremely drinkable and smooth. Overall, very high quality."

"Obviously I need to try a couple more Sorachi hopped beers before I decide if they are worth the fuss for me. This is a very drinkable saison but not a great one."
"With the rampant availability of this in my area, I'm smacking myself in the head for not having tried this sooner. Picked up a bomber at the local Stop & Shop. It definitely needs to warm a bit before all the complexity comes out. First glass was a bit too cold and I found it good but not great. Second glass, I let sit for about 10 minutes and that's when this beer really shined. Very pleasant mild funk on the nose with grass and lemon interwoven. Poured out with a nice head that held on till I drained the glass. Kind of earthy taste, again with the grass and lemon. And it goes down quite easily. A very good beer which I will definitely buy again; and can find virtually anywhere."

"The smell is lemon citrus with a hint of grass. These is a slight pleasant funk. The taste reminds me of being in a field on a summer morning. There is a light sweetness at the start with a blast of lemon from the hops and some fruitiness. The finish is clean, dry and refreshing. There's a hint of a pepper with pleasant alcohol warmth. This is an excellent beer."

"O: a very nicely done saison, simple and straightforward - nothing tricky, just good, clean craftsmanship using German two-row pilsener malt, Sorachi Ace hops, and Belgian house and champagne yeast."
""
"Overall it is a great summer porch drinker but more of a sipper in the sun."
""
""
"This beer evokes images of still life paintings, french meadows, rays of sunlight. It drinks easily and is enlivening and vivid. A terrific beer. Would pair easily with a variety of cheeses, light dishes and even with salads. Has a body and a palate that would compliment plenty of fresh and pungent herbs as this is so clean with only a very simple palate. Mild and gentle."

"Pours a clear gold with a foamy bone head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, fruit, earth, and slight funk aromas. Taste is much the same with fruit and mineral-like flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a solid but not in your face hop presence."
""
""
""
""
"Perfect smelling beer. Very dry crisp flavor. Not much fruit. Biscuit and grassy flavor. Not very bitter, not big enough flavor. Thick white foamy head. Solid lacing. Pretty good beer. This is the type of beer that you want to drink right after a round of golf or mowing your lawn. Great summer thirst-quencher"

"Look at that big fat three-finger snowball white head, like a real Champagne of beers. Fresh zesty seasoned smell with a light sweet malty spinal column rising from this pretty amber brew. The flavor seems to match the scent as the hop's indescribably unique citron demonstration steals the show. More than subtle, less than front forward, Brooklyn Brewery does it again, for me at least. The only visual obstructing the view through this clear golden cloudless thirst-quenching indulgence are the crystal carbonation bubbles drifting up to support the stable fetching white head. This may be my new favorite beer! I can drink this all day. I better put some of this in the vault before it's all gone. I feel like if I tried to make something that nearly resembles this beautiful brew that I would certainly fail. Brooklyn Brewery, I love this stuff."

"O - overall great beer. At the brewery here in Brooklyn and having It this fresh is the best!"
""

"Overall, quite good, but as noted above, there is something that doesn't sit right for me. Wish I could identify it, but there is something about the hop flavours, particularly the lemongrass, that doesn't quite do it for me- despite loving lemongrass."

"This one pours a hazy deep gold with two fingers of tight, white-frothy head that settles gradually. The aroma is bright and refreshing with notes of lemon zest and a crisp, crackery malt backbone. Notes of herbs and earth lie faint in the background. The flavor is dry and clean, with a crisp, light-bodied mouthfeel. Some appropriate astringency hits on the back of the palate with each swallow. Sorachi Ace is a uniquely refreshing example of a style I'm still learning to appreciate."

""
""
"O - not a bad beer by any means but feel its kind of average in the realm of saisons. I've had better but I've had worse. I would still drink this again on hot summer days. Would definitely purchase again. Wish there was a little more flavor to this."
""
"O: A very good beer for what it is but not varied enough in the flavor department with no real yeast presence despite the style. Would be a great accompaniment for fish or seafood dished for sure."
""
""
"Growler on tap at Joe Canal. Pours a golden yellow with a large long lasting fluffy white head. Very good lacing and head retention. Aroma is of ripe fruit, pears, sweet yeast and spice fruit essence. Taste same as aroma with some mild spice hops bitterness. A medium body, crisp and refreshing on the palate, mild carbonation. The Finish is a combination of sweet spice ripe fruit, pears, yeast and biscuit malt followed by mild spice bitterness for balance. A very good, tasty, refreshing and flavorful brew. Very nice"

"Overall quite a great mesh of styles you got your world class Saison with the bitterness of Sorachi Ace hops. Delivered what was promised."
""
""
""
""
""

"I've had this a number of times both on tap and from a bomber and this growler again proved that this is a winner. A great creation and experiment that showcases the art of craft brewing. A high recommendation, go drink this if you want a deviation from the norm."
""
"O: 4.0 This beer doesn't have a lot of depth to it, but even being near 1 dimensional it is still very enjoyable. The forefront aroma and flavor of the pine characteristics linger for quite some time after finishing. I would definitely have this again."

"O: The champagne yeast definitely makes this saison unique, as well as the fact that it's a single-hop beer. It's very easy to drink given the 7.6%. Great summer brew, but it would work any time really. Good value and worth picking up"

"The beer pours a hazy pale straw yellow with a big fluffy creamy white head that clings to the side of the glass and slowly fades to a thin lacing. The aroma is a combination of lemon and grass (hence lemongrass) and spicy black pepper notes. There is even a hint of orange. The taste is very yeasty and spicy with lemon notes. The mouthfeel is light-medum with a dry finish and highly effervescent. Overall I'm glad I finally tried it and would definitely drink more. Sorachi Ace hops have a very unique aroma."
""
""
"O: Perfectly Balanced! Sorachi Ace starts with a great hop presence of lemon and pepper that carries into the taste. It has a nice malt character (sweet and buscuity) and dries out for a clean finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"They appear to have kept the recipe simple here and those that follow that blueprint are often the best beers, no? This was my introduction to Sorachi Ace hops a few years back and I savor that flavor in any beer I've had containing them since. So distinctive. WOuld match so well with a light, fruity dessert or peppery salad. Really stellar job on this one!"

"Good bitter hop finish. This has more a bit complexity to me than DuPont. This is a very easy drinking, but also complex saison."

""
""
""
""
"Overall. Classic style saison with plenty of flavour. I enjoyed it."
"Poured into my tulip glass with a 2 finger head that dissipates fairly quickly, no significant lacing. This Ace has a hazy golden color with a slight pink hue. Smells like Belgian yeast and lemon. Earthy, grassy taste; I can taste the yeast it has a sour tang to it, peach aftertaste. Strong carbonation and medium mouthfeel. Mellows down as it warms and settles. Good brew, I think I preferred the Ace on-tap. From the bottle B+. On-tap A-"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very solid beer! Just a hint of lemon in the smell. Beautiful color. Nice and golden. Not served too cold which I think is important. Very good taste and aftertaste. Left my mouth tasting just a little dry. This beer just kept getting better with every drink. I would order this ale again anytime!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Really good stuff. Had this with a nice BBQ in the sun and it was perfect. I will buy more of this beer, even with the slightly higher price tag."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Likewise for the alcohol - this was fairly strong but in no way did the booze make itself felt until afterwards. While the earthiness of a beer typical of this style is present, the champagne yeast and mountain of bubbles gives this a very lively feel that's present from start to finish. I've never had a bad bomber from Brooklyn and this was no exception. This was wonderful and a great beer to welcome in the warmer days with!"

""
""
""

""
"Carbonation is very high, but it works well."
""
""
""
"O: As expected for a saison, lots of fruit and florals. Very sweet. The sugary sweet citrus hits first, but the pine/ mint/ grassy flavor hits almost immediately after and the two mix for a very nice flavor definitely stronger on the mint/ pine/ grassy side."

"This is fairly malty at first, not really bitter even after the hop flavors emerge, but rather tart in the vein of many Saisons. The aftertaste touches on more bitterness. A thoroughly interesting brew I'm glad to have encountered. On tap at Pizza Paradiso in Georgetown. [transcribed from notes ; 06/10/2012 visit]"

"O- very refreshing summer beer. I can see myself sitting on my deck drinking this for hours. Love it."
""
""
""
"This is an unusual beer, and in a good way. Hard to pinpoint any one thing about it, but the overall package works very well. Nice and complex, and goes down easy. I would happily have this one again, highly recommended."
"Drinkability: Quite high; I’d characterize it as sessionable but the ABV is just a tad high for that. Still, this is going to become a part of my regular rotation. Just exceptional."
""
""
""
"Very good suggestion from Ron. Dangerously drinkable; fresh, crisp, dry, simple, and executed very well. Nice integration of flavor from this unique hop; this beer went down pretty quickly."
"This is a great saison. Nice earthy tones. Grassy and only mildly funky. Carbonation is pretty high; could deal with a little less of that. But this is consistent and on the spot for the style. More of a sipper than anything else. Another nice one from Brooklyn. Keep it up, folks!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I enjoyed this thoroughly. Like the bottle says, ""it tastes like sunshine in a glass."" The Sorachi Ace hops gave it a Pilsner quality that I enjoyed. It's very drinkable and would be a great introductory Saison for white wine and champagne drinkers."
""
"One of my favorite saisons. Great job Brooklyn."
""
""
""
""
""
"Best use of Sorachi Ace hops i've come across. Nice showcase for it and it doesn't totally take over in the taste with the belgian yeast enough to work with it. Lovely beer and a lot of fun to drink. 750ml serving size is also about right, enough to drink on your own, but still a decent size to share."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - This hop varietal seems to pair perfectly with the saison style. Accentuates the standard lemon/grass/hay flavors of saisons. Well done, I'd like to compare it to the bottle version."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Sorachi Ace is really something special. If you read the back label too intently you might never open it. The ingredients are well thought out and effective. Drinking it right now in February it reminds me of warm summer days and crisp dry satisfaction. The head is white and crisp, the aroma a bouquet and the taste exquisite. I want more."

"O-I've rated this beer quite highly because it highlights the wonderful Sorachi hops so perfectly. Its a hop forward beer that is extremely refreshing. I don't think I'll find anything quite like it and will certainly seek this out again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - The weird aftertaste is the only thing that detracts from this beer, otherwise it is outstanding! This may become my go-to saison when I want something light and complex."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I don't normally go for hop-driven beers, but this is excellent. Definitely demonstrates the broad range of flavors in beer. I wish the flavors were a bit smoother and more connected (perhaps in a rye version?), but the hops and yeast melded well into a delicious harmony. Very tasty; worth seeking out if you're not really into overwhelming bitterness but want to try a pure expression of a hop varietal."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I like this as something different and refreshing. It doesn't wow me but it definitely has a right ace and right time for it."
""
""
"O: A really interesting saison variation with a nice, distinctive hop character from the sorachi varietal. Tasty and subtle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This was a good representation of the saison style. I think there was too much lemon zest over powering the other flavors for my taste. I would drink this beer again, but I won't rush out to buy another immediately."
""
"Mouthfeel - full slightly dry mild carbonation."
""
"Overall: This is nice. I hope to get one for the summer time as I can see me drinking this on the deck on a warm day. I like this and will definitely buy another bottle in May or June for the summer. Brooklyn has a winner and I know why they decided to bottle this one and distribute it."

"This is really pleasant to drink. It's clean, refreshing, and light, but never boring. I dig it."

"First beer of evening...I have a whole big beautiful bottle to myself...stamp #2342. Pours a beautiful hazy wheat gold with continuous small white head. A few dark floating particulates at the bottom add intrigue. Aroma of lovely fields of grain and bread. Taste of a good saison, not too spicy or citrusy, but components of lemon, orange zest, black pepper, grains of paradise, chives, lemongrass, sourdough bread, modest hops & slight finish of funk! Overall very tasty ans satisfying."
"Overall – A very nice drinking and flavorful brew. I would definitely recommend, as it was a nice blend of funky, smooth, citrus, and sweet. One to give a go to if you get a chance."
""
"Overall: A delicious Saison, I love this style and I love this beer. A great showcase of the Sorachi Ace hop for any of you homebrewers out there."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a pretty decent saison. Some unique character from the sorachi ace hops, but nothing special. Strong flavors, solid representation."
""
""
"I poured from a bomber into a snifter, golden yellow pour, hazy, 2+ inch head, tons of lacing. The aroma is lemony, peppery, spicy. The flavor is very lemony, fruity, hint of pepper, drying finish. Highly carbonated, easy drinking, light body. A very nice saison, I am a big fan of the Sorachi Ace hop."

"750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled 7/12/2012. Pours slightly hazy golden straw color with a nice 2-3 finger fluffy white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big lemon, pear, pineapple, clove, orange zest, pepper, herbal, earth, grass, floral, and yeast spiciness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity. Taste of big lemon, pear, pepper, pineapple, apple, orange zest, clove, herbal, grass, earth, floral, and yeast spices. Light earthy bitterness on the finish with light tartness; with lingering notes of light fruits, lemon, pepper, clove, herbal, floral, grass, earth, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance and complexity of flavors; great spiciness/malt balance; zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a lightly slick and very crisp and prickly mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a world class saison! Fantastic balance and complexity of flavors; insanely smooth and crisp to sip on. A truly incredible experience when it is quite fresh."

""

"Overall, this is darn tasty and very easy to drink. Recommended."

""

"A golden straw hazy pour with a nice fluffy head and a moderate level of lace. The smell is a burst of juicy lemon and lemongrass, belgian yeast, spice, mango and pineapple. The flavor has a clean belgian bannana profile with lemongrass and a grassy phenolic finish. Solid saison with a hop variety you dont get to see often. Glad to have had it."
"I'm not sure if this is the best way to showcase a hop, and the scaled back Saison Isn't going to blow anyone's mind. Still, a nice drinker with a bit of something different."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I want to like this beer more than I actually do. I love saison-style ales and unique hops, but the hops dominate this one a bit too much, covering up the saison yeast character. The harsh finish drops the drinkability a bit."

""
""
""
""
""

"Lives up to the special hops hype. Poured a 2"" white head with long life. The body is a hazy raw sienna yellow color. The smell is different including the lemon zest but also spiciness, malt, even soap. Taste mirrors the smell, especially the lemon zest, and also has caramel and a touch of sour. Medium rich body. Finish is a little soapy. Interesting and refreshing."
""
"O: Excellent, excellent saison. Haven't had another quite like it."
""
"M: Medium body with medium alcohol."
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
"Overall: an interesting, tasty and refreshing saison. I will definitely try to have this again."
"O - Very good beer and unlike any other saison I have had. The Sorachi Ace hop seems to be bittering and lemony in my experience here, need to seek out other beers that feature it."

"Now, the strong points of this beer. Thee’s a brilliant mouthfeel: awesomely soft and fluffy. The carbonation is high, but very refined and pleasant. The alleged star of this Saison--the Sorachi Ace hop varietal from Japan-- is present, though seems to be more than balanced by the malt. The hop flavor is nice: lightly lemony and herbal. Bitter, but not totally dry.And the not-so-strong? I must admit, I was expecting more from this brew. There is a big, biscuity malt presence that I wouldn't say is par for the Saison style. But the main flaw I see in this beer is an annoyingly buttery flavor-- dare I say, diacetyl aftertaste. This doesn't fit into my definition of ""crackingly dry", as the bottle proclaims. Clean this butteriness up, Brooklyn, sub in a bit more Saison funk, and you'd have an awesome beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"I think this is the perfect use of this hop. The lemon with the spiciness of the saison was great. Mostly lemon in smell, with some dill flavor as well. Medium bodied with good carbonation. Overall a nice twist to a standard saison. Very balanced and drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer for me was inspiring; after a day of very high IBUs this was a refreshing eye-opener. It showed up big-time and reminded me there is more to beer than booze, bitterness and in-your-face attempts at ""boldness"". This is personal and is probably just an individual reaction, but the second and third sips of this gave me a bit of goose-flesh. This is a beer I will return to soon and often."
"Overall, what more to say? Fantastic beer. Brooklyn found a great application for Sorachi Ace, and executed it par excellence."
""
"O: Very enjoyable and easy to drink - definitely one to have another time. Well balanced and the alcohol is well hidden."
""
""
""
""
""
"What I like so much is the distinct components in each reviewing component. The color in the appearance, the peppery and bubble gum scent, the spiciness and hop character of the taste, and the feel of the finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a nice saison. a little dull in the flavor but the yeast character is excellent. A must try."
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm probably too ebullient in my review but Brooklyn seriously nails it on their large format bottles."
""
"Overall (4.5): The more I think about it, the more I realize how well-rounded this beer is. My only personal complaints are that I could always go for more lacing and I’m a fan of moderate, musty funk—this is pretty traditional, in terms of the yeast character. Though, it’s clear they picked a pretty refined strain for this, given the surprisingly nuanced mouthfeel and unique but not overpowering yeast note on the palate. And then the hops. This is a very unique, VERY successful pairing of hops and beer style, and to be honest I’m amazed at how long they’ve held on. Great job, Brooklyn! Now if I could just get this and Local 1 in a slightly smaller package . . . :-)"
"All about balance (not intensity) on this one. A delicate beer from Garrett Oliver and Brooklyn Brewery. I had waited much too long to finally give this one a go. Possibly my first time around with Sorachi Ace hops. A delicious drink and very much recommended."
""
"Mouthfeel was good. Rich and crisp. A very pleasant drinking experience but not a great Saison."
""
""
"O - A hoppy saison, but not as hoppy as I was expecting."
"Great concept and execution. I ordinarily find Sorachi too domineering in Pale Ales / IPAs, however the more aggressive Saison yeast tames it nicely."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a very good Saison and I was pleasantly surprised because I am normally not a fan of the style. Usually they are too yeasty and herbal forward for my tastes but the Sorachi Ace lemony hops make this a winner for me. Worth a go on draft or in the bottle. I think this is year round now but try to find a fresh bottle if possible the get the freshest hop characteristics."
""
""
""
""
""
"An even older bottle than the last one . I tried. This really has mellowed out. bit phenolic and medicinal. Very herbal and grassy. its pretty good"
""
""
"If you are looking for more earthy Saison this probably isn't for you but a very nice beer in many respects."
""

"Truly a world class beer and one of the most original and highest quality saisons brewed by a American craft brewery. A must try."
"It's a single hop saison, germanpilsner malts, with spices, golden farmhouse ale. Has a 7.6% etoh. Reminds me of honey basil from berkley & saison du buff from dogfish. It would be great with food. My 1st time having it is @ pig & fish in rehoboth for $i a 16oz glass."

"Slightly hazy pale yellow color with a tight, frothy head that extends up over the edge of the pint glass. Had this been served in a larger tulip glass or something similar, I think the overall appearance would have been more impressive. Nevertheless, a fine looking beverage with drippy lace all the way down the glass. Perfumy floral and lemongrass aromas over a solid pilsner malt base. Increased juicy, zesty citrus and fresh herbs at it warms a bit. Sweet, juicy lemon and a certain soft, creamy, almost honey-like character in the mouth with, again, a nice pale malt presence. Dough, fresh herbs, clove, pear, and cedar. Overall phenolics are light. Very flavorful, yet soft and smooth. Medium bodied and fairly well carbonated. Properly bitter and dry. I've had this before, but don't remember being this impressed. Well done."
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D-I truly wish I didn't wait so long to try this. So unique. It reminds me of a slightly less perfect version of one of my perhaps Top 5 favorite beers. Plenty to love about this beer."
""
"Ive been hanging to try this as i love the Sorachi Ace Hop and it pours a hazy yellow golden hue which leaves a two finger head that stays and leaves sporadic lacing,the smell is Sorachi all over with aromas of lemon sherbet,orange leaves,lavender and freshly cut limes,the mouthfeel is smooth,medium bodied and creamy with tastes of lime zest,sherbet,mandarins,champagne and finished with a creamy lemon cheesecake bittersweetness that makes me want another sip and overall im abit biased as i love this hop but it certainly suits the Saison Style and i love this drop definately something id buy again that be perfect with seafood cheers."
"Corked and caged bottle from the shop. Pours a light golden color, slightly hazy, and with a big frothy white head. Aroma of farmhouse yeast, funk, belgian influences, and some interesting spicy hops mixed in with the funk. Flavor is belgian yeast, spice, some pine, a good bit of light grass, and a dry finish. Light mouthfeel and heavy carbonation, easy drinking, and rather refreshing. Not one I would go grab again, but I am glad I got to try it. Very nice."
"O. Nice Saison. A little different than most. A touch sweeter and fruitier, which worked for me. Saison is one of my favorite styles, and this is a beer I would get again."
""
"a hazy golden yellow pour with a generous amount of fluffy white head. smells of fresh cut grass, lemons, belgian yeast, basil, oregano. a very mellow saison with a giant blend of herbs and spices. it almost tastes like spaghetti with a garlic sauce that's subtle in flavor. very nice, very refreshing, very different. champagne like light body with great amounts of sticky lacing - perfect for any time of the year. overall, this is a perfect example of what a saison should be. the sorachi ace hop works perfectly with this beer style."
"Overall this is a semi sessionable, refreshing beer. Would pair great with salads or lemongrass chicken/asian food. Not my favorite style but its a solid beer and glad I tried it."

""
""
"Overall: A bought a beer that scream bang, I absolutely love it. So much going on and no complaints in my department. It delivers and that's what counts. Salud!"
""
""
""
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: Besides being an interesting look at a new hop this beer is a very drinkable one that leaves me wanting more. While I’ll not be buying this one a lot, I do plan on adding a few to my shopping list periodically as I think it is quite nice but also should pair well with a nice serving of grilled salmon. My overall impression is that this is a well made beer that I’m pleased to have had and even more pleased that the Brewery has decided to make it a regular offering so I can have it again."
"This beer tastes and feels great!"

"Nice beer, would love to try this on a dry-hopped cask or a fresh keg."

"O: Sorachi Ace was not exciting me when it was chilled - but warmed up it started to develop a complexity that proved well worth the wait. I'm liking this one enough to make it worth the high price. I could see drinking this again with seafood or soft cheese or even sushi for excellent dinning."
""
"Overall a very interesting beer. Very refreshing, good balance of flavors."
""
""
""
"O: Not the most drinkable Farmhouse Ale I have had. Not worth the price tag in my opinion."
""
""
"Overall worth trying to compare with other saisons. I prefer a mellower saison with more fruited presence and less alcohol in the finish."
""
""
"Overall: While this is not a poorly put together beer, and I strongly like some of the hop flavor, the sum of its parts just isn't working for me. Good aroma, some small wow factor in the taste, but in the end I'd rather drink something else."
""
"Overall a wonderful experience. I thought the marriage of sweet, sour and bitter was remarkable."
""
""
""
"All the elements are in the right place but something's missing. Saison is all about light and refreshing, but when the hops hit along with that iodine yeast and some tin, it's bracing to the point of aggressive. Astringency leaves it good but not great."
""
""
"Fairly full bodied for a saison with solid but not overwhelming effervescence throughout. A solid brew."
""
""
""
"Im glad they are putting this in 4 packs."

""
"Cheers!"

"Pours a hazy dark yellow color with a tight white head which leaves nice lace on the glass. The aroma draws you in with floral notes before honey and then a big lemony citrus smell finishes the beer off. The aroma is big but delicate. The taste follows suit with a green fruit tartness up front before there is a sweet honey and then a big lemon and other citrus flavor comes through. Again the taste is big but delicate. It is light and refreshing. The mouthfeel is crisp with moderate carbonation. Overall a very good beer, the beer is dangerously drinkable for the abv, and is surprisingly delicate for the abv. This beer is a must try."
"Poured from a corked and caged 750 ml bottle into a tulip. Very white, large soapy head forms quickly, and never goes away. Moderate lacing. Beer is pale orange or dark straw, with lots of tiny bubbles, slightly hazy. The nose shows banana, mango, clove, and a little vanilla. Those flavors dominate up front too, especially the mango and tropical fruit, with a wheat-like graininess coming in, followed by a semi-dry finish with a bit of a citrus impression. They yeast characteristic shows predominantly in the nose, and less so in the taste. It's a light, spritzy beer, but it has some backbone to it. Styled as a saison, I'd also believe it as a non-traditional wit in flavor profile. Perhaps unusual at first, but it insinuates itself quickly. Really very good, and a beer I'd definitely seek out."
"I enjoyed this beer a lot. I seem to give saisons a bit higher rating and this was the first I had in a long time, but it really hit the spot. Lots of flavors and easily drinkable."
""
""
"2.0 D: Not a fan of this. I'll try a sorachi ace beer one more time and if it's anything like this, I'll write them off for eternity."

"O= A plesant surprise from my boss leads to a great beer from Brooklyn. I haven't ventured too far into their portfolio but this is a winner for sure. I don't know how fresh this bottle is but the hop character was still present. I wish it were a little more assertive in the flavor though. Maybe it is on a fresher bottle I don't know. I'll just have to buy more."
""
"Overall: A very tasty and interesting brew. Its like a combination of a wheat beer, Saison, and Champagne. Very well done."

"Tried this in 14, and I get much more floral and herbal hop character, with a fair amount of bitterness in the finish."
"Poured into a Brooklyn Brewery pint glass. The color was a golden straw with a thick white one finger head. Not much visible carbonation. Not much on the nose, some malts and a little hops. This is a very clean tasting beer, lots of lemon peel, pear, very crisp. I do not have a lot of experience with the saison style, but this is excellent. I would look for this beer again."

"O - A malt filled lemony & zesty saison. Very refreshing but can be heavier than most saisons."

"O: This is an outstanding saison. I think those Sorachi Ace hops and I will get along nicely. I'll definitely be buying more."

"Overall: I enjoy sorachi ace hops, and I think this was a very good use of them. The finish is a bit heavy on the tongue, but overall this is a very nice beer."

"Maybe just a little disappointed, but not bad, and the price is reasonable."
"Hazy golden pale colour, 2+ fingers of white head, good retention with lots of lace left on the glass. Smell has a lot of citrus, lemony, crisp and earthy, nice yeasty notes, floral, hoppy with some spicy points as well. Taste is citrusy, yeast, grassy/floral flavours, tropical fruits, lemon, some hop, orange with a yeasty aftertaste. Fairly high zippy carbonation, med-full body, solid weight. Really good stuff, incredibly drinkable because this bottle went quick, would certainly come back to this again."

"I have never tasted a beer with this flavor. It was very smooth and full bodied, almost a hybrid of a wheat beer and rich pilsner. Apparently there is lemon and citrus flavor in this beer, however it is so smooth I did not find it to have any bitterness. My experience was that it had a rich vanilla-like flavor. Extremely unique beer compared with your typical summer pilsner or hoppy ale. Highly recommended, you will enjoy every drop."
""
""
"Overall - Nice and solid in most areas. Heavy on the pale malts in a way that reminds me of some imperial pilsners. Good, but there are better saisons out there."

"Another great beer from Brooklyn. I'm actually glad that this comes in bombers, as it takes a while to fully appreciate this. It's a complex beer that doesn't reveal itself in just a small tasting."
"Very nice hoppy saison produced by Brooklyn. It´s unique without getting to weird."

"O: It's very fruity and hoppy for a saison."
"Overall: Average, I like the fact they did a saison and 100% bottel conditioned, but I am not a huge fan of the lemon taste."
""
"Overall Impression- Just when I think I've had some of my favorite Saisons (whether from Fantome, The Bruery, or others), another great one pops up! Such a nice brew, I'm wondering how this musky characteristic came into play? Perfect amount of citrus and sour notes. Can't say one characteristic overpowered another one. Very well balanced! Recommend if you have a chance and enjoy the Saison style."
"O: Extremely unique. Belgian blonde malt taste, witbier sensation, and Saison yeast cake. Highly recommended!"
"O : Overall a very drinkable beer and will definitely have again and again hopefully on tap next time."
""
""
"Not my favorite saison."
""
""
""
"O: Easily the most complex farmhouse ale I've had so far. Fantastic beer."
"I had this beer on New Years eve as the last beer of 2011. It was one hell of a way to go out. This is now one of my favorites and cant wait to get my hands one some more of this farmhouse ale."
""
"overall: the effort put into this one is noticeable, not for complexity, but for its consistency, well done."
""
""
"This is a more fruity and approachable interpretation of the style that still carries many of the traditional characteristics of a great Saison. Brooklyn did a great job at showcasing the Sorachi Ace hop in this offering. In my opinion, this is worth every penny."
""
"O: Very refreshing and enjoyable. Nicely done."
""
""
"The brown bomber bottle, with the corked and caged presentation was top notch. The beer itself appeared pale yellow and very cloudy. The aroma was grassy, lemony, and slightly floral. The taste was like biting into a crisp cracker. The hops were more prominent than most Saisons I've tasted, and they added a lemony, herbal, and mildly bitter flavors. The malt bill appeared to consist mostly of pale varieties, which added a simple sweetness. The yeast was not as interesting as other Saisons, and added some pepper like spice, but not much funk. A bit lighter in body than the typical Saison of today too. That being said, this was very refreshing beer to drink, with little holding you back from downing it quickly."

"O - This was a pretty average beer. Nothing exciting about it. I've had blue moons that have tasted better. Was not worth the $14 that I paid for 750ml."
""
"I like this more than Dupont. A different take on the style with the additional hops and carbonation. The carbonation put me off at first but really settled in after more tasting. Would think the beer was bigger ABV% based on aroma and taste. Outstanding."

"O - A great saison, one of my favorites. They call it sunshine in a bottle and they are on point."

"At a better price point, would keep this in the house all the time."

"Dear God, watch when you're pointing this cork when you undo this one! My cork went further than a lot of champagnes I've popped. Pours a hazy gold with tons of visible carbonation. The head is very bubbly. Aroma is sweet and bright, with lots of lemon and a bit of yeast. The taste is very strong on the lemon flavors at first, with a bit of grassy earthiness and a little bit of subtle funk on the finish. The mouthfeel is light and very carbonated, and the drinkability is a little bit difficult, actually. It's possibly just a little too bright to pair with the pepper for drinkability and winds up just tasting a little ""hot"" after a while. Overall a solid saison though, and would probably be appreciated more by a fan of the style."

"one of the best beers i have ever had. no kidding. beautiful packaging cork and cage set up for 27 bucks at harry's seafood restaurant in wilmington, deleware. poured a heady golden a little hazy into a frosted pint glass. smells like a saison, yeasty, grassy, and way way way more hoppy than these usually are. almost ipa-esque in the nose. the flavor is unreal, not nearly the hop bomb promised by the aroma. instead a balanced complexity. i can detect vanilla, cut grass, citrus fruit, and a delicate malt backing band. mouthfeel is perfect, medium bodied, brilliantly carbonated, and smooth as anything. has a sort of richness in the feel that most beers dont have, especially saisons. the bottle mentions a champaigne yeast, which is the first ive heard of it, but it imparts wonderful flavor and feel to this beer. worth the money and was excellent with our massive seafood feast. i will be reccommending this beer to everyone, its absolutely winderful!"

"Overall.- Wierd."

"Bottle: Poured a hazy light beige color ale with large foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of dill pickle chips with dry floral undertones. Taste is also dominated by dill pickle notes with some dry hoppy notes and some floral notes. Body is quite full with great bottle conditioning and great carbonation with no apparent alcohol. Very funky hops in this one with solid malt backbone."

"Morey's Bottom Line: I'd heard some good things about this beer. I saw a few bottles at my local Wegmans, and couldn't resist picking up a bottle for $9.99. It's even better than I expected. Probably my favorite Brooklyn beer to date. Might have to go and grab one more bottle."
"750ml bottle caged and corked poured into a weizen glass. A great looking beer with a cloudy golden wheat haze. Awesome 3 finger pillow off-white head that faded to one finger. Decent lacing start to finish. Smell was a bit faint, but picked up notes of citrus, honey, cloves and banana bread. Taste followed the nose with a tart front end and smooth finish. Some spices crept through as it warmed. A little bit of a fizzy afterhit that was odd. Didn't enjoy the bitter fizz as it sort of crowded out the citrus/fruit. Mouthfeel was a good bit of carbonation and fizz. Not watery and a little dry. Overall- I was wanting a little more from this Farmhouse Ale. The taste was a little bitter for me and I like this style with less of a hop bite. The honey, cloves and wheat are prominent up front and it is still a good effort from Brooklyn. Have yet to have a bad beer from them. Not bad and would have another. Cheers-"

"Re-reviewed after  a few years. Again it's amazing how the palate changes. The new release in 12 oz. bottles. Quite possibly the best saison I've had in quite some time. Thinking about it I never found an expiration date on the above review, But this bottle had a 28 Apr consume by ? Anyway total night and day since my last review."

"Nice display of an obscure hop in a style that wouldn't typically use it. Interesting take on the saison style. Glad to try it."
""
""

"I normally hate saisons, but this one is very well done. The lemon flavor really brings out a lot and it's spice and funk is subtle unlike most of the style I've had. As it warmed a little more spice came out and it got a bit overpowering."

"O: Excellent beer that I definitely wasn't ready for. I really enjoyed it and would love to pick up another in Spring to enjoy on the first day of cutting the lawn of the year."
"Overall tasty and fairly unique for the style. No problem polishing this one off!"
"Definitely worth a try and comes highly recommended. Pairs perfectly with some goat cheese."
"The blend of lemon-hops and yeasty Belgian flavours makes this beer stand out. Very well done!"
"A nice beer but the hop was more aroma than flavor. I'll try a fresher bottle again. Couldn't find a date anywhere on this guy"
"Taste - Very dry and refreshing. Flavours of lemongrass, yeast, bread, grass and spice."
"O/D - A nice Saison. American take with extra hops and a little a grassy note. Nice and very drinkable. Really solid. Pleasure to have had this."
"This is a pretty good saison. I like that it was different than the typical saison."
"a winner for sure and I want to explore this hop in depth, not cheap but worth it"
"Juicy and tasty, with some nice dryness. A great saison. Very well done."
"Overall: This is a good toasting beer as elegant as the label."
"The sample I got popped and fizzed like champagne, but at least the fizzing wasn't volcanic like some others I've tried. It pours a clear yellow with a thick white head, not impressive to me anyway, but I'm prejudiced towards dark beers, and as the old warhorse goes, you can't judge a book by its cover - or a beer by its appearance. Aroma is much more promising than the appearance - strong, yeasty, fruity, with grassy and rubbery notes. Refreshing flavor has malty, fruity, yeasty and grassy notes with a hint like clean rubber - I get notes of apple and banana in the fruit. Texture is quite fizzy and lively, yet smooth and firm-bodied. Overall, pleasing and lip-smacking."
"D: I would share a bottle with a friend, 25.9oz may be too much in the future for me."
"I really enjoyed this beer. The head and lacing were outstanding and the taste was excellent. You really get flavors of wheat with some citrus and malt with a floral finish. It has a very smooth taste and is easy to drink and enjoy."
"mouthfeel - medium bodied, nice carbonation, very very drinkable (especially while going from ris to ris)"
"O - The strange flavor here must be the Sorachi Ace, and I am not a fan. It would be better without it."
"O - Great saison. Good representation of the style and a good hop balance with the Sorachi Ace. If you see a bottle and havent had it I highly recommend it."
"Quite nice. Does it warrant the price tag and reputation? Maybe not. But I was never a lover of saisons in general."
"Overall: Buy it."
"Medium body with medium to high carbonation. Dry, crisp, very refreshing. This one is quickly becoming one of my favorite saisons around."
"750 ml bottle. Pours golden hue with a long lasting, tall, white head. Aroma is of heffeweizen like fruit, yeast and spices. Medium, smooth body. Taste is spicy hops and cooked vegetables. I did not really enjoyed this brew. Maybe I've head a bad bottle."
"D ~ This beer showcases the Sorachi Ace hop very well while firmly assuming its role as a Saison. Wish for plenty more."
"Bottle shared at the September iteration of the Santa Cruz tasting series. Pours a hazy bronze color with a nice white head. Flowery fruity hoppiness on the nose with some lemon and grass. Some honeyed malt comes through as well as some phenols, maybe a bit too much of the latter. Grassy flavor with mild esters, lemon, honey, and a crackery finish. A little sweet; a bit drier and this could be great. Right now it’s pretty good."
"O-i really enjoyed this beer. Wish it was available in 6 or 4 packs."
"This one pours a really, really nice honeycream gold in color with a two finger, billowing white poofy head. It looks great. The aromas are consist of citrus, lemon, grass/straw, yeast and spices. The flavors are very, very interesting. This is my first experience with Sorachi hops and I like the different aromas and flavors presented. The flavors are kind of funky. You get a lot of straw and tea leaves and it has a nice citrus, yeasty backbone. It's an interesting drink and pretty appealing. It drinks medium in body and has good carbonation. Overall it's a fine beer, an interesting one, and worth your while. I like this spin on a saison."
"O: not a bad ale, decent for a try but nothing i'll be breaking the door down to buy again."
"Light bodied. Plays quickly over the tongue, neither sticky nor overly drying. It's refreshing with just a little bite."
"O: Everybody gushes over this beer when they talk about it. It's a good brew no doubt about it but it isn't the best saison I've ever had. Having said that, it is the best American saison I've had."
"Sorachi Ace pours a clear dark lemon (I have a hunch I'll be typing that word a lot here) yellow. There's about two fingers of fluffy white foam capping the beer. Head retention is solid, and the beer leaves sheets and sheets of lacing stuck to the glass. The nose is an absolute lemon bomb, reminds me of making fresh squeezed lemonade at work. There's also a bit of pale malt sweetness, but it's very much an ancillary note. The flavor takes that foundation and layers in a subtle clove-pepper spiciness to keep things interesting. It was easy to pick out after having had Brooklyn Radius early in the night, as I'm guessing it comes from the brewery's house Belgian strain, and it's featured more prominently in Radius. The body is impressively light for a beer approaching 8%ABV, the dryness being the mark of a well brewed Belgian style beer. The carbonation is active and effervescent and really helps carry the unique flavor contributed by the hop that gives this beer it's name. I'm thrilled that I'll be able to pick up Sorachi Ace in bottled form any time I want going forward, it's a well made, fairly original saison."
"D: Very refreshing when served cold, perfect for summer."
"O - Overall this one is very nice. It has lots of different flavors going on but still remains very drinkable. I wish I had a few more of these stashed away for the future."
"O- well put together, but the lemongrass is a bit dominating for me. Not my favorite, but a solid brew and I can certainly understand why some folks love this."
"Got a bottle from Petschens, and very happy with Brooklyn again. Hazy shimmering gold beer with a lingering white head. Drank it the same day I bought it, so didn't let it settle out, so I may be the cause of the hazy part. Gorgeous complex lemongrass, citrus nose and strong peppery spice that is clean and multi-layered at the same time. Carbon tang on the tongue and the yeast and spice fills the mouth fully. Dry finished that accents the hops. Brewed with rare Japanese Sorachi hops (according to the website), the lemony character is intrinsic to the hop. I'm a fan and would love to get some more of this beer."
"Weathered but clear golden color. Massive head is produced from the expressive and high level of carbonation. Very aromatic with suggestions of Asian pear, faint jasmine, lavender, hibiscus and green peppercorn. Smoothness is very deep here, which helps with telling the beer’s story. Lighter body is fluffed by the bottle conditioning, adding a huge refreshing quality. Fresh herbs with some dried fruit; yeasty and medicinal, cracker maltiness and earthy. Nearly bone-dry finish and not too far off from being an epic brew."
"O - Overall, I really, really loved this beer. The only negative was the presence of the ABV throughout pretty much every aspect. While the price is was high $14.99, I would buy again."
"O- I am really enjoying this beer, great stuff. Definitely will be pick this up again."
"O - While a bit pricey this was well worth it. An excellent take on the style that I enjoyed immensely."
"Big corked and caged bottle with an attractive label, especially the back. Poured a hazy glowing light golden straw color withe a billowing frothy white head that holds shape when you finger it. Shrinks in a few minutes leaving minimal spotted lacing. Smells lemony with light herbal grassy verge notes. This doesn't taste like your average saison. The citrus notes are great but the sorachi hops are odd. There is a weird medicinal earthy taste from them. Fairly bitter for a saison. Feel is light to medium. Drinkable, but again the unique grassy medicinal taste kinda puts me off a little."
"This is a fantastic American interpretation of a Saision, and I think the Sorachi Ace hops work very nicely. Absurdly complex and delicious. I've come to expect a lot from Brooklyn beers, and this one definitely delivers."
"D -- Excellent brew, worth a try and a very admirable representation of a single hop variant."
"Bursting with yeasty ester. Lemon zest, white pepper, cardamon, fresh mown grass, pine needle, other floral notes. Light nutmeg, more earthy notes. Zippy, brilliant carbonation but what would you expect from a saison?"
"Notes: This beer is a rock star! Well-balanced, with just enough body and a ton of flavor. The unique hop variety adds so much to the character of the brew. With all that said, if I were to have tasted this blind, I could almost swear there would be a little white ghost on the label. Well done, Brooklyn!"
"O- I have to admit I'm little disappointed by this one. I've only had one other beer with Sorachi Ace, and there were buttery notes in both that are a little off putting. This isn't a horrible beer by any means, but I won't be revisiting it."
"D - Slightly odd, but overall a fantastic beer. A hybrid of sorts, but simply superb. I've got to get another one of these before they're gone. If you see one, don't hesitate. Well worth the twelve or thirteen dollars."
"O: Sorachi Ace hops fit well with  Saison yeast, a little too well, perhaps. This beer is quite simple, but I do find it reasonably enjoyable. "
"O - different from many saisons but overall it's a darn good beer."
"M - Light to medium body and carbonation."
"I have no idea why some are apeshit for this, chalk it up to a region not having many loyalties to divide I guess. For me, this was just a bottle of lemon, coriander & clove."
"O: Quite enjoyable. I was expecting to like it, but was surprised at how much. Really enjoyed what the sorachi adds to the saison. Very drinkable."
"Pours a slightly hazy light golden or a straw color, it produced a massive white head (second pour just as massive). The smell is a floral hoppy smell with some lemon, a little bananna. Feel is medium to light. The taste is pretty good, I get a little citrus / lemony taste, a little peppery, a little bananna, a little grassy, and it has a nice bitter after flavor. Overall a pretty good beer, this is only my second Saison with the other being Hennepin, this doesn't have the long dry finish which I found in Hennepin and I prefer that one more to this, I'm not sure which is more correct though. Anyways a pretty good beer and this is a style I'll have to further investigate."
"Seems to mellow as it breathes, warms"
"Overall: Very unique due to the lemony Sorachi Ace hops. Great Saison overall, which once again proves that Brooklyn can nail the look and mouthfeel of Belgian beers."
"O: A solid beer and something I really looked forward to trying. It's light, refreshing and really has all the right qualities to make this an easy drinking summer beer. I'd happily seek out this beer to bring to my next cookout."
"a decent beer, definatly ruled by the hop, the saison qualities are a little lost. not something id buy again."
"Definately one of my favorite beers of the summer."
"The CPJ"
"O- outstanding twist on the saison its dry zestful and hoppy..i would drink this one year round.. my favorite offering from brooklyn thus far only one footnote i would haved liked it a tad bit more sour"
"Overall impression: A bigger, strongly hopped Saison. Nice summer drinking."
"Overall: I wasn't sure about this one at first, but found it to be highly enjoyable. Saisons normally have quite a bit to think about in the areas of aroma & flavor, and this one definitely did as well. A very refreshing brew for a hot day. I'd recommend this one as a potential pairing for any dish w/ which you might consider a pinot grigio or even a sauvignon blanc!"
"O- Very easy to drink. Nice and light. Refreshing. Could have a few. Delish!!"
"This is really good; I think this would be a nice table beer that even non beer fans might be able to appreciate."
"Light mouthfeel and very drinkable. Not exactly what I expected from a saison, but good nonetheless."
"It’s good, pretty complex and very well balanced. This isn’t the boldest of beers but it’s good. But, I mean, look at that label, huh?"
"Nose is super lemony, sweet, fresh mown hay, touch of cracked pepper. Love the Sorachi Ace addition, fresh lemongrass in the flavor, orange and citrus rind along the lines of marmalade, pepper, a touch heavy for a saison but beautiful bone dry finish, hint of mineral like character in it. Quite drinkable, very spritzy carbonation. Lacking some of the characteristics of a traditional saison but a terrific take nonetheless."
"Overall / Drinkability: Definitely quenches the thirst - and it's not quite like anything I've had before in a beer. Goes to the head quickly though, even with a meal, so it's either a slow sipper, or in this case, one and done for me per evening. The Japanese hops are the showcase for this beer, and I'm not sure how I feel about them. Interesting, unusual, and worth trying, but I think just one per night even if the ABV was lower. So a good experience, but not something I could have every night or something that I would go out of my way to have again. Something about that woody/herb/resiny flavor at the end doesn't quite do it for me. Still - a neat beer to try out for the reason of it being so unique in flavor."
"O: This is a fantastic beer and, more to the point, a fantastic saison. The wonderful complex aroma (which is noticeable as one pours the beer into a glass) matches a nice flavor profile of spicy fruit and earth. The great carbonation keeps the beer fresh and crisp. However, the finish could perhaps have a bit less bitterness since citrus is already the star of the the beers flavor. I would also have liked it to be a bit more on the sour side. Slight negatives aside, this is an excellent beer well suited for the summer, and (really) it is good enough to be enjoyed year round."
"D/O: An easy drinker for its weight, plenty of depth to the flavour, well-crafted."
"This beer is a fantastic saison. I'm starting to wonder if this is the best one I've had. What great stuff..."
"D - This has good drinkability. It is refreshing and the taste is great. Overall I thought this was a very nice saison. I could easily drink a few glasses of this in a sitting. I would buy this again. Very nice."
"Overall, this is a good American Saison. It's got a wonderfully unique aroma that I could smell for days and days. Seriously, Febreze? Glade? Y'all need to make products that smell like this beer. I wish I could get this beer in my distribution area."
"What I love most about this is how it's a beer that features a hop in its name, nicely showcases that rare hop varietal, yet sticks completely to the traditional Saison style. It has an elegance that West coasters just love to kill with their bash-you-over-the-head hop profiles. The back label claims it's sunshine in a glass, and I'd say they're pretty right on. Raw and refreshing. I hear this is going to be a year-long release now. Hope that's true cuz I could do at least one of these a week."
"Great drinkability, and this is a very wonderful Saison. I held onto this bottle as it was the last of pretty much only one case my area got, but I've recently seen a new case on shelves, so I hope this has moved into a more heavy rotation as it is wonderful."
"Overall, a great beer, and a rather large and complex one. As it turns out, this goes somewhere very different from where I thought it might, which was a light, drinkable and refreshing brew—this is a big, and robustly interesting beer; one that should be sipped."
"Medium body, higher carbonation, tingly and lingering on the palate, slightly dry too. Definitely a decent saison, not necessarily one of my favorites, but worth a try."
"Overall: I really enjoyed this beer, it really is one of my favorite saisons to date (I have not had too many but this one certainly sets the bar high, its no Fantome but great none-the-less). I would buy this again in a heartbeat, a little pricey but well worth it."
"Overall this is just great take on a saison, real glad I picked this one up."
"a golden yellow body topped with a big fluffy head that sticks well and recedes slowly. lots of carbonation visible. citrus clove grass and grain present in the nose gives a good invite. lots of clove present in the taste with just a wee bit of citrus some banana on the edge there too. nice hoppy bite in the back. light bodied with some bitter puckering. overall its a damn good beer and definitely worth the price."
"Nice to see this on the shelves at BCLB stores at $9.99. This is a funky beer that shows off a unique hop that is truly reminescent of lemongrass and lemons. The farmhouse style works very well with the hop and uses the slight funk to counter the citric notes of the hop. I could see one eating Thai or Korean food with this beer and I really started to enjoy the way this beer tasted like no other I have had. Will buy again before Summer ends"
"Great brew- lots of flavor without being overwhelming. For a Saison it didn't have the intense spiciness and the sorachi ace hops created a really unique flavor- the taste of a hefeweizen with the texture of pilsner. Fantastic way to finish a summer weekend."
"O: Unfortunately, the metal aftertaste and the corn flavors kind of ruin this beer for me. I find similar flavor profiles in many American takes on Belgian styles, especially saisons and Belgian IPAs. It's not awful, but I had no desire to finish the entire bottle."
"D: very refreshing, unique take on a saison. the sorachi is really a great hop for this beer and the bottle refermentation makes for a great mouthfeel."
"Picked this up last night from the boonton liquor store and split it with a friend. We drank it out of snifters.The beer pours a nice yellow hazy color with a thick white head. It was very peppery saison with lemony finish from the sorachi. It was a good beer for the price however Brooklyn has better products."
"Pours exactly like champaign a little too much head. Smells like a sour with some mild floral hop aroma and some wheat beer scent as well with a slight bit of lemonade. The taste is very unique tastes like lemon rind, a slight bit of grassy hops, a lot of fresh black tea leaves and very dry. The flavor coats the tounge and stays with an after taste of sour skittles or warheads and an addictive lemon lime sting that does not go away. This is a great introduction to a sour in my opinion but the hop focus for this is not great, not the style to use in order to showcase the hop. Maybe would be more interesting as a pale ale without all the fancy."
"D- easily drinkable in a large quantity as the lemon zing cover any alcohol bite."
"O: Been waiting for this one to come back and it was worth the wait. Great saison, the lemongrass smell and flavor just compliments the style very well. One of the most drinkable and refreshing saisons I've ever had."
"O: This is delicious. I was glad to see the latest BA say it's now a year-round beer as opposed to the limited release here, as I will definitely be getting more."
"This beer poured out as a hazy golden color, the head was fluffy and white. A very heady brew. The lacing was pretty good. The smell of the beer was very floral and has a good saison aroma to it. The taste of the see had a hefty amount of the Sorachi Ace hops on the tongue. There was also some nice spicy flavors too. The mouthfeel was full of carbonation and was light bodied. Overall the beer was very tasty and was enjoyable. I would like to have this again one day."
"Split a large bottle at Liberty St. Tavern with a couple friends. Wow, this is easily the most interesting US-brewed saison I've tried and up there with the best I've had. The hop and yeast character blend is both floral and fruity, with sort of a cream and melon undertone. There's a hit of citrus rind after the deeply floral (like roses) note. The body is relatively light and crisp, very drinkable. I want more."
"The biggest characteristic is the nose with a big smell of fruit and balanced hops"
"Crisp and tingly on the tongue. Medium body, though the high carbonation contributes much to a lighter feel."
"O- fantastic beer, especially on a warm day like today. I wish it was cheaper and popped up more often. Hey Brooklyn, get on that!"
"O: A nice beer, but a little to dry and bitter for my taste when it comes to Saison."
"A lot of spiciness, but very refreshing and easy to drink."
"Pours a clear straw, bone white crackling head. Aroma of lemon juice and rind upfront. Alittle bit of spicy Belgian yeast with a bready aroma as well. In the flavor, a crisp biting lemony hop, some earthyness, champagne like in the finish. Belgian yeast in full force with must, pepper and mild pear notes. Super dry, aggressive carbonation. Mild doughy character, spice and a good helping of citrus, hop and funk. Overall, an interesting and unique brew with well rounded flavor. Worth trying."
"O: I'd like to try something else with the Sorachi Ace hop, but this one is not something I'd seek out again. It was interesting, glad I got to try it, but nothing fantastic that I'd have to buy again."
"Overall, this was a treat.  It's very refreshing... This is what summer seasonals should be like. Try and get it while you still can!"
"O- this one was disappoint. It was just to bitter and not in a good way. Maybe with some more time the hop bitterness will fade"
"Reinforces my appreciation of my local brewery - Brooklyn!"
"Mouthfeel is a strength for this beer, as it is incredibly light, a touch prickly, but smooth and crisp the whole way through. Dry finish is the cherry on top. Drinkability benefits from the incredible balance and mouthfeel and the perfect hiding of the abv; I'm having trouble making this 750ml bottle last even an hour. I enjoyed this beer immensely - thanks again makdeco."
"M&D: Lean-bodied and smooth. The high carbonation contributes to the high drinkability."
"O: I would not say this is all that drinkable. To much alcohol to be refreshing. Seems somewhat high maintenance. I could not enjoy by itself, with some cheese it was better. This should not be a sipping type of beer"
"O- Tried to save some for the fish I was cooking for dinner, nada! I gotta try and get more of this stuff before it's all gone. Seemed fitting that spring had finally arrived because this is exactly what drinking this reminds me of."
"As mentioned before, this is a light bodied and very refreshing beer. Very tasty and would be/is excellent for a backyard barbeque when the weather is nice. I had mine with a medium rare cheeseburger with blue cheese crumbles and barbeque sauce, which turned out to be a fantastic pairing. At about 13.00 dollars a bottle i don't know how many more I'll actually drink. This would be great in a 6 or 4 pack."
"didnt like brooklyn all that much in the past hgowever they really impressed me with this guy, maybe i was wrong about them."
"O - Such an amazing beer, this is perfect on a warm Spring day, and I imagine this could pair with food incredibly well."
"O- i liked this, but it wasnt my favorite saison. the price point (i think its like $16) makes it something that i doubt ill buy anytime soon. still an enjoyable beer though."
"O: Very drinkable in spite of its dry quality. Not the best saison I've ever had, but still pretty good. I would definately buy this again..if only to admire its appearance."
"I liked it fairly well.. Not sure if I would revisit it at the price point but I'm sure glad I got to try it out..."
"Drinkability: Good one for a spring day; was fun to try but won't seek it again"
"Pours a golden color with a good head and good lace. The aroma is citrusy and bready with some lavender. The flavor is spicy with a bit of cooking spice and some nice citrus. The beer is plenty dry and the bottle went away quickly between the two of us."
"D: I've really grown fond of this style in the last year or so... and this is one of the best of them. I now see why so many people put this on their list of the top 10 beers of the year."
"D - A very drinkable beer that has some delicious flavors that meld very well together but are very well crafted. The ABV is not too crazy either. (4.5)"
"Easy drinking beer that would of been better after cutting my grass on a summer day."
"Though it wasnt what I wanted for the style; I still had no problem knocking out 750ml."
"The mouthfeel is great. It has an effervescent quality to it and a nice dry finish to it."
"D: A light, flavorful saison accentuated by the grassy, herbal, lemony notes of the Sorachi Ace hop varietal. With flavors bordering on a Belgian Tripel, this near 8% ABV saison has a lot of character and rare street cred to boot. The Sorachi Ace hop is used well here as the arm candy to the lemony, spicy, light flavors of this well-crafted saison."
"D: An exceptionally drinkable beer."
"Drink- 3 for 3 with Brooklyn and the big champagne size bottles I have had. Local 1 & 2 were both great beers and Sorachi Ace keeps that going."
"Wow - a saison with some game reformulating New World cojones, and a zingy fruitiness that just wouldn't let me stop tipping that glass back, not to mention its superb masking of a respectably hefty 7.6% ABV, at that. A splendid display of a heretofore unknown hop to this humble Joe, and seriously worthy of seeking out."
"malty and lemony...a bit stinky....some pepper...nice and drinkable..very drinkable....bright in the mouth..7.6%...manoman..i could drink this all day...a damned handsome beer..you can taste the bourbon and wood in this....!!"
"Thanks to Troy for sharing this gem."
"Overall- God damn this is a fine beer. The Champagne refermentation is an awsome concept for this style. I am still waiting for my first perfect 5.0 beer, but this is the closest I have found! Its to bad this is a very limited beer."
"I am thoroughly pleased with this beer and will have to put it into my rotation of beers"
"D - This is a pretty damn good beer. Dry, clean, crisp and very tasty. Brooklyn has been doing a good job of reversing my attitudes towards American breweries attempting Belgian styles, and this beer is further proof that they can brew a damn fine Belgian style ale."
"A bit too clean, meaning that the depth is veyr limited. A very quick flavor might leave you wanting more, but is very well appreciated for those that might not want a ""heavy"" or ""deep"" beer. ABV is felt, but never sensed besides a bit of spice notes in the finish."
"D: I enjoyed this unique ale and would say, for me, its about mid-level in the drinkability department."
"Drinkability - yowza. I could drink a lot of this! A really good balance, a great flavour. A nice offering. I recommend hunting one up."
"The body was very good, full, round, smooth & sharp at the same time, with a nice level of carbonation on the tongue. Drinkabilty was also very good, I would have enjoyed the bottle by myself. Overall, another very good brew from the gang at Brooklyn. Worth seeking out."
"O - I love the style and this is the best saison I've had to date."
"I could drink this all day. Such a nice beer - I paired it with Thanksgiving dinner which was a perfect pairing!"
"d- good, missing something here though, didn't hit me as a terrific beer, i'd drink again, but not seek out and buy."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, sticky, semi sweet, and gently herbal in the finish."
"Overall: A very interesting take on the saison. Very fruity and refreshing. The drinkability is tremendous."
"EDIT-Accidentally put 4.5 under appearance, changed to the desired 4."
"This beer is good, quite refreshing and simple and I think that's why I like it so much."
"The beer pours a hazy/cloudy gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a dry, earthy pale and wheat malt scent along with a mild hop bitterness and some farmhouse funk. It's light and refreshing with a nice lemony zest. The taste is good. It has a crisp bitterness up front along with a earthy/farmhouse finish. The malt bill provides a stable base with a basic pale malt flavor. It's light and lemony with a dry/clean finish. I'm not getting as much esters in the taste. I'm guessing the hops are canceling a bit of the character out. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low/medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good saison, although I prefer a bit more funk. I especially enjoyed the Sorachi hops. They have a unique character to them that I wouldn't mind trying in another style."
"D- A nice Saison style that I would recommend to anyone. Yet, because it was from a brewer I respect, it left me looking/wanting something more complex."
"I thought this was a bit non-traditional like Saison flavor, yet I liked what they did. Overall I would drink this again and recommend it."
"Well done, Brooklyn!"
"This is a fantastic saison, and I would recommend it to anyone!"
"Very good, and certainly recommended."
"Notes - A good, but not great, saison. It doesn't live up to its greatest potential (or the hype my friend provided), but it's a pleasant drink while it lasts."
"This stuff is awesome. Saison or personal interpretation of a Saison this is a total winner for me, worth every penny (as expensive as it is), and sadly for my wallet I'm going back for more to stock up. This is the bottle I'm bring to every dinner party I attend while it's still available, and it's now my go-to for New Years as well. An all around enjoyable beer that needs to be experienced, and very accessible for those not familiar with the style."
"D: this is a nice refreshing Saison, it almost reminds me of a Berliner Weisse with it's acidity and refreshing qualities. Very nice."
"Tastes kinda like hobo sparkling lemonade, the kind you make in restaurants when you ask for lemon wedges and plain soda water and make the best of them. An interesting hop, this Sorachi Ace, and balanced against one of the Cs or equally bright hop, especially Amarillo, I could see this hop catching on quickly."
"Pours a light straw lemon color with some haze. Good white head. Nose is lemon, grass, and a bit of earth. The taste brings out lemon, grass, some herbs, and a hint of earth. Bitter and dry. Drinks well."
"Up front on the palate is a crackery malt flavor that shifts into a snappy, dry finish of hops and peppery yeast. There is a great hop flavor all the way through, with grass, leaf, and spice notes. Mouthfeel is light, bubbly and refreshing. I could easily go for more of this. I wish the price was a little lower, but if they make another fresh batch of this, I'll probably splurge."
"Pours slightly cloudy, pale straw yellow. Nice white head that retains, though only laces lightly. Lots of spice on the nose though accompanied by an off-putting aroma of vegetal that is quite clearly cauliflower. This is not what I'm looking for in a beer. A bit of faux-lemon in the crisp and dry body of the beer. Once again it isn't sitting well for me for what I want in a beer. The body though does have a nice black pepper taste to it... Dry and perfect mouthfeel with crisp carbonation, though the oddity of the aroma and taste knock this one right down..."
"A nice hop focused Saison, which with time will likely become more noticeably fermentation driven; this is more due to the hop character fading, than the yeast character actually becoming greater over time though. I admit that I like this beer so much because I am a sucker for hoppy Saisons; in all honesty this could certainly use a touch more of a characterful yeast / fermentation influence, even though this is certainly in evidence here."
"Since the Saison / Farmhouse ale style is so open to interpretation I think Garret Oliver and the folks at Brooklyn did an amazing job here."
"I would definitely drink this one again. Its not typical of the style, but highly enjoyable none the less. Highly recommended."
"This is a MUST TRY saison! It is a very well balanced beer with delicious hops."
"D- In drink this beer I realized that I could easily drink another 750ml and at 7.6% that is an excellent aspect of drinkablity... cheers!"
"An interesting saison that that has the hoppiness of an IPA. The buttery character seems out of place, but overall nicely put together."
"Had this one recently at Flying Saucer poured from the 750mL corked and caged bottle into a tulip glass pours a hazy straw yellow with a nice frothy off white head that slowly diminishes to a thin layer and leaves slight lacing on the glass. Aroma is a nice amount of lemon zest and Belgian spice. The taste is a nice blend of biscuity sweet malts, lemon and citrus hops and a nice amount of Belgian spices. The beer is quite light, crisp and smooth with decent carbonation. This is a very enjoyable beer, one I would love to have again."
"A saison using a specific, Japanese developed hops - I wanted very much to like this beer if only for the innovation. But, I just couldn't. The hops varietal had, to my perception, a very off character, a bit funky but not in a good way. The mouthfeel was also a bit light and fizzy, and not a good fit with the hops burden the beer was attempting to bear. Not for me, and I gotta' call 'em like I see them."
"my girlfriend is a big fan"
"Poured a corked and caged 750ml into my go to Saison glass, my Hennepin globe. This beer pours a crystal clear golden hay with a massive eruption of 5 inch, frothy white head that leaves some sticky lacing down the sides of the glass. The aroma is zesty lemon, fresh cut grass, and salt-less, Saltine crackers. Oddly enough, I detect just a little blue cheese. The flavor is simply and refined. Bright lemon zest, just a slight tangerine, grass and pale German malts. This beer is really simple and straightforward but very elegant in its simplicity. The mouthfeel is just about perfect. Dry enough that it leaves the mouth lingering for another sip but full enough that it coats your mouth in dry grass and lemon. Brooklyn makes great beer and this is no exception."
"Feels a little sharp on the palate, but not wholly unpleasant. Overall this beer kinda reminds me of one of those nefarious ""Belgian IPAs"" made with American hops. Pretty drinkable due to crisp light body and spicy hop finish. Not exactly what I'd call beautiful."
"D: I wish that I had squirreled away another bottle or two. I was floored by this beer at BCTC 2009 and out the bottle it is nearly as majestic."
"This concoction leaves the palate dry from front to back. The combination of a saison with sorachi hops is a winner. This is a creative brew from Garrett and gang."
"D- A nice use of these rare hops; the lemongrass really comes out nicely and stands-up to the Belgian yeast flavors."
"These Sorachi Ace hops are quite odd. The underlying saison seems well-made, but I'm on the fence about this hop strain and the hops are rather strong. The beer is a pale yellow with a foamy white head. Good looking, but that's not really atypical of the style. The aroma is a bright splash of lemongrass/grass/herbal hops. It's sweet-tart citric with some fruity peppercorns, as well. The yeast aroma is muted but nice. The grain seems good and fresh, but it's overpowered by the hops. The taste starts bright and sweet but ends quite dry and with a tartly bitter hop bite. It's oddly soapy, like a lemongrass hand soap, and I sort of enjoy it. Mouthfeel is full but light - interesting use of champagne yeast for bottling. Definitely easy to drink for the abv. It's a very good beer that I fear I'm rating a bit low, but saison is a strong style."
"D - an excellent beer for a hot day, and a pretty darn good one for a cold day, too!"
"If Brooklyn doesn't make this again, I hope someone else fills the gap."
"750 from WF, Georgetown a few months back"
"Very drinkable, best when cooler, warmth did not do this one any favors."
"Drinkability: A very nice beer that showcases the unusual flavours of the sorachi ace hop. Worth buying a second bottle to age."
"Loving the Sorachi Ace hop right now. And loving the way Brooklyn showcases said hop in this delicious saison. Pours a vibrant orange-tinted golden hue, nice large head atop. The aromas pouring out of this beer are pretty unreal... Deeply layered and complex. Starts of with a heavy dose of mango hops (the sorachi ace is the mango hop in my opinion), deep and fruity, and plenty of classic saison earthyness and dust. Excellent fruity esters from the champagne yeast. Really interesting, and I'm almost getting an umami or ripe cheese overtone here... Crazy. This beer is superb on the palate as well. So much going on. Again hops forward, mango to the max, but in a super floral juicy way, not much bitterness, though remains quite dry. There is a nice fruity aspect to this beer too - great yeast and bottle conditioning in effect. A deepness to it as well, a la Belgian tripel or something. Rustic. Super soft yet lively mouthfeel, delicious. Could definitely drink this all day long, given a keg and a day off. This beer is clearly paying homage to the great Belgian saisons, but is just another great example of an extremely creative American interpretation. And as such, it becomes something else entirely. Amazing, would drink again."
" D- I just couldn't get past the strong soap smell and taste but there is a great saison underneath. Oddly enough the saison underneath is what kept me drinking the whole bottle. The last glass took on a natural lime-base cleaning taste similar to simple green."
"In the past, I've found Brooklyn Brewing's Belgian releases a little less than impressive. Sorachi Ace is easily a couple of notches above what they've done in the past. This is a very well-rounded Saison. I might prefer a tad more Belgian yeast, but that's nitpicking it. It's impressive stuff. Grab a 750 if you seen one around."
"Overall, a very nice saison with some interesting flavors. The hops were more grassy, but sharp. Pretty drinkable as well."
"D - This is a hard beer to describe, but there's something very pleasing but complex about this beer. The nose didn't excite me, but the taste does. It's as if everything is in perfect balance. Really a wonderful beer."
"Wow, what a fabulous beer! Served at proper temperature. Poured with a good sized, white, foamy, frothy head that lasts a while and a bit of lace. Color is a clear medium yellow. Aroma is yeast, fresh hop that smells like weed, malt, grain, fruit and a bit of citrus. Flavor is similar but with the hop tasting only like fresh hop; good pungency which is true to style and a little sweetness in there to balance it all. Body is perfect mouth filling and almost champagne carbonation. Finish is like flavor and short except for the great burps! Wish I had more to make it a session. This is superb!"
"D - Exceptional. I absolutely love this beer."
"M&D - super dry, very similar mouthfeel to a champagne, this doesnt deter from the drinkability, a superb brew"
"Drinkability is very high. I could sit and drink this all day without getting mouth fatigue. Very nice beer. Seek this one out."
"D - This is a very pleasant take on the style."
"O- One of my new favorite Saisons, a style near the top of my list. Excellent balance of what makes a Saison a Saison."
"Brooklyn beer hasn't always pleased me in the past... with a few notable exceptions. Sorachi Ace is an inspired creation, though, and is one of the best American-brewed saisons that I've had in many a moon."
"Pours cloudy lemon yellow with a big sticky white head. Aroma is ok, a little lemon, little funk from the new hops I think. The taste follows but more amped up. Nice clean lemony/citrus flavor which follows with a almost sake flavored finish. Its very unique and very good. Very refreshing and easy to drink. This Sorachi hops might not be for everyone, but I think its a great addition for this style."
"Served: June 2010 @ Ginger Man"
"Notes: Starting to think that I don't care much for this hop. A decent brew, but out of balance."
"Drinkability:This is a refreshing, medium spicy ale with a lot of complexity. I really enjoyed this one."
"D- Overall, Soriachi Ace is a winner in my book. It is another solid beer from Brooklyn Brewery."
"Overall - I think this is quite a solid brew. Not quite as interesting as I was hoping, but solid nonetheless. As a side note, this paired quite well with greek yogurt."
"Drinkability -- I was waiting for this for quite a while and it exceeded all of my hopes. Not incredibly complex, but the flavors that are present really sing. One of the better saisons I've had in a while. Keep this one in rotation, Brooklyn!"
"D- Very tasty beer. I could have easily drank another one, maybe two tonight. Every drink made me want another. Very solid beer, wouldn't hesitate to buy another if I saw one."
"D: it's definitely drinkable, in the same way that a nice cold Sapporo or a light lager is on occasion, but it didn't have much in the way of stand out attributes I would expect from Garrett. Certainly not worth the price of admission. Also I found the cheese pairing Pete raved about pretty uninspired and dull."
"D - Complex and refreshing. A bit messy in the taste."
"D: This had a bright and crisp taste with nice smooth body. The alcohol was well hidden too, so it was easy to drink. It seemed like an IPA blended with a saison, which to me is an improvement over a standard saison. Quality brew!"
"They did this one right. It seems like American craft brewers have learned to perfect the Saison, I was enthralled by Sofie, this one takes my enthrallment to a whole new level."
"D: Excellent drinkability. Balanced but light, active-but-subtle carbonation make this one a winner. I wish I had the proper cheese to go with this (not sure what that would be -- someone ask Garrett Oliver -- but I'm pretty sure this would go very well with the right cheese). I have a feeling this would go nicely with a variety of lighter foods - maybe certain Thai, seafood, or even a lighter chicken or pasta dish with a cream sauce."
"Drinkability? I don't think I'll drink much more than this bottle."
"Really dry and crisp mouthfeel with a pretty light body. Overall a quite enjoyable and unique saison."
"F: Finishes lighter with some lingering wheat and light malts, some light pale hops win a little faded astringency with citrus and lemon zest. A slight dryness."
"D - A very interesting offering and great example of the Sorachi Ace hop... Not sure this is something I would drink on a regular basis, but it was easy enough to work through and I would gladly welcome again in the future..."
"D: A good dry citric summertime quencher, though as previously mentioned maybe not as much as a farmhouse/saison as I would like. Light and easy enough to manage with just the right amount of citric bitterness. Hardly feels like a 7.6%."
"Mandarin orange color with a fluffy four finger head from a pour into a mikasa tulip. Smell has a definite lemongrass/lemon lime presence with some yeast showing through. Taste is very peppery and spicy with a cilantro/parsley presence lemon rind and lemongrass are present as well, interesting stuff. Mouthfeel is slightly viscous and very dry at the end. I'm fine with one bottle at a time and there are far more saisons i'd rather have, but it was worth a try."
"Drinkability: An eminently quaffable, soundly complex saison, with, thankfully, not a drop more alcohol than is needed. I really enjoyed this one, Brooklyn."
"Drinks all day, very softly, very cleanly."
"D - Very! Grassy/herbal notes may cause some fatigue after extended consumption, but residual sweetness and mouthfeel make this exteremely palatable"
"D: Definitely a unique taste, but I think I'm good with having it just once."
"This beer is beautifully clear in its expression of complex notes, while at the same time withholding just enough to be a little mysterious. Has a long finish that lingers and unfolds on the palate. I imagine this would be great with food, but was equally great by itself with some company. I especially love Saisons these days - but with that caveat, I feel I can say this was one of the best beers Ive had. I am in love. Many thanks to Ryan for picking up this bottle and sharing it."
"Cheers!"
"Tastes very perfumey. Bleached out lemon, effervescent carbonation, leather tannin, cedar wood. Tastes like what organic furniture wax smells like. Very dry beer with a sharp carbonation accompanied by a peppery zip in the finish. Aftertaste has a nutmeg character I'm not fond of and a lingering phenol. Light body and lively carbonation. Overall, not flavors that I like, but I don't like the saison style. The flavors are in line for the style and it's quite dry, also to style."
"Great beer, if you run across this buy it and enjoy it."
"This is a nice saison from Brooklyn and I am definitely glad to see that the sweetness which I recall being overpowering on draft has been muted a bit with the bottle conditioning. The flavor of this hop strain is certainly different, but it works well. A nice beer that is worth picking up if you see it."
"A fairly complex beer, an interesting drink. Tasty. I split the bottle over two nights with an airtight seal and it held up well. A good drinker, but the flavors tired my mouth a bit."
"Bottom line, if you enjoy the saison style and are looking for something a little interesting, this beer fits the bill."
"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a tulip-shaped glass. Golden with lots of haze. Plenty of bleached white head is produced due to lots of carbonation. It eventually subsides into intermittent lace. Aroma is predominantly bananas, with a hint of cloves and mustiness. Carbonation bite up front. Noticeable acidity in the middle reminiscent of a citrus twang. Very pleasing light finish that leans towards the dry side. To date, I have had nothing quite like this. Contrary to the description found under Saisons, I found it to be on the delicate side with little bitterness. The spicy/fruity Belgian yeast characteristics are noticeable in the aroma, but not as much in the taste taste, which was very light bodied and acidic. A must try."
"D - Good flavor and very interesting. It's got a nice European feel to it. I'd go back for more."
"Mouthfeel was medium to dense in body. Tiny, tight carbonation. Interesting, I would drink it again."
"750ml bottle purchased at McKinnon's in Salem. Pours a hazy yellow-amber body with a good couple inches of white-ish head that persists for a while only to leave a fair bit of lacing on the glass. Citrus - particularly lemon and pith - rule the aroma, giving off a slightly cat pee like scent. Lemon, lemongrass, pith, with notes of orange and tangerine. Medium bodied with effervescent carbonation. Very drinkable - alcohol is well-hidden and one sip invites another for sure. Very good, though the Sorachi Ace hop flavor and aroma take some getting used to..."
"Super clean flavors of citrus (including pith) that is downright nervy on the palate. A very, very pretty beer with loads of nuance. I would imagine that you'd get a whole new set of flavors if you let one open up or age for a bit."
"Poured a slightly hazy straw color, with a finger of white, decent head retention, and decent lacing. Nice crisp bitter herbal note in the nose, much more than I would expect from a farmhouse ale. Hay, grass, slight menthol, and peppery notes also emerged. The taste was a perfectly balanced spicy/herbal mix, that progressed to a bitter dry finish. No hint of the alcohol content. The body was between light and medium, and not overly carbonated. Very drinkable; VERY refreshingly dry and bitter. Surprising for a farmhouse ale."
"D: A good beer with a variety of complex flavors, yet still revealing a good bit of hoppiness, even if the hoppiness comes through in a manner that is not in the typical sense."
"D - Very enjoyable saison. Full of character in the aroma and the flavor with a great appearance...who could ask for more? The hoppiness is a bit high for my tastes in a saison, but this is really being nitpicky trying to find something wrong. Definitely a must try for anyone who enjoys this style of beer."
"Lemony hop flavor with some wheatgrass and clean pilsner malt. Farmhouse yeastiness is disappointingly absent, but the nice hop flavor and bitterness mostly make up for it. Light, creamy mouthfeel with ultra-fine carbonation. What a great summer brew, fantastic! I would like to see more beers made with this hop, I think a pilsner would be a good style for it as well."
"A bit clean and sweet for a saison but a pleasant drink."
"Big ol' bottle split with a friend, poured into a Duvel Tulip glass. Hazy Yellow, with a thick white everlasting head, with some lacing. smell is a little spicy and characteristics of the nose are the lemony citrus and grain. It tastes so refreshing on another 90 degree day in Ohio. . Very mild malt backing to this brew but at times it does come across a bit spicey and mildly sweet. The spice has to be from this Japanese hop. Sweet, carbonated (in a good way), and when it warms a bit, I taste a hint of Anise. A very unique beer, that needs to be sold in 6ers....or what the hell...get me a Keg."
"Drinkability: Taste is a bit one-dimensional, but this is still a tasty and refreshing beer- very good for a summer day. Highly drinkable, and its hop flavors truly do stand out from many other beers."
"The mouthfeel is smooth, with a lingering bite of the light carbonation. A fine ale to enjoy slowly, and I'd go for a couple rounds of it before moving on to something else."
"This did not come together all that well for me, as just a Saison, or a beer. Soapy hops just takes over, and there are no other Saison qualities that I can find. Not something I would recommend."
"Pours a very highly carbonated, yellow, pale cloudy color with a big foamy head that leaves nice lacing. Complexities in the appearance are ridiculous. Smells lemony, with some white pepper, a touch of radish and maybe some light minty pine. Taste is very complex, bitter, astrigenty, then sweet, wheaty, bready and some white pepper on the finish. Dry as can be, perfect substitute for white wine. Nice carbonation, might be a tad too high even but solid. Drinkability is high on this one as its so refreshing. drank nearly the whole bottle myself."
"Drinkability is a feature of this beer, for sure. It's unique, lovely, and something I think more people should be exposed to. A huge contender for the most unique and accessible saison in America IMO."
"D - This beer is really something special. The hop character is extraordinary, the lemongrass and basil notes are like nothing that I have ever had before and it was an inspired choice to use them in a saison. The spicy yeast and creamy wheat character frame these unusual hops perfectly and seem to meld with the herbal, citrus character of the sorachi ace hops to produce a very coherent, well balanced beer. There is a really remarkable lemongrass aroma and flavor that, along with notes of coriander and basil reminds me vividly of Thai cooking. This is a spectacular beer, both for the way that it showcases this new hop variety and simply as a refreshing, spicy, and very drinkable saison."
"Pours a milky translucent pale golden color with a massive, fluffy rocky white head. Head has excellent retention and spongey sheets of lacing. Aroma is very grassy, earthy, zesty and lemony. Background of some candied sugars and spices, but something just isn't clicking for me with the nose. The flavor is also slightly off, with strong sweet notes from the champagne yeast and pale malts, and contrasting earthy, zesty, grassy hops without much bitterness from the Sorachi Ace. Mouthfeel is medium full, very soft with fine, light carbonation producing the expected clean dry finish. A grainy, yeast flavor also lingers in the finish detracting from my enjoyment of this. The flavors in this don't quite mesh as smoothly as hoped for, pulling down my opinion of this otherwise fine, unique beer."
"This is quite the tasty and intriguing brew. Brooklyn brewery has paid righteous tribute to an overlooked hop. This Japanese Sorachi Ace hop, care of Sapporo breweries, is quite interesting. Brooklyn has created a tasty quaff centered around said hop. This is quite the hop-centric brew, yet won't turn off non hop heads. The lemon notes from the hops lend a strong thirst quenching quality. The alcohol is kept well in check. My hats off to Brooklyn for creating a tasty and unique saison."
"Overall, my first try of the sorachi ace hop and quite interesting. I enjoyed it quite a bit but in the end the lemon builds up. Great peppery aspect though. High recommend if you can easily get. Available here in TX. Rotation - I like it but $13 and a big bottle limit it for me. If in 12oz format, I'd get a couple singles. For now, maybe one a year in big bottle and a glass or two on-tap. [O;Y]"
"I got this beer mainly to evaluate the hops, and I will be sure to make homebrew with this hops, perhaps a saison! I'll definitely be getting more of this brew. Very well done! Go Brooklyn, and make more!!"
"750 ml corked and caged bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a hazy straw gold color with a couple inch frothy white head. Head retention is excellent, with a decent amount of lacing too. Aroma is herbal and spicy hops, and some lemon peel. The taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, but there's the addition of some grain/bready malt and peppery spice. There's also a lingering bitter finish. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium with high but soft carbonation. The soft carbonation works great for this brew and makes it smooth and easy to drink. A pretty enjoyable brew overall, Brooklyn has a winner with this one!"
"Particularly good with crab cakes."
"Right on!"
"My hat off to Mr. Oliver! Thank you..."
"Extremely interesting beer. I always like tasting a single hopped beer, and particularly when its such an interesting one as the Sorachi Ace hop. Pours a slightly cloudy, but glowing golden with a mousse-like head that sticks around and leaves some sticky lacing. Very lemony aromas, with particular emphasis on the zest- slightly bitter and oily, but with the bright, zingy essential aromas of the lemon. The taste is extremely complex. I can't put my finger on all the elements there, but the overall impression is of lemon meringue with a touch of pith mixed in with a zest accent on top. More pith than zest here, quite bitter, but in that particular pithy way, and with some creaminess on the finish. There is also a good deal of herbalness, but I can't put my finger on what herb(s) it reminds me of. Quenching and drying 9in the mouth, this is a Saison to contemplate."
"D: This is a very good beer that drinks very well. The addition of the Ace hops really add a good lemon/lemon rind character to this beer."
"The mouthfeel is light and it's highly carbonated. Drinkability is good, it's light and refreshing with some good hoppy flavors. The beer really shows off the Sorachi Ace hops very nicely but also integrates them very well into the beer. I didn't find it outstanding in any particular category but it was very solid beer in all categories and very good overall."
"Bottle from Premiere. A unique and vry good creation. I like this hop and was very excited to try it. Lemony, above all. Whitish coloured body with lots of foamy head. Lemony aroma. Dryish, fruity, white pepper,zesty, yeasty,coriander,pear. Easy mouthfeel."
"M/D - smooth light body, really light and refreshing for the abv. But doesn't end dry like I expected. I'd like to see it in a 6-pack at normal price. Wouldn't drop the cash on a bomber again."
"It's delicious and refreshing with a warming alcohol taste at the end and a dry mouthfinish."
"Drinkability: I really like this beer; perhaps I would prefer it to be just a tad dryer but that is only a quibble"
"I am biased, however, since there is yet to be a brew by Brooklyn that I dislike."
"Cheers!"
"Poured into a tulip, Brooklyn's Sorachi Ace appears a slightly hazed light straw yellow color with a monsterous head of white fluffy foam for a head that is more than 2 fingers strong. The head displays amazing powers of retension. Right down to the last sip more than a finger of white fluff remains. Patches of white lace cling along the glassware where the head previously came into contact. Aroma of this beer is a little spicey and a bit soapy but the prominent characteristics of the nose are the lemony citrus and grassy smell brought on by this unique type of hop. Throughout the experience, it is interesting how the citrusy lemon character flip flops with the grassy character to try and overtake the other scent. The taste of this brew is light and refreshing with a very lively level of carbonation that tickles the tongue. For a style that should be well carbonated, this one is on the verge of being over the top with carbonation. Upfront there is a spicey flavor that is mildly peppery but turns to a slight hop bitterness heavily flavored with grass and lemon zest. Very mild malt backing to this brew but at times it does come across a bit spicey and mildly sweet maybe a bit like pear but for the most part it finishes quite dry. The lingering flavor of this brew is all lemon and grass. I have had other samples of beer that had hints of lemongrass but this one really brings it home and is enjoyable without feeling like I just sprayed pine-sol in my mouth or under my nose. Very drinkable, I would enjoy this one again but wow I certainly wasn't able to detect the 7.5+% abv this has."
"D: This is mainly a showcase for Sorachi Ace hops. Judged on those terms, I would rate it as a success. Not my favorite saison, but tasty nonetheless."
"Beer pours a clean yellowy straw color with a wonderful light foamy white head that lingers and then stay to leave nice lacing on the glass. Smell is overly citrus with small hints of spice. Tast is very citrusy lemon with hints of spice and a dry sweet finish. Mouthfeel is light and bubly but not overly carbonated. Very smooth mouthfeel. Drinkability is superb with this beer a great one to have on a hot summer day wonderfully balanced and not too high in ABV. Brooklyn has yet to let me down on their beers."
"Poured into a New Belgium glass pale yellow with a thick white head. Not much of a scent to this, especially missing a belgian yeast smell I find in most Saisons. Tastes very sour/bitter, an odd variety that I can only account to the Sorachi Ace hops. The champagne yeast is very noticable as well. The mouthfeel is par for the style. But other than that, I don't think I enjoy this sorachi ace hop very much. Might just be me."
"When I think Saison I do not think hops, which makes Brooklyn's focus on hop selection for a Saison puzzling. Regardless, they nailed the bone-dry, citrus-infused, Belgian vibes I expect from a Belgium-class Saison."
"D- Very good beer. I will cellar a case."
"D- Very good beer, but certainly not a sessioner."
"drinkability - very drinkable, light but interesting with a lots of subtlety in underlying flavors."
"My oh my, now THIS is interesting. Zesty citrus peel snaps at the front of the tongue with each sip, while a grassy, floral hop bitterness is reserved for the lengthy finish. Yeast adds hints of white pepper and dough. Malts could use a bigger presence, but that's a minor nit-pick of a decadent beer. Mouthfeel is insanely bubbly and almost flutters across the palate in its lightness. Crisp, refreshing, all that AND a bag a' chips! Reminds me of a less wheat-heavy version of Brooklyn's Hopfen-Weisse (one of my favorites). An exceptionally unique take on the Saison style, Brooklyn fails to disappoint. Grab this one while you can..."
"I like to see breweries like Brooklyn be innovative in making and using rare and exotic products to their product lines.Poured into an oversized wine glass a hazed lemon yellow with a large blossoming white head that clung like glue to the glass as it settled very slowly into a frothy mass.So much going on in the nose it took awhile to pinpoint everything,white pepper,grass,herb,and as others have noted a bit of cedar,light phenols with some clove showed thru as well.Flavors are quite dry and spicy with lemon being most prominent,a big spiciness rolls thru as well,somewhat medicinal in the finish.This is different and I like it,I normally dont single out a saison to buy,this I did and am happy for it."
"A nice extra catch when I found the BCBCS. It pours a somewhat hazy (though mostly clear) plae golden straw capped by over a finger of bright white foam. The nose comprises lemon zest, a light funk, cardamom, hay, and mandarin oranges. The taste goes somewhat sideways: notes of grass, hoppy citrus and bitterness, greens, stinging lemon and lemongrass, garlic, and a very light butter in the background. Something is heavily amiss, though. I must just not like the sorachi variety, I guess. The body is a very light medium, with an active carbonation and a dry, strangely dusty feel. Overall, a pretty large disappointment that I chalk up to a distaste for the sorachi and the weird dusty feel."
"D-Interesting beer. A dry bitter ""farmhouse"" ale. the Sorachi Ace hops are pretty strange. a mix of lemon soap, pine, and kitchen spices. This is good, but I don't want another bottle. I'd like to try a Sorachi Ace beer that didn't focus entirely on the single hop strain."
"Kudos for making a dry and hoppy saison, and getting it to Texas! Extra kudos for single-hopping, using an exotic hop, and re-fermenting in the bottle with Champagne yeast! Def. worth trying."
"D: Quite drinkable, my first experience with the sirachi hop and an enjoyable one. Looking forward to having another bottle of this fine brew."
"Overall, a nice crisp and bright saison. can be a bit watery at times in my opinion. I wish there was a way for the flavors at assert themselves more."
"D- I would look for this as a summer beer. I tried this a year ago on tap at the brewery, and in a bottle it was just as good. Could easily have finished the bottle myself, though I'd need to hide it from everyone else."
"This was my first beer made with Sorachi Ace hops and if it's any indication of how others will be, I imagine I'll be wanting to try them to."
"D - very enjoyable, leave it to Brooklyn to introduce an entire new unknown strain of hops and make it shine. great unique Saison."
"Overall a really nice and different beer. I really enjoyed this tremedously."
"Thanks to Andrewinski1 for sharing this. Poured it into a tulip. Lots of fluffy white head that was monstrous! About three fingers! Gives a hazy straw color. The smell is kind of hot, kind of peppery with hints of orange zest. Lots of orange taste and grassy hops in the background. Kind of a spicy aftertaste. Light in the mouth and the carbonation is pretty spot on. Crisp and refreshing on the warm summer evening. Light and easy going down. Great summer beer."
"Attractive bottle dispenses a fairly clear, dark golden brew with a just-off-white head that pillows up and holds. Wow. Amazing hop character right off the bat in the nose that is very lemon-centric, which also carries notes of citrus, flower and earth. The backbone contributed by the yeast and grains is spicy (pepper/clove? almost non-existent), biscuity and earthy in it's own way. Hops dominate though. Taste is lemony flowers with sweet notes and pepper just before the finish that is wiped away by a zippy heat from the booze, crisp carbonation, and what tastes to me like preserved lemon. As it warms, it seems like some light sweetness comes out and the spiciness in the middle seems to show a bit better. Very nice showcase for a really great hop. Unfortunately, I fear that this unique new hop is the soul of this beer, and if it were to be stripped away and replaced with a more traditional variety in a more traditional level of ibus, you would end up with a very well-made beer that may seem a tad contrived, exhibiting clean, textbook yet conservative, ""saison-style"" flavor. Very impressive. Very well made. Nowhere close to becoming a classic, although full of classic flavors. Great beer, just lacks soul for me."
"This is a very pleasant and drinkable summer beer."
"M/D: MF is surprisingly thick despite ample carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, enjoyable overall."
"Taste is pretty good, it's a bit funky and zesty but it's not over the top like helios. The Sorachi Ace makes it quite smooth and bright. Mouthfeel is your standard brooklyn bottle conditioned beer mouthfeel, needless to say it's great. Dry and crisp with a ton of mouth filling carbonation."
"Pours a hazy golden color with a thick and frothy eggshell colored head that retains nicely. The aroma is also nice, with minty and floral hop notes upfront, along with green apple and pear, lemon rind, funky yeast, biscuity malt, and some honey. The flavor has a really unique hop character upfront with notes of mint, lemon and flora, along with some honey, biscuit, funky yeast, green apple and pear, and a little alcohol. The mouthfeel is sprightly and drinkability is excellent. I thought this was an excellent and unique saison, flavorful and unique."
"D- Overall this is a great, hoppy, slightly dry, enjoyable saison. ABV is pushing 8% but is not noticable at all throughout the profile. Garret Oliver shows here for a second time that he really knows how to make a great saison/pale belgian ale."
"And the not-so-strong? I must admit, I was expecting more from this brew. There is a big, biscuity malt presence that I wouldn't say is par for the Saison style. But the main flaw I see in this beer is an annoyingly buttery flavor-- dare I say, diacetyl aftertaste. This doesn't fit into my definition of ""crackingly dry", as the bottle proclaims. Clean this butteriness up, Brooklyn, sub in a bit more Saison funk, and you'd have an awesome beer."
"Drinkability: A nice hoppy and bitter saison. Certainly different from others I have had in the style. Taste wise a kind of a mix between Blue Moon, a hoppy pils, and a saison. A nice summery beer I could have a couple glasses of."
"D - goes down nice, but I can't have more than one."
"The beer pours a hazy gold color with a white head. The aroma is strong lemon with some wheat and Belgian yeast. The flavor is lemons with some oranges. I also get some wheat, yeast and grassy hops. Low to medium bitterness. Very soft, creamy mouthfeel and low to medium carbonation. A very good saison."
"I think this beer is very crisp and dry, and very refreshing."
"Drinkable as a novelty, but certainly not something you want a few glasses of. This is a very interesting hop which needs the right combination of ingredients to be palatable, but I don't think this is it."
"The unusual hop flavor is the highlight of the beer, balanced with malt while allowing the hops to be the primary taste. Long-lasting and exceptional aftertaste, with a lot of taste between sips of beer."
"Straw yellow in color. Huge head going on here. Great lemony and heavy citrus aroma. Very crisp flavor. Mildly lemon like and very fruity. Touch of sweet malt going on. Long, lingering lemony sweetness in the finish. Great mouthfeel here. Very, very drinkable and enjoyable. I recently used this hop in a homebrew but over did the bittering hops. The lemon/citrus qualities were still very apparent. A bit pricey-damn enjoyable."
"Taste-Very crisp, lemon essence, coriander notes, snappy earthy hop notes, peppery. Very flavorful and refreshing, bright and zesty. Delightfully complex yet ""gulp-able"" in its drinkability. An instant classic. Top shelf all the way. Truly ""sunshine in a glass"". Get some!!"
"I'm not draining the bottle with tremendous quickness, but it'll go. You can polish it off yourself, but probably better to share it and pair it."
"D: Decent all around, but I can't see buying a lot of this. It seems like a really special bottling, for a fairly average beer."
"Overall: Brooklyn Brewery has some quality beers and some outstanding beers. This beer falls under the quality section. Nice and refreshing and easy to drink with a crisp lemon-fruitness. The $11.00 price for a 25 ounce beer is a bit much, especially since I can easily name 5 other Saison/Farmhouse Ales that are more worthy (Flying Fish for starters). Cheers!"
"This beer was eating raw lemongrass, very potent and flavorful. Missing those traditional saison elements such as yeastiness, but i really think this beer was constructed to show off the hops. If you like lemon, you'll love this beer."
"Notes: First encounter with the Sorachi Hops, I think, although this particular sense of flavor is something that I feel I have encountered before but I can not put the finger to it... Great craft from Brooklyn in any case. Outstanding Saison that I would love to see coming back at least as a yearly seasonal offering."
"d - An ok saison. Nice fruit and citrus taste. Would give another shot."
"D: One or two bombers with a friend or two on a hot summer day would be nice."
"Honestly, I was a little disappointed. It's not that it isn't great, because it is. It has an almost buttery smoothness to compliment the citrus hops and spicy yeast. But with all the preamble, I was really looking for something that could break into my All-Time Top 5. It's not quite there yet, but Brooklyn clearly has a winner on their hands. It's more easily drinkable than I expect from a beer in it's class, and it has a knock-out combination of ingredients that make for a fresh and unique, yet classic taste. Aces, indeed."
"D: Very drinkable, this is a great summer beer for those that enjoy some carbonation to mix it up once in a while."
"Drinkability: pretty nicely balanced, crisp and clear, a little funky for a bit too long, but it comes back into harmony."
"I like it. Well worth the price. I would much prefer to have it on tap as I'm curious as to how the flavors will taste fresh. Regardless, if you enjoy Brooklyn's offerings, this is another can't-miss."
"Out of a 750ml corked and caged bottle. Pours a slightly hazy honey straw color with a huge pure white head that slowly settles leaving some thick lacing and a chunky cap. The aroma is sweet and spicy. Light pale malt, candi sugar, white pepper, clove, and wild flowers. Good phenolic aromas from the yeast. The taste is of the candi sugar, clove, coriander and pepper. Then comes the unique hop flavor. A sugar laced lemon flavor comes through imparting a dry and slightly tart note. It has some grassy/hay like flavors as well. The yeasty flavors don't come out as strong as it did in the aroma. The feel is light and extremely fizzy, sweet yet dry, finishes balanced. Not a traditional saison. I find that a lot of the ""funk"" "tart"" flavors comes from the hops. The beer has a good belgian base but the hops make it grassy, tart, and something that you can sense was made in a farmhouse. Another great brooklyn beer. Hopefully this is a keeper."
"D: I would definitely have this again--its light and refreshing qualities make it a perfect saison for a hot summer day."
"Comparisons to Duvel come to mind. But these Sorachi Ace hops obviously deliver bold floral notes and moderate spiciness. The carbonation and mouthfeel is very similar but the malt sweetness has more of an impact here."
"It almost appears as if they upped the dosage of the sorachi hops and maybe added a bit more malt or sugar to the bottle version. I remember the tap version from last year being lighter, more spritzy, and more sessionable which really worked well for this type of hop. I think the bottled version goes too big and takes something away. It's not as refreshing."
"This is one of those beers that you could drink all day on a hot summer or warm spring day. The only think keeping you from it would be the price."
"Seems like quite the polarizing beer! Count me in the camp of ""enjoyed it"". What I love about trying a new saison is that you never really know what you are going to get because of the number of unique yeast strains used in their preparation, and in the case of many brewers, the use of unique spices/herbs. Knowing that going in, I was still surprised at the distinctive burnt rubber smells of this beer and spicy finish. Not for everyone, but I loved it! I also walked in with a preconceived notion that hops would be in the background only, and was again surprised at the modest astringency of this saison. Any comparison to a well hopped Fantome is reasonable, which also tend to be polarizing and confusing beers. If you are looking for predictable and boring, look elsewhere."
"Beer is light in body and quite hoppy. Lots of carbonation in the mouth and it finishes cleanly with no aftertaste. There is a growing bitterness in the back of the mouth. The midpalate flavors are a lot of tropical fruits like papaya and mango. Its relatively subtle. I don't really get saison from this but I'm not sure what I am getting from this. There seems to be a disconnect. It all tastes fine but its not coming together for me. I can't give it a bad review because I like all the parts but I don't put cheese on my Chinese food either. Check it out if you are curious."
"Honestly it drinks like a very complex light lager to me."
"I have had this a couple times from the tap, but this will be my first time from the bottle. The color is golden straw, with tons of air bubbles, and a very large, frothy white head. I have to say that when I tried it last, it had a sort of burnt rubber aroma to it, which I attributed to the Sorachi Ace hops. In this case, there is still some of that, but significantly toned down, and more dominated by tropical fruit such as papaya, mango, as well as some dry grain. The flavor starts out on the sweet side, with the fruit coming through nicely, and then ends on a more bitter note from the hops. The mouthfeel is lively, and quite nice on the palate, with prickly carbonation. One glass is enough for me right now, though I will definitely be finishing this bottle over the next few days. Unfortunately, the problem with this beer is what it is centered around: the Sorachi hops. At least for me, this is not a preferable varietal. On the flip side, good for Brooklyn for jumping on this new hop strain."
"A solid beer overall. Wasn't sure what to expect from this one, but it worked well. Very drinkable."
"Loved the spices at first, but major citrus comes out (reminds me of Barrel House Hocking Hills Hefe from over a decade ago, not now). A very refreshing brew and an excellent follow up to an Avery Czar. It has a dry finish but very refreshing. A great body with medium head. Very happy with this brew, cannot wait till the Deli gets more."
"D-Quite complex and very interesting. I like the IPA/saison combination as the qualities of both shine through and compliment each other. A delicious and intriguing brew. Kudos to Brooklyn for taking a chance and making it work."
"Lighter bodied with some earthy hops and zesty spice. Hints of pepper, ginger and corriander along with a slight metallic flavor which is kind of off putting. Slightly cloying with a long dry finish."
"D - Very complex and unique single hopped ale with quite a pungent nose to boot. I enjoyed this one immensely and I found this particular hop to work exceptionally well with the saison qualities."
"Overall I thought this was a uniquely tasty beer. Sorachi Ace is an interesting hop and this beer gave it the opportunity to shine. Worth a shot."
"D-I don't know if this is really a great representative of the style but it is certainly a tasty and thirst quenching beer."
"D- Good, you could stick with this beer anytime and enjoy it (but watch out it's 7.5%)"
"Reviewed on 8/12/09. Growler from Bellport Beer & Soda. Pours a hazy golden yellow with a small white head. Aroma of lots of spices (pepper, clove), lemon, melon rind, and wheaty malt. Flavor is quite powerfully spicy on the initial sip (peppery mostly, maybe some spicy hops) with a wheaty/grainy (corn and rice grains too) finish and some sweet fruits and lemon. Interesting beer and pretty tasty. Not exactly a session beer, but it worked fine!"
"Pours a cloudy bright straw color, fluffy white head, decent retention and lacing. Smell is of grass, yeast, bread, clay, lemon and slight herbal charachter. Taste is grassy and yeasty with a nice hints of lemon and bread, with a faint spice charachter in the background. Crisp, clean and refreshing. A very good and unique saison."
"Overall, never had a beer with sorachi ace before, but I really like how it added a new dimension to what would have been a pretty standard saison. These two are a perfect match IMO."
"I tried this on tap at The Great Lost Bear in Portland, ME on 10/30/09. Poured into a 16oz shaker pint. A nice tight one finger head died down to leave behind an elegant, thin lacing above a bright yellow, slightly cloudy, nicely carbonated body. The nose is intense on this one, big lemon, spicy hops, a lot of floral notes, and the slightly funky, damp brett. The taste is very floral, rose hips, a little lemon, a bit of black pepper or coriander, some nice notes from the yeast, very nice bitterness. Light bodied with lots of cleansing carbonation, nice dry finish. I could probably drink a couple of these, not sure I would though, it's nice for what it is but a little too floral for my taste."
"Served at the Tap & Mallet, Rochester, NY. Pours a relatively clear, light golden color. The head is pretty much gone by the time it arrives at the table. The smell is dry, herbal, CO2, slightly medicinal. The taste is interesting. I would definitely consider this an American style Saison. Residual sweetness despite trying to be bone-dry, a mouthwatering punch of citrus-like flavor, but a nice take on the traditional hops used. I don't know much about these Sorachi hops, but I do know they seem to be the American equivalent of Saaz, IMO. They have the same light, styrofoam-grassy taste, but they also harness that west coast American piny flavor. All in all, I would like to see a more traditional Belgian Saison, bone dry and more subtle in the flavor department, but the hops are full of character, nonetheless."
"D Great drinkability since it is at one time tasty and light. 4.5"
"The beer is very clear, light golden color, with a thin head that clings into lace wherever it touches glass. The Sorachi Ace hop is just as described, a lot of lemon citrus, no real fight with the pale malts for aromatic dominance. There's a fair amount of spice and what smells like honey in there too. The taste is damn near perfect, I like this hop and I like it's presence in this beer. Lots of lemon citrus and light floral tastes, this is delicous with a light touch. A somewhat thin body which matches my expectations for the style, overall another excellent beer from Brooklyn, outstanding."
"Poured a pale golden slighty hazed hue with a bright white head, appears almost pils like with very nice intricate lacing as the head settles. Aroma was spicy with a funky welcoming yeast edge with a very nice citric and tropical hoppiness about it with a touch of coriander or other spice addition possibly? Flavor has more of the spicy citrus and herbal hop blend from this rare varietal of hop, a nice zesty edge to the whole experience sweetness is balanced with some dry yeast flavors in the finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied very sessionable brew comes off quite nice and definitely intrigues the senses with each sniff and sip. A complex satisfying drinking experience that was very unique and it reeled me in, I hope this makes it's way back to the beer drinkers."
"Wow! A really unique beer. Pale straw gold and hazy. Medium bodied. Good head retention. It's spicy, lemony, and woody, no doubt due to the Sorachi Ace hops. In another beer brewed with them, I found them to be almost cedar-like. That's not the case here, but it is a bit woody, at least as far as dryness goes. It's a great combination: dry and bitter, but infused with citrus and some minor yeasty phenols. Interesting! Weird! I love the contradictions it offers, and also that it's not really that complex either - everything is put right out there on the table. A great summer beer. I would love to see this one brewed again next year!"
"Drinkability: this beer was extremely quaffable and one could have a few of these without getting bored. One of my new favorites from Brooklyn."
"I found the brett character very similar to rye. It was a little overwhelming as I continued to drink this beer. It's still a worthwhile brew to try."
"This beer is very easy to drink, and makes a perfect warm summer's day beer. Quite nice."
"medium-light body,lively carbonation.adds alot to the drinkability.pretty good,not as good as what i was thinking it would be."
"Nice job, Brooklyn."
"A real triumph for the Brooklyn brewery. A brew that really showcases what may be Japan's best contribution to the brewing art. This is one of my top ten beers of all time, maybe a top five. A perfect beer for review # 200."
"I ordered this beer knowing nothing about it. I vaguely recognize the name, but I don't know from where. BA says it's a farmhouse ale that was only brewed once, so I order one. It is served to me in a 12oz pint glass, and it looks good. A finger of white foam that goes tot he top of the glass atop a full pour of golden orange beer. It's translucent and has plenty of bubbles rising to the surface; I'm expecting some high carbonation. It smells sweet and spicy with a bit of floral hops hidden in the back. Wow, there is a really interesting taste to this beer. It has a strong malt character reminiscent of some other high quality farmhouse ales, and a unique aftertaste that is bitter and alcoholic. I bet that is the Sorachi Ace hops showing their stuff. It has a full body and decent mouth coating properties. I can see myself drinking a few of these, but not too many. It feels strong, and the aftertaste may not feel so impressive after a few rounds, but if you see this one on tap, I recommend getting a pint. It's another great Brooklyn beer."
"I got the lemon, & the grass, but not the lemongrass. Not my favorite, but pretty unique. :)"
"Growler from DeCiccio's in Ardsley, NY, enjoyed this one so much over the course of this hot and sunny summer day that my review is of the final pour, cloudy lemony/medium apricot light amber, creamy off white head, leaves plenty of tongues of lace as well as mighty fine looking sheeting. Simply delicious saison, mega lemon, soft pineapple, fruity hop bomb of a saison. Love saison, love fruity and aggressivly hopped saisons/Belgians. Gonna run back ASAP to hopefully get more of this nectar. Fine work Brooklyn."
"M/D - nice and crisp, refreshing and great tasting. I could have had this one all day. Definitely one i'll seek out again."
"Brooklyn brewery in a while."
"Overall: As someone mentioned below, I had one of these then switched to something else. This was so alluring, I wished I would have had another."
"D: I liked this beer but it is not really a saison as the bartender pointed out. Somewhere betweeen a tripel and a Belgian IPA. Still a decent beer."
"d: I tried this at the Drafting Room and they had several beers I wanted to try. I couldn't pull myself away from this though. As a saison, this is an interesting experiment. As a hop showcase, this is a clear winner. I can't recommend this strongly enough."
"Drinkability? This is at my comfort level for the style, abv wise, but a Saison has to bring their A game to keep me interested for the whole session. This one surely did that so for me, it is very damn drinkable and surprisingly refreshing. A superb job by Brooklyn!"
"M&D - Very clean and fresh as soon as it hits your mouth. A little sour but it's inviting. Very easy to drink and highly recommended."
"D-Very nice and light. A little too much lemon limits the drinkability for me."
"Overall a very nice summer saison. This beer should be made in bigger batches, bottled and promoted for summer."
"An exceptional beer. Glad to try something so unique and refreshing."
"Overall, quite enjoyed the Sorachi hop flavors in this and very fun beer to drink. Recommended."
"Pours a straw yellow with a dense, two-finger head, fairly clear. The smell is honeydew melon, hay, a little funk, some barley. The taste is more grain, lemon zest, mild funk, an intense bitter finish; it gets deeper and more complex as it warms. The carbonation is full, and it's medium in body: good to start off well-chilled, in this respect, but that's kind of at odds with the temp. at which it tastes best. It's an intense but enjoyable quaff; a couple of pints are plenty."
"D: Spicey farmhouse ale that you will find from others but still has the body with hops which I'm not sure which and a strong malt backbone. Something I look forward to trying again."
"A very interesting beer made with very interesting hops. I'm not sure how many of these I could drink but it is definitely worth trying. Had a glass at the local beer bar and it definitely had great appearance and carbonation and an interesting and unique flavor. A little weaker than i expected but a very good beer to try."
"A big beer, not a subtle beer--and that's where I think it falls short. Brooklyn doesn't really impress when it tries to do complex, high-end brews, because they tend to blur together. Blindfolded I couldn't say I could pick this out from a Local 1. But maybe that's just me."
"D- MMM-mmm is all I have to say. This is a great beer that will define this summers beer for me. This is a tasty, refreshing brew that I will continue to seek out as much as possible. I will say that Farmhouse is a loose style, I would never have guessed this to be one."
"A kickass beer that I can't wait to try in bottles!"
"I had this beer at the Vermont festival on 7/18. I was well into the festival by the time I came to this beer, so may review may be a bit off. Very aromatic hoppiness. Very floral with fruity notes. A different hop flavor or something. It was very drinkable as I spent a ticket on a second sample. I ordered a sixtel for this weekend, so I plan on getting to know this beer better. Definitely a unique beer."
"I found this to be a very drinkable beer (I had a full growler of it last Friday night), but at 6.5% it is NOT the session beer that its initial color might lead you to believe. Some may find it too flowery for their tastes, but I thought it was a beautiful beer in its delicacy. Will definitely look for this again, before it's gone forever."
"this time much leaner and not as much murk. not as herbal but just as cream of a head. seems a bit easier to take. very floral this time around. definitely a honey saison with a twist. hops had the same lemon grassy but also very pollen and a very slight sweet pineapple. but not something that made the whole beer sweet. style a large about of flower qualities. chamomile, dandelion, and honeysuckle. much crisper though. clean with only hints of a dense herb. actually quite similar to the Bière De Miel Biologique by dupont this time around outside of the that still unique but interesting miso soup doughy i mentioned earlier. better this time around though."
