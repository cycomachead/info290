Served in a Prairie Teku glass, the beer pours a hazy gold color with about an inch white head that fizzled away quickly.  However, there's a lot of lacing.  The brew smells like lemon peel, peaches, white wine, oak, and some funk.  I think the taste is just like the aroma, but there's the addition of some green grapes/grape skin.  It's also nice and tart.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's refreshing, a bit coating, and has a good amount of carbonation.  I liked this a lot, but it's pricey at $20.99 a bottle.  Definitely worth trying!","bluejacket74","Sep 28, 2014"

4.35,4.8,,,,,,"Overall (4.25): Hell of a beer. The price is a little prohibitive, unfortunately, but forgetting that, it’s a great example of why sours are still the future of craft beer. Any wine lover should be able to appreciate this beer, in addition to the beer geeks already in the know, and it feels like a crowd pleaser for anyone with a discriminating palate (and plenty of folks less interested in such things, too). My only gripes are that the mouthfeel could be smoother, the oak could be more understated, and the fruit could pop a little more. But the sour dynamics are spot-on, it drinks like a champ, and is as refreshing as a cold shower in the tropics. Love it.","fmccormi","Aug 12, 2014"

4.31,3.9,4,4.25,4.5,4,4.25,"easily one of goose islands best, halia is a wild belgian saison type aged in wine barrels with peaches. im guessing chardonnay barrels here, the acid is right on for that, as is the body infused into an otherwise rather light wheat based brew. great color, hazy burnt yellow color, shining bright brass when i hold it west towards a setting sun, crowned by just less than an inch of frosty white lace. the nose is peachy, awesomely so. a million peach beers taste fake or no fruit at all, this is right on, juicy and ripe, and the effervescent carbonation tickles my nose, a welcomed addition and improvement over some others in this series, wine tannins are there, white for sure, and the saison yeast and brett complex is remarkably more tart than anticipated. the flavor too has a great tartness to it, low on acid, but high in pucker. the peaches stay strong from the nose to the flavor too, especially in the finish when their sweetness and softness is front and center. wine barrel character is enormous, sharp but also mellow from the oak, a nice dichotomy of textures. finally, the proportionality of it all is what impresses me the most. not too much peach, not too little. dead on between wild ale yeast and saison or belgian yeast. not too much barrel, but certainly prominent time in them. a great balanced and interesting beer, that seems perfect for the first real warm night of the season. maybe overpriced, but i like this a whole lot, and appreciate the extra 15ml in these bottles, that last sip really is sweet!","StonedTrippin","May 18, 2014"

3.41,-17.8,3.5,3.75,3.25,3.5,3.25,"Luckily for my poor ass, VDubb's brother was willing to share this bottle with us. Good man. It pours a partly-hazy gold topped by over a finger of lightly cream-white foam. The nose comprises white grape must, mildly-funky citrus, cracked wheat, light Belgian yeast, and a touch of black pepper deep in the background. The taste basically mirrors the smell, though with more funk, mostly growing on some faded fruit that they tell me is a "peach". Sure, whatever you say, he says, nodding condescendingly. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, there isn't enough flavor (especially in the peach department) here to warrant the price tag. In the end, it comes across as a week, lightly Brett-ed, lightly fruited saison. Not a bad beer, but a thoroughly disappointing one.","TMoney2591","Apr 26, 2014"

Pours moderately hazy bright golden amber color with a 2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big tart peach, pineapple, lemon, pear, apple, white wine, clove, pepper, hay, straw, grass, musty funk, wheat, cracker, bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of peach, yeast, brett, and moderate malt notes; with great strength. Taste of tart peach, pineapple, lemon, pear, apple, white wine, clove, pepper, hay, straw, grass, musty funk, wheat, cracker, bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy tartness/spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart peach, pineapple, lemon, pear, apple, white wine, clove, pepper, hay, straw, grass, musty funk, wheat, cracker, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity of tart peach, yeast, brett, and moderate malt flavors; with a great fruity/spicy yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome brett fruited saison. All around great complexity and balance of peach, yeast, brett, and moderate malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 23, 2014"

I especially love the fact that you can somewhat manage the level of sour based on the temperature at which you drink it. If you're new to sours, grab a bottle, pour a glass and take a few sips straight out of the fridge. Then let it sit a little while and take another swig after it's warmed up to something closer to 50°F. If it hadn't been so expensive, I might've tried to grab a second bottle to see how much it sours over time. Oh well.","LambicPentameter","Jan 12, 2014"

There is no fruit on the nose. You get some of the Belgian yeast esters and a bit of oak. The taste is loaded with lactic/yogurty tartness. The base saison does come through, but it is certainly an oaked beer. You get hints of the white wine barrel, but the barrel seems to have really killed the efferevescence in the mouthfeel. I just don't know where the peaches are. That was the lone reason I bought this beer. It would satisfy you if you're looking for a tart saison with some wine character, but if you tell me I'm getting peaches then I want it to taste like peaches. This one was a far cry from Gillian for me in terms of delivering the flavor. I only got hints of peach when the beer came close to room temperature.","PHBoiler","Jan 02, 2014"

The peaches come through bright and clean. Not terribly jammy. There's some lacto sourness and a touch of funk. The beer tastes mildly sour - picks up a bit as the beer warms. Again, the fruit is relatively strong and quite pleasant but not very jammy. Rather dry. More wine barrel flavor. Seems like a mild, buttery white wine. Finish is fruity and pleasant with a strong tannic oak note. Mouthfeel is a bit effervescent. There's more body to the beer than I'd expect from the flavor. This beer doesn't have the depth or complexity of some fruited sours, but it's very pleasant and easy to like. I can't really find a fault with the beer. It would be an excellent choice for someone new to sours, and I don't mean that as a slight. It's tasty, fun to drink and unlike most other fruit sours.

Not much oak with just a touch of wood/toothpick but there is a really strong sweet vinous fruit flavor with light grape, raisin and buttery Chardonnay. This is followed by some peppery spice, possibly coriander or grains of oaradise, wild bugs and funky farmhouse yeast. Some grass and hay-like flavor along with musty brett and crisp light fruit, especially cider and pear. Light, crisp and refreshing with nice flavor but it's lacking depth and complexity. The white wine flavors are pleasant enough and this beer is very easy to drink, but I just wish that the peaches and farmhouse/saison flavors were a bit stronger.

I might have like to have more peach taste and aroma in this. In addition, there was a large amount of carbonation, more than I typically enjoy. Finally, the taste is more so lactic than funky. I think this brew drinks great now, but could really benefit from spending a couple years in a cool dark cellar, as the wild yeast develops a funky taste and aroma, and the carbonation calms down to lend to a smoother drink. Well-done from Goose Island. I'd drink it often if I could afford to!","MCain04","Dec 11, 2013"

The nose offers aromas of acidic tartness, a touch of butter ala oak influence, and moderate tannic peach skin. It smells fantastic. The oak influence definitely stands out. The beer drinks light and smooth with a wonderful, slightly rich and buttery mouthfeel ala an oaked California Chardonnay or an aged Russian River Temptation. The flavors are very well rounded. There is a nice tannic tartness from the peaches and the beer has the perfect level of acidity. The brett is present in the near perfect amount. It all goes together so well. The drinkability for this beer is very high, further increasing its appeal. Overall this is an exceptional sour. Juliet has long been my favorite Goose Island sour but I've been longing for Goose to do a blond sour that I can get behind. That sour is Halia.","aasher","0"

I thought the nose was awesome and had a lot of peaches, but that didn't translate as well to the taste, which had more spice and citrus to it. A good beer for sure, but not worth the $30-40 I've seen some places trying to charge for it. I'd love to try it again sometime, but personally would picked up Juliet or Lolita again before this one.","mdfb79","Nov 16, 2013"

Aroma heavy with Belgian yeast (brett), flowery, with notes of white wine, with a slight earthy funk; almost BPAish. Didn't really pick up any peaches in the aroma or the taste. Otherwise, flavors of pale malts, white grapes, a rather controlled acidity/tartness, brett, and some barnyard notes. Light-medium body, slightly prickly mouthfeel, but seemed like it might get a bit chewy if not consumed at a cooler temperature. In other words, this is basically a bottle to share, and I wouldn't tackle it on my own (especially for the price at which I've been seeing it). Decent, but not too memorable.","Rifugium","Nov 16, 2013"

I won't profess to be an expert on sours but i've had my fair share of them at this point and I can say without hesitation that this is one of my favorites. For the price tag, I wish it was a little less drinkable to be honest.

4.26,2.7,4,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,"Served on tap at the Micro Brew Review in Oak Park. Pours a hazy gold with pillowy white head and heavy lace present. The aroma is peach forward with ripe peach flesh paired with moderately acidic notes and a bit of oak. A small amount of tart cherry Taste features an initial tartness which is followed up by juicy notes of peach. The fruit juice quality picks up intensity towards the finish and has a clean mildly tart finish. The peppery notes that typically give saisons that spicy bite is present, but very mild. A very small hint of farmhouse yeast character is present, but is mainly overshadowed by the peach which I appreciate in this instance. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing. A terrific offering by Goose Island and a very refreshing and moderately sour saison. Certainly worth a try.","homebrew311","Aug 10, 2013"
