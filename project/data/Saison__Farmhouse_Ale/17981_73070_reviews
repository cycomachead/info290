"Taste like a salad. Kind of strange"
"They definitely nailed with the ""cucumber"" part of this, but that's really it.  The flavor to me was more like a light ale with pickles."
"Had this beer from a bomber recently and back in 2012 so I will try to bridge the two tastings. Then it had overwhelming tastes and smells of cucumber. Also rather creamy, perhaps too much and not much crispness or hop. Now in 2015 this beer definitely mellowed out. However that could be because I drank it over six months after its bottling date, not intentionally fyi. Cucumber flavor and smell was still there but not as much as before and still quite a good beer. Also seemed more hoppy and carbonated to the point where there was a massive head even after a slow pour. I think this style and flavor of beer is a fantastic idea but needs some tweaking. Like some sort of twisted beer Stockholm syndrome I want my over the top cucumber flavor back."
"Too much cucumber taste for me, but it's a nice beer for sure."

"I wanted to hate this, but wow!  like a pickle, but blends into a 'beer' nicely..... probably not really a saison, but very interesting and well-put-together....."
""

"all their beers are so well made. its not my style but makes an amazing Bloody Mary Back"
"Saisons are alright however this one is terrible."
"Pours light golden with thin white head. The cucumber smell and taste are very potent. Also tastes of wheat and light yeast flavor. The cucumber with alcohol almost gives a light dry pickle flavor on the back of the tongue. Nice and refreshing. Excellent summer beer."

"Didn't think I was going to be a fan, but this was a lot of fun. The cucumber was not overpowering, but had just the right balance to make it goo."

"Pours a clear deep golden color.  The aroma is like that of dill pickles.  The taste is also very cucumber forward with pickle like flavor and a small dry yeast in the finish.  Hard to get much grains in the taste over the pickle.  Light bodied ale that would drink easy if it tasted better.  Overall, this is not good."

"Both the aroma and the flavor feature  cucumber flavor, although it unfortunately comes across as past its prime.  Nice mix of sweet, tart and bitter components until the aftertaste which is a tad overly bitter."
""
""
""
"T/M/O taste is also all about cucumber. I am not a crazy cucumber person bit this is really well done and actually quite tasty. Good balance with sweetness. Easy drinking with a crisp feel. Very refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not terribly saison-y, but tons and tons of cucumber for sure."
""
""
"Mouthfeel: The beer is medium bodied medium high carbonation. It feels heavier because I think my tongue is expecting to be chewing cucumber. I don't know what else to say."

"Overall: I was impressed with this one, besides the cucumber this is a nice, refreshing, light saison. The cucumber makes it interesting for me, and I enjoy cucumber, so I like that aspect to it. Would definitely drink again."

"A straightforward saison base with an aroma and flavor of light cucumber. The base beer itself is light and simple with some light peppery saison yeast character. Foamy carbonation with good head retention lends a creamy texture. No obvious flaws. The cucumber is unique, refreshing and easy drinking. I think it pairs well with spicy dishes but overall the beer isn't very interesting."

"O: Great light beer to have on a hot day. Definite cucumber but it's light and still present. Unlike Wicked Weed’s imperial cucumber in that there's has a strong and in the face melon quality. Bought in West Palm Beach Whole Foods, drank on Deerfield Beach, Boca Raton the first day of my vacation, July 12, 2014."
"Not for everyone. You definitely get the cucumber. The smell reminds me of my mother's kitchen when she was making homemade pickles - a pleasant smell but not something I'm looking for in a beer. Got this on a sampler. Don't think I could do an entire glass."

"Ohhhh God.smells like hippy feet and a salad from a cheap hotel buffet. Looks like Miller lite. Tastes like cucumber, but in a way that makes me hope I never encounter them again. I don't know what they were thinking when they brewed this but I won't hold it against them."

"Bottle: Poured a dirty cloudy beige color ale with a super large off-white foamy head with good retention and some great lacing. Aroma of cucumber is actually quiet dominant with some peppery yeast notes also easily identifiable. Taste is dominated by cucumber notes with loads of peppery yeast and some rustic malt notes. This beer is really dry with loads of attenuation. Body is full with limited filtration and good carbonation. A really interesting experience but cucumber notes are a bit too strong to withstand large quantities of this beer – this is a beer I would share gain with multiple friends."

"One of the more unique things I've encountered. Has more cucumber flavor than an actual cucumber. Works well and really is refreshing."
"The sheer quantity of cucumber in this beer deserves some kind of award, as it barely makes sense. If you don't like cucumber, you are going to hate this beer. Fortunately, I do. The saison base is either very mild or just completely dominated by the cucumbers. Regardless, it's worth a try."

"I appreciate the interesting qualities of this brew, but there are just elements missing that get this past drinking ""cucumber water beer."""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- cool beer, cool concept. However follows more of the pickled route than the fresh cucumber route. Most likely due to the age on this one as it was given to me. Will have to try this one again fresh, but regardless this is definitely a vegetable beer without much in way of saison qualities."

"I am glad that I got the chance to try this, because I think it's a nice take on the saison style, and it reflects Florida well. The lemony hope qualities go hand in hand with the cucumber flavor and aroma, and the base saison is strong and achieves the right properties to differentiate this beer."
"Overall was looking forward to trying this one smells good the carbonation just kind of kills it for me. Probably the only Cigar City brew I have not loved."

"O - My girlfriend picked this up for me in Florida. I was eager to try it. I expected overwhelming cucumber. It was prominent but not overwhelming. I liked the lemon and honey flavors. They complimented the cucumber giving this beer a refreshing quality. I probably would not drink this all the time, but it made for a nice change of pace. It also was a great post mowing beer."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 5/29/2013. Pours lightly hazy bright golden amber color with a 3 finger foamy and rocky white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big fresh cucumber, lemon, pear, pepper, clove, coriander, floral, herbal, grass, cracker, and yeast earthiness. Nice and unique aromas with good complexity of yeast esters with big cucumber presence; with decent balance and good strength. Taste of cucumber, lemon, pear, apple, pepper, clove, coriander, herbal, grass, cracker, bread, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of lemon, cucumber, pear, pepper, clove, coriander, herbal, grass, cracker, bread, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of yeast ester, cucumber, and malt flavors; with a nice malt/spiciness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. High carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice and unique saison style. Well balanced yeast ester, cucumber, and malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"O: As a vegetable beer, this hits the mark. The cucumber dominates both the nose and the flavor profile. However, as a Saison, this beer fails. Instead of the cucumber complementing the Saison characteristics, it instead dominates. I'd dial down the cucumber addition by at least 20% in order to get a more balanced brew."
""
""
"O: Interesting, but still clean and refreshing. A nice take on a saison."
""
"O-Easily better than the Flat 12 cucumber beer. Still not sure if cucumbers belong in beer, but this one at least is enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"Super cucumber flavor and aroma that blends in nicely with the base farmhouse yeast."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours (almost gushes) a pale gold with a monstrous white head that fades slowly. No lacing to speak of. The smell lives up to the name, like a freshly sliced cucumber. Some spice notes waft through with a slight whiff of honey. Taste more subdued than aroma, but cucumber and pepper are the first notes followed by a nice malt backbone. Finishes dry and spicy. Light bodied and highly carbonated, it has a crisp mouthfeel that make this a good summer beer. Overall, a well crafted and refreshing quaff. Good job Cigar City!"

"In what may be the biggest surprise I've experienced lately I found this beer to be quite good despite my aversion to cucumbers."

"O- great on a hot summer day, but needs to be at the perfect temp to enjoy otherwise it can get to taste almost medicinal"

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: See above. I'm glad I had this, and I might be able to slam this on a hot day, it's so cucumbery and refreshing, but it's also a cucumber beer, so again, the jury remains out. I will say I'd like to have another to further feel it out."

"O: This is a very interesting beer. It's not your typical saison, there's lots of earthiness but in more of a cucumber/fresh vegetable/garden way. A very refreshing beer, much like cucumber water at a spa is very refreshing"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Well, it's a cucumber beer, but I'm not as convinced that it's a saison. I like it, mostly based on how it present the cucumber. I want more saison, though."
""
"O - Wow there is plenty of cucumber. Unfortunately its seems far to ripe. When I slice a cucumber for a salad or sandwich - it isn't this pungent. Carbonation level is very high - makes it somewhat difficult to taste the beer while cold. After some warmth it is refreshing. Reminds me of Goose Island's - Sofie. Doesn't have enough lemon. And I constantly keep thinking of my lotion."
"Do I really really like cucumbers???!!! Nope but do I really like this beer???!!! Yes, it is light, refreshing and crisp. It appears golden and hazy. Smells of citrus and cucumber. Taste is of a nice saison, some light fruit and the crisp and refreshing taste of cucumber. Really will clean the palate and could an amazing in between beer if it was available in 6packs (I only found it in a 750ml) Would drink this on a hot day out by the pool any and every hot day of the year."

"Got this bottle in a beer trade and was very excited to try it finally. The beer poured a beautiful light see through yellow with hints of green in it. It smelled like a fresh vegetable garden. I don't care if I was about to drink a beer, the smell is crazy fun. However, upon tasting it you are literally drinking water from a fancy restaurant with cucumber in it. There is a lot of complexities to this beer, but the cucumber is quite powerful. If you are not a fan of cucumber beware, as if the name didn't give it away! The beer is however, very light, crisp, and extremely easy to drink! Just how a sasion should be. Glad I was able to try this guy. Not for me, but a fun unique beer for sure."
"O: Drink this one as fresh as possible since my feeling is that the fresh (refreshing) quality is what sets this one apart from so many other saisons on the market."

"750 ml bottle from ABC Liquors in Oviedo. Pours a golden color with a very slight haze and a medium foamy white head. The aroma is medium with cucumbers, peanuts and more cucumbers, papaya, honey and pepper. The taste, like the aroma, features lots of cucumbers, a tangy lemon bitterness that settles quickly into a grassy finish. Just enough malt to keep the beer actually tasting like a beer. The palate was light and fizzy. A very dry finish invites you back more more swallows. The taste of this beer exceeded my expectations. I found it very refreshing and unique. I have come to expect nothing less from this very creative brewery."

"T: Again, tons and tons of cucumber. The taste hits right away and carries through every single part of this beer. A bit of sour pickle flavor in the middle before a finish that's all cucumber. Slight hints of grain and wheat, but again, this is definitely a cucumber beer. Mouthfeel is slick, a little oily and may be just a touch heavy for this. In small amounts this is awesome. There's really no saison here, but as a cucumber beer, this is really cool to try."
""
"Frankly, this is a beer meant to be paired with food. In the right context this beer would simply wow many people."
""
"Cucumber Saison pours a golden yellow color with light straw hued edges. There is visible carbonation rising up through the beer into the large, fluffy white head. The aroma is muted by the large head, and it seems relatively modest even once the cap is cleared and it is allowed to warm a little bit. The smell is full of cucumber skin, light grains, and a bit of peppery saison yeast. The flavor is over the top cucumber. Even though the flavor is nice, it is simple and really destroys any chance of complexity there could be to this beer. Light grains and notes of pepper add a little bit of depth. A slight vaguely vegetable note comes in at the end. The finish is still more cucumber. The body is a bit fuller than I usually expect from a saison, but it is still on the light side overall. The carbonation has a light creaminess to it, but overall is crisp and smooth."

"To say this is an interesting beer is an understatement- very, very unusual, and cucumber plays a starring role here- very strongly present. Now, that's a good thing if you really, really, really like cucumber, otherwise... I like it well enough in the aroma, it lends a crisp, almost floral note, with a residual creamy vegetal nose. The taste is just too much cucumber, though. I have palate fatigue after 1/2 of a glass, and I'm craving something more- a blast of white pepper, some sourness, a heavy herbalness, anything to break the unrelenting cucumber assault. A bit too slick on the palate as well. This one is a miss for me."
""
""
""
""
"What surprised me was how this beer was actually pretty drinkable, given that I am not usually a big fans of saisons or vegetable presence in beer. With that said, this beer could be substantially improved by not trying to bash the drinker over the head with the cucumber flavor. Succeeding as a mindlessly drinkable beer does not translate well into a high rating."

"Overall: a weird beer all-around. Definitely an experience worth having, but I certainly won't be going out of my way to drink another of these anytime soon. Also, like any novelty, a dab will do you -- this would be a good splitting beer."
"Bottle poured to tall tulip. Cloudy light golden pour with a big fluffy head. Aroma of cucumbers, gym shoe, spice, yeast, more funk, light fruit. Most funk I have ever smelled. Very interesting. Flavor is sweet up front with a following wave of cucumber, then a really dirty dusty finish. This thing is nice until that staleness. Light mouthfeel and big carbo. I just cannot deal with this aftertaste. So refreshing to start and them just nasty. Unfortunate as I really enjoyed the cucumber lager. Blah. Can’t finish this and hope it is just a bad bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Certainly unique and very enjoyable in the aroma, but the beer as a whole is not exactly what I look for in a Saison, vegetable beer or any other style."
""
"Confusing and interesting... At first sip the cucumber hits you much harder than anything else. After a few sips, however, those saison spices and dryness begin to blend in a little bit better... At first sip I wasn't sure that I wanted to drink 22 oz of it alone, but by the time I got to the bottom of that bomber, I admittedly wanted a little bit more. Overall, I wish it was a little more ""saison-y", and a bit less ""cucumber-y", but c'est la vie. I wouldn't run out to stockpile this beer (especially if you can get CCB's Guava Grove Saison), but I certainly wouldn't turn down another glass."

"Extremely fresh bottle. Cucumber Saison is a beer that completely delivers on half of it's name. Saison? Not so much. But if you're in the market for cucumber, this is the beer for you. Unlike Magic Hat's new HiCu, this is not a complete cucumber bomb. Instead, it offers a nice, mellow cucumber aroma and flavor, with just a touch of citrus and a pilsner-esque malt backbone. There's a very slight touch of yeast spiciness, but it's kept in check very well. Cucumber Saison is an excellent vegetable beer. Realistic flavor without being overpowering, this is a winner. Just don't expect much in the way of saison flavors, at least when as fresh as this bottle is (bottled last Friday). Perhaps more time brings out more saison aspects."

"But in the end, I rather enjoyed the beer. I wanted the clean, crisp, and refreshing taste of cucumber to show up in its most vibrant and perfumy scent. But what I got was pickle relish. Though I like it on those ballpark hot dogs, its presence in my beer glass is slightly misplaced even though the base saison has much to celebrate."
"Cost: $10 for a 750 ml bottle."
"Cucumber saison is certainly one of the more novel beers I have every had. As one sampler stated, it is like vegetable juice and beer. Poured from the glass, the beer was a golden color with a fizzy white head. Cucumber is the most noticeable element in the aroma. In the initial taste was cucumber, cucumber peal, a little straw and salt. If you have ever been to a restaurant that serves cucumber slices in their glasses of water, this should give you some perspective. The aftertaste is dry, which is the most saison-like element of this beer. The funkiness of a saison seems to have been cancelled out by the cucumber. It was an interesting beer, but probably not one I need to have again."
""
"O-it's a solid brew. I've never had anything like this before. Who even comes up with something like this? I could definitely see this being something wonderful to drink on a hot summer afternoon. I suggest you find a bottle of this, unless you have a thing against the vegetable."
""
""
"O: I found this to be a fairly nice beer. I was rather curious about it when I learned of it and sought on out, especially for my wife whom likes both Samson's and cucumbers, but ended up hating this beer. I on the other hand, enjoyed the combination of the cucumber along with the lemon tartness and yeasty spice giving this one a ""salad in a glass"" feel to it while still retaining its beeriness."
""
""
"O - I'll be upfront (at the end, how ironic) with the fact I don't like cucumbers. They're best served as pickles, in my opinion, but I went into the review open minded. I won't lie, the aroma scared me into thinking my wife, a cucumber lover, would be drinking the vast majority of this bottle, but Cigar City did a fantastic job with this beer. Like a cucumber, this saison has a heavy nose that's lighter in flavor, letting more saison through. It's incredibly authentic and the comparison of the cucumber's crispness with the saison is a wonderful pairing. I still may not like cucumbers but I can get behind this unique saison and say it's one well-crafted beer!"

"Large foamy head with nice lacing on a cloudy orange and gold body. Cucumber dominates the aroma but it doesn't overwhelm with tropical fruit and bealgian yeast undertones. The cucumber flavor isn't too strong but also dominates but has a musty Belgian yeast, breads, cream and hint of tropical fruit. Medium creamy body and moderate carbonation. Much better tha I was expecting. Wouldn't necessarily have again but a must try at least once."
""
""
""
"Mildly hazy, but brilliantly golden in the light. Half inch white cap that diminished to a fine lace of bubbles shortly after the pour. Crisp, refreshing aroma. This is essentially a freshly cut cucumber in my saison! Juicy, light, and the faintest grassiness. Still has a good saison background though. Dry finish, nicely carbonated. Very interesting beer and I'm glad I had the chance to try it."
""
""
""
"A unique and quality offering from CCB."
""
""
"O: Shockingly good! This could make me enjoy cucumber a lot more...well played, Cigar City. This would be fantastic in the summer time."
""
""
""
""
"A wonderful cucumber drink, but an uninteresting saison."
"On tap at Churchkey. Served in a mini snifter. Pours a clear light golden color with maybe a touch of cucumber. That’s unfortunately there’s the only place with just a touch of cucumber. The nose smells like cucumber juice. It tastes like cucumber water. Light body; no real beer character. It says saison, but I don’t get any sort of pilsner or bready malt, nor is there anything indicating saison yeast. Just cucumber. It doesn’t taste bad, but it’s not beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - this is a really unique, albeit totally 'accurate' saison infused with cucumbers; I'm not a huge fan of farmhouse ales or cucumbers for that matter, but if you like either, it's def worth a try"
""
""
""
""
""
"I would never turn one of these down. It is not just distinctive and unique. It is a flat-out delicious beer, and testament to the creativity of American craft brewing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel-Is very light and crispy medium bodied. Pretty fizzy as well."
""
"I found the cucumber! Its in the flavor! I get a nice (which I hardly describe this as nice) grainy flavor followed by that cucumber freshness. It actually tastes pretty unique and it's kind of amazing. Well balanced, moderately high carbonation, and a medium body with a little slickness to it. Not too bad, I may not try it again, but I'm glad I did."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: An interesting beer that I wouldn't buy often. A bit more novelty than anything else but thumbs up to Cigar City for featuring a non-traditional ingredient and getting it to come across clearly in the final product."
""
"Pours a hazy straw colored yellow with a fizzy one and a half finger fizzy head. The head recedes fairly quickly to a thin foam cap with minimal lacing. The nose is a fairly delicate aroma of farmhouse yeast, grass, light citrus, spice, and not surprisingly accents of cucumber. Lemongrass, light citrus accents, a bit of peppery spice, farmhouse yeast joined midpalate by refreshing cucumber. Finishes dry with slight cucumber skin-like bitterness. Light bodied, fizzy but subtle carbonation. Very impressive beer. Although enjoyed on an unseasonably warm 80 degree fall day in Chicago, this certainly is an exceptional summer ""lawnmower"" beer. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Well, I am glad I tried it and, while I like cucumbers and I like pickles, I didn't much care for them in a beer; my scores are higher than otherwise out of respect for the creativity"
""
""
""
""
""
"Okay, cucumber? Really? All right... This stuff pours a hazy golden straw topped by a little over a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises light wheat, cucumber, and mild clove. Wow, the cucumber's really prevalent, but it doesn't really overpower you. Right on. The taste brings in more of the same, as though a beer was somehow made to taste like a more complex, flavorful glass of cucumber water. The cuke comes through a tad sweeter than usual. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly refreshing finish. Overall, I was skeptical about the potential success of this stuff, but it turned out to be highly enjoyable. Go figure."
"O - Cucumber is there for sure, interesting. I hate cucumbers, but this one was ok."
""
"O - This reminds me of cucumber water you might have at a southern wedding. It's light, crisp & refreshing. Definitely delivers."
""
""
"M - Light body. Moderate carbonation."
"O: Being someone who loves cucumbers, and enjoys saisons, this was a must try for me. Great aroma, and pretty tasty, but I would have liked a more traditional saison flavor base. Im glad I got to try it though, and Id certainly recommend."
""
"Simple, quick, direct. I've disliked cucumbers since I was a thirty-two week embryo - & now my wife is going to force me to try them again. Maybe I'll like them...another instance of beer changing a man's life. Very good beer."

""
""
""
""
"Amber colored with lots of white foam. Aromas of light pickle and very light citrus . Flavors same as the aromas. This is one tasty beer that screams hot dogs or hamburgers to go with it. A great summer beer that is refreshing and a great cookout beer."
"Overall: This beer lived up to its name. I really enjoyed it, but don't think I'd want it again."
"Overall a fine beer and certainly one to try. Avoid if you don't like cucumber, because this beer is all about it."
""
""
"Pretty good beer except the cuke goes a long way. Poured at a good temperature with a nice, billowy, foamy, off-white head that settles after a bit and a smidgen of lace. Color is a a hazy amber. Flavor's like nose, cuke really dominates and offsets all the other qualities. Body and carbonation are good. Finish is like flavor, with the cuke wasn't so assertive, not a repeater."
"Diamonds are forever."
"O: Interesting and unique beer, I think of it as the refreshing spa beer... Very enjoyable and refreshing due to the presence and flavor of the cucumber - sessionable and a beer I would be glad to try again."
""
""

"O: I really found this to be an interesting and unique beer because the cucumbers are well incorporated into the taste (unlike gimmicky beers)."

"Overall, a surprising, successful twist on a saison. This one works."
""
"O: solid saison and interesting beer that had a few beer geeks wanting some more."
"D - Very drinkable. Really nicely balanced with the cucumber adding a really nice element to the beer."
"Drinkability is awesome on this beer. Completely unlike any beer I have ever had and very unique. A great beer any time, but especially one that would be awesome in the summertime. It has been said this is ""a salad in a beer bottle"" and I completely agree. If you have the chance to get this beer, don't pass on it."
"This is a medium to light bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. The alcohol is very well integrated here and the cucumber is surprisingly bold. I think this was an interesting idea and they executed it fairly well. Its worth a try but in the end it just didnt work for me to warrent wanting to have it again. To give you an idea of how bold the cucumber scent is, my wife had no idea what was going on and stated outloud while I was drinking this that she smelled cucumber salad."

"I like seeing low ABV Saisons and it's nice to see some different experimentation going on. Sometimes it doesn't always work but this works. Clean flavors with enough peppery spice to keep it interesting. Nothing overpowers and I feel like it stood up to what I was expecting."

"Shared by caSSino during BRoss242’s send-off party before he moves! Will miss you man! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured a hazy yellow-orange with a one finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, cucumber, spices, and earth. The flavor was of sweet malt, cucumber, spice, earth, and earthy hop. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. If I am honest here, I really like cucumber, however the cucumber in this brew was SO intense that it was almost unnatural. My guess is that they used an extract on this brew as the cucumber isn’t know for being too strong on taste for the most part. While I’m glad Cigar City wanted to try something new I just don’t think the cucumber addition was the right choice on this one. Still drinkable and enjoyable, but there are definitely better options out there to experiment with."

"O - This beer delivered exactly like I hoped and expected. Cucumber! That pretty much sums it up. I love cucumber and I love saisons and this is the perfect marriage. It's so well balanced and well crafted. It's so refreshing. I thought it might be gimmicky and that there was a chance it would be weird and bad, but it's really well done. I'd need for there to be more complexity to score it higher, but as a summertime refresher, it does a great job being very pleasant in its simplicity."
"Overall: CCB made an awesome cucumber beer! Probably the most memorable beer that I have drank from them. The humble cucumber really makes a crazy awesome saison! Probably the best saison that I have ever drank! Perfect for a hot day. I could drink a whole 750 myself. I not much of a cuccumber fan, but when you put it in beer magic happens!!!"

"Cigar city nailed it here. Exactly what I envisioned when I first heard about this beer. Cucumbers, who would've thought of it in beer, would love to know their methods. If you like cucumber in your beer, yes!!"

"Cigar City's Cucumber Saison pours a slightly hazy goldenrod, with plenty of lemon highlights. There's just about four fingers of frothy white foam capping the beer. Head retention is very good, and while there's a little bit of lacing, there could definitely stand to be a little bit more. Amazingly enough, cucumber is indeed the first the to jump out as I take in the aroma. There's a little bit of tropical fruit and citrus present as well, but that's all *very* much in the background. Again, cucumber is the centerpiece of the flavor profile, but the fruity, lemony accents from the Citra and Sorachi Ace hops are a little more present here. In fact, they actually are a little too loud, and clash a bit with the delicate, refreshing flavor of the cucumber. The body is just a little too full for being a low ABV saison, though the carbonation attempts to sparkle through it admirably. Cucumber is definitely on the list of ingredients I never thought I'd see in a beer, but Cigar City has definitely done an admirable job of infusing a beer with cucumber flavor. It's just the rest of the recipe that's a little lacking."

"Oh god. So much cucumber. Delicious! Lemony-vegetal freshly sliced cucumber aroma and flavor with tiny amounts of diacetyl butter that makes me think about those buttered white bread cucumber sandwiches from a British Tea lineup. The beer also does a great job of showcasing the way that melon flavors exist within cucumber. Everything is framed with a wheat-like tartness and plenty of lemon peel, a light and sparkly body makes it drink like a wine spritzer. Very refreshing and unique. I have a hard time believing how well this brew works! But it does!"

"Tastes of, you guessed it, cucumber. That flavor is in the lead here. So far living up to its name! Now it's just a matter of, do I like this vegetable's flavor in a beer. So far it's a yay. When I wait this first few sips out I'm tasting peas. A grassy bite with an abrupt dry finish. Interesting. Cool. This is my first Cigar City beer tried, picked this up while in Florida. The shop had a few selections from this brewery and I chose this one (of course i was seeking their heralded imperial stout to no avail). But anyway, good timing as this was July when bought, early August when consumed.  I think Cigar City must be in the same spirit as DFH is up in Delaware.. that is, unique effort here!! The flavor is biting, (pickly!) and ever-present, and if you like veggies and want a refreshing adult beverage, this is for you. The label and name matched the taste. "
"Thank you Chad! Pours a hazy golden color with a large white head that diminishes at a steady pace. Scent is straight up CUCUMBER! A ton of fresh-cut cucumber with a light, salty aroma. Some black pepper and a hint of mint and lemon. Lacks that saison funk I love in this style. Taste is not nearly as cucumber-forward as the aroma is. Taste is more saison-style. A hint of cucumber with some peppery spice and light butter flavor. Mellow hops with some earthy flavors. VERY refreshing. Great summer beer. Mouthfeel is light bodied, crisp, and refreshing Drinkability is high. Overall, this is a very refreshing beer. Disclaimer: I HATE cucumbers, but I enjoyed this beer much more than I thought I would."

"O: Absolutely fantastic with the only flaw I saw being the appearance"

"Pours a lightly hazed golden straw, full cap of prickly white bubbles. Scent brings notes of cucumber water along with lightly earthy and musty dried grain. Cucumber more pronounced in the taste with it having the full effect on the tail end of the sip, light spicing along with mustyness of sasion base adds a light pickling note. Lighter side of medium bodied, dry. Unique beer with a decent cucumber note... while i like beverages made with cucumber and celery, the saison added a touch too much spice throwing off the cleanness of the cucumber."
"O- an odd beer. Worth trying if you want something different, but I won't be buying any more."

"Pours a slightly cloudy pale yellow. Nose is loaded with cucumber and pickle, wow! The essence of cucumber is amazing, very prominent and works well with mild Saison base. Taste is cucumber forward (feels weird saying this about a beer) and very refreshing. Spicy dill comes through next and a bit of bready yeast at the finish. Mouthfeel is light and highly carbonated. Overall. This is a very cool brew... As cool as a... Nevermind."
"D: For a saison, this is quite different. This is more vegetable beer than saison. If you want a low ABV, watery cucumber beer you've found it."
"overall? best fucking summer beer ever. deliciously refreshing. really want to have more of this stuff on hand, it is too damn good. hopefully they make this a yearly seasonal and not just a one off."

"GOOD, NOT MUST HAVE!"
"Overall I was quite impressed by this offering. If you are not a fan of cucumber, obviously avoid this beer but this was quite a fun, interesting flavor profile to enjoy in a Saison. I don't know if I could drink the whole 750ml by myself but shared with a friend with a nice light summer meal, why not."

"The aroma is very cucumbery with a touch of pickles, citrus, and honey. The appearance is light honey with a small head. The taste is exactly like the aroma. The palate is thin and refreshing. Overall it's a very unique beer with a lot of character but I'm still trying to figure it out."

"Its like drinking a cucumber. I like the concept, and how they pulled it off."

"O: very unique, refreshing and complex brew. Perfect for the hot weather and highly sessionable. Nice job Cigar City."
""
"O: not sure what I was expecting but this leaves nothing to the imagination. Pure cucumber in a farmhouse ale. It's definitely a summer beer. Light and refreshing, but don't think I could have it all the time. I would recommend this, especially if you have an affinity towards interesting, different beers."
""

"Overall: Pretty good beer overall. I like that Cigar City pushes the envelope. Cucumber is not something I typically associate with beer and there may be a good reason for that. That said, it's a solid beer that is worth a try."
""
""
"O: I am not really a huge cucumber fan, but this one is awesome. On top of that, this beer is actually made to the style. Seek out."
"O - Very interesting effort from CCB. Props for doing something a bit out of the box. Nice, not something that I will search out more of though."

"O - Overall, while this is a gimmicky beer it is a damn delicious one. Well worth the 4 pack of HT it took to get to try this. Delicious unique brew that is a shock to the pallet."
"A nice crisp summer beer that is very different. This is about as well executed as is possible for this idea. Their skill is certainly on display. But why?"
"The beer pours a hazy yellow color with a white head. The aroma is full of cucumbers, water and a little bit of biscuit malt. This smells like I think it would if you ran cucumbers through a Jack LaLanne Power Juicer. The flavor is more of the same. I get a ton of cucumber, as well as some biscuit malt, Belgian yeast, pepper and a hint of lemon and orange. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. My only complaint is that I wish the beer was green."
"I really enjoyed this beer, as it focused on cucumber as an unusual ingredient but didn't overwhelm you with cucumber-ness. Very refreshing; another triumph for Cigar City."
"Pours a murky light orange with a foamy off-white head that settles to a thin cap on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain and lots of cucumber aromas. Taste is of grain, cucumber, herbs, and spices. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that has a really spot on cucumber aroma and taste that is quite interesting."
""
"If your looking for a quality saison, look elsewhere. This is outside of the box thinking and experimental brewing, which I do applaud at times. But I don't think this one should have ever left the tasting room. I'd take their Guava Grove or Table Saison over this any day of the week. If your looking for liquid salad, have fun but making a cucumber/lettuce/vodka blend will give you the same effect without spending $12 for 750ml. Hyped up, yes. Worth investing in, no."

"M: Light bodied. Good carbonation."
""
"Pours a hazy amber with two finger of dense white foam, big splotches of lace left on the glass. Smell: holy freakin' cucumbers, they aren't playing. Spicy and lemony behind that wall of dimed cucumbers. Taste: cucumber and lemon, mildly tangy, sugary honeyed-biscuit, then more lemon peel and cucumber into a drying finish. Carbonation is perfect with a light-medium body and a pillowy feel. I like cucumber, but after the initial few sips, I wasn't sure I'd get through a bomber... then the Sorachi Ace started kicking in. A great combo. It's quite tasty, and does a fantastic job featuring cucumber. Bottled 6/8/12."

"Overall, this beer was delicious. The cucumber aspect was spot on. I thought that it was a little different than most Saisons but in a good way, very original. Worth seeking out for sure."
"O- This was an interesting beer that I definitely enjoyed having the chance to try. At first I wasn't sure how cucumber fits with beer (I can definitely see why people might not like this that much), but I definitely think this was a perfect summer beer for a hot night (drinking this in 90 degree summer heat). It was light, crisp, refreshing, well-balanced, and flavorful. If you like interesting beers I definitely recommend picking this up and giving it a try. Not your typical saison, but definitely enjoyable."
"Beer is thin like water and wet like water and tastes like cucumbers. Is this beer? Next."
"Medium bodied with some zesty pepper and coriander spice up front that lingers over the funky farmhouse and bready yeast notes before finishing with a refreshing cucumber melon flavor in the finish. The cucumber is more prominent than the nose suggests but ts not over the top or unpleasant at all. Really light and refreshing, making this beer extremely drinkable. I was skeptical going in but this beer was a surprise sleeper for me."
"O: Look...it was good, and I'm very glad I tried it. Not sure I'll be in a hurry to crack open another bottle, but given the right day & the right food pairing, I think it would be absolutely amazing. Definitely not an all-night drinker. My only real complaint is that if ""saison"" wasn't in the name of the beer, I don't think I would have come up with that for the base beer's style."

"Overall fairly impressed. Wasn't expecting much but it has a good essences of cucumber and pickle, none of the bitter skin either, and a nice refreshing taste. I could drink lots of this too."

"This was really something, I felt like I needed to try this one at the EBF just because of the Cucumber. The beer poured out as a clear looking yellow color with a thin white head on top of the beer. The smell of this is straight Cucumber, I really don't get much else on the nose here. The taste is Cucumber also, I like that it really stands out and isn't masked in any way. The beer is surprisingly refreshing in my opinion. The mouthfeel is clean and carbonated with a light finish. Overall this was just something that really sparked my interest and I was very glad I tried it."

"On tap at Funky Buddha. Saisons are one of my least favorite style, but I will try everyone in hopes of finding a great one. This beer is one of them. This beer is well balanced with the right amount of cucumber in the nose and taste. It doesn’t over power the beer but enhances the flavor. If it wasn’t for the fact, FB had a CCB tap takeover with Virgin Oak Hunahpu on tap, I would have drank this beer til the tap blew. From start to end, this is a great saison."
"Poured a glowing gold with a thin white head that settles to a slight haze. Huge aromas of cucumber and Saison yeast, with a slight pickle brine character. Taste follows the nose nicely, just slightly briny, yet so crisp and drinkable. Just a perfect melding between a cucumber and a Saison, if you can imagine such a thin. Mouthfeel is light and crisp, with a medium body and good, sharp carbonation. Tied with Final Push for my favorite beer of the day, this was an amazing offering!"
"Pours golden yellow with a ring of head. Smells like sushi, actually. Cucumber and that sweet cold rice aroma. The taste is fairly similar to the nose. Sweet, light and refreshing. Light feel bordering on watery. Overall, pretty good. I'd have it again."
"[as of 6/17/12 i have had the newer batch on draft and in bottle fresh. this version was very refreshing light and much more cucumber in flavor without any accompanying brine. May re review when i open a bottle because it was substantially more enjoyable for my palate]"
