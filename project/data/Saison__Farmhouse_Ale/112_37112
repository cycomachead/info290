Quite nice, refreshing, would seak out again.  I really like Old Rasputin as well.  Nice to drink local beers from California.  Fresh and delish.","Kurt_Dog","Jun 15, 2014"
3.45,-11.5,3.75,3.75,3.25,3.25,3.5,"Pours a light golden color with a white head and some lacing. Pours with excellent clarity from tap to snifter. The aroma has citrus as well as peach or pear juice. Nice fruity nose. The taste is earthier but still has a fruitiness. Grassy, milky citrusy hop character works with the fruit and damp hay notes. Fair bitterness, the brew finishes clean and balanced. Overall, this is a pretty decent saison, for an American version.","Stinkypuss","Jun 15, 2014"

Those are all present in the taste, but there's a bit of sweetness present as well. The fruit - banana, apple, grape, some citrus - really comes through with great balance. Medium mouth, but a little chewy. Still, the carbonation gives this beer the crispness you expect from a saison. La Merle will definitely be added to my list of favorite farmhouse ales.","MartzMimic","Jun 07, 2014"

Pours slightly cloudy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of huge lemon zest, peach, apricot, pear, apple, orange peel, straw, grass, pepper, clove, wheat, bread, light honey, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity of fruity/spicy yeast ester and moderate malt presence; and great strength. Taste of big lemon zest, peach, apricot, apple, pear, orange peel, clove, pepper, straw, grass, wheat, bread, light honey, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of lemon zest, peach, apricot, apple, pear, orange peel, clove, pepper, straw, grass, wheat, bread, light honey, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity of fruity/spicy yeast ester flavors with moderate malt sweetness; with an awesome malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with smooth, crisp, and slightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic saison! All around awesome complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast ester and malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 06, 2014"

Simply put, this lacks the funky, rustic character than would classify anything as a saison in order to distinguish it from a strong Belgian blonde ale, which this far more resembles. Not that it's a bad thing - it's still a well made beer - it's just very mild and way too high in alcohol for it to merit practical consumption. North Coast definitely has better Belgian style offerings - this one at least could be a good introduction to someone starting to get into these types of beers.","magictacosinus","Oct 13, 2013"

3.54,-9.2,5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"The beer tastes quite strangely bitter, with a very harsh cut on the tongue. There is a nice light fruity flavor to this beer, much like the smell with spicy hints and very sour feel in the mouth and on the tongue which has got me lips puckering slightly. This is far more of a sour-ale than any other saison I have tried, reminding me more and more of a lambic ale. Carbonation and harsh bitter/sour attacks the tongue right off the bat and hides some of the more slight spicy flavors that seem to exist as ghosts in the beer. The beer leaves the tip of the tongue tingling with harsh bubbles, and thus mutes a lot of the after-flavor as well. Orange and slight pineapple are still present in the flavoring. Overall I feel like the beer sits too sweet and harsh on the tongue which kills other flavors complexity and doesn’t really make it for me. This beer has an awesome bottle and pours very lovely in a glass, but its taste and smell don’t deliver. I rank this a meh beer with an awesome bottle (I really like the bottle if you haven’t noticed…).","Maxwell","Jul 03, 2012"

Actually, I have another gripe- the carbonation is really too excessive, and kills it for me a bit - I'd consider decanting this one and pouring it back and forth between glasses to take the edge off. I'll probably pick it up again sometime to pair with dinner, although I'd pass if I was just looking for something to drink while relaxing after work.","Lawl3ss","Apr 03, 2012"

Aroma has big ripe layers of tropical fruit flowing throughout each sniff, spicy black pepper in the background gets dusted on. I'm getting mango, pineapple, with a mild citrus note flowing pretty amazing levels of fruit move into my senses. Spicy Belgian yeast notes adds another layer, I've never seen this beer in person only on the internet, a case as recently landed in Steubenville, OH and I'm jumpin' on it. Flavor has tropical fruit bursts with a layer of spicy dry yeast cakes, this is an amazingly big juicy fruit spiked with mango pineapple and other tropical fruits. Spicy Belgian yeast flares it's flavor with hints of black pepper spiciness, pretty intense and complex Saison a bit bigger than traditional versions almost 8%. Really coats the palate and the carbonation level is kicking quite nicely, what a robust Saison, usually when brewed in a more Belgian style the effervescence is incredible and the body is rather light or airy compared to this. I'm not going down a cloying road just a more rounded malt body with less airy carbonation with a bit more alcohol involvement than I'm used to within this style It mirrors as a light triple versus a big saison.

Right off the bat it had a nice rich golden yellow color and a nose full of orange rind. I enjoyed the beer, great summer brew, but the finish was a little and I do mean a little unsatisfying for me. The second time I tasted Le merle, (which has an awesome story and bottle art), just wasn't as memorable as the first time.

3.8,-2.6,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"While drinking this, all I could think about (in terms of reviewing) was how much this tastes like Pranqster. There's a big, spicy phenol note after a lighter barley note. The deeper herbal and earthy flavors are missing, like you might find in something from Fantome. The beer is also force carbonated, which makes the beer feel heavier. It's in line with tasty takes on the style from American brewers, but it can't quite stand up to Belgian saisons.","tempest","Jun 05, 2011"

4.02,3.1,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"Pours a hazy golden orange color with visible carbonation. Upon the pour into my tulip glass I noticed a 1.5 inch white head. I believe my glass may have caused the head to recede a bit quickly. The smell has notes of fruit and wheat with a little bit of funk. As I taste the beer the first thing to hit my tongue is the sweetness of the fruit flavors and the spicyness, as it crests my tongue I get a nice dose of spicyness. This beer was a bit thicker than I expected, but the excited carbonation lifts it off the tongue, giving it a light and refreshing feel. Overall, I am quite impressed with this beer, I think I may have found a new favorite summer style. This beer has inspired me to buy a few more saisons and give them a try. The only drawback to this beer is the high price point and the high ABV, I would mug prefer something in the 4 or 5% range to make it a little more sessionable. This is such a great beer, I would prefer to be able to drink it all day.","gkunkle","May 02, 2011"

4.3,10.3,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This beer poured out a cloudy amber with a finger of head that quickly dissipated. There's a nice nose consisting of mild hop bitterness, yeast, and a very slight sour straw-like note at the end that adds some depth. The taste is surprisingly sweet, but not cloyingly so, probably due to the nice tang at the end that echoes the slight sour straw in the nose. The mouthfeel is light, and refreshing. This is a pretty tasty brew, very enjoyable.","RedSpecial1","Apr 12, 2011"

The notes are of grassy hops, fresh plain yogurt, and Belgian candi sugar.

4,2.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Served from champagne bottle into pilsner glass at refrigerator glass. Colour is hazy golden. Pours with one-finger of head which quickly dissipates to a lingering skin of head. The aroma is more reminiscent of an adventurous wheat beer than a saison in that there is little of that 'funky' aroma that one might expect- although it is more present in the flavour. The flavour is also characterized by a subtle mix of clove, light malt, and well-balanced hops- much like a blend of American and German wheat. This is highly drinkable and probably a safe foray into a saison, if not the best example of the style (it could be more funky or farmhouse). But, I say, style expectations be damned and I'll be drinking this one again...","matt20102","Mar 28, 2011"
3.05,-21.8,4,4,3,1.5,2.5,"Get ready to belch...alot! This is a fruit filled Saison that I wish wasn't bombarded with fizzy carbonation, because it had so much potential. The carbonation really hurts the flavors and the overall enjoyment of drinking this beer.","StaveHooks","Mar 27, 2011"
4,2.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a murky, somewhat-dark golden orange color with a LARGE frothy white head that doesn't appear to be shrinking down anytime soon. Scent is very spicy with some strong Belgian yeast aromas and hints of citrus. (When the hell is this head gonna shrink??? I wanna drink this thing!) A bit of funkiness and barnyard aromas as well. Now for the taste... The taste is just as it smells but with a lot more fruitiness and citrus flavors. The strong fruit flavors blend well with the light funk, strong yeasty flavors, and spiciness. There are also some bread-like notes in the taste. Mouthfeel is very dry and crisp, with a spicy finish. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is not the best example of this style, but it's still pretty darn tasty. Not a bad price either.","DovaliHops","Beers"

It is pretty good beer all by itself, but put it next anything DuPont and it will shrink in comparison. I don't recall if this beer was stupid cheap or anything that would justify the fact that it is pretty far off from classic examples of the style. If it is half the price, give it a shot as it isn't infected or anything. Otherwise, I would stick to other more highly rated Saisons.","SkeeterHawk","Mar 18, 2011"

I don't know if I would recommend this as an "intro to craft beer" type of thing, as I feel it was a bit on the complex side, but for sure something that anyone with a preference to Belgium beers should try.","allanplaysguitar","Mar 03, 2011"

Slightly hazy golden colour, huge white head. Sweetish aroma of syrup, farmhouse yeast and rotting fruits / stale berries. High level of carbonation in the mouth.

3.78,-3.1,4,3.5,4,3,4,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass (all we had available at the time). The beer pours a cloudy copper-orange coloring, with some amber highlights in the deep parts. No head. The beer has smells that seem to bounce between a sour and a barleywine. There are some very sweet notes, almost citrusy, as well as some sour aromas. The beer has an initial flavor of light spice, grapes, and alcohol that blossoms into a wide tongue sour taste, with a malty backbone, that fills the mouth. The bold sour flavors carry through to the aftertaste. The beer remains light in mouth, despite the powerful flavors. The finish is sudden, and rather abrupt after the developing nature of the flavor. It quickly retreats, leaving the slightly sour aftertaste in mouth, begging for another sip. Surprisingly easy to drink, likely due to the flavors blending so well.","GarthDanielson","Jan 15, 2011"
3.62,-7.2,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This saison pours a very deep orange honey color. Much darker than your typical saison, also has a bit of viscosity to it which i don't usually find. There is a large fluffy white head that is very thick and recedes slowly, leaving behind minimal lacing. The aroma is very light and delicate. Very pretty floral components, a touch of hop citrus and some grapefruit zest on the nose. The flavors are very well blended together, and i get a lot of floral citrus flavors. The draw back is that it is not light at all on the body. Really viscous and oily body. There is also a bitter citrus pith component that makes this fall off a bit. After the bitterness comes some oily hop residue that doesnt follow the traditional saison. This is good for a fall style however. Mouthfeel is oily and viscous. Medium to heavy bodied and totally palate coating. Drinkability is nice and this really is a food friendly beer. This would do great with a chicken dish or even a lighter style german pork schnitzel dish with lemons. Not your typical saison, but a good value and worth a shot.","Augustiner719","Jan 08, 2011"

Hints of banana, apple, pear and apricot. Sweet, spicy slightly dry and somewhat tart with a clean finish.

The beer is slightly cloudy, but you can see the bubbles rushing through, and the bubbles at top burst, leaving giant caverns in the head. The smell is primarily strawberries, a little overripe, smells of grapeskins, really bready yeasty smells, a bit of herbal, spicy smells - clove, with a hint of lemon and acid. The taste is incredibly grainy, like slightly cooked grains, still a bit raw. The taste is very spicy, peppercorns and lemon, a bit of grassiness. There's a bit of yeasty tartness and bite, with a slight breadiness in the background. Reminds me a bit of a granny smith apple - there's a note of sweetness, but the tartness of the skin kind of dominates. It finishes very dry and fruity. The spiciness becomes a bit too harsh at points, but still nice. The body is quite light, and the carbonation adds to the airiness, and creates quite a bite. Finishes very dry, pushing the limits of dryness and lightness, but I found that as it warmed, it became a quite enjoyable beer.","taylorhamrick","Jan 01, 2010"

A multitude of bubbles flow perpetual from the bottle of the goblet. A bit of yeast and some zesty fruit aromas float patiently to the nose. A slight yeast funkiness may be present, but it might be that I'm looking for it. Anyway, on to the taste. Grainy and yeasty with a spicy layer on the outside and some sourness penetrating toward the end. More lively fruits exist. Goes down dry, with little alcohol noticed. Very drinkable and not too barny (new word I just made up) as some Saisons tend to be. Love this one, and am developing a palate for the Saisons. I never thought that would happen.","stephens101","Nov 30, 2009"

Fits the style of a Saison / Farmhouse Ale. Mouth feel is crisp and sharp with a high carbonation level.

The etching at the bottom of the Chimay chalice threw a nice geyser of effervescence, pretty to look at. Pretty spicy nose, white pepper, coriander, balanced with a fairly big citrus presence, lemony goodness. The taste brings the lemon and pepper to the forefront, with a complex citrus character, lemon, pineapple, mango, not as lemony as Dupont. Hops are noticeable but pushed to the background. Lingering dry finish. A bit sweet, pretty close to tripel in style, but certainly a nice quaffer for a hot summer afternoon.","jdense","Jul 24, 2009"

Retains very well. Lacing spiders around the glass throughout. Smell is adequate if unimpressive, on the slightly musty side as opposed to full blown horse blanket. Taste... this is a very busy saison. It's on the fuller and heavier side as opposed to the lighter and delicate side. Almost like Golden Monkey is to the standard tripel. At first the spicing is a little overpowering, but towards the end it melds quite nicely. A bit of warming booziness. Vivid mouthfeel, really stands out and lingers with the carbonation, almost overly so, but it lingers pleasantly on the palate. An hour easily saw me putting the bottle away.

Light and smooth, goes down easy with some bubbly carbonation on tongue. Just not the greatest taste though, as the tartness from the fruit flavoring seems to override the taste of the fruits (I'm picking up apple, orange, citric) and the sweet malts. Finishes crisp and dry. Not bad, but I can think of better farm ales.","clayrock81","0"

The taste is a bit sharper than some other 8% saisons but very enjoyable. I tasted cloves, apples, a crispness. Mouthfeel is bubbly with some fruit tones, and tart/spice aftertaste.

One of the best American interpretations of a Belgian brew I've had in a while, but the lack of balanced dry and tart flavors and the heavier body make it hard for me to call it a saison. If you like Belgian golden ales, I'd suggest giving this one a try.

Le Merle has a typical aroma of a Saison. Lush, ripe golden apples, pears, apple skins, grass and damp earth. Green apple skins, biscuits, toast and what I would call a hay flavor, are surrounded by a rich pale malt sweetness that pulls all the flavors together. The mouthfeel is light and crisp leaving a great interplay of tingling carbonation on the tip of the tongue. With summer approaching, nothing beats a great saison for a refreshing beer. This is a great American example of a Saison.","hwwty4","Apr 21, 2009"

Champagne-like: bubbly and light on the tongue, with vinous fruit flavors opening into more complex, nutty/earthy flavors. Mouthfeel is perfect-- light, yet full and creamy at the same time. Flavors are bright, complex, and fresh. Hints of hay, hops, and minerals show up at times. Nothing dominates, but the creamy complexity of earth and fruit flavors and the perfection of the mouthfeel make this an impressive beer, especially for the relatively cheap price of $8 per 750 ml.

It's strawberries, lemons, wheatgrass, sugar, a hint of caramel, and a whole lotta makin my mouth water. Taste is drier than the smell hinted at, with tart fruit yielding to a crisp taste and a really clean finish that just makes you want more at the very end. It has an aged cheese taste in there somewhere. The Northcoast guys have outdone themselves on this one. Mouthfeel is creamy, nicely carbonated, and just a hair thin. Drinkability is very good.

Scent of belgian yeast, citrus, and perhaps candi sugar, but fairly subdued overall. Taste consistent with nose. Some tartness attributable to the citrus quality, but very clean and crisp, also some wheat and perhaps green apple. Spiciness was very subdued for the style. Mouthfeel is light, effervescent, as well as tart. Somewhat lacking in terms of the qualities that are characteristic of a farmhouse (e.g. spicy character and farmhouse funk), but very drinkable and a solid tribute to the style.","Jwale73","Jun 30, 2008"

4.22,8.2,4.5,5,4,3.5,4,"Tried this the other night after eyeing it in the store for weeks. Gotta love mark downs. This beer poured a slightly hazy golden color with enough carbonation to give it as many fingers of head as you'd like. Head fell to a finger or so for the duration of the drink. I could look at and smell this beer for days. Immediate smells of citrus, tropical fruit, and a little barnyard lure me in. For me, this nose was almost perfect. The flavor on the first sip was dominated by the carbonation. Made the spice really jump out at me and almost made it feel as though my tongue was cut. The tropical fruit was there, but not as present as the nose would have suggested. As the beer warmed, alcohol became more of a factor and started to detract from the experience due to a little more heat than I would like. Medium bodied, but again, carbonation took away from the mouthfeel. Overall, great beer that I would look to pick up again.","jacamp16","Jun 07, 2008"

Even on the second pour, the head was huge and frothy. Carbonation continues to sneak through the fluid as it sits in the glass. S: The smell has that characteristic yeasty Belgian Saison quality. The underlying base is Belgian yeast but a little wild with citrus, other fruits, and spice! T: The flavor carries a nice hoppy punch at the nose which gives way to a peppery, fruity dry finish. MF: The carbonation is full and tickles the tongue throughout. The balance seems skewed toward the hoppiness, in other words, I could use a little more body to the beer.

2.92,-25.1,5,3,3,4,1.5,"Pours out a slightly chill-hazed brassy tangerine with a wealth of tiny bubbles making their way to the head. Head is massive, foamy, and almost spills over the top. Leaves some near solid lacing on the glass. Nose is very fruity (over-ripe fruits) and candy sweet. I get a lot of peach and mango (which I would normally love, but, as I said, it's more of an over-ripe and near-rotten smell). Has a bit of a grain bite in the nose. Flavor starts off with a candy sweetness and some grainy character which leads into those over-ripe fruits again (but not so overbearing as in the aroma). A bit of an earthy hop comes in toward the finish alongside a dull bitterness and a flat yeastiness. The saving grace of the flavor profile is a finishing dryness and mild background acidity which save this from being an overall cloying experience. Mouthfeel is rather light in body with a jumpy carbonation although it isn't so forcefully carbonated that it pricks the tongue. Drinkability started off OK, but as it warms it gets sweeter and sweeter and the bitterness becomes more astringent. If I ever drink this again, which I doubt, I will definitely be having this ice cold.","goochpunch","Apr 06, 2008"

The head is a solid inch and slowly settles down to a retentive 1/4 inch thick foam. Lots of aroma in this one. Very fruity, mainly citrus and banana. There is a definite tart grapefruit aroma in there too. The beer itself is relatively mild in flavor. A surprise much like my first try of Saison DuPont. There is a nice prickly CO2 body that gives a lot of pepper notes to the semi-sweet, semi-bitter beer. The aftertaste is strong metallic hops and oily at the end. A very good example of an authentic belgian style saison IMO. This is similar to the Jolly Pumpkin's Bam Bière, but has more of that undetectable alcohol than the sessionable JP, again a bit more true to the style.

Tropical fruit nuances dance around (peaches, mango and papaya). Hops give an herbal presence to the beer. The mouthfeel is not as charged up as the appearance seemed to indicate.

Pours a cloudy (almost milky) golden color (first half of the bottle was fairly clear). The smell is on the faint side but is true to the BPA and Saison style; light floral sweetness and some yeast funk. The taste is light and not overly complex, more Belgian Pale Ale. There is a light candi sugar sweetness and a light Belgian spice profile. The beer stays true to the tart side of saisons but doesn't quite deliver the spice or funk of top notch saisons. However the brew does not taste bad, at all. The feel is moderate with very active carbonation, finishes very well balance.

4.16,6.7,3,4.5,4,4,4.5,"This beer seems like it would be a decent starter for a tasting. The malt body is well-rounded and playfully citric and the finish isn't overbearing. I've only had 10-15 saisons, so my experience is limited, but I would come back to this one and probably will.","Lupin","Nov 20, 2007"

3.15,-19.2,4,4,2.5,4.5,2.5,"Drinkability is hindered by the metallic tones which are so hard to take. Served with some nice, spicy or meaty food, it eases down well enough.","ojiikun","Nov 14, 2007"
3.27,-16.2,3,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Pours a hazy straw yellow with a big, but ultimately short-lived, head. There is some hay in the smell, nothing too funky or spicey. Not bad. The taste is a bit "sharp." A good touch of bitterness too, botrderline IPA scale. Not what I want is a Saison. While seemingly smooth in body, this still drinks very high on the tongue. This improves after a great deal of warming, but the quaffability (love that word) is never at the leave a Saison should be. A bit hot too, surprising for its ABV. All in all, an admirable attempt, but not a beer I would come back to.","Onibubba","Nov 14, 2007"
3.03,-22.3,3.5,3,3,3,3,"D: Not really digging this one. Not a lot of balance which I prefer in my brews. This one is a bit flagrant and all over the place.","Westsidethreat","Nov 12, 2007"
3.8,-2.6,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Served up in a Le Merle Chalice with a silver bird on it. Nice hazy orange glow. Decent white head. Nose is sweet, fruity, and yeasty. Taste is true to style, with barny wild yeast and slight hops. Mouthfeel is good, and drinkability is nice considerng the almost 8% ABV. Good saison.","shivtim","Nov 08, 2007"

3.45,-11.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours into the tulip very clear gold with a short finger of creamy head. The smell is fruity and spicy; orange peel, black pepper, and coriander. Flavor is pleasing, but over-sweet compared to the typical Saison. Tart and lemony on the front of the tongue, but becomes peppery in the center. Bursting with orange sweetness and coriander in the finish and aftertaste, with a bit too much lasting alcohol warming. Overly prickly and carbonated in the mouth. A worthwhile change of pace, but atypical and not altogether winning.","dgallina","Nov 03, 2007"

3.65,-6.4,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D - This is a nice saison. It is true to the style to say the least (as tough as it is to pin down saison). I would like to try it aged, but this one isn't really my thing.","mrasskicktastic","Oct 30, 2007"
4.35,11.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a slightly hazy golden with an excellent head that fades to a healthy cap with some medium lacing. The nose is slightly sweet with typical Belgian yeast aromas and also apples, pepper, and honey. Pretty nice. The taste replicates the nose and adds in layers of orange, lemon, a slight sourness, and some slight sweetness on the finish. The mouthfeeel is creamy, smooth, and crisp- and quite refreshing. Nice to see this style increasing in popularity and to see it done so nicely.","Georgiabeer","Oct 24, 2007"
4.07,4.4,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"D, Notes: This, Ommegang Hennepin, and Brooklyn Local 1 are the best domestic takes on a Saisons that I have had. Good yeast, complex, refreshing. Well made and well balanced.","Nipitato","Oct 19, 2007"
4.07,4.4,4,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,"Drinkability is pretty good. This saison style beer really packs a punch in the flavor department, and isn't super easy to sip. But it's very interesting, and well worth a try.","flexabull","Beers"
4.03,3.3,4.5,4,4,4,4,"The appointed Duvel tulip glass was a nearly perfect vessel to hold this pale, frothy, heady Saison. The bubbles just kept rushing up from the etched D at the bottom of the glass, and head showed no signs of wavering. The smell was full of tartness and spice. Fresh cut hay, sun baked earth, and bright marigold flowers in the nose were evocative of some European farmhouse. The taste was very dry, which allowed the tart sourness and spice to play the role major flavor contributors. Also present was some ripe cheese, and green apple, which finally gave way to a dose of hops in the finish, the only apparent concession towards the American origin of this beer. A good balance between delicate and rustic in the mouthfeel department with lightness due to the abundance of bubbles. Not as full of character as the beers from DuPont or Fantôme, but a worthy offering in the style from a surprising source.","rajendra82","0"

2.95,-24.4,4,4,2,3.5,3,"I have mixed feelings about this beer. Three good things about this beer are 1) It has fantastic head retention. After taking a few sips and walking away for several minutes, when I return, there is still a lovely, white froth that almost looks like meringue a good inch thick remaining. 2) The smell is just wonderful with plenty of fruit and yeast and a very subtle "barnyard" smell that you really have to search for. This seemed to be pretty on-point for the style, although not 100%; still nice nevertheless. 3) Lastly, this had quite a collection of yeast and debris in the bottle, which is rather desireable to me. The one truly negative thing about this beer, is perhaps the most important: taste. A farmhouse saison should have a sour/tartness to it, IMO, and this did not. In fact, it seemed much more bitter on the finish, which was rather disappointing to me. I really enjoy this style, and had such high hopes for this drink. It is certainly not a bad beer, but as far as being a saison, I just don't think it is a very good representation of the style.","SilentSabre","Sep 28, 2007"
3.55,-9,4,4,3.5,3.5,3,"Saison is one of the toughest beer styles to compete in due to the high quality and low cost of Hennepin; this isn't equal to Hennepin. This is OK and quite mildly flavored","Zorro","Sep 26, 2007"
4.54,16.4,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"At Hops in Humboldt 2007, this was a cloudy orange with a fat white head and good lacing. Nose is all over the place with orange and grapefruit, peaches, pears, and apricots, and floral hops. A feast for the nose. Mouthfeel creamy and rich. Flavors are like the nose except there are some spices, and the finish is long and slightly sour. Exceptional beer.","rkuhnel","Sep 15, 2007"

4.1,5.1,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a cloudy yeasty orange-ish yellow with an off white head. Aromas of fruit, green apples, and a tart yeasty nose. As in the taste, fruity, green apple like, but not so sweet and a dry yeasty follow through. A sweet, fruity mouthfeel, with a dry yeasty aftertaste. I really like the fruity characteristics to this yeasty beer. One of the better Belgian styles from a micro brewery.","OWSLEY069","Aug 25, 2007"
