"O- Overall if I had regular access to this, this would be my go to saison. This beer kills it every time I've had it. I love the dryness and drinkability and the 500 ml format is perfect."
"3.42/5: It smelled like it would be as good as Dupont...too bad it isn't"

""

"A bit of a gusher, but otherwise very tasty."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a light golden color with a white head.  Aroma of farmhouse, damp straw and lemon.  The taste is wheat focused, lightly tart, some lemon.  Bitter hops and earthy yeast flavor cut tartness.  As a multi yeast beer it gets a little too complex to the point where the flavors aren't agreeable. Good beer, and quality example of the style, but falls short of the truly great."
"O - A very nice saison. Color and aroma very nice with a classic farmhouse/belgian/saison taste. Funky spices without overpowering."
""

"Everything i love about a farmhouse saison here. delicate spices, light pear like fruit flavors, nice carbonation. the brett is what makes this one instantly a favorite. great brett in the smell and taste, not overpowering but enough to give it that that funky, musty flavor. loved this beer.."
""
""
"Delicious and tasty . . . same thing I know. Sitting on a couple Prairie offerings at the moment and this being the first I've tried. Makes me all the more anxious to try more. Solid presentation of the style. Slightly funky and easy drinking."

"Not your grandpas saison!  Big beer."
""
"Pours a cloudy golden yellow color with a huge four finger foamy white head.  There is a lot of carbonation and the lacing is thick.  The odor is farmhouse like, funky, champagne like, citrus lemon, grapefruit, spices, earthy, herbal, some pineapple.  The taste is very refreshing, crisp, very spicy clove, lemon, herbal, dry finish, slight bitterness."

"Overall this is a bit of a disappointment for me but maybe I am unfairly comparing it to Bomb which I found fantastic.  I thought it would pack more of a punch.  The white grape smell and taste is fairly strong and makes it feel like I am drinking carbonated wine.  Its an interesting beer but not jumping out at me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Slightly funky, grassy, earthy, a touch of lemon pith. A bit wheaty."
""

"O.  A nice beer.  Haven't had a Belgian quite like it.  Would get again. Refreshing."

"Stuff I don't like in an objectively good beer:  Pilsner malt, wheat malt, Saaz hops, and Brett. Between spicy hops and saison-style yeast, I just kinda want it to calm down and smoothen out. It is, nevertheless, a classic saison!  Black pepper and whatever pineapple are undertones. I should read the description before I buy it, but I'm glad I to try it!  $10 for another bottle:  no way."
""
""
"full disclosure: it's a bit pricey at over 55 cents per ounce, but there's no denying it's a great brew and strong contender for an American standard in the style."
""
"Overall: Not my favorite Prairie beer but certainly not a bad beer either. Nice clean finish and very tasty. I would drink this more if I could get it, as a matter of fact I would drink any of this breweries offerings if i could get them. Top notch outfit one of the best in the country in my opinion!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a really nice saison from a brewery I'd never heard of until this afternoon. This might pair well with grilled meats or cheeses, but drinks just fine on its own too. The bottle I purchased was a bit smaller than the one in the photo (1 pint, 0.9 fluid ounces)."
""
""
""
""
""
"overly sweet- tasted like an allagash"
""
""
""
"Taste: Lightly sweet malt, coriander, white saltine crackers, brett yeast, peppercorns, and spice.  Pilsner crispness."
"I'm always psyched when I come across an excellent example of a style with which I am typically less than enamoured, and from an even less likely point of origin.  Ladies and germs, exhibit A, then, of a saison made right, in the American sub-genre - hoppy, boozy (apparently), and the genuine article otherwise.  Yum."
""
"Overall, a very nice Saison and interesting for a style that seems hard to perfect. The Brett adds a nice twist and really works well in this beer."
""
""
"Poured from a 16.9 oz bottle into a tulip. Look: cloudy yellowish gold. Huge white foam head. Good lacing on the glass as I drank. Smell: citrus, hops. A little Belgian yeast smell. Taste: citrus fruits, moderate hop bitterness. A little bit of toasted bread. Not as complex as I was hoping for a saison. Slightly bitter finish. Feel: light, lots of carbonation. Overall: Not overly impressed but still a decent beer. This was my first Prairie Ale to try. I'd be willing to try others but this probably wouldn't be my go-to saison."

""

""

"Has a big lemony tart nose with a dab of barnyard funk and a hint of tropical fruit. Pours hazy straw under a very lightly gold tinted white 3” foam cap. Has a very lemony palate over light grains that suggest a very light short bread, light tropical fruit, white pepper with a light spicy touch on the finish. A light and refreshing beer."

"Very cloudy pale yellow in color. Forms a large fluffy white head. Looks like lemon meringue pie in a glass. Good retention. Moderate lacing. Powerful aroma full of tart lemony citrus, pineapple, and lemon curd. Taste is similar. Strong lemony component, though the sweetness is toned down while the peppery spice is kicked up. The brett comes off fairly aggressively. Body is on the lighter side of medium with a strong, almost acidic, tartness which I find to be far too aggressive for the style. Still, a very good example of a brett-forward beer."

"500 ml bottle. Served in a Unibroue tulip, the beer pours a hazy straw gold color with an inch and a half white head. Both the head retention and lacing are good. The brew smells like yeast, hay, citrus (mostly lemon), pear, bready malt, and peppery spice. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of some bubblegum, minerals, white grapes, and some brett. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's smooth and it's well carbonated. It's a good, lightly tart saison. Certainly worth trying if you've never had it before, it's a good brew."

"The beer is extremely hazy and straw yellow with a soapy white head. The aroma offers lemons, hay, grass, floral hops, citrus. Lots of citrus in the flavor. Delicious. Mild funk with orange rind, floral hops, and a slight herbal note. Medium bodied, complex; and easy drinking. Really tasty."

"MF – Super dry finish, tart – maybe even a bit astringent, medium-light body. 5"

"Another delicious saison. Try it."
""
""
"Overall, this ain't too shabby. But for the price I paid (nearly $10), it's not worth buying again."
""
""
"O: This was a nicely executed saison. Maybe there's not much to make it stand out from its peers, but it does very little wrong. This particular bottle was a touch over-carbonated."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I'm going back and forth on this one. While it delivers what it promises (farmyard) the extreme carbonation and moderate bitterness are a bit off putting and as it warms the alcohol, rather than fruit or spice, is the most increasingly noticeable attribute."
""
""
""
"This is a medium to light bodied brew with an effervescent amount of high carbonation. This brew starts out awesome and gets a little peculiar as the experience continues. It almost gets to the point where it is too warming and focuses on alcohol for only being listed as ~8%. Regardless, id buy this again if the price was a little more reasonable."
"Good beer, but palate is ultimately too sweet and watery. It's like a spritzer and I find myself wanting more. Just a bit cloying."

"O: Typical saison. The combination of yeasts really fell short for me. I was hoping to have a brett bomb but instead found a good example of the saison style. This was very refreshing and drinkable but wasn't exactly for me. I wouldn't seek this one out and may not drink it again. I've had many great drinks from Prairie and would rather enjoy one of those again than this."
""
""
""
""

"Very very drinkable. Complex and refreshing."

"Poured into a Gavroche tulip. If you've ever seen ""There Will Be Blood", you can picture me opening this bottle: Gusher! After quickly getting a glass under the flow, managed a pour, appearing in the glass as opaque hazy straw, almost the color of fresh unfiltered pineapple juice with a massive white head that started to dissipate, but maintained a two finger head with good retention and pillowy lacing. Classic saison aroma of light fruit juice, coriander, wild yeast, peppery and sweet/sour. Flavor is dry dominant brett, light citrus and apple family fruit, hints of caramel, white grape, hints of lemon citrus; finishes very bitter from hops and Brett. Dry, bubbly and reminiscent of champagne (if champagne was brett infused). Fortunately not too sour, but a light tartness that was appealing. Light to medium bodied with bright, active carbonation. Brett forward and far over the amount I would prefer; however it is a credit to this ale that the overall peppery carbonation and otherwise well balanced saison flavors won me over. I like the underlying saison ingredients and if I was a bigger wild yeast fan, I'd probably go crazy over this. A very nicely made and tasty saison on the aggressive brett end of the flavor spectrum. This is one of the rare ales that could eventually win me over to wild yeasts. So good I regretted losing a third of the bottle on opening."
"O- A good Saison, but would be better if the brett made it more sour. The nose is the best part, smells like a wine barrel aged Saison."

"o: really impressed with this. as mentioned, it reminds me a bit of Fantome. its fruity, spicy, earthy, and super refreshing. not taste of alcohol in here at all. 100% recommend this"
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the things that I found strange was that at some point the beer smelled like urine. Strange and off putting."
""
"Slightly bitter up front, then a nice breadyness leads way to brettanomyces' funkyness. A bit of white pepper comes through in the finish.. This I a very yeast oriented brew. You can tell there was Belgian yeast used for primary, Brett in secondary (there but not as overpowering as most 100% Brett ales) and the wine yeast comes through in the crisp dry finish. A wonderfully balanced wild ale, full of flavor with a light crisp refreshing body.. Oh and wait there's lots of alcohol in this one? Feels like a 3% Berliner.. Wow. Excellent job done by prairie once again."
""
"O: The more I continue to drink this the more I don't like it, but it looks and smells good."
""
"Funky, grapy nose. Nice, mellow straw color in the glass that just looks like summer. The brett comes through heavily on this one followed by lemon, rind, white grapes, and a bit of a hop bite on the backend. This is a pretty dry affair -- just a touch of sweetness. Overall, another good prairie beer."
""
""
""
"O: Had this beer once before on-tap, but I think it was either a bad keg, or the conditioning didn't take. Out of the bottle though, this beer is completely different. The carbonation and brett are immediately noticeable and true to style. Even though there's hops in this they're almost unnoticeable, and the malt is very subdued. The wine yeast is probably the most noticeable in the taste and aroma categories, and makes this one of my favorite Saisons."

"Wispy bleached white head of extremely airy foam, amazing for how swiftly it evaporates down to the surface, looks like a video game, no lacing at all. Light, shiny golden straw color, easy to see through, full throughout with huge bubbles which steadily move with authority, a proverbial maelstrom in the glass. The nose suavely unfolds pressed flowers, clove spice, sour orange to grapefruit citrus, has a vinous quality to it, it’s too wiry and focused for the banana to bubblegum aspect to shine, same for any sweeter element, be it the apple, pear or the meadow breeze, the yeastiness is like just about to baked bread, not like dessert “baked goods.” Full-bodied, has a heavier which impairs it getting out of the gate, carbonation injects some fuel into this. White grape, pear, apple, apricot fruit lean and mean, bursts through and picks up speed from the pepper, clove, and metallic earth components. Noticeable for its freshness and cleanliness, once it breaks past the mid-palate it develops a lighter feel which makes it food friendly. Minimal banana and ester presence. Very interesting, obvious it belongs in this category but it doesn’t play to the crowd, quietly classy and willing to accept your lack of appreciation."
""

"O: refreshing, tame and highly drinkable for style. "
"O. After the pour and the nose I was really invested, but the taste and mouthfeel let me down. I feel this one is out of balance, with a finish that is overly dry and phenolic. It is similar to a Belgian Pale but there's just no balance, which makes this a one-note experience, and not altogether a pleasant one the more and more I sip it. This is a decent enough offering, but a disappointment after all the good things I've heard about Prairie."
""
""
""
""
"I drank this some time ago, but I remember the nose and how it tasted so vividly. It's one of the beers I use as a prime example in floral flavors in beer. So if you are looking for floral flavors in your beer: drink this beer. The way I always describe this light, summery ale is: it tastes the way tulips or amaryllis flowers smell. It has a florid and almost farty pungency. I am sending home to Oklahoma from NYC for this one and will continue to for as long as it's brewed."
""
""
"Overall another solid and great saison, and one for the brett heads for sure. Been very impressed with these guys."
""
"Mouthfeel is refreshing, full, but airy. Overall, I like this quite a bit."
""
"2nd pour yields a little foam but the stand out feature of this is the tart, yet quite thin and bland taste. but that isn't bad, it just means it's not overly rich and I really like it this this way. for the 8.2% abv, I really like this. it's a very clean taste and very nicely done. not overly rich, not terribly tasty, but very stable."
""
"O. It's a zesty, refreshing beer and well balanced; not overly wheaty."

"this is what i love about prairie, a simple, yet elegant and highly refined saison style with a unique flavor profile of its own while still falling squarely within the style guidelines. this is a blond beer, hazy and pale with some yeast sediment and a massive three inches of frothy white head that only slowly recedes. the smell is awesome, i definitely get the saaz hops, but this is all about the yeast. there is a zesty citrus profile not dissimilar to their birra, but less lemon. a spice aroma is there too, white pepper and plantain, interesting, the flavor is wheat malt on the front end, soft and fresh, and a grassy hop and yeast complexion as it finishes. really grassy and summery, almost bitter and vegetal as it swallows, remarkable. its a combination of hops and yeast doing that, but i get some brighter fruits too, maybe white peach or white grape. a very enjoyable and refreshing beer, that drinks much lighter than it is. the body is a bit full, but the carbonation makes it impressively sessionable. this is simple compared to their other beers, but it is nearly flawless, and reflects how awesome prairie is. less can be more when it tastes like this."

"Bottle from Tipples. Had this right after Eliza5beth. Pours clear golden with a big fluffy head. Aroma of Bretty yeast funk, pilsner malts, some tartness, lemon rinds, musty pepperyness. Flavor is Brett funk up front, a super interesting taste of a mouthful of flower petals and peat, Chardonnay, lots going on here and not like anything I have tried before. Serious funk here. Light bodied with high carbonation. Very interesting brew and I really can’t put my finger on the strange flavors in the mid palate of this one. Definitely worth trying."

"Big peppery saison here, with a thick wet Belgian bread to soak up any of the funky barn taste that tries poking through. Interesting how the pepper dominates such a syrupy, highly carbonated brew. I'm not picking up the pineapple as the description says is present. I wonder if this is because the bottle indicates an 8.2% beer, whereas previous bottles were apparently 7% (according to BA at least). I like it, and I normally like spicing like pepper but it seems way heavily present in the taste..yet the sugar balances it out somehow. Did i miss a different batch, one with more complexity... that being the lighter version? i dont know, but this Prairie Ale was still nice to try. In the end this was more like a hefty pilsner to me rather than a saison. Their phenomenal ""Hop"" version of this is what led me to pick this up. This is still worth a try."

"Pours a cloudy straw-into-amber with two fingers thick white foam cap... a few blobs of lace on the glass. Smell: semi sweet pils, doughy, dried pineapple, spice note, white grape juice, pepper. Taste: light breadiness, snappy grain, sugary white grape and honey, growing spicy hopping and black pepper. Spicy, sticky, mildly alcoholic finish. Very tasty."

"6 month old bottle served in the teku. Golden straw with big pillowy white headht sticks around for a while and leaves spotty lines. Subtle barnyard and sweetness in the smell. Initial taste dominated by a earthy Brett that leads into some sweet pineapple and a back end bite. Semi dry. Overall not my favorite prairie but still good"
""

""
""
""
""
"O: Oveall, the aroma wrote a check that the taste didn't cash. Good, but not great, counter to what I've come to expect from Prairie."
""
""
"Overall, my first beer from Prairie and I'm glad to have sampled it. I will definitely have to make a point to seek out their other beers when I can. Of course, I'm a bit of a sucker for brett beers, so long as they're well done. This one certainly was and I would gladly have it again--especially in a brett fix emergency."
""
""

"Bottle: Poured a clear bright golden color ale with a large foamy head with great carbonation and excellent retention with some good lacing. Aroma consists of rustic malt with some dry hoppy notes with great floral undertones. Taste is also dominated by great floral hoppy notes with great rustic malt presence and a light spicy yeast flavours. Body is full with great carbonation with no apparent alcohol. Wonderful saison with great hops profile which brings complexity while retaining some good drinkability."
"Beautiful straw colored body with a big foamy white head. A little hazy in the body, which is really what you're looking for with the style. There isn't a lot going on in the nose. You get some esters and flowery notes. I don't get this type of beer for the nose though. Very drinkable and satisfying saison. Almost like a table beer. I don't pick up the ABV at all. Drinks like 4%. Some light pepper notes and flowery notes like a typical farmhouse beer. Very solid beer that I'm sure pairs great with food."
""
""

"A very tasty and highly recommended Saison from the folks at Prairie."
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice enough, but leans quite heavily on some strong flavours which end up subjugating the overall drinkability."
""
""

"Flavor follows the nose pretty well. Dry saison notes with spicy hints and notes of earthy grain. Nice mild grainy sweetness with some fruit juice notes in there as well. The hop notes are very mild but compliment the brew really well. Pretty nice earthy grain flavors with a good dry finish."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours moderately hazy golden straw color with a 2-3 finger foamy and rocky white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big lemon, pineapple, peach, pear, apple, clove, pepper, hay, grass, white wine, wheat, light vinegar, funk, and yeast earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast notes with funk; and great strength. Taste of lemon, pineapple, peach, pear, apple, pepper, clove, hay, grass, white wine, wheat, light vinegar, funk, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of citrus, pineapple, light fruits, clove, pepper, hay, grass, wheat, white wine, funk ,and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Incredible balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, hop, and brett flavors; with a moderate malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a lightly creamy, crisp, and fairly prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an incredible saison style! All around fantastic balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, hop, and brett flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A near world class offering in my opinion."

"Apricots, toilet funk. Grassy spices that linger in the finish. A bit soft in acidity, would've liked more. Leaves kind of a bittersweet taste which I'm not a fan of. Nice medium-body mouthfeel with high carbonation. Overall, not bad, light and quaffable, but doesn't quite reach greatness because of a misbalance in bitter/sweet/sour axis and too much going on (i.e. not elegant). I remember enjoying the hoppy version of this beer more."

"I think this beer would really benefit from a few months of aging by getting some of the sweetness cleaned up and creating a drier finish. With that said, this is a damn fine saison right where it stands. The malt profile is no slouch but the yeast profile defines this beer and they did a great job of combining different products. If I had to guess the abv I would never even consider 7%. Drinks like 5%."

"EDIT: as it has warmed some more, the alcohol flavor I was getting has died down and the original flavor has been modified from 3.25 up to 3.75. I would probably drink again, but the price point still steers me toward something like Upright, Stillwater or the newly found Propolis for my money."

"Overall- very reminiscent of blvd- tank 7, great divide- collette. less alcohol then some but enough especially for a bomber. little more funk then some. very good, every day brew. with out a every day price. i can see where this brew can vary from bottle to bottle or at least batch to batch as the yeast seems to be let lose a little more. Great job Oklahoma."
""
"O- The fizz and bitterness component is a bit too big but this is one of the best Brett beers I have had from the states. The saison qualities are nice but outshined by its wild cousin. Very drinkable and sessionable with lots of great character."

"I have had numerous Prairie Artisan Saisons in the past. All are amazing. This however beats them all, and pretty much any other variants of the style. Even some from across the continent. The earthy Brett, saaz hops, and pilsner malt works together perfectly. One of my favorites, and am so glad this recently hit the Texas market. This will be a staple in my fridge."

"Tastes moderately bitter and earthy, tangy brett yeast that coats the palate and grabs hold. Dried citrus peel, grassy bitter hops, funky wet hay from the brett. Medium bodied, seemingly effervescent, though it loses steam eventually. A nice saison that showcases Brettanomyces well."

"An excellent example of a Saison from a brewer that is impressing me more and more. No American hop character here as in Prairie Hop, just a spot-on traditional interpretation of the style. Recommended."

"O - I have to say it again that these dudes in OK have a nice set of Saisons that the brew. Please distribute to WI as we are in need of Saison style beers! Thank you Ken for sending this and allowing me to enjoy it."

"D - Great complex and balanced saison. Nice finish."

"Overall. Fantastic stuff. Really well made beer here with a ton of flavour. Glad I have most of the lineup to try. Thanks again willandperry!"

"O: Bight, crisp, clean and very refreshing Saison. Has a nice sweetness to it, but finishes dry. Would definitely recommend on a warm summer day/night."
""
"O - Dry, tart and lots of Brett. Light and refreshing all-around."
"Overall, a really fantastic, bright and refreshing saison. The flavor profile has a nice combination of lemon, funk, brightness and dryness. Really nice on a warm day."
""
"O: In terms of balance, you can't really beat this saison. It's fruity yet spicy, funky yet clean. It's a great example of the style. However, it's not as complex as some of the best saisons on the market. I find myself wanting to like this beer more than I actually do. Ideally, I'd tone down the peppery notes and ramp up the body. A great example of the saison style, but not transcendent."

"Pours a murky orange with a foamy white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour and tart with floral, fruit, and Brett aromas. Taste is much the same with Brett and fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of Brett bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
"My second attempt at Prairie and this one is not amazing like my first, but this is still a nice Saison. I'd say it's a bit one dimensional and could use either more heavy-handed hopping, or perhaps a touch more sweetness to counteract the Bretty intensity. Or perhaps it just needs to be a bit more subtle overall. Worth a try, but I might explore other options in the future when considering a $13+ price tag."

"This is as solid as a Saison can come. Drinks like a Table Saison despite the elevated abv. Very rustic with a really nice Brett character."

"Overall quite an interesting beer, if there is not Brett in it they used a great farmhouse barnyard funky saison yeast and its quite tasty. I think I'll get another bottle or two to cellar. The overall profile was delicious, great barnyard funk with saison spices, little citrus, and some nice grainy hay like malts. Quite tasty, and I'm really liking this brewery, I wish we could get more of their beers here."
"The body is nice and light with good carbonation. Overall this one drinks nicely. Refreshing and enjoyable."
"Very tasty saison. I will probably get this again (for a special occasion)."
""
"Tasty beer, but on the sweeter side for a Saison. The brett is already quite present and I'd be curious to see how much more it developes. I could see this beer becoming quite the gusher over time."

"O: Interesting saison. It's not sour or funky but it's definitely got a little tart edge. Interestingly enough, no black pepper which I'm pretty sure this is one of only a few saisons I've had that didn't have that aspect. This one is focused more on the crisp, tart fruitiness than anything - making it quite refreshing and drinkable. I liked it a lot."
"Overall a good saison; nice flavors and complexity with a tartness that makes it lighter."

"A well-made example of the Belgian-inspired style. Great flavors to start. Be careful about pouring. From the 750 ml bottle bought at Bine and Vine in San Diego."

"Pours a cloudy banana yellow with a smallish white cap. The head is a bit small, but otherwise, it's a perfectly nice looking saison. The aroma is dried out fresh grain with fruity, barnyard-y saison yeast notes and a dash of funk. The fruitiness is a mix of light citrus and light stone fruits, lemons meet apricots. It has that dry yeasty smell of a well-fermented saison. Very farmhouse fresh. The brett still seems young, but it adds on a pleasant complexity. The taste starts surprisingly sweet and fruity before drying out and pushing into a lasting, almost acrid bitterness. The transition from fresh light grain and apricots to yeasty peppercorns and lemon peels is fast, nearly jarring, but it works for me. I particularly like that dry, bitter, spicy finish. The mouthfeel is light but full. Lots of flavor. No booze. Carbonation is somewhat high, though not abnormal for the style. This is a very well done beer. Great to see more quality saisons being produced by American brewers."

"Pours a cloudy golden color with a layer of white head that fades to a small ring around the pour. The smell is very crisp with some banana and an herbal note. Just a touch sweet with a hint of citrus. The flavor is also quite light with a lightly fruity note. This is a very herbal beer with a yeasty component. There is a hint of banana and citrus fruit. The carbonation level is very high and the finish is very dry."

"While I have loved everything Prairie Artisan Ales has been doing, I thought Prairie Ale was a little off. I did enjoy it, but the sweetness I got from it seemed to go against the hop and bite I had as well. Still a great beer, but I like the standard and Hop more!"
""
"O: A great saison from a great new brewery that is producing some fantastic stuff. I love that Oklahoma is growing in the craft beer realm. With this being the first beer brewed by Praire I am anxious to try the rest. Cheers!"

"O: I will revisit this when the yeast settles. The aroma on this was amazing, though, and the flavor is just OK."

"8.7/10"
"Overall: A really tasty and refreshing farmhouse saison. I love the estery profile, and the mouthfeel keeps me coming back for more. A solid brew."
""
""
"O- what a fantastic new beer from OK! The brewer knocked this out of parked and past the parking lot! Awesome farmhouse Brett beer!"
""
"This is an incredible saison that not only delivers on the promise of dry fruit, high spice, and ultimate dryness; but does so boldly and with the glaring envelops of earthen must in such a way that is rarely delivered outside of the farmhouses of Belgium."
"O-I really like this beer. Have had it a few times and each time the bret seems to have come forward more. Defiantly worth trading for and picking up(if its in your market)"
"Overall a nice saison, been a while since I had a good one, thanks will!"
""

"Maybe it's due to living in a wasteland for craft beers, or maybe I'm really lucky to have this in my state, but this is one of the best saisons I've had. The bottle itself is just fun to look at with the great hand drawn artwork, corked and caged. Poured into a Duvel tulip with a thick white head. Smells of citrus, mostly orange, and lemon to me with some pepper. The Brett funk comes through as well. Smells amazing. The taste is a light body with moderate carb. Spice, citrus, and the Brett, much like it smelled. This beer was a definite ""wow"" for me in local beers, I hope Chase has raised the bar for Oklahoma brewers. I'm holding back a few bottles to see how these mature, can't wait to pop one open in the hot Oklahoma summer!"
""
"O- flat out great Saison with Brett. I really wish I could get this on a weekly basis, it holds it's own with all of the Hill Farmstead saisons I've tried. I hope that production can keep up with what I assume will be an insane growing demand. I'd hate for the few bottles I have to be the last."
"A funk-forward saison - lacking subtlety, but damn good. If this is a clue to the direction that PAA is going, then the Oklahoma beer scene is about to go up a notch (or two)."
"This is a great saison from an up and coming brewery. I look forward to more from Prairie."
"In the end I would say this is a fairly light, standard American version of a belgium style saison. Its interesting to try once, especially since its a fairly new brewery and will hopefully add to the breweries in Oklahoma, which I find lacking. Its a good starter saison, but not impressive for the experienced saison taster."
""
"Overall this is a great beer and a wonderful interpretation of a saison. Chase really makes some great saisons and I look forward to trying some more of his new brews from his new venture out of Krebs, OK."
""
"The 8.2% alcohol is obvious. Mouth-feel is medium and dry. Also a bit crackery with soft edges."
"Mango, pineapple, hay, orange and some slight hints of earth and tangerines. Pour is slightly cloudy straw color with a good head that reduces and maintains great retention and consistency. Now a narrow strip in the glass the bubbles are creamy and tightly packed and cling nicely to the glass. Citrus fruit is the first flavor to come through, mango, pineapple and orange with small amount of lemon peeking through. Moderate carbonation is apparent throughout the taste. Coarse bubbles hold all the way through to the finish. Prickly sensations as you swallow. The Brett character is extremely mild at this point, but is noticeable and should mature as time goes on. The finish is slightly sweet with a dry *ting* right at the end and very well done. The alcohol is well hidden and doesnt have an impact on the flavor or finish. This is one extremely well brewed Saison! I love the way the fruit flavors are not overpowering, but help to balance the slightly dry low Brett character. Hopefully the balance will maintain as the yeast develops in the bottle. If this is an example of what Chase and Colin Healey have in store for us, then WATCH OUT, because the ride has only begun!"
