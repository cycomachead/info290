Typical peppery spice, lemony, yeasty smells for a saison with an underlying incredibly hoppy bouquet. A lot of tropical fruit all around coming out more in the taste, specifically after you swallow.  Mango and citrus, slight banana yeastiness, great carbonation, absolutely refreshing!  My personal favorite of the style, permanently secured because of its generous use of hops.","Czarkazm","Mar 07, 2015"

The aroma is of lots of Belgium yeast, floral with some citrus zest. More going on with the taste as the sweet floral hops is right up front with some grass and lemon zest for the finish. Actually goes down easy with no bitter or harsh aftertaste at all. Medium-bodied with good carbonation.

I know that it will be great every time, yet it still surprises me each time I reach for it.  This is one of the timeless classics of the American Craft Beer movement.

Two fingers of glorious white head that hung around for quite a while. This has a big, bready nose with a nice spicy note (coriander I would imagine). The yeast is also very present and accounted for. As the glass warmed a bit, some nice mango notes began to break out. The flavor was awesome. Big, strong bready backbone was supporting a tropical fruit medley... spicy notes from the yeast and just an overall clean presentation. The mouthfeel was smooth, definitely coated the palate and lingered a moment with a funky little punch that let you know you were drinking it. Nothing else to say, except that this came together into a fantastic beer. Get it.","Mikus","Feb 01, 2015"

Hazy golden yellow color, took about 10 minutes to pour a 12 oz bottle because of the great head of white fluffy billowing foam. Great retention and lacing. Aroma was a bit funky, piney and fruity. The taste had some lemony, peppery and spice notes, with just a tinge of malty sweetness. The mouthfeel was fairly light, somewhat dry, with crisp carbonation.

Taste is hay like with spice upfront and malt with hop balance and mild spice in the middle and finish with herb and earth notes throughout.  Mouthfeel is medium with a good carbonation to cut.

The overriding impression here is of a sort of hybrid saison, one that has certain IPA-like qualities: floral, tropical, and citrus notes, and a consistent spiciness. It's like the flip of a Belgian IPA -- rather than an IPA that has a Belgian quality to it, it's a Belgian-type farmhouse/saison with an IPA quality. A unique beer.

Massive Brussels lace on the sides of the glass, that stays a long time.  Golden hued and slightly cloudy.  Fruity aroma of apple, biscuit, yeast, apricot.  Floral hops notes.  Nice sweetness up front that stays around with the finish that also has a little bitterness from the hops and a little acidity.  Moderate carbonation - almost fizzy but just short of it.  Light body, on the dry side.  Long finish.  Wow - it's like I'm in Belgium!","PacNWDad","Nov 02, 2014"

I re-checked the bottle after I poured because I could smell the alcohol right off the bat. Yeah, 8.5 is right. It's giving me a touch of heart burn. The flavor is there but the alcohol takes it over pretty forcefully, destroying any yeasty goodness it may have yielded. I'll probably not have this again.","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Oct 30, 2014"

Smell: soapy, dried pineapple, floral, spices -not for cooking or baking but some bs bathroom smelly crap. This beer smells like your grandmother's bathroom. If you were eating dried pineapple in it, instead of whatever you're really doing. Taste: mirrors the nose...just a ton of spices that don't mesh, dried sweetened pineapple, pils/pale overly sweet. Sticky candy finish after the spices fade. Fruity without definition, overly sweet, overly spiced. Phenolic like a bpa. Ratings don't compute because this is not a good saison.","babaracas","Oct 11, 2014"

For fans of the style, it's definitely worth having. For others, it may feel forgettable as it fades away nto the fruit and spice conglomeration of the other saisons they've had before.","BethanyB","Oct 07, 2014"

No matter - this was great stuff and a treat for those of us here on the East Coast who are new to Boulevard. Good enough to be confused with an import and simple enough for anyone to enjoy, this is what a good Saison should be about. The aroma wasn't anything memorable but everything else was and I'll probably give this a go again sometime soon in the near future.","JerzDevl2000","Oct 01, 2014"

4.75,13.6,,,,,,"I haven't had this for a while because I usually don't buy large-format or 4-packs that exceed $10, but hey, 4-packs on sale today! The first time I had this my wife and I were in the mountains for a wedding during the summer, the whole town shut down at 8pm, and all we had was a frozen pizza and a 750 of Tank 7...and it was an excellent dinner. I'm no less impressed by Boulevard's legendary farmhouse tonight. Lovely soft haze, pineapple-meat yellow, and an airy head make this ale look as appetizing as it tastes. The nose is really so complex it's hard for me to sort out, but I get a lot of tropical mango-fruit and floral notes, and the spiciness just gives it that extra edge over a lot of others. Assertive for sure. Mouthfeel is smooth and velvety, nice carbonation, and bordering on thick. Alcohol is apparent in flavor, numbs the tongue and takes your breath away a little at first, wouldn't call this beer ""hot"" though. Tropical and light citrus fruits (notably lemon) play against a spicy backdrop. Really nice beer. And three left!","BeerWizard","Aug 22, 2014"

Pours hazy yellow with a massive fluffy whir head. Aroma of hay, yeasties, barnyard, very straight forward. Flavor is very nice and refreshing. Yeast, hay, dusty barnyard but balanced out by a bit of honey, fruit esters, pears, apples, and a bit of light spice. Light bodied and high carbonation. A really awesome beer here.

4.37,4.5,4,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.5,"This saison swings more toward the French style. Greater clarity than the Belgian type. Good bitterness, perhaps about 50 to 60 IBUs, with a mild Goldings nose and some more citrusy type of hop, like Columbus. Good hop complement to the more orange citrus profile of what I'm guessing is a French saison yeast, like Wyeast 3711. Sweet start and sweet finish, no tartness or barnyard funk, saved from stickiness by the high bitterness levels. Also, a bit of alcohol on the finish. Thick, long-lasting head. Generally refreshing as a strong French saison should be.","Natureboy","Jul 22, 2014"

I bought this beer for 11.99 for a 4 PACK. Yes a 4 pack. So I was thinking what anyone would think... This must be GREAT BEER!!! That assumption was wrong. TBH I flat out didn't like this beer, which almost NEVER happens...First of all its way overpriced, it doesn't go down smooth, it doesn't taste good, it doesn't smell good, and it barely even tastes like beer!.. I think the brewers were already drunk when they made this brew because its nothing like the other boulevard brews which are Great! It reminded me of beer made out of hay or straw that someone spiked with some vodka... literally. The only reason I think it says farmhouse ale is because it tastes like a cow brewed it. As a die-hard boulevard fan I am somewhat upset with this brew, especially at 11.99 a 4 PACK kind of feeling ripped off.. I'm surprised boulevard even releases this, and even more surprised with it's high ratings here?? Maybe this beer just wasn't for me but I couldn't find one quality about the beer I liked except for the label!.. If you like to spike your beers with hay and vodka this beers for you!!!","Warmonster","Feb 08, 2014"

The color is amber-orange and somewhat cloudy. It has a dry, yeasty smell, and sort of ends there: there's almost no other scent of note past that, IMO. Initially, I thought I was tasting an alcohol-soaked clementine poked with coriander or peppercorns, but a few sips in realized--as described by others--it was more grapefruit overall. It feels snappy and a bit metallic, with a balanced carbonation and some gentle spice in the mix. Overall, I'd say it's definitely a precise and almost medicinal beer, perfectly suited to a warm early autumn day after you've toiled at whatever one ought to do to deserve this refined beverage.","TheVag","Jan 04, 2014"

Bottle opened with a big pop at a good temperature and poured with a huge, foamy, frothy, fluffy, cream-colored head that lasts a very long time and some lace. Color is very slightly hazy yellow amber with some bubble trails. Aroma is dominated by lovely fresh hop, citrus, a bit of resin. Flavor's much like nose with again hop in front backed with some malt sweet and some bitter. Traditional saison characteristics have been supplanted by the hop domination. Body/carbonation are excellent. Finish is like flavor, hop strength carries thru for a very long time and only a little alcohol warmth. Great drinking beer.

The grapefruit comes through but it's not too overpowering. It's just enough to cover up the boozy taste but not too much that it blows your taste buds off. Very drinkable. Sweet and tart at the same time. Great balance. I'm a big fan of this beer at sip number two. I can't wait to finish it.","Ryan_Graham","Oct 24, 2013"

I don't know if Boulevard uses American hops, but the flavors are a meld of our hop profiles and the Belgian yeast styles. A good combination. One of the better versions of this style done in the US.","hokieguy95","Oct 23, 2013"

The color of this brew is somewhere between golden and copper, with quite a bit of sediment throughout the liquid; again, probably because of an overly aggressive pour. The scent of this beer comes through strong in the humulus arena, but yeast also plays a starring role. The flavor is also lots and lots of citrusy hops along with strong notes of bubblegum that comes straight out of the Belgian IPA handbook. This beer is not playing around, strong flavors all around don't necessarily make a beer great, but these flavors are fantastic. I cannot wait to pop open my bottle of Saison-Brett, but I may be able to hold of for a few months to let it develop that funk I think I would really love in this brew.","LiquidCucumber","Aug 02, 2013"

The beer is smooth and has a rather filling body due to the yeast, and I get a good amount of plush tropical fruit tastes and some citric hops. I'm also getting touches of breadlike and sweet malt so there is some balance in this beer between fruit, sweet and dryness, as I find the finish to be dry and also a little heat thanks to the alcohol that complements finish. An easy to drink flavorful saison that hits all the notes.","clayrock81","Jul 14, 2013"

What I really like is that this is sold in a 4 pack and the pricing is reasonable. Saisons are wonderful to have around in the summer months and it just seems impractical to stock a bunch of bombers so I applaud Boulevard for the 4 pack format. I'll probably continue to try a few others like Brooklyn's before seeking this out again but will say I'm happy to have 3 more in the fridge and could see myself coming back for more at some point.","b3barron","Jun 29, 2013"

It is fairly well balanced, but why go overboard with the alcohol? Somebody explain... does it make it more ""complex""? Somehow Belgian saisons and lambics accomplish tremendous complexity while still being light and refreshing. I appreciate subtlety, and I wish American brewers would start using more of it.","jibbyvonjibb","Mar 23, 2013"

Hazy golden colored liquid, the lightness of the particulate hides it well, filled with active streams of bubbles. The nose is gently forceful, nutmeg, clove, caraway seed and lemon peel, taut yeastiness, softer pinch of bubblegum, as the spice normalizes you perceive more apricot, peach, yellow apple fruit, the banana stays further in the background, longlasting presence but even better stays fresh. Medium-bodied, tighter and more focused than expected from looking at all those bubbles, the carbonation is active but not frothy. Mixes in some sour white grapefruit and orange to the lemon base, refreshingly citrusy. The yeasts again are not doughy nor too soft and it is not on the funky side of the spectrum. Clove, nutmeg but also basil and oregano, not herbaceous as in grassy but herbal as in garden herbs. Blends in pineapple and mango with the peach, apricot, pear base. As it warms takes on a more honeyed dimension. Dryness ensures erect bearing through the finish. Very thoughtfully put together while not over-intellectualized.","farrago","Mar 22, 2013"

Also, I personally like my Saisons to be a bit sweeter and have a bit more of a yeast flavor than this one possesses. If I were to improve on this beer, I'd add some more honey to give it a slightly sweeter flavor and also keep more yeast in suspension to give it a bit more body. Overall though, I'm impressed. Not my favorite commercial Saison (that belongs to Funkwerks) but I'd say it's in my Top 5.","MighHighBrewer","Mar 10, 2013"

Smells grass, belgian yeast, little funk, a tiny bit of lemon or lime, pepper. Taste starts with bright flavors of lemon and grass. Then is followed in the middle by the belgian yeast, some peppery spice, slight breadiness. Then the finish is more of the belgian yeast, some light funkiness, some light citrus notes like lemon and grapefruit, more spiciness, some slight floral notes, sweet breadiness from the malt.

I'm still completely sold by the relatively high alcohol content as I just don't think that is true to style (can't serve 8% beer as a ""refreshment"" to field workers, they'd pass out in the fields after lunch!), but the flavor cannot be denied. And Boulevard has at least resisted over-hopping like so many US brewers want to do with this style. This is legitimate stuff. From the funky/horsey aroma when you open it to the slightly peppery finish, it's all there. Very few brewers in the US ""get it"" as far as Farmhouse ales go. These guys are on the list. Well done.

3.89,-6.9,4.75,4.5,3.5,3.75,3.75,"The beer pours a pretty golden straw yellow with a huge fluffy white head that lasts forever, and medium thick poofy lacing that leaves rings on the glass. The body is clear but for a slight haze, and carbonation bubbles can be seen steadily working their way up the glass, though there also seems to be some very small particles floating in the beer. This is a pretty beer. On the nose, the beer smells wonderfully citrusy, with proper bread accentuations. Peppery lemon comes to mind when trying to describe it. The smell is classic saison citrus-spice with wonderful bready notes and the slightest touches of hay and farmyard funk and even light banana esters. On the tongue, the beer tastes much more herbal and grassy than the nose. The beer begins more in tune with the nose, featuring citrus lemon bread that washes strongly over the tongue, crescendoing and ebbing backwards as a solid grassy bitter follows it, bringing herbal tingling to the mouth and washing away all but a lingering aftertaste that is reminiscent of banana esters. Green pepper tastes can also be found in the middle of the taste alongside stronger banana notes. On the mouth, the beer feels a touch off, sitting just below medium bodied, which makes it highly drinkable, but not quite thin enough to knock back and not quite thick enough to sip. It feels clean and creamy as it goes down, and leaves the mouth slightly wet with a light herbal dryness on the tip of the tongue. Overall, I’m a little disappointed in Tank 7, I’ve heard great things and I love Boulevard’s Saison-Brett, but this beer doesn’t quite marry its separate flavors in an appealing way for me. This is not a bad beer by any means, but I think I built it up a little bit too much in my head. Worth a try for the Belgian lover, but not a knock out in my book.","Maxwell","Jan 16, 2013"

The beer looked very hazy in the glass, with a three finger thick head, and a golden body. The smell deviated from the Saison mold quite a bit due to the use of grapefruit like American hops. There was some bubblegum in the nose, which I suspect was the yeast. The taste was expertly balanced between bold and delicate flavors,. There was a noticeable use of citric hops, and a peppery spiciness. But there was also a floral character, and some orange peel, and banana notes. The mouthfeel was airy, and light, with a creamy carbonation. This was one of the best American interpretation of a Saison,, I've had in a while.","rajendra82","Dec 09, 2012"

Quite a bit hoppier in the mouth...bright, spicy, juicy citrus working very well with the yeast. Dry, fruity esters, subtle pale malt sweetness, and some grassy/flowery hops to back the citrus.

I wouldn’t say it merits a 4.5 overall, but it’s better than just 4.0—it’s balanced and quaffable, especially for something that sits at 8% ABV. No sense of the beer’s strength whatsoever, to be honest. Some saisons are aggressively spicy and carbonated, prickling all over your tongue and extremely peppery. Others are lighter and softer, and this is an example of a saison that comes off as moderately fruity and wheat-forward, with a light tartness that matches the easy mouthfeel and modest fruitiness.","fmccormi","Oct 24, 2012"

3.75,-10.3,4,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,"Pours a murky golden color with an admirable, rocky white head that devolves into sporadic chunks of lacing as the beer recedes. Aroma smells richly of pepper, hops, yeast, and some light fruit. This combination actually works much more pleasantly together than one might expect. The pepper that was so prominent in the nose is even more so in the taste--almost distractingly so. There are some spices I can tolerate in abundance, but pepper is not one of them. The bottle touts tropical fruit as a main component of the flavor profile, and much to my surprise, there is an evident mango aspect to the taste. The mango is more noticeable initially, before it starts to get drowned out by the pepper and bitterness, but it's definitely there. There's also some of the funkiness typical of the style, and the 8% ABV is well concealed. The carbonation is nice and crisp, just how I like it, but that's not enough to redeem this beer overall. There's just too much pepper going on to give the rest of the elements a fair shake, though I do respect Boulevard for going big on flavor here, even if it's not quite too my liking.","MaximalC","Aug 24, 2012"

Creamy, soft texture over a medium body. Other than swinging a hair too far into sweetness for my preferences, it's hard to find something to criticize in this brew!","WastingFreetime","Jul 26, 2012"

The nose is beautiful on this beer. It is dominated by a spicy, zesty character of coriander, lemon zest, pepper, and as the beer warms, some hop character as well. Very quiet bready malt in the back. The taste and mouthfeel is very full of carbonation; it almost takes away from the beer, but not quite. It's quite dry up front. Lots of sweet lemons, spicy burn on the tongue with the very minimal touch of burn from the alcohol. Overall a very tasty beer. I'm glad I got the 4 pack.","estlinska","Jun 29, 2012"

This beer is appears as a saison should. Aroma is primarily of sweet saison funk, but I also detect citric hops. The taste starts with a slight sweetness and a touch of floral hops. As the beer crests the tongue I get a bit more citric hops and a bit of spiciness. The finish includes a touch of bitterness and funk. A decent funk flavor carries the beer across the tongue. Body is of medium thickness. Carbonation is not as aggressive as something like saison DuPont, but is is there in enough quantity to make this very drinkable. The 8% ABV surprised me. Overall this is a very good saison/farmhouse ale. I quite like the flavor profile, but as a saison enthusiast, I don't think this would make my top 3.","gkunkle","Jun 04, 2012"

Lemon and grapefruit with some banana to balance it out. Slight bready malt flavor with a bit of classic barnyard taste. Very light hoppiness and just a tad bit of alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and highly carbonated. Crisp, dry finish. Drinkability is very high.

Taste of big grass, pepper, lemon, clove, coriander, biscuit, herbal spiciness, pear, orange, lightly tart grain, and yeast spices. Good amount of spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, grass, pepper, clove, and herbal spices on the finish for a bit. Fairly dry on the finish.

Becomes dry and spicy, Belgian spices and pepper and finishes with dry and with a hint of Brett funk. Light to medium mouth feel with pleasant carbonation. The funk is perfect for me at this level, adds interest without overwhelming the palate. I'm not a big fan of brett, but like the other flavors of saisons.

4.09,-2.2,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Taste has a fruity citrus presence, active carbonation that is slightly high but just short of being off-putting, sweet malt rounds out the aftertaste before it finishes once again with a citrus punch, slight dry finish.","deltatauhobbit","Jan 09, 2012"

4.12,-1.4,4,4.5,4,4,4," Palate is lightly sweet pale malt up front, with light citrusy hops providing balance and a little bitterness before the swallow. Notes of coriander, lemon peel, and a touch of pepper on the finish. A lingering bitterness on the finish shows off the substantial hopping. Body is creamy and lively, and still heavy enough to support the substantial alcohol content. This beer is an impressive example of the saison style, one of the better American versions I've had.","ElGordo","Jan 03, 2012"

3.65,-12.7,3.5,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Poured on-tap and served in a tulip stem, the beer is a light, bright, slightly hazy, pale yellow coloring, with a steady flow of carbonation bubbling and a dense, small bubbled, frothy white head. Aromas of sweet fruit and a spicy blend, with some clove and allspice in abundance. Bready yeast scents, also. The flavors have a strong roasting to them, with the clove and slightly sour yeast flavors following quickly on the tongue. Sweet berry fruits, and a slight highlight of honey balance the flavors. The aftertaste has a split second of sour, but a good showing of the spice blend. The finish is slow and slick, with a slight linger to it. Very good flavors, and one of the more sessionable Farmhouse brews I've had, despite the higher ABV.","GarthDanielson","Dec 30, 2011"

3.95,-5.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Overall, while the fruity, spicy, peppery, and citrus flavors in this beer are well-developed and finely nuanced, I found the beer slightly out of balance, needing a greater sense of earthiness from the malts to help ground the effect. A larger marble rye bread taste, perhaps, or toast crust would have sufficed. Without this, the sugars and citrus fruits overwhelm the profile, and the beer feels somewhat mimosa-like: alcoholic fruit juice mixed with champagne. The result is still very drinkable, but quite sugary, and wants for a bit of bread and cheese to help offset the beer.","jondeelee","Dec 09, 2011"

However, it makes it a beer I like to savor. I barely notice the alcohol under all the flavor. Perhaps slightly hoppier than most, but this one jumps to near the head of the saison pack. I will get this again.","tigg924","Nov 10, 2011"

Not as complex as I expect or want a saison to be, mostly just sweet, but still pleasant. Carbonation is pleasant and just right. I wouldn't reach for ths beer as a preferred saison but if I was at a bar that was serving it and nothing else caught my eye I wouldn't be unhappy with it.","aknight","Nov 08, 2011"

3.92,-6.2,4,4.5,3.5,4,4,"A beer that promises much (it has a great label) and delivers mostly. Cloudy in the glass; zesty and bovine in the nose; a yeasty and dense body with some lightly-malted tones in the taste. It's a tad hoppy for my liking, but not overly so and doesn't lose points for being so bright. The funk level is somewhat high, in my view. Boulevard seems to take the ""farm"" part of ""farmhouse"" somewhat literally. Otherwise... well worth a bottle or two.","gfreed","Oct 28, 2011"

Served in a goblet (as recommended by Boulevard), the beer pours a hazy gold color with an inch white head. The head stays around a long time, and there's a good amount of lacing. Aroma is nice and fruity, it smells like mango, lemon peel, pears, bananas, yeast and sweet malt. The taste is mostly fruity too, the brew tastes like pears, bananas, peppery spice, yeast, citrus (lemon, orange) rinds, bready malt and also an earthy flavor. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's well carbonated and quite refreshing to drink. At $9.99 a bottle, I'd buy this again. Definitely worth trying.","bluejacket74","Oct 21, 2011"
4.03,-3.6,4.5,4,4,4,4,"O: Hops take a backseat to the Saison here but they still really compliment the entire package.

4.15,-0.7,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a very pale yellow color with a frothy white head. The smell is kind of funky but very aromatic and floral with grass and hints of oranges a fresh pineapple. Tastes strongly of grass and lemony hops, it's a little funky, there is a nice firm bitterness and flavors of coriander and citrus peel. The beer is light and full of carbonation, the finish is very dry. This is a good beer although stronger and more bitter than most farmhouse ales if had before.","JMad","Oct 16, 2011"

Good amount of lacing. Smell reminded me of a wet field - fresh earth and wet grass. Taste was malty and sweet, with just enough hops on the tip of my tongue to keep the taste buds awake. Mouthfeel was very dry and crisp, and I am a bit surprised to see now that this beer is an 8% ABV brew. Very well hidden. This is a super refreshing beer and it was quite enjoyable on a sunny patio on a warm weekend day.","morebeergood","Oct 10, 2011"

Smell is delightfully complex with citrus, pineapple, grapefruit, and some caramel. Taste has the same but is much more subdued than the smell. Fairly high alcohol at 8% but you don't feel it. Quite a nice beer, and hurray for the persnickity Tank 7 at their brewery.","MoreThanWine","Oct 02, 2011"
4.23,1.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"O: This is just quite simply a very good saison. I think that the flavors really pop off that yeast character, and the mouth helps give the beer pastry flavor experience. This is like a nutri-grain bar, but alcoholic and much more fulfilling. I'm a big fan of this beer, but I think it's much better fresher. I feel like the contrast is muddy due to it being a bit older than I've had it before, and the hops don't pop as much. If you want the full experience seek one fresh. Though the flavor still comes through as a consistent performer. Cheers to boulevard for this exemplar beer.","Cavery","Sep 30, 2011"
4.1,-1.9,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"O: Not a bad saison but not the best I've had. Seems like it's a little too strong for my preferences (I think I like more 5-7%ish). I think I enjoyed the smell more than the taste by a good margin though.","Dope","Sep 28, 2011"

This is still a nice beer, but if I am going to spend $8.50 for a 750ml of Saison, I will buy the local Mystic over this until I croak.

The taste is similar, but lacks some of the zing of the herbs and lemon in the aroma. Crisp, as a Saison should be, but a touch soft on the finish. A solid, if not spectacular Saison.

4.18,0,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a vibrant, straw-colored body with a large, fluffy white head. It lingers, and leaves patches, rather outcroppings, of bubbles behind as lacing. Smells a bit funky, with straw, hay, faint citrus, and clove rounding it out. The taste is almost identical to the nose, but with the addition of a faint pear finish to it. Mouth is crisp, clean, and refreshing; very well done here. Overall, a great farmhouse ale that I’ll happily revisit.","eclipse54","Aug 25, 2011"
4.15,-0.7,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"O- The great aroma and thick head are very impressive but the taste is a bit too bitter in the finish detracting from the other great flavors. The fruity esters are large and try to balance but are a bit outshined by the bitterness.","rhoadsrage","Aug 23, 2011"

Taste follows the nose nicely, lots of spicy white pepper/coriander and sweet bubblegum yeast. Very crisp mouthfeel, with a medium body, sharp carbonation, and a dry finish. Overall a really nice Saison, I'm surprised by how well the alcohol is hidden.","jsanford","Aug 22, 2011"
3.83,-8.4,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours a nice golden straw color typical to it's type. Also true to it's type, it wreaks of Begian yeast. However, it does also have a smoky scent to it as well, and that's refreshingly unique. Where this varies from most Farmhouse Ales/Saisons, is that the taste isn't pure heffeweizen. The smoke permeates the taste too, and for the second time, it provides a very unique surprise. The mouthfeel is typical for the style, and nothing to write home about. Overall, for me, to have enjoyed this at all is kinda nice. I still wouldn't go back to it, because it's not my bag. However, anyone who has an affinity for this style of beer should definitely try to procure some of this. It's sure to please.","Retail1LO","Aug 21, 2011"
4.38,4.8,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This Saison ale was served on tap and in a goblet. This beer poured a reddish gold color, and it produced a very nice amount of white head- excellent retention. Above average amount of lacing. The aroma of this ale was full of malted grain, earthy grass, with hits of apricot, and spicy clove. The ale is medium in body and tasted of semi-sour apricot/peach and it gave way to a grainy somewhat dry finish. This is an excellent version of a Saison...btw...this style is rapidly climbing my my personal beer style list...

4,-4.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Very nice hazy golden glass of delicious looking Boulevard beer. Fairly shorlived crisp white head, dissipates to a thin layer floating on top. Nice traditional aromas poking out, clove, banana, light spices. Definitely a noticable alcohol presence, but it doesnt personally bother me, i could enjoy it either way. In this case it gives it a heavier mouthfeel, brought alive by nice carbonation and some hints of peppercorn. Nice creaminess in the head with a swirl of the glass. This is pretty delicious, glad i have another bottle waiting for me.","Kkottonmouthkngz","Jul 25, 2011"

4.21,0.7,3.5,5,4,4,4,"D/O: This saison carries some of the most appealing features of a lower-abv saison into the 7-8% range, remaining labile despite its yeast-focused and fully established flavor profile. The smell is very straight-forward, even to the point of being simplistic, yet does not seem to offer much room for improvement. Considering the difference in price and availability, there really seems to be no motivation to choose a Boulevard Saison-Brett over this remarkable beer.","beagle75","Jul 22, 2011"

Tank 7 tastes a little sweet upfront with clean grain, lots of spicy, clove phenols in the middle with an orange peel and yeasty finish. The mouthfeel is soft and light. I'm not a big fan of the hoppy Belgian-style beers with the citrusy hops, I think it's just a little too much to handle especially with the sweetness of this beer.

This follow-up pours a mostly clear goldenrod topped by a half-finger (at best) of white foam (my bartender seems to have overfilled the glass...). The nose comprises lemon zest, clove, black pepper, light yeast, and grass. The taste holds notes of lemon zest, clove, nutmeg, black pepper, orange peel, cardamom, earthy (/flowery) hops, honey, and that characteristic saison earthiness/mustiness. The body straddles the border between heavy light and light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a thoroughly enjoyable farmhouse ale.

I poured this a little too cold, so I let it sit at room temperature for about 15 minutes. As the foam calms down there is quite a bit of lace left behind on the sides of the glass. This beer is remarkably clear for a farmhouse ale, but Boulevard is a big enough brewery that it can afford to tightly filter its beer. The nose is rather complex, mostly fruity and phenolic.

3.55,-15.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"This beer has been in my cellar for a while. With spring in the air, it seems like a good time to break out a Farmhouse Ale. This one is dark yellow with a big foamy white head. The aroma is dominated by hops--just a few bready notes from the malt. The palate feels about right with lots of carbonation and nimbleness. The flavor profile again showcases the hops. The Amarillo hops provide a big citrus kick. Some pine notes are mixed in as well. The beer lacks a little freshness--that thirst quenching summerness of a farmhouse ale is wanting. I would like to see some more pale malt to balance this thing out. Some yeast and spice are proxies in that role. Overall, this is certainly drinkable and enjoyable, I would just like the citrus, piney hops toned down for a beer of this style.","BeardedBoffin","Mar 21, 2011"

Pours a translucent golden-orange with a dense, cascading 3.5 inch, rocky, bright white head that eventually settles into a quarter inch cap. Some spots and strands of textured lacing revealed during the tasting. Nose is fairly clean - citrus, lemon zest, and light, herbal aromatics. Taste follows nose - there's some citric acid as well as bitter grapefruit - flavors fall somewhere between a domestic farmhouse and a Belgian IPA as there is a light, herbal hoppiness to the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light and lively with an assertive, almost prickly carbonation and some astringency that light stimulates the salivary glands along the cheeks and the taste buds across the back of the tongue, before culminating in a crisp, semi-dry finish. A very solid domestic saison; however, citrus astringency is a bit too aggressive. Also a little too bitter and lacking that refreshing farmhouse quality.","Jwale73","Feb 23, 2011"

I can understand being enamored of interpreting classic styles coupled with American hops, I do it often myself, but sometimes (perhaps even often) a classic interpretation is really the best.

The nose is spicy, rather intensely so with a yeasty character along with a rather prominent phenolic yeast expression. A citrusy grapefruit hop character is rather prominent too. The palate opens mildly sweet with honey and citrus. There's a rather prominent american hop profile that doesn't entirely work with the yeasty spice. In some ways, this is a cross between a Belgian IPA and a saison, and as someone who doesn't necessarily see the need for tinkering with the style, this is a little disappointing. Rather intensely phenolic, this is drying and spicy on the finish with some hop character. Again, the fruity American hops are not something I think pairs well with the spicy and beautiful complexity that a saison can exude. Carbonation is moderate, and this beer is more than drinkable.

The finish was dry and lingering with some throat warming alcohol becoming noticeable. The mouthfeel was good with a medium body and plenty of carbonation. Drinkability was good.

Peppery spice and coriander are very prominent up front and they linger throughout, along with a dry bitter hop character, into the finish. Hints of apple, pear and banana along with grapefruit and lemon peel countered by a slight malt backbone, bready yeast and alcohol warmth. I'm also picking up a slightly tangy, earthy funk that adds a subtle tart character.

This beer I am sure is just as good as any other, regardless of rarity. Tank 7 pours out a hazed golden color, and wears a quick to rise frothed head. The nose is full of musty wood, barnyard funk, tropical fruit, and pepper. The taste is nearly identical, but extremely dry, and with a whole hell of a lot of hops backing things up. The carbonation is high, which adds a great level of complexity to the big hop presence. Mouthfeel is really crisp, only furthering the drinkability of this brew. I have to say that this is one of my favorite styles of beer, and goddamn, this brewery knows how to make their Saisons. I will have to refer back to my review of Saison Brett to see which one rated higher. I cannot wait to see how this one stacks up against the soft shelled crab I am about to partake in.

Honestly, it's almost too simple, or too deceptively simple, and sometimes it's nice to have a certain measure of complexity in a beer that you have to work for (or is that only the line of a beeradvocate used to deconstructing things and writing reviews?), but I won't knock it much for that.

This beer pours a super hazy golden straw with a massive, rocky, bright white head that leaves lacing stickier then the vast majority of Double IPA's. Absolutly beautiful. The aroma is amazing. It hits you up front with big notes of mango and pineapple finishing with freshly ground white pepper, hay, damp grass, a bit of clove and just a slight medicinal aroma at the finish. The flavor is amazing. Big fleshy fruits up front leaving freshly cut mango lingering on the palate. Next comes what you expect from a Saison. Massive hay notes, cut grass, ground pepper, yeasty biscuits, a touch of clove and some freshly zested lemon. Beautiful. This is one big, bad mother of a Saison. At 8 percent, the alcohol is masterfully hidden. The mothfeel is full but doesn't have that stereotypical dryness that I prefer in my Saisons. Its something little but hey, we have to find flaws in everything don't we. This is easily (well besides Saison-Brett) my favorite Boulevard brew.

4.25,1.7,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"If they didn't have as many other great beers (and if they were a Belgian brewery), I think they could get away with something like what Fantôme does making only saisons/farmhouse ales. I think this beer is better than their original Saison, so I'm not really going to miss it too much, but I also don't see what's wrong with having three saisons if there all very good.","sjccmd","Dec 30, 2009"

4.72,12.9,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,5,"Tank 7 is the most distinctive, well-crafted beer I've ever had by Boulevard, and one of the most striking, unique, and enjoyable beers I've had the pleasure to try this year.","JEdmund","Dec 14, 2009"
4.03,-3.6,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,"I'll admit it, Saison isn't my favorite style, by far. It seems I either really like em', or really hate em', with the ones in the latter category being the most prominent. That being said, this beer, as well as the Saison regular and the Saison Brett, are changing all of that very quickly.","stephens101","Dec 03, 2009"
4.57,9.3,4.5,5,4.5,4,4.5,"D - Absolutely, I dont drink Saison alot, but this one was Fantastic. One of the top ones at the tasting.","smithr53","Nov 19, 2009"
4.15,-0.7,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"There is some funk in the flavor, not sure if there is a hint of brett in here or if the yeast has a bit of extra funkadelic-ness. Whatever it is, it is tasty. Hops are a bit sharp and would mellow out nicely in a bottle. There is some wheat tang in here that works with the relatively high ABV and bitterness to contribute a dry, spicy finish. This is a bold and flavorful saison, not quite as thirst-quenching as some of the classic Belgian versions but it is a tasty brew that I would happily buy again.","twiggamortis420","Nov 06, 2009"
4.3,2.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Draught @ brewery tour: This one poured a slightly hazy golden color. There was a good sized white head on it that left some lacing. This one has a complex nose. Grassy, earthy, spicy, yeasty, floral, some lemon. It has an equally good taste. I like the little kick of bitterness in there. A bit of citrus and slight piny hops, earthiness, coriander, This is a very nice brew.","Boto","Oct 29, 2009"

4.25,1.7,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Boulevard is quickly and quietly building their reputation as makers of insanely good Belgain beer styles that remain distinctly American. Tank 7 Saison upholds this trend, delivering a blend of vanilla, pale malt, tangerine, coriander, white pepper, and piny hops. Finishes dry and bitter, but soft and juicy at the same time. Tight carbonation on the tongue, with a medium body that makes for exceedingly high drinkability. Recommended.","wagenvolks","Oct 22, 2009"

4.41,5.5,4,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Taste follows the nose. A bit breadier than indicated through the nose, but this helps put the spices in line. Zest, clove, some banana and citrus. Hops in the back cleans out the palate for a fresh, new sip. Very drinkable","Mebuzzard","Sep 23, 2009"

3.46,-17.2,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,4,"Pours a hazy straw with a white head. Good lacing. Nose has wheaty malts, citrus and a collection of spices. Taste has sweet malts, citrus fruits and more herbal spices. Body is a bit light, but still pretty easy to drink. Perhaps more of a Belgian Pale Ale, but still a decent beer.","rye726","Aug 30, 2009"
3.55,-15.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall Impression - This is good saison and another good beer in the Smoke Stack series, but not completely representitive of the style. Worth a try. In fact, I'm going to order a second glass now.","Hullabaloo2","Aug 27, 2009"
3.95,-5.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"On tap at the Stem and Stein in Madison, AL. Orange blossom color to the pour with thin top that dissipated too quickly. It might have just been a bad pour and it was served too cold. Spices and citrus hops in the nose and taste. A little bit of a tart finish. Loads of carbonation. I was surprised to learn that it's 9% ABV. The alcohol is noticeable as it goes down but not THAT noticeable.","Poser","Aug 19, 2009"
3.85,-7.9,4,4,3.5,4.5,4,"Pours a hazy golden yellow, some orange highlights, thin white head forms, drops to a medium ring and leaves some size chunks of lace on the glass. Smell is neat, lots of citrus and wheat, grapefruit, floral, yeasty, light spice, strawberries, toast, honey, like a hopped up saison. Taste is similar, but fruitier, apricots, citrus, floral, grapefruit and orange peel, some caramel and honey sweetness, lightly funky, except the finish reminded me of pickles. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation, pretty drinkable. An amped up saison, but for some reason it didn't totally sit right with me, but good stuff.","Viggo","Aug 11, 2009"
4.28,2.4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"A bit of a stretch for a saison, this one, but very flavorful and refreshing. I recommend it, and look forward to enjoying more and more of this one.","feloniousmonk","Aug 10, 2009"
4.35,4.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a cloudy, golden color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of tart malt, sweet malt, yeast, clove, and slight banana. Fits the style of a Saison / Farmhouse Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and slightly thick with an average carbonation level. There is a slight bitterness associated with this brew. Tastes of floral hops, tart malt, slight sweet malt, some pine, and slight spice (ginger?). Overall, more hops than I'm used to in a Saison, but I still enjoyed this brew a lot.","Tone","Aug 10, 2009"
3.58,-14.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall, I enjoyed th brett version more. This one has too much farmhouse flavor going on. This beer is actually starting to give me a slight buzz so 1 will be all I have.","mothman","Aug 10, 2009"
4.62,10.5,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,"D: Very easy to gulp, despite the higher ABV. I downed three pints of this in about 40 minutes without hardly realizing it. An absolutely excellent brew.","BamaBeerBuff","Aug 10, 2009"
3.92,-6.2,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Nose had the distinctive musty/yeasty scent of a Farmhouse beer. The color was a slightly cloudy deep-gold. There was not much of a head, more just some white wisps floating atop the beer. Mouthfeel was medium with a dry, musty flavor underlain with honey. Unquestionably saison! I thought that it would be a good summer seasonal, provided that it was not served ice-cold and I would not want a whole bunch, given its ABV. It would be drinkable, but not overly so. Warming, it took on a really dry black pepper taste.","woodychandler","Aug 04, 2009"
4.38,4.8,4,3.5,4.5,5,5,"D - Could session one of these and where is the alcohol? They could improve the flavor by adding additional spices and increasing retention, but otherwise a really drinkable and enjoyable beer. Wish they bottled it.","MisterClean","Jul 30, 2009"
4.03,-3.6,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Had this at Stub and Herbs with some friends. Instantly it reminded me of Hennepin without the Funk, and through and through, that's what it was. A decent carbonation, not too strong in any flavor. This would be a great beer to start to introduce people to Belgians with, IMO. Didn't take much notes other than score though.","mdwalsh","Jul 30, 2009"
4.1,-1.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Good stuff, but I won't be seeking this out again. It's an above average Saison, but it's not even this breweries best. For the price I paid, it was well worth it, and if there are lesser options, I'll get it again. But if I'm going to be reaching for a Boulevard Saison, it's not going to be this one.","Mistofminn","Jul 28, 2009"

4.52,8.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,5,"The best thing about this beer is that the drinkability is high for a 8.5% beer. You can easily ask to pour a few more.","KCHopHead","Jul 16, 2009"
