3.54,14.6,4.25,3.25,3.5,4,3.5,"BBD 8/18/14. Clear amber pour with a nice dark ruby hue. Strong head with very good lacing and retention. The nose has soft orange/lemon notes over a tart pepper-like background. Light medium bodied with a nice smooth texture. Above average carbonation that effervesces quite well on the finish. The flavor profile is laid back, but has a well balanced complexity. It begins with a citrus tartness which progresses to a light caramel sweetness. On the crisp finish, the coriander and pepper are noted along with a touch of spicy hop flavor as it effervesces. A good solid ale that leaves you with a touch of spicy heat at the back of the throat..","tillmac62","May 27, 2014"

Soppy to drink with a restless body and quaintly wrapped carbonation presence. There might be a slight tartness that's hard to pull out because of the red grain push and offsetting sweetness.

Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, and spice aromas. Taste is much the same with malt and yeast flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that is drinkable but I am not getting any sort of the Flanders Red aspect that this is supposed to have.","UCLABrewN84","Oct 19, 2013"

There's very little carbonation apparent, and the beer just sits there in the pint glass like a lazy half-cousin. Some sour funk in the smell, french bread, some malt.

3.48,12.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.5,"this is one of the better blue moon incarnations, with quite a lot going on. it has a crazy nose that's tart and fruity, as well as brightly Belgian, and even a little funky. the label says white pepper notes, and when I take my first sip, that's the very first flavor I get on my tongue, dusty white pepper powder, quite nice, and very different. it blends into a sort of flanders red acidic tartness that finishes nice and dry. there is a saison kind of feel to this, yeasty and bright, well carbonated and plenty drinkable. however, like all blue moon beers, there is a weird gut feel, which is different from the excellent mouthfeel. it sits in my stomach a little heavy, and I don't know if its the yeast or what, but it makes me a little rumbly in my guts, which limits the drinkability of this otherwise intriguing and delicious summer red ale.","StonedTrippin","Jun 10, 2013"

It pours a mostly clear auburn topped by a relatively short-lived finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises perfume-y wheat and flowers, sharp (and general) sweetness, and a touch of what I can only describe as peach blossom. The taste holds notes of cracked wheat, coriander, very mild vinegar, sweet caramel, and a vague assumption of Belgian yeast. Overall, this was a relatively ambitious brew from the BM folks, but it just didn't work for me. It's too muddled and schizoid for my tastes, but I still see some value from it.","TMoney2591","May 15, 2013"

This represented a change of pace for me as I am used to Saisons as being on the low end of the SRM spectrum. Cool! Nose had that characteristic earthiness to it that comes from Saison yeast, but accompanied by a slight funkiness. Did Coors really make this?!? Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium and the taste was kind of muted for the style. I was getting a mushroom-y earthy flavor on the tongue and it was not unpleasant, but decidedly different. Finish was very dry and continued to evince an earthiness which was not bad, but not something that left me clamoring for more.","woodychandler","Apr 06, 2013"

I think the taste is just like the aroma, but it's stronger in comparison. It's a bit tart, spicy and flowery. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and slick with moderate carbonation. This was better than I thought it was going to be.
