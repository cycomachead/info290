4.35,3.3,4,4.5,4.5,3.75,4.25,"Overall, the Brett is off the freakin’ charts throughout this beer.  To make matters even more tart and sour, the oak barreling and bitterness of the wine grapes catapults Interlude to the next level.  The latter is remarkable in that you get all of the grapey, skinned bitterness, without any fleshy juiciness or cloying sweetness.  At the same time, however, it never comes across at all like a winey flavoring, as the oak itself tends to be more subtle.  It is obviously present enough to be able to transfer that intense grape quality, but again, they are distinct and separate entities in their intensity and showiness.  For anyone looking to satisfy their craving for a bitter, sour, puckering wild, farmhousy beer, you’re in luck on all accounts.  We are so happy to have had the opportunity to try this well-rounded, yet wonderfully unique beer.","TheBrewo","Feb 01, 2015"

It's like all the bad parts of barrel aging with brettanomyces came together with this beer.  It's unfortunate.  Probably would not buy again.  Well that's wrong.

It has a fruitiness that I'd not experienced in a beer before because I believe it comes from the Brett rather than hops, which I'm more accustomed to.  Pineapple, apricot, peach and some dried fruit and none of the horse blanket/straw I'd learned to expect from Brett.  Just about perfect mouth feel and carbonation.  Overall, this beer really floored me with how good it is.","FFreak","Dec 30, 2014"

I am impressed with the subtlety of the alcohol, and all the cherry character of the booze. enough body for all the flavors to hold up, but it still seems light to me for some reason. carbonation is relatively up beat too. complex as they come, and different from the wild ale crowd. something special here.","StonedTrippin","Aug 13, 2014"

But I am torn between the pleasant flavors and the unpleasant amount of alcohol on the finish. The beer is too delicate to withstand the presence of alcohol. If I can find another 2013 bottle I will age it for another year or so. If I can find another vintage I will definitely try it. Otherwise, and it pains me to say this because there are some really attractive elements to this beer, I would have no reason to buy this beer again.","antott0523","May 04, 2014"

4.3,2.1,4,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Pours a slightly hazy reddish copper in color with a spare light tan head that dissipates to nearly nothing after only a minute. Aroma is quite nice. The first first waff of aroma was pretty darn amazing; fruits in the fore, mostly pears, some oak and background funk. As the beer gets a chance to breathe the character changes a bit and turns more vinous and funkier. The taste is much like the aroma only it leans towards the funk and vinous aspects. When i say funk, I'm not going as far as all out horse blanket; the funkiness, while the dominant taste isn't excessive. Fruits remain in the background and there is a light breadiness that confirms the malt backbone. There isn't much hop character in either the the aroma or the taste but that may be due to the age of this particular bottle. Mouthfeel is good with a light-medium body. Alcohol presence is relatively low and not apparent in aroma, taste, or mouthfeel; its very smooth and the alcohol definitely sneaks up on you. The finish is fairly balanced, its a bit dry at first then some sweetness comes in the balance it out. Overall this is a pretty enjoyable beer. Its not the typical saison given the aging in wines barrels but has many characteristics of the style. If you have the patience to let it age for a few years you'll find a beer that mellows quite well.","mnj21655","Jan 25, 2014"

Aromas of tart wine-like characteristics, cherry and grape sweet, woody notes, and some earthy character. Smells robust. Flavors are dark cherry sweet forward, with an effervescent body that keeps everything very light. Subtle cinnamon spice noted as you drink. Very sweet, crisp flavor profiles across the palate. The fruit characteristics diversify into grape, apple, and berry towards the end of the palate. The tart and sourness builds as you drink, with a slightly acidic building character. Fruits and esthers in the aftertaste, with a slight puckering feel in mouth. The finish is crisp, dry, and slightly astringent. Very drinkable, very robust.","GarthDanielson","Jul 04, 2013"

4.16,-1.2,3,4.5,4,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, August 2008 vintage. Pours very hazy reddish copper color with a 1-2 finger foamy off white head with decent retention, that reduces to a nothing. Minimal lacing on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big sour apple, lemon, grape, cherry, straw, hay, clove, pepper, oak, leather, funk, and earthy yeast spiciness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity and balance of wild yeast character and barrel notes. Taste of tart apple, lemon, grape, cherry, pepper, clove, oak, wheat, hay, straw, grass, leather, funk, and earthy yeast spiciness. Light earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart light fruits, oak, pepper, clove, wheat, leather, hay, straw, grass, funk, and earthy yeast spiciness on the finish for a while. Very nice balance and complexity of malt and wild yeast flavors; with a nice malt/ester flavors balance; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a slick, crisp, and fairly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent wild saison style. Very nice balance and complexity of wild yeast esters and malt notes; and quite smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering. Would like to try a younger vintage of this in the future to compare.","superspak","Apr 02, 2013"

Good flavor, though not as lovely as I remember upon sampling the draft version. Sweeter than expected, with a pronounced honey presence throughout. Nice brett quality. A solid beer. As is customary with me, I would prefer more sour & funk character in lieu of sweetness.","Huhzubendah","Dec 15, 2011"
4.15,-1.4,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours an orangish color with a nice one finger off white head. Fairly murky in appearance as well- like river water. The nose is Brett, with some caramel, malt. Fairly sweet, but not overly so. The taste is really good, just a tad sweet for my tastes. Honey, caramel, cherry, oak and Brett are the main tastes I get in here. I don't get any of the 9.5% ABV at all. Maybe some straw in the aftertaste. Feel is medium, syrupy, sweet, and bitter on the back end. Overall, a very nice beer.. But I'd like a little less sweetness in it, and more sourness. I'm sure it would age very well. Maybe I'll try that some day. Cheers.","jayhawk73","Dec 15, 2011"

The nose is very dry, funky, bretty, with an interesting fruity tartness which is almost melonesque. Perhaps it's aged hops? Regardless, it has more fruit in the nose than I anticipated. The flavors are extremely dry and funky. It is barnyard galore and a brett bomb. You get some slight fruit like sweetness but this is all dry brett. It drinks fine but like I've said, is almost too dry. Overall it's a nice sour and has enough going on to keep you interested throughout.

Body is more of the same as I get a smooth, somewhat creamy medium bodied beer that has this puckering sour sweetness; I get this rush of sweet caramel malts that have some thickness (yeast/bread) along with light fruits (grape and tropical like pear) and this rush of a sour, almost tart finish. Very well balanced and I was shocked at the almost 10% ABV. I don't want to say ""wine-like"" but it reminded me of a heavier white wine w/ the sweetness being prevelant and the plush fruit taste afterwards.","clayrock81","Dec 02, 2011"

Aromas are of an old oak barrel, dusty and dry. Notes of balsamic vinegar rise to the nose along with ice cider whisps. Deliciously belgian, Flemish aromas. Wonderful achievement for an american beer. Brettanomyces - belgian wild yeasts - abund in this complex nose. Raspberries and gueuze-like acidity pucker the tongue and play with a deliciously fruity, vinegary alcoholic profile. Reminds me of a duchesse de bourgogne, only cooler, and more fruity. The body is rather light, with a citric demeanour that gives lightness to a body that otherwise is controlled by its vinegar tartness. Dry and puckering.

I also get apples and cherries as well. First sip is yeasty and funky...you can definitely taste the Brett in this one (which isn't a bad thing). Not as sour as the nose tends to imply, but rather pleasantly tart. There are some flavors of oak, grape, Belgian yeast, and apple...leaves a champagne-like aftertaste.

The taste holds notes of lime, orange zest, light nutmeg, pepper, mild Brett, and a few sparse cobwebs. The body is a light-ish medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly oily feel.

The flavor is strongly of citrus and not nearly as much sour as I had expected from a wild ale. Though I must admit the main flavor tasted almost exclusively of oranges, tangerines wedges to be more specific. However I found the beer to be a little too flat for my liking, again I don't know if that is the tap or if that's just the way the beer is supposed to be, I've never had a problem with their levels of co2 before though.

I really wish this was more sour. the nose lets you think it is crazy sour, but the taste is disappointing if that was what you were looking for. The more I dig into this, the more I dislike it.

Overall this was a nice wild ale. The feel on the palate with the high carbonation was quite nice and refreshing for me throughout this one.

The nose was very impressive; lots of brett yeast, with some sour raspberry and numerous spices, including clove and cinnamon. The flavor was even more impressive; very winey/berry start combined with brett funk, dissolving to a more sour mid-palate, and then finally crisp sugary finish. No hint of the alcohol content. Very interesting flavor progression to say the least. Medium-bodied, spritzy mouthfeel. Excellent refreshing substitute for a lambic or summer ale.","donniecuffs","Jul 03, 2010"

The funkiness of the brett is also noticeable in the smell. I'm not a huge sour ale fan but I do have to say that I'm pleasantly surprised by the taste of this beer. Up front this tastes very much like a wine. Although it has enough beer characteristics to make it clear that it isnt' wine. There is a bit of malt and hop in the background along with the acidic character of the brettanomyces make it clear it is beer. Very complex though altogether. The mouthfeel is sharp and very dry the acidity of the brett and moderate carbonation combine to make this very tart.

Foams up pretty nice upon pouring, but doesn't leave too much lacing behind. Aroma is pleasant, but slightly disappointing. There's a good deal of funk, but not a whole lot of the tangy and sour notes that I would expect out of a barrel age, Brett fermented wild ale. Taste is nice as well, but falls a bit short of my expectations. There's a smoothness to the beer that is pleasant, but it lacks the lively acidity that I was hoping for. It's a very balanced beer, but gets to be a little boring after a while. Overall, this is far from a bad beer, but didn't strike me as wonderful.

Kind of a pink Starburst and raspberry lemonade vibe. Definitely a white wine vibe here as well. Alcohol is well-hidden. I want to give the taste a 4.5, but it gets a bit tiring over time, there's not much to it after the first couple ounces it seems. One glass was enough for me, for a bomber I would probably have to split it with someone. Long finish. A nice change for sure from IPAs/stouts.

Flavor is unripened berry, really no sweetness or tartness in this one, just sort of a muddled funk of a brew, musty, earthy, some funky cheese at times. Where is the sour on this one?? This brew really needs some bugs in here to make things shine. This is too Brett-forward, and the funkiness needs to be offset by some sweetness or sourness or both. Dry finish translates into a dry beer overall, but without the tartness to balance things out. Not really what I was expecting out of this brew.

No head of any substance and very little to no lacing on the glass, but it seems very carbonated. Smells of funk and brett. Oaky and with wine like qualities. The barrel aging did some nice things for the overall complexity of this brew. Pear and overall fruit flavors are apparent along with the funkiness and bready notes. I found it to be mild and restrained for a wild. Very little sourness to it. This is a good beer, very drinkable with delicious wine-like qualities. I was however slightly disappointed this time. I have had only bottles and had this on tap and felt that this particular one was slightly lackluster and over carbonated. I think some age will do this beer well.

Overall this was a very delicate beer, with nice flavor and a decent body. It wasn't exciting to me, as I prefer richer and darker flavors in Belgian ales.

Aroma is some lemon, mixed with a bit of jolly rancher green apple and some watermelon. Taste falls a bit flat. The funky sourness promised by the nose isn't really reflected in the taste. Taste is some caramel and some spicy hops, but the finish is a touch of sourness and substantial alcohol burn. The booziness is fairly prominent and hurts the drinkability. But the aroma is fantastic. Definitely worth trying, especially since they used a Brettanomyces strain from Maine. If they could tame the alcohol a bit and get just a touch more sourness, this would be world-class.","evantwomey","Jan 01, 2009"

Wow. This beer is the most unique beer I have ever encountered, unlike any other beer I've had. Delightfully sour/funky, but not a sour bomb. Nothing wrong with this beer, very well-crafted doubt.

4.35,3.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"I poured this beer from the 750mL bottle into a Dogfish Head oversized wine goblet. The body pours an amber color with a just off white head that keeps a nice ring around the edge of the glass and a fair amount of foam across the top of the beer. Some lacing also remains on the sides. The aroma displays tart apples with caramel and chardonnay along with some spiciness. The flavor hits you first again with the tart apples but the spiciness from the farmhouse yeast lingers throughout and is then complimented beautifully by the tart character of the Brettanomyces and some caramel sweetness. The beer exhibits a medium body with a high amount of carbonation, but a bit of dryness from the oak. This combined with the tart edge provides the drinker with a rather refreshing beverage. The beer seems to be a Saison, Belgian Strong Pale Ale, and Flemish Sour Ale all in one. That is fine by me, seeing they are all great styles. It is pretty intense, making it more drinkable to split the bottle three ways, and can become overwhelming over the course of an entire bottle by one's self.

It pours a golden ruddy color with a good head, nice lacing, and a continuous stream of fine bubbles. Big aroma dominated by oak and Belgian-y floral notes. More of the same flavor-wise, with some late fruity notes (cherry? peach?) and maybe a little anise. A pleasantly bracing sharpness hits the back of the palate late. Not as complex as expected, but still very very good. Truly, I do heartily recommend this, but I enjoyed the Curieaux and the Musette more.","Flyer","Mar 22, 2008"

3.96,-5.9,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"D- This is so complex it's hard to say that it is drinkable. As others have said I think there is a bit too much going on with this one. The Belgian pale aspect of it has some amazing flavors that get a little undercut by the brett. If one focuses just on the wild ale characteristics of this brew still something is left to be desired with balance. I think this one comes close but falls short in the fact that it is just trying too hard to be too many things. I like complexity but sometimes its good to master simple things then throwing a bunch of different fairly good aspects together. While I am pretty hard on this brew, it was excellent and I commend the people at Allagash for putting it together. With some minor adjustments it could be up there with some of the better Russian River wild Ales. Was it worth $20? I'd say probably not but if you've got the itch sometimes you just have to scratch it. I might buy this one again if it were in the 12 dollar range.","Lothore","Dec 01, 2007"

I had this on draft, and it really seems to change the flavor profile a good bit. Not like the smell at all. The sourness was way downplayed in favor of a fantastic creaminess- like a beer cream soda. Utterly creamy, and with a hint of sourness developing in the background, and a strong note of hazlenut on the finish. Utterly amazing- the transition from sour to nutty creaminess is magnificent.

Fruity aroma with some tart funk, sour cherry, sugary malt sweetness, apples, and mild alcohol. Moderate bitterness, a little funk, oaky with cherry notes, a bit of alcohol towards the end with lingering booze. Sugary sweetness and tropical fruit filled out the middle. Medium bodied, fairly light but with a bit of stickyness. Alcohol warmth was a little rough to start with. Carbonation remained spritzy throughout and it had a grainy malt texture. It really opened up as it warmed - I definitely suggest serving at cellar temperature or above. Quite tasty and interesting, though the finish was a little aggressive.","DrJay","Sep 17, 2007"

3.88,-7.8,4,3.5,4.5,4,3,"Pours a slightly orange/peach color with a dance of bubbles floating up from the Duvel 'd'. 1/4 inch head quickly deflates to a slight cap. First whiff presents a sweet malty flavor, a bit like cake and candy. Second noseful reveals the sour bret yeast and a slight peach smell. Not much in the way of hops that I can detect. And then that taste... A big sweet Belgian Golden at the start, with tart apple (plus earthy skin), pear, and a cakey middle. Then, like a damn whip crack, the sour pops up... dry, bitter, and long as a summer day. The tingly carbonation attacks the palate and underlines the pear like flavors that appeared initially. Only as the beer warms do the oak notes appear... almost a honey note that mixes (rather surprisingly) with the tart sour finish. In fact, Interlude isn't finished with the long, dry end. The sweetness from the barrel is actually the last note I get. This is unlike anything I've tasted before. Body is on the fuller side of light. I would prefer it a bit ""thicker," but its rescued by the tap dancing of the carbonation across the tongue. As for drinkability-- its delicious and unique, but certainly not something I would more than a glass of at a time. Certainly this wasn't intended as a session beer, so for what it is, it succeeds in that regard. This is a fascinating creation that I feel fortunate to have put my hands on.

Though I'm not sure about the Belgian Strong Pale characterization, the beer is great at any style. Distinctly Belgian aromas (tartness and sourness) with a musty, farmhouse astringent that challenges the tastebuds. The challenge of the brew stops short of agression or harsh, instead tempered with aged hops, oak barrels and a complex vineous roundness. The beer is well matured and balanced offering rich, over-rippened pineapples, peaches and pears for sweetness. The alcohols are well woven into the fruity, spiciness with merged with nuttiness, oakiness, and strong berry tartness.

4.05,-3.8,4,4,4,4.5,4,"This is another sipper to enjoy from Allagash. Fans of tarter sours might like this more than say, the tripel styled Curieux, or heavier Musette.

4.5,6.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I remember thinking when I bought this that it was expensive, but having tasted it I'd gladly pay more - although I hope I don't have to as I intend to buy more!!! It ranks right up there with the other Brett and oak enhanced ales coming out of the US, and in my opinion it's a little more rounded, softer, and more drinkable. The alcohol is never noticeable, and there's enough Brett character to satisfy even the die-hard fan without becoming sharp. It's rounded, well-balanced, and interesting! Superb!","NeroFiddled","Jan 15, 2007"
4,-5,4,4,4,4,4,"A cidery aroma and appearance, something Cantillon. Some lace. But more enjoyable on the palate, malt and incredibly subdued from being wild and funky.

More funky woody,Brett notes, fresh, tasty, bold, complex, herbal, yeasty, spicy, my kind of beer, thank you Allagash and Barcade for this world class creation which was super to enjoy on tap!","Billolick","Nov 23, 2006"

Taste is similar, along with grapes and some green apples. Prominent dark-toasted oak finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied and slightly drying. Every sip should be taken with slow appreciation. Outstanding!","bwyker","Nov 08, 2006"

4,-5,4,4,4,4,4,"Earthy/grassy hops are there in the fruity flavor. I thought that it came off more tart than anything else. Some pear/apple tones running the show. The oak is here too, just quite subdued. Light bodied with the loads of carbonation being somewhat tingly on the tongue. A little pricey, especially given that brett brews arent necessarily my favority. Otherwise, very nice complex brew. Ill have to try the musette next.","Umbra","Sep 14, 2006"
4.59,9,3.5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"Delicate is the best way to describe this one as it dances across the tongue. I've never loved saisons, but this is spectacular. Sweet ripe cherries with a mildly oaked quality pervade the mouth.	 Notes of merlot and dark berry jam explode upon the tongue as this warms. This is luscious and subtle all at the same time. Intensely complex, this is one of the best offerings out of Allagash or any brewery.","cbl2","Jul 29, 2006"

4.3,2.1,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Very light and airy mouthfeel, like champagne without the excess carbonation getting in the way. Incredibly easy drinking, with the ETOH hidden stealthily in the background.

4,-5,4,4,4,4,4,"Taste is fruity, hoppy and refreshing at first followed by flavors of wildeness and farms. Berries, apple and bananas come in and tickle your palate and ends in a dry sour finish.","3Vandoo","Jun 07, 2006"
4.65,10.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"Tart, livlely, with a balanced acidity. Oaky, earthy. Notes of cinnamon and pear come out as it warms. Medium bodied, lively carbonation. With all that brett flavour and the barrel aging, it's a tasty hybrid between saison and lambic.","xgrigorix","May 21, 2006"
4.62,9.7,3.5,4,5,4.5,5,"Both the brettanomyces and the red wine notes come through in the taste. Very well balanced between sweet and sour, with very little bitterness. Not nearly as strong tasting of the brett as some other beers made with the yeast I have tasted. Superbly drinkable! The 9.5% doesn't come through at all, even as it warms. The mouth feel is a bit prickly, but the carbonation fades quickly. Overall, a tremendous, complex, and delicious beer. Expensive (over $16!), but pick it up if you see it!","judzillah","May 15, 2006"
4.35,3.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A clean sparkleing copper/amber beer. Has a nice fluffy white head and a little lace. There is a sweet and tart apple like aroma. Very much like a cider. The flavor starts with a quick bit of apple tartness. Followed by a serious dry character in the middle and finished with a light crisp tart finish.","ybnorml","May 06, 2006"
4.67,10.9,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Mouthfeel smooth and on the lighter side with a fast paced carbonation that fills the mouth. An extremely pleasurable brew that is equally easy to imbibe. This bottle is quickly disappearing and I'm loving every minute of it. My new favorite Allagash brew, I'll be looking forward to having this again and see what else their experimental series has to offer. Do yourself a favor and track down a bottle.

4.42,5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"What an enjoyable brew this is. The balance of this beer is enlightening; fresh vibrant fruit notes intermingle with the funky wild yeast notes and provide an entirety to this tipple that the individual components could not hope to achieve.","Gueuzedude","May 03, 2006"
3.95,-6.2,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured into a wine glass a burnt orange that leaves a white lace on top of the glass. There is a slight cascade in the body from carbonation. The smell is horse blanket, very vinos, with some fruit essence. The taste is sweet a slight hop citrus profile but dominated by a wine (tannin) quality. Finishing fruity, with a grape, sweet fruit balance. I paired this beer with a grilled steak and artichokes. The savory flavors in the steak really went well with the fruit, tannin, qualities in the beer.","Franchise","Apr 27, 2006"
4.38,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Brewing this one must have been quite an undertaking from start to finish, but the blending of ingredients and aging were obviously well worth the effort. Close your eyes and it could almost be a fine wine, but that beasty duo of yeasts makes it all beer. The ABV is big, and quite gutsy in its presentation, but it's also warming, and a pleasant enough caution. I'd imagine this is one that would challenge some folks' palates, but it sits wonderfully on mine.","Foxman","Apr 25, 2006"

4,-5,4,4,4,4,4,"On-tap at the Blind Tiger, November '05. I enjoyed this guy, though it didn't quite strike me as a saison. Poured a pretty clear orangeish color. Reminded me a lot of champagne, with some very buttery and nutty notes. There's some citrus rind to be found in the taste, and some floral hings as well. A nice, zesty twist a the end of a sip. Mouthfeel was oily and slick, with just enough bubbles. A really lovely brew- gotta find this in bottle form.","scooter231","Apr 12, 2006"
4.42,5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Corked 750ml. Somewhat murky golden orange body with a small white head. Some scattered webbings of lace. Interesting funky brett notes with some backing of citric fruits. Notes of spices and a bit of woodiness are present. Light tartness as well. Flavor starts with some fruit sweetness of the funky brett notes that come on strong. Some oak and tart flavors really added to the complexity. Some hot alcohol was also noticeable through all the other intricacies. Finishes up with some brett laced sweet fruits. Well carbonated and lively in the mouth. Easy drinking but quite the sipper with everything going on in it. Quite a unique and tasty treat.","meathookjones","Apr 10, 2006"
4.5,6.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This new funked up bretty saison from Allagash was aged in French merlot and sirah barrels and it shows. A light toasted orange colour with a nice head off cinnamon sprinkled off-white this one lookes like a real winner. It smell slike a winner with farmhouse and brett induced funky yeast notes in the aroma. The taste is funky as well with a nice winey touch from the wine barrels used. The oak is subdued, how I like it, and the beer is not hot at all for a 9.5% brew. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and the drinkability is very, very good. This funky one-off brew from Allagash is a winner in every category as far as I am concerned. I just wish the price point was lower so I could drink this more often. As for now i'll keep my eyes out for this on tap again!","francisweizen","Apr 06, 2006"

4.42,5,4,4.5,4.5,5,4,"Bottle: Poured a deep hazy and cloudy amber color ale with a medium white bubbly head with minimal retention. Aroma of Brett is quite strong with some sourness and some sweet white wine characteristic. Taste is quite sour with some tart and oak flavouring. The wine oak aging can definitely be notice but does not overtake the beer. Funky Brett brings a nice finish to this beer. Alcohol is not noticeable but Im not sure that the high level of ABV really brings anything more to this beer and would probably have preferred a slightly lower ABV (6.5%-7.5%). Another great American wild ale that even though is excellent is still one notch below the RR Temptation.","Phyl21ca","Apr 03, 2006"
4.58,8.8,4.5,4,5,4.5,4.5,"What a wonderful, interesting beer. This would go well with many foods, but it's absolutely fascinating enough to have on its own. Yet another triumph from the Allagash guys.","geexploitation","Mar 30, 2006"
4.15,-1.4,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1"" off-white head above the slightly cloudy orangy copper brew. Head lasts and lasts, largely due to continued effervescence rising in a fury from the bottom of the glass, with lacing consisting of various bits of foam throughout. Aroma is tart and fruity, with underlying spiciness. Taste is fruity upfront, with the tartness in play as well, with oak, spices, and alcohol warming coming on towards the swallow. Mouthfeel is dueling dry and sweet, yet somehow makes it work, and drinkability is good. These brews pique my interest and curiosity keeps me coming back.","ppoitras","Mar 28, 2006"
4.07,-3.3,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"This poured with a thin, white head and the beer itself was very cloudy and deep amber in color. The nose was musty, apple-like, and very much brett-driven. The mouthfeel was thick and full, very bubbly and scrubbing. I got a taste of sour apple and brett mustiness on the tongue. The finish was utterly sour and puckering and vividly comes back as I type this. It was a very memorable beer. This is a beer that will wake up the ol' palate and leave you thirsting for more.","woodychandler","Mar 08, 2006"
4.65,10.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"Absolutely great full flavor. At first sweet but then quickly followed by a clout of spices (pepper, clove, cinnamon). There is also some nice sourness going on. Not enough to make me pucker but enough to make me run my tongue across my lips. Really get some nice flavors from the yeast--quite juicy and chewy actually. Also got some nice fruit: apricots and peaches. Kind of a grape juice feel to it--syrupy. Some nice flavors from the oak (not sure what the word is though). Nice dry finish that completes this beer perfectly. Such a nice digestive beer and to work slowly through the whole night.","MuddyFeet","Mar 06, 2006"
4.13,-1.9,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Well the beer looked fine but the smell of uric acid made me think of cat piss and I couldn't get it out of my mind as I sipped this beer. There was also leather and a bit of tobacco in the smell mixed with a farmhouse malt funk. It had a taste like none other, but the mouthfeel was the first thing I noticed how the dense carbonation gave the taste an explosive life on the tongue. Full of spicy peppery notes but subdued by a tart asprin flavor only to live again as earthy flower and a touch of pine. The aftertaste carried some tonic water feel in the back of my mouth. The third of the bottle I had was just right, but I could have finished off the rest with out help.","Higravity","Mar 05, 2006"
5,18.8,5,5,5,5,5,"This is exceptional, absolute beer drinking Nirvana. The beer, a hazy luminescet gold. The head, pale white and thin, touches of lacing grip the glass. The aroma, decadant, with shades of currant, plum, red wine, spice. The flavours, lightly tart, vinous, orange peel, currant, earth. Beautifully done....","Hefe","Feb 28, 2006"
4.41,4.8,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Just as stunning as expected to look at, it jumps out of the bottle a pale gold, creating waves of white foam that sticks around the glass edges. The brett tickles the nose with its dryish pineapple, limey, exotic musty flavors, while the wine barrels offer a different floral to look at. Im at first surprised by the syrah and merlot declared origins as the grape character certainly seem paler, tarter, not overly tannic and juicy enough. Gentle mineral character remind of salt briefly, but the fruits offer flavours to match, notably in the shape of sweet berries, banana, apple. Crunchy in its yeastiness, like an elaborated pie crunch slowly heads toward sourdough territory as the tartness grows, remaining centered on the vinous fruitiness and oaky elegance. Soft rounded body drinks easily, light-medium in size with delicate if very active carbonation. Despite the juicy profile being pretty sweet initially, it dries out a fair bit toward the finish. Restrained, peaceful. This is delicious and a revelation to one who thought their barrel experiments never approached the originals, I may not enjoy it as much as their triple, but few other brewers would have this as my second favourite of their lineup. As playing with wild yeasts is quickly becoming the next fad of the industry, it is excessively pleasant to see experts like Rob Tod making some of the first steps and defining benchmarks examples after which others should inspire their desired quality.","Rastacouere","Feb 27, 2006"
4,-5,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer was very carbonated when poured and created a very large head that dissapeared quickly. Hardly any lacing on the glass. The appearance was a cloudy orange color with many tiny carbonation bubbles making their way to the surface. The aroma was very strong. What I smelled was wine and a sourness with a faint hint of the oak. My initial taste was again the wine and sour flavors and at first I wasn't extremely impressed. There was too much carbonation in the mouth. However, when I let the glass sit for a bit, I was much more impressed. It became much more drinkable at that point. I was very impressed with the uniqueness and complexity of this beer. It's hard to believe it is 9.5%. Although this is a pricy beer, I suggest everyone try at least 1 if you can find it.","mcowgill","Feb 26, 2006"
4.69,11.4,4,5,4.5,4.5,5,"All in all, a great beer. I am often skeptical about barrel aging, but in this case it worked beautifully. Not really your typical Saison (which maybe I was happy about) but certainly an interesting and delicious beer.","Lnedrive14","Feb 21, 2006"
4.42,5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours an amber color with a tall head that sticks around and leaves quite a bit of lacing on the glass. The aroma has a bready character with some spicing and a sourness along with some woody hints. Complex. The flavor was well spiced with sweetness and fruits to go along with the slightly sour finish. The slight sourness sticks around along with the fruits. The body is moderate and the drinkability is quite good.","clvand0","Feb 20, 2006"
4.07,-3.3,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Man, this smells woderful. I hate to mention other beers when reviewing another, so I won't. BUT, it really reminds me of at least two of my very favorite beers, distinct common smells. Those are: a very flowery scent, rose-like, just really fresh and green. Also some fairly sweet sugar cookies in there, and maybe some sweetness from the wine barrels? I know that tart or sour aren't really smells, but tastes, but I can tell this will be slightly sour. And yep I'm right. But just slightly sour. This is a great saison though, and definitely somewhat of a hybrid style. It's got a rugged earthyness to it, plenty off grassy, woody character and lots of crab appley attitude. Your basic saison. Then there's the whole barrel aged goodness of this beer. I must say I'm not that hip to wine, so I don't really know what I'm talking about, but I love the flavors that are imparted here. This beer started pretty cold, and it's easy to tell what the base taste is, the basic saison I was talking about. Then as it warms there's lots of complexity piling up. Lots of sweet and tart vinous notes, and a hearty oakiness. This is definitely a hearty, wintery saison. Though not much of an alcohol bite, nice. My only complaint is that it seems overly carbonated, almost like a champagne or something. Very tingly and fizzy on the tongue makes it tough to pick out the many complexities of this beer. Wish it had a softer mouthfeel. Maybe some aging would do this one a favor? Either way, still an excellent beer, with some really classy packaging that lives up to the talk. Funky American beer. Yum.","twelvsies","Feb 16, 2006"
4.72,12.1,4.5,5,5,4.5,4,"Aroma is sour and spicy and a little bit funky. Taste is sour fruit, with some spicy dry notes and some slightly buttery merlot and peppery sirah flavors that linger. But this beer isn't overwhelmed by the barrel it was aged in. It still tastes like beer, and even some hoppiness or is it just earthiness makes an appearance in the aftertaste. Medium to full bodied with a high rate of carbonation. I wouldn't call this a saison, though - just an amazing beer. This would probably cellar well, but I wouldn't be able to hold on to it long enough to find out.","ColForbin","Feb 13, 2006"
