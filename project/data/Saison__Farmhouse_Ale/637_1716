4.32,3.6,4,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.25,"Poured a clear amber orange body with no head and minimal white lacing. A unique looking saison, a portent of things to come. Scents of alcohol mingle with fruity esters of apricot, orange flesh, and aromatic floral hops with a note of jasmine, notes of sugar cookie and some light peppery aromas. Overall impression is of a bigger, strong saison, with more alcohol than traditional, but many of the traditional aromas nicely present and balanced well. Unique yet traditional, a good saison aroma. Flavor begins nicely balanced, a mix of sweet and bitter, with notes of alcohol, orange flesh, herbal hops. Middle is medium in sweetness with the same flavors as the beginning, but with a bit more alcohol. Finish is medium dry, with notes of alcohol, floral and herbal European hops, citrus flesh and peel and white pepper. Aftertaste is alcohol, floral hops and white pepper. Overall impression of taste is of a very nice saison. Strong in alcohol, but traditional in other ways. A good unique saison, brimming with flavor. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation and a lightly acidic feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a saison that is a bit less traditional, but still good. Overall this is a good saison. A wonderful aroma and flavor that are unique yet traditional saison with the same in mouthfeel. A good saison that is quite well executed.","Auraan","Jan 31, 2015"

4.66,11.8,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.5,"I have had this both on tap and in bottles. In bottles the natural carbonation stands out more and the tap version tends to be served too cold. Releasing the cork frees wisps of fruit, bread, light apricot, funky yeast and earthy aromas. It pours hazy gold with a very slight orange tint under a 1” milky white, finely bubbled foam cap that persists and leaves rich lace. This has a rich malty, bready backbone lightly sweetened with caramel providing an excellent base for yeast driven fruit - apricot, orange blended with a dash of yeasty funk as it crosses the tongue. Light earthy hops provide balance on the finish and lead to long, lingering fruit flavors. This has a creamy texture with a medium to medium full body and above average carbonation. This comes in a brown bottle so it has less chance of getting skunky than Saison Dupont and some of their other green bottled beer.","pat61","Jan 28, 2015"

Taste is the redeeming quality, much more depth and room to explore. Hay and farmhouse flavors galore. Noticeable booze on the finish justified the price tag. Carbonation works in concert with the flavor profile. Tasty rarity.","NateF90","Jan 12, 2015"

On top of that, warm stingy spices amongst black pepper build up a fascinating complexity, which results in a medium dry finish, with subtle vanilla notes. Very easy to drink, alcohol is present at no point at all, very intriguing, well balanced beer. Bretts among metallic, lively carbonation are responsible for a supporting sour- and dryness, which underlines the slick. spicy yeast impression just perfect. As I am drinking a young bottle, bretts are recognizable only for a short period of time, mingled together with copper flavor. When those leave the palate, dough malts and supersmooth mouthfeel do become even more present.","aleigator","Nov 04, 2014"

Lots of spice in the taste, coriander, rosemary, oregano, earthy funk, stale grains, manure, solventy booze. Just wasn't digging it. Pretty much like any other Dupont saison I've had, with an upped spice profile. Medium body, mostly dry mouthfeel, but overall uncomfortable, and really hard to drink.

The aroma brings out a satisfying apple grain blend and hints of alluring spice clove and allspice. Promising. The palate quickly enjoys a sturdy apple clove hop with sweet cereal grain with a tasteful yeast idea to balance it off. It does have a lazy carbonation to it which opens up into a fuzzy feel that more than adequately delivers this tasty holiday treat in good order. Body is medium full and it sticks to your ribs just a bit for a saison style but the relatively high ABV is not overwhelming at all. A wonderful treat.","Durge","Jan 28, 2014"

Pours fairly hazy and cloudy golden amber color with a 3 finger foamy and rocky white head with incredible retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Thick foamy lacing clings around the glass, with plenty of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Amazing appearance. Aromas of big lemon zest, apple, pear, pepper, clove, grape, herbal, floral, grass, bread, light funk, and floral/yeast earthiness. Incredible aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast ester notes with a light malt balance; and good strength. Taste of big lemon zest, apple, pear, pepper, clove, herbal, floral, grass, light funk, bread, and floral/yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, pepper, clove, herbal, floral, grass, light funk, bread, and floral/yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and balance of fruity/spicy esters with a light malt balance; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. High carbonation and medium bodied; with a very crisp, dry, and prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden for 9.5% with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a world class saison! Incredible balance and complexity of fruity/spicy esters with light malt balance; and extremely crisp to drink for the alcohol level. Absolutely insane.","superspak","Aug 06, 2013"

Taste is similar to the aroma, the brew tastes like hay, peppery spice, lemon and orange peel, pears, earth and some bready malt. There's more bitterness in this brew than I was expecting. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and creamy, and is very well carbonated. The 9.5% ABV isn't very noticeable at all.

Color was a cloudy lemon-yellow, chiffon-like and reminding me of sunshine in a glass on that cold, snowy day. Nose was dry - papery, peppery and a solid reminder of why I love Saison yeast! It imparted a dry, dusty, mildly spicy taste on the tongue and although it may have been their version of a Winter/Christmas ale, I'd break this out in the summer months.

It tastes of sweet pale malts, light honey, moderate spice, with a nice yeasty and lightly funky finish. It has really nice flavor and the 9.5% is nowhere to be found.

The nose is soft pale malt sweetness, fruity esters of pear and apple, peppery spiciness that I couldn't tell where originates from (hops, actual spices added or yeast-derived phenols, or any combination of those listed) and faint tartness underneath. There's a tinge of soft, spicy alcohol. Flavor is discrete pale malt sweetness embedding the evident tartness that interplays with peppery spiciness. A touch of funk.

4.32,3.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"( 43/50, 9.5% alc/vol, Home) Lacey white-orangey head of HUGE proportions and a mixed bubble size. Chunky head dropping slowly but surely. Ale itself is a greenish yellow. Good carbonation helps keep the head fluffy and light. Golden brown powdery sediment floats forever in the golden hues. Smells like the best gueuzes, even down to the acidic hops character. Oak barrels, barnyard, cotton candy, mushrooms, with a tart citric, unripe apple character. Wonderfuly complex, yet a tad too tart for the nostrils. Has a sulfuric and vanilla depth, leading to an alcoholic end. Huge yeasty vanilla flavours exploding in a multitude of voices: strawberry, acidic, almost lambic oaky sourness, white chocolate, french fries, belgian candi sugar… it is so complex and deep. I was not expecting this at all. The middle to end is strongly cloying and on-the-side sour and ends up being a little overly bitter-acidic. But other then keeping this from being perfect, it serves only to bring up some acid, some tart, some sweet all in a well built package. Wow. Warm, tart, acidic, then sweet, dry and finishes fruity, like sour apples, with a sweet tooth in the end. Has it all. Huge carbonation, with just a tad of bitterness that takes aback before the dry finish. Fresh, complex beyond belief. Just a tad too sour-bitter for my tastes. But then again it keeps it light, playful and brings out the lambic-like oak vanilla-madeira flavours that serves it so well. A huge classic. Try to pour carefully as it gets more cloying with the sediment.","iguenard","May 07, 2011"

This saison is not one of the funkier ones I've had...not very funky at all. Very lovely banana, clove, pepper, orange peel, and lemon zest flavors with a nice bittering bite at the end.

Medium in body with high carbonation, the finish is solid. Mildly drying, earthy, spicy and a little honey are all present. The alcohol does get a little tiring after a while, and I do wish that it was a little lower. Not as complex and not as enjoyable as their flagship beer, this.

This beer pours a rich, hazy golden with a massive 4-inch head that lasts for days and leaves crazy lacing all the way down the glass. The aroma is amazing. I don't think I've ever had a beer with this much aroma. After I opened it up the aroma wafted through the entity of my kitchen and living room. Massive notes of lemon zest, pepper, yeasty biscuits, toast, grassy hops, coriander with just a hint of banana underlying the aroma. Also there subtle notes of funk along with just a hint of sulfur that I think probably comes from the green bottle but adds just another layer of complexity to the beer. The flavor is just as remarkable. As complex as any saison I could want. Massive lemon zest, apple skins, ripe pears, grains, yeasty biscuits and just a wee bit of funk. The funk is a bit toned down form the nose. The sulfur is still there though, once again adding more to it then subtracting. My biggest issue is the alcohol content. Its really hard to hide 9.5% and it shows through just a little bit. The mouthfeel is exceptional. I've never had a Saison that is that creamy and smooth but at the same time it just doesn't finish dry enough or me. This is always my biggest complaint with Saisons. I want them to finish bone dry. Overall this is a exceptional example of a Belgian Saison. Absolutely beautiful.","hwwty4","Jan 30, 2010"

Very sweet later, with a lot of malt/candi sugar coming through. Again, plenty of the trademark Dupont yeast. Slightly boozy, warming finish.

Wonderful bouquet of earthy, grassy hops, some lemon skin and mint leaves. Sweet malt, very bitter hops and a hint of wheat late on the palate.

Solid bitterness with a long dry finish and slight tartness. Mmm...the aroma is getting better and better...a more complex, slightly funky layer is entering the picture. Warm and a little cider-like.

This would not be an everyday beer for me, which I say to contrast it with Saison Dupont, but it is a marvelous special occasion beer and a wonderful holiday offering. This beer does not have an outstanding look for a good saison, but it's held to a higher standard than most beers in this category. The smell is all farmhouse. While it is not a true horse blanket brett beer, it certainly verges on that flavor profile but does so without necessarily scaring off the anti-horse crowd. It has a decidedly refined country flavor, think idyllic Belgian farmhouse. The flavor is full of fruity yeast, subtle malt and refined hops. There are lemons, perfume, herbs, cinnamon, bitter nutmeg and more tastes that I can hardly place. It's rustic and wonderful. There's quite a bit of sediment at the bottom, so do be careful of that. The other slight downside is that a bit of undisguised ethanol notes peek out around the sides, slightly diminishing drinkability compared to its little brother. I would very much enjoy trying a bottle with a little bit more age on it. I broke down with this one after only about six weeks, but then I'm not exactly unhappy about that. At any rate, Dupont makes excellent saisons and this is their stronger version.","popery","Dec 17, 2008"

Taste consistent with nose, but somewhat medicinal at the finish. Mouthfeel fell between light- and medium-bodied with a consistent background effervescence and a slightly buttery texture. Alcohol was well-hidden for 9.5% abv. Finish was on the dry side. All and all, I found the brew to be somewhat bitter and dry.

The candi sugar is there but very subtle as it should be. The tart lemon and green apple kick things off, followed by some clove and other spices. A noticable malt presence to carry the ABV and a very slight stale grassy hop in the end. A nice solid feel with good carbonation; good balance between the sweet, bitter, and sour.

First thing I notice is the peppy spiciness and high carbonation. There's also some candy citrus sweetness in there, but it melds extremely well with a really strong farmhouse earthiness that lingers into an almost bitter afternaste. A tough of caramel malt and yeast. Surprisngly light alcohol, given the ABV.

Taste starts off incredibly creamy, with tons of vanilla and milk. It then becomes more citrusy, with light tropical fruits such as orange, mango and pineapple especially. Body of this one is in the middle, and the alcohol is virtually nonexistent in the flavor. You can definitely feel it after a glass or two, but everywhere else it is downright ghostly. After drinking a full champaign bottle to myself, I am kicking myself for not purchasing another bottle aka this stuff is damn drinkable. I drove to Julios today to pick up a few bottles of Alesmith IPA, expecting to be blown away by that beer. Instead, I came home with one of these and have found one of the best beers I have ever tasted. My first perfect score for a beer, and a well deserved one.

Damn, things are looking good. Lightly sweet pale malt flavor mixes with moderately strong flavor of alcohol. There is none of the tartness suggested in the aroma, and the finish is a bitter combination of herbal hops and alcohol. I'm a bit disappointed by the flavor. If it tasted anything like that flavor it would have been amazing. There is a bit of the sugar and floral flavors in there if you really concentrate, but boy I wish they were stronger. The mouthfeel is fairly light and smooth from massive amount of fine carbonation within. I've got a couple more glasses left in the bottle and I'm hoping it will change as I drink it, but right now it's just overly alchoholic tasting with a boozy finish.","HappyHourHero","Jan 14, 2008"

The smell was sweet pilsner and wheat malts with characteristic saison yeast spiciness and a welcome hop aroma. The taste exhibited much of the same qualities with a sweet malt presence up front but the strength of this one and the alcohol associated with it, seems to amplify the malt characteristic and subdue the spiciness from the yeast. The spices and the hops are still present, but they are restrained a bit due to the strength of this beer. The mouthfeel is light enough, however, which is impressive due to the strength. Overall, a great beer, but for me, I find the regular saison or even a Hennepin to be much more enjoyable.","MSchae1017","Jan 08, 2008"

Smells of light fruits maybe pear and settles into a nose of belgian yeast and spice. The taste is incredibly delightful with notes of apple and pear and that saison flavor that only comes from belgium. the apple flavors really come out in the finish and especially in the aftertaste. Great spice yeast and hop mixture and even a little fructose sugar taste. The carbonation is perfect and not to abrasive like you would find in some saisons. Slides right down the throat. If I couldnt read i would not beleive there was 9.5 abv in this fantastic farmhouse.

It doesn't smell like it, however: the nose holds much more in the way of zesty hops, candi sugar, pilsner malts and a ton of phenols with that fruity Dupont yeast, which throws some lemongrass and orange (maybe burnt orange zest?) into the mix. On the palate. this is a heavy saison with plenty of residual sweetness that could use some time in the bottle to dry out. Still, the flavors are great: smooth, pale malts, creamy orange-and-spice, phenols in the mid-palate. Growing hop bitterness, with orange blossoms, toward the finish, which is dry and refreshing for such a big beer. Mouthfeel is thick and full of fine carbonation. I wonder if it will thin out as the beer ages, but it's still pretty great. Overall, this is a fantastic beer.

The malt becomes sweeter and more assertive at the swallow, ending with a fairly dry finish. Mouthfeel is creamy, lively, and just about perfect. Highly drinkable for such a strong ale.

Neither quite clear nor genuinely opaque, but slightly hazy due to the chill factor and the suspended yeast. Lacing is evident and clings persistently throughout. Massive, bold nose is quite amazing: pale malts start the show and are quickly overrun by notes of clove, white pepper, and alcohol. Yeast? Yes, there's yeast in the nose too, chewy and bready. Very little apparent bitterness on the nose, but neither is there a sweet, bland maltiness. First sip is a real shocker, a mellow "come hither" malt quality gently coaxes you into a position of unsuspecting submission, next thing you know there's a wave of intense fruit notes: pineapple, cherry, pear, and marzipan, alongside a swelling, hot booziness. Somewhat tropical: throw an umbrella,some cube, and a dash of rum in thisand it would make for an interesting Tiki drink! As it warms there's more evidence of an underlying hop bitterness, with some aromatic and floral notes (pineapple, hibiscus) but they are nigh-well overpowered by the substantial malt backbone and warming alcohol. Moderately full-bodied, with a piquant, zesty sweet/sour pucker on the tongue. Mild grainyness to the malt is perceptible, but is largely masked by the hot alcohol. Well-balanced despite its strength, and should readily appeal to fans of the Belgian Golden and Tripel styles. A very substantial offering, it may also be quite a challenge for some, and is definitely not a beer to take lightly.","Chaz","Jan 16, 2007"

4.35,4.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"2006. A very hazy ale with a soft white pillow head; much lighter than I remember. Biscuits, white pepper, and Belgian yeast nose. Strong saison body, similar to Dupont Saison, but with some numbing alcohol and without any residual sweetness. Finishes dry and somewhat hot. Notable hops. Gentle, but very active spiciness coming from the carbonation, the alcohol, and the hops. Very good and refreshing, great for this cold January night which is in the 20s here. Cheers and happy new year!","rayjay","Jan 11, 2007"

4.5,7.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Corked and caged 750mL. The bottle opened with a loud pop - I was expecting a gusher, but things stayed under control. As I poured the first glass, there wasn't much other than a scant bit of hazy, straw yellow beer beneath an enormous bright white head. As the foam settled it left copious amounts of lacing behind. What an aroma! Sweet malts and candy mingle with ripe fruit, grape skin, spicy alcohol and grassy hops. First sip: starts out with sweetness and fruit, but this quickly gives way to significant bitterness and spicy alcohol warmth that lingers. Bready yeast, slight tartness, and grassy hops fill in the middle. Off-dry, with a medium body and fairly high carbonation. Plenty of warmth and a nearly slick texture. Very, very good. The complexity is wonderful, almost like tasting different beers with each sip. Highly recommended.","DrJay","Jan 01, 2007"

Some tropical fruit and pear sweetness in there, but never gets too sweet. Overall this remains a mostly dry beer. Lemon citrus bitterness increases in the finish and becomes more herbal, resinous and numbing. Alcohol is present and warming. Picking up some leftover powdered sugar too. Slight tart/sour barnyard funk throughout lets me know that this is still a Dupont creation. Slightly more complex than the regular Saison. Medium-bodied with a smooth, tiny-bubble feel.

Nose is of sour apples, cut grass, sugar, and diacetyl. First sip yields spicy floral hops with nice bitterness, which moves through sugar and sour apples to a warming, somewhat dry finish. Aftertaste is full of nice grain flavor, very malty. Pouring in the yeast of course mellows the flavor, and makes the beer near opaque.Mouthfeel is medium-light, but with very high tingly carbonation. Marvelously warming in the belly.

It remains mostly unsweet, and yields a nice bready, sour finish. Alcohol is not real noticible in the taste. Mothfeel is excellent, lighter in body, but with an amazing bubbly zest, and intense smoothness. It floods the entire mouth, increasing my overall enjoyment.

The aroma is lightly skunky, with pine/juniper and grassy hops along with lemon and orange peel and some phenols. It starts medium with airy carbonation and a sharp bitterness from the pungent medicinal phenols, along with grapefruit, honey?, and a grassy/musty character. Drinkability suffers due to the sharp phenols, which are nice and make for a good complexity, but are not my favorite byproduct of brewing.

4.6,10.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Pours a very strong straw color, almost a light orange, with a 4 finger head that falls very slowly. The nose is just divine. Lots of lemony citrusyness, a light tart character and a blast of spicey and a very light barnyard character. I like it a lot. The flavor is really good. Orangey lemon citrus flavors hit, but they are creamy as well. A nice blast of spiceyness from the yeasties really comes through as well. There is a slight tartness that stays on the tongue on the finish. I really like it. Very clean and refreshing...crisp as well. There is also a slight drying quality here as well. No hint at all of the alcohol. 9.5% has to be a lie. The feel is moderate to thick with a moderate carbonation. Very refreshing for a big brew. Drinkability could not be better. I'm finding this beer is disappearing rather quickly from my glass. No alcohol presence. Very good flavor and nose. All around solid beer.","kmpitz2","Jun 25, 2005"

Some slight Belgian funk as well. Little bit of sweetness. Smells really good. The flavor has a lot of light fruit and a lot of spices. Little bit of funk in the flavor. Quite a bit going on here. Very tasty. The mouthfeel is light, but has some creaminess as well. The drinkability is really good for such high alcohol. It's very warming as you drink it.","clvand0","Jun 25, 2005"
4.65,11.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I had this on tap last month at the Hop Leaf and was quite blown away with it. When I came across it in the store the next day there was only 2 bottles, which me and my friend each grabbed one. This was a corked and caged 750ml bottle with 2004 on the cork. Cloudy straw yellow body with a full head of white fluffy head. Great retention as the head rides out the session leaving thick sheets of lace coating the glass after each sip. Big fruit notes of apples, pears and other fruits come up in the nose with a light sweetness. Some peppery hops in the mix as are a few other spices. Notes of yeast and a slight funk are also present. Flavor also has a big fruit component with a variety of lighter fruits mingling with the grassy hops and black pepper. A bit biscuity, good yeast flavors and a touch of the old funk really bring this together nicely. Where is the alcohol? Fairly full mouthfeel with a very crisp feel. Bubbly on the tongue and quite refreshing. Great drinkability as well, I could drink this all day or until that sneaky 10% shows itself. Fantastic brew big ass Saison or Belgian Pale ale. Must try if you enjoy the style and come across this.","meathookjones","Jun 07, 2005"

It's only slightly apparent, mostly dictated by the slight aroma and detection of candy sugar. Very little nose detectable - actually gave me a lager-like aroma. This may have been a result of the draft version - neglecting the bottle condition. It was poured a cloudy golden color, rather brilliant, actually. The higher alcohol does not come through in the taste - it is straight and to the point - pleasant and massive in its delivery mechanism: end of the year cheer. The low carbonation compliments the full and dissipating mouthfeel. I could drink this beer until i fall off my rocker.","grassrootsVT","May 12, 2005"

Nose has a tangy spiciness, over ripe fruit, seemed to be a mix of bananas and pineapples, crisp and clean, hints of clove also noticed, maybe even a bit of fusel alcohol, a complex one at any rate, start is sweet and the grain profile noticeable, the top is light to moderate in feel. Finish is caustic, hops are pleasantly spicy, vinous, devastatingly dry and the aftertaste welds itself to your palate, and the 9.5 percent ABV warmed my tummy noticeably, a great beer for a Sunday afternoon.","Gusler","Apr 17, 2005"

Finally settles down with about an inch of marshmallowy foam, with stunning lace coating the glass. The lace actually looks like real lace with alternating patterns of the foamy remnants. Aroma is lightly spicy with sweet maltiness. Taste is wow, creamy sweetness followed by shots of spicing, with a crisp, dry close. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both excellent. A great saison, even better than i was expecting.","ppoitras","Mar 31, 2005"
4,-4.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Bottle: Poured a hay blonde looking beer with a huge white foamy head with great retention. Aroma is dominated by the floral yeast with some good strong malt also present.

Kind of balky hop presence on nose with a candied lemon skin gargle. Very pleasant sweet spring grass on mouth with just the smallest hint of tart yeast that just echoes, and reminds me of childhood summer days and promises of future adventures. Husky wheat permeates the mouthfeel, but not overtly. Balanced; very good.","Truh","Feb 22, 2005"
4.2,0.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"This was on tap to day at Red Bones. The color was hazy gold with a thin white head. Aroma has candy notes along with a combination of citrus and pear. A white sheet of lace was prevalent down the side of the glass. The taste has a nice tartness. More of the pear and citrus. A lot more candy sweetness. This to me was a cross between a Saison, and a Belgian Trippel. It had good characters of both. A mild alcohol warming and hop bite. Slick mouth feel. Very drinkable.","carln26","Feb 20, 2005"

A hazy golden amber colored brew topped by a dollop of magnificent pure white head that laces beautifully. Intriguing aromas of fresh cut grass, musty hay and barnyard, lemon/lime, spicy yeast and a touch of fruity hops. Superb and complex flavors of contrasting sweet and sour. Lots of green grass, lemon, a variety of spice including coriander, pepper, ginger, orange peel, and clove. Fruitry notes of tart apple, pear, and faint banana pull me in further. Deep and complex. Refreshing and satisfying. I wish I had a bottle to myself. Thanks to Bruno for sharing this rare treat!","AlexJ","Jan 17, 2005"

3.86,-7.4,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,"This holiday Belgian pours a light golden color with a nice thick, fluffy white head that holds for quite some time. Good amount of bubbles rising to the top. Smell is a bit strong on the yeast side with noticeable amount whole hop flowers in there. Taste is really complex and nicely balanced. There's a slightly sweet honey flavor in here and a nice little peppery kick. The spice is an additive and doesn't overtake the beer at all. The base is definitely the floral hops which really hold the whole beer together yet they're not overdone either. Nice little fruit yeast flavor in there and the finish gets slightly bitter and lingers. My only real fault with this beer is that I notice a salty flavor that hits towards the finish and the more I drink the more noticeable it gets. Other than that this was a really good holiday saison.","granger10","Jan 01, 2005"
4.23,1.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"on tap @ the waterfront ale house in NYC, as the bartender said, "its from Dupont, it smells like flowers and its strong" Poured into a chimay chalice, 1/2 inch puffy head, orangy amber, cloudy, nose of flower, fruits , spice and yeast.

4.6,10.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"This beer is served in a tulip and has a murky golden body and a whisp of a head of white which settles to a thin lacing on the surface. The tulip conjures up a plethora of smells to create a powerful nose. I first sense acidic fruit, still sweet but quite sharp. Orange, lemon, cherry. Next I detect damp funk. Not as acrid as a horseblanket (a misused term by many. Go visit a stable, and then make the comparison) but still just brooding with wild yeast, like decomposing vegetetation. Finally, a bit of sweet esters, the fruit surges again, then an outright bubblegum sweetness, then a spiciness, then all these things over and over. This is a wonderfully alive in its flavors. They undulate like waves, and conclude in a wonderful balance. The huge alcohol in this is hidden like buried treasure. Drinkability and Mouthfeel are superb, as they complement one another. This beer is a treat, and on-tap it's simply an experience all its own.","99bottles","Dec 20, 2004"
4.17,0,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"This beer poured a light gold color and formed a nice bubbly white head that coated the glass with lace as it subsided. A small amount of carbonation was present. An aroma of malt, hops, coriander, spices and straw. The flavor was of malt, hops, spices with a heavy complex background hard to place under just one umbrella. Combining elements of several and definately impacting the finish, which seems heavier than the beer really is. The finish has some tartness but with this undercurrent present.","Wildman","Dec 17, 2004"

4.65,11.5,4.5,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Matta is such a stellar individual Clear liquid gold wearing a foamy, frothy, rocky gigantic-sized white head. Very carbonated body. Gotta love such a complex aroma that never hinted at being not as great as expected by me (who still recently fell under the charm of their Dupont Forêt). Ultra farmy, dry and yeasty, very yeasty obviously like all other Dupont. Lovely barny and spicy hints. How can you not love a fine Saison. Bone-dry (made me think of chalk at times) with awesome white wine aspects. Deep spice profile includes coriander, basil, pepper, thyme, mint, sage and just various other herbs. The first sip proposes a malty attack with lots of dry hay, some apple and so much yeast. Finish is dry with a grassy hop bitterness, but remains restrained and balanced. Aftertaste comes back to haunt me with suggestions of dust and spices and that scores big points with me. So herbal, so intense and no alcohol to speak of although there's a charming warming effect. Body is medium, quite carbonated, mouth-cleaning for sure and lightly tart at times. Marvellous Marvel. I'm truly impressed and in great thirst of Saison for the rest of my days.

4.3,3.1,4,4,4.5,5,4,"Another one of those refreshing delights amid the common heaviness of winter seasonals (don't get me wrong, I love the big beers too). This beer pours out a hazy golden yellow with a nice thick, pillowy white head that lasts forever leaving a serious coat of lace down the glass. The aroma smells of a bready yeast and fragrant lemony citrus. The taste is slightly sweet but dries up in the finish where you'll find a trace of hop bitterness. There is a tartness present which melds well with some of the light fruitiness found in the flavor. There is ample carbonation that lends to a full and smooth mouthfeel. The more I taste the more I realize that there is more going on here. For being what I thought was a lighter beer, there is alot going on here - citrus, light malt, fruity esters, and spice. Forgive my oxymoron, but I think this beer is both light and rich. The alcohol is hidden but present and slowly warms the belly. Great stuff, go out and get some.","DrewS","Jan 02, 2003"

Yeast must and lightly tart white grapes hit the nose at first, then notes of damp bready malt and clove surface. Hint of dry herbs and black pepper like alcohol. Note of green apple adds additional tartness in aroma. Fairly dry and tart overall aromawise. Contrary to the aroma, the flavor profile abounds in a pleasant, light, sweetness. The initial honey like sweetness morphs into a fruity melange of grape and pear, then is immediately contrasted by green apple, medicinal phenols and notes of black licorice. Hint of heaty, solvent like fusels. Lightly bodied. Agreeably crisp mouthfeel. Finishes herbally sweet, with pronounced clove and an impression of dried oregano. An intense, flavorful beer. Strong on the medicinal phenols and higher alcohols. Perhaps further cellaring to tame this brew would elevate it to excellence. Bottled 2002.","marc77","Jan 01, 2003"

A cloudy golden color with a huge rocky white head and good lace pattern down the glass. The same peppery-fruity nose and palate but with a stronger yeasty flavor in the back and then the traditional hoppy finish. Also the highest carbonation of all the Dupont beers I've tried.
