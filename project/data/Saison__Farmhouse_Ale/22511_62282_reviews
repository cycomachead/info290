"Overall: This is my first Hill Farmstead beer and I am amazed at how well crafted it truly is, if I had not just ran across the date I would never have been able to tell that it had over a year of age on the bottle. Super beer! I hope this is the first of many opportunities."
""
""
""
"The smell and the taste definitely have a lemon zest quality.  There is a good amount of sourness which I'm guessing became more pronounced with age.  The sourness is well balanced by a slight sweetness from the malt.  It's a very well crafted beer that I would trade for again if the opportunity arises."

"Overall - I am not huge on the style, but I enjoyed this one. It does not possess the medicinal qualities of some in the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I really enjoy this beer, one of my favorites from Hill Farmstead."
""
""
"Amazingly good beer! Hint of sour accompanies the light citrus aroma.  Mouthfeel is on point.  Beautifully done, Hill Farmstead!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Love this. What a great brew if you can find it"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle, pours orange with white head.  Aroma is light tart and yeast.  Taste is more tart than i expected, really tasty"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a world class Saison, super complex, balanced, and tasty. I expect nothing less from Hill Farmstead."
""
""
""
""

"From bottle, fridge temp in snifter. 10/14 bottling consumed Jan 4 2015.Pours a light gold with beautiful cloudy white foam. Nose of barnyard from the yeasts with a hint of sourness. Taste is a refreshing saison with the late sourness but not over powering. Lemon sorbet - I'm thinking of the Lemon Ice on a hot day at the old Yankee stadium (go Blue Jays!), granny smith apple. Great acidity - eating eat with Sushi and would recommend this combo to foodys. Wish I had some oysters too. Overall enjoyed on it's own and with food. Thankfully I have another bottle which I will save for a warm summer's night."
""
""
"Overall (4.5), this is just a fantastically crafted beer. The saison style is a broad-ranging one, so it's hard to compare takes on the style that can be quite different from one another. That said, I can attest that this particular beer more than lives up to the massive reputation that precedes Hill Farmstead. It's the quintessential tart farmhouse ale in my mind."
""
""
"Quite a bit more tartness than I anticipated, which was a great surprise. Light and quenching with a lovely yeasty complexity, some florals and fresh citrus, with a robust barny undertone and some hoppy spice. A lovely saison and I will look forward to seeing how this ages. Balance is pretty terrific, but you do have to crave the acidic tartness."
""
""
"Soft beer with balanced hops and carbonation."
""
""
""
"This would be a great warm weather beer to sit by the pool and crush all day long."

"Overall, this is the type of saison that is right up my alley. Grainy and just a little spicy and funky with a light to moderate level of tartness. My favorite saisons have that tart aspect yet keep a great complexity with grain and funk, and this beer has all of those qualities."

"Mind blown. Mind on the wall like Earnest Hemingway. All those grassy, peppery saison flavors, but with a dollop  of the most glorious citrus possible. Am I tripping? No, I'm alive."
""
"Not tart like Anna and Florence, which I actually don't mind as it's a Saison. A bit one dimensional. Still a fantastic saison."

"Overall, I am still not wowed by HF, but this is a very solid Saison.  First off, I am not a Saison type of guy, but I try to review true to style and not personal preference.  So, if I was a Saison guy and this was my style of choice, I could definitely drink this with ease, but I would definitely want more pepper and spice in the brew which I feel this was lacking a bit of."

"O - My first brew from Hill Farmstead, with Nordic in the fridge. Very delightful brew. Unlike any saison I've ever had. Enjoyed the short, but informational story on the label."

"Flavor: Again that sour flavor kicks more flavors of lemon then that apple/pear."
""
""
""
"Drink- Ill keep this brief. So crushable! Easily couldve done another bottle!!!"
""
""
""
""
"O - Easily the best Saison that I have had and it has everything I want in one. What a treat and I am lucky to have tried it. Now I want more!"

"Overall, a really good beer that is worth trying."
""
""
""

"Has all the things you'd want in a saison. Lemon and citrus notes that are perfect on a hot summer day. Tastes like it has a bit of funky sour going on too. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, drinking like always. Citrusy, grassy, tart, dry, extremely refreshing. One of those saisons you can't get enough of. Drinks way too smooth."
""

"Overall: Another amazing saison from Hill Farmstead. So refreshing and well balanced. Well worth seeking out."

"O: An outstanding farmhouse ale, not my usual class of beer but I'm now a convert (thanks to Ari for taking the drive and gifting me the bottle). Seriously refreshing--- i'd take a case of this on my trek across the desert! Another winner from HF."

"Pours a deep gold with a thick quickly dissipating head. Good lacing. Faint pepper and biscuit on the nose with some dry white wine notes following. Dry on the tongue, very spicy with lots of pepper. Dry finish as well. Light bodied with good carbonation. Overall, a supremely well crafted and easy drinking farmhouse ale."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice golden yellow beer. Normal head forms at the top. Smell of brett and funk on the nose. Taste is mildly sour, perfect for a saison. Some Belgian yeast is present, but very well balanced beer. Not hoppy or bitter whatsoever. Body is light."
""
""
"Tasted this at Brewfest 2014. A nice farmhouse ale that I wouldnt mind trying again as beerfest only gives you 4 oz glasses and the lines are kind of long at the Hill Farmstead brewery section. Very bitter beer that had a nice clarity to its look and the taste was unusual. Would highly recommend."

"Courtesy of Ineedabeerhere (thanks Joe!). Bottled 05/2014. 750ml bottled served in a tulip. Pours a translucent straw-gold with a fizzy, 2.5 inch bright white head that sizzles and pops as it slowly recedes into a soapy slick. A thick band of lacing encircles half the bowl of the glass and lingers between quaffs. Nose is slightly grassy and suggests green apple, a slight lemony quality and a suggestion of spice. Taste is biscuity and lemony and the green apple quality is present, but less so than in the nose; something of a Berliner-Weisse character in the flavor profile in my opinion. Mouthfeel is light in body with a bright carbonation that tickles the tongue and a slight astringency that stimulates the salivary glands. Overall, a decent farmhouse but a bit too clean for my general sensibilities. Well worth a try if the opportunity presents."

"Re-reviewed 6/25/2014. Batch from 5/2014, poured into a Hill Farmstead stemmed glass. Essentially, appearance is similar- hazy straw yellow body with a nice two finger white head that lingers for a long while, leaving streaks of lacing. Smell is tart green apple skin, bready pale malt, peppery yeast spices, and quite a bit more funk than the last couple batches have had. Flavour is pretty similar, there is also a nice vinous quality to it that complements the tartness of the apple skins, which is actually tarter than previous batches, which I'm enjoying very much. Mouthfeel is medium in body, creamy and smooth. Very easy to drink. This is definitely the best batch of Arthur, versus fall 2013 (don't recall the month of bottling) and 2/2014. In particular, the 2/2014 bottling needed a good bit of time to reach the levels that 5/2014 is drinking at right now."

"No bells and whistles here folks and none are needed. Arthur is a tremendously well made American saison with all the qualities of the best. Rustic is a good descriptor. It's very outdoorsy with the spiciness, floral and orchard qualities, and soft woodiness. Hill Farmstead nailed this guy! Thanks again, Ryan!"

"Cloudy deep straw color with a decent sized white head that dissipates slowly. Aromas of tart funky lemony light sugary malt. Flavor is tart citrus with hints of funkiness and bits of earthy earthiness to round it all out. Really nice funkified farmhouse ale."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a great representation of the style. I enjoy the crispness that holds true throughout the glass. Very flavorful and pleasantly tart."
""
""
"A delicious farmhouse style ale. Very crisp and tart with complex fruity, citrus zest and spice flavors and a fantastic clean, bready malt backbone. Highly aromatic and really develops as you allow it to warm in the glass. Hill Farmstead makes some amazing beer."
""
"Honestly, I can't wait for them to start barrel-aging all Arthurs, but for now I will savor this wonderfully complex yet simple Saison. This shit right here creates the hype of HF beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is interesting. I think that the best comparison is to Blvd Brewing Saison Brett, even though this doesn't have brett in it. It's a good saison, not perfect (I prefer more of the traditional belgian flavors like bubblegum, clove and banana in my saisons) but it's pretty damn good. That being said, I don't think that I would be paying $30 a bottle that it cost out in cali again. I'll wait until I make it to the brewery this summer."

"Overall: Hill Farmstead saisons are fricking amazing. This one is no exception. The tartness really adds depth to the flavor profile of this beer. I could drink this beer by the gallons and never get bored. This beer is very much reminiscent of Dupont Saison."
""
"Beautiful carb, lightly drying and refreshing. I could drink this all day."
""
""

"O-A excellent saison. The mouthfeel is spot on with a good carb and the taste with that sour/tart finish is awesome. This is a very unique yeast that did a beautiful job turning this wart into a all around enjoyable, thirst quenching brew. If you are fortunate enough to go to Hill Farmstead and even more fortunate to be there when this is on tap/bottled get your self some! You will not be disappointed!"
""
"Pale blonde colour, hazy with a ring of white head, lots of lace all the way down the glass. Smell is a nice mix of yeast and frutis, bright citrus, pepper and spice creeps in with a little bit of funk, a bit of malt followed by more fruits. Taste is sharp and tart followed by some lemon, flavours similar to sweet tart, tons of citrus fruit, long drying finish. Medium drying carbonation, medium body. So good, and something I could drink a lot of, I probably could have drank the bottle alone no problem, would love to have this again."
""
""
""
""
"O/D - This was pretty tasty. Lot's of funky and lemony elements. Fairly drinkable. Well put together flavours."

"Had out of a bottle - friend visited Hill Farmstead and came back with one. This poured a very heady pour, and very light color...is this a Bud Light? The smell hits you quickly. I read the word tart from others, and this is 100% true. Very pure saison that has traces of a sour ale almost in my mind, but better carbonated. I hate to grade this as the style isn't in my wheelhouse, but I can see others liking it. I am still drinking it trying to determine if it is growing on me....I think it is....damn it is tart."
""
""
""
"The pour is a hazy orange golden yellow, with a smallish white head. Nice lace left behind on the glass. The aroma is soft lemon citrus, dry floral, a bit of yeast funk, and a very pleasant mineral earth encompassing the entire nose. The taste is tart lemon citrus, with floral character, opening up to the dry funk yeast earth and mineral. The palate is lovely, medium to light bodied, soft natural carbonation, and a dry tart funk mineral finish."
""
""
"O - Take this review with a grain of salt... this is my first of this style, so I may be off. The overwhelming tart lemon was unpleasant to me. I opened a second bottle to confirm that the first bottle was not a bad sample, but the same flavors and smell was presented. Loved several other HF offerings. but this one I did not like."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, for a rustic saison, this is a great beer. It's not really at all sweet; there are other options for that kind of saison. The Brett is the dominating flavor, but it's quite well balanced and expertly crafted."

"would get again for sure i liked this much better than ANNA"
""
""

"Pale straw-golden beer, thick frothy white head. Crisp, light and refreshing citrus notes, white pepper, a touch earthy and light spice. Another infinitely drinkable and refreshing saison from HF - I prefered Clara to this during this session, but either one would do the trick on a summer afternoon."
""
"Terrific saison. Aroma is tantalizing with a fruit invitation. Cloudy yellow. Understated carbonation allowing for the palate to appreciate the tanginess. Some lace. Slightly pickled lemon taste and that's a good thing. Very good drinkability. Lots of farmhouse in the end of the bottle."
""
"(4.25) D: Excellent farmhouse saison. The trip to the brewery is well worth it for their offerings, and worth it alone to pick up more of this."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is really nice, but I really wish it didn't have that stomach acid effect because it's a huge turnoff for me. If not for that one flaw, this might be my perfect beer."
""
""
""
""
"In the lower end of the upper tier of saisons. Musty and earthy. Not stunning, but very good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Definitely a quality refreshing saison. Just a tad of barnyard which mixes nicely with the flavors. The hop presence adds an interesting element to the flavor, especially the finish. On a hot summer day, this beer is a savior."
"Overall, this may be my favorite of the HF saisons I've had so far, but I'd like to revisit Anna. About as simple and straightforward as a saison can be yet so damn tasty."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A really clean, well crafted Saison"
""
""

"O- very good saison. Enough sweetness to balance the citrus, slight sourness and bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Another nice saison from HF. Hits all the balances of yeast, fruit and malt."
""
""
""
""
"O-This is insanely drinkable, the flavors come together so well, giving you a little funk with your malt. This is a fantastic brew and i cannot wait to get more. I'm adamant about Saison DuPont being the standard bearer for the style, but Arthur blows that out of the water (with all due respect, DuPont did have the Saison standard bearer title for a very long time for me). Another great beer from Shaun Hill"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- God- the last time I had this same batch it didn't blow me away. This time around, it is clear that the bugs have taken over and just bumped this beer up in to the top tier. The lemon adds a tartness that is very well balanced by the pepper phenols and bitter hop notes at the end of the taste. The high carbonation and drying effects make you crave another sip, and the appearance is as close to perfect for a saison as one could ask. Give me more please...."
""
""
""
"O: Not the most complex saison out there, but it's extremely drinkable. Refreshing and quaffable, even. One of those 'simple pleasures' sort of beers."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Nothing fancy here, just an incredibly well crafted, refreshing, easy to drink saison."
"(O)- A world class Saison in every sense. A bright yet dynamic and complex beer that has everything I love about Saisons. An instant favorite"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very nice beer, super solid!"
""
""
""
"O- Another very tasty saison from HF, compared to Vera Mae this was my 2nd favorite, but I would gladly drink this again any day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A damn solid saison, but I much prefer Anna or Florence over this. It is rustic and a bit spicy and bready. I just prefer fruitier and sweeter saisons."
""
""
"Overall- Hands down the best saison I've had period."
"O: A crazy delicious example of what I hope every Saison/Farmhouse Ale tastes like when I put my lips to it. Perfectly executed. As with all their beers...the hype is real."
""
""
""
"O- It's not barrel-aged, it's not a Brett-bomb, this is just a straight-forward saison with great flavors that change subtlety through each sip. This one does not disappoint."
""
""
"Verdict: A pleasant saison from Hill Farmstead, but the earthier, rustic elements of this beer aren't really my favorite. Compared to Anna, which was much more vibrant, this seems rather pedestrian. I'd still recommend this to anyone who enjoys a Saison or Farmhouse style beer."

"Big thanks goes out to 67couple for sharing this one at a recent Random Sunday Tasting! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured a hazy pale yellow with a one finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, fruit, earth, fruit hop, and spice. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, fruit hop, spice, earth, and fruity spice. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. There was quite a bit of fruitiness going on in this one that definitely balanced quite well with the Saison aspect going on in it. The spicy and earthiness from the style definitely shined through and was quite well incorporated with the rest of the brew and managed to compliment the other aspects well. I just wish there would have been a little more complexity going on to take it to a new level. Glad I got the chance to try this one, but not the best Saison I have ever had to this day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Fantastic beer, loved the level of tartness mixed with the lemon/zest flavors going on in this beer."
"O- what a saison. Barnhouse Funk! Arthur delivers as a delicious mouth watering saison. I will say this again... Hill farmstead is the best brewery in the world!"
""
""
"Very easy drinking beer. Just the right amount of tartness to keep me wanting more, but not to overwhelm the palate. I hate most saisons, but whatever HF does with them is gold because this is another winner."
""
""
""
"O: Extremely refreshing and quite complex. I love this Saison and imagine drinking it in the Belgian countryside."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"8.1/10"
"O: A fantastic beer. I might have liked this better than Abner and this is coming from a big time hop head. The complexity in this beer is top notch."

"growler at Buddha Beer Bar in NYC."

"That’s all I got to say. I’m nearing the end of this crate of Hill Farmstead I traded for and I’m yet to come up with a single worthwhile thing to say about any of them. Fuck you."
""

""
""
""
""
"It's an impressive saison that's deep in flavor and a fun mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall. This is some amazing stuff and exactly what I enjoy in a saison. The sour citrus is there with a perfect balance of delicate spice and yeast flavours. Really great stuff."
"O-a solid Saison with nice flavors, easy drinking"
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a wine glass. Had after Vera Mae and this is good but not like HF's other offerings. Smells slightly farmhousey, tastes like a somewhat watered down version of the style, not a ton of flavor. Good, but more like a lager or witbier than a saison. I prefer HF's other offerings more."

"O: Thanks to notjustgc for sending this in a trade. This was my first Hill Farmstead beer and was it ever enjoyable. I will certainly seek this and other HF stuff out again. Might just have to make the trek to Vermont as it might be easier to attain that way :)"
""
""
"O- Thought it got better and better throughout the bottle. Above average saison without a doubt."

"o: outstanding! this is my first offering from them and i have to say that their beers are worth seeking out."

"Wonderful."

"Pretty par for the coarse for Hill Farmstead... that is to say, amazing and one of the best in the style. There's great balance and complexity in this beer and it'll only get better with time. Clearly worth a try."
""
""
"This is a light bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is light and easy drinking with a sort of hybrid saison/ipa feel about it. The nose far and away is the best aspect of this brew with the flavor profile falling a bit short. Overall though, it is without fault and is a beer I would revisit if given the opportunity. Prior to drinking this, I commented on Vera mae being one of the better saisons by Hill Farmstead that I have had. I stand corrected, Arthur is even better. Nicely done."

"Pours a cloudy yellow with a high, dense head; leaves a good bit of lacing. The smell is a little tangy, with some woody notes and some clean mineral sparkle to it. The taste is tart of front, with a round maltiness in the middle as well as some floral and herbal notes; the finish is clean and sharp. It's highly carbonated though none too fizzy, a tad slick. A nice saison, if on the tart side."

""
""
"O- Best saison I've ever had. Period"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"*Old review aside, this has easily morphed into one of my favorite beers over the years."
""
"A well made rustic farmhouse ale, bright, sharp, a bit tart... Drinks more like a cider. I would like a bit more depth as its a bit linear, but its still a nice farmhouse ale worth getting if you're into the style."

"Overall: I can't think of many Saison's I would choose to drink over this one. For me it's a fantastic combination of complexity and drinkability. It holds my interest in the same way a good sour does (RR Temptation), but is so refreshing and the ABV is so reasonable it could be an everyday drinker. That is if you live within driving distance of HF and have a bunch of $ to spend $10/750ml. It's worth it, IMO, but I do not drink it everyday. We'll save that for when I take Kramerica public ;-)"
""
"O- This was a fantastic saison that had a nice rustic funkiness and tartness to it. I would definitely recommend this to a saison lover who likes a little bit of tartness/funk to their saisons. I can definitely see how some people would not care for this beer at all- I gave some to my Dad (who has never had a saison or sour before) and he thought it was the worst beer that he had ever tasted."
"o - Overall I thought this was a great saison; another HF winner. I wasn't expecting any sourness or funk, but the taste had it and it was great; reminded a bit of Fantome. Would love to get this one again sometime."
""
""
"This, to me, IS the definition of an awesome saison. This reminds me of how I felt when drinking McKenzie's Saison Vatour Du Bois. Really, I know thee aren't too many of thee floating around, but if you like funky saisons...get this!"
"Great carbonation, nice body. Glad I tried this; Joey says I'd like the blue bottle more than this turquoise one."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Another amazing offering from Hill Farmstead. Not quite as good as Vera in my opinion, but pretty darn close."

"pour is a light hazy yellow with a tight slightly off white head. The nose is DuPont esq. which puts it in high regard. Extreme farmhouse yeast, a bit dusty and peppery with a soft lemon in back. Wow, the flavor is huge. Very unique. The flavor has a very strong peppery presence with an extremely pronounced fruity lemon less the tartness. The farmhouse yeast is a bit less assertive and very unique, a touch but dusty with light touches of mushroom and hay. The body is soft and light with a very dry finish and strong carbonation, almost champagne like."
""
""
""
"Pours a hazed golden color with a tall white head. Excellent nose to this. Straw, yeast, and citrus peel aromas. A light sweetness, some floral notes, and mild spice. The flavor is crisp and refreshing. Biscuit malts, floral hops, yeast, and lightly spicy. A bit of citrus peel, and a light tartness throughout. A very mild funk in the background, too."
""
""

"O: B+"
"O- A solid Saison and I am very happy the I have another bottle. I would really like to try Art based on how good this beer is."
""
""
""

"Straw yellow with a lingering head. Big aroma of tart fruit and funkiness. Moderate carbonation. Flavors of horse blanket, fruit rind, herbs, funky yeast. grass, lemon, earthy flavors. Drinkable in modest amounts...not something I'd dream about but flavorful and tasty!!"
""
""
""
"O: Quite easy to drink, but there are few complaints about backyard saison-drinking when the weather is as gorgeous as this! My wife only finished about half her glass, complaining of too much carbonation. I didn't mind at all and thought the carbonation was just right: springy and lively enough but not overdone. This ranks up there among the 'really good' US Saisons I've tried, not terribly complex but altogether satisfying to drink."
""
"Pours a murky yellow with a foamy bone colored head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots and streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain, yeast, spice, pepper, and some citrusy aromas. Taste is the same with a nice spice bitterness on the finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good saison but it smells better than it tastes in my opinion."
""
"O: Very enjoyable and easy to drink, definitely a session beer for me. Wold love to track down some more of this one as I found it very tasty. Just enough but not too much barnyard funk."
" A really well made, very clean, super easy drinking beer. Light body, good carbonation, refreshing and crisp. However, it lacks both, the sharpness of Dupont and certainly the complexity of Fantome. Having tried their IPAs and a couple other styles, I am totally bowled over by the hoppy stuff but I am not overly impressed with the porter or the saison or the wild ale, Mimosa."

"O - Easy drinking, flavorful Saison. Well done. Great for an American version of the style. Very refreshing and clean."
""
"it's a bit different. not the most impressive saison, as it plays it safe, not going too tart or sweet or yeasty, but its pretty tasty and veryyy easy drinking."
""
""
""
""
"The body is light with expansive carbonation. Overall a sound saison. Real tasty stuff, which is what I've come to expect from hill farmstead."
"Out of a bottle given to me for my birthday (thanks David!) this beer was a hazy golden color with one finger of white head. The retention was impressive and it left consistent bands of lacing. The aroma was of melon, apricot, grassy hops, pepper, hints of citrus and some musty ‘horseblanket’. The flavors were also complex and impressive. Though not as well defined as the aroma it did have all the aforementioned elements built around a core of pilsner malt and toasted malt. Clean and refreshing. The mouthfeel was creamy and delicate, the body medium and the carbonation perfect. A very nice American Saison and it made me proud to be a Vermonter."
""

""

"This is a ""rustic farmhouse saison"". Yep, I agree with that assessment. Nice beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: A solid saison all-around but nothing earth shattering. Above average but not my favorite from HF."
""
""
""
"Overall: Very light, faint, and super flavorful. A delicate beer that is a masterpiece. I have yet to be disappointed by a Hill beer and this is right with the best of them. I could drink this every day. A friend of mine who I gave some to said this tasted like a fine Champaign and I tend to agree."
""
"O - Light and smooth, very refreshing."
""
""
"This is a solid saison, but lacking in the wow factor some of the other HF saisons bring to the table."

"D: [DRINKABILITY] The modest ABV keeps the drinkability high. I would definitely order this beer again, several times over."
""
"O: Goes down easy, very tasty, somewhat filling, mild kick, very nice representation of stle."
"O/D- Pleased with my first Hill Farmstead offering. Very delicate and refreshing with a complex flavor profile that remains balanced. Thanks to duff27 for sharing, per usual."
"D/O- Highly drinkable even if over a long session. Here's to my girl's 50th review. Thanks for the Hill Farmstead bhollas!"

"Clean lemon and Belgian yeast flavors in this, and that's about it. Not a bad beer per se, but I was expecting more."
""
""
"D - Crushable stuff - I drank most of the 750ml bottle on my own after pouring a few small snifters for guests. My own complaint is that the taste is a bit tame and doesn't match the other facets of the beer. I like Art better, but I'd gladly have this again."
""
"Bottle: Poured a hazy bright golden color ale with a nice large pure white foamy head with good retention and some excellent lacing. Aroma of rustic ester and floral malt is very nice and enticing. Taste is also a nice mix between some floral malt with good attenuation and limited sweetness with some rustic notes and a lightly spicy yeast strain. Body is full with excellent carbonation. Hops are present though not overly so and provide nice zesty flavour. Another great combination between some complex flavour while retaining some great complexity."
"O - Overall this is another good, solid enjoyable beer from Hill Farmstead. Wish I didnt have to drive almost 4 hours to get their brews!"
"Overall: This is a very well crafted beer. Great balance. Lots of flavor but still light and easy to drink. I'd love to have it again."
""
"A very tasty and spicy beer. A great example of the Saison style."

"O/D - Second beer I have tried from Hill Farmstead and the second one that I would drink again. I am not a seasoned Saison connoisseur, but this is nice and light, yet spicy and full of flavor. I wish it were easier to get!"
"Overall nice, great flavors, right on for saison, nice hops that come late, dry finish, good carb, nice farmhouse flavors, very light spices, and a nice lemony citrus flavor."

"The palate opens crisp with a firm hop bite, with earth, lemon, orange peel and a mild resin character. Bitterness is moderate, and allows the malt and yeast flavors to come through. Moderate grass and pilsner malt along with a grainy flavor, the malt character is mellow and refined. The yeast mostly adds flavors of clove and phenols, especially on the finish. Drying on the finish with a crisp, clean, hoppy bitterness and the aforementioned flavors, this tastes very good. I'm not picking up much of the fruit or honey character that I got on the nose, though. The mouthfeel is surprising. Both, the body (light) and carbonation (medium-high) are spot on, but there's a mild wateriness on the mid-palate that's a little disappointing. Apart from that, this is an excellent saison, one I'm glad to have gotten the chance to enjoy."
"Quite a nice beer. To be honest I expected more but this is a very enjoyable beer that fits all the criteria to be a very solid saison."
"I'm a big fan of Hill Farmstead saisons. This is really great as a basic no frills version."
"4.0 D: Solid, no frills saison. Plenty of earth and herb with good complexity in the taste."
"Very refreshing and nicely balanced."
"O: Good for the style"
"Overall, a really enjoyable and easy to drink saison. A really sloid example of the style and another really good brew from Hill Farmstead. I would definitely get this again."
"O - Yet another excellent saison from Shaun and Dan. Not my favorite...I'm more of an Anna lover...but still very enjoyable. I'll revisit in a couple of months and see how it tastes...already looking forward to it! Recommend!"
"The beer is hazy and yellow hued with a thick, white head that leaves ample lacing on the snifter. The aroma brings floral, citrus, malt, yeast. The flavor is decent. Overly yeasty, with some fruit notes, perhaps apricots. The feel is very dry, with lingering yeast. Overall, a decent saison that could stand a few improvements."
"A very light and crisp saison. No skunky hops here (see ya, Dupont!). All about refreshing after a long, hot day's work. Cheers Shaun and crew!"
"D - Arthur is a fantastic Saison with plenty of herbal hop bite, a pleasant lemony character and nice dose of tartness. Keep racking up the great beers, Shaun!"
"Then Chowdahead tells me this has been in the growler for a week and a half. Say what cupcake?! Tasted like it was filled that day. I am once again very impressed by Hill Farmstead. Seeking more. Cheers!"
"had it again in bottle about 6 months later. as it ages the lemon grassy qualities becomes a bit more pronounced. not my favorite saison by them but as particular as that sounds still as american saison stable. that only one i could say is ranging in similarities with the saison dupont."
"A good saison, but not great. Drinks much larger than the 5% ABV and could use a little more crispness and/or earthy funk."
"HV"
"D - Good not great. I liked it but I prefer my saison's to be a little cleaner and funkier. I just don't seem to like these bready saison's very much I guess."
"Drinkability: I enjoyed this beer. I preferred the Citra to this, but this was a very enjoyable saison and I'm continually impressed by Hill Farmstead."
"Arthur came out looking like a saison, golden straw colored in appearance with a bright white head up above leaving nice patterns. Smell is a semi-big Belgian yeast profile with earthy grass ridden hops. Some citrus and spice. They work together well, nothing too overpowering the other. My first Saison from the farm is a good one. Arthur starts with the earth, the grass, the yeast (bread), semi tropical fruits very muted but noted with pear slices. It's a simple saison with a american twist that's not to outragous or out there. Good for a whirl. Feel is kinda lower than medium, with a small carb bite as well, a yeasty aftertaste with some bitter hops at the end. I could probably drink more of this stuff. Another good one from the boys at the farm."
"Chewy medium body with a lot of bready yeast which contributes to the moutfeel. There is also a lot of zesty peppery spice up front with more coriander and lemon zest. Hints of sweet citrus and crisp light fuir, especially orange peel, apple and pear. Not a bery high ABV but the alcohol presence is still felt. A bit overly spicy and hit but the nice mouthfeel helps the drinkability."
"There's plenty of complexity here, but the flavors don't seem entirely harmonious to me. I'm also not crazy about the yeast, which brings too much cloying bubblegum flavor."
"D- good saison for sure. Simple and clean. I'm liking this brewery."
"Tart, citrusy aroma with trademark saison yeast and spice. Pours a light golden color with a nice, fluffy head that laces well and sticks around for a while. Light, refreshing flavor with citrus and hops in excellent balance. Nice dry finish and just a touch of hops."
"Really good saison - best of this style I've had from Hill Farmstead so far. Goes down very easy."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: So sessionable but this sample is past peak."
"More high quality and well worth seeking out brew from Hill Farmstead."
"D: This beer was above average. It is immensely drinkable at 5%."
"Interesting take on a saison. Delicious. Goes well with a grain-fed beef burger from the Farmhose tap and grill."
"The taste is nice and fruity with a bit of yeast character. Really nice feel with a light body and excellent carbonation. Really nice and sessionable. I had heard about all of HF's excellent hoppy beers and read about Fear & Trembling, but I had no idea on this and it was a really pleasant surprise."
"Taste is very fresh and fruity, also get that apricot taste here (seeing a theme?). Mouthfeel is nice and full, creamy and rich. Light carbonation is perfect for the style. This is one of the best saisons I've ever had, no idea how Shaun does it but keep it up!"
