"It's a very good beer."
""
""
""
"12 ouncer poured into a mid mouthed goblet.  Light yellow and cloudy in color- reminded me of carbonated lemon juice.  1 finger head that faded quickly with minimal lacing.  The smell was lemon citrus with a hint of pepper that carried over to the taste.  Nice mouthfeel, tiny bubbles that danced down the tongue.  This was my first Farmhouse ale.  I wasn't overly wowed by the flavors but I could see myself enjoying the refreshing Ms. Sofie on the patio during a summer afternoon."

"Cloudy, golden coloring.  Smells of minerals and sweetness.  It is very smooth with noticeable carbonation and some citrus hints.  I liked it overall."
"Very good! Easy to drink, a bit sour with strong citrus (mainly orange) flavors, but mostly mild in taste."
""
"I look forward to setting up a vertical, as I have heard Sofie really hits its stride about three years of conditioning."

"This stuff is sofie king good."

"I wanted to like this... but really didn't care for it.  Now I can cross this off my list for good."
""
"Pours a bright gold. The smell of pepper is apparent right away. Spicy at first but finishes with a smooth and vanilla flavor. Feels refreshing and an overall great tasting beer."

"I would buy this again if I were going out to a friends house for lunch, or maybe out to a picnic. It would pair excellently with chicken or a salad. Very refreshing."
""
"This is like a Blue Moon on crack. Awesome! Great beer during the summer for a cook- out and served out of their bomber or 4-pack 12-oz bottles. Distributed by Goose, it is distributed to the masses all year... makes it easy to get your hands on when you want it (except the 4-packs get a little rare during the fall/winter). A super go- to for all types of tastes and preferences."

"Exceptionally tart and crisp; a bright and excellent example of a farmhouse ale"
"O: Not a bad saison. A bit too fruity for me."
""
""
""
""
"Great body, nice example of the farmhouse style"
"Cloudy and light froth. Good rendition of style. A bit more bread/yeast flavor would be nice but that's personal preference. Lasting spice on the pallette. Amazing no see of citrus."

"Light and refreshing. Could be more bitter but the finish is smooth and upfront it has some bite. I recommend buying a few and putting one away for a year or 2. I just open a January 2013 and it's smoother and orange-citrusy notes really come through over time."
"Bottle date of 2/13/2014.  Sampled on 8/16/2014, when bottle was 6 months old."

"This is a great introductory beer for the white wine drinker."
""
""
"I loved Matilda so I thought that by all the great reviews that I'd love Sofie since I love me some Belgian style beers. I was very confused by this beer. I poured it into a glass and the beer looked incredibly light looking, I tasted the beer and it tasted incredibly light (like watered down), and thus I was disappointed. I bought a 4 pack so I'll definitely be drinking it all but I'm not a fan of this one. Their beer called Matilda on the other hand was awesome. I'm not sure if they encourage aging this beer but that's what I'll be doing since as it is, it just isn't special. Maybe with time it gets better? idk."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Others mention the wine influence but I don't drink wine so I don't pick any of that up. Very good saison, looking forward to the other 3 bottles from this 4-pack."
"Too much like a chardonnay for my taste. I'm not a huge fan of Belgian yeast, nor the compliment it provides to any measure of citrus character. Faint, and I mean very faint, hints of vanilla hit the very back end of the tongue. It looks really nice in the glass, but beyond that, not something I'll be seeking out again. Sorry for the one night stand, Sofie!"
""
""
"Not a big fan, this beer looked better then it tasted."
"Was told it was a sour. I'm not a big fan of wheat beers... it's a wheat beer."
""
""
""
"A slightly complicated beer, but worth trying."
""
""
"Favorite beer by far as is 1/16/2015, can't find it yet here in Maine, but I know a few distributors that can order it for me."
""
""
""
"Crisp and clean, but still watered down taste."
""
""
""
""
""
"As a dark beer fan, I didn't know how I would feel about this, but it really did deliver.  Right off the bat you get the citrus aroma and the beautiful bubbly head.  On first taste, you immediately detect the wine notes, which are beautifully balanced in the mix.  I really loved this beer, and I don't love a lot of lighter beers."
""
"The Chardonnay influence is undeniable, both in flavor and mouthfeel. These particle characteristics, the wood aspect and the slightly slick mouthfeel, become more apparent as the beer warms up from fridge temperature. I did not experience the visible carbonation levels that have been reported in other reviews. Saison yeast aromas up front, you get the grassiness and some lemon scent along with a hint of white pepper that I found appealing. Somewhat hard to nail down exactly what is going on with this beer, but it's worth trying for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a good beer.  I am usually a fan of darker beers, but still enjoyed the Sofie.  I enjoyed he citrus notes and the zest and the hint of chardonnay."
""
""
"A very interesting and balanced beer. A little more carbonation, and some fresh character (herbs or more late addition hops?), could make it world class. But, as it stands, it's a good American attempt at a Saison."

"O. If enjoy saisons with a little funk this is really good.  A very unique beer.  More enjoyable as it warms."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  Solid."
""
""
""
""
"Not a bad beer, but it I definitely prefer Matilda over this. I was hoping for a big vinous, tart, and bitter beer, but this was mostly just like a tripel with light funk. Maybe it needs more/less time?"
"Overall: Never was a fan of sour beers and something into this, I was quite surprised at the level. However, as the beer leaves cold temperature and enters room temperature, it does reveal some more flavors of orange and woodgrains. Not my favorite brew. I would stick with Hennepin by Ommegang or Saison-Brett by Boulevard. I may recommend to a few friends, but I definitely won't be trying again. Cheers!"
"Overall: It almost has a fake or manufactured flavor to it. I don't think it detracts from the overall flavor."
""
"amazing champainge like great body amazign taste"
""
"765 mL bottle, poured into a tulip glass. I paired this beer with Christmas brunch - ham, French toast, and Brie cheese. In short, this is an amazing beer. It looks great in the glass and the flavours are incredible. Subtle fruits, delicate pepper, and a dry clean finish. This is easily the lightest tasting Farmhouse Ale I've enjoyed, in the best possible way!"

"2014 version poured into a tulip glass. Clear, gold in color with a fluffy white head that dissipates pretty quickly. Tons of orange in the aroma with a peppery spice. The flavor has a white wine quality to it that really defines this beer for me. Very tart in the finish with some of the spice lingering. Light to medium bodied, fizzy and effervescent. A really unique and tasty beer."
""
"Pours a beautifully pale golden yellow with a fluffy head that quickly dissipates. A plethora of tiny bubbles rise to the top of the glass. The beer smells of belgian spice and yeast, with some slight citrus. The taste is where the citrus tart and fruit comes out, complimenting the belgian yeast and spice character. Pears, green apples, and green grapes. The slightest hint of orange peel. Mildly tart dry aftertaste with a tiny bit of funk. Creamy and bubbly like a champagne. Immensely drinkable. A standout saison for my money."

"O: I feel as though this one is over hyped. It looks fancy and comes from Goose Island so I can understand why, also know that this is just my personal opinion.  Not quite as peppery as what I think a Saison should be, but it's pretty decent overall."

"2014 BOD 8/7/14.  Pours a clear light amber (golden, champagne).  Massive head volume, world class lacing and retention.  Light, but complex, nose of Belgian like yeast, sweet light fruit (pear, grape, apple) and just a hint of spice.  Light medium body with a nice smooth texture made a bit prickly from the above normal carbonation level.  Effervescence is evident throughout.  The flavor profile is quite nice.  Extremely complex, very well balanced but not overly intense, it allows all flavors of the nose to emerge.  It begins with the fruit, then develops a white wine like note in the middle coupled with a bit of dryness.  The finish is where the farmhouse character emerges with an ever so slight peppery funk that fades into a mild tart dryness.  Outstanding and an excellent entry choice for the Saison style."

"Pours hazy golden color with a thin carbonated head.  Head retention is minimal.  Lacing is mild.  Has that typical sour fruit, Belgian yeast, farmhouse funk aroma.   Very pleasing.  Belgian yeast taste, quickly followed by a spicy, clove/coriander taste.  Carbonation is high.  Nice farmhouse funky aftertaste.  Very good Farmhouse Ale.  Definitely one of the best."

"Poured from a wine bottle into a chalice. Frothy white head about 1-finger thick settles into a nice white blanket of foam. The color is a cross between champagne and cider, with a clear effervescence and a white grape color with and orange tint around the edges. Strong orange peel and white pepper aromas with some coriander and lemon zest thrown in. A bit yeasty and bready with a brut note or two on the nose as well. Flavors of bright citrus and spice, like candied orange peels. The up-front bubbles complements the tartly dry flavors and the beer finishes crisp and sweet with a bit of a tart aftertaste. Notes of cloves, allspice, coriander, pepper, oranges, bread, and green grapes round out the flavors. The feel is marked by bubbly effervescence that is truly aggressive, but in a pleasant way. Much more of a champagne feel than beer woth a bit more juicy tartness on he swallow. Overall this is a killer take on a farmhouse ale, going all-in on the flavor and feel notes that make the farmhouse ale so different from other Belgian styles. Nice work!"

"Golden, clear and sparkling... whitish haze of head with tiny bubbles.Delicate aromas with hints of spice/funk, delicious pineapple and citrus, and some mild breadiness. Clean pineapple notes in the taste, funk city... just a hint of alcohol. Smooth, almost like a bubbly white wine. Nice, funky aftertaste. Haven't been disappointed by a GI lady yet!"

"Overall: I can see how others would see this as being a delectable, masterpiece of a beer. There's no denying that it's a delicious and lovely concoction. I'm personally not planning on seeking it out in the future, however, because I like my beer to taste like beer. Don't get me wrong--I'm more than aware of the incredibly wide variety of flavors beer can produce. This brew, however, felt like it was wearing TOO good of a champagne costume. I missed my old friend."

"O: 4.5 - Still a winner! I first had this in Chicago about 6 years ago. It's still just as good despite their big expansion."
""
""

"765 ml large format bottle poured into a tulip glass. Slightly cloudy lemon yellow brew with a gorgeous creamy white head that retains form well, some fizzy effervescence and yeast debris floating around. Pretty beer. Wonderful nose, too ... Shockingly tropical and vinous, loads of pineapple, white grape, pear, lemon, yellow grapefruit, Juicy Fruit gum, unripe gooseberry, and dry moderately funky horse blanket. Just a hint of fresh bread. Certainly a unique farmhouse ale on nose and palate. Very quenching, dry, and sour, but with enough pear and tropical fruit to provide some balance and keep this firmly anchored outside of Orval territory (although one is tempted to draw a few comparisons). Fresh pear and pineapple galore with echoes of coriander and orange peel. Nice easy-going but still assertive brettanomyces creates an earthy dry vibe that runs parallel to the fruit element. The sour note does develop as one sips. Body on the light side, fairly high carbonation. Finishes citric, mildly floral, and bone-dry. Any malt flavor is largely buried, but if you appreciate sours or Belgian beers more generally there is much to like here. I am appreciating the meld of sweet fruit, sour fruit, and dry Belgian funk, with no one component running the show."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Extremely clean and very well-balanced. After drinking my first glass, I read the back and discovered that 20% of this blend is aged in white wine barrels, which explains the beautiful white wine and pear notes mentioned earlier. What a great beer. Very impressive. This stands out in an over-saturated market of American craft beer, no doubt about it. I am rating this extra high for its precision and creative approach."

"Pale yellow-straw colour pour with foamy head. Can definitely taste the wine but it's just the right amount. Citrus. Orange. Slight hints of vanilla. Excellent carbonation, almost sparkling. Very, very nice beer."
""
"Orange, apple, lemon, pear flavors. Crisp, dry. Tasty stuff."
""
""
""
""
"Crisp clean flavor with light citrus background. Fine carbonation with a nice light head."
""
""
"Overall - An excellent Saison from Goose Island. For my first offering from these guys, this Saison is pleasantly light and citrusy. All the elements of the style blend cohesively and the notes of white wine add a nice complexity to this well executed brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- One of the best beers I have ever had."
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the better Belgian Style beers I have had, as there is a nice blend of spices without any one taking over the show.  Easy to drink - smooth with a bit of a spicy bite at the end lead by coriander but not overtaken by it.  A cloudy yellow color with a 1.5 finger head on the pour.  The head settles to a film on the top of the beer, but bubblies continue from the bottom throughout.  Although this is not my favorite style, I would revisit this beer."
""
""
""

"Light-bodied and bubbly, this is an interesting brew. A bit sweet, a bit sour/funky.  A white ale/saison mix with a champagne-like character to it."

"For a typically understated style, this possesses a whole lot of extra goodness, all of which does nothing to push things over the top, instead, everything stays right on track, even the elevated 13-proof booze. A crazily saucy and intricate saison, packaging included, from one of the last parts of the world one might expect, transnational corporation ownership aside."

"Good beer. Interested to see how this ages."
"This is one of various beers by Goose Island that seems to have taken a turn for the worse. Still a solid beer, but current releases are lacking the balance that I remember from previous years. Compared to Tank 7 or Saison-Brett by Boulevard or the impressive examples from Crooked Stave in Denver, this falls short of the mark. Still, a widely available and accessible Saison and a good introduction for those unfamiliar with the style."

"Price Point - $7.99/22 oz bottle"

"O: so good! And so worth it. Complex as hell and very 'delicate' if that's the word I'm looking for... sip this one and enjoy it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Delicious. Goose Island is one of my favorite breweries."
""
""
""
"Really enjoyed it. Great for small parties. The bottle itself is pretty elegant, and once you pour it in, it's great. High on citris flavors, but smooth going down. A great cloudy, yet crisp looking amber and goes down smooth. Perfect for a summer day. A bit on the expensive side, but if your looking to indulge, go for it."
"Overall: Stellar beer enjoyed a lot over the years and many more times in the future."

"This is quite enjoyable but the vinegar flavors are not well suited to my palate and make me score this lower."

"O: Reminds me a little bit last year's batch of apfelwein I made, except this is beer and doesn't have any apples! I can see someone who isn't big on heavy beers liking this. It's not offensive in any way, but I can't pick out any one feature of it that makes me want to go back for another bottle."

"Overall: A pleasant surprise as I don't recall enjoying this beer so much in the past. The stand out note for me was the brett and it's cheesy, ripe barnyard notes. As it warms the orange peel does come out a bit more and the yeast becomes more ""zesty"" and peppery. The wine barrel is not super prominent but then again it's only a 20% blend. Overall, given the availability of this, I'd recommended it when in need of a modestly priced brett/fruit forward saison."
""
"Don't usually fancy this type of offering, more of a stout guy.... However, this nails it. Great to enjoy in the summer. Light and crisp. I would pair this with chicken or fish. Was surprised by the fruity/citrus kick it has. A pleasant surprise. Well done, GI."

"This belgian saison pours a hazy orange straw color with a fizzy white head that lasts throughout the pour and leaves some lacing. The aroma is a funky refreshing blend of apricots, belgian yeast, lemon peel, and wine (reminded me of pinot grigio). The mouthfeel is light, refreshing, and effervescent; perfect for the style. The flavor follows the nose and reminds me much more of a carbonated white wine than an ale. This was very good. I want to try a fresh bottle now to see the difference."

"Poured from a corked 765 ml bottle into a Liefmans Goudenband glass (my preferred all purpose beer tasting glass)."
""
""
""
"OP: Not expecting much, pleasantly surprised. Almost to good to be true. A great price point for great beer. Hopefully their marketing campaign doesn't involve selling beer at such a low price until it catches on. I'm totally OK with paying $8.99 at the ""Whole Foods"" grocer for this. In fact, I'm going to grab a couple more of these before they run out."

"O: a very nicely done saison with subtle flavors complementary to the style"

"Taste: Spicy, citrus and somewhat sweet flavors all compliment each other just right so one is not overpowering."

""
"Pours the color of golden straw with a bubbly white head. Loads of carbonation, as the bubbles just keep coming. The smell may be my favorite thing about this beer. Yeast, grape, a bit of wood and brett. Light mouth with a crisp fizz. At first taste, I wasn’t terribly impressed. But as it warms - and I mean really warms - the flavor really pops."

"I'm cheating on my wife with SOFIE! Wow. Great beer. Everything I love in a beer even though it's more a Farmhouse Ale than a Wit/Hef/Belgium where my preferences are centered. I've had both the large format and 12 oz (4 pack). I'm biased towards the large format bottle but that's probably because of the outcome of finishing it vs a small 12 oz! ;-)"

"O - The effect of aging with citrus peel was much more apparent than the influence of the wine barrels. Not as sour or funky as I'd expected, but this is not Sofie's fault. Multi-faceted; lots of depth to explore here. Too much bitter citrus peel for my liking but I can still give this beer respect."

"served from a bottle into a wine goblet. pours a a very effervescent glear sparkling cider color. egshell white head that quickly dissapates. the smell is pure apples and citrus with some clove and yeast funk. the tastes is just what the nose percieves. nice crisp green apple and a hint of the orange peel. delicious light clove and a hint of the wine barrel comes through. carbonation out the wazoo. washes the pallet and leaves a semi dry aftertaste. overall a great take on the style. goose island keeps doing the damn thing...cheers!"

"Final Grade: 4.39, an A grade. I enjoyed Sofie quite a bit the first time I tried it, but this time around it is really blowing me away. While I've never been a big wine drinker, I have a soft spot for both Belgian blonde ales and certain white wines, so this brew is scratching all of the right itches for me. This is a top shelf beer and it is priced accordingly, but you will get what you pay for. Although it is not a traditional saison, I'd rank this up there with some of my favourite Belgian examples, including Dupont."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I think this is a nice saison. While it is not my favorite style, I can appreciate this beer. This is my second time having this beer, and this bottle has a bit more age on it. I can say that I did find it more flavorful and enjoyable the second time."
"Dry finish with vanilla and oak flavors."

"2012 sofie. incredible. has a bit of a champagne like mouthfeel and refreshing. drank one on new years and its a great beer. lov goose island beer they make a good product whichever you pull off the shelf.

"It feels, tastes, and looks like a citrus champagne. Drink it in a champagne glass if you don't mind your friends making fun of you. I tried it in both a tall glass and a champagne glass, and the champagne glass made a big difference. I'm going to open some to celebrate New Year's Eve."

"Goose Island, for all intensive purposes, is a macro brewery, yet this beer is not only up to par with other highly rated micro saisons and farmhouse ales that I have sampled, but it completely destroys them! I was never a huge fan of this genre, yet this this is the first beer that I have given a perfect rating! Perfect golden color, great head and lacing, aroma and flavor that are unparallelled in this genre, and incredibly smooth! I usually do not like to spend a lot of money on recreation, but this is the exception to the rule. Perfect for special occasions, and I really don't feel like the caviar eating snobs can talk crap about this one."

"Sofie pours a cloudy golden color with a very large frothy white head. There is a pepper and yeast like aroma with strong hints of orange. The taste has a strong biscuit and yeasty undertone, with strong hints of vanilla and orange. Good body, good strong flavors. Overall a very enjoyable, bold and flavorful saison."
""
""
"This pours a light golden yellow with a cap of white cotton. The foam lingers around for a visit. There’s a light floral aroma reminding me of clover honey and orange blossom. The flavor has a touch of orange peel with pepper and coriander spicing things up. It’s lightly delicate, perhaps a touch overly floral for my expectations, but overall delicious."

"12 oz bottle. Pours brilliant golden with short-lived white head and lively carbonation. Aroma is of funky yeast, biscuit malt, pears, apples and herbal hops. Body is full and crisp. Taste is of funky yeast, spices, peppery hops, biscuit malt and ripe fruit. Finish is long and spicy. Overall it is nice brew."

"Served on tap. Pours a slightly cloudy orange with lots of head and great retention. The nose features some saisony farmhouse yeast up front with some light tartness. The gentle hops come through along with some fruity notes. The taste features orange and lemon along with hints of black pepper. There is a light flash of tartness towards the end paired with a bit of spice. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing. Overall, this is a pretty straight forward and relatively tame saison. Nothing bad about it, just nothing too exciting."

"Had on tap at Jake's Billiards.Poured into a goblet a slight hazed lemon/strw color with a bone white head.Aromas are yeasty but not overly phenolic with a burst of citrusy lemon.Flavors of light spiced phenols and mild dough,lemon brings bright and even sharpness in the finish.The phenols are kept in check pretty well and the citrus flavors are nice if a bit sharp in the finish,not bad."
""
""
"O: One of the most colorful saisons I've ever had. Unapologetic in its tartness and spiciness, while still being extremely enjoyable and refreshing so long as your character is enough to match its. I would gladly pay the premium for one of these after cutting the grass under the sun, or after doing nothing at all."

"Enjoyable beer. On reflection I would like it drier and lower ABV (~5%) would do nicely for my palate. Interesting to try an American-made Belgian but this one's a little sweeter than it needs to be."

Taste: semisweet pale malts, lemon, vinous, fairly acidic, sweet orange and vanilla notes. Starts a bit slick then carbonation really kicks in. Good, not great."

"An impressive Saison, I would like to get another bottle to see how it ages, the white wine barrels seemed to really have a big impact at this stage, a light and flavourful ale, it had a lot of good characteristics, rounded citrus and florals, some tartness, little bitterness, and a dry and crisp acidity.

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled 7/8/2010. Slow gusher upon opening. Pours hazy golden amber color with a nice 3 finger foamy and rocky white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice foamy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of tart lemon, apple, pear, pepper, orange peel, pineapple, wheat, hay, floral, grass, clove, funk, and earthy yeast spiciness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity and balance of fruity and spicy yeast notes; with great strength. Taste of tart lemon, apple, pear, clove, pepper, orange peel, wheat, hay, grass, funk, and spicy yeast earthiness. Moderate earthy tartness/spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart light fruits, citrus peel, pepper, clove, hay, grass, wheat, light funk, and earthy yeast spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast notes; with a great malt/spiciness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. High carbonation and medium bodied; with a very crisp, foamy, and moderately prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic wild yeast saison! Outstanding complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and orange peel flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering; and one of my favorite easily available wild saisons."

"Overall I thought was pretty damn good beer and a very good example of a Farmhouse Ale, the brett was pretty apparent in the aroma, but when it came to the taste it showed up just enough and it helped intensify those great citrus flavors that I really enjoyed. This beer had pretty good drinkability, It wouldn't be hard for me to a drink a few of these and I could see them going pretty fast on a warm summer day, it was smooth, clean, not filling, and the flavors did a really nice job at holding my attention. What I liked the most about this beer was the how true to the style it was, it had all the aspects that I look for in a very good Farmhouse Ale. What I liked the least about this beer was the aroma, it wasn't bad, but it had me prepared for a Brett bomb like Matilda was, but it was a different story when I got to the taste. I would for sure buy this beer again and I would like to have a couple more bottles of this Vintage to see how it changes over time, I also wouldn't mind trying a fresh one for comparison. It was priced nicely also. I would recommend this to anyone who's a fan of Farmhouse ales. All in all I was pretty impressed with this beer, when I got to the aroma I started to doubt this beer, but the taste was pretty much a different story and I can't remember the last time that I had a beer that the aroma was so different from the taste like this beer was. Great job guys, I really like this Belgian Series and it's the only beers from Goose Island that I go out of my way to look for and this might just be the best one in the series so far. Great job guys, I think goose island is doing great things with these Belgian style beers, and I can't seem to get enough of them."

""

"O: Everything about this beer is ""light"". No single characteristic pops out and the farmhouse aspects are not in your face. It's very balanced and enjoyable and could get just about anyone into the style or better beer in general, in my opinion."
"Big winner for domestic version of the style. Flavor and look and aroma all are great."

"Not the first time I have had this beer but the first time I have really sat down and thought about it. The aroma and flavor difference is striking compared to almost any beer I can think of. Both elements lend interesting flavors blended well. It is easy to hate on Goose Island but if given in a blind taste test this would stand up to most American-made Saisons. To me the aroma is just a bit more interesting than the flavor but all-around a well made brew."

"O-An enjoyable saison that utilizes wine barrel aging. Though I do like this beer I felt like the wine barrels in the bottled version kind of overtook the overall classic characteristics of what you look for in a saison. Have had this on draft before and thought it was better in the taste and mouthfeel fields. Pick up and enjoy and this will be a beer that I will enjoy trying and drinking again..."

"UPDATE 10/1/13 I didn't like this on first try but on second try after a couple of months went by during which I putting a few other farmhouse/saisons under my belt, it's far less objectionably sour. I understand the style better and am learning to enjoy it more as a worthwhile occasional change of pace from my malty or hoppy favorites."

"O: An excellent example of a farmhouse ale. Nice nose and a great flavor and very easy drinking."
"The big aroma is the belle of the ball. Each sip is a double hit ... funky aroma and tart taste. Very complex and very enjoyable."
"While I took a sip, it once again gave a lemony flavor. Very nice and refreshing. In no time, it started to transition from lemony to a bready flavor. Did not taste much of the peppery or subtle spicness that I get from other Saisons. Not sure if I picked up any orange peel (as the beer said it has in 20% of the belgian ale mixed in), maybe it contributes to the lemony flavor. Overall the flavor profile was nice, very easy drinking. It had a light bodied mouthfeel. I like it, will drink again but hope to try it on tap."

"Hazy light blonde colour with nearly 2 fingers of white head, decent lace as well. Smell is lightly funky with some tart apple, lemon and light oak witha subtle vanilla, orange-citrus with some vinious notes and yeast. Taste is fruity, lots of apple, orange and some tart lemon, light acidity with som wine and oak, yeasty with a citrusy aftertaste. Medium carbonation, medium body, nice crisp refreshing quality. A great beer throughout, very nice on the nose, quite drinkable."

"Pours hazy, straw yellow with plenty of effervescence. Head was pure white and fell off to some pleasant lacing. Nose is big with lemon, grass and funk. It offers up a little spice, a little sour and some florals. As it warms it gives some cracker, some medicinal alcohol and clove. Grainy with a touch of sweetness. Taste follows the nose all the way and pucker up because its tart. Flavors all come together, lemony citrus, bread, yeast,a little pepper. Taste doesn’t quite live up to the nose but it’s close. Sharp on the tongue at first but you get used to it . Sweet, tangy, finishes earthy, crisp and slightly bitter. This was tremendously flavorfull and off dry. Very well done."

"It pours a hazy straw yellow with a fluffy white head that slowly fades to a ring around the glass. The aroma is mostly lemon and citrus with some orange notes, It is not as spicy or yeasty as most saisons I've had in the past. The flavor is also more citrusy then I was expecting. Slightly wine like acidity with a yeasty finish. The mouthfeel is medium with high carbonation and a dry finish. The body for me was a little to full for the style and I felt it was not carbonated enough. Overall I liked it, I didn't want to but I enjoyed it."
"The whole affair exudes quality and craftsmanship, which is not surprising considering the pedigree. I don't think I've had a Belgian style ale from Goose Island I haven't enjoyed, and this is no exception. If I had to find a fault, it's that the spiciness can become a little cloying over time, but this is a minor grievance. Otherwise, this is a crisp, complex, flavorful saison that represents the style ably."

""
""
"Had a 2012 bottle. Clearish, seethrough pale gold with fluffy head that borders on annoying but it died just quick enough. A clovelike yeasty aroma first hits me, then some more peppery spice and citric notes, mostly orangepeel, along with something akin to sour apple or pear (a touch of funk one might say). This beer is light, easy to drink although at times there is this puckering tartness that doesn't detract from the beer but makes it a very slow sipper. For some reason the not-real-word ""wineish"" comes up as I seem to get this sour apple/pear and white grape taste, then the Belgian charteristics come out with a spicy orange citric taste and touches of sweet fruit. The yeast keeps it smooth and the carbonation keeps it lively and it's an all around relaxing ale to sip on, but one of those rare beers that I simply would not want a second bottle."

"O- really a wonderful example of a delicate farmhouse ale. Well rounded and extremely food friendly"
""
"a little over hyped I think, at least the 2013 version is, possibly a considerable step down from other vintages. this pours from its new wine bottle format a hazy champagne color, pale and yellow, grassy, with just a small white head. the nose is fruity like apples, not as coriander heavy as I remember it being, and yeasty. a little tart and funky, but not as exciting to my palate as I think it used to be. I taste green apples too, tart and sweet at the same time, although this beer adds a dry element to that flavor. wine-like fruity vibes, and a similar acidity. I view this so much more as a fall beer, rather than a spring one. its got all the leaf changing colors feel to it. really mellow on the citrus, and I don't get any vanilla at all. ultra bright carbonation and a clean dry finish. light bodied and drinkable, but I wonder if the sale of goose island has effected the recipe or the quality of this beer. I remember it being so wonderful and interesting, and now it just seemed like another half hearted saison. maybe its me, and ive had too many good beers to recognize that this one is special, but it seems somehow dumbed down to me now."

""
""

"First brew from Goose Island to come to Ontario, and it's a thumping good'un. Top class saison, one I will be back for a few times before it's gone."

""
""
""
""
""
""

"The alcohol was spot-on too and I liked the buzz that I picked up as I made my way through this. Like the Ommegang beers, this easily matched up and may have even surpassed its counterparts from overseas while coating my mouth in the softest and slickest citrus aftermath in its wake. Somehow, everything fit in harmoniously here and this is a beer that I will be buying again, now that Spring has finally sprung. Worth a go if you love beers that are beautiful in their subtlety while pushing the edge of what's possible at the same time!"

"O - An American classic interpretation of the Saison. Different from any I've tasted, in a very good way. Different American interpretation of the style than Hennepin, both are great in their own way. WIll seek out from now on."
""
""

"Overall - Really good brew. Lovely balance and well brewed."
"O: I like it. I find myself enjoying this in a 'pretty good' kind of way."
""
""
""
""

"A decent saison and interesting interpretation of the style. I might buy this beer again sometime in future but probably to shake things up and not as a regular staple."

"overall, it's a decent try at the style. i read a lot of good reviews of Goose Island brews and this is my first one. i wonder what else they brew?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: While this beer is certainly complex in it's subtle nuances, the mouthfeel and low carbonation really detract from the beer's overall texture. The beer just sort of sits on your palate instead of being lifted up by carbonation. I wish this beer had a more assertive citric presence to liven up the palate a bit. I'm pretty disappointed by this beer because I have heard great things about it."
""
""
""
"O- Great beer, very complex yet simple and quenching."
""
""
""
"O: Tartness is refreshing for this beer and the smell and taste come off fresh and complex. Definitely worth a try!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a light whitish-yellow, hazy, with bubbles rising to the surface and a nice soapy white head. Aroma offers some funk, florals,lemon and its rind, slight cracker, and as it warms the wine barrel comes out. Flavor follows suit and is juicy, somewhat sweet, and slightly tart. Mouthfeel is light and fluffy and supercarbonated. Overall, a fantastic saison. So light and refreshing and highly drinkable, stuff is dangerous."

""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Slight tartness on the palate, leading to a dry finish. Some light citrus character amidst a light malt body. Cracker-like grain profile. The 6.5% ABV does not intrude at all, and the fine carbonation, though a bit too harsh, pairs with the flavor profile to create a refreshing saison that won't knock you out. A light, dry saison that's at its best during the warm summer months."
"I think this would make for a very good choice in the summer or fall."
""
""
"D: This was a very nice light Belgian ale. The scent was very dry and crisp, and the taste was well balanced. The body was appropriate and built to age. The finish was really smooth, so it was quite easy to drink fresh, but seemed intended to improve further with age. Solid brew."
""

"This is a light bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is a nice offering overall with that partial barrel aging part of the blend being a nice subtle addition to an otherwise ordinary saison. If some of the sulfites could be removed, this brew would be a real winner."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: this is a very good beer indeed. I think it could do a bit more to live up to its aroma, but in general this beer pleases me and just rubs me the right way. Great stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I like this beer, I don't get any wine or barrel character out of this, althought if I seek it out maybe a bit of white wine grapiness comes out. Very drinkable and complex at the same time."
"O: An enjoyable and complex beer that has some saison qualities, Sofie is a treat."
""
""
"If you see them, I'd recommend the 4 pack. If I had more than one, I would've cellared a few and enjoyed one fresh. A real treat from Goose Island."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours light gold with a solid quilt of bone white foam. Smells good, really good. Fruit, maybe honeydew, some peach, wheat, leaves, yeast cake, co2, bits of lemon and funk. I like the nose here. Taste is clean, slightly tart, some grain and corn, a bit of bitterness, some clay, and funk. Medium bodied with prickly, but low carb and an off dry finish. Nice beer, wonder how it develops."
""
""
""
""
"Awfully good, I'd not know it wasn't a Belgium had I not read the label. I can't think of anything that needs to be changed. Looking forward to cellaring 2 or 3 of the remaining bottles."

"Pours light yellow with medium sized but quickly receding head. Smells sour with hints of orange and lemon peel. Spicy funky belgian yeast aroma to go along. Nice Belgian funk flavor with a bit of citrus, lemon peel, very very light grapefruits. Slight effervescence and light mouthfeel. Easy drinker that could go down all day."
""
"In the end, Raul says aiiiite. But 'aite' don't win marathons."
"Overall- An interesting flavored refreshing saison."
""
""
""
"O: Excellent Brew – Goose Island never really disappoints. I wound up drinking two of these they were so good."
""
""
""
""
""
"Light to medium bodied, with average carbonation. Finishes dry, with a lemon aftertaste. A nice Saison, worth having again."
""
""
"The taste has a very agitated, carbonated sparkling flavor like champagne with a sharp hop bite at the end. Others call this one exceptional. I cannot do that. Perhaps I had a bad bottle."
""
""
"Price was okay, but not great. $10/4"
"Not your usual saison here. With its tartness, is a great alternative to those super funk-ridden saisons."
""
"Overall really a nice beer. Great starter saison."

"O. A tasty very drinkable beer which as it warmed a little in my glass began to finish with more spice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"DELECTABLE; GRAB A BOTTLE!"
""
""
""
"O: I've waited to try this beer for a while and its quite good. Very drinkable and smells very good. Floralness was just right, not overpowering like Matilda. I'm enjoying this, will buy again in the future and hopefully persuade some non Belgian drinkers into liking Belgians or at least spark their curiosity by letting them know that they are missing out on a lot of good beer."
"O- I don't know if it's because it's five months old or what, but this is not what I expected it to be. There are much better examples of the style out there, for sure."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is a good brew overall. I think I will stick with the more traditional saison/farmhouse styles, but this is a very unique taste out of the style. I would certainly recommend it, it is nice and light but still has a good flavor."
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a really refreshing beer. Very nice take on the style. Really light and smooth and it tastes great. you should buy it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: this is a pretty tasty and well rounded beer, not too much yeast, but just enough, which is nice... Enjoyed this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"Golden yellow color with an airy, white head on top. Super fresh and pleasant aroma...flowery, peppery yeast with juicy pineapple, champagne, and citrus peel. Bold, juicy flavors of yeast, pineapple, fruit, with a sweet, somewhat creamy finish. Not much noticeable funk, which is fine. Medium bodied, effervescent, a little slick, but mostly crisp and refreshing. I enjoyed this very much! This would make a fine New Years Eve beverage..."
""
""

"Overall – This was a nice easy drinking Belgian saison with a nice blend of sour/bitter/funk/malt One to try if you get a chance."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - the overcarbonation and chamomile really got to me in a bad way. I didn't necessarily dislike this beer but it wasn't as good as I expected. I appreciate the idea of the beer but didn't deliver for me."
"Overall a very solid enjoyable beer, but missing the good blast of sourness/funk that characterizes the top Saisons."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-a solid farmhouse ale"
""
""
""
""
"O- Very good saison that has some slight sour-like qualities. Very good fruit flavors come through with good drinkability."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not many american brewers dare to tread into the funky belgian territory let alone pull it off with such authentic nature. This one is dead on, funky, clean and crisp, close your eyes and your in Belgium."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A very drinkable Saison, but I prefer my Saison's more funkier. Very light, easy to drink."
""
""
""
"O: decent brew, and it has very high drinkability. this one would be excellent in the summer at a BBQ. I think that it is a touch too light for my liking and would love a bit more funkiness to it."
"O - Will buy again in the future and would certainly recommend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Personally : 4"
""
""
""
""
"O: A great brew, very refreshing and light, great tasting and well balanced all around."
""
""
"O - Excellent saison. only knock might be the high carbonation. your tummy does start to move after about half the beer is down."
""
"Overall: Very good beer overall. I would recommend giving this one a try. I'd like to try it fresh to compare. Now that Goose Island is distributing to Florida, I hope Sofie makes the trip down here along with their regular offerings."
"O: Not a bad saison, but the taste isn't as rich and complex as other Belgian ales, and the aroma has that unpleasant off character that detracts from the overall beer. Not one I'd get again despite its good points."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall. A very nice, delicate, light, and refreshing beer. I loved the unsweetened orange taste. Doesn't taste like it's from the USA, and that's a good thing for the style. This one went fast!"
""
""
"This is an outstanding beer."
"Overalls - spritely; delightful; zesty; refreshing; refined finish; Sofie is both playful and elegant, pay close attention to each sip and enjoy this polarizing brew"
""
""
""
"Overall, a unique brew. Complex in character and fun to taste and evaluate. Crisp, refreshing, and delicious. Try it, I feel like everyone will have a different interpretation of this brew!"
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a great beer up there with some of the better Brett beers I have had and among the best saisons as well."
""
""
"Overall (4.5): Lovely. So light and pretty and floral and lovely. This is an excellent saison, not perfect or 100% true to style in terms of feel and appearance and some flavor characteristics, but just so nice and refreshing. If you offered me five random saisons to pick from, chances are this would be my choice four out of five times, at least. Definitely worth the pricetag, too. Wonderful beer, absolutely will seek out in the future."

"Overall: It was merely okay. Just barely so-so. I had rather expected this one to please with ease. Time to fire up the Smokey Robinson song, ""Tears of a Clown."""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O – I will not be getting this again, of course, even if it is available as a single. I literally cannot believe they charge so much for a four pack of this stuff. Luckily, I bought a four pack of Leviathan DIPA with my mix-and-match, so the night wasn’t a total loss."
""
""
"O- Absolutely amazing beer. I'd love to sit down and have a few more, but at $18 for a 4-pack at my local beer store I had to spring for just a single bottle. Definitely the kind of beer I was looking for, and one of the drier Saisons I've had. I would have liked to see a higher ABV to try and get a little bit of booziness and malt sweetness to really make the buttery note shine, but at 6.5% Sofie does a fine job. Might give aging one of these a try."
""
""
""
"2012 bottle direct from the brewery. Pours yellow , smells like pepper, taste is not my cup of tea. Gross, too bubbly, nasty aftertaste. Drain pour. Bottle. Head is initially small, fizzy/frothy, white, mostly diminishing. Body is medium yellow, bottle conditioned. Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain), lightly hoppy (herbs, flowers), lightly yeasty (basement, cement), with notes of gum/banana, lemon candy, and pepper. Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter. Medium body, watery/syrupy texture, lively carbonation, lightly alcoholic. Overly sweet. The nose portends this, being very gummy/banana-ish and sugary. Not very enjoyable, not good."
""
""
"Morey's Bottom Line: A great beer. One of my favorite Saisons without a doubt. The bottle states that you can age this beer up to 5 years, but I might never know how it ages because I can't stop drinking mine!"
""
"Overall: This is an excellent beer, thought saison/farmhouse style is not noted on the bottle, it is very much evident. While no one area (appearance, smell) stood out as uniquely outstanding, the overall experience was excellent and this is a beer I'd have again and recommend."
""
"O-I enjoyed this, but felt there was something just a little off. Perhaps it needed more carbonation to balance the heavy lemon flavors that almost overwhelmed me. Still, it was refreshing and I'd give it another shot."
""
"I prefer the related biere de garde style, which I always considered to be a hoppier, less spicy/fussy variant of this general idea. But if you like saisons you should definitely give this a try, it's a very respectable American take on the style."
""
""
"O. Best American version of a Saison I've had so far. Highly drinkaable. Charming and seductive, you will be amused by it's naive presumption."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- really happy to finally try this one. I do think there are Saison's I prefer, but it's an excellent example of the style, and certainly a must-try."
"A really nice beer on a very warm night, refreshing and crisp."

"Pours a hazy yellow with a foamy white head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Thick foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, wine, and wood. Taste is much the same with a slight funk in the flavor as well. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a very crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."

"M - Light body, clightly creamy. Moderate carbonation."

""

""
""
""

""

""

""
""
"This poured out as a slightly hazy golden color, it had a foamy white head on top that faded into a thin film over top of the beer. The smell of the beer is a grainy and has plenty of the citrus fruit aromas on the nose. The taste of the beer is a little spicy with a fruity kick to it in the finish. The hops balance out the mix. The mouthfeel of the beer is sharp and clean feeling. A good healthy amount of carbonation in this beer livens it up a bit. Overall I thought this beer was quite refreshing and enjoyable. I could see myself possibly drinking this one again some day."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice, hazy champagne color. Hint of pepper and hay on the nose. Citrus flavors are immediately present but all too fleeting thanks to a tandem of yeast and wood. There's a touch of vanilla and a surprisingly chewy mouthfeel to it. Dry finish to a mostly excellent Saison."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow. This beer is amazing. Easily one of the best - if not the best - examples of the style I have ever encountered. Excellent. Definitely buying this one again. Slam dunk for Goose Island! Glad to have them in our area finally."
""
""
""
"O: this beer has held up amazingly well and tastes fantastic. quite impressive"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O- Truly a great beer, complex and well balanced, decent ABV at 6.5%, and it goes down very easy. Recommended for everyone to try, not just fans of Saisons."
"Goose island once again blows me away with this effortless brew"

"The tast followed very nicely, very tart, very rounded for a saison, i loved it. I could drink this all night."

"O - a good farmhouse style ale from Goose Island. A little different approach than I'm used to with this style, but still holds a place of its own. If you are a fan of saison/farmhouse ales this is a must experience. I am fascinated with farmhouse ales and this brings a new but nice change to a fabulous style of ales. I'm actually surprised this is available year round. Not something id drink in the cold winter months as this thing screams late spring/summer style brew for me. It has a good style and flair to it. I'll buy again without a doubt."
""
""
""
"O I like this Beligum, well balanced. Nice job Goose Island. This is an enjoyable brew that is worth trying. I love the dryness."
""
""
"Overall pretty good but a bit simple... but nothing wrong with with this quaffable brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very good and despite how dry it is, the drinkability of the flavor overcomes that nicely. I like these a little dry, this just seems too dry for me."
"O-very well balanced and flavorful saison. Well crafted"
""
"O) For a style I don't seek out regularly, I found this Saison pretty darn enjoyable. Nothing over the top here, just a highly drinkable brew. I'd be interested to see what this is like with some age. This is a good beer to unwind after work with, or perhaps sip on the patio, after dealing with some no good chipmunks that won't stop digging around your air conditioner. Glad to recommend..."
"Review from 4/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a light orange yellow color with a thin white head and light lacing. Aroma of citrus, wheat and slight brett. Flavor is citrus, wheat with a hint of brett, a slightly sour middle and dry saison finish. Everything muted but well integrated. I like the subtle but complex flavor of this saison."
""
""
""
"This strikes me as a nice summer quaffing beer, one meant for uncritical gulping. Nothing wrong with that I guess..."
"O - A great Saison that I would return to frequently if it were available in my area. The Belgian spin really makes this one impressive. Bravo."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Fantastic saison. One of my new favorites."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very solid Saison."
""
""

"The beer pours a slightly hazy straw/piss yellow with a fire storm of bubbles escaping from the bottom of the glass and reminding me of champagne. The head lasts awhile at a finger width and is made of big and velvety bubbles that leave a lightly sticky and sliding lacing on the glass. The beer smells damp and fruity with a nice spicy kick. The wine barrels that the beer sat in also seem to be present as a ghost in the smell. There is some great citrus orange in the smell and a nice slight farmhouse funk. The beer tastes tart and fruity with an oh-so-slight biscuity malt background. The spices are subtler in the taste, though the orange peel distinctly kicks through in the fruitiness of the beer. A sweet, perhaps chardonnay flavor ghosts in the beer, and the farmhouse funk is present slightly as it plays with the biscuit malts, but the sweet orange citrus is the first big flavor in the beer. On further sips I also started detect nice bananay yeast, reminiscent of Matilda, which is quite nice. Aftertaste is slightly sweet and citrusy, but the sweet malt takes over more and leaves a nice glaze in the mouth. Mouthfeel is a little sharp from the initial sip with carbonation, but not too much so. The beer then mellows into a velvety clean caramel on the tongue and washes down nicely leaving slight saliva and the ghost of a tingle, and nothing else. Overall, I think this is a solid citrus saison. It reminds me of Le Merle from North Coast Brewing, only I like Sofie more in flavor and in the fact that the carbonation isn’t assaulting my tongue. Good saison, though I tend to like the spice-sentric ones more than the citrus ones, this beer is worthy of a try, though, and another lovely Belgian Style Ale by Goose Island."
""
"Pours a hazy pale yellow with a medium slowly dissipating white pillowy head with some light lacing. Aroma of spicy fruity esters, some citrus and banana notes, light yeast fill the senses. Taste is biscuit malt, yeast, citrus notes with some spicy fruity flavors and some nice tart bitterness. palate is a nicely balanced medium crisp body with lively mouth tingling carbonation. The finish is a sweet spicy tropical fruity flavorsome nice citrus notes, yeast ending with a lingering sweet tart bitterness with a bit of nutty flavor. Overall a very good, tasty and nicely balanced Saison. Nice."
""
""
""
"Very impressive."
""
""
""
""
""
"Would pair well with rich Italian seafood dishes."
""
""
""
"Overall: A perfect summer beer, and a regular in my lineup if I'm just buys 12oz singles. Highly recommended."
""
"O - A really good beer considering I wasn't expecting much. Nice and sessionable. The 12oz bottle was good as I would prefer to not drop 22oz prices every time I want this beer."
""
"Overall: An excellent saison, light, refreshing and very flavorful. This was the first of the Goose Island Belgians that I've tried and based on Sofie, I'll be sure to pick up the others."
" The taste is nice vibrant and tangy with dry vinous and lightly sulfuric with gentle white grape and light pepper with slight apple skin quality and mild yeast with wheat and light element of vinous barrel essence coming forward. The flavor is good I found this to be an enjoyable saison with fruity quality from the barrel with some aspects that might come off as cheesiness from the yeast which detracts a tinge from the flavor, but overall a good beer."
""
"Overall, a teriffic saison. Count me a fan- I could drink this beer all the time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A really good and interesting brew here. I love how they brought some huge fruit flavors without making it too sweet. Things are nicely drying. This almost is more like a white wine but it has just enough malts and hops to remind you its a beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Pretty impressed with this beer. I've had a few of the other GI Belgians but this is my favorite so far. Crisp and refreshing with plenty of flavor. Perfect beer to have on a summer afternoon. I would give this beer more points if I felt the wild yeasts and wine barrels contributed a little more. Still, Sofie is worth picking up. I'm glad I randomly stopped at Zupan's and found this sitting on the shelves."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Sofie pours a hazy goldenrod, with maybe two fingers of white foam crowning the beer. Head retention is solid, but lacing is very spotty. The nose has lots of black pepper, and solid secondary note of citrusy orange peel. For all that went into this beer though (brett, wine barrel aging), I was expecting a bit more life and variety in the aroma. I definitely find it in the flavor profile though. There's a bit of bready sweetness that flashes at the front of each sip. It's followed by the orange peel and pepper interplay that so thoroughly dominates the nose. As the beer warms a little bit though, some earthy brett funk and a touch of acidity that's very reminiscent of white wine begin to shine through as supporting notes. The body is dry, but could probably stand to be a little more light yet. The carbonation is plenty active. It took a little time to get going, but Goose Island's Sofie is a very tasty, complex take on the saison style."
""
"Very easy drinking, I'm excited to see how this continues to evolve."
""
"O: Pretty damn good, especially considering saisons aren't one of my more favored styles. At first I really liked it, then I started to grow slightly weary of it, but near the end of my glass (as the funkiness increased) it became more enjoyable. Well worth a shot."
""
""

""
""
""
""
"Overall - A very pleasant, very drinkable beer. Worth trying not in my top 10."

""
""
"This is light bodied, with crisp refreshing carbonation. I will probably get this again. A nice light refreshing Belgian in a four-pack at an affordable price is something I can appreciate (and will)!"
"O: I am really glad to have tried this beer, but I am going to give my other three some time in the cellar to see if some of the booze and astringency drops away."
""
""
"Carbonated taste, slightly champagne like almost. Light; fresh; Curious to try a colaboration with some raspberry..."
""
"O: Delicious saison, one of the best I've had."
"Overall: a definite slower drinking beer as the flavors excite the taste buds but is nit necessarily refreshing. Very tasty and worth seeking out."
""
"O: Worthy release of a saison style beer, unique to me with its wine properties. Would love to drink more and try other Goose Islands."
"O: Was hoping this to be more tart/sour, but nevertheless this was enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'll pour my Goose Island Sofie and look in the direction of Belgium both paying homage and pretentiously scoffing at the motherland; they might need to step their game up with this beer among the ranks. Hell of a saison, and a damn good beer overall."
""
""

"Pours clear golden in body with white head that fades. Smells of funk, lemons, floral notes, and vinegar background. Tastes of lemons, funk, floral notes, honey, and pretty fruity. Light in body with aggressive carbonation. Spritzy and light, a ton of lemon."
""
""
""
""
"O: A subtle, and yet complex saison, definitely seems to have mellowed out with age, smooth and mild"
"Light clouded peach/orange golden with a bright fine effervescent white head. Fine Belgian style lacing spread evenly, very good looking beer. Aroma has hints of citrus, white grape, light toasted oak with tart green apple hanging on. Slightly spicy Belgian inspired notes as well, with a honeysuckle floral quality. Flavors bring on bold but refreshing qualities, swirl this around in the mouth and you'll get some tart green apple, lime citrus peel, with spicy black pepper. Amongst other flavors are some light toasted oak, and mild honey sweetness, finishes perfectly dry from the Belgian yeast utilized. Mouthfeel is on point with your favorite Belgians, effervescent light and airy, perfect really. Overall, another perfect creation from Goose Island, AB buyout hasn't changed them yet. Really nice beer, up there with Matilda comparing this to a Belgian Pale is a bit out of touch but both unique dead on style Belgians."
"Overall: I'm in love. I'll be snatching up as much of this gorgeously drinkable beer as possible and I suggest you do the same in your area. (Unless it's Southern Illinois)"
""
"Cloudy pale yellow pour with a creamy puff of white head that retained well and left nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of grassy funk, ripe pears and melons. Much of the same in the taste, bready yeast, ripe fruits including banana as well, wet funk and trace of peppery spice. Medium body and easily drinkable making for a nice beer overall."
""
""
"O: This is a great example of a saison. Just solid in every aspect even with a little over 2 years on it. I will be seeking this one out again."
""
"Overall a good beer that I could have once in a while. It's not one that you can easily drink multiples of unless you're really in the mood."

"O: A very enjoyable beer and one of the better American versions of the style that I've had."
""
""
""
"O: Really enjoyed this saison. The orange peel and wine barrel came out nicely."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The beer is quite tasty and enjoyable though is a little too intense in flavor to be sessionable - this is a very good sipping beer. I found the beer to be quite refreshing. The funkiness of this beer might make it a little less approachable for folks that are not fans of that flavor profile."
""
"Overall: Goose Island has succeeded in take the simple Belgian Wit and turned it into something more complex and interesting. The spice combination in addition to the oak aging in wine barrels really adds new flavors unseen in many other beers of this style."
"2011 poured in a duvel tulip. Pours a hazy gold with a inch thick white head that lingers with ok lacing. Aroma is white grapes, yeast, and mild pepper. Reminds me of a pinot grigio. Taste is white grape, golden raisin, Belgian yeast, and some pepper. Thin mouthfeel with crisp carbonation. This beer resembles champagne. Not bad."
""
"Nice fluffy body with nice effervescence. Tart sweetness throughout. Lemon grass flavor. White peppercorn. Some spicy yeast bite but balances out the sweetness. Complex well blended and great balance. Very good. Doesn't wow you but its finely crafted."
"O: Smells great! But I can't find the balance I expected from it. The smell says one thing, but the taste says another thing. Maybe this bottle just needs some aging to be more balanced?"
"O- this is my first beer from Goose Island and I enjoyed it but I found it to be to yeasty. I would like to see how Sofie gets with age."

"But for some lovers of lighter crisper delicate beers, this may have something to offer"
""
"Pours a nice reddish orange, slight haze, 2 soapy head. Lemons, orange peel, spice and hints of clove. Explosive fruit blast on the tongue, fruity pebbels, lemons, limes, oranges, slight sour/funk on the finish. Light on feel, big carbonation, very sweet a tad sour. Great saison, Sofie is always a good choice."
""
""
"Beer pours a slightly hazy yellow/hay color with a fluffy white head. The bubbles continue to rise to the top noticeably, even after several minutes. I really enjoy the aroma of this beer. It's got white wine, oak, a bit of brett, some peppery spice, citrus fruit and a hint of banana all mixed together wonderfully. Flavor follows the nose, as all of those same elements I got in the smell come together very well in the flavor. It's very much a full-flavored saison, something I really appreciate. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with heavy carbonation and a slightly dry finish. Overall, I think this is a highly underrated beer. For a year round, off the shelf saison, it really knocks it out of the park. It's a beer I always keep in my fridge and will drink again and again."
"Tasting at World Wine & Liquor in Mentor Ohio. Poured into a 4 oz. Plastic cup a slightly hazy straw color with a big and fluffy white head. A musty, funky aroma of lemon & orange peels, the trade mark bubblegum, pepper, and a yeasty spiciness. Full-bodied and a creamy. The flavor starts with bubble gum and bananas. Lemons and oranges at the end. There is a vanilla quality along with pepper and a yeasty spiciness throughout. This is my favorite of the G.I. Belgian brews."
""
"O - The style of saison is a widely diverse one that can range from wit to wild. This one certainly favors the wit side of that range, but I found it to be delicious. There is just enough funk and sour to set this one apart and add complexity to the citrus and wheat. Overall, it is very refreshing, drinkable, and delicious. I will get it again if I can find it."
"Overall: this is a perfect bridge beer from a boring lager and into craft beers. Also if you are serving chicken salad this would be perfect. Looking forward to more tastes from the Goose!"
""
""
"This is a phenomenal Belgian Style Ale, reminiscent more of a saison or farmhouse ale than a Belgian. Not sweet, but not too sour, with a decent amount of funk but not so much that your lips curl as you sip it down. Just think of it as the Goldilocks of beer!"
"O - Delicate. Takes awhile to open up, but when it does it is pleasant."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the mix between robust spice and sourness through the end of the flavoring. Everything through the taste was balanced and blended nicely together, making the drinker wanted to come back more with each sip. We were surprised at the wheat inclusions in the grain bill, but in the end this made for a unique Saison, with a bit of a dirty kick."
""
""
"O: Delicious. Paired wonderfully with the mussels too."
"2012 bomber poured into a Goose Island belgian glass. Pours a clear gold and a steady stream of bubbles keeps a nice layer of pearl foam. White pepper, oak, belgian yeast, coriander, and orange peel dominate the aroma. Add some lemon zest and... viognier(?) barrels to that and you've pretty much got the flavor profile right there. It's light, aromatic, and with a nice balance of spicy, sweet, and citrus for a warm evening. It doesn't wow me the way some Saisons have (I'm looking at you, Saison L'Hiver!), but I'm certainly glad I've tried it."
"O: Very complex which I contribute to 20% being aging in wine barrels. Excellent white grape qualities all around with lemon, bread dough and light spices. The wild yeast notes add just enough and keep it very refreshing. An excellent Saison."
""
""
""
""
"O: I've had my share of wine-like beers, and this one is very nice. A good representation of the style, while interpreting the wine barrel nicely and not over-doing it. The orange peel also adds another dimension that helps to keep things from being just another saison. Reminds me of DFH Noble Rot with the saison base and wine character"
""
""
"O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a very good lighter Saison worth drinking for a long time."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a tulip glass. This is a cloudy golden yellow color with soapy foam. Smells of Belgian yeast and spices with lots of cloves and orange. Taste combines light tartness/sourness and citrus. It is very drinkable and doesn't have as much of the strong flavors of other saisons."
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is a bright, hazy, orange-gold coloring with only a hint of film atop the brew. Steady carbonation flow throughout the body of the beer. Aromas of clove, butter, saffron, and some dull fruity sweetness. Flavors are a bit watered down, with a toasty, slightly sour backbone of cereal and banana. The slight sour character keeps the spice notes to a bare minimum, with only a hint of oregano and clove. There is a slick, oily partial lacing left along the glass. Toasty, subtle aftertaste, with not much else to go on. The finish is quick and sharp, with a slight bitterness to it. Meh."

"I really like this beer; it is a spot on example of a saison with enough complexity to keep things interesting."
"2011 Vintage. Pours a hazy, bright, golden-straw color with a medium white head that disappears quickly. Appearance reminds me of a berlinerweisse. Scent is slightly funky with a good amount of Belgian yeast. Definite orange peel aromas in the nose. Hints of banana and clove with the slightest tart lemon aroma. Taste is tingly once it hits the tongue. Bright citrus fruits immediately followed by banana and pepper. Wonderful Belgian yeast flavors. Lemon and orange peel with just a bit of bubblegum. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated, crisp, and champagne-like. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this is not my favorite representation of the saison...but it is a damn tasty beer."
""
""
""
"O - A great beer in this series from Goose Island. Very drinkable for a Belgian farmhouse. Fully recommend."
"Overall - I give Goose Island credit for originality on this one, but its not the best tasting beer due to the sour/tartness."
"O - Taste and smell are on-par for style, but mouthfeel is really keeping me from liking this more."
""
""
""
"D: really enjoy the tart/barny notes going on here, but something seems slightly missing. perhaps a touch more grain to build a little more body? perhaps im being picky? still really solid and worth trying."
""
"D ~ A long awaited want that actually exceeded my expectations. I did not expect it to look, smell, & taste like it did at all. I really like the use of pilsner & wheat malt as a canvas to paint the floral & fruity body of this beer. Seek out. Big ups to Crabbicus for relieving this want!"

"O: very delicious beer, my first saison and I'm glad its from Goose Island. Shared it with my girlfriend and she very much enjoyed it as well. I've found a keeper."

""
""
"O- This is on its way to becoming a good saison, but doesn't quite have enough umph. I believe that a drier body and more accentuated yeast characteristics would bring this beer together better."
""
""
"Overall - Another great beer that would work well as a gateway to get people into sours. It has nice subtle flavours that work well together. The bottom of the bottle contained lots of sediment and my second glass had a bit of a different flavour. Good stuff that I will buy again."
""
"The first smell that comes to mind is oak, not sure which type of wine used to age that portion of the beer, but it could be chard. Nice sweet grain aroma lying beneath the oak aroma. The taste is very pleasant the oak provides a pleasant touch of sour, a nice intro to sours, or intro to good beer for a wine lover."
""

"O=Nothing spectacular...too light in flavor and body for my liking."
""
""
""
"This was a great beer - one that I had not anticipated liking as much. Very refreshing, yet not boring. Some nice complexity with the yeast flavors. Will seek out and drink again!"
""
"Update: drinking 2 year old vintage. Aged beautifully. The brett has really developed with a nice subtle earthiness and left the beer bone dry. Well worth the time in the cellar."
""
"O: I really like this one. Especially like that it's a nice 12oz format and readily available. Big ups to Goose for that. Need to get my hands on some other saisons and sours from them."

"I let some yeast sediment into the second round and found that while the beer became cloudy, the aroma picked up more of a wheat beer character with banana and clove. The flavor shifted discernibly toward the dry white wine found earlier."
"The Rest: Pretty unique, but tasty none the less. This bottle was a 2010 vintage. Bottle says it can be ages five years, but I don't see much point in that. The profile is pretty tight and clean and I don't see how aging would be very beneficial."
""

"O: Nice effot from Goose Island. They've created an easily accessible Saison that I could see myself returning to."
"O: Overall this is a really nice beer. It's nice and light with a nice tart punch...exactly what I was in the mood for tonight. A nice break from the bourbon barrel stouts and IIPA's I have been enjoying lately. Really glad I got to try this. It seems that Goose Island is never disappointing as everything I have had from them has been outstanding. 4.5"
"I drank the whole bottle myself and loved every swallow, though I got too greedy and wound up with a good amount of yeast floaters from the bottom of the bottle due to wanting to drink every single drop."
""
""
"Y'know, I think I've had Sofie a couple times before...why the hell haven't I given her the proper respect of a review yet? Let's fix it: She pours a clear pale straw topped by a finger-and-a-half of white foam. The nose comprises lemon zest, sour wheat, pepper, dank oak, and spicy white grapes. The taste holds notes of lemon zest, orange peel, cardamom, wheat, black pepper, and spicy white wine grapes. As nice as the flavors come across, it's not as good as the smell would have me believe. The body is a hefty light, with a moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a tasty, refreshing Belgian treat. Good times."

"Overall, it's a remarkably charming and seductive ale. I think that almost anyone could fall in love with this beer. Worth seeking out!"

"O-An okay beer but nothing too exciting. Go for Matilda instead of this one."
"Overall this a nice representation of the style. Not really a standout Saison like I hoped it would be but still very solid."
"Pours a medium yellow color with a thin off white head. Somewhat hazy in appearance, with decent lacing on my snifter glass. Nose is nice, although subdued. Funk, light fruit, spice, pepper are the main things I get. Very clean nose. Taste is good, using the same profile as the nose... but it's too sweet and clean tasting. I want more funk/meat in this beer. It's too refined and sweet for my tastes. Feel is very light, with low carbonation and a slightly dry finish. Some funk again in the aftertaste. Overall, this is a serviceable saison... but you can find much better in the style out there. Especially from Belgium. Cheers."

"2011 Sofie bottled 9/15/11 (1557) and poured from the bottle into a tulip glass. Cloudy golden color with a fingers width of quickly dissipating white head. Smell is a little funky and musky, a bit yeasty and kind of oaky in the nose. Taste is similar to the nose a little drying on the end with hints of citrus fruits, (orange peel) sweet yeast presence a touch of white grapes (chardonnay barrel aging) musky oak presence is evident but all together well balanced. Can't wait for another bottle of this in future trades."

"Its very drinkable, probably one of the more drinkable craft Belgian ales. My favorite Saison so far. Guava Groove on deck!"

""
"This is a great starter beer when trying to get people into craft beer, especially for wine/champagne lovers."
""
""
""
""
"this is a 2011 bottle. Should develop more funky aromas and flavors with more age, but the citrus base of it right now is very nice"
"O: A very nice farmhouse ale. Vinous, dry, funky. Not overly complex, but very nice."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a good saison, on par with Tank 7. Recommended gateway beer."

"O - My favorite summer beer. I find this beer extremely complex in flavor yet delightfully refreshing."
"This is a great example of the style and a really good beer. Start right away, nurse it and revel in the growth of flavor or let it warm for 20 minutes or so before drinking. Either way, great stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - comparing to Capt Lawrence's 'liquid gold', this pulls off the same idea more successfully of taking the backbone of the farmhouse style and re-imagining it as an american pale ale. this is a great all purpose beer for food."
"O: I really enjoyed this beer, want to pick up an extra couple bottles to age."
""
""
"O: The last pour (sediment included) was every bit as glorious as the first. I've never had this beer fresh but, at one year, it was nothing short of spectacular. Constantly seeking out this beer."

""
"Crisp medium body with soft carbonation, earthy funk, sweet light fruit, zesty spice and alcohol. Up front there is a strong fruit presence with hints of apple and pear followed by some musty/earthy notes of grass and straw before finishing with slightly dry with more sweet alcohol flavor. A nice amount of zesty spice and bready yeast add another dimension and fullness to the palate. Very nice balance of flavors going on here."
""
"O: Very refreshing beer. When I read about how the beer was made I was imagining it would be just a bit too much or come off too strong. I was pleasantly surprised when I found a very refreshing and tasty beer perfect for a summer picnic."

"Pours very pale straw yellow, cloudy, with bone white head that seems to dissipate quickly but leaves some lacing. Malty, grainy aroma; a hint of sour fruit and a decent helping of grassy hops. The flavor is sweet and sour; malt and bread notes mix with sour fruity flavors - vegetal and planty but simultaneously sweet and rich. A bit on the sweet side to me, with a medium body lacking in much carbonation."
"Pours a brilliant pale golden color, with a bone white crackling head and some lace. Aroma of funk, bretty, and light touches of hop flowers. In the taste, grainy malts, moderate acidity, mild tart flavor and a drying finish. Saison like qualities of hay, grass and lemon are all in the flavor profile. Small sour and champagne like dryness. Great feel, and overall, a remarkable ale. One of the better Saisons I have had to date."
"Clear yellow with an inch of white foam. Smell is slightly biscuit, but faint overall. Taste is light lemongrass, zesty and fruity with biscuit malt backdrop, slightly sweet. Finishes clean with a rinse of hop. Mouthfeel is light with strong carbonation."
"A decent interpretation of a Saison."
"It looked and felt good but the smell and taste were really lacking. Easy to drink because it tasted like flavored water. Not really impressed."
"O: Very good. Reminds me of wine with a bit of beer."
"Overall - Really nice, the smell scaried me, i thoguht it was going to be very wine like and bittter, but the fruits really mellowed it out and made it smooth. Wine fans, farmhouse fans will love this. Nice take on a saison for sure."
"O - The Chardonnay takes over, but in a good way... I will be buying more to age, I'd love to see what happens to Sofie with some age. A beautiful beer."
"O: A truly wonderful beer. I wasn't sure what to expect from it but am really pleased with the bottle. Would buy it again"
"Bottled on 4/24/12 so over a year in the bottle. Wow much more funky! This is now fantastic. Its a bit more fruity and much more funk...wow. age this brew."
"Overall quite easy drinking, and a good intro saison for I think those who might not want to jump into something too extreme. I can see giving this off to many wine drinkers and seeing them really enjoying it. THe only thing missing I think is a bit of yeast punch and funk/brett and or sour qualities, but that's alright."
"Notes: Sofie is a light to moderate-bodied brew with an incredibly silky mouthfeel. Drinkability is superb, and even at 6.5%, this beer is insanely sessionable. One of the best American interpretations of the Saison style, and easily one of my favorite offerings from Goose Island."
"O - I had this at a local watering hole and bought the first 4 pack I found. I liked it a lot and so did my bitch and brother."
"I'd still suggest it, though. =)"
"Overall, this is a very enjoyable beer that I could drink all day long. Great flavors and well-rounded."
"O: Excellent sipping beer, much more pleasant than many other Saisons."
"Real powerful carbonation. Easy drinking and real flavorful. Top notch."
"Overall an excellent beer. I could drink this one all day."
"Pours a hazy golden yellow with a fluffy white head that settles to a squat cap. Crisp aromas of sweet malt, lemon juice, coriander, and just a touch of funk. Taste is of wheat, lemon juice and zest, coriander, and freshly-cut grass. Not funky or ""farmhouse", rather clean, crisp, and dry. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing, with a medium body and sharp carbonation. Overall a very nice, drinkable Saison, I could drink a number of these in a sitting!"
"Overall a fantastic ale that I can honestly say is up-to-par with some of its Belgian counterparts. I do like the basil notes very much. For $9.99 a 4-pack, I can't say I'll keep this in my fridge at all times, but I will be seeking it out fresh next late springtime for sure."
"Bottle opens with a nice crack and then a volcano of foam that almost made it into the sink. When it all settles down it pours a mostly clear golden straw color with a pillowy white head that sticks around forever. Smells sweet and fruity with lemons and green apples dominating the aroma. There's some funk in there that reminds me a bit of spoiled meat? Luckily its not to strong but its there. Taste is a bit sweet, green apples and honey mixed with a bit of funk. Spirited level of carbonation, medium body, sweet almost sticky mouthfeel. Despite the misstep upon opening, this beer isn't half bad."
"O- an excellent saison, certainly one of my favorites. Not the most complex, nor the deepest, but an excellent choice nonetheless."
"This is a pretty yummy, well rounded ale. Kind of a belgian-y saison thing going on. Thanks to Sweetwillyrolbar for another tasty beer!"
"Flavor is a bit light and dry for the style with pale malts and a light spice profile. Starts off great but doesn't have the resources to really close the deal. Feel, like the taste, is moderate and a bit too one sided to really grab you. Overall an easy drinking Saison with a nice aroma that lacks slightly in the depth department."
"O: Sucked down a 12oz bottle too quickly. I want more."
"I tried this at a beer tasting recently and decided to pick up a 4-pack. It's pretty good now, but I'm going to let the rest of them get a little age under their belt as some of the other reviewers suggested."
"Overall: Pleasantly surprised with this one. I was not sure what I was getting into with this beer, but I was definitely rewarded for my adventure. Excited to age a few of these."
"O: This is a very tasty beer and one that I would surely buy again. Another win for Goose Island."
"A decent craft brew though from goose island. Would try it again."
"Good, but too much apple. Maybe fermentation temps were too high. Maybe it is green beer and needs to age for a while. Would not buy again."
"This beer pours a slightly hazy straw color with an off white head that is big and fluffy. The smells is lightly spicy and full of wine barrel character. The flavor follows suit with there being a delicate saison spicy character with some wonderful white wine qualities. The mouthfeel is light crisp and mouth watering. Over all this is one of the better saisons that is widely available."
"I am truly impressed. This beer has so much going for it - stunning appearance, great mouthfeel, and excellent balance of flavors. The only thing keeping me from giving it 5s across the board is that I think it could have a bit more depth, especially in the smell. But it would be real hard to improve on this beer."
"This is incredibly tasty and I'm enjoying it a fair bit. Biggest beef is the sweetness which, with age, would die as the Brett munches away. Need to get some bottles to age, allow to get drier and more Brett character. Top notch."
"D. Nice and drinkable. I would drink again."
"O- Overall a very solid beer. It didn't blow me away in any particular aspects but it was very drinkable with enough balanced complexity to slow me down to reflect on the beer. This was bottled 12/11/09 and drank 8/14/11."
"o- Not a Belgian fan but wanted to try because I love the other Goose Island selections. Overall not a bad beer that I would have again. The clove and spices not overwhelming. B+"
"My notes hold up, I have more experience with sours at this point, and I think this beer stands up pretty well to similar beers of the style."
"O - While interesting, as beers in this category generally are, I cannot recommend this particular saison to any but fans of sour beers with a strong banana components. Perhaps aging is required."
"O: Very surprised by this one. A very awesome beer. Need to pick up another bottle or two and see how it ages. Got one already but says it develops in the bottle for up to 5 years. Definitely give this one a shot."
"O: good saison that can hold its own but is missing out on six pack potential, especially for this easy of a drinking beer."
"O-excellent, on a par with Hennepin which is my personal favorite siason"
"750ml bottle: This one pours a pale, straw yellow color. There was a huge frothy white head on it that didn’t linger long, nor did it leave any lacing. Nose is mainly peppery and coriander. Some citrus also. The taste is very good. Somewhat lighter body, but very flavorful. Some wheat notes, coriander and peppery notes, and some citrus, just like the nose. Subtle, yet a bit complex and very tasty. I will definitely have another."
"Overall, Very nice beer, worth the try."
"I'm having another."
"A solid but unremarkable saison. I've had this before and will likely have it again, but wouldn't go out of my way to find it."
"Had this one during the 'We Want The Funk!' tasting that was graciously hosted by beermeX2! Big thanks goes out to beermeX2 for sharing this one with the group! Bottled 02/11/11. Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured a hazy straw yellow with a half finger pure white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, grain, funk, and earth. The flavor was of sweet malt, grain, wheat, slight funk, and earth. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. This is the beer myself and beermeX2 used to warm up our palates while waiting for the others to arrive. A really nice saison with just a hint of some funkiness. For some odd reason I really like saisons with a touch of funk. Everything just seems to work, and this is no exception. A must try."
"O - good beer, the aroma frightened me as fas as a preconceived possibiliity that it will be overly sweet which would be weird, not the case the tart characters were done accodingly to avoid such a mess, this is great summer sunday evening beer. drink it for sofie who is feeling a little sour after the boat ride..."
"D: This fits what I think was the brewers goal, beer for the dinner table. I could imagine serving this in place of a Sauv Blanc or alascian Riesling."
"Pours an opaque pale golden color with about a half finger of pure white foam, minimal lacing and okay retention. Smells like sweet banana and green apple, some spiciness. Taste is a nice mildly tart apple, lemon, and white pepper. Medium bodied and medium carbonation. Overall, this is a very refreshing and drinkable beer, clean flavors, pairs well with food and is great for the warm weather."
"O/D-I am quite impressed by this beer. I am not very familiar with the style. I did not enjoy the mouthfeel all that much, but I really enjoyed the flavor. This beer drinks incredibly easily. It begs for another sip. I really think that if I had enjoyed its mouthfeel more I would LOVE this. But I truly do still like it a lot."
"Overall I don't know why people are rating this so high. It's nothing that a saison should be. Especially if you look at what the standard is considered (fantome). Its not a terrible beer but has so much wrong and it is not to style at all. No thank you."
"While I'm not a huge fan of saisons, this was one of the most enjoyable that I've had and would certainly be a recommendation I would make to others just trying this style for the first time. A nice bouquet and full flavors that don't overwhelm or put off. I don't think I could throw back a lot of these, but certainly worth trying again in the future."
"Pours a little bit cloudy, yellow-golden with greenish tint with enough carbonation to lift a full finger persistent head. Some citrus and funk along with a bit of yeasty and spice notes. The carbonation keeps the various flavors alive and interesting. A nice range of flavors from acid-citrus elements through some sour-tartness and a touch of sweet spice. This is really nice. Refreshing and very drinkable!"
"(I took what I consider adequate notes on my tasting, but frankly I was busy enjoying this with (near the end of the glass) bacon wrapped dates.)"
"O - this has good drinkability. The flavor is good, and I could easily drink a few of these in a sitting. Overall, I thought this was a nice twist on the style. It was very tasty, and I would definitely pick it up again."
"Overall: Easy to drink at 6.5% ABV"
"T-Really awesome interpretation. Just enough innovation that it isnt boring or played out, but does not drift to far away from the style that leaves you confused on what your even drinking. Awesome!"
"Ah, a nice rich farmhouse aroma with white grapes and sharp apple and horse blanket. The fruit morphs into a sweeter, creamy frosting taste with lemon tart cupcake and a mild cherry finish. This is an impressive beer. It doesn't quite have the mouthfeel of classic, big bottle saison from Belgian, but Goose Island has created a great take of the farmhouse ale."
"O-Was feeling bummed out after not doing good on my GRE but this beer put me in a better mood. It was my first go at GI's Belgians and I'll most likely have more after this one."
"Overall: This beer makes me feel so grateful for the good things in life! Much like the Rodenbach grand-cru this beer leaves your mouth with a taste of bubble gum candy. Very refreshing. It has a long bitter cloying finish which, I think, gives this beer character! Definitely a beer to have on a picnic or as an alternative to champagne! Also a great beer to have with a medium to full bodied habano leaf cigar!"
"Overall Impression- Have had this Saison once before (The Tavern) and was very happy with it. Easy drinkability and is very balanced. Almost a thirst quencher during a hot day. Would recommend to anyone who wants an above average Saison or even could be a first Saison for some!"
"Upon first sip the carbonation is very prominate and last the whole time. There is a bit more citrus in the taste but it pretty much backs up the aroma with a pepper bite. This is very refreshing but the carbonation was toned down just a bit it would be even better. It finishes very crisp and of fresh grains of paradise. This was very drinkable and well done."
"Pours a hazy golden color with a one finger white head. As I drink the beer it leaves a little bit of lacing in my tulip glass. The smell has a nice fruity sweetness to it, a smell I can't exactly place, it seems like strawberry and a touch of mango and citrus. It also smells slightly acidic. The taste starts with a fruity sweetness, in the middle of the taste I get some light malts and towards the end it tastes a little bit sour. Mouthfeel is a medium, with energetic carbonation. Overall, this is a very different take on a Saison style, but I prefer a more traditional saison."
"O: I drank this vintage about a year ago, and I am positive the extra year in the bottle has served it well. Lovely, mature American interpretation of a Saison. I suspect the barrel-aging is asserting itself a bit more now. Super drinkable."
"D/O: Very drinkable and overall a very tasty beer."
"The aroma was highly charged on this one. Lots of light fruit swirling around with a healthy dose of spice in it as well. Nice touches of coriander, lemon, hints of pepper coming through, with a touch of pears warming up to it as it came up to room temperature. The initial taste was peppery, with a rush of lemon following suit almost immediately. A wonderful sense of light fruit really just ran all over this one. I was quite impressed I have to admit. Smooth mouth feel was more the adequately carbonated and really just kept the profile popping throughout. An easy sipper, the moderate ABV lended itself well to a warm late summer evening."
"this is the perfect beer for a hot summer day. pours a hazy straw color with a big white head that disappears quickly. nose detects sweet fruits and breads. has a tart taste, but not too over the top. can taste apples and oranges with a slight wheat taste in the background. nice and smooth with great carbonation. a very good brew from goose island."
"I must admit...the post on the Goose Island web site mentioning this batch may be tainted got me thinking....and drinking. Here we go...pours a light yellow colored ale with a huge white foamy head with nice lacing. The aroma is fruity with apples, pears and some nice wine characteristics. Pleasing. The taste is good with some funk mixed in. Floral, dark fruits and a bit of wildness on the tail end. Lingering orange peel on the aftertaste which is actually quite nice. The wine seems to have disappeared but I carry on. Overall I think this brew really hits the Saison style. A lot of the American-ized Saisons are off the mark but this stays true to the style. Throwing in the 20% Belgian aged in wine barrels is a nice twist. A good beer on bottled on 2/11/11 but am curious to see how this would turn out in 4+ years as the bottle states it can develop. Will probably buy another to age and see the difference."
"Overall a solid great beer, especially in the hot months. I think this is the first of this style I've had, and I can say I'm a fan! I want to try more and see how Goose Island stacks up. Even my wife loved this one."
"I hadn't had a Sofie in a long while, so I can't attest to the level of infection this may possess. Based on what I was sipping any added funkiness was welcomed. Nice and refreshing."
"Delicious!"
"O: Excellent. One of the best saisons I've had and I've had a lot. This is worth seeking out."
"O- Very good beer. Can't wait to taste some of GI's other belgian style ales."
"i think i had a bad batch or something. butter dominated and stayed. not much of anything else came. was pretty sad about that as i expect nice things from goose. i have another bottle of this too, didnt buy it from the same shop so dont know if i should age it like i wanted or drink it now and see if i want to get more."
"This is a very excellent beer and the wild yeast character with the light malt, high carbonation and citrus flavors meld well."
" Overall I love this beer! Very well made, leaves me wanting more.Very refreshing on a hot day. I will be seeking out more of this.I highly reccommend!"
"O- An enjoyable, refreshing beer. Very drinkable. I have a feeling I'll be coming back to this beer a lot during the summer."
"O: Sofie is a pleasure to drink and a really nice beer. I've had a handful of saisons in the last couple of weeks and this is my favorite."
"O. Great drinkability to this beer. The flavor is one of mystique, with each tone difficult to detect, Sofie is a mysterious beer that reminds me of a mostly innocent girl that is worth every bit of the trouble she brings..."
"A very tart saison. Reminds me of a civilized fantome. Wish i had opened it on a very hot day, its extremely refreshing. Not a boring beer."
"O - This would make for a good cocktail beer. I could have this with an appetizer or during happy hour."
"overall: probably the best saisons i've had so far. very refreshing."
"O: All in all, it’s a very non-traditional Belgian offering. I have to say that I do not like the super-tart overtones. So, even though I won’t be looking for this one again, it doesn’t mean it was a bad drink. At the very least, it expanded my horizons a little."
"O - An excellent interpretation of the style and among the best with wild bug characteristics. I am truly enjoying this beer on this fantastically sunny day!"
"O- What a well brewed and refreshing beer. This comes off as another well made Goose Island beer that I was glad to have drank on many different occasions. ABV doesn't really bother the beer which only adds to the overall drinkability to this beer."
"O: Overall this beer is light , crisp and very enjoyable , slight funkiness with ripe fruits and a slight tartness are all well blended and balanced...the carbonation is perfect; Would recomend."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this one. I can see this becoming a regular summer beer. Stellar offering from Goose Island!"
"Overall: This is my favorite beer made. I can drink it anytime of the year, month, or day and be perfectly content. I love everything it has to offer, and will revisit often. This is what a Saison should be."
"O: This is my ideal Saison so far. Like it a lot. Very light and refreshing, with a balance of sweetness and spices."
"Even a careful pour yields near three fingers of loose and delicate bone white foam, looks like whipped egg whites, dimples a lot as it rapidly dissolves down to the surface, minimal stickiness to the lacing. Bright golden hued liquid with decent clarity, what is does have is a veritable maelstrom of bubbles swirling inside, light enough that there’s no discernible loss at the glass bottom or rims. The nose is a tightly woven series of jabs, mostly white grapefruit and mandarin orange, apple, pear and peach scents with an emphasis on skin, flower blossoms and golden honey, moments of clove and pepper, yeast and perhaps a slight briny influence along with moss and other forest floor matter. Medium-bodied, the carbonation is too foamy at first but does subside some with time, also churns things sufficiently to dampen overall sourness. Lemon, white grapefruit, mineola oranges a fine pair for the clove, coriander, cumin spices. The yeast and bread neither too dry nor sweet, helps anchor the whole in the center. Were there more tang and sugar there might be a tropical character to the apple, nectarine, apricot, pear, red cherry fruit. The grassiness keeps it on the lowdown, tickles the tonsils without looking to get up in your face. Factoring for the carbonation, it’s really not that sweet and the high degree of citrus keeps it on the refreshing side of things, good drinkability. (Bottled on 2/19/10.)"
"A little sweet for a saison, but that Sofie’s a nice lady. Very girl next door. Not sexy, but full of old-fashioned lovely that keeps you coming back for a visit."
"Pours a hazy mellow pale yellow with a one-finger pearl white head. Doesn't last long. Aroma of lemon rind, bit of orange, some barnyard funk. Nice tart lemon flavor to start. A bit of lemon sugary sweetness as well. Sweet and tart. Small amount of grassy and funky flavor are next before the sweet/tart lemon comes full circle to finish this one out."
"Trying too hard to be everything to everyone. I'd rather drink Hennepin."
"I've got another bottle of this that I think I'll age a year or more. The bottle claims that you can cellar it for up to five years. The acidity might be the reason for that claim, but I'm dubious about a 6.5% beer lasting that long. Could be wrong; I'm no expert on cellaring."
"I notice the mouthfeel before anything else. It's too syrupy and thick, almost oily. After that the taste is very subtle. It's very soft on the tongue, almost pale ale like, without a whole lot of zest, sour, or funk - all the fun that comes with a great farmhouse. I'm not crazy about this one, it tastes bland and I even let it sit out of the fridge for 10 minutes before pouring."
"Overall, this was a very good saison and I would recommend you pick it up. I will probably be trying the other Goose Island Belgian beers after being impressed with this one. Just a delight to drink and universal enough that anyone can enjoy it."
"Overall: refreshing beer. feels slightly heavy on the grassiness and lemon. definitely dry on the end. perhaps this is perfect for the style but it's not for me. By no means a bad beer and I certainly wouldn't turn down another if offered."
"Again, nice."
"Overall, i wasn't as impressed with this beer as i had expected to be, but it remains a good beer. maybe just a little too tart, too light, and too much warming alcohol for a 6.5% abv brew intended for warm weather drinking. Probably best served on a chilly spring night."
"this was delicious and paired well with a pizza covered in crushed red pepper. it was light and easy, nothing over powering. i will say not NEARLY as sour as many reviews have stated. i found it quite tame actually, very subtle but worked well."
"O: Well balance and refreshing. A great take on the style. I would definitely recommend it"
"Overall: In keeping with the style, and definitely worth a try. Goose Island deserves credit for their yeast, which really gives the beer much of its flavor and aroma. A bit tart and dry for me, however, and I’m not really sure I'd be as keen to drink more saison ales as opposed to wits or blondes."
"Overall: a solid saison. Though I tend to prefer my saisons to derive their character simply from yeast rather than additives or barrel aging, I will give this one respect where respect is due. The brewers at Goose Island certainly did a good job on this saison. Cheers!"
"D - if I didn't know better i would swear this was made in Belgium. Fantastic interpretation of a classic farmhouse ale."
"D: I like Sofie. Easily one of my top 5, which is why I'm reviewing it. Its simple, not extreme or over the top, and pairs well with quite a bit of everything. It's very accessible. GI crafted a fantastic and unique saison with this one."
"O- Very well balanced and delicious Belgian-style beer. The appearance of this beer is spectacular and it has such great balance between all the great flavors."
"Drink- I could drink this one all day long. I don't know why I never got a bottle in CA but since the company was paying for this grabbed this one in a sea of local craft and BMC. I was a happy guy."
"Overall a very well made and enjoyable beer, but not something that especially wowed me."
"Pours a clean and clear, light gold color, big plume of prickly white bubbles, good retention and lacing. First whiff is lightly soured and tart citrus rind, underneath lies a clean and lightly sweetened malt profile with some hints of bready yeast, funk, hay and spice. Taste is wonderfully complex, tart and sour citrus rind, notes of white wine grapes and skin, clean bready malt, light musty straw and wood. Lighter side of medium bodied, active carbonation, very dry finish. Quite a pleasent suprise, touches many different styles nicely."
"This is one of the best saisons I've had in quite a while. Brewpub saisons are generally so generic, their wits, too. This one follow the guide lines, but makes the style its own."
"D: This is easily one of my favorite farmhouse ales. Really crisp, refreshing, balance, and flavorful. Unfortunately, I only had one of these, but I could put a few more down on a warm spring afternoon like today."
"Would be very interesting to try this one after a few years - might put some away for later tasting!"
"jd"
"O - this is a style I'm just getting into but damn, I enjoy it, and this one is very nice, the orange is noticeable but not over the top, the beer is quenching and sweet without being cloying, gotta give it high marks"
"Overall and very enjoyable well balanced beer. Goose Island has another winner!"
"Taste-Spicy yeast,subtle oakiness, citrus peel, dry, coarse-hop finish. Very tingly, tart, tasty, and refreshing. An excellent match for a zesty salad or a seafood dish. Notes of lemon zest,sea salt, and white pepper. An excellent summer refresher, with or without a food pairing."
"Color is a hazy lemon yellow, with a clean white head that laces nicely. Aroma is fantastic; fruity, citrusy, with a bit of barnyard. The taste is amazingly complex. A ton of lemon giving a nice pucker, with elements of straw, yeast, and sweetness. Mouthfeel is clean and dry, a terrific refreshing brew. I'm a big fan of this style, and this is one of the best examples I've ever tasted."
"Overall: Wine + beer = Sofie."
"D-excellent, all the flavors come together perfectly, also has an evolving taste to it which keeps it interesting"
"But what can I say? I'm a sucker for zestful, tart, refreshing saisons. I would go so far as to consider them one of my fondest of all styles of beer. And the masterpiece that is Sofie just became one of my favourites. Like the last few Goose Island bombers I've had, I wish I had a full case of it. I'd stash this one away for those perfect summer afternoons."
"Tastes way hotter than the 6.5% it is. Solid beer for what it is but not really in my wheelhouse."
"O - I'm very pleased with this offering. I'll buy again and stock up on some to age."
"Everything about this beer is bright, crisp and refreshing. The appearance is a pretty straw color--cloudy and bubbly. It smells like spring to me, with the obvious citrus aroma but also a hint of grass. The taste includes orange and yeast. The beer dances on the tongue with good carbonation."
"Great beer!"
"D - I like this brew, one you can have a couple glasses of without it getting old. Another good offering from the folks at Goose Island."
"D: This style usually isn't my cup of tea but this is an excellent beer, would buy this again."
"Cheers."
"D - very drinkable see this being far too easy to put away on a nice warm day."
"Very drinkable, thanks Goose Island!"
"D-The carbonation is almost a little too much for my taste and I feel gets in the way of the flavor profile a little. I can't wait to see what this is like in a year or two."
"D:"
"Taste is very nice, orange, apple, some malt, pepper and I noted some vanilla as well. MF is a medium and finishes nice and crisp. Drinkability is very good in this offering from Goose Island, a great saison."
"D -- A beer to try, worth a purchase and a repeat."
"Drinkability is good and I liked it."
"Drinkability: A very tasty and easy-drinking beer. It's one that I'll definitely pick up again the next time I see it, and I definitely recommend it to anybody that can score a bottle. Cheers!"
"This beverage was crisp, tingly, and had a little warmth from the alcohol. Excellent drinkability as it was tasty, crisp, and enjoyable."
"pours a very light yellow color with intense carbonation and large head. appears almost champagne-like. Very clear. Head holds very nicely with decent lacing. Loses points as color looks slightly like urine. Smell is nice, with belgian yeasts and slight citric notes. Tiny hint of funk but not a lot. Lots of fruitiness going on here. The taste is awesome, and although appears dry upfront has nice sweetness in the background that tastes almost juicelike. Great mouthfeel when you take into account the combination of the zip from the carbonation and lack of mouth-coating which gives this brew a very clean feel to it. Drinkability is high, I can't believe it took me this long to try this one."
"This seems entirely more like some sort of ""Belgian pale ale"" than a Saison. Pours a lightly hazy blonde with a slightly loose great big head that leaves plenty of lace. The aroma is lots of pineapple, some bubblegum, some farmyard, and some fresh hops. The flavor is dry and hoppy and spicy and features notes of citrus, some tartness, some pineapple, lemon rind, non descript fruit, some pineyness, and some bubblegum. The beer is very well balanced between fruity flavors, funky flavors, and a remarkable dryness. The palate is sharp and the carbonation level is perfect on the tongue."
"Pricing: $4.10 for a single 12 oz bottle. Not worth that kind of money in my opinion."
"2009 Vintage. Pours a slightly hazy golden yellow with a generous white head. It produces a wonderful aroma. Dominated by that familiar wheaty/spicy belgina yeast. Also some orange peel aromas as well as a sweet white wine such as a riesling.. It's aroma leads you to the complex flavor. At first a tart, citrusy flavor, and follows with some sweeter oaky, vanilla flavors. Drinks very much like a wine. Light to medium body with fizzy carbonation and snappy finish. Not my preferred style but a pretty good Saison in my opinion."
"drinks very easily. overall a citrusy and winey saison. the mouthfeel was the highlight for me. im definatly glad for having tryed this. i would recommend it."
"Drinkability: This is great stuff. When I first smelled and tasted it, I thought I would regret their decision to age it on orange peel, but I stand corrected. The bitter orange integrates well. The Brett character is subtle, even after 7 months in the bottle. Very easy to drink, hard to drink slow."
"Drinks great. A terrific beer in every respect."
"Some nice flavors going on and I appreciate that the balance is skewed to the less sweet, more funky side while remaining quite drinkable, light, and refreshing. However, the flavors don't exactly have the ""wow"" factor that will make me rush revisit this particular brew (unlike Goose Island's Matilda, etc.)."
"Drinkability: I could drink several of these beers in one time. Nice beer! Not very common that I drink this style of beer, but i will consider it more often after drinking this beer from Goose Island. A nice offering from Shytown!"
"The mouthfeel of this is nicely carbonated that gives a smidgen of resistance as you drink. I like it. It's a good, firm body to uphold the flavor and it's an all around amazing drink at a very affordable price. I would highly recommend drinking this beer. It's by Goose Island, a brewery I love for their consistent quality. They are part of what makes living in the Midwest great. Find this beer and drink it if you haven't already, or if you're like me, revisit an old friend."
"D - A nice slightly heavy handed Saison... Definately ""Americanized..."" Goose Island continues to impress... Not my favorite Saison, and not my favorite American version either, but one I would drink again in the future none the less..."
"Delicious! Very expensive at my grocery store ($10!) but nearly worth it. Kind of sour and very belgian. Hints of orange. The color was a bright gold. The head was chunky but ample. The mouthfeel was effervescent and highly delicious. I like this one much better than Matilda which is also a Goose Island reserve. The labels themselves were beautiful."
"Very interesting beer to say the least. This is really a beautiful beer in appearance and smell. It smells like grapefruit-orange, flower candy with a hint of the saison barn. The look is a lovely golden hue, giving great head. The taste is a bit sour and dry. I would prefer less carbination and a bit more sweetness, but that is totally my individual taste (I love tripels) and all the saisons share these characteristics. This would probably be one of my favorite beers if they made this in tripel form. But, lovely, complex and wonderful how it is. A must for saison lovers."
"I am reminded of a farmer, sitting in a barn atop a hay bale, peeling an orange with his feet, sipping wine. Plenty going on here, big time orange flavor. As it opens up it's got more of the barnyard going on. Originally I thought there was too much orange in this, but honestly, after sitting out and open for a couple days, I like it even better. Still has its carbonation, stains dripping down on the glass, the barn door left open this time, obscuring the orange trees. A little on the sticky side, a pretty good finish if you like the orange saison combo."
"Overall very good."
"Drinkability: One element that Goose Island usually gets right, and Sofie is no exception."
"Overall: A different beer than I am used to. A nice representation of what a Saison is described as being. A solid GI attempt to expand their roster to incorporate some Belgian styles."
"Like sparkling wine with orange essence."
"d- really nice, this is a nice little spin on classic saison, the orange adds a bit to it, it's nice and drinkable. maybe not something i'd seek out again - as i don't regularly drink saisons, but really glad to have tried it."
"D: Goes down very smooth and clean, making it very drinkable and refreshing."
"drinkability - This is a good beer, and could definately have more than 2 in a sitting due to it's light texture and smooth overtones."
"D - This one is fairly easy to drink, just dont know how many of these I could drink. Not my favorite style but a good beer nonetheless. A good tweener beer that refreshed and cleaned the palette. Now ready for another."
"The taste is great as well. Lots of flavor and yeastiness. Orange peel, citrus sweetness balanced against the sharp, crisp yeast character. The mouthfeel is good, light bodied beer with adequate carbonation. Smooth to drink, dry finish and aftertaste. Some very mild pepper notes, but didn't have the full peppery spiciness like some other saisons, but that's not neccesarily a bad thing, more Belgian Pale ale. Very drinkable."
"D - I could have a fair amount of this. It's missing some of the better saison characteristics I look for but it's still a quality brew."
"D: This brew was the pleasant surprise of the trip to GI, I went there focusing on Bourbon County Stout and walked away loving this one as well. As usual, the fellow reviewers were spot on with the recommendation and this a rock star brew. This really was a bit of a blend of styles as it has strong Wit and Saison tendencies, but in the end, it's just a great brew. GI should be proud of their Belgian lineup as it really shows their width of expertise. Find this brew and give it a try, you won't regret it."
"Sofie is bright and clear with champagne-esque carbonation and a nice tight fluffy white head. When the sediment is poured out at the end, the beer gets a little cloudy. The beer has a lot of elements of a belgian wit, with a great yeasty character and a hint of the wine from the wine barrel aging. The wine is much more prominent in the taste with a good yeasty backbone. The orange peel is also very nice. The carbonation is very lively and it gives the beer a very light mouthfeel. I would love to have these on hand all the time. It is a really nice saison, and the wine really complements the saison yeast profile."
"D - Overall a very good Belgian Style Ale, I'm quite a fan of the Saison style of beers so this was definitely a winner; pleased with the work that Goose Island put into their high class line of beer; could have a few of these with a nice plate of food"
"D- Very easy to drink and enjoy. This beer has nice complexity but I could see myself drink as many as 5 or 6 on a hot summer day if I had enough. This is a new favorite that I will be stocking up on!"
"d- I really am enjoying this beer. Tons of Earthiness and depth"
"This is one of my all time favorite beers... I've enjoyed it many times... and hope to enjoy it for many more years to come."
"D- The abv is a little high and the carbonation really bothers me. So overall the taste is nice it looks nice and smells nice. But just doesn't sit and go down so nice."
"Notes: an exceptional Belgian style from the US. Reminds me of Duvel, but I like it better. Very easy drinking, my first farmhouse ale. A relatively expensive pint, but was well worth it (like six bucks and some change). Would go well with some aged gouda and crackers, or garlic pork loin, coq au vin, or other fancy shit."
"Wow, this is so much better than I expected. Nothing I can find to take away from this. A small ding for not being able to pour it reasonable at first. That's it. Each drink leaves you yearning for the next one. First great beer of 2011."
"Very drinkable in the right situation. It was enjoyable today, but would be better on a warmer day instead of a snowy day. Probably should have saved this for summer, but it kept staring at me and I just had to give it a try."
"This was my first beer from Goose island and I look forward to trying many others."
"D: Light, refreshing, and extremely drinkable (gulp-able even)! I'm glad I still have one of these in my cellar."
"Good stuff. Mild farmhouse flavor and rather drinkable."
"My only complaint: I wish it was available in a sixer or a four banger."
"Hazy golden color-very carbonated but the head drops in the time I get from the counter to the chair. great aroma-somewhat of a musty and grassy scent. Hop spiciness and a moderate earthy funk. Wonderful sweet and malty/wheat flavor. Musty and funkified grassiness for sure. As earthy and deep as the flavor is it is quite clean and crisp. Very distinct lemon/lime quality. Very effervescent and lively mouthfeel. An amazing beer-so much going on in a small bottle and package. I bet this would really develop over time. Call it a funkified saison-call it damn good."
"Owing to its outward crispiness and bursts of citrus it may not be the kind of beer to enjoy over an extended session. I only had one bottle and was quite satisfied by the end of it, with no desire to keep going. But a single bottle of it is quite an experience."
"Drinkability: A bit like a saison/wit/wild ale combination, this is a signature ale for Goose Island's Belgian chops"
"Drinkability: Another great one from Goose Island's foray into Belgian styles. Very enjoyable and certainly one to revisit frequently."
"Aside from the carbonation issue, this is an awesome beer. I could drink and have drank a shit ton of this."
"I have always been a fan of Sofie, but cracking this 2 year old bottle today was like my first time drinking it. The age did tremendous things to the aroma and flavor. Adding complexity, intensifying the musty/funky character of the beer and somewhat subduing the slightly over-sweet flavors of a fresh Sofie."
"Fuller medium body, higher carbonation, some lingering dryness. Alcohol is masked completely, a really refreshing and enjoyable saison from top to bottom."
"Overall, a good beer and quite drinkable."
"Poured from the bottle a nice hazy golden yellow with active yeast present, the head was extremely aggresive for a soft pour and formed a quick thick white rocky pillowy head that did not recede untill into the beer. Smell is nice and sweet,lemon herb grassy notes perhaps some pear and a earthy yeast funk. Taste is bright citrus lemons, pears up front witha a quick twang of spiceness and a bright active carbonation to make this one lively beer. Mouthfeel is smooth but not creamy very light and active. I was left wanting more of this beer, very solid saison from Goose Island!"
"This is a fascinating beer. Part saison, part wild ale, spicing of a wit. Alot of thought went into this one and it's appreciated."
"D- Sofie has amazing flavor and taste. This is a great brew taht you can be drank all the time. This is a fabulous farmhouse ale with all the components you can ask for. SOOO GOOODDD"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Pretty light on mouthfeel with quite a bit of fine carbonation. Very crisp tasting. Drinkability is very high, this is a damn tasty beer. I was pumped the hotel pub had this on tap in Minneapolis. Good stuff."
"d - A pretty nice saison. I didn't feel like there was much brett in the taste but definitely saw some in the nose. An easy drinking saison I would try again."
"Bottle. Poured into a chalice a slightly hazy straw yellow color with a nice fluffy white head. Nice lace as the head settles. The aroma is that of straw, lemon, grass, orange, and very mild barnyard. The mouthfeel is light and refreshing. The citrus really come out in the flavor and are nice followed with some mild bitterness. Some floral type flavors as well. Nice wine like notes as well. A very solid, slightly wild beer that is pleasant to drink."
"Drinkability is very high as long as you're a fan of the barnyard funkiness."
"I had the 2010 version of this delicious ale. I poured it into a mug, and it produce a big fluffy white head which took a while to dissipate. The color was straw like, and slightly murky. The smell was an earthy/citrus combo. The taste was that of slightly sour lemon/citrus, lightly hopped, and it has fairly high carbonation. Would definitely buy again."
"A must-try."
"This is a perfect farmhouse / saison. Tart and crisp with enough funk to keep it interesting. I think this is a great way to end an early September evening. I sure wish Goose Island was available in PA, because I would be sure to pick this one up again."
"D: Could thoroughly enjoy this any time of year, but this would be amazing on a warm summer day."
"Got to try this head-to-head against the style prototype, Saison Dupont, the the Goose Island beer academy held in Bowling Green, KY. Close call here. The Sofie was a touch fuller and a bit of fruit, whereas the Dupont was just a little drier and more funk. I would happily drink either, and cudos to Goose Island for this close interpretation."
"Gold with beautiful carbonation and a nice head, this smells like white grapes, yeast, pepper, and orange peel, and the taste follows nicely. Lots of lovely citrus, lots of identifiably Belgian yeast, some coriander and clove, a little bit of pepper, all balanced to make a really light, quaffable, amazing beer. This is a home run."
"A clear straw yellow with a pure white head fizzing and popping like a newly opened 2ltr of soda. A tiny amount of sediment on the bottom of the bottle that sweeps up easily. Pouring in the sediment gives the beer a much more wheat beer appearance. Smells malty like a wheat beer. The flavor is really sweet akin to a triple. Some good hay flavors in there as well. One of the first Saisons I've really appreciated. Cheers."
"D: kept going back to the glass, so yeah."
"Cheers..."
"Overall: This is an excellent brew! Its full of fresh, crisp flavour and hides its alcohol beautifully. The lemon and wine flavours add another dimension to an already exceptional brew. Another home run from Goose Island."
"D: This is excellent. As good and complex as any wine."
"D. This is a really good brew, the label states 80% Belgian style ale blended with 20% Belgian style ale aged in wine barerels with orange peel."
"Taste begins with moderate pale sweetness, spiciness int he middle, and a crisp hoppy close. Light sour flavor lingers. Mouthfeel is small-bubbled and soft over the tongue, with easy drinkability. Nice brew."
"A complex and sessionable Saison that's spot on for the Farmhouse Ale style."
"Have been trying a lot of saision stylea : Bam Biere, Devotion, Helios, Stillwater. This rises to the top. For an american made Saison."
"D - flows down easily"
"Overall - Sofie is my paramour, and I'll care for her all the long days of my life."
"Mouthfeel :: Dry. Effervescent. Clean."
"Notes: Very nice and enjoyable beer. Complex and balanced drink that had some nice funky/barnyard aspects of a saison, but it had some other flavor aspects that were similar to a Chardonnay, a biere de garde, and some BSPA aspects as well. It definitely had a nice Belgian flavor though. Funk, fruitiness, grassiness, grape, and sweetness all present. And that woody/vanilla flavor just steps it up more. Definitely worth a try and is a great beer."
"This is a topnotch farmhouse ale, best American stab at the style I've enjoyed to date. I would love to have a few bottles of this to age, as I think some time would really develop a pastoral character that this one could use in matching some of the better Belgian examples. Hats off to Goose Island for an excellent effort here."
"Like champagne. Too much is not recommended. It is a beer to limit, and love."
"Goose island Sofie is a great farmhouse, a perfect companion for Black Sparrow's Pub Burger: tart and assertive, it was not aggressive or over-the-top. It's a great saisson and represents the stye and Goose Island very well. Thanks for great beer!"
"D - This is an excellent saison and one of the best commercial examples that I've had this side or that side of the water. Goose Island makes some pretty good 'specials' and this is no exception."
"Overall a zesty and complex saison."
"I'm a huge fan of this beer. I plan on rereviewing this beer after cellaring it for a year or two. I am hoping it gets a little funkier, but I love the experience of it when it is young as well. Goose once again delivers with their Belgian line beers."
"d 4.5 this one makes sense as a beginner's saison, but even though sofie is not very challenging there is a certain grace about it that continues to please."
"Overall- This beer doesnt really fit into any category. It is a suprisingly complex belgian style ale. Very good."
"The beer pours a hazy pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a light and fruity pale malt scent along with a touch of orange peel and Belgian yeast esters. It's incredibly complex with a light wine barrel aging character as well. The taste is great as well. It's light and quaffable, but with tons of flavor and yeast character. It goes down so easy and finishes dry with bits of orange peel and citrus. Wow, what an incredibly drinkable beer. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a masterpiece of a Belgian pale. It's smooth as hell and so tasty. Good work Goose Island."
"Pours super-pale yellow, almost green (on 2nd pour, a darker yellow..) with a big white head. Little carbonation. Smell is a cavalcade of flowers, fruits and spicy herbs. A potpurri, if you will. First taste is pleasantly sour and rather wine/champagne like. It tastes like a rustic crafts store on a breezy day. Feels like the finish should be dryer than it is, but it's not. A pleasing and bitter herbal twist kicks into gear and dominates the aftertaste. A good and very unique brew. Kudos to GI for making some interesting sh*t!"
"I poured a 12oz bottle dated in late March. It poured a light, straw yellow with a hint of light orange to it with a billowing white head. It smells delicious, a nice blend of yeast and citrus aromas with light sweetness. It tastes excellent as well. Once again, a great mix of breadyness and citrus flavors with a subtle sweetness. It drank very crisp and didn't lose any carbonation in it's six months after being bottled. This one is very, very drinkable and delicious on tap or out of the bottle. I can't wait to try this one aged."
"A two thumbs up for Goose Island Sofie!"
"Sofie was pale yellow and hazy. It had a towering white fluffy head with good retention and lacing. The smell was yeasty with some citrus. The taste was spice upfront with some citrus (mainly orange) flavors, more spice, wheat, and yeast coming through later. The finish was dry and lingering. The mouthfeel was good; with a medium body and medium-high carbonation. Drinkability was very good. Overall it was a very good beer and I would recommend it to anyone liking the style."
"Wow! Goose Island really outdid themselves with Sofie. It is simply an excellent Saison that damn near passes for an authentic, Belgian brewed beer. It really doesn't have any shortcomings to discuss. It's extremely impressive in every respect. Do yourself a huge favor and go find a bottle. This is really great stuff."
"Sofie 2010 - After having this from bottle and few times and loving it, I found it on tap multiple times while traveling. I began to crave this throughout the summer. So refreshing. Showed great complexity from smell to taste. Nothing ever stuck out too much. Sometimes I notice pepper, sometimes citrus/banana & sometimes a bit of funk. Amazing drinkability without sacrificing intrigue."
"D- I'd give it a 8/10. Just a good beer filled with flavors that are usually kept to specialty brews (i.e. Guava) really interesting brew. have one, gotta love G.I."
"Wow! This is one of those backyard beers that I've seen quite a bit of but never tried. Really happy to have had the choice... it feels like this beer would be an excellent choice for a spicy food pairing."
"Very balanced and the hopping lends some great fruit and grass qualities. I'm not really tasting a Saison here, but a very tasty Belgian pale."
"As part of such a fun BIF reviews are just part of the game. Unfortunately, this was not one that I preferred. Thanks to Jamnescameron for taking the time to include this one but my personal tastes didn't jive with it."
"D: Not quite session-able, but you could if you were using 5-oz tasters. Maybe it's the two other beers I had before drinking this one, but I'd only have one of them. If I could buy these where I live, I'd stock up on them!"
"D: Pleasant and Refreshing all the way down."
"D: Wonderful saison. I'm not super familiar with Goose Island's beers, but if they're all like this then they'll have a customer for life."
"Drinkability: This one disappears, one of the best, if not the best, american saisons and possibly one of the top two goose island offerings. I need to get a few more of these"
"Notes: I am really into this beer which for me seems to blur the lines between the Witt Bier and the Saison/Farmhouse styles."
"Edit (3/29/11): Trying a bottle of from 12/11/09 to see how it ages. Seems a little tired, honestly. Not better for the age. Maybe a 5 year bottle is good? Who knows..."
"D: really nice and enjoyed by all. Is on tap in my area right now & I will try to seek out."
"Note: For me this is not as refreshing as most saisons."
"D: Drinkability scores above average. This is an excellent after dinner treat, or a refreshing treat on a hot day."
"Tastes bret edgy with some tangy sour and clovey phenol. Wet malt underneath with some pear esters. While light bodied, there is a dextrinous thickness when sloshed around in the mouth. Pretty simple nad the brett is distracting overall, rather than complementing."
"For me this beer is perfectly balanced and a pleasure to drink...My only complaint is the time it takes for the head to fall enough so I can take a drink."
"The body was crisp, bordering on effervescent. Finish was mild. Tame white peppery spiciness right off the bat, followed by a wash of tart fruits, and capped off with a mild funky yeast quality. Flavors really meld together well. So glad I've got another one of these away for later. Really standout offering here. Drinkability is lowered, as this needs to be savored. I'd find no problem splitting this with good friends. Highly recommend."
"D: Pretty good."
"Tate is bready, malty and wheaty. It's nice and sweet with kind of a latex banana taste. Still very rich mouthfeel and nice fruitiness."
"Overall a quality saison that I found to be very enjoyable and quaffable. This is a wonderful beer that I highly recommend."
"Overall: I was very pleased with Sofie. Though I've never had a bad beer from Goose Island specifically, in general I've found limited bombers from craft breweries - particularly non-Belgian breweries producing limited run Belgian ales - to be hit or miss. But Sofie was right on the money. Very enjoyable."
"D: good, but nothing to write home about. I admire the fidelity to the style, I just wish that this had a little something more"
"Beer is quite tart, mild fruitiness in the midpalate. No sweetness up front. Beer is medium to light in body and the carbonation is low on the palate, just like in the glass. Beer is kind of boring, not boring just plain. Its a very mild wild ale. Overall its OK."
"mouthfeel is fairly creamy and the body is great, very very drinkable"
"D - a fabulous sipper, full of class and character. I love Goose Island and their devotion to quality and tradition, and this one reeks of both attributes"
"A bright shade of yellow, hazy, and a 1/2"" head forms then quickly subsides; Sharp aroma with a slight mineral quality, slight wild funk, and lemon tarts; let down I'm not getting more of those Amarillo hops, but this was bottled back in February; Taste is great, and each sip seems to expand in the mouth from the high level of carbonation; bright and sharp flavors of citrus with a lovely bready and yeasty finish; the Brett is adding to the mix, providing a nice undercurrent of that unique flavor; I didn't pick up wine barrel aging qualities, but I wasn't aware of them at the time and not looking for those qualities; I could have easily drank two or three glasses of this in one sitting. Really good."
"M&D - medium bodied, a bit harsh, needs some age which is what the rest of the four pack will get and at that time this review will get an edit"
"Overall, a nice crisp, funky saison that nicely balanced. Light yet suitably complex. An enjoyable drinking experience. Can get a little boring at times though. Still recommended."
"Huge head on this beer. Just nice drinking and well done. The nose is very, very mild and the appearance is pale gold and cloudy. The taste is just solid and light and fruity. No specirfic taste to me just a very well structured belgian."
"Certain Belgian styles can be butchered by American breweries, but this is on par if not better than the originals."
"I had this on draft recently at Rattle and Hum and felt pretty much the same way, possibly finding it ever better than the first time. Color and aroma were pretty much the same but i think it was even nicer tasting and had even better carbonation and belgian lacing."
"Overall a very good light Belgian style ale that packs a punch. This is the best Belgian style beer I have had from Goose Island. Worth trying."
"D: Very good. I'd order another."
"Drinkability: Pretty easy drinking and those who like Saison's should find this an interesting interpretation from GI."
"This is nuts. I've been attentively drinking beer for 6 years now, and I've never encountered one that was so different between the tap and the bottle. And it's not a matter of me not remembering the bottled version or the vintage being different or anything--I've had several bottles of both the 09 and 2010 Sofie, and all were spectacular."
"My favorite beer for these 100+ degree days we have been having. Just a top notch beer in every way!"
"M/D: Light carbonation, carbonation fairly high. Drinkability is pretty good. A very good beer overall."
"D: Delicious sipping beer. It was highly recommended by the server. I also would recommend it."
"Drinkability -- This is a really exceptional saison. Light, bright, and mild fruit sweetness. Now I'm kicking myself for passing on this so many times before."
"D - I could not stop drinking this beauty, seriously great beer here."
"D - This is a good easy drinking saison with a good taste its going to be easy finishing off the bomber myself worth picking up sometime"
"This is very drinkable, I ordered two at the bar in between other beers. Had we not come as close to closing time I'd likely have had a third. The only thing detracting for me was the high carbonation which made each subsequent glass slightly tougher to find room for."
"This beer pours a cloudy yellow color. The head is one inch of rocky foam that recedes slowly into sticky lacing. The aroma is of barnyard, leather, horse blanket, lemon peel, and herbs. This is a very complex smelling beer. The taste is similar to the aroma with tons of barnyard funk, and enough lemon and citrus to add some balance. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with appropriately high carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is one of the best saisions I have ever had. I will be drinking this beer regularly."
"Drinkability: This is good beer, and apart from the disappointment in the pour, one that doesn't disappoint. It is, however, $7-8 a bottle. Hennepin is an equally good ale, for $2-3 less. Yes, that IS a selling point. At Sofie's price, I'd rather just drink Belgian ale from BELGIUM. Worth a try, esp. for a session, but it probably won't find it's way to my glass often unless the price drops."
"D. This is extremely drinkable. I think Goose Island does Belgians very well, and this is no exception. Saison is one of my favorite styles and this one is damn good."
"Beer poured a straw color with a huge white head that has mostly dissapated. Nose is a nice note of light fruits. Taste is light fruits, some citrus, and a hint of pepper. Midway thru the glass i am getting a bit of tartness. Mouthfeel is classic Belgian yeast strain, light and smooth and very refreshing. Drinkability is very good. This is a very nice beer, some complexity to it yet very easy to drink. Glad to have tried."
"Light hazy straw yellow golden with a small white head that dissipates to a film but leaves good lacing. Aromas are zest, but incredibly faint. Refreshing but I need more time to figure out what else is there. Flavors are refreshing and so saison-y. Lots of citrus, wheat, and general happiness. Emphasis though is on the sugary lemon sweetness. It's almost a little too much for me. Medium carb, relatively thin mouthfeel. I'm slightly disappointed here, but am looking forward to trying this in a bottle."
"Overall this was a nice and well-defined beer. Well worth a shot."
"Taste is well balanced - a little funk, a little sour etc.. Not as much going on as Hennepin but still a very nice saison. I Will certainly buy again, great summer drinker."
"Lovely and unique Belgian inspired ale here - as others have noted, it brings to mind a Tripel at least as much as a Saison, so it isn't perfectly to style. Wish I'd bought a few more bottles to age, as the ""wild"" yeasts taste anything but at present and I'm curious what it will turn into over time..."
"Pours a nice yellow sunlight color with a restrained head. Slows little lacing swell but does have a glowing profile. Aroma is very acidic and refreshing. Lemon grass, grapefruit, orange rind and some melon sweetness comes through. Really beautiful. Has a nice lemony flavor with some astringent chemical back notes in a good way. Really refreshing and thirst quenching. Also has a Meyer lemon like sweetness that really is enjoyable. Really, this is the most refreshing saison I have had to date. Big acidic profile and a really nice balance with sweetness. Love drinking this and I am glad that it is a bomber tonight."
"D: A really solid brew. I enjoyed the balance between citrus, bitter, and sour in the flavor greatly. Give this one a try."
"drinkability - full flavored, excellent saison, couldn't get enough"
"Many tastes compiled here. 'Tis a dry, tart, sparkling ale with a bit too much carbonation, maybe the barrel aging and addition of orange peel push this toward the witbier style, without the wheat component. It's an odd saison, with a spiciness and fruitiness and goes outside the style bounds. Creamy finish does not save this, as a staple from the brewery I have to say look elsewhere."
"Overall- a nice Saison with unique character, I tasted a nice mix of flavors on the profile, more than I usually get from the style. Overall a successful beer."
"Crisp, bubbly body with a healthy dose of wheat and pale malts. Farmhouse funk is subdued but present, despite the fact that orange peel and floral hops get in the way mid-sip. Finish is crisp and bubbly with a wine spritzer-like quality and flash of white grapes. Mouthfeel is superb, with a perfect carbonation level to complement the medium consistency and clean, bitter finish. Leaves me wanting another sip with ease. All in all, a tasty Belgian from the talented Goose Island staff. Wish I had another Sofie to see how this beer ages..."
"Pours a clean yellow color with a nice white head. In the aroma, candy sugar, and white grape small tartness. In the taste, a bit sugary and balanced with a dry yeast, with a white grape tartness all the way through. A sooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, and a semi dry white grape aftertaste. A little tart, nice flavor and easy to drink."
"How nice, they named a beer after my cat! (Spelled it wrong though). anyhoo. This brew pours out looking a whole lot like champagne, as advertised. Pale yellow with a lot of bubbles! Lacy white head turns spongy but hangs around for a while. The aroma is light and citrus lemon. The flavor is tart and citrus also, with a very nice mouthfeel. Smooth and drinkable, but after a while the tartness got to me a bit. Still, this is a very decent summer drinker."
"D- Very easy to drink, great quality brew for sure."
"D: Very drinkable."
"Apparently the Goose has released some more on tap and its just as enjoyable as this bomber."
"Pale gold and hazy in colour. Frothy white head that has a bit of retention but doesn't really stick. Smells of bready pils malt, peachy/citrusy hops, and peppery spice complemented by subtle barnyard funk. In some way it reminds me of the aged manure we were given for our garden by a local farmer this spring. The aroma has a real subtlety and depth to it. Citrus hop flavour is enhanced by the addition of orange peel while the beer is aging in the barrel. Mild lemony tartness goes well with that citrus flavour. A light dusting of pepper is followed by a mild bitterness in the finish. Light-bodied and dry with loads of fine carbonation. Feels soft and velvety, like the mousse of champagne. A refined, elegant, classy beer full of comple subtelty. Delicious."
"D: This is a really good beer. I wish I had this on a hot Summer's day instead of drinking it now at night. I would seek this out again. Good job GI."
"This drank great, even at 4 months in the bottle, sofie just displays a small amount of brett/funk and a different type of saison. The wine is light but it is there. I like where they took this, another great 'Belgian' from GI. Will get more."
"The flavor brought a little bit of funk in the first sip. Some spice swirls around in this one, mostly clove. There is some definite fruitiness going on, orange, melon, and citrus. The malt flavor is light and clean. The alcohol the sweetness and the fruity flavors become a touch tiresome in this beer as my only major complaint, especially when I'm expecting something snappier and more lively. The body was on the lighter side and the carbonation was appropriate."
"Price = ?"
"Bottled 02/19/10. Label says orange peel, which is subtle enough that you don't notice the specific flavor. I wish somebody would brew a good Saison style like this and put it in cans at a reasonable price. How about a Stella Artois brand-- they could call it Daisy Mae."
"Though not out of this world, the price is definitely right!"
"The color of this Belgian Style Ale when poured was a hazy medium golden yellow, with little white foam and a nice amount of lace on the side of the glass. The smell of fruit, yeast and spices filled the nose with a pleasant aroma. The taste had a touch of citrus fruit (lemon and orange),and spice (coriander), was nicely balanced. The carbonation put a nice finish to this Belgian Ale."
"Drink: Easily drinkable and I guess a reatreat on a hot, humid summer afternoon."
"My house is currently 83 degrees and this is just what I needed for refreshment. This bomber will go down like a 12 oz and I'll be wanting more I'm sure."
"D- very drinkable, yet not my favorite belguim style."
"Very good farmhouse ale!"
"D: A good drinker."
"Part of my summer saison saturday seris, ha! sofie is a ""barrel aged"" saison brewed with brett. It pours a hazy yellow with an initially puffy white head that subsides into a thin white ring. Could be because this is a plan old glass. No lacing but again could be the glass. Smells soft, flowery and yeasty. Can't detect any barrel or brett. The flavor is typical of a basic saison, maybe a little more depth. Black pepper, cloves and clover honey is what I taste from the yeast. Grassy noble hops and basic malt backbone. Smooth luxorious mouth feel, coats the tongue. Could be a bit drier for a saison. This beer is better the second time around when you know what you are in for."
"O: Very good beer. Maybe just a tad too sour. Not everyone will love this brew due to its distinctive flavor, but I do!"
"Fairly straightforward for the style, but excellently crafted and almost to the template."
"Can't say I'm a huge fan but there's a lot of flavour here that doesn't overwhelm the palate, quite drinkable."
"I much prefer the bottled version of Sofie but this draught version is no slouch. You won't be disappointed that you ordered it. A great Summer option."
"D: A realy goo beer. Mild and less complexity relative to some farmhouse ales."
"A very good brew that's sweet yet complex, light and refreshing, easy to drink and a very good beer overall that's very tasty. I recommend this beer as it was quite enjoyable."
"It's a nice brew, and a very drinkable one. I'm unconvinced this should be classified a Saison as it is here - it doesn't have quite the acidity or rugged musty organic characters - but it's a light, refreshing and enjoyable pale Belgian style ale."
"The thing I absolutely love about this beer is the balance of flavors. Sweet, tart, dry, fruity, wow! This is a fantastic beer! I absolutely love it. I'm not sure I'd call it a Saison though...."
"I recognize that Farmhouse Ale is a broad description that leaves a lot of room for interpretation, but this feels more like a BSPA to me. Don't get me wrong this is a good beer and I am certainly enjoying it, but I couldn't help deduct a little here and there when keeping style in mind. Farmhouse Ale or otherwise, I found Sofie to be a solid beer, but nothing special. Regardless, I'm glad I had the opportunity to try this and I'd pick it up again if it was available to me."
"The palate is quite a bit better, with a light floral and orange blossom honey sweetness opening things off, with a refreshing cracker character. Spice comes through mid-palate, with the yeast shining with light pepper, , a little clove and a touch of lemon and grassy hop character, delicate and light. Drying on the finish, this beer has a wonderful light body that's got just enough heft, quite wheaty, and a delicate, drying finish. This is where the Brett comes through, mildly barnyardy, mildly bandaid like, and a touch spicy. It definitely isn't as prominent as it is on the nose, something that I find surprising. With a high carbonation, this never gets to be taxing on the palate. Thoroughly drinkable on a day like today. Not the driest saison out there, but very, very good."
"D - a bit too tart, and a bit too one dimensional"
"pours a hazy light yellow with a nice but not fluffy white head that leaves some sticky lacing on glass..i smell clove, coriander, lemon,yeast ,other fruits and spices..its nice..taste is better nice clove and yeast hit followed by waves of fruits like apples bananas and pears.. maybe a hint of pepper and a pale malt finish its delicious and well balanced..mouth feel is flavorful but light on the palate..very drinkable very smooth and creamy and refreshing..will buy more of this...big recommendation for this one"
"Drinkability: very good saison. Worth seeking out."
"Sofie is a fun Saison that is a joy to drink. Expertly balanced, imminently drinkable. This is a good bottle of Saison, but it is not a great one. Other brands take the style to another level with their depth of flavors. Perhaps Sofie is a little too delicate. Still, this was a beautiful bottle to enjoy on a hot June day."
"Soft and fluffy on the palate, delicate but wonderfully flavored. Slight tang from the wine barrels. Nice, spicy Belgian yeast strain that is good, but not overly funky or farmhouse. Citrus peel flavors are quite prominent and I might like them dialed down a bit. Grassy hops sharpen the contrasts of the yeast to the grainy malts to the barrel aged notes. Light alcohol sting, complex and very tasty. Would love to pick up some more of this sometime and try it with a touch of age on it."
"D: good saison from goose island that made me want more after the beer was gone. I hope I can get my hands on more of this brew."
"Mouthfeel is light and delicate. The carbonation is tight and soft at the same time. Excellent summer weather beer, and just excellent beer all around. I want a lot more, right now."
"D-this is pretty darn tasty with a good balance of sweet and toasted malt, I really enjoy this and love the thick chewy body."
"A super drinkable beer and the equal of Hennepin. Only area this is inferior is head size. Still a damn tasty beer and one I do recommend."
"D - This is a walk-off grand slam for Goose Island. An amazing Saison, and hugely recommendable. Also, this pairs as well with most food as any brew I know of."
"Mouthfeel was medium in body with plenty of zest, finished smooth. Spot on appropriate in the feel/texture."
"Beautiful pour with a slightly hazy golden beer and a pure white, pillowy head that is refreshed by a constant steram of bubbles. The aroma is gentle and tangy with green apples, grass, and some very light coriander and clove. Very creamy with more of that light apple found in the aroma appearing on the tongue along with some smooth, light graininess and fresh straw. Beautifully balanced and on the creamy rather than crisp side for a saison. Beautiful beer that I could drink all day."
"Drinkability- I really enjoyed this. It was really refreshing after a long day of doing stuff for my wedding. It hit the spot."
"Mouthfeel is light-medium"
"Poured from a 341ml bottle into a tulip, bottle courtesy of AJacob81! Beer is a blended saison, 80% belgian yeast and 20% of it aged in oak barrels with orange peels and Brett. Excited! Pours a pale orange, with a huge fluffy, billowing head (maybe 2 1/2 fingers at least) which settled to a nice thin layer with great retention and webbed lacing. Smell from the bottle was initially very citrusy and fresh, and was quite the same when poured. Very floral, citrusy (lemons, orange) and a touch of spice. Taste is quite similar, crisp, citrusy. Touch of sweetness, and the malt feels quite organic and earthy. Just delightful. High carbonation on this one (initially seen with the head on the pour), but fits the bill just perfect. Highly drinkable, just a great surprise for my first offering from GI!"
"(D)- A solid Saison with all the right stuff. I guess my only wish is that it had a bit more pronounced funk; this one is overall cleaner and has a much fruitier profile. Still tasty though."
"I really enjoyed drinking this, especially in warm weather. I will certainly revisit this one."
"Pours a cloudy, pale yellow color. One inch head of a white color. Great retention and decent lacing. Smells of tart malt, citrus, slight spice, pale hops, sweet malt, and slight wheat. Fits the style of a Saison / Farmhouse Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with a high carbonation level. Tastes of tart malt, citrus, pale hops, slight sweet malt, slight wheat, and a hint of spice. Overall, a good aroma, body, and blend."
"Pretty damn good take on this style. I enjoyed Sofie and would get it again."
"Goose Island hit the nail on the head with this one."
"I'm getting the impression that Goose Island isn't screwing around with their ""reserve beers"". When they go all out, the thought and work show in the beer. Sofie is no exception; great stuff. The only complaint I have with this bottle is that I didn't wait 2 years or so to see how it developed before drinking it. Guess I need to buy more."
"The flavor is a complex mix of spices and slightly fruity banana notes, with grassy earth tones and a slightly tart and crisp finish. It has a light to medium body, with very present carbonation and a dry finish. I could very easily go through a bottle or more of this, especially on a warm summer afternoon such as today. And though my experience in Belgian styles is limited, this is one of my favorite offerings so far."
"Cheers!"
"UPDATE: My initial review needs to be updated. I just tried another batch. This is one of the top Saison type beers I have had. The taste is fresh, crisp, citrus, spicy and well carbonated. The overwhelming nose is gone, which increases the appeal."
"Well it has been quite a while since I have reviewed or tried a Farmhouse Ale/Saison. Typically I pick one up every once in a blue moon, overall this was ok but not close to being as good as some others I have tried."
"D: Could take a few more of these down. A perfect beer for a summer day."
"D: I like a beer with more punch, but this is a quite good Belgian. Perhaps some cellar time would bring out the flavors a bit more. Not too expensive, so I will consider doing just that."
"nice for a farmhouse ale, just missing a little sourness."
"Overall, a very good beer, worth seeking out."
"Not a hugely complex beer, but a really good one. This is like a hoppy, sweeter brettier version of orval. Funk, earthy, citrus, spice, cloves, hops mix the smell and taste together. This beer is a crisp refreshing beer i'd drink this beer all summer long."
"Pours a rather bright golden color with very slight haze, large bubbled head, and tons of lace. Tons of carbonation in this beer that is mesmerizing to watch. Nose has some orange & funky yeasty aromas. On the palate there is a nice citrus flavor with light wheaty malt. Easy drinking and refreshing."
"Pours cloudy gold with a thick white head. Smells of spices and fruits, possibly oranges and ginger. Taste is bitter with a tangy finish. The beer has a pleasantly high amount of effervescence. It goes down pretty easy and is light enough it wont knock most people out in a 3 drinks"
"I burped through my nose. Burning."
"Taste is very refreshing and light. The clove and citrus dominate, but not overwhelmingly so. Almost like a German Weissbier without the banana. I tasted just a hint of vanilla. Alcohol was completely masked. I know G.I. says this can be cellared for up to 5 years, but this is so refreshing, I won't be able to keep them around for very long. I haven't had any other Saisons yet, but from what I've read, this does a good job of being representative of the style."
"D: Very, very pleasant, this would be easy to sit back and drink on a warm afternoon."
"of the best American saisons I've ever had."
"My favorite of Goose Island's Belgian brews so far."
"D: Very drinkable. I only picked up one bottle, but wished I had a couple more."
"D: The saison is moderate strength-wise, but complex enough that I don't mind. Orange peel is a key addition, lifting the beer above most all other saisons that I've had. A beautiful ale."
"Overall this is a great one from Goose Island. This is the quintessential flavor I look for in a Saison."
"This is refreshing as hell and a real winner for the summer heat."
"Taste is frankly complex enough to warrant a higher score, but it helps make this an easy-drinker. And there's nothing wrong with that."
"This is an exceptionally well made Saison and it is true to style. It is exceptionally rare that Goose Island disappoints. I would gladly buy this again, especially to introduce someone to the style. Very enjoyable."
"I could drink a lot more of this if I had it. It just became available in California last week so hopefully I'll be seeing more of it around."
"D - Low ABV, so I could see drinking a few of these (I knew I wanted more after the first, but this is a pricey beer)."
"Lemony, with a strong shot of yeast. Flowery and biting in the swallow. Light hop. Short aftertaste. Neutral mouthfeel. A good saison to try with others."
"This is a wonderful thing, and along with Matilda, proves Goose Island's talents for brewing fine Belgian-style beers. So very easy to kick back with on a beautiful southern California Friday afternoon here at Tranquility Base. Over 'n' out."
"Drinkability is pretty good, this was a really tasty saison. Not sure that I really got anything from the wine barrel aging that was 20% of the blend, and while I think there is brett in this, it's subtle if so. Not a big fan of aged saisons, but this one may develop some secondary characteristics over time, but the 5 years suggested on the label is probably a stretch."
"D-I love belgians so I love this beer. It's got everything I want. For me this is a great example of a Saison without being too crazy."
"d: Just an exceptionally made saison. I would love to be able to find this locally. Thanks again Ed, I've wanted to try this since I first heard about it."
"D: A tasty beer that I really enjoyed. I'll buy this if I see it and I'd certainly drink it again."
"A solid beer, a little bland in my book, i was hoping for a little more orange and chardonnay notes to come through. Very carbonated, great for a hot day."
"Very drinkable. Very enjoyable. Will be interesting what this is like as my other bottles age. I really like the work Goose Island puts into their brews."
"Drinkability is very good. This is an interesting take on the Saison style, but it sure is tasty."
"Mouthfeel is on the lighter side with above average carbonation that is a little sharp on the tongue. Drinkability is good, it's a very nice Belgian ale. It was nicely balanced with some very good flavors."
"Pours a two finger white head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Good carbonation and light-medium bodied. Cloudy light yellow color. Nose is citrus. Flavor is sweet and sour citrus, hints of yeast. Good summer beer. Bottled 12/11/2009. $8.45 for a 22oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA."
"It's got some nice qualities, but something about this beer falls flat for me."
"Overall, a nice saison. A little too sweet and too much banana for me."
"22oz bottle $7. I bought this after reading the description, the label was nice also. It was a nice orange color in the glass and smelled a little floral and kind of odd. The taste was nice like a saison but with a definite orange flavor to it, the peels really shined in this beer. This was so damn easy to drink, nice beer."
"D: This beer is a good sipper yet is also refreshing at the same time."
"D - I'd buy this beer over and over again to enjoy on a sunny spring afternoon. I'd be interested to see how it holds after a year or two in the cellar. I'm on my way back to the store to buy 2 more bottles right now. An excellent Saison in my opinion."
"Light body, with a good amount of carbonation. Alcohol is hidden well. Refreshing, but with enough flavor to enjoy the complexity. Very nice."
"Drinkability - Great drinkability. Putting a bottle of this down by yourself is not out of the question, though this will be my first time doing the whole bottle by myself. I foresee myself purchasing a few more of these to sit on and enjoy over the next year or so, as they conjure up great memories and the beer itself is quite enjoyable."
"Drinkability: This beer is really drinkable and, if not for the high carbonation, would probably be drank way too quickly. Solid beer for a reasonable price."
"Drinkability: Sofie is deceptively complex. I enjoyed the mild but complex taste. An easy drinker."
"2009. Light haze, deep gold colour with a 1.5 inch bright white cap. Slightly rocky bubbles clung to the glass in clumps. Good head retention. Nice aroma, fruity, a bit of citrus zest and pineapple, bready yeast, spicy, a bit earthy and grassy, slight strawberry. Floral and spicy flavour up front, along with mild tartness, followed by sugary sweetness with a berry quality. A bit earthy, slightly vinous finish with lingering peppery spice. Medium to light bodied with average carbonation. Decent texture, off-dry. I enjoyed this one. Plenty of character without being out of balance or overpowering."
"Poured into a cervoise, the beer was a hazy yellow color with a small white head. It had a sweet, candy aroma with a tiny bit of spice. Taste of cotton candy, orange, and coriander. Kind of yeasty. Medium bodied, nice drinking. I would buy this again anytime."
"Drinkability: A tasty saison that has a nice citrus and straw combination. I would get this again as a sipper. One of the better from GI that I have had so far."
"D-its basically a blue moon times 10. very refreshing with a slight hint of orange flavors. the strong fruity/sweet smell is very inviting."
"D: This is a very complex, yet easy drinking beer. I wasn't super impressed at first, but the beer quickly grew on me as it warmed. Overall, a very nice offering from Goose Island."
"Bomber, 2010 vintage, poured into a tulip glass. Pours a pale gold color with a thin fading white head. Aroma has some light esters evoking fruit salad, including apple, pear, and banana. Some clove notes lead me to believe this is made with some wheat. Nice smooth spiciness, also getting some vanilla. Flavor is bright and slightly tart, some lemon now emerging with the banana pith. Distinct but very well-integrated pepper note, along with mild notes of cooking herbs. Fruity tropical hops blend well with the esters, just like in the better Belgian IPAs. Light honeyed malts provide a soft background for all the yeasty and hoppy complexity. Dry finish, but not in an astringent way, which is a very significant accomplishment for a beer partially aged in wine barrels. Crisp and clean, a little hefty to be considered refreshing. A nice satisfying beer, somewhere between tripel, saison, and Belgian IPA."
"D: This is a very nice American made Belgian-style beer. It reminds me a bit of New Belgium Le Fleur Misseur. I'm very glad to see more Goose Island around, everything I've had from them so far has been top notch."
"D: A very interesting beer, doesn't seem to fit the saison category, but that might change with a little more time in the bottle, seems to be lacking some ""wildness"". I think I will pick up another bottle and see what happens in 6 months. Worth trying."
"D - Tasty and easy drinking saison, very nice"
"D-Yes please. This is one to savor... in quantity"
"I found this to be one of the better American renditions of a Belgian style beer. Certainly worth a try."
"Happy with my choice. Very drinkable"
"That green apple juiciness from the nose dominates the palate. A little bit of tart, green grapes comes through in the aftertaste. More lemony than orange as expected from the description on the label. Nice toasted grains don't overpower the tartness - in fact, all the flavors offer a soft, subtle and fragrant balance. Feel mirrors the softness, with a nice effervescent carbonation. Highly refreshing, highly drinkable, highly recommended."
"Overall an enjoyable saison, but not an exceptional one. Some versions of the style are so memorable but this one is merely solid."
"D - I think I could put down several bottles of this beer."
"D- A nice light, refreshing beer. This is one of my favorite styles as of late. This is a decent member of this style."
"Too early? Saisons/white ales tend to start tasting dusty with age in my opinion. This one didn't taste old, but just didn't really distinguish itself from everything else out there, despite the initial curiosity over what was described on the label."
"4.5/4/4/4/3.5"
"Very good now, I'm thinking that a few years to soften this out, could make it outstanding."
"A very drinkable beer that is light in weight, full of flavor, and moderate in alcohol. Will someone please serve this at the ballparks this summer?"
"D: Very good, easy to drink saison; alcohol is well-masked--a very nice beer"
"Bottle, home. Excellent Belgian style ale. Pours a bright lemon gold, fairly hazy, with a small white head. The aroma is sugary malt, honey, lemons, oranges, moderate funk level and mild but crisp grassiness. It's sweet and bright. The flavor is refreshing. There's a dry, believably-Belgian yeast with sweetly tart fruits chiming in. The orange peel and citrusy hops are pleasantly bitter. Mouthfeel is clean with an excellent lingering funk aftertaste. Goose Island makes some awesome Belgian style ales."
"D - Really fantastic offering. For fans of Hennepin should DEFINITELY make an effort to find this. After sharing this beer with my wife over dinner, we were so into it, we popped a bottle of Hennepin immediately following and we both agreed that Sofie had it easily beat. Gotta give it a 5 in the drinkability dept since I immediately ran out to find more. I've heard this one is somewhat limited which is a bummer, so get em while you can."
"WOW!!! Can't begin to think how to describe this. Pours a cloudy pale yellow, like the color of white grapes. Super large puffy white head. Aroma is white grapes and super juicy pear with a hint of yeasty funk! First sip is AMAZING. Not sure if its a beer or a world class champagne. Very bubly but not too much. Taste of sweet grapes, and orange and all kinds of things you can't quite grasp. Its all the great things you want in a Belgian beer. The funk,the fruity subtle undertones. Plus one of the MOST drinkible beers I have ever had. I can't believe I only bought one. I am heading back out tomorrow to stock up. This is by far my favorite from this brewery and one of my favorites overall. An outstanding example of the style."
"D: This one is good but i didnt really want to finish much more thant a glass"
"Poured from the nice looking 22 oz. bottle into a pint glass, Sofie has a monstrously huge white head and the beer itself is a slightly hazy white grape color. Almost looks like Champagne but with more head. The nose is complex; fruit and spice stand out as what's there but there is quite a depth to both. The fruitiness reminds me of pears, apples, white grapes and maybe a touch of peach and a bit of citrus in the form of orange blossoms. The spice is slightly phenolic, a bit peppery and generally more reserved than the fruit. Very nice indeed. The taste is similar in terms of components but the spice character definitely dominates. Fruity and sweet up front, it transitions to spicy and slightly dry with a bit of funk... but in a good way. Based on taste alone, I would guess this beer had more than 6.5% ABV, it seems more present than in some well done bigger Belgians I've had before. The beer has a nice mouthfeel, fuller than I had expected, maybe medium bodied, and the carbonation while reserved is still present but not in an effervescent way. Overall a very drinkable beer but one that should be savored, it would be interesting to save a bottle of this for a few years to see how it develops, but I'm not sure I have the constitution to do that~!"
"D - a superb Saison and overall lovely beer. classic notes but unique and has enough personality to keep it interesting. could drink this all day. having a great ""moment"" with it on a somewhat warm but breezy early evening on my porch after a day of cleaning."
"Bottle says it's brewed with orange peel but I didn't get any of that flavor in the brew...but good nonetheless."
"I love this beer at this time and this place. This was the perfect time for me to review it as it'll probably never taste as good as it does in this environment. I've bought this beer a few time and will continue to buy it."
"whoa. rockin good beer here. serious. world class. Hit the sweet spot wiht this. Sophisticated yet so easy and drinkable. no cloying just quaffing. Poured with a fine off white head and a litle lace. Color is a clear amber. Aroma is fresh yeast malt spice grass crotch funk an plasure. Flav's bout the same, but with a tart edge. Killer body and carbonation. Not just drinkable, but suckable. mmm mm mmmm"
"Purchased a bottle at Penguin Pizza in Mission Hill. Bottled December 2009. Split with my wife, and poured into two Belgian Palm beer goblets. Very pale yellow color. Thin, whispy white head. Smelled like chardonnay. Taste was amazing. Coriander, lemon peel, and orange flavors abound, followed softly by the aging in the wine barrels. So subtle but present. A perfect amount of blending by the brewer. Mouthfeel was so spot on for a saison. It was crisp and refreshing, but quenching all the while. About halfway through, you could actually feel the abv a bit. A great beer to have with a meal or anytime. This was a steal to pay retail price in a restaurant. Will consider picking up more bottles for home consumption."
"Overall, this is just a solid beer for the style. It is pretty drinkable and I like it. A well done beer from the guys at GI."
"D - Not too sure what I think about this one. Maybe its because I haven't had a saison in awhile, but the nose and flavor I associate with a good saison are missing."
"D: A very easy drinker...hard to believe this is 6.5%. I was really looking forward to this one...and perhaps I was overly excited. This one is OK on it's own, but would really shine when paired with food (e.g. milder cheeses, lighter chicken dishes). Will do that with my next one. Style note: I'm not sure I'd peg this as a saison. Maybe a pale belgian style ale."
"D: Easy drinker here, wow this one goes down with no effort. A little on the expensive side to session, and its not available here so I can't say I'll be having it again, but this is a fantastic beer that I would love to try again. Highly recommended."
"2009 vintage served at 48 degrees in my Lost Abbey stemware. Bottled on 12/11/09 indicated on the label of the 22oz. bottle. Poured a semi-translucent, slightly hazy pale yellow-gold with a loose, two inch bright white cap, that sizzles and pops as it quickly dissipates into a fizzy skim with a frothy band around the shoulders. Nose reveals lemon zest, candi sugar and a slightly herbal/grassy quality. Taste consistent with nose; however, flavors are a bit muted, but a little more coalesced - but its the mouthfeel that hits you first with an aggressive, just shy of prickly carbonation that immediately confronts you upon the first sip. It actually took a minute for that experience to diffuse a little before I could begin to recognize the flavors. Body is light-medium, with a slightly oily quality and a bit of acidity that stimulates the salivary glands only slightly towards the back of the cheeks. Carbonation re-asserts itself at the finish with a light, lingering burn. All and all, I found Sofie to be tasty and moderately refreshing, but a little too clean for a Saison. Closer to a Saison/Belgian Strong Pale in my opinion. Nonetheless a tasty and respectable offering from GI."
"Sofie Belgian Style Ale 2009 is one of my new favorites from a brewery that does much more right than it does wrong. I'm sure there are a few American-brewed, Belgian-style saisons out there that rival this one, but I can't think of any at the moment. What a tremendous surprise."
"D: I liked this much better than some of Goose Islands special releases, but I still don't know how much of this I could drink. A nice beer to have a small pour of, however."
"Pours a massive bleached bone white head with abundant lacing lofting a fragrant floral aroma that fills the room. has a bit of orange zest with grassy/hay and flowery meadow notes, yeasty. velvety chewy mouthfeel with a light crisp carbination and this 22oz is not a problem."
"Pours a pale straw color with a very hazy body. Topped with a two finger white head and a sour aroma and light malty aroma. The taste is also sour and is complemented with a yeasty hoarse blanket flavor. The body is light and very smooth with high carbonation and allows the flavors to dance on the palate. The finish is also sour and sweet, well balanced, and it fades slowly into clean crisp end."
"Bottle: Poured a deep hazy beige/orangey color ale with a huge foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of medium-sweet Belgian malt with some notes of orange peel and lightly tart whine wine is quite enticing. Taste is a wonderful mix between some tart notes from the wine barrel with some refreshing notes of Curacao and a nice attenuated Belgian malt backbone. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Very well done overall with good drinkability factor and some good complexity."
"The drinkability on this gal is near perfect. Solid hop profile with some mild funk in tow and a light, almost effervescent body."
"Sofie is a good beer, and I'm glad I bought a bomber. I just wish that I did not pass on the Pere Jacques. Oh well, next trip."
"Pours a pale yellow with a big soapy head. Settled down to a nice film on top. Smells like orange peel and coriander. Tastes delicate with a great crispness. I was a bit hesitant when the bottle stated the beer is aged in wine barrels but I don't get a lot of wine flavors from this at all. It tastes like a wonderful Saison and was a great surprise."
"D- i've been on the lookout for sofie for some time now, and i'm glad i finally found her. i've spent plenty of time with matilda, but juliet is nowhere to be found. at least pere jacques is locked up in my basement. i expected good things from sofie, and i'm more than impressed. refreshing, easy drinking, thrist quenching. a little high in alcohol for how drinkable it is. something arounf 5% would be nice, but i'm not complaining. a masterpiece of american brewing emulation, a very wise maneuver with the amarillo and orange peel, and a damn near perfect saison."
"Note: it says on the bottle that this one develops in the bottle for up to 5 years. I may get a few more and see what happens with time."
"Cheers!"
"Very drinkable, well done Saison, unfortunately The $8/bomber price tag will keep me from drinking to many more of these."
"Libation: All the flavors are very well balanced, there is a lot going on with sofie but it's all very complimentary and no one flavor elbows any other out of the way. The whole bomber went down quickly, and I could have had another."
"Pours a slight hazy, golden yellow that looks beautiful in the glass. Thin layer of creamy, bright white head that lingers for a short time. Smells of hay, grain, orange and a slight lemon zest, with some spicy notes in the background. Taste is magnificent, one of the best saisons I've had at this point in my life. The subtle spice flavors are just at the appropriate levels where they're noticeable, but not controlling the beer. Orange, barnyard, and grassy flavors emerge the further I get into it. Light carbonation gives it a great feel and I definitely had no problem drinking a whole bomber by myself. Would be a great beer for summer afternoons."
"The aroma of this beer has a soft sweetness to it (the honey and orange like notes) that doesn't translate to the mostly dry flavor. I definitely like this character in my Saisons, which should be quite dry. This is a very nice beer; it has a really nice mix of flavors / aromas and is quite easy drinking. I could easily stand to have quite a few of these bottles about as these will likely age for at least another year quite well. Without having had Juliet yet, I almost wonder if this is the better beer of the two; I'll have to confirm that when I crack a bottle of Juliet. This is definitely a fantastic beer that I find quite enjoyable. My 22oz bottle of this is too quickly gone & I definitely wish I had more of these."
"the drinkability is good, it's goes down very easily. this is a great american saison. it hits all the right notes. plenty of complexity and a quencher as well. very nice."
"D- Enjoyable. I'm going to be drinking this one a lot come summertime- very light and refreshing. A very tasty beer."
"Very nice."
"HV"
"D- Goes down very nicely. I could easily down this bomber on my own, but I can't forsee a second bottle in one sitting."
"Conclusion: This isn't quite what I was expecting somehow, but that doesn't make it any less tasty. Tally up another win for Goose Island."
"D - Bought it at the local Kroger's as I'd never come across it before. It would be phenomenal come spring as opposed to the current snow storm and below freezing weather. I'll probably pick up a few bottles for when the weather turns and maybe one or two to lay up for a while. I suspect it would only improve with a year."
"Sofie is pale yellow and cloudy, with an understated grassy, funky, estery smell, with a touch of tartness and citrus. It has a wonderful, soft, bubbly mouthfeel-- like if somebody made a wheat champagne. It's smooth and delicious, with a fuller body than you would expect, funky Belgian yeast flavors, and a little bit of earthy, spicy hoppiness. The bottle says this can be aged for 5 years, and that 20% of it is aged in wine bottles. I assume that adds up to some wild yeast component, which means I would be very curious to try this in a few years."
"M/D- Overall excellent. Very smooth, very drinkable, very tasty. I was pleasantly surprised that despite having a pretty bad cold, the smell and taste really shone through on this beer. Another good Belgian-style beer from GI. Say what you want about their regularly-released beers, these Belgians are goood."
"D: Wonderful drinker: as refreshing a saison as one could find outside of Belgium or France. A well-done version of the style, worth seeking."
"Pours a hazy yellow with a large white head. The aroma is wheat with some Belgian yeast. The flavor is lemon, orange, wheat, light funk and some Belgian yeast. Some other fruit flavors are present including apples.Thin mouthfeel and high carbonation."
"Pours a hazy pale straw color with a fluffy pure white head that slowly settles. The brew kind of has a greenish hue. The aroma is sweet and spicy. Sweet from what appears to be candi sugar, with a nice floral yeasty spice. Light coriander and clove, some funk and horse blanket. The taste has a noticable horse blanket flavor, subtle coriander and green apple. Has a nice earthy/raw quality to it. The flavor is not very strong but it is very nice. The feel is light and crisp, sweet and floral with a light lemony pucker in the end. Pretty spot on for the flavor of the saisons that I like, not too funky but with nice yeasty flavors."
"Good but would not go out of the way to pick up."
"It's funny, this is kinda what I thought Matilda would taste like, but didn't. Matilda is the slightly stuck-up, more refined older sister, Juliet is the young, effervescent red-headed cheerleader. Sofie is more the smart-ass semi-tomboy girl who gets straight As but doesn't seem like she's trying very hard at it, plays soccer, and isn't afraid to spice up her language with a few F-bombs every now and again. Out of the 3 ""Women of Goose Island," I think Sofie has the most personality. Recommended if you like: saisons, Jolly Pumpkin, spicy Belgian blondes (and the beers too)."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden yellow with a booming fizzy white head that never full dissolves and leaves heavy lacing down the glass. The aroma is belgian yeast, bitter citrus, oak and almost comes across like a glass of chardonnay. The flavor is sweet and has more citrus and oaky flavors and is slightly bitter with a dry finish. Its a light bodied beer with lively carbonation. Elegent, light, and quite enjoyable."
"Bomber bottle, ""Bottled on 12-11-09"" Typed onto the label, $7.99 at Whole Foods Bowery, NYC. Pours quite light, yellowy and clear, the head is eggshell, initially quite impressive, slow morph to meraingue and 1/2 inch froth, leaves the expected quality, thicker and sticky lace. The nose is loaded with lemony fruit, yeasty nuttyness and general Belgian style spiced up yummyness. The final pour is yeast infused and produces a cloudy look. Notes on the tongue and mouth include more yeasty nuttyness, moderate pepper, tropical fruit, and hoppy herbaliciousness. Simply yummy. Complex, flavorful, delicate yet full of flavor and interest. Huge ups for the quality take on the style. A bargain price for this high qality brew. Wish I picked up 2 or more bottles, which sums things up.."
"D- Love it, will grab another bottle of this for sure,"
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is great. The low ABV with the great fruity, oak flavors are just superb. Overall, I am pretty impressed with Sofie. Probably one of the better Saisons I've had. Seek it out. Skal."
"D - Very high and enjoyable brew. Lower ABV."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a hazy, light golden color with a cap of bright white head. The collar retention was good and the lacing was good as well. The aroma was fresh, pleasant and bright. I detected citrus zest, crystal malt, an array of spices and floral hops. The flavors were very zesty with so much citrus, especially grapefruit, that it was difficult to pull much more out of it at first. The yeast and malt characters were harder to discern but I did get a general doughiness along with a pleasant yet bitter floral hops finish. No doubt a great summer beer complete with a medium body, light/medium carbonation and smooth mouthfeel. Quaffable, acidic enough to pair well with food and very sessionable. Try it, like it."
"overall, i was pretty impressed. i'd been wanting to try this one for awhile, but i couldn't seem to find it. it was a bit on the pricey side ($11) so hard to justify a second one at the time, but the next time i see this on a beer list i'll be sure to have it again."
"Pours an unfiltered lemon yellow with a foamy, bright dense white head with moderate lacing and light retention, nothing exceptional. Strong citrus and yeast aroma, smells like a blue moon with a large piece of fruit in it basically (not that I would honestly have any idea what that smells like). Medium full body with effervescent carbonation and fruity, dry finish. Body has strong grain and malt basis with a nice balance of spice and fruit (orange peel, coriander, pepper, lemon zest, grape, etc). A nice refreshing saison, but something is lacking in character and complexity to get this again at this price for a bomber."
"This is a tasty, easy drinking beer, that would probably be great to drink outdoors on a nice summer day. Not a great beer, but a good beer."
"D: Like this one a lot. Wish I had bought two bottles of this."
"Drinkability is OK but this one could be lots better."
"A nice Saison from the folks at Goose Island. Quite tasty and well-balanced."
"Not bad, just one dimensional. I think I was expecting a little more, not my favorite of the style or brewery."
"D- I am really starting to dig this style of beer."
"Spice never quits, never never flags...really great saison!"
"D: NIcely balanced, flavors play very well off one another. Goes down easily and very tasty. I wish I had this on a warm, humid summer day. It's a perfect summertime brew."
"Poured into my Duvel tulip. Clear, light golden in color with a very large white head that slowly settles to a thick cap. Light lacing is left on the glass. The second pour from the bottle resulted in a slight haze as the yeast gets mixed in. Light vinous qualities in the aroma with hints of white grapes. Yeast phenols add some spice kick but overall the aroma is a bit understated. Things pick up with the flavor. More of the spice comes into play. Hints of cloves and pepper. Slightly fruity. Finishes extremely dry. Not a flavor that I would call rustic or typical Saison. Very clean and crisp in comparison to others in the style. Light body with effervescent carbonation makes this a pleasure to drink. Feels light and airy. A nice Belgian style ale. I wonder how this beer will develope with a few years age."
"This is a nice surprise from Goose Island. I will definitely pick this one up again."
"D - Overall a good saison, but not a great one. Would drink it if handed to me, but wouldn't seek it out over many other Saisons."
"Pours palest yellow with a slow developing haze and a vast fluffy white head. Aroma is extremely spicy - clove and allspice. Flavor is extraordinarily lemony with a thick spice character. The finish has a citrus sourness and a little bitterness. Mouthfeel is amazingly thick and substantial for such a pale beer - a big surge of liquid in every sip. Very good"
"Extremely drinkable, abv is completely hidden. This is very quaffable. Would love to age a bottle to see how this progresses in a few years, but I doubt that will happen..."
" Remarkably easy to drink. Alcohol goes unnoticed through out, pleasant flavors glide effortlessly across the palate. Sofie is one which should be sipped in order to savor the delicate flavors. Unfortunately savoring is not as easy as it sounds, the beer goes down far to easy. I will definitely seek this out in the future. Great beer."
"M/D - hands down, i could drink this all day. wish i had more"
"All in all, I do not like this brew. You might like this brew if you like hoppy flavors with hints of apples and light fruits. Not my style, but it might be yours."
"Elegant saison, a little funky yeast aroma, along with white pepper. Pours light colour with lots of foamy head. Refreshing taste and mouthfeel, very good with supper. Elegant and not compelx, with a bit of the orange peel. Nothing really funky about the taste.Lace lines."
"D - this is an interesting beer - it isn't your run-of-the-mill saison. The low abv and lighter taste makes this bomber very easy to take down. I am glad I picked this up, now I really want to try Juliet."
"Drinkability is fairly high. The abv is easily managed and the flavor profile is pleasing which makes for pretty easy drinking. It does have a tendency to lack a little flavor which bores me a bit. All in all it's a good beer, but I wish they took it a little bit further."
"First beer on New Years eve! Beautiful hazy bright gold color when held to the light. Fluffy white head when gently poured into a portsmouth tulip. Aromas are delicate, muted. Some light grass, banana and other light fruits. some grassy hop bitterness up front and at the end. In between some bready yeast flavors with a bit of banana. Crisp mouthfeel with some lingering bitterness. Lovely beer. WOuld be a wonderful summer thirst quencher."
"First beer of the night for New Year's Eve is Goose Island Sofie. Nice to see that this brewery is now distributed in Mass. Color is a hazy straw/gold with a white heading that has some serious lasting power. Very interesting smells going on such as a bit of basement must, wild flowers, orange peel, and something reminds me of lime. Very crisp and floral taste profile. I get some raw grain, green apple, pear, just a very bright tasting Saison. Mouthfeel is on the light side, and at times appears to be bordering on Witbier status. Drinkability is simply superb, and the lower ABV helps to make this an easy brew to consume. This is a top notch example of this style. Goose Island really hit a grand slam with this offering. I cannot wait till their Sour beer, Juliet, makes its way out to these parts as well. Cheers and Happy New Year."
"F: Finishes somewhat bitter, more than I thought it would. Also pretty dry with some spicy flavors again, as well as the nice wheat finish. It also leaves some fruits and banana flavors lingering a bit. Some slight earthy tastes, but not really very long. Long finish of wheat, banana, and yeast. Would be a great summer beer."
"Lemongrass and herbal hop bitterness up front. Acidic lemony flavors stay throughout. Musty, metallic brett character comes through mid-palate. Slightly sweet malt present with yeast, and fresh hay near the finish. Lingering citrus and yeast. Very lively, bottle-conditioned feel. Very good now, but would like to see what some age would do to this."
"Poured into an oversized wine glass from 1 pint, 6 oz bottle. I should start by admitting that this is not my favorite style of beer. Having spent a lot of time on my grandparent's farm as a kid, anything with a wheat/grain smell reminds me of grain elevators and cattle feed. So, subconsciously, I'm all ready biased against the style, although I love my grandparent's and the farm. Go figure. Anyway, This had a dark yellow coloring with no head at all. The sediment rests on the bottom of the glass as it settles. The flavor is ""grainy", for lack of a better term and I think this may work well with a food pairing. It didn't do it for me as a stand alone beer. It's a little sweeter than I expected, and that only hurts the drinkability for me. Disappointing, as the guy at my beer store loves the stuff."
"3.5 D: Good brew. I like a good brett'd beer every once in a while and this one didn't disappoint."
"drinkability is high - i can only imagine drinking this on a hot summer day - oh well it still is drinking nicely on this cold winter night"
"This was a very nice brew from GI. Clean, flavorful and very drinkable, would be an excellent Belgian brew for a warm summer evening. Drinking it on a cold night in front of a warm fire was nice as well."
"D: Big time drinkabilty with the 6.5 abv. This would be really decent summertime brew. Going to pick a couple more up, and stash them. Like to put some age on one for grins."
"Drinkability is wonderful. A 6.5% with absolutely no noticeable alcohol and depth of flavor that keeps revealing something new across the whole drinking experience. Well constructed and executed!"
"d: wish i had more than the bomber!"
"Drinkability? Seeing as this is right up my alley flavourwise and alcoholwise, this is a cheer joy to drink and very drinkable. Excellent example of the style!"
"M/D - Light, crisp and very well carbonated. Very easy drinking as well. Not the best saison ever, but certinaly very very good."
"D - This distinctive interpretation of the style is quite drinkable and refreshing. The yeast is a wonderful combination of fruity saison yeast and distinct brett mustiness. The hops are subdued in the aroma, but show up in full force flavor-wise, which is a nice nod to classic hoppy saisons like Dupont and also makes for a nice contrast set against the yeast. The finish is perfectly balanced and unusually champagne-like, which leaves me thirsting for another sip."
"Great job Goose Island for a Belgian worthy Saison style beer."
"22 ounce bottle, bottled on 10/23/2009. Served in a tulip glass, the beer pours a hazy light gold color with about an inch white head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. Aroma is lemon, orange peel, peppery spice, and wheat. Taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, but with the addition of some green grapes. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it has high (but soft) carbonation, and also has a dry finish. Drinkability is good, it's a nice and refreshing brew. I liked this beer, I'd buy it again."
"Pours an ultra pale golden yellow color with a two finger foamy white head that decomposes in 3D...leaving spotty patterns of lacing behind. The smell is aggressive, earthy Belgian yeast lemon orange, spices and banana. Nicely carbonated, the complex texture of tiny bubbles and lively bright tangerine complements the slightly understated citrus banana pear flavors. This has got to be the lightest color ale that i've had the opportunity to consider!! WOW...this is definitely a 'keeper'...would like to have a number of these in my go-to stash. Full flavored..and surprisingly full bodied...it goes to show that you shouldn't judge an ale by it's color!! At 6.5 ABV, this one is HUGELY sessionable!! This one from Gommer's Midtown in KC...highly recommended!!"
"This beer is pungent and pulls no punches. This can turn people off, I'm sure, but what I get is a very well refined, well balanced and enjoyable drink that has its ingredients integrated and working together to something great."
"D - Moderate drinkability. ABV is up there, but not off the charts. A bit filling however. A good one and done from the 22oz. Might have to put a few of these away for the summer."
"D- Is good because its very refreshing and light. Could definitely drink more then one :)."
"I found this to be very drinkable. Had a nice flavor balance, and was very smooth. This is one I'd have no problem trying again."
"Overall, a solid beer, but a bit too plain to bee anything better."
"D- For an American take on the style, this is going to be hard to beat. Drinks nicely and really hits the spot."
"D - This is a very good saison.It went really well with Thanksgiving dinner."
"I like this beer.. It has a light color and medium head. It is smooth like a pilsner, yet it has more flavor and I think I do taste some of the orange peel/wine barrel aging. It had a dirty/fruity aftertaste that makes this beer unique in a good way. I might even try aging it but it tastes great fresh. Not quit at saison in my opinion, but somewhere in between a saison and a belgian IPA. Get this one if you are in to belgian IPAs or if you like good beer."
"D- Really nice complex flavor. A very enjoyable brew."
"22oz bomber poured into a Boulevard Tank 7 Smokestack tulip. 2009 vintage bottled on 10/23. This beer pours a slightly hazy golden straw with a large 3-inch, tight, white head that leaves subtle, soapy lacing down the sides of glass. The aroma is very standard for a Saison. Earthy, herbal hops, grass, hay, a slight musty funk, and lemon zest. The flavor is much more complex. Basic Saison flavors come through. Grassy hops, hay, earthy mustiness, and white pepper. Orange rind comes through as does a slight vinous character that comes through on the tail of the flavor profile. Just a slight grape sweetness. The mouthfeel is light and crisply carbonated. It finished very dry. Makes the mouth quiver for another sip. This is a very well done beer. Goose Island hits a homer with this one. Definitely will be seeking out another bottle to put some age on."
"Notes: delicious and refreshing take on a standard belgian wheat"
"D- A very drinkable Saison. Interesting flavors mixing and keeping interest. Would recomend."
"A big thank you to SurlySober for bringing this beer over to my house to share."
"A little too phenolic to be thoroughly enjoyable, though certainly interesting."
"drinkability is good. nice balance of alcohol. just the right amount of funk to add a nice extra level to it. delicious!"
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation, feels a little watery in the finish, but nicely spiced and very dry. Nice funkiness, good stuff."
"D - Pretty good beer and pretty easy to drink, little too citrusy to be able to pound though."
"Drinkability: I would definitely have this again and recommend this to someone who seeks a light bodied belgian style pale ale with hints of lemon and unripened green grapes. Too bad its abv is a bit high to be sessionable."
"Overall, a great offering from Goose Island. Glad I found this when I did, because it didn't last long. I will enjoy the other bottle of this I stashed away for myself."
"Recommendable."
"Very good beer. Not a breakout, but the lemon dominant is a good touch, & the complexity over the yeast & grassiness is nice."
"D= pretty good. Not much wrong with this beer at all. One of the best Saisons I've had."
"The mouthfeel and drinkability are ok."
"very soft mouthfeel"
"Drinkability is great. The acid from the citrus and the fruity yeast are a nice flavor balance and easily make this beer a very drinkable brew."
"D- I was really impressed with this brew...Definitely worth a try, and a revisit...also curious to see what would happen if you were to age this one...cheers!"
"Palest yellow on the pour, small white head forms which is gone quickly and some scattered lacing is present. Aroma of wheat, Belgian yeast, and light funk. Flavor follows suit with the nose. Plenty of wheat, yeast, light funk, orange peel, very light oak, and a bit of bitterness. I'm really having difficulty describing this one. The flavor just doesn't do it for me. There's a touch of funky cheese that I can't get past, and it's bone dry on the finish. Mouthfeel medium with crisp, ample carbonation. Gotta say, I'm not a fan of this brew. I've enjoyed the other Belgian style brews from GI, but this one doesn't do it for me. There are much better saisons out there."
"Drinkability: Very refreshing, but I expected more complexity. Nevertheless, a very good Saison that straddles the Saison/Witbier divide."
"This can hardly be classified as a Saison. It's indistinguishable from a Witbier. As a wit, it's pretty decent. But I was hoping for a whole lot more."
"D - Very high. Split this with my girlfriend and roommate and it didn't last long for anyone. Excellent beer overall."
"Sunny bright hazy yellow body. Snow-white head leaves no lacing. A bit of sourness in both the smell and taste. I think I can also smell some oak from the barrel aging. The orange peel in the taste makes it seem like a cross between a saison and a witbier. Bitterness is a little above average for the style. The taste improves a little as it warms."
"Overall this is an excellent saison that is both flavorful and refreshing. Highly recommended."
"Poured into my glass the beer is cloudy yellow green. The stark white head is two inches thick and rest comfortably on top of my beer. After some settling the head leaves gobs of creamy white lace all around my glass. The beer itself has gone from cloudy to almost clear as well. The aroma is a huge boquet of lemon and sour apples. With clove, pepper and yeast rounding things out. The flavor follows the aroma fairly closely. Green apples and lemon are rather prominent yet thet are nicely balanced by a sweetness that caps the sourness of those fruits. Strong clove and pepper spice abounds with every sip. Excellent balance. Sofie has a great dry finish with a moderate amount of carbonation. This is going to the top of my saison list for sure."
"D- This is a delicious beer with a slight sweetness that works well with the drier fruit flavors and the wine notes with the Orval yeast qualities. This beer is light but has a great mysterious complexity that beg to take another sip. I am excited to try this one aged but I don't know if I can keep from drinking it now."
"I'm looking forward to pairing this tasty brew with foods like oysters or chicken with spicy Mandarin orange sauce."
"Sofie isn't a bad beer, but I can think of a number of other Saisons that have come across better."
"D: Deliciously drinkable. I don't this this would be a favorite beer of mine, but if I could snag one on tap this would definitely go down easy on a summer day. A nice refreshing treat on this hot night. I would love to pair this with a white fish or even a salad with a citrus vinaigrette."
"Poured a clear light golden yellow with a half finger white head. Smells of spiced apple cider, citrus/lemon, and champagne; very delicious. Taste is more apple cider and champagne, also more citrus. Dry finish. Very bubbly, effervescent mouthfeel. All in all quite drinkable and delicious."
"Recommended"
"D: It's okay. After having Juliet I expected quite a bit more out of this one."
"Overall, an interesting take on the style and I very much enjoyed this one. Recommended."
"Drinkability: great"
"FYI: The new ""wine labels"" are really nice and simple. I really dig the new look of Goose Island's more rare brews. There's a simple grace and dignity to them - well done!"
"Drinkability: A good saison - as I mentioned above, this one's stylistically spot on, authentic, and sports the spice, the fruit, the esters, the subtle and well-attenuated wheaty sweetness. Though there are a few things that just don't click for me, this one is by and large very drinkable, and at 6.5% it's only marginally more alcoholic than your standard IPA or pale ale. Drink up, as this one's very solid."
"I love this brew, I have had Juliet and Matilda, but my mistress Sofie bitch-slaps the both of them. Wish this was something that I had better access to."
"Pours golden clear and with a little amber hue. Very quick head that leaves only ring of foam after the pour. Ok bubbling. The aroma makes me think of champagne and light triple sec. Very dry triple sec. Dry champagne and riesling wine notes mingle with toasted pilsner malts. The hops add just a hint of earthy funk to the whole palate of this beer. the"
"D - pretty decent, I enjoyed the 22 ounces, but i think thats enough for me. I would be interested in getting another bottle to sit on for awhile and see what flavors some through in a year or three."
"This is a great saison from GI and extremely drinkable with plenty of sweetness in the aroma and some earthy characteristics that come through more in the taste. A great summer afternoon beer."
"Goose Island Sofie poured very pale, slightly cloudy with a very good head and good lacing. The smell was full of nice citrus notes. The taste was full of crisp sweetness, with fruit flavors of apricots. Showed a slight hop bitterness at the end. Mouthfeel was good, nice carbonation. Drinkability was nice. This was a nice ale. I enjoyed a good deal. I hope they continue to produce it."
"D - The dryness in the mouthfeel definitely leaves me wanting more, and the great aroma makes me happy to keep bringing it back. The crispness makes this smooth and easy on this extremely hot summer night in Los Angeles. Yes, this could be an everyday go-to beer for me, if it were readily available. And the lack of anything overwhelming at any stage of the game this makes this even more ""drinkable."""
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with strong carbonation."
"Drinkability: Easy drinker..."
"D -- Nicely savorable drink. Nothing to rush through, but relax and enjoy."
"Pours a lightly veiled straw with a classic, rocky head that leaves a thick, resilient lacing behind. Smell is light corriander, lemon zest, and a faint smell of oak. This beer is proof that subtlety and complexity can coexist. The taste starts with light lemon tartness and yeasty breadiness with some coriander underneath. The finish has flavors of citrus peel and some oaked chardonnay (I don't drink white wine, but it's kind of fun to pick that up in a beer). You'll do fine swapping in Sofie for white wine pairings (salads, light fish or asian flavors). According to the label, this will develop for up to five years. Looking forward to what the next five years have to offer."
"Reviewed on 06/04/2009. Bottle at PPRBSG09. Pours a cloudy very light yellow. Aroma of funky barnyard and sweettart candies. Flavor is very similar--with more of a sour bend along with the sweet tartness. Very smooth, light on the palate, and mellow. Good stuff!"
"Thanks to GbVDave for this one. Bottled in Jan. 09. 22oz. bottle served in the new style Blvd. Smokestack Chalice Poured a pale gold with a finger of fine bubbled, white head. Lots of carbonation. Coriander and orange peel in the aroma. Fairly light bodied. Spicy finish from the yeast. More citrus and orange peel. Very dry. After drinking the Juliet, this was a bit of a let down. Nothing wrong with it, but it just didn't do a whole lot for me."
"EDIT #2: OK, it's just really good. Everything works. Outstanding."
"D- way too easy to drink. a perfect summer beer. and sessionable too! probably my favorite saison, and boy am i glad this one is going to be sitting on the shelf for a long while at my local bottle shops. check this one out."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, crisp and light. Extremely easy to drink with well balanced carbonation. A bomber of this brew would easily disappear on a summer afternoon. Overall, a great brew and the orange peel works great without being overpowering. Will be buying more of this one."
"D: Yes this is quite a lot to expect from a beer, to match such a specific expectation, but that self important label, the passively decant bottle design that if it were a person would probably smoke Camel Turkish Golds and speak in nothing but back handed compliments. Not quite sure why that would make the contents of said bottle any good, but I've had great experiences with Goose Island in the past and didn't think it would be any different in this case. Oh well. This beer is probably worth another try, but for now it will just have to stay how it is."
"Fresh 22oz bomber purchased for $7.99 at Armenetti's. This beer is clear, golden straw color, thick wet foam with thin dry lacing. The aroma is exceptional, an American saison that I like for once! I'm guessing amarillo hops are the source of the citrus aromas, which contrast nicely with the spicy Belgian yeast and sharp pepper. The taste is sweet and peppery in a complementary way, I think the closest description is a tripel dry hopped with amarillo. Not sure if this matches my image of saison (i.e. DuPont) but then this style covers a wide range of topographies. The body is more or less normal, very carbonated and maybe this adds to the peppery taste. An extremely good beer overall, and I appreciate the lower price point after recently paying about $16 for Juliet."
"Pours a hazy fizzy yellow with a big 'ol three finger bright white head that falls to a thin foamy layer. Some thick spots of clingy lace holds on to the sides of the glass. Aroma is crisp and spicy. Lemon zest, some cinnamon, and a touch of lime. Underneath all the fruitiness is the slightest bit of pepper. Not much funk/brett with this, but still an enjoyable sniffer. Taste begins with the zesty citrus fruits followed by some dry earthy flavors. Some funky brett, a touch of honey, and green apples midway, but for some reason the flavor fades rather quickly leading to a brief peppery aftertaste. Light and fluffy body with a lively feel from the full carbonation, spot on for the style. This is one of the better beers I've had from GI for sure, but I wish the flavor would just hold on longer. I would have no problem drinking this again, thanks again Tim!"
"I was disappointed to be sharing my bottle (except that the wife was loving it as much as I was) and would love to get my hands on more some day. Would that more American brewers tackled the style with this much rustic charm and gentle complexity."
"D - Highly drinkable. Light, delicate flavors. Great summer beer. Perfect for a warm night with light summer food."
"The beer is light-medium bodied with a medium level of carbonation, and a soft, creamy, smooth mouthfeel. This beer was a real pleasure."
"D: Quite refreshing. Nice and complex. An excellent saison."
"I am hugely impressed with this saison from Goose Island. They nailed the recipe on this brew. The slight barrel aging and added orange peel has done wonders for the complexity of this beauty. It's not the most traditional of saisons but I'd have to say it's my new, favorite American saison. Good job guys!"
"Taste is more of the peppery spice and just a hint of lemon. Pretty refreshing and enjoyable. Not as complex as I was hoping it would be, but good none the less. Very happy I got to try this, now on goes the search for the Juliet."
"Quite a quaffable brew, warm weather or not."
"will get back to this one in a good while."
"Medium carbonation, somewhat thin but decent for a barrel-aged (at least a portion) Belgian-style pale or a farmhouse ale with brett. Very nice beer and I would like to try this one again with some age on it."
"This is a really nice blended Saison style from Goose. It's got a nice effervescence and aromas of citrus and orange. The orange peel really comes through in the flavor, my only complaint is it's still slightly young on the palate. It's a bit dry on the finish, but I think it's got some great potential to shape up really nicely!"
"D - Good price, good complexity, good aging potential. Would definately revisit, and would recomend to others. Maybe not the best Belgian, but quite good."
"D - I am guessing this is Matilda with orange peel aged in wine barrels. Almost like a skilled blender mixed Matilda and a Wit into a complex wonderful beer. Very enjoyable."
"D: This is a fantastic Saison. While not a funky Brett bomb or a citrus explosion, it contains both of those elements, to varying degrees. It also contains a fair amount of green & grassy hops that in no way steps on anything else going on here. Everything works in concert with everything else here and is, dare I say, one of the finest examples of the style I've ever tasted..."
"Mouthfeel is extremely creamy! Very smooth. While this is not my favorite style, this is a well crafted beer worthy of your attention."
"Light tartness from the yeast or barrel bugs, but it's oh so soft and creamy. Orange peel and delicate Belgian yeast dances over a light malty base. Dry finish with some noble hop herbals. Utterly quaffable and refreshing. I've only experienced this soft lightness before in a few Belgians, namely Fantome, Troublette, and other rustic-style Saisons & Wits. This is one i'll return to again and again. Paired nicely with a washed rind cheese, Jasper Hill Winnimere."
