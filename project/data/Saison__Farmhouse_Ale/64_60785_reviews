"O: Manages to pull off the Scarborough Fair herbs without being offensive."
"Those spices just made my pallet tingle I loved this the spices that were in it threw me off but it was great I want more!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Cloudy and golden, with fluffy white head. Smelled citrusy hops and honey, maybe some stone fruits (peach). Couldn't pick out herbs at all, which really confused me, but I did get some spice. White pepper in the finish, almost like a Gruner Veltliner. I bought this beer, because the concept interested me. I don't feel that DFH delivered, this time."
"Dogfish Head knows what they are doing."
""
""
""
""
""
"Loved it so much I copied the recipe for homebrew."
""
""
""
"Is this really a saison, though? It drinks like a belgian. I did not enjoy this."
""
"O - This is an interesting experiment, building off a solidly produced saison base, this beer delivers enough of its herb themes to evidence its commitment to these ingredients without allowing them to undermine the drinking experience.  Not necessarily something I'd grab often, this is still a well executed beer."

"Really nice clear, yellow color with thick head.  Nose is really odd....I've seen some really interesting descriptions for the smells from saisons, but this one is tough for me....I'm not opposed to some funk, as a saison should be, be the herbs really give it an unpleasant initial impression....almost a drain pour.  Now the taste, completely different ballgame.....actually quite pleasant.....good mouthfeeel, citrusy, light....one of the first beers where I'm disconnected from the smell and taste.....physiologically, not sure how that happens, but it did.  Wouldn't buy again, but wouldn't turn one down either if purchased for me."

"Overall: It is a very unique tasting beer that I probably wouldn't drink more than one of, and it doesn't currently leave me craving for another. However it is very well crafted and leaves enough room in the overall flavor that the spice in the beer doesn't consume it entirely. I would not recommend it specifically to Saison drinkers, but rather to pale ale and IPA drinkers who are always searching for new hop flavors (specifically herbal ones). This actually does a fair job of scratching the itch for new hop flavors (even though it is predominantly flavored through cooking herbs). I would recommend it."
""
""
"Overall:  This is a very delicious, outstanding, American version of a Belgian Saison.  It has great, balanced flavors of toasted malt, spices, citrus, funk and hoppy bitterness.  Highly, highly, recommended!"
""
"O: Very enjoyable ale. Pair with Italian food."
"another great dogfish head. they've got it figured out"
""
""
""
"A total drain pour for me.  I could not even get through my 5 oz tasting glass.  Glad I just bought 1.  This one is not for me"
"Good pour with a solid head, but of an off smell but that may be the glass that I am using. Nothing special about the look or color, but I really enjoyed the peppery taste on the back end. Overall very solid and worth buying -- I got it for just $2.95 for a 12 oz. bottle."

"Champagne mouth feel."

"This was a very interesting take on a classic Saison. I commend the trio of breweries use of unusual ingredients in the brew pot to literally spice things up a bit. I can't wait to get a hold of the other two brewery's versions and see how they compare. I'd recommend drinking this one as fresh as possible to preserve that great herbal character from the added herbs."

"Mouthfeel is light, very very dry. Overall, I like it."

"Serving type: bottle"
"Overall:  definitely worth trying, if you're into saisons, herbed beers or bizarre experiments.  But it's not something I'd buy in a four or six pack."

"Final score: 3.83"
"Overall, a pretty good and very unique saison. I'd definitely recommend picking one up when you can."

"O: Not a saison, but intriguing (would you expect anything less from these two?). Herbs and hops are nicely presented, so long as you're not a gardener trying to pick out each one."
"12 ounce bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled on 6/10/2014. Pours fairly hazy deep golden color with a 1 finger dense and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big lemon, pear, white grape, pepper, clove, herbal, floral, grass, cracker, bread, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, herbal spicing, and pale malt notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, pear, white grape, pepper, clove, herbal, floral, grass, cracker, bread, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy yeast spice/herbal spice flavors on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, pear, white grape, pepper, clove, herbal, floral, grass, cracker, bread, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast, herbal spicing, and pale malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast/spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately crisp, and slightly bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent herbal spiced saison. All around great complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast, herbal spicing, and pale malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"I really like the play of the parsley, sage, Rosemary and thyme and the hops.  well done!!!"

"12 oz bottle.  Pours hazy golden with tall, long lasting, fluffy white head and nice lacing.  Aroma is of funky yeast, bready malt, ripe pears, spices and some herbal hops. Body is medium and crisp.  Herbs, spices, funky yeast, bready malt and ripe fruit fill the mouth.  Finish is long and spicy. Interesting brew, but too much herbs for me."

"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and a nice example of the style, the herb worked well with it and they weren't overpowering when it came to the taste, but there was nothing about it that really wowed me, i thought it was nice, but it wasn't anything special.  This beer had ok drinkability, it was fairly smooth, crisp, slightly prickly, dry on the finish, not too filling and the taste doesn't do the best job at holding my attention, one is enough for me, I don't have any urge to drink another one in a row.  What I like the most about this beer was the appearance and aroma, they were both good and I thought the aroma was pretty unique and a little intense.  What I like the least about this beer was the taste and the drinkability, they held this beer back a little and they could use a little work.  I wouldn't buy this beer again, I'm glad I tried it, but it isn't something that I feel the need to revisit anytime soon and I can't say I would recommend it as a great Saison.  All in all I wasn't impressed with this beer, the combination of herbs with this saison wasn't bad, but it wasn't something that really wowed me and in the end I wanted a little more out of this beer.  It's not my favorite Dogfish Head beer and it's for sure not a favorite of the style.  I appreciate the effort it took to make this beer, keep up the solid and unique work."

"Pours a cloudy, straw/gold color.  1/4 inch head of a white color.  Great retention and great lacing.  Smells of sage, pale malt, hint of hop, hint of sweet malt, hint of yeast, and a hint of rosemary.  Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with an average carbonation level.  Tastes of strong pale malt, yeast, slight rosemary, slight sage, and a hint of sweet malt.  Overall, good appearance, aroma, body, and blend.  The herbs are easily discernible in both body and aroma, but are not overpowering."
""
""
""
"Poured to a nice full head with great retention and good lacing.  Appearance was cloudy with a golden straw color.  Aroma Is very floral with some pine and bread notes. Taste hade some herbal notes, as expected, with the most pronounced being sage.  Also had some bread and grass notes.  Mouthfeel eas full and creamy.  Nice clean aftertaste.  This beer would go great with a roasted chicken."

"I've got the feeling that this is an aged bottle, and for how long, I do not know - stated solely because of the timeliness of my encountering it. The spices are not only St. Patrick's Day-friendly, but (Canadian) Thanksgiving as well, so this is a seasonal offering, in a manner of speaking.  At any rate, nice to finally have gotten the chance to hit this particular DFH collaboration."

"Overall, I have the impression they mellowed this out from the initial offering (I realize I'm probably imagining it).  I recall the spices really reminding me more of thanksgiving, maybe just the sage was a bit stronger.  The smells and tastes were never overpowering, but they are muted in this pour.  A decent beer that I can leave until next year's offering to try again."

"O: has a nice character to it.  The ingredients complement each other well in this saison.  I'd drink it again, but wouldn't go out of my way to. 3.8"
""
""
""
""
""
"O-the components are representative of the style with a nice herbal touch that comes through in greater quantities with each sip(3.75)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Even though I found this brew very interesting and unique, the addition of the herbal spices wasn't great. A more citrusy touch and a less herbal touch would make this beer better in my opinion. Still refreshing, not as much as other Saisons, but very unique. I would have this again, but there are many other Saisons I would pick over this one. (3.5)"
""
""

"Brilliant golden with a moderate ivory head. Notes of lemon, thyme, and rosemary are accompanied by a touch of must and sage. Flavor is savory, with sage and parsley cleanliness forming the base, and lemon and thyme hitting mid palate. Rosemary carries into the lightly bitter finish, and notes of mint. Nice savory beer that I'll buy again and hold back for thanksgiving dinner."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Finishing creamy-dry, the beer's relative medium body is slow to relax and is content to retain low levels of malt sweetness and firm textures to linger on the palate. This buffers the effect of its sprucy perfume and might be somewhat of its saving grace."

"Overall I'm really not crazy about it. Not fresh anyway. I had a bottle of Stone's version that had been aged about 15 months the other week I enjoyed a lot more. The herbal notes were quite faded, albeit still present. There's much stronger lemon and citrus tastes which really hijack the beer, and change it for the better IMO. If I see anymore of these around I'll snatch a couple to lay down for a year. I'd give it overall a 3.5 fresh and a 4 aged, so for the overall score I met in the middle"

"Pours hazy and yellow with a soft pastel lightness to the appearance. A fat white head of foam that never falls completely and leaves lots of bubbles in a layer on top. Nose is light sweet biscuit and a sugary smell form malt. Then some savory herbal from the herbs that have been added. The nose is open and airy and light. Some hop floral. Taste is excellent. It has a a delicate malt with a soft and silken body. A few bubbles and an overall creaminess. The malt is a sweeetned biscuit and the herbs are prominent. The sage stands out the most and I love sage. They tickle the palate and make you think of herbal teas. The malt sweetness stands side by side with the herbs so that they do not become too pungent or loud in the drink. There is a sweet bit of lemon peel that comes forward as this warms and again in the after taste. This beer has an all over dryness and finishes with a light bitterness in the flavor as much as in the mouthfeel. The sweet lemon resonates in the aftertaste with the herbs. I loved this and thought it was one of the most unique beers I have had in this style."

"O: This is a weird beer: it's no Dupont (that's for sure), but it still manages to carve out a niche for itself. Its intense, seemingly imbalanced spice quotient is what gives it its charm. Worth a try."

"O - very unique, the spices really offset the sweetness nicely. very interesting for a saison but certainly enjoyable"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - first saison I have tried. Very refreshing and easily drinkable. the spice additions added interesting complex flavors without being overwhelming. I would like to try stones rendition for comparison."
"O: Not my favorite saison, but an interesting and drinkable take on the style. Good enough that I'll look for the same beer from Stone, just to see how they compare."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I get what these three were doing but the herbs were way too much for my palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The herbs are skillfully balanced and blend well with the crisp and refreshing Americanized Saison style underneath. I personally love these things was very happy to see them again after a 2 year hiatus."
"O = Interesting as standalone drink. Pairing might be good with something uncomplicated or cheese, as you'd want to taste the herbal nuances in the beer. It is not something I'd run back to purchase, but as a novelty, it's definitely worth the experience!"

"Very interesting. The beer pours a hazy yellow with a light head. The smell was easily my favorite part of the beer. It feels like you are directly smelling parsley and thyme. Very big notes from the earthy herbs. The taste was a little lack-luster though with big herb tastes in the beginning but I felt the ending wasn't as good and the sour taste at the end, while enjoyable, didn't leave a great lingering taste. This was a nice beer to try and appreciate the inventive style of Dogfish, but I don't know if I need more than one."

"The taste is full of herbal notes with a tart, almost sour bite at the finish."

"Overall, a delicious brew that will certainly satisfy foody beer nerds. A bold yet sophisticated use of herbs helps to elevate this saison to the likes of a true culinary experience."

"D – Had no idea what to expect here. Blown away in a new way, who knew thyme, sage, rosemary and whatnot had a place in beer. This is very complex and there is a lot going on, it's hard to pick up on all of it at once. It does somehow remain quite balanced. This is an exciting beer to drink due to its pure uniqueness. Don't know that I could have more than one every once in a great while, but this is one crazy concoction of a beer. Somehow it just works!"
""
""
""
"I am not a fan of this saison. The use of rosemary, parsley, sage, and thyme all at once was too much at once and I was unable to distinguish each flavor. It left a horrible Listerine after taste after drinking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D- Not what I expected at all, better! The aroma and flavor are so complex, but incredibly refreshing. I just hope I can hunt down another bottle. This is the first beer to really excite me in a while."

"Purchased at Tacoma Boys. Appearance is a hazy cloudy gold. White head that did not sustain very well. Aromatics are sweet and herby with hints of rosemary and sage. Flavors are also herby and slightly medicinal. Savory with a sort of savory vegetable aftertaste. Body is very smooth, drinkable and has a nice crispness. Overall this is good, different and quite herby for a saison but I appreciate the unique qualities."

"A turgid golden amber that gives a nice head and has good retention. Lacing is quite nice, and the beer remains covered all the way down. The aroma has a sweet pale malt body and light notes of the herbs used, not as big as the Stone version. A whisper of alcohol and not much funk. Taste is sugar biscuit malty with the herb blend and hops melding into a lovely complex counter to the sweetness of the malt. There is a white grape fruitiness that is great. An alcohol edge flows into the hops and herbs with a touch of mint. Finish is mild and dry with an herbal flavor that leave the blend lightly lingering. Feel is velvety smooth with a lightly creamy carbonation. Easy drinking and just light enough to quaff a little too fast. A nice one and while similar to the Stone version I find this one to be a touch more subtle in its herbs and maybe a touch more alcoholic."
""
"This poured out as a golden yellow color with a thin white head on top. The retention and lacing were very minimal. The smell of the beer is herbal, the aromas that come off of it the most of probably the sage, thyme and rosemary. The taste has the same herbal elements that the smell does but it doesn't last as long. The flavors kind of die off in this one in the finish. The mouthfeel of the beer is light bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Overall it's a good brew, I feel the Victory version was a lot more flavorful. I would like to get the Stone version to try that sometime. Regardless it's a decent beer and worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
"O – This is a pretty good beer. It’s pretty much what you would expect from the bottle – an herb-forward saison. I wish it had some of the funk that I like to find in beers of this style, but it’s still a pretty tasty and drinkable beer nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Spicy and tangy beer. Weird. Not bad at all though."
""
""
"Reviewed from notes."
""
"This is glorious. A beautiful blend of spices. Bright, floral, crisp."
""
""
""
""
"Light coloured with some retained head, and leaving a lace trail. Aroma is very good, the sage leads the nose, and there is White pepper and a blend of other spices and nices. Medium mouthfeel, its a palate tingler, but it goes down well, leading to...good drinkability. A new age saison, I may have liked this version the best."
"O - Pretty tasty beer, but probably not the style I'd look for in the future. It was good for a change in pace from the usual, but not all that memorable for me style-wise."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a two finger white head that fades very slowly leaving a good lace. Almost clear amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Savory nose and flavor follows - sweet and savory, not a fan of saisons but this is one of the best. $3.50 for a 12oz bottle from Tully's Beer and Wine Wells, ME."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a unique experience. The closest I can compare it to is Rosee D'hibiscus. I would call it more of a herb beer, since that is the dominant flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a cloudy dirty beige color ale with a good foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of spices including spices with solid rustic malt backbone and some nice fruity floral ester. Taste is a great complex mix between some rustic malt with some great notes of sage with nice floral undertones. Thyme and parsley are harder to detect then the other ingredient. Body is full with good carbonation. Solid offering that I would love to have regular access to."
""
""
""
"perhaps this just reminds me of Mama Mia Pizza Beer, interesting concept and I can't remember why I recognize parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme in that sequence, song lyrics?"

""

"O: Interesting to try, pretty good even, but I wouldn't buy it again Unfortunately I haven't been able to find the other two, but I'll keep looking."
"One of the trio of Saison du Buff's brewed. This one ranks in the middle for me but still an excellent brew. Pour is golden yellow with a slight cloudiness to it. Good head and lacing on the glass. Smells is of spices and other citrus fruits. Taste is heavy spice - a good saison and the strongest of the 3 in the spice category. Hops are very floral. Specific malt is harder to detect. Excellent brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - i am a sucker for herbs. The smell is just awesome. It makes me think of pizza and sunday gravy etc. but alone the flavors are strong and a bit too much. This is a great food beer."
""
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a chalice at cool temp. Golden/pale amber, very little head, a few bubbles lazily drifting up. Fairly clear. The nose is vegetal and floral, and quite pronounced. The flavor shows typical saison notes (a little bit of sulphur, grainy malt) and a leafy, hay-like quality. The finish is quite dry. There is more carbonation prickliness than seems likely from the pour. Light-bodied, despite a reasonably high alcohol content. A very interesting experimental beer of the ""garden"" saison type. I'd drink it again, but one at a sitting seems about right."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Interesting, even with the blatant rosemary it gave me the impression of being like a cucumber herbal/medicinal aftertaste. Even though I like this for its unique flavor, I'm not sure it would be in regular rotation for me if it were available in my state. But I would try it again as it's a solid collaboration brew; in a way it made me think of the cucumber saison by Cigar City. And that's refreshing."
""
""
"The beer pours a hazy yellow-orange-gold with a light soap bubble head that dissipates quickly and leaves little clouds of lacing on the sides. This is another dehydrated piss-looking beer, and it has some lovely carbonation seen through its murky interior. The beer smells richly biscuity with some lovely subtle spice notes which must surely be parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme. The spices give the nose a slightly minty cool feel, and there is some wet citrus floating at the edges of the smell, which suggest oranges and lemon. The beer tastes surprisingly bananay with the esters, and biscuity with strong citrus undertones. The spice is much softer in the taste, leaving a hint of mint in the aftertaste mixing with the bread and banana esters to suggest a wheat malt backing. Mouthfeel is superbly clean and refreshing, making this an excellent summer beer. The mouth is only barely kissed with saliva after the beer passes, and is ringing with a slight spicy burn that helps to beg for more beer. Carbonation is bubbly and frothy in the mouth which helps the flavoring feel fresh in quick and the mouth, and probably washes away some of the more brutal bite from the spices. This beer reminds me more of a spicy wit than a saison but that isn’t a bad thing. Overall it is a fantastic summer sipper and a lovely collaboration by Dogfish Head, Stone, and Victory. If I can find the other two I will definitely try them, but I’d say Dogfish Head has done this beer well to their company’s name. It is a quirky saison that is more of a wit and definitely worth a sip."
"O- Two words: ""Almost Perfect."" This is a great Saison/Farmhouse. Not anything more needs to be said. This made it into my top 5 collab beers, and I still have two other versions to try still (Stone, Victory). You can't be disappointed with this ale."

"Overall – Not something I'd reach for very often, but an interesting tasting beer. Lots of herbal/spicy notes going on."
"Overall this is a unique and quality beer, worth a try or a 6-pack if you're bored..."
""
""
""
""
"A nice saison, in the upper-middle tier of those that I've had. Very herby, and especially sagey, which isn't surprising, given the additions. But it has the soul of a saison."
""
""
"Overall: Paid 3 for this bottle, very interesting beer with unique tastes. Wonder how different the other versions are."
"Overall, very interesting beer, glad I tried it."
"O- Very interesting and I think you should taste this, but I couldn't drink many"
""
""
""
"O: I was really impressed by this brew. Very refreshing and hoppy."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Although the flavors are decently balanced, I've found when cooking that parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme isn't the best combination and the same hold true here the just don't get along that well. The saison character is a bit muted which is to be expected with the herbs taking center stage."
""
""
""
""

"when poured, it has a hazy golden color body with a 2""head that lays down quickly to a thin lace around the edge. The smell is like straight out of a herb garden, rosemary and sage dominate then the tyhme and parsley come after. The taste is like the aroma, spicy but just like the smell, rosemary and sage dominate the taste also. The mouth feel is nice goes down nice and easy. Overall this is a good beer."

"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied. The carbonation is very light. It partially coats the mouth but isn't too sticky. Enjoyable feel."

"O - A very enjoyable, spicy saison. Drinkabilty is high, flavor has a nice richness. This is a beer that would pair extremely well with chicken and other meat dishes."
"Cheers!"

"Taste-Spicy, herbal, lemongrass, nice little hop presence. Overall flavors well-balanced and seem to play well together. Nothing overdone. A nice match for lighter fare."

"Great drinkability, this a darn tasty saison and it would be easy to put back a couple. This is a great collaboration between three of my favorite breweries."
""
""
"Mouthfeel and Overall - Light bodied and unique, as I've come to expect from Dogfish Head. A nice collaberation between Stone, Victory and DFH. A bit of a skunky aftertaste in the end."
"O: A good saison; compared to Victory's offering of the beer which I tried in early 2011, this seems much less herbal, with grassiness in its place. It almost seems like a yeasted up pilsener at times. Worth a try, and I certainly enjoyed the half glass that I had."
""
""
"i can't believe how good these herbs taste in a beer. Very surprisingly delicious. Need to drink more saisons."
""
"I was craving a saison all day at work yesterday, so when i looked in the beer fridge last night, this one fit the bill. This one came highly recommended by 2 reputable sources, so i was looking foward to it. Poured into a snifter, a hazy golden brew with a nice white foamy head. Has the typical spicey saison smell, ad a bit of sweet malt and a tad citrus. The flavor starts out alot like a typical delicious saison too, but those subtle herbs swirling around throughout work really nicely. Herbal flowery notes, with the sweetness and the bit of spiciness. This is nice. Enjoyed drinking this one, and could see myself possibly having a couple more before this summer ends."
""
""
"Poured into a DFH glass a nice cloudy golden pale yellow color, with a nice one-finger thick creamy/fizzy white head, which does leave some nice sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, with alot of yeast notes, very nice touch of spice also. The taste is slightly bitter, malty, yeasty, with some rosemary, thyme, and sage very upfront. Medium body. A very nice brew to have on a HOT day."
""
""
""
"Overall. Nice use of herbs in this one, it all got along well together. Tastes much better than I would have thought from the ingredients list."
"An interesting and tasty beer, though not one I'd have regularly."
""
"O - If you gave this to me in December, I'd swear it was a holiday beer. The herbs are unique but a bit overpowering overall, but keep coming back to thinking that it tastes like a lot of holiday beers I've had (mostly Schlafly's Christmas Ale), but with a lighter body and less alcohol. The thyme notes are reminiscent of DC Brau's Thyme After Thyme. A unique session beer, but will space my tastings out."
""
""
"M/T: Amazing spices all on their own--parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme harmonize to just the right tone of herbal flavor with a seamless blend to deliver lemon accented spice and flavor. Carbonation and milder crisp malt lend generously to the spices and citrus at work. ""Off-centered"" from the classic saison, no doubt, but delicious..."
""
"Thankfully, my bro was nice enough to part with one of these. I'm surely not disappointed in the least with this. I look forward to other collaborative efforts between DFH, Victory and Stone. This is not one to pass up. VERY good take on the style. Highly sessionable brew."
"The aroma is herbal with all the expected qualities plus hay like hops and malt. The appearance is golden with a nice head. The taste is like the aroma with a touch of cooked veggies. The palate is average. Overall a very unique beer that I like and would drink again."

"A great collaboration brew here from three of the best breweries. I loved this one; a big time session brew that has lots going on in terms of flavor and mouthfeel. Great stuff."
""
""
""
""
"O- Unique beer, I don't think I would want a whole lot of this but it does push the envelope of what beer can be. The 6.8% ABV is not over the top but the strong flavors rule it out as a sessionable beer, it's more a one and done beer."
""
"Overall: perfect degree of sweetness. Varies from yeasty and stronger herbal presence of other of this style. Very drinkable."
""
"Nice, but certainly not up to the standard of a classic saison."
""
""
""
"An interesting experiment, but not what I expected and another beer I’m glad I tried but I would not try again unless it was a food pairing designed to compliment this beer. Each sip had sensory distortion as the aroma coming up through my tulip glass just blasted me with herbs and kept the overall experience out of synch. Gotta support the cause and the craft beer movement, but these misses are like collateral damage in the war to keep the beer machine flowing. One and done on this collaboration."
"M&D - smooth and sharp all at once, great flavor amalgam, spices are not for the uninitiated"
""
""
""
""
"O - As with a number of Dogfish beers, it's interesting but I'm glad I only bought one in a pick-a-six instead of a whole fourpack. I don't really want another. With that said, this might pair nicely with Thanksgiving dinner. I think it would complement turkey and dressing, though I'm not sure I want it to pair quite as directly as it would."

"originally reviewed: 10-29-2010"
"This beer alone tastes different then when you are eating. It tastes so much beeter when you are eating. It has parsley, sage, rosemary & thyme. What a fantastic mea or summer beer! I really love this beer (and usually prefer hoppy beers). $10 a glass @ pizza parisisio in dupont circle. The first time i had it was @ churchky so i knew it would be a great pairing for my luncch!"
""
""
"Very drinkable and refreshing beer! Typical Dogfish quality!!"
""
"D - Better than I ever would have guessed. It is worth trying. I would assume the other two breweries' versions are roughly identical. I certainly would drink it everyday, but it is refreshing in the heat for sure."
""
""
"Overall This is a good beer. I would like to try the other two to see if the different breweries have different flavors even though it says they have the same recipe."
"O: Very satisfied. I can't wait to have again. Not my usual favorite type of beer, but Du BUFF will definitely be added to favorite list. The lemon and spices work amazingly in this beer without being to over powering. Highly recommend."
""
""
""
"O: Like the other Du BUFF's, quite good and tasty. They all have their own uniqueness, glad I finally got to try the last of them."
"Pours light yellow and carries an etched surface of white foam and residual spots of lace remain. Slightly yeasty, coriander, thyme and rosemary dominate this one for me. Flavor is substantially more belgian yeast and herbal character. A bit of a nutty hint from the yeast. The herbs are primarily parsley and thyme with burnt sage and some bitterness in the midpoint. Thin bodied with subdued carb and semi dry finish. Decent beer."
"C-"
""
""
"I'm excited about this one. Poured from a bottle into a duvel tulip. Pours a dark golden yellow with 2 fingers of white head that slowly shrinks to a pinky. Nice lacing. Aroma is total parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme. Light bread qualities are there but tough to find. I feel that if I was drinking this any colder than 45 degrees I'd miss it. Taste is the same herbs mentioned. There is also a grassy citrus quality and the Belgian yeast is there too. Medium to thin mouthfeel. This beer is different and really good. I imagine it would be perfect with lamb chops."
"I had this one in a pint glass. Poured with a thick 3-4"" of head. The color was a really nice, murky yellow. I knew this wasn't the saison I was looking for when I took a whiff. Instead of the spicy fruity tones of a saison, I got hops. The taste was more of the same. DFH does hops. I was intrigued to see them produce a style that traditionally leans more on spice for flavor. But with DFH and Stone on the label, it had to be hops in the bottle. It isn't a bad beer, it just isn't a good saison."
"O: I haven't had many saisons, but I think this is one I could go to as far as saisons. This may be not something I could drink all of the time, but actually be my go-to saison if needed."
""
""
""
""
"O- I think I liked the idea more than the execution for this beer. The spices seemed to overshadow the delicate flavors of the saison beneath."
""
"Overall: Having been so disappointed with the Stone version a few years ago, I was delighted with the brew that Dogfish has put together here; the spices blend together nicely rather than dominate and the mouthfeel is light - just perfect for these warming days"
"O- I remember the herbs coming through a lot more in the first batch, but still a very good and unique beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: this is a highly drinkable brew and really stands out as a taste in a saison that i have yet to see, often times i find them incredibly peppery and have yet to find the more herbal spices i saw in this one"
"Not my favorite American-made saison, but a solid experiment. Second year in a row that I've tasted Dogfish Head's version without ever giving the other two a try. I'll keep looking. 4.0"
"Note: Drank on 4/5/2012."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M: light/medium, slight warmth of alcohol"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I went into this one thinking it would be too spicy, bitter (I know most breweries like to add ""extra"" hops to styles, or even tart and lemony but this beer is crafted really perfectly. A must have for any fan of the style or ""one off"" beers of Dogfish."
""
"Overall its a very unique saison. I enjoy it and would drink again in a second. Having the Victory next to this which is slightly milder in taste, a tad stronger in smell, and has a clear body with less head."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - an enjoyable departure from the norm. Well crafted, perhaps a tad out of balance on the hop side but lots of interesting flavors going on here. Not sure if its an every day beer, but surely is a very nice visit to once in a while to keep things interesting."
""
"Over all, a very nice Saison. Wouldn't mind trying the other two iterations."
"Pours a dark golden amber with a large lasting white head. Aroma of parsley, sage, rosemary, with some fruity citrus notes and some light malt as it warms up. Taste is same as aroma with a bit of malt, grains and slight hops bitterness. Palate is a light to med body, soft carbonation, crisp and refreshing mouth feel. Finish is dominated by parsley, rosemary, sage flavor, some fruity citrus notes with some hops bitterness on the end for balance and a lingering nutty, parsley flavor. Overall a good, crisp, refreshing and tasty brew."
""
""
"I also agree with the review directly below in that the only real problem with this beer is the price tag. At roughly $52 for a case, it's not the cheapest of craft beers. But I certainly like it, and look forward to brewing a homebrew version with the recipe straight out of Stone's book. Cheers!"
"Morey’s Bottom Line: I found this beer really refreshing back in 2010 while BBQing by the pool at our resort. It’s unseasonably warm today, and it’s like deja vu. I really like this beer a lot. You would never guess that it’s 6.8%. The only thing that will keep me from drinking this all summer long is the price. At $3.99 per 12oz. bottle, it’s just not within my budget. If you see this on the shelf, I highly recommend grabbing a 6 pack (or at least a couple of bottles)."
""
""
""
"O: I can only imagine that there must be an awesome food pairing here. Thanksgiving? Maybe. Unfortunately, though, I just don't find these particular spices to be that appetizing in a beer. I don't see enough of the saison character here either--it's mostly overwhelmed. Some lemon or citrus would go a long way in balancing the spice."
""
""
"I had soured a bit on DFH after trying a couple of sub-par offerings recently, in particular the PJ 20 ale which tasted slightly better than Budweiser. They've redeemed themselves with this one. A very unique saison that I would have more of it it wasn't so expensive."
""
"Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a light orange straw color. Thin, fine off-white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of bready malt, sage and other european herbs. Nice intriguing aroma. Flavor follows, with a nice laid back bready malt and complex herbs. I can pick out sage, but the herbal component is well blended and nothing really dominates. The herbal level seems perfect for the malt backbone to support. Thought I detected a hint of funk in the finish, but it may be the herbs. A very nice, medium to heavy body with creaminess. I thought this was very nicely balanced and has an interesting flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Mouthfeel is fine- light body, moderate carbonation. A little prickly, crisp, pretty refreshing. Maybe a little better than the Victory because of the appearance and the aroma but might not taste as good. Hard to say."

"Overall this beer is a tad bit pricey (clocking in at $4 a 12oz bottle), but is a relatively good bargain considering its novelty within the beer world."

"Overall, what an amazing beer! I love saisons anyway but the little bit ""extra"" in this just puts it over the top. I picked this up on a trip to Ohio and wish I would have grabbed several more bottles."
""
""
""
""
"O: Very impressed with this. If you enjoy good food, cooking with lots of herbs and the like, you should def try this beer. Again, not the best beer i've ever had but very unique, enjoyable, complex."
""
""
""
""
""
"Aside: Actually as I drink more the taste has seemed to morph from all bitter at the end to bitter finishing with malty sweetness. Very interesting and very nice."
"O-Scarborough Fair is a better song and The Graduate is a better movie. The beer is decent but and the end of the day the meshing of flavors is slightly off."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I had the Victory version last year, and was very impressed. This one came up a bit short with too much emphasis on sweetness and not enough on the belgian yeasts that define the style. There is almost no funky Brett to be had here. I am happy I tried it, but I probably won't get it again."
""
"O: Interesting take on a saison. Easily the most ""Italian"" beer I've ever had."
"O: Not bad. It would be a good food beer, seems tailor-made to go with herb encrusted chicken."
""
"not the best collaborative effort of these brewers. i thought sure, a simon and garfunkel beer (made of course with parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme), but this one is off. pours a clear golden color, too clear for a saison right? small white head. smells is not nearly as herbaceous as i thought it might be, with only really the rosemary appearing aromatically. all yeast in the nose. flavor the only herb i can taste is the sage, and its kind of funky in here. combined with the others and this unpleasant yeast, i dont care for this much. feel is okay, lighter but too lightly carbonated. i appreciate the attempt to do something new, but this isnt very good at all."
""
"Overall, a nice spin on a farmhouse ale. The spices added really make this one special."
""
"M - Light to medium body with moderate carbonation."
"D - Not bad, one of the better collabs I've had in quite some time. I would revisit this one without a second thought."
""
""
""
""
"When I had the Stone version it was my first Saison and one of the first 50 reviews I had done. It is cool to see how my reviews have evolved in almost two years."
""
""
""
"I'm not too impressed with this offering from DFH and I'm not surprised about that. A couple of years back DFH was routinely putting out high quality, tasty and innovative brews but it's almost like they are trying too hard nowadays. This one feels too gimicky w the parsley sage rosemary and thyme and it fails in execution. I'm not even sure this should be called a saison. I'm glad I tasted it but also glad I only purchased one and will not be buying more in the future."
""
""
"Overall, if you like herbal and floral flavors this beer will be for you. It is all right. Not very saison like. Not funky at all. More like a golden ale with a lot of spices. It's okay."
"Pours a faded gold color, and initially has a high, effervescent head as well, which recedes to about 1/4 in. Still a decent amount of carbonation. Aroma - picking up a sharp herbal character from the thyme/rosemary/sage/parsley that was added. Has a bit of a smoked beer hint to it as well. I also notice the farmhouse yeast in there. Flavor - as others have said, just what the description says - imagine a Belgian pale, with added herbs and a bit of farmhouse funk. (not too much of the latter though). The mouthfeel/body is typical for a Saison. Overall, I did not expect much out of this, as I tend not to care for the really 'out there' beer ingredients, but in this case, it is very interesting that all of the elements in this mesh nicely. Good to drink by itself, and I bet this would pair well with mild hors d'oeuvres when entertaining. Now I'm curious about what the Victory and Stone versions are like..."
""
""
"If you have ever wanted a beer that smells like a fancy country store soap, or wondered what would happen if Simon and Garfunkel started brewing, you have found your beer. It exemplifies why rosemary, sage, and thyme are not standard ingredients for beer. At $3.99 per 12oz bottle, make sure you buy just one. I found it interesting and unique, but had no desire for another one. Though it did leave me feeling clean :)"
"Overall, this was a nice saison. Glad I got to try it but wouldn't seek it out again."
""
"O- Overall, I really enjoyed this beer! It is unlike anything I have ever tried and I love the creativity of adding all of these spices that I love and use everyday into this beer. Highly recommended!"
""
""
"O: A very interesting combination of the spices with a saison but not especially easy to drink or refreshing. I don't think I would be likely to purchase this one again."
"Poured on-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a bright, crystal clear yellow-gold coloring with a steady flow of carbonation and a low profile, bubbly, light head that is bright white. Aromas of spearmint, cedar, and pepper on a roasted grain backbone. Flavors are cedar and pine initially, like a moutful of evergreen, with a brightly sweet spearmint kick at the tail end of the palate. Spices abound the more you drink, with a strong rosemary and thyme character dominating. Very green on the palate, if you will. Like knocking a spice rack into the brew. Decnt layered lacing along the glass as you consume. The aftertaste has a touch of malty tang quickly overwhelmed by the spice profile once again, with a quick, tangy finish. Spicing lingers, but also cleans the palate. This one is dynamic, and actually works your tastebuds...it's like a challenging hike for your palate."
"O: I like the complexity of this beer. Lots of flavor coming everywhere. Between the nose and taste, this is one unique brew. Love it!"
"I'd recommend to split a bottle with someone if you see this, but don't go crazy and buy a bunch. Good experience, but it no way my favorite saison."
""
"Pours a hazy gold with amber hues with a three finger head bright white head and heavy lacing. Great retention. The savory smell of herbs dominates accented by yeast. Grassy hops and bread are upfront, followed by the mildest touch of malt. Finishes with a bouquet of herbs. Wonderfully carbonated light body that is smooth and velvety. A very interesting saison that I liked even more than expected. Looking forward to trying some creative food pairings with my remaining bottles."
"O - Saison Du BUFF is a well-crafted and interesting saison. It's very herbal, which is unique and will be the huge determining factor of your enjoyment...I love the smell and was a bit cool on the taste. I may not have been crazy about it, but we each have our own tastes and as I said, it is clearly well-constructed. Worth a try if you like herbs and/or saisons."
""
"Not a lot of alcohol here and it didn't contribute to the taste at all. I could only feel the warming effect of it once I made my way through the drink and the flavors were able to stand out on their own. This was not something I'd down quickly or would offer to a novice beer drinker but I can honestly say that I've never had anything quite like this. The finish was clean to this and the spice wasn't too much to take. Kudos for pushing the edge of what a spicy beer can be - this is worth a try for fans of any of the three Brewers involved in this collaboration."
"Brewed with parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme. Pours a clear lighter amber, one finger soapy white head turns into a thin ring and splotchy lace in a minute. Smell: lemon, slight evergreen, but also muddy and weedy (parsley’s contribution, I suppose). Taste: the sage and thyme dominate over a grainy pale malt base, slightly salty with some lemon. Medium bodied from creamy but aggressive carbonation, drying out some at the end of the sip. Yeah, the parsley is bringing nothing good to the table here. Overall the herbs are a little over the top, but was worth a shot. Bottled 2012 B."
""
"O: easy to drink and decent all around. I didn't get the yeast presence I like, but it's a well made saison at $3/bottle."
""
""
""
""
"O/D-Not a big fan of this. The spices are too noticeable. At least this was not too pricey at under $3 for a small bottle. Won't try again."
"Pours a clear light golden orange, with a fair amount of champagne like carbonation that gives it a 2 finger head that steadies to a tight bubbled lace around the top. Brewed with Rosemary and Thyme...wow, no shit, rosemary kick right in the face. Rosemary, mixed with lemon, semi sour grassy scent from the thyme id assume, very bready and full of flavor, odd flavors however. Rosemary, lemon, pepper, nice familiar saison flavors mixed with overwhelming helpings of spice, clove, grass, pine needles, and a big funk on the finish. Light in body, fair amount of carbonation, very sparkly and fizzy, bold and spicy and finishes bitter. Overall, def not the best saison ive ever had but absolutely the strangest. Odd mixture of flavors that absolutely work in every way, the spice is really heavy on this one but well worth a try. cheers!"

"Poured from bottle to Duvel tulip the beer arrives a orange golden color with a decent 1 finger white head, some retention and good lacing throughout. The nose is full of the spice, predominantly rosemary, that the beer is brewed with. Hints of pepper and thyme and a bit of apple fruitiness together with the saison yeast. The beer starts with a prominent wheat base from which the fruity character found in the nose builds. Lemon and orange. The spices then enter and dominate the taste with again a large rosemary and thyme character, a little too much for my liking, but not too bad. Earthy pine hop character provides a medium bitterness. Finishes with a lingering rosemary wheat flavor on the tongue. Crisp and clean. Well carbonated and ligher bodied. Overall, not a bad beer, though I would prefer the herbs to be toned down a bit more."
""
"poured the re-release of this beauty into a tulip glass.. hazy golden yellow with a nice amount of head and great lacing. very bready smell, aromas of flowers, honey, rosemary definitely, and a touch of bitter hops. bitter up front with a tang that releases the rosemary and thyme flavors, cascade hops?, some lemon peel flavor. this is slightly more bitter than i remember it being back in 2010, but is still a great beer. it's a cross from light to medium body, very fizzy on the roof of the mouth. very crisp and refreshing. overall, a great beer - can't wait to try my favorite version (stone)"
""
"One bottle is enough, you are duly amazed and prepared for a subsequent feast of roast pork belly with, perhaps, a Tripel to go with it."

""
""
""
""
""
"I love a beer that tastes like when it says it should taste like. I was afraid that the herbs would be overpowering, but the beer was nice and light, yet full, and tasted every bit like the parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme brewed into this glorious beer."
""
"A golden orange with a decent white head that quickly becomes a small white head and then gravitates to the edges. Decent retention. A very herby aroma, totally unique to me to be coming from a beer, with a sweetness to it. That aroma is right there in the flavor too. A nice malt base to this and the herbs kick in mid stream. Very up front; gMedium bodied to this, not much carbonation at all. I enjoyed my first few sips but the more of it I drank the more I found the flavor to start to become too much and I barely could finish the bottle."
""
"This is a pretty decent beer. I could actually go for a more intense herbal flavor, maybe matching the nose. It's balanced though, drinkable and refreshing. I would have it again."
""
"at first i was a little taken back by the big aromas of herbs and spices, but as this warms some hops come out and play off the herbs very nicely. sometimes its almost unclear whether its the hops or the herbs your tasting. well done, id love to session this all day."
"Overall – I really enjoyed the appearance and aroma of this beer. Both were very nice. The actual taste of the beer while it is in the mouth is quite nice, but the aftertaste really takes away from the overall greatness of the beer. It has interesting ingredients and good qualities with the exception of the aftertaste and is worth a try."
""
""
"What comes in later is a welcome surprise: sage, rosemary, and thyme. Those spices come in very late and really felt upon exhale. Feels slick. Not real sure I like that part of the beer."
""
""
""
"O: A unique and delicious collaboration, almost like a citrus tea in flavor, great balance"
"Overall (4.0): Very well-done, in my opinion. What’s most remarkable about this brew is that it’s just so well balanced, more than anything else. The malt, the yeast, the spices—they all get their time to shine, even if the parsley, sage, rosemary & thyme take center stage. This would be a superb accompaniment to the right dish, too. Haven’t tried the Stone or Victory versions of this beer, but I’d be curious to test them out side-by-side. This one is a keeper though, would definitely buy it again."
""
"O - I can't trust my memory. Perhaps this surpassed the Victory version...maybe not. I don't care. This is damn delicious. The herbs have a subtle presence, but it never comes off as a herbed or flavored beer. Its very well integrated into the earthy flavors of the saison. I'm glad they re-brewed this beer, one of my favorite collaboration beers."
""
""
"O- This was a pretty decent saison. Not my favorite but definitely above average. A little bit tangier/fruitier then your average saison. Nice appealing smell and an easy to drink taste. Recommended to try, but probably won't buy again since they only sell in single bottles at my local liquor store."
"Interesting. It's quite a delicate flavor across the board, despite having a hearty saison core. Some staple flavors are there: lemon, core Belgian yeasts, a very slight touch of funk. The interesting parts come from the herbs. They're all present if you want to focus on it, but work better together for a nice, fresh, herbal undertone that provides a refreshing crispness and a unique take on the saison. Rosemary and thyme linger a bit later, but that's okay :) Tad too much drying until you've been drinking it a bit, but not bad. Pleasant beer. I would eat this with some roasted chicken and root veggies . . . hell yes."

"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer and will be picking up a few bottles if I spot it in the area."

"O- Quite a letdown from my perspective as these are 3 of my favorite breweries collaborating and this is what they came up with. Just proof of how, when ideas sound good on paper, they don't always come out well when executed."

"D: [DRINKABILITY] DFH Saison du BUFF is a good beer that could be greatly improved with a more solid mouthfeel. In any case, drinkability suffers (as it did in all three versions) from the herbs that were used. While they add depth and complexity, they are not suited for long term enjoyment."

"O- Pretty nice refreshing beer. I think I have had the Victory version and should try the Stone next and see how they compare."
"Sam and Co. have done it again. Well done, Dogfish."
" Not being a big Saison fan I went in with low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised. While the herbs add a pleasant aroma they were subtle and delicious in the background of this mild yet flavorful brew. Very fulfilling mouthfeel with just Just enough Hops to keep me interested. I was surprised to finish this beer wishing I had another."
"Creamy, full bodied, and crisp. Also astringent and heated for a 6.8%. There is a significant amount of alcohol floating around here that can't find a home for itself. Carbonation isn't overwhelming but very noticeable. I feel like it hides the true flavors of the beer, which for what I can detect is a positive aspect. Well done on the mouthfeel of this beverage. A bit drier than other Saison Du Buffs, but it does present more sweet background to play with. I feel like this one hits it stronger on the head for a saison, but still not amazing. Definitely the best of the bunch from what I've had."
"O - Honestly, this was a lot better then I was thinking it was going to be. There is a lot going on in the sense of a traditional Saison, and the herbal bouquet adds a whole new level. Very interesting brew."
"O: Saisons are quickly becoming one of my favorite type of beers. This is a well done version made between three great breweries. It has a lot of complex smells and flavors, but it does not have as much funk as the Belgium saisons. The flavors range: honey, citrus fruit, pepper, and herbs. It is sweet at first, but it becomes drier towards the finish."
"From notes. Tasted in mid-August 2010 from bottle at Lush Roscoe. Pours a clear pale golden color with a minimal white head that still displays good retention. Nose is Belgian yeast with some candi sugar and a strong herbal aroma as well. The flavor is more of the same with a good amount of sweetness and very strong green and herbal flavors. Body is medium with active carbonation and a long herbal finish."
"Complex and refreshing in a great way with herb notes and that guava fruitiness bursting at the seams. Saisons can be hit or miss depending on the drinker but I think this is a winner in my book"
"Overall: Thanks to inlimbo77 for this good beer. I like it a lot. Stone Dogfish Head and Victory, what is there to not like?"
"overall a good beer that i recommend everyone try if you find it. (I stumbled across it at the local store)"
"Poured into a pint glass a slightly cloudy, golden yellow, nice and carbonated, with a huge, thick, four-finger white head as a result of an aggressive pour. Herbal sediment noticeable in the pour and in the bottle; ergo, the beer got cloudier as I poured more. Citrus in the nose, earthy, and herbal, with the rosemary primarily noticeable. Powerful flavor, earthy, grassy, lots of citrus; despite the amount of spice used, it doesn't come across as being too strong in the spice department. Still, the rosemary probably contributes the most. Very smooth, sweet, flavorful but light. Light-medium mouthfeel, tasty, and easily drinkable."
"D - Very drinkable. The flavors are really well balanced and the spices are very well incorporated. The beer has a really nice dry feel to it throughout."
"Pours golden straw in color with big fluffy white head (several fingers thick). Almost clear, but a bit of yeast got in the glass. Herbal aroma with some yeasty notes. Very pleasant. Taste is all over the place - strong carbonation up front, dry finish and a mix of herbs in the middle. Not very pleasant for my taste, and I think drinkability suffers."
"I picked this up for the oddness factor, but don't see me looking for any more of it. This may sound weird, but I was thinking of chicken throughout the drink. All the spicing might lend themselves to a nice ""beer in the rear"" recipe or something."
"Overall, a very drinkable beer in line with the style but not anything I need to have again."
"It was really nice on this summery day. The seasons work with the warm weather."
"Overall: If I didn't have to smell it to drink it, it would be better. I wish I didn't still have the other 2 versions in my fridge. I would recommend this if you want to taste the result of too much pointless spicing. 3.5"
"The aroma was very, very nice. Rich notes of spices, apricot, light apple maybe and a touch of grain. As it warmed some light pepper like spice starts to come forward, nearly spot on. As I take the first taste, I expierence just what I wanted from this one. A light, perfectly carbonated saison. Light notes of fruit spiced up with hints of white pepper and a perfectly balanced mix between light grain and fresh grass in the finish. Smooth, delicate and perfectly drainkable, I was very impressed by just how good this one was."
"ps- it's also rather belchy. Drink with something, anything, to eat."
"Lager color with thick creamy head and high carbonation. Sweet grapefruit/lemon upfront and then the flavor changes to parsley, sage, rosemary, & thyme just like it says on the bottle. This beer is just spring-fresh, thats the best way to describe it. If it was sold in 6 packs or 4 packs I would definitely buy it."
"Exploded out of the bottle. Super slow pour didn't do much good.Explosive frothy airy off white head. Body is a light golden straw color, slightly hazy. Lacing is super chunky and sporadic. Nose is rosemary, thyme and parsley. This should be served with the roast chicken at Hammersley's Bistro in Boston.What holy fucking beer meets meat harmony that would be. Tastes like mint and basil. Wow. Not like any saison I have. The herbs aren't subtle! This is slightly drying and acidic. Such a surprise. Spicy. Nice hint of citrus. Feel is moderate with good carbonation."
"overall - good beer, easy to drink, and enjoyable, just wasnt as herby as i had expected, but still good"
"The taste starts sweat from the malts then goes herbal and floral in the middle thanks to the hops and other interesting ingredients. The palate is dry and bubbly, with the alcohol just on the verge of being sessionable. This beer drinks like a session saison for the Summer."
"D/O: This would be a great summer to fall transitional beer, and I'm pretty sure that is exactly when this was released last year. Kind of reminds me of a spiced octoberfest or summer ale. Easily drinkable and just a few will do a great job on you"
"Drink is somewhat so-so, despite the overpoweringly intense experience of drinking this beer. It's just a touch on the ""a bit too much"" scale for my taste, although I'd be hard-pressed to tell any saison lovers that something else would be a better choice."
"Giant, fluffy white cap, soapy bubbles, clumpy lacing and good head retention. The beer was a bit hazy and gold in colour. Nice aroma, lemons and citrus, floral, hint of tartness, fruity, a bit powdery. Sturdy bitterness, lemons and crackery malt, a little bready, less fruity than in the aroma. Mild peppery spice in the dry finish. Medium bodied with ample carbonation. Refreshing and tasty, an enjoyable farmhouse ale with solid hop character."
"It had a hazy pour with I would say a 2.5 finger head. As soon as I opened the bottle it smelled immediately of herbs, but mainly thyme. When I tasted the beer I got a slight amount of sage followed by rosemary, it finished with the grassy bitterness of parsley. The mouthfeel was actually surprised me and was a bit spicy. Overall it was a new experience for me I never had a very strong herbal beer before so this was hard to rate. But I do think that this beer would go good with a roast chicken or it could probably hold up to a grilled pork chop."
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into tulip. Cloudy/hazy yellow with big carbonation. Left a two finger foamy head. Aroma's biggest highlights are lemon peel and rosemary. I admit that I am not yet skilled at recognizing all the qualities of a Saison as I am somewhat new to the style, but at first taste I can tell that I will enjoy this brew. A pleasant tartness is met with creative herbal qualities that I can't quite put my finger on. I can, however, detect the rosemary and thyme. The mouthfeel is much like the few belgian style beers that I've recently started trying, with big carbonation almost like a champagne. Very pleasant beer that I would like to enjoy again!"
"I was on the fence on whether I liked this or the Stone version more at first, but when I think of which I would rather have again in the future, I think it would be the Victory."
"Pours a hazy yellow with a big head and some pretty lacing. The aroma is lots of cooking spice, sage, celery powder, parsley, and some nice fruity and floral hoppy notes. The flavor is again fruity but dry with a bit of crackery malt and plenty of bitterness, there is some cooking spice in there as well that makes for a bracing bitterness at times. The glass finishes somewhat transformed of what it was at first sip, messy and oddly minerally. Oddly this seemed less focused on the cooking spice than did the stone one, however there seemed to be more characteristics identifiable as 'saison' in this one than the stone. Honestly every one of these should be categorized as Herbed/Spiced beers."
"Starts with a sweet citrus and spicy it milds and finishes dry with a dry mouth the spices present themselves and finishes bitter much like you'd get from licking a lemon"
"Drinkability is good, I wouldn't want to have more than a bottle but its very nice in the 12 ounces."
"M/D - lively carbonated, light bodied with some unique flavors. the lemon flavors come through a bit too strong but its still enjoyable. I would have again just wouldn't seek it out."
"Enjoyable, I'm not usually a fan of the Farmhouse style but this one put a nice spin on the style."
"D: I really enjoyed this beer, it's not the style i usually drink but its quite nice. I would absolutely buy more/drink more of this. I would also love to try this with some rosmary grilled chicken this summer"
"I bought two 12oz Bottles of the Dogfishhead and Stone versions of the Saison du BUFF and drank them side by side on two separate occasions into a pint glass. Very light pour with a small 1-2 finger head, minimal lacing, but a small film remains atop the beer as you drink. Much less head and much less lacing than the Stone version. Citrus right up front, with some other herbs. I think I'm getting some rosemary. Good smell. Herbal and hoppy taste, much more smooth than the Stone version on both occasions. IMO it tastes better than the Stone. Smooth and light on the palate, much less carbonated (less punch) than Stone Final Verdict: While Victory looked and smelled better, I did like Stone's as well. Will I have either again? No."
"Drinkability - This spices in this saison didn't quite work. Instead of adding taste they kind of drowned out the beer. Just didn't work for me. Not a bad beer but not great either."
"During the summer, this would probably my go to, with a slice of lemon or orange to garnish. Still reasonably drinkable in winter too."
"Pours a clear yellow with white head. Smells mostly like Saison yeast. Flavors of oranges, rosemary, other spices and yeast come through. Very yeasty in flavor which is odd because I poured myself a very clear sample. Some black pepper notes going on at the end of the sip. Very acidic feeling. Thin body which is traditional for the style. I wish I had served it colder, and on a really hot day. Liking Victory's and Stone's Saison Du Buff so much, I wanted to like this one, but I had troubles with it. The flavors are interesting and unique, but I just didn't really like drinking this beer very much. Although it did get better as time went on, I would not call it one of DFH's best."
"D: Easy drinker, I'd really like to try this on a hot scorching summer's day."
"Perhaps, Odysseus and Gulliver's first reactions weren't incorrect--any giant, even those that are benign or gracious, cannot escape the nature of his size. A giant's tiny misstep is viewed from the lower perspective as an enormous error, a short stumble is seen as a crashing fall. Because saisons are best when balanced, any tipping toward one extreme or another can be a tragedy to the essence of the style--so when a trio of brewing giants makes such an imbalance, it is unfortunately magnified in the mouth and heart of this reviewer."
"I do always give credit to DogFish Head brewers. They can come up with all sorts of different variations on beers"
"I think I like this better than Stone's version since the idea behind the beer comes through more than the hop-heavy out of San Diego County. But then again does one prefer an onslaught of hops or an onslaught of herbs. I prefer the hops, but the thought behind this beer was the herbs. So DFH's may be truer to the concept, but the Stone version might be more drinkable."
"Drinkability - decent, not sure id buy it again though (just not my style)"
"Darker in colour with less head than stone but more head than victory. Smells mostly of sage. Can't smell the other spices very well. Tastes stongly of sage and thyme. I don't get any parsley... Maybe some rosemary. Highly carbonated. Fairly tasty and very drinkable"
"Future outlook: Solid collaboration....nevertheless, brewed once, so this was it..."
"D - A tasty interesting beer."
"Mouthfeel is approtiate for the style. Lively carbonation and prickly mouthfeel and a nice dry finish. The herbs are dominant but never overpowering and make each sip exciting and different glad I have a couple more bottles to enjoy."
"Numbingly yummy. :)"
"D- reminds me of Dogfish's Sahtea. Really heavy on the herbals...like I said, reminds me more of cold tea than beer"
"Drink 5"
"a pale cloudy golden beer with a large foamy white head and good lace. light peppery aroma with a grainy sweet background. lemon peppery washes over the tongue with a clean dry finish. has a very light sweet aftertaste.very smooth mouthfeel and drinkability."
"D: One of the most interesting beers that I've had in a very long time. The herbs were so present, not at all what I expected (often it's hard to taste ""infused"" beers). That being said, it had great balance for something that likely began its life as something of a dare. I give it an A+ just for the sheer imagination of it. Never would have thought it possible, eally inspiring for a home brewer."
"D - I was surprised at it's drinkability, I could definitely have a few of these and not get tired of it. I would definitely consider going to the store and buying this one"
"Had this beer at some of the local Alehouses here and in bottles. Pours a very light golden color with some hues of yellow. The head forms actually very nicely and does not go overboard. The aroma is of a very light floating on air spice, that tingles the nose a bit. The taste is just plain refreshing and with a great earthy spice to it. Drink ability is very high with this low alch level and great flavor that does not over whelm the taste buds. Whenever I see this brew on the shelf it is a must pick up. Try to keep as much as I can in the beer fridge."
"If you are a fan of wheat beers, light but flavorful belgians, and green or chamomile tea, this should be right up your alley, but otherwise will not likely inspire great cravings for you. Not a favorite style of mine, but by the end of a glass, I am coming around a bit. Even though it is not my favorite style, I can really tell this is a well-crafted beer."
"As for drinkability, it is definitely easy to drink but the complex and in your face flavors from all the ingredients makes it a little too much to have a bunch of. However, for the high alcohol content, it is not so apparent when you are drinking it."
"It is no surprise that Dogfish Head's version of Saison Du BUFF is just as enjoyable as Stone's version. This is a killer recipe cooked up and executed some of the best in the business. Next up... Victory Saison Du BUFF."
"d- good, very tasty beer, one of my favorites of 2010, preferred the other versions but this is good too. really hope they resurrect this one!"
"A slightly hazy golden yellow with a billowing white head after a pretty aggressive pour out of the Dogfish bottled version. Very herbal nose. Rosemary is significantly dominate. Lemony citrus and sage play a secondary role. You also get a faint doughy yeast aroma. Flavor was pretty herbal as well. I actually got a minty note mid-drink that clung about even after the swallow. For the style, I found this to be oddly refreshing. I really like saisons, but this doesn't have the farmy outdoor angle. It is, however, a really good beer. Drinks like a 4 percenter."
"Drinkability: I like it; I don't love it. But, I'm glad I got it, and I'm conjuring up all sorts of meals and dishes to pair this with: omelettes, salads, falafel, good gyros. Overall, it reminds me of a good gruit ale, a style that I'm quite fond of. The creativity angle also inspires me to bump my score up a bit."
"Drinkabilty - Im having a hard time finishing this. Very strange spices mixed in giving this a odd flavor. WOuld like to try this without the rosemary and sage. Could be a decent pilsnar with strong hop presence, like victory prima pils. Not for me, i wouldnt recommend this strange brew."
"Drinkability, I could have this again for a Saison, might be just my thing."
"Overall I'm dissapointed I didn't pick up more of this! An underrated beer based on the averages I've seen. The nose is one of the best I've experienced."
"D - I could drink a few, its just a bit sweet and its a lighter ale so its not too filling."
"Poured into a wine glass. Straw yellow, cloudy with fluffy, white head that ticks around pretty well. Impressive looking saison. Thin malt aromas, light grains with an underlying herbal, vegetal smell. Lemony and refreshing; very enticing, albeit somewhat muted. Crisp, light flavors of grainy, savory malt with lightly sweet, lemony citrus notes. Herbal and planty, with a rich earthiness. A nice mix between sweet and savory aspects that makes it very refreshing. Light and airy mouthfeel, very bubbly and silky."
"An all around great beer that will find its way into my fridge often"
"D- I could go all night"
"D - Very drinkable, this should be available in 6-packs all year long. One of the most unique and amazing beers I've ever had, major props to all three brewers!"
"Smell has various spices, the rosemary and thyme do make themselves noticed, very herbal. The taste includes more those italian spices, along with some basic pepper, along with lemon and both sweetness and a bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with quite a bit of carbonation. This is a fairly easy to drink farmhouse ale from DFH in this collaboration with Victory and Stone. Personally, I very much enjoyed it."
"d: A beer brewed with parsley sage rosemary and thyme is a gimmick. These spices weren't selected for beer purposes but for novelty's sake. I can discern the thyme and possibly the rosemary, but I have a hard time believing that parsley can have any impact at all. Regardless, I did like the Stone version so this was a very disappointing surprise. I can't believe how different this was."
"Drinkability: Enjoyable for what it is. I prefer the Stone version over this, which isn't saying this is bad."
"The beer itself looked almost like a lager in color. The thing that stuck out instantly was the smell of grapefruit with a hint of pine needles or something? It tasted great and unlike any other beer I've ever had. I think it makes for a great summer beer and recommend to anyone who has a chance to try it."
"Drink The 3rd of the vertical. All tasty beers but I think the DFH is 1, Stone 2 and Victory 3."
"D - All in all, I'm not impressed with this enough to ever try it again. This collaboration was a bit of a disappointment for me, as Stone's was the only one I'd try again. Still, points for trying."
"We are going to pair ours with some roasted chicken and root vegetables. I think it will work out nicely."
"Pours a very light cloudy gold with lots of head that lingers. The smell is worth the price of admission, this is herbs 100%, dominated by the rosemary. It's pretty drinkable but the herbs are overpowering which downgrades the beers score. Loads of carbonation help me on the drinkability factor, reminds me of a sparkling wine."
"Overall, in my opinion, the Dogfish Head is a more drinkable, overall more balanced beer, and I enjoy it better. Conversely, I feel Victory's offering is a bit more extreme, really focusing on the spices and herbs, which certainly makes it more unique, but hurts it in flavor and drinkability. I'd like to try Stone's as well, but haven't been able to find it near me... Hopefully I can land it and finish the collaboration!"
"Overall: This was my first beer with the thanksgiving feast and I was not disappointed. It was very tasty and appropriate - a great twist on the classic Saison."
"D: This is a very unique beer. A bit more balance in the herbs would be nice, but that's a small quibble. Overall, a solid offering."
"2.5 D: Not terrible, but not too good either. I'm not sure where they went wrong, but the herbs don't work as well in this one as it some others. I wouldn't mind having this on occasion, but not for $3/bottle."
"Very drinkable, colder the better for me. I could sip these all saison. The 6.8& is nice yet soft, not boozy at all. Nice job to all three breweries."
"Slainte!"
"A lot of gas is in this beer, which makes it hard to drink. Also, the flavor isn't as smooth as the Victory Saison. I don't think I would get a second bottle of this version of the beer."
"D: Goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, nice twist on the style. This is an oddly tasty beer. I certianly couldn't sit with this for an evening, but this is a good after dinner beer."
"A great interpretation of the farmhouse style."
"Not bad, Now of course I have to try the other 2 from Stone and Victory."
"D: Despite all of the herbal flavors, the beer is actually quite drinkable. I would definitely try this again because it is very unique."
"Drinkability: Average. I keep sipping to try to catch the more ephemeral herb notes, but the bitterness keeps me from downing it."
"Herbal component seems overdone and the chalkiness is more prominent than I would prefer, but this one is really very approachable, overall. I could drink a couple of these."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonation is on the higher side. Drinkability is OK, the herbs were definitely interesting and made for a very unique beer but I'm not sure it's a flavor I'd want often in a beer. Cool beer that was definitely worth trying though."
"The mouth is highly carbonated, and the finish is bubbly and harsh. Not the smoothest beer out there. Spritzy is usually par for this style, but this kicks it up a notch. The herbs are mellowed out some in the flavor. Earthy flavors meld with subtle herbs. Slightly savory. There's more of a hop-presence in this one, over the Stone version. This is unique and a must-try, and though I prefer this one to Stone's, it's still not something I would reach for very often. It's interesting though."
"Pretty good, not sure how it compares to the Stone or Victory versions though."
"D: Quite an experience. Recommended to everyone at least once."
"This is not an everyday sipper, but kudos to Dogfish for...again... stretching the limits of what beer can be!!"
"Very close to Stone's version. Aroma and flavor not quite as strong though."
"Pours a hazy yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, spicy, but rosemary stand out a bit more. In the taste, a spice bite, and rosemary and thyme, a mellow malt to balance it. A spicy bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry burny spice in the aftertaste. I like it, but kind of feel a bit too Italian like spices."
"D- great saison collaborated. Very tasty despite high alcohol. I wish I had a case of this stuff! A great sour saison"
"My second Saison Du - all pretty good."
"D: Not as good as the Stone version but a nice beer. The spices are a little much at times."
"Like almost everything that DFH puts out, this beer is full-flavored, complex, and well balanced. Too bad this is a limited release, because I would definitely buy this again. I look forward to seeing how it compares to the Victory version of this beer, which I have on deck to try next."
"Drinkibility - A very creative use of unusual spices. I feel that they compliment the standard saison characteristics hidden within. A very refreshing brew and a different one at that."
"Saison Du BUFF is an impressive Saison. I recall the Stone release being very similar to this from DFH. I do think this one has a better look and performs a little better in the drinkability department. Maybe I just drank this on the right night. Nonetheless, I am a firm believer that Saison Du BUFF is one fine Saison. I don't really care if it's brewed at Stone, DFH, or Victory. I'm now quite certain they're all impressive. Find a bottle of each (or perhaps a few of each)."
"crisp, lively mouthfeel. the strong herbal characters and bitterness wear on me after a while... not the type of brew i find incredibly drinkable."
"For the record I'm 5+ minutes into my pour and there is not end to this head in sight. Taste is lightly zested- possibly a little soapy- maybe some yeast gone wrong in this batch.- Finish plays the same tune- yeasty and some great grain spices. Drinks a little below what I'd expect out of this style."
"The bottle says it is brewed with parsley, rosemary, sage, and thyme. It's definitely different. It has sahti like elements and in my opinion tends to lean that way more than it does a true saison. It pours a pale, pale straw yellow with a two finger, quickly dissipating white head. The smell is a complex mix of spices. The aforementioned spices combine to give it a piny, almost spruce like sappy aroma. The taste too is piney and again reminds me of a sahti. It drinks light and is light bodied with good carbonation. It's decently drinkable but nothing too special. One is definitely fine. I wouldn't want more than one or two of these in a sitting because I feel it's a desired taste."
"Easy drinking and better than expected. Well done."
"Drinkable - oh so drinkability 4"
"D - This is a pretty easy going beer. Goes down pretty quickly. I haven't tried the Stone or Victory versions yet, but I am looking forward to trying them."
"D - Really tasty. Like this one MUCH more than the Stone version. Would definitely have again."
"drinkability: good"
"Saison du Buff is aight. On the whole it's pretty decent. I really like the cohesion of the aroma; however, that doesn't hold true for the taste. Factor in the carbonation & I'm a little more iffy on it. Regardless, it was a worthwhile shot."
"D- Pretty interesting ingredients listed on the bottle for sure. Just think they go better on food rather than beer. Found this one on the harder side to drink. Just didn't have the beer taste that I really enjoy."
"single from some Whole Foods"
"D: 4"
"D: A little off for the style, but still very good. Easy to drink and I would definitely love to have this with Italian food because of all the herbs in the flavor. However, I don't see myself drinking a lot of these or going out and getting more anytime soon."
"A very unique beer and I would guess that its a love-it-or-hate-it kind of affair with the herb choices. I'm leaning towards the love-it side. Light, refreshing, sessionable and sets itself apart from other beers, even of saisons, and in a good way in my opinion. I'd like to have a few of these on hand in the future."
"Drinkability is high. I think I could drink this all night and not get palate fatigue from the herbs. Done very nicely. Worth replicating at home, since I have a nice supply of fresh rosemary in the garden. Same impression as the Stone and Victory versions."
"12oz. bottle served in my DFH goblet. Pours a semi-hazy orange-gold (much lighter than the Stone variation) with a rocky, two inch, bright white head and with thick strands of lacing exposed during the tasting. Nose was herbal - minty with a suggestion of rosemary and sage. The herbal quality melds a bit more than the Stone variation and seems a bit more earthy, with a slightly acrid finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium in consistency with a carbonation that falls just short of prickly, culminating in a semi-dry finish. Perhaps a little more balanced than the Stone version; however, still somewhat difficult to drink by one's self."
"Drinkability is above average due to the light body and citrus notes, and while the herbal notes made me keep taking sip after sip trying to figure out what the brewers were going for, I can't say this is a beer I would purchase again."
"And the trifecta is finally complete. Like the other iterations, this one pours a slightly hazed golden straw topped by a strong finger of white froth. The nose comprises sage, greens, coriander, parsley (beyond the darker miscellaneous greens already mentioned...), onions, cardamom, and orange peel. The taste is similarly herby and spicy, though to a much greater and bitterer extent. Some gourd flesh finds its way in there, too, along with a hint of walnuts near the finish line. The body is a heavy light, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, like the others in the set, I am just not a fan of the multi-herb and spice combo. At least not in this particular delivery method, anyway."
"I liked this better than the Victory variety, and the flavor profile is possibly better than ever."
"D: Solid drinkability, definite six pack worthy but ended up liking the stone brewed one better. Nice enjoyment factor."
"D: As with most Dogfish Head brews, this beer is quite drinkable. Very enjoyable, I would definitely have another."
"Nice carbonation, pleasant beer."
"CHEERS!!"
"D- A very interesting Saison, to be sure. I don't know if I'll run right out and buy out any inventories any time soon. I am curious to see how the other brewer's offerings compare."
"Drinkability for this one really lies in the tastes of the drinker. It's the most herbal of the group, and that can build on the palate. However, within one serving it also offers a great deal of complexity."
"12 ounce bottle, has ""bottled in 2010 D"" (?) etched onto the neck of the bottle. Pours light golden amber, lightly hazed. Loose off white head, stays and falls to a nice looking thick film (again loose) and leaves ample fine bits of lace. Herbal, spicy nose leads directly to a herbal, earthy, peppery, lime infused style of saison, thats not all that to my liking. Something just seems off here, so many other saisons out there that I prefer to this one."
"D: Highly drinkable saison with a distinctively American bent thanks to the hoppiness. An interesting collaboration, the DFH version definitely emphasizes the Stone and DFH aspects more--high hop levels (Stone) that emphasize flavor over astringency and bitterness (DFH). A solid beer."
"Mouthfeel is very light and crisp. I definitely see this beer more as a cooking beer for recipes like chicken or pasta and subsequently paired with. Good innovation by the collaborative brewers; just something that didn't 'wow' me."
"Transparent golden in body topped by excessively large white head. Smells of deep citrus, lemon, pineapple, floral notes, some funk. Tastes of pineapple, lemon zest, sourness, green apples, and pineapple finishes out the drink. Light in body with some lively carbonation that goes well with the flavors. A refreshing saison that gives us a reason to applaud American craft breweries."
"Drinkability is good. It's certainly a very different and unique approach to the style, but it's quite a solid and tasty brew. The spices make for a one-of-a-kind experience. Now if only I could just find the Stone and Victory versions around here to compare!"
"Notes: Intensely herbal this paired beautifully with an oven baked lemon salmon. Victory's version is quite nice too, and the flavor profile is very akin, but DFH has a presence and a touch of intensity above. This and Victory's review are fairly similar albeit noting that appreciation."
"drinkability: This was my least favorite of the du series."
"Poured this into a pint glass. The beer is a slightly hazy straw color with a frothy looking white head that stands about an inch high and vanishes slowly into soapy lacing. The aroma is of citrus and bitter hops. As with the Stone and Victory versions of this beer, the herbs used in the making of this really shine nicely and compliment the aroma with a nice earthy aroma. The herbs blend together well, but the rosemary is what I can smell the most. The flavor on this one seems to be dominated by the herbs. I can really taste everything and it's finished with a bit of hop bittering. Not bad at all but this one seems heavier on the herb flavor. The mouthfeel is good, nothing really bad about it; good carbonation, nice medium body and good flavors make it unfortunate that this is a one shot."
"D - Very enjoyable saison. Having this side by side with the Victory version. This one stands out above the Victory in its aroma and flavor intensity and spice presence. Quite enjoyable."
"A: Color is a light to medium straw, there is a layer of thin white head as well as a few spots along the side of the glass - 3.50, S: What a totally wild nose, I pick up lemon zest and rosemary, I also see that thyme is part of the recipe and I am able to discern some, though the nose is quite prominent it has a light crispness to it, interesting aromas all around - 4.00, T: What I can only describe as a hard earthiness is present on the tail of the beer, thyme and rosemary are evident as well as some grassy flavors, there is a good deal of lemon zest and pepper, very dry and almost puckering - 3.75, M: Light to medium mouth feel, a small sip coats the mouth - 3.50, D: Saison's aren't generally my style but Saison du Buff is quite enjoyable, I have Victory's version sitting in the cellar which I'll look forward to trying - 4.00"
"D - the lame mouthfeel actually makes it pretty drinkable, in the sense of ""chuggable."" and there is some interesting stuff going on in the smell + taste. but overall, not something I'd revisit."
"Eh, not bad actually. Much more subdued herb factor, nice and subtle, but definitely present. There's a bit too much lemon going on here as well, not entirely sure where that's coming from. Odd grainyness, sort of like an average lager. Hmm, messy mouthfeel. All in all this is a cool beer but really not coming together well. The herbal trio is an interesting idea but the sage and rosemary are just too strong. Maybe different herbs, different result. But, this ends up a jumble. Still, admirable."
"A very interesting beer, not sure i could drink a lot of this, the flavors are pretty bold. Good to try once."
"Drinkabilit is good, surprisingly refreshing for being so dry."
"This ... is a phenomenally arrogant beer. Typically when I say that, it's a complement. In this case, it's not. These 4 herbs (with the exception of parsley) are each strong as hell in their own right, and typically are not mixed ... at least not more than 2 at a time. They tried to do the impossible, and found it impossible. Not nearly what I'd expect from a collaboration between these 3 brewers."
"Part 3 of my review and wow look at the head difference between this and its victory counterpart is my first thought, next is this beer is noticeably cloudier too. The smell is much spicier and not as noticeably hoppy. Taste is intense it does not have as light a mouthfeel as the other 2 and its complexity is almost overwhelming with a bitter finish. The tastes that I can pick up on are a bit of citrus, some sage. At this point I'd say it is good drinkability but of the 3 I'd have to give stone the winner for best with dog fish being a close second."
"12oz bottle $4 which was odd because the Victory version was only $3 but the difference was apparent after drinking them both. This was orange and had an initially hoppy smell, almost a citrus quality and then herbs. The flavor was clean, saison with the sage seeming to dominate more than the rosemary and thyme which I thought were heavy in the Stone version. Very easy to drink and probably the best of the three Du Buffs."
"D: Ehhh, it's interesting enough, but probably a one-off for me. I love Simon and Garfunkel, so I'm happy to actually have a palette in mind for this song. Beyond the herbs, though, just an okay beer."
"D: Not normally a huge fan of Belgian beer (although I'm starting to get there) but this beer is pretty good. I bought all 3 bottles of the collab so I'm interested to see if there is any differences between them being brewed at different breweries."
"Overall- this is well made saison, refreshing but still has a ton of flavor, even more herbacious than most. This is literally making me crave some seared salmon, paired with a fresh salad! I wish they made more of this!"
"Beer is a light gauzy golden color with a thick white head. Smell is a complex blast of yeast with some citrus and grass. Taste starts with some grassyness and is crisp and a touch bitter. The finish has some nice herby notes. The mouthfeel is good; the beer is nicely carbonated and not at all heavy. It's quite drinkable. All in all, a very good and subtly interesting beer. The flavor doesn't punch you in the face, but that's ok. It's a good refreshing farmhouse ale with some very nice herby and grassy undertones."
"Definitely refreshing and has that farmhouse palate, fairly balanced flavors, but strangely boring. I can't quite put my finger on it. A quality brew that just doesn't get there."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a tulip glass a crisp yellow with a thin diminishing head. Aroma is crisp sweet malts and a nice bit of Belgian spice. The taste is a nice smooth blend of sweet malts, smooth citrus hops and a nice blend of spices such as rosemary and thyme. The beer is quite light and smooth with its 6.8% very well hidden. This is a very enjoyable beer, a very good saison, even on draft."
"Final Verdict: While Victory looked and smelled better, I enjoyed the taste of DFH and while I would I would never turn either down, I would take DFH by a slim margin."
"The spicing gets a touch heavy, it feels like I can taste straight up dried parsley here and there. However, there's a big herbal and lightly citrus punch of hops to open that reminds me of an imperial pils, or hopped saison, that's very cool. The malt is mild, dry and biscuity with the spices blending into the clove and subtle fruit notes. Overall a very different, but delicious beer. Check this out."
"Really beautiful beer, pours a hazy golden color with a huge frothy white head that retains impressively AND leaves nice lacing. The aroma is spicy with notes of lemon pepper, basil, thyme, rosemary, orange marmalade, cane sugar, fruity esters, bread dough and a bit of alcohol. The taste has notes of bread dough and hay upfront, along with lemon pepper and basil, thyme and rosemary, along with candy sugar, fruity esters and alcohol. The mouthfeel is light and sprightly, and drinkability is good. The spices seem less oppressive in this iteration than in the Stone version which makes this much more enjoyable."
"D - Not exactly a beer that I could have several of. The herbs just don't mix as well as I would hope with the beer. It's a great idea, just one, that I think I'll limit to one bottle though."
"Carb is just a touch sharp, but the medium body is great. It finishes with some refreshing sensations, a touch of lingering spices, and mild bitterness. Overall, I like this beer a lot, even more that the Stone version. A really good take on the recipe and ingredients, the spices seem to fit more and the hops make this really sing. One that I'll be happy to try again and again."
"Drinkability: This is just a very clean saison and one of the better American versions I have had. The flavors of lemon and pepper just jump. Another beer I could drink all day. The alcohol is super well hidden."
"A great beer. Love the collaboration between these guys as well. If only this was offered once a year in the summer...Such a good refresher!"
"Drinkability is good here, of course if it were more available."
"D - Don't know if I would drink alot did mind it would have again. Just not my favorite style."
"D - Took me a while to drink just one. It's a good beer but I don't think I could have more than 1 or 2 in a night. It's just not that kind of beer."
"Tasty brew and something i'd most likely drink again."
"Pours a hazy light golden color and creates a half finger head with adequate lacing. The herbal smell is overwhelming and smells more like thyme and sage, a very grassy smell. Nothing like anything I've had before. The initial taste is better than the smell until you swallow and then you go right back to that grassy sage and thyme overkill. However, it goes down smoothly and the carbonation is just right. Dogfish says they are off-centered and this beer certainly sticks to that theme. But, I'm going to stick with their more traditional offerings."
"I liked this one a lot more than I thought I would. Yeah, it's herbal, but the Saison aspect isn't entirely buried and lost. A unique twist that totally works."
"This was an interesting beer. I applaud the attempt, but it just isn't a hit as far as I'm concerned. I love these 3 breweries and I'm very excited to see a collaboration, hopefully there will be more to come."
"D- The large amount of spice and herbal presence in this beer make a little hard to get through, especially when you are looking for a top notch saison."
"M/D - Light body especially considering the ABV. Drinkability is ok for 1 glass but I couldn't see myself drinking more than that in a sitting. I enjoy it but it's more of a novelty for me. I really enjoy the Saison style and this just does not do it justice."
" D- This version has more aroma depth that the Stone version but to much fizz makes this taste more like a soda pop and it looses a lot of the flavor and character of a saison. The aroma is great but after a bit it starts to take on an aftershave quality."
"D: I split a bottle over dinner, and I have doubts that this would be a good session beer, but for what it is, it's great."
"M/D- medium-light bodied with medium carbonation. good mouthfeel on this beer. it kind of reminds me of a gruet style beer with the intense herbal qualities. interesting beer but not my first choice for a saison."
"The aroma is fantastic. Unique and one of a kind, the bouquet on this brew is phenomenal. The phenolic character is a little too much for my taste and I've had a lot of saisons that were a lot cleaner (saison dupont, Hennepin and something from Two Brothers off the top of my head). To band-aidy for me. Still, give this one a try just to support craft beer experimentation."
"D - Hell yes. A very interesting brew. Amazing use of some unconventional ingredients producing a very interesting tasty brew."
"Flavor is very decent. I'd say overall I like this one better than the Stone version(haven't had the Victory one as of yet). A nice saison reseblance mixed with the spices. Medium body for a saison though, which is unique...malty too. Some crisp citrus fruits, and high carbonation. A very nice drinker...and a great summer beer! Booze isn't a factor. Another nice beer from Dogfish Head."
"Poured a gold body with good head on top of an aroma comprised of citric sharpness along with soft fruit sweetness and some spices. Taste is more of the same as a light-to-medium body with some chewiness and smoothness passes the tongue. There is a balance of sweetness like caramel that balances with pear rind, apple, hint of grape and without the sour fruit edge it still has a crisp backbite thanks to carbonation and some spicy zip. Well-balanced and good flavoring, and while not a unique saison it is still an enjoyable beer."
"A very interesting beer that doesn't have the sourness associated with the style. This might be its own style--I like the spices which are remind me of hops but are more biting without the bitterness."
"Mouthfeel is light with fast moving carbonation. Overall, it seems the herbs are a bit more pronounced here. It's an interesting twist on a saison, but again not something I would be able to drink much of in a sitting."
"Drinkability: I found this a reasonably drinkable beer and one I'd be happy to try again. That said it's not something I'd make a special effort to find. It is a pleasant, tasty saison."
"Overall I was completely impressed with this beer. I would drink this constantly if this was a regular release. I really enjoyed this beer."
"I was a bit apprehensive trying this but the brewers clearly know what they're doing. A very unique and good beer. I hope to grab a couple more to enjoy. "
"This beer had nice golden yellow appearance with moderate white head off the pour. But by far the most impressive part of this beer was the nose. It was just so powerful and bright of the spice and herbs and of just an overall very nice smelling saison. Just a very unique and powerful nose. The taste was pretty good didnt quite live up the nose but still a nice tasting saison. Mouthfeel was decently carbonated but crisp. A nice saison but with all the unique spices and flavors going on not sure I would session this saison as a session but still definitely worth check out because are many of dogfish beers this is truly very unique and several of the people I tried it with liked it alot more then me."
"Overall: I am exceptionally pleased with this beer, and can't wait to try it in bottle. Perhaps that will be on the menu this evening. If you see this beer, get it. It's limited, and is worth trying. And if you live within radius to Moe's, call to see if it's still on tap!"
"D: Pretty good, but I think I like Stone's version a bit better. This version doesn't quite hit the spices the same way, however I think it is much closer to a Saison in flavor and style."
"Overall, this is much more drinkable than the stone version, but I was less impressed with this version. I'd reccomend it if you thought the Stone version was too herbal."
"Pours (into a flute) a clear bright gold with champagne-like carbonation rocketing to up through the ale. Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme indeed! The aromas are herbal and leafily bitter, but not overbearing in the least. The taste is consistent with the aromas, and are very well blended and delicate in their presentation. An exceptionally fine beer whose unusual flavors don't beat you over the head."
"Overall, this is a very interesting beer. The guys at Stone, Dogfish, and Victory certainly got very creative with their brewing, but I wouldn't say they struck gold with this one. It's good, but nothing I would want to drink on a regular basis."
"has a decent saison start promising to be a refreshing and tasty beer, but the flavors pull way too far away from that to make drinking this a struggle. probably my last attempt to enjoy this beer. Its just not for me."
"D- very nice beer, the herb flavors aren't as pronounced as i would have liked but it is still very solid, i think i like this one better than the stone version"
"Poured a golden slightly hazy color with an average head. The smell was very herbal, almost at first like Basil, but no Basil here. It is rosemary and sage? The taste is very herbal as well, getting sort of a shock of rosemary on the first sip, but once the tongue gets used to it, the flavors meld together really well. Very, very tasty and so different. Great imagination ehre. Mouthfeel was good, and drinkabliity I tought is very good. So tasty and great smelling!"
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a somewhat hazy light gold color with a couple inch frothy white head. Head retention is very good, and there's a lot of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is citrusy hops (orange peel, tropical fruit), herbs, and some yeast. The taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like citrusy hops (orange and lemon peel), herbs, and a bit of grassy hops and tropical fruit. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, and is well carbonated. Drinkability is pretty good, it's smooth and quite enjoyable to drink. I think it's a good overall brew, I might have to drink a bottle of the Stone version next to see how it compares to this one (although the Stone version isn't as fresh as the DFH one)."
"a citrusy saison with a synthetic nose quality of citronella. i say synthetic because its backed with a body of something thin of pure lemon and heavy herbal. a heavy punch herbal that leaves the hops in a lemon oil resin. definitely getting the parsley, rosemary, sage, and thyme. it doesn't have a blend of anything of appetite inducing. the hop malt seems to flop a bit and it seems to be more so a hop herb beer. the fresher the better as i would fear it going sweet."
"Drinkability: Very good, and possibly my favorite of the Saison Du BUFF series. This one has the most flavor among them. Definitely a brew to seek out."
"Beer is quite bitter, its got some strong rosemary and thyme flavors in the forward palate but not much else. Its mildly sweet and finishes slightly dry. I do like this better than the Stone version, now I guess I need to go get the Victory version. A very good beer, I still am unsure if this is a saison though."
"Drinkability: An excellent saison even if it isn't exactly to style. I'll be really interested to see if the Victory and Stone versions match up (I guess they should, theoretically, since it's the same recipe)."
"Poured into tulip glass."
"This is a very interesting and worthy Saison that is definitely not to-style."
"The beer pours an idyllic pale golden color with a white head and beautiful carbonation. Upon bringing this beer close to your nose you are presented with a potent aroma that is more associated with a roast turkey than a beer. Intrigued, I took a sip, the traditional Belgian sour is there in a crisp clean way but masked behind the array of herbs. The rosemary, and thyme I find are most prevalent and serve to brilliantly complement the the slight malt character. The end result is a Saison that is not only unique, bit highly enjoyable. While Stone snuck by, Dogfish was discovered in a happy coincidence, Victory will be hunted down."
"Overall it is an interesting brew, but it gets tiring after a little while, at least it was only a one off."
"Drinkability: The stone beer is a bit smoother, and has more complexity. The spices are more in the background and after taste. In the DFH version the spices are too up front and dominate the charateristics of the beer. Its tough to remember that this is a saison."
"(D)- Still an interesting take on the style. Fresh, with that spice cabinet kick."
"The body has a solid presence. You can feel the carbonation dancing on your tongue. Overall, very drinkable with some interesting flavors hiding throughout."
"D: much like stones, except price per bottle is much cheaper and would be cheaper to have a few."
"Overall a very enjoyable experience. Definitely worth checking out if you are new to Saisons (this is a good but different take) or if you are bored with the Saisons you've been drinking."
"Pale golden color with mild white head that recedes to a lasting film on the surface of the beer. Aroma comes out only with warming, a bit of paler malt and then strong herbal notes, I'm getting more of the rosemary and thyme than anything. Tastes similar in that there are strong herbal notes on top of an otherwise unremarkable saison. Bitterness is high, but not necessarily due to hopping, which appears to be largely grassy and herbal as well. MF is slick, but could be creamier, as it stands the beer lies flat on the palate. Drinkability is ok, but the flavors in this one make it a tough drink. Definitely interesting, just not exactly the most enjoyable beer I've ever had."
"D/M: Light, crisp, and refreshing that tickles the tongue. Great beer for the season. I like the creativity."
"Flavor is complex and runs over the palate satisfying all parts. After the assault of carbonation, there's a citrusy pale ale component, followed by another bright/acidic flavor which is definitely herbal but still doesn't taste specifically of parsley, sage, rosemary, or thyme. The backbone of the beer does have a nice barley malt flavor to it, but the aftertaste is dry and not at all annoying. If I had to guess, I'd say the thyme flavor comes across as the hot variety, rather than the ""roast chicken"" variety, and the rosemary is really tempered, not at all overpowering as it typically can be. The rosemary beer flavor does actually remind me of CBC's Weekapaug Gruit from a few years back."
"This one ranks high on the drinkability meter, although more than a few might cause some palate fatigue."
"Overall- this is a very interesting beer one that I am pleased to try. I will most likely have this again only to sample the differences of each breweries batch."
"Not quite drinkable enough for a saison, a bit too many odd flavors."
"D - I like herbs as much as anyone, I grow basil and oregano but the drinkability is not extremely high since the herbs dominate and come off as a bit domineering in this ale. I could see one here or there, but not in regular rotation IMO"
"I had an idea mid-way through however. Went to the fridge, grabbed some leftover Chinese noodle and had some dinner with this beer. Made it much more enjoyable to consume with food. A surprising enjoyable brew once married with other food/spice flavors. Not a saison if you ask me but I guess it has to go in some category."
"Drinkability: I just could not get over the smell. We have seven bottles left, so I am hoping to trade."
"however, this is really a great beer that I will certainly try again."
"D/M: Nice carbonation, early on a lot of small bubbles were being released from the bottom. Has a light mouthfeel, and the 6.8% is hidden very well. I had no problem putting this one down, but I don't know how many I would want to drink in one night. Overall, quite enjoyable."
"Drinkability is average - the herbs are nice in small doses and one to two bottles of this would be very welcome. These flavors would get old given a few of these beers. Definitely a worthwhile experience, but I would prefer a Hennepin when I am in the mood for a Saison."
"This is definitely a light and refreshing beer. The herbs take center stage again, and the sage definitely becomes more apparent in the taste than in the smell. Rosemary still dominates. The citrusy hops come across brightly bitter, and a light yeastiness adds body. The overall feel is light, effervescent and bright. A perfect summer beer, and really enjoyable with Latin fare. Could drink this all summer."
"Haven't tried the other two of these yet so I can't compare :/"
"Pours a beautiful just hazy yellow orange color. Big head that leaves nice lacing. The aroma is off the wall. More bitterness and parsley and thyme than the stone one. Really has a strong fresh herbal note to it. Really inviting and def has a bit more hop bitterness than the atone version. The taste is not my cup of tea especially in this style which is my favorite. The flavors are stingy, almost rubbing alcohol like with extreme sourness to it that leaves you wincing. Herbs come through but not pleasantly or buttery like the stone version. Mouthfeel is ok. Has an astringent dryness that is off balanced and leaves an extreme tangy aftertaste. Drinkability is limited for me. Really not impressed but a good effort with all these ingredients."
"Bring it on, Victory!!!"
"Drinkability is hurt for me by the spice give me more wet horse less spice but just my opinion."
"Overall, this was a wonderful example of the style. I still feel the one produced by Victory was much smoother and enjoyable - it had a refreshing quality that was sorely lacking in the DFH version."
"Overall, very happy with this brew after all that I heard about it. Purchased the Stone bottling this afternoon as well, so we'll see how it compares/or is different."
"D - Enjoyed drinking this one and I would definitely get it again when in the mood for a saison. Big and bold enough that it paired well with grilled sockeye salmon and brussel sprouts."
"Pours with a bllowing bright white cloudy textured head rises well above the rim of my chalice. Slightly hazed bright straw golden color, lacing left behind is fine and intricate. Nose is blasting with rosemary and thyme it smells like somebody just roasted some chicken. Sharp spicy acidity with hints of citric undertones and sweet grassy layers as well. Flavor this one is tasting nice a saison/gruit combo with aromatic/spiy herbal additions. Much more appealing than the Stone version I had, it was so spicy I had a hard time detecting the saison characteristics. This one actually accomplishes the balance that would go nice with a meal using these same aromatic herbs. Citrus combo of herbs/lemongrass/thyme bitterness very green and fresh tasting lively carbonation on the palate helps the flavos not fall flat. Eye opening appeal that brings out the point that what else could be used to spice a beer up instead of straight up hop additions, I like the creativity no boundary approach that went into play when formulating this saison style. Light effervescent carbonation that works nicely with the style body is moderate very killer mouthfeel. Drinkability was easy, no problems consuming this fantastic gruit/saison, can't wait to try Victory's version."
"Tasty beer, well timed for the end of summer. Definitely more enjoyable than the Stone version. Victory's we shall see soon."
"M/D: A lighter beer, but full of flavor. It had a aftertaste that lasted a while, but not too bad."
"Wife's take: ""There's a lot of flavor in there. I'd put a chicken in that."""
"But those spices subsided as Dogfish Head swam into this beer. The balance of the hops, spices, and aroma, made this beer easy to drink. A surprising true session beer (even with the spices)."
"MD- I am sure I am going to be on low side of ratings for this one. It does get better as is warms, but I am just not feeling it."
"D: Another solid offering from DFH. Not even close to my favorite saison, but not bad at all."
"An enjoyable beer surely not to be missed."
