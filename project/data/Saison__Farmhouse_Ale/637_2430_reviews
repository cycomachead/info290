"I really enjoyed this beer the second time around."
"Foret pours hazy gold with a light orange tint under a 3” thick mousey head that looks like freshly fallen snow and very slowly collapses leaving art nouveau designs on the glass.  It has a big saison nose with light fruit, spice, earthiness, bread and a light funk. Bready malt leads the palate seasoned with light fruit, malty sweetness, citrus, and a slight funk that becomes tart on the finish. The beer has an effervescent medium body – the texture makes the beer with slightly different flavors emphasized in the body than in the rich moussey foam."

"I was expecting more from this brew.  Its a fine example of the beer but nothing uber special."

"Overall: this is a balanced and very drinkable saison. Delicious."

"Overall: This is the best Saison I've ever had.  The honey like sweetness meshes perfectly with the grassy, earthy notes.  Crisp without being over the top, simply a masterfully crafted brew."
""
"Evokes springtime with flowering plants and pollen circulating. The primary aroma here is honey and spicy phenolics, which remind me of clove, ginger, pepper, candied lemon drop, and banana. Delightfully airy texture, a fine mousse like the finest champagne but better because it persists. Great acidity. Tropical fruit like pineapple, along with citrus, with a touch of caramel sweetness. There is some skunkiness that I didn't get when I tried this on tap, but I think it adds some funky character that doesn't detract from the balance. This is the definitive saison, complex yet refreshing, and might surpass regular Dupont."

"O: Oh yeah, this is the shit. The skunky nose isn't so offputting as to ruin this, and every other aspect is at least excellent. It's so drinkable, yet so rich and so flavorful. I need more of this in my life."

"awesome stuff, an organic version of the famous dupont saison. hazy goldenrod colored beer with a brassy glimmer and an inch and a half of frothing white head. i smell the sugar in this immediately, candy sugar in its rawest form, not all the way fermented out, but not too sweet either, a lot like a tripel on the nose, but the yeast is far more interesting. classic belgian saison strain gives the farmhouse profile without ever getting into the funky or weird zone. i highly appreciate the malt depth on this, its sturdy wheat, with some body, and again with a touch of residual sugar. a well refined yet very rustic ale, id love to culture some of this yeast for a brew of my own. great effervescence in the feel even though though the body is heavier than a lot of american examples of the style. yeast and sugar dual in the finish, this may change over time as we know these two ingredients are not stable together. great beer, especially for the price, props for being organic. even though its supposed to be the same, this is appreciably different (and superior) from the regular saison dupont."

"This is a great Saison!"

"Overall: This is a good saison. I am a huge saison fan and this one is very well balanced and has nice aroma and flavors. The one thing that I do have to take down points for is that this is WAY to carbonated for my taste. I like to be able to move the beer around in my mouth so that I can taste it everywhere, can't do it with this beer. The carbonation is too high. It's to style still so I'm not knocking it down that much, but that's the only real flaw that I see."
""
""
"Overall, a great organic offering that represents the best of the style"
""

"A great beer from one of the world's best breweries. Nice Appearance. Perfect amount of carbonation and lacing. Lots of funk in the nose. True to the style from beginning to end. I can't think of a better organic beer. I will be revisiting this one real soon! (So many beers, so little time!)"

"O: DuPont masters the saison and this further proves it. That dry spicy peppery flavor that defines a saison is all here. Their original is better but this is a nice change up."
""
"Overall: If only this beer wasn't packaged in a green bottle, it would be so much better; still a very good beer but it really is hindered by the skunk"

"Pleasant enough but very subtle. hoping for more of that fresh saison character. This was just ok."
""
"Pours a murky light orange with a foamy bone head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, and spice aromas. Taste is much the same with spice and fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of yeast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."

"O- A solid farmhouse-style ale: well-crafted and balanced. A bit too spicy and dry for my personal taste, but I enjoyed it nontheless."
""
""
"T- Interesting. Very complex. Layer and after layer in this beer. I was told this is considered “the best beer in the world.” Now I’ve been tasting beer for years, but maybe I’m still not ready for it. It has the malt and bready yeast, plus the banana from the nose. But it also has the layers of coriander and vanilla, plus hints of cinnamon and clove on the finish. In fact, the finish lingers for quite a while, but it’s almost too spiced for me. I want to say bitter, but bitter isn’t the word. Being allergic to cinnamon, I personally did not enjoy this beer because it made my tongue tingle the same way the spice does. Perhaps one day…. I can see why people like it: it truly is well made, and the layers are fun to dig through. It’s a surprise, which in a world of boring beer is refreshing. But for me personally it’s a no go."
"Reminds me of the original a lot with an extremely flavorful, yet clean Saison yeast feel, the classic strain. Love the spicy and floral/grassy interplay."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This brew is a pretty mixed bag. It is OK to look at and the feel is pretty close to style, but the smell and taste are underwhelming. I keep getting skunky notes, and while the bottle I consumed might have been light-struck, I couldn't help but think that the flavor profile was intentional. Anyway, if you are a fan of ultra-grassy, ultra-sharp, slightly skunky saisons, this might be worth your time."

"O: A great Saison - a balanced, tasty, and intense flavor and aroma. I can see why people want to use this yeast for their Saisons. I much prefer the dryness I get here to the sweeter American versions."

"A very nice saison, though I don't like it as much as the flagship Dupont. It just seems a bit simpler. No big complaints, and it might just be a case of being so used to Saison Dupont that's it's hard to avoid comparison bias completely."
""
"Overall: A nice, very classy beer. I'm a sucker for anything that's ""farmhouse""! I prefer a little more funk and spice and less hop forwardness in a Belgian. This seems to be toward the ""champagne"" end of the Saison spectrum just as is their Saison Dupont. Foret is, however, a bit more robust than the Dupont, and for that reason, I'd get Foret again. "

"C&C bottle opened with a nice pop. The pour is lively with more than half a glass of head which disappears quickly and leaves heavy lacing. The nose is funky! Plenty of sulfuric/skunky notes along with heavy cereal grains and a light lemony hops. The taste fruity up front with lemon, sugar, and grain. This is followed by a mellow tartness that provides a bit of a bite. Behind the bite is more evidence of the sulfur notes which leaves an off putting flavor on the palate. Mouthfeel is high with carbonation and moderate in the body department. Overall, this Saison has funk, but the funk is not in the form that I can enjoy. This is one that I will avoid in the future."
""
"Soft medium body with brisk but fading carbonation. Sweet fruitness followed by soft honey and herbal flavors and a nice malty sweetness. There is a significant hop herbal hop snap that comes along on the back end of the tongue with a bit of alcohol and yeast bite that cuts the sweetness so briskly for a smooth and refreshing finish. A simple beer but with extraordinary flavors that go well together and flavors that come from both sweet malts, yeast, and hops. A lot of stuff working very well together. Super dry finish, very nice."

"Flavors of funky tropical melon rind, slight black pepper, amber malts, and field flower flavors, however you define them! When you get into the farm artisan styles of brew the relative quality of flavors and enjoyment varies...we each have our own expectations, desires and tolerance. This is a wonderful brew, and fresh from the brewery is lovely, but shipped here to Colorado it also is wonderful. Very different from the regular Saison Dupont and more complex...a challenging but lovely farmhouse type brew."

"It pours a very hazy orange. The off white head is very thick with excellent retention and it leaves gorgeous lacing down the sides of the glass. It smells yeasty and musty. green apple and delicate hints of some tropical fruit as well. The taste is lighter than expected, and a little on the sweet side. The yeast is detectable, but it is toned down. It's sweet up front with hints of candied fruits that eventually becomes slightly tart. Fresh, juicy apple with a slightly dissapointing yeast undertone appear mid-palate. The finish has an ever so slight herbal hoppy bitterness. It has a lighter mouthfeel and the carbanation is pleasantly gentle. If you haven't tried this already, pick up a bottle."
""
""
""
"Pours hazy golden with huge off white head that dissipates and leave some lacing down the glass. Lots of yeast smell in this one, maybe a little funk. Taste is light with decent hops flavor. Mouthfeel is light due the the abundant carbonation. Overall I've had better, but this isn't the worst."
"O: well, while this IS one of the better organic brews I've had, the green bottle (always on the top shelf, directly underneath the overhead bright lights) has to effect something while the quality of the malts come into question - otherwise, this compares favorably to the Saison Dupont - this is worth picking up, especially if you're the type who wants to support organic products"

"O - Pretty good! I think I'm getting more into saisons."
"O- Very good but not the best I've had from Dupont. I feel like the alcohol is too noticeable."
""
"Slightly cloudy, orange-yellow pour, with a fluffy white head that retained well and coated the glass with lacing. Flowers and lots of wet funk in the nose, pale malts, Belgian yeast. The taste wasn't nearly as funky as the aroma led me to believe it would be, floral, grassy, light toasted bread, sweet with honey and pale malts, notes of citrus and light spice. While the nose was a bit heavy on the funk, this beer was pretty smooth, light-medium in body, and quite drinkable overall. I haven't been impressed by many (if any) Dupont beers, but this one was not bad."
"Overall, quite nice. Another good beer from this brewery."
""
""
"Not too shabby, but I don't need my Saison Dupont to be Certified Organic. I still prefer the original to this take."
""
""
""
"O - Taste and aroma seem subdued. I expected a little better from Dupont"
""
"O: A great beer but I do prefer the standard saison by Dupont. This has a more interesting aroma from a distance but very similar to its more common brother, the standard saison. I would still recommend trying this or making it your go to replacement for the standard saison when not available."
""
""
""
"Expected this to be a wit not a Saison."
""
""
"Overall: this is, quite possibly, exactly what I am looking for in a saison. I would not hesitate to build a meal paired specifically for enjoying this saison to its fullest."

"Spot on saison. Just tremendously balanced in all facets."
"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, 2012 printed on the cork. Pours hazy golden orange color with a nice 3 finger fluffy white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to thick cap that lasts. Thick foamy lacing clings to the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big orange zest, lemon zest, pepper, coriander, earth, clove, pear, wheat, grass, hay, bread, and yeast spiciness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity and balance. Taste of big lemon, orange zest, pepper, clove, pear, wheat, bread, grass, hay, coriander, earth, herbal, floral, and big yeast spiciness. Light wheat tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, orange zest, wheat, pepper, clove, coriander, bread, earth, grass, and yeast spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic flavor complexity and balance; very crisp and fairly dry finish; no cloying flavors at all. Great malt flavor to spiciness balance as well. High carbonation and medium bodied; with a creamy, chalky, and fairly prickly and crisp mouthfeel that is excellent. Alcohol is very well hidden with almost zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely world class saision. Insane balance and complexity of flavors; extremely crisp and smooth to sip on. I am going to have to revisit the normal Saision Dupont soon to compare; this is apparently the organically brewed version of that. WOW."

"The beer pours a beautiful straw yellow with a little gold touching its edges. The head pours big, smooth and frothy, and it lasts, leaving short sticky walls of fat lacing on the sides. The beer smells big and funky, practically skunked, but very strongly of hay and barnyard funk. Lemon bread sits nicely below the funk, giving it an almost biscuity scent. The esters seem citrusy as well, but overall this smell is all about the barnyard funk. On the taste, the beer is wonderfully simple in its complexity… if that makes sense. The beer starts with a nice light fruit flavor that moves into the wonderful barnyard funk mixed with some light biscuit, before opening up into some lovely hay and citrus fruits with lemon, orange peel, and slight pineapple playing on the tongue with a nice light pepper. Mouthfeel is fiercely prickly and effervescent, but that works with this beer and helps to prepare the tongue for the thick lasting ooze on the tip while the back of the throat dries out and begs for more. Overall this is a fantastic example of a to-the-tee saison. It has all the hall marks of the style from the citrus, to the pepper, to the distinguished barnyard funk. This is worth a try for any saison lover out there, and for any beer lovers looking for a classic example of the saison."

"Served from tap into a Vieille Provisions Saison Dupont Willi glass. Poured a hazy yellow-orange with a two finger white head that subsided to a half finger very slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, earth, spices, floral, and fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, earth, floral, grain, banana, and spices. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. This was a pretty good example of the style. Lots of the right flavors in all the right places. It did have a nice balance going on as well with the floral and banana aspect going on. I really wish this would have carried over into the aroma some as it was a little light. Worth trying if you are a fan of the style as it was pretty nice, but I wouldn’t make it my first."

"Drink- I had heard good things about this but didnt live up to the hype for me."

"Overall a great organic offering that I like slightly more than the traditional Saison DuPont."

"Overall (4.0): As with the taste rating, nothing about this beer REALLY blows me away but everything is done well, and very well at that. Classic saison, true to style (of the non-bretty varieties), and just very even-handed and well-done. Great job, can’t wait to try other Duponts in the future!"
"Incredible aroma and flavor, complex and hard to believe no spices. Just can't place the aroma, maybe some kind of bread cooking?. A bit heavy for a traditional saison. Mouthful a bit heavy and creamy and I'd guess wheat but ingredients don't list it. Not a favorite saison of mine, but well made and worth trying."
""

"O: this was great - very enjoyable - when I hear ""farmhouse ale"" I imagine a warm summer day, blues skies and a red barn withd stacks of hay. This is exactly what you want to be drinking."
"Had this on tap at the front door. A nice 1: frothy white head on a straw colored clear beer with plenty of carbination. A nice floral boquet with a hint of citrus. I like Belgian beer and Saisons, so this beer appealed to me. It was easy to drink and I would recommend this beer."

"375 mL bottle poured into a DuPont glass. This beer is in a green bottle and it was on a shelf near a big window. I tried to get the one that was the most shaded but to no avail. This has a pretty skunky aroma. It’s my fault for buying it though so I’ll evaluate after it breathes awhile. In the meantime, the color is a slightly orange-tinted gold -- totally opaque --with a towering French vanilla head. Five minutes later, revisiting the aroma, the skunk has left the building. Now it’s mainly grass, pepper, pale malts and honey. Pretty classic non-brett saison aroma. That malty honeyed aspect combined with a mild banana pith note to form the bedrock of the.flavor. It’s honestly a little sweet for me and lacks refreshing character of the garden-variety Saison DuPont. This shortcoming is reduced a bit when I pour the last of the bottle into the glass and get some yeast mixing in. Finish is dry with a touch of mineral character but there’s some residual sweetness that sticks around the back if the palate."
""
"Great brew. Why some low ratings? This is a terrific Saison."
""
""
""
""
"Taste is back to what I expected. Lots and lots of lemon rind. I would guess an overdose of Belgian yeast. This is a rather dry beer with good carbonation. I mean lots of carbonated bite. Many other saison beers I have had lately are thicker body and sweeter. This one is a nice change. The overwhelming taste here is the citrus rind but funk is also evident. I find this beer pretty refreshing."
""
""
""
"Overall - 4/5 - easy to drink Belgian saison. A little scary because it is 7.5%, so it could definitely sneak up on you! I would drink this beer again, but might seek out other saisons as I can imagine a better version."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Would I consider buying again: No"
""
""
""
""
""
"Certainly not the best Saison that I've had, but very tasty and VERY refreshing. If it were on tap at my local joint I would def drink a lot of this. I personally prefer the sour end of the Belgium spectrum, but this was still a nice buy."

"A product of Dupont house, that is to say a great product."
""
" This saison is tangy/spicy with mildly hoppy noble flavor with slight melon and white grape from the yeast and mild tea-like flavor with the wheat taste coming forward mid-taste which gives a slight citrus tang and hint of grassy character comes in toward the finish with slight dustiness from the yeast and an almost cracker-like malt toastiness. Overall I enjoyed this beer a lot, a very good saison with plenty of that trademark DuPont character which is very fresh and has a nice hoppy flavor with plenty of drinkability to spare, it refreshes and the dry body is something I am fond of , pretty great for the style."
""
""
""
"Besides the skunkiness, it was an enjoyable, but overall forgettable saison. Would love to try a fresh one and see how it compares. Love a little bit more spice and lemon in my saisons."
""
""
""
""
"While I don't see the big connection here between this and normal Dupont, this is a nice, funky-fruity Saison. I'd recommend."
"From the Dupont family: lighter than both the Saison Dupont and Bon Voeux; an awesome starter Saison for anyone wanting to get started on Farmhouse style ales."
"O: This is an excellent saison and would be a masterpiece from any brewery that did not produce Saison Dupont. Compared to the classic, it is a little thinner and a little less intense, but remains an extremely solid, enjoyable brew."
"The flavor of this isn’t like any saison I’ve had. I don’t dislike it or like it. It really is unique and worth trying if for nothing else to try a unique flavor. I won’t be going back to this one the flavors don’t work for me. It seems like there’s an amount of stale dead flavor."
"I will drink this many times in the future. I'm sure!"
"This has a bold effervescence that just dances on the palate. Have I used that phrase before? It’s just as appropriate here. More suited for spring than the cooling days of fall, as the palate reminds me of …well, let’s see. Some zest, more lemon than orange. Flowers, ever so slightly. A bit of damp hay. Like the first warming rains of the season, perhaps? As this is the organic version of the style’s classic I certainly expected just as much. Every bit an enjoyable saison."
"O- Not the best of the style by any means, but worth a try."
"O: an ok saison, easily poundable. too malty for my tastes."
"This is a smooth, fun, thirst quenching beer that's perfect for sunny afternoon."
"Taste - Just as complex as the aroma. Malty, but not sweet. Apple and other fruity, Belgian yeast esters through the middle, a bit of spice, and a dry finish that has just enough bitterness to balance everything out."
"Pours a very hazy, golden straw color with a huge, frothy white head that lingers for quite some time. Scent is extremely grassy and reeks of tart green apples, melon, and citrus. There are some lovely Belgian yeast notes as well. Not much funk to this one. Taste is initially melon flavors...then shifts to green apples, lemon, and mango. Then I get some grassy flavors with Belgian yeast and clove. Finishes dry and hoppy. Mouthfeel is very carbonated and dry. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this is a very tasty and refreshing saison. It's definitely not my favorite saison, but a saison worth trying."
"Overall: Worth the try in a 330 ml bottle. There are better Saisons to be had."
"D: Very nice saison offering that I'll be keeping my eye out for again. Bonus marks for a killer label!"
"750 ml corked and caged bottle, 2010 printed on the cork. Served in a tulip glass, the beer pours a cloudy straw gold color with a couple inch frothy white head that stays around for a long time. There's also a lot of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is lemon peel, pears, herbs, tart apples, and a bit of skunk and funk. The brew tastes like lemon peel, peppery spice, bready malt and some apple. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's well carbonated and a bit dry. It's a little too well carbonated for my liking. Not a bad brew, but this one just doesn't do much of anything for me. I'll have to try this again in the future, but for now I'd pick other saisons before this one."
"Overall - Fantastic."
"This beer was poured for me as the Farmhouse in Emmaus. The beer was a nice golden color, hazy and not see through at all. The smell is a little funy but its mostly grainy and has a light amount of hops. The taste is also grainy and has a nice amount of Belgian yeast on the flavor. The mouthfeel is smooth and lightly carbonated, leaving just a light bubbly bite on the tongue. Overall I found this to be a pretty good Farmhouse Ale."
"Oh...and it is organic! = no pesticides and chemicals in the water that my homebrew comes from."
"Overall - Normally, I’m a huge fan of Saisons but something about this one felt slightly lacking to me. The look drew me in but I don’t think the flavor lived up to its appeal. I would almost certainly have this one again, but I probably wouldn’t go out of my way to get it."
"The beer appeared a nice, hazy golden amber color with a huge white head that was very well retained throughout the beer that also left some nice lacing on the glass. The beer had the aroma that you would expect from the style, a nice spicy, citrus aroma with hints of the yeast. The taste is excellent...what one would expect from a saison, but this one takes it up a notch. A nice strong, spicy and citrus taste with that Belgian yeast backbone. The beer had a lighter medium feel to it with higher carbonation, but as expected. The beer had a nice dry finish. Overall, this is an excellent beer and one that I am glad that I ran across and I hope to again."
"O - Not overly impressed, but overall solid."
"Great mouthfeel that is well carbonated and carries great front to back."
"Refreshing, crisp body with a full mouth feel."
"You should pick up a bottle. Yup, I stand by that universal statement."
"Notes: While not extraordinary this sits better on my palate than their classic Dupont, not one of my favorite Saisons. And organic certification hype aside, I'd gladly cross paths with this one in the future."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and bubbly with a medium body feel and a semi-dry finish. Overall, Foret is not a bad Saison. The funk however does seem to overpower the malts and the beer lacks the amazing diversity of flavors you get from Saison Dupont."
"Earthier, sweeter pull than the infamous Saison DuPont. Plenty of alcohol and hop drying going on in the finish. Sharper flavor contrasts than I typically like in a saison....not exactly refreshing. Seems to lack the brightness and snappy, clean deliciousness of a DuPont. Although if it is farmhouse flavors you are seeking, this is your beer. Yeast plays a huge role in this beer and throws off lots of funky esters. Alot of character that just doesnt seem to make it through in American-brewed saisons. That said, I still find this a little disappointing considering Brasserie Dupont kicks out the quintessential example of the style in the lovely green and yellow checkered label."
"D - A very refreshing brew, great variety of tastes."
"There is hardly a better balanced, more versatile saison on the shelves than Foret."
"D - As I mentioned this is my first time drinking this style. The thing I liked most about this beer was the slightly funky malty character and bitter flavors. The typical banana and clove notes you find in Belgians take a back seat to the earthy malt flavor, hop bitterness and peppery spice. A very unique beer."
"O: Of the Dupont saisons, this is probably my favorite. Nicely complex with lots of good flavors."
"Drinkability – This is a good beer, but doesn’t hold a flame to Saison Dupont. Rustic, earthy, and a bit raw and an overall enjoyable saison."
"Overall not too bad, masking a high abv but really small in taste and flavor, feels alright but nothing much that seems to grab me while drinking this beer."
"Overall: Great saison, doesn't compare to Fantome but nothing does. Very enjoyable and complex. Drinks incredibly easily."
"I wish I could get this on Tap!"
"Overall this saison is enjoyable from start to finish. Definitely would seek this one out again down the road."
"Overall: A damn fine saison. Tasty, light and easy to drink overall. Possibly Dupont's finest saison."
"(D)- An excellent saison. Has a nice earth profile with good fruits. Coming from the same place that does Saison Dupont, I almost like and enjoy this one better."
"T/M: Very effervescent...there is a definite malt presence...there are some lemon or citrus character and some spicy notes as well. There is a slight bitter edge, but it's not a bad thing. I think it helps even out the beer."
"I congratulate Brasserie Dupont for such a unique brew, but I struggled getting through the one glass (I was happy to be sharing the bottle), and don't really ever want to drink this again."
"Notes: This is an Outstanding Saison with classic Belgian flavor and complexity all in a deceivingly drinkable package."
"Overall- Saison Dupont is awesome, and this one was well, not so much. I wouldn't really call this dry, crisp, or refreshing. Saison is my favorite style, this one was not for me, at all."
"D: surprisingly roasty and smoky for a Saison, my mouth tastes and feels like I just smoked a Cuban and downed a pint of bourbon. It's certainly interesting..."
"Overall an excellent beer. Very unique and enjoyable."
"D-I prefer this to the regular DuPont. A really great saison that I will revisit in the future."
"D: This beer is refreshing, satisfying, and provides a nice feeling that beer can be both complex and simple. I feel like I should do out and buy the rest of this where I found it. So good."
"Pours a very hazy blonde with a big frothy white head leaving plenty of lace. The aroma is funky with some barnyard notes, but has a lot of fresh noble and maybe Czech hop character in there as well. There is a pronounced fruitiness with some lemon and banana as well. The flavor is nicely spicy with a good fruitiness and banana with a nice spicy hoppiness. There is a mild tartness and a great earthy and minerally character as well. Once again the palate is sprizty and full like a good saision should be. Among my favorites in the style."
"D - A refreshing offering with a bit of complexity. Also, there is a unicorn on the label."
"D: Sweet and flavorful. The balance across everything is incredible; especially for the style. Not better or worse that Saison Dupont, but enjoyably different."
"D: No doubt this beer could be enjoyed in a good quantity over an evening. Very drinkable, despite the sweetness, it ends dry so it is not nauseating."
"A saison should finish dry, and this one does. Flavor coats the palate for quite a while despite the dry finish. Despite the lighter flavor of this style the 7.5 abv is very well hidden. Very drinkable, highly flavorful saison from Dupont."
"D - Great drinkability, but a tad sweet."
"taste is a delicious balance between the fruity yeasts, a bit of nutmeg/clove like spicey flavour and a clean, refreshing hop backbone...just a joy to drink."
"D: Foret is so sweet and intense I don't think I could have enjoyed much more than the 5 or 6 ounces I tried. However, I appreciate the attempt at being different. This is an utterly original saison."
"D - I like this beer, but am unlikely to reach for it over Saison Dupont or a better BSPA."
"To start, this will go good with a brunch high in fat. The savory and spicy flavors in the beer will go well with most savory breakfasts and the meat, even hollandaise sauce can't stand up to the high levels of carbonation here."
"Pours a slightly hazy straw color with billowing white head, great retention and think rings of lace when it finally begins to settle. Smell: spicy, lemony, grainy, with a little banana. Taste: very similar to the nose - very mildly sweet and grainy pils malt, fairly aggressive spicy hopping, lemon, muted grassy and banana notes, finishes a bit peppery. Carbonation is maybe a little high. This seems quite different from their flagship saison, and not in a good way. But it's still pretty enjoyable. Not sure how to read the code on the label, but according to the cork, a 2010 bottling."
"750 mL green champagne bottle with cork and cage presentation; conditioned, with 2.008 on the cork. Brewed with organic malt and hops, and filtered artesian well water. It is a lightly-hazed golden straw, with an inch of whitish head that is constantly replenished by the high carbonation, and leaves loads of frothy lacing and I drink. Quite aromatic, perfumy and fruity, with orange, pear, peach, light hops, a bit of grainy malt and a hint of alcohol. Very similar flavor, with the addition of spicy hops and yeast, and a bit of sweetness and bitterness. Perhaps a little earthy, with a flash of cork and a light dose of sourness on top of a medium body that delivers lots of mouth-filling foam and a dry finish. This is a very enjoyable beer that is quite easy to drink despite the higher alcohol content. I would definitely have this one again."
"Overall this is a great saison however I prefer the saison dupont slightly over this brew. This has less banana and tropical yeast flavors and more spicy notes. Still a very nice Belgian."
"D - This beer was a great surprise. I tend to love Saisons and feel that Belgians do it so much better. This was a good example."
"D - interesting to say the least. but Saison du Pont does with class, this does with strength and guile. a little fruity for my taste but it balances well, and will knock you on your ass as it quenches your thirst."
"D: This guy is pretty drinkable. Just curious as to how long this actual bottle I consumed has aged for. I read a few reviews about the alcohol being more prominent, but I didn't find it bothersome - perhaps my aging and desensitized palate is to blame."
"jd"
"Overall, this is a fantastic saison. A must try if you're a fan of the style."
"Pours a cloudy lemon-yellow. SUPER carbonated, with an enormous, pillowy head that sticks to the glass. Lots of citrus in the nose - lemon, orange peel, and maybe even some peach. Belgian style yeast also in there. So far this is excellent. Flavor is a vibrant, tangy moutfull. Very rich for a Saison style beer. Finish is long and carries just a slight bitterness. Very excellent beer. Delicious and organic, believe it or not. Very much worth tracking down and excellent college football beer"
"D: carbonated, dry, and hoppy. This is a drinkable beer. the 7.5abv sneaks up on ya. This is up there on my list of saisons."
"Price = $9 at Ginger Man (NYC)"
"Drinkability: Good stuff, easy drinking. This is one I will enjoy again."
"Overall it is a pretty good saison, not my favorite but worthy."
"Decent flavor, somewhat disapointing as I expected something fantastic and I just find it to be okay. Yeasty, heavily carbonated, very little alcohol flavor for a 7.5% beer. Slight lemon taste, very light flavor and mild aftertaste. Very drinkable for the alcohol content but not that tasty."
"Seems a bit subdued in subtleties vs. the standard Saison Dupont but is a worthy alternative and shares much of the yeast character with a touch more sweetness and alcohol."
"All around an extremely solid beer. I was under the impression this was simply an organic version of Duponts standard Saison so the differences really stood out. Hops aren't as present as I expected and the phenols seem to be more restrained. That said, all of Brasserie Dupont's products seem to have a little bottle variation so I can't say for certain to what extent the differences were caused by the organic hops and malt. Highly recommended for anyone who's interested in a bolder fruitier Saison."
"It has a slightly dry finish with a little residual sweetness. Very refreshing and delicious. Very smooth on the way down and I'll probably drink this one faster than planned..."
"Enjoyable Saison. Period."
"D-this is very tasty, lots of good things going on, the flavor doesn't quite have the bold tastes as the aroma did; but still great balance of flavors."
"Nice carbonation and medium/chewy mouthfeel. Not exactly something you'd bang back, but goes down nicely."
"This exemplary farmhouse ale is supremely tasty and easy to drink. I moved from glass to glass like it was water. Bravo!"
"Overall this is a smooth, good beer that falls short of it's counterpart Vieille Provision. It lacks the zest and lively character of this other brew and the bitterness is more mild, I miss it. This is still a good beer in it's own right."
"d: could definitely drink a bunch of this! ...I'd rather drink the traditional Saison DuPont, though. I miss the slight sour, slight funk...perhaps if this was aged a while..."
"This is a great example of a Saison that showcases one aspect of the saison profile (earthiness, as opposed to fruitiness, sourness, funkiness, hoppiness, or phenolicness). Usually I prefer a saison to try and deftly hit as many of those possibilities as it can but this very earthy saison is really enjoyable. I think I love the narrative most of all. It uses USDA certified organic hops and barley and ""filtered artisan well water."" But the flavors also invoke nature and the circle of life. New growth is generated from the decay of the old. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. There is no nebulous scoring category of ""artisticness"" that I can rank this beer in but it would score highly in that category if I could."
"Nicely drinkable, though the complexity fights off a bit of drinkability."
"D: The beer is very refreshing and easy to drink. Not a trace of alcohol is perceptible."
"This organic beer is gold in color topped by a thick cream colored head that is produced by an solid amount of carbonation. The taste is light and refreshing, floral, with perhaps a hint of acidity in the finish. This is quite nice, light and refreshing with enough complexity to keep me interested in each sip."
"The most important things for me in a saison is balance and drinkability and this has both in spades. Very enjoyable and organic to boot."
" Easily my favorite saison so far."
"Drinkability: Sessionable."
"D - Insanely quaffable... Quite refreshing... An excellent brew from start to finish... A world class Saison... I highly recommend and will welcome in my glass without hesitation..."
"Pours a brilliant orange into my Watou over-sized wine glass. A nice fluffy head rests gently on top and fades slowly with a little bit of lace left behind. A huge musty, alcoholic aroma rises out of the glass and permeates the surrounding area, which is a good thing. Further inspection reveals big malts and fruits, some straw and some burnt sugar. yeast and orange peel. Very complex, and very promising. Tastes fruity up front with an initially creamy mouth-feel which actually finishes dry. Some hop bitterness mingles with a hint of spiciness and it's all finished with a big malt backbone. After a few sips a nice alcohol warmth presents itself. Medium-bodied and highly drinkable, in the sense that there's plenty of taste, but it goes down lightly and without too much weighing on the old gut. Excellent!"
"I would highly recommend this beer."
"Taste: Belgian yeast with a little tart fruitiness towards the end. Finishes with a modest spiciness from the hops."
"Cloudy orangish in the glass, with a neon-white head that last long enough to blast you in the face with yeast and dough, and a healthy nostril-filling dose of oranges and lemons with a little clove to boot. Plenty of all this in the taste, too, with emphasis on hoppy citrus tones that compete with, but are not overshadowed by, the bread. The spiciness from some cinnamon and more cloves provides a nice touch at the edges. Definitely a winner, but no surprise: it's from BD! Can't lose there."
"Big points on the drinkability - although I wish there was a little more to the flavor. I will be getting another one of these soon."
"A slightly softer, more refined beer than Saison Dupont. Both are great in their own rights. This one is a top notch Saison."
"D-Very drinkable indeed. I might go get some more of this along with exploring the style more in other offerings, especially for the summertime! But this is very delightful indeed."
"D- Im beginning to absolutely love saisons. I think this summer will be my summer of saisons. This beer will probably make a come back for the summer but still its no Fantome."
"This is my first Saison style, which I am happy to get to try. I will look for more."
"Rich, creamy, medium-bodied, effervescent, and zippy all at once. Quite refreshing, a good balance between rustic and refined - another solid ale from Dupont."
"Overall, this is a good saison, but Dupont does better and this is more of a nice gateway. It's a real saison, not some filtered chick beer from a macro masquerading as a saison. But it's not the best out there. The regular Dupont and the Avec are much better. Drink but do not seek."
"Drink: I'd go for their standard, the Saison Dupont before I'd pick this up again. Not bad, just not good enough."
"Overall, this is a very nice and flavorful beer. It has a lot of complexity and balance. At the same time, it isn't overwhelming alcohol wise. A really enjoyable beer to savor on many occasions."
"The beer ours a murky yellow color with a small white head. Not a very attractive beer. The aroma is light funk with some strong citrus lemon notes. The flavor is lemon, funk, Belgian yeast and some nice sweetness. A relatively funky saison. Medium carbonation and medium mouthfeel."
"Poured a corked and caged 750ml into my Hennepin globe. This beer pours a hazy butternut squash with a massive 4-inch fluffy white head that lasts for days and leaves lacing for miles. Brasserie Dupont really knows what a Saison is supposed to look like and how to craft a Saison to look exactly like what they want. The aroma is rather intense. Sour green apple skins mixed with pear, a bit of grassy hops, and lemon zest. Also whatever strain of yeast was used put off some serious spicy notes with lots of white pepper, a bit of coriander and a bit of clove. Probably the most unexpected component to the nose was the amount of banana that was present. When my wife took a sip it was the first thing she noticed. Makes me wonder if there is some kind of connection between a hefe yeast and the one(s) that was used to ferment/condition this one. The flavor is just as intense as the nose. Big, bold flavors are abound but equally work well meshed together. Big spice up front, with coriander, clove, and white pepper. Lots of fruit presence. Lemon zest, orange peel, green apples and over ripe pears. The hops definitely take a back seat in this Saison but there this just a bit of grass and hay. Also there is a bit of earth and funk along with it. The last component is just a bit of green bottle funk that actually adds another layer to the complexity of this beer. The mouthfeel is light, with a crisp carbonation finishing with just a bit of dryness. This is a great beer. Dupont really knows how to make a Saison."
"Overall I thought this was a solid saison but nothing really stood out. Not worth seeking out but definitely worth a shot."
"really well-rounded beer! definitely worth revisiting."
"pours a golden wheat semi-hazed color with a fluffy white head that does recede with sticky lacing..the smell is clove,apples ,pears and pepper and spice nothing strong just pleasant the taste is good its a fruit and clove start with other fruits like plum and fig followed by some nice hops and malt and yeast..i found this to be highly drinkable and a tasty saison that was well balanced and flavorful.. a nice place to start for a Belgian for a first time or to revisit as i do from time to time"
"d- pretty easy going down for 7.5% i like this one alot. im drinking it at room temp right now and im really looking forward to the next one being chilled. good beer to slowly introduce people into the vast world of delicious belgian beers."
"D-great food beer. However, maybe too assertive for drinking by itself."
"Poured a clear golden body wiht a gushing, sticky head. Earthy, dirty, woody are among the aromas I noticed along with some funky yeast and both sweet and sour fruit notes like grape/cherries and citric. Really light and sweet the beer passes over the tongue smoothly. A light sugar sweetness combines with mild fruit notes like citrus and grape for a well-balanced ale that has a tad sour, dry backbite that perfectly complements the drink. A great beer to sip."
"D: One of the best saisons I've had. A good brew as a summer quencher, yet strong enough for the colder months as well."
"I started reviewing this beer when it was still fairly cold. Wait for it to warm up a bit and enjoy."
"I like this beer a lot and would drink it again."
"D: Very drinkable, excellently refreshing, crisp and fruity. Nothing mind-blowing, but solid."
"Taste is a bit more refined. Nice farmhouse funk, but not overpowering, with a clean kiss of hops. Imminently drinkable, thoroughly enjoyable. Good beer."
"11.2 oz bottle had a pretty good layer of dust on it at the local wine/beer superstore. Bought it anyways since I've never had a farmhouse ale. Poured to glass. Gentle pour brought on a thick white head. Very aromatic but hard to pinpoint what I'm getting, maybe some yeast and funk, a little sharpness that I like. Very unique flavor, but again I like it. Mostly getting malt and a little sour, a little starchy flavor, but not the sweetness I thought I'd get, finishes quite dry. I wouldn't consider this a ""big"" beer but I get almost no alcohol flavors despite being 7.5%, quite a trick. This was very interesting, I'd like to try more of this style."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: Keenly drinkable like the standard version, though, I would say this is just a tad sweeter. Usually, Saison Dupont is my go-to beer for Thanksgiving dinner, but I thought I'd mix it up a bit this year. It all worked out well, I'd say."
"Very sturdy and impressive for being aged so long. Have had this many times all of varying ages and it drinks as well at 2 years as it does at 6 months. This beer is a classic."
"brownish dark orange body with a bright white head of one finger. quite turbid, good lacing. sweet fruity smell, malty and a good yeast portion, but lacking some potency. has some really dry ethanol alcohol taste in the finish, but the overall taste is like a less juicy tripel: it has the same sweetness, but less of that yeasty body. the aftertaste has a big bitter component that lasts a couple of seconds; tastes likes bitter astringent hops. good carbonation, and a well balanced body."
"Very traditional, and I love it. Dupont knows how to make Saisons. I highly recommend this."
"Quite nice, complex and interesting, even though I am not a big fan of farmhouse ales."
"Drinkability: This may well be the best organic beer I've had a chance to taste. It has excellent drinkability. I could easily sit and have this beer all evening and will definitely be looking for this again. It may not be the best saison around but it will do nicely until that one comes along."
"Overall, a decent beer, nothing great. I've had far better Saisons but I've seen this around for a while now and figured (as I'm trying to be more green in my daily life) that it was worth a shot. I'll choose a different beer next time, but glad I got a chance to try it."
"the beer is exceedingly carbonated and very light. easy to drink, but unfortunately limited to 11.2 ounce bottles."
"I was prepared for disappointment. I was pleasantly surprised."
"D: Top notch, very similar to the standard Saison Dupont, but perhaps a shade less robust... all and all, a refreshing saison that typifies why this style is a favorite of mine"
"M/D - Light and crisp, just like a saison should be. Very easy drinking."
"This is a tasty brew, great flavors traditional to the style, refreshing, and easy to drink."
"Wow! I believe my bottle is pretty fresh. This saison offers it all. Great Job!"
"light to medium body, some astringency (from phenols?) into the finish, w crisp carbonation that also has moments of fluffiness and creaminess."
"Pours a perfect light yellow color with a small white head that sticks around and leaves excellent lacing. Aromas and tastes are perfect for a saison - lots of yeast and slightly spicy malt and hop balance up front. A ton of funk in the background - a strong ""dirtiness"" sitting in the back of your mouth for the duration of the drink. Feel is appropriate for the style. Really a big fan of this one - love the style, and this is a perfect, highly drinkable example."
"Had this one on Tap at the Trappist in Oakland. Hazy yellow with a white head. Lots of hop aroma and a healthy dose of yeasty spice. Smells delightful. Drinks extremely easy for 7.5%. There is a substantial bitter hop/spice flavor that sticks in your mouth for a while. All said it's a nice beer. I would order it again."
"Produced about 2.5 fingers bright white foam that dissipated rather quickly. Poor to no lacing. This brew has a wonderful aroma of apples and pears. There is a huge taste of yeast, wich is followed by a pleasant belt of hops in the aftertase. This beer is quite lively on the tongue due a high level of carbonation. Overall, a highly reconmended brew."
"Notes: This might be my highest rated Saison (I did not check yet). Man am I glad that I found this at Heinen's. Anyone reading this who appreciates Saisons should seek this beer out, a real treat that would go with many, many foods but most especially some cheese and crackers, enjoyed with a view say from a balcony overlooking the farm where the grains were grown."
"D - Split this one with beerinator at a restaurant and enjoyed it so much that I had to purchase it again."
"AFTERMATH. This may be my favorite saison. It's light, refreshing, if you want, you could swill it. But you could just as well take it slow, letting the yeasty-bitter finish linger between sips, leaving room for contemplation. I would not mind stocking my fridge with this one for those long summer nights."
"I like it."
"Pours a cloudy yellow orange color with a thin white head. Minimal lacing on the edges. Aromas of coriander, banana, orange peel, and some yeast funk. Taste is that of the smell. Creamy banana and nice orange hints. Very creamy gentle mouthfeel overall. Pretty drinkable overall but I have had better saisons."
"Drinkability - A little to much like a hefe-weizen for my taste, and that affects the score a little here. An interesting drink, but if your looking for a true Sasion, you best look elsewhere."
"Overall an interesting and tangy brew. I think I might have liked Saison DuPont a bit more but it's been a few years. I will definitely be buying this one again!"
"This is by no means a picture-perfect Saison due to the huge Saaz and Pilsener qualities but it's still a fine quaff and with warmth gets closer to the style benchmarks. Ain't no denying that it's a fun, crisp offering to truck down - a true summer treat, on-style or not. Wonder what brats would taste like when we boiled 'em in this $#!+? Probably like something awesome..."
"D- A very nice example of the style and it hides the alcohol well. A great warm weather beer."
"D = This is actually a little too easy drinking, as though it were watered down Saison."
"I feel that, for a saison, this could use a bit more spice to offset the greater earthiness of the organic malt."
"Served in a Duvel tulip glass, pours a hazy, golden straw yellow color, finished on top with thick, fluffy 3 finger white head. In the nose there is lemon, yeast, peppery notes. Taste is crisp, citrusy, spicy notes. Not one of the best saisons i've had, but respectable, a pretty easy drinking one on a hot day, has a pretty light body for the ABV. A complex, yet simple brew. Billed as an organic beer, i guess that is a plus if you are looking for that kind of thing."
"Pours a very light colored body, yellow cloudy and fizzy. Big foamy fluffy head and big bubbles, very lasting, white. Aroma of spiciness, floralness too. Perfumy and very fragrant. Spicy fragrant taste. light and floral. Very tasty. Light and somewhat drying. Very tasty. Effervescent."
"D: Rather good, but Vieille Provision is better. I'm glad I tried it, but I don't think I'll be seeking it out again."
"Somewhat more bitter than other saisons, it does serve to set in apart in an enjoyable way."
"D: Quite drinkable, not an easy beer to find but definitely worth trying."
"D= Not as good as Saison DuPont, but I think its second only to that! I really enjoyed this one and will certainly buy it again."
"33cL bottle. Pours a hazy golden orange with a huge, billowing white head. Quite a bit of sediment. Strong aroma of bubblegum with lots of floral/herbal notes. Hops are present, as well as some spice. Tastes of spicy yeast and floral, bitter hops with a fruity, sweet background. Well carbonated with a light-medium body. Quite refreshing."
"Pours a hazy yellow/orange huse with a towering white head. Aroma is earthy and yeasty. Grass and pine, a hint of lemony citrus and a pale malt sweetness. Taste follows the nose. Nice earthy tones and and pale malt. There's a tocuh of sweetness in the palate but a nice tartness in the background, rounds the beer out nicely. Light on the palate, with a crisp refreshing finish. A really great embodiment of the style. Only critique is that it may be a touch too sweet. This beer could be confused for a triple, which certainly isnt the worst insult for a pale belgian beer. But a little more earthy farmhouse-quality wouldnt hurt."
"Pours a cloudy amber color with a thick head, but not much lacing. Smell is amazing; grass, fruit, pepper, spices? I could smell this beer for hours. Taste is very refreshing, dry and very, very flavorful with a nice hop smack at the end. Each sips begs another. Mouthfeel is rich, very lively and rich carbonation coats the mouth nicely. Not a session beer, but the aroma and taste are so amazing, I could drink this every day, all day (I don't). A fabulous beer and fantastic representative of the Saison style; it doesn't get any better for me."
"Drinkability- Very!!!"
"Poured from a 750 ml bottle into my Orval chalice. Appearance was a hazy golden yellow color, and quite fizzy as well. The nose was not terribly complex: mostly yeast, with a little citrus....flavor was disappointing, consisting of grass and a little yeast."
"Similar saisons would Troegs Scratch 14, Saison DuPont and Southampton Saison Deluxe. Cheers!"
"HV"
"Pours a hazy golden yellow color with a thick foamy white head that settles into a thin lace. Fruity, hoppy aroma with a nice woodsy, pine scent. Very crisp golden ale with hints of apple, and pear up front with a nice dry hoppy finish. Very quaffable with the ABV very well hidden. Highly recommended."
"D - This is an okay saison. I did not enjoy the aroma, but it tasted okay."
"Fizzy, carbonated. Medium body."
"Foret Saison has a cloudy yellow fizzy appearance. Smells a little sweet. It has that meaty bubblegum flavor that's kinda nice. Very wheaty. Has a medium to heavy body. Overall good beer, and very drinkable. I would totally get it again and would recommend it to someone who like beer that tastes like bubblegum."
"The taste is crisp and light, a bit fizzy but soft. It has hints of lemon, grain, banana, pear, a weak hint of yeastiness, and a very light tartness. it's a bnit on the sweet side otherwise and has some definite hefeweizen-like character."
"The aroma is very fresh fruit similar to an apple cider or pears. There is a very pleasant fruity sweetness. At first the VERY peppery hop flavor smacks you in the face. The pear and apple flavor comes through after the pepper dies down. The spicing is light and perhaps not enough. The feel is crisp and tingly from the carbonation. Too peppery! I wouldn't need a big bottle of this but its still tasty, and organic!"
"Goes down smooth and will refresh for a session!"
"drinkability: good"
"Pours an opaque & glowing honeyed lemon color, big pillowy white head isn't going anywhere anytime soon, moderate amount of foamy lacing clinging to the glass. Some banana aromas, yeasty & earthy, faint lemon. More citrus on the tongue, slightly puckering green apple, peppery, some vague lingering bitterness. Really actively carbonated, super-refreshing, and also pretty creamy. This one is nice....I could drink a Saison anytime of year, and this is a really tasty and versatile example."
"smooth drinking 7.5 percent booze. i like it. nice for refreshing taste and light appearance. i love the bits of seasoning, which look like pepper, floating in the beer. tastes like a mix of a belgian blonde beer and a wheat/white beer. i would buy this beer again. i do recommend this beer to anyone looking to try something a bit different. i split the bottle 3 ways with my wife an mother and we were all super happy and enjoyed this brew."
"Pours a cloudy yellow with a full pillowtop head. The aroma is predominantly skunky funk with some metallic accents and a little citrus. The skunk doesn't carry over to the taste, leaving a nice bitter earthiness, with some grassy notes and a hint of the metallic mineral-ness. Overall, the taste is pretty good, however the smell leaves a little to be desired."
"This seems like a ""wanna be"" Saison Dupont (although - I know - same brewery). I don't know if ""organic"" has anything to do with it, but it is just a shadow of the true classic. Not bad, but unless you are really ""green"" no reason to get this with so many more satisfying saisons out there."
"pours a straw with magnificent head. big bellowing and consistent and creamy. white, and very lacy. nose is quite yeasty. and a light malt of sweet. a sweet ester saison with the taste of apples. hop is minty and astringent. robust like thyme with that nice light pollen. musky in the older bottles. quite basic and bare but simply great. i like saisons and this is a fantastic blend of doughy and dry."
"Poured from a 750mL green bottle, corked and caged. Hazy light orange color with a thick wet spitty looking head. The beer's smells are mixed, mostly funky Belgian aromatics but with a bit of what passes for skunk. Maybe it IS skunked, or maybe it's an intended byproduct, I can't tell. The taste is really good though, some fruits of the pear/banana/apple sorts, along with lots of yeasty spiciness, very delicious. I don't really taste skunk but I still smell it. The aftertaste is a little biting, more like pepper than bitterness from hops. The body is medium-thick, very nicely done."
"D: A nice Belgian, easy to drink, but not so complex as others can be. Some nice warm flavours come as it warms up... I'd gladly have it again, I suppose."
"Overall, this is a tasty beer. Refreshing and solid. Perhaps a tad too thin in mouthfeel, but good none the less."
"Drinkability: Not too much to say about this one. I've had better saisons, and I've had worse saisons. It's a little one-dimensional, or at least simplistic, but what's there isn't bad."
"Only my 2nd Dupont beer, but it begs the question ""Where has Dupont been all my life?"" Consider me a fan! Great stuff."
"Body is medium, mouthfeel crisp, yet sort of flat or 'watery' in a desireable sense."
"i like this a lot, very drinkable as a late summer beer, a bit too bold to be your heat wave refresher... i'd suggest you take a nice salmon filet, something caught wild of course, crack some salt and pepper on it and grill it with a few green peppers and sweet onions (let them little bastards char a bit).. throw all the shit into a dish and cover it.. then get out your shotgun and shoot a few rounds of skeet or trap, maybe just put some big ass holes in the side of a refrigerator box with a chalk outline of your cousin on it, kill off a case of shells or shoot till your shoulder cries and head back inside.. make up a nice salad using fresh spring mix, the salmon (cubed), the grilled onions and peppers, and a cool vinaigrette of your preference then sit down and eat the shit with 2 or 3 bottles of this here beer while discussing the finer points of your lethal accuracy with double-ought buckshot and you got yourself one fine autumn afternoon my friend"
"Overall- A fantastic beer that is very true to style. This beer is awesome for those hot summers as it is light and refreshing."
"Nearly the ideal Saison that's sure to win over lovers of dry white wines and earthy Belgain Ales."
"Foret's drinkability is limited by its boldness. Not sure if this would benefit from some aging. A good beer, probably one of the best organic offerings available."
"Nice earthy, fruity (not too much) flavor with some yeast and a bit of grass. Definitely on the lighter side. Will certainly drink again."
"drinkability is good. good balance. really a classic example of the style."
"D: great drinkability"
"I thoroughly enjoyed this and really liked the increased hoppiness. Not quite as complex as Saison Dupont but very well crafted and very tasty. Great beer. I need to get my hands on more beers from Brasserie Dupont."
"I really need say nothing other than that this is textbook saison, in each and every way. The organic certainly hurt nothing and is a trend I hope will catch on with North American brewers. I can't help but feel the beer was aptly named because I could easily see myself packing a book, a little picnic basket of food, the bottle of Foret, and happily spending an afternoon sitting under a tree somewhere. In fact, next time I will and I recommend you do the same."
"Light and quirky. Very pleasant, very tasty. I like it. Of the three Saisons I've had (Hennepin, Le Merle) I definitely like this one the best."
"Foret is the beneficiary of magnificent feel and drinkability with wonderful flavors and spectacular balance. Medium-bodied, perfectly carbonated, and outstanding in every way I can think of, this beer leaves me at a loss for superlative words to describe just how superior this drink really is."
"D: Another tasty if not ovrwhelming saison from Dupont, would be a really good food beer, I'd have again on-tap, but wouldn't pop the 9 bucks for a bottle."
"The taste follows through...big earthy/musky tones with nice yeasty notes, corriander, clove, a little pepper, some citrus tartness, all in a medium bodied, medium carbonated package and it finishes delightfully dry. Very tasty and very drinkable. Yeah, it's not exactly a lightweight in the abv department but still, I can't stop taking sip after sip and I'm a big fan of the style when it is done right. This one fits that bill. No pun intended. Thanks again, Alan!"
"2007 vintage served in my Delirium Tremens tulip. Poured a hazy orange-gold with a tight 2.5 inch off-white head; excellent retention. Head eventually settled, but remained tight, leaving behind strands of fluffy lacing. Inviting scent of citrus and yeast, as well as a slight grassy presence. Taste consistent with nose, as well as some fruity esters. Mouthfeel is light and effervescent, with a noticeable tingle on the tip of the tongue and a nice clean finish with a kiss of citrus astringency and a mild hops presence at the finish. I have been drinking many saisons lately, and Foret is definitely in my top 5."
"This beer has a high drinkability. I personally haven't experienced too many Saisons/Farmhouse Ales, but this beer certainly encourages me to try more."
"Great Saison! Complex flavor profile but light enjoy to enjoy without thinking too much. Perfect on a warm day I bet!"
"D: Complex beer that is perhaps too subtle in many aspects. Much different from the regular Saison Dupont with lambic overtones."
"As for the taste, floral hops get backed by a tropical fruit yeastiness and pale Belgian malts. A bitter, lingering grass note clings to the back of the palate. Excellent carbonation in this one, and the medium body is refreshing. When it warms and loses a bit of the bubbliness, Foret gets even better, as gooey caramel malts start to dominate the flavor. At only 7.5% ABV, this beer is easy to put away (I finished off the bottle without much of a problem). However, it has the complexity to keep me interested and wanting more. I will surely be purchasing this again."
"A nice beer, however, alcohol is a little too high for the other characteristics. I'll look for this again, just in case this one was passed its prime."
"Very drinkable and very refreshing on a hot summer night."
"I haven't had this brew in a while, and I'm really glad I revisited it - picked the perfect day as well, sitting in my backyard on a nice summer Friday evening with gorgeous weather."
"D: Damn fine. Complex, yet quite easy to drink - and this from a bottle that was most likely sitting on the shelf for a while. This one is a no-brainer for me from now on."
"I have been noticing this saison at a local store for awhile and just got around to actually buying one. Neat label with animals in a foret (forest). The color of the beer is a turbid orange, murkiness which is probably from suspended yeast as there is a chalky sediment settling to the bottom of my snifter. It smells spicy, peppery, oddly like flower pollen and brown sugar. There is a slight sourness towards the back and a slippery pepper taste and feel followed by subtle apple flavors like watered down apple juice. I was surprised that this actually paired decently with sharp cheddar but it was good."
"pours hazy straw color. nice retentive lacing of a white head. aromas of slight spicy hops, buttery and citrusy. Taste notes of citrus hops, slight spicy hops, a little yeasty taste in the back of the mouth. light bodied, low ot medium carbonation. slight dry finish yet long aftertaste. For an organic poison, pretty damn tasty saison."
"Pours a golden/orange color with a magnificent large fluffy white head. Smell reeks of barnyard funkiness and belgian yeast. Taste follows with pepper, yeast, bread. Much more peppery than the regular dupont. Some spice in here as well with the barnyard farmhouse flavor. Mouthfeel is good, but slightly thin and maybe just a tiny touch overcarbonated. Drinkability is pretty much as good as a saison gets, with the exception of a select few. A fantastic organic brew by Brasserie Dupont. One I will certainly buy again. Great beer."
"Wow, I cannot believe how much I love this beer. The perfect Saison. The spicy freshness of the hops really jump right out and refresh you with their bitter but smooth descent down your gullet. It is rich, smooth, and refreshing at the same time; no easy feat. The flavors in this beer are anything but subtle. They jump right out, but are followed by a very mellow aftertaste that balances it out perfectly. There's a lot of citrus and banana in this beer. It's very spicy and has a nice hoppy bitterness."
"This is a top-notch saison and one I'll be looking for in the future. I don't know if I've ever had a better organic beer. Worth seeking out if you like saisons."
"Recommended..."
"The body is pretty light with a medium amount of carbonation. This thing is spicy and biting. The bite is a little too strong I'd say, but other than that, it's quite drinkable."
"Overall: More, please!!! And, it's organic, to boot."
"Pours a beautiful golden saisson with a thick head that slowly disapates. Tiny bubbles form at the top waiting for me to sip. Scent of peach and pears. Very smooth on the palate with bubbles that burst on the tongue. Paired with a nice turkey dinner this will do nicely. A piece of Belgian love."
"Very, very drinkable and refreshing for 7.5% abv. Lots of peppery yeastiness. I like it."
"Probably a great beer, my palate isnt there yet."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied. Both rounded smoothness and a zippy light sizzle on the tongue. A very nice Saison."
"Pours a hazy golden amber, very thick white head forms, slowly settles down to a nice layer and ring, lots of lacing on the glass. Smell is sweet, some honey, bready malt, light funk, some sourness, big citrus bouquet, yeast, bit of a sharp lemony acidic aroma, some spices, quite refreshing. Taste is nice, some wheat, vanilla, citrus, sour funk, yeast, orange peel and spice in the finish, lightly acidic. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation, very smooth, very drinkable. Thanks Chris!"
"Verdict: A decent example of a saison/farmhouse ale. I've had enough examples already that I don't think I could drink another. Still, I like this one."
"D= As much as I love this beer I couldn't have more than a couple."
"I will buy this beer again and again."
"750ml, tulip, began at ~50 degrees and ended at ~60 degrees F."
"Good, floral taste. Had some citrus notes. Much like a La Chouffe, but more citrusy. Very cloudy, unfiltered. Good aftertaste. High price for one glass, but I would buy again for a special occasion. (Especially since La Chouffe is not available in pubs in Texas.)"
"Bottle: Poured a dirty yellow/beige color ale with a huge pure white foamy head with great retention and some lacing. Aroma of bready yeast with some nice floral Belgian malt notes but not as many hops as the vieille provision. Taste was a nice combination between some floral Belgian malt with some bready yeast which also provided a slightly spicy finish. Full body with some great carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Another great beer from this fine brewery."
"Very enjoyable, interesting and peppery beer."
"D: I personally find Saisons to be the most drinkable of the Belgians, and this one is no different. I could easily put back several of these. Witch is interesting considering its a relatively high 7.5% ABV, its also 100% organic how can you lose!"
"Pours cloudy pale orange with heavy lacing and a short creamy head. Nose is a little grassy and alcoholy. The beer is rather strong in flavor with a lot of heavy herbal and fruitiness along with some noticeable alcohols (a bit too noticeable). Mouthfeel is on par with the style. Overall, I feel it could be a bit more balanced and flavorful, but is definitely a decent beer."
"Pours a cloudy, pale yellow color with a small white head. In the aroma, a dry yeastiness and somewhat skunky. In the taste, very dry, yeasty and a small hint of skunkiness. A small bite in the mouthfeel and a dry yeasty aftertaste. Very dry and yeasty, however the small skunkiness throws me off."
"A very nice, very solid beer from Dupont."
"Fairly drinkable. Crisp and dry."
"Drinkability: a good beer (bio) in the style Saison (noble beer)."
"I should add, whether you get an aged bottle or a fresh bottle, both are very good in their own way. Really hoppy fresh, cidery with some attic quality aged. You can't go wrong. One of my favorite beers."
"I can taste the clove, some bitterness, some tropical fruit (more banana than citrus). I think of a combo lemon meringue pie / pumpkin pie when it's past the tongue. That's a good thing, and this is a beer I really like. I'd say it's as good as the Saison Dupont, but with a more attractive lable."
"An excellent example of the Saison style. Pours a hazy golden copper with a huge, rocky, white, long lasting head. Lacing left all over the glass. Aroma is earthy and herbal, with a bit of funk in the background. Tastes spicy and peppery, with some herbal and fruity notes. Mouthfeel is thin with a slight touch of alcohol warming. Overall, an excellent brew. I could drink these all night."
"I must admit, that Belgian Saison is one of my favourite styles, and this, I feel, is a good example of what a Saison should be. It poured a cloudy egg yolk yellow/orange with a snow white head and plenty of fine grains of sediment. The smells is pleasantly musty like a damp basement and a bit yeasty, as well. The taste is more bitter than sour, but good none-the-less. Saison Dupont is the benchmark by which I judge all other Belgian Saisons, and this one is close, but not quite. Very tasty, though. Mouthfeel is smooth and right about where I feel it should be for the style. As I stated before, this is a good representation of the style. Glad I tried it."
"A wonderful true Belgian Saison. I am really looking forward to exploring the other Dupont offerings."
"Taste of solvent, pretty hot alcohol and estery, green apples. I don't really like this estery part of the beer. To me it appears that a lot of sugar has been used, but it could easily be the yeast. A moderate bitter, which could be better and more hoppy. The malt brings some honey and apricot taste. Drinkability is not great, due to the hot alcohol."
"Recommended. Nicely done with organics as well!"
"The organic claims made on the label of this beer intrigued me. I tasted this beer in a large 16 ounce goblet and after pouring noticed immediately it's unique mandarin color. The head was frothy and chunky with red specks dappling it's tufts from the yeast poured from the bottom of the bottle. It smelled citrusy and earthy, but the somewhat negligible hop aroma was overpowered by the yeast which clearly is meant to be the focus of the beer's multifaceted character. The first taste reached my palate with a somewhat flowery, complex flavor, bringing with it additional aromas that only served to improve its initial impression on me. A second taste revealed a smooth, nicely-carbonated, and refreshing flavor that was perfectly textured to my preferences. I felt compelled to drink this beer slowly, because the spicy notes in the taste and aroma kept me constantly searching for descriptors, but it is certainly refreshing and drinkable."
"The beer poured a nice pale orange with a decent head that diminished to a ring and left some spotty lacing. The aroma was of sweet fruits with some yeast. The taste had a good sweetness to it with a great bit of orange. There was also a very nice yeast bite to it. The beer is rather light bodied and very refreshing. This is a very enjoyable saison."
"I can't say I'd strongly recommend this."
"A medium-bodied beer that finishes rather sweet. This was a nice refreshing saison with high drinkability."
"Poured in a Rapscallion glass, formed a 2"" eggshell head over the clearish orangey gold brew. Head holds steady for quite some time, fueled by bubbling deep in the glass, with lots of heavy foamed lacing. Aroma is effervescent, lightly spiced, with some earthiness. Taste is sweet malts upfront, some spiciness in the middle, and a bitter close. Mouthfeel is extra smooth, and drinkability is excellent. Don't really care that it's organic, but good for them that made a very nice beer and could still follow those guidelines."
"Overall: A good saison but not exceptional, this one tastes a bit too biting for me. I like my saisons mellow and smooth. Worth a try."
"Taste followed the nose, more esters and yeast, smooth taste and real nice finish. Usually the saison gets too rich for me farther along the tasting, but this one finished nice."
"drinkability: This is a beginners' saison and very drinkable. Really smooth and tasty."
"don't let the hazy, cloudy appearance fool you!! big head, and perfectly carbonated... this brew gives off the aromas that get my gears turning... i smell earthy, peppery, lemony.... even barnyard animally... i know it sounds wierd, but this one evokes memories of smells that remind me of the best days of my life... summertime, harvest time... goes incredibally well (in my opinion) with sharp cheese ( queso valdeon, 5 year cheddar, gouda, funky soft french stuff), chicken, pizza and everything else unsweet... def not an appertif. don't sleep on this one - especially when it's fresh"
"At any rate, the wild yeast/farmhouse yeast lends a spicy complexity to it that is simply refreshing. As I write this, on a humid and sweltering Memorial Day afternoon in NYC, I could not think of a more perfect beer to quench my thirst."
"D- This beer has a dry crisp fresh quality with a nice peppery spice and a big club soda note with a hint of tonic quality. There is a nice hoppyness but not much in flavor more in spicy qualities."
"D - Good, I wouldn't mind having this again. It is another great saison from Dupont . . . I never would have guessed they have two."
"2008: 11.2 oz. bottle. Seemed a bit more thin, bland and metallic that what I remember from the 750 bottle reviewed above. There was a sweetness and alcoholic dryness to it, but it was missing the subtle fruit mentioned above."
"Pours perfectly clear the first pour from a 750ml bottle, with a soft, fine white head that sticks to the glass. Very aromatic, with lots of fruity esters (orange blossom) and spicy notes (nutmeg) that match up with pale malts, styrian hops and a bit of a yeasty note. It's the Dupont yeast strain all the way. On the palate, big, juicy carbonation with fine, pin-prick bubbles fills the mouth. Hop bitterness is pronounced but not over-powering. Sumptuous fruits (oranges again) and a hint of bubblegum round things out. There are plenty of sweet flavors in there, but the beer remains dry thanks to the high hop content and the relatively light body. Spot-on for the saison style and full of delectable flavors, this is very good stuff. As a bonus, I'm not a big follower of organic beers by any means, but from the limited number of them that I've had, this is easily the best one."
"Puffy, fluffy head, cloudy straw color, aroma of yeasty fruit,earth and lemongrass. Tasted deliciously soft, earthy, spicy-floral quenching! I wanted to sit out in a field on a blanket with some cheese, fruit, and bread. I wanted to quit my job, and drink every morning. This beer inspired me. Perfect for spring afternoons and summer mornings."
"Corked and caged 750ml bottle with the year 2006 printed on the cork. Poured into a tulip glass. This beer pours a cloudy golden orange color with a nice white head that has nice retention and lacing. The aroma has notes of banana and clove, sweet and sour fruit, malt and a touch of honey and spices. The taste is light and crisp with some citrus up front and a dry hoppy finish. Overall, I am a huge fan of saisons and this one is certainly one of the upper tier brews within the style. Not quite as good as Saison Dupont, but delicious in it's own right. Recommended."
"Wonderfully drinkable stuff...I've been going through a case of these with various dinners and it pairs well with most light meals...chicken , fish , risotto, etc."
"Poured into a tulip glass, it pours a gold/dark straw color with a billowy white foamy head reminding me of clouds. Solid sustainance in the head. Aroma is of sour grapefruit and a bit of orange peel. A bit of coriander hits my nose as well, and a bit of pepper. A mild sweetness overall on the nose that blends well with a bitterness that is hard to describe. Sipping reveals in interesting blend of orange and grapefruit flavors as well as soem spice on the tip of my tongue to balance the sweetness. A bit of alcohol hits the sides of my tongue and the finish winds up with a grapefruit sweetness with some alcohol phenols sticking around. Medium bodied and solid brew. Not the best of the style, but solid. Glad I tried it!"
"This is the organically produced saison from Dupont. Pours a cloudy, golden color with a thick, fluffy head. Lots of lacing which makes this a good looking brew. Smell is very spicy, with lots of pepper aroma, somewhat of a bitter aftertaste to it, and a slight funk which is true to style. Taste followed smell, but thought it could use some more fruitiness to balance out the spiciness. Overall, a pretty decent brew."
"Do try this with strong cheese, because it is very complementary and you will like the beer particularly well thereafter. Just try to get beyond Mr. Pepe L'Pew at the start of your session. L'Chaim"
"11.2oz. bottle: This pours a darker golden color. There is a small white head on it, which tends to linger awhile. A lighter but nice aroma of spices, fruits and bread. A very good taste. It has a medium body, and I get notes of citrus and spiciness. Just a touch sweet with actually a note of sourness in the aftertaste. Another beer from Dupont worth having."
"Here is where it stops being a conscientious review and I get ugly. The beer has a flavor towards the end that I can only describe as ""off"". It has a respectable flavor to a point, but the finish is not enjoyable in my opinion. Maybe it is my knee jerk reaction to the ""organic"" ingredients, although I've had other organic brews that were quite tasty. I can't really get past this flavor so the review ends here. Its not going down the drain but I won't be seeking this out in the future. Please excuse the review as it will basically be a reminder for me to not buy again. Cheers."
"Good Quality Stuff!"
"Notes: Loved it! Not as dry as I would have liked but that is splitting hairs. Damn good offering and up there with some of my favorites. Drink this as fresh as possible as this ultra fresh offering is better than any I've had to date."
"Glad to finally get into my fourth offering from Dupont. Like its sisters, Foret is a looker - hazy blonde body with a huge frothy white, rocky head. She smells nice too. Flowery and spicey, with just a touch of that rough funk. Taste is along the lines of Dupont's other offerings, but is maybe a bit heavy in the peppery spice element. Noticably lesser than other Dupont beers in this category. Mouthfeel is also a bit off. Seems somewhat thin and sharp. Carbonation is damaging. Drinkability is hurt by this, but hurt even more by simple comparison with its sisters. Worth a try, and if this were the only Saison available to me, I'd drink it. But it's not."
"Poured from a 750ml corked and caged bottle. The cork had 2.006 on it which I'm assuming meant bottled in 2006 but not sure why the weird period. It had a hazy golden yellow color. I did a slow pour so not to unsettle the yeast so not a big head but a decent one for the pour. Also had a bunch of carb and a lot pop when opening. The smell was very weak and had a dryness to it. Didn't really excite me. The taste was also kinda off and had a very dry and bitter ending. Based on other reviews, I'm either just not getting it or have a bad sample. Overall, not real impressed with this one and hoping it's just a bad sample as I'm really into Saisons lately and this is one I could get fairly easily. For now, don't really recommend (3.5, RB, ML, O)"
"Dupont Foret on my 750 ml bottle priced at $8.99 from my local North Coast Coop here in Eureka, CA. Poured a hazy golden color with a fat white head and big chucks of lacing. Nose of hops, spices, and citrus. Mouthfeel kind of average, and taste is same as nose, only slightly sweet. Decent, slightly dry finish."
"An interesting and tasty blond ale from Moinette. Spicy and peppery with a huge fresh fruit character on the nose. I'd say this would be a great beer with food"
"Hadn't had this in quite some time and I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was- much better than I remembered. Pours a very hazy golden with not much head. Almost looks like a Hefeweizen its so cloudy. The smellis of beautiful Belgian yeast aromas of cloves and bubblegum. The taste is crisp and a little bitter up front from hops, followed by a deep flavor of bubblegum. Very balanced and delicious. The mouthfeel is a little light but still solid, and quite refreshing. Fairly high carbonation, but nothing out of the ordinary for the style. Very drinkable- I could drink this all day. Another plus is that this is an organic beer."
"good brew and i dig the organic aspect"
"Drinkability: Tasty and balanced with a nice bitterness."
"D: Very tasty saison. Do the organic ingredients have anything to do with that? Not sure, but this is definitely a great tasting brew, especially for the price."
"This is a nice, mellow saison. Cloudy straw-colored, pillowy white head. The nose is similar to the taste; dry, citric, some yeasty funk in the background. Much heavier on the malt than the hops. Sweetness comes out more as it warms up. Not the most complex saison out there, but very drinkable stuff - pretty light and easy on the palate, but still very flavorful."
"Muted spice, but some expected funk. A very good beer, not a great one. I'd buy it again, it's an enjoyable basic saison, but not inspiring."
"One note - i found this beer significantly improved with a little bit of time sitting out. it mellowed some of the astringent/sharp sensation i felt during some of the early drinking. Drinkability was high because of this."
"D - A good saison such as this is emminently drinkable. (Paired nicely with a teriyaki stirfry)."
"Poured out a hazy burnt amber color with thick foamy head, light lacing. The nose is strong and earthy, with a medicinal/herbal feature rounding out the citrus. The taste is sweet with honey upfront , hoppy and dry throughout, citrusy on the finish. The mouthfeel is somewhat crisp and dry, but not enough carbonation to make this really work."
"D- It is a good saison. I wouldn't say it's one of the best but if someone had it I would have it but I would go with the Saison Dupont over this if it were up to me. Has a few weird notes in the taste but overal pretty good."
"Poured from a 750 ml into a tulip glass. Big foamy head, very airy and light. The color is a cloudy, pale golden hue; just picture perfect. The aroma is peppery, spicy, hoppy, flowery and it really gets my taste buds watering. The taste is a little bitter upfront, only for a second and then the sweet wheated malt and malts break in! There is a pleasent sweetness to this brew. Their is a slight sour faded flavor that is quite nice. The body is medium. The brew is great, but one 750 ml is enough at one time. It's even better to share with a friend."
"Very pleasant beer, well worth giving a shot."
"Taking this for what it is, without expectation, it's very good and i really enjoy it. A milder saison is a welcome change of pace."
"I thought the aroma was a bit 'funky' with all the yeast and found this to be a beer best sipped slowly. Other than that it's a very tasty brew."
"I'd love to try this in a fresher condition, it has hints of delicacy that cannot be perceived in this condition."
"This beer poured a cloudy golden color with a thick and foamy head. The aroma was full of grains and flowers. The taste was slightly sweet and fruity. teh finish was smooth and contained a slight alcohol bite. overally this was a light and reasonably nice refreshing beer."
"Drinkability is good a nice example of a saison, fruity, funky and spicey. Recommended."
"Foret pours tremendously foamy from a brown 33cl bottle. The beer is a hazy golden in color and the enormous head is white. I like the aroma a lot, it is almost floral with a light citrus touch. It takes a long time for the head to die down. I like the smell better than the taste. It has some qualities that I don't particularly like, a plastic like taste is noticeable at some points. It's not bad, just not outstanding. Definitely worth a try."
"750 ml bottle. Injet information was at the bottom of the front label, but it was not legible. 2005 on cork."
"Overall, an easily drinkable, flavorful Saison ale that nears perfection."
"Ever had Saison Dupont? This tastes very similiar (now I see that it is from the same brewery so that makes sense.) Some sweet malt, lots of pepper and spice. Banana flavors still evident in the taste. Quite dry, lots of pepper in the finish and aftertaste. Really tasty. If I wasn't there for a beer tasting, I could have stuck with this all night. This goes to the top of my saison list."
"Foret is French for forest, which should be easy to figure out due to the bucolic scene depicted on the label. It's too bad that this lively little Belgian ale doesn't come in 750 ml bottles like just about every other saison in existence (or if it does, it's too bad that I ended up with this puny 11.2 ouncer) because it's a corker of a beer that disappeared waaay too quickly."
"To the extent that my heart is warmed by the organic nature of the beers: Cheers to a solid saison."
"Still, it tasted pretty good and I think it would match well with pork chops or a bbq'd ham and a healthy side of greens and corn bread."
"I'm going to have to try some more saisons and come back to this one to truly understand what my senses are going through right now and whether it's more characteristic of the style or this particular brew. In fact, after this experience, the Saison Dupont I despised so much on my first tasting now clearly deserves a second chance."
"Drinks pretty good, about average as far a saisons go, Goes down too easy during this colorado hail storm! A good effort, but a tad over priced $9.50 for 750ML bottle IMO"
"Pours a brilliant brass color with a fluffy white head, tiny bubbles rushing through the body, and ornate lacing. Smell is of light spices and yeast with a grainy malt body. Grassy hops really stand out as well as some candied fruit. Flavor is really light with an emphasis on some faint sweetness and some grainy character. Some light spicy and fruity yeastiness is there, as well as some really earthy hops and a solid finishing bitterness. Mouthfeel is moderate with a certain fluffiness to it. Bubbles are really active. Leaves the mouth just a little sticky. This is a good beer, but I'm just not that compelled to drink more and more."
"Overall: I feel that this is too sweet and not as refreshing as other saisons that I have had. Not bad by any means."
"D: Definately a warm weather beer. Not bad. Jasmine flavors reminds me of summer."
"750 ml bottle served in a nice Rodenbach tulip glass, enjoyed on my back deck on a nice Friday evening...priceless. The beer poured a hazy, amber to brown color with a thick crisp, creamy white head with active bubbles, calling my name to drink them. The aroma is Beglian yeast, very earthy. The taste is a bit bitter but also has a nice sweet character with a good body of carbonation. I imagine this would go very well with Japanese food but I had it this night with grilled chicken and shrimp and it was a very good match."
"Overall: Tasty stuff, at least fresh from the Brewery. Listed at a lower strength than the Moinette Blond and Brune and a different brewed beer in its own right. Distinctly Dupont, sort of a Spicy Hop laden Triple-Saison. It seems like it is hard to find, but well worth trying if you get the chance to drop on a bottle or two. Wish I had more."
"750 ml bottle, no date evident, poured into a tulip, pours a hazy glowing apricot with a mammoth three finger off-white head which lingers for a long time, at least 5 minutes until it's subsided enough for a sip. Which isn't all bad, since the aroma is enough to enjoy on it's own, a pleasant earthy, yeasty, slightly spicey background, infused with all sorts of fruits, from mango to coconut to lemon to strawberry--it's wonderful and complex and slightly different with every whiff. Taste is absolutely brimming with that same fruitiness, a great light banquet of orange, melon, banana, berry, coconut--a slight bit of honey sweetness all giving way to a big clove and pepper spiceyness. Finishes with a lingering fruity yeast, making you want to come back for more. Medium bodied with a smooth and absolutely creamy feel, this is so easy to drink. I love the original Saison Du Pont, but this organic beer is absolutely superb, and I will definitely have to do a side by side tasting in the future."
"D - high, great to pound, well bodied"
"Pours out a cloudy orange-amber color with a substantial, compact & lasting head. Nose is a dusty, sawdust-like grassy hop aroma with light fruitiness. Lots of wheat at first taste, with substantial hoppiness and a yeasty clove flavor lurking around in the background. Finishes delightfully tart and dry. Medium body with a neutral but well-carbonated texture."
"Pours a light golden color with a 3 finger chynky and fluffy head. Clarity is moderate with a nuce fine carbonation bubbling up. Nose is interesting. I'm getting a lot of earthy mustyness, with lemony citrus, light orange rind, and a spicey yeast character. Initially, there was a solid hallertau hop character, but this fades and is more subtle after the beer breaths a bit. Flavor is pretty nice. Good sharp lemony sour is dominant initially, moving towards a mustyness with good orange rind, finishing with a solid blast of hallertau hop that is very herbal and lingers just long enough. I think this is a tasty brew. Mouthfeel is a light-moderate with a moderate carbonation. A good balance all together. This one works well for me. I like the hop profile on this one. The mustyness and sour tang are just enough to balance out the nice fruity and spicey notes. I'd have this one around all summer if I could afford it."
"Overall quite tasty."
"Light peach. The aroma is fairly subtle but perfect for a saison in my opinion. Its very fruity, spicy and highlights fragrances of cantaloupe, bubble gum, peach, caramel and clove. A bready, caramel like maltiness is evident as well. Ill be the first one to admit that I am a huge saison freak, but this one is especially characterful. I love Duponts yeast which is why I am currently having a love affair with Blaugies as well. The bittering hops play a profound role in the flavor along with the slightly tart and ripe fruitiness and notes of cinnamon, orange, nutmeg, clove, toffee and caramel. A lovely saison."
"Big off-white head sits atop a hazy yellow body. The aroma is slightly skunky and slightly funky, followed by insense and herbs. Herbs and spices combine with evergreen elements and some more of that skunk. It would be out of place in another beer perhaps, but hey this is Saison. And like the others, this offers its own nuances and pleasures."
"It poured a bright golden color, with a thick white head that stuck around for a very long time. It also had a white bubbly lace around the glass. This beer was extremely carbonated. The beer had a wonderful fruitful taste that hit the tongue first. It fallowed with light hops, and a slightly bitter peppery(?) finish. It was very wonderful beer. The cork popped like a champagne, and was very enjoyable. Highly recommended....organic too!"
"Taste; starts off a bit grassy with a little sweet honey, and then the lemony citrus flavors come out some. As this beer gets warmer it becomes slightly sweeter. That barnyard funk comes out more in the finish, along with a good peppery spiciness that I really like. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice crisp carbonation."
"Having many less than satisfactory experiences with 'Organic' beers, I'm very happy to report that this is a Saison that will not disappoint provided it has had the proper time toage."
"I just love saison. I could drink this stuff forever. This one is right there with the best of them. It's citrusy, spicy, and delicious."
"It's a very creamy middle and a firm ending. This is a complete beer, very drinkable in spite of its high alcohol."
"Drinkability: Lack of sweet balance makes it slightly less drinkable but hard to take points away as this is right on the money for a Saison Ale. Give it some time and the flavor starts to round itself out nicely."
"The color is a hazy orange with a nice level of carbonation. Head is large and off-white. Lemon zest is first noted in the aroma. A deeper inhale reveals a yeasty clove aroma mixed with spices. Taste features a big citrus flavor, a lemony-orange combo, very acidic. Spice flavor is high and works well with the citrussy aspects of this beer. Sweetness is underlying and is joined by yeasty flavors in the finish. As Foret warms up the yeast flavors become stronger and clove flavor stands out. Mouthfeel is crisp and slightly puckering. Drinkability is high."
"Oh yeah, and be careful with the yeast. Normally I just dump the yeast in with my last glass. Not recommended in this case, the flavours are too delicate. Keep it pure, it is beautiful as it is."
" I guess the key phrase with this beer is ""yeah it's alright, but i've had some better saisons."""
"Classy, lively, simple yet refined. Bring it on...and enjoy out of a wine glass."
"Flavor has some cooked banana. some sour, and a little pepper."
"The drinkability of this beer is quite good since it is so mellow and refreshing."
"This is a fine beer and there is nothing wrong with it. I rather enjoyed it. But reallythere is no reason or me to buy this one at twice the price of the Hennepin when that Saison is so much better."
"I think this is a sweet beer. Nor per say a saison but they could be anywhere on the spectrum. A light body and carbonation. Overall it was a good sweeter beer."
"Drinkability is also good but there are better. Not a bad Saison but Hennepin and Dupont are better versions. Sort of pricey at $9 for the bottle. For a beer just to drink I suggest you take your $9 and buy two bottles of Hennepin instead."
"If you can find this one I would recommend getting it."
"The overall flavor is big and married nicely. In fact, I was able to enjoy Foret before, during, and after a good meal. I also like the fact that Brasserie Dupont put such emphasis on organic and natural ingredients in crafting this fine beer. I'll be buying more."
"Opinion: I am one that will try anything from DuPont at least three times before making a judgment. These beers are so complex that you can't make an opinion up from just one tasting. I think that I like their Moinette Blond a bit better than this one, but this is still a fabulous beer."
"Perhaps a touch more earthy than Saison Dupont. Similarly light and pleasing, but not the same degree of complexity."
"Definite hops present on the palate. A tad tinny aftertaste and even a bit dry."
"Mouthfeel was light. This would be a perfect late summer brew. As it was 90 degrees last night out on the deck, it was just short of perfect. Finished spicey. Weirdly enough, we were watching a movie afterward, and I could have sworn that the beer left a smokey/ashey flavor in my mouth...I never know what to expect with the saison brews. Worthy of having another."
"Pours a perfectly clear gold, and with a whole lot of carbonation and head. Lacey strings are all over the glass. Noce is hops and spices. The alcohol is not very well hidden behind the flavor and is very much up and in your face. The alcohol is trying to hide behind cinnamon and pepper flavors, but is too big. The hops also have a pretty good bittering kick. Mouthfeel is more of the heavy carbonation. However, all in all it is still very easy to drink this beer because the spie flavors are quite good."
"A pretty decent saison, but not my favorite. Needs a bit of toning down in some areas."
"Pretty nice saison, sort of a bigger more astringent earthy version of saison dupont. Not as fruity as saison dupont, but overall a really nice beer."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"The mouthfeel is a bit thick and smooth. Finishes moderately dry. This would be much more drinkable if it didn't taste like I was licking a horse with each drink. The late-finish is quite sweet like Saison Dupont, as is the initial taste, but every part in between seems a bit too funky to be too highly drinkable."
"Drinkable, to be sure, but cost prohibitive. Maybe I just don't like the style? If I'm gonna pay that much I'll stick with Chimay."
"Body is medium dense with a crisp, yet airy texture accented by rolling carbonation. Crisp and dry, yet fruity and full. Very excellent beer."
"Another nice Saison from DuPont, this lived up to my expectations. Sitting in my 80 degree house with humidity nearing 70% and it's almost 10 in the evening, you can be assured this helped to ease the pain."
"Not really impressed with this ale. When poured, the color was of a hazy wheat and foam was of a medium tight nature with very little lace. The smell of spice with a hint of fruit filled the nose. The taste was mostly of spice, especially corriander. Drank it was it was 40 degress and 50 degress. When a little warmer, the flavor seem to be of a fruity taste, of orange blossom's. But for me, it was just average all around."
"Drinkability- I've put off buying a bottle of this because all I've seen in the past was the 750ml bottles for $8.99 and upwards. Plus I have heard things to make me believe that this bottle was not worth paying the price and lacks the presence of better saisons. Well, I can see where they come from as this tasted a bit more like a wit to me, and it doesn't compare to Fantome Saison, which is my favorite saison to date, but overall it's pretty damn tasty and wouldn't mind snagging a few of these bad boys and putting them away for those nice summer family picnics or something. Tasty and fullfilling."
"Drinkability: As I drink this, I can't help but imagine a mellow, breezy afternoon picnic in the hills overlooking the Pacific, the sun giving the oaks and grass a golden glow, so nice... so nice... Uh, oh, very drinkable, and a decent deal to boot. Good stuff."
"very enjoyable, and had the desireable yeast and carbonation characteristics of the other Duponts I have had. Refreshing and lasting peppery aftertaste. Somewhat sweet fruity and acidic, with a spiciness. Pours actively carbonated and significant yeast before settling. Amber."
"Cork reads ""2004."" About half a dozen streamers of carbonation weave through this matte bronze liquid with dank goldenrod highlights. The off-white head is tight and controlled, consisting of bubbles that range in size from merely small to truly microscopic. The lacing isn't particularly impressive, though. Aromas are okay, suggesting an earthy blend of white bread dough and peach baby food with a finish of lemon pudding (?), but calling them subtle is a big understatement. So how is it that fir-tree hoppiness is slamming the back of my nose? Yeast is tangible in the nosefeel. Flavors involve twiggy, tarragon-like bitterness; citric peel and capers; but the palate itself seems remarkably subdued. Mouthfeel is carbonated to the point of being foamy. Neither as spicy as DuPont nor as quenching as Hennepin. I appreciate the thinking behind this organic brew, but the end result just isn't spirited enough to hold my interest."
"Drinkability and Overall: Not a bad Saison, but no Saison Dupont. It's not as drinkable as other saisons, but i could still enjoy this one for a while."
"cloudy and orangey-yellow with a few bubbles seen rising up to a nice creamy froth of foamy head in a thick layering with some medium sized bubbles. Nicely cellard scents, malty and yeasty. Silky with a bit of bite at the end from the carbonation. Perfect amount of carbonation. Wonderfully dry. Great flavors. Bit of chardonnay, touch of red apple skin and grape skin. Just such great flavor and feel."
":)"
"After having a glass by itself, I paired Foret up with some Fontina cheese, green grapes, and sea salt crackers. It was outstanding! Foret has an easy drinkability thanks to the plethora of flavors and the well-concealed alcohol content. Another stand-out offering from Brasserie Dupont."
"Presentation: Packaged in a 330 ml Euro-style brown glass longneck with a poptop crown. Served in a chalice glass."
"Hazy, peachy gold in hue, when backlit the liquid is magnificent, it is like a sunset in a glass. The head was white in color; at the apex the foam was two fingers in height. The rocky mass of bubbles had great staying power, in fact a thin cap lasted the entire consumption. There was some subsequent lacing, it was spotty and unorganized, on top of that it didnt cling all that well. Still, on the whole, this beer looks very appealing. Eye-candy. The nose is terrific. There is a tremendous rounded quality about the bouquet that I adore. The fruitiness is heavy on melons like honeydew and cantaloupe. I even find kisses of berries, apple cider, and oranges. In the mix is a good amount of natural smelling honey. Coriander. Juicy. Up to this point the aromas are very appealing and lovely to sniff. However there is nothing strong or funky about the nose. At the end that changes for the better! At the back is a healthy does of phenols. Cloves. Medical aromas. Herbal. Yeasty funk like I am allergic to hay and mold while sitting in an abandon barn that once was home to broncos. Did I mention I was at this barn in the middle of the summer? Hell Yeah! The potency is moderate but it is very articulate. I like what it is saying. It says, Drink me! It is about time I do. The palate is interesting. In parts it is raw and aggressive and in other parts it is weak and fragile. Does that mean there is balance? Im not sure. The weaker flavors are louder and the stronger flavors are secondary. It is hard to explain that the dominant flavors cant outshine the secondary tastes. Odd. So what am I talking about? The fruity sensations like orange, cantaloupe, and apples are unimpressively tasty. They offer something to sink my teeth into but it is far from memorable. Unfortunately this is the strongest taste. I really like the raw honey flavor in the middle. This is followed by a blast of pepper, coriander, grass, and some bubblegum. Funky. There are medicinal qualities at the finish with kisses of alcoholic heat. The finish is fairly forceful but it fails to outshine the fruitiness. How odd! The aftertaste is a little bit of everything I mentioned above. At this point it is a little sweet. How interesting Ive gone this far in the review without using the words hops or malt. Maybe this beer doesnt have any! Im joking. Or am I. No really, Im joking. I like this beers flavor profile. Medium in body with fairly lively carbonation, the mouthfeel is very fitting for this beer. It is active yet lazy, it is assertive but restrained. It is crazy. It is odd. It is wacky just like the palate. It is a match made in heaven. Overall this Saison is a bit mellow but it is far from boring. I really liked this beer. Give me a hand of grapes and some mild cheddar cheese and I am one happy SOB! I purchased this beer in Minnesota, MN and left it in the cellar because, well, I forgot it was there. What a dope. Whatever, this beer is very good and I think I can get more in Iowa City (maybe Kansas City); regardless I will get more. I am a sucker for Saisons and this beer is a good rendition."
"Nose is medicinal candied fruit, coriander, light earthy barnyard grass, citrus (orange?), and yeast. Taste starts off with lucious, candy-infused fruits (canned pears, pineapple, bananas). Smooth, and not overly sweet. Spice (coriander, orange/citrus zest), along with a slight grassy bitterness kicks in. Bitterness picks up into the finish. Very nice. Lively, carbonated mouthfeel with a medium body. Enjoyed this with some kumquat-glazed chicken and wild rice. Yummy."
"all in all a nice beer and a good match with my chicken stuffed with goat cheese. I would think it would also be good with shellfish and other seafood."
"Pours to a hazy golden color with a creamy white head that leave a nice amount of lacing. The aroma is yeasty, grassy, and a bit spicy. There is a bit of citrus fruits and pepper in the aroma as well. The flavor is peppery and yeasty with a bit of malt. The flavor is just not up there with the aroma. It is medium bodied and smooth drinking. It has a drying finish. Not too bad."
"glad to have tried this once, i doubt i would have it again."
"The addition of some of the yeast from the bottom of the bottle really mellowed out the flavor and brought this beer from a 3.0 to a 3.5 in the taste catagory. It gained some spiciness and yeast flavors, as well as provided a little more depth. It also knocked down the alcohol flavor which I found to be distracting without the yeast."
"Hazy light amber body with a sizeable and lasting head. Theres a lot of dried stone fruit in the aroma along with a hint of citrus. The flavor has the same fruit profile with something a little softer (pear maybe?). Toward the end you get a bit of dry hay malt despite the fact the rest of the beer is mildly sweet."
"($6.99 / 25.4 oz / 750ml corked and caged champagne style bottle)"
"Deeee-licious! Once I discovered that Hennepin (which I really like)is a Saison, I decided to try more of the style. I found the Dupont and the Foret on a beer run this weekend. My wife and I split the Foret tonight, and we both loved it. Clean, crisp, and tangy. Pours with a medium sized, fizzy head. Citrus notes, reasonably carbonated, but not too much so. Has a similar tartness to Duvel (in a way), which is my favorite. At least as good as the Hennepin, IMO. Great aroma leaps from the bottle, taste is just as good. I have the Dupont in the beer fridge. Can't wait to try it!"
"The flavor is crisp with citrusy notes. Other flavors include cinnamon, and orange blossom. It sits very much like a Belgian trippel in the mouth. Very light and fluffy with well balanced carbonation. The only downfall to this bottle was the bittery skunky ending. I would have to chalk it up to poor storage and being light struck."
"Taste: A strange mix of anis and orange, with light carbonation and decent mouthfeel. A very good saison that I'll definately try again."
"A tart, earthy farmhouse ale. Real nice, real nice indeed."
"Drinkabilty--Quite dangerous at 7.5%- very easy to have 4 or more of these especially with food and I beleive Foret would be extremely versatile in pairing with quite a variety of different foods."
"Bottle, thanks to mat. Yeah, not bad, spicy, sour, yeasty and lemony.. No real problem with it, i guess it suffred from the competition it was up against that night, but not a bad beer by any stretch, some spicy, peppery, yeasty flavours throughout, not bad at all."
"748"
"large bottle, with cork and cage. Pours cloudy orangy amber, lifting a massive white head. Good retention, dissolving to a tiny bubble film. Leaves much well scattered lacing. Nose of spice, yeast, corriander. Soft mouthfeel. A hint of a mettalic note. Otherwise typical saison flavors of pepper, must, earthyness and a nice dry finish. Love this style, but this take on it is just so so. Still worth trying and enjoying with BBQ, and summer fare."
"Overall Impression: Nice drinkability and I can see the refreshing qualities and can admire the mostly hidden alcohol. I was hoping for a more complex flavor, something really unique to help me identify saison in the future. All I got now is wit  coriander. Went well with my summer salad, a good thirst quencher."
"Poured a clear golden amber with a frothy white head that receded somewhat quickly to a thin layer of bubbles on the surface of the beer. The smell was of damp musty hay, hint of grassy hops, sweet malt, and a pleasant fruitiness. This beer is quite full-bodied with lots of residual sweetness balanced by a pleasant bitterness from the hops. A hint of mild spiciness from the yeast rounds out the flavor very nicely. Very tasty. I will buy more of this, and hopefully get fresher bottles - though, if they are even better than this package store methusala, I'll be beside myself!"
"Hazy and sedimented, color of darker pineapple juice in hue. Nice head, rising to an inch and generally creamy. Attractive lace on the glass. Slight farm aroma, notes of slightly spoiled wine and tart peach. Light and spritzy mouthfeel as most of the style. Lightly lemony and leathery in overall flavor with an impressive mid mouth bittering starting to seep in. The end note is diminished, a combination of very dry hopping and a very soft rounding down of the carbonation. Dry but subtle in the aftertaste. Maybe slightly more ""blurred"" than other Saisons but maybe more drinkable as well, without losing the hoppy hallmark that's usually typical."
"The beer pours a cloudy pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice pale malt scent with a banana/ clove aroma and a fruity Belgian yeast finish. The taste is good. It has a spicey pale malt flavor with a bit of pepper undertones and a slight hop character. It goes down smooth and finishes with a fruity Belgian yeast aftertaste. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium bodied beer with a little too much carbonation. This is a fine saison. It is true to style and full of spicey flavor."
"I got a little tired of this by the end as it didn't seem to evolve much from the start and I would order a different saison (Moinette for sure) if I was having another saison."
"Drinks a little to easily considering the 7.5%, it could sneak up on you. A good, although relatively simple beer."
"Loud pop of the cork. Pours a cloudy golden color. A thick rocky white head forms on top. I notice quite a bit of sediment floating about in my glass. Aroma has citrusy, grassy notes to it. The taste reveals some the slight hop taste, earthy tones and lemony tartness as expected from a saison. I do detect some spice, perhaps some peppery flavors. This is a smooth and refreshing example of the style. A very good beer."
"The head is dense, creamy-white with a remarkable flat top. Foam caves in slowly. There are gobs of thick lacing: walls of foam. The beer's color is a hazy orange-gold. Nice. Intense spiciness in the buttery, fruity, orangey nose. Tangy fruit in the front... is that banana? Thick butter in the middle leads to an extremely bitter finish showing light nuts and pepper. Aftertaste is a little soapy. That bitter finish tames some as you go, leaving a good, strong, spicy beer."
"Drinkability is pretty good. Very light and one dimensional but highly refreshing."
"Pours brilliantly clear, and a full gold color. The beer is topped by a thick cream colored head that is produced by an incredible amount of carbonation. Aromas of grain and a floral characteristic reminiscent of a field of blooming weeds (both soft and sharp floral aromatics competing for attention). The taste is light and refreshing, with perhaps a hint of acidity in the finish. The ample carbonation prickles my tongue. There is a light grainy sweetness up front, but the finish is quite dry. Quite nice, with a good amount of character derived from the yeast. I get notes of pepper, grass, tropical fruit, pineapple, clove, and a herbal character. This is quite nice, light and refreshing with enough complexity to keep me interested in each sip."
"Pours a hazy golden orange color with a rocky off-white head. Very good head retention and excellent lacing. Sweet aroma of honey and malt with subtle spiciness in the backround. Taste was not as sweet as the nose, the malt is nicely balanced by a sharp, but not overpowering hop flavor. Some spice and earthy notes are also present, and the alcohol peeks through just a bit. Light on the tounge and very smooth. Quite drinkable but it seems like something was missing, pretty good though. After trying this one, I see more Saisons in my future."
"Pours a hazed burnt orange with a massive noisey white head. The aroma consists of a light lemon twang with yeast, and spices. The taste is that of sweet fruit, spices from light hops, and finishes in the middle of dry and sweet. The body is light to medium and drinks down fairly easy for a beverage with this ABV. This would pair well with certain meals. Op uw gezonheid!"
"330ml bottle. Poured a golden orange with a thick fluffy head that settled down to a thin dense and creamy layer of foam. Aroma is spicy with notes of vanilla ,apple and a bit of clove. Yeast is also noticable and adding to what is already a quite complex aroma. Some funky sour fruit in there also. This one is all over the map. Body is medium and very smooth. Flavor is fruity with a bit of apple and spices in the mix. Yeast adds a bit of complexity to the overall flavor."
"2.002 on cork. Yeast cake/chunks of yeast adorn the side(?) of the bottle. Yeasty orangy gold with huge white head and fast-rising champagne-like bubbles. Nice thick layering afterwards. Nice yeasty/spicy aroma with sweet honeyed malts and earthy/musty hops. Flavor and mouthfeel just don't hold up to what I would expect from Dupont. There's the earthy hopiness up front, a little sweet, orangy(?) maltiness in the middle and a little musty skankiness at the end. Overall finishes kind of thin. Nearing the end of this 750, I'm feeling kinda parched. Wasn't a saison first created to quench the thirst of farmhands? Whatever. I'm enjoying this beer but it's not one of my favorite saisons."
"Pours a hazed slightly orange amber with a huge white head. Tastes sharp and spicey. Flavor is complex, but centered on the spicey bite. Mouthfeel is well rounded leading this to be an easy drinking Belgian. So glad to see organic beers in the market."
"2001 Edition, 750ml bottle. The pour reveals a coudy golden/yellow body, topped by a tight, whipped cream like head of pure, white foam. Aromas are subtle, yet complex and amazing. Honey (honeysuckle), various spices (pepper), fresh apples, citrus fruits, and sugar all come to mind. The taste is excellent as well. Light, fruity, peppery, and sweet (like honey). This brew does not dissapoint. The mouthfeel is light and lively, and the drinkability level of this ale is pretty damn magnificent. Geez, can this brewery turn out a bad beer? The Dupont family truly know how to craft a fine ale. This is just one more in their already magnificent portfolio."
"The high acidity makes this beer relatively light on the palate and a joy to drink."
"~12 celsius, trappist glass First, this is one of the numerous incredible top belgians sent to me by Tampa's rock'a Matt'a. Trust me Matt, they're all drunk in adequate ceremonies! / Dupont Forêt (which wears a pretty curious label...) spreads a dark golden hue, cloudy with an extremely complex aroma to die for. No exageration: I probably spent 30+ minutes sniffing it all in all in the ~45 minutes it took to drink the glass. Basically, it smells very sweet with plenty of little hard to spot characteristics among which stood out the meringue on top my my mother's lemon pie. Very complex and great sniffing as I said, yeasty with notes of vanilla, lichen? pencil shavings woodiness. I had not really thought much about fruit character until the first sip in which I discern peaches and frivolous acid green apples. It's grassy, sweet, woody (foret=forest) with a balancing mild/restrained bitterness in the finish paired with a light astringency. Body is very onctuous, sensual. Sensational, approaching the terrific Beatrix which I loved."
"This beer poured a cloudy lemon/yellow/gold color that when held to the light was well carbonated. The head that was formed was super fluffy, white in color, and the consistency was sticky and dense, and it lasted for the whole glass, only falling a little. Great lace, sticky as the foam that it comes from, it was in thick sheet form to very delicate sheets and lace. The aromas were of ripened fruits (apples pears), some fresh hops, wheat and its grains, some malt. Over all impression was earthy for the most. The tastes started off sweet, malts, fruits (apples, pears), wheat grains and a hint of a lemon rind in the middle and as it started to finish the hops, earth tones yeast and a tad of alcohol became present finished off with the prominent dry earthiness. The after taste was lite, wheat and hops. The body was light. Over all impression was earthy, wheaty, and organic. A simple beer but it can stand on its own very well. This was my first organic beer, and I must say that I rather enjoyed it and will try again."
"paid $5.99 for a 750ml"
"Overall Impression: I'm a huge fan of Br. Dupont and, as such, I would have liked to rate this beer higher, but this one was a bit disappointing. Not because it's bad, it just doesn't quite agree with me. But perhaps this eency-weency 25cl bottle of it just doesn't give much chance to taste it!"
"Although I sampled a long-stored and refrigerated bottle, the carbonation immediately brought up the yeast sediment and it poured a very hazy gold with an orange cast and billowing swirls of effervescent bubbles beneath a huge head of rocky off-white foam. The head retention was more than impressive (it held a small cap throughout the entire glass) and it left some excellent lacing (beautiful jagged rings and walls). Its candyish nose was quite welcoming, but a bit deceptive as the flavor was actually much less sweet, balanced by a bold hop bitterness and flavor. The mouthfeel was light and airy, and quite smooth with just a gentle caress on the tongue considering its zesty effervescence. In the flavor, some candyish and honey-like malt was over-shadowed by a brisk bitterness, leafy hop flavor, and a slap of spice. It finished dry with a mild, grainy-sweet note, a touch of light phenolic (plastic/smoke), and a lingering delicate spiciness."
"Drinkability  This went down slow. Its light, of course, but dull and overly spiced."
"Pours a cloudy orange with a big, dense white head. Nice looking beer. Some farmhouse/horse blanket aromas with sour yeast and fruity esters. Not especially impressive. As for the flavors, a doughy malt and yeast combination dominates along with a good deal of fruitiness, mostly apricot and plum. Hops show up on the edges of the tongue. There's just a little barnyard in there. Plum-skin bitterness hits in the dry finish and coats the mouth in the aftertaste. Smooth in the front, but a bit sharp in the back. Not a bad saison, but not the best. Still very drinkable and enjoyable."
"The beer pours a quite sibylline orange color with the head unpresumptuous in size, the texture creamy and the color a bright white. The lace formed is a quite Chumpy and melds well with the glass. Nose is a bit vinous, with malt undertones, crisp and citrus fresh, quite appealing to the eyes and the schnozzle with the start thickly malt and slightly sweet with the top slender in its feel to the palate. Finish is tart, strikingly acidic, hops are present but understated, tart and dry lingering aftertaste, and Saisons have become a new favorite style, a quite quaffable brew."
"Medium orange color. Large head. Aroma is malty, earthy, musty and citrusy. Very complex. A medium bodied saisson. Malts are bready, cookie dough, fruity and spicy. High bret, I bet. Barnyardish. Big, bright Belgian yeasts. Fruity, peaches and bananas. Mildly spicy. Very tasty. Smooth. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and dry. Aftertaste is slightly spicy."
"Pours an orangish yellow color with a nice sized head that dissipates slowly. Aroma of hoppy fruit and spices. Taste shows me some floral hops that control the flow of flavors. Other flavors are earthy grain malts and peppery spices. Finishes with a hop kick and some more spice which seems to be cardamom this time. This is a well crafted brew, esp. for an organic, but the style just doesn't seem that great to me."
"This is a good beer that falls shy of greatness. I love saisons and Flemish golden ales and Biere-de-gardes and farmhouse ales and so on, but this is an average in that category. Still above average as a beer all around I guess. I never loved Saison Dupont and that's a world class brew; this is not but has the added appeal of being organic. Opaque peachy golden with lots of bubbles, little lasting head. Aroma of yeast, spice, and fruit. A fair amount of Euro-skunkiness from the green bottle that lingered, even in aftertaste. The malt profile is very soft, buttery, weiss-like, but the hops kick in quite sharply and set off the equally prickly yeast. Finish is spicy, peppery, cleansing. Went very nicely with a sharp irish cheese but did not advance to the next stage of transcendence. I'll drink this again, sure, but I'm not giving it a whole hearted recommendation."
"Again, though, I found myself wishing that an ""organic"" beer would mean one that really tasted fantastic, not just pretty good."
"The taste was more or less what I expected, and it's a little weak up front -- not quite as great as some other Belgians. But it's still quite good and pretty drinkable."
"Notes: A simple beer, I expected a bit more. Rough around the edges showing some withdrawn complexities. There are other Saisons out there that are better."
"Glowing clouded orange 'neath a fat clingy bonnet. Stunning bouquet of lemon, honey tea with a side of butter cookies and petting zoo. Alternating attack of sweet and bitter turns lime pith peppered by the kitchen spice cupboard. Easy, fluid and full through the pipes."
"Really liked the nice golden color of this ale,with nice big rocky head that left nice lace.Very fresh and citruisy smel with a little yeast in the background.Fresh taste with some hoppiness to it,thirst quenching and very easy to drink.I do believe this is a organic ale wich makes it even better."
"Pours a cloudy pale orange, and immediately fizzes up owing to the tremendous carbonation. Forms a nice thick 1"" white head with a meringue like peak that leaves brussels lace hanging in sheets with every sip. Aroma is that of Wyeast 3068 Weihenstephan Weizen yeast, with notes of cloves, phenol and cedar. No aroma hops are discernable. Taste has a little bit of lambic character in it; that of slight tartness and sourness, with some top notes of grain, and a fizzy, but crisp mouthfeel. Initial sweetness gives way to yeasty bread, mild bittering hops, and alcohol warmth. VERY drinkable in spite of it's 7.5% abv."
"Looks very nice in the glass - a golden orange color with a chill haze. Smells of candi sugar. A bit on the dry side. The very high carbonation is evident with a fizzy, light mouthfeel. A little bit of biting alcohol present but still maintains a fairly light presence. Some very rounded out hops."
"Replays of this melee will be shown again and again, as the drinkability never seems to decrease."
"Cloudy golden appearance. Good sized dense white head tops it off. Spicy. Earthy. Musty. Yeasty. That would be the nose. Very lovely. Pretty carbonated mouthfeel. Not overdone though. Body is about medium full. The taste is bready and spicy. Peppery. There's a nice little bitter hop kick as well. Pretty nice saison here. This is a style I'm really developing a liking for."
"Pours a hazy golden color with a thick and rocky white head. Nose is fruity and floral with a strong spiciness. Fresh fruit and ripe banana come though in the taste up front with notes of a bread-like sweetness to follow. There is also a bit of a citrus and peppery kick to it. Its quite smooth and refreshing. This is a great beer."
"Darker golden in hue, topped by a thick, creamy and well retained head that leaves sticky Belgian lace.  Smooth clove phenols hit the nose upfront, then are ensued by mellow breadiness, hints of tart fruit and pleasant peppery alcohol spice.  Biscuity sweetness upfront yields to notes of honey, more clove and black licorice. Darts of black pepper are perceptible mid palate w/ a moderate, and clean hop bitterness that nearly perfectly offsets residual sweetness.  Relatively full bodied for a saison, w/ a highly agreeably smooth mouthfeel. Finishes with lightly caramelized sugar and faint fruitiness lingering.  Foret is not nearly as fruity as other Saisons (it's not a Belgian pale as noted), but possesses a deliciously smooth clove and bread character.  Hop bitterness is above the norm, yet doesn't step on the smooth yeast flavor contributions.  An absolute pleasure to drink."
