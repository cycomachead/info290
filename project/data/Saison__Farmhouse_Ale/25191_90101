4.06,-3.1,4,4.25,4,4,4,"Foggy golden yellow, topped by a small, beautifully creamy white head.  Deeply funky, somewhat acetic aromas featuring musty earth, barnyard, damp hay, oak, and grape.  Flavor is equally funky, but with a larger tart lemon note through the middle, grapes, and grapefruit.  Some wheaty grain and grassy freshness, but mostly bright citrus acidity and funk.  Medium-light with some pretty serious pucker, leaving the gum line dry.  Very nice.  Not exactly something I would consider within the realm of Saison, but good nevertheless.","wedge","Feb 01, 2015"

Borderline divine beer.  So good.  So worth the price.  So worth the drive I'm going to take on Wednesday to get as many as I can get my hands on.

The Brett presence is moderate but impactful as it complements all the other elements present.  Not the best Brett beer I've ever had but it's certainly in the top ten.

Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is an extremely bright, slightly hazed, straw-gold coloring, with a filmy, wispy, white surface coating of head. Aromas of lemon, apple, honey, and an herbal blend of clove, lemon grass, all spice, and coriander, all on a biscuit backbone, with subtle tart and sour highlights throughout. Flavors are tart and sour forward, with white grape and lemon blending for the sweet characteristics. Spiced wood highlights, with subtle farmhouse funk, cut grass, and earthy notes. Very light and refreshing in mouth, with a tart and sour aftertaste of citrus and white wine notes. Crisp, tart, dry finish. Amazingly well balanced, well crafted beer.","GarthDanielson","Nov 07, 2014"

Head retention and lacing are both good enough.  Aroma is nice, the brew smells like citrus peel, bready/grainy malt, oak, hay, green grapes, and some pear.  I think the taste pretty much follows the aroma, but there's also some tropical fruit and funky/mustiness noticeable.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's easy to drink and has a moderate amount of carbonation.  It's a good tart, fruity and funky brew!  I've enjoyed the few Crooked Stave brews I've had a chance to try so far, and I'll have to make a point to try more in the future!  $8.99 a bottle.","bluejacket74","Oct 03, 2014"

Smell was kinda tart and lemony, with a bit of that barnyard funk and some slight sour apple. The taste is pretty sour up front, but then I get some grassy, wheat type flavors. The finish is where this one really stands out, with such a nice woody clean aftertaste. Mmmmm! Nice and dry with just the right carbonation to compliment the tartness. Overall, this beer really stands out, glad I live in Colorado and can find this all the time.","timontheroad","Aug 30, 2014"

4.29,2.4,4.25,4,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Overall, we are always happy to try another offering from Crooked Stave, and are happy they finally hit national distribution. This is a bottle of “2013/BATCH 5”, and it certainly doesn’t disappoint. We are most excited about its funky zing right when you take that first sip. This is our second beer of the day, and it still punched the tongue without reserve. The bitterness and tartness of flavor comes from both the yeast strains used and the extended oak barreling, acting synergistically together. Comparing this guy to one of their other national releases, Vielle, it is much, much stronger and muskier, as expected, but drinks a bit slower for the same reasons. This one stays with you, lingering for a long time on the tongue, palate, esophagus, and stomach, but there is a certainly clarity to it that you just don’t find in your typical sour or saison.","TheBrewo","Jun 07, 2014"

Tart and tangy on the palate. This is a true pleasure to imbibe. The light bread mixes with the Belgian sourness to a create an enjoyable Saison.

The nose comprises thick funk, tart green apple, candied lemon peel, chardonnay must, a hint of oak, and a splash of toffee (can toffee splash...?). The taste focuses on the funk over the sourness, though, make no mistake, there's plenty of pucker lying beneath the funky tarp. Tastiness, indeed, son. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a very nice saison, one that really pulls in those vogue directions of funky and sour. Good times.","TMoney2591","May 01, 2014"

3.68,-12.2,3.75,3.75,3.5,4,3.75,"On the lighter end of medium body with a tart, puckering mouthfeel and prominent acidic sourness that lingers over the earthier flavors and vinous barrel notes into a dry, acetic finish. Feels more like an American wild ale with little saison character to speak of. There is some funk but I'm guessing it's from the bugs and acidity. Vinous barrel presence really stands out with dry oak and sweeter fruit notes, especially apricot and dark berries. Lots of zesty lemon acidity dominating the flavor with lingering acetic vinegar in the finish. Not harsh or solvent like but makes the beer feel a bit one dimensional. Pretty much just tart citrus acidity, dry oak, subtle vinous fruit and lingering acetic acid. Refreshing and somewhat drinkable but not very complex or interesting.","corby112","Jan 06, 2014"

Such barnyard funk, it reminds me of a good batch of Fantome Saison. A ton of hay and barnyard yeast aromas with some tart wild yeast. Lots of Brett. Some green apple with more citrus and hay. Taste is like a traditional saison up front, but then it quickly becomes something as amazing as a Fantome saison (on a good batch). That amazing tart flavor up front that quickly become peppery spiciness and lemon zest. Funky horse blanket and barnyard hay with citrus fruits and pepper. Super dry finish. Mouthfeel is dry and refreshing...a little on the "juicy" side for a saison. Drinkability is very high.

4.22,0.7,3.75,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Pours yellow-orange and cloudy. Looks like it could be a bit clearer with better bottle handling; I'd be a terrible bartender. Medium white head. Some lacing and pretty good retention. There's a thin layer of bubbles on top of the beer after a fair bit of time. The aroma is big on lemons, limes, underripe apricots, cherries and peaches, grapes, oak, earth, medium to mild funk and a nice dash of saison yeast spice. Smells nice and tart. There's a bit of yogurty flavor in there, but it comes off more fruity sour than anything. Taste starts out with limes and sour grapes and keeps building up with more tart fruit. Underripe stone fruit is prominent. Funk is somewhat more in the background, but there's a definite musty, barnyard-ish character in there. Quite dry, particularly in the finish. Aftertaste is tannic oak, lime rind, peppercorns, grass and light vinegar. Lots of tart fruit flavors bouncing around. It's only medium sour, and it's a pretty gentle ride, really. Light on the palate. Some pucker, though you do feel the vinegar on your teeth after a glass. Another very good bottle from CS.","popery","Aug 06, 2013"

3.84,-8.4,3.25,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a murky orange with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, and sour aromas. Taste is much the same with some sour fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink.","UCLABrewN84","May 06, 2013"

3.48,-16.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,3,"375ml bottle $6.99. Bright yellow-orange color, decent head that disappeared quickly, looks nice in a wine glass. Aroma is pretty much all brett to me, a bit of that animal funk and a tinge of lemon, not bad. Flavor is more brett and it does have a slight tartness to it as described on the label. Overall this was a decent beer but I just think most of the Crooked Stave beers are priced higher than the quality of the beer.","ArrogantB","Apr 28, 2013"

4.1,-2.1,4,4,4.25,4,4,"i really like this saison. a very refreshing and flavorful beer. quite funky, but i can't really tell if there is brett in this or not. you don't taste much of the oak barrel aging either, but that's usually the case in the recent handful of sours i've had.. though this is not a sour. definitely one of the better saisons i've had.","facundoCNB","Apr 21, 2013"

4.16,-0.7,4,4.25,4.25,4,4,"This poured out as a lightly hazy yellowish orange color with a white head on top. The retention is thin and the lacing is lightly scattered. The smell is funky, there is a plenty of lemon and fresh oak aromas. The taste is tart, it's very earthy in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is light bodied with a good carbonation. It's a juicy brew with a dry finish. Overall it's a pretty good brew. Worth trying.","Knapp85","Apr 05, 2013"

The nose is a little less funky than the vieille but still has a funky farmhouse/barnyard quality. Some oaky acid quality with lemon and peppery spice. Taste is somewhat tart up on the ont and followed by citrus and funk. Mouthfeel is light and highly carbonated. Overall, very nice Saison with some unique qualities.","homebrew311","Mar 10, 2013"

If this is notable of their general offerings I will most definitely be back in the future. This is a really solid saison with a proper use of brett it is not unbelievable but solid and very well done I recommend this beer.","Pinknuggets","Mar 10, 2013"

3.99,-4.8,4,4.25,4,3.25,4,"Pours a hazy yellowish-golden with a fiery orange hue and a nice white head. Aroma offers some funky hay, sweet fruity sugars and a liitle oak. Flavor offers mild funk, wheat malt,sweet juicy fresh pulped oranges on top of a slightly tart lemon, a a kiss of some oak. A somewhat crisp, somewhat creamy mouthfeel. Overall, another solid brew from Crooked Stave. Probably my favorite variation of the Surette and definitely glad to have tried. Realy digging the smaller bottle format too.","denver10","Mar 01, 2013"

4.04,-3.6,3.75,4,4,4,4.25,"another winner from crooked stave. the surette is taking on all kinds of new forms, and this one I like a lot. also a surprisingly affordable bottle for them at under 7 bucks. the pour is a bright yellow color like the sun, fogged a little with yeast sediment, but really glowing. there is a few inches of well retained white head too. the nose is bretty and funky, but probably not as sour as some other versions, particularly the reserva version. there is a springtime sort of cut hay vibe to this, with some pucker citrus sour on the back end. the flavor is well rounded, with light wheat malt and some white grape acidic flavor too. herbal on the hop front, and indeed quite sour in the finish. the finish is really dry, which I like a lot. light in feel, but interesting as anything they make. upbeat carbonation and a signature crooked stave sourness that leaves me wanting another bottle. not my favorite in the surette line, but a fine example of the style. bravo, once again.","StonedTrippin","Feb 18, 2013"
3.57,-14.8,3.75,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"O-Although this is a decent saison, with some nice flavors and an above-average mouthfeel, this is far from the most intriguing beer I have had from Crooked Stave. It lacks the complexity and intrigue of the old-world styles and it isn't exactly a hit-you-on-the-head new-world monster (with tons of flavor or pucker power). Instead, this is a decent effort, but nothing I need to search out.","spoony","Feb 16, 2013"

Dry, bitter, oak, smooth, tons of horseblanket, not too much fruit, no tartness either, high carbonation. Lots of chardonnay. Recommended, just not as a sour. It could be more rounded to provide better flow and blending..","chugalug06","Feb 15, 2013"
