"Color is golden and clear, huge head that quickly vanishes. Aroma of malt, citrus and even a little frankincense. There's a nice and subtile bitterness in the taste, which makes it an enjoyable, thirst-quenching beer."

"I can proclaim with complete certainty that among the best Saison I've tried was a bottle labeled ""Saison Dupont Vieille Provision"". However, I can also say that this beer has struck me, as often as not, as a merely good (not great) representation of the style. Not sure how to account for the discrepancy except to suggest that 'fresher is better'. But I'd strongly recommend it either way."

"O - I love saison dupont and try to pick a few up on a regular basis. Just a staple for what a great saison can be. If you can get this I suggest you do so. This is a bottle of greatness"
"Poured a gorgeous cloudy golden body with one and a half fingers of thick, foamy head. Overall impression of appearance is of a nice saison, very true to form. Scents of light tea, moderate levels of honey, light dank, cellar-like aromas, high levels of floral hops with some herbal character, spicy phenols at a moderate level with notes of clove and white pepper, sweet, fruity aromas, particularly orange and tangerine at high levels. Overall impression of flavor is of a fantastic saison. It captures the fruity character of the style nicely, with a good hit of phenols and a nice presence of hops, true to the style. A good, classic saison that is quite nice. Flavor begins lightly dry with notes of honey and medium-high levels of floral, herbal hops with medium-light notes of lemon zest, light phenols with a white pepper character and a bit of fruity esters with an orange quality. Middle is lightly dry with notes of honey, spicy phenols with notes of white pepper, herbal hops and a light hint of alcohol. Finish is dry with notes of herbal hops, some spicy hops, notes of white pepper, softly sweet malt and a light lemon zest and orange zest character. Aftertaste is dry with notes of herbal and spicy hops and a bit of white pepper. Overall impression of flavor is of a classic saison, nothing off, fantastic, balanced and true to style. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with effervescent carbonation, some prickly tartness and an overall drying feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of an excellent true to style saison. Quite nice. Overall this is an amazing saison. It has a wonderful aroma and flavor, truly fitting the style, and a mouthfeel that compliments the flavor."

"Overall, one of the better saisons I've had. Not my favorite style, but this one gets out and achieves everything it tries to do. Nails all the flavors, great appearance, and easy to drink."

"Best light beer I've ever had."

"O-absolutely fantastic saison. great complexity and extremely drinkable."
"Wild yeasts, barnyard earthiness. With a distinct non-hop bitter aftertaste."
""
""
""
"Overall not my favorite saison but a great and classic example of the style; definitely unique."
""
""
"Complex and refreshing. Very few beers seem to have this much fruity/spicy yeast character as well as being this bone dry. Simply wonderful."
"O-  Very refreshing beer, will definitely revisit in the summer."
"So... this is like the standard bearer for saisons, right? You know what it tasted like? Every other well done saison I've tried. I mean, it was yummy, but it wasn't some transcendent experience. It just tasted like a good saison. I guess maybe there isn't much variation in this style? Stone's version is the only true exception I've come across."

"Great bottle beer. Smells intense, taste is well rounded. An interesting Saison, as the more common fruitiness does not show itself until the very end of the after taste. Good beer!"

"No weak spot on this beer (just leave a sediment in the bottle and don't pour it in the glass). It reminded me of witbier (colour), Belgian pale ales, tripels and even Orval and gueuze. Refreshing and light, yet full of taste. Citrusy, mild funky, grassy..."

"Excellent but pricey saisson beer."

"Nice fruit in the front. Mellows out to an orange after taste. Not too strong but not too light,  so overall good balance and taste."

"The iconic Saison Dupont pours hazy gold under a 2” persistent white foam cap that provides intricate lace. A light fruit, pineapple nose combines with light bread aromas and a trace of well ripened fruit. It starts crisp and dry on the plate with a trace of fruit – primarily orange – that becomes more prominent as it warms seasoned with spice and a hint of sweetness over biscuity malt. A moderate hop accent brings it together on the finish. It has medium to medium high carbonation and a refreshing, medium body.  If you get a good one, the large green 75 cl bottles are better the brown 33 cl ones but about one in 4 of the larger bottles is skunky."
""

""
""
"Beer perfection. So many flavors, so balanced"
"Overall: Prototypical Saison.  Classic taste with a light body and dry finish."
""
""
"Saison is not my style of choice, but this is a refreshing, nice beer....great for a hot Australian Summer day."
""
"What can you say, ""it defines the style"" a bit dryer than most American saison."
"The best looking beer ever... Taste matches up to it. It's awesome. I love a thick head and this one pillows out. Great with anything, must try"
""
"I love saisons and this one is a good one"
""
""
""

"Overall: Started out good, but there's a dry flavour that s a bit too bold. Still very good, and drinkable."

"Poured into tall tulip glass.  A slightly hazy pale yellow with some reddish tones, four finger pure white head that mostly persists but slowly dissipates leaving tons of lacing, champagne-like bubbles.  Aroma is of yeast, bread, crackers, and just a hint of citrus (lemon).  Taste is of bread and crackers, yeast, some citrus, and eventually some spice.  Mouth is clean and dry, super refreshing.  Overall, a classic saison and a perfect thirst quencher."
""
""
""
""
"375ml bottle poured into a goblet. Color: yellow  Thick rocky white head. Slightly skunky, probably complements of the green bottle. Flavor: well balanced sweetness and hoppiness, some pepper like spiciness, with a nice dry finish."
"I rate this a 4.65"

"Slightly cloudy light golden color. Smell is of bananas and citrus. Taste has banana/hefeweizen notes with a clean finish. Enjoyable refreshing beer but nothing special."

"O: I'll open this part by restating my disclaimer that I am overly sensitive to hop flavors, and as such, my reviews likely do not apply to the majority. This beer is a tad heavy on the hops for my taste, obscuring most of the malt profile and likely much of the yeast complexity as well. This drank closer to a hoppy wheat ale than a saison for me. Other folks will likely find this to be balanced and more complex."

"The actual taste differs a lot from the aromas. It evokes a much warmer feeling on the palate, than the aromas revealed, due to soft yeast, straw, peppery hints, tart lemon, pear and spices. Has an incredibly smooth mouthfeel, which is just outraging soft on the palate, with added complexity from the slightly biting, savory spices among peppery notes and lively, metallic carbonation. Pleasant, floral hops act as an enjoyable counterpart, with the addition of earthy malts, to the sweeter spices. The palate is simply perfect, substantial and round up front, finishing very dry and lightly fizzy. Outstanding well balances beer, which is close to perfection in taste with a particular complex body."

"Poured a slightly cloudy golden color, with a thick, foamy white head. Has a very floral aroma, with hints of citrus. Taste is hard to describe but is quite good, refreshing, and very crisp, with a hint of sweetness. A bit of spiciness on the finish. Moderate carbonation and a thinner mouth feel. A great beer."

"O – Not going to hold the skunking against it, as I’m seeing that it’s pretty common to this beer.  I sure wish they would reconsider the green bottles, though. I understand why this is THE classic example of a saison.  From the big foamy pour to the quenching finish, this is a solid, great beer all-around."

"Pours a bright golden yellow with a massive pillowy fluffy white head. Highly carbonated. Smells massively of graphite and iron with a dash of grass and a crisp autumn day. Tastes mellow and of fresh milky oats and grains. Finishes with grAssy earthiness. Not a bright green grass taste, but more of a dusty grey dried out grass in late summer. After a few sips some of the earthiness melts away and just leaves a mellow sweetness with a very mild caramel sugar. Pretty darn tasty. I expected this to be a little more delicate, but still refreshing. For being widely regarded as the best saison ever, I think my expectations were a little high."

"I bought this with very high expectations. I let it chill for a few days before opening it. When I did open it it was skunked and tasted like an old Heineken which is not what this should taste like. Very disappointed but it was probably stored improperly so I will give another chance but from a different store."

"Overall, this is the textbook definition of what a Saison should be. Pretty much the defining beer for the style and one of my all time favorite beers."

"This was good. Dry and herbal and somewhat spicy. Straw colored, visible floaters, slightly hazy. White head with persistent lace. Hops were a nice backdrop to some fruitiness and malt. Very clean and crisp. Somewhat of an apple cider crispness in the taste and slight apple in the nose. Pretty drinkable, alcohol pretty well hidden. Smooth mouthfeel. Overall this was good and interesting."

"o: not as spicy as i would have expected, yet the brett in here is really nice. its mellow and isn't overwhelming. the grapes/apples combined with the wheat flavors make this a really refreshing beer - yet combined with the brett make this all come together nicely and brings the flavors blended together really nicely"
"A classic Belgian Saison Ale which pours slightly cloudy to a brilliant golden color. A abundance of carbonation leaves a huge fluffy head which lasts much longer than most heads. Fabulous lacings remain while the ale is consumed. The taste is citrusy, crisp, dry and effervescent. The flavor is nicely balanced and ends with a slightly bitter finish - which in this case is a plus. The alcohol content is 6.5% which is a little higher than most saisons and is also a good thing. The ale came in a 75 cl bottle format."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is classic for a reason (well, when it's not skunked...), and that's because it's so damn effortless and perfectly balanced. The more good saisons I drink, the more I absolutely adore the style - I don't even care that this was a bit skunked. I will buy the hell out of this beer as long as I know I'm getting it fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: This is a very drinkable beer. It might even be sessionable if it weren't for the slightly above-average ABV."
""
""
""
"This is not the must unique of flavor-laden saison out there, but has a fine balance and was a fine drink on a summer evening on the porch, I found."

"Malty smell with fruit, spice and a hint of lemon. Taste begins with sweet malts followed by wheaty tartness with notes of pepper and hops. Finishes with a dry and bitter spicy aftertaste. Medium-light mouthfeel and carbonation, a bit watery mouthfeel. Very drinkable. A good refreshing beer for a hot summer day. Would have again."

"O: Dupont is the benchmark of a historical and inspiring beer. Great for the seasoned beer nerd or rookie just wanting something drinkable. Sessionable, well balanced, and just enough complexity to make it interesting & fun. Dupont is a legend but I think Spring Hopper Saison held up well and gives inspiration for the future!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall impression is I do like this style and could drink more of it. I like the clove, tropical fruit, and funk mix. Its also very smooth which makes it a warmer weather beverage. This is supposed to be the quintessence of the style and I do like that about it. Some of the American breweries that are making the style are mucking it up with all these herbal additions, leave the yeast to do the job my friends and it should speak for itself. This is a good overall beer."

"O - Great beer, no question. Unfortunately at $6 retail for the bottle that I purchased, the value is not here on this one. Only slightly better than some more reasonably priced Saisons that I have enjoyed in the past."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear gold with a frothy two-finger head. Earthy bread, hay and grape fill the nose. Those tastes, along with a bit of fruit and barnyard funk predominate the taste. Medium mouth with a fair amount of carbonation Crisp. This isn't my favorite saison, but it's very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Great beer, even being skunked. Or maybe I am just not too familiar with the style and Saisons are supposed to have a strong skunk aroma? I would definitely be interested in trying another bottle to maybe see its full potential."

"Hazy light golden colored with an inch thick dense off white head of foam. Brussels lacing. Vibrant carbonation. Aroma is of saison yeast with peppery spicy notes. Slight hints of pear. The mouth is moderately carbonated and crisp. The flavor is of pale malt and gentle spice notes from the saison yeast. The overall impression is lots of flavor from something so subtle and smooth."

"O - my first Saison and although i have nothing else to base it on, I loved it! will definitely be looking into some other ones to try. i loved the fruitiness of this one and there seemed to be a very bubblegum smell and taste which was pleasant. anything belgian screams my name"

"Pours a cloudy golden color with a thick 1/2 foamy 1/2 carbonated head.  Head retention and lacing are excellent.  Strong clove and banana aroma; on the sweeter side.  Has a good Belgium malty taste up front with a nice peppery, spicy hoppy finish.  You do get some banana and cloves in there.  Carbonation is high.  Very good saison, but I would expect it from this beer."

"O: Saison Dupont is the quintessential example of the Saison/Farmhouse ale. Many have tried to mimic it, but few are truly worthy of standing in its company. Needless to say, this is an absolute must-drink for any true beer geek. Pairing options are endless, but salads and lighter fare are easy choices. White fish and chicken as well, along with a multitude of different herb and spice combos. Fried portobello mushrooms just popped into my head too, maybe play up the funk a little bit. It's very versatile, as it won't overwhelm the more delicate dishes, but can cut through bolder flavors and richer textures as well."

"O: This was good, but it was quite pricey. Not sure if it was worth the money to me but it was a pretty good saison though I do prefer the darker Belgian varieties."
"Overall cant say i enjoy this beer very much. I know it gets some high reviews but i just dont see it that way."
"The Saison Dupont gets a cooler-than-cassette-tapes 9.0 / 10 -- or for those on BeerAdvocate, a 4.5 / 5"

"Pours a dusty golden colour with amber hues in the deepest part of this stemmed tulip. Has a reasonable white head that doesn't leave as much lacing as I'd expected. Delightful aroma of bananas and biscuity bread, with enough spiciness to be interesting but not overwhelmingly cloved. Well balanced taste features the Belgian yeast more prevalently, but is again not unpleasantly one dimensional. There are enough malted grains to support the banana and coriander without being overpowered, and a respectably clean bitterness in the finish."

"O: A solid, reliable, refreshing saison. It won't wow you, but won't disappoint either."
"O: It's a burning tire saison. Most of the flavors and smells are pretty good but it's kinda hard to overcome the burning tires. Meh. It loses points for trying to kill me too."
""
"I find this beer to be nearly perfect, as saison is my favorite style right now. The only detractor to me, is how impossible it is to pour off the bottle without 40% to 70% head. This beer is so obviously made using champagne yeast, I believe Nitro-glycerin might be less reactive. Other than that, everything about this beer is dead on."

"Cork has 2.011 stamped on it, so I’m assuming/hoping that this is a fresh bottle. But really, who knows. Maybe it was bottled in February this year. Maybe its been sitting on display for almost 9 months. Maybe…it’s just beer. Whatever the case is, time and a green bottle has done nothing to diminish the appearance of the beer as it comes out a hazy golden straw color with a generous cloud of foam that doesn’t want to dissipate. Big, airy bubbles give off an aroma full of green apple zest and dampened straw. First taste coats the mouth with a bubbly, funky, inviting mix of pleasing, welcome flavors. I imagine green apple nectar, a light floral pollen-like delicate touch, mixed with a pleasing crisp and edgy acidity. Some damp straw, a dry finish, effervescent vitality. My only question is, can I have some more? With the moderate ABV and a 750 ml bottle all to my lonesome the answer is yes, yes I can."

"A veritable classic. Saison Dupont is a great example of a saison; It is crisp, refreshing with a lively, spicy yeast character but overall, I feel that I have had much better saisons. Dupont definitely fires on all cylinders, but like the flavor profile drops out before it really hits it peak on your palate. I think Vietnamese and Thai food would pair beautifully with this beer. Highly recommended, if not just for a solid baseline to compare modern renditions of a Saison to."

"Classic saison that arrived a pale straw with ample white head. Aroma was a bit subdued but yeasty esters and citrus were notable along with some herbs and peanut butter sweet malt. In the mouth, beer was a heady mix of orange spice tea, lemon, clove, white pepper, herbal perfume, apple, and cashew brittle, all integrated well with a dry bitter finish. Did not notice the funk that some describe. Pleasing combination of malt and spice with a dryness that evokes champagne and a surprising nuttiness."
""
""
"OVERALL : Although I can easily understand why this beer is seen as a staple in the Saison style, it's not my favorite. Don't misunderstand me, I'd still have one of those as often as they come, but I've tasted some products, even within the Dupont brewery itself, that pleased me much more than this still very fine beer."

"Appearance was a hazy straw yellow with enough head to choke an elephant! On par for the brew I am told. Lots of rotten ripe fruit straight up the nose followed by classic belgian spice. Taste is much the same with a slight sour twang added to the mix! Lots of carb and a cool brew over all! Love the mini Champagne bottle!"

"O- Deliciously refreshing. This is the first time I've had Saison Dupont, and it lived up to the hype. Not a disappointment at all. I'm now convinced that the best setting to drink a farmhouse ale is on the second floor of a barn looking out over a Catskill Mountain horse pasture on a hot day in late July."

"DATE TASTED: August 25, 2013 ... GLASSWARE: Duvel snifter... OCCASION: drafting while draughting--a perfect beer for a fantasy football draft!... APPEARANCE: pale, cloudy yellow heather body with a half-glass mushroom cloud of soft white head--as attractive as C.J. Spiller, my first rounder... AROMA: clean, grassy, lemony roundness with enough vanilla and citrus medley to complicate the nostrils ...PALATE: goodness, this is easy-drinking; a slightly warming finish does little to detract from the beer's pleasant front-end presence and sipability...TASTE: a touch of sourness denotes the citrus presence, while the overall flavor is soft hoppy goodness, like a freshly mown lawn wafting... OVERALL: after the Dogfish Head 60 yesterday and this today, I probably could retire from summer beer drinking; as I remembered it, a refreshing, almost euphoric bottle that makes one question the need for another night's drink; enough alcohol to be significant, weak enough to be enjoyed more than once..."

"A great saison. A well balanced mix of tart, malt, bitter, and yeasty funk."
"O: my first true Belgian Saison, I have to say I appreciate this beer quite a bit. I found the taste and mouth feel to be more ""natural"" than the other saisons I have had. The finish was very nice and all in all this is a very impressive beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - while it's not my favourite for the style, it's a great representation and should be on the short list of saisons to try for anyone entering craft beer. Great value for a top notch brew."
"Mouthfeel is effervescent. Overall, this is quite good."

"Overall- One of my saison stand bys. Great beer"

"Pours hazy golden with dense, rocky white head that fades to that classic ""Belgian Lace"" in the glass. Effervescent. Aromas of citrus fruit and black pepper dominate. Palate follows aroma, a nice combination of citrus fruity esters and peppery phenols. Soft malt backbone. Finishes very dry. Light body with heavy carbonation. Overall, a very refreshing, well-crafted farmhouse ale that might be the most food friendly beer out there!"
""
"O- I can dig it. A little different take on the style (clove) than I have had, but I can certainly see why it is a gold standard."
""
""
""
"A golden amber hue with a medium lasting white frothy head. Aroma and Taste is sweet citrus, Belgian yeast, very fruity essence with some mild biscuit malt and bitter notes. Palate is medium body, crisp with lively carbonation, a sweet dry mouth feel. Finishes with a sweet fruity, Belgian yeast and citrus flavor with some biscuit malt, ending is mildly sweet and dry. Overall a very good, flavorful and enjoyable saison."
"Poured from 750ml bottle into A'chouffe tulip. Golden color pour with foamy white head. Aroma is somewhat not impressive...malty and grainy almost macro like, but still has nice saison typical spicy yeast notes. Taste is great. Malty with a great hop and yeast balance. Slight fruity notes, a bit spicey and all around balanced. All things desired in a saison are present at perfect balance. Awesome (nearly) perfect saison."

"Overall - fantastic brew that is a treat for anyone who enjoys a saison!"

"This is one delicious and easy-drinking beer. Lots going on, and not just a session drinker. I could drink this all summer long and not feel I'm just consuming malt, yeast, and hops. Just the right amount of bitterness and lots of flavor, flowers and fruits. This is one of my favorite Saison's. Excellent."

"The smell was sweet and the first sip was as good as last. I could see drinking this on a hot summer day while hanging out with friends."
""
""
""
"O: A moderately strong-flavored beer that would likely pair well with a full-bodied French cheese (memo to me for next time...) The dry, bitter finish detracted a little from the experience, but overall it was worth trying."
"Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"
""
"Overall, I think this is a great beer because its blended very well. It has a sour component, not really bitter, but it is also very sweet. It's so bubbly like drinking champagne, but it tastes better than champagne. This would be a great beer for a hot summer day or for new years."
"overall: Haven't had many Saisons, but this one is absolutely amazing and is so well balanced, this would be my first choice for best representation of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Excellent Saison. BOOM. Brasserie Dupont nails it. Easily one of their best."
""
""
"O - The best Saison I've tasted so far, I'm just upset that a style that's so gorgeous is so difficult to find varieties of in Pennsylvania!"
"More subtle, but also rather complex. Really a good thirst quencher."
""
""
"O - Soft and light saison with some nice floral tones."
""
""
"Overall: A wonderful saison. Definitely deserves all the praise that it has received. If you are new to saisons and looking for one to try, let it be this one."

""
""
""

""
""

"This is my first time having a Belgium Saison style and the closest i can compare it to is champagne. Not a Cheap bottle of Champagne but a good style. This is mouth filling carbonation, the taste is a bit funky (just like a champagne) however you get this taste of coriander maybe some citrus flavor fruits and no taste of alcohol what so ever. This is a great beer to try, pick it up!"
""
""
""
""
""

"Very straightforward and refreshing while still being interestingly complex, Saison DuPont is a must try if you have even the slightest interest in Belgian-style ales."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"THIS is what beer should always taste like. Smooth, flavorful, but always crisp and refreshing at the finish. Very strong, fruity and citrus flavors up front, mixed with a heavy wheat body. The finish is pure summer hefeweizen. The Belgium people know beer like no other. I am in awe of this simple, yet powerful, brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fruity, earthy, and dry, this is definitely a refreshing beer. It's a bit more earthy and dry than I prefer, but great example of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I had read that there could be infected or skunky batch floating around the LCBO, and unfortunately I think I was subject to this aforementioned group. That being said, a flavourful brew was detectable amidst the skunk. I would give this brew another chance, but unfortunately I know my local LCBO likely won't be privy to another batch."

"O: I wish I would have let this beer age longer. It tastes tight and ""hard"" now and would perhaps broaden with some age. Still, a wonderfully delicate beer. It went perfect with our fusili with fresh uncooked tomato, basil, garlic sauce & pine nuts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer is just wonderful. I can only compare it to Sofie and Hennepin. I would compare it more to Hennepin, but this wins. The dry wonderful finish is lovely. I would enjoy having this on a hot day or with something spicy or seafood."
"An incredible saison. One of the best."
"Hazy orange blonde colour, 2 fingers of white head, decent lace all the way down the glass. Nose is yeasty with just a hint of funk, lots of fruit, lemon, green apple with a bit of spice, light corriander, bit of nectarine as well. Yeasty, lots of lemony flavours, with a bit of hop, tart green apple skins, floral adn fruity, earthy and spicy in the finish, drying mid palate. Medium dry carbonation, medium body. Really good, certainly something that can be easily consumed in large quantities."

"Pours a dull gold, rich. Medium cloudy but easy to see through. Big white head. Good lacing, retention. The aroma is sweet, fresh malt with pepper and fruit, pears, apricots, peaches, apples. Yeasty edge, almost lager-ish in tone. Clean and dry. The taste starts with fruity malt sweetness and dries out with yeast and spice flavors. Pepper and earth. Very refreshing. Light mineral, floral hops. Crisp feel. Effervescent. Light on the palate. This is a classic saison, and it has a refreshing and clean flavor. Easy to drink and quite good, though not necessarily my favorite take despite the importance of the beer."
""
""
"Overall, it's easy to see why this is one of the standard-bearers for the farmhouse style. I prefer my saisons to be a little more in-your-face, with some more funk and dankess. But this one is clearly versatile for multiple seasons and cuisines."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer was offered to me as the ""o.g. saison."" I could believe this beer has inspired a brewer or two. It's an exhilirating balance of complex, spicy bitterness, light sweetness, and a uique and forward acidity. I look forward to drinking more."
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Hazy hue, giant head, sticky leftovers as it settles, and plenty of lacing as you drink it down. Nose is heavy bread with some peanut and fermented fruit. Bready flavor with some pine bite, offset with some faint allegations of fruit. Dry, light, and papery. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Tis is a nearly perfect Saison. It's too bad more than half the bottles I've had are skunked. This beer has been far better than other bottles I've had, though. It's balanced, complex, and refreshing - pretty much the perfect Saison."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If you haven't tried it, it's certainly worth a try."
""
"O: A refreshing and bright beer which draws true strength from the yeast. A necessary beer to experience for anyone who wishes to understand Belgian beer styles. At $8.99 at BevMo, this brew will be a regular in the rotation for the warm season which is settling upon Los Angeles."

""
""
"Overall: Really great saison. Love the look and feel of this beer the most. A benchmark beer for the style! Its a must try beer. An $8 shelf beer in a large format bottle. Great value and a well crafted brew walk together hand in hand."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a really nice Saison. It hits on what I'd expect from a one, barnyard, tart fruit and flowers, dry and easy drinking, it's all there. This is a very refreshing beer that I'll gladly seek out in the hotter months. I love Belgian's and this is one of my favorites."
""
"O - Refreshing! Almost a lawn mower beer. This is not a saison that gives you some funky farmyard (which I like very much), but I love it."
""
""
""
"Super refreshing and tastey, but this bottle feels sort of old. That, or this is just decent. Well balanced though."
""
""
""
""
""
"Food match: The vinous character of this beer would most suit anything that goes well with white wine; light pasta, fish, and Asian cuisine. In fact this brew has flavours that would compliment anything bar game meats and char-grilled steaks."
""
"O: A great example, very refreshing on a hot summer day especially after brewing a batch of Saison my self. A perfect beer to have after a hard days work. Definitely would have hit the spot after a hard days work on the farm."

""
"Overall- This is the most classic saison you can have as far as flavor and smell. Although it is high in alcohol for a ""traditional"" saison like was made in olden farming days of Belgium. But, nonetheless it is everything a saison was meant to be, which is: Thirst quenching, easy to drink, and extremely tasty. Truly one of the best beers out of belgium."

"The orange smell steps out right away from the beautiful sunny glass. The taste also brings the oranges, together with subtle floral tones. I can notice a black pepper tone, but strongly associated with the aroma, while taking the sip. The end is dry, with a well-balanced hop bitterness. This is a beer with character."
""
"Overall: this was my first Saison - I have had Krieks and Lambics before, but I think Saison suits me a little better. Also, considering the size of the bottle (750mL), the ABV (6.5%) and the price (approx AU$12-13 a bottle in 2013) it is actually quite decent value. Not cheap, but I don't expect a specialty Belgian ale to be cheap by any means. This one is worth it."

"O: Overall I am really enjoying drinking this beer. When smelling the beer I thought it was going to be ripe with funky flavors when it came to tasting. It was a complete polar shift. I found that my glass appeared to empty much quicker than other saisons I've had. It is not full of sourness or horsey barnyard smells and flavors (at least to me). It is very subtle in all flavors and they meld nicely."
""
""
""
"This one pours a light bodied opaque light gold in color with a one finger white head that sticks to the side of the glass. The nose is light and yeasty with orange peel, lemon rhind, aged hops, Belgian yeast, and a light floral character. The flavors too, are light and citrusy. There is a light orange sweetness followed by the lemon bitterness, a touch of corn, old hops, and light hibiscus and tea. I would say I prefer the nose a little more. It drinks very light and is definitely sessionable and easy to drink. This would be great for warmer weather. Overall this is a fine saison and one that at $10 is a must try."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 5/1/2012. Pours hazy bright golden amber color with a nice 2-3 finger fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big lemon, apple, pear, pepper, clove, straw, hay, floral, earth, wheat, light leather, and funky yeast esters. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy esters. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, pepper, clove, straw, hay, grass, earth, floral, light leather, and lightly funky yeast spiciness. Fair amount of earthy spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, pepper, clove, straw, wheat, hay, earth, and lightly funky yeast spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice flavor complexity and balance; with zero cloying flavors on the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a lightly slick and fairly crisp and foamy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent saison! Great flavor complexity and balance; and very smooth to sip on this the high carbonation. A highly enjoyable offering as expected."

"O: I'm pretty sure this is a benchmark saison - light, clean-tasting, refreshing and satisfying - easy-drinking."

"one of the classic saisons, and one ive been meaning to try again and review for awhile. i really enjoy this beer. its pale honey colored in appearance and a bit cloudy with an absolutely massive white foam head, like a giant snow bank. a big old white pillow that hardly subsides at all. the nose is delicate pitted fruit and a moderately spicy belgian yeast. wheat malt and yeast are the first two flavors i pick up, but there is a gentle summery sweetness in the back end with golden raisins, peaches, and wildflowers. amazing how all these subtleties come together in a beer that remains so light and airy. effervescent carbonation makes it feel even lighter in the mouth, and although the body isnt that light, it really feels like drinking a cloud. super sessionable in the summertime for sure, and a nice reminder in the winter that summer will come again, as it always does. one of the better widely available saisons out there."

"Overall I thought this was a good beer and it was a very good example of the style, it had all the aspects that I look for in the style, everything from the mouthfeel to the taste were just as they should be. This beer had very good drinkability, it was very smooth, with some nice flavors that held my attention, I can see myself drinking a couple of these during the summertime. What I liked the most about this beer was how clean and complex it was, nothing was muddled and there was a good amount going in the aroma and taste. What I liked the least about this beer was the price, I know it's not cheap to import awesome beer from Belgium, but it's a little too pricey for me to buy often, if it was cheaper I could see myself drinking this often in the summertime. I would buy this beer again, but only once in a while, I recommend this beer to just about anyone. All in all I enjoyed this beer and it gave me a good idea as to what a traditional Belgium Saison tastes like, it was pretty good but I have had a couple American Saisons that are just about on the same level. I'll have to be on the look out for more beers from this brewery."

"Saison Dupont has a nice light body with active carb. The flavor rolls through the mouth linger a bit and dissipate, leaving a mild grassy taste afterwards. Easy to take down, with the light alcohol, easy to take down quicker. Easy drinking right here. If it was available in an affordable six pack this would be a no brainer."

"Overall - Trying a Belgian Saison for the first time and I'm impressed with it. Aside from the fact it lacked a strong malty backbone, I have to say it was really good. I say it's definitely worth checking out if you're into Saisons and looking for something just a bit different."
""
""
""
"D- An excellent beer. On tap it is delicious and was a welcome finish to my first day in Belgium."

"O: A fantastic saison. Not too tart, but very funky. Easily one of the driest beers I've ever had. Love it"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer pours a thick white and foamy head, careful pouring is a must. Immediately one is greeted with an inviting fruity aroma, mostly citrus but others lurk amongst them. The appearance is a medium golden color similar to some wheat beers. I would describe the taste as first bready, then slightly sweet, followed by citrus sour. Very delicious and very refreshing I would drink this after a hard day of labor. The mouth feel is very similar to champagne nice and smooth with a sharpness upon swallowing."
""
""
""
""
"The saison by which other saisons are measured. Very good."
"Overall: Great introduction to this style. Really like how refreshing it tastes on a hot late September GA day. Reasonably priced too. Would love to revisit."
""
""
""
""
"Diamonds are forever."
"Overall, this is a classic saison that probably everyone should try at least once if they are at all remotely adventurous beyond the standard AAL & hoppy ales."
"This is a classic Saison, and it's easy to see why. I don't think I would suggest this to newbies. The herbal, hoppy nature might not appeal to an inexperienced palate. Fans of the style should love it. It's expensive, but sooner or later every BA must try this. You won't regret it."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- The quintessential farmhouse ale. If you want to find out whether or not you like saisons, try this first."
""
""

"O: This is an excellent base saison. Nothing crazy or fancy but seriously very well done. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
"In short, versatile. Pop it open during a formal celebration, or open while kicking back on the porch on a sunny day, or sit by the fire on a freezing day with cheese and bread... No matter what occasion, Saison Dupont will be apropos. This is a fantastic beer unlike any I've had, and being far less overwhelming in sourness compared to others, as well as a balanced ABV, it's very likely to be visited again many times over."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O – Wonderful, all around. Great for a hot afternoon on the porch. I will certainly drink this again"
""
"Strong barnyard flavor. Quite sour, which remains long after the swallow. Relatively thin bodied, highly carbonated. There's a bit of light pepper on the edge. There's also a touch of chalk, thyme and hop bitterness. Complex."
"Overall a very solid saison. Easy to drink a few of these."
""
""
""
"Great beer for start of summer."
"O-A nice archetype of a saison, which is one of my favorite styles of beer. The Dupont is drinkable, but complex enough to hold your interest."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a good Saison, but not a killer."
""
""
""
"The beer pours a hay color, the body is murky underneath a huge white head. The smell is strong and lovely, it's fruity and malty and warm. Man am I glad I waited til a warm summer evening to enjoy this. The taste is fantastic, fruity and clear, the ingredients coming together perfectly to give the experience of being outdoors during summer. There isnt much mouthfeel to speak of because the beer is so light."
"Overall this beer was horribly skunked and I have a feeling it has seen too much light in its short life (bottled 2/2011). The skunk has overpowered many of the qualities that are hiding underneath. I can't see spending $10 plus for a bottle of defective beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy yellow color with a bubbly white head with moderate retention. Smells of earthy spicy and funky; lemony and fruity with a carbonic acid thing going on. The flavor is complex with pepper and earth and tart lemony fruit and light sweet non descript fruit. Medium to light body with spirited level of carbonation and a bubbly mouthfeel. Nice light refreshing fruity and tart ale."
""
""
"I can see where this is considered a benchmark of the style - The bold spiciness and strong floral character throughout certainly sets it apart (as a style in and of itself) within the realm of Belgian ales - at the very least, Saison Dupont seems to stand as a base example from which variations and embellishments and experiments (could) spring forth"
""
""
"T - Mix of spice, cloves and Belgian yeast up front with a touch of bready malt sweetness and some floral notes rounding out the palate. A long, dry finish. Well balanced."
""
""
"Pours a hazy golden amber color with a thick pillow head that is very reminiscent of the Stella Artois commercials. Scent is grassy with citrus hints and an overall earthy smell. Taste is refreshing, full of flavor, and delicious that ends with a dry/crisp finish. A fantastically made farmhouse ale."
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad beer at all but I can't imagine ever buying it again."
"Pours a clear light yellow with a foamy bone colored head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, spices, and yeast. Taste is much the same with a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and very easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours cloudy pale yellow, dirty blond-ish. Fizzy white foam. Heavy foam settles slow. Funky yeasty smell. Earthy. Taste is clean citrussy, very very dry. Light finish. Fades into a mild hop close. Light and easy. Excellent."
"A true classic that took me long enough to review. Compare all Saison to this. I would have to say the tap was missing slight skunk the bottles can have."

"Pours a hazy yellow, that is slightly deeper than expected with a huge white head that leaves some solid lacing. Nose is lighter than expected with pepper and wheat being predominant. Taste is in the same vein, though a buttery slickness comes through too which negatively affects the mouthfeel. Strong & prickly carbonation, and a dryish finish. For a beer I have heard so much about, and in the midst of saison tasting, this beer just didn't do it for me. Nice, though not great, and I dare say I preferred 3 Monts over this."
"Just an all around delightful brew, and a great showcase of the style. Refreshing as all get out."

"Beer presents awesomely in the 750ml corked bottle. Lovely pale colour with spritey carbonation. Nice flakes of yeast floating around. Nose is divine, doesnt get much better than this. Pure freshness. On the tongue I get dryness, apple skins, lemon zest, prickly champagne-like carbonbation on the tongue. Not hugely complex, but doesnt need to be."

"The beer pours a hazy yellow color with a white head. The aroma has a good amount of skunkyness in it, with some wheat and grain notes mixed in. The flavor is unfortunately the same. This is yet another skunked Saison Dupont. This is the third separate bottle I have purchased in an attempt to rate this beer fairly, but after wasting $25+ on skunked beers, I have come to the conclusion that if the brewer is dumb enough to put a beer in a green bottle, they deserve a horrible rating if the beer is skunked. Other than the skunked notes, there is a little citrus and spice. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Overall, a gross, yet I can’t say unexpected, beer. Shame on me for buying bottles three times."

"A wonderfully priced, super refreshing saison with a classic background. Really a great example of the style and something that's going into my regular rotation being a saison lover."
"The scary part is that its drinkable, way too drinkable."
""
""
"Overall: I was a little underwhelmed with the flavours of this brew but they weren't bad by any means. This beer is incredibly balanced and the whole thing develops as it gets closer to room temperature."
""
"O - Surprising to me, I felt it was a middle of the road example of the style. I'm curious if it not being bottled and having the sediment of yeast has a tangible affect. I'll pass on this one."
"Medium bodied with a big, sharp effervescence and some drying. A goodly amount of stickiness develops on both the tongue and upper palate. A good amount of warming from the 6.5 ABV. A very good beer for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"-Overall 3.5: Good, but certainly not ""world class."" I have to admit that the skunkiness factors into this, and why not? Should I give the beer makers at Brasserie Dupont a break on their idiotic decision to internationally distribute a very expensive beer in a giant green bottle? I don't think so. Good beer, probably would be better without the green bottle and unless I can find one that is not in a green bottle, I will not be buying it again."
""
""
""
"The alcohol was a bit strong in this but almost undetectable underneath everything else that was going on. While this style of beer isn't quite for the novice, anyone who is a fan of this style ought to seek out and enjoy this as soon as possible. It's a textbook example of the style and worth the sight and sensory experience."
""
""
""
""
"O - This is generally considered among the signature widely available saisons and for good reason. My only gripe with it is that its dryness prevents it from being that ideal thirst-quenching choice, which is what a ""farmhouse"" ale always strikes me as needing. But it's a trivial ding as overall this is a finely made saison."
""

"This is a bad mutha...and it's even more awesome not having to deal with green bottles."

"Pours a translucent golden color with a generous frothy, white head. The zesty aroma of coriander and mild citrus comprise a light and invigorating bouquet. Vigorous carbonation accentuates a spiced flavor that matches the aroma. Belgian yeast character asserts itself up front. There's some citrus and banana, but they're well-controlled and not cloying as is sometimes the case. The finish is crisp and dry, giving the palette ample opportunity to reset between sips. A nebulous, mild barnyard funk manifests itself as the glass warms, adding a touch of complexity. A hint of pepper is lurking somewhere in there as well. This is a very crisp and refreshing saison, well-deserving of the stellar reputation that preceded it. Impossible to turn down on a warm summer's day."
""
"MOREY’S BOTTOM LINE: It had been a while since I’d had this, and it’s even better than I remembered. It’s sour, funky, fruity, and most of all….refreshing. Definitely a top example within the style, and well worth the $8.99 that I shelled out for this bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste: Lemony citrus character really comes through here, after I was unable to detect it at all in the nose - a pleasant surprise. Dry grainy finish. Medium-full bodied with spry effervescent carbonation dancing across your tongue. An excellent farmhouse ale."
"Overall, an enjoyable beer, will have again."
"O: Good summer patio beer that would go well with sunshine, summer tunes and bar-b-qued wild salmon. Easy drinking and refreshing."
""
"D - A poor beer. Too musty and hold tasting. Would never get this again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the light crispness and the full flavoring to the taste. This is an exemplary Saison, with very fresh and clean malts, perfectly balancing the booze, with bitterness ultimately predominating. Throughout all aspects the beer fits the style, without becoming overwhelming at any point."
"Also had draught version one day earlier, which was more flavorful with deeper character. The best version of this beer is clearly via draught with the bottled version is a distant third place."
"Long lasting head. Hazy. Pilsner malty, bitter, peppery, touch of clove, phenolic aroma and some flavor. Tasty, but slight brett flavors lean toward pepper/sandpaper rather than refreshing slightly sourness. Full bodied, yet pretty dry for this alcohol level. Dangerously drinkable, but I'm a bit disappointed after seeing scores well above 90."

"Overall, a wonderful saison, and the one that most likely comes closest to the ideal in terms of style. Definitely one I would enjoy again throughout the summer."
""
"Overall the taste left me wanting more. The smell set the stage for something spectacular and it just wasn't all there, it was very good but I smelled something great. my beagle came trotting out of the other room looking for where the smell was coming from. I could open this and just smell it . I'll be buying some more and let it set for a while."
""
"O: A very complex beer that every sip can impart different tastes as it warms. Finish is long and has a bit of grasseness to it. Great spring time beer"
"O: if somebody didn't tell me what this was, I would figure it a typical, low-level European lager. There is nothing special about this beer to me, and I pick up nothing from the Brett I've heard about in this beer (except maybe the head). Really a huge disappointment, and definitely not worth the 12$ for the 750ml."

"O: This is a very enjoyable Saison. I would recommend this to anyone who likes this style."

"Very nice. Poured a massive 3"" white velvet head with extremely long life and big merengue floaters. The body is a hazy raw sienna yellow color with a faint glow. It smells mildly of grass and grain. Taste is delightful with citrus, grapefruit, grass, grain, and a slow to reveal but long burn from a hops finish. There's a refreshing mouthfeel kind of like Perrier. A class act of a beer."

"Big nose. A very enjoyable experience."
"O - The best Saison I've had. Everything about this beer was enjoyable. It's highly drinkable, refreshing, and tasty. I look forward to pairing this with some salmon."

"O: One of my favorite saisons and truly a classic example of the style. Great flavor, smell, and mouthfeel. This is a beer that I have over and over and never tire of... I think I will have to go replenish my supply soon. Easy to drink and very sessionable. Pairs great with meals."
"Poured on-tap and served in a stemmed vase, the beer is a hazy, opaque, yellow-gold coloring with a thick, foamy, small bubbled, bright white head about a half an inch thick. Aromas are yeasty, with hints of clove and floral highlights. Very light and spicy on the nose. Flavors are very spiced, with a solid clove profile along a citrus and bready blended foundation. Some lavendar and juniper highlights throughout...this beer is well balanced and extremely complex at the same time. Very good challenge to the palate. The aftertaste is clove spiced and toasty, and the light body leaves a sparse lacing on the glass. The finish is slightly lingering, but light and spicy. Good brew."
""
"It pours a nice light yellow with a perfect white head (laces nicely in a glass). PLenty of big citrusy dry notes in the nose, then you take that first sip - Wow! Super yeasty, crisp and dry flavor and a nice finish. A world-class super-beer."
"Overall: Very easy drinking. Some minor funk and a delicate hand make this extremely approachable. It hits all the right characteristics for the style. Incredibly clean and light."
"O: First go at this Saison and very pleased. I went from a boozy saison to this refreshing goodness. Would suggest to anyone and will have again."
""
"O/D - With less spice it'd be quite a solid saison. Good though and very drinkable."

"O- Love it. The classic saison and for a reason. Easy to put away, but complex enough to make you think about the flavors."
""
""
"Taste is the same, very nuanced, subtle, and yeast-forward with a funky and barely bitter leave. The mouthfeel is perfect for this-- pillowy, lightweight, bubbly as hell but soft: completely devoid of the soda pop or champagne carbonation ""bite," despite a comparable amount of bubbles. Big sips come very nicely through the head."
""

""
"O: This is one of my favorite saisons I have yet to try. It is very refreshing, has a great aroma and taste. Very solid all around."
""
"O- Tasty and mellow saison. Balanced and complex, great introductory saison. Not too sour or funky. Slight farmhouse flavors and earthy taste."
""
"Pours a golden color w/ tornado carbonation coming from the bottom of the glass. Massive off white head with great lacing on my tulip. The nose has a very mild lemon, earthy vibe to it. Yeast in there as well. Taste is the same profile w/ light fruit, yeast, and malt out front. Feel is very smooth, it seems a little undercarbonated to me- but it's not bad. Overall a good brew- Wish it didn't come in a green bottle. Cheers."
""
""
"O- Very good saison, probably most traditional one I've had."
"O: This is the second time I’ve had a Saison Dupont and it will be one that I go to again for pairing with meals or just something crisp and pleasant drink on its own."
""
"A good saison, and one I would have again."
""
""
""
"Overall: Yet another saison that I am impressed with. No off-putting smells or flavors to me, no ""horse-blanket"" to be found here. Just delicious and crisp fruitiness with a definite tart bite. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Top shelf. the PERFECT beer to drink on a nice, sunny day"
"The smell is pretty strong, but the actual flavor is very mild. This would be nice on a warm day. If there is such a thing as a lawnmower saison, this is it."
"O: Wow, what a great beer. Had a little skunk to it, because i left it out for a few weeks on my counter to make my beer geek friends jealous. I blame myself, not the beer."
""
""

"Overall great, pretty much defines the style of saison, and this is probably the beer you can single out that has driven most other breweries on where to steer their saison."
""
""
"Overall, enjoyable but not one of my top choices in beer."
"It has a nice clean crisp finish and its mouthfeel is very light."
""
""
"This beer has high carbonation and a large head with a strong hold. The appearance is slightly hazy. The scent is citrusy, like an orange. It has a very crisp and clean finish to it which makes it have a light mouthfeel. It is very dry. There is zero sweetness which makes it slightly bitter."
"Such a wonderfulll beer, this would be amazing on a hot summer day...."
"Very dry, crisp mouthfeel, with a clean aftertaste. That part I like. It's a highly drinkable beer, but there are much better saisons out there. I would not order this one again."
""
"O- My wife is a huge fan of saisons, so this beer was a little bit of a surprise. Most of the saisons we've had are from American brewers, so what we came to realize as we drank it was that this beer is what a saison is supposed to taste like (not that there are not many very good American versions). We had it with Mexican food, and it was great. I cannot wait to have this beer in the summer with some of the fresh summer flavors."
""
""
"It has a large head with a nice light/hazey golden color. It has a large amount of carbonation. It has a citrusy scent which is appealing. It tastes a little tangy and is dry, but it is not bitter. It has a nice crisp, clean finish. Along with a strong hold on the glass."
"There is no sweetness to it!"
"Brewed in November aged till March and then opened in the following summer."
"Very citrusy orangy aroma. Cloudy yellowish color. Cloudiness is from the yeast. Very strong head and good hold on the glass. Crisp and clean finish very fizzy and highly carbonated. Very light and refreshing. Good beer for a hot summer day. Tastes somewhat bitter but do not consider it bitter because it just has no sweetness to it."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The cork comes out with a satisfyingly loud pop. Poured into my Duvel tulip glass. Hazy gold with strong carbonation billowing up, which supports a nice thick white head. the aroma is complex: hay, skunks, funk, sugar and fruit, with a bit of hops in there too. A nice bready malt base sits underneath the sharp, crisp, hoppy and bitter flavors. It finishes with a slight bitterness that lingers. A lot of the aroma comes thru here with the flavor as well. this beer has a nice creamy mouthfeel and strong carbonation. Overall, this is a classic for a good reason, it's just so unique and enjoyable, although the very bitey and crisp flavors may be somewhat of an acquired taste. This is where to start with Saison, since it's easy to find and relatively inexpensive."
""
"The appearance of this beer is a nice hazy golden color with a huge white head that is very, very bubbly. It died fast in a violent manner and left a slight white head on the beer and slight lacing. The smell is light and floral with a little hop aroma. There is almost a light champagne/sparkling wine aroma to it. The beer is light and crisp with a mild graininess to it. The end is hop bitterness and full of perfume like flavor and flowery goodness. There is maybe a little citrus flavor in there from the hops as well. The MF is very crisp, clean, and carbonated. I usually don't like beers that are this carbonated, but it works very well for this beer. This is, overall, very good stuff. I am not too well cultured in Saisons, but I have had a few, and this one is my favorite so far."
""
"O: This is a delicious saison; the quintessential saison: fruity, dry, musty, grassy, a little funky, awesome"
""
""
"O- Not a bad beer. The aroma, flavors, and color are all impressive considering the lightness of the beer, but I am not overly impressed with it. I might be style biased, but I think this one is just a touch overrated."

"375ml bottle from Pick’s poured into a snifter. Pours a very cloudy dark gold with about 3 fingers of thick frothy white head. Aroma of light citrus fruits and some nice peppery spice. Taste is light bitter. Mostly citrus and spicy hops. Very dry, almost reminds me of champagne yeast. Light bodied with a thin texture. Fizzy carbonation and not much of a finish. Overall,not bad. Very drinkable but not really special. I have to disagree with Men’s Journal calling it ""the best beer in the world"". It would probably be great for drinking outside on a hot summer day, but not so much in the middle of a cold winter."

"O: very good beer; we'll drink it more often."
""
"Overall: A very solid Saison. Pretty fruity but there is a good balance between the sweetness and dryness."
"As a relative ""novice"" to funky and sour Belgian ales, this was a great introduction. I've had several American versions of Saison's and nothing comes close to this. But I guess that's the point. They all give their own interpretation of the original Belgian Farmhouse ales that are just fantastic. I cannot wait to delve deeper into this style of beer, especially the Belgian versions."

"Taste is a little heartier. Lots of good hay and yeast. Pears are more muted. Sweeter and less dry than some saisons. Spice is not obvious. Creamy but light."

"From the caged, corked green bottle. Sampled on December 17, 2011. The cork explodes off the bottle and flies into the next room and the foam erupts out of the bottle. The pour is cloudy yellow with a tremendous long-lasting foamy head. The aroma is a nice mixture of yeast, light grains, citrus, and a pleasing hop bite. Very typical of a Belgian Farmhouse. The body is light to medium but also creamy. The taste has a dash of pepper mixed in with the light malts and vaguely sour finish. It is too bad they don't put it in a brown bottle."
""
""
"Not super complex; an easy intro to the style and one many wine drinkers may appreciate. Would be a great everyday drinking beer if the price was a little lower. This one has been around forever and is style the standard for the style and better executed than many of the contemporary saisons on the market these days."

"SD is very nice to drink and has the right balance of flavor and weight. This is a beer that you could drink all night and enjoy every sip."

"O: It's damn good. ""Best Beer in the World"" might be a bit bold...but I can't find much I would change."
"O: Why the green bottle? I'm guessing this might be a good beer if I had it on tap, but as it was delivered, it reminded me of a Euro Pale Lager that's been sitting in a green bottle for too long. My father-in-law, who was drinking Spaten directly from said green bottles, kind of liked this. Which says a lot."

"o - Overall a great saison; one of the better ones I've had. I found the taste was pretty heavy on pepper and spices, so if you like that in saisons, you'll probably love this one. Not as funky as say Fantome Saison, but considering how easily available this is, well worth buying."
"I used a gentle pour as per the brewery who I e-mailed for directions. They like the lees to remain in the bottle as long as possible, if not infinitely. My motto since childhood has been ""Waste not, want not"" and so I usually reserve that last pout for yours truly. I poured into a champagne flute from the Seabee Ball in 1998 and damned if it did not look like champagne. It was a golden-yellow color under a puffy head of bone-white head that slowly fell, leaving a touch of lacing in its wake. The effervescence was unending and I just gazed at its beauty, enthralled. The nose was fruity in a berry field sort of way with an underlying mustiness of newspapers stored in the attic. Mouthfeel was thin-to medium and the flavor was initially vinous, giving way to a dusty, musty tartness. Holy spit in the ocean, Batman! This was deelish and I could totally see it as the champagne toast at my never-to-be wedding since no one will ever have me as more than an amusing lover. Finish was bone-dry and I think that this might act as a nice panty peeler. I must try it out on some femmes in the near future ..."

"O- A well made classic Saison. There may be some out there that I enjoy me more, but this is a good example of a classic Saison. Worth trying."
"A very solid saison. Definitely on the earthy/pungent/spicy side, but with enough fruit to brighten things up. It's a great example of the level of complexity that can be achieved with saisons. There's a whole lot going on, but none of it knocks you over. And it's one of the prettier beers I've encountered."
"A good beer for pungent cheeses me thinks."
"O: A good shot. Representative of the style. Easy to drink (good carbonation, no excessive bitterness, low alcohol), but not watery and really flavorful. The (slight) funky aspect may surprise while looking for something more fruity however. Overall, a beer to consume on regular basis."
"O: This was a great tasting beer (and my first saison!). The funk was a little odd at first but once I got used to it (about halfway through) I realized I really liked it! Good stuff!"
"A very simple yet sophisticated beer to go along with light meals."
"Beers like this really make me appreciate the style. I wish there was a bit more alcohol, but this is a solid beer."
"This is the standard bearer of the style and it didn't let down. A more classy saison with the aromas really making the beer. It's a more fresh style and its very good"
"I like this beer quite a bit. However, I will naturally downgrade anything that's this noble and Saazy. That said, this beer is still quite interesting and I'm happy to have it. I don't think it's the best saison I've had (I prefer Boulevard, Brooklyn and maybe Hennepin from what I've had), but it's definitely an interesting entry for my beer palate."
"O: I am always a fan of the saison style, and this is certainly no exception. Easy drinking, very refreshing and brings a lot of flavor. Certainly worth a finding a bottle or two. or three.."
"Mouthfeel is crisp. This beer has a great amount of flavor going on as well as being very refreshing and easy drinking. I could put a couple of these down."
"O: This is my first experience with farmhouse ales and I really enjoyed it. Hope there are many more to come."
"D - Great beer, one of my favorites."
"O: Excellent example of farmhouse ale. Not my favorite style but must be appreciated for what it is. Very drinkable. Enjoyed it."
"Great Beer!!!"
"T/M - Nice and balanced carbonation at every sip.. truly refreshing. Ever so slightly bitter but then, and I'm sure it has something to do with what I am eating (mostly potatoes and green beans), it opens to a lovely, creamy mouthful and taste. Nothing lingers, again, making for a really refreshing beverage."
"O: Truly excellent, super easy to drink, a beer to be savored and among my favorites"
"Overall very enjoyable to drink - something I will definitely seek out in the future!"
"Overall: a standard saison. Neither memorable or forgettable."
"O- I finished my 330ml really quickly, you just can't retrain from such great drinkabilty. An amazingly easy, but somehow deeply complex beer"
"This is a really nice Saison, the pour was a golden color with some haziness to it with a white head on top that left a nice lacing on the glass. The smell of the beer was of some sweet fresh grains and hints of wild flowers and honey. The taste was on the sweet side as well and made this very enjoyable in my opinion. The flavors come to life as the beer warms also. The mouthfeel was smooth and light but had enough body to it be enjoyable. Overall a really nice brew here, sure to please."
"It was hard to finish. Again, perhaps I got a bad or old bottle. I'll try it again when I see it and perhaps give a different review."
"Medium bodied with lots of tight carbonation up front giving way to some zesty spice, bread and earthy/funky saison yeast. Slight vegetal presence with hints of grass, hay, straw and soil followed by bread, apple and other light fruit notes. Slight champagne like effervescence that lingers before settling into a sweet and slightly tart, dry finish. Complex and well balanced with an excellently masked ABV resulting in an extremely quaffable beer. Possibly the best example of the style."
"O- A very cool and interesting beer. The alcohol is well hidden and the dryness keeps you coming back for another taste. I wish I had bought more of this over the summer. This would have made plenty of lazy days in the sun that much better."
"Popped open a 750 ml, poured into a tulip glass. Beautiful white head, impressive carbonation bubbling up through it's light golden hue. Effervescent nose. Honey like sweetness, that is balanced by the beers CO2 level, which, tingles on the tip of the tongue. Very pleasant, especially on a late summer evening, right when you can sense the fall is coming. Could possibly define the style, at least for me."
"Have not had much experience with saison but this will make me rethink that. Superb drinkability."
"O: I like this beer a lot more than I thought I would. It isn't my favorite style, but I see why people pick this up -- it is clean and complex with a effortless lightness that makes it a pleasure to drink."
"Overall a perfect introduction to the style, without a shocking sour or seriously funky jarring front. A different animal on tap compared to its green bottled brother."
"O- one of the best beers I have ever had. After trying this, I feel bad I waited so long to pick this offering up. Fantastic beer."
"O- A very solid brew, and a classic example of the style. That said, not my favorite and there are better values out there that I like better."
"Pretty refreshing but I’m not impressed with the cooked vegie taste."
"O - Very good and refreshing, I'll come back to this"
"Beautiful, translucent, golden yellow hue, with 2 finger head that dissipates slowly. Plenty of streams of carbonation that rise to the top. Leaves nice lacing. Yeasty, citrusy smell and I get a hint of oak. The taste is fruity, some banana, some raisins and green apple that ends dry. Light mouthfeel that is well carbonated. Overall, one of the best saisons I've had. Perfect for a summer's day. I would get this again but for $20 a 4 pack, it might not be too often."
"A pleasant sweetness is the first taste, followed by the Belgian rasp. Rather bitter aftertaste. Light body but nice carbonation on the tongue. Thirst-quenching and intriguing flavor, but nothing too wild. A thinner, sharper style of Saison. Hoppy bitterness gives a nice edge. Textbook Saison of the Belgian style."
"A very nice summer beer."
"This pours a hazy straw / pale yellow color with a large foamy head with good retention. The smell is slightly metallic or as another reviewer put it burnt rubber. Under that you get a nice sweet smelling smell, a little banana. The taste is pretty good, I do get a little banana, some peppery spices and a nice dry long finish. The feel is medium to light, lots of carbonation. Overall not bad something I'd probably try again."
"Despite being less fruity and tart than expected, still a nice, refreshing beer marred only by (IMHO) by a slightly overenthusiastic bitterness."
"Noting the high praise this saison received, I have trouble fathoming such a bad experience. I could not recommend this saison to another person unless of course I had a better experience with a future bottle. However, I would not buy that bottle with my money."
"D/O: Light, and crisp, this is extremely easy drinking and definitely deserving the title of one of the top-tier Farmouse Ales."
"O: Saison style, here I come! I absolutely love this beer; if the others of this style are along these same lines, I’ll be more than happy to dive right in. Note to self for next time, though: buy a bigger bottle!"
"I have been told that Saison Dupont is the beer that you must judge every other Saison by. I would have to agree. The first thought when I opened was this beer was ""Did I just open a dime bag""(Friend's comment). Again agreed. The beer is cloudy and had an average appearance. To be honest it looks like any cloudy wheat beer. The taste was what set this apart. Hints of lemon, but the rind part. Overall a solid beer."
"O - I find this beer to be very refreshing and a good example of the style. I am not sure I would search this out while looking for a Saison but it was certainly a good beer."
"Beer just doesn't get any better than this at 6.5% in my view. A veritable cacophany of aromas and flavours that work in unison brilliantly."
"O: Very drinkable Saison with an excellent appearance."
"This beer pours a hazy yellow straw color with a huge white head. The smell was the low point of the drinking experience be wise it was in a green bottle and had a heinekin esk smell. The flavor was good lightly spicy and earthy. The mouthfeel was light bodied and very high carbonation, when I was pulling out the cork I did not have a good grip and when I gave it a quarter of a turn it shot out and ricochet from the kitchen through the dining room and into the living room. Overall it's a good beer just not the best for the style"
"Overall Impression- All-around a good Saison but there are many more of these out there! Refreshing and highly carbonated, this one grabs your attention for the beginning of the drink but then finishes weak. Still will promote but am going to only be able to give this one a 4.0."
"O: This is a refreshing Saison. Not overly complex, but quite thirst quenching. Would enjoy more of these on a warm day."
"Overall an interesting brew and the most common Saison available."
"o: an excellent beer, cant believe i waited so long to try this."
"The mouthfeel has medium body with strong carbonation. The finish is dry and crisp. Perfect for summer. I can easily see why this often considered among the top brews in the world. "
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied, very crisp and clean with good amounts of carbonation, as evidenced by the head and the pop of the cap. Overall, this is a good brew. Easy to drink, flavorful and easy to enjoy. Something that I can see non-beer geeks enjoying, yet something we all like as well."
"Fairly tasty and pretty boisterous. I have had some tame Saisons, I think beer companies that produce the style are afraid to produce them true to form...Dupont is unafraid."
"O: Very drinkable, perfect for the hot summer day I bought it on. The sour dryness, light fruit and high carbonation definitely make it easily quaffable. I've had a little mixed success with this beer before, some bottles being better than others, but overall it is a unique and enjoyable exemplar of the style."
"O- absolutely fantastic. Perfect for a warm summer day"
"375 ml. 2010 bottle aged in my basement. Carbonation resembling champagne. Crystal clear straw color with white head. Smells of zesty Belgian yeast, and pilsner malt - has a nice clean aroma. Well balanced simple flavors, dry/crisp finish. Light graininess into a peppery/lemon yeast character. Impressive looking, easy drinking beer. Lots of subtle flavors. They are good in the summer, I seem to drink a couple every year."
"Overall – There is definitely a lot going on with this beer in the taste and smell department. It's up there with one of the best smelling beers I've had so far. Very fresh and aromatic. I was surprised at how tart the flavour was at first, but it really grew on me as I progressed through the bottle. It's a fantastic beer that is a must try."
"Overall: Saison is not my go-to style by any means, but this had a refreshing flavor, a nice complexity, and some hop power to boot. Definitely worth drinking on a warm summer day."
"Mouthfeel was as SMOOTH as I've ever tasted beer before. I could drink this all day long...my new favorite beer. BUY THIS BEER."
"This beer is refreshing, perfect for a hot summer day, light floral hops balance out the yeast, the malt bill is secondary, but everything comes together to something great. Finishes dry and peppery, leaving me wanting more and more."
"O- i liked the taste of the beer a lot. i with that i would have gotten a bottle with less of a skunked smell to it. ill pick it up again from a different store to see if my luck changes."
"O: Decent beer, but again, boring. Would not have again. Recommended to people who ""don't like saisons."""
"Has an excellent mouthfeel. Very light and refreshing. Overall a very great beer; one that lives up to expectations."
"D: Excellent farmhouse ale that is complex, well-balanced, and very flavorful.  Really easy to put down and really, really enjoyable.  An excellent brew to have on this blazingly hot summer day.  "
"D ~ A great Saison that I could & would drink everyday. I really need to try one fresh, as the exploding cork definitely knocked off some major points for me. Sad because it really is the perfect Saison; Easy to put down on these hot summer days, but with enough kick to make one want to savor. Standout & Stand-alone representation of the style."
"overall a great beer, too bad I don't have regular access to it, I wish I could drink it more often. Definately one that I will search for again and enjoy."
"Overall: Nice beer. Will drink this one again"
"price point - $6.99 for a 750ML bottle"
"Overall the balance of this beer within the style is amazing. Nothing is overbearing making it an easy drink and just damn good. A perfect summer flavor."
"O- Very few beers have made me react as immediately and as strongly as Saison DuPont. God, this is brilliant. I can't imagine a finer July evening sipper. I'm jonesing for a salmon steak or something."
"O: I really like it. It came highly recommended and I can see why. A nice fruity sour kick which is great on a hot day during the summer."
"M-light and smooth"
"Overall - Fantastically refreshing beer. Perfect for summer."
"A fairly good saison but too pricey for the size and quality."
"No doubt a good beer, but after the marked hype around it being world class, I'm not sure I can agree."
"Overall a pleasing belgian but not on the level of a Trippel for my palate."
"Easy to see how this is the benchmark of the style. This drinks amazingly well."
"Poured a light cloudy yellow with a huge white fizzy head that was mostly diminishing but did leave enough residue to have fair lacing. The aroma was of a straw like malt, a nice dose of floral hops and a moldy yeast with notes of citrus and some spices. It tasted mildly bitter and acidic with hints of citrus and clove at first and finished a bitter-sour with a strong wheat note and with a nice dose of hops at the end. Mouthfeel was light in body and dry in texture with a rather fizzy carbonation. Overall a nice fit for the style, one of the better Farmhouse Ales I have tasted."
"Overall a must try for anybody especially those new to the style. Solid beer all around but again not spectacular out of this world level."
"Overall, I'm glad I tried it. A decent saison that I would probably try again if I can find it. However, there are plenty of American brewed saisons that are more readily available and are just as nice."
"Overall: So far in my relatively young saison career, this is the best I have drunk. It is very well balanced and very easy to drink."
"O - Well, there's not much to not like here.. minus the skunk in the nose, this is one great saison. Sessionable and probably would go with a ton of food that I like..."
"One of the most complex saisons I've tasted. Honey and spice make for a great summery profile. Rep is earned, but loses off the overall for the high-ish ABV."
"O: Solid, light, and very clean. I think this is about as clean of a saison as I've ever had. A sophisticated salad in a glass, versatile with great drinkability. I'm a big fan of this one, but the sophistication might tame the style to the point that it makes a departure. This would be an easy intro to beer styles for a champagne drinker."
"Overall-This turned out to be my favorite by far out of the 3 Saisons I had(Hennepin, Collete). I really wish more saison's came in 4 or 6 packs. Great beer"
"It was a very enjoyable and refreshing beer. Not sure I would pay the crazy cost for the beer again but i am glad to have enjoyed it at least once."
"overall this is a great style of beer and it prompted me to try lots of other examples from other breweries i really like the saison style"
"D: Bad bottle maybe? The floaters cause issues? Overall a cruddy brew. Will make sure to try again later and re-review if needed."
"Drink- Overall, this is a very well done saison, its flavorful, dry and balanced. Flavors are a bit muted and thats the only knock besides the app being a little lacking on head for style."
"Saison Dupont is a classic. No doubt about it. It might not be the world’s best Saison, but it’s definitely up there in the top tier. I’m a big fan of the flashy hop presence and its crisp, refreshing bite. This is a fantastic summer ale if there ever were one. Yeah, the nose could use a little more muscle and the body could be a little bigger. Those are small chinks in its armor though. If you’re in the market for a great Saison, give this one a shot."
"Cheers!"
"Overall: An outstanding brew, completely different from Ommegang's Hennepin, which is the only Saison I've had before this. Both are good, but far apart, and I like this better. This really blew me away on how complex and great it is."
"O: Excellent beer. I was pleasantly surprised. I heard a lot of hype about this beer and read about it in Farmhouse Brews. I think it lives up to the hype. Expensive, but so is every belgian specialty ale. Definitely will drink again."
"Also had this on tap (I think it was on tap) at Father's Office in Culver City. Was better than the bottle I got at Whole Foods."
"A nice saison but I did think the flavors were a bit dialed down. Not saying it was a bad beer I just seem to expect a bit more."
"D - This ain't the standard benchmark Saison for nuthin'!"
"The beer itself looks innocent enough, pouring a nice hazy, bronze-yellow with a healthy puff of head. But it smells like a compost heap. Maybe some lemon notes coming through, but that just makes it smell like compost with lemon on it. It tastes like rotting hay and manure. Seriously like manure. And the aftertaste is of--you guessed it--manure. I've had other farmhouse ales, and they didn't taste like someone added rotted hay and the fecal output of a horse during the brewing process, which is all I really get from this, and there's just no two ways about it. Funk is good, hay is good; I don't mind those qualities in a beer. But not horse crap, seriously. I've tried: I've choked this down on the occasions I've ordered it, but really...not good...quite simply not a good beer. There's no complexity here, and if there is, well, I'm sorry but I just can't detect it within the overbearing manure. I would almost prefer a Bud to this. Sorry. Start bottling it correctly, and then we'll talk higher ratings."
"O: Good saison, not my favority, but I see why people consider it among the standard."
"M - As I could see from the 4 fingers of head that formed during the pour, this is a very well carbonated beer. Not that it is the most vital characteristic of a beer, but specifically regarding a summer variety like the saison, good carbonation accentuates the flavors and quenching freshness very well. Medium body with a somewhat dry finish."
"D - I remember trying this one about 3 years ago and not really liking it. Really glad I gave it a second chance. Great beer."
"O: Saison Dupont is a classic representation of the style, exceeded by only Fantome Saison, in my opinion. Great drinker that is thoroughly enjoyable. "
"O- pretty damn good beer. there's a whole heap going on but still it remains very very well balanced. could easily drink a couple of these on a warm afternoon. impressive."
"Pours an amazingly beautiful hazy golden yellow. Smell is a very nice mixture of bread and yeasty goodness that made my mouth water. Holy shit, I'm excited. The taste is incredible. A mixture of pepper and spices that gives way to dryness that makes me want more. This is one amazing beer. One of the best saisons I've ever had. I'll be trying this one again."
"overall delicious although a tad too sweet. i could however drink this all day and all night."
"D - Complex. The benchmark Saison that others should be judged against."
"O: A great saison that is has a good deal of complexity and balance with a really light and pleasant taste and crisp mouthfeel. As easy drinking as it gets."
"D/O- This would be a great one to share with a bud or two (or girlfriend!) outdoors sittin' around. A real delight and perhaps the flagship of the style."
"O/D- My first saison and I think a great one to start with. Delicious and easy to put down. Try it!"
"I've had Saison Dupont a few times now, and every time has been pretty amazing."
"D: Light, refreshing, complex & flavorful all at the same time. A classic for the style and it shows. Best damn “lawnmower” beer I’ve had in a good long time. Damn skunk though…Faded but never completely went away. It holds this one back a enough to miss another 0.5 on the drinkability and possibly somewhere else too. F N Green bottles."
"Poured from bomber into tulip glass. Pours hazy golden with a huge white head. There is a small amount of fine sediment left in the bottle. The head remains and leaves a small amount of dense lace. The nose has fruity and yeasty notes, along with a spicy component and a good dose of pale malts. The taste is quite dry with a strong alcoholic component and a moderate fruity quality and a hint of spice. Hops are present throughout, without being overbearing. The finish is long and fairly clean with a touch of spice. On the palate it is light-medium in body with a dry texture and average carbonation. Overall, this is a good saison. It is refreshing but complex and balanced at the same time. It has a nice fruity quality and a pleasant dryness throughout."
"Very complex, perfect for the summer, I can't wait to have this one again."
"Overall: Definitely would buy this beer again but not before I tried other Saisons. Incredibly enjoyable but I admittedly would prefer a little more malt character to balance out the hops or alternatively lower the hop level."
"This is a great beer to drink in a session."
"O- Glad I gave this a second chance. Will definitely seek out another."
"O: this is pretty much what I think of when I think of a saison. Delicious."
"O: Just perfect Farmhouse. Perfect beer"
"Poured from a 750 into a tulip glass. Body of the beer is a slightly hazy orange color with a few solids suspended in the beer, some carbonation is visible. After the pour the fluffy head reached to an impressive 1.75 inches. The smell is slightly difficult to describe, I will attribute that to the funk, I do detect notes of lemon and grass. This also smells kind of boozy, but it is something i do not detedt in yhe taste. This is just wonderful to drink on a warm day in the sub, the flavors match the warm weather so well. The beer touches my tongue with a bit of light malty sweetness. As the beer crests my tongue the carbonation lifts it up, letting it crash once more against my palate with a strong taste of lemon that lingers for a bit as well as a bit of spice. The mouthfeel is just as it should be a nice medium body with aggressive carbonation. Overall this is absolutely spectacular, as I have been trying saisons this has been The benchmark against which everything else is compared, and it has fared quite well."
"An absolutely, near perfect, Belgian saison. Seek this one out!"
"One of my favorite brews to drink when it gets warmer out. This one is a real treat! A true classic!"
"O: The prototypical Saison. There's nothing unique about it, but it's flavorful, refreshing, and perfect for a hot day in South Florida."
"I will be enjoying these quite often during the summer months. I'm a big fan of Strong ales, and this is a great break for me, especially when its warm outside."
"Mouthfeel is fizzy, crisp and dry, with a bit of chewy graininess during each mouthful. Overall, very good, very refreshing."
"Excellent for the style, there is a reason this is considered an archetype."
"O: I can understand why this beer is looked highly upon. Quite affordable & quite approachable too!"
"overall, a flavorful, crisp, and refreshing beer. a great summer brew."
"O-One of my favorite beers. I have had it several times now and it still makes me excited when it is first poured into the glass. A wonderful beer that should be tried by any beer enthusiast"
"If you like Saisons get this one. It refreshing and wonderfully complex. Highly recomended."
"From start to finish, this is a wonderful Saison. I'm glad I was able to try such a traditional take on the style. Like nearly every other Saison I've had, it took me some time to appreciate its nuances and complexities and that's pleasurable in itself."
"O: I'm a sucker for Saisons, and this one is quite nice. Very refreshing!"
"Something I would personally drink during the spring and maybe early summer. Also something I would suggest for most people who want try different beers."
"O: I really enjoyed this beer, everything about it was good from the flavor to the price. I would certainly recommend this to someone who is a bit tired of drinking Duvel all the time."
"Light golden color with fine carbonation. Nice lacing, fine bubble trails break after a good swirl. Very attractive and aromatic beer. Smells of grain and lemon zest. Very herbal and earthy, but fresh and citrusy at the same time. Flavor is very nice, upfront and good body and mouthfeel. Carbonation is a bit prickly, but subtle. Citrus fruits and bready malt linger on the finish. Overall a very reliable saison, but for the price range, ill stick with my DIPA's."
"Have to say that I really enjoy this. Probably the best of the style for me. So drinkable and refreshing, but complex at the same time. Definitely will enjoy this again as the weather warms."
"Pours a hazy, golden straw color with a large white head that takes quite some time before it goes down. Scent is nice farmhouse funk with a bit of skunkiness. There is also a lot of fruit and bread aromas. Taste is just like it smells, except with some pleasant bitterness. The citrus really comes through in the taste with the barnyard funk. Some grainy flavors with a nice bitter finish. Mouthfeel is nice and medium-bodied with a smooth, crisp finish. Drinkability is quite high, especially on a warm summer day. Overall, I absolutely love saisons, however, this is not my absolute favorite. It is up there though in the top 10 or 20."
"Overall- I really enjoyed this beer. It isn't often that I like beers this much that taste this light, but the beautiful dry fruity taste was excellent"
"Overall - very interesting and good-tasting brew! This is one of the first times I've actually felt like I was drinking a European brew in the US. Would love to taste this ale fresh!!"
" Finishes real dry and is always crisp with high carbonation... nice! Very drinkable with moderate alcohol, I quite like this one although I would take Fantôme over it. Any day."
"O/D: It's tasty and ""a classic," but better things have been done with the style. Maybe it's different out of a bottle."
"O: A great, great Saison."
"O- A complex beer. Add more funk and sour and this would remind me of the oude gueze I had recently. Looking forward to more saisons. This is worth a try and will have again."
"O: Great beer for a warm summer day."
"This beer pours a hazy late day sun yellow with nice fluffy white head. Some sedimentation, perhaps from the pour job. Smell and flavour are much the same. Lots of fruits, banana, green apple, some white grape and strongest of all lemon rind (both nose and palate). Some background clove spices and pepper along with unmistakable yeast (no surprise there). Nice and light, crisp, refreshing. Overall a good beer especially in the summer."
"Nice, well done, goes well with a moldy Tallegio and hard bread."
"Awesome, one of the classic beers of this style for good reason. Highly enjoyable."
"Highly drinkable and a perfect example of the style, as it is simple with enough subtle yeast complexity to make it worth coming back to."
"Overall I consider this beer quintessential for the style. Nothing overdone and with everything in its place. Worth a shot."
"Overall / Drinkability: When I first poured this and only got a lot of foam I wasn't sure, since the only tastes I was getting were a few drops of sour citrus, but once the beer settled down a bit and I could catch everything, I can see why people rave about this style. Definitely a good beer for a warm spring evening, and it would work really well in the summer. I feel though that I need to have it with food though. By itself it's good....but I keep wanting something to eat with it. Definitely a sipping and savoring beer, despite its warm weather quenching quality. Definitely a good beer that I'll have to revisit sometime."
"Overall: A nice light and easy to drink saison. The green bottle has got to go. Most of The skunkiness faded after a while but just enough lingered to throw the flavor off a bit. Minus the green bottle this beer would be awesome and very reliable."
"Drinkability: Very refereshing and enjoyable; this is an awesome beer. Not quite fantome but widely available."
"Other than that, this is a spectacular beer."
"At the end there was no lacing on the glass. I should continue the great history of this beer by buying another bottle soon."
"Reviewed from notes. 750ml bottle split with buddies. So often I get light struck bottles of this, thank goodness this wasn't one. Perfect stram yellow, just oh so hazy. Tiny bubbles cruise to the top of the glass under a dense whipped cream head. Sheets upon sheets of lacing cascade down the glass. Spicy, zesty and peppery aroma, just a hint of farmhouse. Simple and well presented flavors here backed by a basic malt bill of pils. Grassy noble hops make there presence known and then that great yeast. Spicey and earthy with highlights of citrus and coriander. Real well attenuated, dry. When one gets a good bottle of dupont there really isn't much better."
"Very good farmhouse, easy to drink and tastes great, would definitely seek out again."
"Jumping right back into the Saisons with one of the most well-known examples of the style in Saison Dupont. 750 mL bottle poured into a tulip glass. Light golden color with a fizzy head that forms quickly and dissipates almost as fast. I get a lot of sour tartness in the nose, with a white grape funkiness going on along with some slight skunkiness. This one has been in my fridge since purchase, but I get this earthy basement smell out of it. First taste takes me by surprise, but in a good way. Mouthfeel is nice and dry, with a good, almost sour bitterness. Taste is light and lemony, with some earthy hops giving it a nice musky feel. Towards the end of the drink I get this pepper sweet - almost green pepper - note. This thing would be great on a warm summer day. It's not sweet like other saisons can be, and the bone dry finish literally makes the mouth water. Overall a very nice saison and one I won't be afraid to reach for in the future."
"O - While this beer isn't offensive in any way, it's completely lacking in flavor which makes it hard to believe it's worthy of the high score it's received. That leads me to question whether there's something wrong (besides a little skunk) with this bottle. And for attempt number two at purchasing bottles, neither the DTrain or I will every be buying one again for a re-review."
"M: Very refreshing. Clean and fresh flavours which goes over to a quite dry aftertaste. Highly drinkable, and a perfect summer ale."
"On tap at The Thirsty Monk. What a unique beer. Cloudy green/golden color with a huge lacy head that just doesn't quit. Smells like a farm... tastes like a farm. Grassy/herbal notes all over the place with a little bit of sour and malt in the background. Very smooth and silky in the mouth. Felt like a took a trip on a tractor with this one... the quintessential saison."
"A masterful example of the style; tart, funky, yet well balanced. Complex enough for the connoisseur, but still approachable for the novice. While there are a few saisons I personally prefer to this one, I can't deny Dupont's flagship ale remains a bellwether."
"M_Super dry, makes my cheeks pucker and my tongue tingle."
"Mouthfeel is full despite the lackluster malt profile. Higher carbonation but appropriate for the style. This is not the most flavorful saison in existence, but it is true to style. This is just too boring for my liking overall. I can appreciate how it's a ""perfect"" example of the style, but the traditional style is lackluster for my taste."
"Over all, the beer is good. One of my first Saisons, so maybe I was expecting something more. I think I may have imbibed it too cold, definitely warm up to cellar temperatures before drinking this. I look forward to trying this again."
"O: Overall, this was a terrible use of $8. If it was cheaper the overall score would be better. This beer is just nothing special imo, will not get again."
"It pours a pale straw color, cloudy, with a white head, lots of bubbles. The smell is mostly a musty, mold-like, that kind of follow with the taste, just a bit of malt. It has a dry-medium body with lots of carbonation, very crisp. I enjoyed it very much, but would have like to capture more layers of flavor."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and a bit peppery and overall this is a great verison of the style and a must have for those seeking a saison if a Fantome is not able to be found."
"O - Overall I really enjoy this beer. I've had it on tap a couple times, this was my first out of the bottle. Very good go-to saison."
"Overall, this is the saison that all others are measured. Enough said."
"A darn fine saison if you ask me. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and plan to buy it again."
"This yeasty brew goes great with strong cheeses, and stands up to spicy charcuterie. I can only imagine what this beer would be like if it were available fresh, either from a keg or (for god's sake) even in a dark bottle."
"D- I really dig the dryness of this saison and certainly will come back to it if I'm in the mood for that particular aspect again"
"Drinkability: This is the second saison I have tried, and it has without a doubt redeemed the style for me. Personally, though, I would much prefer hefe or wit. The muskiness turns me off a little."
"Drinkability - The ultimate summer beer. Light bodied, complex, but easy to mentally digest. This is one of the most refreshing saisons that I have encountered. Definitely a leader of its category and a saison to judge all others by. Perfect in my book!"
"I liked this beer very much and would definitely consider picking it up again."
"Extremely drinkable and refreshing, a slight off note that is easily dismissed due to the poor choice in bottle. Would love to get this beer boxed freshed and store cellar a case over a year."
"D: An excellent saison, probably the best in the world. A truly excellent beer."
"D - Very drinkable, fresh, fruity, slightly musky. An excellent (if not the best) example of the style."
"Drinkabilty - Very nice beer. One of the best styles of farmhouse you can find. Smooth and tasty, and easy to drink. Alcohol is only 6.5, so yes, drink up and enjoy this world class beer."
"D - I wish I could taste more in this beer, it goes down easily and is good for refreshment, but not much else. Disappointed."
"The beer is a light gold color, with a short white head that fades slowly and leaves a thin lace on the glass. The aroma is of bananas, spices, Belgian yeast, light malts and a touch of hops. The taste is full of spice and Belgian yeast with a background of bananas. The malt character is thin and there's a mild but complimentary hops presence. The after-taste is spicy and slightly sweet. Crisp and very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, very clean finish. Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is a good beer to drink for a long time, especially if you're in the mood for the style."
"The cpj"
"D: The saison of choice for me. This is the epitome of the style, and should be had before sampling any of the domestic versions."
"Overall, this beer is a must for anyone who loves saisons and the beer is a classic. I could do without the green bottle or maybe get a bottled on date somewhere on the bottle but I can't complain. This is a finely crafted beer and I wholeheartedly recommend. Cheers!"
"D - Pretty high. One of the all time best, I could drink a few of these on a warm summer day no problem. It is light yet still complex and very tasty."
"I loved this and will be back to Good Foods Market in Lexington, KY for more."
"D: A moderately enjoyable beer, but the balance here is too much in favor of this particular yeasty flavor for me to be really excited about having another one soon."
"It is a sturdy beer with a definite taste that you do not have to guess on. It smells and tastes quite bitter, but if you take the time to enjoy it you will. However, if bitterness is not your thing, then this may be too much bite. It had a great gold color with a thick and foamy head and a noticeable amount of sediment in the bottom of the glass. The taste is similar to a strong hefeweizen."
"It would be great to have one of these on a hot summer day, or 7 of these when I wake up on a Monday morning."
"Overall I really thought this was a fantastic beer. Nice four year vintage really helped this and if it was ever really sour it has been significantly mellowed with time and the overall balance of it was really just quite nice. I was glad there were two on the shelf, as this has held up very nicely and it would be a pleasure to have it again."
"D: I have no problem killing this bottle."
"The aroma is inverted for the taste as the citrus is quick ignored for the grass/funk in the beer's finish."
"This is an exceptionally easy drinker, and one that'd be great outdoors in the summer."
"Very drinkable, even with the high level of carbonation. Not too sweet and no notice of alcohol. Best saison I've ever had."
"T: Some nice funk, lemon, citrus and a light sour finish. Probably the best saison I've ever had."
"Overall, this beer is highly drinkable, an awesome example of the style. Nicely balanced, light and refreshing, while not lacking in flavor or complexity. Great."
"The bottles of this always open with an enormous bang, and the carbonation produces such an enormous thick white head that it always amazes me how pleasant the champagne like carbonation is to the palate. The beer pours a very hazy blonde and that huge head of course leaves a beautiful lace. The aroma has just the nicest hint of funk, along with some very earthy, fruity, and yeasty aromas. Everything is just in it's right place with the beer, and you can really tell that this recipe has been perfected over a considerable amount of time. This is not to say that this is a refined beer, because it very much is not, but this rustic nature is part of the great harmony of this brew. The flavor is at once dry and funky followed by pronounced fruitiness of apples and some citrus. There are certainly bubblegum notes but that is not to say that we are dealing with anything cloyingly sweet. Oh and it is hoppy too, the spiciness of the hops albeit is not the dominant flavor but lends well to the harmony of the dry and fruity flavors."
"This is fantastic. Reminds me of a refined version of Hennepin. As much as I love Hennepin (as found by my Hennepin glasses in my collection), this one is better. Not by much, but this is a fantastic saison. I'll buy more of this one for sure."
"Not very familiar with Saison style beers but I really enjoyed the earthy spicy characteristics. I will be drinking this again and would suggest to anyone interested in belgian beer."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D - Great flavor and a super smooth profile. The carbonation is refreshing, and the body doesn't force you to do too much heavy lifting."
"Oh God so many spirits to become! Such mountains to ascend! I am young remember that you devils! I am young but you will not take me now! I have many more Saisons to drink, and I have yet to see the Alps."
"Overall, this beer blew away my expectations and really makes me want to get a few more saisons under my belt. However, out of the 10 or so that I've tried, this one is by far my favorite. Fantastic."
"Again a very dry brew, but refreshing at the same time, and I'm very pleased to have tried this brew."
"Watch out the 6.5% ABV is hidden really well. Tho as it warms up a bit in a glass you start to get a sense for the relatively high ABV. Good stuff here, I'd buy this again, and share it with any one who appreciates good brews."
"In that sense its a little hard to guage this beer.... I think that to style its not a bad beer at all, but I'm really just not a huge fan of the more funky, earthy saisons, as I find myself enjoying ""cleaner"" takes on the style(hennepin, saison de buff for examples sake). So i'd say if you are a fan of this style of saison or beers with a lot of funk notes, go for it. If you're not, this beer is not going to change your mind."
"I can see how it's currently the seventh ranked Saison on Beeradvocate. It's subtle, crisp, and would be even more of a joy on a hot day."
"Overall, this is a good beer. The components a solid and you can enjoy it, but it is hard for me to have more than one."
"Pours a hazy gold color with a finger of foamy head that doesn't linger very long. The aroma is very sweet and the taste mirrors this. The taste is of bubblegum and fruity notes with little to no hoppy notes at all. The mouthfeel is very smooth and it finishes clean. This would be a great beer in the summertime."
"D- Very refreshing Ive seen better mainly from Fantome, I still cant deny this being a solid very drinkable brew."
"I find the score for this beer entirely inexplicable."
"Straw colored pour with some sediment and a gigantic, rocky, white head. The aroma is light, floral, and delicately sweet. There's the classic Belgian esters in the nose which lend light notes of banana, bubblegum and clove but also a hint of phenol that adds a peppery note. I get some faint hints of lemon and orange peel along with a soft, wheaty malt. The flavor is as equally light and delicate as the aroma. There's some slight herbal, floral bitterness balanced out by hints of pepper, cracked wheat, lemon, banana and clove. The body has a medium to thin mouth feel with loads of lively carbonation and a dry, clean finish."
"D-Really superb beer with an amazing level of drinkability."
"D - Alcohol it's wisely balanced by bitter and fruity, so this beer results very drinkable!!"
"D: I can't even begin to describe the drinkability of this guy. I will definitely be coming back to it when the heat and humidity rear their ugly heads."
"D - Super drinkable. Despite a slightly above average ABV, stays super smooth. Very balanced taste and mouthfeel. Very crisp and smooth. Excellent beer."
"M: Slight graininess from yeast."
"Drinkability - Quaffable. A good saison though I would still pick up any of the JP varieties over this."
"A lovely, lulling standard bearer for the style, something one just has to experience, as I'm sure I haven't done it justice via this description. This shows all those upstarts how it's done, how a steady touch can deftly balance all of the subtle, intermingling flavours."
"i am blown away every time i have this one. benchmark awesome. slight haze to the burnt gold color. white head that holds forever and leaves beautiful lace. nose is shining, pure, clean, bready pilsner malt, earthy, floral, herbal hops, citrus, spice, grass, lemongrass, and a funky (but subdued) skunky/pot kind of thing. taste is a superbly balanced melange of all of the above with a dry and peppery finish. fluffy mouthfeel with just enough tingle/prickle to zip it up and add a bit of a refreshing quality. this would be one of my desert island beers. awesome. a timeless classic for real. i never get sick of this beer."
"I was able to try this at a local liquor store and was hooked on this saison ever since. The saison pours well with a good size head, has the cloudy unfiltered look you expect to find. The color is a nice golden color, overall it's a great easy drinking beer."
"Flavor starts with a creamy malt, then a slight spicy tang. Very crisp and dry. Soft and drinkable. Mouthfeel similar to champagne."
"Appearance is a golden cloudy yellow with a darker yellow core. Head is white and rocky that reveals a nice lacing as it disipates. Smells nutty, yeasty with citrus undertones. Tastes dry, sour and nutty with a nice honey filled grassy earthy character. Mouthfeel is bubbly and light with a champagne quality. This is my favorite saison yet! Very tastey I will certainly drink this again....as soon as i can afford another bottle. o.O"
"Saison Dupont is a beer that I will keep enjoying over time. It is so flavorful and refreshing, and is a standout example of the style."
"D: I know this is typically a summer brew, but throwing one down during the first winter snow wasn't the worst idea I've ever had."
"My first saison. 750ml bottle. Pours a hazy golden color with a thin white lasting head. Lively carbonation and nice lacing. Aroma is very complex of spicy hops, biscuit malt, sweet fruit and citrus. Full body, very tangy mouth-feel. Peppery hops on the palate are balanced by biscuit malt and sweet fruit with hints of citrus. Finish is long and complex. Great beer."
"Drinkability: this is the best beer I've had in awhile. Why, oh why, did I buy the small bottle instead of the 750? This beer's balance and complexity make it one of the most drinkable beverages around."
"So drinkable and refreshing. I want to have this after a long hot day working on the farm."
"Golden straw color with good haze. Clean white thick 1"" head at pour settling to a even 1'8"" cover. Very light belgian spice with just a touch of pepper to aroma, pick up some faint lemon. High, fuzzy carbonation, making for a ver crisp finish on the swallow. Tingles the toungue. MAkes for some nice lacing on the glass. Light Malt. Very clean, Light and refreshing mouthfeel. light malty sugar with lemon in aftertaste. Very well done. I like the carbonation left on the back of the tougue at the end. Slight dryness on the finish with pale citrus peel feel. Feeling in the back of your mouth light and tart, could have a bit of a peppery effect. Not really picking up on the big sour that some get, but a great example of style. Seems simple enough while also being complex. very good."
"D: I like it. Would definitely try this one again. Have only had a few Saisons before, but this one seems classic and the best, how a Saison should be."
"Poured into a tulip glass. The beer is deep gold in color, cloudy with a small amount of carbonation. The head was frothy and had great retention and lacing. The nose had a strong aroma of citrus & coriander, hints of grapefruit. The beer is medium-bodied, slightly sour to start, but evens off as the hints of citrus & fruit come forward, finishes with a dry aftertaste. Pretty true to the saison style possibly a bit more sour aftertaste than most. Still an excellent saison."
"Every aspect of this beer improved as it warmed up outside the fridge for 15 minutes or so. Murky, dark, golden yellow with an orange hue. Poured with a big foamy, fizzy white head. Yeast and citrus orange and lemon aromas with a hint of corriander. On the light side of medium bodied with fizzy carbonation and lots of wet lacings. Yeast, orange and lemon flavors in the beginning that lead to a spicy, peppery middle that lingers through the yeasty, tarty/sour finish. Lots of character and easy to drink."
"Cork popped and the bubbly rose as this treat entered my wine glass. Cloudy yellow body with a tall lively head. Crisp, dry citrus and spicy fruits with a little puckering effect on the mouth. If I was disappointed that the pub was out of the Fantome I had ordered, that disappointment quickly faded as I took my first sip of this very drinkable and quite affordable brew."
"D - Very drinkable beer. The flavors are fairly complex but very well balanced. The beer overall is super smooth and refreshing."
"Overall: A very nice saison that is worth the attention it gets."
"D - strong and well balanced in flavour, crispy and smooth, and great looking to boot"
"Saison Dupont has an orange colour and a huge head that lasts a long time. After it was poured I smelled cloves, orange peel and some yeast. This beer has a warm, malty taste with hints of orange peel. It has a spicy clove finish. My bottle was quite carbonated and so it has a nice presence in the mouth. This is a very nice beer."
"glassware: tulip"
"Very tasty and quite drinkable, this is a very good beer that went down easy with no signs of the alcohol and no funky aftertaste."
"Nose breathing sparkling citrus and hoppy beer side, slightly resinous. The mouth is slightly citric with a hint of acidity, but very easy to drink. It perceives a pure hops season which gives a bitter taste and pungent taste and a final subtle grapefruit being a bit like lemonade. The attack is frank yet refreshing with a fruity controlled bitterness and a very convincing finish long and dry. It remains a standard season but extremely well controlled and mostly so easy to drink."
"Maltiness is the first thing that greeted me followed quickly by some tart citrus kinds of character and some other spicy phenols. It finished with a very dry cracker finish that flowed into a surprisingly bitter aftertaste. Really a nice, complex beer that was also remarkably balanced for how complex it was."
"Well done!"
"D: a decent saison, Saison Dupont has light, enjoyable flavors that make it refreshing and great for a hot summer day. I bet this would pair nicely with some apple pie."
"Corked popped off and almost dented my ceiling. Cork says ""2.008"". Poured a lively cloudy yellow straw color with amazing carbonation. Super bubbly, almost champange like. Head was huge and I had to stop pouring or it would have overflowed quickly. This is the second time I've had this brew and it is exceptional. Aroma of orange lemon citrus, grass, fruit. Taste is balanced citrus, fruit and yeast. Dry finish, Medium-thin body. Light and refreshing, super drinkable."
"Overall: Get some. No regrets. Good price."
"very drinkable beer. though not a sessionable beer at 6.5%, it is very refreshing and easy to drink. just as this class of beers was originally created... to enjoy at the end of a long day's work."
"drinkability; tasty and interesting but not a session beer. Best enjoyed after a hard day's work."
"This is one of the classic saisons of the world, and it is tasting very nice from the present bottle. In the past, I may have had some skunked bottles that have tasted much more bitter. This is light, fruity, and just delicious."
"In short: a light, refreshing brew seeking balance between citrusy tartness, hoppy bitterness and spiciness."
"Very nice crisp mouthfeel makes this a perfect warm weather beer. Delicious."
"Had this on tap at Monk's in Philadelphia. Showed a light yellow gold with a frothy white head, great retention and lacing. Smell earthy and grassy, sweet. Medium carbonation, very grassy up front, sweet and fruity from the yeast, dry finish. Great beer, incredibly drinkable."
"I really enjoyed this one. My first try was extremely dull; I'm relieved that I received a good bottle."
"Alcohol level is reasonable, and the beer is interesting and light enough to be sessionable if you could get your hands on several."
"This was more like a white wine to me than a beer. Still very tasty. However, Im not crazy about it being in a green bottle."
"Picked up a 750ML as a treat. Popped the cork and this was almost like opening a bottle of champagne. Poured into a Chimay goblet. It pours a golden orange with an amazing white head. Incredible floral aroma with classic farmhouse funk. Overall this is one of my favorite beers, especially with a great meal, it is amazing in everyway."
"However, it was smooth, dry, and nicely crafted. Unfiltered and bottle conditioned."
"I am sure I'll never get this beer again. It is so far from a style I like it's not funny. This is pretty darn weird flavored, and without the hops there's nothing to save this beer. Thankfully the hops save things. They take a lot of off putting flavors and somehow mix them together. I think I understand why this beer is well ranked, but it just isn't for me. Bottom line, buyer be ware. This isn't a beer for ""advanced pallets"" it's a beer for those that enjoy this style of beer. If you're not one, don't wasn't your money."
"Drinkability: could easily drink this 750 mL by myself. I am sharing with a friend however... I should have been greedy!"
"D- awesome for the decent abv, very refreshing and an obvious benchmark for the style."
"D: I want more, complexity, easy drinking, what more can you ask for."
"D - give me more! clean, refreshing, lively, and yummy. i want this pouring out of sides of my house for hot summer days."
"I love this Belgian Ale. I drink a lot of beers, but do not wind up with Saisons often enough due to location. I think if had my druthers, I would keep kegs of this one around for daily consumption. Masterful work of art here in complexity and drinkability."
"D: I could (happily) drink this all day."
"This beer has a very rustic characteristic to the overall taste and mouthfeel, and even displays a pronounced funk that is typical of an authentic farmhouse ale. It's a dry beer and carries a mouthfeel which reminds me of Champagne. Citrus with peel, floral, grass, a little vanilla, wheat, and a slight hint of stone gravel which keeps it dry. It's a very drinkable and refreshing ale during the summer months."
"Pours a slightly hazy gold with a towering white head and incredible legs as it makes its way down my tulip. Smell is quite a bit of unrestrained funk and earth. Some floral character makes its way in as well. Quite complex and seems to come from many different angles. The taste isn't quite as well integrated and complex, with some notes pushing a bit too far ahead, but still quite tasty. Well carbonated and beautifully dry, this drinks quite well. The epitome of the style."
"Overall- I use this one as my classic saison to compare everything else too. Though everything else seems to fall short of this! Very well balanced, not to sweet up front, not to dry on the finish, yet subtly complex. Great brew."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, and especially refreshing. Initially, I felt a little underwhelm by this offering, but as I continued with the bottle, the flavors grew on me. I found it to be great with food, such as pasta or chicken or salad."
"Drinkability -- Pretty good. Don't get me wrong, this is a wonderful beer, and certainly *the* textbook example of a Saison, but I didn't excite me or change the way I see the style as the talk around it would suggest. Great beer, must try, but keep your expectations grounded."
"A really perfect beer for a summer or even early fall day, the Dupont is a very credible, easy to find saison."
"Pours a beautiful hazy golden blonde with a rocky white head that hangs around through. Excellent lacing. Aroma is quite complex, more funk than I anticipated. Spicy, mostly white pepper. Lemongrass may be more prominent though. Flavor is outstanding, changes throughout the bottle both as the beer warms and as I pour the last yeast-laden dregs into it the glass. Just wonderful. Tart, spicy, herbal and a hint of lemongrass. Finishes bitter and dry. The most surprising aspect to me was how creamy the first sip was, which I attribute to the carbonation. Just a wonderful beer that I'll have any time I see it."
"My favorite is still Saison D'Erpe-Mere."
"The lingering impression is the softness, and a sense of well-balanced, and subtle, quality and drinkability. It's not a bold beer, but one which seduces you..."
"The first sip is worth the wait; fruity, crisp, herbal, earthy, slightly tart, dry, not much malt, bitter finish. It's a very complex, full-flavoured and well-balanced beer. Some beers will have a lot going on as this one does but they'll be a mess - all over the place with no cohesion. This one pulls it off and does so in spades. Really, really well done."
"Probably all too easy to drink, even with an ABV of 6.5% that's completely hidden."
"Truly a great beer. Refreshing and so darn easy to drink."
"D: Probably the best Saison I have had yet... hands down."
"Pours slightly cloudy bright yellow with a voluminous off white head of tightly packed bubbles. The head erupts up from the liquid to make a beautiful towering pillow of rocky foam, and leaves beautiful lace in its wake. The Aroma is wonderful. Fruity and funky with a pleasant graininess. Green apple, pear, citrus, a perfume of floral and herbal aromas and white pepper all mingle in my nostrils. The flavor seems to be both delicate and robust at the same time. It has a tart and slightly lactic attack that gives way to a wonderful grainy malt profile. Herbal hops and notes of pear and citrus also mingle about in my mouth. Peppery spice and lemon grass are also there, and I find it hard to describe all the flavors as they seem to transform as I sip. The body is on the light side of medium and mouthfeel is full of carbonation. It is a bit tingly on the tongue, but at the same time it's also smooth. Super drinkable and super delicious. The first time I bought this beer it was skunked and it scared me away for awhile, but tasting it now, I think it is worth the risk."
"Drinkability is very good given the abv. The dryness also helps and keeps you wanting more"
"A nice bubbly medium weight feel in the mouth. Smooth and crisp, perfect for a summer afternoon. Overall a very enjoyable summer saison that deserves to be right up there with the best of them."
"this is a really great authentic saison, but just fell a little short of my expectations. i will definatly revisit this again however."
"I really enjoyed this beer. A perfect pair for the hot weather today. I now understand why this is considered by many the quintessential saison."
"Very well balanced beer, very refreshing, and lives up to its original goal of being a good summer beer. The way a sip of this beer can cleanse your palate, this would go very well with bbq."
"Outstanding drinkability, i don't think I could ever have enough of this. Get this if you can you will not regret it, you'll drink it again and again."
"The aroma was fairly mild, though after uncorking the bottle, I caught a whiff, and was intrigued. Vinous, woody, yeast, and a hint of fruit, though I couldn't put my finger on specifics. At first taste, I was a little disappointed though. Reminds me of a hefe than a saison (although as I said earlier, my experience with saisons is limited). A little spiciness, the usual funkiness, a little fruitiness, though I was expect more of a hop profile. Don't get me wrong, I can't really find any real faults with the beer, but I'm having trouble seeing the greatness in it."
"Drinkability: Tasty, complex, and refreshing. Easy drinking. Comes in a sharing size bottle, but is just as well a single serving."
"Pours a very nice slightly orange but mostly yellow color with a big foamy head and a nice light amount of lacing. Aroma Has a slight tinge of spunkiness to it. Bitter lemon and some spicy white pepper come through. Also has a big lemony oily aroma that is intriguing. ReaLoy floral flavors with some rose pedal, white asparagus and some pink peppercorns on the tip of the tongue. Has a nice bitter mid palate and subtle sweetness on the finish to balance out this saison. Slight skunky notes of hot rubber and some bacon fat but still tasty. These green bottles need to go. The mouthfeel is very nice, smooth carbonation and crisp finish. Food friendly also. Drinkability falls just above average for me because it's not the most delicious beer but with the occasion and meal this works."
"Sheer elegance. Try to make sure and get a fresh one, or at least one from the back of the shelf as far away from light as possible, I think it can skunk a little."
"750mL corked bottle poured into a tulip glass. Great appearance: hazy deep golden color with a massive white head that has excellent retention. Funky aroma with earth, mustiness, yeast, and citrus. The flavor has yeast and citrus with some spices and a little earthiness. Well carbonated, fairly light body, and a dry finish. Very drinkable, this is a great saison."
"Carbonation level is moderate-to-high, but this beer doesn't feel harsh in any way. The finish is actually quite mellow and smooth. I notice some white pepper in the flavor along with some tart yeast, slightly puckering fruits, and mild wood notes on the back end. This is a great Saison. Took me much too long to try this one. Great beer."
"Drinkability: I really like saisons, and I really like this saison. As I had heard, this is the benchmark of the style. I cannot believe I put off buying this beer for so long..."
"Mouthfeel is very smooth and crisp Drinkability is very good. A very well balanced combination of tartness and carbonation makes for a very refreshing drink on a hot day."
"Pours a light hazy pale yellow color with a big white head. In the aroma, lemon zest and yeasty. In the taste, dry yeastiness and lemon zest, with a sweeter barnyard like earthiness. A smooth and light bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry lemon yeastiness to a clean aftertaste. Clean and refreshing, nice blend of citrus and earth."
"D- Refreshing and easy to drink. A great beer for the summer time."
"D: A true classic. What a wonderfully refreshing and crisp beer. Great complex flavors are bold but not overwhelming. Not much to detract from this great beer!"
"D- Amazing. I'm glad I found this and bought it on a whim. I was not disappointed in the least with this impulse buy. Get it when you find it. The only downside is the price."
"not an every day drinker, but i thoroughly enjoyed this 750ml bottle."
"D: Not an over the top Saison, but a very good one none the less. I feel I may have gotten a bad bottle, so I am hoping to get another and hope that this skunky taste is a aftermath thought. I will try again and hopefully edit my reveiw. This is how it stands as of now."
"T: smooth beer and no hint of 6.5 abv, easy as hell to drink a full 750 solo"
"D: This is a wonderful beer overall and a great introduction to the saison style. The flavor is just a bit more subdued than others I've tried, but it's also more balanced and showcases more of the farmhouse funk I look forward to in a saison."
"D- very tasty brew"
"Future outlook: Happy to have again, and would like to try with some age on it."
"Had this on draft at Ormsby's in Atlanta GA. I've had it plenty of times in the bottle as well. It pours with nice hazy yellow golden color with a good amout of head. It has nice a nice crisp flavor with a touch of floral and fruitness and with a bit funky sour yeasty flavor (but it's very balanced). Overall it's very dry and crisp and delicious."
"A highly drinkable example, their seasonal version with a higher abv punches through the flavor profile, but this version is the year round choice with only a few contenders, - highly recommended."
"Served from a 750 ml bottle. Pours a semi-opaque golden with a substantial head that persists leaving about a one inch layer of foam and significant lacing. Aroma is not overpowering, and features a very pleasant hops tartness and green apples upfront, with notes of maltiness present in the background. Taste features more muted tartness and green apples, along with a bit of ""barnyard"" presence. Decent mouthfeel, featuring a restrained level of carbonation. I'm not overly familiar with this particular style, or Belgian products in general, but I'm impressed by its smoothness, and excellent drinkability."
"D. I could probably put back to 750mm bottles without breaking a sweat. This is one of the more perfect beers for all occasions."
"Saison Dupont is a standout Belgian beer not just for its taste and quality, but also because it characterizes the nation itself--never straying too far into one camp (whether it be funk or sweetness, Flanders or Wallonia), it somehow travels down the middle in an impressive balancing act."
"Overall, a very hoppy and earthy saison that is very straightforward and refreshing, and really keeps to style and purpose: a refreshing beer to soothe the soul after a long and hot day at work."
"D - Outstanding, just a really amazingly easy to drink beer. So refreshing and a perfect way to end another scorcher. Clean, crisp, everything I would want in a saison."
"D: Easy to drink and refreshing; not too sour. Has an interesting and striking balance."
"Drinkability: An often overlooked Saison by me, but for the price and everyday availability, this is a real gem. This beer goes down great on a hot day such as today or even a cold winter evening."
"Exceptionally drinkable, might be the combination of today's heat and the refreshing, dry nature of this beer. I don't typically like to give 5's, but I don't see how a beer could be any more drinkable. Best Saison I've had yet."
"cheers"
"D: The beer is very refreshing and relatively easy to drink. It's a perfect beer for the summer months."
"High carbonation, dry, light bodied, and refreshing. I enjoyed this beer a lot."
"Not A- good, but a very nice beer, none the less."
"The taste is very lively, with some of the orange/lemon flavors coming back, as well as some thick yeastiness. The back end is very dry, with a moderate level of bitterness. The body is very dry, with an appropriatley high level of carbonation. This beer is fun to drink, and is a champ with food."
"d: I found the perfect saison at long last."
"D- An excellent beer to cleanse the palate or just sip on a hot day."
"D- With its dry and complex flavor, I want to think this has a higher ABV than it really does. Knowing that, I could easily down several on a nice hot day."
"what a great beer! seems to be some inconsistency between bottles. I think it can be attributed to poor handling in shipping. always a great beer, but some bottles seem to be better than others."
"a classic character that hit every good quality of a saison in one form or another. very middle of the road in possible flavors... from the very musty farm herbal to the very fruity spice. nose is funk, and belgian yeast. nice traditional look of straw murky... even from a tap. palate of very delicate sweet with floral qualities. some citrus that transforms with the help of the must into something bitter dry. but mild. anise, and lavender... the bitterness of grass. the sweetness of roses... the must of hot straw in the barn. great. a must."
"D: A nice mouthfeel and taste combination that was nice for the style. A nice Saison overall that was crisp and a nice beer to have on a cooler, summer night."
"Decent saison, but fairly tart and bitter. I still like Hennepin best and look forward to trying a Fantome in the future."
"Pours a golden yellow with a monsterous poof of soapy, foamy white head, minutes go by before i can finnish the pour. Scent is of bready yeast, hints of grahmn cracker, grassy, lemmony, spicy and herbal hops all present in the nose. Taste is slightly less agressive then the scent dictates, but still bold fr the style. The grassy, lemmony, spicy and herbal hops dominate the palate while a backbone of nice bready yeasts and clean malts provide the backbone... a touch of alcohol and some muddled, earthyness pop up from sip to sip. For all the carbonationation, the beer stll has a slight bit of body to it, nice, clean and dry finnish with a slight herbal aftertaste. A very nice and complex saison, one i would love to try again."
"750 from WF Clarendon, paired with fresh parsley tarragon pasta, andouille sausage, and squash"
"Overall this is a very complex beer that is refreshing, dry and extremely complex. I have had many bottles of this and since it is bottle conditioned each one is different, though quite good."
"The beer is nicely drinkable. I'd say that it would go very well with simple fare, like your standard burger and fries, or perhaps a chicken parm sub."
"jd"
"D: Very light and fluffy. Slightly sweet up front, drying out and becoming tart and a bit chalky in the finish."
"Excellent beer."
"BRAVO!"
"Pours cloudy pale golden with frothy head. Aroma is a quite fresh bouquet of anise, cloves, juniper, peaches, rosewater, and grass. Flavor has a clean character, with notes of lemon; slightly astringent, with a mild hop flavor, and a lightly sour finish. These combine for a refreshing character. Great summer (or anytime) beer!"
"D - Drinks pretty well, but for some reason couldn't bring myself to do #2."
"Definitely a must try for a fan of the style. I think I paid $9 for the bottle and consider that a deal."
"Amazing pour and color as well. I've had a few of the American brewers version of a farmhouse ale, and this is a whole different ballgame. I want more."
"Even a deliberately delicate pour on this fresh bottle of hazy gold brew leads to a vigorous bright white head, taking several moments to settle into a manageable frothy cap that endured the entire session and produced intensive lacing waning to some lingering patches as the glass wares down. An herbal spicy aroma leads to a pleasantly moderate mix of malt and hops, sweet at first with a touch of sour citrus and mild bitterness finishing the flavor. Not terribly strong nor tremendously interesting, yet absolutely delicious all the same! Quite well suited for its intended purpose, a hot summer's day."
"Notes: Awesome summer/hot weather beer, completely enjoyable, and I imagine that this would pair very well with seasoned chicken or spicy food."
"Very drinkable, drank the whole 750 mL bottle myself, light bodied and tasty. There was a slight warming from the alcohol. From what I've heard, Saison's should typically have less alcohol, but that didn't stop me from drinking this!"
"Notes: This and Hennepin are two of the ""best"" (highest rated) saisons I have had. However, they are very distinct. Where Hennepin is almost dark and earthy with spicy notes, this is bright floral and almost fruity at times. This beer drinks exactly like the bottle says, starts floral and fruity and finishes light. This is definitely a great beer and if you like bright saisons, it is a must try."
"D - Quite quaffable... Easy drinking... A classic textbook Saison... Proves to be an excellent value as well..."
"Overall, this reminds me A LOT of Sam Adams' Summer Ale, but with a little less spice, and more must. No need for me to have that or this again. Smuttynose's Farmhouse Ale is something I would get if I'm in the mood for a saison."
"Hazy golden body with carbonation showing itself with a big foaming head. It actually falls pretty quickly. The color is really nice. In the aroma, this one is all about the yeast and letting it shine. Nose is distinctly funky Belgian - it has that earthy barnyard aroma with a nice fruitiness, including pear and apple. The taste actually has a nice crisp maltiness holding it together with the yeast playing a more subtle role, adding some light fresh fruitiness. Carbonation is on the higher side, but really makes it refreshing. Plenty of body for a beer this dry. A subtle raw earthiness to it. Everything in the flavor is subtle, light and refreshing, yet delicious. Pretty hard to find a better summer beer than this."
"Conclusion: So glad to have finally gotten to try this. This and Hennepin are the two best saisons I've ever had. Which is better? I'd have to try them side by side I think."
"2014 rereview. Pours a hazy light amber with thick creamy white head that lasts for a while with rings of thick lace down the glass. Smell: dried sugared pineapple, nectarine note, candied lemon, lightly doughy, minerally, with herbal and cardamom notes. Taste: dried pineapple, dilute lemon, light cracker and sugary base with a lightly spicy and grassy hopping. Light-medium body, very creamy feel with a lightly sticky but drying and minerally finish. This is excellent and I should be picking this up more often."
"M/D: Great mouthfeel, very crisp. This is a great warm weather beer, perfectly balanced."
"D: This beer is amazing. I could drink it all night. It's only 6.5% and I can get it relatively cheaply for imported beer. Such a good summer session drink. Wow. The flavours are so balanced- complexities come along with fruity moreishness. 5"
"D-this is very easy to drink and so tasty. nice complexity with a great balance."
"D - Very enjoyable, but I'm glad I only had 1 750ml bottle. I'm glad that I tried it, but for the price ($8.99) I probably won't be purchasing this one again soon."
"Medium-high carbonation and a very light mouthfeel. Dry taste dominated by Belgian yeast and some nice banana sweetness with a bit of lemon on the finish. Light, balanced, and just a hint of funk to keep things interesting. Wasn't bowled over the first time I tried it, but this saison has really grown on me the last couple times."
"D - Eh, I thought good at first, but now that I'm down to the end, I'd want it over soon. It's good, very dry. It loses points here because the carbonation's making me a little too burpy."
"Drinkability: A true sipper that fills your mouth and finishes wonderfully. Easy to drink a bomber by yourself. A fantastic farmhouse that I will definitely drink again."
"This is a very earthy, crisp, & dry Saison. For me this makes drinkability through the roof! The yeast is the cornerstone on this beer, with the spicy bitterness being the bricks and the sour dryness being the mortar. Although there is a lot more going on with this complex beer. A stellar beer. I wish I could get them in a six pack."
"D: This is a good Saison, although the hype is not all it's meant to be. Very drinkable, and worth a try. It's sure to quench any thirst."
"Pretty good saison, although I think I lean more towards those that end somewhat sweet...this one is a bit too dry in the finish for me, but still a very fine beer overall..."
"D: I need to drink this beer more often, it's a very solid saison."
"M, D- I wish there was more of a malt structure to complement the spectacular aroma, but the drinkability will be great for those who like the drier finish. CO2 was ideal."
"pours a slight hazy golden straw color with a hugh fluffy white head that recedes slowly to leave lots of clinging lace.. its light smelling in spice some clove and some fruit with slight yeast..the taste is outstanding its crisp and clean very refreshing with lemon and pepper notes lots of yeast and floral pairings for the palate some apple/melon and some hops round out this well balanced saison..the mouthfell is light but a saison is meant for the warmer months ..this is oh so drinkable and just a pleasure to the last drop..so drinkable and simple yet it is complex in the layers of flavor that are present...highly recommended"
"Great drinking. Didn't last long."
"Overall: If you told me that Saison Dupon had been bootlegged I'd probably believe you. It doesn't have much alcohol, but it packs a punch."
"O a great drinking beer, it is as refreshing as a German wheat beer but with more snap and bite. My favorite Saison, and the only one I can find on tap."
"D: Pretty good. About average for a saison."
"Medium body, medium crisp carbonation and dry."
"D - this is a very good saison. Nice and fruity and earthy that leaves a dry finish, leaving you wanting more. I really enjoyed this classic for the style and will seek it out in the future."
"Overall a great saison and great example of the style. Tastes and smells great and is a good beer for the summer."
"D: Fantastic on this hot day, perfect summer beer for all occasions. Alcohol is low enough to make it drinkable. Very refreshing in character."
"Tasty & well-made, but still feels pretty full to me. Definitely one I'd go for repeatedly, but two in a sitting would probably be my limit."
"This beer pours a crisp, pale, golden color,two finger foamy head that seemed to dissipate quickly.Bitter, lemon,citrus, bouquet, slightly dank. Very approachable on the palate dry, crisp, and clean, with a light body and a pleasant finish, very refreshing! Crisp grassy notes,lemon citrus, and hops, seem to jump out at first, then settles into a nice mineral finish. I'd love to have this beer with some crab cakes on a summer night sitting on the patio."
"Definitely recommend, will drink again, often in the summer."
"D: Shared this beer with my dad and some fruit flies. It was so so tasty and refreshing. I can't wait to get my hands on more!"
"D- Very drinkable beer. Has all the components of a great saison without being too overpowering... Love this beer"
"D - I always buy the little bottle and wish I had the big bottle. If only it didn't need to be imported, I'd drink this with almost every meal. This one lives up to the reputation."
"Wow, this must be awesome with food. Alone, even with the lighter edge, you must sip. And this is good, as it prolongs the enjoyment. Absolutely worth the try."
"A: This beer looks like a hefe weizen, but more substantial and cloudy with a bit of floating yeast. The white head is foamier than average and leaves behind a sticky lacing. S: Really funky, armpitlike... but with a sweetness. Bold is the best word for it. The smell is almost intimidating at first. T: The most dominant to me is a sweet wheat bread flavor, followed by a slight alcohol sting, muskyness, then a lingering bitterness. Not as much as an IPA, but still agressive. M: The best thing about this beer for me. Very nice. Feels round and slightly viscous, coating my mouth with the strong flavor. Nice refreshing small bubbled carbonation. D: I really don't think I would want to drink more than one of these. Very powerful flavor. For me, this is a sampling, sipping beer. Reviewed from phone, so forgive the format."
"D - One of my favorite styles. I prefer my Saisons a bit sweeter, but this is a very balanced and wonderful Saison, especially for those who find some of them a bit on the sweet side."
"Forget witbiers for the summer, I'd rather take one of these down after mowing the lawn. Refreshing and complex, I could drink this until I couldn't make it back to the fridge any more."
"On tap at Al's served in a classy little saison dupont glass. Pours a hazy golden color with a finger of white head. A solid curtain of lace clings all over the glass. Nose is citrus and spices akin to clove. Taste is on par with the aroma: citrus, clove and yeast primarily. Finishes slightly dry with a bit of hop bitterness. Light feel and modestly carbonated, it is quite drinkable. As it warms, a bit of pear or light fruit blended with grain comes through and is left in the mouth."
"drinkability - refreshing, complex, balanced"
"Drinkability: This is a top notch beer that deserves its fame. I definitely wanted to keep sipping this beer and will definitely be including it on my shopping list in the future. This would be perfect for drinking on a warm summer evening while relaxing after a busy day."
"Caged and corked large green glass bottle. Big aroma after popping the cork which did not disappoint in the sound department. Substaintial head and solid carbonation. Nice lacing. Almost an earthy kind of smell to this brew. Starts a bit fruity but ends with a dry finish. A great beer."
"D: This is a nice Saison. It's light and goes down easily. Not as funky as some examples of the style, but quite enjoyable. I'm glad I finally had it."
"Notes - Might be a great example of a Saison but maybe saisons aren't really my thing."
"Drinkability is good. A solid summer beer, a bit higher in octane than some Saisons, but definitely worthy of mass quantities."
"The mouthfeel is medium and dry.There is lots of carbonation obvious in the feel. This beer clearly gets better as it warms. For me, this is a perfect example of the style. I love the way it goes with most foods as well."
"One of the driest beers on Earth, which along with the bracing bitterness makes this a super refreshing beer. So complex, unique, and interesting, this is still the unmatched quintessential example of a Saison. One of my favorites."
"I won't claim that I rate purely against style, because I found this a great representative of a style I don't particularly enjoy."
"D- This is a pretty good warm weather brew but it is not my favorite saison. I dont think Fantome can be dethroned."
"Served from a 750 ml bottle into a tulip."
"it slow so I can enjoy."
"D- I can see why the bottle says it was made for summer. Easy drinking with good flavor but nothing overpowering. A good definition for the style although it seems saisons seem to be all over the board."
"M - Nice and fluffy mouthfeel medium body with nice profile and good CO2. Refreshing and very drinkable and nice ABV."
"Great beer, could use a bit more funk, but this was good. Glad to have sampled."
"Mouthfeel is medium light with a foamy amount of carbonation."
"This may be the most classic example of a farmhouse ale one can find. Smooth, with a bit of a peppery note and mildly floral and slightly funky yeast notes. Carbonation is bright but not too fizzy. White wine and lemon notes at the finish. Overall a wonderfully drinkable beer."
"Drinkability: This is an exceptionally drinkable beer. I, for one, am glad that the Saison is experiencing a revival."
"Drinkability- HIGHLY DRINKABLE, this would be an amazing summer time beer and its just so clean and palate cleansing, would go amazing I think with just so many meals, its a very tasty and easy drinking beverage, one I would certainly recommend again, its complex yet simple and thats a good thing, will be a beer i will definitely visit again,"
"Hazy tawny golden color with some bone white head. Great retention and lacing. Smell is good with some tart and acidic citrus notes. Bready malt and some musty yeastiness as well. Taste follows suit, some citrus notes, with a decent malt backbone to back it up. Creamy and full-bodied, this one is not over-carbonated, like many American versions of the style. Great drinkability, the theme of this one is balance and melding of flavors. A bit reserved, I missed some of the funkiness that others talk about."
"d: sweet and delicious, like lemonade on a hot day. but there is only so much acidity one can take- sessionably, but not all day long."
"Overall, this is an excellent brew and a really good introduction to the style for me. It's a great fusion between a light drinkable beer and some traditional, funky Belgian farmhouse tastes. I can't wait to get my hands on some more saisons to see how they stack up, because this is a great beer."
"Medium body, sweet first and then some bitterness. Almost a Duvel like feeling to it. As the beer warms up there is more subtly to the flavors, more sulfur, more sour. Great mouthfeel, great drinkability. I really like this beer. Its probably one of the nicest and readily available saisons on the market."
"d - intense on the palate but in a good way."
"D: Oh, yeah. I could see this being a go-to ale in the hot summer months. It refreshes, rather than wears out, the palate. I can't say enough about the good qualities of this beer, highly recommended."
"Overall an excellent version of the saison style. Everything it should be."
"D- Hell yeah its drinkable but for the price drinkable on the right occation like an into to friends or a high end dinner to freshin the palete with rich foods."
"Overall I think it's a hallmark of the style, but I would hope in the sense that it allows a foundation for others to build on and refine rather than duplicate, as there's a sort of disharmony at the root of this beer for me."
"Drinkability: I could see how people would love this beer, but it is not my thing. The funk is really present and so are the Belgian spices. At times this tastes like a witbier. The beer is complex and is worth a try. I am just not likely to get it for the price."
"Drinkability: All day, every day (lol). I think this is a great beer for ANYBODY. I could never get tired of it. I've even thought about sticking a few in my cellar to see how they turn out with a bit of age. Mmmm Mmmm delicious!"
"Light to medium body, crisp and refreshing all around. This is a classic saison, great for hot days especially but enjoyable any time of year. Extremely drinkable and something I never get tired of."
"The classic mother of all saisons. You owe to yourself and beergeeks everywhere to at least try this. A superb offering from the mecca of beer Belgium. Great in the heat or cold months of the year. Good with almost any type of food also. This ia a beer that you should always have on stock. Highly reccomend this to all."
"Taste: Crisp and clean taste. Spicy yeast character. Slight fresh tart apple fruitiness."
"This is the saison that other saisons are compared to; this is the benchmark for the style. For good reason, too. Everything that saison lovers enjoy about Belgian farmhouse ales is here in some capacity. And while I've had better saisons -- some that add Brettonamyces, some that up the hops -- this is a staple of my fridge, a beer with few peers."
"Notes: Lots of different flavors with the taste on your tongue changing every sip you take."
"Drinkability: A pleasant saison that is definately foreign to my taste buds. Pretty much spot on for the style. If I had more of this beer, I'd be happier."
"If you're just discovering this style, this is a must drink. If you're familiar with this style, you know how great this beer is."
"decent for it's beer type, but I'd be okay not getting this again."
"Overall this is one of the classics. All other saisons get measured up to this one. A great measuring stick in my opinion."
"An excellent example of the style."
"I really enjoyed this beer. I had it today at our beer tasting at my work, Wines Unlimited and it had an entire array of exotic flavors. When I looked at the beer in my tasting glass, It looked yellowish, with hints of green reflection glow. Good head, and retention. The smell was intense and could be smelled at least 3 feet away. It smelled of grass, hops, skunk, and I caught a note of sweetness in the smell. Then I drank it slowly, the flavors really explode on the palate and lingers well after the consumption. This I think is a world class beer."
"Flavor is mellow compared to aroma, with notes of clove, grapefruit and vanilla. More funky and spicy than fruity, with a good dose of bitterness. Not sweet, but dry. Kind of reminds me of a baby Duvel. Brilliant creamy moutfeel, and very drinkable and refreshing at 6.5 percent. The classic Saison."
"Each sip leaves me wanting more - this bottle will be no problem to polish off!"
"D-this beer is a perfect refresher and could easily be enjoyed all night (though it's not really widely available in the states but if it was i would definately drink this on a regular basis"
"D - Perfect for almost any occasion, widely palatable, great for pairing."
"The mouthfeel is pretty great. Smooth and medium with nice grainy characteristics. All in all a very easy to drink brew. I think i'm becoming a fan of the saison style."
"D - Very good and light, easygoing as well."
"D: Saison Dupont was the first Farmhouse Ale I tried a little over 3 years ago. Still holds up to my first impressions. Like this one a lot."
"Taste is slightly tart-sweet, with lemon, spicey herb, yeast, a lot of grain, some hay, pear, faint hint of banana. It has light spicey bitterness that comes up near the finish and lingers to join the mostly sweet-tart character. Feel is slightly oily but not very, and also a bit lively. It has anisy-herbal-peppery qualities that come through a lot but are restrained and balanced with the other elements. It is dry but not too dry."
"Drinkability is wicked high. I could drink this by the bucketful during the summer."
"When I tried this beer before it was great. Bright, clean and inviting. I will be sure to review this one again."
"Saison Dupont is a measuring stick for the style. Its THE classic saison, and while its not the best saison in my eyes, it is totally deserving of all the praise its received. Several aspects of this beer are simply stellar: the appearance is great, the mouthfeel is incredible and the drinkability is through the roof."
"Notes: It´s a decent beer that for me lingers too close to blah qualities. For all its hype and complexities it is too close to some funky European largers or their better Pilsner sisters. In fact primarily from the people I´ve shared the brew with, those that claimed that macro Euro lagers were their beer of choice seemed to be the most pleased by this ale, Maybe in that regard it is not too bad a beer to have people switching gears towards craft brews. Maybe it´s the icon reference for saisons but there are a few ahead of it within the style."
"Pours a hazy golden yellow out of the bottle with a big foamy white head that has has great retention. The aroma is complex with some fruity herbal smells up front and a little funky backend. There is a slight citrus flavor to the VERY effervescent beer. A little lemon and some herbs. Very refreshing and drinkable. I could make this a session beer."
"375 ml bottle to glass, champagne type cork kinda fun to pop. Pours with a ton of foam, almost a gusher, looks cloudy dark yellow, smells earthy and a little grainy. Taste is fairly big but not necessarily malty nor hoppy, sort of starchy or grainy, maybe funky. I liked it. Good drinkability after you get your bearings, this has a pretty unique flavor."
"D stylistically very nice. a cleaner saison with skunky flare, but very very enjoyable and continued to grow on me"
"drinkability: great beer an maybe the perfect macro transitional beer."
"Finally sitting down to review this classic. Poured a corked and caged 375 into my Tripel Karmeliet tulip. This beer pours a hazy golden straw with a big fluffy white head leaving just a minimal amount of lacing. The aroma is big and fruity up front. Ripe fruits like apples and pears are in the forefront leading to light hay, damp earth with a light grassy hop. The flavor follows suit with ripe apple and pears coming through up front. Musty earth, light grass, hay and just a bit of aspirin on the finish. The mouthfeel is light and finishes just a bit sweeter then I would have liked. I really much prefer a dry finish to a Saison, nonetheless this is a wonderful example of a ture Belgian Saison."
"In short, this is the quintessential Saison / Farmhouse ale. The best I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. Saison Dupont's strength is in the perfect balance of its flavor profile. Delicious and refreshing. Simply a classic."
"All in all, this quite an upstanding Saison. Definitely worth a try."
"(D)- A great farmhouse with all the right things going for it. My only complaint is how bitter it gets overtime from the yeast. I would gladly like to see more of this though in my fridge on the occasion when my mood for it fits."
"Great example and great appearance. nice thick chunky rings of lace are left after the big creamy, frothy head dies down. Golden orange body, lots of lemon peel, grassy, herbal notes in the nose which is otherwise dominated by yeast. The taste is well done; spicy with a big clove and coriander backing, peppery with banana and fresh cut golden apples. Mouthfeel is spritzy, crisp and refreshing. Good beer, would have earned higher scores if the yeast wasn't as prevalent."
"D - Nice enough for a time. I like it."
"Poured from a 375 ml half bottle into two tulip glasses. Huge white head forms from the start. Looks like meringue, so thick and fluffy. Body was hazy yellow and cloudy. Smell was lemony and pine-like. Taste was tart and refreshing. The citrus flavor gave this beer a nice tang, but the mouthfeel of this farmhouse ale really balanced things well. It was so smooth, light, crisp, and mellow. Not overpowering though, so it paired well with a variety of cheeses. A very flavorful and classic example of a Belgian saison."
"I poured from a 750 ml bottle and poured it into several wine glasses(I shared it with non-beer drinking friends at a dinner party). It is a hazy, cloudy gold with a massive , long lasting, white head. Lemon zest is prevalent on the nose, along with a hint of spiciness. The flavor was as good as advertised, lemony, spicy, with a drying finish. The beer is highly carbonated, medium/light in body and it goes great with any food. Everyone who tried it agreed, it is a damn fine brew."
"Drinkability: The complex taste keeps you interested, but the higher carbonation and dry, crisp finish lets you drink it down. A very enjoyable first experience with with Brasserie Dupont."
"D: I can see why this one is so popular. A wonderful Saison, and one that would be perfect for a warm afternoon."
"T- It has a vegetable maltiness to it. Kind of lagery, with an ale aftertaste. Some bitterness, expecially in the aftertaste. For an $11 bottle, I expect a more sophisticated taste."
"M/D: Light to medium in texture, the feel of this beer evolves with temperature and time it has been poured. Initially, there is a strong effervescent feel, but as the beer warms and sits exposed to air, the beer turns smooth and almost silky, finishing nice and dry. There is a lot of great stuff going on with this beer. Every overlying feature that I was looking for in the flavor was there, and they all went together in a near perfect balance. I would drink a full 750mL bottle by myself if I could, but I guess I don't mind sharing either."
"A bit acidic feeling, sort of like orange juice on an empty stomach. Altogether a solid beer worthy of trying."
"D. Not as much complexity as I remeber it from the last time I had it on tap. A refreshing beer and very drinkable. Will have to seek it out on tap again to see if it was like I remembered."
"Classic for a reason."
"~ Purchased this 12.7 oz bottle from Big Z Beverage in Huntington, NY. The pour is cloudy yellow with a huge frothy white head that lingers around for a while. What a fantastic smell! It's funky, citrusy, and a little spicy. Taste is the same. It's somewhat complex, but also smooth, very refreshing, and well-balanced. A must try! ~"
"Overall, one of the premier examples of the Saison/Farmhouse style."
"Santé!"
"d- very good, i paired this with thanksgiving dinner, the lightness went very well and didn't conflict with any of the flavors, this was my first saison and i really enjoyed it, it's not an everyday beer but i'd drink it again for sure."
"D: Good. I like this beer alot. The price tag keeps me coming back for me."
"J"
"Served in a tulip from a 750ml bottle. The earthy aroma was pretty apparent even as I poured my first glass; color is a slightly hazy orange with a huge frothy head. I got the same foam on the last glass that I did on the first, and the lacing lingered nicely. Aroma is a strong one; tough to pin down, but the best way to describe it would be the hay/barnyard aroma I associate with Saisons. Taste is a little strong, a little acerbic, pleasant but I've tasted others I prefer. Very dry finish; definitely a palate cleanser. I've always thought of this as the ""standard"" for the style, but to be honest I'd rather have a Hennepin."
"As it warms, some of the unbalanced characteristics seem to temper, but I must wholeheartedly admit that I've always found this Saison a bit disappointing, despite its reputation."
"D-very easy to drink, not overpowering but I feel like I need more in the taste department, if the taste was as good as the smell it would be much better."
"Mouthfeel is medium/light with a bit of carbonation sting. On par with how the style should be. Drinkability is very high due to the refreshing and clean nature of it. If I were only drinking one glass I would rather have a Fantome Saison, but for a session you can send this one my way any time. Good beer."
"M/D: Light summer drinker imo, tasty and very easy to drink. Im sure a few of these would go down easily."
"D- Quite the tasty and refreshing beer. Very easy to drink maybe a bit too easy."
"Overall one of the better Saison's I've tried and a great value. Just might become a regular in the fridge."
"This beer has a cloudy golden look. Smells great like the typical Belgian style ale. The taste is good, the hops and tartness provide great flavor. It's hard to put the beer down. Mouthfeel is nice, good carbonation. Drinkability is also good. I just drank one and I think I need another."
"Appearance is good. Some small head and nice lacing. Smell is good nice hops and upfront spicing that packs a bit of a punch. Taste is pretty good but a little less balanced than I thought it would be. It's good, but I prefer Hennipen. Mouthfeel is nice, medium in body. Drinkability is good as well."
"Saison Dupont is a classic, and it is no surprise that it is a great saison with great drinkability."
"D-Tasty and, as I sai, surprisingly refreshing."
"D - I am kind of iffy with this beer. I liked it enough, but something didn't fully click. For me, the aroma was the high-point by far. I'm glad I tried it but am in no hurry to drink another."
"Overall this is a great representation of the style, with no alcohol presences and the right balance between the other flavors."
"Pours a cloudy, maize color. 3/4 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of hops, tart malt, earthy malt, yeast, and grain. Fits the style of a Saison/Farmhouse Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of yeast, pale malt, grain, slight citrus, slight hops, and tart malt."
"D - A very traditional example - A classic of the style. It has high drinkability even though it might not be my first choice in saisons it is very enjoyable."
"Refreshing, tasty and interesting, Saison Dupont offers a lot to the punter. It is also a relatively good deal for the price."
"While not as funky as other saisons this will always be up there for me as it was the first saison I ever tried (I can't believe I haven't reviewed it until now) and continue to go back to."
"D&M - Dry light bodied and very refreshing. While it made me very gassy, I could drink it all day."
"D - This brew is positively delicious. One of the best widely-available saisons out there. This brew is such a wonderful beer to pair with food - anything from fried food to fresh goat's milk cheese, from risotto to spicy Thai food, this brew has you covered. If you haven't yet tried this brew, do yourself a favor, and crack open a bottle."
"Mouthfeel is very nicely carbonated but not dry on the finish. The hops leave a nice flavor on the back of the tongue. Very nice stuff."
"A very nice, drinkable balanced saison"
"The beer has a nice mouthfeel due to the level of carbonation. The drinkability is spot on"
"D- very good. this could be a beer that I drink anytime."
"D: Very refreshing on a hot day. It's a very drinkable beer. Had with some ceviche and paired very well."
"Drinkabilitiy- By itself it was slightly disappointing as I'd heard great things about this beer, but it was breathtaking with dinner. The spicy notes in the beer blending beautifully with the spices in the food and the fruity flavors were perfect with the juices in the chicken I had. It seemed to have a match for any flavor I could throw at it. Definitely do it with food. It was amazing."
"D: Saisons were meant to be drank on hot summer days while working on a farm, and this exemplifies that."
"Another great belgian."
"A great beer, especially good in the summer, session-able, a classic typecast"
"Drinkability> Very drinkable!"
"D - Not as good as Hennepin, but still an excellent saison. Miles ahead of Grassroots Ale (gag me). The slight stench of skunk was a little bit disappointing - perhaps this would be even better if fresher?"
"D-4.5"
"Finally, a tremendously light, crisp mouthfeel and clean flavors make Saison Dupont very easy to drink."
"Personally: Anytime Saison DuPont is on a menu, I almost always get it. It is simply one of my favorites."
"Tremendously drinkable. Terrific beer for a warm summer day, flavors would also work very well during the crisp fall weather. Very enjoyable."
"Overall, a good saison. Glad I picked it up."
"I would not drink this beer again, don't quite get the overall impression here."
"Overall, this is a nice, refreshing summer beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium light and spritzy. Finishes with a dry palate, but plenty of lingering IBU's and citrus."
"Overall this is a very interesting brew and the 1st true Saison I have had. I will definately try it again."
"Drinkability is fair, one 750 will polish me off. I really like this one, but I am far from loving it."
"Pours a hazy golden with a hint of orange. A super creamy, soft white head crowns the beer. Smells of an aromatic Belgian yeast strain. Taste is quite dry, flavors from spices, and a grassy, earthy bitter finish. Mouthfeel is smooth, high carbonation. Quite drinkable, a good Saison that I would get again."
"Very drinkable."
"Very interesting taste. Clean and sharp with a taste that lingers. Leaved an odd taste but it's surprisingly good. Very different and somewhat pungent. I have to say this is quite good for the style, worth checking out!"
"Simply an awesome summer beer"
"This is a good beer with a high drinkability. The carbonation was on par, the flavor's where not cloying at anytime whatsoever, and the moderate ABV. makes this hard to beat as a good session summer beer. Cheers!"
"Drinkability is superb. Very refreshing, especially on a hot summer day and we have alot of those where I live. Everything about this beer is outstanding."
"Poured with a ridiculously big head. But what a head! Like a meringue, could've eaten it with a spoon. Laced thickly all the way to the end. Spicy Belgian yeast notes on the nose with a little earthiness in the background. Follows through with the same vibe on the palate. highly carbonated. Alcohol hangs a little at the back but not unpleasant. Always enjoyable."
"Notes: What a treat to have this at Cafe Delerium!"
"Poured a nice cloudly gold, one finger head. Pleasantely skunky smell. Great lacing. Spicy finish, slightly hops up front. Citrus smell and taste is there. Oakey with a bitter linger in the mouth. ""I thought I'd only see you once in a while"""
"Drinkability is very nice, once it hits that temperature sweet spot. Not wearing, refreshing but full, complex but with an integrated maturity that's very satisfying."
"D: Excellent beer to have on a nice mild sunny day. A little high ABV to be considered session, but if you have nothing to do, I could see drinking a good number of these. Excellent Saison."
"Drinkability: A classic beer that I have waited to long to sample. My wife brought this home from Chicago for me, knowing enough about what I have had to pick something up that I haven't."
"Refreshingly tart with a light malt presence and grassy hop notes. I could almost use a bit more funk in here, but then it would not be as refreshingly delicious as it is right now. Tastes a bit like chewing on a fresh hibiscus spring flower. Terrific beer, A+ all the way. I have bought more than a few Saison DuPonts over the years, and it seems to be a pretty fragile beer, as some off-flavors can make an appearance in some bottles. Why do they continue to use these green bottles?! But there is nothing quite so good as a perfect bottle of this liquid nectar. Nearly the perfect beer."
"On tap at Stone. Nice gold color with a cap of thick white froth. Subtle spicy aroma, cloves and pepper, lemons, and grain. Flavor is similar with a grainy base, lemony wheat notes, and a dry, peppery finish. Perfect balance and interplay between flavors are what make this the quintessential saison. Refreshing and drinkable."
"Blipped ""Time of the Season"" by The Zombies. It's a classic!"
"D: Easy drink. It's great, try it."
"D- Refreshing, yet I can only drink one 750ml at a time because it is a bit heavy feeling."
"The clean finish."
"Poured a cloudy gold body with great carbonation for a frothy, two-finger head that died slowly and left some lace. A very sharp, semi-pungent spice and clove smell with some eart/grassiness and a good amount of fruit and yeast in the background of the aroma. Great smoothness that is balanced with a well-carb'd crispness. Yeast and bread malt make the beer somewhat chewey and creamy and there is a little bit of sweetness derived from the fruit flavoring. I can taste pear, apple, orange; there are some good fruti tastes in here and the beer finishes slightly dry thanks to hops and little funkiness in it as well. An excellent beer to pour a few glasses for you and a couple of friends to sip on."
"Drinkability: Exceedingly refreshing and easy to drink, but with loads of flavor."
"Highly carbonated, but it seems to be appropriate. Very dry finish. Body is on the lighter side. Crisp, zesty and refreshing. Good stuff, especially this time of year."
"Turns out the bottle I bought for so much was a larger version of the same beer in my frig. I will give the small, cheaper priced, bottle to my girlfriend to try."
"An easy to drink Saison I really enjoyed with my meal. I conceder this a great go to brew for the summer season"
"Drinkability - This is definitely one of my favorites, if not THE favorite, of the Saison Farmhouse ales. Delicious, earthy, yeasty, funky, and all in the best possible usage of the terms. This is a very drinkable ale that never disappoints."
"Drinkability- Even if your not a hops fan, which I am not, there's alot to absorb here. With and without food this is a beautiful complex beer. I probably would buy this regularly, but I'd certainly include it on a tasting or for a beer dinner."
"Mouthfeel: Medium and soft carbonation with a medium body"
"- Over carbonated really... would love to drink more in a shot as the bottle is rather large... but I'd be afraid of belching up enough foam that it would look like a crazy bubble-scene from the Willy Wonka Chocolate Factory... but the flavor is great.."
"A hazy, burnt orange appearance with a large, fluffy head narrates this beautiful drink. Good retention and sticky lacing on the sides. Very yeasty aromas with hints of floral and honey. Taste is a bit thin, but a palate cleanser indeed. A dry drink with a solid crispness. Overall, a great saison."
"Mouthfeel is dry, drawn out with a bounty of mid sized carbonation bubbles that lend at times a crisp, then soft feel. Overall it is zesty, light bodied and moves well. It is never boring, stays refreshing and very drinkable. One of the standard bearers in my mind, even though it might not be the apex of the style."
"I really don't like this all that much. It's not bad, but it's nothing to write home about."
"M - Very fizzy carbonation, slightly thinner than medium bodied."
"D. yes, I can easily see one becoming two, threee and so on..."
"D- summer is almost here, this is a beer that i will be promoting at work, and i can think of so many things to pair this with!!!!"
"D: A great beer and a classic saison, perhaps the best in it's style. Very drinkable and refreshing, yet full of flavors."
"Drinkability: For those who like hops and grain this is a very good beer to look for."
"Finish - Sharp dryness, but smooth and really rewarding."
"Drinkability is ok, looking past the imperfections I stated I could see myself maybe killing a 750 of this with a long meal, but for the other similar choices in the belgian realm, I'll probably overlook this one next time I'm at the beer store."
"Nice saison! Poured at cellar temp into chalice producing a huge rocky head that took quite some time to diminish, with golden unfiltered color below. Nose was sweet, floral, belgian yeast and taste is similar, full and easy to drink. Of the style this is a fantastic example and to be corny it literally bounces of the taste buds and really does go well on a nice spring evening with some beef medallions from the grill. A solid and quite drinkable beer."
"D- Fantastic saison! I would never turn one of these away. Highly recommended if you enjoy the style."
"Sweet and spicy flavor, refreshing as usual. Hop aftertaste. Could and have drank a whole 750 mL at once so it is very drinkable."
"D- I have very little to say about this beer in many aspects. However this is the definition of a Saison. It was delicious, and if I were able to get this brew more often I would be drinking this all summer. Check this one out! Definitely check this out if you are interested in brewing a saison."
"D 4.5 - A good solid example of a Saison with nice dry body and character. ABV is a a bit lower than some Saisons @ 6.5, so this a a nice sessionable brew. A fair price for a Belgian at $8 for a 750ml bottle @ Broudy's."
"Biggish creamy mouthfeel, tiny bubbles work over your tongue and get you ready for more. I could keep drinking this forever. Classic. Awesome."
"Saison Dupont is almost the standard to what a saison should taste like. It is light, crisp, with a plesant spicyness in the finish that is the characteristic of the yeast. A lot of breweries try to mess with and make saisons extreem but noting is like a great traditional style. I have yet to like one that deviates from the simple feel of this beer. It's a little expensive for a light crisp beer but it's imported so what do you expect. Wish it could be cheaper. Would keep it around a lot more."
"One of the better beers I have had in my life."
"Lighter in body than expected from the nose, not overly sweet and in fact offers a touch of bitterness on the finish. Lots of spice, touch of apple and pear and a long finish. Smooth and crisp feel with a nice carbonation, quite drinkable."
"Notes: This was extremely good. It was my first Saison and I think I am already hooked, especially with the weather warming (okay only to the 50s but that is warming!). This is what a hefeweizen should be."
"I could see this beer pairing very well with many dishes. A great example of the style."
"One of the good ones and again, a solid Old World standard. Maybe a little too much Saaz for my taste but this one is extremely bright and clean. Well-done to say the least."
" Mouthfeel is spicy and well carbonated. overall pretty drinkable. I'll probably finish the bottle by myself tonight."
"D - Highly drinkable although not the most drinkable example of the style. That honor would probably go to Hennepin."
"Quite weizeny on the palate with that wheaty, banana character. Surprising really since there is nothing of the sort in it. Surprisingly bitter on the finish, a lot of hops coming through following that light, wheaty flavour. This leaves me, to be honest, with a really quite sinking, heavy feeling because it feels over-hopped without enough rich barley malt to balance, and the mouthfeel is a bit clunky. Taste is pleasant enough but it's quite heavy-going. I wouldn't call this a sessioning beer. I quite respect this, but I don't like it all that much, unfortunately."
"Pours a hazy golden color with a large white head that had excellant retention. The head settles to a thick cap. Large amount of tiny bubbles percolate throughout the beer. Lemongrass and pepper comes through in the aroma. Same pepper and lemon in the flavor. No funkiness whatsoever. Finishes dry,dry,dry. Seems a bit one dimensional in the taste. I thought the body and carbonation went very well together. Overall a good beer but it is not one the best Saisons out there. Easy drinking and refreshing."
"Have to say, I like my American versions better. This is a good, delicious, tasty beer... but not as good as some produced right here in the U. S. of A."
"T: Way too easy to put down. In fact, its drinkability might be its greatest weakness. It's too good to sip and savor, but the carbonation has a bloating effect if you drink too quickly. Anyway, this is outstanding as a summer thirst-quencher, an aperitif, or as an accompaniment to just about any dish."
"D - Other than the expensive imported price of almost $5 per 375 ml (12.4 oz), this beer would be a great six pack. Easy to drink and quickly becoming one of my favorite all-time."
"It has been years since I've had this beer and I am excited to finally try it again. Pours a beautiful hazy gold with hyperactive carbonation and crowned with a a thick white head. Smells very yeasty with light fruits and spices. The taste just blows me away. Saison Dupont is such an all-star that I hardly know where to begin. The first thing I notice is the way it makes me tongue tingle, followed by a sweet fruity and spicy blast not unlike that of a Belgian tripel just before a rush of orange zest hits the back palate and lingers on the finish. It's body is quite extraordinary -- tingly like I said but has a very substantial body that gradually breaks down and softens. An exceptional beer."
"A little skunk wafts up to the nose upon popping the cork, and sometimes that's not a bad thing, as long as it's not overwhelming. Looking at the bottle art, I imagine myself at a small cafe in Belgium drinking this one. Pours a dirty gold and finishes off with a dense off-white head. Retention is good, as it takes some time to fade. A few spots of lacing are left to and fro. Smells phenomenal, with fresh yeast, light fruits (green apples, pears) and diacetyls all moving in perfect balance around the nose. Tastes spicy and a bit sour with more light fruits, big malts, sweet bread and yeast. Goes down a bit dry and there's plenty of carbonation. Mouth-feel is medium. Enjoyed the hell out of this one."
"From the bottle into a weizen glass (the 2nd into a pint glass). Very hazy, cloudy and golden wheatish in color. Thick, rocky head 2 fingers thick and she stayed around quite a long time. Beautiful lacing all the way down the glass. Aroma of grass, grains and very fruity with a slight whif of hops. Better tasting than I imagined from the aroma. The Dupont has a slightly grainy, fruity taste to it with the slightest amount of light bitterness to it. As I drank it the fruitiness became more noticeable without killing or overcoming the hops. Mouthfeel is so very smooth, almost creamy with a decent amount of carbonation that offsets the dryness that is evident later on. Really alot going on with this beer. Extremely enjoyable and drinkable. Great session beer. You have to try this one."
"great beer i love beer with wild yeast this beer would great on a hot day yet its a bit pricy its defiantly worth getting at least once"
"D: The dryness just makes me want to keep drinking more. Not filling, tasty, and a perfect balance of hops, fruit, and malt."
"P.S. Much better from the bottle."
"The is such a subtle complexity to this one that you really have to study it. Take your time; this one is a real pleasure. A fantastic offering that is easily a regular."
"Super peppery and refreshing carbonation. Light to medium body. The subtle but different flavors give it a lot of drinkability since you're always sort of trying to figure out what the beer is about. This was sort of a different beer for me but I'm glad I got it."
"D - A fantastic and extremely drinkable beer. A perfect Champagne substitute."
"Had this on tap at Backcounty in Nederland. Pours a hazy yellow with a lacy beige head. The nose has candy malts, citrus fruits and a bit of funky yeast. Taste is a bit more mellow, but still quite good. Very well balanced. Crisp medium body suits style. Would pair well with most any meal."
"Pours a hazy dark orange with a three finger fluffy white head that seems to stick around forever. Some floaties dangle here and there as well. The spiderweb lacing makes this a superb looking brew. Aroma consists of banana, spicy hops, and strong yeasty goodness. Sweet floral perfume and some earth in the nose as well. Very enjoyable to sniff. Taste follows suit very well but a touch sweeter. Sweet apple, pear, and rhubarb with a grassy dry flavor. Midway some pepper and clove with a slight melon sweetness. Aftertaste is more dry with a bit of a citrus hop linger, very nice. Light body with a soft pillowy feel and an active carbonation, great representation of the style. This saison is too easy to drink, it's just a shame I only got a small bottle. Next time I'm getting the corked 750 ml bottle for sure. Probably one of the best saisons I've had to date."
"This is a good example of a drinkable saison/session beer. Easy to drink and enjoy, but at $10 a bottle it is an expensive thirst quencher."
"D: Split a 750ml with a friend; probably good as the carbonation makes it pretty filling."
"D--I guess, bur I really don't like the bitterness of this beer."
"D: I wanted more MoRe MORE! but I had to DRIVE DrIvE drive...:("
"750ml corked & caged. It pours a cloudy gold with a dense, effervescent white head that leaves soft lacing. Smells of vanilla, butter, sharp spice, and a slight carob. VERY nice. The taste is dry, peppery, and slightly fruity. There are mild earthy tones and a whisp of band aid. The whole thing mixes very well. Mouthfeel is spot on, slippery and highly carbonated. Drinkability is very good. This bottle has met its match."
"D- A very enjoyable beer that is subtle, but the more of it I drink, the more it opens up. The lower ABV is most definitely appreciated and shoots the drinkability off the charts."
"D - A good saison, probably would rate higher if I hadn't had a certain saison at the tasting, but good none the less"
"First thought: Upon the first sip, far more vinegary and soapy than anticipated. As I let it sit some, these flavors seem to mellow into the background a bit. Hints of spices I couldn't begin to name permeate throughout, backed by pale tart vineyard fruit, apple, pear, white grape. It's crisp, dry, light-bodied, all of those aspects full to character. But the aftertaste is where the negative aspects rise to full character. i get a very soapy and overly vinegaric finish, it's making me wonder if I got a bad bottle. I have limited experience with the genre at hand, but I don't think these qualities should be so present. If it weren't for them, it would be a very pleasant slight tartness providing a sour character, and that would make it very palatable. It really gives a hit to taste and drinkability, so I won't deduct them that low until I know what's up. will revise these scores if necessary after trying this beer again at a later date, to give it a more fair shake."
"This is a pleasant beer to drink. It's light, flavorful and easy to drink. The sediment is a little disconcerting. In fact I would have given it a higher appearance if it wasn't for the sediment. This is an enjoyable beer to drink, and I would enjoy drinking this more on a hot summer day than on a gold winters evening."
"Not a bad beer overall, but not the best of this style I've had either. I wouldn't go out of my way for it, but wouldn't turn one down if offered either."
"Very drinkable, and a very standard saison - citrus, hops, yeast, spice, earth, slightly dry finish. Nothing jumping out to WOW me, but a good beer."
"Appearence is that of a nice golden color with a large foamy white head.. The scent is creamy and banana like with a touch or coriander and spice. The carbonation content is quite high. The taste is the banana and coriander, a touch of lemon and some hoppiness. The drinkability is very high. This is an incredibly good saison, probably the best I've had."
"Drinkability - A standard bearer for the saison style. Wonderfully easy to drink, I can't help but to take gulp after gulp. Deep and flavorful with a gliding change in flavor as it goes from start to finish. This one will please even the most arrogant of palates."
"D - Drinkability is high. This finishes nice and clean but not with too much drying effect (bear in mind I love a dry-as-hell, bitter hop bomb). Really rather drinkable."
"Light and clean, certainly drinkable, this begs to be drunk at the height of summer, with jambalaya or fresh crawfish."
"Drinkability: If Barack Obama signs a bill into effect where I'm paid to drink this all day..."
"An interesting beer that stood out from the pack, not in its superiority, but in it's uniqueness. My brother rated this his favorite of the three and it was my least. To each his own."
"This beer poured an attractive golden color with a nice sumptuous head that dissipated slowly. Nice aroma that complex mix of fruit, spice, and hops. Fruitness is balanced by the hops bitterness. A bit of a dry mouthfeel. Drinkability is high on this one. Good Beer."
"Overall: I can't think of any other beer that literally makes me want to go run in a field of dandelions. This beer has the imagery of a beautiful spring day associated with it (and no, I'm not drunk while writing this). Well done, Brasserie Dupont."
"Pours a cloudy yellow opaque colored body with a big white head, and decent lacing. Has an aroma of flowers, some hops, a subtle aroma. Flavor is reminiscent of Hoegaarden, very strong perfume. Frothy, warm, good mouthfeel."
"Drinkability- solo the drinkability isn't amazing, this is a 'with food' beer; but even alone I could drink a glass or two of this a week, no problem."
"D- Extremely easy to drink"
"7/4/8/4/16 (3.9/5)"
"(rated Sep 4, 2008)"
"o:very drinkable. strong phenols may be offensive to some. something about this beer reminds me of orval-sans-brett. i think that all of the spice in the beer is yeast derived but i'm not sure."
"D: very drinkable here, cant wait to bring this one poolside in the summer!"
"Pours hazy yellow with a big white head. Patchy lacing. Citrus, yeast, pepper, and a musty aroma. Crisp taste, good amount of lemon zest, pepper, and spice. Still, a musty overtone that leaves a metallic bite. Enjoyable, and paired very well with seafood."
"THIS, ladies and gents, is THE quintessential farmhouse ale. Poured with a grand foamy, frothy, big, rocky head. Lots of lace. Aroma is very yeasty, citrusy, a hint bittersweet, spicy, peppery. Flavor is the same but bigger. Commercial description is accurate: does have a haze, a refreshilng fruitiness and a long dry finish. Finish also is a bit bitter. Perfect for the summer months as well as any freaking time you want. Beer Supreme. Could even be a session beer"
"This is an excellent beer. It would have been nice to have more than on glass of it. Even Mrs. Kdog enjoyed it."
"With this beer you need to let it sit for a moment as it will get rid of the skunk smell and become the traditional smelling beer. The golden unfiltered beer was poured into a pint glass and let sit till the foam started to settle. The taste is amazing as it gives a floweral and cloves of tastes. Overall an amazing beer to have."
"Check this farm house ale out if you get a chance it's great!"
"A favorite."
"Like I've said I havent experienced many saison brews although this one doesn't make me jump for joy to go grab another. It was worth a try atleast once."
"Pours a pale golden with a great big fluffy head. Probably an over-vigorous pour. Very good retention. Lots of herbs on the nose and palate. Also a dry graininess presents itself. Good bitter crispness is evident and lots or carbonation. For some undescibable reason I prefer the organic version. I just find it more drinkable. Der!"
"Drinkability is high for me, and I can see myself enjoying this immensely once it gets warm out again. This is what I think of when BA's ask what would be a good lawnmower beer. I would like to try and pair this up with some food at some point, as I've heard it can really shine."
"The ""Chob""(Michelob) the champagne of beers??? I think not. Pouring this beer into into a small snifter it can barely be contained. Immediately there is a large effervescent head that monopolizes at least half my glass until I find the right pour-to-head ratio so i don't get beer all over my rug. The original aroma has that same metallic smell that all beers in a green bottle have to me; but when the aggressive, tightly laced head finally calms you get the flavors that are under it. That fruity/yeasty/funky Belgium scent that you would expect. But drinking it is a different story. Honestly, i can say this beer is balanced. The hop flavor is low but the bite you might be looking for is supported by it's effervescence. It gives way to a malty finish that makes itself known to your taste buds but fades to a dry finish, and this beer is incredibly dry. And drinkability??? Well let me just tell you that I, sir, am drunk. This single bottle is so deceptively drinkable that during the course of this review it has hijacked my brain because i have drinking it like soda. WOW. Those damn Belgians just pulled out a bottle, no pun intended, of whoop-ass on me. Damn my wife is going to be pissed when she comes home. Oh well. This brings me in an ass-backwards kind of way to my next point; which too me scores the highest of honors for beer... Every dang sip tastes the same, and as FRESH as the first. I find this rare in a beer and worth mentioning. Man thank God I have spell check or anyone reading this review would be in a world of hurt right now. Anyway... DO GET THIS BEER. Your most crazy, hoppy, flavorful beer? No. In a class of it's own for being both simple and amazing? Yes. My God, Yes."
"D - This was a little disappointing. It didn't live up to the hype, in terms of flavor. It was just a little odd."
"Drinkability is good. Very refreshing... would drink that mainly during hot day!"
"375 ml bottle. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours a cloudy yellow/gold color with about an inch white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. The aroma smells like tropical fruit, cloves, earth and some Belgian funk. The taste is similar to the aroma, with the addition of some spicy hops, citrus, and bready malt. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium. It's crisp, has good carbonation and a dry finish. Drinkability is good too, it's enjoyable to drink and I could have a few of these in a session with no problem. Overall I think this is a good overall saison, I'd definitely buy this again in the future. Recommended."
"750ml bottle, year 2007. Poured into a pint glass. Pours a slightly cloudy blonde with thick foamy, bubbly head that lingers for quite a while. The first thing I smell is the spice, then the fruit comes through. I also get a hint of cloves in there. It's a complex aroma. Feels a bit bubbly in the mouth, medium bodied and goes down easy. It's got a tart taste, as well as spicy (peppers?) with some bitterness. Seems pretty dry, too. It's a well balanced flavor. Drinks real easy and is quite enjoyable."
"Saison Dupont was decanted into an Ommegang goblet, and came out a slightly hazy gold color, with a lovely pillow like white head. Smell has citrus fruit such as lemons and oranges, hints of earth and soil, and a mild bit of funk. Taste has more earthy funk, some cheese ash bitterness, grapefruit, more spicy pepper, overall very complex flavors. Mouthfeel starts off with a heavy carbonation that starts off rather sweet, and changes course to leave the palate on a dry and bitter note. Good drinking with this beer; I could go through a bottle very easily. This is a great conversation piece of a beer, and amongst the best for the style. Went well with some lamb tips. Cheers"
"Pours a very clear slightly orange golden color with a little bit of sediment from an inattentive pour (my own fault) with almost 2 fingers of rocky white head that never seems to fade. Aroma is complex, lots of citrus fruits, a bit of floral hoppiness, and a bit of spice. Taste is like the aroma, ctirus fruits, spicy hops, lightly tart, dry. The fruits are dominate and more more complex and layered than my simple description of citrus can encompass. Mouthfeel is good, light body, high+ carbonation and a dry finish only subtle hints of alcohol. Drinkability is quite good, very complex and intriguing. After each sip I cannot wait for the next. The bottle is gone far too quickly. Next time I'll buy a bigger bottle."
"Note: So I tried to avoid getting the yeast from the bottom of the bottle into my cup, but I got greedy and spilled just a bit in there. I'm not really sure how I'm 'supposed' to enjoy this beer (yeast or not), so if somebody knows please BM me."
"A bottle is more than enough for me, don't know that I'd session this, but it's definitely an interesting and pleasing beer."
"D = This is one worth coming back to again."
"Overall, a nice saison. I have been wanting to try it for so long, and i think my expectation for it was too high as it didnt meet it. I certainly do like it, and think its a good saison, but i think there are some out there that i tend to favor more."
"Light, with lots of sparkly carbonation. This is another great Saison for hotter nights in Australia."
"d) Complex & angular. Not for quaffing, but for savouring modestly."
"D: Can't get past the detergent taste. Doesn't seem right for the style. maybe a bad batch? Will have to try it again someday."
"D: a great drink for the summer time. Easy to consume and like."
"Great tasting, drinking beer that is a complete classic."
"saison dupont is supposed to be sturdy enough to take some aging but refreshing enough to drink as a summer quencher. in my opinion 6.5% is too high an abv for this task, and the aspirin quality is a bit over the top for any season. not bad, but not something that i'd want to drink very often. at 7.49 a bottle, i guess that's fortunate."
"Grassy and just a touch hoppy with sweetness and that great nose, good stuff. When it's cared for properly this is a thrill to drink and I was nearly thrilled this time. Nearly. I certainly didn't recoil as I sometimes do with Saison DuPont."
"I have had this several times on draft and none of them were as memorable or as good as this bottle. The drinkability on both is nice, but I would defintly rather have the bottle."
"D-If I could buy a keg I would. Try one you won't be dissapointed."
"What a wonderful drop of beer, surely one of the most drinkable and refreshing brews I've ever tasted. A truly delectable and extremely tasty beer. Wonderful."
"The drinkability is good this is a great example of that this style can be. Prosit, MK"
"Though there are many saisons out there, and almost as many good ones, I can see how this is the standard-bearer for the style. Highly recommended."
"Great example of a Saison, perfect for summer as the style was intended for."
"D: Overall this is a highly drinkable Belgian Saison. Crisp, apple-like with a certain bitterness that is not overbearing. Although this is a quality ale, I have other favs that I would likely buy before this."
"Pours a nice bright hay color into my tulip; the head is white and thin, with very large bubbles, and doesn't last long. The smell is pastoral: clover and grass and clay, with some notes of honey and peony. Taste comes on sweet and floral, with a sharp mineral tang to the finish; the yeast is very subtle though rich. It's quite an active beer in the mouth, leaving a good bit of foam to swallow after you think you're done, but feels very nice going down. The alcohol edge isn't too pronounced: it's easy to drink a few. A very nice example of the style."
"What a great saison. This is incredibly drinkable and I could easily put down a few."
"D: Drinkable, yet so intense and complex as to be slightly offputting. Definitely an enjoyable experience."
"Mouthfeel is very, very carbonated and crisp. Can't...stop...burping. Drinkability is great. Clean, crisp and refreshing."
"Drinkability: It could be a good anytime beer."
"This is entirely drinkable and absolutely enjoyable. Saison is a style that I'm beginning to consider as my new favorite, especially when I am fortunate enough to experience fantastic samples like this one. Highly recommended!!"
"Wow, this is my second ever saison. My first was Barking Duck, which I tried before getting into craft beer, and I was unable to drink it. Not sure what I would make of the Matilda Bay brew now, but Dupont is certainly a very good beer. More bitter than I was expecting, but very tasty and good value at $11 for the 750mL bottle."
"Overall - Simply a very good, complex ale."
"D - This isn't a bad beer I just doesn't really do it for me its like drinking a Duvel crossed with a Heineken"
"Cloudy gold with a thick white head. Aromas of lemongrass and gentle grainy malt with a dash of earth and yeast. Tastes like gritty barley and wheat with a mild spicy earthiness that goes well with its soft malty mouth feel. Mild earthy and fruity finish with another dash of yeast."
"Pours a clouded gold with a white head. Funky and smooth nose. Flavor is a magnificent combo of yeast, citrus and funk. It's beautiful. Feel has a smooth liquid end and the carbonation has a bit of a sharp bite. Overall smooth though. There's a reason why this is the standard for saisons. Don't know the reason? Try it and you'll see."
"Poured from a 11.2oz bottle into a Saison DuPont glass. A whipped cream head develops and reaches above the rim of the glass. Hazy pale orange/yellow with sparkling carbonation bubbles and many fine particulates floating around. Aroma of banana and a dry yeasty funky sourness. Taste is tart, hints of banana and spice, slightly warming from the alcohol Fills the belly with joy. Goes down super smooth despite the high carbonation. A delicious farmhouse ale. Refreshing and highly recommended."
"Yummy!"
"Drinkability is moderate to high. Good flavor and low alcohol make this beer easy to consume and enjoy at length."
"Pours deep golden opaque/cloudy orange with a fluffy/billowing white head. Aroma is yeasty and citrus sweet with a surprising kick of hops! Flavor is sweet citrus, yeast and herbs. Finishes with a nice kick of yeast in the sinus and a dry hoppy throat. Medium body with great lacing. Definitely my favorite Saison! Great for the warm spring and summer months. This is what a Saison should taste like. The benchmark, in my opinion, of any American or Belgian/French attempts at this style. Very well executed."
"Could have more than a few of these to my detriment I am sure."
"Crisp aroma is rich and fruity, more like a cider than a beer. It pours out a cloudy golden with a thick, off-white head. Flavor is fruity and crisp with hints of malt and just a trace of hops. Texture is lively, jazzy and jagged - it fairly dances on the tongue and on its way down the pipes."
"For the price, I would definitely recommend this one. Good light beer, easy to enjoy without feeling overpowering."
"Refreshing, approachable, affordable, & thirst quenching. Certainly worth revisiting again."
"D- great example of saison and very enjoyable/drinkable, but not my favorite. recommended for style"
"I was a bit disappointed, but I think the green bottle might have something to do with it. I just can't figure out why anyone would use a green bottle when we all know that it does the beer harm."
"D- This is my answer for: ""if you could only drink one beer for the rest of your life."" Linked up nicely with the seafood quesodilla I was having at the time."
"D: Rather drinkable, but perhaps not as refreshing as Hennepin. Still a solid saison, though."
"This beautiful beer pours a hazy orange color with extremely good head retention and belgian lacing. There is some light pepper and citrus aroma and an earthy bready belgian yeast aroma. The flavors replicate the aroma and this beer really is a world class example of the style. It is decidedly on the dry side, but with an excellent palate profile of pepper, citrus and honey. The beer has a fairly good mouthfeel for a beer with a lot of wheat in it. It's easy to drink and pretty refreshing."
"Paired with some big-holed Swiss and Indian tandoori bread. The bitter edge of the cheese works well with the similarly bitter edge of the beer. The two make one another taste so much better and the bread is just good. Really, I can't recall Swiss ever tasting so good."
"M/D: Smooth on the tongue, carbonation is contained well. Decent drinkability. A good saison. Not as good as I thought it would be, but still good."
"Notes: This is an excellent representation of the style and better than the Cynicale that I had earlier today in that it's a lot more delicate and nuanced. Good stuff"
"Poured a hazy yellow/orange color with a big head of white foam. The thick lacing clung to the glass as a small amount of sediment danced in the ample carbonation. The smell was a yeasty/bready aroma with hints of pear, green apple, fresh cut grass and spice. This ale had a slight taste of sourdough bread followed by a slightly citric frutiness. It finished off dry and slightly bitter. Excellent example of this style of farmhouse ale."
"D - A beautifully balanced saison that for whatever reason I found incredibly hard to pin down and describe. Very drinkable, I imagine it would pair wonderfully with a wide array of food. A must try."
"drinkability: strong"
"Pours cloudy bright gold with a huge everlasting fluffy white head. Spicy yeasty earthy aroma. Lemons and apples. Spicy as well. Taste is somewhat sweet with some spiciness, fruit, and earthy flavors coming through. Finishes dry with some herbal hoppiness. Well balanced and quite complex. Above all really delicious. Medium bodied and lightly carbonated. Amazingly drinkable. I love this one. An awesome beer."
"750ml, Has anyone ever confused this with a hefeweizen? Color and palate seem very similar. I've had this beer plenty of times but my 1st rating of it when the beer is in front of me. Aroma is captivating. Some slight bitter and off flavors on the finish. Floral, hay, summer day in the mountains cool refreshing type of beer, yet still showing a lot of hops. Could see how this could be considered the model all other Saison's are produced from. There is a weight and concentration I can't remember any other Saison having. I believe the cork was branded with the year, 2008. Very nice feature."
"d: full-flavored, yet still subtle. very complex. great example of the style. easy to see why it has such a great reputation."
"Overall - A great tasty beer! I really enjoyed this beer a lot and can't wait to get another bottle."
"M/D - Chewy and crisp feel. Very easy drinking beer."
"After looking at the other reviews people I've seen a lot of funk taste flying around so I am curious about that. Having this one chilled from a green bomber in my Duvel bubbler. Aromas of banana, coriander, lemon zest, and orange peel waft into my nazel cavities. Taste isn't too funky, maybe I could trick my mind by picturing a barnyard but not much of a petting zoo taste. I'm getting some earthy tastes like a Bordeaux and then the wit beer quality comes out but that's about it. A nice brew, good and summery. Cheers!"
"As effervescent in initial mouthfeel as it was in appearance, becoming well-rounded, full-bodied but not overwhelming. Crisp and complex taste throughout, with notes I hadn't detected in the nose (unsurprisingly, given how much there is to smell and taste in this farmhouse ale). Fruit, with some nice tartness, and grain. Hops also not to be ignored."
"Really nice effort. Last night after dinner we chose another saison to try this evening. I will be back for more DuPont later this summer."
"Pours a super-hazed glowing orange color, big fluffy white head slowly dissipates and leaves pretty good lacing on the glass, lots and lots of tiny floaties roaming around. Smells spicy, earthen, some faint lemon and pepper, great aromas on this beer. Taste is wheaty, some pear and citrus, more pepper, some slight bitter lemon. Really refreshing, incredibly crisp and dry, really hitting the spot on a muggy July night. Seems like a really good representation of the style... a total classic, and I can see why this one is so highly rated."
"D - A very tasty, very refreshing Saison. 6.5%ABV is a bit high to make it a session beer but a few on a hot Summers day wouldn't be out of order. Then again tonight is a cold Winter night and it's still pretty good."
"After reading about the Saison ales in the latest edition of Beer Advocate I decided that I had to try some. The most prominent of the Saison ales is this one Saison DuPont and now I know why. Poured a golden orange into my Leffe Chalice with noticeable yeast particles... Unfiltered indeed. The head was at least two fingers and it was retained throghout. The taste is fruitful and enjoyable. Crisp clean taste gives way to one of the better beers I have ever had. I will definitely be seeking this out again on my next trip to my beer store."
"This beer is so good, How good is it? This beer is so good, you should drink it."
"A hazy orangish yellow ale huge white head, lacing and quite effervensent. Aroma of spice, yeast, and notes of citrus (lemon). Flavor of fresh dough, spice and esters from yeast. Dry finish and light body makes this a refreshing and incredibly quafable ale. Its a wonderful summer ale. At 6.5% abv, being bone dry and relatively light bodied, it hits my sweet spot!"
"Edit from 1/23/11. No change in score, but the beer is on tap at Max's today, and the bartender (Jason) served me a 32 ounce glass of this beer. That'll surely never happen again, and I thought that by itself was deserving of a short note."
"I've been reluctant to splurge for the 750 mL bottle in stores, but I might have to, and bring it to a party where white wine drinkers and some shellfish might be served. I put my money on the Dupont!"
"Wonderfully drinkable, Saison Dupont is light, flavorful, and finishes clean."
"Drinkability - Great soft finish. Slightly on the chalky side."
"Drinkability is good."
"This is a fantastic beer. I could drink this damn near all night. I enjoyed every drop and will gladly come back for more. Highly recommended."
"Saison Dupont pours a clear golden color with a very thick, fizzy white head. It smells of yeast, pear, citrus, sour hops, and a hint of champagne. The taste is complex--hops, pear, citrus, and herbal; there is some bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is very carbonated, it almost burns the inside of your mouth. This is a drinkable beer that can leave quite an impression but maybe not something I would drink every day."
"My first Saison, and I'm not disappointed in the least. A delicious beer."
"D: low-moderate ABV, slightly dry, somewhat tart. I think 1-2 of these in a session would do just fine, probably not more."
"The hard edges soften on the carbonation and the mouthfeel really smooths out as the beers warms a tad. Great beer on what was a 112F day. Drinkable for some many occasions."
"($4.99, 375ml, Oliver's Bev., Albany, NY)"
"Finish is dry, crisp, very smooth. Not much lingering flavor, but it's very pleasant with the high carbonation balancing beautifully the relatively full body. Recommended."
"D - Very smooth and not nearly as intense as the smell would suggest. Fairly crisp and full of great savory flavors, somewhat unusual for any beer. Much softer than it's American cousin, Hennepin."
"Had this beer with a meal of grilled salmon and shrimp at Scutra in Arlington, MA. An excellent beer (and restaurant) for the meal and for the warm summer night on which both were consumed. The waitress poured the beer straight into the bottom of a tall glass, which created a massive head that erupted with a bready, fruity aroma. The head dissolved quickly except for the final inch. The color of the beer is hazy yellow-orange, which is quite beautiful. The initial carbonation stings a bit and then disappears, leaving behind the flavors of clove, peaches, apples and whole-wheat bread. A bit of bitterness follows. Alcohol was lower than I expected, so having two was not a problem. Drinking this saison was absolute delight."
"Drinkability : drinks like a 4%abv beer. Great beer for texas summers."
"D: Very light, refreshing and drinkable. Nice summer beer...especially when paired with stronger foods. A little sour on the end...perhaps I cellared this one too long. Will have to try another."
"A superb example of the style. This is one of those beers that goes beyond being a tasty beverage and can transport you to the farmhouses of belgium. A great treat to drink in the backyard on a starry summer night, I would recommend as a must try to anyone who is a fan of the style."
"D - Refreshing and easily drinkable. The earthy and spicy notes blend well with the herbal hop character. A true classic."
"375ml corked bottle served in a Duvel glass. Poured a pale gold with a huge white head. Clove and citrus in the aroma with some burnt sugar. Lots of spicy flavors. Light body, spritzy mouthfeel. Dry finish. Yeast seems to add more spice. Very refreshing. Nice beer."
"Poured from corked and caged 750ml bottle into a very large Red wine glass. Careful pour yields a nice 3 finger pure white head with very nice retention. As head diminishes leaves a moderate lacing on sides of glass. Beer pours a very nice almost transparent straw amber. Smells of light malt, slight candy sweetness and a bit of pepper. Taste of light sweet malt b, hints of candy sugar, nice hop bitterness in finish. Finishes very dry which is nice on a hot day. I was expecting some slight fruit esters however none have come through. Solid mouthfeel, not too thin or cloying. Drinkablity is also solid as this is not a heavy beer, or overly alcoholic. Over all this is a very nice beer as reflected in my rating and serves as a solid introduction to a brewer I have not previously sampled. I will be looking for more dupont products in the future."
"D - I love this beer. Enough said."
"D: I am sure I will get me some again, I did like it, I would hope that they make some smaller bottles"
"2.darker bottle to prevent uv light damage"
"Drinkability is very good, this is one of my favorites, a world classic. Paired tonight with grilled spring chinook, oysters and asparagus - perfect! Still, I generally prefer the fruitier saisons then the pepper of Dupont."
"I will say it again, just beautiful and what every Saison should be. A style and beer that I have been incredibly intrigued with from the beginning, and that obsession still continues.  A masterpiece."
"definately a great Saison!"
"Although it is not my favorite for the style, it is very drinkable and extremely enjoyable."
"What a refreshing and amazingly drinkable beer."
"Seems like a perfect companion for a hot summer day. Will buy again!"
"375ml bottle. Very cloudy yellow, lots of head and lacing. Smell is very light malt, bread, candy sugar, lemon citrus, lots of yeast. Taste is pretty similar, lots of citrus, herbs, very light malt, yeasty. Some interesting dry bitterness at the finish. Very coarse, high carbonation. All in all, this is just an incredibly clean, crisp, refreshing farmhouse ale. Great beer for hot weather."
"i had this with a salmon and warm vinaigrette salad and it went perfect, i imagine it would be good with many light foods"
"This is a very good saison, but I think I will stick with Hennepin. I definitely recommend it though."
"This is a good Farmhouse Saison and probably the best session one of the bunch."
"Upgrading my rating after having this on tap at The Back Abbey in Claremont, CA. Came served in a nice little Saison Dupont Glass, probably about 10-12oz worth. The taste was even better and refreshing from what I remembered for the bottle I had, and the mouthfeel was about as good as I think it could be. Just really enjoyed this on tap."
"D: The only thing that reduces the session characteristics of this one for me is the huge amount of carbonation."
"This is easily my favorite sunny weather beer, and might just be my favorite beer overall. I'm amazed with it every time I stuff my nose down in the glass for another sip."
"Try this alongside a good (homemade or otherwise) crawfish étouffée, or other flavourful Cajun cuisine; also with Thai food (anything with peanut sauce and lime). You won't be disappointed with the pairing."
"Overall, due to the cleansing feel, probably great with food. Not spectacular but still good."
"Appearance is golden in color with a thick head. Smell has an deep earthiness to it with spice and citrus. Taste is earthy, light with a big hit of carbonation with a bitter saline aftertaste, (reminding me of a club soda). mouthfeel is light and dry, not what I really expected, but still a good experience."
"D: Overall, this is a drinkable beer. Saisons are a quirky style and Dupont has done well with this one."
"Golden brew carefully poured raises an astonishingly gigantic rocky, chunky head of foam that recedes slowly,. lac everywhere, beautiful. Aromas are fantastic, a lemony-herbal-spicy kaleidoscope of aromas, hit of funk, wonderful. Crisply effervescent and light on the tongue...just a gorgeous, fantastically drinkable, refreshing and crisp yet beguilingly complex brew. Lemons, apples, chamomile, coriander, wheat grass. A lovely interplay of sweetness up front giving way to a dance between tartness and bitterness that Makes the palate sing. One of my all time favorites, I am so happy to finally try this. It won't be my last..."
"d- well, if I could afford it I would never stop drinking it, but then I would become 500 pound in a few months. So I guess it is a good thing this thing is 10 bucks a bottle."
"A crisp bitterness and slightly fruity, pepper-like flavors are found in this Belgian ale. Fairly light-bodied Saison DuPont is my choice as a favorite beer to quaff while sitting on my balcony on a warm summer day. A very dry crisp ale with a dry finish that always leaves you wanting some more. The addition of wheat makes the beer a bit smooth despite the high carbonation. A rare classic from Belgium that should be savored."
"The pour is the color of pale hazy golden hay, with a large and finely fluffy cloud white top. Funky, fruity, and phenolic smelling with hints of flowery sweetness. Dynamite mouthfeel full of fine, tickling carbonation. The taste has a soft sweetness upfront, with tart apple/pear fruitiness. Yeasty and funky with a peppery spice and a touch of bitterness lingers for just a bit in the finish. Very good. I am a big fan of this one."
"D= The hype is justified! I will go a long way off the beaten path for more of this fine ale."
"D: A light, tasty beer that would go well with food or as an after work drink to relax with."
"D: An outstandingly refreshing beer for a warm day. This is a great thirst quencher that goes well with a wide range of foods (I'm pairing it with spicy turkey sausage)."
"D: While this tends to lean towards a little nicer to drink, I think I'd prefer it as a sipper over swigging."
"Notes : I like this, but it's not a staple in the fridge. I'd buy another single of it, but it won't be for a while... I think JP's Bam Biere was a bigger hit with me."
"Overall, I was hoping for alot more. Probably pretty good underneath, but just doesn't work."
"D: Not bad"
"From a bottle, this poured a cloudy gold with a nice foamy head and good lacing. Big nose of citrus, floral hops, and spices. Rich and delicious mouthfeel. Favors are wonderful with citrus, flowers, fruit, and hops. Slightly sour finish. Fantastic brew."
"Very nice overall. Again, not my fav. style, but given the givens...."
"Pours a flat golden color with a huge pillow-like, thick white head. The aroma is of citrus, sweet sugary candies, slight hops, and some funkiness. The taste is more complex: tart fruits - grapes, lemon, orange - definite funk, and just enough hops to accompany the sweetness of this beer. It has a light body and finishes somewhat dry. Great beer...definitely an outstanding Saison!"
"Not bad, but I expected a better experience. My question of what's so great about farmhouse ale remains unanswered at this point."
"A three finger plus off white head easily reaches the rim of the glass without effort. The body is a hazy dark golden straw colored hue. A breakup of lace is left around the glass as the lace receeds. Nose has distinct piney notes stacked on top of fresh wheat notes and noticeable hop characteristics. Yeasty fruit laced notes are also there. At first sip you get a slight instense of sour that quickly yields to a mineral and spicey balance that is all over the tongue. Very crisp and well rounded with lots of fresh veggie notes all wraped around nice dry fruity tones. Dryness is inhanced by a soft hop profile and slight bitterness. This beer gets even more mellow and much better as it warms. Mouthfeel is very clean and oh so drinkable. The more I drink good Saisons, the more I like them. This one is very very good."
"D: Not my favorite style but have been enjoying more as of late. This one was great with garlic mussels and the perfect match. Easily could have several in a sitting as it doesnt become boring. Summertime would be good for this one."
"Yellow-orange with slight haze. Lots of carbonation. Large, lasting, off-white, rocky head. Some sediment. Lemony, spicy aroma with some yeasty, musty notes. Sharp, cirtic, spicy, bitter flavor. Long bitter/sour finish. Strong peppery phenol notes in flavor and finish. Light body. Very dry palate and finish. Very refreshing, effervescent mouthfeel."
"Poured f/ 750 ml bottle into snifter. Pillowy, puffed two finger head floats to the top. Lemon zest with some earth, a touch of farmy/leathery smell. Taste is wonderful! Crisp sour green apples, some fresh soil earthyness, sweet green grapes, mixed with a champaign-esque mouthfeel. Wonderful!"
"D- Yummy. This is very drinkable. I loved every moment."
"Certainly very well recommended."
"Taste - Estery with flavors of banana and pineapple. Light acidity with a subtle spiciness. Notes of citrus come out more as the beer sits in the mouth. Extremely dry in the finish, with a lemon peel-like bitterness that remains on the palate for several minutes."
"As perhaps one of the most widely known depictions of the Saison style, copped this 11.2 oz brew singly from Gary's in Madison... what an amazing sample! This is a world-class, top-notch brew, true to the style, and above and beyond the average by far... superb hazy, cloudy appearance with impressive foamy head that had some staying power... smell was full of fresh citrus and a powerful sweet aroma... taste was complete with grapefruits, lemon, and a wonderful, lucid, crisp, clear taste that delivered and left little to be desired... one of the better brews I've sampled... full of chracter, quality, and style... definitely a must-try... this beer commands respect and is definitely one of the best representations of the style... Definitely recommended..."
"This went down quite easily, and I can see this going well with many other types of food, especially anything with a little spice, or on a nice warm day."
"D- It was an easy sipper. It had an interesting flavor, yet was quite refreshing."
"D-- i could drink a few of these but would eventually have to switch styles to something very bitter since the belgian styles arent my favorite...but i enjoy having a few due to the complexity of the flavors and they arent usually as strong so i can have a few in a row...very tasty i will grab a 4 pack next time im out.."
"Taste of anise and cork, interesting. A lot of tastes that are hard to describe, spicy with hints of clove and cinnamon, I am not sure. The hops are very much in balance with the yeast and malt. A nice gentle bitterness comes in after the yeast and complements the beer. Super balance and complex!"
"Very refreshing beer, as we say ""fris en fruitig"" (fresh and fruity)"
" yes, they are drinkable"
"Fully hazed orange, I couldn't avoid pouring the yeast. Fluffy, frothy white head leaves some nice rings on the glass as it drops to a thick whipped topping. The nose is herbal spicy yeast and a powdery sweetness. Dried bananas, yellow cake, and a hint of incense...perfectly Belgian. Flavors of bitter orange and light fruity yeast. Leafy hops and gentle sweetness. Medium-light bodied...smooth, seemingly getting creamier as its sits in the glass. Classic Belgian beer all around. A great choice anytime, very drinkable."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is a good beer to drink for a long time, especially if you're in the mood for the style."
"This beer is a hazy golden color with a foamy one finger head. This beer smells crisp and clean with a tart green apple finish. The taste is dry and has a mild astringent taste. Despite this, this beer would be a perfect compliment to a hot summer day (as traditionally intended), even though I am drinking it on a cold day in January. The crispness of this beer is seriously impressive. The carbonation is soft and provides a mellowness to compliment the borderline sourness of the beer. The body is light. This beer goes down very nicely, however the astringent and sour tastes create a struggle on some gulps. Very good beer."
"I remember having this fresh and from what i can tell not very much has happened. It still tastes great and makes for an excellent thirst-quencher or a pairing with some spicy food. One of the better saisons i've come across. Recommended!"
"D-Good drinkability. This is the type of beer I would drink on a hot summer day. It is clean, crisp and has good quality flavors. There isnt really anything I would criticize about this beer at all."
"D: Refreshing!"
"c'est une bière de belle couleur dorée pâle trouble avec un col blanc immense onctueux, elle possède un nez invitant classique d'ale belge, sa bouche est épicée, elle est piquante, et agréable. bonne bière"
"Beer poured a beautiful cloudy pale yellow body that produced a large foamy white head. Nose is a great blend of Belgian yeast, fruity citrus, and floral hops. Taste is dominant of Belgian yeast upfront with fruity citrus finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and is extremely smooth. It is nicely carbonated. Overall drinkability is very good. This is a very good example of the style."
"Had 3 of these in my cellar, figured Id pop one and see how its going. Poured into and oversize wine glass. In the bottle, this appeared much clearer than my 07.s. In the glass it is similar except that the head is twice the size and stays that way. Much skunkier, spicier smell than 07. Also much more carbonated. The cork hit the ceiling. The nose is absolutely dilectable for a farmhouse saison. sweet, spicy, fruity nose. The first sip is very fruity and smooth. The hop taste follows with almost a coriander, fruit taste and spicy tones, with slightly skunky mixtures ( It is in a green bottle!) the finish has reduced in bitterness with its two years of age. The mouthfeel is silkier than fresh bottles and the carbonation is more intense. Drinkability is very good. A pleasure to drink, a fine saison."
"The taste is slightly bitter and has a little bit malt to complement the earthy yeast flavor. It is a little dry in the mouth similar to a chardonnay. Overall a darn complex beer for a tyro like myself but very enjoyable and will buy again."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Definitely not impressed by mouthfeel either. Very low carbonation, feels almost flat in the mouth, not very pleasing. This is one I might buy again, if only to give it a second chance, I'll be sure to get it from a place where I can see that it is stored properly. From what I can tell now this brew isn't all that great, not much flavor, and its not all that great. As a matter of fact, I am glad that I've had Hennepin before this; because if this were the first of the style I'd ever tasted I'd be turned off to it."
"D: This is one of the better saisons I've ever had, and it's tasty. Though I'm not a huge fan of the style, this is a damn fine one."
"D- This is a great saison and I am very happy to have tried it. I will certainly have it again when I come across it again. One of my favorites from the style-at a near sessionable ABV."
"The appearance, tartness and mouthfeel may have a staunch wine lover considering a bottle or two. Saison DuPont and broiled shrimp are a solid pairing."
"One must pour this beer unhurriedly, otherwise it will get a huge head that lingers forever. It poured a fantastic deep yellow/amber with plenty of constant fizz. I smelled some citrus and took a sip. Very bubbly in the mouth but pleasant. Tasted zesty with a little pepper and apple. I was expecting a lot more wild yeast flavors (like I have tasted in the Ommegang Omeggeddon) but they were very mild. This beer is really well-balanced and leaves your palette fairly quickly making you want more. Excellent."
"Drinkability: Supreme drinkability and wonderfully refreshing."
"Poured a hazy pale straw color with a thick and luscious white head (be careful with your pour) and beautiful belgian lacing which adhered to the glass throughout the entire session. Floral smell with the presence of clove, wheat and hops. Somewhat thin, but not unpleasant mouthfeel; surprisingly little effervescence in the mouth considering the head. Taste of cloves, corriander and more floral/herbal undertones. Slightly bitter finish. Would make an excellent summer session beer."
"Overall a great selection ,especially while watching the Sox beat the Rox ."
"D - So well done it's easy to enjoy a 750ml and feel satisfied and refreshed. Nice to not be knocked off my feet as some of the higher ABV boundry pushing beers are wont to do."
"Great stuff. It's not overly extreme or complicated, but it does have depth and excellent drinkability. This would be most heavenly after doing some hard physical labor in the summertime, but I'll take it on a chilly autumn day like today, or just about anytime."
"Final Note: I can see how drinking too many beers like this might turn one into a 'beer snob', but I highly recommend trying this at least once."
"A 750ml bottle with 2 2007 stamped on the cork. An orange color with a beautiful thick white head. Fruity aroma, mostly apple. a little yeast also. A nice fruity taste, again the yeast, and a dry, somewhat bitter finish. A good session beer, fun to drink."
"Beer pours a pale, grainy color with a decent amount of head that leaves thick lacing. I decided to let the beer warm up before trying it. Aroma is rich and spicy with faint hints of raisin. Taste is very light at first with only the spice and raisin showing through. Goes down smooth. A second sip confirms the smoothness and maltiness. I feel that the beer isn't as strong as I hoped and it just seems unimpressive to me. Not bad but I'll definitely revisit down the road."
"This makes for a decent session. I expected a little more. I actually found a bottle of this after I had traded for it, so I'll try the traded version after this and see if it is any different."
"Anyway, this beer pours a slighly cloudy medium-golden into a small Sinha glass. Huge fluffy head that I have to fight to prevent it from overflowing. Pretty decent looking, in fact. Aroma is restrained, mildly sour, and fruity. Very little of that barnyard flavour I'd been expecting, and more spicy. Mouthfeel is much more light and spritzy than I remembered, and that may be the biggest disappointment. Flavour is peppery, spicy, mildly sour, with a little bit of lemon but none of the funk I want to see in a farmhouse ale. Still, it's fairly refreshing if that's what you're looking for. The aftertaste is a little on the tart side, but fairly clean. I'll definitely get through the case, but might not make it a regular purchase."
"I would highly recommend trying this beer. It is also great in bottles where it provided an even stronger aroma. On draft seasonally at Max's. I found it at Astor liquor in Laurel in 11.2 oz bottles."
"D = I couldn't sit and pound these, but it's a special treat and I enjoyed it thoroughly."
"Hazy, ruddy orange color with a head that goes on and on. High carbonation level. Musty and earthy aroma. Wet straw like. You can smell the farmhouse in there! Somewhat sweet, dried fruit flavor. Again earthy and musty. Dry, sharp finish to it. Good mouthfeel-the high level of carbonation makes it quite lively on the palate. An all around great beer. I think this might be the first saison I ever had years ago. Still a great, great beer."
"375 ml corked bottle from Bevmo. Pours a rich unfiltered golden color with a huge white head that fades very slowly. Aroma is strong with notes of yeast, sour grapes, breads, and grass. Flavor is understated compared to the aroma. There is a complex mellowness to this concoction that is mostly sweet with notes of wheat, almonds, biscuit, and pears. Hops were well embedded and showed only toward the finish. Mouthfeel was very full, smooth, and silky. Finish was long, hoppy, dry and semi-sweet. Overall: this is a beer that I would drink at any occasion. I think it might go particularly well with seafood. Highly Recommended"
"D: Refreshing and versitile .. can drink with or without food for one or more drinks ..."
"I love this beer! Could drink on any given day, preferably a sunny afternoon. Would like to go for a robust chicken salad. Good reputation and understandably so."
"A slightly cloudy golden color with a thick white head. I was sure not to get any of the yeast on the initial pour. The aroma was slightly citrusy but with a sour note that almost smelled like the beer was bad. The flavor was not what I expected. Only a bit of citrus poked through the musty dry flavor. There was an abundance of bitterness. I actually had a hard time finishing the entire 750. Mouthfeel was pretty light but not a beer I'll drink again unless I go to back to belgium."
"D: A great all-around beer, could do lots of things with it, from relaxing poolside or pairing it with a 5-course meal, very versatile beer, a tad pricey, but worth it every time."
"A very drinkable beer, very clean and refreshing. My first time trying this but it won't be the last. Would even make a great session beer if not for the price, but it's also a perfect beer to break out a bottle or two for those special occasions."
"Comment: I enjoy Saisons as a change of pace from other Belgiums. This is a very refreshing beer that belongs in the lineup for summer parties and picnics."
"Awesome beer."
"Edit: I was going to change my review because 3.85 seems awfully low for a beer this enjoyable. However, I noticed that other reviewers noticed the skunkiness. It is unfortunate that the shippers and distributors aren't helping but neither is the green bottle. I let my scoring stand but if you can let the skunkiness flash off then this is a great beer well worth drinking."
"-Oelergud"
"Pours lemony-yellow with a huge rocky, three finger massive head, leaving lacing all over the glass. Very inviting. Aroma is grassy/hoppy. Flavor is dry/herbal-hoppy/spicy with a very dry finish. Spicy notes in the aftertaste and a slight alcohol presence. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing, easy to drink. Agian, my favorite beer, all around."
"Notes: What a strange brew this is. It's my first of the saison style, and probably won't be my last. My only complaint, and the thing that will probably keep me from buying this for wuite sometime is the hefty price that comes on a glass of this. It was about 6 dollars... Ouch."
"Wow: this is delicious. Notes of wheat, fruit, and honey complement organic grasses, vanilla, coriander spice, and (not too) sweet malts. Some alcohol peeks through as well. Mouthfeel is crisp, a bit on the dry side, but bubbly and refreshing. A bitter bite on the end lets you know some spicy hops are at work. I'd probably have this beer every day if my liver and budget would allow it. Definitely a worthwhile Saison."
"Pours with a towering white head which takes quite some time to settle over the super yeast sedimented pale orangey-golden liquid. Nose is loaded with ""horse blanket"" aromas and fruitiness mingling with a light maltiness and yeastiness. The taste is wonderfully light bodied and hoppy, with lots of fruity overtones coupled with an effervescent carbonation makes this a very refreshing and tasty (and winning)combination. Thge finish is damm near perfect, with the fruity/sweet flavors morphing into a gorgeously hoppy, dry long finish...this is one outstanding Saison, if you see it, try it!"
"This is a tale of two beers. I sampled it after letting it sit out for a little while. I started pretty cold and it seemed pretty pedestrian (about a 6/10). As it warms, it smooths out and becomes more complex."
"Wow! Will fight with Hennepin for space in my shopping carriage."
"Very good saison- i was apprehensive at first- the cork popped and all i could smell was skunk. I was pleasantly surprised that the taste was quite the opposite. The pour was light golden with a huge billowing head and great sustained lacing. Extremely light body, great carbonation and smooth going down. Very subtle belgian spiciness, grassy, earthy and very fresh. There is a slight yeasty sourness which helps round out the finish. Definately needs to be paired with some quality food, it can only make it better. This one transported me elsewhere, and what else can you ask of a good beer than that."
"It came corked in dark green glass. Watch your eyes as the cork pushed its way out as soon as I removed the wire cap. A huge creamy white head. The smell is thich with malt, yeast and spice. Classic belgium beer. The taste is nice with notes of yeast and spice with a slight hint of alchol. Very nice beer for a hot day by the grill."
"Pleasant, but really quite short of spectacular."
"You have to wait a bit for the head to settle, but it remains huge as I take my first sip. First sip blows me away as it has greater depth than I've ever experienced in another saison. There are many layers of flavors that dramatically change with such quickness it is difficult to discern each and pick apart everything judiciously. It begins like a typical saison with a lemon zest taste and then moves to a peppery hop bitterness. The finish is dry, but the aftertaste develops a life of its own with full flavored bitterness unlike any other. Ample carbonation in this one does not detract from its flavor, but seems to warm the palate. Highly complex and drinkable brew. Everything you want in a saison taken to a new level."
"Drinkability is very good, an awesome summer beer and a benchmark representative of the farmhouse style, much like Duvel and Belgian golden ales. One that I always like having around, a wonderful ale for Florida weather."
"A hoppy, but not so bitter belgian. The nose is funky hops, gotta love it, and the malt doesn't do much. It mostly provides a nice, sweet backbone. The grassy hops and farmhouse aromas dominate and carry through into the aftertaste. All the while, the carbonation provides a Duvel-like feel with a similar fluffy white head."
"Overall, highly drinkable. The perfect summer beer in my opinion. Very complex and tasty. When I think of this style, this is the beer that comes to mind."
"Which is we're I'm headed right now . . . ."
"mimic the nose. I heard one reviewer describe this as his ""Desert Island Beer", but it is a little too hoppy for that in my opinion. However, it is undeniably a great summer beer: light, lemony and fresh."
"A very interesting beer, and the first true example of the style I've had. Can't say it's my favourite, but an interesting experience."
"Juicy at first, with a building dry, herbal character that builds, and remains long after the finish. Crackery, with clove, lemon peel, and hops. It's an extremely balanced blend that is deceptively simple at first. Dry aftertaste commands you to continue sipping until it's gone. Light herbal hop dances on the tongue for a long while. Perfect with Brie, aged Gruyere, or any number of cheeses."
" Body is nice, bubbly, and airy, again with a dry finish. Highly drinkable, this is an excellent, thirst-quenching ale that sets the standard for the saison style."
"D  This beer is quite easy to drink it is very smooth and well balanced."
"Excellent Saison. A nice crisp and clean summer beer that packs a lot of flavor. Super drinkable, and enjoyable in the warm Redding weather."
"So the famous Dupont arrives in Alberta, coming in the single 330ml brown bottle. Simple labelling here, dark green mostly except for some white and red. Very little information on the beer itself, save the ABV and the location in Belgium. The beer from Tourpes pours into my chalice a cloudy peach/nectarine hue, with a two finger cream-coloured head, chunky, pillowy, and fine-bubbled. Yes very cloudy beer indeed, with soft little tiny chunks floating freely. The aroma reminds me of a combination of Tripel Karmeliet with Kwak, which to me is an exceptional thing. Very soft malts, a little butterscotch, massive hits of bitter yeast, some metallic notes, ripened fruit, especially prunes and peaches, figs, and definitely some touches of lime even. The malt asserts itself the more the beer warms, and by room temperature the soft caramel aromas mixed with the yeast and buttery fruits make an excellent overall impression on the nose. Sensational. I'll say it again: very similar to Tripel Karmeliet's aroma. The taste is a little bit of a chameleon, equal parts tart and bitter. In fact it is much more bitter than I anticipated. The finish is all iron-like metal and plenty of grainy hops. Extremely effervescent mouthfeel; easy to see why this would be quenching on a warm day on the farm. Absolutely classic Belgian yeast taste, giving the dryness of Saaz with the flavour of Fuggles. Very classic taste, but all in all, for me personally, I was expecting a fuller and sweeter taste. As it stands, every point is flawless. It just doesn't excite my tastebuds overmuch. Still this is a classic example of the saison style, and I am glad it is finally available here locally. Prosit!"
"Great stuff, quite drinkable, though the alcohol does catch up with you eventually."
"D - Excellent. This beer is extremely drinkable. A bit surprising they serve it in such small bottles."
"Eric"
"Pairs divinely with a nice blue cheese."
"D: I have ready some reports that say this is the ""best beer in the world"". I wouldn't go as far as to say that, but this is defenitely a very distinctive brew (I have never heard of another brewery who brews this exact style), refreshing, not too strong, and something every beer enthusiast should try."
"This beer has a nice slightly hazy orange/straw color combination with a good head that lingers and then leaves good lacing. Nose is yeast, wheat, orange, and hints of white pepper and lemon. Taste is great, with an earthy/clay yeast flavor and bits of hoppy goodness. Some spices come through as well as citrus. Mouthfeel is quite good, very full and frothy. Highly drinkable. Excellent example of a saison."
"The brew was very drinkable. I also noticed some of my colleagues (even those who aren't fond of strong-tasting beer) were ordering a second (and some even a third!) glass."
"they drop by the house."
"The appearance was cloudy and bright yellow. It had a superb head; white and pillowy. The taste was slightly spicy and a little fruity.This beer was very easy to drink and I am sure it is probably good on a hot day. The only problem for me is the price. $9 is a little too much for me to spend on what amounts to two average ABV beers. This would be nice if it were in a $10 six pack."
"Well attenuated with lots of carbonation. Extremely drinkable (too bad a 750mL bottle costs $9.50). Paired with mussels and french fries (traditional Belgian meal)."
"The alcoholic presence in the taste builds up and become more and more evident, but pleasant. This one worked it's way into my heart. Wasn't too impressed at first, almost in love two glasses later."
"Very drinkable, but ultimately too boring for me. I like a more assertive beer than this, but I don't know that I can blame Dupont specifically for this-- I've had the same issues with other Saisons I've tried. People go on and on about the complexity here, but I'm willing to be crass and unsophisticated about this one; it's just not bold enough or surprising enough for me."
"Drinkability good as a easy drinking, lower ABV Belgian should be."
"D - Sweet, tart, fruity, complex, and thirst quenching. You couldn't ask for a more drinkable beer...except maybe if it were a bit cheaper."
"The smell is sweet, alcoholic and yeasty. Kind of like white bread made with lots of sugar. The colour is hazy pale yellow, almost like cheap orange punch. The head is nice and thick, sprinkled with small nibblets of the yeast. The initial taste is very citric and yeasty. After a few seconds the bread and bitterness kicks in. Maybe a hint of some red berries in there too? It feels a bit dry on the tongue but it's a great summer beer. Perhaps a close cousin of a witbier?"
"had this on-tap at the hopleaf, and it poured a clear straw yellow/light orange. the bouqet was somewhat subtle, maybe it was because i was drinking this between some stronger, hoppier beers. it definitely had the unique aromas of belgian yeasts going on, smelled very much like a duvel. also some light bready notes and vegetal/grassy aromas. taste was just a hint of malt sweetness and a moderate amount of hops mixed in. light in body and spritzy carbonation but not artificially so. medium finish. would try it again if the price is right."
"Always great....easy to get through a 750ml. A classic."
"I'm a new and eager student of Belgian beers and I am loving using this as my study. I don't see how this beer could dissapoint anyone!"
"A delicious brew!"
"Judging by other reviews, this beer must be better from a bottle!"
"Pours a hazy golden wih a clean white head and goood lacing. Lots of sediment. The smells are of lemon, brie cheese, and light barnyard. The taste is complex, with more of the same that are in the aroma, but a lingering bitterness that doesn't seem to come from hops, maybe a slght minerality as well. More farmhouse and brie flavors here, and while there is a touch of tartness, its pretty slight and is not at all the predominant flavor. A crisp, subtle beer with complex flavors that are restrained enough for it to be a real quencher. Very nice as always."
"12.7oz green coked and caged bottle with no freshness date. Pours a cloudy medium yellow with a huge white head, decent longevity and great lace. Smells of sweet honey and citrus - mainly grapefruit. Somewhat yeasty smelling with a decent pilsner like hop aroma. Lots of grapefruit flavors mixed with slight honey. Slight yeastyness and a decent hop flavor and bitterness. High carbonation. Clean and easy drinking. A nice Saison"
"Great beer. Not just tasty, but so balanced and refreshing."
"This is a really good overall beer and good example of the style."
"Pours cloudy and golden yellow with frothy head, the head remains about 1/8 inch thoughout. Carbonation is champagne like, very effervescent. The aroma is very complex spicy and citrus, a little floral. Flavor is equally as complex with mild bitterness, nice sweetness, and various spice flavors. Medium bodied with fairly high alcohol content. Very drinkable, but definately one to savor. A classic beer!"
"Quite an enjoyable and refreshing beer. I prefer the smell to the taste, but that fact doesn't detract too much. Definitely one to have again."
"Poured in to abrandy snifter. Exceptional appearance. Huge flowing thick white head. Amazing head that has the look of vanilla icecream. Cloudy straw yellow color with bits of yeast floating around. Tons of thick lacing. The smell is very interesting. Has a very strong skunk smell. Smells like a strong lager. Has a belgian candy smell along with yeast notes. Strong lingering bitterness on the finish. The mouthfeel also is wonderful. Perfect balance of carbonation that leaves a foamy texture in the mouth. The bitterness is a bit overpowering, rendering the taste one-sided, thus limiting it's review to a 4. Very unique and definately worth a try."
"I'd like to try it with some food next time. It's nice on it's own, but it seems like a real food beer. Good stuff."
"It pours a light straw color, cloudy, with a snow white head of thick foam. It smells of yeast and fresh baked bread, I can't wait to taste it. Wow, it tastes as fresh as any beer I've had. It is not very carbonated, with a bottle conditioned beer, this is what I hoped for. I would say this is in the top five beers I have ever tasted. So drinkable, this is what our ancestors called beer!"
"Into a tulip glass, pours a beautiful light gold with a massive, frothy, fluffy white head, exceptional staying power, can bring it back easily with a swirl. Just a bit of dark sediment pairs with a lot of fine bubbling, fine carbonation for sure. The aroma is light and fine, sweet and citric, grasses, orange peel, quite delightful. And it gets even better, the citrus quite flavorful, lemon orange zesty, grassy hops again, more spices, corriander in particular. The mouth is lively, carbonated, light to medium, sweet and zesty to dry, nearly perfect for this beer. In all, to me this is the definition of its style, an exceptional beer, a classic, a favorite."
"Bottle gifted by Fisherman34- thanks for the parting gift!! Cloudy peach colour with huge billowing white head and great lacing. Aroma is of belgian spices. Taste is quite spicy with hints of sour funk. I found it fairly hoppy and had a very dry finish. I noticed some woody flavours- mostly oak. This is one refreshing brew- I could quaffe many a bottle of this belgian treat."
"Mouthfeel is wonderfully hard to pin down, at once dry and crisp, yet smooth and velvety almost in its percieved texture. Exquisite malt & grain backbone and sharp hop bite follows. Grassy, almost barn-yard aromas just detectible."
"Served a slightly hazy light orange with hardy any head. The aroma was of sweet fruits with some spice and hops. There was an interesting balance of sweetness with bitter spice, hops and yeast, it was a little on the bland side, however. The beer sat light on the tongue with a low carbonation. As far as saisons go, I'll stick with Henepin."
"I had almost forgotten why I liked this style so much. I guess it is time for me to start brewing saisons again..."
"This was my first commercial Saison (sorry Paddockwood, yours just doesn't count), and what a joy. As I mentioned, I brewed a Saison of my own last summer, and it compares very well (mine is only missing the funk), so I guess I did a good job."
"Drinkability: Nice. Easy going down, clean."
"375ml bottle purchased from Market of Choice, Coburg Rd, Eugene, OR. Pours a cloudy unfiltered yellow, much like a hefeweizen. Thick creamy white head that settles fairly quickly to a foam on the surface that stays around.... Smellwise, it has a very lambic quality to it. Tastes quite nice, a bit grapefruity, slightly pungent, but still preety good. Mouthfeel is sort of fizzy. Swallow a drink of it and you feel a fizz moving to back of the throat slowly evaporating as you swallow. Altogether not too bad of a beer, i'm sure it's very typical of the style, but i'm not sure if i'd try this again or not."
"On first taste it was quite dry and spicy. Very complex like the aroma. Tastes of green apple and a yeasty spice like flavor that is quite bitter in the aftertaste and dry as well. Lemon flavor as the beer warmed to room temp. now and slightly more alcohol flavor in the aftertaste as it warmed as well. It finishes really crisp and dry. Very much full bodied as the carbonation and overall profile leaves a very dominating experience in my memory."
"Drinks very easy for the abv, not my favorite style, but does bring back fond memories of when I toured the brewery back in 92"
"This is the first saison I've ever had. It was quite tasty, although not necessarily my preferred style. Pours a very pale yellow opaque color, with noticeable yeast left in the bottle after the first pour. Amazing frothy white foam the can only be described as billowy. Best-looking beer I've ever seen. Nose is all citrus, mostly orange. Taste is likewise citrusy, more lemon now, with some yeasty flavor as well. Tastes like a really good hefeweizen. Feel is good medium body, with a nice solid aftertaste. Overall, not my preferred beer type, but fairly delicious nonetheless. I'd probably go for something darker, but if this one's available (and who knows how much longer it will be) I'd definitely grab it up."
"Appearance is a hazy yellow with very abundant head (like a Duvel). Aroma is of spice (clove?) and is delicious. Taste is extremely smooth and relatively uncomplicated. It is clovey and also very good. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing. This beer is extremely drinkable. This beer is an uncomplicated classic responsible for (pardon the metaphor) saving its ""endangered"" species. This beer is much lighter than its American imitators (from the likes of Ommegang and Avery), but is truly excellent."
"WOW, Saison Dupont certainly has one hell of a terrific aroma that reminds me of lemons and oranges; just a very clean and citrus-like smell over all thats very pleasing to the senses. It has a nice solid, feathery head that just seems to float over its wonderful light tan/blondish body (I wonder if I poured this one out right). It has a fresh snappish taste with some mild tartness to it."
"I love this beer. Date on the cork 2006. Pours a golden yellow with a fluffy head that lets off that great funky smell. The taste is bready with sweet citrus aftertaste that hits the spot. I could drink this all day and every day. Exellent beer that I never get tired off."
"The taste of dried grains and a spicy white pepper kick quickly smoothed out with a yeasty,citrusy finish."
"good stuff"
"Amazing."
"Saison Dupont pours a hazy golden orange with an ample rocky white head. The smell is of alcohol with a little citrus. The taste is similar with the citrus more prominent. The citrus is more of a sour flavor than tart, but not a detriment. A lingering aftertaste is present too. Mouthfeel is good. Drinkability is pretty good too. Since the beer came in a 750ml bottle, It is sessionable (what else are you going to do?), but this beer is a sipper. Plan on taking a couple of hours for this bottle of beer. Recommended."
"It pours big and rocky. It gets cloudy because of the rusty sludge in the bottom of the bottle. I've been told that there is iron oxide in the water at the brewery. It makes much food taste better. It smells a little old because I've been told they use aged hops. Try it sometime...put some hops in a bowl and leave them in your beer closet (or wherever you put beer) and smell them in a year. They smell different. So rusty water and old ingredients. And they still make a fantastic beer. It tastes great with food. Try it. It is on my top 10. Pass on rawish fish. It takes the smell up into taste. However, it is the best grilled salmon beer around."
"This is a beer that goes very well with food. It was able to cut through the richness of my entree, braised veal cheeks with a cherry/veal jus."
"Pours a giant head that's frothy and foamy and hard to dissapate, it also has a good yellow and slightly cloudy color. The smell is slightly sweet brown sugar. Taste is sour and has a day old empty beer can finish to it. It's bitter harsh and barely tastes like a Saison at all. The mouthfeel is a little harsh with carbonation. Overall I will try again, just because of the name, but something went seriously wrong at John's with this bottle."
"Pours pale straw with a dull clarity. Frothy snow-white head quickly fills the glass and holds exceptionally well leaving stubborn barnacles of foamy lace. Some moderate Styrian aroma, and a solid skunky/spicy Saaz bouquet. Some soft wheat and mild medicinal aromas are also evident, with lambic yeast notes and faint pilsener malt in the background. Timid pale malt sweetness and sharp pilsener upfront, followed by zesty Styrian and Saaz flavor, perhaps a little light-struck. Then comes a tame but prominent farmhouse profile. Dry aftertaste with lingering skunk and noble bitterness while the farmhouse character remains apparent, but not overwhelming. Nearly perfect execution of the style. High carbonaion and ultra-thin body, almost champagne-like but with some wheat-like texture. Overall the mouthfeel is refreshing and light with a pleasenty acidic yeast character and spicy german hop backdrop. Finishes dry and funky but restrained enough to quench the thirst as well as supply ample sour flavor."
"D: An unbelievably satisfying and refreshing Saison. I could drink this beer forever. It posesses such excuisitly nuanced balance. Tart, sweet, funky, malty, spicy, and hoppy. Benchmark of the style IMO."
"Available in Vancouver in the big bottles ( better to cellar than the small versions) , this is a spicy take on the Saison. Lots of head tops a light gold body. The nose is all yeasty with citrus notes and the first sip is very assertive( You need to let the beer settle to really get the nuances of the finish). I like this version as it has body and finesse in one package and really shows well as a counterpoint to the malty, heavy dark beers."
"I've edited my review for this outstanding beer. This has become a true favorite and is leading the way for this particular style, to my tastes anyway. I wish it were easier to get my hands on more Saisons, but I will have to be content with the occasional expensive road trip to Atlanta to stock up. I could drink this beer every day and be quite content...For a while anyway."
"D: Nice tart thirst quenching saison. Very drinkable. Let warm for a better taste."
"A light, hoppy, spicy ale. Spicy character might get overwhelming, but the relatively light body makes it highly drinkable."
"Poured out of a 750ml corked and caged bottle. The color was slighty hazy golden orange color, beautiful rocky white head, left a lot of chunky lacing. The aroma was of spicy, pepper Beligan yeast. The taste is spicy Beligan yeast, coliander, a bit of hop bitterness in the end. It is well carbonated, creamy, finishes a bit dry. This is the only offering that I have had of this style but I do enjoy it. It is quite drinkable as I had a few of them at Roy's in NYC."
"Sourness is the order of the day here, as that funky yeast comes into play right off the bat. That is followed by coriander seed, pepper and orange, lemon peel bitterness rounds things off. Very simple, but pleasant to be sure. Mouthfeel is quite thin-bodied and wet, and there's little here that could be called bitterness, just mildly sour. Carbonation is mellow. All in all a simple and quaffable brew, it slides down super easily. A very enjoyable Saison."
"This brew pours a glowing golden-orange color. The head is a billowy four inches in height. It never fully recedes, and thick chunks of lacing stick to all sides of the glass. The aroma is of yeast, lemon, and citrus. The taste is very earthy, with citrus and lemons in the background. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with high carbonation. Overall, this is a very solid saison, and I will certainly have it again."
"Overall: One of the best examples of the style. On par with Hennepin, but different in ways. If you like the style you'll love this one."
"Very drinkable, considering the tastiness and easy abv%."
"Probably the most drinkable saison I've had with the exception of hennepin, nice, crisp, complex, and flavorful."
"I paired this with a Thanksgiving feast and have no regrets. Probably very versatile for pairing, and I was glad to have this as my introduction to the style."
"Drinkability is pretty good. Flavor content is nice and this could be a nice session beer if it weren't for the overpowering oak flavors. Much better when served on tap."
"Drinkability: Only adequate flavor, and fairly filling. Successfully hides the 6.5% ABV. Just lacking that ""craveability"" that is so elusive to describe."
"I really liked this one. It's nice and crisp and would go well with any everyday cuisine (or just on its own, like I had it). Highly recommended, be sure to give this one a try."
"The first thing I noticed was that this has a very dry finish, almost no aftertaste present. Lots of fruit and hops present in the front. Slight medicinal, though not unpleasant, coating leads to a medium mouthfeel. Lots of pepper and spiciness throughout, which is welcomed. This paired very nicely with an artichoke/prosciutto risotto. I'd recommend this to any saison fan."
"Saison Dupont is one of the world's best-known and most-loved Belgian farmhouse ales. As far as I'm concerned, after draining this bottle in record time and loving every single drop, it deserves whatever accolades it has earned over the years. And then some."
"Great beer for anyone, although I would still opt for Hennepin in this style category."
"Overall, an excellent beer and the best example of the style I have had, barely edging out Hennepin. A superb choice for a dinner companion, especially with Thai food."
"Overall a very good beer."
"I thought this would be good with grilled pork chops or a white meat hero."
"DA: Feels good, looks good, easy to drink and very tastey, easily one of my favorite brews for this style."
"Recommended."
"I am new to Belgians, especially Farmhouses. I like the style so far, and I will be seeking other Farmhouses/Saisons for future endeavors. A very enjoyable ale."
"It pours a hazy straw with a super foamy, white head. The smell of a saison can be noted from across the room, and Dupont is no exception. Crisp, sharp, acidic, fruity, wild yeasty smell. The taste is all that, but smooth. It tastes well aged and well rounded. A sweet beginning, with all the fruity yeast undertones you hope for in a Belgian. But then the acidic bite comes. But not too powerfully. It's still nice and drinkable. Nothing for anyone to be afraid of."
"Cloudy body with no traces of yeast in the bottom of the bottle."
"The label claims this beer style was crafted to be a refreshing summertime drink. Given the flavor profile I believe it. Im certain it would make a delightful summertime diversion."
"Some words of caution: when this beer is bottled in green glass, it MUST be kept in good conditions to avoid seriously nasty skunking. Fortunately, my most recent pour was on-tap, so it was in pristine condition. A few months ago, my wife and I split a bottle (or tried to...) of a Saison Dupont that was skunky to the point of undrinkability. Even at La Caves Dupont, the small pub directly across the street from the brewery, the saison began to get a skunky smell as it warmed in the sunshine while we enjoyed some on their back lawn. So beware and use extra care on this rather delicate beer! Enjoy!"
"A great farmhouse ale. I am really loving the apple and bear flavor with a nice clove accent on it. The malt character works to balance this well. Definitely a high-quality saison here. A must have."
"A really tasty beer. Appearance is a hazy straw color that pours a real nice head. Head sticks around as well. Smell is really different. Yeasty and sort of musty. Taste is the same. Very unique, refreshing and really difficult to put a finger on. Mouthfeel is rich and carbonated. Drinkability is very good. The alcohol is low and the flavors are so unique that you keep going back for more. I would highly recommend this. They also make an organic version that is good."
"I discovered this light-bodied, nicely carbonated brew toward the end of our (too short) summer, and I'm looking forward to sipping it on a few hot days next year."
"Pours slightly cloudy yellow with a great frothy white head. The smell is citrusy with a musty sweetness. The taste was a little off balance. I would say this is a bit on the hoppy side for a saison, and the yeasty, basement-like flavors were a bit overpowering as well. I got hints of other complexities, perhaps some bitter apples and sour oranges, but the hop/yeast flavors pushed them aside. Mouthfeel was light with champagn bubbles. Overall, not my favorite, but a fair example of the style."
"Pours a hazy golden, cloudy with sediment, with a fluffy yellowish head that laces well. Smells somewhat musty, with some sourness and spiciness. Taste was much hoppier than expected, with lots of grapefruit and orange peel. Mouthfeel was quite dry, refreshing, with a barely noticeable high ABV. This is definitely a summer beer as any Saison should be."
"This pours a hazy, almost opaque yellow color, with a 1/2 inch white head and substantial lacing on the glass. The smell is tart and lemony. The taste has a smooth yeasty component, as well as a lemony flavor with a hint of green apple tartness and a nice hop bite at the end. The flavors blend effortlessly. The mouthfeel is appropriately light. This beer is very easy to drink, especially in hot weather. A classic example of the style."
"Very enjoyable beer. Very drinkable and interesting. I am becoming a big fan of saisons."
"This beer reminded me an awful lot of Duvel, but niot quite as good. Poured to a highly carbonated golden yellow, with thick pilowy white head that lasted the entire beer, and left excellent lacing. Aroma was floral with hints of grass and citrus. Flavor was a very good hodge-podge of many flavors..floral, grassy, some fruit, hint of spice and yeast. Left a very good, smooth finish. Not necessarily my favorite style, but this was a damn good beer."
"offering which could go with many food combinations."
"This isn't the first saison I've had, and not my favorite, but I am more than willing to give a hearty nod to one of the paradigms of its style. The crisp, dry refreshing nature is very notable, but for some reason what appears a reasonable ABV seems to pack more of a wallop than I expected. Perhaps because it goes down as smoothly as it does, but still, that's a warrantable quality. The bottom line here is, sometimes tradition is all that, and this beer is one of those times."
"Good mouthfeel. Right carbonation. Very drinkable, a true sipper."
"This was my second saison, first foreign, and I must say that I am a fan of the style. Pours very similar to a wheat beer with a lot of head, had to be careful of the sediment at the bottom of the bottle. The smell was that of fruit and yeast, although whereas a wheat has a very distinct banana or citrus aroma, this was notably grape-like. The taste had little to no malt characteristics to it, and there was an unusual strong (but not overwhelming) level of carbonation. The taste was tart, not bitter, almost champagne-like."
"Golden color with a huge creamy white head. The head just won't give up, it sticks around forever. When it finally does fall a little it leaves mountains and craters of sticky foam behind. For a pale beer, this looks incredibly appealing. Smell is peppery yeast. Taste like the smell with a pepper bite up front. There is some bready malt taste but no sweetness at all. Very dry and smokey. Finishes with a spicey aftertaste and some bitterness. There is just a touch of fruityness between the intitial pepper and the finishing dryness. This one is proof that a light colored beer dosn't have to lack taste. This one is full of complexity and enjoyable to drink. Thanks to maltygoodness for throwing this one in a trade."
"D: tasty"
"Maybe the epidome of the style. A terrific beer--hands down. From the onset of a magical deep yellow glow with stark-white head retention, incredible rocky head retention, sprikled with peppery spices, and continuous lacing. Sweet and tart aromas with soft pilsner malts, yeast, bread, fruits, and hop spiciness. Tastes richly of sweet bready / fruity malts that bring out pears, berries, apples, and appricots. Spicy with peppery hops, bitterness, alcohol, and tartness. Smooth and light on the palate with a soft dry finish. Very clean with slight tart aftertaste. Mildly acidic and vineous throughout. One of the best beers out there."
"$6 a glass"
"Drinkability: Very tasty and refreshing. Definatly worth a try. Super drinkable and thirst quenching. Light , but with loads of unique , delicate qualities."
"The beer pours a hazy fizzy yellow body with a white head that stood up with Belgian style lacing. The beer had a lovely yeasty aroma that was paired up with spicey notes that followed closely. The taste was largely of yeast and spices, but it also had hints of malts and a low balancing hops oil was presence. The medium-thin body had lively carbonated feel on the tounge and a refreshing crisp dry finish. This beer went down way too easily and left me wanting more of this style."
"A tasty and easy to drink beer. Not one that breaks into my favorites, but not something I'd turn down if offered."
"Gold color  white thin head  harsh sour green apple, ginger - sour green apples, yeast dry chalk  light body  aftertaste slightly bitter, dry Gold color  white thin head  harsh sour green apple, ginger - sour green apples, yeast dry chalk  light body  aftertaste slightly bitter, dry"
"One of my favorite Belgian beers out there. Never too thick or sweet, and very enjoyable. Pairs great with food; I ate mine with Thai food and it was the perfect match. I like this beer served right at cellar temp. Cheers!"
"Overall: My second exposure to the Saison style, I was hugely impressed. Comparable to a great tripel or white ale. Highly recommended."
"D- Dryness and bitterness affects drinkability. Had other saisons before, most not so bitter, had 2 bottles of dupont so far, still not really impressed"
"I quite like this beer and it makes me much more interested in trying other Saisons."
"Overall, a crisp and flavorful beer that can easily be substituted for a dry, white wine."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a slightly hazy yellow straw color; gets hazier when trugs are poured. A dense white rocky head is poured with excellent tracing. Aromas are packed with a little skunkiness (damn those green bottles), tons of esters, saaz hops. Flavors are of cardamom, anise, buttery diacetyl, and little hop bitterness. Finishes quite dry with lots of carbonation giving a good bite. This beer paired well with our salad, and would work great as an apperitif substituting for champagne. I wish I could get ahold of a fresher bottle that was stored better, but this beer represents a style that is perfect for the summer and an all around food pairing beverage."
"After reading other reviews, I would agree that you can probably come up with a whole host of subtle flavors if you put your mind to it, but this bottle just didn't do it for me."
"CRUX: WORLD CLASS. Awsome. Extremely well crafted. Recommended!"
"This ones definitely a thinking beer. Theres a whole lot going on here, so take your time for sure."
"Opened a 750ml bottle. The beer was a golden-orange color, with a slight haze from yeast. Head was white and huge. Lots of streaming bubbles. Aroma was yeast, lemon, and some type of spice. Taste was wonderful, tart with hint of peppermint, some very slight malt sweetness, and finally a finish of hop bitterness at the end. It was a very light body, slight alcohol warmth, refreshingly acidic and highly carbonated. I thought it was fantastic, and I would be happy to drink it anytime."
"Excellent beer. Easy drinker. I will definitely be having this beer many, many more times."
"Overall a really good beer. This is the only real Saison I have tried (I have also had Avery 12 ) but I would like to try others to see how this compares."
"I thought maybe the beer had gone bad, but I talked to the bartender and he said that while some people enjoy it, the overwhelming majority say something to the effect of it tasting like a wet sock. Maybe the whole case went bad...? I feel bad giving a beer that was actually trying to be good such a low rating, and I may try it again elsewhere just to be fair, but it won't be any time soon."
"Aroma is ripe zesty citrus, spices, yeast and earthy hops. Taste is unbelievably smooth. A lot of the zesty citrus and spices are in the taste along with a dry yeasty and somewhat bitter finish. This is an absolutely fabulous brew! It is certainly one of my all time favorites and a benchmark for the saison style."
"The appearance was an intense straw color verging on gold coupled with a fluffy lacing head. The aroma had a subdued spiciness to it with light notes of fruity ester and a tocuh of sour and olive. There is a solid background of pilsner malt in this beer to balance the fresh spicy, zesty character of the hops. Very light hints of citrus lemon are present, balanced by a peppery sharpness. The beer is deep and balanced. There is a dry, long finish. The mouthfeel was medium and appropriate. Great totality of a beer."
"... it's July 21 for them, I think."
"Drinkability: With a relatively low ABV and nice, light body, and refreshingly dry finish, this is an excellently sessionable summer beer."
"This is an excellent choice for a barbeque on a hot day."
"Wonderful aroma of spice, mustiness and some sweet fruits. Chewy-musty malts mingle with pear-apricot some berry tastes, attenuated hop citrus and spices..finish is long but dry with lots of berry tastes...all this with very little trace of sweetness, but without being sour or astringent. A well made ale. Still tops for summer sipping..."
"The beer poured a nice cloudy straw yellow with a creamy white head. The body showed very active carbonation. The aroma was mostly fruits, pear, some bannana and a general yeasty musty smell. The taste was fruity pears, oranges, with a nice crisp spicy bite. The mouthfeel was intitally creamy then the carbonation washes everything away. Overall very good, I had this as an after dinner beer but it would be better with a meal."
"Pours a hazy straw, much like the color of a lemon candy, with a gigantic, foamy head. As it recedes, it leaves raised lacing along the glass. Smells candy-sweet with some grain and coriander. Big yeast aromas along with herbal hops. Taste is of fruity esters mixed with grain, spices, and yeast. Herbal hop flavors run throughout. There is a mixture of a sour twang and muddled bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is light and bubbly, yet it has a creaminess to it. Dry. Nearly ideal. Highly drinkable, and would be perfect if this had a little more funk character."
"I might have overly vigorously poured this beer, the head reach a white height of over three inches of big bubbled, craggy goodness. Lively carbonation endlessly zinged up through the slightly cloudy, dull yellow liquid. Saison Dupont left intermittent rings of fine lacing around the glass. The beer's nose was of spices with fine touches of citrussy fruitiness. The beer's taste was light, summery, and citrussy, with hints of spices with a dry, almost crisp finish. This is a drinkable beer, that I enjoyed at a slightly cooler than cellar temperature. This is a beer for the summer months, with some nice cheese. Quite refreshing."
"Pours a hazy, golden color with an enormous, fluffy white head. Loads of explosive carbonation rising to the surface. Smell was very earthy - spicy, peppery, and somewhat fruity. Taste followed suit with mild spiciness. Clean, crisp, and dry on the palate. Very easy to drink. Refreshing."
"Without question, this beer deserves the highest scores in all categories... because improving anything here seems impossible to me. In a word, *perfect*."
"This beer pours a staw colored gold with a frothy white head and decent retention and lacing. The smell is of belgian yeast and subtle citrus and grape aromas. The flavor also takes on these characteristics with the addition of some spiciness. Very nice mouthfeel, thick enough, nice bottle conditioning. Overall a highly drinkable saison, glad to find it at the greenville, sc whole foods."
"Get this fresh if you can. It's a very good beer."
"2/3 of the way through the 75 cl bottle and I'm feeling good. Very drinkable, nice fruitiness and crisp finish."
"WOOO! That's an aggressive peppery taste. This one is all in your face. There's a sweet fruity taste to it (perhaps peach or cantalope). Nice yeast flavor and a very dry finish. Lots of carbonation gives this beer a very solid feel and a crisp finish."
"The beer pours a golden color with a massive head indicating a good bit of carbonation. The smell of citrisy orange and lemons and a Belgian yeastiness showing many ripe fruits. Taste is good. It reminds me Duvel, but it has an ""unfinished"" quality about it. Fruity sweetness, but a very distinct tart kick as well. Mouthfeel is also good.. Lots of bubbles, but at the same time very smooth. Drinkability is average."
"D: I actually wasn't a fan of this beer in the bottle. The tap was a different story."
"spritzy, light mouthfeel; slightly dry. taste is the same as the aroma, with notes of barniness and a nice light spiciness. overall it's subtle, slightly watery, a touch bland, but very drinkable."
"Pours a light golden yellow with a finger of snow-white cream in my chalice. Nose is all clove and spice with some citric astringency and a faint skunk. Taste is dominated by the clove as well with a hearty dose of yeast and citrus and banana taking a supporting role. Mouthfeel is airy and tongue-tickling. A nice, refreshing saison, went well with a garlic cream and chicken pizza. Not mind-blowing, but well-executed."
"D: I liked this one, good to share bottle with somebody cause I dont think I could do one alone. Thanks to gclarkage for this bottle."
"Very drinkable, low alcohol content for a Belgian ale. A wonderful summer ale."
"Incredibly solid beer. Only the second I've had in the style, and to be honest it reminds me alot of a Belgian Golden Pale Ale, similar in many ways to Duvel, but with the complexity of a Tripel."
"D = Not impressed. Wouldn't be going back to it in a hurry."
"Drinkability - this goes down easy. It's good, but I would tire of this after one 750 ml., and I would not have more than one of these in a session, although I will occaisionally have one from time to time."
"Not every beer is for everyone."
"D - Goes down very easily."
"Poured a hazy golden with a HUGE white foamy head, and left excellent lacing. Also, excellent retention. Aroma was less pronounced than I expected, but hints of citrus, alchol and wheat. The taste was much of the same, with spices, vanilla, sweet malts and mild hops. This is a very complex beer but once again not as in-your-face as I had thought it would be after all the great things I had heard. It finished slightly dry after a semi-sweet start, and was quite drinkable. Overall very good."
"The aroma was complex with lots of pepper and spice mixed in with some citrus. It carries over to the flavor which is fruity, spicey, and herby and it all culminates in a dry finish with a hop bite. Very drinkable and refreshing. It was an excellent pairing for a turkey & ham on whole wheat sandwich that I made for lunch."
"D - This beer is supremely drinkable. Everything is so well blended; so well crafted. A sublime saison that is pretty much the standard for most others to model."
"This was my first saison ever, so I don't really have much to compare it to, but damn, this was a good beer. It had a thick, cloudy, but golden appearance with a bubbly film for a head. It had the syrupy scent of a Belgian beer, but it was suprisingly crisp and refreshing. A very wheat like taste, I thought of spring. The hops are toned down, but that is what you would expect from a spring beer. Still a bit heavy, so you wouldn't want to drink it all night but, this beer is perfect for a sunny day before the heat of summer kicks in (probably even after that though)"
"Pours a pale yellow color, almost like a macro, but is unfiltered and has an awesome creamy head that lasts throughout. Herbal scents, citrus, and spice making up aroma. Has a graininess and yeasty type flavors initially, with more subtleties similar to the aroma finishing off the taste, really put together well. Almost medium bodied, with lighter carbonation than expected. Really enjoyable beer, good for many occasions I'm sure."
"Chicago, 4-22-06, 9:25pm, Huge white head, thick yet spotty and clumpy lacing. Very slight citrus note, grassy flavors. A good froth hints at some orange flavors only. This Saison was bolder than I expected and loved it. Hops are dominant throughout the beginning, middle and finish. Slightly dry with a good bitterness lingering til the end. Very drinkable. I asked for this from the menu, said they were out. Then the server came back with the LAST one. So, Cheers to Bronwyn!"
"Poured into a wide mouth goblet from the 2005 750 ml green bottle. Presents itself as a light, golden straw color with a stark white head that is nothing short of monumental. Lacing is voracious. Nose is an excellent blend of Belgian yeast, citrus, spice and hops. Palate is intriguingly complex; a medley of spiciness (black pepper, coriander, and cloves ...) hoppiness, and a slightly sweet, sugary sublety. Citrus elements are abundant as well - lemon zest and orange peel. Mothfeel is light and alive. Good carbonation and a slight ""burn"" that is refreshing. This saison has complexity and class in every way! Finishes dry and a little hoppy. Very drinkable. I love Saisons, and this one is the gold standard, I believe. Try this one on your ""macro-drinking"" friends, especially those who like something like a Heineken ... the strong hop presence, without the skunkiness, will go over well ... one of my favorite ""stand by"" beers, this one. Excellent."
"Drinkability is high ,a very refreshing beer"
"This is poured into a tulip glass. A large tiny bubbled lacey foam head that seems thick. The color is a nice golden hue. The aromas a of grassy fields. The taste is slight honey sweet that finishes with a bit of spicy hops. The aftertaste is dry. There is a coating of the mouth. The drinkability is great and I finished the 750ml bottle all in a matter of 2 hrs."
"Saisons are a good Belgian style. They were the first Belgian I ever tried, and this doesn't dissappoint after warming properly."
"Drinkability - if I was in the mood for a saison, I would buy this again, a rarity for me regarding this style in general."
"-SS"
"Tastes bitter, buttery, sour, citrusy, finshes bitter and sweet. the malt and yeast is very present"
"This is an incredible beer. I can imagine that this beer would be great with many, many different foods, and it's absolutely interesting enough on its own. I consider this a must-have. *drool*"
"Extremely drinkable and refreshing... Probably my favourite Saison that I've had the chance to sample."
"Golden apricot, sparkly haze. Puffy froth of micro-bubble light golden cream head. Beautiful. Barnyard citrus Orval honey wheat malt. Cobweb spritzy yeast and floral bitter notes on the nose. Soft wheat malt twang. Sorbet (lightly sweet). Orange. big floral hop bitterness. Yeasty and yummy. Soft, full-bodied with a nice luxurious, mouth-filling feel. Decidedly drinkable and great with so many foods I don't know what to say."
"This beer pours a yellow color with a decent head from a 375ml corked and caged brown bottle. Smells like a Belgian beer alright. Taste is fairly light, the mouthfeel is like fairly highly carbonated seltzer, and had I not known this was beer I think I could mistake it for a fairly funky tasting seltzer water. That being said, I think this is very drinkable and definitely an interesting style that I am not very familiar with. Definitely should try this one, recommended."
"D - Cannot say I would try this beer again."
"Herbs feature on the nose of this unabashedly frothy brew. I also do believe I get aroma and taste notes reminiscent of marijuana, in addition to a general herbal flavor profile. Delicate spice enters the picture, then a sturdy bitterness rides through the finish. This world classic does not fail to impress, and it is living liquid proof that the Belgian farmhouse tradition is more than just intangible romanticism."
"Anyway, this is great. I can see myself buying it many more times!"
"Drinkability: One of the beers to be savoured, not swilled. True to its form, it is what it is. A beer drinker would fall in love with this before the second glass, and wouldn't need a third...but would certainly want it."
"I only got one of these but I will remember. I need to get some more of these beauty."
"Mouthfeel was crsip and refreshing. Light bodied beer. Carbonation is clean and adds a bit to the overall likeabitlity of the beer. However, I dont like the taste or smell. Smells like a corn concocted macro lager. Possibly a bad batch so I will buy one more and give it another chance. But this one is not good. Will have trouble finishing but will definitely do so."
"Nice drinking saison. I'll suck down this 750 without a second thought..."
"This is a great beer. Recommended."
"Pours leaving a massive two inch white foam head, the color is bright yellow, a bit cloudy, and with a ton of carbonation. Nice head retention. The smell is of sour lemon and other citrus fruit, spicy and malty. The initial flavor is of more citrus, mostly lemon, a bit wheaty and not real sweet. It has a nice tartiness. The finish is fairly dry and also sour. Mildly bitter. Alcohol at 6.5% isn't too obvious. The mouthfeel is great, not too thin, very fizzy, very smooth. I found it quite drinkable, although the malt sweetness was very low. Just a hint more would have made it even better. Still a good Saison..."
"Drinkability: Hell yes. Highly drinkable, extremely complex, with a great combination of sweetness and dryness. It's a bit expensive, and I'm drinking this by itself. However, I imagine with certain meals this would do nothing but enhance the flavors of the food and also the brew. And if you don't want the 750 ml bottle you could always try the smaller one like I did."
"Drinkability is very good on this great beer."
"This is pleasantly drinkable brew. I would definitely have another."
"Drinkability: Went down way too easy for 6.5%. Not the first time I've had it, but every time I do I know why they say this is a classic of the style. Excellent beer."
"On tap at Brouwer's cafe in Seattle. Fills the proper glassware with a somewhat thick marigold yellow that can't be seen through and a nice white head. Nose is fruity and intense, you can smell this beer from quite a distance, fruity aroma...also some herbal notes...some green tea-like notes were detected somewhere in the profile. Taste was big and medicinal but not off-putting at all, the yeast is very present but in a slightly different character....somewhat heavy and definitely rustic. This is my first saison and i really enjoyed it, I love trying all these new somewhat obscure beer styles and realizing how damn good beer can be."
"Poured from a .375 ml champagne split bottle, cloudy, hazy yellow color in my glass with a thick foamy head, smells of citrus, slight astringance, a sour odor,mmm i cant wait to taste. Wow, this is some good stuff, a lightly sweet and wonderfully sour flavor, this beer is not afraid to be what it is. I love the farmhouse ale style and Saison Dupont is at the top of my list. A wonderfully refreshing beer, the .375 ml is not quite enough of this stuff for me, but i wouldnt drink it all night. A crusty baguette, and some ripe cheeses, sitting under an awning at a nice cafe sipping on some Saison Dupont, now thats a heavanly scenario!!"
"D - It is pretty drinkable all around, More of champagne substitute than a table beer I suppose. A little too strong to session, but it could be done."
"Overall: Fantastic beer. Would drink one, but only one, at a session. Went well with grilled steak tips, green beans and yellow rice."
"This is an excellent, flavorful beer that's actually refreshing. I could down a twelve pack of this in the summer. Take a couple of bottles with me while I hiking, that sort of thing. Excellent."
"Light golden foggy straw colored brew with a thick and creamy head sticking to my chalice. Smells of dry spicy hops with earhty grassy tones. Flavor has a very slightly sweet tone then dominated byt the same herbal, grassy, earthy tones from the nose with more hints of spice. Not overly dry, but almost nowhere near sweet overall. Light and frothy, Blegian-style. Drinkable, and not too high ABV, I'll pick this up again!"
"This pours with a tremendous head, so watch out.The color is a yellow straw with tons of carbonation.The smell is very spice filled,with citrus and coriander.The taste,like the smell,is very much spice filled with an aftertaste of sweet malt.A good balanced and light m/f make this a really good beer.This is one beer that I will try again,although I would have rated this higher,but I'm not a big saison fan."
"Saison Dupont is golden with good carbonation. Head is large and fluffy. The aroma is of a sweet malt and tangy spice. The taste is of sweet, grainy malt meets citrus and spices. Orange peel flavor is obvious, but I'm not quite sure what contributes the spiciness. A little earthy flavor is also in the mix. Finish is somewhat tart and thirst quinching. Saison Dupont is a great beer all-around, highly recommended."
"taste is very rind like, dry and pithy with a little sour grapefruit. nice body, not heavy carbonation cuts through it and any remaining sugar in this beer makes it unnoticeable, very refreshing. does have a nice slightly sweet fruit taste in the finish...very very drinkable!"
"Served on tap in a flute, pours a light golden color, slightly hazy, a finger of off white head decent retention and very good lacing. Nose is very yeasty, slightly tart, with green apple and citrus Taste is a nice light malt with some slightly tart fruit notes, a bit of yeast, and a slightly spicey finish. Very smooth and refreshing, this has a nice high carbonation and a crisp dry finish. Nice beer to have on tap, a very sessionable and tasty beer."
"This is probably better for the masses on tap, since it loses some of its zing. Very smooth light bodied brew. The pepper, coriander and citrus flavors are here, they are just sharing space in your mouth. Very tart and dry, but extremely drinkable."
"Poured to a light amber with a quick forming head leaving slight lacing. Sediment is present, however suspended. Smell is dry, with traces of coriander. Taste is good, dry and clean, with traces of coriander and citrus, quite bold. Mouthfeel is smooth, slight carbonation, not overly bitter. Quite drinkable, would get again if they didn't discontinue this at the LCBO. Have one more bottle that I'll be sure to hold onto for a while."
"Drinkability  Supreme. Where did that bottle go?"
"This is a very fine beer, and is everything a saison should be. Hugely flavorful, but so indescribably drinkable at the same time."
"Probably a the classic saison. I would have it again, and reccomend it to others. For my money though, I'll probably stick to Hennepin more often."
"The Saison Dupont was a small splurge on my part when I picked it up after work last night, It came in a 750 ml bottle that was corked. The cork was removed with great ease (bouncing off the ceiling..) and upon pouring the bee into a glass, I discovered a beautiful unfiltered yellow amber ale with a very light head of foam. The aroma was a menagery of botanicals and hops with hints of citrus. Overall the taste was a little on the dry side but I found this beer to be an absolute treat. I think would love to drink one of these chilled on a hot summer day."
"Thick in the mouth yet foamy as well. Light flavors make this easily quaffable yet the mouthfeel and body make this more of a sipper. Very well done. New flavors were coming with each sip. Definitely one of the benchmarks for Saisons."
"Quite pleasant in the mouth. Rather creamy and slightly dry. This reminded me of other Belgian ales I've drunk, but ""friendlier."" The lower alcohol content and softer taste makes it very versatile with food and quite drinkable. I would defnitely have this again [if I hadn't just drunk my two bottles from my last trip to the mainland!]."
"Notes: It's a decent offering. Not one I'll seek out. Price per quality ratio is lacking."
"I prefer saisons with at least a hint of sourness, and this had none. But of course it was still a pleasure to drink last brew day."
"The mouthfeel is almost bitingly carbonated but underneath is a dry, addictively smooth pucker of lemon and lime. Damned drinkable...hope I can find this again sometime."
"Highly recommended."
"The taste is to the grains,bready, and constant, but not overpowering."
"Id love this farmhouse ale on appearances alone! On popping the champagne cork you get a blast of earthy, hoppy, spicy aromas. It pours our with a beautiful head that looks like meringue. This thick white cloud lasts through the entire drink. The aromas and tastes remind me of black pepper and a fresh plowed field. The color is a deep yellow/orange and has bits of yeast suspended throughout. The flavor starts sweet from the malt and then finishes dry from the hops. It is both refreshing and complex. I call this my picnic beer. It compliments almost any dish of food. I did have one once with a tomato soup that didnt really do anything for me but have it with a ham and strong swiss cheese sandwich! I consider myself a Scottish Ale man but if pressed, I might say that this is the beer Id pick if I could only have one for the rest of my beer drinking days."
" Mouthfeel is medium, but more coating than I am used to for the style. I would drink this all day in the blistering sun. I just wish this were cheaper."
"D- This beer is a smooth light beer with good complexity. It feels like the same malt bill as American light lagers but with a yeast that adds so much complexity that has a wonderful taste."
"2003 vintage, and my first ever saison. Very carbonated, pours light gold and cloudy. Subtle aromas of yeast, herbs, vanilla, licorice, and toasted marshmallow. An interesting combination of bitter and sour flavors. Clean finishing and dangerously drinkable. The light mouthfeel was quite appropriate to the style. I was impressed."
"Poured from a 375ml bottle into a Hapkin glass. Needed all that extra room because it produced a vigorous head. My first thought when I smelled it was, ""Wow this is skunked"". But maybe that is how it supposed to smell. Another Saison I had smelled the same. Ended up tasting pretty great. Fruity sweetness mixed with corriander and a lingering bitterness. The most enjoyable of the few saisons I've had. Would go great with any dinner that calls for white wine. Definately worth picking up."
"Drinkability  Exceptional with a appetizers or even heavier foods. I would submit this is a fine picnic wine."
"D: While it hides the alcohol well, there's a bit of a bite, and I don't find it all that pleasant."
"yet a revist is schedualed."
"This beer pours a cloudy golden yellow, with a very thick, fluffly white head. The head fades very slowly leaving very thick laces. This beer has a slightly clove like aroma. I detect bananas, and a citrus aroma also. I also smell some lemon. It has a slightly hoppy aroma also. The alcohol is not apparent in the aroma. This beer has a stromg lemon taste to it. It has hints of pepper to it also. I can taste bananas also. The clove flavor is hidden, but if you look for it, you will notice it. This beer finishes dry. I think this beer tastes great. It is crisp and refreshing. It is light bodied and it goes down very smoothly. This beer is carbonated to perfection. It leaves a citrusy aftertaste. I think this beer is very drinkable. I could probably drink about a gallon of this beer by my self. If you ever see this beer, you need to get it. I will definately buy this beer again."
"My very first Saison. Poured out to a highly carbonated slightly hazy golden color. Major white foamy head would not stay down. Aromas of dough and grain are noted. Taste is uniquely dry and mellow; reminded me of some dry champagnes i've had in the past. Flavors of yeast, grain, burned malts, and some weak malt. Tart finish with some fruity flavors. Definitly different. Unlike anything I would call a belgian pale ale, as many have described this brew. Good mouthfeel is enhanced by the high level of carbonation. This is not an everyday brew; more or less a now and then treat. Mediocre drinkability. I will try some other beers of this style, and see how they compare. Worth a try."
"this is not my style. I give it credit for quality and craftsmanship and being an interesting beer."
"Nose is very spicy, hoppy, litle aour and alcoholic and good yeastfruit remembering of pears. lots of wheatmalt are well detectable and overal just marvelous. As is taste that's dry, grassy, alcoholic and bitter. Pepper and other spices again well dosed and hard to say witch one's have been used, great dosation altogether. Perfect carbonisation that's high makes it to a perfect mouthfeel and yes this is one of the finest saisonbeers I've tasted so far. Very good drinkable and IMO a must have tried if your into belgium beers."
"750ml bottle, cork sez 2005. Pours a cloudy yellow with tons of foam, which lasts a very long time. Scents of fruits, reminds me of a hefe. Very nice taste with a light body, finishes clean and dry. This would make a very nice session beer, but the price is pretty steep. Really like this one, did not disappoint."
"Very pleasant, drinkable beer but hardly the best I've ever tasted."
"I have been told that this ids the standard of the style, but it seems more like a starting point. Something is missing. It is good, but could be taken is so many more interesting directions. Tastes too much (as is) like a stale Belgian pale ale."
"Opinion: This is an amazing beer! It has a whole lot of backbone and flavor while being light enough to be consumed as a session beer. The flavor changes enough while you are drinking it, that if you don't like it...just wait a minute...it will change. This is a great beer, and I would highly recommend it!"
"One of my local bars serves this by the 374 ml bottle for nine bucks. This makes me love the beer. The beer pours with a medium to large head. Although thick, the head does not last as long as you would think. The color is a cloudy and pale tan. The taste is richhints of nut, not bitter but not smooth. If you let it sit in your mouth it will feel lighter as it warms. Overall, Saison Dupont is a fine beer to sip or drink."
"6.5% with a nice light body makes this a great session beer."
"Drinkability is good nice enough enjoyable just not funky enough. Thanks go to movingshadow152 for this bottle."
"cheers..."
"Indeed very drinkable and enjoyable. I've only had two saisons from the bottle, this and Ommegang's offering. I much prefer this from bottle compared to Hennepin (although I thought that beer to be quite excellent on tap). Indeed this appears to me to be the perfect summer sipper. Not a beer to slam down after mowing the lawn in the summer, but rather one to sip and enjoy its complexities on a hot summer night."
"The mouthfeel is creamy with velvety carbonation bubbles. This is the ultimate summer beer. Better than any hefe or wit IMO. It goes great with Jerk Chicken wings too!"
"Drinkability- My number #2 saison behind Fantome. Very easy drinking brew that I will try to keep on hand."
"Believe this. This may not be the best thing I ever had, but its damn close. I guess you would have to be a Hip-hop star to afford to keep bottles of this in your cooler, but if anyone who can afford it is listening, this is the tremendously complex and drinkable pay-off to all your hard work."
"Very disappointed in this saison. It's my new favorite style and I was expecting all sorts of the usual spices and sugars. Instead, I got lots of hops and bitters. Pours like a typical saison--yellow gold. Big foamy head. Spotty lace. Aroma is a bit hoppy. Blegian sugars come through as the initial flavor, but are quickly replaced with a surprising amount of hops. I can barely find any yeasty fruits, flavors or spices. While refreshingly crisp, it does not drink as smooth as I was expecting. It came across as much more like a bitter than a Belgian farm style ale. Mouth feel is crisp with a full body and malt heaviness that sits on the mouth."
"Conclusion: A tasty brew and one of the better saisons I've had thus far. It's certainly a lot better than it's bio counterpart, although I'm not quite sure if it really lives up to the hype."
"Taste: Good carbonation and grainy, wheaty mouthfeel, the aftertaste is very yeasty, like dipping a freshly baked baguette in a little white wine and a zest of orange."
"750 ml bottle. This beer pours out hazy yellow with a huge, chunky head. Musty yeast smell with hops and zesty citrus. Somewhat tart fruit flavors, mostly apple and lemon. Peppery spiciness. Lots of flavor from the yeast. Bitter finish. High level of carbonation. This beer is supremely drinkable. It's no problem for one person to drink an entire 750 ml bottle. Everyone should try this beer at least once. It's a great introduction to saisons."
"Very, very drinkable. Especially since its NYC and 97 degrees today. Thank you sir, may I have another?"
"A really tasty beer, so much flavour"
"Super drinkable, too bad it is expensive and hard to find around here; guess I will have to make do with Hennepin. Absolutely recommended."
"Drinkability: Very good. Light and flavorful. Non-intrusive"
"Mouthfeel is good for the style. Sessionable, and I can see why it's recommended as a dinner beer."
"Poured into my chalice a slightly hazy orange/gold with a mammouth white head that stuck like glue as to the sides of the glass as it took its times settling.Wow the tons of stuff going on aroma wise some definent barnyard funck hits right after popping the cork along with some lemon rind and even a light phenolic smokiness in there as well.Very refreshing ale to say the least here,hints of lemon and coriander with a leafy,herbal finish.Clean and fruity and oh so damn refreshing a true classic and a summer quencher I wish I had more."
"Overall - an excellent and very refreshing beer..."
"Pours a hazy golden, huge fluffy white head and plenty of lace all around the glass. Nose is very citrusy, some buried malts, grass and earth, pleasant. Taste is very citrusy, some deep maltiness on the tongue, clean dry finish. Highly carbonated, but smooth and refreshing."
"Pours a cloudy, golden-orange. Huge off-white frothy head that holds up forever. the nose airy with yeast and an outdoorsie, grassy kick. The taste is of yeast & bread with a earthy kick to it. Quite interesting. A long bitter finish with a pinch of tartness...almost a dry woodiness. Some fruit n spice linger as well. A light bodied beer with a mostly smooth & lively mouthfeel. Nice enough to have more than one...a good thirst quencher."
"Cloudy golden honey colour with a gigantic, fluffy white head. Lots of lacing. Lemony citrus aroma, a bit earthy, light spice, floral, mild yeastiness. Fruity (apple/pear) and earthy, slightly tart, hint of malt flavour and a bit spicy. Long, dry, bitter finish with some fruit carrying through. Light body, light astringency, generous, crisp carbonation, slightly creamy and slick mouthfeel. There's a lot going on here, but it stays quite refreshing and enjoyable."
"D&N: I initially thought that the mag that ranked this beer number one was FOS, but they may not be far off the mark. Different from the stuff I've been drinking lately, pairs very well with the steaming bowl of split pea and bacon soup I'm enjoying. This is a really good beer. Best in the world? Nope. Worthy of praise? Definitely."
"This is quite good. It is recommended with all grilled foods, according the bottle. Consequently, I have many Flemmish recipes that call for Dupont as an ingredient, so I will have to do some experimenting in the future. If you can get this beer and don't mind a bit of funk, definitely go for it."
"Need a beer to clean the palate if not cut through some of the most flavorful cuisines ... this is the beer to do it."
"Would be very easy to have another, if I had more than one..."
"This is a great summer beer; it is so pleasantly funky. It is a great introduction into the world of Belgian farmhouse ales."
"cheers"
"It rests a creamy tangerine hue, boasting unfiltered cloudiness. Tenacious white head. Aroma contains lactose, some grainy malt, grass, and litte ripe fruit. Taste is full of pale malt, a little grainy in its presence. Slight cream flavor as well as some bananas, maybe apples as well. As the beer warms, an interesting sourness and fresh grass flavor become more apparent. Very brisk carbonation. In fact, the cork launched out of the bottle as soon as the cage was removed. Very interesting and drinkable."
"A bit dissapointed actually"
"Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, it just seemed like a bit of a crossover between a belgian pale and an american pale. anders, the beer was rather good, just not one I'll be asking for [that often]."
"A new and exciting style of beer for me. It pours a hazy yellow color and has a thick foamy head. It has sour yeasty aroma that good Belgian beers all have in common. It's sour, spicy and has a very dry finish. It is very complex, yet very refreshing style of beer. this is my first Saison and I am liking the style already. I don't think the Belgians are capable of brewing a bad beer."
"The drinkability of this beer was quite high. It went down easy and was very refreshing. This is something that I will defiantly be buying again as the summer heats up."
"A very nice Saison and one that may be in the cards again if I can find it and at a reasonable price."
"Pours a nice, golden hazy color with an strong head. This was a 2004 and the age was apparent right away in the aroma. Very nice, spicy nose with a combination of lemon and pepper. The taste is very refreshing and this is one of the best saisons I've had. Nice mild, spicy flavor that's very refreshing."
"Cork says 2004. Pours a light, clear, yellow orange color with a huge lasting head, white as snow. There's a good amount of peppery spice in the nose, as well as some pale malts and herbal hop presence. Taste is really sublte. I might look for a little more pizazz, but this mellow profile suits the beer well. Lots of yeasty bread tastes, as well as the previously mentioned herbal hop spicyness and pepper. A little fruity too, like apples or pears. Light but sturdy mouthfeel. Super refreshing, making for high drinkability. A great beer for the warmer months, and a classic saison."
"The perfect style to enjoy on a warm spring/summer's day."
" A true Classic and WAY underrated!"
"You should try to have a 750mL bottle of this and Hennepin on hands at all times for any BYOB you may go to."
"This saison poured a hazy, golden color with white foam that settled but left some lacing on the glass. The smell was lightly fruity with some hops (reminiscent of DeRanke XX Bitter). The taste was hoppy with a mild horseblanket Brett flavor and a slightly bitter, hoppy finish. A pleasant flavor overall. The mouthfeel was dry and crisp with medium body and good carbonation, and a mildly lingering aftertaste. This was a nice beer, but seemed quite different than the way I remember this beer from a bottle."
"Drinkability  Some Saisons can be tough to session, but this one is very smooth and went down quite well. It was one of the more drinkable examples of the style that Ive had."
"Too bad this was light struck. I'll go through a more deliberate selection for my next bottle."
"(Pairs really well with sushi, BTW.)"
"Overall: definitely a winner of a saison."
"This is a great beer. I will definatly have to have some more of it and introduce my beer buddies to this great style."
"Drinkability: Maybe because that's my first saison style beer, but I think that I didn't found all the qualities of this product yet. I didn't dislike what I drank."
"as a relative newbie to the style i can see the ""farmhouse"" elements. not sure if i would praise the smell of wet hay in my APAs. not too strong, so it's a good session beer"
"I've only had a few examples of the style, but I think I'm getting the knack of it. Pale gold pour with a big white head, nice yeasty smell with a strong sour note to it. Incredibly balanced flavor; the yeasty funk is still there like I'd expect from a saison, but the spice flavor is there. Relatively subdued, but still packs a lot of punch. The citrus lemon flavors are a really nice touch. Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing...this one is a keeper."
"Drinkability and Overall: This is a wonderful brew. I was lucky enought o enjoy many good Belgian beers tonight, and this one was one of the best. It has such a rustic feel to it that makes it wonderful. It's simple, it's solid, and it's a damn tasty beer."
"Mouthfeel moderate, as it should be for a dry style. Drinkability is lower than other scores because, to be honest, this is not a big drinking beer. I've tried a couple of times, and been glad to do so, and it is interesting, but not something I'm excited to drink frequently."
"Simply the gold standard for the Saison style."
"well, if i see this again, i will have to get it, because this must just be a bad bottle."
"Presentation: Packaged in an 11.2 ounce Euro-style longneck with a pop-top crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"A wonderfully hoppy Belgian ale with some nice complexity."
"I didn't like this beer as much as i thought i would, this is my first saison which may mean i don't like the style that much as others are saying this the standard to which others are judged. The foam is just too much. There's great foamy beers like Piraat but this is just a step over the top. The carbonation seems to domintate all aspects of the taste. It's like champange but much more intense. I poured it into a wine glass and when the glass 1/3 full of beer the rest is complete foam which holds for minutes. So it took a good 6 or 7 pours to finish the bottle. Then you burp 100 times. For that matter the smell is not very pleasant. Now that said this is a pretty tasty, good beer. The taste itself is certainly the high lite. I would try it once to see if you like it.(since many do) It's just that there many better belgians(duvel or piraat, to name two that are similar in color) out there that cost the same. (6.99)"
"One of the better beers that I have sampled in this style."
"It's hard to rate the drinkability, as I don't care for it on its own, but it make a wonderful companion to food. I'm a little disappointed that I'm not getting more out of it, aside from a strange certainty of quintessence."
"It's floral, fruity....carambola (starfruit) kiwi. Sticky, bitter....green banana. Saison grass, and dry finish. Quite wonderful and refreshing."
"Served a hazy and nearly opaque pale yellow color with a sturdy soapy white head and nearly endless lace. Smells of citrus and apples with a little bit of intermingled farmhouse funk. The flavors start with lots of citrus, but are quickly balanced by tart lemon peel and spice with a touch of yeasty funk. Finish is long and wonderfully dry. The carbonation is stupendous and helps make the beer particularly quenching; dry and light in the mouth. Excellent drinkability as well. Could easily have a few before noticing the empty glasses and headiness."
"Long, lingering bitterness and abundant nectar."
"Flavor is delicate, lemony and sweet and earthy with a long, lightly lemony bitter finish."
"When you've finished, use what's left of the head as a replacement for whipped cream on your fresh blackberries. I love it."
"The beer poured a little cloudy, in an enticing kind of way. It had that earthy, barnyard aroma that I expected, but it tasted just a bit sweeter than I remembered from the bottle. The hops were present but to the extent of the bottled version. There was a slight hint of oxidation, but overall, this is one of the best draft beers you're likely to find in this country. A definite winner, but better, I think, in the bottle."
"The cork explodes off with aggression hinting at the intense carbonation that this bad boy contained. Pours a beautiful light orange with a huge fluffy head. Intense pepper notes dominate the nose. A background aroma of wet hay slowly fades in balancing well with the pepper before a slight smell of apples develop. Taste is clean and crisp with pepper, fruit, and hay. Very quenching. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy. This is an excellent excellent beer. I will be returning."
"This was my first taste of a Saison. I prefer the strong dark ales, tripels, and quadrupels from Belgium -- but this was a nice change of pace. Fine presenation in the caged/corked bottle. Color was nothing to write home about, and nose in the bottle wasn't too groundbreaking. However, taste and mouthfeel were very good. Crisp, refreshing, and with notes of citrus. A fairly drastic departure from my Belgian favorites. Saison Dupont is good for cleansing the palette, and I'll probably buy this one again."
"Mouthfeel is thin but lively and sparkly with carbonation; drinkability is high. Probably not sweet enough for non-beer lovers but makes a very good champaigne substitute."
"A sheer pleasure to drink. My first experience and certainly not my last. Delicious in the winter and my guess is even better in the spring or summer."
"Very drinkable, I suspect it is an even better brew with food."
"Drinkable, yes."
"This is and amazingly light, pleasant, and drinkable ale for the size. If this is indicative of the style, saison may soon become one of my favorite styles."
"When pouring this Saison from Dupont, the color was of a hazy golden brown in color with a medium about of foam and nice lace on the side of the glass. The smell of citrus with spritz filled the nose. The taste was of a zesty fruit (apple) nature. The simi-dry finish with the zest give this a well balance taste on the palate!"
"This came in a 750ml bottle. Pours out a clear yellow with a lot of bubbles rushing up from the bottom of the glass. A fluffy white head erupts from the pour to peak over the top of the glass but luckily not on to the floor. The head maintained for most of the session leaving fluffy rings of lace around the glass. Aroma was filled with a doughy malt, yeast and a funkiness. There were also notes of sweet fruit and a bit of spiciness. The taste was quite malty with a spicy backdrop. Notes of biscuity malt and sweet fruit were intermingling. The taste ends on an earthy bitter dry note. Mouthfeel was light to medium with a very well carbonated feel to it. Drinkability is great it is very crisp and enjoyable with a complex flavor. This has definitely peaked my interest in the style, good stuff."
"Very nice, although I thought the Foret was a little better. This one is more delicate, and a bit more subtle. Nonetheless, this is a wonderful beer (and goes great with food). Nice foamy head, which continues to coat the beer and glass all the way to the finish. Great balance, perfect with appetizers."
"The drinkability is good maybe not a session beer but a good changeup and refresher."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a big pillowy 2"" slightly off-white head above the golden brew. Furious effervescence makes head sno-cone above the sides of the glass soon after pouring. Head lasts FOREVER, laces excellently with heavy foam, and aroma has the slight funk going on, but somewhat nondescript. Taste is of pale malt, with spices kicking it up soon after, and throughout the rest of the taste experience. Mouthfeel is extra smooth and drinkability excellent. Check it out if hops are your thing."
"Very enjoyable...justt kind of hard to describe the flavor and aroma...tfour words...musty...earthy...fruity..enjoyable.."
"Thank god the SAQ still has some bottles of this on their shelves. At $6 a magnum, it's probably the best beer deal going these days, and with the SAQ strike going on now I better enjoy this one fully... it might be awhile before I get another bottle."
"This was a pleasant beer to try, and the only one of this style I have been able to find. I was satisfied."
"Overall, this is a darn good beer, although it might be better for the warmer months. The only drawback is the price: $5 for a 12.7 oz bottle!"
"This beer presented a hazy golden color with a thick dense head fed by champagne bubbles. Frothy, snowy lace left on the glass. An aroma of malty roasted grains balanced by fruit, hints of apples. The smell of this beer reminds me of a wonderful brewing process. Medium malt character up front with a mild hop finish. A distinct sourness comes late (after a few minutes. Fresh, light mouth feel, very drinkable."
"on draft at the Ginger man, one of my all time favorites a treat on draft. Poured cloudy light orange with a well developed puffy head, dissolving slowly to a tiny bubble film . This one leaves a ton of lacing. Nose is a load of spice, pepper mostly, also yeast, musty, and earth. Medium bodied and a fair amount of prickly carbonation noted. Flavors of cracked pepper, yeast, earth. Tart in the finish, fresh and crisp. great stuff."
"As it was, it made for a good summer celebration beer, but is good for consuming anytime."
"This was a very good beer. We don't have enough opportunity to enjoy this style of beer. Saison Dupont is a great example of the style. I wish all beers were this good."
"Holy hell. This one pours a fluffy white, with just a little bit of hazy peachy-orange color underneath to show there is beer in there, not just head. Seriously, there is about 4 fingers of head, and its not going anywhere. The nose is nice and zesty lemon with a great fruity sweetness in there as well. I have to let this sit to see if I can get the head to go down, or I will have foam all up in my moustache. The flavor is really nice. There is a tartness that carries through the entire beer, but there is also a nice citrusy sweetness in there too. Very nice. The beer is moderately thick, not too heavy for the flavor. A good balance. I can see why people like this beer. Its not my favorite style, but I can only have one favorite now can't I...I could kick back with a bottle of this again, easily."
"Drinkability: Highly drinkable, great beer."
"Lovely."
"""2.003"" says the cork. On the pour, a head of pure white rushes up to fill half the goblet. Beer is the color of bronzed honey with highlights of pure gold; highly translucent and full of lilting carbonation. A swirl of the glass leaves slothful lace oozing back towards the surface of the liquid. Quite a looker, until later in the bottle... when I start getting loads of sediment, no matter how gentle the pour. Crisp, hoppy aromas of new-mown grass with grated lemon zest and pickled ginger; soft, rice wafery maltiness. Nosefeel is almost too light to be considered ""floral."" Flavors are neatly balanced, everything drenched in coolness: lemon juice wetnesses give way to an assertive, spicy body of white pepper, coriander, ginger; nectarine-pit bitterness; vigorously dry, hoppy finish. Mouthfeel is wet--wetter than water--on the tongue, but somehow finishes warm, bitter, and refreshing. Good drinkability overall, but I was beginning to feel some palate fatigue after 750ml of the stuff. Delicacy is absolutely the focus of this brew. I preferred this when I had it on tap, but this sample simply reinforced my notion that this is the archetype for the style. This paired very nicely indeed with orange-glazed salmon and asparagus frittata."
"I was a little worried about the condition of this beer when I pulled the cork. That skunk smell hit, but fortunately didn't last. While Saison Dupont did not fully meet my expectations, it is a very fine beer. I will revisit this beer in the future."
"A classic, a must try, but nothing exceptional. A lot of foam from aggressive conditioning, pouring out over table and taking several moments to calm down. Refreshing in summer, easy drink but not bold rather very grassy. Some coriander and cloves spice and apple honey. Ranked down a bit in another bottle of 10 months later, bit more barnyard did not affect it, rather found it only above average brew."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Corked date was 2003 so this was kinda young. But still tasted oh so good. Poured out a bright orange/deep gold color with a nice amount of head that lasted all the way through. Smell consisted of a variety of items. Spicies, hay-like aromas, and some fruits in the backround as well, but the fruit was quite strong. Taste was quite flavorful. Lots of citrus notes in this beer with some spiciness in the backround. Yeast and some slight hops show up at the end with a tart-like finish that lasts into the aftertaste. Quite nice. Nothing was overwhelming which was nice to see. Mouthfeel was on the border of light-medium. Perhaps I should buy a bottle and age it to see what differences will show up. Pick this up for sure."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable but extremely complex; great for warmer days when you want something thirst quenching"
"Sweet Saisons and summer make a refreshing and relaxing pair. I picked up this bottle at Trader Joe's and enjoyed the sweet golden sunset of a brew, that capped it self nicely with dissipating white head. The brew balanced sweetness with spices with a combination that was both light and bold. The pleasant dry finish helped it pair well with an unidentified soft cheese. Most excellent."
"The appearance of this beer is simply spectacular. The head is firm, thick, long-lasting, and glowing-white. It sits atop a cloudy, milky, yellow liquid. Bubble rise constantly through the liquid, and yeast float throughout. The aroma has a notable lemon and orange quality, mixed with yeast and a spiciness. The taste starts moderately sweet, with the citrus continuing. By the mid-taste, the beer dries out a little, and it finishes very clean and crisp. Its extraordinarily refreshing."
"33 cl capped bottle simply called ""Saison Dupont"" (bought in Norway), ""Vieille Provision"" is apparently used only for the corked bottle, otherwise it must be the same beer. Hazy golden beer with a large head. Lovely farmhouse aroma with spices and tobacco. Spicy and ""authentic"" farmbrew flavour, which unfortunately soon is overpowered by a strange medicinal bitterness on the the back of my tongue - Im not sure how much of this bitterness comes from the hops and how much comes from dead yeast cells. This bitterness dominates the long aftertaste"
"Glittering golden color body, incredibly active. The head is intense and lasting forever. It faded faster on the side, and started to look like the tower of a sand castle, but with a smooth whipped egg consistency. The smell is yeasty, fresh and very hoppy. Peppery and spicy too. The taste is enjoyable, dry and hoppy but still very round and yeasty with citric notes of orange peel and grapefruit. Mouthfeel is creamy and round, and the hops last on the palate. A good summer beer. Nice."
"Overall, this saison was quite drinkable, especially on a night with temps in the 80's. Saison Dupont rates the reputation it has garnered."
"Picked this up in Vancouver, my first saison sample, and highly recommended. Poured from a small brown 250 ml bottle, best before date on the back label is 04/2006. Massive chunky white head on the pour into a tulip glass, the foam rose so high above the lip of the glass that it eventually formed a saison nipple as a crown. Hazy pale golden coloured body, intense carbonation. Pepper, corainder and citrus on the nose, some sweet malt and candi sugar as well. Through the billowing foam it seems to have a cotton candy sweetness to it, it suits the texture, that's for sure. Intensely sweet flavour up front, definitely cotton candy, strawberry licorice, citrusy towards the middle, and the spices popping up near the finish: pepper, coriander, bitter orange peel. Floral sweetness on the aftertaste, some clover honey. A small sample to make a decent impression from. The mouthfeel is smooth like mylar, a frictionless plastic texture that slides through the mouth. I'd drink another of these just to get part 2 of the experience, hopefully in a larger serving. Otherwise my glass of this saison disappeared far too quickly."
"ng"
"An easy drinking enjoyable brew that would go down a smoother if there was just a little less carbonation"
"The beer pours a cloudy pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades. The aroma is great. It has a light pale malt scent with a very fruity Belgian yeast finish. The taste is good. It has a pale malt flavor with a fruity yeast finish. It goes down easy and finishes dry, yet refreshing. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium/full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a fine saison. It has a superior aroma and good taste; a good drinker."
"Poured from a 750 ml bottle with one of my favorite labels, it pours hazy gold with a touch of peach. A big, billowy white head develops immediately and diminishes but never goes away completely. The smell is classic musty barnyard with some herbs and peppery spices. Spice and herbs abound in the taste, but a bit of dry fruity sweetness becomes more apparent after it sits a while. This Saison goes down like a dream and is always worth seeking out."
"Sampled at From The Vine beer tasting Jul 9th, 2004: The beer is a cloudy gold color with a medium thick and fluffy white head. The green bottle may be to blame for the skunkyness that enveloped the sweet fruit and yeast in the aroma. Light-bodied and very carbonated, with an earthy mix of tart fruit and sweet spice flavors. However, the flavor falls off very quickly for some reason. The finish is lightly sweet and has a touch of pepper. Overall this beer is decent with only a couple shortcomings, but I think the green bottle and travel did it some harm. At any rate I thought the now-defunct Quarryman version was a lot better."
"The pale golden look with the effervescent carbonation is clearly evocative of Champagne. The crowning creamy head atop the brew is very handsome and displays incredible longevity and adorns the glass with a solid coat of lace. The aroma is floral, citric, and earthy. The taste is very delicate sweet tart rhubarb and lemon peel with horseradish spiciness on the back of the tongue. The middle is crisply hopped with a dry mouthfeel. The end is a bit tropical with hints of banana and other fruity esters. Light and tangy, with a sunny disposition. This brew will always be welcome in my glass."
"Sweetness up front, some interesting fruitiness. Loads of spicy yeast character, along with some sour barnyard funk flavours. Dry herb flavoured finish. Light-medium body, rugged carbonation. Quite refreshing & quaffable."
"Damned tasty! A great summery ale, tres sophisticated and quaffable, to boot!"
"I appreciate this more in a tulip glass and every time I drink it I have to say ""I love this beer!"" out loud. My perfect beer."
"From the tap pours a hazy orange cloudy liquid whit a wonderful thick, fluffy head. The head was present for just about the duration of this brew. There was a great amount of lace on the goblet it was served in. Smell was slightly herbal, fruity and the traditional Belgian ""yeasty"" smell. This beer was sweet in the beginning, followed by a tart fruit flavor, with a touch of spice in the end. Light body with moderate carbonation. Overall, this was refreshing, and a treat. I had debated over trying this before, but when I saw it on tap at Max's on Broadway in Baltimore, I had to do it. And I am glad I did."
"12.7 ounce bottle. Unknown dating...L031012/4 on bottle."
"Bottle: Poured a huge clear golden brew (after the cork blew out of that one) with a huge head with medium retention. Aroma is a mix of spice and malts with some citrus flavour being omnipresent. Taste is like a good Belgian ale with again the citrus flavour really coming out of that one. Carbonation is good with excellent medium body. Overall, a very good example of the saison style. The only downside is that the green bottle doesnt seem to keep the beer very well. Ive had too many bad past experience of this beer being skunked. I have another bottle of that batch that I will try to age."
"Pours a nice straw color. Has a decent, lasting head, and tons of lacing. A slight acidic smell, some spices in the nose. Tastes bright in the mouth, with a lingering tartness. I think I finally understand what people mean when they talk about the ""horse blanket"" smell of some belgian beers. I like some belgians, and hate others. This is one that I could drink for a night."
"Drinkability: Great. I wish I could buy more of these, but they're sort of pricey where I'm at. Really great though. Drink it on your porch as the summer sun sets and know true happiness."
"Beutifull beer with a huge white cap of dense white foam.Clear or cloudy depending on the pour amber body. Aroma is faint, spicy and a bit musty. Flavor is zesty with a tart acidity, spicy hops and alcohol, and a bit of fruityness that sneaks out every so often. Strong bitterness and a crisp dry finish. May not be the tastiest beer, but the complexity and depth of flavor make for a very rengaging brew."
"To say this saison is refreshing would be an understatement. Fresh Saison Dupont is fantastic... world class. Two-year-old, bottle conditioned Saison Dupont is really something else. While I didn't think this bottle would hold up extremely well, it more than exceeded my expectations."
"Pours a murky hazy yellow with dense white head and brown sediment accumilation at the bottom of my belgian glass. Had a good fruity smell, with pineapple and banana along with alcohol. Similar in taste with maybe some lemony twang to it. Some characteristics as the hefeweizens but with more citrusy alcohol notes. very flavorful and drinkable with a good buzzing alcohol kick."
"Overall its really great farmhouse ale. It reminds me a lot of de ranke XX bitter. I could drink this beer all day."
"Though I prefer Fantome by a nose, Saison duPont seems to be the more consistent product of the two. Needless to say, I'd be happy drinking either one. I'd been looking forward to trying duPont for a while, since I'd first seen it in the cooler at Burgh's, and it's certainly convinced me of the merits of farmhouse beers, which I may have passed over looking for doubles/triples/quads. A great summer beer."
"Taste is a mixture of peppery lemon and a modest malt background. Some grassy tones come through; not overly sweet or yeasty. A little sour in the finish, this is, as the bottle explains, a belgian that would work as a summer beer. Not too heavy, but still drawing much flavor yeast."
"This is a dark orangeish colour with a huge, white fluffy head of foam. Aromas are a bit funky and yeasty with a nice bready malt middle and a nice herbal/floral hop finish...The taste was fruity, with that malt in the middle and the drying hops providing a slight bitterness on the finish. The mouthfeel was fluffy and smooth and the drinkability was excellent. I quite enjoyed this one on tap...much more so than in the bottle..."
"It pours an orange-gold with a sligth haze and a creamy head. It has an earthy, citrus hop aroma. It is spicy with some orange and earthy notes. It finishes with a dry, bitterness that is slightly sour and very refreshing. One of the best Saisons available."
" This is a highly enjoyable Belgian Saison. I regret that I didn't buy as many of these as my wallet could have spared. I look forward to having some more of these farmhouse Belgian ales."
"Note: This beer pairs very well with full-flavored soft stinky cheese smeared on slices of French baguette."
"An excellent brew."
"Appearance: A clouded golden orange sunburst tone, awesome effervescent white fine bubbled head, lacing is entricate clings to my glass the whole way. Aroma: Mild hints of citrus and tropical fruit, along with a musty farmhouse funk just heavenly cloves and spices thrown into the mix. Taste: Staple of the Saison style, creamy fruit tinged edge with pale malts and a great wild flavor of spices, peppery notes, and herbal tea like finish the clovey aspect is great all in all very solid brew. Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied, tickles the senses and coats the palate with a fine slightly syrupy film. Drinkability: Effortless summer session ale complex and refreshing what more can you ask for."
"Pours out a light yellow straw with a huge bright white head. Very smooth mouthfeel as the brew goes down. Spice and yeast flavors are there. More on the tart side of sweet. Complex flavors are well balance to a nice yum. I'm wishing I bought the 750ml bottle over the 375ml bottle. Oh well, always a next time. So glad this brew is finally available in VT!"
"Hazy, peachy-honey yellow hue, sparse white head, awfully small. I assume the gasses from the bottle were released prematurely as the bartender open the 12-ounce bottle and it took the waitress a moment too long to bring me the sample. I am angered and disappointed. No lace was produced either as the beer was removed from the glass, speaking of glass it was a straight-sided pint glass! Curse the Dundee Dell! The nose is tart, earthy, peppery, grassy and very lively. The potency is respectable, welcoming for sure. The palate is everything you want in a Saison and then some. Tart and lively upfront with earthiness, fresh cut grass, hay, horse blankets, pepper, grapes, traces of white wine, pears, a hint of green apple peel, undercurrents of indescribable loveliness. The carbonation is lively enough to play up the taste and refresh at the same time. Medium in body, smaller than I expected but it has a very workable mouthfeel. Dry finish yet fruity and juicy. This is a great beverage, absolutely wonderful, it doesnt hurt I love this style of beer. If I were stuck on a desert island this would be the beer of choice. This is a must try for every serious beer drinker. Awesome."
"It is very well carbonated as the cork just explodes from the bottle with only a little prompting. This beer is a hazy orange yellow colored brew, which, is topped by a prodigious white head. The head is long lasting and turns to a cratered rocky surface over time. As I pour I get a strong light struck character in the aroma. The main aroma in the glass is of grain. The light struck character is, thankfully, quite muted in the taste. The beer has a sharp grassy-grain character to it, which is quite good and make me think of a nice hay field in Belgium. There is a slight sweetness and a balancing bitter hop finish. It is a fairly dry beer overall, and has very little fruitiness to it. The middle of this beer has a certain sharp spiciness to it. Overall, though this beer is fairly mellow, the flavors are well integrated and flow one into the other. I like this beer; a quality, good farm-house beer."
"Sunshine wheat colored beer. Thick, foamy, bright white head. The aroma was a combination of fresh hops and spring fields. The flavor contains just the right amount of citrus hops that fades into a clean and refreshing aftertaste. The body is on the light side of moderate and the beer has a good amount of carbonation. Overall a light and refreshing beer perfect for those warmer days."
"2002 addition based on the cork. Farmhouse ales are rapidly becoming my favorite style, and this particular offering did it's best to continue that trend. Nice color, not quite yellow, and not quite orange but certainly hazing with a nice topping of foam. The smell is very fresh and awakening, slightly fruity, but certainly refreshing and dominated by the yeast. The taste is a wonderful combination of the farmhouse yeast, some hops, sour fruit and tongue tickling spices. The aftertaste was very dry and long lasting. Overall a very pleasant beer, and i can't wait to enjoy during warmer weather when it was intended to be consumed."
"11.2oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a hazy yellow-orange color with two fingers of head. There is nice lacing left on the glass. The smell is full of citrus, grass, hay, and a hint of white grapes. Very Pleasant. The taste starts with just a tad of tart acidity. Bits of lemon and orange peel, not very many hops present. The aftertaste is slightly metallic. The mouthfeel is fairly smooth and thick. The drinkability is also fairly good. A unique Saison."
"Conglomerate of murky gel-like haze of light golden yellow with a tall suspended dense white head of firmly settling froth, slowly dwindles down to a thick puffy haze that remains present, lacing in inkblot sheets. Smell is subdued and mellow with light fruity citrus peels and quite floral in its sweetness with an overall dry wood character adding a nice earthyness with dried grassy and musty yeast notes. Taste is a nice meld of complexing little bits of sharp wheat tones that playfully dart around the palate leaving trails of spices, grasses, dulled citrus peels, musty yeast, wood and earthy tones that leaves a real interesting dryness thats milding smooth and long with its own complexities lending nice frothy wheat malts and some mild hop bittering tones. Nice finish, very calm, smooth, lengthy, and subtle with drying tones. Nice airy carbonation upfront that builds quickly to a nice little grab and fullness midway, and finishes dry remaining smooth and kinda tingly/spritzy the whole way through. The drinkability is nice, just a nudge of to much carbonation for me but still a winner in my book."
"Hazy orangish golden color with a thick white head that last the duration of the beer. Citrus, hops and pepper are is the nose as well as some sweetness. Sweet and dry with the same hoppy and citrusy flavors that are apparent in the aroms. Refreshing and light. Should be drinking this one in the summer, but hey, those're old wives tales about drinking ""within"" the season. Nice dry finish makes this saison highly drinkable. World class."
"Awesome brew, nicely flavorful, well hopped and extremely drinkable!! The beer pours a hazy orange-ish and sports a good fluffy white head. The aromas are of citrus, especially grapefruit and mildly spicy hop. The mouthfeel is a thing of beauty-highly refreshing and somewhat full-bodied as well. The beer tastes sensational, and is one that is sure to please many. Loads of thirst quenching citrus, and wonderfully bitter hop flavors that start fruity, then end dry and clean. This is a great beer to introduce newcomers to the wonders of Belgian Beer! A superb beer with food as well!"
"Loud champagne pop when removing the cork. Huge spritzy head that reduces quite slowly. Big tart aroma with some notes of white wine notes. Aroma is also dry and woody with earthy, musty notes. Tart apples are also on the nose. Lace is very sticky and forms a curved bowl from the surface up to the sides of the glass. Nice golden hue with a very slight haze. The start is smooth, quite malty, and somewhat fruity with notes of peach and sour apple. Quick hit of considerable carbonation is soon to follow. Carbonation lends to a rather fluffy mouthfeel. Spice notes come out in the middle  clove being the most noticeable. The finish is tart and dry with malt undertones still noticeable. First saison that Ive tried. Very drinkable and enjoyable, but Im not sure that I notice the farminess that some folks notice other then the mustiness up front."
"Explosive in the mouth as it wakes up your taste buds. Kind of leaves my tongue tingling. Very nice. Not sure what style of glass I should have used. I went with a chalice."
"Tasted at 't Rusteel in Belgium. Appearance: Golden yellow, clear, big head, but fades rapidly. Aroma: Spicy, big hop presence. Nice ""mustiness"" from cork. Flavor: Crisp hops, nice malt character in background, and good, earthy, cork character. Finish: crisp and tart. Some oxidation, but mostly seems beneficial to beer's complexity."
"Or, Think Saison  Drink Dupont. Then youll know for sure!"
"750 ml bottle, 2003 release indicated on the hoppy smelling cork. Rich, creamy, thick, cloud like head on initial pour that stays lovinly dense and sticky in the goblet as you sip. Fruity, yeasty nose with a twang of sweetness. Beautiful straw orange hazy look w=ith tons of little bubble action in the goblet. Initally bold and fruity upfront on the tongue this then complexly turns dry and slightly hoppy on the finish on the back of the tongue. A truly thurst quenching brew. Medium to thicker marshmellow mouth coat of malt love. Great lookin' and drinkable this is a great starter beer for a night of good food and good brews."
"OK, maybe a bottle of this and a bottle of Southampton saison. For variety."
"This was my first saison style beer. It poured a dark golden color with a thick head that stuck around for a while and left a little lacing on the glass. Quite a few floaties in the glass. The aroma was sort of yeasty and grainy with some fruits in the back, but not really very interesting. The flavor was a little too acidic for my tastes. There was also some sweet malt and a little fruity taste, but the acid taste made it out to be not one of my favorites."
"Hazy, yellowish orange in appearance, with a thin white head. Grapefruit, yeasty aroma. Flavor is fruity and fairly acidic throughout, with a surprisingly yeasty presence and a clean finish. Perhaps a bit of woody flavor in there too? Dry, lightish body, this beer packs the hops, but delivers them in a fairly novel and intriguing way. Props!"
"This beer pours nice and full with a descent head that lasts and a nice lace. It has a golden color and the smell is fruity and rich. It has a nice full body that possesses abundant carbonation. The taste is somewhat sour and citrus and has a bit more hops than expected; it is not sweet enough for my taste to help contrast some of the other flavors. The finish is very dry with a strong bite that stays with you."
"Hazy golen in color with a high level of carbonation and a large white head. Aroma is of spice and citrus. Taste is of lime and spices with a slight sourness. Finishes with dry with a yeasty flavor. I'm not too familiar with the style, but this was a very enjoyable brew."

"Taste wise this was fantastic. A crisp summer ale that definitely quenches your thirst. Dry, crisp wih a certain snap in the taste makes this brew a must have."
"Tastes very light and refreshing, and has the carbonated mouthfeel of a crisp Belgian ale. Not very high on complexity, but makes up for it in ease of drinkability. Flavors aren't really jumping out at you, and in fact seem to me to be hard to put a finger on anything specific. Grassy, earthy flavors are present, as well as some mild citrus notes. A great drinker, but not one if you're looking for loads of flavor. One of the few ""don't think...drink"" Belgian ales I have come across. Nonetheless, I like it and could see myself purchasing this again. Would probably make a nice introduction into the world of Belgian beers."
"A very crisp brew for the summer. Citrus notes make it refreshing, and the tingly carbonation is great, but it is at times overpowering. The flavor is not at all that impressive. It has a nice pale grainy character with lots of yeast flavor. The mouthfeel and drinkability are the real winners in this brew."
"This is a beer you could seriously session drink - which might be dangerous (grin). A lovely and refreshing beer and one I will try to have with more regularity."
"Cork cryptically stamped 2.002."
"Very attractive beer. Bright golden streams tiny bubbles champagne-like. Large-bubbled head is pure white and robust. Elegant and best suited for an elegant glass. Bright flavor is citrusy, mildly estery and I occasionly picked up cheesey notes. The light body is prickly with carbonation, but not unpleasantly so."
"Sampled this Saison in in a green 750 ml corked bottle. According to the cork, it was a 2001 vintage. I was concerned about the ale being light struck because of the green bottle, but the first smell dissipated these fears. The nose was slightly fruity with a background note of earthiness. The appearance was pure sunlight in a glass! A spun gold, effervescent body sat under a dense, rocky, white head that would not have looked out of place with a cherry placed atop of it! The head lasted the whold way to the last sip...talk about excellent head retention. The flavor was every bit as substantial as the head. An intense assault of tart hops backed by a fruitty maltiness that dissipates into a long, tart (almost lemony...if that's a word :) ) finish. I found this flavor to be both refreshing and exhilarating. What an excellent summer ale!"
"Very perky mouthfeel, I had great hopes for this beer. I still do, too. As soon as I get a good bottle, this review will be fixed."
"Additional notes: this is one of my favorite beers and has inspired my current foray into saisons. Even skunked to hell (yeah, damn green bottles), this beer is remarkable and lusciously tasty. If I could find a bottle that had NEVER seen even the dimmest beam of light, I think I would immediately transcend to beer heaven."
"Brilliant, deep golden color with a creamy white head. Has a high level of carbonation. The aroma is spicy, grainy, with hints of clove. The flavor is sweet, fruity, and spicy; it then flows to a dry, hoppy finish. It is a relatively light bodied, easy drinking beer."
"Pours with a towering white head which takes quite some time to settle over the super yeast sedimented pale orangey-golden liquid. Nose is loaded with ""horse blanket"" aromas and fruitiness mingling with a light maltiness and yeastiness. The taste is wonderfully light bodied and hoppy, with lots of fruity overtones coupled with an effervescent carbonation makes this a very refreshing and tasty (and winning)combination. Thge finish is damm near perfect, with the fruity/sweet flavors morphing into a gorgeously hoppy, dry long finish...this is one outstanding Saison, if you see it, try it!"
"Bottom Line: A less-compromising version of Hennepin that would brighten the hottest of Summer days and highlight a fine meal."
"Pour is a hazy golden peach color, with a monsterous thick white head. Head dissipates slowly to a good clinging lace, lots of tiny bubbles race to the top to help keep the consistent head and lacing. Aroma is grassy, sour (lemon), and moderately yeasty. Flavor is sweet, then sour, acidic, and a mild bitterness at the end. Body is medium in strength, very dry in the finish, and strongly carbonated."
"The front is malty with some citrus and spice. The middle is a little thin and light and bitters toward the finish, which is quite dry, a little metallic when cold. A pleasant sourness gives the finish a nice personality. Overall, a very good drink."
"Hazy golden in appearance with a slight orange tint to it. A medium sized frothy white head sits on top and has good staying power. Aroma is musty and cotton candy like. Very sweet. Grapes seem to be present on the nose as well. Flavors of horse blanket, must and hop bitterness are prominent. The sweet character detected on the nose really takes a backseat in the flavor profile. The mouthfeel is airy and effervescent. Not too carbonated as to hinder the drinkability. Body is about medium. Nice little farmhouse ale here."
"On the pour, a nubilous golden orange color, the head creamy in texture, off white in color, and gigantic in size, as it dissipates it leaves a sticky thick sheet of lace to conceal the glass. The aroma is that of over ripe apples, musty, hints of yeast, somewhat sour or astringent might be a better term. Lots of dross, and the start malt laden, tart as expected, the top skinny in feel, the finish piercing in its acidic bite, the hops bitter on the palate, dry and long lasting aftertaste. Quite a change of pace from the normal ales Ive been drinking, and a pleasure to be sure."
"I could sell my soul for this brew. Okay, maybe not my soul, but definitely your soul."
"Cellared 750 ml bottle. The cork is dated 11-98. It releases a Champagne-like ""pop"" when the cork is released, and a foamy head starts building in the neck of the bottle. Carefully poured it's a clear gold with just-smaller-than-standard bubbles quickly rising from points across the entire bottom of the glass. A second pour should bring up some haze and tiny dark particulate, giving it a hazy peach colored body. The carbonation supports the billowing, frothy, creamy and pillowy bright-white head; and it holds a continuous 1/2 inch or more of head. Quite an appearance! Initially it leaves solid sheets of lace, but as you progress through the glass they break up into an interesting 'patchwork'. The nose is musty, hay-like, and lightly sweet but lacks the citrus rind and spice of fresh versions. The body is thin and the mouthfeel is lightly creamy - a contrast from the biting carbonation of a fresh bottle! In this case, however, it adds to the drinkability as the spice and hop flavors are diminished as well. It offers a lightly earthy, touch acidic, mildly sweet malt with some soft fruit (peach, apricot) and a cusp of peppery spice. It's quite supple, and yet it retains a fair amount of complexity. Astonishing! It finishes long and dry with a bit of the forementioned supple maltiness, a touch of summer fruit, and some mild peppery spicy notes. It's clear that this beer is extremely well made, considering that it's held up so well after 4 years. In fact, I enjoyed the aged version just as much as a fresh one. It's notably different, but still quite nice. I wouldn't recommend laying it down for more than 2 years, but if you find one in a corner of your cellar a few years later give it a try, you might be surprised!"
"Hazy, dull, light golden-orange in color, huge frothy clingy white head that clings to the glass, flowery and yeasty aromas. Sour sweetness with flavors of grass and wheat then spicy yeast. Light body and very carbonated, clean, crisp peppery finish."
"A bit yeasty, but then it gave me this soft slightly sweet finish that I've actually never experienced with a Belgian before. Not bad, but not the most amazing Belgian ever."
"A big fluffy white head sat on top of a hazy beer that looked like dirty apple juice. Very vinous nose, but there was some pale malt as well. Pleasant, funky flavors associated with this style can be found in this brew. There were also more common flavors such as tart green apples and doughy bread. Also, there was a nice, long, soft hop bitterness. Very gaseous beer, but this did not take away from the mouthfeel at all. Normally I would see this as a problem, but in this case it seemed appropriate."
"Beautiful deep golden brew with a big fluffy/rocky white head that slowly fades, but never leaves, and rings the glass superbly. Nice musty aroma is the first thing to hit the nose with some very nice spicy hoppiness and spritzy spices in there as well. Nice tame malt lies in the background with some pepper and other spices over riding towards the end of the aroma. Nice light maltiness is the first flavor onto the tongue. This is quickly followed up by some light pepper and clove spiciness mixed in with other spices. There is a definite spicy, herbal hop flavor to this as well as some nice earthy qualities. It is almost like a Gueuze light. All the flavors I love in my favorite Belgian style are toned down just a bit for this one. Slightly sour and acidic qualities are balanced by the herbalness. Excellent medium-light body to this brew with an almost tingly feeling due to fairly high carbonation. Excellent brew and one that I would gladly purchase again."
"A great experiment on the limbic system (responsible for emotion and motivation within the brain). When does it shut down? Let me know...and enjoy the trials."
"Pours a hazy golden color with a very thick and creamy white head with very good retention. The head eventually dissipates into a smaller, rocky head that sticks to the sides of the glass while drinking. Very fruity aroma with notes of clove and nutmeg. The body is light to medium with a creamy mouth feel. Fresh fruit comes through up front in the taste with notes of banana and berries mixed with a tangy spiciness. Finish is dry and crisp. Drinkablility is almost infinite. This is one of my favorite Saison style brews."
"Very cloudy in appearance. I have to agree on the similarities to a wheat beer. Definately a hint of lemon. A real treat and a great find."
"Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a massive, pure white, meringue-like head that explodes every time new liquid is introduced to the glass. Cobweb-like lacing. The aroma is grassy and earthy, with honey, peppery spiciness, phenolics, musty yeast, oranges and apricots, and flour-like malt. The flavor begins phenolic, with some white pepper spiciness. Midway, the other flavors foretold in the aroma appear: honey, musty and funky yeast, citrus (orange peel and lemon zest), and bready malt. All of these ride atop a rustic, earthy backbone. Hints of leather, iron, and hops towards the end. The finish is extremely dry and completely washes the palate clean. Crisp and clean in body, with a fairly light mouthfeel and huge acidic undercurrent. This fresh bottle is a bit young and rough compared to some of the older bottles of this Ive had. Still one of the best examples of the saison stylea classic brew."
"2000 Edition. Loud pop when uncorking gave me an indication of how highly carbonated this brew is. It poured a crystal clear pale gold, with massive trails of CO2. Huge, rocky head with great retention. Leaves thick, foamy trails on the glass. Smell is lightly fruity with a grassy and spicy smell. Moderately tart taste of apples with plenty of peppery spice and low bitterniss. Light, crisp mouthfeel with a slightly dry finish. Lingering aftertaste of tart apples."
"The thick, fluffy, well retained white head w/ soft peaks tops a hazy dark golden hued brew.  Musty yeast hits the nose at first, then is ensued by candied fruit sweetness, citrus rind, and tart pear at the end of the aroma.  Cidery sweetness is perceived initially, but quickly yields to a capricious melange of honey, sugar coated lemon rind & rustic bready malt, w/ hints of green apple acetaldehyde and black licorice.  Well attentuated and somewhat dry, with a spritzy, lively mouthfeel that complements the tart fruit notes.  Hop bitterness is nearly lost, yet manages to offset sugary sweetness & accentuate the dryness of this brew.  Finishes w/ a bready malt and fruit combination reminescent of tart orange marmalade on wheat bread.  Saison Dupont is complex yet balanced, relatively light on the palate, and thus superlatively drinkable."
"Golden ale with long lasting lace and continuous beads. Mild aroma with light malt hints. Round and spicy in the mouth, with soft malt character contrasted with hard water, almost metallic. Hops give the beer a good crispness and the yeast really lays it on thick. Slight euro-skunkiness from green bottle. Long lasting finish which draws out the best qualities in the flavor of this beer. This is not quite to my liking; the yeast is overbearing and the mouth is a little too frothy for me. However I cannot criticize the quality of this well-made beer; only my taste and my inexperience with the style are at fault."
"Very nice fresh and spicy like a good saison should be, spicy almost peppery nose, with a bit of cloves and coriander in there aswell, i liked it a lot, spicy and not too over the top on the palate,very nice easy drinking saison."
"Big green bottle. A fun semi-hard pour yielded a fizzy third of a goblet head thats long-lasting. Almost a gold color, hazy and opaque. Slightly estery and fruity aroma. Pleasant sweet malt flavor, leaning toward the strawberry/banana, touch of black pepper. Lemony astringency toward the end. Finishes quite dry and a tad grassy, but the malt flavor is pretty robust initially. Pretty complex. I like this Saison style and give Dupont the thumbs up."
"Ah, the complexity of a first-rate Belgian saison!  Cloudy golden color, huge frothy head, nice lace.  And then a very dry fruity-spicy nose and palate with a dry finish.  Carbonation is on the high side.  Everything comes together so well in this brew -- it's just incredibly drinkable."
