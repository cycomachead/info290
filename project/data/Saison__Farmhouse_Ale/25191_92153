Starts with mildly tart lemon juice with some nice oak, moving through notes of funk, and a smooth, bready finish with very subtle notes of coriander or spice and lingering citrus.

Aroma is farmy flowers and barnyard hay scents plus country apples, acidic and sweet, woody, and gose-esque with a touch of something salty-like. Taste is tart and dry with light acidity, apple, white wine maybe, wood musk, and flowers. A bit mouthwatering with each sip. Texture is clean and fluid.. Overall very refreshing and pleasant. I could go for some more.","tastybeer","Jan 01, 2015"
3.98,0,3.5,4.25,4,3.5,4,"Mostly clear straw yellow color with minimal head forming on the surface.  Aroma is quite funky...barnyard Brett, flowers, lemon/lime, and musty oak.  Nicely flavorful and Bretty without being aggressive with the yeast.  Tart white wine fruitiness, flowers, grass, lemon, and woody spice.  There seems to be a slight saline quality too that adds to the refreshment.  Light, slick, and dry, finishing a little watery.  Definitely a nice experience, though way too expensive to drink as much as I'd like.","wedge","Jan 01, 2015"

3.92,-1.5,4,3.75,4,3.75,4,"2013 Batch 8. Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is a bright, hazy, gold coloring, with a solid halo of bright white head. Aromas of toasted grains and honey forward, with notes of vanilla, basil, cilantro, butterscotch, and grass. Flavors are toasted grain  and cereal forward, with a tart and tangy citrus blend to follow. Lemon and tangerine help kick up the sweetness, followed by an herbal blend of basil, all spice, subtle pepper, and lemon grass. Some astringent and medicinal notes in there, as well as subtle wood spice characteristics. The body is effervesced and extremely dry, giving the beer a dry white wine feel in mouth. The aftertaste has a sour overtone, with citrus and herbal spices lingering shortly. The finish is crisp and dry, and the carbonation helps to clean the palate quickly. Interesting brew.","GarthDanielson","Beers"
3.75,-5.8,,,,,,"Mouthfeel left a pucker as it was like sucking on a lemon and then licking wet cardboard, but that’s to be expected from this kind of beer. It was a very light beer, almost watery with mild carbonation, and considering the high bitterness and sourness it went down easier than it should have. Overall it was good and I’d try it again, but it wouldn’t be a “go to” beer for me.","CHickman","0"

The brew smells like lemon peel, earthiness, hay, limes, and oak.  Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of some tropical fruit, peppery spice, grainy/bready malt and green apple.  The tartness comes out more as the brew warms.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's refreshing and has a good amount of soft carbonation which helps make it smooth and easy to drink.  I liked this a lot, overall I thought it was good.  This was the first Crooked Stave beer I've tried, and hopefully I'll try more soon!  $8.99 a bottle.","bluejacket74","Beers"

Reminds me of brie... with that almost "footy" thing going on, especially on the nose, but also pretty evident in the finish, which is long. Speaking of cheeses... I get a bit of bleu cheese here, too. Along with hay, and lamb's wool. Meyer lemon, or maybe preserved lemon. In the back, there's a little acetone (nail polish remover), faint and blended in very well into everything else, confusing the senses and confounding some of the other flavor notes, but not in a bad way... like that one cord that kind of both disrupts, but pulls together a piece of music. The oak is also subtle and mixes things up, but in a good way. I wouldn't have guessed oak. Very interesting brew.","logicalparadox","Aug 06, 2014"

At the right temp, it had some field-like funkiness with the esters from the Brett shining through. Nice representation of the style, but it didn't justify the price point in my opinion.","PHBoiler","Mar 01, 2014"
3.91,-1.8,3.5,3.75,4,4,4,"Barrel aged table strength saison? Pours a cloudy amber, one finger thick white head fades quickly to a thin ring.

4.14,4,4.25,4.5,4,4,4,"On the fuller end of medium body with crisp, light carbonation and some tart, puckering sourness that lingers over the musty bugs, dry oak, earthy funk, acidic acid and sweeter fruit notes into a dry, acetic finish. Decent amount of tart sourness but could use more acidity. The sourness is cut by some lactic, cheesy funk and dry, toasted oak. Wild bugs contribute to the funk but there's a sweet vinous presence that compliments the bready yeast and ester-y light fruit notes. Almost has a white wine like characteristic mid-palate with some light grape and stone fruit flavor. Hints of grass and straw complimenting the bugs and funky yeast before hints of bread, apple and lemon juice come through in the finish. Citric acidity becomes more prevalent as it warms but it could be a little stronger for my preference. Some lingering acetic acid on the back end but it's not harsh or solvent like. Overall, this is a very interesting and flavorful beer. Kind of like a light American version of gueuze blended with earthy saison notes. Refreshing and easy to drink with complex flavors. Another solid beer from the folks at Crooked Stave.","corby112","Beers"

4.05,1.8,4,4.5,4,3.75,3.75,"Overall, what we liked best about this beer was its aroma. Here we were giving the classic saison, with funk, mustiness, grassiness, crispness, and juicy tartness. While it was somewhat lacking the nose, the oak aging took this experience one step further through the flavoring, and in aiding with dryness and astringency along the feel. The yeast/infectables, too, added that unique “Crooked Stave” twist to the thing, giving a tad more punch to the funk and the tartness throughout. The citric components were also heavily apparent, affording much of the bitterness in the final mix with the yeast. This is a bright, sessionable, experienced beer, and a great example of the style for those looking into it newly, and those who love it, as well.","TheBrewo","Aug 20, 2013"

However, with all of these aromas and flavors being present, it lacks the complexity that the great saisons have. Nevertheless, it is tasty and very drinkable. I’m interested to see what the other Crooked Stave beers that I have are like. Thanks for giving me the opportunity to try this one and the others, Jared!","BlackBelt5112203","Aug 19, 2013"

Aroma is kinda MIA, there is some sweetness from the fruity hops and I get a little tart brett, but really its justs messy and indiscriminate. Flavor is the same way, tastes a bit woody. some sweeter citrus, and a maybe some ripe earthy root type vegetables? A hodgepodge of random stuff that is just messy and fails to come together. Mouthfeel is thin and crisp with some slight activity. Overall, this beer is straight up no good, IMO. I LOVED the initial batch/variation and was disappointed when I heard it was not going to be continually offered. That said, I was excited when I heard the tweaks being done to this variation. Unfortunately, what sounded good on paper did not come out to be anything close to being good in real life. I gave this a few tries before I reviewed this one just to make sure it was a consistent problem and not simply one bad bottle, but so far all attempts have fared the same. Of all the Crooked Stave beers to buy a handful of right out of the gate, I wish it hadn't beenthis one.
