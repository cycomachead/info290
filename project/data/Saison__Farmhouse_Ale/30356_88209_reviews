"Definitely a fine Belgian. I get the Simcoe and Citra as well as the tangerine, bitter orange and spicy Belgian yeasties. However, I get no peach or mango as described. Maybe my pallet needs some work. Good offering but may not order another."
""
""
""
""
"Nice looking beer. Very earthy. Kind of a grassy, mildly inky, clay-ish thing going on. Floral and perfume tones are there as well. Very faint touch of sweet with a doughy and yeasty thing there too. Nice Belgian style ale. Love to see American breweries producing Belgian ales on this level."

"O - Great complexity and flavors that make this very good."
"Pours a nice cloudy orange with short white foam. Looks nice, Not a ton of carbonation. Nose is grapefruit. Nice dry with a slight bitterness, just what I'd expect from the style. I feel a bit of the heat from this. Very slight funk taste, less than expected> very crisp and drinkable. Would drink again but I much prefer the Prairie Ale..."

"O.  A very nice saison.  Not too funky. Nice mild fruitiness.  Very nice mouthfeel.  Finishes with just enough flavor to make you go back for more.  Gets better as it warms a little.  Will drink again."
"This is not just a hop driven saison, it's a monster of saison with hops integrated perfectly. They never steal the show, only complement the yeasty complexity. Awesome on so many levels."

"Oh cool. Make me review this in order to give a rating. How's this for a review?"
"Overall: Its the cleanest beer I think I have ever drank, it leaves no sticky residue in the mouth after drinking it. Its kind of like a saison, but not really. I don't know how to describe this beer because its not really an IPA and its not really a Belgian hopped up ale either. Its very unique really. Totally enjoyable."

"I was excited to stumble upon this recently while traveling through Maryland...  A standard pour yields a voluminous three plus fingers worth of light airy fluffy snow white head comprised of mostly huge chunky bubbles...  Excellent retention...  Once settled, there is a mostly full veil of lacing and moderate-to-thick collar...  The color is a slightly pale mix of light straw and muted amber...  A moderate bit of carbonation some of which clings to the glass and some of which rises briskly throughout...  Some lacing clings to the sides of the glass as the head starts to settle...  The nose is big and assertive...  It's equal parts Belgian yeast blast and citrusy hop goodness...  It smells like you're standing right next to the brew kettle...  Vibrant lemon and orange zest...  Some nice light earthy character as well...  Grassy and Belgian yeast to start...  A bit of an earthy hop bite throughout...  Some light peppery notes on the finish...  On the fuller side of light bodied...  Very delicate...  Limited carbonation...  Airy, but not thin in any way...  Just a subtle touch of dryness...  Quite unique and enjoyable mouthfeel...  A very unique and highly enjoyable brew...  A tremendous introduction to Prairie Artisan Ales...  The Saison character wins out by a bit, but the American hop presence add layers of complexity and dimension that make this a must try for any self respecting beer geek..."

"Deep gol in color with a slight haziness in the body.  Vibrant carbonation bubbles are plentiful.  There's a half inch of eggshell colored minuscule sized carbonation bubbles.  Aroma is comprised of sourdough bread,tropical hops and grassy saison yeast. I taste a blend of sourdough bread,tropical hops and earthy saison yeas.  The tropical hops really give it a unique twist.  APA meets saison.  There's plenty of carbonation and the mouth is crisp and refreshing."

"O:  A delicious and heavily hopped saison.  the saison characteristics are hidden behind the heavy handed hop notes but they do sometimes make an appearance."
"500 ml bottle.  Served in a Prairie Teku, the beer pours a hazy gold color with an inch off-white head.  Head retention and lacing are both very good.  The brew smells like straw, grassy and citrusy hops, yeast, mango, citrus peel, and earthiness.  Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some peppery spice, tropical fruit, grainy malt and a bit of peach noticeable.  Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's well carbonated and goes down pretty easy.  I think it's a good hoppy saison, another quality Prairie brew!  It's pricey at $10.99 a bottle, but it's a tasty brew!  Definitely worth trying."

"Overall an outstanding, well-crafted beer. Reminds me of some of my favorite dry-hopped saisons from the likes of Logsdon and Upright."
""
"How does this have a 94?! Taste is earthy with that typical belgian flavor, but a very thin mouthfeel & the hop taste is weak is totally forgettable. This is my least favorite Prairie offering to date."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel was thinner than expected."

"Overall: Bright, refreshing saison, layered with hoppy and fruity notes. No hint of its 8% ABV."

"Not enough flavor"
""
""

"disappointed in this one after all the good words I had heard. just not enough of a saison or hoppy....kinda down the middle of the road at 55mph. good beer but not outstanding. 3.5 is all it gets from me"
""
""

"On tap at Gainesville World of Beer.  Pours cloudy yellow with a creamy white one finger head into my tulip.  Aroma of big funky saison yeast, grassy hops, some pine, very sweet honey notes, and some other fruits in there.  Flavor follows with very sweet fruits from the hops, a bit of zesty citrus peel bite, grass, honey.  Mouthfeel is thicker than expected, but lightened up by the high carbonation.  Overall this was very nice, but not what I had expected going in.  Definitely a good beer, but easily one of my least favorite Prairie saisons out there."

"Overall, we’ve been very excited to try our first brew from Prairie, and our first brew from Oklahoma!!  This one certainly fits the bill, and doesn’t disappoint.  It is a nice and dank saison, overdone with a thorough dry hopping.  This allows for the hops to become part of the equation, without overwhelming it.  Said hops are subtle but add a definite bitterness to the taste that continually enhances and deepens with warmth.  Every component here is really well defined.  The finish is crisp, clean, and intensely drying, and is probably the most enjoyable and memorable aspect of this beer.  They really hit that stylistic point right on the head.  There has been a big outflowing of these hop-driven saisons lately, and the cultural shift is nearly palpable.  This is no doubt a product of that revolution, and it is welcomed with open arms.  We can’t wait to see what else Prairie has in their arsenal."

"Overall (4.25), I have to say this is one of my favorite beers from Prairie, and perhaps my favorite saison. Of course, I'm a sucker for the heavily hopped saisons, but they aren't all done well--it's just that this one is. It's the kind of marriage between the two core elements of American (hops) and Belgian (yeast) styles that provides incentive for brewers to keep pushing boundaries, because when they work, sometimes they really work."

"Pours gold with a huge, thick frothy head that sticks around for the duration of the session. Aroma offers lemon, ginger, tropical fruit, pepper and a touch woody. A light and crisp, almost prickly, active mouthfeel that finishes wonderfully dry. Overall, loved it and right up there for me with my overall favorite American saisons like Funkwerks Saison and Firestone Walkers Opal. Only thing that would prevent me from drinking this one again is the price point. Should be $4 to $5 cheaper, IMO."

"Delicate flavor compared to the slightly funky, floral and fruity nose.  Flavors of peach, lemon, grass, and a little yeast.  Bitter finish."
""
""
""
"Pours cloudy amber color with a thick foamy head.  Head retention and lacing are excellent.  Has that funky, Belgian yeast aroma.  Slightly citric.  Maybe some piney hops.  Belgian yeast taste.  Citric, spicy hops at the end.  There is a slightly funk aftertaste.  Pretty much a hoppy farmhouse ale.  Good beer, but I am not sure it is worth the price you pay for it.  Should be at least $4-5 cheaper."

"Light and crisp perfect aroma one of the best brews I've had"
""
""
""
"Very light lemony, grassy, hoppy nose with a bit of pine and herbal tones. The flavor starts more piney, with some grassy straw and herbal hop notes. As the beer warms or my palate adjusted this began to really open. It became much more fruity with a strong peach flavor. I also caught notes of mango and  tangerine but it seemed the peach was more prevalent. Interesting take on a Saison as the hops seemed to compliment the flavor rather well."

"Overall-  This definitely varies from the traditional saison, but that takes nothing away from this being an amazing beer.  Huge tropical hop flavors with a soft/juicy mouthfeel that could make me drink this all day.  (93/100)"
"Overall: Pleasant if not quite the flavor bomb I was expecting. A decent representation of the style. Perhaps an entry level representation, but I don't claim to know much of this particular style."
"Overall, a really solid saison. I loved how fruity and hoppy this one was. Very drinkable!"
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy gold with a bubbly white head. Huge aroma of tropical fruits, yeast and piney hops. Easily one of the best aromas I've come across. Tangerine, pineapple and mango stand out. There's a touch of spice, and the hops give it a decent bitterness. Medium mouth with a carbonated crispness. The other dry-hopped saisons I've tried were middling, at best. This one is juicy and flavorful."
"Pours a bright golden orange with a shimmering off-white head. Sour grapefruit goodness to the nose. Orange and lemon zest with a little sugar and spice and other light, ripe fruits too. Tastes of lemon, Belgian yeast and grain with a fine hop finish. Dry as can be and a little crackery in the end. So fine. So fine."

"A fresh fruity dry and hoppy like mimosa in a glass. Quite tasty like most Prairie brews."

"Overall: Love this one, fresh yet complex and offers a lot to observe and play with. Everything in good balance with nice smooth apricot notes in front."
""
""
"Pour is a very hazed light golden yellow with a tight white head. Nose has a nice dusty yeast with a hint of tangy spice. Lots of golden fruits from the saison and notes of it from the hops. Taste is even more dusty and yeast forward with a great balance of bright golden fruits in back. Light hop bitterness that adds to the flavor. Very dry finish, lighter body and assertive carbonation. Really nice stuff here, but gets a touch sweeter as it warms."
""
""
"This is a superb saison in any case: the hops just raise it to the level where it's genuinely exciting. It's a gorgeous beer."
""
""
"Pours a murky orange with a foamy tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, Belgian yeast, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with grain, Belgian yeast, and citrus flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop and yeast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and dry mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."

"0 - after bomb! maybe my favorite so far from prairie - lovely drinkable beer. highly recommended - almost a ideal mix of an ipa and a saison"

"O: This was very enjoyable. I'm not sure there was anything particular here to make it stand out above several other similar beers, but still quite good. If it was sitting on the shelves around here on a regular basis, I'd pick one up every once in a while for sure."

"O – Man, am I sad to see this one go. $15 for a bottle, but I’ll probably pick up another. There’s so much going on. I think they nailed the balance on this one from sweet fruitiness to sour farmhouse. This is arguably the best saison I’ve ever had, and that’s not an exaggeration."

"Got in a trade with Cyde. 750 ml bottle into tulip glass, 2013 dating stamped on the cork. Pours very hazy golden orange color with a 2 finger fairly dense and rocky off white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big pineapple, peach, lemon zest, tangerine, mango, pear, apple, clove, pepper, wheat, bread, hay, grass, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop, malt, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of pineapple, peach, tangerine, lemon zest, mango, pear, apple, clove, pepper, wheat, bread, hay, grass, floral, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pineapple, peach, mango, tangerine, hay, floral, grass, clove, pepper, wheat, bread, and floral earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible balance and complexity of citrus/tropical hop and fruity/spicy yeast ester flavors; with a fair amount of malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, lightly slick, and crisp mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic dry hopped saison! All around great complexity and balance of citrus/tropical hops, malt, and fruity/spicy yeast esters; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A highly enjoyable offering."

"With a bursting ripe fruitiness, light body, noticeable bitterness, and an airy feel this beer is incredibly easy to put away. A 750 simply isn't enough. Prairie hop is one of the better newish saisons I've had. Plenty more of these will be drank in my future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A nice Belgian ale. The hops are minimal, though, despite the name. Still, it's well crafted for what's there."
"Overall, sick, literally might be a top-5 beer in my life. Big statement, i realize but i think this beer is fantastic. That said, Farm House is my favorite style."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- The full juicy hops has some great compliments in the yeast esters and some nice malt support. This beer drinks very fast."
""
""
""
"The taste is right along the same path. The hops are juicy and then their bitterness rushes the funky part of the grainy-nut flavor through my mouth with ample carbonation and a medium/slightly thick creamy and refreshing mouthfeel. I also get a subtle herbal flourish, and orange rind is in there too. The slightly antique flavor I took as peanut butter sits well in the aftertaste, somehow. The finish is dry but right. The foam from the head is intact halfway through the chalice into which I poured this, appearing like cream. Nice. I dont recall having a beer that kept such a thick-top form. Unique brew. Recommended by local retailers here in north Texas, however I passed on it until now. Curiosity paid-off big time. Oklahoma is on the craft map here in a big way with in my opinion. This is as of now my second favorite Saison. Excellent overall. High drinkability. Seek."

"O- Very nice, not sure what i was expecting, i was not expecting it to be so hop forward, i very much enjoyed this one, would of preferred to share with someone, not a beer i would typically drink on my own. Very satisfied with my first Prairie beer."
""
"Overall: Delicious beer, especially on a warm afternoon. Looking forward to trying more from Prairie."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Overall this is a very nice saison, though it could use some more pronounced/defined flavors."
""
""
""
""
"O: Great saison. I am always slightly skeptical of new breweries. However, this beer makes me want to go out and buy everything that Prairie has out."
""
""
"O- A very refreshing beer that walks the line between IPA and Saison."
""
""
""
""
"Overall an easy beer to drink and buy if you ever find it"
""
""
""
"Overall - Not a lot of saison here, but nice hop flavors. Should also be noted that this beer had more of a peach aroma and flavor than two other beers that claimed to have peach added to them. Good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Solid brew, this is my first out of Oklahoma and I am definitely impressed with this brew and would have it again."
""
"So, yeah, this tries to be Orval and it does an okay impersonation. I like it better than Greenflash’s iteration, but the same as Rayon Vert, Hop’s hoppiness is a bit sticky and American and in some un-articulable way it just don’t jibe up with the Belgian Blondey-ness of the beer’s opening half. Pretty good, still."
"Overall, a fine beer by Prairie. Perhaps this wasn't the freshest bottle, as there were no tropical or citrus flavors to be found. Prefer the very similar Standard at $12 a six-pack."

""
""
""
""
""

"O - excellent beer. a real standout. i am certainly going to be looking out for more prairie ales in the future."
""
""
"O: This was nothing short of superb. Amazingly drinkable, yet amazingly complex. There is something here for anyone. I wanna stock this baby year round."
""
""
"O: A nice hoppy saison."
"Beer is medium in body, with medium-high levels of carbonation, leadint to a lightly fizzy, quickly-becoming-foamy mouthfeel that suits the beer quite well. Closes semi-dry, with moderate stickiness clinging to the palate."

"Mouthfeel is dry and bubbly. Overall, a new favorite of mine. Excellent use of hops here that play nicely with the farmhouse yeast for an uber-refreshing summer beverage."
""
""
""
""

"O - Overall a damn fine hoppy saison. Wish the taste was a bit more tropical but even with that its still damn delicious. Well done Prairie"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A delicately hopped saison that is among the best I have ever had."
"O - a very good hoppy Saison made with American hops. I'd consider it more like a Belgian IPA. Regardless, it tastes and smells nice. It's assertive, but not over the top."
""
""
""
"Mouth feel is not very dry and that's OK with me. Alcohol is very well hidden. I really enjoy this beer. I think it is getting better as it airs out too!"
"perfectly stated packaging, opens to reveal a most excellent aroma. It pours with a rich golden straw color, crowned by dense pale head that slowly reduces to a thin ever present visually pleasing icing for this wonderful slice of rich cake. The taste is incredible, it as if someone has taken my favorite IPA and Blended it with the best of Belgian saisons. this beer left me satisfied yet wanting another like a a drug addict needing another fix."

"Matt The Beer-Guy"
"T: Lots of smooth, sweet malt mingling with musty funk. A peppery hop finish mixed with some mango and a bit of a buttery mouthfeel. The feel was a touch heavy for me, but this is a really good saison. Get it."
""
""
""
"Verdict: A nice take on the saison by Prairie, but it definitely lacks many qualities of a traditional Belgian saison. The fruit character is refreshing and enjoyable and was easily the highlight of this beer."
""
"Overall- Really solid stuff, and very easy to drink. I definitely look forward to trying some more offerings from Prairie."
""
""
""
""
"C+"
""
"Pours out a cloudy golden apricot with a thick white head that eventually recedes. Smells strongly of sweet citrus peel and pine. Belgian character is overwhelmed by hops. Pale malts. Flavor is also very hop-forwarded. Kind of sweet up front with a drying finish. Belgian yeast plays a bit more in the flavor. Could use some more carb in the mouth. As an IPA I love this, as a hoppy Belgian, it's pretty solid."
""
""
""
""
""
"Orange color, slightly hazy, fluffy head. Tropical and citrus aroma: apricots, pineapple, as well as spices like black pepper . Finish is dry and slightly bitter. Light, but not thin, thanks to carbonation. One of the best examples of IPA and Saison available on the market."

""

"Poured caged bottle into tulip. Pours clear golden orange with a two finger white head. Smell is Belgian yeast, cutrus fruit, grassy. Taste starts with smooth Belgian yeast and lots if straw, some citrus fruit, some tropical fruit, plenty of hop bitterness that drys out substantially as it finishes. Very earthy. There's a nice little funk to this beer that mixes well with the hoppy Belgian wit flavors. A very unique beer that balances some complex flavors very well."

"Overall: Extremely refreshing, the hops really add some nice elements to this one. Grassy and fruity this is an excellent saison/hop beer with a tremendous smoothness and balance. I am very impressed with this brew and will be coming back to it often."
""
"Tart grapefruit, tangerine peels, pith, and fruit that lends sweetness. Earthy bitter greens. Ghostly hint of clover honey in the aftertaste. Tartness is pleasant and fruit-derived, it finishes dry with some lingering herbals from the base saison. Complexity is there, this beer is really well put together and drinkable. For fans of Crooked Stave, Fantome, etc."
""
"This had a vibrant orange color, like a warm horizon at sunset. The smell was of fresh mango and a bite of fresh hop pine. Secondary orange, banana, and pineapple. Taste is, if you can imagine, like the best mcDonald's orange drink I've ever had. Orange Julius with lots of teeth that bite your tongue and hold on as you drink it. This is exactly what it says it is on the bottle, a hoppy farmhouse ale and it's wonderful. See Prairie, drink Prairie."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is tasty, but gets knocked down a little due to price, $13 for a 750."
"O - This could be one of the best Saisons brewed. I wish this was distributed to WI, because I would buy it frequently in the summer months. Way to go Prairie Ales. Thank you 4balance!"
""
""
""
"D - Fantastic hoppy saison. Great balance and complexity."
"As near a perfect beer as you can get, especially for warmer weather. Opened a bottle courtesy of regular trading partner Chocosushi. Pours a nice orange-golden color with a creamy white head. Nice lacing with a prominent ring that lasts throughout the drink. The nose reminds me of PTE ... lots of hoppy pineapple, tangerine, and citrus aromas, with just a touch of saison/farmhouse yeast. Taste follows the nose...simply fantastic! Perfect body and mouthfeel for a saison. To me, this is what a saison would be if Russian River took their recipe for PTE and made a farmhouse version. One of the best beers I have had in the past year. Extremely well done, Prairie, and I look forward to your distribution area arriving in Texas soon."
""
""
"Poured from a caged bottle into a snifter, the beer is a slightly hazed, golden-straw coloring with a frothy, big bubbled, light, bright white head that retains around an inch and a half. Solid stream of carbonation bubbling throughout, also. Aromas of wet greens initially, with some citrus hops highlights and coriander spicing. Flavors are extremely well balanced, with a forward flavor of wet, peppery hops balanced with citrus and berry sweetness. There is a bready and roasted backbone that also blends and supports the spice and funk. Slightly warming, and the smooth body makes this a severely easy drinker. Wow. Candy sweet and herbal aftertaste that balances perfectly, and is subtle enough to draw you further in. Smooth, clean finish, with a hint of citrus and spice left behind to linger. Great brew."
"Hazy, bright orange appearance in the glass with a light white head. Many tiny bubbles bounce to the surface. The scent has a fair bit going on. The yeast is very faint as the hops take over with citrus and some grassy/pine. The taste is like tangerine juice. Loads of tangerine flavor with a bittering finish. The finish is a clean bitterness though that plays well and balances. I'm a big fan of the effervescence in this beer. It makes the beer much brighter and even more enjoyable to drink. I have a hard time calling this a saison. It almost drinks like a beer-mosa. It was a pleasure and quite tasty."
"Overall. Okay, this one blew me away. Just amazing tropical fruit smell and flavour that goes so well with the saison yeast. I need more of this. Thanks again Will!!"

"Highly recommended if you can find it."
"Hazy to clodu golden body with nice lacing and a single finger head without much retention. Aroma of breads, musty belgian yeast, saison funk, clove, tangerine and pineapple citrus. Flavors are very Belgian with yeast, funk, both tart and sweet generic citrus, caramel and breads. A little peppery. Hops are mild and likely provide more of the citrus and earthy flavors. Medium body and moderate carbonation with a semidry finish."
"D - Very nice, the funky yeast character is excellent and while I might like a bit more hop character, I did enjoy what it added to the party."
"O - Hoppy, light and sweet citrus. A unique, but pleasant candy-like flavor."

"A bottle from the most recent release, which just hit the market last week, so this should be really fresh. Bright gold-orange, airy head of white foam that builds to several fingers and lays down some nice lace. Vibrant citrus, tropical, herbal, minty, powdery hoppiness is front and center. A rustic graininess keeps it somewhat in line with the farmhouse theme in the face of the barrage of big American hops. Other complementary flavors include black pepper, woodiness, and a grungy earthiness, but really it's all about the bright hoppiness. Dryness accentuates the hoppiness further. One of my favorites from PAA, this needs to be available in more formats."

"Light body with good carbonation. Very refreshing."

"Overall, a well built saison. I especially enjoy the subtle use of hops in this beer. The base saison seems to be solid, but the earthy and spicy hop varieties really bring this all together."

"O - Loving this flavor... Smells like an ipa but drinks like a tart saison. Lovely!"

"one of the best saisons, if not beers altogether, that ive had in some time. this pours a soft pale amber color, faintly red, with at least two inches of sturdy white head and some suspended yeast. its mysteriously pale, and is emitting scents of far out yeast, fresh and abundant citrus hops, and a medium pale malt body with the dryness of an irish red. the flavor is the best of both worlds as far as hops and wild yeast goes. its familiar like mikkellers farmhouse invasion, minus the brett, substitute spicy apply saison yeast that's got all the farm you can handle. the hops are plenty bitter, but also cleverly fruity, which makes for excellent balance. every sip is different, cascading a new part of my palate, challenging yet comforting me at the same time. the craftsmanship behind the bubbles here is so profound, I promise you the beer world will start to talking about prairie before long. before this weekend, I had never heard of them at all, and this week I was fortunate enough to get a bottle of the noir in my rare beer club, and its burning a hole through my fridge. im sure ill drink it tonight after work unless I can garner some self control. this is maybe the best saison ever made, and it takes a lot for me to say that. the way the aggressive hops and the funky yeast play off each other is pure bliss. do yourself a favor and get a few bottles of this. youll never look back."

"Pours a nearly opaque light amber with one finger thick fizzy white head. Settles to a thin cap, spotty lacing. Smell: bready, wheat, grass and lemon, white grape. Taste: lemon, herbal, fleeting acetic note, pale malt sweetness, light breadiness, candied grapefruit rind, dried pineapple-ish. Fluffy, medium bodied, slightly chewy. Not sure the dry hop was still kicking in this one, but it's a pretty nice take on a hoppy saison... nice flavors, not an out-of-style amount of hop bitterness."

"This is a wonderful beer that should appeal both to fans of Saisons and fans of American Pale Ales. Very refreshing and easy-drinking, but with a fair amount of complexity. My main grip is that I feel this beer could use more carbonation. I will be drinking this again."
"Pours a hazy, vibrant orange with thin white head that slowly dissipates leaving little trace. Wonderful aroma of peaches, pineapple, mango, grass and flowers. Flavors of stone fruit, citrus and a touch of yeast. Light to medium body with moderate carbonation. Crisp, clean finish. Complex beer with many layers. So far I'm a fan of Prairie Artisan Ales."

"Great beer. Big Saison character under loads of tropical hops."

"O - Interesting and pretty good Saison. It was just too overwhelmingly peachy/fruity which started to get to me after awhile. This prevents me from putting it with my top Saisons."
"A beautiful marriage between a sublime American IPA and a fastastically rustic Belgian Saison. My hats off to Prairie Artisan Ales!"

"Honestly, this beer tastes like what the nectar of the God's must taste like. It makes me want to cry I can't get it where I live!!! Trading partners???? If you're out there, find me."

"Pours a malty amber brown with decent clarity and a nice finger of foam. Nose hasbright notes of citrus, spicy yeast esters, white pepper, lemon grass and a light funk. The beer really pops in the mouth, complex melon, watermelon, canteloupe are bright and big. Light pepper spice along with a suttle yeastiness which lets the melon and citrus shine. Slight earthiness rounds out this very complex well made brew. Easy to drink with the 7% barely noticeable."

"This one pours a light bodied, very cloudy and somewhat milky gold in color with a one finger, very soapy white head. The nose is in your face pineapple and Belgian yeast paired with a nice level of grassy hoppiness. Great nose. The flavors are bright and hoppy with excellent grassiness, lemon, grapefruit, and it finishes with a pineapple bomb of fruit character in the finish that dominates the after taste. I don't think I've ever seen that much pineapple in any saison. It is very unique and more importantly, incredibly good. You don't notice the 7% at all either, making this one dangerous and overly drinkable. This is my first Prairie experience and it blew me away. This is an incredibly flavorful and special saison. I highly recommend it."

"O: Blending of Simcoe and Citra hops lend an IPA-ish quality while the yeast and spices balance the traditional saison/farmhouse style. Really nice and would have again."
"Fantastic hoppy Saison. The hop notes were perfect to compliment the rustic nature of the Saison."
"O: Really nice saison. Great cross of styles, it's halfway between a belgian IPA and a saison. Nice pepper and tropical fruit notes that compliment each other. Nice balance of flavors and it goes quite well. Delicious."
"Overall, nice, and different. Try it."

"Pours a deep orange, nearly brown. Quite murky. The off-white head kicks up a finger or two of foam, but it quickly fades to a smattering of bubbles. Aroma is full of wonderful saison complexity. There's a big earthy note, really nice. The hops contribute grassy and floral flavors that blend into the beer without dominating it. A blend of fruity flavors also crop up - pears, grapes, apricots, plums, lemons, persimmons, pineapples. The taste isn't quite as strong as the Prairie Ale, which hit pretty much all the right saison notes for me. There's just a touch too much malt sweetness, but it's still quite good. Lots of spicy, grassy hop flavor comes across on the tongue. Also, more musty, barnyardy character than in the aroma. The malt just isn't quite as bright or crisp as I'd like, but it's still tasty. Just not quite up to the other flavors. Good grassy, herbal hop finish. Almost a bit minty. Good champagne-ish feel. Lots of fine bubbles. Full. I prefer Prairie Ale by just a bit, but this is another excellent beer from this young brewery. Very impressive work."

"This is a beer to seek out. Easily one of the best American IPA/Belgian style beers I've had, and it seems everyone is trying their hands at it."

"I like this beer. Dry hopping has made this a very interesting farmhouse ale. Fans of the style should seek this one out! I would have preferred better head retention, but the flavor and aroma are good enough for me to ignore my issues with its appearance."
"This is an amazing hoppy saison. They nailed the style, and one of my favorite American versions at that. Tank 7 and Saison Brett are among my favorites, and this is just as good. I guess there is a new contestant for great American saisons. Well done."
"Overall pretty nice, a well done saison and nice fresh hops to go with it. The hops go well with teh saison as expected, nice grassy little leafy and floral, some lemony citrus zest, and just enough bitterness. the saison flavors are on nicely too, not too much funk which would have overpowered the subtle hops, drinkable and tasty, well done. I would drink quite a few of these no problem (not in a row of course)."
"The beer is masterful as it really does strike the perfect balance between what's best about properly constructed saison and experimental new-wave hops. Its a delicious beer, making drinkability effortless."
"O: The aroma on this is heavenly - seriously amazing. The flavor is good, but is a huge letdown after the smell."

"O - A very well done Belgian style beer, reminds me of a Belgian IPA. It is a very well done saison/farmhouse ale that offers so much more than just a typical saison, as I stated before, I really would have guessed this more to be an unfiltered Belgian style IPA. Very well done, and I hope they keep making more!"
"I like this, very drinkable. This to me, is like Tank 7's slightly smaller brother, a little less in your face with the hops & a touch more funkyness, a bit more overall finesse"
"8.7/10"
"O-I have been fortunate enough to have every offering from Prairie and (withholding an infected bottle of Noir) and while they are all exceptional, I think Prairie hop is my favorite. It's so bright and vibrant with a really nice peachy presence (Citra Hopped?) that transcends the nose and taste. It's exceptional."
"The beer pours a clear golden with a very thin white head. The nose is citrus hoppy with a touch of bubble gum and mint. The taste is definitely yeasty with a great underlying slightly floral/citrusy bitterness. The mouthfeel is light-medium with a great hoppiness that lingers. This is a great beer that keeps a great hoppiness throughout drinking with great Belgian yeast characteristics. I'd recommend this beer for others to try, especially of you enjoyed bitter monk."

"Appearance is a dark amber. Smells of pine, very nice. Grapefruit. As an inexperienced hop head, how should I put this, it has the taste of some great IPA's ive had in the past, with a very good aftertaste. I know what tastes good and what tastes bad when it comes to IPA's and this is high up there on the list of yummy tasting stuff. Nothing bad about this beer's flavor in my opinion, taste is a subjective thing, I know. Try it, I don't think you'll be let down. I recently had a Lagunitas Hop Stoopid and would rank it on about the same level, if that helps. Great beer."
"While I appreciate this beer I'm not in love with the hop profile, tongue numbing floral and too much to have more than 1 glass."
