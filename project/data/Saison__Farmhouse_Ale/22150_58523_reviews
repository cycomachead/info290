"Gold in color with alot of head.  Smell is sweet with spice, maybe coriander or lemon.  Taste is malty sweet with spice and lemon. No discernable alcohol. Mouthful is light but very carbonated.  Overall a great session type farmhouse beer."
""
""
"The price is really good, and if I liked beer I might love this one."
""
""
"Nice golden color and for the most part clear.  Smell of lemon, pepper and sage.  Taste of pepper and coriander with sweet finish.  They can call it sage but i get more clove.  Mouthful is refreshing with medium carbonation and slight dryness. Overall its a unique take on the saison.  To me it tastes like a saison and dream weaver mix.  The wheat beer is definitely present.  Gotta be in the mood for this one."

"Overall:  Wow!  What an incredible beer!  I love the strong flavors of fresh herbs and spice, especially the sage.  This is an awesome beer, and so far one of my favorites from Stillwater, all of which have greatly impressed me and have scored high marks.  Highly recommended!"

"As a big fan of saisons, this was a nice take on the style, with a definite focus on the earthy herbalness of the sage in the fore. Enjoyable but I wouldn't say it shows the traditional delicacy of the style. Still a nice mix of citrusy, creamy malt and yeasty emerge over the course of this beer, and its a pleasing, if slightly rollicking, trip. Very solid."
"Fairly good example of the style...  Lots of earthiness present with the peppery zing of the sage on the finish...  A nice effort but not sure it's with the price point..."
"Rolls out with a pillow head that I had to wait while it dissipated, good retention.  It had the expected saison smell, with a good bit of spice.  The flavor was very nice, the sweet, with maybe a little spiciness, very clean on the finish, outstanding.  After being disappointed with my first few tries with Stillwater this one was excellent and will have me giving them more of a chance.  Outstanding saison."

"Light golden pour, slight white head that quickly faded. Llight scent, sweet and sour. Taste is surprisingly sour, with honey, lemon, and indeed sage, which lingers in the finish. Sour taste is shocking at first but after trying it a bit more I quite like it. The sweetness is nicely balanced with the sour, and the flavor profile is quite interesting. A very drinkable beer and a very tasty one."
""
""
""
""
"What can I say? I'm a sucker for this style.  Over the top spiciness and that saison earthiness.  Very good beer."

"This is the first stillwater beer that turned me onto them"
"Pours a gold color.  One inch head of a white color.  Great retention and great lacing.  Smells of pale malt, hint of hops, yeast, hint of pepper, sage, hint of rosemary, hint of sweet malt, and a hint of alcohol.  Fits the style of a Saison / Farmhouse Ale.  Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with a high carbonation level.  Tastes of black pepper, sage, yeast, sweet malt, hint of hop, hint of alcohol, and a hint of floral notes.  Overall, great appearance, great aroma, great body, great blend, and great complexity."
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel was good.  Nicely carbonated with the spices adding some interest.  Crisp, sharp feel.  On the whole, a pretty enjoyable brew, but an outstanding Saison?  I don't think so,"
""

""
""
""

""

"Overall, totally unexpected, unique tasting, and another great saison and pickup from the Stillwater gang.  Why have I never found this before?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  one of the better Saisons i've had.  more spicy than sweet; flavor profile, aroma, and carbonation hold up well through a slow drink."

"An improvement on the standard wit beer."

"Spicy black pepper beer with a dry finish and medium body. Nice hop backbone. Light tropic fruits."
""
""
""
"Smells of funky saison yeast and very sweet malts. Taste is thankfully not as sweet. Flavor is very spicy, but most of that must come from the yeast if sage is all that's added, and I can't really pick out sage in particular. There is a strong vanilla note throughout also that I didn't expect but enjoyed. Easy drinking but a little too sweet in the finish."
"Stillwater beers are uncommon around here, but I'll be looking for this and other Stillwater beers again."
""
""
""
""
"Fresh fruit, cheese."
""
""

"Delicious."
"O:  great saison like farmhouse ale.  Balanced well.  Will buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is different for a saison. It's a sage wheat beer on the nose, and a medium bodied IPA on the palate. Interesting, but I'm not sure the whole experience is coherent."
""
"Overall- An interesting take on the Saison, has the classic fruity, floral notes of a god Saison, but is also unexpectedly boozy and rich. This is a slow sipper, if you like barley wines and Saisons and are curious to try something in between then this is for you."

"O: 4 This is an interesting and enjoyable beer, but not very well balanced. I like the flavors and aromas going on, but the sage and other unique flavors overpower the farmhouse characteristics one would expect in this style of beer."
""
"o - i don't think this one benefited much from age. way too carbonated as well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Better balance in the taste. I get a creamy pale malt start followed by the aforementioned spices. The swallow is really a terrific blend of the two. Slightly sweet. Long lasting and unusual aftertaste. In a word, fascinating. The body leans to the thin side and the carbonation is high, but the combination seems to work."
"Saisons are probably my favorite style of beer and this has to be one of the best of the style by far - incredible! Refreshing and tasty - see it? Get it!"
""
""
""

"O - This is a pretty delicious Saison. Very easy drinking with lots of nice fruity and floral flavors."

"This libation was procured at the highly esteemed Bier Abbey in Schenectady. It arrived at the table a light apricot in color, and quite hazy--in fact, translucent. The head was thin, and lacing light. When it comes to saisons, I am almost always at a loss in describing taste and aroma. In this case, the fragrance was that of herbs. I can say no more, except, perhaps, that the slightest perception of mint seemed to surface. The flavor, as well, was imprecisely and very pleasantly herbal, with a strength that was surprising. Is there some citrus? Is there a spicy piquancy? Perhaps. After a few draws from the glass, however, the need to analyze recedes. The beer tastes good--that's what matters--and, well...distinguished. Its presence on the palate is foamy and smooth. Its finish, both in taste and feel, is quite fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is very good with lots of complexity from yeast giving some fruity flavors with mix of spice and light malt backing which comes off as dry yet light toasted with mild tangy yeast element and mild earthy spice coming in later with a crisp peppery finish. Overall this is a pretty great beer, highly enjoyable and the only adjustment I would make would be with the spice level since it relies a little bit on the herb/spice in the flavor/aroma."

"Overall: this is a very tasty and drinkable beer. It's got flavor our the yang, which is really working for me here."
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 12/5/2013. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy bright gold color with a 2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big lemon zest, tangerine, orange peel, pear, apple, pepper, sage, herbal, floral, grass, wheat, cracker, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus hops, yeast ester, and spice notes; with great strength. Taste of big lemon zest, tangerine, orange peel, pear, apple, pepper, sage, grass, herbal, floral, wheat, cracker, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy spice/bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, tangerine, orange peel, pear, apple, pepper, sage, grass, herbal, wheat, cracker, light bubblegum and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and balance of hop, yeast ester, and spice flavors; with a great yeast/spice flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome spiced saison style. All around great complexity and balance of hops, yeast ester, and spice flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Grabbed on sale $1.99 at liquormart. Pours beautiful orangy gold color with nice 2 finger head. Bright aromatics by smell with sage scent and citrus coming thru. True to the brewers description: ""quaffably refreshing"" on taste and perfect as its starting to get hot out. Nice taste profile but not above and beyond with unique herbal flavors as I'd hoped."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this beer didn't wow me as much as As Follows, Existent, or especially Folklore. It's just came off too simple so maybe a fresh bottle will capture this ""Wow"" factor eveyone has. It was still a decent brew though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This surprised me, though the ratings are on the good to very good side on average. The surprising thing? Today is April 5, 2014. This bottle has a bottling date of April 23, 2013. Wow, that is nothing short of amazing!"

"Overall: An easy drinking, thirst quenching, entertaining saison. Nice notes of white pepper, some sage, tart lemons and a pleasant wheat finish. The sage is not overbearing, but complimentary and the wheat makes it extra refreshing. Recommended."

"O: This is a fun, complex, fruity and grainy and spicy and herbaly saison"
"Clear golden liquid, white head with good formation and medium retention. In the nose citrus notes of tangerine, lemon and oranges. Pineapple from the yeast is present and maltiness is in second plan. In the taste citrusy remembering tangerines and oranges, pineapple os present too."
""
""
""
"O-Great farmhouse beer from Stillwater looking forward to trying stateside and existent"
""
"Overall - very glad I got to try this beer and I look forward to trying other beers by Stillwater!"
"As much as I enjoyed this, I will still shy away from Farmhouse because I cannot drink more than one without being overwhelmed by complex flavors of sugar and fruit."
"Pours a bright orange-yellow, like watered-down Tang; a bit cloudy, very little head. An interesting smell. Mostly citrus - orange zest, tangerines, some grass, a bit of a funk. The taste is quite exceptional and not very subtle. Right away a sharp, lemony, intense tartness, sour citrus. Then it eases a bit on the citrus, and that's where some herbal flavors come in - sage, grass - as well as a much needed but not overbearing sweetness, . The aftertaste is almost pure tangerine oil and zest. Slightly viscous, subtle carbonation, very fine bubbles. Extremely refreshing on a hot day, or so I can imagine. Why am I drinking this in January in Alabama and not in August? Well, it was on the discount table at 2 bucks a bottle. Definitely one I'd search out for again."
""
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer and will most certainly be picking more of it up in the summertime as it is more fitting for that time of the year than right now at the start of winter. If you like saisons and haven't had this one yet, pick it up and give it a try!"
""
""
""
"Gold and very slightly hazy. Head is small white and leaves nice stringy lace. Aroma is stinky, herbal, dank, cardamom I think-something bright and peppery, lemongrass. All over a nice unusual combination. Taste is sweet, grape, lemongrass again, pepper, sage, earthy and funky. Mouthfeel is dry and juicy. Very interesting beer and certainly enjoyable. I don't pick up on the sage right away in the smell, it mostly seems very herbal. Flavor is where I actually notice it among many other things. Not to be sessioned with but nice herby treat for sure."

"four packs just hit the state, cool beans. this pours apple juice color into a wine glass with a smallish white head. it looks clear for a saison, and not overly carbonated. the sage is intense on the nose, very up front. French saison yeast gives at the familiar acidity and juiciness. very very soft wheat malt taste, with the sage being more balanced but still quite pronounced, herbal and earthy. lasting in the finish too. the yeast is a little too strong, this tastes almost off, although it isn't, the proportionality is skewed. its not as delicate as it could be, and this is exacerbated by underwhelming carbonation. its not flat, but it doesn't pop. makes it a little heavier, and really, I don't want a six pack, four is enough of these for me. not as well polished as some other Stillwater stuff, but a creative beer worth trying."
"Overall- Comes off like a spiced wit, but the extra tartness and earthiness really kick it up a notch. Very, very nice - I'd definitely get this again."
""
""
"O: Excellent Farmhouse ale. Great flavors and aromas."
""
""
""
"12 oz bottle from ""Lifesource"" in Salem. $2.99 After a rather top heavy pour and waiting several minutes..its a hazy golden ale with a very large white frothy head. Strong spicy /phenolic aromas..herbal, slightly hay like nice. Flavour much the same as the aroma but with a very nice dry spicy finish. Overall a nice palate on this very vibrant,good level of carbonation for style. An unusual find in Salem Oregon but very nice regardless."
""
""
"O- interesting. Glad I got to try it but I'm also glad I only bought 1 bottle. The price just isn't worth it in my opinion. Too much alcohol/bitterness. Out of balance."
""
""

"Bottle says it is an American farmhouse ale, a wheat ale brewed with sage. Sage? Yes, sage, white sage. Packaging, despite having perhaps quaint intentions, looks pretty spooky. I mean, you think cellar door, first thing I think is bodies, then bugs, then maybe an old dead cat. But no, this really is a good farmhouse ale, and the sage is a nice addition. It pours a pearlescent amber with short head, and you definitely get the sage in the nose pretty prominently, along with berry and spice. Flavor is tart, slightly sweet, a little sour, and sagey for sure. Body is medium, almost approaches thick with everything going on with the sage and...is this hopped? I don't know. Definitely some bitterness in the finish, though. Good, probably great, but I don't think I'd get it again, ONLY because of the price and the four pack format. Otherwise, it's awesome. Get it. Open the cellar door."
"All around a great beer, I'm sure to buy more of this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This was my first Stillwater and I was very impressed, I'm a growing fan of the farmhouse ale style and this was a good one. Well balanced and everything works well together, hard to articulate the flavor but the spices and hints of pine/lemon really work. I will certainly try more from this brewery."

"Pours a murky yellow with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Thin streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, spice, and sage aromas. Taste is much the same with grain, yeast, and sage flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a solid sage presence that comes across slightly better in the aroma."
""
"o: Neat beer, I never had anything like this. I need to remember to seek out a fresher sample next spring. Add some fresh citra to what I just experienced? Wow."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Another fantastic offering from Stillwater! I definitely wish it had more hops and sage flavor, but I'm sure that's because the bottles have been sitting around for a while. I recommend getting this one fresh if you can! But fresh or old, it's a complex and refreshing beer, a combination that you don't see very often. I highly recommend it!"
""
"Overall, interesting saison, but a bit flat, overly spiced and a bit soapy."
""
""
""
"Although the hop bitterness is noticeable, the sweetness and citrus flavors balance it out to keep the bitterness down. A little more funk than the usual Saison, but that's not a bad thing. This beer delivers a satisfying taste and aroma experience. While a bit more bold in some areas than I might like, it still provides a smooth and refreshing taste and feel. If there's a movie line that matches this beer, it would be, ""Just when I thought I was out... they pull me back in."" Nicely done."
"12oz bottle, around six months old. Color is hazy orange, decent head. Smells good but its sort of spicy, peppery, herbal, saison-like, good. Flavor was really strong soap, potpurri, herbs, not really pleasant and a deviation from the smell. I would not purchase this beer again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Perhaps more of a Wit or Weiss than a Farmhouse Ale, but incredibly delicious nonetheless. This definitely seems to borrow a few flavor profiles from a German Weiss. The banana leaf, cloves and accentuated wheat flavors are all blended into a traditional Belgian Farmhouse Ale recipe to create something slightly different. For that reason, I give it a higher rating because it's not just trying to follow a traditional recipe or do what everyone considers a ""Farmhouse/ Saison."" This stands out a bit more from the group, and for that I really like it."
""
""
""
""
"Light fluffy but super carbonated. Sweet tangerine, citrus and tart fruits. Very subtle, could be the age, spicy earthy and herbal finish, dry finishe with soft lingering fruitiness and dryness. Hoppy bitter bite builds slowly as a nice contrast to some of the sweeter aspects."
""
"It's a good beer, but my body definitely does not enjoy it. I'd be willing to trade a bottle for some extra strength Tums right now."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Another stellar saison by Stillwater Artisanal ales. Grab a four back of this if you can and enjoy every sip. This beer would be great without the sage addition but I love how it adds depth to this already intricate beer."
"Overall: A very enjoyable beer, look forward to trying more from this company. Very drinkable, would buy it again."

"The beer pours a golden orange color, like a deep, dark piss. The beer forms a light head of pale white bubbles that quickly fizzle away to a thin, almost-non-existent scrim on the sides of the glass. In body, the beer is clean but murky, with just faint suggestions light and shapes coming through from the other side of the glass. Upon further examination, tiny specs can be seen floating in the beer, though none are of a considerable size. On the nose, the beer smells smoothly funky with saison yeast and a good touch of pepper that spices the nose. Pineapple and a touch of orange juice can also be sensed on the nose, along with a nice, light wheat flake scent that suggests the beer’s malt. The pineapple smell blends in and out of the funk smell, suggesting a presence of juicier hops and some nice, hay-like funk. On the tongue, the beer tastes fruity sweet and acidic with a light, tart pucker to the mouth and a very light touch of bitterness, which comes through more in the aftertaste. In flavor, the beer begins as light wheat malt, immediately exploding into huge pineapple bursts of flavor with herbal, funky side flavors and a light bitter grapefruit. The funk is deep enough that I think I detect some brett in the flavor, though I didn’t think this beer had any in it… The finish is dry, yet full of pineapple funk flavors and just a touch of wheat malt, which the aftertaste accentuates. In the mouth, the beer feels sharp in carbonation, coming in somewhere on the heavy side of medium, while the body sits on the tongue comfortably at a medium weight. The mouth is left dry except for acid cancelling saliva on the sides of the cheeks and a light stickiness on the tongue. Overall, this is a nice little saison with some rich complexity. It is delicate and very fruity with its funk, most likely due to the addition of white sage. It’s not my favorite American Farmhouse Ale though. It’s good and tasty and I would never turn it down, but it doesn’t seem like the type of beer I would drink more than one of at a sitting, as it sits in the stomach a little heavy. It’s rich and complex, but it doesn’t light up my palate like it has for others."

"Poured into tulip; translucent yellow/gold with a lively big white head that fades fast, leaving chunky lacing. Smells yeasty, crackery malt and hint of sage (it's brewed with white sage). Crisp floral hops, lemon rind. Taste is lemon rind, biscuity malt, slight herbal sage flavor, citrusey floral crisp hops, yeast. Mouthfeel is lively, fizzy, and clean. Finish is dry. Delicious adn refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O – This is a nice saison. As I always say, I tend to like some Brett in my saisons, and there isn’t much to be found here. Still, the musty character is almost there due to the strong presence of earthy, herbal, and floral aromas and flavors. This is a nice beer to just chill out with on a summer day. I probably wouldn’t want to drink a bunch of them due to the ABV and complexity (it’s just a lot to take in), but it’s still certainly very drinkable. Nice beer from Stillwater, and I’ll definitely be trying more."
"O: Overall very crisp, lightly tart and musky with a very easy approach. This is very easy to consume, smooth, and easy to drink in multiples. A great summer tart summer drink."
""
""
""
"This is a fantastic saison. Of all the American saisons I have had, I find this one to be most similar to the classic Saison Dupont, but the use of American hops and the addition of sage add their own character. Cellar Door does the style very well and adds it's own unique twists."

"Overall- Very solid beer and very close to being a four. Definitely worth a try (unless you hate sage)."
""
"O: An interesting saison. The appearance and nose were a bit underwhelming, but the first sip of this convinced me that this is a beer to be taken seriously. As the first beer from Stillwater Artisanal Ales that I've tried, I have to say that I am impressed."
"The body is medium and there's certainly a creamy feel. carbonation is on the higher end but remains pretty well moderated. The crispness is second to the smoothness but is there, particaularly as the finish goes slightly tangier (in a good way)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Soft wheat and light sweetness up front. Herbal, spicy bitterness falls in behind, but sticks around. Grainy, slightly fruity (pear) malts mid-palate, accented by Belgian yeast funk. Sage and tea spiciness come on strong and meld with the simmering herbal, spicy bitterness into the finish. Lingering pear, yeasty notes, and sage. Moderate body with a lively, prickly feel. Not the best Stillwater beer I have had yet, but interesting no doubt."
"Bottom Line: Great brew from Stillwater!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: this was so good - really nice balance between the softer malts and crisp hops, slight blanched-out tartness - very smooth-drinking and crisp at the same time."
""
"Supremely herbal and spicy yet somehow balanced out and super complex. Worth trying for anyone looking for a good American-made Farmhouse Ale."
"Overall, a nice beer. I think the sage is a bit overdone, but others might really like a Saison with this kind of earthy, herbal edge. I do like the mustiness on the nose and wish more Saisons could capture it."

"O: Subjectively, saisons are pretty hit-and-miss for me. I'd easily call this a 'hit' though, thanks to its balance between drinkability and good (but not great) complexity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Interesting brew. Not as drinkable as some other Stillwater beer, but a much more unique flavor profile."
""
"Now that I wrote the review and have read the brewers description I think he describes the ale damn near perfectly, I just would have never guessed that he used citra hops whatsoever. I would love to know where he used them in the process"
""
"The body was about average for the style, perhaps a bit fuller than a lot of examples, and had a nicely dry finish. Drinkability was very good, a couple of these could go down easily. Overall, a pretty nice beer. I'm not quite sure it was worth the $8/12oz price, but it was still worth a shot."
""
"Accomplishes what it sets out to do. A great beer to take you from winter in to summer. Light and easy drinking with enough complexity to let you know it's not just a lawnmower beer. A damn fine American farmhouse ale."
"Very good rendition of the style."

"Pours a foggy, glowing, gold hue with a rather disappointing thin, white covering. Bright herbal, sage, and peppercorn aroma...grassy, yeasty, and very fresh smelling. Good sage notes continue in the flavor, but not overwhelming like some beers that utilize herbs. Spicy, flowery, lemon peel, lavender, yeast, and slight cracker malts. Light, crisp, and very drinkable. Love the 12oz. bottle. I'll be buying a 4-pack soon...."
""

""
""

"O - Nice and complex yet easily drinkable and approchable. I'm glad I got a pack and not just a single!"
""
""
""
"O: Very pleasant farmhouse beer. I enjoyed the mild tartness in the finish, as well as the spice and muted Saison yeast. A very seasonal beer of which a bomber went down easily. The only downfall was the over-carbonation and noticeable heat. I would be happy to drink this one again."
""
""
""
"Pours golden from the bottle with big tall head. Aroma of lemon zest, orange peel, and a bit of yeast funk. Light mouthfeel with big flavor. Sweet honey similar to a tripel, but with nice zesty citrus and a little something I cant put my finger on. A nice crsipness and after-bite from the sage and light enough to be sessionable. One of the most flavorful wits I have had, and easy drinking. Good stuff. I have had mixed feelings about Stillwater things I have tried, but this was knocked out of the park."
""
""
""
""
"O: Frothiness takes away from the drinkability. Definitely a sage lovers beer, but only a decent saison. Better once you burn off some bubbles."
""
""
"A decent enough Stateside saison (I know that I'm cribbing this from another Stillwater offering), with the extra IPA-esque hopitude and schizoid spice usage just adding a certain je ne sais quoi (en fonction de la santé mentale de la brasseur) to the whole deal. At any rate, a pleasant, not overly boozy Saturday night special."

"O-a nice Saison from Stillwater with good flavors, easy drinking"
""
""
""
"O: What a fantastic saison. Light, zippy, sweet citrus, sour peel, nice spice, delicate stone, with a slightly bready finish: sun in a bottle with complex spice and heft. This is a winner."

"O- A bit more hop and alcohol presence than I'm used to in a Saison, but it works out well in the end."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a nice change of pace from the stouts and winter brews associated with the season."
"This is a wonderful beer that not only suits the taste of summer, but will reward any Belgian ale appreciator year round! And I'm considering regrowing my mullet."
""
"Light body and well carbonated, scrubs the tongue clean without being aggressive. A solid saison."
"o: very pleased with this beer, solid example of a farmhouse ale."
""
""
"D - Good overall balance between hops, spices, and yeast character."
""
""
""
"O: Good stuff. Really good stuff."
""
"Overall (4.5): This is one of my favorite beers, and with good reason. The flavor and aroma of the beer are both so balanced and have so much going on, without being confounding in any way: the sage feels like such a perfect fit with the saison yeast, as do the Citra hops, but on different ends of the spectrum (sage complementing the spicy esters and the Citra complementing the fruity esters of the yeast, respectively). That’s my feeling, anyway. What’s also great about this is that it’s a top-notch saison that would be a great introduction the style for those unfamiliar. This beer is fantastic, I highly recommend it, and will absolutely be seeking it out in the future."

"O- A solid saison, the use of sage is interesting but it loses some points on drinkability, anything past 6-7 oz becomes difficult to drink because the sage and spice become very overpowering, as is all too often the case, there's no reason for this to be in a bomber."
""
""
""
""
"D- This was quite an enjoyable beer. As it warmed it seemed to express more and more flavors and it looks beautiful from start to finish."
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a hazy golden orangey color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of lightly hoppy notes with light spices and a medium sweet malt backbone is quite interesting. Taste is a complex mix between some lightly sweet rustic malt notes with some fruity ester with dry hoppy notes with light notes of spices. Body is full with limited filtration and good carbonation. Easily drinkable while providing quite a lot of complexity."
""
""
""
"Pours light golden diaphanous with a sheet of white foam and nice lace. Nose is peppery, sage, citric tones, lime, coriander, grain and good yeast character. Flavor is full grain, good clay like yeast, some hints of mint, coriander, lime, orange, chickpeas, and some pepper. Medium on full bodied with hi carb and some dryness on the finish. Another good showing from this brewery I only recently approached."
""
""

"Signed by the brewer! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller Teku. Poured a golden yellow with a two finger white head that subsided to one finger slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, earth, spice, fruit, passion fruit, kiwi, and floral. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, banana, spice, earth, alcohol, and passion fruit. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. I really went into this one expecting to find a huge earth dominance going on, but was pleasantly surprised at how much the fruit aspect dominated this one while still having the earthiness present. All was well, but I just wish that the flavor was a little more balanced as the earthiness was the dominate factor in it. There was quite a bit of fruit but it kind of clashed with the earthiness and alcohol. Definitely a must try for any Saison fan out there without a doubt."

"In all a well balanced very good Saison."

"Nose is slightly funky with orange, citrus and fresh cut straw. Flavors are similar with an added green apple finish. I would recommend this for someone trying a herbal beer for the first time. Very nice indeed."
""
""
"I had it again 10 months later and hits the spot, good spice, coriander."
""
""
"It's not what I typically look for in a saison, but is really interesting, tasty, and not easily forgettable."
""
""
""
""
"This drank too easy, love the citra hops in this, puts a nice American spin on this style, easily one of the best beers I've had in a while"
"Go, beer!"
"Had on tap at Max's, described as a Witbier with sage on the beer list, interesting to see it as a saison on here. Regardless, this was a damn refreshing wit and the sage added a nice spiciness to it on the back end. Full flavored and refreshing, it's a great twist to the style that works very well."
""
"Overall, I'm impressed. I think this is my first from Stillwater, and they've definitely earned a spot on my ""buy it when I see it"" list."
"Different. Over carbonated for sure. Don't think I could finish a whole bomber between the carbonation and sage presence."

"Overall very impressive. One of the most carbonated beers I've ever had, surprised it didn't gush..."
""
"O- Very nice. Not my favorite saison, and I don't get the white sage notes, but I do like this one anyways"
"OVERALL: An interesting take on the Saison style. Lots of herbal and spicy flavors, and a delicate tartness. One of the more popular Stillwater beers."
"A great drinking beer, enjoyed from a Tap & Mallet pint. This has enough character to be discussed, yet is restrained enough to enjoy on its own with friends. This could easily be a summer staple. Good times."
""

""

""
""
""

"D: overall this is a really well-made saison with the white sage adding a whole other dimension of flavor. this being my first brew from stillwater, i will definitely be seeking out more examples."
"This one wins. A great saison. I'd buy another and keep it til the dead of summer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: A nicely different rendition. Good basic profile and style points with a very deft addition of sage. Herbed / spiced beers can be hard to pull off in an attractive and highly drinkable fashion. This one pulls it off nicely with sage, hops, & yeast all merging together in an enjoyable fashion."
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a fantastic beer. I need more Stillwater products on the shelves in Columbia."
"...Tried it in the bottle @ cellar temp and the beer is incredible with a huge, fluffy head (and great retention) and tremendous amounts of white sediment. outstanding!"
""
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a light orange amber. Massive white head with medium sized bubbles. Pleasant aroma of yeast, citrus, sage. Nice flavor of wheat, light malt, coriander, light fruit (pear and apple). A slight hint of must. Sage adds a unique flavor and hop like dry kick in the finish. Light to medium bodied with nice carbonation for a pleasant mouth feel. Complex and very refreshing. I like this very much."
""
""
"On tap at Sessions in Greensboro.Poured into a tulip glass a lightly hazed lemon tinged lighter golden with a large fluffy white crown that lasted for almost the duration,fresh citric hops burst out in the aromas along with light white pepper,I liked the fact I didn't get alot of funk.Citric hops play a huge role on the palate with underlying funk and that white pepper,a light sour tang came in the finish.Iam not a saison drinker most of the time but I have enjoyed Stillwater's takes I have had of the style."
"Pours a very hazy golden yellow hue which leaves a two finger creamy head and sporadic lacing its a really nice looking Saison thats for sure,the smell is spicey herbal aromas mixed with tangerine,wheat and orange peel,the mouthfeel is just medium bodied and really does suit this style to make it sessionable while still being flavoursome with tastes of tangerine,lemon zest,earthy spices,herbal hops and finished with a pleasant grassy spicy dryness that leaves you wanting more and overall its a nice,flavoursome,sessionable drop that i would recommend if you like your Saisons."
""
""
""
""
"Heavy side of light body, active carbonation. Drinks well, minimal abv present. Polished off the whole thing easily. Another one I really enjoyed from Stillwater."
"Taste is really herbal and spicy with a lot of sage as expected. Mouthfeel is full and rich. Really tasty and easy drinking."
"O: I am always a fan of saisons, and this one is no exception. The yeast, alcohol and grassiness compliment each other very nicely"
""
"Pours a cloudy gold with large head and a lace ring on top of a spicy, clove-like aroma, full of yeast/wheat twang, light citric and herbal notes as a touch of sweetness. The body is light and crisp, but it is also filling/fluffy from the yeast. Crispness is pleasurable, not a deterrant, as a great blend of citric/herbal hops, clove, spice, and I guess sage (can't really tell to be honest) blends with typical light saison fruits such as tropical (label says tangerine, more like pear, green apple) and there is some mild sweetness in the beer. And while at 6% it's not an alkie bomb that 6% is nowhere noticeable and this is a great sessionable ale that finishes so dry and easy."
"Climbing the learning curve for the style and given how enjoyable this one was, I can't wait to try others."
""
"O-very good, I think I prefer it over the Stateside but both were quality saisons. The herbal and hop flavors in this one were a little more interesting. Both capture that great summery quality that makes saisons so enjoyable."
""
"Purchased on a recent trip to St. Louis. No freshness info. Poured from 750ml bottle into a tulip. A - Huge white head which dissipates rather quickly to form nice patches of foam which linger. Hazy light golden brown color. S - Good amount of funk with citrus and wheat aromas. A nice smelling beer. T - Burst of lemon flavored with some spice and peppery notes. Hint of grass and floral elements. M - Smooth medium body with a high level of carbonation. Perhaps a bit too much carbonation for my liking but a very pleasing aroma and flavor. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
"O - A memorable Saison, loaded with unique sage character. I need to pair this with food asap!"
""
""
""
"O - Mostly subtle flavors going on without the big barnyard yeastiness I'm used to for the style. Very enjoyable, easily drinkable, and could be used as a nice introduction to the style."
""
""
""
"Overall a pretty interesting beer. The white sage is very present but not overwhelming. Well balanced but still pretty complex."
"Overall: Pretty drinkable brew. Still on the fence with this one, but not bad. Keep up the good work Stillwater."
""
"This has a fantastic aroma and a great bouquet of flavor. The body is medium, but can be very slightly watery."
""
"overall - really good. not loving the sage. thought it was a weird choice, and it worked better then I expected adding some earthy notes to compliment the spiciness of the yeast. no off flavors to mention."
""
""
""
""
"O-A good example of an American farmhouse ale. A nice balance of American hops (sterling/citra), sage, and yeast phenolics. Malt and wheat are evident. No hot alcohols. A rather filling farmhouse ale. Would like it to be a little more crisp, and effervescent. But, good none the less."
""
""
""
"Taste explodes with carbonation and fills the mouth, way too much carbonation, citrus peels takes the front of the flavor, yeasty spiciness hits the sides of the tongue, finishes semi-dry and refreshing, swirling out some of the carbonation helps."
""
""
"Shared this bottle with a non-beer geek (more of a wine enthusiast) and he loved it. Intriguing, tasty, drinkable, impressive. Quite good."
""
"this is the kind of beer that gets me excited by beer again. huge, fragrant, bright white head tops a beer the color of clover honey. smells like sage and clementine peels. tastes like kissing the clementine eater with a cracker crisp finish. thin and gently effervescent mouthfeel. brightly herbal and beautifully balanced."
""
"I had this in a flight last night and really quite enjoyed it. Of the four samples this one had the most character(notes of citrus, chardonnay, thistle, and pine) and it come thruogh in both the nose and even carbonated mouthfeel. I have heard good things about this brewery and based on this example of their stuff i am going to be trying some more and hopefully on tap."
""
"Overall a very good light, refreshing Belgiany ale. Technically an American Farmhouse ale, which I think is more like a Saison--not sure if this is Belgian or French originally. I am enjoying it very much right now listening to Thelonious Monk, but would be better on a hot summer day."
""
"The mouth feel is spot on. Again, the carbonation is definitely present but it does not distract from the beer at all. Another home run from Stillwater."
"Overall - a very tasty beer. A little richer and spicier than I like from a sessional beer but still delicious. Was the perfect compliment to the fresh oysters (baked brownfeller in the shell) and pasta olio we paired it with. Overall I really liked this take on the Saison and enjoyed the surprise."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very impressed with this one. Certainly would pair well with food and certainly is creative and inspiring. Another winner from Stillwater."
""
""
""
""
"Almost! A good beer, with a lovely bunch of adds to what is usually a fairly staid, dull style for me. I like what's going on here, & I'll grab other Stillwater beers if they continue to show up across the river."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Overall, a pretty good Saison. Smells great, but the taste fell a bit flat, a little too sweet for my liking."
"Pours a slightly cloudy golden color with a thin white head into this tulip glass. Smells of spice and sage, tastes about the same with some citrus, faint spice, and a strong piney/ sage punch. After taste is a lingering citrus and sage. I like this one a lot, its easy drinking and very refreshing."
"A decent saison, but not particularly memorable. Fruity in the nose, spicy in the mouth, and bubbly all around."
"Poured a bright, hazy orange, with a fluffy bright white head, several fingers in height. Sticky lace and great retention. Nose has citrus zest, tangerine, orange and lemon, wheat and some pale malts. A touch of funk and some herbal spicing as well (sage perhaps, as the label indicates its addition). Taste has bright herbal spicing as per the nose, more citrus zest (lemon and tangerine), wheat and a little more funk. Some spicing in the finish, but the Citra hops are well displayed here. Quite light in the mouthfeel, smooth with a light bite imparted by the carbonation. An excellent saison, I really enjoyed this - certainly the best saison I've had in recent memory."
"Overall this is a really great beer and probably my favorite I've had from this brewer, so glad I picked up the Chardonay barrel aged version to compare it too, might have to save that for the warmer months."
"A very nice Farmhouse Ale from Stillwater. A must try if you can find it."
"For me, the flavour here is not quite right. It's very dry and fruity without the spice and hop on the palate of the classic saisons."
"Comes out of the bottle a slightly hazy, pretty solar yellow with a nice thick white head. Malty aroma has a decided overtone of sage - oh yes, you can smell that, and it makes this beer all the more appealing! OK, on to tasting - yummy! Malty, fruity, earthy, with that sage overtone that makes it distinctive. Notes of banana and pear enhance the sweetness without making it too sweet. I do not like beer that is over-sweet! Body is about average, but it is fairly fizzy and leaves a nice malty finish with an overtone of that sage. Get it whilst thou canst!"
"O: Nice saison. 4"
"Drinked at Brian Stillwater Conference @ Delirium Village."
"Overall very nice, a bit boozy especially for 6.6% but otherwise tasty, interesting nice spices."
"A - lets start off saying, this is one of the sweetest bottles of all time IMO, pours a golden honey color, transparent big head falls to a light ring and is very active. yeast in the nose, light lemon zest follows, some wheat, more citrus acidity influence. fruity flavors, with a subtle bitterness, very crisp, grassy, lemony, mint? very good tasting beer more of funk is desired. medium to light body very prickly on the palate, active carbonation. overall solid and very refreshing. like the fruity aspects that compliment the crisp, sharp farmhouse charcteristics."
"This beer poured out as a hazy yellow color. The head was fizzy and white leaving behind just a few bubbles on the glass. The smell is of fresh grains, Belgian yeast and some light lemon on the nose. The taste of the beer is refreshing, and has a light farmhouse flavor to it with just a little bit of citrus in there too. The mouthfeel of the beer is light bodied and fresh feeling, lively carbonation. Overall the this is a good brew, very drinkable stuff here."
"Poured into a tulip. Comes out a hazy golden straw color. There’s a thin head that dissipates rapidly. I pick up a strong sage aroma with some piney notes. The sage comes through on the palate, sharp and distinct. Very effervescent. It’s piney, or perhaps more accurately, rosemary-y. Yes, rosemary, although I don’t think it’s brewed with it. I catch a little bit of chew on the finish with a residual aftertaste. (Not chew as in tobacco, chew as in chewy.) There’s some funk at the end as well. Makes me wonder how it would develop with time. This beer doesn’t disappoint--far from it-- but it’s not the repeat of the transcendent experience I was hoping for."
"O/D: A pretty crisp, drinkable farmhouse ale; complex in the taste department; kind of refreshing but the savory finish impedes a bit; an interesting brew, for sure - kind of nice with this leftover watermelon..."
"Taste is light and crisp with a dry clean finish. This is a classic saison. Water also seems to be a key ingredient with this one."
"O- This is a top notch saison - very deep and complex, but also quite refreshing. Stillwater may be the new kid on the block, but they know what they're doing. I'm glad I picked this one up, but it won't be an everyday drinker for me."
"O: Very happy I picked this one up, and would recommend it to anyone into the Farmhouse style. A nicely balanced, crisp, fresh Farmhouse Ale with a fantastic clean finish."
"Conclusion: This saison won't hurt you with alcohol bite or yeast twang, but it isn't a domesticated example of this varied style either. I like the textured flavors and balance of old-world style with hops and spices. Certainly worth you while and your money if you have any interest in this style of ale."
"D: This was one of the better saisons I've had, with super complex, delicate and delicious scent and taste. Nice body for the style, and low alcohol, so quite easy to drink but should be sipped to savor. Not for aging. Highly recommended."
"The feel is light with good carbonation. Seems to be somewhat coating on the pallet though. Overall I'd say this one hits the spot for what I look for in a saison. Very well done."
"Drinkability – The spice note mingles so nicely with the lemony citra hop note. It adds such a unique edge to this beer that keeps your interest throughout. I wish there was more behind the spice, but the dry finish combined with everything else in the flavor is enough to pull me back in."
"A very enjoyable quaff. Super solid and super quality in every aspect. This is my first Stillwater beer, and I'm now officially anxious to try more."
"Overall, this is a cash money Saison. Wish it was available here because I would crush this on the reg all summer long."
"This was intended to be a gift for a friend until it started gushing in the back of my car on the way home. Truthfully, I'm glad I had this all to myself."
"This is quite a nice Saison, it is certainly a bit rough around the edges, but that just adds to the character. The balance towards rough is caused by the ample hop character that I am quite enjoying, so I definitely wouldn’t want the hops to be reduced in order to make this softer / rounder. This is definitely my type of “Americanized” Saison."
"Overall- Honestly, I am not crazy about this one. If the sage was turned down a bit I would like this better, and I generally enjoy off the wall spices in my beers. Probably won’t get this again, but will definitely continue to explore Stillwater; any brewer that specializes in saisons is fine by me."
"Hybrids are great, and this is very nice one. Very glad to have the chance to try it."
"O- Overall, I really enjoyed this farmhouse ale. I would purchase again. Recommended!"
"Overall - Nice and complex, many tastes that blend well make for an outstanding saison. I can't wait to get my hands on more from this brewery."
"Overall, another very good Saison from Stillwater that no one should hesitate from buying."
"Opening the Cellar Door reveals a depth of flavor, the mining of which delivers new notes each time. It could be dryer, but as far as American-made saisons go, this is one of the best."
"Cellar Door has carbonation and creaminess in spades. In fact, the flaw of its mouthfeel lies in having to much of these things. Swish the beer around in your mouth and it foams up, it thickens, into a slightly too-heafty beer, while the carbonation is slightly too overactive. The entire mouthfeel reminds me of Dr. Pepper in this way. Overall, this is a darn good Saison. It smells and tastes quite fresh and floral. Its brewed conventionally for the style, but manages to come across as quite traditional. This is one of the better American iterations of the Saison style."
"Pours a murky yellow. Not great, but fine for the style. Things take off from there. Spices abound--ginger in particular. Where did this come from? The label says it is brewed with sage. Perhaps it is the power of suggestion as more herbal notes flow...Rosemary, sage, coriander. There is a twang in the nose, like a sour, on-the-verge-of-spoiling flavor. I love it. It is not an acetic sour, but a sour-mash type aroma. Pale malts abound and the beer satisfies and still suggests more sips with each swallow. Hard to get enough. Aromatic herb garden aromas linger on the tongue. Definitely pick this one up if you see it."
"Drinkability is great, I'm absolutely loving this brew, the use of sage as an adjunct is a total home-run, and really plays well with the base saison."
"O: This is a really good saison, the nose is great and the flavour is similarly good. I've been wanting to try this for a while and it did not disappoint. $12 is steep for a 750, but it's worth it for this wonderful saison."
"Really enjoyed this beer, sage was subtle enough. My favorite from them so far."
"jd"
"A great tasting Farmhouse brew."
"(750ml bottle from Total Wine Tempe). Pour cloudy yellow-orange with a white head. Aroma has sage, lemon and some wheat. Taste is sweet that follows the aroma. After having Saison Du Buff I was concerned that the sage would be overpowering, but they use finesse here. Medium bodied with an oily texture. Light bitter finish. Nice job with using the sage and balancing it with the saison characteristics."
"***edit*** Holy cow that was delicious!!!! I highly recommend pairing this with steamers!"
"Overall I was a fan of this beer, though it’s fairly far from a traditional saison. Refreshing and worth a shot."
"Another winner from Stillwater, this would make for a nice table beer also."
"Aroma is mostly composed of citrus fruits, saison yeast, grainy malts, some slight funk. Earthy hops also in the nose. Flavor is has a grainy, bready malt sweetness, citrus twang, and gives way to sage (no surprise there) in the finish. Apples, pears, and bitter earthy hops throughout the flavor as well. Well balanced saision. Creamy and almost chewy on the tongue. Glad I discovered this brewery. Solid beer."
"O- This beer has a sage quality that is fresh and stronger than the other flavors but as it opens up the yeast character starts to develop around the sage and really adds some nice depth to the beer. It is too bad that is was so carbonated but it was worth the wait."
"D - Very nicely done, the spice character is subtle enough that it blends in with the yeast and adds complexity to the beer without turning it into soup. There is plenty of smooth, flavorful malt in the background to keep the spice and hop elements in check. The dry finish keeps things drinkable and the complexity makes it easy for me to finish the bottle by myself despite the somewhat excessive serving size."
"Really clean and full of complex notes. Great beer to try instead of a hoppy Pilsner on a warm evening."
"Cloudy dark yellow and burnt orange saison with a tremendous white head, lacing the glass and the beer. Aroma is unreal, pineapple, mango, tangerines and a dozen other citrusy and floral aromas. Passion fruits and candied watermelon take over the taste though the brew is not overly sweet. Slight bit of tang mixed in to keep the beer balanced. A fully realized brew, expertly crafted from top to bottom. A must try."
"Edit: Just read the label and it says it was brewed with white sage,"
"Sunshine in a glass."
"T- Flavors of clover honey, rich caramel, malt, and citric hops. The finish is bitter, herbaceous, and hoppy."
"Light orange color with decent white, foamy head that eventually turns into a film on top. Smell is powerfully full of belgian spices and with some citrus. Taste is has a strong herbal presence with spices and some pop from something that tastes reminiscent of green peppers, strangely. Also, some more citrus there. Very dry. Incredibly light bodied. I really enjoy this one on tap and in the bottle, though the tap version seems to offer more distinct flavors that set it apart and just above the bottle."
"Hazy straw out of the bottle, in the glass an opaque light amber with billowing white head. Slowly settles to a half inch. Clumps of lace left behind. Smell: wheat, hay, spicy, citrus rind. Herbal. Taste: bready with a light sweetness, grainy, peppery and herbal. A little grapefruit, lemon (more in the burp). Mouthfeel: medium bodied by way of very active carbonation. The high carbonation became a little much after a while. I think I like pairing saisons with sage-heavy dishes more than sage in the saison. Nice though."
"Poured into a pilsner glass a golden yellow, cloudy, with a finger of white head that receded quickly but left some nice lace. Very floral aroma with lots of spice: sage and pepper. Spicy taste! Very peppery with perfumy floral and herbal notes, and subtle citrus adding a bitter quality. Finishes crisp and dry, sweet with sugar and rose petals. Light mouthfeel, very crisp, and quite drinkable."
"O – Brilliant. One of the best saisons I’ve ever had."
"O- Good beer with good possibility but just fell a little short for me, but could see why other BA's would enjoy."
"Served at 53 degrees in my CL tulip. No bottle dating evident. Been waiting to try something from this brewery for quite a while. Pours a semi-hazy honey-gold with a rocky, three inch bright white head that sizzles and pops as it slowly recedes into a solid quarter inch cap embedded with tiny pinpricks. Some lacing, but no legs. Nose is herbal and grassy - sage presents up front followed by citrus and a trace of cut grass. All and all, fairly clean for a Farmhouse. Taste follows nose; however, citrus comes out initially, with the sage expressing itself more towards the finish. Something else is also happening towards the middle. I get a trace of sweetness (perhaps candi sugar?), in addition to the grassy quality. The mouthfeel on this somewhat kills it for me. Carbonation is extremely gassy. Body is light-medium and there's a definite prickliness that is partially attributable to the carbonation, as well as the citrus acidity. Finish is semi-dry. A quality and complex domestic Saison; however, the carbonation is way too assertive and really detracts from the taste. If the carbonation was more under control, I'd probably score this in the high B+ to low A- range."
"D: Moderate, it's a nice beer that is well balanced."
"O: Stillwater's Cellar Door is one of the best saison's I've consumed. It's jam packed with flavorful and perfectly balanced nuances that will bring me back to it again and again. This is a big league beer - seek it out and enjoy."
"I recommend trying this one if you have the chance, even with a high price tag. It's flavors are both appealing and sophisticated. A good place to start to try Stillwater. 25 oz bottles may be more reasonably priced if you find them."
"Will be looking for more."
"Heavy on the spice, this one is. It would probably pair well with a Thanksgiving turkey but it's a bit much to drink a whole bottle of."
"o - Overall, one of the best saisons I've ever had. My first taste of this brew was at a beer festival where beers were judged and rated...and this one got first place and was the clear standout. It was the battle of the belgians and this beer was the standout side-by-side with the classics. Keep an eye on stillwater...one of the best brewers out there. Unique and original and tasty beyond. This is one of my fav brews."
"Nice beer for spring and steal change from what I've bee drinking lately. Haven't seen this one close tomhome but wouldn't hesitate to pick it up again."
"Dirtybeerguy.com"
"Overall: This is a great saison. Definitely be picking up some more. I'm impressed by this brewery. Nice packaging too."
"D - Didn't notice the sage on first sniff so I checked the spice cabinet to see if white sage was any different than the sage in the spice rack. Next sniff was overpowering sage that never really went away. Interesting beer but and I really like the herb idea in a saison but I was sick of sage by the end of the beer."
"Poured a capped 750ml into my New Belgium globe. This beer pours a super hazy almost white yellow with a big massive 4-inch cap that leaves heavy lacing down the sides of the glass. The aroma has as nice herbal aroma up front. While I cant particularly taste sage, it reminds me of almost a basil/rosemary blend. A nice wheat tang follows with a earthy mustiness. At the very tail end of the aroma comes a nice floral pick me up. The flavor is much the same. The mustiness is a bit more prevalent then in the aroma. Nice herbal flavor but not overpower like it is in several beers. The sage is balanced with a nice floral hopping. A bit of wet grass and just a bit of aspirin. Really tasty. In my opinion, the mouthfeel of a saison is what makes or breaks the beer. You can have a saison that tastes great but finishes sweet and full and it just falls completely flat. This gets it right. It finishes nice and dry, leaving you tongue feeling like you just sucked on a piece of sandpaper. Overall, this is a fantastic saison. Glad to have another fantastic saison available in the state."
"O- A nice beer and very enjoyable. Some flavors seem to clash some, but not too much, nice complexity. I will definitely pick this up again."
"O: Judging by previous reviews, I obviously didn't like this one as much as many others on BA. However, I understand why they did and I respect that. As for me, the intense spices covered up the farmhouse element too much for my taste."
"Many thanks to finewinemike for the chance to taste this Saison. Definitely one of my favorite style beers, and I'm eager to try this one. Poured into my Duvel tulip, pours a cloudy golden color, with a rush of frothy white cloudlike foam to the top of the glass. The foam takes awhile to dissipate, and crackles down to leave a thin foam top on the beer. Awesome visual so far. Smell- lemon zest, cracked pepper, a tart fruit scent, with some really nice bready farmhouse flavors. Intense flavors. Taste- sweet bread, lemon, clove, pepper (faint), coriander. Very true to the style, love this beer. Mouthfeel- awesome carbonation, and highly drinkable. This is one of the better saisons I have had, very impressive."
"This is a great American made saison that was a bit more herbal and spicy than I would necessarily like, but it was still very enjoyable. I bet that the carbonation level and dry spicy nature would make this an amazing beer to pair with all sorts of cheese."
"Definitely pick this up. I love the mindset of this brewery and will be looking for more in the future!"
"D: I'm generally not a fan of American saisons since they tend to overuse the exotic spices and make me feel like I'm drinking perfume. This one is pretty decent, though."
"Overall, this is a very solid beer. I enjoy the combo of sage and saison. The blend is very nice."
"D: Another great Saison from Stillwater. Not quite as enjoyable as Stateside, but pretty close."
"2.5 D: I don't understand how the Stillwater saisons got hyped. This and Stateside are both pretty mediocre. Not really anything good about this other than the appearance."
"D: A good beer, but nothing amazing. Their beers are all good, but nothing so great that I would really want to stock up."
"Finish is layers of the flavor that has a strong sage finish. Quite complex, layered and appealing."
"D: it was really big on the herbal character which to me made it a little bit harder to drink but was a decent saison."
"22oz. bottle served in a Blvd. Tank 7 tulip. Bottle conditioned. Lots of carbonation. Poured a hazy pale gold with a thick, rocky white head. Citrus, yeast spice and sage in aroma. Light bodied, crisp and dry. More citrus and sage in the flavor, bit of hops as well. Very drinkable. Sage is present, but not in your face, interesting beer."
"Drinkability: I wasn't crazy about this one, poured half of it out."
"A new beer to the area, I'm excited to try some gypsy farmhouse saison. Handsome golden orange, slightly cloudy, excellent head with some life to it - very impressive and inviting. Beautiful aromas - fruity yeast, apples, dry herbal notes, slight farmhouse earth funk and nice dusty hops. Much the same represented in the flavor - nice fruityness and substance but nice dry finish. The sage is nice and balanced, adding to the compexity but not jumbled or overpowering. Fluffy and prickly mouthfeel, full and luscious, yet crisp and refreshing - damn near perfect. This makes for an excellently fun beer to drink. Lots of flavors coming at you from around the corner, in an easily enjoyable package. Very tasty - looking forward to trying their other beers."
"Blech."
"Very well made and unique. One of the best saisons I think I've ever had."
"Very drinkable. Excellent saison."
"D: Really good."
"D - Easy to drink with some nice and interesting flavors. OK job but not my fave Saison."
"Drinkability is pretty high with this one. It's light and crisp and goes down easy. Lots of complex aromas and flavors going on throughout. Has me thinking it'd be a great beer for a warmer summer day."
"D - I had a glass of this, but I wouldn't but it again. Too much spice and too bubbly for my liking. Not a bad beer, but I'm not sure why there is so my buzz for this one."
"6.6% ABV. Had a bomber poured into a tulip glass at Smith Commons in DC ($24). This wheat-based saision gave off an orangy gold and crisp appearance with a nice foam head. Smelled sweet, yet bitter. Taste was wheaty and I could pick up hints of white sage and blends of herbal grass and citrus hops. Mouthability was light and medium-bodied with good carbonation throughout. Drinkability was pleasant and would fit late spring/summer session drinking better for me."
"This beautiful blonde saison pours excitable like any good farmhouse should. It is brewed with white sage which gives it a very earthly pineapple essence kind of like the smell of a Bell's Hopslam wafting through a third level dream in Inception. Subtle yeast with a tangy carbonation that is like jumping out of bed on a warm Spring morning to welcome the sun, the breeze and the early summer pollens. It is wonderful to drink and highly recommended to a saison drinker who would like introduce this thirst-queching style to the uninitiated."
"Liked this alot. Not overly aggressive,nor alcoholic. A pretty drinkable saison."
"D: THe citrus gave me the worst beer heartburn of all time -- hugely citric without much of a funky or twangy wheat quality. I can see why people might like this, especially saison lovers as a change of pace."
"drinkability: good"
"D: This beer needs to be sipped rather slowly given the strength of the sage in the taste, although it's certainly unique so I could consider having it again."
"The soft and balanced nose is the best part of this beer, but overall it's a nice farmhouse ale - nice blend of perfumy, phenolic spicy, and citrusy elements. Would probably be a particularly tasty beer in the heat of summer."
"750 ml bottle. Served in a tulip glass, the beer pours a hazy golden/orange color with a couple inch frothy white head. Head retention is pretty good, with a small amount of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is citrus (lemon peel, tropical fruit), and peppery and herbal spice, which I assume is partly from the white sage in this beer. I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of some lime and a bit of wheat. Overall taste is citrusy and herbal. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's crisp and has high carbonation. Drinkability is good, the soft carbonation helps make this brew smooth and easy to drink. I liked this brew a lot, I'd definitely buy this again."
"D: I really enjoyed this beer. This would be a daily drinker for me in the summer. A very well crafted saison."
"This beer was one of the more remarkable beers I've tried in the past few months. Intense notes of white sage knocked my socks off. Really a fantastic flavoring. The beer only loses points for taking that taste a little bit too far. If this were a little bit more subtle, it would surely make my top 10. As is, it's fantastic and incredibly memorable."
"This is a bit more bitter than I like a saison. A lot of zing and well carbonated, would make a nice braising liquid for poultry (lemon/sage). However, my taste may have been skewed, as I had just finished a Heavy Seas Great Pumpkin, which was much sweeter and spicier by contrast. I will give it a go again if its still in Max's rotation and re-review."
"Poured a massive white head which took forever to dissipate to 1/8"". Hazy lemon merengue color looks quite lovely held up to the light. Smells like a nice Belgian beer alright. Taste has a rich and savery aspect which no doubt ties somewhat to the sage used although I can't exactly say in a blind taste test I'd have guessed sage. Overall the richness reminded me of a mild IPA, though not nearly as hoppy. Good beer, pricey but good."
"Maybe a bit too spicy to tackle a bottle solo, but a great one to share and pair with food."
"This one was well worth seeking out"
"Color is a hazy tangerine with a huge foamy white head. Looks effervescent, almost to the extent of a champagne bubble. Dissipates fairly quickly, but leaves some spotty lacing around the glass. The smell is blooming flowers, pear, slight banana, clove, hibiscus, honeysuckle, honey, and star anise. Almost smells like a mix between a belgian pale and a spiced hefeweizen. The taste is earthy grass with a slight bit of spice. There is a yeasty peppery-ness and a tiny bit of barnyard funk. Some light herb flavors also come through on the dry finish. Mouthfeel is very foamy, to the point where I need to let the beer sit in my mouth for a while to lose some of the carbonation. Fairly complex, and a decent saison, but not one of my favorites. Would prefer a few Belgian examples over this at the price point."
"I can drink beers like this pretty easily, but ultimately I think I want a little more from saisons though. It's certainly a beer I can enjoy drinking, but I'd more than likely reach for other saisons first."
"Cheers!"
"Very refreshing and easy drinking beer. Reminded me a lot of saison du buff."
"Poured from a 750 ml bottle into an oversized Pinot Noir glass. (Can I say this is one of the best looking bottle labels of all time). Huge overflowing 4 fingers of bubbly Champagne-like head. Receds fairly quickly with some ok lacing. Nice golden color. Smells peppery, herbalicious, a little like my friend Adam's apartment in Burbank, some sort of sour funk going on. Nice example of a Saison on the tongue. Citrus, pepper, earthiness and herbs. Mouthfeel is VERY Champagne-like. Crisp on my tongue and very dry. Drinkable as hell, as all Saisons should be. Looking forward to more Stillwater beers."
"Extremely delicate and openly knit head, crests at about two fingers of bleached white but dissolves faster than Carl Lewis running the 100 meters, has some lacing but this is fairly momentary too. Light yellowish color with some orange to it, looks kinda like an adjunct lager, strong beads visible within, clean hued consistently. White pepper, clove, coriander filled nose with an abundance of orange peel and blossom, a whole lot of poached apricot going on, supplemented by ripe peach, green melon and pear scents, baking glaze and pie flakes, right amount of yeastiness with mustiness, the florality remains subordinate to the spice, lavender and lilacs, more stickiness in the nostrils than lift, full and extended presence. Full-bodied, here in the mouth the carbonation able to relieve some unnecessary weight and bring tingle to the tongue. Drier feel brings the apricot back to earth, woven into the nectarine, pineapple, peach, yellow apple fruit, juicy but not possessed of tropical bite. Pepper, marjoram, sage, bay leaves there as well as something close to wasabi. The tangerine, tangelo citrus lively but dry. Too clean for substantial earthiness or yeastiness to accumulate. Cherry and a brush of honey reverberate through the finish. Can't exactly relax while sipping it, conversely not sweating you either."
"Drinkability is certainly good, though not quite as exceptional as the flavor and aroma aspects. The complexity alone makes this an eminently satisfying beer after only a glass or two, and the mouthfeel takes a bit of adjustment. This shouldn't take away from what is clearly a great beer, however."
"Wow! Fabulous beer! Look out Belgium!! This is right up there with the best. Poured with a foamy, frothy, off white head that lasts and good lace. Color is a hazy amber. Aroma is a pungent blend of yeast, malt, fruit, grass, earth, and fresh cut hay. Flavor is similar with the carbonic acid, yeast bitterness, and malty sweetness prominant. Body is perfect for this beer. Finish has the more extreme qualities dropping off quick and the more balanced and milder qualities with a slower taper to a medium length. Session beer if I got the cash on hand."
"Drinkability: It's nice to find an American made saison that's not overdone with malt, leaving it flabby and sweet; or even worse, overdone with spice or yeast character. This one shows refinement and superb balance. It's easy to drink, refreshing, and offers enough complexity and character to keep it going. Certainly worth trying."
"This is the first beer that i have had from the stillwater artisanal ale. This is a great beer. Nice pale yellow. Foamy head. Floral notes. Not overly sweet. a slight hop. Great finish. I am also not a huge fan of Saison style beers. I have been warming up to them. I tend to like the saison styles brew in the united states rather than belgium. This beer is good."
"D: A flavor profile this rich and only 6.6%? Amazing! This is my favorite Stillwater offering and one of the best saisons that I've ever had."
"D: Drinks very nicely; could go through a few of these if it were more readily available."
"Very well crafted example of the style - though still a distinctly domestic rendition considering the hop character and use of herbs."
"I believe this is another unique take on the saison/farmhouse style. Along with Saint Somewhere, I am starting to appreciate breweries that attempt to expand this style using unconventional ingredients. Case in point, this saison is very drinkable and I recommend it for anyone who may get bored with the usual versions of this style that are available."
" despite some confusion on who and what is actually brewing this stuff, it comes through as pretty damn rightous."
"Notes: Another nice serving from Stillwater, solid all around with a nice and prominent touch of Sage. Not having much of an opportunity to catch it on tap or cask around the region it is great to see the bottles around now and then."
"overall this was everything everyone told me it would be and more. a wonderful example of the style and just done right."
"A great refreshing taste and crisp mouthfeel and low ABV makes this eminently drinkable. I think Brian Strumke has hit it out of the park with this one."
"Hard pour into my tulip brings a five-finger head that eventually recedes down into a fairly constant single-finger layer, although it only leaves the tiniest bit of lacing behind. Nose brings forth a tiny amount of earth and hay along with a nice lemon presence. A little bit hoppy. Taste is quite the same with a bit of lemony grass and some slight bitterness. Mouthfeel is quite light and a bit undercarbonated. Drinks pretty well but is lacking the type of depth I expect for saisons."
"Pours a beautiful golden yellow with a few inches of silky, fluffy head. Surprisingly little lacing. Stirring aromas of fresh cut flowers, sage and crushed mint leaves stand out, with a hint of tart citrus. Slightly sour wheat flavors complement the initial wave of pale malt flavors well. These flavors provide a solid base for the herbaceous/floral notes that follow. Black pepper, white sage, fresh cut grass and grapefruity Citra hops. The citrus notes follow through the light, spritzy finish. The mouthfeel is what makes this beer truly great. Peppery and bracing on the tongue, but soft and delicate in the finish."
"Taste is a nice balance of wheat, malt, some earthy herbs and grass and hops. Has a nice crisp hoppy finish, this is one tasty saison."
"golden cloudy pour on the side of almost orange. White head that doesn't have the look of a good blonde but a hef. Not huge but sufficient. Nose of husky wheat malt and hops, mild banana and something quite dry but not clove. The white sage is quite there and leaves a nice mineral rich dryness on the tongue. Good meatiness that is misdirected by the banana quality. On the brink of american, although well placed, spiced and thoroughly hopped weissbock."
"Very good saison. The yeast notes seemed a bit dominant only because I would have liked to taste the hops a touch more. That might have to do with the age of the keg. The herbs were a nice touch; the sage stuck out well without pushing forward too much. Stillwater's saison yeast is quite good, dry with a mild barnyard note. The hops were citric but much more subtle than in the Stateside Saison, which I prefer. The beer poured hazy and light gold with a white head. The feel was appropriate for the style, not too much carbonation and fuller than the abv would suggest. The carbonation is gentle but feels like lots of small bubbles, if that makes sense. Anyway, I look forward to trying more beers from Stillwater."
"hazy burnt gold with a white head that holds well and leaves proper lace. citra hop stands out first, but a couple sniffs reveals all kinds of complexities. the tang of wheat, the husky sweetness of grain, the herbal pungency of sage, the spiciness of the yeast... just gorgeous. taste is an extremely well balanced mix of herbs and hop harmonizing with the grains and yeast. fantastic. quasi-spritzy mouthfeel that is far from prickly on a medium body with a long, hoppy/sagey finish that works very very well. another great beer from one of the most cutting edge brewers out there. just as good out of the bottle."
"D: An excellent beer. Extremely drinkable"
"A: Dark straw to light amber in color, slightly opaque, having been pulled out of a cask there is a light froth over the surface of the beer - 3.50, S: Tropical and/or citrus fruits as well as some earthy sage on the nose, floral and slightly minty - 4.25, T: Mild hop bite on the tail end of the beer, mint and green grass, maybe some candied sugar, grapefruit peel and a very mild peppery spice - 4.00, M: The texture of the beer is quite smooth and silky and provides a medium mouth feel - 4.00, D: Saisons are not normally my style but Cellar Door certainly pushes me closer to being a fan, a much gentler yet involved saison that is very drinkable - 4.00"
"Excellent beer, a very intellectual and exciting new world interpretation of an old world classic."
"On tap at Raleigh Times served in a gold rimmed Gouden Carolus tulip a slightly hazy slightly dark yellow with a frothy cream colored head that slowly diminishes to a thin layer and leaves nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is loads of spice, lemon zest and sweet malts. The taste is loads of citrus and lemon alongside a nice kick of sweet malts and spice, quite complex. The beer is very light, crisp, smooth and refreshing. This is a very enjoyable draft Saison, one I would certainly have again."
"D - not bad, but overall I didnt enjoy it very much. moderately refreshing,just not up my alley as far as Saisons go."
"Highly recommended for its drinkability."
"D- Goes down way smooth on these hot summer days. I could drink this stuff all night."
"Pouring a mildly hazy yellow, this beer has a nice white head with great retention and nice lacing. The nose is quite wonderful. The sage is prominent, featured front and center with a nice depth and complex aroma. The base saison appears as it warms up, with some honey, pepper and a little yeast. The palate opens with plenty of herbal sage character, prominent and spicy. Despite its strength, it doesn't get tiring. As it warms up, there's a very enjoyable honey and spice note that comes through on the mid-palate. Drying on the finish, this does feel creamy and just a hair over-carbonated. Sage lingers on the finish. Solid stuff, this is a beer I've had a couple of times already and one that I will continue to revisit."
"Had a draft tulip lass at Tap and Table in Emmaus, PA for $6. Overall, the beer was a bit sharp and overly spicy with peppercorns, there was a lovely sweep apricot background. So while the beer was a bit unrefined, it was still interesting and plenty tasty. Give it a shot."
"Mouthfeel is peppery, herbal, and lip smacking with some residual sweetness lingering."
"D- very nice stuff. I'm dying to pair with some food."
"Beer is medium to light in body with a nice estery / breadiness to the whole thing. Its overall smooth and light and finishes nicely. I'd be interested to try several of these beers side by side, I want a bottle of this so I can have it next to the other stateside saison."
"d - A nice saison. Some nice fruit and spice in the taste, would try again."
"This is a very solid beer, though I prefer the french oaked version. Either way, this is another solid beer from Stillwater."
