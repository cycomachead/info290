"From the bottle. It's a hazy golden pour, good head and an inviting smell. I've been going back to Le Merle for a good while. Citrus notes and subtle, frisky hops. Yum, yum. It's tastes like late summer at the ballpark."
"Overall - An interesting twist to the saison style from North Coast. The orange peel definitely takes charge and the the traditional saison elements act as a supporting cast."

"Complex and delightful with a pleasant bit of strength from abv."
""
""
""
"Tropical and herbal juice, with a fantastic peppery crisp carb."
""
"Best tasting Saison I've ever tried."
""
""
""
""
""

"Fruity, yeasty, a little too pungent for my tastes, but for the style it is very enjoyable."

"Hazy orange body with a thick, off-white head. Aromas include stone fruits, yeast, a touch of fruity hops. Apple, pear, melon, Belgian yeast strain. Moderate sweetness. More akin to a tripel than a saison. Decent, but one pour is plenty. Sweet + alcohol = limited drinkability."
""
"I always have trouble with analyzing saisons but this one is pretty simple. Very mild malt and hoppiness with a decent carbonation burn and a bit of sweetness. Very little aftertaste. Quite refreshing."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I really enjoyed this Saison. It's part of a 4 pack so I'm cellaring the rest to see what changes."
""
""
"I like this beer quite a bit and hope to be able to find it locally."

"Solid orange, fairly hazy, with an expansive puffy head that deflates to a lumpy froth.  Smell is yeasty...peppery oranges, dried flowers, spicy phenolics, and crackers.  Peppercorns, apple, lemon, honey, coriander, bubblegum, and a powdery sort of sweetness.  Fluffy bodied, crisp, and just a little tart.  Not bad, but not quite coming together for me."

"Nice dry semi-bitter taste.  Feel it after a few sips too."

"Overall (3.98) : I've only had two other Flanders' style ales, and this one takes the cake for character and flavor. I find it hard to believe it's only a 7.0% ABV, because that alcohol taste really kicks hard at the end. I am glad I picked up two, and not only one, but if I had picked up three, I may have regretted it. Okay in small doses."
"Overall,this was okay. Impression left was of a somewhat harsh Belgian saison as far as the peppercorn aspect, which is a less desirable departure from the more refreshing balance I've experienced in such styles."

"Here's a possible drink to wash down dinner. It's not cheap $(4.99 for this 375 ml bottle), so pick a good occasion to celebrate with this liquid."

"Amber colored with a lot of haze and a thin layer of white foam on top. The head clings to the sides of the glass but leaves no lacing behind. Fruity aroma mainly consisting of apple. Very sweet and not as dry as I prefer saison to be. Overall, this just wasn't very good. It was missing the funk and spice that I love about the style."
""
""
"O: a more fruity version of a saison, less dry than a bunch I have had.  I enjoyed it more than those, as the style is sometimes just a bit earthy and dry for my tastes."
""
""
"O 3.75 - enjoyable, but not something I'd get again."

"Tried about 3 years ago and realized I did not do a review. A golden, hazy, bubbly saison with tons of fruity and spicy aroma leaving the glass. My first saison and I was so intrigued by Le Merle that I named my dog after it. Truly a great saison for warm, cold or whatever weather/ time of the year."

"A solid beer. More like a BSPA brewed with saison yeast, in my book."
""
""
""
"One of the best Saisons I have had made by a US brewery.  North Coast makes some good stuff.  Aroma of light sour lemons.  Taste of Belgium yeast.  Quite nice, refreshing, would seak out again.  I really like Old Rasputin as well.  Nice to drink local beers from California.  Fresh and delish."
"Pours a light golden color with a white head and some lacing. Pours with excellent clarity from tap to snifter. The aroma has citrus as well as peach or pear juice. Nice fruity nose. The taste is earthier but still has a fruitiness. Grassy, milky citrusy hop character works with the fruit and damp hay notes. Fair bitterness, the brew finishes clean and balanced. Overall, this is a pretty decent saison, for an American version."
""
""
""
"12 oz bottle from ""Lifesource"" in Salem $3.49 Pours a slightly hazy,fine carbonated golden colour..large rocky white head. fine summer fruit aromas ,nectarine, papaya, some apricot., a little barnyard hay in the back. Nice Taste is the same but a little more spicy/peppery and floral. Nice mouth feel..very fine carbonation. Long lasting after taste from the hops I assume. A fine beer for a warm humid spring night"
""
"Pours from the bottle a clear gold with a foamy white head. A heady aroma of yeast, barnyard funk, spices and fruit. Those are all present in the taste, but there's a bit of sweetness present as well. The fruit - banana, apple, grape, some citrus - really comes through with great balance. Medium mouth, but a little chewy. Still, the carbonation gives this beer the crispness you expect from a saison. La Merle will definitely be added to my list of favorite farmhouse ales."
""
""
""
"Overall: A really good American take on a Belgian Saison. Very good mix of yeast, spice, and fruit flavors."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Great stuff. It's a very brawny and muscular saison. Not as light and drinkable as most in the style tend to be these days, but it's very complex and bold."
""
""
""
""
""
"I would recommend this for people who like hard ciders, traditional Hefes, or who want a drinkable beer that has a remarkably high alcohol content relative to the body and 'drinkability'. It's not my favorite saison ever but it's very good and I'd definitely grab a bottle if I saw it available again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I wish I liked this beer, but I'll pass on it the next time I see this in the store. I want to finish by saying that I am in NJ and this is a West Coast brewery. I think this beer suffered from being corked, as it was pretty swollen and tough to get out."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Huge fan of the North Coast brewery, and finding this was a real treat. Did not disappoint. Very good quality, and a nice rendering of the saison style. Only complaint would be the amount of the sweetness, just a little too much."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: The warm weather is headed to Boston. So happy to be enjoying this beer as the weather gets warmer. Many more if these as the weather gets better."
""
"Overall: A refreshing, easy drinking saison which I can see myself drinking in the summer. Peppery, grassy, and nicely tart. Worth a try at least once."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: one of the better Saisons I have tasted in a while. Well balanced, fruity, spicy, not too carbonated, and well balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is in many ways a model Saison. It's on the strong side, but with enough flavor to drink well. It also doesn't have that overdose of yeasty craziness that I find too often in clumsier examples. Also this is the best I've had from a brewery that does not do much for me otherwise. From the 12 oz bottle purchased at Bine & Vine in San Diego."
""
""
""
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 1/17/2014. Pours slightly cloudy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of huge lemon zest, peach, apricot, pear, apple, orange peel, straw, grass, pepper, clove, wheat, bread, light honey, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity of fruity/spicy yeast ester and moderate malt presence; and great strength. Taste of big lemon zest, peach, apricot, apple, pear, orange peel, clove, pepper, straw, grass, wheat, bread, light honey, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of lemon zest, peach, apricot, apple, pear, orange peel, clove, pepper, straw, grass, wheat, bread, light honey, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity of fruity/spicy yeast ester flavors with moderate malt sweetness; with an awesome malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with smooth, crisp, and slightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic saison! All around awesome complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast ester and malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"O: The touch of honey flavor really pulls everything together and makes this one of my favorite saisons."
""
""
""
"O - A really nice saison on the fruity side of the style."
""
""
"OVERALL: I will but this again. Very good and reasonably priced. I would say this beer is not unlike Duvel, costs less and is made in America."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A little tasty, goes down easily, good kick, not too filling, decent representation of style, it’s a solid beer but there are better choices within the style."
"O - I really liked this beer, although it is let down by the residual sweetness. Recommended"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" Oh, Damn. That is one easy sip , super complex feel and flavor with huge sour fruits, dry earthiness with wheat. Zippy, light and smooth, did i mention how complex it is?!? Seems to evaporate with a dry bite right before the finish. Clean, clean, like sparkling water, the yeast is just delightful, this one gives just about any Belgian/French saison a run for it's money in all aspects. I think I'm in love."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a tasty saison. A bit sweet, slightly out of style, but worth a try."
""
""
""
""
"If I'm going to go for a domestically made, affordable saison, I think I'd stick with Ommegang's Hennepin over this any day of the week. Simply put, this lacks the funky, rustic character than would classify anything as a saison in order to distinguish it from a strong Belgian blonde ale, which this far more resembles. Not that it's a bad thing - it's still a well made beer - it's just very mild and way too high in alcohol for it to merit practical consumption. North Coast definitely has better Belgian style offerings - this one at least could be a good introduction to someone starting to get into these types of beers."

"this is my true for saison and it is delicious beer I must say anyways there's no more of you your parents is looks like a normal amber but without clear white head that dissipates quickly the smell reminds me of fruits maybe even a slight acidic taste and then finally the taste delicious! Farmhouse funk in the beginning which Melos to tropical and normal fruits the mouth feels were really stands out here at last with you for several minutes why you can still enjoy the flavors overall I would say this is one of the best beers I've had in awhile maybe not a daily drinker though due to the complexity"
""
""
""
""
"Overall mixed on this one, I don't remember it being nearly as sweet as this and also more funky, a lot more farmhouse on the samples we had, probably another batch, but this was still pretty decent but hard to drink the whole 750ml by myself."
""
""
""
"Beautifully presented in a corked bottle with the champagne like wire trap over the top. A nice offering from the brewmasters at North Coast."

"Overal: A beer I keep going back to, especially in the summer months. It has complex flavor that can repeatedly be enjoyed. Highly recommended for a refreshing beer before or during dinner."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Not bad, but a bit bland overall. More like a just OK Belgian Tripel and along those lines it is a little one-dimensional. It's not terrible, but it's barely above average."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" I don't know if I would buy this beer again, but I am enjoying what I have in front of me."

"Overall, a really good example of the style although there is nothing that really stands out as unique. Nonetheless it is one that I would drink on a regular basis if it was cheaper."
"Overall - a flavoursome Saison.... Many underlying flavours in the base beer. Not as easy drinking as some... Is that a good or a bad thing ? :-)"
""
"O - Sure. Go ahead. Grab a few."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is as light of a Belgian I'll ever enjoy and would consider this to be the real champagne of beer."

""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Ahhh...as a saison, well I'm partial to this style, this one is very nice. Not too sweet or spicy or funky, but full bodied and very tasty. At 7.9 abv it's higher than traditional farm worker saisons by a long shot, but that's fine for today's after work ""let's have a few tasty gems"" lifestyle. Ayieee!!"
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Needs some serious work. Too simple. Run of the mill Saison. I wouldn't seek it out again."
"C-"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O) Thoroughly enjoyed this beer but note: found it closer to a traditional Belgian blonde than Saison. Another good beer from the folks at North Coast."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A great saison. Would drink again. One of my new favorites."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very solid above average Saison. Great to drink during the day while doing an activity."
""
""
""
""
"O: A very solid Saison for the price. Not very complex, but its simplicity works."
""
""
"O: Highly recommended. Would have again, and again. Very drinkable, very pleasant, very spicy."
"Overall, this is one of my favorite saisons out there. Doesn't get a lot of hype for a few reasons, its not Old Rasputin, most of North Coast's other stuff is just mediocre, and its readily available."
"A superbly balanced and complex beer. All factors meld well and compliment each other, making for a delicious late summer (or in the case early fall) adult beverage. Not too sweet, not too tart, alcohol doesn't dominate anything -- a real pleasure to drink."
""
""

"outstanding saison here. this is easily my favorite north coast beer to date. it pours a pale goldenrod color, cloudy but neat looking at the same time. a one and a half inch head rests on top and doesnt go away. the nose is great, fresh farmy yeast delivers a very organic feel, not as funky as some saisons, but refined and elegant. the yeast is the star of the show here, but there is a nice wheaty malt base and some gentle fruit flavors, golden raison, tangerine, lemongrass. its a very well balanced beer, completely devoid of any alcohol presence, despite being nearly 8% abv. it still feels like a felicate brew at that level. the feel is great, excited carbonation gives it a really bright mouthfeel. the body is medium, and really satisfyingly drinkable. at less than 6 bucks a bottle, this is one of the better beers my money has bought lately. a great late summer/early fall saison."
""
""

"One of my favorite farmhouse, strong summer ales that I have ever sampled. I really like this beer."

"Overall a very impressive saison. I'd pick this one up again."
""
""
""
""
""
"I often look for a saison that is steeped with black pepper and herbal spiciness/weirdness. This might be the opposite. But the delivery is very good. It's crisp and buttery, with most of it's flavors in the foreground... with little left underneath to ponder. These are all good and bad things depending on what you are looking for. But it fills a niche that I haven't quite seen before, and for that I commend it."
""
""
"Overall a well done saison and one I'm glad to have in our state."
"Notes: Moderate to medium in body, with a very clean mouthfeel. Great complex flavor and balance make this a very palatable brew. For the money, Le Merle is a steal, as it rivals some of its Belgian counterparts."
"The beer tastes quite strangely bitter, with a very harsh cut on the tongue. There is a nice light fruity flavor to this beer, much like the smell with spicy hints and very sour feel in the mouth and on the tongue which has got me lips puckering slightly. This is far more of a sour-ale than any other saison I have tried, reminding me more and more of a lambic ale. Carbonation and harsh bitter/sour attacks the tongue right off the bat and hides some of the more slight spicy flavors that seem to exist as ghosts in the beer. The beer leaves the tip of the tongue tingling with harsh bubbles, and thus mutes a lot of the after-flavor as well. Orange and slight pineapple are still present in the flavoring. Overall I feel like the beer sits too sweet and harsh on the tongue which kills other flavors complexity and doesn’t really make it for me. This beer has an awesome bottle and pours very lovely in a glass, but its taste and smell don’t deliver. I rank this a meh beer with an awesome bottle (I really like the bottle if you haven’t noticed…)."
""
""
""
""
""
"Whoa. This brew totally caught me off-guard, as it sat on the shelf, I almost passed it by... Glad I didn't. Highly recommended at the $7 price and for an easy summer drinker. Compares well to Great Divides Colette."
"A great domestic version of the style. Love this beer."
"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a tulip glass. This pours a clear golden color, fizzes from the bottom, short lived white head. Smells of role citrus fruit, malts. The feel is medium, high carbonation. The taste is pretty good, some Belgian esters some nice amount of malts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An easily accessible Saison, a bit on the sweet side."
""
""
"North Coast does a great job again! Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This pours a cloudy, lightly orange-golden color with a tightly laced foam top. I pick up some floral, yeasty ester aromas reminiscent of apricot and citrus flowers. Smells great. A light floral note come across with each sip. There’s a little bit of farmhouse funk and a lightly spicy finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty solid. Nice hue, giant head, and lots of lacing. Nose is mostly fermented berried. Flavor is a light bready flavor with the same light fermented fruit flavor. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."
"Pours a clear straw colored ale with a MASSIVE frothy white head. Suprisingly no lace at all. The smell is refreshing and clean. Lotsa dark fruits (plum and pear), orange, floral and light malts. The taste is a combo of malty, spicy and fruity. All competing together with a malty start, fruity middle and spicy finish. Got the burps started on me. Light hops and peppery aftertaste. Average mouthfeel. Nothing noteworthy. Overall I thought this was decent. Love the brewery but this just wasn't one of my fav's from them. +1 for the bird you can gaze at on the label while partaking....though he does look slightly in pain."
"Pretty typical Saison. Tastes almost like a Belgian pale ale. It's drinkable, but one dimensional. I wouldn't pay the price tag for another bomber of this."
"Overall a pretty tasty Saison one worth re sampling for sure."
"O: Good beer, but I like funk in my Saisons."
""
""
"fine representation of the style. when done right, I find Saisons drinkable but never overpowering. dry & refeshing... great drink to have on a warm Spring evening."
""
"Overall- Very wine-like, fruit flavors dominate. Sour, but not offensive. It's actually pretty darn good and the only gripe I have is that the flowery yeasty character I look for in a saison is hidden behind the acidic fruit flavors. Actually, I have another gripe- the carbonation is really too excessive, and kills it for me a bit - I'd consider decanting this one and pouring it back and forth between glasses to take the edge off. I'll probably pick it up again sometime to pair with dinner, although I'd pass if I was just looking for something to drink while relaxing after work."
""
"Overall, pretty good. This has a nice yeast profile but gets the alcohol level a bit too high. I think taking this down to 6-6.5% would lead to a more crisp and drinkable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. A nicely drinkable saison."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear golden color with a white head that settles to a thin cap on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain, spices, yeast, and some light fruity aromas. Taste is pretty much the same but there is also a slight soapy flavor on the finish. This beer has a light level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good saison that is tasty and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"O. A nice drinkable saison. This compares favorably to my homebrew versions, but lacks the complexity seen in the classic style reference examples like Dupont."
""
""
""
"Nice. Not that there's anything wrong with that. The unadventurous pour was a little uninspiring with its lack of foamy head, but the color was nice. ""Just like honey", as JAMC would sing. Smells nice+. Estery, but not to a fault, and a nice spice. Which spice, you ax me? I'll go with coriander, sure, coriander. Tastes of something nice, inoffensive and a lovely drink of spice and fruit. With some tingle and fruitiness in the finish. I like the bitterness too. Goes well with the banana-y-ness. I'll hit it again."
""
""
"O/D - More like a strong hefe. Not saisony but tasty. Worth a shot, but not if you're expecting something more to style."
""
"Overall a very drinkable and enjoyable beer in the aspects of a sunny day or just to quinch any thirst for a good user friendly Farmhouse that doesn't push to much funk... Cheers!"
""
""
"Another job well done by North Coast. This left me wanting nothing more than another snifter of Le Merle."
"Overall: this is a very tasty saison with a nice bit of funkiness that doesn't go over the top. I love the ridiculous creaminess as well -- I'd definitely drink this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's a nice beer. Definitely a nice showing for a saison. I would consider this a good starting point for a Belgian style ale for those interested in ale's of that type."
""
""
"Overall this is very nice. Drinkable and refreshing. Will definitely look for this again. Saison is becoming one of my favorite styles."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I like sweet, and this was one of the sweeter saisons I've had, but I felt it lacked depth and complexity."
"Again, this kind of tastes interesting enough. But it meets almost zero of the qualifications of a good Saison."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"For a saison, it seems relatively unrefined. The smell is sweet and juicy but a bit like the beer has been left in the glass too long (though I just poured it). So fruity and mildly sweet - oranges, green grapes, pineapple, lychee. The booze is quit apparent. A bit more hops might cover that up. A tiny bitterness comes right at the end, but doesn't quite make a complete finish. I wish it were a bit more dry."
""
""
"A quite nice Saison by North Coast. I'll definitely be having this one again."
"O - Pretty solid brew. Not the best Saison I've ever had but a tasty brew nonetheless"
""
""
"Overall: a tasty saison. Good spice, well balanced. Drinkability is high."
""
""
"O: The funk flavors of many sour farm beers aren't as pronounced in this clean Saison.This will never be the best Saison in the world but it's a fine offering by an always above average brewery. It's very drinkable The price isn't bad either. I plan on picking this one up again in the summer."
""
"O: Tasty, easy drinking but on the high end of booze for this style"
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazed gold with towering foamy white head. Settles in a couple of minutes to a quarter inch leaving blobs here and there. Smell: semi sweet, soft mustiness, lightly herbal, fruity. Taste: lightly herbal, peppery, lemon peel, pineapple aftertaste. Wheat. Fluffy feel, medium body, fades out leaving a grainy and herbal last impression. Fairly standard but enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a decent beer but a bit pale and light for my tastes. tastefully done but not entirely intense."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Great beer. A nice introduction to the Saison, albeit a very high alcohol one. Worthy try for Stella drinkers looking to break out of the box. Wonderfully quenching. Perfect lunch time beer."
"I’m passed on this offering for years, something about a cage and cork that just screams “buy me, but I’ll suck.” Add in I wasn’t blown away by some of their other lighter offerings and my expectations were reserved to say the least. Thankfully this is a very decent example of the style. A bit over priced, would be better at about 6 a bottle (current price is about 22 for a 6 pack which seems insane for this). Worth a try but tap I think may be the better choice."
"O - This is great saison! The nose certainly doesn't do a good job of forewarning what the taste has in store for you. I would recommend you try this if you get the chance."
"O - Definitely stands out. Doesn't seem like a very traditional representation if the style. A bit too fruity to be great, but still enjoyable."
"Also, for $7.99 for a 750 mL....it's an unbelievable value."
"D: Fresh and full of flavour at the brewpub... went well with the rockfish. The saison style is somewhat open to interpretation, and while I liked it, it just wasn't stellar IMHO."
"Decent saison notes, but another argument in favour of capping saison ABV at 6%. The booze warmth just overrides the otherwise really pleasant saisony notes and they should be allowed to speak for themselves."
"This is a great saison that is absolutely worth a try. It is a nice, almost classic, example which has a sweet, phenolic, slightly fruity taste. The yeast character is interesting enough to accent the hop and malt/sugar accents."
"O - This is a very nice saison. Another very good brew from North Coast."
"O - a very nice saison."
"A golden straw colored body with an ever rising stream of bubbles from the bottom of the tulip glass. These bubbles fuel a massive three-inch head of fluffy, foamy white bubbles that hang around for quite some time. Smells of funky yeast, straw, hay, some zesty citrus, and a bit of light fruit (apple, pear). Taste is of yeast, grain, straw, some tart pear, and a bit of apple. Finishes a touch dry, but not sticky or unpleasant. Overall, a very good saison that I'll gladly split with the girl when she's willing to share."
"I'm not the biggest fan of the saison style, but this is one of the few that I really liked. Lots of fruit and plenty of sweetness that others in the style often times lack. Very drinkable and enjoyable."
"Keep on reaching for the stars, North Coast. I mean it."
"From North Coast, I expected better - almost akin to a giant pilsner with Belgian yeast."
"O - a very enjoyable saison that is more much Belgian than American; good stuff"
"Taste-Tangy, spicy, spiced pears, refreshing and quaffable for the strength. Mouthfeel and character fade a bit as it warms, leaving a low carbonated muddle. Doesn't have the high carbonated staying power of a lot of other Saisons. That being said, Le Merle is a pretty good American offering of a farmhouse ale."
"O: A decent saison but too boozy in the finish."
"This was a good purchase."
"Pours a glowing orange body with a bright white head forming thick and flowing with a dimpled head. Fine bands of chunky lacing layer in this head, very nice look to it. Aroma has big ripe layers of tropical fruit flowing throughout each sniff, spicy black pepper in the background gets dusted on. I'm getting mango, pineapple, with a mild citrus note flowing pretty amazing levels of fruit move into my senses. Spicy Belgian yeast notes adds another layer, I've never seen this beer in person only on the internet, a case as recently landed in Steubenville, OH and I'm jumpin' on it. Flavor has tropical fruit bursts with a layer of spicy dry yeast cakes, this is an amazingly big juicy fruit spiked with mango pineapple and other tropical fruits. Spicy Belgian yeast flares it's flavor with hints of black pepper spiciness, pretty intense and complex Saison a bit bigger than traditional versions almost 8%. Really coats the palate and the carbonation level is kicking quite nicely, what a robust Saison, usually when brewed in a more Belgian style the effervescence is incredible and the body is rather light or airy compared to this. I'm not going down a cloying road just a more rounded malt body with less airy carbonation with a bit more alcohol involvement than I'm used to within this style It mirrors as a light triple versus a big saison. Overall quality and enjoyment level is high I'm glad I randomly ran into this beer close to home."
"cheers."
"O - Light and relatively easy to drink, although it's a bit dry and sour for my taste."
"O-good saison a little overpriced and not a top tier saison especially at the price point wont buy this in the bottle but will have it on tap again when i see it..its worth a try as it is a goos saison"
"Cracked a 750ml of this guy on a friday afternoon, great weather accompanied by some really tasty brew. Right off the bat it had a nice rich golden yellow color and a nose full of orange rind. I enjoyed the beer, great summer brew, but the finish was a little and I do mean a little unsatisfying for me. The second time I tasted Le merle, (which has an awesome story and bottle art), just wasn't as memorable as the first time. Definitely worth purchasing though, a really tasty and well crafted take on a saison."
"O: Maybe because it's pissing rain and cold at the end of June, but the beer just is not doing it for me today. certainly not without it's merit, but perhaps if going with North Coast today should of had an Rasputin."
"Overall one of my all time favorites creamy mouthful, complex and highly drinkable! Love it."
"Overall this is a solid saison. It's not overwhelming, but it performs pretty well. A very good example of the style."
"Not bad overall, on the sweet side for my liking, as mentioned before, but doable."
"The beer has a pretty high ABV too, nearly reaching 8%. So taking your time with a big bottle might be your best bet. The beer is good… not great, but very good. However I fear a beer like this won’t be very memorable. Taste is too complex to really explain, and since it’s such a new brew not sure I would even remember what it’s called unless staring at the bottle."
"While drinking this, all I could think about (in terms of reviewing) was how much this tastes like Pranqster. There's a big, spicy phenol note after a lighter barley note. The deeper herbal and earthy flavors are missing, like you might find in something from Fantome. The beer is also force carbonated, which makes the beer feel heavier. It's in line with tasty takes on the style from American brewers, but it can't quite stand up to Belgian saisons."
"Crisp and sharp carbonation, medium-low body and a dry finish. Really suits the style well."
"A decent saison with the right flavours but it lacks a bit of X factors with the flavours not quite hitting all the high notes of a Saison Dupont or Bridge Road Chevalier Saison."
"Decent beer overall and fairly representative of the saison style. It lacks some complexity, but overall it's a pretty good beer. I might drink it again. Not a bad choice for fans of the style."
"This brew pours a hazy golden hue with decent carbonation that leaves behind a two finger head and little lacing,the smell is honey,alcohol,fruity bread and raisins soaked in honey,it has a medium bodied well carbonated dry mouthfeel and has tastes of fruity floral esters,bready malts,raisins soaked in honey and finished with a citrus hopppy dryness and overall nice but was expecting more cheers."
"Overall – I really enjoyed this beer and would have it again for sure. The taste was well balanced and I made it though the bomber quicker than I had anticipated."
"Overall: Would recommend but not necessarily over other Saisons since I don't have that much experience with them. Am definitely eager to explore the style further especially with the Stateside Saison from Stillwater. Next time..."
"O - Quite a clean Saison. Not bad but not especially interesting either."
"Popped the cork with and poured into a snifter. The color is a really nice orange copper color. The head is nice at first then it settles down to a thinner white layer. The lacing is sparse. The smell is a little spicy with some wheat and just a very light aroma of funk. The taste is a little boozy with some spice and some grapes in there. The mouthfeel is bubbly and a little creamy. Not a bad brew. Pretty decent stuff for a saison."
"Le Merle was pale gold in color with good clarity on the initial pour, but hazy for the rest of the bottle. It had a tall, foamy, white head with good retention and lacing. The smell was yeast, spices, and fruit. The taste was pale malt, peppery spice, and some bitterness. The finish was dry and lightly bitter with a bit more peppery spice and touch of aspirin. The mouthfeel was good with a medium body and medium carbonation. Overall Le Merle is a good beer and worth a try."
"Overall good but not great."
"O/D - Easy drinking saison. Manageable ABV. Not to funky for those looking to get into the style. A bit over carbonated for me, comes off as overly filling."
"Pours a hazy golden orange color with visible carbonation. Upon the pour into my tulip glass I noticed a 1.5 inch white head. I believe my glass may have caused the head to recede a bit quickly. The smell has notes of fruit and wheat with a little bit of funk. As I taste the beer the first thing to hit my tongue is the sweetness of the fruit flavors and the spicyness, as it crests my tongue I get a nice dose of spicyness. This beer was a bit thicker than I expected, but the excited carbonation lifts it off the tongue, giving it a light and refreshing feel. Overall, I am quite impressed with this beer, I think I may have found a new favorite summer style. This beer has inspired me to buy a few more saisons and give them a try. The only drawback to this beer is the high price point and the high ABV, I would mug prefer something in the 4 or 5% range to make it a little more sessionable. This is such a great beer, I would prefer to be able to drink it all day."
"Though I've only had two Saisons, this one holds a place as my standard of the style and aside from all the technicalities, this was simply a wonderfully pleasurable beer. Major props to North Coast."
"Overall I am not sure what to call this style but it was definitely unique to say the least. Really quite nice and a classic for me."
"This beer poured out a cloudy amber with a finger of head that quickly dissipated. There's a nice nose consisting of mild hop bitterness, yeast, and a very slight sour straw-like note at the end that adds some depth. The taste is surprisingly sweet, but not cloyingly so, probably due to the nice tang at the end that echoes the slight sour straw in the nose. The mouthfeel is light, and refreshing. This is a pretty tasty brew, very enjoyable."
"Overall - I must be drinking the North Coast cool-aid, but I can't imagine someone not liking this beer. I suppose if you aren't a fan of the style.. but this is an exceptional belgian style beer in my opinion. This is EXACTLY what I think of when I think of Saison.. might be better to say, this is what I dream about when I think of Saison."
"D: This was a very delicate but flavorful beer. It was like a Belgian IPA, with lots of bitterness but not much funk or tartness. Really tasty though, and nice body too. The alcohol was well hidden also, so it was easy to drink. Recommended."
"O: This is perfect for warm weather and goes down easily for its strength."
"O: The beer is very easy to drink and refreshing. It is a good representation of the style."
"Although not as complex in the nose and flavor as some other saisons, this is a very tasty and drinkable example of the style, and I'm quite happy that I got the chance to try it. Not my favorite saison, but definitely a good one."
"Pours light wheat color with white head that stays put for a while, plentiful carbination. Nice aroma, Belgian hops. It seemed a little too carbinated at first, but after a few sips I really started to enjoy it more. Very light tasting and the alcohol is well hidden."
"Poured into a tulip glass. Nice rich golden, hazy with medium carbonation. Big white head that stays awhile. The notes are of grassy hops, fresh plain yogurt, and Belgian candi sugar. The flavor is very tart and a bit too funky for my tastes, not that it is completely off style, but it more resembles a sour ale than farmhouse. The appearance is great, but after that not much else is working."
"Overall I would buy this saison again and it has encouraged me to explore the style further."
"Served from champagne bottle into pilsner glass at refrigerator glass. Colour is hazy golden. Pours with one-finger of head which quickly dissipates to a lingering skin of head. The aroma is more reminiscent of an adventurous wheat beer than a saison in that there is little of that 'funky' aroma that one might expect- although it is more present in the flavour. The flavour is also characterized by a subtle mix of clove, light malt, and well-balanced hops- much like a blend of American and German wheat. This is highly drinkable and probably a safe foray into a saison, if not the best example of the style (it could be more funky or farmhouse). But, I say, style expectations be damned and I'll be drinking this one again..."
"Get ready to belch...alot! This is a fruit filled Saison that I wish wasn't bombarded with fizzy carbonation, because it had so much potential. The carbonation really hurts the flavors and the overall enjoyment of drinking this beer."
"Pours a murky, somewhat-dark golden orange color with a LARGE frothy white head that doesn't appear to be shrinking down anytime soon. Scent is very spicy with some strong Belgian yeast aromas and hints of citrus. (When the hell is this head gonna shrink??? I wanna drink this thing!) A bit of funkiness and barnyard aromas as well. Now for the taste... The taste is just as it smells but with a lot more fruitiness and citrus flavors. The strong fruit flavors blend well with the light funk, strong yeasty flavors, and spiciness. There are also some bread-like notes in the taste. Mouthfeel is very dry and crisp, with a spicy finish. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is not the best example of this style, but it's still pretty darn tasty. Not a bad price either."
"overall it was pretty drinkable but I am not overly excited to have another one."
"Opinion: This is a decent beer. From my perspective, it leaves a lot to be desired if you hold it up to even just decent examples of the style. It is pretty good beer all by itself, but put it next anything DuPont and it will shrink in comparison. I don't recall if this beer was stupid cheap or anything that would justify the fact that it is pretty far off from classic examples of the style. If it is half the price, give it a shot as it isn't infected or anything. Otherwise, I would stick to other more highly rated Saisons."
"O: An enjoyable beer from one of my favorite styles. It has a ton of potential but tastes a bit young. A year or two could do this one some justice."
"O - I am surprised how good this is. I guess I shouldn't be, as North Coast makes several high quality brews."
"YES! This was a great Saison. I am have been on a bit of a Saison trip and this won was a total WIN! The yeast really did shine on this one and brought some great esters and spice. There was a little bit of that Belgium funk, which I really loved in this beer. I don't know if I would recommend this as an ""intro to craft beer"" type of thing, as I feel it was a bit on the complex side, but for sure something that anyone with a preference to Belgium beers should try."
"750 ml corked cottled, as North Coast Le Merle Saison (Belgian Style Farmhouse Ale), courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 7.9%. Slightly hazy golden colour, huge white head. Sweetish aroma of syrup, farmhouse yeast and rotting fruits / stale berries. High level of carbonation in the mouth. The flavour is better than the aroma, medium sweet and moderately spicy, decent hops in the finish. Quite nice to drink, should also go well with many foods."
"A nice, ramped up saison - all the grain, yeast, and fruit, with a slight elevated booze warming. What's not to love, especially from this summer-forlorn winter denizen?"
"D: Not a particularly challenging saison, but true to style if not great for the style. Goes down alright. At 9 bucks for the bomber, a pretty good value saison, but it has nothing on the stars of this style."
"Overall an ok saison, but not as satisfying as other options."
"Looks appetizing in the glass, a straw colored, highly carbonated brew. Decent sized white head with nice tiny bubble structure. The smell and taste of this beer immediately reminded me of strawberries. Sweet, slightly tart Saison yeast. Really delicious, really refreshing. Mouthfeel is thin and carbonic/acidic. Drinkability is high I really liked this beer and would gladlly drink again. I am curious to know the difference between this aged bottle and a freshly brewed one."
"Pours a bright yellow with a good fluffy head that fades but doesn't leave much lace. The aroma is floral and spicy lightly soapy with some bready yeastiness. The flavor is spicy with some nice bright hoppiness mildly bready with a hint of banana and lemon zest."
"Overall, was not impressed. I think the carbonation would have made a big difference, but this still tasted alot like a bad hard cider."
"Pours a deep golden orange with no froth and light lacing. Smells like oranges and grapefruit. Tastes tangy with sour/bitters hanging on the back of my tongue. Mouthfeel is bubbly with smooth swallow. Good i would drink again, really like the grapefruit taste."
"jd"
"i really like this beer i think that is a very representative portion of the saison family and i enjoyed every aspect of the beer. The color is absolutly my most favorite part of this brew.. its head retention is inciedble and the white head and that malty body is something i will come bcak to to enjoy every time. Slanch."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass (all we had available at the time). The beer pours a cloudy copper-orange coloring, with some amber highlights in the deep parts. No head. The beer has smells that seem to bounce between a sour and a barleywine. There are some very sweet notes, almost citrusy, as well as some sour aromas. The beer has an initial flavor of light spice, grapes, and alcohol that blossoms into a wide tongue sour taste, with a malty backbone, that fills the mouth. The bold sour flavors carry through to the aftertaste. The beer remains light in mouth, despite the powerful flavors. The finish is sudden, and rather abrupt after the developing nature of the flavor. It quickly retreats, leaving the slightly sour aftertaste in mouth, begging for another sip. Surprisingly easy to drink, likely due to the flavors blending so well."
"This saison pours a very deep orange honey color. Much darker than your typical saison, also has a bit of viscosity to it which i don't usually find. There is a large fluffy white head that is very thick and recedes slowly, leaving behind minimal lacing. The aroma is very light and delicate. Very pretty floral components, a touch of hop citrus and some grapefruit zest on the nose. The flavors are very well blended together, and i get a lot of floral citrus flavors. The draw back is that it is not light at all on the body. Really viscous and oily body. There is also a bitter citrus pith component that makes this fall off a bit. After the bitterness comes some oily hop residue that doesnt follow the traditional saison. This is good for a fall style however. Mouthfeel is oily and viscous. Medium to heavy bodied and totally palate coating. Drinkability is nice and this really is a food friendly beer. This would do great with a chicken dish or even a lighter style german pork schnitzel dish with lemons. Not your typical saison, but a good value and worth a shot."
"Alcohol was well-hidden and this brew was quite drinkable, especially after it warmed up a bit."
"D: I could definitely see myself quaffing one or two of these after working the fields of Flanders!"
"ok drinkability here...prob wouldn't want to enjoy but just one of these..."
"D: Goes down smoothly and is delicious."
"My wife brought this home from a bottle shop. Have had this a few times, including at the brewery on draft but this is the first time reviewing it. Very cloudy with a light yellow/orange hue. Short head that goes away quickly. Taste is crisp with a nice yeasty bite to it. Light hints of lemon & other spices. Good carbonation adds to the crisp flavor. Essentially, a mellow, tasty saison with strong yeast flavors and light on the hops."
"D-this is a little muddled and simple, not bad and easily drinken. Nothing special and a little sweet in the flavor."
"D: A very drinkable saison. Would drink it again if I saw it."
"D - I am loving this style more and more each time I try different kinds. This one is up there as a good sure thing Saison. Refreshing, crisp and clean."
"O - The price is the only thing standing in the way of this being a great everyday beer. If this came in 4-packs and was priced slightly lower I could see it moving faster."
"This is a very good saison! It is fairly subdued but full of flavor."
"Overall this is a very nice saison, and another winner from North Coast. Seek it out."
"A ""Belgian Style Farmhouse Ale", I drank with chips and dip before dinner. I'm not sure what technically makes a beer ""Belgian Style", but at the first taste I was reminded of some of the beers I had during my last trip to Belgium. It was very good, with a cork top like a champagne bottle."
"Medium body and well carbonated. Very drinkable. True to the style. This could be tweaked into a very nice saison."
"D: This is a rather lackluster beer. North Coast gets a lot of notoriety because of Old Rasputin and Old Stock, but I've found most of their other beers to be mediocre."
"Drink: For the price, it hits the spot (though I prefer Saison Dupont which is similar in price). Very nice effort from North Coast, with a bit of fine tuning (and a bottle date so I can cellar it and know when to pull) I would be interested in grabbing one more often. Still, this is my 3rd or 4th try so maybe I'm almost hooked already."
"This beer is very drinkable, well hidden alcohol and paired nicely with rosemary, fingerling potatoes and lamb. I really enjoyed this beer and I can see myself heading for more saisons like this in the future."
"Overall, a tasty beer worth the try. I was looking for refreshment with this one though and didn't quite find it. I would love another with a full flavored meal, I bet it would really pop."
"Mouth feel was very carbonated. Alcohol was hidden and this beer is very easy to drink."
"D: Good everyday drinker."
"You can tell some care went into this brew. It's a Saison with a purpose in mind."
"Pretty drinkable, but just not my type of thing."
"Flavor follows with a subtle spice character. Nice but not overwhelming on the senses. Finish is pleasant and of moderate depth. An enjoyable saison that doesn't offer the depth of a great Belgian Saison but is nonetheless a beer worth seeking out. A rather dry saison that I hope to see more of, and better than the tap version."
"A spicy, citrusy, earthy taste. Very strong and bold flavours. Wow, not for the feint of heart. Medium bodied with plenty of carbonation, as you've probably already gathered. All in all, a very nice saison. Yeah, I'd definitely buy this again, and maybe let it warm up a few more degrees before popping the cork."
"D - Nice Saison, complex flavors, but a little too much sour for me to keep it nice and refreshing."
"D: Tastes a lot like a tripel. Not a bad beer at all, and one of the better saison's I've had, but this has a lot of fruity and spicy sweetness to it, more akin to a tripel. I was expecting a little more funk, and there is hardly any. Still, highly drinkable and delicious."
"Sampled this at Savor 2010. Poured a hazy yellow-gold hue, with a finger of white, decent retention, and good lacing. Very citrusy in the nose, with orange, lemon, and apricot, and a little spicy (coriander). The taste was a nice blend of spicy citrus, with nothing really standing out as overpowering. Slightly spicy in the finish, with very little hint of the alcohol content. Very lightly carbonated; smooth and light on the palate. Overall a serviceable and somewhat sessionable golden ale."
"Pairing: Herb-roasted quail with pear and caramelized onion"
"D: Absolutely outstanding. First of the style for me, but it reminds me of Duvel. It could use some time to mellow out though and I'd like to try it again with the yeast sediment mixed in/"
"Overall, a good beer but too light in flavor for me."
"Taste was very good, light malty taste in the background with straw upfront. However, my bottle had a fair amount of carbonation. Definately a drinkable beer and could have another right now!"
"A mild but pretty tasty saison. Certainly worth giving it a try."
"Murky old gold pour has a floral scent mixed with Belgian sugars and some passion fruits. Taste is nice and sharp, champagne mixed with light fruits and sugar. Has nice thick mouthfeel where other lesser saisons feel a little watery. Very well-crafted brew that finished dry with a touch of watermelon. Definitely a must-try for any saison lover. one of the better domestic saisons."
"Overall...pretty, pretty good. On par with any of the other american attempts at the belgian farmhouse style."
"(D)- A good Saison. Has a crisp and refreshing feel to it with some good flavors typical of the style. Not the best I have had, but it was still enjoyable and easy to consume except for the ridiculously high carbonation level."
"Overall, another wonderful beer from North Coast. everything is well balanced and easy drinking, without sacrificing complexity. I will definitely buy this again."
"Mouth feel is medium body with good carbonation, dry finish"
"D: Yes (but only in the summer)! This beer is nice, bright and crisp (see supra), a great summer sud. I don't think I'd like it if the weather were below 70 degrees, as it's too sharp a little sharp on the taste buds."
"Bought the pint at BevMo. Has a yellow golden hue to it, cloudy and pale in color. Smell has notes of fruit and yeast, similar aroma to a common Belgian ale. Real nice, refreshing, drinkable with warm weather. Tastes a bit sweet with hints of Belgian yeast. A good beer from a great Brewing company."
"D: A highly drinkable saison."
"Sampled at the Brattleboro, Vermont Brewers Festival on May 22, 2010. The pour is a hazy, cloudy yellow with about three inches of foamy head that takes a few minutes to settle down. Yeast and wheat are evident in the aroma so it smells like it should. The taste is also full of wheat and yeast notes. Not all that bad but some US-brewed Belgian style ales are better."
"D: Light, refreshing and a little bittersweet. A bit more hops that what I normally consider in a saison, but I think that adheres more to the original style. Would make a nice pairing with a fruit cocktail or some type of fruit salad."
"It would be good chilled on a warm summer day but overall it just doesn't do it for me. Not that there are any bad flavors present, the ones that are there just don't come together in a very interesting or exciting way"
"As a rule, the best saisons come from Belgium. Naturally, there are exceptions to every rule. Still, this is suspiciously good - if it were a drawing I'd swear that the Americans traced it! Exception or not, I don't recall the last time I had a saison (Belgian or otherwise) that I enjoyed quite as much as this. This is ""American Art"" indeed, North Coast."
"Pours a five+ finger thick, off-white head that takes forever to fade, leaving some lace. Hazy amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Light peach nose. Flavor is sweet peach and yeast. Imagine that a sweet saison! $9.20 for a 750ml caged & corked bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"This marks my first Saison and it has left me more than satisfied. Rich, flavourful, and very easy to drink, I think this one was definitely worth its higher price tag. I can't wait to try their Old Rasputin which I've got lined up next."
"D: the beer is a decent offering from north coast that really holds belgian characteristics on the taste. Good beer for a hot summer day."
"Flavor is a great cross of fruity notes and hops. Making it quite different from ales and lagers. For me, I am looking for a nice chilled lemony flavor that is going to make me feel like spring."
"Overall, another fine beer from a brewery who, perhaps, doesn't get all the love they deserve. You should try this ASAP."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a light, airy amount of carbonation."
"I will finish with, its very carbonated and will probably be a forgettable brew to me."
"While not being the beer I would ideally drink when I reach for a Saison, Le Merle drinks quite well. Very enjoyable and extremely easy to drink. This is one I would recommend as it is worth a look, it just would not be the first one I reach for."
"Overall, a solid saison and represents the style well. Fairly drinkable and I really like this one. I let this one sit in the cellar for almost a year and it turned out nicely."
"Fuller bodied than expected with some soft carbonation up front the fades into a slightly tart earthy flavor mid palate. There is a nice amount of zesty peppey spice with maybe some clove? I'm also picking up some flora(petal) notes that blend very well with the crisp light fruit notes. Hints of banana, apple, pear and apricot. Sweet, spicy slightly dry and somewhat tart with a clean finish. The alcohol flavor is present but overall the high ABV is excellently masked, making this beer dangerously drinkable. I had to stop myself from pounding the glass. Complex and very tasty. Recommended!"
"Drinkability- Despite all the flaws I mentioned earlier, this is a worthy effort of a tough style. I would recommend you try it. Maybe I got a bad bottle. Maybe the brewer is still dialing in the recipe. Despite my disappointment with this particular bottle,, I WILL try it again, because I taste some real possibilities in this beer."
"Notes: Sure enough, it may not be an icon for the style. But it is a great brew to share and socialize around, opens up a great craft conversation and more often than not works very well. One to keep around and pop up in a receptive group. The taste is rich enough to be meaningful, presentation and appearance work very well, and it is rather drinkable even for those unaccustomed to these brews."
"D pretty good, but not great. i would probably not have two, but its worth the price for one."
"This beer is very carbonated and practically foams in my mouth. I'm glad i choose to use the Duvel tulip to knock some of it out of solution as it's sitting here. Besides that it's pretty light on the tongue and good drinkability. I haven't had that many examples of the style but this one just had something a little off in the taste."
"Overall - Decent beer, I liked it but something felt a little off. The yeast seemed a little strange??? I'm not sure. Decent job though."
"I found this to be a very drinkable beer, putting me in mind of a warm summer day and gentle breezes. For its delicacy, it's richly complex. I'd definitely buy again and share with friends on some idyllic sunny day."
"Very good drinkability, this beer would be terrific on a warm summer's night."
"D - I like it, I can do the bottle at least. :)"
"This is the first serious Saison I've had, I'm really into the style. I'd definitely look for this one again."
"I believe this saison came from BBrianBoogie - thanks man."
"Just too sweet and thick when I look for more light and springy. Certainly not a bad beer and the nose is fantastic - just not in the elite for me."
"D: Would buy again, very nice Saison, but more fruity than most others I've had of this type."
"D: Le Merle is ""le merde"" (in a good way). I could drink this one all day."
"Pale yellow color, with a huge soft head. The beer is slightly cloudy, but you can see the bubbles rushing through, and the bubbles at top burst, leaving giant caverns in the head. The smell is primarily strawberries, a little overripe, smells of grapeskins, really bready yeasty smells, a bit of herbal, spicy smells - clove, with a hint of lemon and acid. The taste is incredibly grainy, like slightly cooked grains, still a bit raw. The taste is very spicy, peppercorns and lemon, a bit of grassiness. There's a bit of yeasty tartness and bite, with a slight breadiness in the background. Reminds me a bit of a granny smith apple - there's a note of sweetness, but the tartness of the skin kind of dominates. It finishes very dry and fruity. The spiciness becomes a bit too harsh at points, but still nice. The body is quite light, and the carbonation adds to the airiness, and creates quite a bite. Finishes very dry, pushing the limits of dryness and lightness, but I found that as it warmed, it became a quite enjoyable beer."
"D: This was my first Saison and I have to say I liked it. Can wait to try a few different breweries."
"I'm not a big fan of the bitter taste left in the mouth... but it's still plenty drinkable. A definitely above-average ale, but not the best."
"Pretty good brew. My standard is Dupont Saison and so while this beer is a nice attempt, it's a little too malty sweet. But, not bad. Poured with an excellent foamy, frothy, off white head and lots of lace. Aroma was very nice as well: malty, yeasty, and a hint of lemon. Body is very good, perhaps a touch malty heavy. Finish is nice with a malty, yeasty, lemony quality. Session beer? perhaps."
"Drinks fairly easy, a good saison that really opened up as this warmed"
"D - Very good saison and abv is pretty well hidden which makes you want it more."
"Pours a pale yellow orange with dense fluffy cloud-like white head that recedes slowly but never completely fades. A multitude of bubbles flow perpetual from the bottle of the goblet. A bit of yeast and some zesty fruit aromas float patiently to the nose. A slight yeast funkiness may be present, but it might be that I'm looking for it. Anyway, on to the taste. Grainy and yeasty with a spicy layer on the outside and some sourness penetrating toward the end. More lively fruits exist. Goes down dry, with little alcohol noticed. Very drinkable and not too barny (new word I just made up) as some Saisons tend to be. Love this one, and am developing a palate for the Saisons. I never thought that would happen."
"North Coast really impressed me with this release. I don't know why I had reservations. I don't think I've been disappointed in any of their beer. This one really is a nice take on a Belgian style. I think if it had a little more body and the flavor were just a tad stronger, it'd be right there with the top Belgian Saisons. It really isn't far off at all. Impressive stuff. Check it out if you have the opportunity."
"Impressive. Very impressive NCBC. You surpassed my expectations on this one indeed. Thanks to ""kstrickler"" for an excellent trade and the higlight of our trade to date. I have been wanting to try this one for awhile now. I do have NCBC in my area, but have never seen La Merle."
"It is dry and crisp, yet somewhat creamy, with little sweetness and just a touch of bitter. Overall, I quite enjoyed it and drinkability is very high for an 8%'er."
"Drinkability is high here because it all works together well, and this would be a good higher alcohol summer beer..."
"This is very well-balanced and easy drinking. Along with the 7.9%abv, which is only lightly noticed, this is quite drinkable."
"D. Very drinkable. Not the best I have had, but still pretty damng good beer. I must be a sucker for Saisons."
"There's a nice creamy smoothness with a bit of crispness in a medium body with moderate carbonation."
"A pretty solid saison. Much more delicate than most. It lacks that blast of fruity, spicy, tart yeast character that the really great ones have. Maybe a good jumping off point for those new to the style."
"Again, this is my first experience with the saison style. I will be returning to sample more beers of this style. Thanks to North Coast for a beer like Le Merle. Truly enjoyable."
"D: Le Merle really complemented every aspect of the meal I was enjoying (creamy cauliflower soup with truffles, pappardelle pasta with pork marinara and smoked bacon, cheese plate including ricotta with honey, aged white cheddar and herb goat cheese). a very good saison, though I am a novice to the style so my sample for comparison is relatively small. given that small sample, this brew was exactly what I was expecting and it did not disappoint."
"All in all, this is a very solid saison that is reasonably priced considering its origin and my location. I would buy this again."
"Pours a hazy, golden color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Great retention and decent lacing. Smells of tart malt, yeast, citrus, acid, and sweet spice. Fits the style of a Saison / Farmhouse Ale. Mouth feel is crisp and sharp with a high carbonation level. Tastes of tart malt, yeast, citrus (banana), slight sweet malt, slight hop, and slight alcohol (which becomes stronger as it warms). Overall, this is exactly what I think of when I think Saison - I highly recommend."
"Overall a very nice, round, drinkable beer, but nothing special."
"This is a competent, delicious Saison, and aside from the scenery, probably the highlight of my stop at FT Bragg/North Coast."
"Very good mouthfeel and very good drinkability. Really reminds me of drinking champagne and also a dry chardonay."
"D: This is a superb saison! I love dupont, but I'm having an affair with Le Merle. A must try for saison lovers."
"One of the best domestic saisons I have tried. Not quite the dry crispness and phenolic impressions on the finish that a Fantome Printemps has."
"D - An excellently drinkable and complex brew that suffers only at the hands of its own mild and delicate nature. A word of advice: don't attempt to pair this one with a steak, a cigar, or a night of IPA pounding. This one deserves a fresh palate and an open mind, but at the $5 I paid for the 750 ml bottle one could be forgiven for experimenting."
"D - Really good farmhouse ale with lots of complexities. Fruity and fresh with a great aroma to boot!"
"Gunsmoke after opening caged bottled. One finger creamy white head over golden orange body, a bit of haze, clear once it warms up. The etching at the bottom of the Chimay chalice threw a nice geyser of effervescence, pretty to look at. Pretty spicy nose, white pepper, coriander, balanced with a fairly big citrus presence, lemony goodness. The taste brings the lemon and pepper to the forefront, with a complex citrus character, lemon, pineapple, mango, not as lemony as Dupont. Hops are noticeable but pushed to the background. Lingering dry finish. A bit sweet, pretty close to tripel in style, but certainly a nice quaffer for a hot summer afternoon."
"Cork comes with a huge pop, lots of co2 coming out of the bottle. Sounded like a champage cork being popped. Very cloudy, deep golden, huge massive pillowey head. Retains very well. Lacing spiders around the glass throughout. Smell is adequate if unimpressive, on the slightly musty side as opposed to full blown horse blanket. Taste... this is a very busy saison. It's on the fuller and heavier side as opposed to the lighter and delicate side. Almost like Golden Monkey is to the standard tripel. At first the spicing is a little overpowering, but towards the end it melds quite nicely. A bit of warming booziness. Vivid mouthfeel, really stands out and lingers with the carbonation, almost overly so, but it lingers pleasantly on the palate. An hour easily saw me putting the bottle away. An interesting take on the style."
"Edit: After the beer looses its carbonation a bit, the mouthfeel and aggressive textures fade nicely, leaving the fruity, spicy blend to work their magic."
"This one gives Hennepin a run for its' money, and I will be purchasing it again. Soon..."
"Maybe my favorite domestic Saison, it might have just ousted Ommegang Hennepin. I think a side by side blind tasting is in order. Great stuff!"
"Refreshing and a perfect summer beer. A bit hard on the back end, where the hops come out with the alcohol."
"Overall, an thoughtful domestic twist on a Flemish classic..."
"Lots of carbonation in the mouth with this beverage, reminding me of champagne (which I guess is fitting considering the cork and pop), but caused me to nurse the drink along for quite a while."
"ENJOY!"
"Fruity aroma and a soft, sweet maltiness. Lively mouth feel with a finish reminiscent of brut champagne. Nicely balanced and very pleasant as a sipper on a hot day or anythime!"
"I found Le Merle to be very drinkable and more complex than I had anticipated. Overall, I enjoyed this offering from Northcoast and would recommend trying."
"Starts very creamy, but with lots and lots of prickly carbonation making itself known. Medium bodied. Overall, smooth, nice. The carbonation put my stomach in knots a bit, but for a sipper this is pretty drinkable."
"The 750ml kicked me in the ass. Much stronger than I would expect from a 7.9 abv brew. It is an interesting and I think I'll have to try it again in a few months. The sourness is a bit disconcerting, but overall I liked it."
"nicely carbonated, easy to drink, refreshing in the heat. A great Saison, it would be fun to have this, Dupont and Fantome at the same time for a taste-off"
"Again, very warming and has a solid balance of front and back. Does not come off as over carbonated."
"taste is fizzy, pear, peach, grain, yeast, and a touch of sour malt, ends on the dry side."
"Poured a dark gold with orange tints with a frothy white head that sticks around for awhile and leaves sticky lace patches. Has that yeast smell I am accustomed to, as well as some sour fruits with the citric hops and some spices and a faint dose of caramelized malt. Light and smooth, goes down easy with some bubbly carbonation on tongue. Just not the greatest taste though, as the tartness from the fruit flavoring seems to override the taste of the fruits (I'm picking up apple, orange, citric) and the sweet malts. Finishes crisp and dry. Not bad, but I can think of better farm ales."
"I really dont know how to describe the taste. I know I dont care for it and am not enjoying it, but for the style it seems to follow the guidlines. Its not fruity though and definatly a bit more warm from alcahol. Compared to other saisons I've had this on is very dry, bitter and bready with plenty of sourdough flavors."
"This offering from North Coast Brewing came in a corked bottle, which the cork came out with a loud pop ! Thankfully, the beer did rise a bit, but not enough to pour all over the kitchen, whew ! The color is a nice light golden with a thick, big head. The smell is like faint hard cider. The taste is a bit sharper than some other 8% saisons but very enjoyable. I tasted cloves, apples, a crispness. Mouthfeel is bubbly with some fruit tones, and tart/spice aftertaste. Drinkability is good, an interesting saison. I had read about La Merle on this site in the past and am glad that I finally bought it, very enjoyable."
"Drinkability: This one is definitely drinkable. I like it, but once again, I'd say it's not really my style, given the other saisons I've tried and really enjoyed. One of the best American interpretations of a Belgian brew I've had in a while, but the lack of balanced dry and tart flavors and the heavier body make it hard for me to call it a saison. If you like Belgian golden ales, I'd suggest giving this one a try. But if you're looking for a Belgian-style seasonal ale which is great to drink on a warmer afternoon, I'd save this one until the leaves start falling once again."
"D: easy to drink; nothing too bad about the beer, but nothing special"
"Nice to see the Artist series available in BC from North coast. This is a big Saison with a full mouthfeel and more hops than usual for the style. I likes the fruit notes on the nose and the finish and the fuller mouthfeel actually made it more versatile with greater varieties of food. Nice work from NC on a style that invokes Spring for me"
"A very good saison, which some people think is gone and reired. Pours foamy whitish body and big lasting soapy white head, lasting lace. A little farmhouse aroma, and spice. Taste is above average, complex spice. A nce drinking saison, more of a sipper, hat refreshes the Summer wheaher."
"D: This is a good saison... it just lacks in the complexity and cohesiveness of a well crafted saison. Worth exploring."
"Overall, I dig this beer. Drinking a 750ml bottle on my own, gave me time to appreciate it, as it warmed it got better, more drinkable. It reminded me of Pure Mead, at the first taste, and later as my palate dried. This is excellent with strong cheese and fruit. A white wine alternative..."
"Smell is flowers and fruits with a bit of banana and spice, taste hits you sweet up-front and then dries out like a nice wine with some substantial spice and a lot of citrus, a light, bubbly mouthfeel with a touch of alcohol. Not very funky at all, but a very solid American un-funky interpretation of the style."
"Overall a well structured, complex saison. Stands with the best in the buisness."
"Poured a corked and caged 750 into my Tripel Karmeliet tulip. This beer pours a sunny orange with a massive, rocky, bright white head that leaves ample lacing as it recedes. Le Merle has a typical aroma of a Saison. Lush, ripe golden apples, pears, apple skins, grass and damp earth. Green apple skins, biscuits, toast and what I would call a hay flavor, are surrounded by a rich pale malt sweetness that pulls all the flavors together. The mouthfeel is light and crisp leaving a great interplay of tingling carbonation on the tip of the tongue. With summer approaching, nothing beats a great saison for a refreshing beer. This is a great American example of a Saison."
"Initial taste was of some honey with a touch of clove followed by a great fresh orange character. I would say this was perfectly carbonated, but the beer seemed a tad heavy on the mouthfeel with a touch of alcohol. No real discernable hop character but I wasn't really expecting one with this beer. Some funkiness, but quite pleasant and helped round this beer out. Will definitely purchase again for the summer months."
"Great full body brew, but equally crisp and refreshing like a good hefe. I really enjoyed this, though I admit i'm impartial to the style. Good strong zesty flavors here, nothing lacking or at want.Just a good all around saison, true to style, and just what I wanted on this premature summer day."
"I'm not sure what I look for in a Saison, but not many have it. This beer is pleasant enough to drink, but just doesn't have that extra something that makes me say ""Now this is a Saison!"""
"I tried to balance my rating here, since I feel it is a poor implementation of the style, but a wonderful beer worth trying, if only for its refreshing uniqueness."
"D: A very solid saison by North Coast"
"Thanks, rsyberg01, for the opportunity"
"D- easy to finish the bottle, and almost a sessionable ABV. this is something i can see myself having this again. espicially if the price break i got it with holds up."
"Drinkability: A drinkable if in my opinion slightly below average saison. I say that not literally - it's quite a good beer - but I really like saisons, and this one just doesn't quite rise to the level of some of the more amazing ones I've had. It's a relatively heavy, thicker, candied fruit-like mess, but doesn't have the amount of sweetness you'd expect, the freshness of the spices in the nose, the ... eh, you get the idea. It's good, I'd drink it again, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it. Give it a shot."
"overall impression: a good classic example of a not brett saison, the beer has no faults but the flavor could have been more"
"Of the two saisons sampled at El Prado this evening, this would be my pick. Not what I'd want all the time in my saisons, but really captures the wild, funky haphazardness of the style. A beer with character, flavor, and style."
"First saison I've tried, and I'm definitely hankering for more. This is a decent brew, more straightforward than complex, but definitely tasty. Recommended."
"I was walking the juniper woods in 80 degrees today. This was a perfect beer to come home to. Light, complex but with an easy drinking dryness. This brew is one of the reasons saison is quickly becoming one of my favorite styles."
"Pours a golden colored body, pretty cloudy, with a smallish white colored head. Has a belgian flower aroma, sugary, and super sweet. Carbonated palte, with a sour taste, mediciney. Warming up, mellower, medicine taste is gone. Flowery taste."
"D: It probably could have benefited from a bit more hop character, but still a quality saison. I have yet to be let down by a North Coast brew. Would go well as an aperitif or with a light lunch on a hot summer day."
"Overall this is a good, basic saison...nothing too crazy. No wild yeast, no unusual spices."
"Pours an opaque yellow with a fine bubbled white head and some lace. Aroam is medium sweet with Pils malt, light lemon, bread and nicely spiced. Flavor is initially sweet malt flavor with a good deal of bready yeastyneess and ample spice. Lingering bitter/dry finish. Mouthfeel is crisp citrus with a medium body."
"Overall a good, drinkable farmhouse that I enjoyed but not enough to get me to stop drinking Hennepin or Dupont"
"D - Extremely drinkable, period."
"D - WOW. Where is the 7.9%??? Dangerous."
"Pours a clear golden color with a large white head that hangs around for a very long time. Had to pour slowly and carefully to avoid foam from overflowing the glass. Heavy lacing is left on the glass. The smell is citrus and lemons. Just a light spice note in the aroma. The flavor has a huge citrus and lemon element up front. Just a hint of spice and finishes very dry. Light body with abundant carbonation. I enjoyed this Saison as it is more citric and less spicy. I also enjoyed the dry finish."
"I would buy this again."
"750ml corked bottle served in a Duvel tulip. Opens with quite a pop. Plenty of carbonation. Pours a hazy gold with a big white head. Spice and citrus in the aroma. Some noble hop aroma comes out as it warms. On the lighter side of medium bodied with a spritzy mouthfeel from all that carbonation. More spice and a little tart lemon in the flavor Very dry. There is a little funk in the finish (in a good way). Maybe a little past its prime, the flavors could have been a bit brighter."
"D: Overall this is a very easy drinking saison with a rewarding blend of looks, aroma and taste. I've had this sitting in my fridge for a while and was putting off reviewing it. However it as surpassed my expectations. Worthwhile."
"Good but I prefer saisons just a little sweeter."
"This beer poured a cloudy yellow golden color with generous white head that dissipated to a thin film along the top. The aroma was of citrus, spice, and yeast. The flavor was of the same with more citrus coming through. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied. The drinkability was pretty high and would be nice on a hot day."
"A definitely interesting experience. A bit sharp and direct at first, mellowing out through the bottle to a somewhat and uninspired finish. A touch on the sweet/fruity side of saisons, although definitely a worthy interpretation. I was hoping for a bit more farm funk and a bit less citrus and in-your-face sweet yeasts, although it was still fairly enjoyable. Easy drinking and finishing the bottle posed no challenge. Definitely worth trying a bottle."
"Well, here we go again, another American brewed Saison, and on-draft no less, I've only had a few of these I've liked. This one is served a nice hazy orange-yellow with a frothy off-white head that diminishes to a thin layer. The aroma is lots of sweet malts and fruits with yeast, spice and some orange peel. The taste is an enjoyable initial that quickly gives way to a sour aftertaste. The beer is a little heavier and harder to drink than I expect from the style. This one is somewhat enjoyable, but still far from Hennepin or Big Boss Surrender Monkey."
"Poured from a 750 into a tulip glass. Hazy dark straw color with a foamy, boisterous off-white head. Fresh aroma of yeast; nutty and bready. Champagne-like: bubbly and light on the tongue, with vinous fruit flavors opening into more complex, nutty/earthy flavors. Mouthfeel is perfect-- light, yet full and creamy at the same time. Flavors are bright, complex, and fresh. Hints of hay, hops, and minerals show up at times. Nothing dominates, but the creamy complexity of earth and fruit flavors and the perfection of the mouthfeel make this an impressive beer, especially for the relatively cheap price of $8 per 750 ml. Outstanding."
"something just a tad over-exuberant about it all, esp. the fruitiness that borders on overripe and somewhat unexpected level of funk."
"I had hoped for a little more, but this is a nice enough beer. Easy to drink and pretty pleasant overall."
"D: Big enough to be a slow sipper, and the feel is wonderful. Flavour and aroma come just a tad short for my palate, but it's a decent beer nonetheless. Happy to have tried it."
"Oh. I suppose I was just imagining. Well, imagine with me and you'll have a glimpse of what this beer is like..."
"D. Decent. A little too tart and simple but I'd never turn one down. A good example of an American crack at a rather tough and broad style."
"This isn't a bad version of a Saison, but it tastes a little too solvent-like and artificial for my taste. Pretty typical for an American Saison in my experience."
"D - It's a good beer. Not really to my liking so while I certainly don't mind drinking it, I am ready to switch to something else after one."
"Very drinkable."
"My first saison, and overall quite a good brew."
"Mouthfeel is very dry and has a tart pucker. I really like this Saison, and I'm not sure why it's not available locally, since other North Coast beers are available."
"Overall: interesting beer, with some fine flavors. On a hot day I think it would be quite refreshing."
"Dan"
"I think this is extremely drinkable... if it were not 12:22 on a Sunday and I had another bottle it would go down very easily. Refreshing, clean and overall very very good. Plus, I haven't heard Interstate Love Song since who knows when. I need to go back and listen to the whole album."
"A well done attempt by an American brewer. I'm thinking a little more wildness and/or hopping would push it into definite saison/farmhouse territory, and would also increase the complexity. As it stands, it's a very good Belgian inspired beer, just not as exotic as I had hoped."
"North Coast continues to blow me away, and one of the best breweries anywhere. This is a great Saison. I seem to say this a lot about North Coast, but this is one of the best American made versions I have had. Highly recommended."
"Pours yellow with a puffy white head. Orange peel, lemon, wheat, pepper, and earthy yeast. Grassy, fruity taste with some spice, particularly the white pepper. The yeast was nice, not overpoweing, but enough to give you some funk while keeping the beer light."
"D- Pretty solid beer from North Coast. My experience with this style is lacking so I don't have much to compare to, but I will definitely explore more Saisons."
"D: Much better than I thought it would be. Very nice traditional take on the style. I think this beer would cellar nicely. I might just grab a bottle and throw it away for a while."
"Overall, very drinkable. Very enjoyable. It will go well with a variety of food. Very refreshing. Very impressive."
"Notes: A solid beer, not the best ""saison"" I've had, but a damn drinkable brew from a respectable company. It's going to go really well with my Baby Boucheron cheese, toasted baguette slices and Quinta do Coa Olive Oil (Portugal)! Cheers!"
"Dowsn't drink too terribly quickly but it's a solid example of the style."
"D: Very good drinkability, with a nice tart yeasty character makes this a smooth and delightful drink by style and definitely worth checking out. Finishes as strong as it starts."
"Pours cloudy golden colour with big bubbly white head. Smell is sweet and fruity - grapes, pears, grass. Taste is a bit sour and fruity. Really well balanced with perfect level of carbonation beer goes down very well. Great stuff, taste is unbelivable - so complex and really interesting. Would have more!"
"This, I believe, was my first Saison and I have to say I'm confused. This was a good beer but nothing what I expected from the style. It could have been a Belgian Strong Pale Ale or possibly even a Tripel and I wouldnt have noticed the difference. Poured into Duvel glass. Pours a hazy golden yellow with massive rocky head. Smell was of yeast, bread, and some fruits, the fruits were very muted. Taste was a little bland I though. It certainly had that grassy, straw-like Pale Ale taste to it with some yeast and sweet fruits but not much. Either this was too complex for its own good, or it wasnt complex enough, I still cant tell which one it was. Mouthfeel was medium with somewhat high carbonation. Overall an enjoyable beer, but there was something I just didnt get. Expected some funk and I was left funk-less."
"Deep gold color, cloudly, thin head. Very nice for a domestic."
"This saison is a bit on the sweet side with not enough funk to it. Intense and bright tasting, it is good but not quite great."
"Drinkability is pretty good, a nice little saison, authentic and true to style, but there's no wow factor, and it's ultimately forgettable."
"750ml, corked, caged, and it was just begging for me to take it off the shelf & back to a good home. It pours pale, cloudy gold with a thin near-white head that really doesn't hang around to party. The smell, though, makes daddy happy. It's strawberries, lemons, wheatgrass, sugar, a hint of caramel, and a whole lotta makin my mouth water. Taste is drier than the smell hinted at, with tart fruit yielding to a crisp taste and a really clean finish that just makes you want more at the very end. It has an aged cheese taste in there somewhere. The Northcoast guys have outdone themselves on this one. Mouthfeel is creamy, nicely carbonated, and just a hair thin. Drinkability is very good. The flavors balance very well & make me want more. I'd move to a farmhouse if this is what it meant!"
"In comparison to a well known saison, Hennepin, this one has a lot less tropical fruit thing in it and much more of the saison yeast character."
"Nothing to blow you over, but a very solid and worthwhile saison, and like any good saison, matched a creamy pasta with ham dish easily."
"Overall, a rather enjoyable beer, and a very nice belgian style american beer. I'm not completely big on other belgian styles this brewery has made, but i think they did a very good job on this one. Certainly sticks out with the flavor, and still has a nice drinkable bit to it. I do think it is a little bit of a hybrid between a saison and a bspa, but the details isnt important. I enjoyed this beer and look forward to buying it again."
"D - As is often typical of the style, easy to drink. As someone who loves this style, I'd pick up again. It might not be quite as dialed in as some of the Belgian examples, but it's very clear that the guys at North Coast did their homework. I like seeing American brewers make beers like this, and I like it even better when they make it all the way down to the tip of Florida."
"D- The 7.3% ABV is well-hidden, but this beer is rather heavy on the stomach. One Duvel glass was plenty."
"Creamy smooth texture is a definite plus, making this even more drinkable. North Coast has a gem in Le Merle, one of my favorite farmhouse ales. Excellent."
"Overall, a very good, but not quite excellent beer. It's lacking some spice or earthiness or complexity that are typical of the saison style."
"All in all this was a rather drinkable brew, especially considering the price. There's other and better offerings out there if you want to impress a friend, but if you come across this and want a beer of this type, then you get your bang for the buck with this one."
"decent but this is no Saison Dupont."
"Nice saison. I'd be happy to find it at a bar."
"Tastes just as firm, just as perfectly balanced. Weeds and citrus start things off and they move quickly into the really wonderful middle dominated by firm, spicy Belgian yeast. There's not that much to describe (I always feel silly attempting poetry while describing the way a beer tastes, anyways...) aside from that fact that the balance here is simply perfect."
"D - The bottle was big, but I had no problems finishing it. The high carbonation forced me to take it slow so I could burp between sips, but overall this is a very smooth and refreshing beer. I would definately have it again."
"This is a very nice saison and I found it quite refreshing. Probably a great intro to the style for someone unfamiliar, as it's not terribly complex or funky. The only thing that puzzles me slightly is that the label makes note of ""abundant hops"" and ""tropical fruit"" characteristics, neither of which particularly jump out at me. Oh well, I still like it."
"An easy drink that will find yourself opening the other bottle you were gonna cellar."
"Drinkability- Very good job creating this belgian style. Would have liked a bit more funk in the nose and flavor, but I guess you can't ask for everything..well, unless you're Fantome."
"D-This is a great saison by the North Coast folks. It's great to have them back in Louisiana. I was very pleased with this beer."
"Good f'n beer. Gotta be one of the best Saison's I have tried, rivaling even its Belgian origins."
"HV"
"Pours a cloudy amber/orange, medium sized white head, drops down to a thin ring, some lace spots, looks okay. Smell is okay, a bit buttery, citrus, yeasty, some toast, sour/tart finish, a bit cheesy, not bad. Taste is sugary up front, sweet malt, yeast, butter, some light citrus/orange peel, woody, bread, not bad, light tartness in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with high carbonation, refreshing, decent saison. Thanks Jano!"
"I'm not a regular saison drinker, but I'm enjoying this one thoroughly. Not too tart or bitter, my stomach hasn't turned due to the yeast (the 'ol ""map of Japan"" side-effect in one's undergarments), and I'm craving more. Not only that, but the head still hasn't subsided, still a good finger's width of solid white foam near the bottom of the chalice. Yeah, this one's enough to bring me over to the style, if not this particular label's interpretation. I'll be picking up more."
"Overall a pretty good offering. Very accessible and easy to drink, even for the uninitiated. I will drink this again."
"Very Belgian and simply awesome. Sip and enjoy, especially this time of year, can't help but to recommend. Try with honey-grilled chicken or maple salmon."
"North Coast lists Le Merle as a saison; it reminds me of a hybrid saison/tripel. There's good flavor throughout this beer with a good amount of fresh summer fruits. This is another quality brew from North Coast. I really like the things this brewery does."
"750 ml corked & caged. Served in my Maudite tulip. Poured a hazy orange-gold. Tight, two and one half inch off-white. Head was refreshed with each pour but eventually settled into a thin consistent skim. Some lacing, but very little adhered during the tasting. Scent of belgian yeast, citrus, and perhaps candi sugar, but fairly subdued overall. Taste consistent with nose. Some tartness attributable to the citrus quality, but very clean and crisp, also some wheat and perhaps green apple. Spiciness was very subdued for the style. Mouthfeel is light, effervescent, as well as tart. Somewhat lacking in terms of the qualities that are characteristic of a farmhouse (e.g. spicy character and farmhouse funk), but very drinkable and a solid tribute to the style."
"Pours a bright golden orange color with a lasting whitish head that left nice lacing. Smell is sweet, floral, and dusty dandelions. Taste is sweet, faintly tart, delicate and floral. Light funky tartness to it gives it some depth and along with the fizzy light body it is quite easy to drink. Nice."
"The combination of a strong alcohol flavor and a sweet fruity flavor makes this beer a sipper. The mild dryness of the finish makes taking another sip that much more pleasurable. A pint is ideal for sharing, and I would not be able to take down another in the same sitting."
"Poured from corked and caged 750ml into over sized wine glasses . Split with my brother while waiting for a pizza. Pours with a nice 2 finger off white head. Mild lacing billowy fine head like drifted snow. Smell is fantastic belgain yeast slight candy sugar and a spiceiness. Taste is very nice a slight bit of citris, very rich very smooth and creamy. Very tasty, as it warms you begin to a get a hint of grapefruit, light hop bitterness ,alcohol becomes apparent as it warms. Long finish Mouth feel is complex. Moderate drinkability. Very nice beer true to style"
"Poured into an oversized wine glass a sort of hazed milky peach-like color with a thick blooming white head,complex aromas of yeasty clove spice,lemon pith,and overripe pineapple mainly,the funk is there but not overly so.A somewhat sharp mouthfeel is somewhat of an annoyance at first but it mellows after a bit,flavors start out citric and green from the abundance of hops used,it then shows off its funk and yeast elements wich kept the beer from being off the charts for me.Its alot better than some Belgian counterparts,its complex and enjoyable."
"D - Very drinkable, especially in this warm weather but I could see enjoying this year round."
"Not as dry as many saisons, but I definitely respect the touch and care that went into this brew. Very drinkable.. not getting any alcohol burn despite the relatively high ABV... La Merle is a great value and I will continue to pick it up often."
"At least the end of the day was good."
"Le Merle (The Blackbird) is probably in the top tier of American saisons. Here's hoping the brewers continue to tinker because it wouldn't take much to make this offering soar in the same skies as the world's best. Nice job North Coast."
"Pours out a nice pale golden color with an extremely pillowy head that doesn't leave much lace but keeps a solid 1/8 inch layer above the beer the whole way down. Hops, citrusy fruits and, as the bottle says, tropical fruits - banana manly. The taste is fruity, tart, and sour...not as funky as I thought it would be. Hops and yeast appear as well. This brew has such a cool flavor...it's got a unique touch to it that makes it great. Lots of carbonation keeps this beer interesting. Very drinkable, very awesome."
"Nice orange color, hazy, decent white head. It smells pretty yeasty. Some citrus in the flavor, yeast. The alcohol is well hidden and this is easy to drink but it seems like the saisons I've had have more spicy, pepper flavors than this one. This was interesting but i don't think I'll go back to it."
"D: given the more than tolerable ABV which is nicely masked, and the fruity taste of this is one beer I could drink more than once in a sitting...but probably not more than twice given that it's a 750ml bottle."
"Tried this the other night after eyeing it in the store for weeks. Gotta love mark downs. This beer poured a slightly hazy golden color with enough carbonation to give it as many fingers of head as you'd like. Head fell to a finger or so for the duration of the drink. I could look at and smell this beer for days. Immediate smells of citrus, tropical fruit, and a little barnyard lure me in. For me, this nose was almost perfect. The flavor on the first sip was dominated by the carbonation. Made the spice really jump out at me and almost made it feel as though my tongue was cut. The tropical fruit was there, but not as present as the nose would have suggested. As the beer warmed, alcohol became more of a factor and started to detract from the experience due to a little more heat than I would like. Medium bodied, but again, carbonation took away from the mouthfeel. Overall, great beer that I would look to pick up again."
"This is a delightful Saison from a brewery that consistently puts out solid product. It has a lovely golden orange color that gleams in the glass. The aromas are delicate with some banana notes as well as slight citrus and light funk. What really stands out is the taste and drinkability. Banana again on the palate with a little lemony zest on the back, the Le Merle reminds me a lot of Hennepin. While this may not be as traditional as, say, Saison Dupont, this is a beautiful beer and one that I will try again."
"This is one fine drinking beer, every thing I love about this style - refreshing yet complex, flavorful yet sublime, brings in the best of every ingrediant."
"Poured from the 750mL corked bottle. A: Pours a golden yellowy fluid that seems unfiltered in that it is not translucent. The head that formed quickly (and dominated the glass) is luxuriant and fluffy with larger bubbles near the outside and smaller foam bubbles at the center. Even on the second pour, the head was huge and frothy. Carbonation continues to sneak through the fluid as it sits in the glass. S: The smell has that characteristic yeasty Belgian Saison quality. The underlying base is Belgian yeast but a little wild with citrus, other fruits, and spice! T: The flavor carries a nice hoppy punch at the nose which gives way to a peppery, fruity dry finish. MF: The carbonation is full and tickles the tongue throughout. The balance seems skewed toward the hoppiness, in other words, I could use a little more body to the beer. Overall an interesting example of the style."
"The taste is dry, crisp, salty, sweet carbonation in this fruity mouthfeel. Spicy, delicious clove honey, ripened fruit, plums, pears, peaches, wheat, syrupy coating the back of the tongue with a sweet earthy bitterness in the finish."
"This is another quality product from the gang at North Coast. I'm a fan of the saison/farmhouse style but I don't drink them very often. This one is a bit fruitier than some I've had, but I think it actually adds depth to this beer in my opinion. Really nice stuff here. More please."
"drinkability is good. a little more bitter than i'd expect from a saison, but it works. i also enjoyed the subtle spicing. overall, quite nice."
"This is one refreshing and drinkable beer. Tastes of light grassy/citrusy hops, spices, a bit of funk and tartness."
""
"D= Another outstanding ale from North Coast brewery. I will definitely seek out more of this..."
"Drinkability: Easy drinking."
"The beer poured a cloudy, dark straw color with a thin white head into a chalice. The aroma had that distinctive Belgian yeast profile, with sweet and sour components. The flavor was more of the same, with bubble-gum sweetness and sour apple tartness both fairly prevalent. The sweet/sour flavor lasted long after the last swallow - an interesting style. A fairly fizzy mouthfeel. All in all, a very refreshing and drinkable beer for those hot summer days that will surely be showing up here in the Baltimore area fairly soon."
"Overall- This is the most clean and refreshing Saison I have tried to date. Very true to style and just outstanding."
"I love the wild twang, it draws me in for more and is very satisfying. Num."
"Full mouthfeel with carbonation that borders on over aggressive. Still, a good try at the style from one of the more consistent American breweries."
"A hazy orange glow with a disappointingly thin white head. Aromas of oranges and lemon grass. Flavors of coriander, citrus, alcohol, and a fresh, doughy malt-like character hides beneath. Prickly carbonation, medium body, bitter-spiced finish. My bottle says 9% alcohol, not 7.9%"
"D- A very drinkable beer, quite refreshing."
"[On edit: 2 months later, and I've enjoyed about one of these a week. Bumped the drinkability to 5. This is at least the equal of Dupont, possibly better.]"
"Drinkability: A very solid domestic version of the style, from a brewery I continue to be a big fan of. I paid around $8 for the bottle, which I think is certainly worth it. Again, what it doesn't mess with is the phenolic funkiness of a lot of true non-domestic Saisons, but then again, I'd rather have it be balanced and complex without the risk-taking into unworthy and unbalanced territory."
"Golden honey with white pillowy head. Light traces of lace across the glass. Smells earthy, buscuits, tropically floral, hints of banana and mango. Taste begins with french baguette, then transitions into some grassy earth, green apple, mild banana funk, some unripened pine apple, all very well balanced. Creamy mouthfeel could use some more carbonation to hit that champaign-esque feel traditionally found in saisons. Very nice for an american take at the style."
"Pours out a slightly chill-hazed brassy tangerine with a wealth of tiny bubbles making their way to the head. Head is massive, foamy, and almost spills over the top. Leaves some near solid lacing on the glass. Nose is very fruity (over-ripe fruits) and candy sweet. I get a lot of peach and mango (which I would normally love, but, as I said, it's more of an over-ripe and near-rotten smell). Has a bit of a grain bite in the nose. Flavor starts off with a candy sweetness and some grainy character which leads into those over-ripe fruits again (but not so overbearing as in the aroma). A bit of an earthy hop comes in toward the finish alongside a dull bitterness and a flat yeastiness. The saving grace of the flavor profile is a finishing dryness and mild background acidity which save this from being an overall cloying experience. Mouthfeel is rather light in body with a jumpy carbonation although it isn't so forcefully carbonated that it pricks the tongue. Drinkability started off OK, but as it warms it gets sweeter and sweeter and the bitterness becomes more astringent. If I ever drink this again, which I doubt, I will definitely be having this ice cold."
"The beer pours a bright orange-juice like color with a decent cloudiness to it out of the 750 mL corked and caged bottle. The head is a solid inch and slowly settles down to a retentive 1/4 inch thick foam. Lots of aroma in this one. Very fruity, mainly citrus and banana. There is a definite tart grapefruit aroma in there too. The beer itself is relatively mild in flavor. A surprise much like my first try of Saison DuPont. There is a nice prickly CO2 body that gives a lot of pepper notes to the semi-sweet, semi-bitter beer. The aftertaste is strong metallic hops and oily at the end. A very good example of an authentic belgian style saison IMO. This is similar to the Jolly Pumpkin's Bam Bière, but has more of that undetectable alcohol than the sessionable JP, again a bit more true to the style. This is a great example of an American brewer that really captivated this delicate and unique Belgian style."
"This is on-spot for style. Try pairing this with pork chops, red cabbage, saurkraut and mashed potatoes - everything in there will complement the various aspects of this well-made brew."
"Network Difficulties - Please Standby ... Pours a slight hazy golden orange .. light fluffy head, lacing a bit low for a saison ... funked up honey smell ... light and tangy, some nice bitterness, lower sweetness ... in an umbrella: is a well made American saison that is enjoyable and goes down smooth with lots of refreshing qualities! ... drank while enjoying a blank screen then the Dynamo in the CONCACAF semi's 2008!!!"
"This is no little knock-off Saison, this is the real deal with nice acidity and even a mild funk. Would like to see how this ages."
"Poured a golden straw with two inch fluffy head. The smell was quite tame with not a lot of the hay, wet straw smell normally associated with a Saison. Taste was fruity and musky and the drinkabilty was good. Wouldn't seek this one out but it was good to try and compare with all the other Saisons out there"
"Bright lemon yellow body. Voracious carbonation from the looks of it. There's a big pillowy dove white head that acquiesces to a rocky terrain as it dissipates. Really good aroma of belgian yeastiness, doughy maltiness and spice. The flavor doesn't disappoint either. Honeyed malt flavors lay a base. Tropical fruit nuances dance around (peaches, mango and papaya). Hops give an herbal presence to the beer. The mouthfeel is not as charged up as the appearance seemed to indicate. Oh, it's got some scouring power were you to pair this with say a crispy duck in red coconut curry sauce. But it's not gaseous or bloating. Body is light to light-medium. All in all, this is pretty damn enjoyable."
"An interesting interpretation of the saison style. Perhaps it is a little too ""clean""."
"Poured out of a 750ml corked and caged bottle; review based on second half of the bottle with the yeast poured. Pours a cloudy (almost milky) golden color (first half of the bottle was fairly clear). The smell is on the faint side but is true to the BPA and Saison style; light floral sweetness and some yeast funk. The taste is light and not overly complex, more Belgian Pale Ale. There is a light candi sugar sweetness and a light Belgian spice profile. The beer stays true to the tart side of saisons but doesn't quite deliver the spice or funk of top notch saisons. However the brew does not taste bad, at all. The feel is moderate with very active carbonation, finishes very well balance. This is quite the drinkable brew, very light in the feel, the alcohol is well hidden and it tastes like a good BPA. A very good representation from an Amercian brewer."
"Had this beer in between imperial stouts and dipa's and it was very refreshing. This is good beer. Go try!"
"D: I enjoyed this one slowly and wasn't eager to go back to it. I really like the tanginess and appreciate that it's not too strong, but it's not my favorite in this style."
"Large bottle, caged and corked, no freshness nor bottling info offered. Pours light apricot amber, semi cloudy and initially shooting up a HUGE eggshell head, it slowly becomes a puffy and long lasting meringue. Leaving gobs of thick sheeting and ringed lace. Plenty of micro bubbles continuing to rise. Nice looking glass of beer. Nose is multifaceted with whiffs of soap, perfume and light pepper. Love the style and this is a worthy take on it. More perfume, plenty of pepper, spiced tropical fruit such as bananas, melon, mango. Moderate, subtle drying hops late. Complex, interesting beer. Well worth a try."
"Pours a great hazey hay colored sunshine. Hnts of pale orange mix and dazzle the eyes. Agood head greet right after the pour, but eventually recedes to nothing. The aroma is a spicey mix dry fruits ad vibrant minerals. Very good recreation of a Belgian classic. The first sip is a very spicey fruit. Hnts f cinan and nutmeg. The middle and finish is little dryer. The finish is reminiscat of dry English water mixed with chammomile. The palte is smooth, yet dry and fruity. Dried fruits and unsweetened. Great rendition of a hard to mimic Belgian classic."
"Give this a try but don't expect it to be much different from Pranqster."
"Mouthfeel is tingly and creamy from all of the carbonation. Unlike many reviews of this beer, I did not find it overly thin for the style."
"Not bad, but I can't say I'll be having this again. I got this bottle at Discount Liquor in Milwaukee, and split it with Surly Sober."
"As mentioned above, this one has been seen in the house before, so it has something good going for it. Generally a very drinkable, nice version of the style. Not ""out there"" in something new, something wild, something weird, but overall, a good drinker."
"D: One bottle between 3 people would be perfect. It was a little harder between two."
"Nice drinking beer for the style"
"D: A pretty good American saison, nose could use a little work, but overall, pretty good, $6 for a glass at Beachwood."
"it's a yeasty tasting beverage, as well. spicy. a complex malt-based (but yeast influenced) caramel element. sweet, bitter and with a strong noble hop flavor. a little chunky for a saison, but i suppose i'll forgive (it's hard for a homebrewer to criticize deviation from style guidelines). certainly dinkable"
"pours a yellowish hazey amber with a film of a head that is pretty damn close to white, and a nose that seems to hint toward corriander and maybe banana peel, a coarse nose if you catch my drift. taste that corriander for sure and that banana taste is there as well, just not as noticeable. pretty consistant all the way through, the mouth-feel is coarse but not abrasive and smooths as it goes toward the finish. drinks okay, but usually this style and my bowels don't agree(as well as doubles and triples) so I would say not a good downer but not everyone has the G.I. problems that I do, so you may feel different and I wouldn't disagree, so that being said; as far as a saison goes it's pretty good."
"La merle pours a peachy hazy yellow with good head, but it dissipates quick. ok lace. The nose is very wheaty, and some spice is there. Taste has alot of wheat, and has alot of spice as well. Some banana on the finish. Now notice more spice through the middle, good spice and good flavor. Mouthfeel is good for a saison. Drinkability is very high and refreshing. I could see this being very good on a hot summer day. way to go north coast."
"This is to be expected in this style but is still not my cup of tea."
"D - This is pretty easy to drink despite being big and flavorful. I have noticed that many North Coast beers have more flavor than aroma and Le Merle follows that trend as well. The nose is pleasant enough, but it fails to fully reflect the depth of the flavor. Overall this is an excellent saison and a wonderful example of the style."
"Pour was a very carbonated, slightly hazy, yellow with lots of legs. Smelled of citrus with clove and coriander spice. After the carbonation settle, the taste was extraordinary, with light notes of citrus and little bitterness from the spices. Barely felt the alcohol flavor and very drinkable. Note to self: Go to BevMo and buy a bottle."
"Tastes okay, the coriander and fruit come out with a solid pale malt backbone, but again, I find this lackluster. Dry finish, and eminiently sippable at 8%, but I prefer other examples of the style that are more affordable and better distributed."
"A great funky nose and a flavor to match! What a spot on example of the style from an American producer. If saison is your thing, then this is definitely one to try. Great level of smooth carbonation to it Too bad this hasnt shown up in Brooklyn yet (from what I have seen)."
"Pours a very cloudy gold, with a big lasting head that leaves lace all the way through the glass. Aroma is that of yeast, some musty notes, and a bit spicy, with some hints of candied citrus peel. Flavor is spicy, phenolic and yeasty, with some dryness that follows through to the finish. The body seems a little big for the style, but the finish is dry and short."
"Corked and caged 750ml bottle poured into a large tulip glass. Pours a pale yellowish orange color with a large off-white head. The aroma is malt, tropical fruit, citrus and spices. The taste is citrusy fruits with yeast and spices dancing around the tongue with a dry finish. Overall, this is a pretty solid attempt at making a Belgian style saison. There are many saisons made in Belgium that are far superior, but Le Merle is one of the better ones produced in the US. Recommended."
"Notes - An easy drinking saison with good character, and at $7 per 750ml bottle you really can't go wrong."
"Drinkability: a so-so saison that just doesn't excite me at all. Not so easy to drink with the unbalanced flavors."
"D:I could drink this one all day and all night long...very drinkable...lickable"
"Poured in a Rapscallion glass, formed a 2"" off-white head over the slightly cloudy dark gold brew. Head is refueled by heavy bubblage from the bottom, takes a long time before the sticky prominent lacing can be noted. Aroma is crisp hops with pale malts. Taste is sweet maltiness upfront coupled with spiciness that lingers on after the swallow. Mouthfeel is clean, and drinkability is only limited by the somewhat excessive malt sweetness. Nice swing at the style from an American brewer."
"D- This style is really hard to judge just because the lines are wide open for what can be called a saison. I think it is good but not your classic Fantome Saison or anything. Still a good beer but missing the saison yeast to it which IMO is a big part of the style. I will probably get this again but not running to the store to get it."
"Le Merle from North Coast pours a hazed orange-amber into a large snifter with aggressive carbonation and a nice thick white foam. Musty aroma of lemon pepper and bananas. Flavor includes hay, banana, grassy hops, and spice. Some alchol warming is present. No sourness or funk to be found and the bitterness is high for style. The bitterness becomes more balanced by yeast fruit flavors as the beer warms, however, at that point the particulate yeast begins to present some off (and not in a good funky way) flavors. Not my kind of saison."
"Drinkability: It's hard for me to be unbiased here because I like this brewery and this style so much, but that said... this is a nice beer. Recommended as a flavorful, refreshing-yet-interesting quaffer."
"D  Im not a big Saison fan but this was very drinkable. It would have probably been better on a nice hot summer day rather than late fall. IMO its worth a try."
"D- This beer has a nice depth and some good complexity that has a sort of mystery about it. The flavors are good and they blend together well making a bit difficult to describe."
"This beer seems like it would be a decent starter for a tasting. The malt body is well-rounded and playfully citric and the finish isn't overbearing. I've only had 10-15 saisons, so my experience is limited, but I would come back to this one and probably will."
"A great beer to have with a meal."
"Drinkability is hindered by the metallic tones which are so hard to take. Served with some nice, spicy or meaty food, it eases down well enough."
"Pours a hazy straw yellow with a big, but ultimately short-lived, head. There is some hay in the smell, nothing too funky or spicey. Not bad. The taste is a bit ""sharp."" A good touch of bitterness too, botrderline IPA scale. Not what I want is a Saison. While seemingly smooth in body, this still drinks very high on the tongue. This improves after a great deal of warming, but the quaffability (love that word) is never at the leave a Saison should be. A bit hot too, surprising for its ABV. All in all, an admirable attempt, but not a beer I would come back to."
"D: Not really digging this one. Not a lot of balance which I prefer in my brews. This one is a bit flagrant and all over the place."
"Served up in a Le Merle Chalice with a silver bird on it. Nice hazy orange glow. Decent white head. Nose is sweet, fruity, and yeasty. Taste is true to style, with barny wild yeast and slight hops. Mouthfeel is good, and drinkability is nice considerng the almost 8% ABV. Good saison."
"D: I found this to be very refreshing. This is an excellent US made Saison."
"Pours into the tulip very clear gold with a short finger of creamy head. The smell is fruity and spicy; orange peel, black pepper, and coriander. Flavor is pleasing, but over-sweet compared to the typical Saison. Tart and lemony on the front of the tongue, but becomes peppery in the center. Bursting with orange sweetness and coriander in the finish and aftertaste, with a bit too much lasting alcohol warming. Overly prickly and carbonated in the mouth. A worthwhile change of pace, but atypical and not altogether winning."
"Nice work, North Coast! Let's see some more."
"D - This is a nice saison. It is true to the style to say the least (as tough as it is to pin down saison). I would like to try it aged, but this one isn't really my thing."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden with an excellent head that fades to a healthy cap with some medium lacing. The nose is slightly sweet with typical Belgian yeast aromas and also apples, pepper, and honey. Pretty nice. The taste replicates the nose and adds in layers of orange, lemon, a slight sourness, and some slight sweetness on the finish. The mouthfeeel is creamy, smooth, and crisp- and quite refreshing. Nice to see this style increasing in popularity and to see it done so nicely."
"D, Notes: This, Ommegang Hennepin, and Brooklyn Local 1 are the best domestic takes on a Saisons that I have had. Good yeast, complex, refreshing. Well made and well balanced."
"Drinkability is pretty good. This saison style beer really packs a punch in the flavor department, and isn't super easy to sip. But it's very interesting, and well worth a try."
"The appointed Duvel tulip glass was a nearly perfect vessel to hold this pale, frothy, heady Saison. The bubbles just kept rushing up from the etched D at the bottom of the glass, and head showed no signs of wavering. The smell was full of tartness and spice. Fresh cut hay, sun baked earth, and bright marigold flowers in the nose were evocative of some European farmhouse. The taste was very dry, which allowed the tart sourness and spice to play the role major flavor contributors. Also present was some ripe cheese, and green apple, which finally gave way to a dose of hops in the finish, the only apparent concession towards the American origin of this beer. A good balance between delicate and rustic in the mouthfeel department with lightness due to the abundance of bubbles. Not as full of character as the beers from DuPont or Fantôme, but a worthy offering in the style from a surprising source."
"Cheers"
"Perhaps this is why the taste was a bit of a let down. Still much better than most anything you will find brewed in North America."
"Drinkability - this is a decent beer. Also, its abv is just a little high for it to be a sessionable beer."
"I have mixed feelings about this beer. Three good things about this beer are 1) It has fantastic head retention. After taking a few sips and walking away for several minutes, when I return, there is still a lovely, white froth that almost looks like meringue a good inch thick remaining. 2) The smell is just wonderful with plenty of fruit and yeast and a very subtle ""barnyard"" smell that you really have to search for. This seemed to be pretty on-point for the style, although not 100%; still nice nevertheless. 3) Lastly, this had quite a collection of yeast and debris in the bottle, which is rather desireable to me. The one truly negative thing about this beer, is perhaps the most important: taste. A farmhouse saison should have a sour/tartness to it, IMO, and this did not. In fact, it seemed much more bitter on the finish, which was rather disappointing to me. I really enjoy this style, and had such high hopes for this drink. It is certainly not a bad beer, but as far as being a saison, I just don't think it is a very good representation of the style."
"Saison is one of the toughest beer styles to compete in due to the high quality and low cost of Hennepin; this isn't equal to Hennepin. This is OK and quite mildly flavored"
"At Hops in Humboldt 2007, this was a cloudy orange with a fat white head and good lacing. Nose is all over the place with orange and grapefruit, peaches, pears, and apricots, and floral hops. A feast for the nose. Mouthfeel creamy and rich. Flavors are like the nose except there are some spices, and the finish is long and slightly sour. Exceptional beer."
"D: quaffable but i think i prefer the real deal. the higher strength tends to take a little away from it in my opinion. well worth a try though. cheers!"
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"Drinkability: An unremarkable saison with a brash, punishing level of carbonation."
"This is a pretty nice beer, though a little bit tends to go a long way IMO. I could barely finish the 750 ml bottle. It would be interesting to try this beer next to the Ommegeddon, which I believe this beer resembles in many ways."
"Pours a cloudy yeasty orange-ish yellow with an off white head. Aromas of fruit, green apples, and a tart yeasty nose. As in the taste, fruity, green apple like, but not so sweet and a dry yeasty follow through. A sweet, fruity mouthfeel, with a dry yeasty aftertaste. I really like the fruity characteristics to this yeasty beer. One of the better Belgian styles from a micro brewery."
"Recommended. A nice saison for a decent price."
"Drinkability: For such a high alcohol saison, it's still easy to down. I could have a few glasses of these, but would have to share a bottle."
"Le Merle was quite quaffable and didn't have an overwhelming musty-wet-blanket aroma that accompanies some saisons. Drank the entire bottle in about an hour-and-a-half. Would like to revisit this one again."
