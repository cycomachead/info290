"Another great shelf saison from Hill Farmstead. Super tasty."
""

"phenomenal beer. beautiful pale straw color with the slightest orange/pink hue. the acidity of the lime and sweet acidity of the blood orange balance amazingly with the light Brett character. would drink this all day if I could."
""
""
""
""
"Very good saison with interesting funkiness. Based on the advertised specialty ingredients, I did expect a bit more. Those could have been left off the bottle and don't seem to add much to it. Base beer is good though."

"Brother soigne pours a super hazy straw color.  The smell is pretty straightforward saison with some lime zest/citrus rind.  Much more complex taste, especially as it warms.  The mimosa-like citrus qualities and lively, champagne-like carbonation play real well with the barnyardy brett funk.  The mouthfeel is crisp, clean, and refreshing.  I would seek this out again and again."

""
""
""

"Really benefits from warming as the blood orange was only noticeable near room temperature....otherwise..it's a fairly good saison with too much of a lime presence that overwhelms what I can only assume is a nice saison beneath."

"Mouthfeel is light, crisp and almost watery, with a light feel, zesty champagne like carbonation and a mild funky taste that kicks in before the sour and tart finish which is on the clean side. Extremely easy to drink, this was a great light farmhouse ale that was perfect in its simplicity as it was just complex enough to be different with every sip. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
"Most recent batch. I think this one is the best batch yet. Dry but crisp, slightly tart and exploding with lime and hibiscus."

"Bottle. Poured into Hill Farmstead's long stemmed goblet. Awesome glassware. Pours a cloudy honeyed color. Thin white seam of a head. Head manages to lace pretty consistently. Nose is first and foremost quite tart. Lemon and lime right off the bat. more tart than funky. Pale malt sweetness. The flavor is lively, crisp, and refreshingly tart. Tart lime, lemon, and cider or champagne. Brett! Atad of pale, malty, bready sweetness. Carbonation is intense and uplifting. More body and feel than I would have expected once knowing the ABV and specific style of the beer. Never will complain when I get my hands on some Vermont royalty."
"Hazy pale yellow with a minimal head. Earthy spicy funky yeasty. Nice farmhouse ale."

"Bottle: Poured hazy hay color ale with a super large pure white foamy head with good retention and some excellent lacing. Aroma of light tart and vinous notes is quite refreshing. Taste is also dominated by lime notes with some tart and vinous notes also perceptible. Body is full enough with great carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Well brewed with great drinkability even though I usually prefer my saison with flavours focusing on rustic malt and yeasty notes."

"Shared with me by my friends at my daughter's birthday party.  Poured into Fiddlehead teku glasses.  A gorgeous hazy straw-yellow with a finger of pure white head that slowly dissipates.  Aroma is filled with yeast and citrus.  Taste is very nice...lots of orange and lemon notes, no funk to speak of, nice balance of bitterness...classic saison with the addition of citrus fruit.  Mouth feel is ideal - dry, refreshing, perfectly carbonated.  Overall, a fantastic beer."
"This beer is amazing, delicious, zesty and tart."
""
""
""
""

"Overall another terrific brew from Hill Farmstead and friends. Would seek out again!"
"Sour and fruity. Small and balanced lemon taste. Refreshing and highly drinkable."

"Delightful meshing of fruit, funk and tartness.  Super keen to seek out more."

"Mildly tart, zesty citrus, fleshy orange and distinct lime which has a very light salty edge. Bitter, tart and floral all at once, a great delight to drink!"

"The beer is hazy and straw yellow with a small white head. The aroma brings lemon, hay, funk, straw, yeast, sunshine. Lovely flavor. Tart with prominent citrus character. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Really tasty. Another winner from Shaun."
"Bottled 05 2014 and served in a Hill Farmstead stem at 51 degrees. Pours a translucent honey-gold with a frothy, one inch, bright white head that sizzles and pops as it slowly recedes into a film. Delicate strands of lacing adhere to the walls of the glass during the tasting and copious tiny bubble are present effervescing in solution. Nose suggests lime, orange zest and herbal/floral notes. Taste consistent with nose; however, the citrus manifests more as tart orange co-mingled with lime. Mouthfeel is light and lively with a pleasant, even acidity. Incredibly bright and refreshing. Overall, nice complexity despite lacking the rustic qualities I tend to associate with the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: An amazing beer. Incredibly flavorful and drinkable at the same time. One of the best saisons I've ever had. Definitely worth seeking out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a light bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is crazy drinkable with a hidden alcohol inclusion. In the summer, I could kill bottle after bottle of this if I had it."

"O- This is an extremely well done saison! Thanks so much Stevedore for this one! You are an amazing BA!!"

"Overall- Another obviously good HF beer. Reminds me of Anna with the addition of fruit. Great summer thirst quencher."
""

"Pour is a transparent pale gold with a tight white head. Nose is very clean, hints of lime and citrus with a balanced floral herbal note. Very light farmhouse funk and moderate yeast presence with a touch of peppery spice in back. Taste follows the nose, extremely refreshing especially on a hot day. A good bit of citrus and lime with a nice balance of the farmhouse yeast and a faint pepper in the back. A bit sweet and could use some more farmhouse characteristic. Body is light, carb is a touch on the lights side."
"O: Bright, snappy and complex this saison certainly highlights the lime and Brett notes resulting in a slightly puckering brew."

""
""
""
""

""

"Overall a juicy, highly drinkable, citrus forward saison. The lime and blood orange come out about as good as possible. If anything, maybe the addition of the citrus has thinned down the body a bit. Complexity is not great, but the flavors are so rounded and delicious the former is overlooked. About as good as Convivial Suarez and similar in characteristics."

"Poured nicely with a soft white creamy head. A tart and slightly sour taste that lingeted in the lower part of palette for a good 4 - 5 minutes afterwards. Great lacing that ringed the glass sip after sip. Got a bit more sour as it warmed but it was still a fabulous beer. Wish it was in Florida so I can serve it at my bar."

"Pours a cloudy pale yellow beer. Forms a nice head. Aroma is of sourness, but very light. Taste is of a sour saison, not very sour, yet the tartness is present. Very refreshing beer, acidic. Not malty. Very light body, it almost felt like a gose. Probably some salt was added. Outstanding beer."

"Poured out a bright, hazy yellow with a fluffy white head that dissipated extremely quick. Nice floral, tart, acidic, brett nose. Tastes tart, funky from the brett, a bit bitter with a hint of sweetness. Not really picking up one dominate flavor. Things seemed to have come together masterfully. Infinitely drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Shaun Hill is a master. Just a beautifully balanced beer. Wonderfully executed saison base further amplified by the citrus notes and brett funk. Every flavor works in harmony with the rest, with nothing being overly dominant. Could literally drink this all day. Cheers Hill Farmstead!"
""
" The flavor is strong citrus with lemony and floral flavor of hibiscus with its light sour tropical fruitiness and lemony tart acidity hits the palate with herbal and spice complimentary flavor of orange the hibiscus blends well with malt in the finish. Overall a very sour, refreshing beer with tasty citrus and excellent drinkability -very nice quaffable sour ale with moderately low abv."

"This is an awesome saison only made better with oranges and limes. Nice level of funk, with some tartness, and fruit flavors. Consistently interesting and a pleasure to drink."
"Good. Really good. Nice and fruity with the typically enjoyable Hill Farmstead funk. Lime dominates a bit much overall."

"Verdict: A delight from Grassroots (Hill Farmstead & Luc), the tart quality of the beer is so well executed and the lime flavors are quite enjoyable while layering over the traditional saison/farmhouse flavors. The beer is bright, delicate and very refreshing, exactly what I am looking for in a beer of this style."

"An absolutely beautiful beer with funk and tons of fruit tartness."
""
""
""
"An exceptionally delicious brew with a rare balance that puts this one right up near the top."
"Pour is hazy orange with a huge, pillowy white head and great lacing. Spritzy, lemony, musty, funky, doughy, floral, light honeycomb, grassy, hibiscus, and citrusy aroma. Really nice Hill Farmstead terroir in this one. Taste tart lemon peel, big lime, citrusy, flower petals, honey, grassy, somewhat bitter, doughy, orange peel, wheaty, and tangy with a big tart citrusy, dry finish. Medium body with high carbonation. Seriously nice, tart, funky, highly-freshing, musty, lemony, and fruity saison."
""
""
"Orange body - a touch cloudy, active carbonation. Such an awesome beer - the lime comes through in bold fashion and provides a facebending sourness. Blood orange provides a nice citrus flash. Highly unusual and infinitely drinkable. I would love to have some of this to call my own."
""
""
""
""
""
"Brother Soigne is a damn fine saison from Hill Farmstead. There's a really enjoyable rustic quality with the traditional esters, a touch of wildflower like funk, and thirst quenching drinkability. Thanks again for the bottle, Ryan!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D - A nice little beer. Good drinkability. Had no problem with the bottle size. Nice funk presence too and the lime was subtle but enjoyable. Well put together."
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall awesome beer. Great Brett characters that I wasn't expecting, a lot more lime than I expected and a great character from it, nice sourness and tart characters, decent saison base, effervescent, etc. The only real issue I found was that it was a bit too sweet."
""
""
"This is a fantastic saison and as a BA I met in Vermont said, do NOT sleep on Brother Soigne. This is a fantastic saison at a great price point of $10 for a 750ml. I would have bought a lot more than 2 bottles had I realized how good it was."
"The amount of bitter lime and orange flavors in this brew might be overkill for some, but I really enjoyed it. Crisp, refreshing and immensely flavorful, this saison would make for a perfect summer sipper."
"O - Grassroots packs a wallop of rustic flavor into an easy-drinking, low ABV saison for an exceptional take on the style. Lime and blood orange citrus blend beautifully with airy floral aspects and spicy yeast esters, finishing with dry tartness encapsulating this harmonious, unique saison!"
""
""
""
"O- Incredibly drinkable with a flavor profile I could never get sick of, Arthur is my favorite saison, this may be my favorite saison with adjuncts"
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium body with crisp carbonation and a blast of overwhelmingly sour, tart citrus flavor.   There is a ton of lime flavor which almost completely obliterates the farmhouse and saison characteristics.  Intensely dry and puckering citrus flavor, like a few ounces of lime juice was dumped into the bottle.   All lime juice and citrus zest.  Slightly peppery and spicy but after a while, when the palate adjusts, the saison notes very subtly start to show up.  Subtle farmhouse funk, spicy hops and tropical fruit.   Grassy with faint barnyard character but again, the citrus is so strong and overpowering it kills off everything that I enjoy about the style.  Needs balance and has way too much citrus/lime flavor.  Very disappointing.  "
"O - Overall, I loved this saison. Alot. Favorite non barrel done saison from Shaun. Hands down. Just wish the appearance was better. Is this a typical saison? Not even close..but again, it is just delicious. Very Unique and very well crafted."

"overall, this was awesome. juicy tart fruit, bright oak, and 5% make this rule"

"Overall - The lime gives it a tangy finish. Another solid saison from Grassroots."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This very well could be the best saison that I have ever drank. This beer is now a permanent want. Wasnt sure about the lime part of this beer when I was reading the label, but limes in saisons are really good. I also wish that the blood oranges had a bigger role in this beer, but I was really happy with the overall effect of this beer even without the big orange flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very tasty beer with a great mouthfeel. The tartness is moderate. You won't be puckering with each sip."
""
"Cloudy pour, pale straw-yellow color, with about a finger of foamy white head shrizzling down to a thin ringlet; very little lacing, if any at all. Juicy aroma, fresh hops and lots of citrus, stone fruits, yeast. Lots of flavor, lemon-lime, peach, orange, moderately tangy, grassy funk, Belgian yeast, light crackery malts in the background. Didn't get any hibiscus at all, though there were some herbal notes in there. Medium body, prickly carbonation, nice drinkability. Very nice overall, and probably the best offering from Grassroots."

"O-Another knockout out from Greensboro. Their saisons are practically perfect."

"Pours a light orange with creamy white head. Smells of citrus, funk, wheat, and some floral notes. Medium carbonation ,almost creamy body. Taste is zesty lime and orange. Nice refreshing acidity and light bitterness . I really enjoyed this one, quite refreshing on summer time!"
""
""
""
""
"O: A fantastic beer, I was a big fan of the citrus in this beer, would love for HF to make this frequently..or at least again."
""
"D - Great beer. The lime makes it a little different from other offerings I've had from Grassroots and Hill Farmstead, but it carries over the consistently great elements of beers like Art and Anne. Could easily drink a 750ml bottle on my own and would happily drink this again."
""
"This beer is just a step below perfect. Unmistakably a Shaun Hill beer, this is the essence of Saison, bottled. The nose is lively and appetizing, the flavor is crisp and refreshing, and the feel is just spot on in every way. Really an awesome beer all the way around."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Another hit from the HF/Grassroots crew. I drank one about a month after release and I don't remember it being nearly as tart as this, although I think it has improved. That being said, drink it now...this is a simply amazing experience."
""
""
"O - Tart and funky lime and orange with subtle barrel. Very light and crisp and refreshing."
"I would definite recommend try and I would get again if had the opportunity"
""
""
""
""
"M - Medium body. Dry. Moderate carbonation."
""
""
""
"O - My first Grassroots brew, and color me impressed! I knew that Hill Farmstead's influence would ensure that this saison would be good and I was not disappointed. A perfect summer brew for a hot afternoon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Really let this baby warm up to showcase the strengths because this beer doesn't have too many weaknesses. If any. Incredibly delicious stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a phenomenal beer. Quite possibly my favorite non barrel-aged saison from Hill Farmstead. Just delightful."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Everything in this beer is so delicate and well put together, it simply works. Nothing is in your face or overpowering the other flavors. Refreshing, clean and crisp - seek this out."
""
""
""
""
"O- Another good saison from HF/Grassroots. Very unique flavor profile and well put together."
""
""
"O: a fantastic Saison. Has much of that traditional saison quality, with a bit of new influence mixed in. Extremely refreshing, crisp beer. Would absolutely drink this over and over again."
"Zesty citrus aromas of lime and orange, a little bit of yeast complexity, reminded me of Fantome a little bit. Tart fruit flavor, saison base comes through nicely. Again like a Fantome saison, traces of lime and mimosa, finishes dry with lingering complex flavors. Medium bodied but light and easy drinking. Recommended."
""
"O-My preference is still Convivial Suarez, but definitely give this a try."
""
"O~ sooo nice! this is gonna be in my top HF saisons for sure! theres a lot going but you can easily pick out one thing from another. i love how they manage the complexity of their brews. this is seriously solid, saison enthusiasts make sure you seek this one out!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is crisp and drying. Overall, a tasty twist on one of my favorite styles. It may be a bit heavy on the lime at times, but on a hot summer day I could see this being a great refreshing beverage."
