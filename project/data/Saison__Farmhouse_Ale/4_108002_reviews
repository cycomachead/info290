"Tasted a lot like Stella Artois, or like the lines needed cleaning, don't know which"
"I had this from a small sample at a tasting.  I thought it lacked the typical smells and tastes of a farmhouse ale.  Well made just not a saison."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is easy on the eyes, but it's not quite as easy on the tongue. I like the citrus flavors, but the hint of spiciness feels just a touch out of place. This isn't a bad beer, but it's not great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: great saison, in going to buy more of this."
"Excellent session beer. Bright and refreshing."
""
""

"This beer should have a higher rating here on BA than it does. Sure, it's hoppy, but the bitterness contributes to the style, rather than distracts from it. The hops focus the interesting spice. It's definitely Allagash--smell and taste that fruity allagash yeast--but it's also got clove and bubblegum and and loads of prickly pepper and a bit of saison funk underneath. Excellent."
""
""
""
"This beer is overhopped which distracts from the unique taste and wonderfully refreshing finish of a saison.  If you want to pay $15 for four 12 oz. bottles of a good IPA this beer is for you.  Not much of a malt flavor.  Yes it has a 'citrus and a peppery spice' taste but I can get that with an IPA.  I definitely would not describe this beer as 'full bodied'."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Nice saison. Definitely a good option to keep as a staple in the fridge."
""
""
"This is the most recent Allagash I have tried and I was disappointed by it. I have grown accustomed to attaching the name Allagash to the word quality, and there was certainly a disconnect with this beer. In a word, it was ""blah."" A regular beer off the shelf. Again, not what I am used to with an Allagash."
""
""
""
""
"Feel: A little thin but good amount of carbonation."
""
""
"Even for an American interpretation on the style, I found the hops in this saison to be rather overbearing. Otherwise, this seems like an overall solid beer and a welcomed addition to Allagash's year-round portfolio."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a not-appealing version of a saison.  The typical Belgian yeast flavors are over the top and ruined it for me.  Glad I tried it, but will not get again."
""
""
"O: a really nice saison;"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Incredibly light and void of much flavor. I'm surprised too because I heard this was a decent beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Remarkably well-brewed for balance, Allagash Saison is an elegant example of the style that shouldn't be passed by."
"Tasty brew."
""
"Not sure why this doesn't have a higher rating.  If we are rating beers within their category it's clear this Saison is superior to most others."
""
""
"I'm writing this review on what is not only one of the darkest, longest nights of the night but also the coldest so far this winter - stand outside my door and any exposed skin will succumb to frostbite in less than 10 minutes, I guarantee it. And yet Allagash Saison summons in one sip the sun and warmth, the green grass and fragrant flowers, all the joys of spring and summer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  For a beer out of the standard line-up, this is rather impressive; not a top flight Saison but this would go really well with food"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Brooklyn Berg'n on draft.  Way too cold when served.  Became a solid saison with the brewery's distinctive quality; not funky enough to be among the best."
""
""
""
"Overall: Some strong impressions here, but in terms of flavor, the most important aspect, this beer is straining to meet the mark."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I bought this to try a Saison and at first I wasn't crazy about it. Tried to make sure it was in the 55 degree range when serving but I think it got colder than I wanted. Which ended up being a pretty important part of this beer. Both my wife and I thought it was okay, until it warmed up a bit and then it was excellent. My recommendation is to make sure you have it in the 55-65 degree range when drinking, not colder."
""
""
"Overall - Super refreshing and light and delicate.  Nothing groundbreaking but a great summer brew and something to pair well with meals."
""

"Overall- A good Saison from Allagash.  Hell, I haven't had a bad beer experience from this brewer.  Worth a try."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice light golden and hazy color that reminds me of a Belgian golden strong ale. Thick thumb length head that dissipates into a thin white lace that orbits the side of the glass. Aroma is fruity; I detect apples and especially pear as well as honey. Taste is spicy and yeasty with a bitter hops and dry finish. Carbonation is lively and prickly on the tongue. Despite the light color, this ale is quite full bodied. A nice saison that I will have again."
""
""
"O: There's more than enough complexity to keep this beer interesting, but its shining points are its approachabilty and drinkability. While all the hallmarks of the saison style are here, it doesn't stray off in the more musty, funky, or phenolic directions that drive some of the more beloved examples of the style, i.e. Fantome, Dupont, etc. Thats a good thing, as it means the neophyte and veteran beer geek alike can pick this up and find something to like. It's highly quaffable and refreshing to boot. This would be a fine choice year round, but it would make for an especially good summer slugger."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A boilerplate, citrusy saison with big flavours, authentic Belgian character, and excellent drinkability. Great quaff."
""
"O: Very solid saison, recommended"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: A nice saison with a lot of citrus fruit character does with ample amounts of pepper and light phenols. Good but in the second group."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Good, but there are plenty of better saisons out there.  A favorite style of mine, I like to try new variations on it when I can."

"Poured with a huge fine off-white long-lasting head, lots of lace and a hazy yellow color. Aroma is fruit yeast crackers. Flavor is dominated by carbonic Tang and yeast flavors a little fruit, quite bitter only a hint sweet. excellent body. Would've been better overall if the bitterness wasn't overplayed."
""
"Pale straw colored, mildly cloudy. Smells like a Belgian. Highly carbonated, which I like.  I prefer an earthier/peppery-er saison (this one leads lemony, and it's present in the aroma as well), but those flavors come through in the end. Overall a good saison from a wonderful brewery."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a pale gold yellow with a lasting medium white head, some lacing. Aroma of Belgian yeast, wheat, citrus hops. Taste is sweet citrus, wheat, coriander, herbal and spiced hops. Palate is a medium body, crisp with moderate carbonation. Finish is Belgian yeast, bready, citrus, coriander with some good spiced hops for balance. A refreshing, crisp and enjoyable brew to drink overall."
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a solid Saison to drink for a long time."
""
"Not my favorite saison, but serviceable nonetheless. Herbal, grassy, mild, tart citrus, and a bit of funky barnyard. Nice head and beautiful lacing that crowned my tulip glass throughout. Love that."
""
""
""
""
"Amazingly fruity nose with excellent balance full of notes that contain cereal as well as lemon. Have to compliment them on how well the beer is made. The head is flawless and lingers for a long time, very well made. Some other notes of bubblegum on the nose. The taste is beautifully malty with a complex backbone of hop that is so amazingly well done. This has to be one of the most balanced beers I have ever had. A great saison."
"The color is far more hazy than I've ever experienced before, at least in a lighter color ale. I don't find the opacity unappealing or anything, just very interesting."
""
""
""
""
"Very creamy, medium body, medium high carbonation, very easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
"one of my favorite saisons"

"I want another"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mostly good and very little bad in this Saison. There is nothing amazing about this but the flavors are complex, especially as it warms. Very solid beer that I will have again."

"Starting things off with an everyday Allagash that has taken me far too long to try.  It pours a partially hazy golden-brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam.  The nose comprises lemon zest, mild pineapple syrup, coriander, light cracked wheat, Belgian yeast, and a hint of cobweb.  The taste brings in more of the same, my tongue enlivened with strong veins of tropical fruits and mild spice rack denizens.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish.  Overall, a rather tasty saison.  Straight up.  'Nuff said."
""
""
"Very floral and fruity.  I see this as being above average, but I have had better in the style."
""
"Crisp, refreshing, and complex."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one of the most interesting brews I've had in awhile. Pours a big head. Aroma is of citrus and very faintly of yeast. Color is light straw and somewhat hazy. Tastes of tropical fruit and (unsurprisngly) there's hardly any hoppiness to it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Yep!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"(4.0) D: I'd say this is an excellent belgian saison and one that I will continue to keep an eye out for."
""
""
""
""
""
"That's nice. If relaxed is your way to rock saison, Allagash Saison can go on your list."
""
""
"O-drinkable and quenching more like a golden ale than a saison"
"Light, sweet entry. Lemon, (hints of) orange, and apricot. Floral notes near finish along with some detectable hoppy bitterness. Slight yeasty and peppery spiciness. Farmhouse flavors wake up as the brew warms. Dry and slightly tart, wheat finish. Flavors of straw in the finish as well. Nice brew. Easy drinking on a warm day. Solid offering, not spectacular."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, pretty enjoyable.  A touch more citrus than I want and not as much of the yeast character as I like.  I'll drink it if out but hard to buy this instead of Dupont or something in that league while at the beer store."
""
"Overall - Definitely better when warmer, a bit too lemony, but sturdy and farm-house like without too much funk."
"Bright white head, around half a finger and it sizzles off quickly, lacks density, no stick in the lacing but there are broad sheets which slide down the glass sides. Light yellowish liquid, slightly washed out but it has good shine, lots of active bubbles fill the glass, snow globe level fullness. While the nose has some brine and pickled aspects, opens into softer floral notes with sour white citrus and clove, coriander citrus, there is bubblegum but it never quite enunciates strongly, the peach, apricot and curiously pineapple fruit scents crushed into the whole, ends with a yeast, dough elevation. Medium-bodied, the carbonation lives up to its visual impression and churns through the mouth, especially creamy attack. The tangerine, white grapefruit citrus plays a big role. Fewer flowers, more grains and metal shavings, these push back the banana, bubblegum and lees aspects to the end. In the end it is bit too tough minded and lacking in flow, however, the basic elements are there and the funk seems to be managed for maximal approachability by the widest group of imbibers."

"O: This is another well made beer from Allagash. Totally worth checking out."
""
""
""
""
""
"a very generic seeming saison for allagash to be putting out. the only real unique feature of it is its slightly more malt heavy base. the yeast is not the only flavor agent, as the grain is more here than the usual white wheat base. its got some toast and sugar too it, which is nice i think with the very familiar yeast strain in this beer. only a little hazy, and a little more orange than blonde, but somewhere in between. the head is nice on it, but it doesnt last real long. the smell and taste are the some. thin and winey from the yeast. its not as developed or interesting as some, but the sturdy grain base is welcomed. finish is dry and clean, and carbonation is fine but i wish the beer had just a little more body to go with its richer grain character. decent brew overall for sure, but knowing what allagash is capable of, especially in the farmhouse style, this one seems a little bland."

"My first beer from Allagash, once again, go with a craft or smaller local brew and you can't miss. Good Yankee beer."

"I have had this several times, but never in the right vessel, until now. A Duvel, fat tulip glass made the world of a difference. Letting it flow and air out lightly and just right, giving enough head room and letting the saison style breathe. Many saisons I have had were easy in regular beer glasses, but this babe needed a little more TLC. And with that, my appreciation grew."

"Overall, a solid, if not mind-blowing saison. As far as standard (no extra hops, no additives, no souring) saisons go, I'd probably reach for this one over most, but the shelves it sits on are just a bit too far away for me to reach with any regularity. Still, Allagash knows how to do some Belgian styles. I'm a bit surprised the only recently started brewing a saison."

"Nice for a cool summer night on the beach!"
""
""
"Overall, this was an enjoyable, refreshing take on the style that had good flavors that worked well together."
""
"Pours a hazy gold color with a creamy white head. A swirl of the glass rejuvenates the head. Aroma is excellent with plenty of citrus fruit, hay, and strong peppery spice. Pepper comes through in the flavor. Medium bodied with a very dry mouthfeel. Not the most true-to-style saison (it could benefit from a little more funk), but an above average beer from an outstanding brewery."
""
"Good and solid saison. I wouldn't expect anything less from this brewery."

"Overall: This beer is a stand out example of a Saison. It is a true benchmark for its respective beer style. It is also an easy to aquire shelf beer that is reasonably priced. A very, very under rated saison in my personal opinion. Allagash really knocked this beer out of the park; its a home run! Allagash Saison is running on all cylinders: It smells really really good. The flavor is balanced and complex. The mouthfeel is pretty exceptional. Its a classy beer that is a great stand alone on hot day to quench your thirst or a perfect companion for snacking with cheese & crackers or your beer to go with a full course meal. I am definately grabbing another 4 pack of this beer very soon because the other 3 bottles from the 4pack will not last very long."

""
""
"A solid American take on a Saison. Well worthwhile"
""
""
"This was quite a disappointment coming from Allagash. I enjoy the vast majority of their beers and assumed this would be no different, but I was sadly mistaken. It's not bad, but it's a mere shadow of what it could (and should) be considering the pedigree."

"Overall- Allagash does it again! Like their White and their Dubbel, their Saison is perfectly in style and hard to improve upon"
""
""
""
""
"The pour was a nice very hazy gold with a nice fizzy head that stuck to the glass. The smell had really nice malt and wheat with a bite from the hops. The taste was very dry in the beginning with hints of spice and wheat cut through for the finish. The moutfeel was very nice for the summer. I'll probably pick up another 4 pack before it's gone."

"On tap at ACBF. This was a bright golden colour with a nice tight white lacing, bright florals with a very nice yeasty character coming through, body is full and very balanced, I was thoroughly impressed with this and would seek it out again. Strong take on the style, nice bright citrus character balanced with a yeasty spiciness."
"O - really nice and refreshing saison. I knew it was going to be good, and it came through and delivered. I will buy this again, and I'm actually looking forward to another one!"
""
""
"Picked this one up as part of a mixed 6 at Ye Ole Spirits. Outstanding appearance on the beer, a little thin in color but great head that grabbed the glass. Nailed the taste, smooth and easy to drink, a very good saison if not overly interesting, actually surprised that it was over 6%. I enjoyed this beer very much and hope to have this beer many times in the future."
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
"As a ""hoppy summer Saison," Allagash has done a good job. Similar to Stone's take, but superior."
""
""
""
"Not the most flavorful brew but this is an easy drinking beer that'd go great with any meal. A go to during the summer time for sure."
""
"Overall (4.25/5): Allagash Saison is an extremely solid example of the saison style, though quite traditional despite the use of more assertive, citrusy American hops. (Some may say just a little too ""safe"". To that barb I retort: MY LEVEL OF CONCERN IS AT ZERO.) Allagash has created of beer of exceptional balance–its tart citrus, peppery spice, herbal, and grassy flavors work in concert to produce a decently complex flavor profile. And all of these flavors are complemented by the excellent carbonation level, smooth feel, and dry finish. Very enjoyable even though it does not push boundaries."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall not too bad, but sort of not that memorable either."
""
""
"Very good brew that is mostly saison but has some wild ale characteristics. Not sure of it is as good a pure saison as Ommegangs Hennepin."
""
"This is a classic of the style that is worth a taste for the education of it, but I think the drinkability suffers. From the 12 oz bottle purchased at Bine & Vine in San Diego."
""
""
""
"D - A rather enjoyable Americanized saison... Outstanding appearance and aroma, but the rest is a bit rough around the edges... Not bad my any means, but there are several other excellent Saisons that are easily obtained..."

"O: This is a well done saison without frills. I could see this being a semi-regular in my fridge - it's refreshing and easy to drink yet satisfyingly flavorful. Nice work, Allagash: the world needs more readily available and inexpensive(ish) saisons not named Hennepin or Tank 7."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An overall great saison that's juicy, yet dry."
""
""
"O - An plausible effort from Allagash. Not the best, but not a bad 4 pack to have in the fridge."
""
""
""
""
""
"12 oz bottle. Pours hazy golden with tall, long lasting, fluffy white head and nice lacing. Aroma is of funky yeast, bready malt, wheat and some floral hops. Body is full and crisp. Herbal hops, funky yeast, pale malt and citrus fruit fill the mouth. Finish is long and bitter. Nice session brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I tend to always enjoy Allagash's bottled offerings and this is no exception. I would not necessarily seek this out but it's a good example of the style and very enjoyable on a summer evening."
""
""
""
"o: Fantastic domestic saison, as expected."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall;  good, great for warm weather but drinkable all year. very likable."
""
"O: Easy to drink and refreshing - a great beer for the early summer when you are not yet used to the heat (at least here in NC). Very nice flavors and complexity though I could have enjoyed a little more funk."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not my favorite Allagash by a long shot, nor is this close to my favorite Saison. I'm usually a fairly big fan of Allagash, but this one just didn't hit the sweet spot for me. As advertised, it's quite herbal- and I think therein is the crux of the problem. It's simply too herbal. One dimensionally herbal. Herbal without a balancing citrus, or white pepper, or funk component. I like my Saisons a little more balanced, and with something a touch sour or peppery (or both) to balance them. Fantome comes to mind as one that does that well with virtually all of their Saisons- a nice balance of citrus (or funk, or both) and herbal notes- often with a peppery accent. This Allagash Saison is all herbs with just a watery slightly sour aftertaste. It lacks crispness on the finish and interest throughout. A disappointment."
""
"O- A fine example of a saison but not one that I have come to prefer. I prefer a cleaner, tarter and less sweet type of saison. This is way too sweet for me."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Super solid saison. Not a standout by any means but a great sessionable non-brett non-funky saison."
"O:Very standard, or rather true to the style. Wonderfully crafted. This is par for the course from Allagash, of course their handicap means few others can strike like this. Nothing about this beer feels out of balance. Very drinkable, and consistently enjoyable. Will definitely drink again."
""
"O- A bit more dry and bitter than I like in a saison. Overshadowing that tangy bite. The aromatics in this one were really great however."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall pretty good, bit too much on the lemon rind and spicy bitterness, not enough esters or funk IMO, but that's just how I like the saisons, not bad though."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A nice clean saison. Not overly yeasted and a nice earthy tart balance. Good stuff that I would love to stock the fridge with."
""
""
""
"Overall, this was a good beer. If the flavor was a bit stronger and lasted longer on the palate, it would have received higher marks."
""
"O-It's almost too standard for its own good but very well made. It's not super cheap and it's only a four pack but I will probably buy this again. I was very pleased with this brew."
""
""
"Overall: A nice addition to the Allagash lineup. I'll have a few more of these in the near future."
""
"Overall, another excellent offering from Allagash. It'll be nice to have another widely available and affordable saison on the shelves along sides the likes of Hennepin and Tank 7."
""
""
""
""
"Another artfully crafted beer by Allagash, these guys can do no wrong with Belgian styles. Bold yeast presence was a bit more funky and musty than I expected, covers the crisp fruit and spices. Very dry and refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tasty beer. It could be a bit drier for the style, and certainly could use some Brett for some complexity."
""
"The taste has many of the same toasted biscuit and citrus flavors as the nose implies with the added evolving bitterness that ends dry."
""
""
""
""

""
"A very good saison from Allagash. I like my a bit drier and a bit more funky but it has nice balance."
""
""
""

"A spicy and slighty smoky saison."
""
"O: I believe this s going on my repurchase list. I liked it almost as much as Tank 7 but in comes in with a bit lower ABV and that is a plus (for this aging BA)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: This is a really nicely done Saison that should work very well on a porch on a warm summer day."
"A dry and slightly bitter beer on the finish with nice touches of fruit flavor. A really refreshing brew with complex, yet light flavors. Wonderful for easy drinking and food pairing. This will also work for beginners attempting to expand to other beers."
""
""
""
"O: This beer is easy to drink and has some refreshing properties. It would make for a good beer for the summertime."
""
"Nice mouthfeel, dominated by the spice. Enjoyable. I will buy this again. Nice 4 pack."
"It is a beer I can get regularly, but will probably pick up on occasion as it is smooth, flavorful and deep in taste. Pretty solid beer from Allagash"
""
"overall quite a nice beer. not amazing, but good!"
"Although not a session beer technically, the alcohol was low enough and not very noticeable that I could have had another in my sitting, had I not been in a place with tons of good offerings on tap. This was great at having the sugar and spice of a Belgian beer with a fair amount of American hops, making it a hybrid of sorts. Tasty and unoffensive, this was something that I enjoyed and would love to see brewed more, since it was unique enough to stand out amongst the Hefe's and Belgian Whites that are so popular this time of the year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Good warm-weather beer. Would have another."
"I thought this beer to be pretty good but dominated much to much with their yeast strain."
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy light golden color with a smallish white head that dissipates almost instantly. Aromas of lemon and pepper with a light honey and hints of tropical and citrus fruit. The flavor is honey like malt sweetness up front followed by a bit of earthy funk and spice. Lingering sweet, bitter and pepper on the finish. Medium body with a spirited level of carbonation and a tongue piercing bubbly mouthfeel. Not a bad beer, but not my favorite. In my opinion the hops are a bit too forward here and compete rather than enhance the flavors of a saison."
""
""
""
"Overall, really great Saison. This'll be nice to have available year-round!"
""
"Cheers and thanks Allagash!"
""
""
""
"O: I'm surprised it took Allagash this long to put out a year-round saison. Regardless, this is a solid brew just in time for the warmer weather. Nice and easy to drink, and quite refreshing. Definitely worth trying if you're into Allagash"

"Pours a clear light yellow with a foamy off-white head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, earth, pepper, spice, and fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with Belgian yeast, spice, and pepper flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of yeast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a Belgian yeast presence that is more prominent in the taste."

"Golden straw colored beer, evenly and softly hazy. Head is large, tight and soapy looking. Stringy lace squiggles hang around. Aroma is flowery, sweet, bubble gum, soft spice, smooth easy lemon. Fragrant, phenolic, soapy, generally happy and calming aromas. Taste is loaded with floral sweet softness as well. Light bitterness and fine, even carbonation stir things up. Slightly dry as well. Flavors are very well integrated together. Bubble gum, lemon candy, mild sprinkling of sugar cookie, rosy kind of floral. Very nice. I get sick of the various off versions of this style but Allagash hit it just right. They remind me that I do like Saisons."
"Hazy golden yellow under a decently high pure-white head. Aromas of fruity yeast esters, slight anise, flowers, hay, zesty citrus, peppery phenolics - basically a textbook, no-frills Saison aroma. Peppery, spicy citrus, lots of yeast, slight fruitiness, earthy hops. No added spices, no barrel aging, no Brett, Allagash just brews a standard Saison and lets the yeast do the talking. Quite dry, moderately carbonated, finishing with a mild tartness. Nice..."

"O- Tasty if not a bit typical. A nice session saison that would really be a winner if the price was a bit lower."
