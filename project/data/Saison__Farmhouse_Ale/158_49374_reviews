"Mouthfeel is light and creamy feeling, with light zesty carbonation, a medium body and a slightly tart bitterness that washes down and leaves a grainy/earthy sweetness. It’s not the boldest or the funkiest, but it’s very good, a nice version of this style and one I would definitely have again."
""
""
""
"Fruity, medium to thick body, earthy to funky, banana, pears and apricot flavor. One of my favorite Saison, hint of pepper, but amazing Saison. Top 5 for your palette in this catagory for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy golden with a medium off-white head.  Smells of lemon and some sour grain.  Taste begins with a tart citrus, then a mild grain, and finishing with an herbal, phenolic flavor.  Mouthfeel is pretty good.  Overall a pretty good Saison, a bit funkier than I prefer though."
""

"Very earthy, just what you would expect from a farmhouse ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"Did not care for this beer at all"
""
""
""
"Mild flavor, little tartness, almost citrusy"
"Overall:  This is an ok beer.  I love the aroma, but the flavor was mot than a little off-putting."
"Really mediocre. Not very carbonated, flavor is off though more bleh than really bad. None of the spicy or fruity flavor you want, just some slightly weird yeast."
""
""
""
""
"Delicious. Nice alcohol content and flavour."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It has a really interesting color to it, really thick for a farmhouse ale. The smell was a bit off putting, almost a sour, but the taste is fantastic in combination. And there's a very fine citrus coating on the tongue afterwards, which is not unpleasant."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's alright. Smooth with a light taste.. Good color and smell"
""
"Overall a good beer."
"Pours Pale hazy straw with hints of pink grapefruit. Small head that fades quick. Mild yet pleasant aroma of bananas and clove surrounded by strong wheatiness.  Flavor has strong yeast presence with more banana and spices. Moderate carbonation that fades pretty quick. An enjoyable saison that would probably be even better with a slightly higher amount of carbonation."

"Brewer doesnt let me down here. Suitably complex and developing as it comes to cask temperature. Must try."
"It's got a nice spice to it that isn't overpowering and lights up the flavor buds on my tongue.  Excellent beer!"

"O. This is a very good rendition of a Saison Farmhouse ale. I recommend drinking Colette while eating bratwurst with sauerkraut. The problem about this beer review is me, I personally think Saison’s taste like rusty rebar dipped in a batter of yeast. Good buzz for only 7.3% ABV."

"Cloudy light gold pour with a small white head. Aroma has light notes of yeast, grain and clove. Taste has funk, lemon, yeast and banana upfront backed by a a nice clove flavor. Can also taste some biscuit and a hint of bitterness. Light to medium body with light carbonation. Finishes with tastes of lemon and light clove lingering for a bit."

"Had this on tap in 12oz snifter.  Smell is sweet, fruity, and dry.  First thing I notice with the taste is belgian yeast twang that of what you'd get in a belgian tripel.  The yeast calms down as it warms up and develops a nice spice/pepper flavor which pairs nicely with the citrus/pineapple/bright fruit flavors  .  Overall this is a really nice saison with the refreshing fruity characteristics that is making me start to enjoy the style alot more.  The funky yeast can be the hardest part of enjoying this style, but the yeast here mellows out nicely, so I 'd definitely recommend this to people who are on the fence for the style. (89/100)"

"Saison is a pretty open style, but I generally expect more phenols as well as more hops. All the best examples have that."
"Overall: I just bought a single bottle of this, and I'm glad. It's a fine brew, but I wouldn't want this very often."

"O: If it were a bit less hefty-feeling, this would easily be right there with Dupont. As it stands, it's still a very good saison - one that ranks very highly among the 'Murican examples, in fact. Plus, it's in six packs. A rock-solid saison in six packs? Damn right I'll be all over it."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I like the lightness in everything about this beer. Nothing is overpowering, which presumably makes it a well balanced beer. I will definitely grab this for a change of pace, but it won't be in the regular rotation."

""
""
"O:  great beer.  Would buy again."

"Bottle bought from chucks in seattle. Bottled on May 27 2014. Thin white head that fades immediately.  Smells of biscuit malt, sweet, earthy with a hint of spice. Tastes bready, with a dry spicy finish. Good example of a saison but there is a flavor that I can't quite put my finger on which sticks out and makes it less tasty than others. I'd like more hop character on the finish."

"O: I am a big fan. I love farmhouse ales and this one does not disappoint. A stellar beer in my opinion."
""

"Great Divide's take on the Farmhouse Ale is not disappointing. It has strong hints of fruit, especially citrus. On the initall taste i was very impressed, great feel on the mouth and not too hoppy. I would rate this higher, but for me it got a little bitter on my last few sips. Still a very good brew though."
"O- I've only recently started my journey into Saisons, and this one definitely helped guarantee I would keep going. I loved the contrasting effects of spicy, sweet, earthy hop, and sour in this one. The flavors morphed and mixed wonderfully from beginning to end."
""
""
""

""
""

""

""
"O: I love the aroma, so subtle and inviting. The flavor profile is very complex, but everything is distinct and works together and each note is distinguishable and complements the others. This is a flavor symphony. The beer drinks easily. This American incarceration of a classic Belgian style rivals the best Belgians...and outshines many. This is truly an awesome beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: just an excellent, easily drinkable, refreshing, and delicious farmhouse ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A nice saison, perfect for a hot summer day. Nothing I'd go out of my way for, but I could see myself putting away quite a few of these during a BBQ if Great Divide were to get distribution in Sacramento."

""
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer to drink for a long time if you’re in the mood for the style."
""
"Poured a cloudy golden color with a thin white head that dissipated quickly. It looks pretty good, though more head would be nice. Scents of banana, honey, earthy yeast, wheat, citrus peel, mango, pineapple and floral hops. A rich, bright, fruity aroma with a good yeasty character as well. Quite nice. Flavor begins nicely sweet with spicy, funky Belgian yeast, moving into a more sour funk, with notes of citrus, pineapple, honey and wheat malt. The finish is spicy, with notes of coriander and some floral notes. Aftertaste is floral and spicy, with coriander notes. A very good, relatively complex flavor profile, very much a Belgian and a solid example of a saison. Very well executed. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with moderate, prickly carbonation and a semi-drying feel. Very good and true to form for a saison. Overall this is a good saison. Great Divide managed to make a saison with a good deal of complexity, a nice flavor and aroma profile and good mouthfeel. A truly excellent beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - a brew with outstanding character and at a fairly good price!"
""
""
""
""
"Final thought - 7%+ and only $2 a bottle, just try it"
""
""
""
"It's finally spring, so it was time to get the first saison of the year. This is a bit strong, but also very good; at 7.3% abv, it's not something I'll adopt as my summer beer of choice, but was a good call to have with dinner. Very happy with the beer, but it's certainly, as Great Divide says, their interpretation of the style rather than an authentic one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a well-executed higher ABV saison with enough flavor to keep it interesting, but not really enough to wow you."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A nice farmhouse ale, but the astringency knocks it out of balance. Could use a bit of hop flavor rather than just bitter. Still, pretty refreshing and quaffable. I will not have trouble drinking this six pack and would gladly accept another. would even order a pint when at the brewery."
""
"O - A solid ale with good qualities. An easy drinker that satisfies and refreshes. Not as strong as Great Divide's Yeti series, but still enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from bottle into pint glass. Very light amber/orangy color with almost no head. Nice stone-fruit aroma (peach?) with a little yeasty funk. Taste is very similar but with added citrus and nice tartness and juicy mouthfeel. All around good beer, would recommend."
""
""
""
""
"Awesome that my 100th beer is a farmhouse ale, and one that tastes almost identical to the farmhouse ale at Carters in Billings MT, which was the first beer style I found myself getting into early in my beer career. In case you've never had a good farmhouse, it tastes sort of sweetly tart, mild in body and flavor but oh so refreshing. Pairs great with meals since it won't overpower much, but still strong enough to stand alone. Smell is wonderful too, intoxicating. Cheers!"

"Stable saison. Flavor is spot-on to style. Peppery yeast, pith, wheaty twang, hints of tropical fruits. Some floral notes. Perhaps, white tea. A bit huffy in carbonation. Body feels right, if not close to average. Lacks complexity, but delivers as a solid craft saison. Would drink again, but not seek it out to do so. Let it land on my lap."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer was a terrific surprise. It has a body that is so much more than you were expecting but doesn't give way to syrup or to heaviness. It's terribly sweet but has a lightness that seems puzzling. As it warms the spice comes to the nose and really makes this complex."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not impressed. Maybe it would be better on a hot summer day. The complexity it has takes it away from style, and into a unwelcomed direction"

"the beer is hazy and straw to golden hued with a quarter inch of white head. the aroma offers malt, grass, light spice, coriander, pepper. Medium bodied and malty, with a bit of a harsh / aggressive hop punch toward the finish. Pepper and alcohol, citrus, lemon. A bit unrefined. Not bad, but lacking the elegant complexity and/or drinkability I was seeking."

"O- a really nice interpretation of the farmhouse style."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not bad, the dirty coriander note (whether from the fermentation character or actual coriander) is a touch too much. I do like the texture that this beer has, it is nice without being too heavy."
"I compare all farmhouse ales to Oxbow’s farmhouse pale, criticize my benchmark all you want but it’s a near perfect beer. The ""Colette"" is nearly as good, i’m very happy with the aroma and taste, it represents the style quite well. I wish it was more readily available."

"Overall - a tiny bit sweeter than I like from a saison, but a very nice blend of complex tropical fruit flavors. Not quite as drinkable as it could be due to the sweetness, but overall an excellent beer."

"Have to get back into Great Divide, it has been a while."
""
""
""
"Bottle  Appearance: Hazy straw with a quickly disappearing white foamy head.  Aroma: Yeast, sulfur  Taste: Lively mouthfeel, thin body, starts a bit start, but finish and aftertaste is slightly sweet fruit.  Palate: The fruity finish is really unique... starts like a pretty standard saison, but the finish is a real kicker.  Overall:"
""

"Overall- A saison that leans towards more savoury then sweet notes. Still enjoyable nonetheless."

"This is a good beer, but really not a great saison. It's too sweet, and lacks the refreshing, crisp dryness that is a major draw of Saisons. This is kind of more like a Belgian Pale Ale blended with a Tripel with some hints of a Saison."
""
""
"Appearance - Pile yellow with a white head. Smell - Wheat, belgin yeast and a little citrus. Taste - Pineapple, citrus and a nice saison funk. Mouthfeel - Medium body. Carbonation is very nice . Overall - Really enjoy this beer. A good beer for a nice sunny day."
""
""
""
"Overall-Tastes like a summer day. Hooray summer!"
""
""
"This is one beer in which it can be argued whether the use of rice benefits the mouthfeel or not. It does make it smoother, but this is a style in which I hope for a crisper bite. There is crispness, but the smoothness seems to be the main focus in the addition of rice. The body is fluffy and rests right on the light edge of medium."

"O: bitterness from the wheat and tartness from the yeast and acid blend well. Not my favorite style but pretty good for what it is."
""
"O: Colette is an outstanding American version of farmhouse ale -- clean grain and bread maltiness with fruity yeast esters finished with lemon citrus and the righ punch of dryness. Yet another reason I am sad that GD is no longer in my neck of the woods in VA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Enjoy it with some spicy Mexican food!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A pretty nice take on the Saison style. Good use of spices and yeast. On the tarter side but good."
""
""
""
"Overall: I've never had a bad beer from Great Divide, and this one continues the trend. If you like saisons, this is worth a try."
""
""
"O - the aroma was a bit strange and unappealing. The flavor was enjoyable. Fruity and slightly tart. Good, light summertime beer, but not a great Saison."
"O - Sweet candy sugar is a nice finish, but becomes a little too sweet by the end of the drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Decent. Solid farmhouse/Belgian hybrid profile. A bit sweet overall, but the finish is on point."
""
""
"Overall, this one is one great beer. A definite must try and one I wouldn't mind keeping stocked in my fridge. A super complex beer I wouldn't mind having on any summer evening."
""

"Overall, pretty psyched to have this one again. This is a real nice one from Great Divide."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (3.5/5): Colette is an okay saison, but there seems to be something missing. Perhaps I got a bad sixer, but what really is lacking here is carbonation. I feel that the lack of carbonation really mess with what could be a much better drinking beer than the one I am currently holding."
""
""
""
"O: Good good good."
""
""
""
""
"A good example of the style though I'd like/prefer the abv to be a bit lower."
"O-A pretty good saison. Not my favorite style, but it represents a saison pretty well."
""
""
""
""
"O- A nice saison with very clean flavors, just wish it was a little drier and less boozy."
""
""
""
""
"O: About what I expect out of a six-pack saison; tasty and refreshing, but nothing real special. Would be great for someone who enjoys a lighter saison."
""
"Not a huge fan of the style, but if you're going to try one, this would be a good choice."
""
""
"I am surprised (and excited) that this is a 6-pack! Another job well done by GDBC."

""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, one of the better farmhouses I've had. I'm not a big fan of the style, mainly because of the overwhelming spices, but this one is sufficiently complex with other flavors to distract me. Give it a try, it could be a good introduction to a style that may not be your favorite."
"O: it's a great beer, refreshing, light citrus and spice, fresh wheat... Takes me to a summer BBQ with bright blue skies, cool breeze and wheat fields. Lovely, fresh, light, kitchen, gingham red and white, summer breeze, swinging on a tire swing great feeling... Very pleased with this beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
"It pours a very beautiful, very hazy gold with a white head. head retention is poor, but the lacing is nice while it lasts. Enticing aromas of citrus zest and ginger entice the nose with hints of grass and a strong underying yeastiness. The taste is very yeasty with some spiciness. A slight sour funk follows the taste all the way through to the finish. The finish has a lot of lemon zest as well. The mouthfeel is lighter than I had expected and it dries the mouth out a bit. The carbonation, however, is perfect. Not too much or too little. Overall, I was very happy with this beer."
"O – Good surprise as I typically don't care for the style; this is bright, refreshing and full of flavor, without a ton of crazy overpowering yeastiness."
"Notes: Very drinkable good to enjoy anytime of year and the dry finish is very better. Cheers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Could use a bit better mouthfeel, but overly a very accesible saison."
"Overall, a very drinkable farmhouse ale. I'd especially recommend this as a first foray into the style for someone who maybe isn't certain about it. There are others I would drink first, but I like a bit more funk and a touch of hop-bitterness. I think this would be a good one for an outdoor, summer setting."
""
""
"O - 6er recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- I wasn't particularly impressed by this beer when I first purchased the six pack back in May or so, but a second take has convinced me this beer is worth revisiting. It's mellowed out significantly, and the aggressive funky/estery/dusty aromas and flavors I remember have taken on a subtler and more balanced feel. Nice. Worth trying either way, but I'd recommend giving it six months or so."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is really nice. The blending is outstanding. I've had some that are fruitier, and I like those too, but this one shines for its complexity and blending of flavors."
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer seems to have more malts and sweetness (similar to a tripel) compared to other beers in the style, but it is still relatively easy to drink."
"O-There are so many other saisons out there. Balance isn't where it should be, no spices."
"O: Not bad. Lots of spice, which I enjoy, but other than that is doesnt do a whole lot for me. Its certainly belgium influenced, but I don't see it falling into the saison style. Maybe more along the lines of a very spice belgium pale or a not very good tripel. Overall, it was a decent drink, but I likely wouldn't have one again."

"This is a rather refreshing Saison. It has a nice citrusy, fruity flavor that is balanced and enjoyable. It's also easy to drink. I will probably pick this up again."
""
"O - An excellent saison. I will be purchasing this one again. Impressed with another one of Great Divide's beers"
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip glass, bottled on March 23, 2012. This pours a hazy straw light yellow color with a short lived off white head which quickly dissipates. The smells are nice lots of sweet yeast esters, a little funk, some earthy tones, good stuff. The feel is medium high carbonation. The taste is great nice fruit yeast esters a dry finish some earthy flavors good stuff."
""
""
""
"A weird girl, this Colette. The overbearing fruits and odd tang make me think it’s not really to style. Not my favorite GD brew."
""
""
""
"Overall, Colette is an interesting beer that seems like a good introduction to farmhouse ales for me. This is definitely a unique style, but it's also not my favorite at this point. However, I wont hesitate to try other farmhouse ale/ saisons in the future."
""
""
""
"Overall I really like this beer. Glad I bought the sampler pack."
""
""
""
"Pours a murky yellow with a 1 inch foamy white head that settles to a thin cap on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain, rice, yeast, and spice. Taste is of grain, citrus fruit, citrus zest, yeast, and spices on the finish. There is a mild spice bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer flavor wise but the aroma is a bit of a letdown in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A nice standard saison. It isn't expecitional in any one way but it represents the style very well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a hazy lightly dirty yellow color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of light funky yeast notes with light rustic malt with a subtle sour finish. Taste is also a mix between some light funky notes with some light tart notes and some light rustic malt. Light residual sugar is also discernable. Body is quite full with great bottle conditioning and good carbonation. Not the most complex example of the style but well brewed for something that is most likely brewed on a very large scale."
""
""
"Overall a real refreshing and nice saison. Hardly booze either at 7.3 percent too."
"I know a lot of these things are typical for the style, but I wasn't a huge fan. That said, it's not a terrible beer, just not a favorite."

"O: A very impressive offering. Wonderful flavor, complex, and enjoyable to drink. It goes well with food to boot. I highly recommend if you enjoy saisons or unfiltered beers."
""
"Light to medium bodied. Flows easily over the tongue and refreshes. Very high carbonation, tart and dry finish."
""
""
"Smoother than some low ABV saisons I've had. Can't complain there."
"Served from tap into a Trappe Door tulip. Poured a bright hazy yellow with a two finger white head that subsided to half a finger slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, banana, fruit, spices, wheat, and grain. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, banana, spices, wheat, and grain. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. While this one was quite refreshing, it was also not very memorable at the same time. Nothing on this one really stood out and tried to grab your attention which was a bit of a letdown for me. Drinking this one out by the pool on a hot summer day might be enjoyable, but if you are looking for something to enjoy complexities on, I would go with something else unless you are into that."

"Simply refreshing, and simply a delight. I knew Colette would be a reasonable choice for this late afternoon, but I didn't expect it to be so easy. It looks that Great Divide can also do that Belgian thing too."
"Great Divide Collette Farmhouse Ale: Bright golden color, nice creamy head and a big aroma of Belgian hops invite you to take a sip. The flavor transports you to, well not a Belgian farmhouse, but rather a Belgian abbey. The Collette is a lighter Belgian Trippel in by view, and a good one at that. The flavor is a pleasant floral sweetness infused with distinctive Belgian yeast and a bit of a chalky finish. Call it what you will, but anyway the Collette is another great beer from Great Divide."
"O- Drinkable for the style, which I am usually not fond of."

"O/D-A solid Saison. I prefer my Saisons to be funkier and more tart. This is pretty legit however. I only bout a single but this runs around $12.25 for a six pack in my area. Quite overpriced. Still decent."
""

"Overall (3.5): I love the fact that you can get a decent saison in a sixer without paying an arm and a leg, but it also doesn’t really hold its own against the really good examples of the style. Also, the appearance is really a bummer. I wanted to like this more, but for my money I’d rather spend a little more and get something I’ll only have once in a while . . . still waiting for that great saison in affordable 12oz bottles (other than Hennepin, which for the record I do enjoy quite a bit :-)"

"M: enjoyable carbonation that is pleasant in the mouth."
"overall: nice summer-y beer, though not a real standout"
""
""
""
""
""

"Drinkability: A good and simple saison, the taste has a little complexity. I'm liking the saison, wheat, and white beers this spring."
""
"D - Rather good actually. The individual pieces combine to make an excellent saison."
""
""
""
"O - while it sure is refreshing it is sort of one dimensional. Nose is dominated by funk and citrus. Taste is essentially the same. I will do an updated review as it is a cold night and I just might not be in the mood for this style. But as of now its good but not quite what I was expecting from Great Divide."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall this was a very enjoyable light summer saison and definitely a beer that would go down well on a warm afternoon/evening. I found this one to be quite easy to drink and worth getting another."
"Very pale, hazy yellow appearance, and a lot of carbonation gave this look a bit of a macro vibe, but the lemon zest and orange peel on the nose indicated that this was not one of the mass produced swill. The taste was pretty timid for a Saison, with flavors of lemon, simple sugar, and white pepper coming across each light and refreshing sip. The ABV felt nowhere near 7.3%, and the body was soft and airy. Very refreshing, but left me longing for more depth."
""
""
"O- The first saison to make me realize I love the style."
""
""
"Tart apple and pear with a touch of tropical fruit up front. Some medicinal flavors around mid palate, enough just to balance the sweetness, coupled by a spicy grassy yeast presence and a bright clean finish. Sour, yet subdued, fruity yet dry, complex yet pleasant. An overall fantastic and complex beer with incredible layers of flavor, perfect for spring, the only thing i could ask is for a bit less phenolic flavors. Otherwise, nothing less than great from Great Divide."
""
""
""
"It tastes more like a lot of wheat beers and that's an improvement. The burp is yummy. I will continue to avoid the style, but I don't regret geting this one."
""
"Overall - Very well done, lots of fruits and sugars, and a little alcohol. Smooth, easy to drink and a pleasure to drink. Excellent springtime ale."
"O: Overall I love this beer. I can crush a six pack in a matter of minutes. It's ridiculously drinkable and refreshing but in the end it'll get you drunk if you pound it back like I do."
"Pours a sandy whitish yellow with a slight white head. Aroma is strongly belgian yeasty with some spiciness and pepper, sweet but bright lemon, and some wheat. Flavor pretty much followed suit. A medium bodied, active, creamy mouthfeel. Overall, a nice beer but held back a little because its one I could only enjoy in moderation. My 16 oz pour was the perfect amount, I couldn't drink any more."
""
""
"Overall this is an enjoyable one. Doesn't blow me away nor turn me away. Easy to drink and I would love to try on draft."
"nope. this one pours a thick hazy yellow color like a lemon, with yeast floaters and a small white head. smells really yeast, and not nice wild yeast like a lot of other saisons, but like rotting citrus fruit and shampoo. that said, there is some element of refreshing aromas, but the yeast spoils it for me. flavor is not bad, tart and crisp lemon notes, mild spice, and some crystal malt body. not sure how this one got so far off track, but the feel is not nice either. way way to thick and heavy for the style. this is supposed to be a crisp drinkable early summer beer, but it fails to serve that purpose. this might be my least favorite great divide beer so far, which is unfortunate. i had really high hopes for this one, as i am huge on the saison/farmhouse style, but this was a real letdown. might be better from the bottle rather than the tap?"
""
"O: This is a good American saison. The yeast and malt profile are right on. This beer is also dry and slightly fruity, as it should be. One of my favorites when spring rolls around."
"Notes: Medium in body with good depth and flavor. Very well-balanced. Mouthfeel is a bit thick, but manageable. Overall, a tasty farmhouse brew, and a solid offering from Great Divide."

"My Beer Rating: 4.0"

"Overall, I'm glad to have finally found this. To think it was in the store I frequent most just being hidden in the back of the cooler. After a year or so, it's drinking nice. I haven't had the fresh, or any really old stuff, but I'd imagine that it's only going to get better."

"Golden color with tons of white head and lots of lacing down the side of the glass. Very nice smell that is somewhat difficult to describe. Lemons are present. Earthy smell as well. The Taste is citrus and earthy as well. Mild bitterness. Very smooth and nicely carbonated. This is very good and easy to drink."

"O - Good representation of the style, excellent session brew."
"Mouthfeel is smooth. A touch of alcohol in the back, fruity in the front. Very interesting and pleasant. I look forward to another glass."
"The beer pours a hazy yellow color with a white head. The aroma is full of Belgian yeast, with some lemon and white pepper notes. Overall, it smells about like a saison is supposed to smell. The flavor is also typical saison. I get a lot of yeast and pepper, as well as some biscuit malt. There is a little bit of light funk in the flavor. The beer is very dry. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Overall: A very good beer. It surpassed what I was expecting. I will buy this one again. I'd recommend at least giving it a try, even if it isn't your favorite style."
"O: Unlike other funky or tart Saisons. For me this is almost Hefeweizen like in taste. Either-way a nice refreshing beer."
"O- overall a pleasant beer. Easy drinker and a nice all-around beer, but a bit off from the norms of the style to rate well. Look forward to revisiting at some point"
"This is a really solid, flavorful farmhouse alee"
"thats what i think of when i think farmhouse ale. it has good carbination.the taste is sour but more tart. it has a solid appearance and good nose. theres a reason its a silver medal winner @ GABF 2010. if you enjoy farm house ales/sours try it for yourself and see!"
"While this isn't the best example of the style that I've had, this was quite enjoyable and had I not seen the bottle, I wouldn't have guessed who brewed this. Someone who has never tried this style before would be wise to start here - this isn't too overpowering and is a textbook example of what a good Saison/Farmhouse should be, since the funky and spicy notes are absent here. I'd certainly have this again!"
"O: A really great saison. I found this to be a fantastic beer."
"This is my summer 2011 favorite every-day ale."
"O: Very good Saison. Great choice for warmer weather."
"Flavor is sweet and crisp, with hints of citrus, fruits, and spice. There's a slight hoppy bitterness at the finish. Very tasty and full of flavor."
"Highly carbonated as I'd want a summer beer, pleasant that way."
"Overall, Colette is a good beer. It grew on me the more I drank. Its not exceptional, but a solid homage to saisons like the label explains."
"Overall - I really don't have much to say positive about this beer. I'm going to try to drink the whole thing but its a borderline drainpour to me. I definitely won't buy this again. The other Great Divide beers have been well crafted. This one seems way off mark to me."
"Overall Impression- Tons of fruit and malt character but too much carbonation and light attributes. I like a ton of flavor and character to Saisons and this one just didn't pop. I will give it good overall ratings because this is a well brewed beer but I just can't rate it better than any of the Fantome's or other Saisons from top breweries. Would definitely enjoy again if seen in a 6-pack."
"12 ounce bottle into tulip, bottle March 3, 2011. Pours hazy golden amber color, with a fairly dense 2 finger white head with great retention that reduces to a thin lacing cap. A bit of lacing clings to the glass as well. Aromas of huge grass, lemon, pepper, spices, bread, a bit of funk and some light fruits(apple, grape). Very nice and complex aromas here. Taste of grass, lemon, pepper, spices, grape and a slight bit of funk. Very slight bit of tartness noticed on the finish. Lingering notes of spices, lemon, pepper, and breadiness on the finish for a decent amount of time. Quite refreshing and easy drinking for the alcohol level. Medium carbonation and body. No alcohol noticed in the taste or finish. Overall, a very nice saison with nice flavor and balance."
"This is just another unimpressive interpretation of a Belgian style from an American brewery."
"It's an OK beer, I picked up way more ""bread"" undertones than most. While it's a bit off-putting, it's intriguing."
"Overall a very easy drinking beer for one that has a lot going on. If the finish could have a slightly dryer bite, it would nail the saison style stone cold!"
"Overall: A good saison by all means."
"I'd like to enjoy this beer more, but I can't bring myself to do so. Honestly, it's kind of a mess - great look and mouthfeel - odd nose and taste."
"Drinkability: A very nice summer bear I think, not as refreshing as the samurai but different with a nice sweet finish."
"Overall a decent beer, but not what I was looking for in a Saison. It really is more of a Wit and should call itself that instead. Not something I would want to see year round but for a seasonal it could work..."
"Heft of malt weight to it. A delight. Wish I had more."
"D ~ If this wasn't 10 $ a sixpack I would excuse it, but rating it against others in the style with the pricepoint, I'd much rather buy something. Don't seek out. Like a wheat beer with a splash of Belgian yeast"
"Overall-I'm glad theres a 6 pack Saison out there but I really wasn't turned on too much by this beer."
"This was much better than expected. I am beginning to like this brewery after trying a few of their beers. Can't go wrong with this saison. Will definitely have again."
"Good beer overall not bad on a hot day in the sun. At 7 percent alcohol wouldnt be bringing this one to the beach."
"This is my favorite summer beer so far. I look forward to my next bottle of this excellent beer."
"O: every time I try a new saison I say its my new favorite, not this time, its great but I've had better(insert Jim Carry face from Liar, Liar here)."
"O- Very drinkable, I will go back for more of this for sure."
"O: overall this is a really solid saison. I enjoyed it and it is a great beer to sip by the pool or anytime during the summer."
"O - overall, a bit of a mixed bag. The flavor didn't quite hold up to the sweetness that the aroma promised, but the mouthfeel is what really saved this beer for me. Don't know if I'll go back to this, but it was pleasing enough."
"Overall, pretty descent saison. Not Great Divide's best brew by any means, but they can definitely make a good saison."
"Overall, a very good American Saison that could become a staple of my yearly rotations."
"Simple, easy and pleasant. No faults. More of a Belgian Pale."
"Overall, this is a pretty nice saison, maybe not my favorite so far but pretty good nevertheless."
"Overall, a well-balanced Saison that's worth two or three servings per sitting. Not ground-breaking by any means, just pleasant and refreshing. More of an aperitif saison or perhaps something to pair with a fresh goat-cheese salad sparingly topped with a honey-based dressing."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a very pale straw. A almost snow white head was on top, fairly thin, but lasted well. A bit of cling to the sides Fairly constant streams of carbonation rose from the bottom. Aroma had hints of a fruity sweetness. Also noticed a bit of yeast and just a tad of alcohol. Flavor was multi layered. Started out a bit like a hard cider, hints of sweet apples, with a finish of tartness. If it warmed up it became sweeter with less tartness. Occasionally picked up some yeasty bready, but it was very subtle. Felt great in the mouth. Well balanced, nicely carbonated, coated well. Overall a well rounded surprisingly pleasant beer."
"O: Very rustic and old country/old world like. I think they nailed what they were going after in this one. Doesn't have the best drinkability but worth trying out."
"O: Pretty decent beer for a hot day. Pretty refreshing. Not one I would seek out."
"O- A very nice take on the style! Really can take a bunch of these as it tastes great and goes down every easy"
"A says not as much champagne like qualities as expected."
"O - tasty and interesting I would have it again"
"-Cheers"
"This is a very good American saison."
"A good drinking refreshing brew."
"O- 7.3%ABV? I would have guessed below 6%ABV because I couldn't taste anything but malty, yeasty goodness."
"Maybe if I had this super fresh it would kill, but it's still pretty good."
"O - Good but not nearly as good as it is fresh. Find this one fresh and jump on it!"
"Very crisp and refreshing, if a little one-dimensional. Not overly funky and very easy-drinking. Would definitely have this one again."
"O- overall, this is a pretty enjoyable saison that has a lot of differences than most examples of the style. the addition of wild yeast makes me curious how this will hold up in the cellar."
"The mouthfeel was nice. It was clean and refreshing yet had a bit of viscosity to it as well. Lively carbonation added to the feel and it produced a slight mouthwatering effect in the finish. It didn't seem like a 7.3% ABV as it was very drinkable."
"Overall this is a very nice beer. I am glad to have found it. Not as flavorfull as some saisons, but dryer and crisper."
"Overall – This is a very solid that beer that was well balanced and extremely easy to drink. It's worth trying and I'll be buying it again."
"Overall a great refreshing beer to have at the beginning of summer, excellent tasting and one I could have a few more of!"
"O - Certainly not the most refreshing of Saisons but from what I've had of the style thus far, it would be a delicious food beer. I tried it with a bit of sausage and the fattiness really complimented the funk and enhanced the beer."
"O: I really enjoyed this beer. This is a great easy drinking, refreshing, moderately funk saison. This tastes like it came right out of a barn."
"Extremely quaffable, just not very beery. On he whimsical side like a good Wit."
"Pours a nice fluffy tall head that dissipates a little quicker than I expected. Color is hazy yellow. Aroma definitely lemon, but a little sweeter, like lemon curd. I also got some toasted grain and a nice yeastiness. Flavor echos the aroma but with a tartness that you wouldn't necessarily get from another saison such as Saison Dupont. The tartness allows you to come back for more without wearing on your palate."
"Pours a straw color with minimal white head. Nose is mixed citrus, with a hint of human bile & pineapple. Some barnyard on the nose too. On the palate there's some spice, pineapple, more funk, and a zesty-lemony citrus quality. Finishes lemony and cracker-like, rather dry cracker like."
"O- tasty and refreshing ,with some sour funky belgian farmhouse tastes"
"The color is like heavily-carbonated lemonade capped with white fluff. The aroma is an odd mix of fruit and wheat with citrus. The taste had the same flavors with a bit of floral added, but it had a bit of a dirty dish water essence to it that I didn't find it very appealing. The body seemed watery and the aftertaste wasn't much. It is a passable beer but there are many better examples of the style out there."
"Overall/notes - Kind of a vapid brew. Saison is a style I always enjoy, and this one fits right in with the others. I guess it neither excels nor fails when compared to other brews of the type. Certainly worth a visit or two, especially if you're a fan of the style like I am."
"An excellent beer with a golden yellow color forming a clean crisp white head. The aroma is of a typical ale. However, the mouthfeel because of the carbonation gives a champagne quality to the beer. Has a slight coriander and star anise taste giving the beer a Belgian feel. Makes an excellent summer beer! Got it at Ithaca Coffee Company in Ithaca, NY."
"O: nice easy drinking saison, good balance, abv is undetectable"
"O- I would drink this again, and recommend to new saison drinkers."
"O: I've never tried this particular style from Great Divide and this one didn't disappoint."
"Blew me away. I was expecting to hate another beer and loved it. Will buy again."
"Overall - In general very good-tasting and very true to the style, which I appreciate."
"O-> Hmmm...not really sure here. It would seem this would be refreshing on the porch in the summertime, perhaps as a light after dinner cleansing beer, however I'm not sure I could have more than one in a sitting/day/weekend and the ABV doesn't help that much. This beer seems complex and it is, I just think there is a little TOO much going on and it's not for me."
"Great aroma not so great flavors. Everything seems bland with added sucrose."
"Colette is not the best saison that I have ever partaken of, but it is a solid American brewed version of the style. This brew is crisp, fresh and thirst quenching, making it a perfect brew as we transition into summer."
"OA: Very well balanced, and a pleasure to drink."
"Overall, a decent saison. Decently drinkable. I really enjoyed the funk in the nose. I wish it was more present in the taste. Not bad."
"O- Kind of all over the place for me. Good summer beer though, and I love the scent and the substantial mouthfeel."
"a steal at 7.99 a 6er, one of my favorites of the style due to the ham (more ham when fresh, the ones i let wait a month or two were lacking the pork i wanted)"
"Drink- Its pretty tasty and a bit different and the flavors are a bit small but it's a nice beer. I might come back to this one because of $ point."
"Overall this is a good Saison...not quite Hennepin, but not bad either!!!"
"(12oz bottle). Pour hazy light golden color with white head. Very active carbonation. Aroma has grass, wheat, and some lemon. Taste is sweet malt with a bit of tart. Spiciness as well. Thin bodied with an oily texture. Finish is dry. Any ok beer that would be better if the abv were lower. Then, this would at least be sessionable. As it is, I wouldn’t want to make this my drink of the night. (or day?)."
"While probably not the highest example of a saison, it is a very well done beer."
"O: Did not like this one. Just too much lemon. Did not finish."
"This beer pours a cloudy yellow color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into a small cap of lacing. The aroma is of lemons, hay, and leather. The taste is a balance of lemon, orange and mildy funky barnyard notes. What is there in the flavor and aroma is nice, but lacks depth. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a good beer that I would happily drink again, but there are much better saisons out there."
"O: Pretty good stuff"
"I'll give it a 4 on overall rating despite being mildly disappointed on my second tasting tonight out of a glass. You can't find that many affordable saisons in 6-packs, and that's worth a lot during grilling season."
"Overall: Some nice flavors here, but hampered slightly by the mouthfeel. Great Divide makes some great American/English ales, but they have yet to prove to me that they can make an excellent Belgian brew, although this is damn close. Quite enjoyable."
"Drinkability- this beer extremely easily drinkable, it has the perfect balance in drying and sweet flavors, its just overall to me a very enjoyable flavor profile, this beer is also extremely refreshing which makes it superb as a summertime beer, could see easily downing a few of these on a hot summer afternoon, the alcohol is even deceptively high at 7.2 considering it just seems so easily drinkable, overall a pretty darn good beer especially for the season"
"Overall: Pretty good version of farmhouse, I might have to try this one on tap."
"O: a very enjoyable Saison, and one that I would definitely seek out again."
"GD must be commended on this venture though. I applaud the format and the risk-taking. Much more exciting than the stupid beers coming out of Stone lately."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer. It is more toward the hoppy Saisons that remind me of some Tripels, but this is still a solid attempt at the style. I suspect that they are using their Belgian yeast that was in Belgio (sp?) on this beer too as I was getting the same bread dough notes in the aroma, but that may just be a finishing yeast for this beer as the Saison yeasts never attenuate all that well. Either way, this is a pretty decent beer and I will enjoy the whole 6-pack. I doubt I will be buying it again...at least any time soon, but I am glad that I tried it."
"O - Average saison, a bit too tart but not bad."
"With all the citrus it seems to meld Wit and Saison characteristics to make for a nice beer."
"Bottom line; damn, yet another winner from Great Divide. Not too tart, not too dry, not too anything. Great malt base, expert use of notoriously difficult yeast and staying true to style, as I know it. Great beer here, recommended."
"The liquid is cloudy, pale and yellow with a thin filmy white head that stuck to the glass. The smell has a lot of Belgian yeast, salt, banana, clove and sour lemon. The taste starts with some tart lemon then you get some yeast and spice, banana and a grassy/ lemony finish. The beer is light bodied with stinging carbonation and a seriously dry finish. I really enjoyed this beer, it has a little something for everyone."
"Overall – Pretty good, but I’m still on the search for a saison that I can drink every day."
"This beer pours a hazy yellow color with a finger of foamy white head that does not retain well or leave any lacing. The aroma has notes of lemongrass. The taste starts with grassy hop notes and then moves to banana and spicy notes. The mouthfeel is nice and balanced and finishes smooth. Overall a great saison."
"Plenty of yeasty spice up front, dry and earthy in the middle. Clove and pepper spiciness, lemon cookie with a light weizen yeast sweetness and lingering impression of weeds or wildflowers. Faint aftertaste of clover honey. Well carbonated, slightly creamy. Interesting enough, not as dry and crisp as Belgian saisons, sweeter, more spicy and yeast driven."
"O- A good complex beer, not the best saison, but certainly a decent one for a readily available beer."
"The mouthfeel was fairly nice though, it's crisp and well-carbonated. But overall, I didn't really enjoy this beer. Then again, it's not a style I tend to enjoy, so your mileage may vary."
"Overall: this beer is quite average in every sense of the word. You can do better GD. Give me a(ny) Yeti."
"Overall an okay attempt. Don't know that I'd pick this again."
"Overall, I really like this beer & it is one of my favorite styles. A very drinkable beer on a spring or summer day. Would go great w/ burgers or maybe even a summer salad. Some BBQ may go nicely w/ this too. As I'm drinking this I keep getting pictures in my mind of a backyard party w/ friends. Prosit!"
"O: A solid American saison, but not too impressive. You're not getting Dupont."
"Had this in 95 degree heat on the patio; perfect for the occasion, and one I definitely have again."
"Great offering from Great Divide. This is definitely one to enjoy when the weather gets warmer. Very enjoyable, refreshing, recommended."
"Colette is a nice farmhouse offering. Nothing earth shattering here. At the same time there's no real missteps either. The alcohol is well hidden, making for a potentially dangerous quaff. Props to Great Divide for making another tasty brew."
"Great Divide delivers again with another great example of style, this one is refreshing and appreciably complex. Bright brew for summer days ahead."
"D-overall...this is no sasion. come in to this expecting some barnyard funk and you'll be disappointed. if you're wanting a decent pale belgian, then this won't upset you. it does go down easily for the ABV."
"So many similarities to a Wit keeps me from liking it more, but interesting and worth trying."
"Yup, it's a bit sweet in the taste. Overall it's flavors are nice. Bready--with spice. Coriander, florals, a bit of soft citrus. Fairly rich is the mouth. I'd like to see more of something to cleanse the finish, but still very nice."
"Very drinkable, this would be the perfect summer beer. A lighter saison than most I've had, with less of a hop presence. A very nice example of the style, I really enjoy it and will return to it if I see it again."
"D: This is a fantastic interpretation of a Belgian Farmhouse or Saison style. The Belgian yeast is perfect funk to the malt and the mild hops. Clean and crisp with tart citrus fruits, terroir, and medicinal flavors. Love the dry lingering finish. Perfect beer for a hot summer day or just sitting on the porch."
"Enjoyable is the name of the game. Nothing crazy, but a nice easy drinker that is good on a hot day. Worth a try."
"Definitely one of my favorites."
"Poured into my DFH snifter, pours a very light and completely transparent yellow. A little head tops the beer, but way less than I am accustomed to with a Saison/Farmhouse Ale style. The carbonation is actually visible. Smell- roasted corn, cloves, tart banana? Taste- big clove up front, banana, very sweet for the style. Mouthfeel- major carbonation on this is nice and refreshing. Drinkability- I am overall pleased with this take on Farmhouse Ale, and find this beer to be a great refreshing spring beer that would really work well outside in the sun with friends."
"O - Very drinkable, crisp, refreshing and juicy, I could enjoy several of these and not get bored with it."
"D: I'll re-review the beer if I get a chance to have a fresh bottle, but for 2 year old Belgian, this didn't seem to age all that well."
"Pours a hazy yellow with a medium head and some lace. The aroma is tart with a little yeasty baguette breadiness. The flavor is spicy and bready while also maintaining a subtle tartness. The beer is nicely dry and lightly fruity with a bit of lemon rind. Enjoyable, and one more reason I'd like to see Great Divide back in Iowa."
"Notes: Great Divide Is right on with very tasty farmhouse ale!!!"
"Drinkability: In many respects an excellent Saison, though it verges just a bit too much on the sweet side"
"one of the better saisons made in USA"
"D - Good saison, fine beer, get it a go. Excellent light summer offering for any newbie or beer geek."
"D - Drinkability is high. There is no trace of the 7.3% alcohol in this beer and the flavors remain fresh and vibrant throughout the whole glass. It's almost like drinking a highly carbonated juice, in the best way possible."
"D: I had a hard time with the carbonation on this one."
"D- Nice zippy, spicy refreshing beer. Complex flavor profile, goes down smooth. Not my favorite style, but its good for what it is."
"This is a well-crafted brew, but the style isn't really my favorite. If you're a saison fan, it's definitely worth checking out. Comparable to many run-of-the-mill Belgian saisons."
"They nailed it. But of course but a good old American spin on the style, in terms of its stickier/chewier mouthfeel and the slightly bolder flavor than the more subtle creations of the homeland farmhouse ales. Excellent stuff that I wish they'd sell in a bomber, as I could easily enjoy a bit more of this, right now."
"Overall this is by far my least favorite beer from a brewery I really love, hey can't nail em all I guess..."
"Drinkability: I've never been inclined to drink much more than one Saison at a time and I don't think this beer is an exception to that rule. I think the peppery spice always seems to make it session-prohibitive."
"D - This is a pretty good saison. Great Divide has done another great one."
"Poured into a pint glass. The pour is a hazy light straw color with lots of visible carbonation and lots of fluffy white head. And I mean a lot, I had to stop the pour into my glass from this twelve ounce bottle. The head reduces leaving behind sticky, soapy looking lace. The aroma is full your typical of a saison, lemon up front with biscuit and hints of pepper with slight hops kicking around the back of the nose. This smell has a lot of lemon up front in it. The taste follows the aroma nicely. Yeasty with a bit of spiciness and finishes with a bit of lemon zing. The abv on this is higher than I realized, but I would think it is much lower by the taste. This isn't really anything out of the ordinary but it seems to be done very well. The mouthfeel is light and crisp with ample carbonation and again, I wouldn't think this is over seven percent, highly drinkable."
"Very nice representation of the style and for a decent price."
"The Head retention on this is good, the smell is dead on dead for a farmhouse ale. Tons of Belgian yeast goodness. No particularly fruity notes and the flavor is a little clean for the farmhouse genre. Nothing too special to taste. the color was beautiful and it had an exceptional lacing. I could drink it again but I don't need to, know what I mean?"
"D - Well I have two more and plan to have one more now but damn this is the best drinkable Saison I ever had. I hope the same with age..."
"Nice creamy mouthfeel after the fizz fizzles out. Very nice drinker, a keeper for those who like this style."
"Good but not a great beer. Colette just does not match my preferences in the style. Very drinkable and I was able to enjoy. Worth a try, you may like it more than I."
"Pours a cloudy straw color with a thick white head with moderate carbonation. Smells of tropical fruits with some Belgian yeast. Tastes of Belgain malts, fruits, and farmhouse funk, with some dry undertones at the end. An overall complex brew and rare saison avaiable in a 6- pack. A perfect summer beer for those looking a for a take on a classic Belgian style."
"Poured from 12oz bottle, instant noticable aroma of pineapply fruitness with slight hint of lemon. Leaves a creamy film like feel in your mouth after first or second gulp. Reminds me of champagne with a milder carbonation factor. Drinkability is there but not a beer that can be pounded one after the other."
"Overall- usualy steering away from belgians or anything that has a funky clove/ or odd fruity smell this one isn't too shabby. this brew alone has me curious into other farmhouse ales out there."
"A lovely beer all around, I was hoping for a more dry and carbonated brew though the complexities make up for it."
"Poured a light hazy golden amber with a creamy two fingered fluffy head with patchy sticky lacing throughout the glass. Spicy citrus aromas with yeasty bread hints. Holy smokes, tantilized and caressed both palette and tongue this farmhouse wench, bubbly with a certain sassy spiceness, Colette, Yeah! Two thumbs up!"
"D: I will definitely give this one another try. In general, it's a little thin and just a touch on the sweet side for my tastes, but I have a feeling I might be missing something the first time through. True to style, though, it is quite crisp and refreshing."
"Pours a hazy yellow gold with a foamy head that leaves lots of laceing. Aroma is of yeasty lemon,and tart fruit. Body is light and carbonated. Taste is fruity and spicy with a bready edge. Mildly tart and spicy finish. Really good version of this style."
"great divide strikes again, as i can't wait until next spring so i can find more. american saisons are in full swing, and this is an excellent example of what domestic breweries are capable of."
"Citrus, particularly lemon zest and orange peel, and some sour apple head off the flavors. Bready yeasts and coriander take over the middle setting their own distinction from what is first tasted. A third level of complexity is brought into the finish where a couple of dashes of banana shakes hands with peppery spices. There is the slightest of alcohol warmness at the end but is hidden very well to the point where one might not realize they're sipping on something in the 7.5% abv range."
"The beer pours a hazy gold color with a towering white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a dry, peppery scent along with a light pale and wheat malt aroma. It's quite spicy with lots of yeast esters. The taste is decent as well. It's smooth with a nice pale, wheat, and Munich malt flavor. There is a bit of malt sweetness, but it's curbed with loads of yeast spiciness. It goes down easy with a dry, funky finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a pretty good saison. I'm not crazy with either the malt bill or yeast character."
"I could drink it till I pass out!!!"
"D-This beer is very drinkable,especially to finish off a summer evening."
"A transparent brew with minimal lacing that dissipates quickly. Aromas and flavors of wheat crackers, lemon zest, and very minimal chevre cheese. Not a very aggressive saison but highly drinkable. No problems here and I am stoked about a saison sixer!"
"D - an excellent summer beer and great example of the style."
"Despite the lively appearance of this beer, it is only lightly carbonated. Finishes off-dry. Quenching--a beer I would gladly drink by the crock as I worked the fields at the farm, though perhaps a bit too sweet on the whole. Still quite pleasant."
"Verdict: I'd been looking forward to this beer for quite a while, but I ended up being a little disappointed. Colette is certainly not a bad beer--in fact it's pretty solid--it just isn't particularly interesting."
"Very drinkable for its ABV. Complexity is minimal so I'm grading this down some."
"Largely lacks the funk and earthiness I like in a saison, but it has some character. Tastes something like a Belgian pale or wit actually, particularly as it gets warmer."
"Not-bad saison, not too distinctive either. Will give a nice yeast kick and alcohol fix on a warm day."
"Not really familiar with Saisons, only had a couple before. Anyway, this one was pretty good. It had a very impressive fluffy head, which died out to a good lacing. The beer itself was a cloudy golden color, reminded me of a hefe. Smell wasn't too strong, but what I did get, was hints of wheat and malt. Not too much on the hops. Taste was somewhat wheaty and fruity, maybe a slight sour bite to it. No detection of alcohol what so ever, which is impressive considering it's over 7%. Overall a very drinkable beer that's great on a hot summer night, or even after I do hours of yard work."
"D: Good drinkability, even with the 7+% abv. Not the greatest Saison, but, very, very good."
"D - Not the best saison I've ever had, but at only roughly $2 for this bottle, its one of the best for the money. Another great brew from GD."
"Overall, a bit mild, and more of a lemony wheat beer. Not super complex, but good."
"D: Very nice and goes down easy on a hot day."
"Fairly good farmhouse. A bit too tart and sweet for regular drinking. But good for a 'one off'."
"A hazy golden straw color pour with a big , lasting foamy white head , spotty lacing , lively carbonation . Aroma of corn and rice as promised , grassy hops , cloves , lemon zest and yeast . Flavor is quite wheaty , cloves , lemon , biscuty malt , slightly tart , nice balance , clean refreshing mouthfeel , medium body , grassy yeasty finish . Very drinkable and a quality brew for sure ."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Boulevard Tank 7 tulip. This beer pours a slightly hazy, lighter then School Bus Yellow with a massive 4 inch cap that leaves fingers of lacing all the way down the sides of the glass. The aroma was pretty prevalent from the pour. A slightly sulfuric aroma poured crept from the bottle right after opening it, just the way I like it. Damp earth, lemon zest, a hint of ground black pepper all mixed together with baled hay. I rather exciting nose from a American Saison. It has my hopes up. Unfortunately the flavor let them down rather considerably. The flavor profile seems to be a muddled jumble of flavors that are never really defined individually but do not come together as a whole either. Up front is the all to sweet mark of quite a bit of pale malts. It underlies the entirety of the flavor profile. Milled barley, slight clove, white pepper and just a bit of coriander. Almost no citrus or grass. Just a bit of wheat tang, no fruit and for some reason the after flavor really bothers me. I cant quite put my finger on the flavor but it irks me something badly. The mouthfeel is hands down the hardest aspect to nail on a Saison, and this one misses the mark. Medium bodied with almost a creamy aspect, not really dry at all. Sugary. Where are those high temperatures they were talking about. Other then the spices, I really don't think esters play that much of a role in the anything. I know I'm hard on Saisons. They are my favorite style and I really do love GD, but Colette just doesn't do it for me."
"Overall, a great beer with a light body and easy drinking character. This beer goes to show that a beer with a higher than average abv can still be great for enjoyment after a hot day. Very satisfied with this purchase."
"D - This is a good summer beer, clean, light, easy driniking and refreshing. I would suggest you try this on a hot day."
"d: It finishes like a pretty good saison, but that sweetness up front was distracting. I'm sure no corn was used, but that is the word I would associate with that flavor."
" Palate is nice and refreshing - sweet pale malt that is reminiscent of corn pops. Light, tangy, citrsuy flavors from the saison yeast come through before the swallow, along with some nice, lemony hops and a touch of coriander. Finish is sweet and dry. Body is light and effervescent, but not quite as light as a true Belgian saison. That also makes it not quite as drinkable as other saisons on the market, but it's still an enjoyable beer."
"What a nice ale for the warmer weather approaching us. Refreshing, very drinkable and very flavorful."
"Reviewed on: 05-29-2010"
"I'd definitely recommend this beer"
"F: Very dry with hints of spicy saison flavors, little boozy warmth and tingle a little heavy booze for 7.3%. A little wheat flavors, some yeast and farmhouse flavors lingering, some bitterness with a touch of spicy hops and orange peel, even a bit of spices and coriander."
"D: Very good summer Saison. Refreshing and easy to drink. Only hindrance is the high carbonation."
"This is a nicely caronated palate with sometexture and nuance going on from start to finish. This dry palate would be somewhat sessionable on a summer day while taking a break from some hard outdoor work."
"Not a style I often seek out at all,on a warm day like today I figured it might hit the spot.Poured into a tulip glass a hazed lemonade color with a great clingy two finger white head that left broken rings of lace as it settled slowly.Funky barnyard notes in the nose along with some iron/metallic,a whiff of lemon peel as well,some are big fans of the barnyard funk,Iam not.Flavors are funky but on a smaller scale,wet grain notes along with lemon pith, and honey,there is enough sweetness to keep the funk in check for me.A decent brew,again not a fan for a reason,but I grade it accordingly."
"D: Very nice drinkability, crisp, dry, well suited per style and 6 pack worthy. An easy to drink interpretation that makes for a good tart summertime farmhouse that will wet the whistle and make fans of the style."
"Overall, this is a good beer. Not my favorite beer, but I am relatively new to the style and thought it was enjoyable. I would like to try some more Saisons in the future."
"D- this beer is very drinkable, and is the perfect, early summer beer. Just makes me think of eating a good meal outside, and kicking back a few with friends. Overall a great Saison."
"D: At 7% ABV, this isn't something you can drink all afternoon. I wish it were just 5%, but then it may not have all this delicious flavor. I'm just happy there's an affordable and delicious saison in six-packs! Great Divide makes great beer, and Colette is further proof."
"Cheers!"
"Poured a nice hazy straw yellow with good carbonation and a nice white head. Nose is wheat, rice, clove. Taste is belgian yeast, clove, banana, wheat. Mouthfeel has a nice tart, crisp finish, with clove, fruits and spice. Just right amount of booze. Very drinkable indeed."
"Regardless, Colette is a delicious beer. There's some flaws (it's a little sugary at times, the funkiness could be turned up to good effect, and the beer is rather lacking ester-wise, especially considering the banana present in the aroma but absent from the flavor), but it's solid and refreshing. To boot, it's a good saison that comes in a 6 pack for the price of 750ml of most good imported saisons. Excellent value. I was very impressed when I first tried this, and still am."
"Good Saison flavor, slightly wheaty. Lots of mild citrus, clove and pepper. Nice full body with an appropriate level of carbonation. Pleasant sour aftertaste."
"On tap at Plan B in W. Htfd, CT. I drink a lot of Saison, and this is wayyy off the style for a Saison. Citrus, clove, some of the ester profile I associate with the wheat/white homebrew styles of a decade ago (or today, but that is the time period I associate with banana/clove hysteria). I would have pegged it as ""spiced hefeweizen"" or a summer beer with an identity crisis. Hop character was completely supressed under the spice. It makes for a very drinkable pint, even at 7.5%, but there is much better to be had."
"This is a drinkable brew, but there are better ones out there. (Apricot Farmhouse from Upright Brewing an excellent example, and #5 from Upright, a classic example extremely well executed) I wouldnt suggest this to exemplify the farmhouse/saison style. Though, the 7.3% on a hot summer day with nothing to do except sample some brews could justify a round."
"I'm not getting this brew again. The whole experience was awful. It's lemon and bitterness just doesn't seem to work. It was very poorly executed."
"Pours a hazed yellow gold with moderate cap of soapy white bubbles, little retention. Scent begins with equal parts tangy wheat and floral hops, light vanilla cookie like sweetness with a splash of watery fruit and lemongrass on the finish with the lightest hint of herbs. Taste is a touch more aggressive than scent dictated but still well balanced with strong tangy wheat and floral notes still the star, the backbone has an aggressive shortbread taste with a hint of vanilla as well as watery fruit (pears), combines pleasantly with a hop profile that provides a touch of lemon zest and earthy spiciness. Medium bodied and dry finish. A nice non-funkdified saison which keeps things dry and light with some well blended flavors."
"Pours the color of cloudy spun gold, capped with a beautiful rocky white head. This one looks so inviting in the glass. Aroma of strawberries, lemons, yeast and wheat. Tastes almost exactly like it smells, spicy and refreshing, with a good hint of lemon-citrus and a peppery tang on the back end. The alcohol is not the least bit evident in this one, and it makes for a delicious and refreshing late spring afternoon beer. Excellent."
"Overall: This is a fine representation of this style, but not quite on the level of the best Belgian originals. Although one might be a fool to expect it to be... and thus this beer touches greatness."
"Overall, very smooth and refreshing, but more like a spiced wheat beer than a saison. However, very drinkable for the rather high(7.3ABV) alcohol content. A nice summer sipper."
"drinkability is ok but when i reach for a saison i doubt its this one - one plus is that this comes in 6ers though"
"The thickness of the mouthfeel was fine. What docks Colette points is the sharpness of its carbonation. It isn't particularly bubbly but it is sharp on the tongue, to the point of mild uncomfortability. If you can get past that then Colette is a super-easy drinking summer beer that does much of the same things right that a nice hefe would."
"Nothing wrong with this beer, though I can't imagine why I'd ever want to get this as opposed to the real McCoy from Belgian. Frankly, I doubt Dupont could make this bland and uninteresting a saison if they tried."
"I like this, I like it more in the bottle for some reason or another. The mix of yeasts in this really sets it off. This is one American Saison that I would drink more than one of. It's not to far off from the others meaning it's not quite on the Belgian scale, but damn it's close. I know it's not sessionable, but F that, Im dranking more."
"Got this as part of a variety pack and decided to drink this first to get it out of the way as I didn't really expect to enjoy this style as this is my first saison. I was pleasantly surprised. Pours a bright but somewhat hazy straw color. Scent was somewhat faint but what was there was wheaty and citrusy. Flavor was complex with a mild lemony sourness and lots of grain. Feels like you could knock a few of these back but the alcohol catches up quick. Glad I stumbled across this and definitely will be exploring this style some more."
"Pours a hazy straw color with a thick white head that doesn't stick around long. The aroma isn't a strong point, with not much going on other than some funky yeastiness and a bit of biscuity malt. The flavor is an improvement from the aroma, with a biscuity malt presence upfront, followed by some lemon and mineraly hops, some barnyard funkiness, some spicyness (white peppercorn) and a touch of alcohol. The mouthfeel is appropriately light, and drinkability is very good. A decent saison, but not something I would buy again."
"This is the perfect beer for food pairings. I could enjoy it with a funky cheese and crackers as a summer afternoon snack. Or perhaps lemon pepper shrimp salad."
"D - It is the first hot day of the year here in Florida, and damn this is a refreshing brew. I see previous reviewers are less impressed; I am not sure what to chalk that up to."
"Pours a hazy, pale golden color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Slight retention and poor lacing. Smells of tart malt, strong yeast, and slight sweet malt. Fits the style of a Saison / Farmhouse Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an high carbonation level. Tastes of tart malt, yeast, slight sweet malt, slight hop, and slight clove. Overall, a decent body and blend."
"Notes: It's a nice brew but it has a feeling like it wants to get there but it can't really make it. It's a long way from being a noticeable farmhouse ale... And surely this might be the least remarkable offering I've tried from Great Divide."
"Overall, decent effort by Great Divide but nothing really worth seeking out if you are accustomed to drinking good representations of the style."
"It pours a cloudy golden yellow with a large head with medium to light lacing. The nose gives way to horse blanket, barnyard yeast, sour presence, and no alcohol to note. The palate is stronger than the nose with lots of barnyard, tart sourness, light to medium fruit, and and a nice dry medium bitter finish. I rated this beer as a session beer. It hides the 7.3% all day. Bold flavors and a crisp finish with a hint of complexity makes this beer a true or ideal session beer and a work horse in the beer world. I enjoyed this beer and the story that it told."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and well carbonated. Drinkability is high."
"Solid, not mind blowing, but worth trying at this price and availability."
"Overall Impression: I would smack lips with Colette anytime! Not tops for the style, but it is worth a taste if you have the greenback!"
"Mouth/Drink: The mouth is a bit thin but still feels nice. Drinkablity is high with all the flavor, this is a really nice beer."
"D - I respect this brew. It's hearty, it does what it's supposed to and it is what it is. It is missing something in the middle of the sip, but it's well-crafted and kind of exciting tasting. It kicks more than I thought it would. I would probably get this one again."
"With the release of Saison Farmhouse Ale, Great Divide has proven once again that they are one of the world's finest craft breweries. Forget top-10. These guys are in my top-3. Bottom line: this is delicious, drinkable beer on hot summer days, cold winter nights... and everything in between."
"Pours a clearly hazed bright yellow golden hue with a large white tiny bubbled foamy white head. Fine speckled lacing left behind on the sides of my chalice. This one says it was bottled in April 2009 that's fine with me a style that probably does okay with a little age. Aroma has a nice yeast spiciness label states that they used a blend of 4 yeast strains, I'm definitely getting some Saison Dupont characteristics with a citrus/tropical fruitiness. Sharp wheat edge with a nice spiced backend, ample sweetness a touch of biscuit drizzled with honey that herbal spice component is intresting almost lavender with a touch of black pepper. Flavor is dominant with the spices but bursts of honey biscuit malt and tropical fruit pineapple blend nicely with the spiced herbal additions. Yeast gives it that funky peppery slightly nutty edge that overall works well together a perfect beer to combine with most foods. Mouthfeel is slightly creamy with tart and sweet sensation over the palate dry yeasty finish, moderate alcohol. Medium bodied carbonation carries this one quite well, not really cloying to me at all. Drinkability is solid all around very nice American brewed version sometimes this style can be pretty bad if not drinking a version outta of Belgium. Great Divide pulled it off very well and they put their own trademarks on it."
"Drinkability: I didn't know quite what to think when going into this beer. I'm finding it quite tasty and enjoyable. Very drinkable for a 7.3% beer."
"D - This is an excellent and very drinkable saison. The yeast character is wonderful, with the strong tropical fruit presence that I look for in a saison as well as some some clove and other spices to add depth. The hop character takes a back seat to the yeast, but it still noticeable (especially in the aroma) and more than capable of balancing the malt. This is an excellent example of the style and I would gladly drink it again if given the opportunity."
"Good refreshing brew."
"This is the second Great Divide beer in a row that really hasn't dazzled me. After rolling out consistently great beer, this and the 15th Anniversary Release are just in the 'pretty good' category. This one would probably be improved if the herbal aspect was toned down a little. The other flavors seem to work nicely and I like the hoppy aspect of it, but that vegetal bit is just too strong. Not a bad effort, but a little disappointing. Worth a try nonetheless."
"D - Well, I'm used to Great Divide putting out awesome DIPAs, barleywines, and imperial stouts....who knew they had this kind of range? In all honesty, I wasn't expecting much....as I said, when I want a DIPA, barleywine, or imperial stout, I know full well to look to these guys....but I only picked this up out of curiosity. I was expecting it to be a fully Americanized saison, the kind my local brewery brews and tries to pass off as a saison, when it just tastes like a slightly stronger witbier. Clearly, I was wrong - this is the real thing. Crisp, refreshing, drinkable...and fairly authentic."
"This ale pours a light golden with a very light haze and develops a full 2-inch head that is totally white and creamy. The head settles over time into about 1/4 inch. The carbonation is marked but of moderate intensity with very small bubbles. The initial nose makes me think of a pilsner, but the malty and hoppy notes are pushed aside by the expected sour notes of this farm-house ale. The body is medium-light with a pleasant lightly-sour lingering. Definitely an ale for food. The sour notes are more restrained than I expected of a Farmhouse Ale/Saison. The ale is quite tasty. Lacing does form, but is rather moderate. The 7.3% ABV is not noticeable on the palate. I'd try this again, but would first return to some Saisons from Belgium."
"D: I really liked this and could easily have a few. The crispness gives a refreshing feel that makes it easy to keep drinking it."
"Overall its a good, very easy to drink, refreshing Saison."
"I love Great Divide beers, and I love this style, so lets try this one. Pours a sort of dull golden straw color, with just a ring of white lacing. Some fruit smell in the nose along with some some nice bright grain. Green apples first come to mind in the taste, with some pineapple, and champagne tastes as well. Body is light for a somewhat high ABV. Drinkability is very nice...light, refreshing and easy to put back. This is a pretty good Saison from Great Divide. I may have been expecting a bit more, but still a very fair effort. Cheers"
"Not worth buying again but a good experience."
"Nice beer but one of the few Great Divides that I think pales in comparisson to other breweries similar offerings."
"D- Smooth and enjoyable. May not be as memorable as some European counterparts, but it is tasty."
"Overall, pretty standard, but worth a shot."
"Pours bright yellow, pretty big foamy head. Smells a bit barnyardy, but also a bit cirtusy, almost like an amalgam of what you get with ""oldschool"" and ""newschool"" saisons. Taste is basic saison-faire, a bit dry but still kind of sweet, some woody fruity citric flavors, and a distinct lack of hoppy bitterness. Little bit of an ascetic kick. Decently coating in the mouth, very drinkable. For a sessionable, uncomplicated saison, this is pretty good."
"taste is crisp yet thick, somewhat tangy, sweet fruit, banana, and sour malt, ends oily and slightly bitter."
"D - Doesn't taste nearly as strong as it is, a good beer for those warmer days if you're a fan of beer with some subtle citrus zest. I was unimpressed with the appearance and came off a bit rough, but ended up enjoying it none the less for its taste. Falls well into the Saison spectrum, although less refined."
"Drinks slow, unpleasing mix of flavors. ABv is well hidden, I'm not really too enamored of any of GD's Belgian styled offerings, this one just struck the wrong way, almost drain poured it..."
"Final note- A good beer but misses with nose and appearance. Otherwise it would be a damn fine beer."
"D- Good drinkability. It a solid beer."
"I like this one a lot, but it simply needs a lot more funkiness to compete with the better examples of the style."
"Overall, this one needs to be tweaked. Too much of a hop presence."
"An excellent offering by Great Divide."
"22oz bottle. Bottled on 4/15/09. Bottle conditioned. Served in a Duvel Tulip. Poured a pretty pale straw with two fingers of puffy white head. Wheaty spice in the aroma with some lemon, also a bit of sugar as it warmed. Slight hop flavor, also some yeasty funk. Fairly complex flavors. Light bodied, dry and refreshing. I enjoyed this."
"D - Perhaps this brew needs a little more age to tone down the hop profile, but it just wasn't the most balanced saison I've come across. Enjoyable, to be sure, and a pleasing summer evening sipper. The nose really is remarkably good, though."
"In the mouth it's medium bodied and gently zesty with a fine-bubbled carbonation that gently bristles the tongue. It's refreshing, and fits perfectly well with the rest of the beer."
"D: Sure its not the most dynamic Saison out there but it does what it is supposed to : it makes you refreshed on a hot day. Can't bitch about that. Sure the look, flavor and feel could use a bit of work, but the beer works. Its not the best Saison out there by any means but it works in a pinch and makes me happy. I am not upset by this beer at all, maybe just a touch let down. I figure that Great Divide will play with this brew and tweak it a bit as they are known to do. I see it as a work in progress and I expect it to get better the more they brew it."
"M/D: Light to medium bodied, carbonation is actually not too prickly. Drinkability is decent. Overall, a decent Saison. A bit too sweet for my liking in a Saison. It has everything you'd think you'd find in a Saison, it just needs some more balance."
"Cheers!!!"
"Overall this is a decent beer but it's got a way to go before it's anything more than that. I'd like to see GD tweak their new beers and get them on the level with Old Ruffian and OA Yeti."
"D: This is a good American example of a saison. Very light and drinkable. A good summer beer."
"Many thanks to Erik from Flying Saucer for the hook-up, 22oz bomber into a Duvel snifter pours a hazy straw yellow with a nice frothy off-white head. Aroma is lemon peel and sweet malt. Taste is a nice amount of sweet fruit, crisp spice and yeast funk that leaves a tart, sour finish. The beer is just as crisp and refreshing as the style calls for, the tartness is a little on the astringent side, however. This is an enjoyable Saison, just not as good as I hoped it would be coming from Great Divide, oh well, it is still enjoyable."
"Overall impression: Highly drinkable and a nice offering, I certainly wouldn't mind seeing this in six packs."
"One bottle is enough to satisfy a hankering for a saison. Wouldn't make a session out of this beer, but it's a drinkable beer, 650 mls is enough."
"This Saison is brewed with Barley, wheat and rice using 4 unique yeast strains and fermented at a higher temp. It pours a cloudy yellow body. The aroma is light lemon and earth. The flavor is hay, lemon, grassy bracing hop bitterness, spicy yeast, and a light tartness. Light grainy body with crisp carbonation. Overall, I found this to be a pleasing but unremarkable beer. GD has spoiled us with so many outstanding beers over the years, I was expecting something truly remarkable here. Perhaps that expectation was unfair, but this beer feels like a letdown."
"Not really impressed by this offering. Some what adjunctish flavor and aromas. Just a bit on the syrupy sweet side. Pours a clear yellow with a fluffy tan head. Taste and nose are quite sweet with a subtle Belgian yeast and floral hop presence. Some fruity spices. Medium body is overly carbonated."
"Drinkability is pretty good, this is a textbook example of the 'style', which of course allows for a wide range of interpretation, allowing for the unique character."
"[few]"
"D: Not quite what I was expecting, but still decent. A greater level of complexity out front would have been nice. The sourness of the finish was a bit too much for me. I'm still glad I tried it."
"Overall, not a bad summer beer, but not too interesting for a saison - a little too sweet and the sweet sugary fruits don't jive well with the yeast funk."
"Great Divide churned out a turd in my opinion. Its funny how they can make 'grand slam' beers like Yeti and Titan, but make average beers like this and Samurai. I still love Great Divide, but would have appreciated more effort or originality in this summer brew."
"Drinkability: A fairly enjoyable, pleasantly drinkable saison given a slight American twist. Worth a try."
"Consumed: May 13, 2009"
"The body finishes a bit dry. This is enhanced by a high carbonation with a slight carbonic bite. Light but noticeable. Overall, there are some good positives here, specifically with the yeast. But some negative, with the rubbery flavors (and the lack of more yeast). Still drinkable though."
"D- This is a dangerously drinkable beer that is very refreshing. Overall, this is a fantastic saison and another great beer from Great Divide."
"Bottled April 15. Very decent new Saison from Great Divide- a style I like very much, and what I find is a great hot weather beer different from all of the wheat beers out there this time of year. Pours a hazy pale straw color with a fairly nice pur white head that fades to a ring. Nice fruity nose of bananas, a touch of lemon, straw, and some coriander. Alittle citrsuy in the taste as well, especially up front, with some sweet banana and light grain and spice in the finish. The tiniest bit sour and very clean in the mouth. A relatively simple but tasty Saison. It is a touch on the sweet side, but the nice citrus finish helps make it very refreshing, balanced, and keeps it interesting."
"From the day Great Divide tapped the Saison, I've had 2-3 a week. It's a great beer that's fun to drink, and it's refreshing enough that I like having more than one in a row. It's got a little citrus / sour taste to it, with some great carbonation and a beautiful color. Overall, a great beer."
"D - all in all the flavors of this beer carry its drinkability. its mouthfeel definitely needs some work. the dominate yeast flavors (the label claims to have used 'a special blend of four yeasts') really give you the impression of a witbier of some sort. i wouldn't call this beer 'true to style' by a longshot however, it is a decent beer. go in without expectations and you might just like it... as for me? 9 bones can get me a beer much closer to style."
"D- very high, would get again if i was in the mood for something a little different, If i was looking for a straight up saison, i would turn to Dupont of Hennepin."
"I wouldn't say this is a great saison. Maybe it just needs more time in the bottle. However, it's not a bad beer for what it is. At this price, I probably won't buy it again."
"Notes from and tasted on: 4/30/09"
"22oz bottle $7 with a cool label that has a yellow checkered theme that reminds me of Dupont. Thick white head and a super cloudy whitish yellow color. The smell is just slightly funky, dusty, earthy, smells pretty much what I would expect for the style. The taste is quite refreshing or at least it makes me think I have been refreshed. Its been a long week. Nice yeasty, spicy flavor and goes down very smooth."
