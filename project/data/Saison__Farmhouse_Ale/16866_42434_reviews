"Excellent Saison. Clean, dry finish."
""
""

""

"Has an earthy, fruit nose with a hint of fresh laundry and faint barnyard. It pours dull amber to brownish peach under a very pillowy, very uniformly and finely bubbled, 2” off-white head. Light fruit over malt dominate the yeast driven palate. Light malt provides the backbone with light fruits – peach, apricot, light tropical – not quite pineapple, maybe guava. Medium body and average to a little above on the carbonation."
"Overall: Not crazy about this one, but I am glad I had an opportunity to try it so I know in the future to pass on this one. It was on sale by the way so it doesn't break my heart that it isn't the best saison I have ever had. Its fair and that is about it."

"O-  Excellent saison!  Delicious."
"O - A very good saison that hides it's 8.5% abv well.  I wish it was a little bit more funky, but the fruity citrus flavors are also very nice.  I prefer Boulevard's Saison Brett, but it would be nice to try them side by side."

"Yummy. Seek it out for a different experience and have an open mind. Oh and this hides the 8.5 so watch out."
"Excellent farmhouse flavor with some wild yeast on the end... really great beer.  Would love to see how this matures with some cellaring."

"Dry and sweet.  Muddled citrus flavors with Belgian yeast, all spice"
""
"didnt quite hit the mark"
"Poured into an oversized wine glass it forms a generous head that leaves some nice lacing as it dissipates. The color is a nice red gold. The taste has a hint of spice from the rye with a slight Saison funk. Very nice mouthfeel."
""
"750 ml bottle. Generous head. Beautiful amber non-translucent amber color. Flagrant - aromatic not distinctly alcoholic despite 9.5 ABV.  Taste classic Saison taste alcohol finish. Solid rich feel."
"Mouthfeel is very rich and nicely spiced. I really enjoyed this beer, even without the classic  Saison funk. Very tasty and impressive."

"O:  Overall a nice Saison with a few nice nuances that differentiate it from other Saisons out there.... pretty easy drinking and a nice one to try if you can get your hands on it..."
""

"D - Very easy to drink for sure."

"O:not bad, there are certainly better saisons out there but you could do a hell of a lot worse"

"Overall I thought this was a good beer and good example of the style, it's still identifiable as a Saison and the brett and rye seem to be in the background, that's not bad, but I found myself wishing that the rye and brett were more noticeable and the belgian yeast showed up in the background.  This beer had ok drinkability, it was smooth, very crisp, pretty prickly, very dry on the finish, not too filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, but I think one glass is enough for me any more than that and the prickly carbonation might start to wear on me.  What I like the most about this beer was nothing, there isn't any aspect that stood out as being better than the others.  What I liked the least about this beer was that brett and rye didn't show up more, they were a little light for my liking.  I would buy this beer again, but it isn't anything I'm going to stock up on and I would recommend it to anyone who likes saisons with just a little brett to them, the brett doesn't really take out of the realm of the style.  All in all I was happy with this beer and I thought it was a nice Saison, but with that being said, I wasn't overly impressed with it and I don't think it's very memorable.  This beer made for a nice first impression for the Bruery and I'm interested in trying more of their beers and I would say it's above the middle as far as Saisons go.  Good job guys, this was a nice Saison, keep up the solid work."

"Tasty, but I wish it had more body, was more beer-like. Kind of like a tart, sour alcoholic fruit juice."
""
""
"O - This was my first experience with The Bruery and i'am definetly impressed. A different take on a Saison that is extremely drinkable and well executed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Tasty and complex, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a flavorful beer worth drinking for a while if you’re in the mood for a Saison that is a bit towards the sour side."

"I got a bottle at Garaje in SF on a hot day. I wasn't a huge fan of saisons until I tried this one. It sure blows away Goose Island. Where do they hide all that alcohol anyway?"

"One of the best saison I've ever had."
""
"Overall an awesome and readily accessible saison.  Nice!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall -  For my first offering from the Bruery, this is a well executed saison with the belgian yeast taking centre stage with the other ingredients acting as good supporting members. I find it to be a little sweet and would like to have a bit more of a drier finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: With a combination of muddled and standard flavors, this beer let me down in a stunning fashion. While a good example of a traditional saison, I was expecting a little more from the Bruery; maybe some sour characters, lower ABV for clearer flavors, or a little wider array of flavors. I'm all for subtlety, but 'funk' is a flavor that can wear on me pretty quickly."
"Great beer , worthy of storing in your beer fridge . Repeatable"
""
""
""

"This pours with a dense cloud of bright foam and a iridescent yellow color. The nose holds a tinge of alcohol before yielding black licorice, pears, peppercorns and cantaloupe. I taste apricots at first before a glimpse of sweet lemon moves in. The middle palate is yeasty with some malt before it ends with banana and raisin bread. Very good example of the style with a more narrow complexity."

"Described as a Belgian style ale brewed with Rye and Brettanomyces, this beer pours brightly golden with a copper hue.  It is highly effervescent with a sturdy white head that persists as a thick layer of merengue-like foam throughout.  Delicate Belgian lacing rides down the side of the glass.  The aroma is musty with hints of banana, clove and spice. Malt is present and phenolic notes linger in the background. The flavor is big and fruity, and quickly fades into a crisp, dry finish that leaves a dank bitterness on the back of the tongue. Mouthfeel is dry and slightly astringent. Overall, this beer is a solid representation of style that has a crisp character and sweetness that is balanced by barnyard funk."

"Crisp thin head, with minimal lacing patterns. Aroma of fresh grass and stone fruit, notably apricot, plum, and peach. Citrus notes of light lemon zest, grapefruit, and tangerine with a fair amount of mango, especially in the aftertaste. Very light body with a lasting aftertaste of citrus and hops."

"This is the first beer from The Bruery and it was fantastic. A great beer to pair with lighter foods for sure. I like a lot of things about this brewery from their philosophy (""we won't brew an IPA"") to their label art. Looking forward to trying many more from them."
""
""
""
""
""
"This will be a new favorite of mine for this style. It has everything I like: funk and sweetness balanced by hops and crispness."
"o - my favorite sour that doest start with cantillon"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This failed to impress me. The mouthfeel is oddly thick for a saison due to the rye and the sticky flavor is underwhelming without a significantly tart aftertaste typical of many Brett. saisons. I've made better beers than this. I'm left thinking That the Bruery should price their beers differently based on the end result, not the cost of production. This one should have been on closeout while their better offerings could fetch more."
""
""
"O - A very refreshing unfiltered summer Saison. The Bruery hasn't disappointed so far. Glad I bought 2 of these. Hope this gets even better after another year of cellaring. Prost!"
"What a treat. Drink it!"
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Excellent beer. Certainly heavier than Belgian saisons I’ve had at least in alcohol weight. Reminiscent of Biere Brut in in some ways, but playful and tame all at the same time."

"O: Interesting beer. You can tell this is a well done saison, but with the addition of the rye gives it a nice twist. All the funk you should expect is there, along with the spiciness of rye. Really neat beer."
"O- This is a solid beer, and boy is there a lot going on flavor wise, there are many different tastes mixing together, and mixing well. I hope to get another to age and see how these flavors develop together."
""
""
"Overall- I love this beer. It's very refreshing on a hot day. Very different from the first time I tried it though. It seems all of the flavors have mellowed out and blended together. Although I can smell it, I can't taste any sort of fruit. It also hasn't developed any foul tastes, which is good. I definitely recommend this beer, and aging a few bottles (as it suggests on the label) is well worth it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A good Saison, perfect for the hot day I'm reviewing it."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very solid spring beer, not too heavy not too light, nicely balanced and very tasty! Worth the pricetag."
"Overall the beer is well made, sports a good amount of flavors, and drinks pretty easily. I would of liked it to be a bit better attenuated as the sweetness plays off the fall spice flavors a bit much. Though I do believe this was brewed for the fall time? Either way, a few tweaks would be called for to rate this higher. But a very good beer nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the more pleasing saisons I've had. Lot of earthy, lemony, aromas, bubblegum, big grain note. The rye comes through on the flavor too, lot of lemony citrus, and some tart rasperry notes. Really well balanced interesting. Pretty rich when fresh, have heard this sits well for a year or so"

"O I'm not a fan of clove, so this didn't work for me. Also, this isn't a very good saison offering. I found myself wanting a Lost Abbey saison over this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very good take on a Saison/Farmhouse ale. Great blend of yeast, spices, and dry fruit flavors. The subtle rye and Brett add a nice kick."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall: well done. a subtle but rich take."

"For its purported, if not particularly evident ABV, this is a tasty, easy-drinking stroll down 'saison street', one bulked up with the various malt inputs, giving it a much heavier feel than the norm. At any rate, the Brett is faint at best, the rye much more prominent, pushing this into new or sub-style territory, if you care about that kind of stuff - me, I'm gonna go and just enjoy the rest of this bountiful bottle."

"Light brown in color with vibrant carbonation. In fact when I popped the cap foam started to rise out of the bottle shortly thereafter and it had not been disturbed prior to that. Good clarity. Thin layer of tightly knit,minuscule white foam on top. The aroma is very inviting and unique. The tartness of Brett blends very well with the spiciness of rye. The flavor dimples carries the aroma forward. The Brett dominates but leaves room for the playful spiciness of the rye. Mouth is pretty carbonated,true to style and with all of those clues prior to tasting it was no surprise."
"The beer pours a fairly lively and cream white head that dissipates slowly. The beer itself is a fascinating color. Instead of the traditional pale gold or straw, the beer is a cloudy and obscure dark orange with hints of brown. The beer smell is divine and unique. The brettanomyces and rye mix very well together along with the earthy hop notes. The bretta provides a nice sweet fruity smell to offset the earthiness and the rye. The beer taste is similar to the smell with stronger and earthy hop notes that mixes well with the rye. The bretta takes off some of the edge and provides a nice nectarlike taste to the brew. The beer feel is smooth and refreshing with biting carbonation but feels a little thick for a saison. Overall, a superb brew that I will get again."
""
""
""
""
"First things first I thought I had drunk this before but the no review has left me guessing so lets just review it for future reference and it pours a hazed golden orange hue with a creamy ever present three finger head and lacing as far as the eye can see,the smell is Brett,bananna,yeast and really ripe fruit,the mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation which perfectly suit and has tastes of yeasty bananna,funky Brett,pears and finished with a mix of bitter hops and spicy rye and overall definately something quite quaffable even given its high ABV cheers."
""
"Flavor is definitely rustic - caramel malt is very present with a nice helping of wheat and fruity noble hop. Its a very malty saison and the rye definitely gives it a nice kick of spice. Id imagine classic rustic saisons from old world Belgium had lots of rye and whatever else they can grab in it. The mouthfeel is damn near perfect. Super dry and a perfect body - not too heavy and not too light. Its nearly 9% and you can tell it has a kick, but its not overdone. Really a great Saison...really a great example of the style and delicious to boot!"
""
""
""
"O- The nice well blended flavor has some peppery and fruit yeast characters which add a nice depth and it is very easy to finish the bottle. The price is a bit high compared to other with similar character but I enjoyed this bottle."

"Beautiful beer. A delicious alcoholic aroma reminiscent of a sparking white wine. Some subtle malt and yeast characteristics noted in the aroma as well but it is dominated by the sweet smell of fruity alcohol. The flavor of this brew is absolutely amazing there is some straw like malt presence but I was really blown away by the unmistakable fruity characteristics of this beer. This is really something else, a lot of very interesting things are going on in this brew that i cannot even explain. This is more of a fine wine than a beer. Mouthfeel is perfect, nice and dry. Fuck Miller High Life this shit is the real champagne of beers."

"This is not a great example of a saison. It it fairly bland and bitter. The alcohol is very prevalent and the taste is pretty raw. After drinking a good portion, it smooths out to being decent."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 3/27/2013. Pours moderately hazy golden orange color with a 2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big pear, peach, pineapple, grape, apple, pepper, clove, hay, grass, herbal, candi sugar, rye, bread, light funk, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, Brett, and malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big pear, peach, grape, apple, pepper, clove, herbal, candi sugar, bread, rye, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, pepper, clove, candi sugar, bread, rye, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast flavors with moderate male balance; with a good sweetness/spiciness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately slick, smooth, and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent saison style. All around great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."
"O- Not bad, i have no desire to revisit this beer on my own again, or would i spend money to buy it again, but it was enjoyable."
""
""
""

"Mouthfeel is thick but fluffy. Overall, this seems like a really solid saison, with an interesting little spicy twist from the rye."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This one has a really interesting but rather intense flavor that makes it a sipping beer even though the alcohol is well hidden. Nicely constructed with the brett being a more subtle contributor to the flavor/aroma rather than dominating."
""
""
""
""
""
"This was definitely a surprise to look at but it drank deliciously. It had a dry and earthy yeast that took a back seat to all the sweetness of the fruit and malt. There was a faint woody quality that I thought was very pleasant. Bit of alcohol warmth in the drink but nothing too overdone. The rye sour notes were great with the peach and the after taste was dry and malty."

"Great beer.Very smooth and perfectly balanced. I noticed the character and earthiness coming through. Nice yeast with a bread-like aroma from the malt. I enjoyed that it had definite structure which lasted through a long finish. One of my all-time favorites. Had it with grilled salmon. Wonderful match."

"750ml bottle in a snifter. Hazy amber color. Smell is honey-sweet. Taste is of caramel, fig jam, molasses, light maple syrup. More depth than a typical ""saison," but not terribly complex. Mouthfeel is smooth, easier drinking than than the ABV would suggest."

"Overall fairly surprised at the bros 100 rank but the Brett definitely adds a pretty nice complexity and doesn't overshadow the other grape and hops.. Might buy another bottle to age"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Interested in trying different vintages but this may prove difficult without a bottling date. Aging aside, this bottle is drinking well and I am glad to have tried it, will visit again."
"Though crisp, it does linger as it's a full bodied Belgian style and I much prefer that."
""
"overall, very decent brew. the girlfriend is promising a chaffeur-driven trip to The Bruery for my birthday later this month so that ought to be nice. i like the stuff that comes from them, mostly. i can recommend this one as i could easily drink another . . . . i just dot think it's deserving of a 100 . . . . can definitely taste the alcohol in this one."
""
""
"Overall, not what I expect in this style, but this is a very well crafted and unique tasting beer that is quite memorable."
""
""
"O: While this is a solid offering, this isn't my favorite Saison on the market. First there's the matter of personal preference: I like my Saisons on the fruitier and more robust/yeasty side. This Saison is opposite: rye and spice are showcased in this beer without much fruit to speak of. Additionally, the body of the beer is lighter than I'd like. But my biggest qualm with the beer is the alcohol-forward aftertaste. Instead of being hidden, you taste every bit of the beer's 8.5% ABV. A good, but not great, Saison."
""
"O: A funky, spicy Saison with an enjoyable addition of Brett and rye character."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A bit more daring with more pronounced flavors when compared to Dupont. A respectable American take on the Saison sporting more hop bitterness and a higher ABV, but in the end I'll be reaching for the Belgian touchstone."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Very impressive beer. I tend to prefer saisons with slightly less abv, but this one is put together very nicely. Really unique way that the flavors work together."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This poured out as a nice golden color with some reddish hues. Great looking white head, great retention and some light lacing. The smell is spicy and slightly sweet citrus. The taste has a rye spiciness along with malt sweetness and a subtle sourness. The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, very drinkable brew. Overall this is a very good beer and I shouldn't have waited so long to try it."
"Overall - My bottle is probably 2+ years old, so it has lost it hops and taken on a more rustic flavour, as described by the bottle label. I'd like to try this fresh, but it's still a great beer that when aged seems more fitting for a fall/winter day. This brewer rarely disappoints.."
"O: I know I had a lot to nitpick here, but this is a genuinely well crafted saison that's quite unique. It just doesn't really hit all my preferences in a saison (I prefer a simpler, hoppier interpretation like Tank 7). But if you like funk, this is a must-try."
""
""
""
""
"Saison Rue showcases great complexity, and while light on funkiness, has an authentic Belgian farmhouse character. Excellent texture and flavor profile. While it's not cheap, it's well worth the price if you're even remotely fond of Saisons."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a tasty beer but not quite a conventional Saison. Very much on the sweet end for the style, don't expect a dry beer like Hennepin is."
"Not sure what to think of this one. Love the Bruery but this is not really what I'd consider a saison or a BSPA to be, even as a tribute. If anything, it's a hybrid that works in some ways (fruitiness, sourish finish), but is chaotic in terms of getting the balance I love in this style. Too boozy at times, too sweet, and sometimes muted in displaying the hoppy characteristics or sour Brett yumminess. Sometimes, it's all of this. This is best consumed cold, but I would definitely not turn this down if offered again. However, for $13-14 on the market, it's going to be a tough call."

""

""

"this was good, I just wasn't blown away by it. the pour is more clear than cloudy, with a bright yellow color and a nice white head a few inches tall. the nose isn't as farmy as I thought it would be, its more fresh than that, more spring than late summer, more floral than pollen, more straw than hay. its got a grassy light malt aroma and very little spice, almost like green tea. the flavor is very similar with a straw-like complexion, some subtle citrus notes, and a curious yeast that is not what im used to in a saison. its dry and light, floral, not funky and pungent, makes for a very light and peppy beer. there is also a lot of alcohol in this, especially in the finish, where the higher abv is obvious. its not a knock against it, because it actually works well here, but its again not what they style has come to be in most cases. fine carbonation and a body that's almost too light for its own good. a fun beer, probably overpriced, but one that pushes the mundane American saison in a spirited new direction."
"The beer pours with a very aggressive head made of creamy white bubbles, and it sits well above a two fingers’ width. The beer is a beautiful rustic golden color with an uncontrollable torrent of bubbles racing up to refill the head. The body is cloudy, but relatively clear (I was gentle with the bottle, in order to not stir up the yeast on the bottom of the glass…). The beer’s lacing is thick, leaving a patchwork of webbing across the glass. On the nose, this beer is properly rustic with beautiful saison bread and citrus orange that almost touches upon orange peel and also hints at lemon. The esters are richly complex in the nose, giving off hints of apricot and pineapple, especially as the beer warms up. The brett funk is definitely there as well, but not overpowering in the nose, instead acting more as an underlying emanation beneath all the other smells. In character, the funk tends more towards a salty funk with touches of barnyard. The beer’s smell also features a nice presence of grassy hops in the back of the malts. On the tongue, the beer tastes quite sweet with a rounding acidity and a nice bitter finish. The beer begins with light citrus that opens into bruising bitters that are grassy and zested with lemon bread and a big dose of pineapple. Beneath all of this runs the salty funk that mingles into barnyard territory, but does not get out of hand (which makes me think I should have aged this beer a little longer for my personal tastes). The finish is bitter hops and sticky sweet funked malts that briefly touch upon a cloying note before mellowing into hay and light lingering funk. The booze in the beer (8.5%!) also touches slightly in the back of the throat. On the tongue, the beer is creamy and the head is pure fluff. Carbonation kisses the tongue with a little bit of pressure, but just enough to prep the palate for taste while not abusing it. The mouth is left slightly dry but sticky. Overall, this is a solid saison with a fair amount of grassy bitters and yeasty esters. I sort of wish I aged it a little longer, but only because I personally love the dry and funky saisons. Un-aged, this thing is sweet and complex with some really great flavors. It is a little heavy on the stomach, which makes it more of an imperial saison in my book, but it certainly is tasty and worth a try."
"O - 4.0 - This beer is bright and fresh and light, yet has a number of things going on, which is fun to pick through. It was enjoyable enough but with so many other things to try, I would not buy it again."

"O - Fantastic. The layers of aroma and taste are impressive. I was blown away by this one. I just wish it was a bit cheaper so I could buy much more."
""
""
""
""
"O: I enjoyed the complexity and uniqueness of the beer. Unnoticeable ABV, till midway through glass. Could easily drink too much and get smashed. A little too metallic for my palate. I tend to prefer more fruit flavors. Its a good beer and i understand why people like it. Though, I likely would not purchase again, I would certainly share a bottle. Glad I tried it."
""
""
"Overall: An absolutely original take on a very diverse style. Incredibly complex with plenty of twists and turns for even a seasoned beer enthusiast. A very contemplative, adventurous brew that I would only recommend for someone who really wants their palate challenged. This is definitely going to be in my fridge regularly!"

"Overall: a very nice Saison, full nose body and flavor. Excellent representation of the style."

"This is a nice saison though the flavor was a bit lighter than I had expected or would have preferred. It was still a solid beer that I enjoyed. I'm not sure I'd seek it out again, but I'm glad I had it once."

"O-I enjoyed this saison. It has a nice mix of grassy, herbal flavors and sweet, spicy citrus. A good summer brew in terms of flavor profile. The mouthfeel was great, lots of carbonation but easy drinking and crisp finishing. I will look for this again next spring/summer."
""
""
""
"O: A bit too sweet for the style. I wanted to love this one after reading some reviews but it doesn't live up to others in the style like Saison-Brett or Seizoen Bretta. I think some of the Jester King brews are even better but it's still a tasty beer."
""
""
""
"Overall: A very solid beer at a decent price. I can and can't see how Wine Enthusiast would name this the beer of the year for 2012. I think aging this one would do wonders too. Either way I'm going to seek it out next time I go to the beer store. Worth trying for sure."
""
""
""
"Complex, earthy, fruity spices. I wish this brewer distributed to Texas."
""
"Pours orange with big creamy head. A slight almost red color in there as well. Heavy funk on the nose with a bit of spice and very effervescent. Cant get the head to recede. Goodness! Flavor has up front rye spice and strong brett funk, some hints of pear and other light fruits. Fades into honey and some citrus. Nice flavor profile here. Light mouthfeel with nice carbonation. Well done farmhouse brew."
""
""
"P.S. just poored out the second half of the bottle... i really tried not too."
""
""
"Nice constant head and lacing on this beer. Brewed with Brett but it is 0% sour. Brett is slightly detectable in the smell and a little in the taste(does not completely taste like belgian yeast). Usual belgian yeasty smell and taste. Rye is barely there. Very drinkable but nothing great particularly stands out."
""
""
""
"O: This is simply an awesome brew, through and through! What does it take on here to give a lesser popular style (but still somewhat popular) a perfect review? Not sure, but this comes pretty damn close."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Best farmhouse ale I’ve ever had."
""
"D: Beer tastes too fresh. Would love to age this one for a couple years to develop more distinct flavors. Love the brewery and a funky saison is my current go-to-style but this does not stand out as expecting."
"M - Medium body. Creamy. Moderate carbonation."
""
""
""
""
"A really unique offering; lots of things going on here in terms of aroma and flavor. Maybe not one that I would order again, but certainly one that I would purchase and cellar to see how time affects the Brett allowing the richer flavors to dominate."

""

"M: tons of nice creamy mouthfeel, great fizzy champagne-like carbonation, and a medium body"

"I don't drink a lot of Saisons, but I am always trying to broaden my experience with different styles. What I like about this one is that it's true to the style. You get the refreshing, faint tart fruit notes but the spices do not come to the foreground. Moreover, I get no clove (which I understand is a bad thing in this style). If I could change anything about this, I would (somehow) dial down the sweetness on the back of the palate just a bit and introduce just a bit more of that peppery note instead. Anyway, I could sip on this thing all day. It's a perfect weekend afternoon treat."
""
"O: An excellent saison. Light, crisp, airy and refreshing. A bit tart and funky but not enough to ruin it. Nice balance and strength of flavor for a saison."
"O - With each sip I take, I am liking this beer more and more. It's just a really well crafted, interesting, and complex brew with many layers of depth - it's quite the task to pick out all the flavors and nuances. A fine job was also done with the use of the Brett - enough to provide some funk that's harmonious with the accompanying flavors and not overpowering. Without a doubt, this is a saison that I'd love to have again in the future."
""
"O-a tasty Saison, well-balanced"
""
""
""
""
"Overall I liked this saison -- my first beer from The Bruery."
""
""
""
""
"O - Expect nothing less from the Bruery. Wouldn't mind more funk. Going to sit on one of these for a few years and will report back."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D - A good saison - don't detect much of the rye. A little bit filling from the hefty carbonation. A good all around saison."
""
""
"I'd love to toy with this one in the cellar. Looks like I'm driving back to Hudson soon..."
""
""
"O: Overall, wow, just wow. I've heard good things, but this is just amazing. It's complex, smooth and delicious. Most saison's are either end of the spectrum, this is smack dab in the middle, damn near perfect."
"Medium body, a sharp, up front, kind of effervescence, all on the tip of the tongue. Warming from the middle onwards. A pretty serious coating of the tongue and upper palate develops. Pretty good but not the best saison I've had."

"I'm not a big saison guy, but I liked this one. Really complex, hid the alcohol, just a good example of it. I think I still have one bottle laying around, so hopefully that one continues to brett up."
"O: A top notch saison from the Bruery. Perfect for a very hot 4th of July."
""
""

"Overall: Another solid offering from the bruery. Good saison for summer time hot weather beer drinking."

"To try more, but one & done for me w/ this Saison."

""
"O: A superlative saison that merits praise and commendation. The balance on offer is truly excellent, and I am glad to have tasted this bottle of beer. Highly recommended to lovers of saisons."
""
""
""
""
"O - Fantadtically interesting but really not my cup of tea. I like I'm less spicy and herbal and more sour and fruity."
""
"Overall this is a great Rye ale and I great saison. Normally I find saisons boring and uninteresting but the rye maltiness makes this more more enjoyable and complex overall. A really great beer for all seasons and makes a great complementary beverage with a summer grilled dinner."
""
""
"Overall - Beautifully balanced and delicious. I bet it gets even better with time, particularly if you love that funk. So good."

"I recommend this beer. It comes out seasonally. It isn't a hard to get beer if you pay attention to release timing. I think I will try to age my next bottle for two years."

"O: I really like this beer. Very refreshing, tasty, and complex. There's a lot going on, but the beer is not muddy, and is not overly intense in any of its attributes (ie sour, spicy, funky). I think the rye is adding a lot and giving the beer a very down-to-earth feel, perhaps because the mild spice and mouthfeel. I plan to pick up a bottle for aging, because I can see this really changing positively (ie more funk) with some age (not that it isn't great now)."
"O: This beer is pretty drinkable and also refreshing."
""
""
""
"Overall, very nice and interesting saison. The rye has a dramatic impact and the brett is nicely integrated. Yum."
"O–Not as funky as I would have liked for a farmhouse style. Its an exceptional brew but I wanted The Meters, not Stevie Wonder—both are superb; one drops raw funk, this is more refined. Worth seeking out, just expect a refined beer and not the rugged, wild excellence that should be associated with a farmhouse style."
""
""
""
""
"O. Definitely not one for everyday drinking, but very nice indeed. I really want to pair this with some food. Next time."
""
""
"Poured from bottle to Duvel tulip the beer arrives a mostly clear amber color with a 1.5 finger white head, good retention and lacing. The nose is rather muted. Hints of wild yeast, pineapple, and a hint of biscuit. Not much to report, not bad just not powerful. The flavor is way more intense and is immediately appealing on the tongue. Starts with a tart fruity character (pineapple and apples and citrus) that blends well with the brett and yeast to create a unique and flavorful beer. Mildly bitter. Not hint of the alcohol at all, very appealing. Well carbonated the beer finishes dry with a lingering fruity funk. Medium bodied. Overall, another fantastic beer from The Bruery, highly recommended."
""
"O: I wasn't overly impressed at first, this beer is solid. The flavors meld so well together that it transitions without notice. It's wonderful. A great Saison (if you want something with a little belgian kick)."
""
""
"O- Can The Bruery do no wrong?"
"O-a fantastic saison. the flavors are subtle, but they're quite nice. i had most of the bottle and i probably could've enjoyed another one. i love the brett and wish this was more easily available to me. all saison fans should try this, its one of my favorites."
""
"O - A saison that delivers and doesn't disappoint."
""
"O- A nicely nuanced saison. The brett and malt character are a great addition. The great qualities of a Saison remain, but this beer has a beautiful level of complexity that makes drinking it a joy."
"Drink- This to me was a mix of Rugbrod and a nice saison. I enjoyed the layers in it. Havent had this one in a while so was nice to come back to an original."
"D - Very drinkable. Really nice balanced Saison. The brett really adds a nice complexity to the beer that balances well with the spice and yeast."
""
"O: a good beer, I wish the Brett funk was a little more and the belgiany bannana was a little less, but I'm not a huge fan of this style in general, and for a saison I like this, bit I feel it could've been better.... Perhaps if I drank it super fresh."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a light tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Thin streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grains, fruits, and some Brett funk. Taste is of grain, Brett funk, and some slight fruity flavors. There is a medium amount of bitterness that lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good saison with a nice amount of funk in the aroma and flavor."
""
"Nice crisp and refreshing mouthfeel with a lively and bubbly carbonation to add to the texture. Overall, as expected, Saison Rue is a top notch beer. Not quite as funky or earthy as some saisons but still a strong yeast note with the bready rye makes for a damn fine beverage."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M-light clean and crisp. very nice. DOES NOT SEEM LIKE A 8.5%!! BE WARNED!! Goes down very easily."
"O: When I first poured this beer I didn't think I'd enjoy it, but it is really flipping good! I think the bar was just set way too high for my first saison."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: great beer, stacks up well with some fantastic saisons I've had in the last week. Can't wait to try more of The Bruery's seasonals."
"Fantastic saison that has a myriad of elements: bitterness, floral brett/hop notes, brett funk and sourness. It drinks well and has definite pilsner malt notes that make it feel genuine."
"Not too overpriced and it was in fact purchased off the shelf (a rarity in CNY), so I gotta say this one's a ""go."" Last night I was drinking a saison-brett from boulevard thinking that it was pure excellence, but this beer's pretty damn good as well!"
""
"O- (Hands clapping!!!) Absolutely brilliant Patrick!!! Everything you could ask for in a Saison."
""
""
""
"Overall: Saison Rue is the class of American saisons and my favorite beer in the style. It has an incredible complexity, with the Brettanomyces and rye doing wondrous yet subtle work. A must for any fan of the style and a perfect introduction to one of the United States' most talented breweries."
""
""
""
"O: This is a really nice example of this Belgian style, very rustic and earthy. It's nicely complex."
""
""
""
""
""
"I have been on something of a Rye trip lately. It started with sampling Rye IPAs first, and then several Rye Whiskies, and then I found this Rye Saison. The beer poured a pale golden color and formed a large, creamy looking head. The look was very similar to Duvel, but the strong musty Brett aroma let me know that I was sampling something else altogether. The smell had floral, tart, vinous character, perfect for a farmhouse ale. The taste was dusty dry, with Brett funk in the beginning of the sip. This was followed by a pear like flavor, and finished off with a peppery spiciness. There wasn't much of a rye influence, as the Brett pretty much drove everything else into submission. The aftertaste was herbal with touch of juniper. Very light in the mouth, and easy to drink. The alcohol content was well hidden under these layers, and crept up on you with some warmth. Very good interpretation of the style."
""
""
"Pours a medium gold color with a good two finger off white head. Good lacing on the side of my snifter glass. The nose is brett, yeast, light fruit, and some spices. A very nice nose- not too strong, not too weak. The taste is toast, yeast, spices, brett, and light fruit, maybe apricot. A definite step up from the nose (which was pretty darn good). The brett flavors are just about perfect- they're out front, but still balanced in with the other players. Feel is tart, bready, malty and funky, with a nice brett aftertaste. Overall, this is a really good Saison, and one of the best beers I've had from this brewery. Cheers."

"O - This is an excellent saison that definitely has a lot going for it. I ding it a little for drinkability; it fills you up quickly and isn't as refreshing as some saisons that I've had."

"O - Great saison from the Bruery. One of the better saisons I've had. I definitely recommend this one to anyone who is a fan of the style."
"Hazed gold-orange, a thin white strip of foam deposits heavy curtains of lace on the glass. Bright citrus first - lemon and orange mostly, followed by sharp pine, black pepper, and rustic rye malt. Bread crust and cereals come out as it warms up. The subtle undercurrent of Brettanomyces - like new leather, lemon peel, and wild herbs - gives just enough depth. The bright hoppiness and mild Brett indicates this is a young sample. A top American Saison."
""
"Had a glass at The Bruery, and received a bottle for my birthday. Came out with an above average head, and took a little time for it to go away. The color was a light amber gold and translucent. The scent had a strong summery smell, and had heavy hints of rye and malt scents. The beer itself was fairly light, and wasn't too overwhelming. The flavors reflected the scent quite well, and had small hints of fruit, but i couldn't put my finger on what kind of fruit - just had that fruity twinge at the end of every sip. Wouldn't mind if this were my birthday gift every year."
"Overall: A fine brew, as close to a biere de champagne as it is to a saison. The rye spice and brett make for a nice combination, neither is overstated. This has been in my cellar for quite some time, and could be stored indefinately, as this has showed it can hold up very well."
""
""
""
""
""
"This one pours a beautiful hazy straw yellow that moves into a darker, almost copper shade at the top. Great head retention makes this look like a nearly perfect saison. The smell is very subtle. The Brett doesn't present itself blatantly. Citrus, a little funk, but also a lot of spice character. I guess this makes it a pretty average saison, tast wise, initially. Gets more complex as it drinks/ warms up. Drinks easily, good carbonation. Gets more dry towards the end. I just wish the Brett was more prevalent."
"O - Really solid brew. The funkiness from the brett is balanced really well by the rye, peppery flavor, making it very smooth and drinkable. Good Stuff"
""
""
""
""
" ~ One thing that should certainly not be overlooked with this beverage is the 'head' that come with it. One of the better I've had in a long time. The look and texture of the beverage are also great characters. If I had brewed this beer I don't know if I would have thought it to be anything special considering the flavors. Which lends me to wonder if this is what the brewers were attempting to create, or if this is what they created with the ingredients they used. Either way, it's interesting, and interesting goes along way in my book. Especially when it looks and feels the way it does. I can't help but wonder if the flavor character would have developed better if I had let it cellar for another year."
""
"Not a style I go to very often but I was in the mood for a little something different last night.Poured into a chalice a deep orane infused amber with a nice fluffy one finger head atop that held very well.Sharp spice mixed with a little funk in the nosesome green apple and phenols rounded it out.The rye really came out on the palate lending some sharpness and a light lactic note,a little funky but it didnt overpower the flavor profile,again some green aplle and clove-like spice as well.I really liked the saison it's complex but not over the top in its funkiness."
""
""
"O - Flavorful and thought provoking. With the brett and rye, it's probably close to what you'd have found back on a farm in Belgium."

"O - A very good saison. The rye is a nice complement. Not sure how this compares to fresh, but I really enjoyed this bottle and would definitely get this again."
"Another great opportunity to try another great one from The Bruery. This beer pours a dark orange, with a large off white head. Smells great.. That typical barnyard funk due to the Brett. Some grapes, citrus, and spice from the Belgian yeast. Tastes slightly tart of sour apples, grapes, alcohol, yeast spice, some of that barnyard Brett funk, and lemons. All balances very well. After taste is a little tart and drying with mostly the yeast funk lingering. This beer laced very well through out the duration of drinking. Over all VERY good beer, try it!"
"O - An amazing job done with this beer. I have never had a belgian style farmhouse, but the Bruery makes it work. I am excited to try more from this brewery."
"Solid take on a Brett based Saison, not my favorite but certainly worth a look, cheers!"
"O: I was expecting more from this, but it's good. It's subtle and easy to drink though, which I like in a beer."
"Overall a very nice and unique Saison. Love the addition of the rye and the Brett. Everything works really well together."
"O: Very complex and very different than Saison Dupont. I really enjoyed it though and wish I could taste this, Dupont and Hennepin side by side."
"If I get more of this beer, I'm sitting on it for even longer."
"O_The hops provide a good dose of bitterness and I would say the end result is more bitter than I was expecting. This is a hopped up stronger saison. I think I have a relatively new bottle so I am sure the hops would fade a bit with some aging. Looking forward to trying my other bottle in about 6 months"
"O: expected it to be a bit more complex. Alcohol is fairly harsh. Not the best Bruery I've ever had, but even their bad beers are ok beers."
"O: This is and has been in the past for me a decent beer but nothing I would hope to find. It's ok for what it is but in the end I feel it's too sweet and that it's flavors are mostly confused into one another."
"This is a really good saison, one I'll have again. Well done Bruery!"
"O: A surprisingly drinkable saison, particularly given the high ABV."
"I love this beer. It's a great twist on one of my favorite styles. The saison flavoring, body, and smell are very well balanced between the belgian yeast flavor and the smell of fresh hay/grass. The Bretts are such an interesting addition--they aren't as powerful as they are in a true sour, but add just a hint of tartness that really makes this an exceptional beer. If you like saisons and sours, I would highly recommend you try this ASAP."
"O: Very nice and quite complex. An excellent effort from the Bruery."
"O: B+"
"Dr: Very drinkable - a feat that is difficult to accomplish in this style and at this high an ABV."
"Easily one of the best beers I've tried in recent memory. If The Bruery was available here I'd have this one on hand at all times."
"I am impressed. This Saison is traditional yet unique. Very well done. A great new twist on an old style."
"D: where's the booze? This one's as drinkable as the next saison, but at a much higher gravity. I'm becoming more and more impressed with The Bruery as I continue to work through their offerings. Saison Rue is one of the best American saisons I've sampled to date."
"O- A decent beer no doubt, but short of excellent and not my ""go-to"" for the style. Only my second success with Bruery beers - glad to find another one (besides Hottenroth) that's solid."
"It pours a golden straw with some foam. There’s a wonderful, gentle aroma to this one, with some funk, some cider to the nose. A tantalizing effervescence on the palate. The flavors dance around as you sip. I pick up some tepache flavors, a sweet and musty, earthy fermented pineapple-ness. There’s a dry finish, lots of yeasty esters, great finish. A wonderfully delicious beer, well worth the search."
"T: Grain, a touch of funk, belgian yeast, some rye and some faint earthy hops. Didn't really have that nice funk that the great saisons do."
"Medium bodied and mostly soft. Rustic but well-rounded. Nice."
"O: Very nice. There is a kinda salty taste that builds up over time. Wierd. 4"
"A nice and intense saison with lots of great dry malt character."
"Overall: This is a very good Saison. Recommended."
"Overall: Yep, I like it :)"
"Although I've never had The Bruery's Black Tuesday, it lead me to investigate their other offerings. Surprisingly, a few were available at my local Whole Foods. This is a very light, crisp beer. Even with the glass tilted to the side and poured slowly, the head on this is monstrous and takes a while to dissipate. A mildly bretted beer, it's got just the slightest tinge of sourness to it. Glad I got a chance to try this. Enjoyable, but likely not one I'd come back to."
"I like the nose, but the taste is nothing extradoardinary. Tasty beer however."
"O- I prefer the Saison de Lente from the Bruery, but this one isn't bad"
"I found a similarity to Orval here, though this one is more earthy and bitter. Great stuff, though I'd be curious to try it fresh when those hops on the nose might still be a part of the flavour."
"O: This is a complex Saison with a lot of character, but it's still eminently drinkable. Happy I found it."
"Overall: Good beer to have on a 100 degree califonia summer playing in the sun or working hard in the sun and you just need to cool down. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys this style."
"Overall, an interesting twist on a summer ale. The brett mixes well with the typical slightly warm and spicy saison flavors. In a way the brett dominates some of the corriander and clove flavors but it adds it's own totally unique flavors. It's not too sour, not too sweet but it's also not for everyone. This has that very distinct dry, slightly sour brett flavor you find in some sour ales."
"O: It is certainly unique. To me, there were some flavor characteristics that were missing, and the sweetness of the malts were a little too heavy for my liking. However, overall it was a solid beer. I enjoyed it, and would try it again if for no other reason out of curiosity, but I am no exactly running to the store to buy out the rest of the stock."
"I didn't really have high hopes for this, but it's delivered for sure. Drinkable, pleasant, good blend. The best offering I've had from the Bruery so far."
"Solidly crafted and hard to fault, other than that for mine the taste doesn't quite live up to the aroma."
"Overall - I love this beer because it is so fun satisfying and interesting to drink. Certainly it has an utterly fantastic and complex flavor, but it also has a nice bitterness to it and a lovely feel on the to tongue. Certainly a beer that would excite a beer connoisseur."
"O - Nice beer, an interesting take on a Saison."
"Saison Rue has a nice weight to its light to medium body and the carbonation levels come off as creamy. This has a great mouthfeel for a saison with so much going on. Overall, I liked this beer but also felt there was an opportunity for more definition and less general complexity. I’d happily have this again sometime down the line."
"Pours a golden brown, with a soapy white head of 4+ fingers. Some sediment gets into this, even after careful adherence to the directions on the bottle and with the most careful of pours. Some sticky, splotchy lace with great retention. Nose is dry, some citrus, bread, lemongrass in the distance, spice (pepper?). Taste has lemon, light citrus, some alcohol and a bit of ginger perhaps. Some fruit skins and hints to sweetness but never really becomes so. High carbonation but light body. Dry finish and super refreshing, and ideal for the scorcher of an evening it was."
"Notes: One of the better offerings from the Bruery that I have been lucky to try. This shines and would love to keep a bottle or two around on a regular basis."
"O - Overall a nice beer. I get a lot on the nose, it's quite enjoyable to drink over the course of an evening, and this lives up to Bruery's standard quality."
"Pours a hazy orange amber color, huge poof of off white head, decent retention. Scent is bigger on the musty barnyard funk from the brett than i expected, backbone is a spicy and earthy grain. Taste brings a spicy kick from the rye, brett hits with some decent strength - more musty barnyard funk then expected for the style. Medium bodied, active carbonation, dry. A nice take on the style with a touch too much brett covering up a good base beer."
"Nice feel to it, this is like a saison on roids, a lot going on. One glass (ok, bottle) is enough. Darn good"
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side for the style and carbonation is moderate. overall it was a very flavorful beer, and everything came together in it pretty well. I liked the Brett and rye a lot, but the herbal flavors were just a little too potent for me personally. Very drinkable and enjoyable beer, but a little short of some of the top beers of the style."
"Well this is not my favorite saison it is certainly a well executed beer which is balanced and unique."
"Appearance is an amber tone with a good sized head that does not sit atop very long. Its` smell has citrus, pepper, yeast, a lot going on in a good way. The taste The taste has quite a bit of spice, apple, raisins, brett, some general booze. MF is medium, finishes with some bitterness. This is a very good saison from The Bruery and will not disappoint those who enjoy the style."
"O – Delicious, restrained, complex and well balanced."
"Very good beer. While not my favorite beer for the style it would be a potential go to if it were available in my area. Pleasant depth of flavor, very well balanced. Easy to drink and enjoyable."
"O- I really enjoy this beer. Slightly off style but a big hit with the rye influence. Good brett character and light enough for a warm spring day. I'm not a huge fan of the heavy carbonation that is standard for the style, but the flavor profile of this one is well worth it."
"Overall: A beautiful, unique red saison. Food-wise, I would recommend pairing with a lighter, acidic food. This would be a good gateway beer for someone just becomming acclimated to the funkier style. Give this one a try!"
"Overall: Excellent tasty twist on the saison. A little sweeter thoughout and doesn't finish as dry as I might like, but damn good. Paired well with sitting on the deck at dusk in 70 degree weather."
"Overall - Saisons are beers that have very few rules to adhere to so this is a perfect example of the creativity of the style. Enough bite to get you thinking but also smooth enough to just site and relax with. For fans of Cabs and Merlots."
"O: The beer is relatively easy to drink because the alcohol is well hidden, although the spicy flavors make it more of a beer that needs to be sipped."
"Since I've had several Saisons this evening I figured I may as well crack open a bottle of Saison Rue, which I've been sitting on for about four months. 750 mL bottle into a tulip glass. Pours a light golden to copper hue, with minimal head. Aroma is subdued, especially for a Saison. Nose is mostly sweet, with some notes of banana and bubblegum. There's some light spiciness in the background as well. Mouthfeel is effervescent and champagne like, with a semi-sweet aftertaste. Surprising amount of spice. The light banana aroma translates into the taste, along with a leather-like taste of recognizable Brett and a drawn out spicy finish. There's some alcohol in the finish and some alcohol warming as you drink it, as this beer certainly packs a punch. My only complaints about this beer would be the subdued aroma, but otherwise it's just about as good as you can get."
"O - So unique and interesting. Tastes good and is a very cool beer. Drinks easy, is refreshing, and makes your tastebuds work!"
"O - This is a great beer, a few of these are getting put away for sure."
"D - Overall, a very different saison than I have ever had. Brett yeast was very unique to this beer. I hadn't ever tasted the leather characteristic in this type of beer. This beer was decent, I would get it again, but it isn't the best saison I have ever tasted."
"The taste has loads of toasted mlats adding notes of bread, biscuits, and caramel. With the brett. yeast adding tart fruity flavors of green apples and currants. The hops drop an earthy twang to all of these falvors to balance them out. Very nice dinner beer."
"Overall a really complex and unique beer. I'm heating up quick from this one, but I like it."
"Had this Bruery beer recently alongside the Mischief - overall, this won out for me against the two, but both were a little strange. This in particular is like an off-kilter saison. Pours a nice light orange with lots of head. With all the carbonation it kind of reeks, mostly citrus smells with a bit of green fruit. Quite an odd taste. Very bitter. I think some of the strangeness of the taste comes in part from the apple and in part from the Brett. To me, the latter is overpowering to a point where the whole mission gets lost. I think the green fruits are a great complement, but something gets lost in the sourness and bitterness of it all. Maybe I'm being too critical, but for me, this had a touch of a spoiled taste to it, but not spoiled enough for me not to recommend it. Will have to try it again in the future."
"I found myself gulping this gusher, yet enjoying every second. Really well done. Man I wish the Bruery was in Texas!"
"Yes, I'll take another. Complex but not heavy and overbearing. Delicious comes to mind. Interesting take on the Saison."
"Pours a pale orange/amber with a really bright while head. Frothy two-finger head, well carbonated, great retention and lacing. Aroma of dark fruits, wild yeast, spice and caramel malt. Very complex flavor profile. Yeast off the bat, bready. Tart green aplple. A lot of cracked pepper and spiciness in the body. Dark fruits and caramel malt begin to round out the flavor profile. Spices and tartness linger into the aftertaste. No heat. Very nice. Bubbly, crisp mouthfeel, but a tad sticky at the same time. Complexity keeps me going back for more."
"Drinkability - I have had this before when it is a bit more fresh and enjoyed it. The yeast really took over the balancing citrus notes and it became overly spicy with too much bite. While not undrinkable or bad, I found it too be a little overwhelming. One bottle is more than enough."
"While I really liked this, nothing about it really screamed out ""saison"" to me. Of course, since saison is such an eclectic style, I won't hold that against this beer. However, if you're popping this open, expecting a run of the mill saison... don't. You're still going to enjoy it! Cheers!"
"D-This is a great example of an alcohol forward Saison, the heat really adds to the beer. I also was really pleased with the rye character, however the carb really harms the flavor, and I would like to either see a little more funk, or a reduction in those darker fruit flavors. The beer was a bit unexpected, but a (mostly) welcome departure from the style. In a sea of ""extreme"" beers and breweries doing something different just because its different The Bruery is a refreshing example of how styles can be pushed with some really positive and interesting results."
"Pours a hazy, dark golden color with a medium white head. Scent is very grassy with some nice barnyard funk. Some very spicy aromas as well. This smells like it's going to be a delicious beer. Taste has some light bread characteristics with a lot of spiciness. I also get some banana and green apples as well. You can taste the rye in the finish, along with some bitter hops. There is some very very very little tartness throughout each sip, but very little. The same goes for the Brett flavors. You can kinda taste the alcohol toward the end of each taste as well. This is a tasty beer! I'm kinda biased though, because I love saisons. Mouthfeel is full bodied with nice carbonation. Drinkability is high."
"D: Easy drinking, and not too funky for those not all that into brett. Overall, though, I think a bottle of Saison Dupont or Hennepin is a better investment if you want a more classic style. The pleasant nose and vaguely cidery taste will have many fans, but in the scheme of saisons, it's no Dupont or Fantome."
"D: A nice refreshing Farmhouse Ale. A wonderful sipping ale, definitely worth a try."
"Great beer. Split it with a friend and we just sort of sipped it for about 30 minutes. Felt like drinking a nice champagne, its flavor and carbonation lent itself to a nice casual sip. Smelled like apricots and tropical fruits to us, and citrus in the taste was apparent. It has a sour character, i assume because of the Brettanomyces, but its not overpowering. Actually adds an element that would otherwise be missed on the back end. I can imagine drinking this on a summer's day and feeling refreshed. I am usually not a fan of drinking beer on its own, without food, but i would make an exception for this brew. Love The Bruery. Keep it up."
"Very layered; complex; pleading and drinkable. A well made and somewhat unique saison;appealing."
"D- Altogether a pretty good saison. That being said, I would choose the Saison de Lente pretty quickly over this one. That shouldn't stop you from trying this one though."
"The first thing I notice in the mouthfeel is that is encompasses your mouth, almost like it foams up as you drink it, which is weird. It is also super prickly, almost like eating a hot pepper then dousing your tongue with something super carbonated, it is that bad. The flavor isn't as good as I would have expected. It has that lemon cleaning solution character to it. The rye comes through pretty heavily in the flavor with some spicy bread notes. It is super sweet as well. It is just a messy saison ale."
"Pours a deep brown color with an off white head and a good amount of lacing. Smells of lemon, and citrus peel, spices and other complexities. Tastes of lemon, a little sourness, spice, and a little bitterness from hops. Mouthfeel is medium and has a little carbonation. Drinkability is medium."
"D - Overall a very good drink; I had this with some mussels and matched up very well; it was easy to drink and very enjoyable at the dinner table; well-balanced and a great Saison along with Goose Island's Sofie"
"D: Extremely drinkable. A wonderful saison...one of my favorites. Can't wait to have it again...seek it out!"
"Medium bodied with soft carbonation up front and slight champagne like effervescence. Earthy and slightly tart with subtle hops and crisp, light fruit, notably strawberry, apple and pear. Crisp, light and refreshing with a creamy presence mid-palate and dry finish."
"Green 750 mL bottle with no freshness date. Unfiltered, bottle-conditioned, brewed with rye and brettanomyces and hopped to 30 IBUs. Pours a crystal-clear amber/gold, with lots of carbonation and a voluminous head that slowly climbs out of the glass. Smells toasty, fruity and spicy/peppery, with a few perfumy notes. A bit sweet on the palate, with additions of green/spicy hops, mild bitterness, oranges, and an earthy spiciness. The body is light and dry, very effervescent, with a hint of dextrins. I didn't really pick up a lot of rye, and the brett only makes itself known as a lightly earthy funk, but it tastes very authentic and ranks up there with the best of the Belgian saisons."
"This was my first beer from The Bruery and I'll definitely have to try some of their other offerings because I loved Saison Rue."
"Good stuff, just not really pretty to look at."
"Overall/notes - I wish the Bruery distributed to Missouri. That's really all I can say. This is the best Saison out of the few I've had by a long shot! Really unique approach, too. Awesome, awesome, awesome."
"While some farmhouse style ales are better after a few hours working outside in the sun...this one is perfect after cleaning the gutters and other rain-related tasks. Tasty, though I see this priced anywhere from $11.99 to $20+ for no apparent reason."
"Just an all around great Saison. Up there with Saison Brett as one of my favorite American examples. A treat every time I get to try it, and something I highly recommend."
"Popped from a champagne style bottle that had been aged one year. Lively carbonation with an immense head that lasts and lasts. Funky brett nose with notes of leather and earthiness. Very light mouthfeel, possibly because of the carbonation. Complex. The brett has done wonders in this beer. I think another year in the bottle would make this beer epic. Funky stable and leather. Mild hop bite. Dry finish. This is a great beer with even more potential!"
"D: This beer is remarkably adventurous for being a flagship recipe of a young brewery. Flavors are interesting and refreshing, with well-behaved brett character that is characteristic of the Bruery. Whether by design or by happy accident the textures and effects on the palate are repeatedly grin-inducing and elevate this beer beyond the ability of the other sensory qualities. Saison Rue stands out as a noteworthy American Saison, but is edged out by the stylistic accuracy of the Bruery's spring seasonal, Saison de Lente."
"Overall this beer goes down way too easy and is very complex, fairly dry and just plain lovable."
"D: A truly great saison. Very original, complex and quite tasty."
"D: Solid. Finished the 750ml with ease. Could see getting into a second on a long hot summer evening."
"Overall- An absolutely great brew but the anise just kept throwing me off. I swear I tasted Jagermeister and it was driving me crazy."
"I poured from a bottle into a pair of SA perfect pint glasses, I had to use a pair because the beer was a gusher. The beer is straw yellow in color and pours with a good 4 inches of head. The beer does leave beutiful lacing, but you have to wait 10 minutes to drink it. The aroma is funky with barnyard and wet hay qualities. It has a nice mix of funk and citrus qualities, and a drying finish. The beer is light, well carbonated and very tasty. I dinged it because it is a gusher(from reading reviews a very common problem). The gushiness, and rather high price point mean I will look to other saisons for my next purchase."
"O: a bit too sweet for my tastes. I like my Belgians (and esp. Saisons) to finish dry. Not a good example of the style and rather average taste, in my opinion."
"The beer is a very hazy yellow hue with a massive head that has excellent retention and leaves ample lacing on the glass. There is a copious amount of sediment floating aimlessly about. The aroma is of Belgian yeast, floral scents, malts, yeast, spices, oranges. The beer is quite flavorful and bold. It's definitely a solid beer and a good example of the style. Recommended."
"Overall a fantastic beer, one of the best saisons I have had in a while. I find some saisons have an off-putting peppery taste and this one did not. A nearly perfect saison."
"D: This beer is very nice for the style and I could enjoy it for a long time. I will look for this one again, for sure."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink, but the spiciness and ABV might prevent me from having too many glasses."
"poured a hazy orange with golden yellow highlights that had a finger of head and left some good bubbly lacing sticking to the glass. the aroma was of belgian yeast, spice, very light fruitinees, and clove like character in the background. the taste also had the belgian yeast qualities with spice and clove accents but still maintained a touch of sweet fruitiness. the brew was medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a sweet, slight funky, fruity, spice, and prickly finish. it drank very good and was a good interpretation of a saison."
"Oh, no. The Bruery has done it again for me. Every time I'm expecting something big, exciting and robust, and there's always an insipidness to their beers. It's happened every time so far, and I'm wondering how long I can continue to stick it out."
"D - While not my favorite saison of all time a very good effort and one I would like to drink again."
"The taste is of a bit of light malt as well as light pepper, spice, and yeast. Nice flavor profile and fairly unique. Good feel with some nice carbonation, and the spicing treats this well. Another good brew from the folks in Placentia."
"poured from a 750 ml bottle it was it was a slightly hazy copper orange color with a 1.5 finger head and nice sticky lacing..smell was spicy with clove and fruit bananas.apples and pears mixed with yeast and rye..taste was the same its a classic saison but the yeast and the rye infused is very good its a heavier saison but very tasty clove and fruit are melded with rye and spices ..mouth feel is medium full with good carbonation..this one could be aged for a better flavor profile but i could not wait..solid saison very drinkable"
"D - Certainly drinkable, but I'm damn near spent finishing the rest of the bottle. Possibly the best saison I've ever had. I'll continue to try more from the Bruery, they have yet to fail me and I'm certainly going to buy this little bit of deliciousness again."
"D: I find this to be a very good beer in regards to the overall tastes and ease of drinking. Not only that, but there is also a barrier that has been pushed with the style. The traditional saison is represented in this brew, but there is a element that puts this beer in a realm of its own."
"D - Delicious and refreshing with some nice crispness. Good ABV."
"Price = $11.49 at Witherspoon Wines"
"This is very drinkable for its ABV and has upped my like of Saisons. I would recommend this to all."
"D - This is a very good Saison one that I could drink more than my fair share of in a sitting this beer is worth tracking down to try"
"D - wouldnt have again and if i did i would probably eat something with it to see if it would enhance the beer"
"A tasty brew with layers of meanness and sourness with each additional sip."
"Drinkability: Saisons are my favorite style so I naturally enjoyed this and could have more. However, I think there are much better saisons both from the U.S. and Belgium."
"Can a beer redefine a style? We'll leave that for debate as Saison Rue bends the style with an array of complexities that unfold as it warms with each sip. One of the top 10 beers we've had in 2008 to date."
"D: Wow. This is an exceptional saison. You have the gold standard (Dupont) and then you have beers like this that take it up a notch. The price was even reasonable (12 bucks). I wish this was easier for me to aquire. I'm stocking up when I can find this again."
"D: This is a beer that grew on me as I drank it. Its flavor is initially, but becomes very drinkable as you go long."
"jd"
"I do wonder if letting this beer age for 2 years will unleash the Bretts and turn this beer tart and sour?! I'll toss a bottle in the cellar and find out."
"D- stellar aroma on this one. that alone has me hooked, but it's awesome in all other aspects too. great yeast and malt combination with just the right tough of hops. high abv is dangerous in such a complex brew. strangely thirst quenching hurts even more. blaze on, saison."
"Bottle via trade with Viper666. Hazy orange pour with sick head retention and lacing. Big brett nose, apple, cloves, citrus, and grain also present. Taste is quite spicy/yeasty sweet up front (something fruity - apricots) with a dry bitter finale and lots of alcohol. Palate is quite lively and dry. This is good but pretty harsh."
"Autumn Maple, 10% abv"
"D: Doesn't drink like a Saison to me. A bit too malty and a bit too spicy (cinnamon and allspice)."
"The Bruery's Saison Rue is a nice saison, though not without faults. The beer was beautiful poured into a tulip glass with a translucent lemonade-like pale yellow color that was vigorously effervescent forming a billowing white cap. The smell was earthy and musty from brett with hints of lemon and tangerines. The beer was very thick, despite the ample carbonation, and the flavor was chalky and peppery with a tart meyer lemon and biscuity malt. The beer was far too chewy and thick and high in alcohol. A saison was designed as thirst-quenching for farmers coming home from the fields and at 8.5% this chewy beer would fill you up before dinner. I think that by packing in all the tasty flavors the drinkability of the beer really suffers."
"This is a deep hazy golden brew with a huge bubbly white head out of the bottle - some sediment floating on the foam. Once things settle down and this one warms up a bit, there is a interesting peppery aroma with lots of lacing. Flavor profile is of white pepper with apricot notes. A little biscuit-bread and then a little citrus. This is one complex brew, very satisfying and tasty as it warms."
"D: While not bad in any respect, this beer falls a little short for me. Not enough funk."
"Saison Rue is the one we started off with and it was anice. More body than I rememebred from Leinte a few months ago and less sour. But still a wrold class saison. Nice and earthy aromas and flavors and sublte sourness."
"D- Thoroughly drinkable and absolutely refreshing. Did not strike me as an 8.5% beer in the least. The flavors are dynamic enough that the drinkability on this one is quite high."
"D - This is a weird beer. Very strange yet intriguing. Not exactly quenching but complex and interesting. Good nonetheless."
"**From notes taken on 6/15/10**"
" I like this very much, will buy again."
"Pours a deep copper/honey color with a thin white head. Smells of spices, sweet fruits, a bit of yeast, and a grainy rye herbal quality that givds this a very distinctive aroma. The flavor of spices is very pronounced but is also very sweet with some very peculiar flavors. Tastes very similar to something else I've had."
"Opinion: Taste is a bit too sweet. A slightly drier finish would have been preferred. Finish is a tad phenolic (band-aid). Alcohol heat is a bit too strong. As beer warms dryness improves. Interesting, but ultimately a decent-to-good Saison."
"This was a stunning beer visually and texturally and certainly had lovely aromas and a fine taste."
"D: A delicious, interesting, and funky beer"
"Overall a very pleasant example of the style. I continue to be impressed with what this young brewery has put out."
"With more attention paid to carbonation, Saison Rue (named for The Bruery founder and head honcho Patrick Rue) could be superb beer. Hell, it's most of the way there already. Glad this is a seasonal. Not so glad that it isn't easily available to Iowans."
"Hmmm, maybe I'll try this again sometime, but I am just getting an overwhelming burn from this one (strange, I rarely feel a beer ""burns"" too much, this one does)...The nose had me slightly hopeful for this beer, but the spice was way too high and that booze...man..."
"Drinkability is where it falls a bit, alcohol too present in this bottle."
"D- After having a few saisons the past few days; this one really stands out for me. A solid representation of the style."
"Color me unimpressed. The INTERNETZZZ seem to love this beer...I do not...Now that that's straightened out, let's get to the nitty gritty. Pours awesome, a vibrant slightly-hazy gold, with a pillowed smooth creamy head leaving tons of lace. Aroma of some strawberries, maybe raspberries. Fruity and overall just ""fresh"" smelling. Loaded with carbonation. So far a winner but wait!!! Something wicked this way comes. Flavor is initally crisp but there hides a monster - something evil - is it Thyme or Rosemary or something. Whatever it is it's herbal and it's disgusting. Finish is long and hop bitter in a bad way. Ends as bad as the beginning was good. This is $10.99 per 750ml, so don't bother tracking it down unless you're a masochist."
"I still haven't been ""wow'd"" by the Bruery as much as some others have. The best things I've had from them have been draft one-offs. Their normal items have okay, but nothing amazing. This is a perfect example."
"I really enjoyed the flavor of this beer. The Bruery packs a ton of goodness into this strong Saison."
"A great beer that is another work of art from a great American brewer. California really is making some of the worlds best beers!"
"D: Nice refreshing Saison. Light in the feel but big on the flavor. Couldn't have too many with the carbonation and Brett though."
"D- Decent saison overall. I really like the dru characters but am not a huge fan of the raw dough that comes through occasionally. It has the hoppiness of an amber saison-but still isn't funky enough for the category for me. Average saison-above average belgian amber ale. Amazingly-the 8.5% is not at all detectable."
"wow. what an interesting beer. cant' believe i haven't reviewed it before. Dark golden with a white head that has great retention and leaves lots of splotchy lace. Nose is bretty, farmy funk with fruit (pear, red apple?, peach?, berry?) citrus (lots of sweet lemon and something that reminds me of the smell of pink grapefruits baked with a little brown sugar), and spice, with pepper leading the way and rye wrapped up and rounding out. Some earthy, wet-rock minerality going on as well. very nice. taste is a well balanced mix of all of the above, and it's really cool how the brett and the rye seem to play off of each other. a very complex beer for something so refreshing. Soft, medium body with a slight prickliness from carbonation, slight bitterness from the hops, a little bit of boozy warmth and a long lasting finish full of spice and rye. traditional and unique at the same time. this is what i think of when i think super-saison. well done. great beers. big fan."
"D - Good drinkability, ABV is completely hidden. A solid example of a Saison, there's a reason this is the Bruery's flagship brew."
"Overall, the tops."
"Man, I'm impressed at how refreshing this big complex beer is on a warm summer's evening!"
"D: very drinkable, slightly sweeter and could have used a slight amount of more hops"
"Autumnal spice flavors with some caramel malt and dark bread rye flavors...I am guessing a pretty high percentage of rye compared to many other rye beers. Has a definite hoppy bitterness and the cones also contribute some floral flavors. Brett is not overly powerful in this young sample, but could develop a bit more for my tastes. Yeast seems to take a backseat to all the other stuff going on in here, which I am not a big fan of in a saison. ABV seems like it could be toned down a bit as well. Sweetness comes out as it warms, almost candy-like. Fluffy and fine carbonation give this an excellent mouthfeel. Good brew, not great...I had sky high expectations for this one."
"Notes: Superbly balanced between being a great saison and tasty sour brew. Carbonation is really too high for me, but it keeps it lively. Love the fact that the brett doesn't totally run the show but is an integral part of its awesomeness. FFO Jolly Pumpkin beers, Dupont Avec Les Bons Veoux, Allagash Confluence."
"This is one sexy looking beer. Pours a light orange amber that would look at home inside a tweed guitar case. It has a delicate, fluffy, tightly packed foam head that rises eagerly as the beer is poured. It sticks around forever and leaves sloppy lace in its wake. The aroma is very fresh with lactic tartness, pear, sour apple, lemon, sweet malt, coriander, and white pepper. The flavor seems not quite as multi-dimensional as the aroma but is still quite nice. The musky brett flavor is there right up front as well as some bite from the rye and a firm bitterness. Flavors of grassy hops, lemon rind, green apple and pear are also present, as well as pale malt sweetness and a bit of alcoholic warmth. This beer is surprisingly smooth and on the lighter side of medium with a very dry finish that leaves me hankering for another sip. Not as drinkable as some saisons but that might be expected with the ABV. Recommended."
"Right now, the beer's maltiness keeps it a bit too sweet and weighted. I also want to see the more musty/dusty character of Brettanomiaces develop. But after a year or so, this beer should take on a beautiful Orval-like character that will ultimately decide the success of the beer."
"D-this is a well balanced brew with great flavors and a nice addition of brett. quite sweet but the pepper balances this out and the carbonation is strong enough to creat a great feel."
"Overall a very good saison. Funky, fruity and spicy. Again I like this saison but think Boulevard beats this by a hair."
"d - An ok saison. A nice smell but the taste was a litt lacking and it was too carbonated. Probably would not have again."
"Mouthfeel is medium in body with a creamy amount of carbonation."
"D: Really wish I had more of this. Not my favorite saison but I really would like more of this. On a hot summers day, this would be an awesome treat to break up the monotony of Whites, Wits, Hefes, and whatever else."
" This stuff will knock you down, so sip and share!! Easily one of the very best Belgo-American brews I've had."
"It has a beautiful orange hazy color with a perfectly off white head. This beer has a nice floral anD citrus smell; really makes you want to dive into the glass. Taste is similer to smell.... Citrus, floral and pepper on the back end. It's Quite refreshing. Nicely carbonated, with almost a champaign quality. Very very drinkable. The abv is on the high side which makes this beer dangerous. I could drink it all day. (Thank you chris for sharing.)"
"overall: a fantastic brew that is ultra complex that is very good with some age on it. I recommend you age this atleast 3 months and 6 or 9 months is really good! A beer that changes depending on when you pop the top, I Love it!"
"I think this beer is great. It had a lot of carbonation and a decent amount of alcohol, so I think aging this thing for a year or two is gonna be awesome. Next time I'm out, I'll probably pick up two, to do just that."
"D- A very interesting take on the style that means serious business. Full bodied, highly carbonated, funky, and impressive."
"The flavor blends spicy rye with funky Brettanomyces on the front of the tongue. A nice hit of lemon peel tartness puckers the sides of the mouth. Lots of changes, leading to a finish of more rye, Belgian malts, and a kiss of hops. A bit ascerbic on the end with a lingering Brett note. Body is creamy and smooth despite the complex flavor profile. Medium-consistency and well carbonated. Quite the tasty Saison, this beer definitely bends the rules of the style a bit, but ultimately succeeds."
"Pours a golden amber hue with a bright white head forms fine speckld lacing evenly around my tulip glass. Aroma has citrus spices and funy barnyard tones going on, I like me some brett infused saisons. Very aromatic comparable to the Drew Estate line of infused cigars. A nice melange of fruitiness going on with spicy bitter herbal hop edges, with spiced up tea/tobacco leaf complexity. Barnyard brett infused funk going on as well with a nice tropical fruit finish pineapple/mango. Mouthfeel is nice and dry at times/slightly bitter with spices and brett residuals on the palate but manages to finish slightly alcoholic and with a clean sweetness. Medium bodied sturdy effervescent carbonation carries the beer really nicely. Drinkability is a nice complex night cap that I need to get more of to get a better feel for it, I enjoyed it and will definitely not pass on the next Bruery selection I come across."
"My second saison from The Bruery in as many nights and also the second time I've been impressed. The appearances on both beers have been revelatory; it seems that Boulevard's Smokestack Series has competition in the pretty-looking beers category. As for Saison Rue: this is a successful beer that falls a yeast strain short of being very, very good."
"The palate opens a little too sweet for my liking, with some floral honey and spicy rye immediately apparent. The citrus hop character works well with the honey too. These big flavors result in an obfuscation of the yeast character, it being reduced to a generic Belgian yeast flavor rather than the delicate bouquet that better saisons have. Hop bitterness is moderate, again, a little bit lost behind the sweetness. A touch sweet on the finish, with a rather noticeable rye flavor. Medium in body with moderate carbonation, this beer is decent fresh. I need to grab another bottle and sit on it for a year or two. While I'm going to enjoy the rest of this bottle, I really do wish it were drier."
"D- very nice! I had no problem killing this 750."
"The beer is definitely sour but its not overpowering. This is seriously a great saison. Medium body and nice carbonation in the mouth. Some sour apple notes in there, a building late lactic character. Its a great saison for sure and a nice sour. Very excited about this beer."
"Pours a hazy golden orange color, with a bit of a rocky white head. Aromas of spicy rye, a little earth and black pepper. On the palate, this one is peppery, yeasty and a little sweet. A pretty good effort at a saison, but a little overpriced in my opinion."
"Drinkability - This is a very unique - and very American - take on the saison. Not nearly as refreshing as Saison de Lente, but is certainly enjoyable. Be forewarned: this beer will creep up on you."
"Having now tried both Saisons, Hottenroth, and Mischief I'd have to say that The Bruery is becoming one of my favorite breweries despite the fact that I've yet to sample some of their more highly rated and highly sought after beers (Black Tuesday, Papier, PiaPT, etc.). Really looking forward to cracking the 2 Turtle Doves I've got waiting in the cellar."
"Overall fairly easy drinker. Seemed to be missing something from the usual yeast profile in the style. Overall quality beer."
"Overall, I love the Rue. It's the Bruery's original flagship beer and for good reason: its innovative take on a Saison adds new flavors while tilting its hat to the things we love about the style. Pretty much perfect."
"Very nice saison with some hoppiness to keep it balanced, although perhaps a bit boozy and more full than one might expect."
"D: A nice twist on a Saison and very well done with a good balanced mix of sweet, tart, and funky. This beer is worth another try or worth aging. It has a lot going on but is refreshing as hell. Serve cold!"
"A fine beer. The flavours are far more pronounced and rounded than the lente, and I think I really prefer this one."
"Much fuller and not nearly as dry as Lente, not as refreshing and quenching though still a damn fine saison. Like the addition of the rye and the spiciness of this one, just couldn't drink it all the time."
"Great beer, overall I liked it. I was only able to finish one glass instead of my normal 2 from this size bottle. (buddy nocked over my beer) cheers!"
"Awesome beer. My first Bruery and I am extremely pleased by it."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is huge. I absolutely love what the rye has done for this beer. Overall, I enjoyed this immensely. I will pick this up when ever I'm in the mood for a saison. Skal."
"D- Ive said this before and Ill say it again; saisons are really beginning to be one of my favorite styles. This summer is going to be my summer of sasion. This beer will totally be making a reappearance by summers end."
"Another beer from the Bruery that blows me away. This beer delivers everywhere. It looks great, smells deep, tastes complex and pleasant, and feels right. Perfect for a night when you want to sit back, open up a bottle, and enjoy worlds of intriguing, delicious flavors for a few hours."
"The Bruery, Saison Rue, Saison. This beer was a gift from a friend and being a fan of most Bruery beers and made with Rye and Brettanomyces I was excited to try it. It poured a deep cloudy copper. It smelled like spicy rye bread, orange peel, black pepper, honey and some Brett. I tasted only a hint of rye and Brett and a bit malty, which was surprising for a Saison. It just didn't live up to its aroma."
"The best thing about this beer is the way it looks. The color is amber/red, a little turbid...ok...but the head is fantastic...a calm pour leads to 3+ finger of head that settle to a very creamy, fine bubble foam with tons of lacing on the glass. The scent is strong, huge saison notes of belgian yeast, lemon, bread, banana, and a bit o' that band-aid smell. The taste is very similar, wheaty, spicy, somewhat subdued, but there is a soapy taste at the end, accompanied by a green apple flavor. Strong effervescence in the mouthfeel from the lasting carbonation...thickness is suiting. Drinkability is a bit low for me, due to the alcohol flavor, carbonation, mainly."
"Overall, I was surprised at how much I liked this one. If it's easy to find in your market (it's not in mine) I'd say try it."
"M/D: Medium body, a bit creamy, high carbonation carbonation holds up well. Drinkability is good. A very interesting beer that I could see drinking while tending the grill or at your favorite beer bar. Good stuff."
"Overall Impression: This is the second Brett Saison I reviewed from The Bruery this week. This one is even more complex with intense flavors, particularly the Brett and spices. Although it is well balanced, it does learn toward sweetness a bit. It is not as sessionable (is that even a word) as Saison De Lente due mainly to the higher abv. I have a really nice Belgian Buzz going on after quaffing down this bottle. Yet another excellent American rendition of a Belgian classic from The Bruery!"
"D - A very tasty beer. Maybe a liiitle too sweet, but not too much of a detractor. Very easy to drink, but watch out for the alcohol!"
"This is an excellent beer. Certainly it is a sipper, I had the bottle over an evening but would definitely have it again."
"The beer pours a murky, dark yellow color with a white head. The aroma is peppery with some orange and citrus notes. I also get some pineapple. The flavor is about the same with pepper and citrus, along with some nice sweetness and some raspberry thrown in. High carbonation and light mouthfeel."
"Pours out a hazy golden yellow with a huge bubbly, champagne like head. The retention is beastly and leaves a nice coat of lacing. A nice cloud remains on top after the head finally dies down. Smell is nice. Yeast/Brett scents are up front with some sour in the background. The rye/malts are noticeable and there is even a woody/earthy element to it. The strength seems to die down after a bit and takes away half a point. Taste is solid for what the beer wants to be. The Brett and rye make for a very interesting beer. Some sourness in there and the malts too, a nice balance overall. The mouthfeel consists of a moderate body and moderate carbonation. This suits the flavor well and there is some creaminess to it, smooth. Drinkability is good for a Brett beer. Smooth with a pretty good price for 750ml. Nice taste and it doesn't overpower the palate."
"Color is a hazed, cloudy pale gold with a retentive off white head and nice streaky lacing. Aroma is sweeter than expected, yeasty and fruity, with mild dry earthiness and funk, very little presence of brett or the rye malt. Also a slightly solvent, boozy pinch. Flavor is similarly sweet like the nose, not particularly dry or crisp, with medium full soft body with light carbonation. Nice hop balance in the finish, but I'm disappointed in the lack of earthiness spiciness and funk in this and slightly turned off by the sweetness. Not a traditional saison, but an interesting beer. I wouldn't return to this at its typical price north of $10 but might grab a few more at this price to see what happens with the brett over time."
"Mouthfeel is goo and the flavors are well balanced making it very drinkable."
"Overall, a very decent Saison. At $13 this is a steal in my book, and something I wish I had regular access to. The Bruery makes some fine beers."
"Pours a nearly opaque cloudy tawny brown with billowing white head that slowly fades to a thin clump leaving thick styrofoamish lace. Smell: spicy, lemony, musty, slightly sour, pear, bread dough yeasty. Taste: spicy and citric, rye, peppery, white grape with a little green apple bite. Lively carbonation with a lingering spicy finish. Very tasty."
"I'm drinking this while eating cheese and crackers, but I bet his would go wonderfully with many other, better foods. Most excellent, well worth the $13 I paid, if only to finally know, with my first taste, that The Bruery is the real deal."
"D: My last pour emptied out just a little bit of both light and dark particles. I'm not sure if it is the yeast now in my glass or the temperature slowly on the rise, but I'm enjoying this beer more and more as I sip. Great brew."
"Overall: This is a great beer from a brewer that never fails to impress. I intend to drink this often."
"Notes: The second of three Bruery beers that I am tasting and rating this week. This one really impressed me with its ability to deliver on the style but offer so much more. More than anything, it is delicious!"
"Drinkability: It's both interest and different, though, when all is said and done, I'd rather stick to just a simple, classic Saison Dupont. That's just me though!"
"Overall a very balanced and rather complex brew. The hops give a nice citrusy flavor and bitterness which is mathced perfectly by the wheat or rye banana/spice notes and the brett sourness."
"D - I like this one...will buy again, for sure."
"D - Hell yeah. Exceptionally good."
"D= An interesting take on a saison. Very unusual yet tasty. Drinkability was high despite the ABV."
"Drinkability: Maybe its my buzz that i have right now but this is going down like nothing."
"Flavor...o wow. Very tasty. Crisp and carbonated at first but drinks better as it warms. For those who don't like Brett, this one actually isn't overwhelming with sourness. It's very slight and pushing more torwards the sweeter saison flavors. Kind of complex, but overall an easy drink. Great Saison!"
"Out of a bomber this beer was a cloudy, golden/wheat-color the head was two fingers of puffy, beige bubbles. The retention was great and the lacing fabulously clingy. The aroma was good with sour and tart notes of hops like green apples, grapefruit, yeast and assorted spices. The flavors were very sharp and complex as one would expect of an aged cheddar (they would probably pair wonderfully). I tasted orange zest and grapefruit peel, alcohol, toasted malt, some resiny/piney hops, a healthy dose of pepper and hints of rye. Not really what I expect from a saison but tasty. The mouthfeel was creamy and a bit oily such that my tongue remained coated after the sampling. The body was medium and the carbonation low."
"The Bruery makes pretty solid beer and that's exactly what Saison Rue is. I'm yet to be blown away by any of their beer, but I haven't had an overtly bad one yet. Saison Rue is a good effort that performs well-all around. It needs something extra to really get it to the next level. Perhaps a stronger rye presence or more funkiness from the Brett. Either might work. But, it's good beer as it is. Definitely worth picking up a bottle."
"D- This was a very drinkable saison, especially consider its relatively high abv (for the style). I would have liked the brett to play a larger roll in the flavor and mouthfeel, but it is far from disappointing."
"This is a difficult one to judge drinkability on, simply because the style is not one I frequent often. I only have sporadic interest in saisons, but usually enjoy them a lot when the urge strikes. This is one of those cases, as this is certainly a strong example. However, this is not a beer I would drink all that often, for the aforementioned reasons. If looking for a saison in the future, this one will now be in consideration every time."
"In conclusion, this is a very nice beer. I cannot wait to lay down a case and taste them as the Brett ages from fruity pineapple to barnyardy funk. I fault the brew on excessive alcohol, but, beyond that, it is really very fine beer!"
"Overall this beer is stellar. No notice of the 8% ABV and the funky notes make this a great farmhouse ale."
"D: despite being so bitter at first, quite drinkable. It is dry, but not so dry as to inhibit drinkability significantly Even with the drop in mouthfeel, its still pretty smooth, though that does make it less enjoyable to drink."
"Drinkability: And the Department of Eagle's ""Waves of Rye"" comes on as I begin to wrap up this review. I waffled a lot on my scoring of this beer, moreso than I usually do when reviewing, with a lot of borderline 4.0/4.5 scores, but I think I feel good with what I ended up with. This is a very, very good beer, and one I was impressed by. This bottle had about 6 months of age on it since I picked it up relatively fresh, so I can't really comment on how this one's gotten Brett-ier or dryer ... but I can say I really enjoyed it. In fact, it's one of the better saison's I've had the pleasure of trying (and I have reviews of 23, this one coming in below Hennepin, Saison w/ Brett, and Southampton's Saison Deluxe), showcasing lots of variety, complex, well-integrated flavors, and not even a hint of alcohol. At 8.5%, it's average or even a little high for the style, but I'm pleased that it hardly made itself known at all. All in all, a true pleasure, and probably the best readily-available Saison we have here in Charlottesville, VA. At least, to my palette."
"M&D: Mouthfeel is well carbonated and light-medium bodied. Drinkability is pretty good, but the citrus get to be a bit much for me personally. Overall, a very good beer, my first from The Bruery"
"Poured straight down the middle into a Stella Artois glass. Generous head. Increasingly cloudy down the bottle getting towards the yeast at the bottom."
"D - Very good saison. Alcohol is a bit too noticeable to down this one easily. So many great flavors in here...seems like a perfect ""food"" beer. Leans towards being a sipper...due to being so intense. Great stuff, but one bottle is plenty - perfect amount for a multiple course meal."
"Bottle at The Bruery. Pours dark gold and cloudy with a large white head that displayed very good retention and nice lacing. Smells of pineapple, coconut milk, cider, and rye spiciness. Tastes lightly tart, slight lactose funk almost, lots of spices, clove, earthy almost flowery hops, and a dry finish. Medium in body with a lightly creamy higher level of bubbles. Overall I find the beer pretty tasty, different than most saisons, but I like it more than most saisons."
"D - pretty good despite the easily noticed ABV and rather one-sided sweetness"
"D: I think I'm receiving this beer better than most, a lot of depth in its flavors especially enjoyable after the way of spice, around 3/4th of the way through until the beautifully tart finish."
"Picked this brew up for New Years after hearing some great things about this brewery. This brew poured to a slightly cloudy golden color with an amber tinge to it. Nice sized white head that left some good lacing. The aroma was nice, though I will admit that I was expecting more of a sour smell. Rye malt is there, some pepper like smell, earthy and somewhat funky. Not a bad smelling brew, but maybe I was just expecting a little more. The flavors where nice, this was an easy drinking brew. Nice malt flavor, the rye does not seem to be overly dominant which works for me. Nice spice to it with a slight pepper taste. Some sour properties, I guess I was looking for more, that where nice. Now for me this brew was not overly sour but I was sharing this brew and others felt that the sour really stood out. I will say that I really like this brew but based on the $13 per bottle it did not stand out enough to get again."
"Bottom line: it's nice but not $12 nice."
"Edge of what a saison should be, at least in my book."
"Nice...lots of peppery citrus in this one."
"Definitely recommended."
"Atmosphere is solid. Decent appearance, nose is pleasing. Flavor is funky, flavorful, but not overwhelming. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."
"Popping the cap, I got an audible indication of carbonation but thankfully none of the gushing that I heard plagued earlier batches. The beer is dark copper color, a little murky and hazy, with a thick white head. The smell is very good, the first thing I note is spicy rye, after that a Belgian Pale character that's yeasty and inviting. The brett funk is there but not in a defining way, just enough to give a support to the beer. This beer, while tasty, doesn't really live up to its own aroma. There's just enough rye (an ingredient better suited to IPAs when added with a strong hand) for a Belgian-style beer, it was expertly added. The brett sourness is there but not too strong either, but the after-taste seems too bitter and astringent, like chewable aspirin or something similar. The body quality is good, peppery carbonation and satisfying mouthfeel. I think that I'll remember this beer as a good experiment but not necessarily something I'd recommend or come back to."
"D - The aroma and taste remind me of a holiday bread of some sort, sweet, slightly rich with candied fruits and a touch of spice. Maltier than other saisons and quite enjoyable. I will have to get another bottle and let it sit for a while to see if more brett characteristics will come out."
"M/D: tangy and full of carbonation up front, giving way to a dryness in the finish. Heavier than the pour and color lead on, but not because of the alcohol - it is nearly invisible. However, this is one full-bodied beer. There is a lot going on in this beer, and the flavors were very nicely managed, as nothing was too dominant."
"D: Decent, but lacking in complexity and a bit harsh in the hops department. I'll take some more Boulevard Saison-Brett please."
"D: the aroma alludes to so much more. An easy drinker, a light brew at about 8.5% abv that drinks like a beer a lot lower, although you realize it when you stand up. somehow, the cinnamon flavor seems to dominate the subtle combination of funkiness with the light spicy/grainy character you expect in a saison. still all in all a nice drinker."
"This is a great, and original, take on a classic style. Nicely done."
"A great beer that shows no signs of the high ABV content in the delicious taste and just has a wonderful feel and body to the beer to matches the complex flavors. A very enjoyable beer with a nice combo of spices and malt/bread/yeast flavors."
"This is a very drinkable saison, though at 8.5 percent, you can't drink it all night long. Overall, the most interesting saison I have ever tried. It is complex. Brewed with the odd elements of rye and brettanomyces, this beer is so well balanced, it takes the saison style into a richer, more complex direction. I am amazed at the rye bread/milk chocolate sensation I am getting from this. It definitely shows the difference between a white bread (ordinary saisons, if you will) and a rye bread presentation. Well done."
"The beer is poured with a golden colour and a huge white fluffy head. The bubbles are of a decent size and the carbonation is very apparent. There is a bit of sweetness and fruitiness in the nose. A spiciness is there as well. There is citrus and pear notes coming through. The nose isn't very strong, but very solid. The beer has a lot of flavours. A slight pilsner type flavour mixed with a sweetness with hints of pear and a slight bit of citrus. The sweetness in the beer isn't what I'd expect because the beer is so dry. The carbonation is quite strong as well adding a little of acidity to the beer. I really enjoy this flavour and it's incredibly drinkable. A slight tartness lingers on your tongue, which I like. This is an incredibly tasty brew."
"Edit: After looking at some of the other reviews, it seems like there are some major quality control issues. I bought this in Maryland and had no such problems."
"My first impression of the taste is take three steps back from all the pepper. This is a very spicy beer, and black pepper dominates the spice profile. Fruit yeast flavors, typical of a saison follow. The Brett doesn't stand out much but this is a young bottle. I would bet this would improve over a year or two. Still, this is a perfectly enjoyable beer as it is. The body is highly viscous and the combination of assertive piney hops and tingling, almost champagne like carbonation makes for a lively and pleasurable mouthfeel. Grape fruit flavors are pronounced but bready malts come through too. Though not blown away, I would count this as a solid beer to return for more tastings in the future."
"Drinkability: Another well put together beer from The Bruery, although I find it rather forgettable. I don't think this will end up in my crate again."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and well carbonated."
"My first Bruery beer- thanks for making the state of Georgia one of your distribution points! A very good Saison, a bit on the softer side and quite creamy. A bit unusual, but there is a a fair bit going on here. Pours golden with just a bit of haze and a quite nice, tightly beaded white head that sticks around as a cap. Smells fruity and somewhat tropical, but with notes of white pepper and almonds as well as a whiff of grain and herbs. Tastes soft and a bit creamy up front, with a nice tropical fruitiness, particularly pineapple and passion fruit, and then there is quite a nice little hit of pepper, or more probably grains of paradise, followed by some more tropical fruit and a lightly lemony finish. This is fairly complex, and quite tasty, but not quite as deep and pungent as say, a Fantome. Still, very enjoyable. A little lighter and softer than I'd like in the mouth, it could use a touch more crispness. Very interesting beer and although it doesn't hit every mark, it certainly is a nice achievement."
"D - The yeast character is nice, but not as bright and tropical as that of some other saisons that I have had. The hop character seems to be where this beer really shines at this level of maturity. There is a nice level of refreshing bitterness and plenty of the classic, earthy, spicy hop notes. The funk is quite a bit more subdued than I would have expected; there are only hints of any wild character, and I would guess that this was a relatively young bottle. I would be quite interested to see how this beer changed over time and if I come across another bottle I will cellar it for six months or so to see how the brett develops."
"Fluffy, quickly dissipating bubbles indicate the tingly character of the carbonation. Aroma of spice (coriander, clove), funky, earthy yeast, and citrus is heady and nice. Taste is of cidery apple, grape skins, biscuity, sour yeast, some honey and caramel sweetness, citric, herbal hop bite, and warm alcohol. Quite spicy, evidently from the rye. White pepper. Mouthfeel is a bit raw and grainy. A bit prickly on the tongue from carbonation and spice. The biscuity malt keeps it in balance for the most part, but this is rustic and musty in the tradition of saisons, albeit with more hop character and spice. An uber saison, with a higher alcohol and more earthy, funky quality than the more refined versions. Not for everyone, but quite enjoyable. Would pair well with some stinky cheese and fruit."
"Over all this is an excellent saison. I rank it among some of my favorites."
"Very well done. This one actually reminds me of a couple of the Fantome saisons, which is, of course, a stellar comparison."
"Poured a hazy orange with a very generous head that took its time before fading to a thick skin. The aroma was mildewy. The taste was sweet and fruity (pears?) with a bit of sour lurking around. The feel was medium bodied with adequate carbonation. Drinkability was reasonably good. I have heard the rave reviews about the Bruery beers, but they are 0 for 2 at wowing me with the beer available locally. Of course the big hitters haven't made it here yet."
"D-Nicely done. Lots of flavours combine into a fruity spice bowl. I really like the rye dryness too. Without question my favorite regularly bottled Bruery product."
"75cl bottle picked up down in OC after the anniversary party. Hazed dark orange, almost copper color with a big, lasting off-white head. The aroma hits you with some brett in a funky earthy way right off. Hay, earth, lemon, blood oranges, candied ginger and some sweet malt in the aroma as well. Really nice nose. The flavor is fruity, and pretty spicy with a light tartness. There is a higher level of malt than many saisons as well, but the finish is still pretty dry. Not really hoppy, though there is some bitterness in the finish as well as some graininess. Medium bodied with lots of carbonation. Just a little sweeter than I was hoping, but a nice maltier saison"
"i know the style calls for excessive carbonation, but this beer might be better with less. it is more robust than other saisons ive had, and the malty sweetness begs for a fuller (less ""airy"") body."
"D: A decent saison with an interesting character. The minty aromas are a bit strange and the brett is really faint, but it will be nice to see what a year or to in the cellar will do to this one."
"The beer was enjoyed by a number or people who I shared it with. I would recommend this beer any time."
"Poured a cloudy yellowish orange with lots of carbonation and a big white head. Nose is faint with grain, yeast and thats about it. taste is spicy with hints of pepper, belgian yeast, hops. Mouthfeel is spicy, warming with the ABV and spiciness increasing at the end. very wild tasting yeast"
"J"
"Taste-Fruity, pears, creamy with a subtle peppery hop bite in a warming finish. Smooth and drinkable, a fine example of the style"
"M&D - effervescent and lively with a medium body, a well layered complex flavor without being subtle, distinct flavors make this beer very very good. why are all these amazing breweries from California unable to distribute to CT!"
"Orange body took 15min to pour (huge head). Aroma is funky brett, vinegar, and peaches. Flavor is apricot and peach with lots of brett. Notes of lemon, earth, and spice. Rustic, as the label suggests. Crisp carbonation, funky but not that sour. Darn tasty."
"Overall this brew was worth the purchase and I will defiitely now check out other releases from the Bruery in Socal."
"Thick and big and, most of all, very good. Definitely a must-try saison, that is a bit off the beaten track."
"Not too big on the sours/wilds, but from time to time one comes along that makes me glad I don't totally give up on em'. Pours a brilliant gold and topped with an off-the chart huge fluffy, dirty white head that stays forever, eventually leaving sticky, random chunks of lace all around the tulip. Smells of pineapples and ripe oranges with some pungent white grapes in the very back. Spice, yeast, brett, and some faint mustiness float around. Tastes of big, sour fruits and grain. After a bit the alcohol heat opens up in the back right before a puckering hit of brett reveals itself. This one's highly carbonated and medium bodied and dry and slightly rough around the edges going down."
"D: The yeast flavor seems to build up on the palate as you drink this. I swear by the end of the bottle I thought I was getting thrush. That effect alone makes this a one and done for me."
"Overall,a decent saison. More brett would be nice. I keep going back and forth between thinking its interesting and noticing off notes and not liking it."
"750ml bottle. Pours hazy gold with a light orange tint. Billowing white head that holds its shape, eventually dissipating to a small white cap and great lacing. Smells heavily spicy, with a lot of ginger and pepper. Plenty of orange and other fruit. Very much like perfume. Incredibly sweet. Brett is pretty evident, with some musty notes. More brett in the taste, again with musty horseblanket. Overly spicy, with an onslaught of pepper/ginger. Quite fruity; a lot of citrus and some tropical fruit. Pretty sweet. Heavily hopped. Alcohol warmth and bite. It finishes sweetly but with a lot of hop bitterness; rather disjointed. Full bodied with lower carbonation. Between the spices (definitely added, not just a yeast byproduct), the strong sweetness, the bitterness, and the alcohol, it's pretty clear that there's too much shit going on here."
"Poured a clear orange gold body with a mountainous, slow-dieing well-carbonated head. An excellent smell of orange, pear, sour fruit hops, spices, some bready or wood malt along w/ a little yeast funk. Smooth yet also sharp with minor citric fruit notes, along with other fruit notes such as orange, pear, apple and a very small sweet taste that is very complimentary. A little spicy as well and finishes light, dry and crisp. This was a great beer to sip on and I thoroughly enjoyed it."
"Saison Rue should be sipped outside on a brick patio, weeds pushing up between stones, on a lazy late summer/early autumn afternoon. Preferably in the company of people with whom you are comfortable doing nothing, because with its complexity and 8.5 percent ABV, the 750 ML bottle goes a long way."
"Served in a cervoise glass."
"Mouthfeel is lighter with big fast moving carbonation. Quite refreshing and a nice twist on a saison with a darker malt profile than most. Tasty brew overall and if it wasn't a gusher I would've been even happier."
"Very nice, on the darker side of pale golden. Soft white and fluffy head that really clings to the sides of the glass as it goes on down. Very deep and earthy aroma. Great brett smell to it. Mildly woody and ever so slightly spiced. Great malty flavor with a mildly spicy note. Faint black pepper taste. Great ""horsey"" brett characteristics. Mildly metallic, almost rusty tasting. Green apples going on. Great full body to it-you would think it might need to be a touch thinner to be this quenching. A really great beer all around. Very satisfying and enjoyable. Really a winner."
"i'm not a fan of the big phenols, but at least here, it's harmonized well enough that i can actually appreciate them."
"Drinkability? I'm nodding my head...yep. This is very drinkable given the abv and this is really on the higher end for the style that I've had a chance to try so it's a very good thing that they pushed the ""mute"" button on Saison Rue. Just sip slow and easy and I think one would have no problem finishing this ""huge"" bottle. Every sip has been an enjoyable drinking experience. Great brew."
"Overall: Much sweeter than it smells. Pretty delicious. Another unique one for the unique world of belgian-style ales."
"Poured a cloudy yellowish orange with lots of carbonation and a big white head. Nose is faint with grain, yeast and thats about it. taste is spicy with hints of pepper, belgian yeast, hops. Mouthfeel is spicy, warming with the ABV and spiciness increasing at the end. Drinkability..this is a good beer but not sessionable by any means."
"M- Good feel, although the head is maintained throughout the life of the drink it is not overly gassy. Very well done!"
"capped 750 scooped at Whole Foods P St., DC, and enjoyed on a stoop just a couple blocks over"
"Highly recommended."
"D: An intriguing, drinkable brew."
"Medium body has a crisp, delicate carbonation. Bitter hoppy finish. Another great Saison from The Bruery. Every beer I've had from these guys has been top knotch."
"D - Dangerously so. I'm a huge fan of the style so this is one hell of an offering. Find this!"
"This very dynamic brew has single handedly made me want to experience some more of both the Bruery and the saison style."
"a bit sweeter than I'd like form a saison I'd also like it to be be funkier more vinious...but still a good saison."
"D: A decent Saison, but not as good as I was hoping for."
"A rather enjoyable saison. Very dry and spicy. Recommended."
"Good saison with a mild brett flavor and a bit too much sweetness. It's an amber beer, a bit darker than most saisons, with an enormous head that looks like stiffly whipped cream. The beer smells of honey, floral hops and spice. The flavor is a tad on the sweet side for me. It's quite good, though. The spicy rye gives the malt an interesting flavor. It's a good saison from a good brewery."
"Decently carbonated. Not particularly drinkable."
"Pleasantly surprised about how this brewery made it to New Jersey so quickly. Enjoying their brews!"
"My only gripe with this beer is that I would have preferred a more tart style saison, but for teh style this was excellent."
"Poured a capped 750 into my over sized Tripel Karmeliet tulip. Holy crap is this a foamer. This beer gushed out of the bottle, right onto my floor. Jeez, I'm glad I didn't let this baby sit for much longer. The brett makes this a bottle bomb in the making. This beer pours a burnt orange with a massive 6 inch tan head that actually grows over the lip of the glass. This beer leaves some serious lacing as it recedes. The aroma is a mixture of funk, spice, and lemon rind. White pepper, damp hay, brown sugar, with just a bit of barnyard funk. The flavor is awesome. The base saison is just a wee bit sweet for me but the funk really comes through. Wet grass, must, with just a bit of Belgian yeast spiciness. The rye really comes out in the flavor profile. Big pepper notes accentuated by the yeast are amazing. My biggest problem is there is quite a bit of lingering sweetness on the tail of the flavor profile. I rather like my saison's just a bit dryer. This is a great beer. I'm rather glad I got to try this one again."
"D: Good drinkability and good regards per style. Smooth, tart and funky. Labeled as a changing of seasons saison I picture this more suited for the cooler fall type drink rather a summer quencher."
"O- This is an amazing beer. I had no idea what to expect just saw the bottle and went with it. Its an amazing sasion beer. I think the best I've had from an American brewery. Let alone ever tried. Amazing beer. This is the new go to for subtil funkeyness."
"750 mil bottle into a tulip grimbergen glass. This was one of the best saison's i've tried. I actually preferred it to the Southhampton Saison Deluxe. I found it to have the requisite funkiness that a Saison should have.I paired it with a Humboldt Fog half cow/half sheep soft chesse. The two worked very well together."
"Bottle from one of the Sacramento Bevmos, served at 55C. Pours a golden and cloudy body with an inch and a half white rocky head. Sticky lacing. Light breaks through the body and shines out in a magical and inviting manner. Very pleasing look. Smells like leather and pepper ground up and mixed in with some light malt syrup, along with some spicy German hops and a touch of alcohol. Flavor is an earthy, spicy malt with some green grass and lemon hop notes and a growing dry alcohol on the finish. Vague herbiness. Very smooth and easy to drink. A very, very good saison from a U.S. brewery (excuse me, bruery)."
"M/D - Crisp, medium bodied beer with very high carbonation. Very refreshing and easy drinking."
"drinkability: high"
"Bottle gushed a bit on me, what a shame. Pours a cloudy golden, almost pear-color golden, lots of carbonation. This one seems to be really heavily carbonated, almost too much so. But it makes for some nice lacing and a great looking beer, so all is well. Smell is the most disappointing aspect here. Not bad per se, just underwhelming. A bit of funk, but not a ton. More typical belgian sweet malt style than anything else. Taste is great, though. Not super funky, not right out of the barnyard, but just a dry, slightly moldy (like an aged cheese), slightly sharp flavour. All the positive aspects of a farmhouse ale, without the terrible bite you sometimes get. The carbonation works in its favor here, with some nice snap behind it. No boozey flavor at all, no soapiness or grossness like you sometimes get. Just great. Patrick Rue hasn't disappointed me yet, and he still has not."
"Definitely a very tasty, interesting and refreshing beer. I'm going to buy it again. A must if you like farmhouse ales or strong belgian pale ales."
"This is a fantastic beer, definitely a saison but with attitude. I love the funkiness and the overall flavor despite being so dry. Highly recommend and looking forward to trying more of their beers."
"D: I was expecting 'meh...' and got 'wow!' instead. A complex, heady saison that I really like."
"After pouring the first (1/2-8oz) glass, I later looked over to where the bottle was sitting on the floor and noticed that it had continued to froth up and out of the bottle. My cat expressed a mild interest in licking at it, good for her."
"Fizzy quaff of Belgian yeast with the fruit and light funk. Pretty tasty combination of flavors that standout with sharp edge with the tingly carbonation. No hint of any 8.5% booze in the bottle."
"Easily quaffable. There is only a slight bit of warming, otherwise the 8+% is not noticeable. I enjoyed this with a friend while hanging out outside on Memorial Day."
"Before I realized how strong this is, I was also wondering why I wasn't drinking this faster. Drinkable at this strength, but a little more than I bargained for - one big bastard of a saison for sure. Pairing? I can say this works beautifully with a veiny, nutty, sharp, really funky blue - it has the chops to deal with such a complicated cheese, a cheese that makes even barleywines cower."
"D: A rye beer with brett? Where have you been all of my life. I love both styles and this beer was very different. We split the bottle with friends and that was fine. I think this one might be a bit too intense for just one person."
"Drinkability is pretty good, but I definitely prefered the look and smell to the actual taste. I suspect the 6 months of cellaring gave the brett a chance to chew through the malt, hurting some of the complexity and increasing the bite of the alcohol, without really contributing a strong barnyard character (as it was only a secondary addition). I'm going to sit on the other one for a while to see if it reverses course or trends downward, but I was a little disappointed after the smell. I think a lower OG would definitely help this beer, as the strong alcohol bite really dominated the taste for me."
"D - This is an outstanding brew. I've been trying a lot of different saisons recently, and this one really stands out as one of my favorites so far. You can drink this beer on its own, or try it with an English farmhouse cheddar, a young goat's milk cheese, or a thick, fatty medium-rare steak. This is now one of my favorite saisons - great job, Patrick and co.!"
"The beer pours a hazy gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a peppery, pale and rye malt scent along with a dry farmhouse funk aroma. It has a nice earthy scent. The taste is good. It has a bone dry flavor that goes down slow and warms in the finish. The rye and Brett feed off of one another. It's got quite a spicey/peppery taste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This a pretty good beer. There's a lot going on with the aroma and taste. The rye is a nice touch and the Brett comes in at the end to add some excellent ""funk"" character."
"It's a really nice beer and quite drinkable. I got a couple hours to go; this bottle will help calm me down as we get closer."
"Drinkability: nicely drinkable beer here. The brett sourness is enjoyable and not overwhelming. Nice beer everyone should have."
"D- Very well-rounded and smooth."
"Drinkability: Very enjoyable and an easy drink. Malt balances out the yeast very well. Had a few of these on draft when I picked up the bottle yesterday."
"With a write-up like that, you know this isn't a run of the mill brew, or even a run of the mill saison. Really nicely done - it could be improved in some senses, but I like it quite a bit for what it is."
"This is a pretty good saison. But it's got so much sour apple up front that some other flavors get kind of lost. It's a little one-note, altho it's a pretty decent note."
"Drinkability suffers a little from the richness, but overall I found this to be a unique and worthwhile saison that I won't hesitate to pick up again."
"Poured into a chalice a very nice cloudy golden orange/yellow color, very nice carbonation, with a huge three-finger creamy/foamy white head, tons of nice thick creamy sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, yeasty, with a touch of flowery, corinander. The taste is malty, slightly sweet, with a very nice touch of yeast, there's some funky shit going on as well, and corinander. Full/Medium body, the ABV is hidden very well. Very drinkable, another very nice brew from these guy's. Thanks Carlos for this awesome extra."
"Notes: I absolutely love the rye spiciness that this one brings to the table. A nice little twist that I find rather enjoyable. I can't decide if the Saison De Lente is better, but this one's more funky for sure. Too close to call, both are excellent beers! Highly recommended"
"D: I loved this beer. I've had the great fortune to try both this, Saison de Lente, and Goose Islands' Sofie within a few days of each other...life is good."
"The body is a little heavy for my liking, more on the medium bodied side. Carbonation is soft and very present. The overall drinkability of this beer is OK, but not as high as would be liked for this style. Strong on the sweet side."
"This is complex, well-constructed and thoroughly enjoyable. Only things we can improve on are the crispness, a bit more Brett sourness and the electricity of a more traditional saison. Still a finely-tuned, well-oiled machine and yet another successful offering from Patrick. Not bad for a lawyer!"
"Been wanting to try out this brew(ue)ry for a while, recently began distributing to Boston. Easy does it opening this beer, nearly a gusher. Big, huge, fluffy brilliant white head floats on a light golden-orange beer. Light haze. Lots going on in the nose. Delicious peppery rye spicyness, fresh and a bit tangy, grassy. Hmm, taste is well rounded and really pretty good but a letdown compared to my expectations from the nose, which was a near 5er. Bubbly tingly carbonation hits first and next is a light pale malt, a bit of funky yeast but not necessarily sour, and a light floral hop profile. The rye comes through slightly, and a bit more peppery typical saison spice. I guess what I'm not crazy about is that this beer is a little bit sweet, maybe partially because of the relatively high ABV for a saison. I was expecting a little more crispness, something a bit more dry, and maybe more of a brett presence. Not as sharp as I would like, but maybe I'm hard to please. Good tingly texture. A really decent beer overall, just not to my particular taste for the style. Anxious to try their other beers..."
"This one started foaming over as soon as I opened the bottle and I did loose a bit. Pours a pale orange with three fingers of huge pillowy white head that never fully dissipated but did leave some nice lacing as it receded a bit. Taste and aroma are complex. Lots of esters, some floral hops, some phenols, spices, and a touch of perfumey, rose-like alcohol. The yeast derived ester aromas here are citrusy with some pear. The phenols are a bit peppery and in more of a complimentary role, helping the balance the aroma. The alcohol presence is very subdued and appears as occasional whiffs of rose. There do seem to be some lightly floral hop notes to the aroma as well. There is also a faint sour note that lingers throughout. Mouthfeel is goo with a light-medium body (at the lighter end of that spectrum) with high carbonation. Drinkability is quite good. I finished the entire bottle without realizing it. Flavors are complex without being overwhelming, very enjoyable."
"I should note that I'm admittedly biased where the Bruery is concerned - I've never had anything even resembling a bad beer from them, and many have been out right homeruns. This is the latter. Utterly fantastic - in my opinion, the best Saison brewed on American soil that I've tried."
"Overall, this is a great addition to the style range and immensely drinkable and very tasty. Highly recommended. Just a bit of alcohol warmth, but doesn't rear its head in the taste."
"So far, the Bruery is 2 for 2 with me. Had the Saison De Lente a month ago, and enjoyed that one equally as much - little more complexity and overall satisfaction with this brew, however."
"Coppery / honey color fils the glass. Nice tight bubbles making the head. The taste is just the right amount of sour, with pepper and spicyness following.Really a very enjoyable bottle to spend a sunday evening with."
"I found this at Bellport Beer where it was listed as a new selection. Thinking of how much I liked the great saisons of Europe, the initial press on this one piqued my interest. The first look at this deep copper/orange ale sparked my interest as the aroma was also inviting. The first taste reminded me of a winding and twisting road that just kept flowing as I drove my old TR7 on it. Heavy with coriander and pepper nuances, every taste came back with something interesting to think of."
"Interesting and exciting brew, and not just because the foam came shooting out of the bottle onto the floor and rug."
"My god, if I could drink a beer like this every night, I would be in freaking heaven. I'd say it's utterly drinkable, at least for a brett and funk lover like myself. I actually ended up drinking most of the bottle myself while watching ""Iron Man."" The movie was surprisingly enjoyable; the beer, not surprisingly, was much more impressive overall."
"D: Pretty solid. Glad to have this available here now."
"Large bottle purchased at WFM Bowery in NYC, for just under $10. No freshness/vintage info. Pours cloudy darker peach under a wildly large and growing off white head. Slowly calms down to a frothy coating and leaves gobs of sticky stickage. Spiced up nose full of coriander, coconut, tropical life savers and pepper. Highly carbonated and that's becoming a hindrance to fully enjoying this one. Notes of pepper, soft ripe fruits and a hint of funk and yeastyness. More lifesaver, some alcohol heat peaking its head in every once in a while. A decent underbelly of peppery, soapy, lemon/lime and coriander notes. A lot going on here, this one really struggled to come together for me like the better examples of the style. I'd like to try a bottle that had been aged for a year or so."
"Anyways, if you like beer theatrics, you can't beat this one. If you like an American take on a Saison, this is not a bad choice."
"D: Easy to drink. Refreshing. I can't wait to try some of their other brews."
"Out of a 750ml capped bottle. Pours a hazy golden orange color with a tight white head that disipates into a nice cap. Sweet floral aroma, some honey and some farmhouse funk, peppery & musty. A nice honey suckle flavor, pepper, banana, and green apple; a bready malt and a bitter/spice from the rye. A sturdy body with fizzy carbonation, nice balance between sweet and bitter. Probably could use some less carbonation. A nice American made saison. True saison flavors with a nice drinkability."
"D- I took my time with this one & enjoyed it alot, but next time i'll share my bottle, I promise. These ""brett infused"" beers take a toll on my stomach after a while but that won't stop me from drinking them. Interested to see what time will do to this."
"Flavor is very nice. A honeyed and candied malt base provides a sweet counterpoint to the herbal and rustic qualities of the hops. Some rye spiciness and cracked black pepper accent nicely. And just a splash of lemon tartness adds depth. Finish is nice and dry and the alcohol is barely perceptible. This is quenching and good and something I'd return to often if it were available around here."
"750 ml bottle purchased from Beverage Warehouse in Marina Del Rey for twelve dollars, split with friend Drake right before the Black Orchard on 1/4/09, poured into my Duvel tulip glass, color is a bright medium orange with some red tint, huge two inch fluffy white head that steadily decreases into a pillow that leaves some nice lace, aroma is made up of citrus, coriander, pears, light wild yeast, toasted bread, slightly sweet malts, and pepper, flavor profile is great with thanks to the rye and breattanomyces components, starts off yeasty and earthy like a saison should be, the middle is rather bready a times, funky in the finish with brett, herbs and spice make up the aftertaste as well, found a different quality with each sip, quite good, somewhat bitter in the finish most of the way through, super dry, funky, slightly lactic, chewy, and earthy mouthfeel, aggressive level of carbonation, taste lingered, medium body, could drink a large amount of this, light on the stomach, smooth, keeps you coming back for more, alcohol is hidden very well for being over eight percent, one of the most enjoyable beers I have had from the Bruery yet, simple but so complex at the same time, if this was not as expensive I would drink it more regularly but that is what you can expect from a beer with these ingredients and careful aging, look forward to my next experience with it, recommended"
"Maybe something good can come from Orange County..."
"A good saison, just not my favorite."
"Thanks to Mauerhan for the opportunity to try this one. Shared with ThirstyBird and RomanW70. Served in a tulip. Opened with a slow gush. Poured with a four inch fluffy, off-white head with honeycombs lacing the cap. Excellent head retention and copious amounts of lacing. Nose was cloves, yeast, coriander and a musty/skunky character. Taste followed nose, but also a little citrusy and perhaps a bit minty and grassy. Mouthfeel was light-bodied and very lively with a mild astringency. Really easy drinking with a well-hidden abv and a dry finish. Great offering from the Bruery and a really nice tribute to the style."
"Bottle courtesy of Bu11zeye: Poured a deep hazy copper color ale with a super huge white foamy head with good retention with some great lacing. Aroma of light funky ester with some fruit notes also discernable. Taste is a mix between some fruity ester with light funk and a nice Belgian malt backbone with some subtle dry hops also noticeable. Full body with limited filtration and perfect carbonation while alcohol is very well hidden. Very well done but lacking some character to be truly great."
"Pours a glowing honey color, with a towering foamy off-white head which is hanging around for the long haul, and leaving clumpy sheets of lacing in its path....very impressive in the glass! Earthy aromas, peppery, lemony, yeast. Lots of peppery spice on the tongue, some fruity flavors, lemon, maybe a touch of sour/bitter apple skin....delicious. On the heavy end of medium-bodied, pretty substantial beer, some gentle lingering spice. A fantastic Farmhouse Ale, something I would actively seek out again in the future."
"Hazed orange with a fine, off-white collar. Quite sticky with lots of lacing. The aroma was spicy with a muted malt character, rye, fruit, fairly fragrant with some earthiness and floral notes. Moderate bitterness, bready with some spicy rye and ripe fruits, lemon, a bit earthy in the malt department. Medium bodied with average carbonation that ended up being quite lively. Light warmth. A solid beer with lots of character."
"7/4/8/4/15 (3.8/5)"
"Very drinkable and well made beer."
"drinkability is great. this is an excellent saison. well balanced, good depth, with that little something extra from the brett. i've really liked everything from this up-and-coming brewery and look forward to more in the future."
"I am glad I took the Brothers up on their review and traded for it. Pours a lovely cloudy yellow with huge white head. Balanced not sweet or too bitter, and on the tad dry side. Masterful, with spiciness that comes on boldly after initial creamy mouthfeel."
"On tap at the brewery for the AHA rally. A light amber orange and an off-white head. Aroma is spicy, fruity and a little alcohol. Flavor is complex, apples, pears, spice from the yeast, and some alcohol. Light, highly carbonated and a dry finish. A slight alcohol bite but over all very nice. I'd like to try one with some age when the Brett character comes out a little more."
"Hazy amber color with a large white head that retains very well and leaves a lot of lacing on the glass. Really earthy aroma with some funk to it, not a strong funk like you might expect in a beer with Brett (as I don't believe this has any), but more of a musty kind of way. Hay, cracked pepper, and some ginger also come into play in the aroma; I love Saisons like this. Taste almost has a rye bread taste at the beginning. I get the same musty hay in the taste, then some pepper and other spices, before a strong earthy taste sets in. Lingering earthy, dry finish, carbonation is high. Very well made Saison, I'd love to drink this again."
"Overall: This is not a classic saison as the brett makes this more like an American Wild Ale to my palate"
"Nice amber-orange color with a head that quickly faded. It smells like spice and a little honey, actually pretty good. I can barely taste the brett but I do taste it. The flavor is odd but not bad at all, hard to describe like candy but not really. The mouthfeel is a little too fizzy for my liking, kinda like a soda."
"Light golden in color with a one finger white head. Good lacing on the glass with a low constant head that dies down. Smells like other farmhouse ales, noticeable spice in the background. The Brett is barely noticeable along with some alcohol. Spices on the tongue, carbonated well, a little warm, crisp. A tasty saison, not bad."
"Pours a cloudy amber/orange, thick and big bubbled white head forms, nice lacing, good layer and ring, looks real nice! Smell is vanilla wood, spices, rye, bread, sour and lemony, wheat, very dry and excellent aroma. Taste is similar, some vanilla woodiness, spices, rye bread, lemons, wheat, dried ginger, very bready in the finish, light tartness, very nice. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with high carbonation, great flavours and really drinkable. I love what the Bruery is doing, classic styles with a new twist. Very enjoyable stuff and some stand up gentlemen. Thanks guys!"
"Overall an above average brew. I appreciate the interpretation, but it's not as refreshing as most saisons, which I attribute to the sweetness. Worth trying for sure, though."
"The body is a bit sweeter than typical Saisons. Some alcohol notes as well, but overall more on the moderate side. Carbonation is a bit much but that is style. Overall I think this beer needs to age. Some spicy and yeast notes would do well with time."
"This really comes across more like a tripel than a saison to me, although obviously it has a different malt bill than a tripel. Still, that's what I was left thinking from pour to swallow. Ok, I'm done beating the dead horse here. An interesting take on the style, although throw style guidelines out when reviewing this beer. The dominant spiciness of this beer detracts from the drinkability a bit for me, but this is still a winner. Interesting beer, worth a shot for sure."
"D: one 750mL and I am done. I enjoyed it but it seemed a little too sweet for the style."
"d: Thanks to rallison for the chance to try this one. I need to explore this style more, as I find myself liking it a lot. This was on the spicy side and quite dry."
"Drinkability- A bit too sweet and overcarbonated for me. Otherwise not a bad stab at the style."
"Overall, Saison Rue is a great brew that is recommended to anyone who enjoys this style."
"Screw the take on bottle bombs... I'm grabbing a few for the cellar. Given a few months (or years) to let some of the spice settle down and the brett come forward... I could see this being a favorite from the cellar."
"Overall one of the better in the style I have had. I was very impressed with this one. The brewery really seems to have their shit together, as I have tried a few now and each seems better then the rest, really some high quality stuff coming out of here!"
"Edit - Upped the taste to 4.5 (from 3.5) and drinkability to 4 (from 3) after having an older bottle where the Brett really started to work its magic. Great funky, cheesy Brett notes come out, mixed with the spice of the rye, just great. A good beer young, but great once it ages. Original score (3.7)."
"This could be a bit drier as I tend to like my Saisons with less sweetness. If this wasn't so excessively carbonated already I would hold on to a couple bottles as the Brettanomyces should dry this out over time. As it is though I can only strongly recommend to not hold on to these bottles, drink up the bottle bombs as soon as you can. Hopefully things will have calmed down by batch 2, cause I really do want to age a couple of these to see what the Brett can do. Having said all this, the beer is still quite tasty and definitely a hit with me; rustic, spicy, nicely grain influenced and even a touch hoppy, I am really digging the mix of flavors profiled in this beer."
"An interesting interpretation of the style. Definitely worth a try."
"Overall, I like this one!"
"Recommended. I can't wait to see what aging will do for this one."
"The good news is this gets better as it warms and there's some potential here, but the bad news is the spice and bitterness of this beer needs to be cleaned up if it's going to compete with the few saisons I've already sampled."
