"Very different than any other beer I've ever had. The smell, is great!!  The taste, is done what like a Hefeweizen without the wheat taste, however, slightly too much citrus for my taste. Still, excellent beer."
""
""
"Bright gold and clear. Citrus aroma. Taste is sweet with hints of apple and Belgian yeast. Medium body. Great saison."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a cloudy golden color with  virtually no head.  Lacing is minimal.  Has the typical farmhouse aroma.  Taste of Belgium yeasts with a bitterness at the end.  Very bready.  Decent saison but not among my favorites.  There is something off with the aftertaste."

"Overeall: Iv been on a streak with great beers this winter, and this is not one of them. I saw that it was $4.99 and figured i couldnt go wrong. I admit im not a big fan of saisons/farmhouse ales, but i found Brooklyn Sorachi Ace and Ommegang Hennepin to be a lot better. I think its the yeast strain in this that turned me off a bit. Victory is normally excellent, but this is probably my least favorite beer iv had from them and most likely wont return."
"My only question, does it need to be 7.5%??? Could it be the same beer or nearly at say 6?"

"Picked this one up at the farmer's market. Really nice hodgepodge of spices and citrus my only complaint may be a little too much alcohol taste in the finish. It would hold it's own against other farmhouse ales that cost double the price."
""
""
"My take away, which is quite surprising, is that this beer sums up my experience of the 2010 infected Matilda I had which had more of a reddish hue to it with a greater head retention. As it warms from the 30'sF it gets much funkier. I am very impressed and would certainly buy several more bombers of this for the price point of $4.99. It's a steal folks and very well executed."

"Found this in the basement, was not fresh. Opened the bottle and it gushed. Super funky nose, more malt complexity than I remember. Intensely tart lemon and hay flavors mixed with some pepper and layers of base malts. Brett is there in full force. Really enjoying this one. Surprised how well this evolved considering it was over two years past the enjoy by date. Wish I didn't lose half the bottle, but I should have known it may be a gusher."
"Taste shows the good yeast/hop relationship again in the flavor...I really like the aggressive hop flavor with the lightly tart, fruity yeast. Malts still could use a defter touch I think and just let the yeast and hops do their thing, but as it is, they add a little sweetness that is not altogether unpleasant. This is one of the better American made saisons, very good brew."

"08/08/13 From bottle. Surprisingly different from the Victory Sunrise Weiss. This is much more robust & spicy. Very assertive, yet enjoyable. Ever have a very BIG friend. The kind that almost scares people that don't know him? This is like that guy. A gentle giant as it were. Make room."

"O: This one flies under the radar. Where else can you find a 22oz, 7.5% abv Brett saison for around the $5-6 mark per bottle? Perhaps one of the best value buys out there. If you're new to Brett, go to school with this beer. It certainly isn't the epitome of the style, but it's simple, pleasant,easily crushable, and a good introduction to the world of brettanomyces. It is worth noting that this bottle kicked around for a year or two. Brett tends to dry out and funk up a beer with time, so this may be quite a different experience when fresh."

"O: Give it a try if you like brett but I'd pass if you don't"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I didn't detract too much for the end taste given I can't account for the freshness of the beer. Assuming age is the cause, I believe I would enjoy this beer quite well fresh, even though Saisons are not my favorite category."

"Pours a slightly hazy light amber with one finger of soapy white head, settles to a thin layer leaving a few splotches of lace on the glass. Smell: pepper, floral, light brett fruitiness, lemon peel, hay. Taste: unripe nectarine mild tartness, grapeskin, doughy, then into lemon, grassy hopping, peppery towards the finish. Light/medium bodied with a soft, plush feel. Mildly tart melon ending. Would be nice if Victory would put out more of this and less of mediocre IPAs."
"pretty complex brew. there is a sourness to it for sure. not getting a huge amount of funk. lot of lemon, sour grape, hint of vinegar, spice, a buttery quality, smooth, citrusy. a complex, high abv, still somewhat light for summer, still full bodied and full flavored. very drinkable awesome"

"overall; something worth buying for the unique blend of flavors, but you wouldnt buy it again."
""

"Good on a hot day. Reminded me of oarsman with its sour twist."
"Overall: Pretty nice saison and a good bang for your buck."
"O - This is generally a very good beer. I think the yeast let loose a few rogue elements that detract slightly, but I still found the beer both approachable and enjoyable."
"Pours a hazy yellow honey color with a foamy, sticky white head on the surface. Aroma is filled with citrus, perfume-like flowers, yeast, barnyard funk, soft pale malt, and some black pepper when swirled. Dry floral flavor, yeastier than the smell, but with much less Brett. Peppery spice, clove, dried fruit, lemony citrus, wheat, and subtle malt. Dry, snappy medium body...very enjoyable and drinkable. An underappreciated, underrated bargain of a Saison from Victory."
""

"This is a great example of one of my favorite styles, saison. Decent amount of sour and funk. Easy to drink - recommend serving at 40+ degrees as this truly gets better as it warms."
""
""
""
"Golden color, bright white densely foamy head that leaves spotty lace behind. Aroma is a delightful surprise. Sweet, funky, mellow, lemon fruity, spicy, black and red pepper, clean soap, phenolic, yeasty. Unexpected brisk light citrus pine around the edges. Just right. Taste is juicy, yeasty, fruity, floral, with numerous other interesting qualities. Flavors are cherry, wood, yeast flavors of fruit, bubble gum, soap, even a touch licorice, and lemon. Also tart, and crisply dry through the finish. Very nice surprise. Victory always seems to know exactly what they're doing."

"O - I like this, great price to quality ratio. As stated very refreshing. Is a nicely balanced saison brew."
""
""
"Probably won't have again; maybe worth trying if you are into American-styled Belgians."
""
"O: saison well-done; not as dry as some but full of citrus character and bright tartness; subtlety with the brett was apparent; solid pale malt base. Authentic-feeling take on a classic Belgian style, nice balance between a rustic and polished overall character."
""
""
""
""
"This is my first time having it since the re-branding from V-Saison. Overall a very nice example of the style."
"Overall, a tasty little Brett saison, but there are others that I would likely pick up first, and that fact is only exacerbated by the fact that Victory is not easy to procure in my neck of the woods. Still a solid offering and if it was local and easy to get, I could see this being a good beer to grab regularly to get that Brett fix when some of my favorites (which are usually seasonal, limited release or out of my distro area) aren't available."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a decent saison but not one of the best. Personally, I think it's worth getting this beer at least once."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 12/26/2013. Pours moderately hazy deep golden amber color with a 2-3 finger dense and fluffy off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big perfumy lemon peel, orange zest, pear, apple, wheat, black pepper, clove, floral, grass, herbal, bread, light funk, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big lemon peel, orange zest, pear, apple, wheat, clove, black pepper, herbal, grass, floral, bread, light funk, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of lemon zest, light fruits, wheat, pepper, clove, grass, herbal, bread, light funk, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent saison style! All around great complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
""
"Overall for 4.50 a bomber this is great. I'm not sure how old this bottle is but imagine its not fresh, still tasty and drinkable. Probably a good saison for those new to the style."
""

"O-The balance is off, the bubblegum flavor throws stuff off. Expected better from Victory."

"I bought this beer 10 months ago and was concerned it might be at the end of its best days. I don't think that was an accurate thought. Good stuff."
""
""
""
"O: For a $4 bomber this is really nice saison. This is definitely one that you might try introducing to a new saison beer drinker."
""
""
"Overall- A very nice beer. I like a little more balance between spice and citrus in saisons whereas this beer seems pretty tilted towards the citrus but still a pretty enjoyable beer and at a great price."

"The flavor is a bit sharp/medicinal for my tastes but a good complex flavor, great price as well."

""
""
""
"You can taste the 7.5% in this Saison summer style ale... lingering alcohol finish, but quite not as noticeable upfront with the other omplex bright flavors present"
""
""
""
""
"O: If it's summer, this is in my refrigerator. At 40$/case this is a great summer beer which stands up nicely to most dinner fare."
""
"This is a medium bodied brew that is modestly carbonated. For 7.5% it has a mild hint of alcohol but is otherwise hidden quite well. Very nice drinkability and complexity for a saison. At 3-4 bucks a bomber, you just cant beat this. If you havent already had this, what the hell are you waiting for?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"i'll buy this again. Very decent, very drinkable."
"This beer intrigued me because it came in at a super low price for a bomber, but unfortunately did not deliver in the taste. Something about it did not set well with my palate and I can't recommend it."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- When I first had this, years ago, I straight up did not like it. And, now that my nose and palate are both more accustomed to saisons...it's still not amazing but I appreciate the nuances and drinkability. The more things change, the more they stay the same...kind of."
"Pours brilliant gold, yellow bottom, orange top, white foam cap. Sunny. Malty nose, very modest. Yeasty taste, some funkiness. Pushy bitter that hangs around. Lemon peel. Very rindy. Lots going on in here. Beautiful looking with a very good taste."

"for the price to abv and taste ratio, this beer cannot be beat. its an odd beer, a filtered saison, pouring pale straw in color with golden tones and a massive white head, fluffy, and rising well above the rim of the glass. the nose is surprisingly funky, especially after tasting their very lackluster swing saison. this one has som nice lemony tartness to it, mouthwatering. the flavor is very light, very summer. grassy notes, fresh, and way more farmy than I gave it initial credit for. some pepper in the yeast too, although also light. the grain bill is respectably simple, and the finish on this is nice and dry. one would never know its alcoholic strength either. but why 7.5% I wonder? it seems like itd make a great session summer beer at 5%, but with the alcohol amped up as high as it is, I cant quite figure out this beers true identity. clean finish and lighter body because its been filtered clear. carbonation could be a little stronger, but I have very little to complain about here, this is a lovely beer from victory, and full redemption for that sub par summer session saison they did this year. under 5 bucks a bomber is a steal for a beer this good."

""

"O: This is the Hop Stoopid of saisons - why do I say that? Because it's a high-quality, no frills interpretation of the style fantastically priced by bomber standards. That, and Victory could really stand to put this in 6 packs. Still a really good saison regardless."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a unique Saison although I cannot say that it is my favorite. The pepper gets to be a little too much and I am not crazy about the mouthfeel."
""
""
"Overall: Really fantastic. At around $4 it's going to be a frequent get."
""
"The taste starts off with a pleasing malty character that is quickly overtaken and succeeded by a low but pungent citrus bitterness. I found this to be fairly easy to drink."
""

"O-a nice Saison at a great price, great summer beer, very enjoyable"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O/D - A very good saison. I think I would enjoy this more in the summer. A rather funky one which I think is more true to the style vs. today's lab clean versions."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky honey orange with a foamy off-white head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Thin rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, spices, and Brett. Taste is much the same with a crisp Brett flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and dry mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with great aromas and flavors that make it super easy to drink."
"Overall a great American Saison, very refreshing and would be great in the summer. Great pickup to for $3.79, much less than the old corked V. Would buy this one again."
""
"Decent saison but fairly generic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"this ale from victory is a fresh one. the look is clear and golden with white head and a good bit of lacing. the smell is zesty, with citrus and i feel like i am detecting a honey sweet fragrance. the taste is fresh and crisp with citrus flavors. this helios has an oddness about it that is different from anything i have ever tasted. they nailed the summery fresh zesty beer thing, but there are some slight flavors in the background that i cant put my finger on. those flavors bring a uniqueness to this beer that i didnt expect, because of that i think you should pick one up if you see it."
""
""
""
"Personal Rate: 3.75"
""
""
""
"O: Incredibly funky fruity and refreshing... drinkable, dry, farmhouse ale that's one of the best readily available saisons at a tremendous value!"
""
""
""
""
"The beer is a bit of a gusher, with a formidable white head. The aroma offers citrus, hops, brett, etc, very nice. Flavor follows suit. Light to medium in body and highly drinkinable. Delicious. $4 per bomber?!? Alrighty then. Absolutely worth a try. I look forward to revisiting this one."
""
""
""
"Pours a golden yellow in the glass with good carbonation. Carbonation is finer small bubbles and a layer remains on top of the beer through consumption. Good lacing. Nose is floral - like a fresh field of flowers. Taste is also fresh and refreshing - has body yet still light. Again very floral but also spices like Rosemarie and thyme. Floral flavor lingers well after the finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A nice Saison, if a bit on the dry / crisp end of the curve. At $3.79 / bomber very sessionable, and I could imagine knocking back several of these on a hot day."
""
""
"O: A nice saison from Victory. Decently complex and highly drinkable (especially for 7.5%) at a great price point ($3.49). More-so recommended for the summer months, but even in the winter it's not bad"
""
"Overall I thought this was a good beer and a good example of the style, it had all the qualitys that I look for in this style with some nice complexity while being very crisp and refreshing. This beer had good drinkability. it went down pretty smooth, was refreshing, and the flavors held my attention, I could see this being a great choice on a hot summer afternoon, I think a bomber would be the perfect amount for me. What I liked the most about this beer was how true to style it was, the brett gave it the earthy and slightly funky aspect that really tied everything together and doesn't overpower the beer as can happen easily. What I liked the least about this beer was that comes in bomber, this is the perfect candidate for 12oz bottles, a six pack would be great to have during those hot summer days. I would buy this beer again, but I'll probably wait till the summer to revisit it, it wasn't too expensive and it was a good example of the style, I recommend giving it a try and it might make for a good and easy introduction to brett beers. All in all this beer delivered just what I wanted from this style and I thought it was a very solid Saison. So far this is the best beer I have had from Victory and it's up there as one of the better Saisons I have tried, good job guys. I'll have to try a couple more of your beers."

"O - A well-done beer for its style, but the hopiness and lemony taste made it less appealing for me. There are other saisons I'd prefer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Enjoyable, and strong enough that one bottle gets me there... Relatively affordable too!"
"It was light and had enough flavor. I picked it up on a whim. Brewing my own was going to work better with the bomber, and I found that trying out other the brews inspired me to make something better...or equal. I was inspired to try out a light brew next batch. Nice on all counts."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I really enjoyed this. It has some lovely rustic, earthy and dependable flavours to it, but manages to amalgamate them all into a clean, very drinkable beer. Good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I just wasn't feeling this one. Pale straw-yellow pour, mostly clear, with a fluffy white head that retained well and left lots of lacing on the glass. Mixture of sweet and funky on the nose with a promise of earthiness. Taste was interesting, lightly toasted grains, yeast, musty grass. A little thin overall, and just doesn't deliver what I like in the style. Light body, and fairly drinkable if you like saisons, but not something I'd go for again."
"O: Very good for a Saison, actually I have never had a bad Saison. All the characteristics of the beer are consistent with what this type of beer is suppose to be. Its hard to overlook this beer considering the price at most packies."
"Overall, not sure if this is made with brett (no mention), but I get some nice brett notes out of it. Nice Belgian and a great bargain at $5 a bomber."
""
""
""
"O: awesome beer, only 2.99 for the 22 oz bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a growler that was a few days old. The head was a little flat but that expected. Pours a bright golden color with a tantilzaing smell. Classic Belgian sasion taste that I would describe as dry, bright, lemony with slight spice notes. Overall a delicious beer I really enjoyed."
"the very floral scent really worked for this one.... up until i tasted it, and it tasted like i was eating a bouquet. i'm sure there's people out there that will like it, i do not. still a pretty refreshing ale nonetheless, and a very unique saison."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very nice Saison. One that has a slight Brett character that is not overwhelming, but very enjoyable. Something I would recommend."
""
"Drinkability- very nice, better than I thought it would be"
""
""
"Poured into a snifter, this ale pours brilliantly clear straw color with a medium bright white head that quickly diminished. The aroma is moderately peppery, slightly spicy and citrusy, and some earthiness (almost cilantro-like). The flavor is rather peppery and spicy up front with a dry, wine-like finish with a medium-low hop bitterness. Simple, yet complex and interesting if that makes any sense. The carbonation is medium-high and body moderate. Overall a well made, tasty brew, worth a try."
"Deep yellow with a hint of amber and near perfect clarity. Poured with a big frosty white foam that slowly reduced to a wispy cap. Lemon and orange zest aromas, funky,earthy yeasty aroma with a hint of spice and hints of biscuity malt. Medium bodied with smooth but aggressive carbonation. Funky yeast flavor from the start with a hint of spice into the middle. Lemon and orange flavors from the middle transition to biscuit malt and once again the funky yeast at the end. Finshes with a lingering yeasty funt aftertaste. This is a fairly subdued saison, but very enjoyable and easy to drink. Personally I enjoy saisons, but find drinking several to be difficult. The funkiness tends to wear down my tastebuds. But the Yards saison was very drinkable."
"The mouthfeel is on the lighter side with carbonation being above average. Overall I was really impressed with this beer and can't believe it's taken me this long to try it. The Brett was light and not dominating, but really made the beer for me with it's complex flavors. At $3.99 a bomber I thought this was a great value as well. One of the best light and easy drinking beers I've had all summer."
""
""
""
"O- A very nice and tasty Saison. Victroy makes a great Saison at a great price, definitely will be picking this up again. Very easy to drink."
""
""
"Drinkability: Pretty pleasant saison."
""
""
"[O] A higher degree of attenuation - or less residual sweetness - would have elevated Helios from VERY GOOD to EXCELLENT. Nonetheless, this is an upper echelon American-made saison."
""
"That said, it does a decent enough job to pair with a spicy meal, and that's all I need it to. I'd give it average marks overall."
""
"Not a bad saison, the nose was quite nice but the flavor loses a bit of balance."
""
"O - I wish this Saison had a bit more going for it than just lemon character. Make it more potent! Make it sour!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very drinkable, but somewhat dull and not sharp on flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer smells like an outhouse or baby diaper. Even took a survey to those around me and they agreed! It tastes beeter than what it smells like. When not smelling it it tastes more like a sour beer. Not a fan. Had it @ churchky in dc for $2.5 a 4oz. I wouldnt drink it for free."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is nice, juicy lemon-herb-clove, with light fruity raisiny-pear sweetness and lemony-herb-peppery bitterness and a hint of pine resin. It has a nice, well-rounded character and feel."
""
""
""
""
"Pretty tasty beer. Sweet but not overwhelming, and pretty clean. Not much I can say negative about this offering from Victory."
"O - Pretty decent saison, and a great value at $4 a bomber, but too sweet initially and too bitter on the finish to be very good."
"Overall: Very enjoyable beer and good for the price ($4.49)."
""
"Beer is medium-bodied, with a fairly crisp amount of carbonation and overall mouthfeel. Finish is semi-dry."
"A good, slightly funky brew that is almost BPA. I find this a bit too bitter and phenolic to be great, but it is quite good."
""
""
""
"Drinkability/overall- this beer is very well balanced and thirst quenching has plenty citrus and tons spice, its super easy drinking and that helps make for some what average complexity, in terms of value its freaking home run at 3.49 a bomber, at great price certainly worth try for decent though not great beer of style"
""
"Overall - Some flavors are good, some flavors are off. Not a drainpour, but not anything I want to drink again."
"So I'm reading the back of the bottle and they say it is orange hued. Compared to bud light sure but pretty much a dark yellow with a big white head. Pour this one slowly. I'm pouring it into a frozen pint glass nice and carefully and I'm getting a lot of head and about 1.5 inches of beer which subsides but leaves a nice fine thin head that persists throughout the whole experience. I see all these comments on lacing and yeah it's got it but who cares so lets get onto the smell. I saw another poster and they were getting hints of band aid. I think that's on the mark and may be a product of this type of yeast. Yeah it's there but don't let that turn you off it's band aid good in a way the smell of gasoline or a new shower curtain is good, am I right? I'm not a fan of the style in general but its better than just drinkable. I just tasted a dash of white pepper and there isn't any in here. There is nothing earthy here, all sky from the big bubbles on the palate to the lemons in the tree with more Meyer sweetness than Eureka sourness. Overall I enjoyed this one even the taste of the belches afterward. I suppose I'll have to get more schooled in this style but I'd grab another one of these especially since the price is so right. I love HopDevil so I'm looking forward to more of Victory's brews"
"D: a well-made saison from victory. i really dig that an offering of this quality is so cheap. i believe i got this bomber for $4 which is definitely one of the cheapest saisons ive had. good shit."
"Overall, a touch sweet in flavor for a saison, but there are some drying qualities and light touch of yeastiness. Its tasty and easily drinkable but not a down the line saison."
""
"O: Fresh, light, zesty; a decent sipper."
"Overall – For the most part it is really quite a fantastic brew with many great characteristics. Unfortunately, the after taste that it leaves in the mouth, really takes away from the overall enjoyableness of drinking the brew."
""
""
""
""
"I call this one a cellaring success. If I were to spend the money to do it again I would sample at about 10 months to see if I could get slightly more brightness out of it while still preserving my beloved funk levels. But as it is, I still enjoyed it immensely at 13 months. So if you like to amplify saison funk levels in your basement like I do, I can tell you that it does work properly with this particular brew."
""
""
"O: a pleasant surprise given the unappealing aroma."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Saisons are not my favorite but this is one of the best examples of the style. I would consider a few of these while sitting on the patio after cutting the grass."
""
""
""
"O: This is a good beer. While it differs with regards to other saisons, it's still nice. I would put this in the BPA category."
""
""
""
""
"Either this was mishandled, or something has gone seriously awry. My recollection of this beer from an earlier, unreviewed tasting was more favorable."
""
""
""
""
"A solid saison that can get a touch overbearing at times. Not as drinkable as it should be with all the yeastiness and prickly feel, but still compares ok against others."
""
""
"O: For $4 this is quite a bargain even if I'm not a huge fan of this style. There's a lot going on here I still can't fully describe though, one day I'll have a better palate for this style of beer."
"O - It isn't the best saison out there but it is very good. Helios is one of my go to bombers because it is always available, cheap, and comes in a style that is usually more difficult to find. Saison is one of my favorite styles and the fact that I can run to the grocery store and grab a bomber of helios for half the price of inferior saisons is very nice."
""
"O: This is my first real experience with a farmhouse and while it wasn't a bad experience, I'm going to have to bone up on these to really appreciate them. Overall though this is what I expected from this style."
""
""
""
""
"This is a great enjoyable saison. Mix of interesting characters of density, brightness, fruit, funk, hint of sweet, just great."
""
""
""
"Overall a really pleasant surprise. This beer really impresses right now. Definately worth a try and probably more than once."

"O/D-For just under $3 a bomber, this is an incredible deal. I have had $12 Saisons that aren't as good as this. I was pleasantly surprised by the funk/tart aspect of this beer. Enjoyable and probably my favorite Victory beer. To me, this beer is an underrated gem. The money value here is exceptional. Literally one of the better Saisons I have recently had & for a quarter of the cost of some of the overseas versions of the style. Much better than I expected."
""
""
"Overall, this is a decent attempt at a saison, but I find the nose to be quite offensive."
""
"O - Not typically my first choice of style, but I was hoping for a little more depth in flavor and maybe some sort of fruitiness, which I simply didn't get at all."
"O: Good take on the style for an American. If this one is around for the summer, I'll buy the hell out of it. Recommended."
""
"A tad sour and sweet (apple) with a clear nod to citrus flavors of lemon and lime with an herbal flavor. There is also a touch of spice, perhaps black pepper mixed in as well. The hop snap on the finish is equally as spicy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I have to thank Victory for introducing me to a new style, and for making it affordable. I will have to pick up some more bottles and explore a few other saison options."
""
"Overall, not the absolute best siason (it's that pink lemonaid middle dragging it down), but it's fairly close. And as a budget minded foodie who really loves pairing beer with food, absolutely nothing can beat this at $3."
""
""
""
"Conclusion: I very much enjoy this beer fresh, and the age hasn't hurt it much, so I am giving my aged bottled generous ratings based on how the beer is fresh (I can't ding the brewer for their beer not aging perfectly when they didn't intend for it to be aged). I am glad for the experiment, and the enhanced brett qualities are very enjoyable. If you like dry brett-influenced flavors (think aged Orval), stick one of these in your cellar for a few years, just let it warm up a bit and swirl out some of the excessive carbonation before making a final judgement."

"Dr: It's very drinkable for the style and ABV. I'd like to try this on draught. This makes me excited to try more beers from Victory in the future."

"Bottle: Poured a hazy golden color ale with a nice thick foamy head with pretty good retention and some lacing. Aroma of rustic ester and sweet malt is quite enjoyable. Taste is also dominated by notes of rustic and floral malt with some sweet notes which may be a tad too sweet for the style. Body is quite full with good bottle conditioning and good carbonation. Well brewed with nice level of complexity but unfortunately it is a bit too sweet and lack some attenuation."
""
""
""
""
"Overall (4.0): This is a very, very solid saison. It may be relatively run of the mill in some ways, but it nails the style in the process. This would be an excellent introduction to saisons to anyone interested in trying the style. Thanks Victory, for making such an accessible one!"

"22oz bottle $3.99. I bought this because it was cheap and I heard it had brettanomyces, I was thoroughly surprised at how much I liked it. I poured this into a wine glass and it had a bright yellow-orange color and a great head, looks nice. The smell was heavy brett, funk, hay, farm, and a dash of lemons. I sniffed it for quite awhile before taking the first sip, great aroma. The flavor was pretty good as well, heavy brett yeast flavor and a distinct citrus flavor. This reminded me of Boulevard Saison Brett but at a third of the price. I'll be buying a bunch more."
"Overall Impression- A bit too sour for the sour. At the finish has a old/stale grapefruit taste that is hard to enjoy or get through. I finished the entire bottle but this really made me think, huh, this one started GREAT and then finished average. I would still recommend anyone trying this one but there are many other Saisons before this one I would enjoy."
""
""
"Overall a decent farmhouse, wish it was a little less bitter though. An interesting approach to the style. Ultimately, there are other Saisons I'd rather have."
"When you smell this beer you expect much more from the taste. Pleasant enough though for sitting outside on my porch enjoying the cool Florida weather."
"Do not get me wrong. I do recommend it but you need to expect that this beer is heavy in alcohol."

"Wow. Reviews seem all over the place on this one as far as what people taste/smell. Here's what I got: pours a golden amber with a lively white head that thins to a collar and leaves a little lace. Nose is bright lemon and citrus with lemon pepper and a touch of mustiness as well as a touch of white-winey heat. Taste follows suit with more peppery notes and just a tiny bit of grainy sweetness and hoppy bitterness to help round it out. Medium body. Dry finish w minimal aftertastes. Great for the price. Simple, bright, inexpensive and quasi-elegant. Pretty good effort from victory."

"if you like high carbonated lemon lime clubsoda w/a shot of grain alcohol...youll like it."
"O - People talk about a funk in these beers, but I just don't taste it, I did enjoy this beer quite a bit but it didn't quite reach fantastic for me."
"Poured from a bomber into a goblet, the beer pours a bright, vibrant, honey-gold coloring with a thin film of bright white. Good cling along the glass as you drink. Aromas are light and effervescent, with a strong sour component, some light clove spicing, a roast character, and some tart fruit highlights. Flavors are syrupy sweet initially, with a clove spicing joined by ginger and cinnamon. There is a roasted background, with some honey flavors, and an almost mead quality, as well. Aftertaste has a slight linger to it, with an effervescent, old world fruit sweetness and slight yeast sourness. The finish is light, and dries slightly as your palate clears."
"O: I'm still feeling out the world of Saison's but I trusted Victory and they have a solid beer for the style."
"O - It's mediocre by saison standards. It has a lot of flavor, but they don't mesh perfectly. By no means a bad beer, but I'll probably grab a different saison in the future."
"jd"
"Overall - at 3 dollars for a bomber you can't go wrong. It only slightly goes off the path of a true saison but still a very well drank beer."
"O: This beer is really quite good. It's complex, easy drinking, and quite tasty. It's one of the best saisons that I've had. IMO, it's a bit dry to be world class. At $2.99 a bomber, this is a steal."
"D: At 7.5% ABV where you can actually feel the alcohol burn, this unfortunately isn't that drinkable due to that. However, the beer is defiantly above average, I really enjoy this one."
"Overall, very nice but not a great example of a saison as it seems a touch too sweet and full."
"A decent saison with the brightness of the American examples like La Merle but without the classic dry, hoppiness of Dupont."
"The beer is an attractive, cloudy shade of yellow. Decent carbonated head with excellent retention & lacing. The aroma is a yeasty, earthy funk with banana, pineapple, lemon & coriander. The taste is fresh and fruity albeit a little 'grassy.' Light to medium mouthfeel with a clean finish - very refreshing and a great example of the style."
"It's worth a try for saison or Belgina lovers."
"Overall - Well, lots of flavor, smooth and easy to drink, and man its cheap! A great example of the style. Only drawback is it does get a little bitter at the end of each drink, other then that what a great deal and a great beer."
"O- For $3.00/22oz... this has to be one of the best deals on the market! Anyone that loves Saisons should give this one a try, it's a no-brainer! Sweet, spicey, fruity, sharp, tart, and full of flavor! Very easy drinking."
"Pours a clear golden hue which leaves behind frothy sudsy dissapating head and heaps of clingy lacing,the smell is light barnyard funk,strong citrus and some boiled candy,the mouthfeel is medium bodied and has tastes of spicy hops,lemon zest,orange rind,barnyard funk,candy and is finished with a mix of sherbet and pepper and overall its not bad but not the greatest saison out there and i probably wouldnt go out and buy it again any day soon but it tastes nice enough and if offered wouldnt knock it back cheers."
"O- It's amazing how palettes change over time. I had this beer several months ago and thought it was great. Now, I feel as though its fairly bland and non-complex as the style can be. If anything, it reminds me of a drie fonteinen oude geuze, accept not aged in barrels or with a wild funk. This is ok, and also one of the cheapest bombers available."
"For the price point it's a quality brew."
"O - Not bad. Lacks a bit of the complexity I've come to expect for the style, but immensely drinkable and a good price at $2.99 for a bomber."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is a nice beer to drink for a long time."
"O- A pretty nice domestic saison. I gave it a 4.5 overall because at $3.99 a bomber, with a long shelf life, you really can't go wrong."
"Overall: This is a fairly unique saison. The grassy finish is borderline and it is gonna keep me away from getting this one again."
"From a bottle, pours clear gold with a puffy white head. Nose is grassy saison yeast, fresh hops, some coriander-like spices, and citrus rind. Mouth is an interesting montage of fresh hops, citrus fruit, and Belgian saison yeasts. Bright and fresh. Moderate bitterness throughout, especially on the back end where it lingers a bit. An interesting take on a saison and certainly not a typical example of the style with all the citrus hops dancing about."
"Grade A dank Saison!"
"O - Until now, my favorite Saison was Hennepin, but it has just been dethroned. 22oz bomber of world class Saison @ 7.5% ABV for $3?1!?!? Unheard of...."
"O: I think I've found a new pal in the form of a $3 bomber. Go Victory! Not the best saison ever but for the price and brown bottle, this kicks ass."
"Overall impression; a solid beer that doesn't taste as strong as it is but nothing terribly novel or impressive."
"What a beautiful beer. Pours a 3"" head tinged canary yellow. Clear sunny yellow body. Smells mildly of citrus zest although as the label tells it doesn't contain any citrus or spices, it's all from the malt, hops, and yeast. Taste has the citrus zest too in a fairly rich body and a substantially lasting finish. This beer is classy, would have appeal to both BMC and craft beer drinkers, and is really a good value at the $3.70 per 1 pint 6 oz size I paid for it."
"Helios pours a hazy copper color with a large white lasting head. There is a strong lemon smell, alot of floral smells as well. The taste is strong, sharp, and alot of floral notes. The taste while is full, can be too sharp and can be a bit offensive and can use some more carbonation. Overall a pretty good sasion there are better and certinalty worse."
"A good thrist quenching beer that's very approachable."
"excellent saison, regardless of the price. when you take the price into consideration, this is a can't beat. this is best saison dollar for dollar. will i still drink my old favorites (hennepin, jack d'or)? sure, but i definitely will revisit this again and again. recommended"
"Golden color with a large amount of carbonation. Tons of bubbles sticking to sides and a non stop flow up the middle of the beer. Minimal head but what is there is bubbly and hanging out. Aroma is fruity ripeness. Yeast is present but not overpowering. It blends well with the grapefruit, lemon peel and orange notes. Flavor has a carbonation tingle right upfront but transitions to yeasty bubblegum. Some of the lemon curls up for the finish but I am predominantly getting bubblegum through. The yeast and bubblegum bounce back and forth. At one moment I'm tasting the yeast then the gum. The finish is bold on earthy dryness but there is that typical Saison yeast finish that can not be escaped."
"Overall: Great beer for hot weather. Perfect beer to drink from a tulip or wine glass as a reward for a hard days work out in the heat. Very refreshing. Goes well with a wide variety of grilled foods!"
"This was a very tasty beer, it seemed a little off the style but I found it easy to drink and enjoyable."
"Now to my racer 5 to the rescue!"
"O- Overall, Helios was an enjoyable beer that is worth a try. "
" Addendum- After reading Beeradvocate entry for this beer, I realized it is 7.5%abv. It is as refreshing as a beer that weighs in at 4.5%, i.e. Narragansett Summer. Crack this beer and thank whatever powers you trust. Warning: Your partner may also like this beer."
"D. Nice and drinkable beer...good with food. I would drink again."
"D: Could drink this again, and again. Very nice offering from Victory that I will be keeping my eye out for again."
"Dang, this is a really good beer, and much more than I was expecting. It's got a great combination of flavors, and the smell is just outstanding. At this price, I can't think of a better value in any style."
"Pours a hazy golden yellow. Very lively carbonation in fact I turned my back for a second just after I cracked the bottle and I had foam coming up the bottle and running down the sides. Assertive Brett aromas up front with a bit of tart lemon and a little spicy note, almost like grains of paradise. I find the Brett pretty dominant on the palate on this one, not bad for me since I like Brett, but its a bit more domineering than I want in a summer Saison. Carbonation is very high in fact tied with the fact that it foamed over on me when I opened, it leads me to believe the Brettanomyces got a little out of control on this one. Still, I am able to enjoy this beer as it offers a fair amount of complexity."
"O: After the look and smell of this beer, I was quite excited. It was disappointing. I enjoy Saison's a lot but this one did not cut it for me."
"Overall this is a pretty good beer. I enjoyed. I haven't had many saisons at all but this one was a good one to start with."
"A bomber of Helios from the brewers at Victory, apparently inspired by the sun. The beer pours a clear yellowish-golden color, similar to the sun perhaps. A big cap of white foam dissipated quickly. The nose contains some apple and yeast with cracker malt underneath. Nimble on the palate, the flavor begins with a touch of Belgian fruitiness but is taken over by lemon tinged sourness. The apple the yeast and the lemon combine to create a thirst quenching experience before the end drops out. A good summer ale and respectable attempt at the Belgian inspired ale."
"Overall: I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. I thought the hops along with the yeast spice went quite nicely. A good offering and something I would have again."
"Overall: This is good for the style. It helps wash down spaghetti very well. It's well constructed and very affordable."
"O: Definitely a good summer beer, light on the tongue yet tasty."
"O: I'm good with beers where the Brett character is a little more muted, but there's a lot of it in this one. I guess that's not bad if that's what you like. Not a bad beer overall but this particular one isn't for me. I still give it 4/5 since it's very well done."
"O - This is such a great beer. One of the best brett-ed saisons out there and, for $3.50/bottle, one of the absolute best craft values, bar none."
"Overall I guess this one is OK but it really is either too much yeast or spice since it's kind of off putting."
"Popped the cap on this one and went to rinse out my glass, and the bottle was noticeably foaming over when I went for the pour. It pours a very hazy straw color with a huge head that quickly settles down to something more manageable. Aroma is good, a bit of ripe fruit, funkiness, and yeastiness. The taste is very good as far as my tastes on saisons go, the fruitiness, funkiness, and just a hint of hops keep the yeast in check. It's just a deliicous sour. The mouthfeel is crisp and highly carbonated, and the drinkability is very good for the ABV. Overall, this is a great saison! Saisons are really hit or miss with me, but this one's a hit for sure."
"O: good. But not that great. A saison, yummy. But not something I would trade for."
"Pours golden with a thick, frothy, white head that 1/2 fills the glass to start, fades to a more reasonable level, and sticks around as a nice cap. Aromas of very ripe fruit. I get grapes and plums, with a touch of barnyard floating around as well. The taste is quite fruity as well, but with some definite funk- which is a pleasant surprise. Notes of ripe, soft cheese and a touch of barnyard complement the peach and cherry notes. A little bit tart in the mouth, and on the softer side. A bit different than I was expecting, more of a farmhouse ale take on the style. Quite nice."
"I hope this was a bad bottle as it tasted skunked. Besides good carbonation and mouthfeel this tasted bad, bad, bad (as in spoiled). Found the expiration date on the bottle and it's 2/12 so I must assume that either I hate this kind of Ale, the bottle has been seriously mis-handled or this type of beverage has been fooling people for years and is another case of the emperor not wearing clothes."
"The beer pours a beautiful golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice pale malt scent that's light along with a mild hop bitterness and a damn fine yeast aroma. It has a nice citrus feel as well as a good deal of funk. The taste is good. It has a smooth pale malt flavor; easy drinking, a solid base. The hops provide adequate bitterness and the yeast rounds out the palate with lots of earthy farmhouse funk. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an above average saison. It's flavorful and true to style, although the appearance seems off. It looks like it filtered, which takes away from the authenticity."
"Pours a golden body with a white head with good retention. Aromas are bursting with bakery fresh bread and yeastiness, with a strong savory notes. Flavors of sourdough bread with honey on top. A pleasant sourness lingers long. A layered, delicious brew brew."
"Overall this is a good Saison. Recommend letting it warm up a bit to avoid the alcohol taste."
"Love the style, big fan of the brewery; this beer was just not for me. There are other Siason brews out there that are far better."
"Very tasty, and refreshing."
"O: A really nice saison from Victory, this brew does seem to harnass the sun's energy into making it taste so lively and citrusy sweet. The 7.5% ABV is noted only slightly in the robust, Belgian flavor profile. I'd love to grab a bottle for my next chicken piccatta or orange-glazed salmon dinner."
"overall this was a good rendition of a saison type ale. enjoyable for sure on a 90+ degree day."
"This brew pours out as a bright yellow color what is pretty clean looking. The head is big and white, it leaves a decent lacing down the glass also. The smell of the beer had a zesty aroma kind of citrusy and yeasty. The taste of the beer is a little citrusy with some spice and some light bread flavors. The mouthfeel was tingly, good amount of carbonation for this brew. The body is on the thinner side and pretty refreshing. Overall I'd like to try this one again some day, it's just a matter of time and money before I can get some again."
"big huge white head while pouring a very clear golden color with strong carbonation. smells earthy with farmhouse qualities. taste is dry and somewhat continued earthiness, though lacks funk. citric flavors pop in the finish and linger on the tongue. very light bodied, lively and refreshing. nice seasonal offering from victory. overall solid saison that I'll be picking up more of at $4.99 a bomber."
"A solid saison a little let down with the big aroma's coming through and the taste didn't seem to match what I was getting."
"A damn fine saison."
"Drinkability: It's spring/summer, and that means it's Saison time! This is definitely a worthy and affordable American interpretation of the Belgian Saison style. I benchmark everything against the best Saison in the world, Saison Dupont, and this one comes very close for an American beer. Will definitely buy more of this for the summer!"
"Aroma is strong, crisp, yeasty and a little fruity. It pours a slightly hazy solar yellow with a thick, fluffy white head that sticks around. Light, refreshing flavor is fruity and malty, a little hoppy, a little yeasty, slightly bitter and rather enjoyable. Fizzy texture leaves a fairly persistent tingle on the tongue and lips. Brave Helios, wake up your steeds!"
"O-Overall a solid brew. Not overly drinkable. Definitely need to take your time with this one. Nice stuff from Victory as usual."
"The alcohol really kills this one. Were the abv 2% lower it might be a winner. As is, it's drinkable but I'm not even slightly interested in finishing more than half the bottle; should have waited to split it with someone."
"Hmm. Poured from the 22oz bottle into my fluted pilsner glass. Cloudy bright color, quite nice. Smell and taste were more flowery than funky for me. I like the saison style but for this one couldn't get past the flower petal taste. Mouthfeel was medium-light and easy to drink. Overall not too bad but I like Hennepin better."
"It's funny how textbook Helios is. It's great. Personally, I enjoy/prefer/seek-out the often wild variations and rustic quirks among the many spectacular Belgian creations in this general style. But Helios scores high regardless. Pan-appeal."
"First sip is... nice spicy yeast flavor. light body. There is a phenolic, dry finish. Overall a very nice saison. Maybe finishes a touch too sweet, but that is a minor criticism."
"Notes: Overall a nice beer with some decent layers of flavor within a nice drinkable package."
"Poured a nice golden color witha hugh fluffy white head. Great funky aromas, brett, barnyard, rose petal and hibiscus. Light to medium bodied, dangerously drinkable, tart and funky with a nice bitter finish."
"Grows on you with more sipping. I let it out of the fridge for an hour so but a little more warming didn't hurt. I;d like to try this again from another batch."
"Pours pale, hazy yellow with active foamy head and some sediment...virtually no lacing. The appearance reminds me a wheat beer. The smell is yeasty and has that bottle aged Belgium smell that stings your nose. The flavor is similar to wheat beer, but this is super crisp and fruity. The down side is that it has the mucky aftertaste that I don't love about wheat beer. Previously I haven't noticed beer tasting like lemongrass, but this beer really does have that lemon/herbal grassiness. The body is really light, even at a 7.5% ABV. This is something that I could have a few of easily. When super cold, this is refreshing goodness. For being pretty similar in style (vaguely), I prefer Oberon from Bell's Brewery."
"poured from a bottle into a pilsner glass. The appearance is cloudy and straw-like. The smell is not overwhelming,some spices but nothing overwhelming to the nose. Now the mouth feel is fantastic,swished it around and it was almost as if I was chewing on a piece of bubble gum. Taste wise it was good pretty sweet with a little bitter finish and great beer to sip on a warm afternoon but also an easy beer to sneak up on you with a pretty decent abv."
"Pours a lovely golden amber with an off white head. Smells strongly of Belgian yeast, white grape, and caramel. The taste is so complex, up front is the yeast with a sour attack, then it gives way to celery, coffee, and finishes with juicy indoor fruit, namely apples. Mouthfeel is light with moderate carbonation. Overall this is the beer that helped introduce me to the wonderful complexity Belgian yeast contributes to flavor profiles."
"O: I quite liked this beer. A very nice nose and a pleasant flavor made for a good experience."
"Fruitier, sweeter, and misplaced spicy/plastic taste are the main reasons why this beer doesn't compete with classic Belgian versions, but is certainly on par with others make in America."
" The taste is very good, with some yeast fruitiness which leans toward white grape and the hop flavor is herbal/spicy. Some of the spice seems to be amplified by the yeast and alcohol is adding to the dry quality of malt and yeast in the brew. I like how it is refreshing with good flavor from the yeast and has some hop bitterness. The saison is very traditional in taste -true to the standard Dupont which is good, drinkability is ok, but I prefer a little more malt. This is a super dry and a little on the alcoholic side for my taste."
"Very nice. Not one of the masterpieces, but certainly one of the better saisons available and for less than $4 a bomber, why not?"
"D: I Could easily drink 2 bombers of this in a night without a problem, especially at such a great price."
"Taste-Spicy, ""dusty"" yeast; nice hop bite, fruity with a dry, peppery finish. A bit of underlying sour/tartness while not unpleasant, doesn't quite harmonize with the other flavors and keeps me from giving this beer a higher score. That being said, this is a fine, refreshing saison that would be welcome on a warm sping or summer day."
"22 ounce bottle, best before December 21, 2011. Served in a tulip glass the beer pours a hazy golden/orange color with an inch off-white head that went away quickly. Pretty much no lacing left on the glass. Aroma is pears, lemon peel, peppery spice and some grassy hops. I can taste peppery spice, lemon peel, grassy hops, and some pale malt. Also, there's a bitter/sour flavor that kinda reminds me of sourdough bread. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit crisp and has good carbonation. Drinkability is decent enough. I think this is an OK beer, but it's certainly not one of the better saisons I've had. However, for $3.99 a bottle it's worth a try."
"2007 bottle. Somewhat clear golden fluid with a white head of decent makeup size and retention. What does cloud the glass is chunky and suspended well. Smell is malty with apples and pears. Some alcohol, funk, and faint banana. Some floral hops. Taste is quite sweet with a big malt core and bready dinner rolls. Some alcohol flows in and while evident is quite well integrated. Nice hop blend adds the requisite balance without taking away the spotlight on the malt. Feel is kinda full and creamy with an excellent carbonation. Drinkability just makes the 4 as I usually find saisons to be a bit more quenching and lighter. Still a satisfying brew and on I will revisit fresh."
"From random notes: Poured a hazy straw color with a huge white head. Malty nose with notes of coriander, leather, pear, hay, and floral hops. Medium body with ample carbonation. Flavor is very earthy, spicy, and floral, notes of coriander, yeast, hay, alcohol, grass, ripe peach and lemon zest. Finishes with more earthen spicieness. Nice, but average beer however."
"D: absolutely fantastical! fabulous beer i am so glad I happened upon it. I am definitely going to beat the southern CA heat with this beer this summer. I love this beer."
"I love a good saison. This one is a golden colored liquid with a lot of solids floating throughout, but, other than that, good clarity. Very little head, however. The smell is great...lemon rind, clove, pale malt, spice, pepper, and orange blossoms. The taste is semi-dry, with a notable malt flavor. The clove and citrus qualities come out as well, along with a cheesy, aged hop taste. I wish that the beer were more spritzy, though...although carbonated, it's a bit too still. Great flavor and spell, but it could be a little better."
"D: Certainly to the American side of things. Identifiable as a saison, though if it were called a hoppy Belgian pale or BIPA, I'd believe it. Good flavours but not a lot of complexity compared to the better versions of this style. But for less than $6 a bomber, it's pretty inexpensive for saison."
"D- It's strange, but I would totally have another. Makes me want to grab my hoe and start working the soil."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and light but enjoyable. Overall, Helios is a solid saison with a very attractive price point at 3.99 for a bomber. At that price, I'll definitely buy it again."
"All in all, this is an outstanding beer and a great introduction to anyone who's never had a Belgian style ale, especially a farmhouse ale."
"D - I will not have another. This beer doesn't do anything for me."
"D - An excellent saison; probably not at the top of the list but provides lot's of flavor and depth for a very reasonable price. I'll come back to this one again."
"D. at 7.5% it's a bit heavy, but I could drink this all summer long. Sorry I didn't find it until the end of the season."
"D- Very nice refreshing, dry, medium bodied, spicey, with light fruit notes, works really well. Very nice beer!"
"I wasn't expecting this kind of flavor out of a siason, but it worked pretty well."
"Drinkability is high. Flavorful enough to remain interesting but not something that whips your taste buds either. This compares favorably with Hennepin with a little higher amount of hops."
"D: This is one of the best US made Saisons I've come across, avoiding the common under-attenuation pitfall. The Brett is a great touch, and really transforms this from a decent Saison, to one that is exceptional."
"D: This is not like any other saison I have had but that isn't a bad thing. This beer is sour and refreshing, I like it."
"Very drinkable and nice."
"D - very, very drinkable, though I wish it had been warmer day"
"Notes: A great saison; I hope the Helios is just as tasty."
"D: A very enjoyable saison from Victory. Thankfully not an overhopped version of the style, which I was a little concerned about. This primarily lets a bold yeastiness play - definitely not a bad thing when this is the result. I thought it could have been slightly sweeter - even for a dry style, this one seems slightly over-focused on yeasty fermentation byproducts."
"D. Pretty quaffable stuff - wish I could have found this around here over the summer."
"Pours light with a whit head. Straw coloring. Nose is citrus, pepper, spice, and some earth. The taste is light and grassy with a bit of flowers. A bit of lemon and pepper as well. Feel is light with high carbonation. A decent attempt, but nothig truly special."
"the beer has fairly high carbonation, and a thinner body. crisp, minimal aftertaste. its easy to drink, fairly refreshing. would be a good summer beer. it appears my bottle was un-affected by the extreme over-carbonation safety issue."
"Drinkability. I took down two bombers no problem. It hides its alcohol with the best. It saddens me this is a summer beer because I could drink it all year long!"
"Overall I would try it again, especially for the more than reasonable price tag, but I wouldn't recommend this as the saison to try or a great representation of the style."
"Very drinkable, I finished the bottle myself with my meal. I would gladly grab this one again for my next BBQ."
"$3.99 a bomber, Ill drink more...nothing special though!"
"Overall impressions: Nice beer for a Saturday night. Not too much of an alcohol burn for something this strong. Probably my second favorite Saison."
"The mouthfeel was excellent rendering this brew very drinkable. I wish I had another to savor. A fantastic Summer brew, but welcome anytime I'm sure."
"Helios is the type of beer a non-beer drinker might enjoy. It's very pleasant and very bright in appearance, flavor, and look."
"D= Yummy beer. This was one of the two recalled batches and I didn't have a problem. No gusher or anything. Mine was pushed all the way to the back of the fridge for a while right next to the cooling unit though. Wonderful beer and I look forward to buying again."
"Way better than the bottled version. This is much less sour and much more tasty to the style. Very good!"
"This is a really nice example of a Saison, I am really digging it right now. It is perhaps a little sweeter than I would prefer, but the initial carbonation really helps to offset this in the beginning. As time wears on though it seems to not maintain the interest, it loses a bit of complexity perhaps, or more appropriately, I think it needed a bit more fermentation complexity. It seems to need a bit more yeast derived spiciness and bite. I think that the grain character, which is nice by the way, becomes a bit too dominant in the end. It somehow weakens the finish of this beer."
"Yeah man, not much you can say about this one except that it's an insanely good deal - very good beer for the best price around ($3.95). A solid saison with pretty much everything you'd expect from the style, meaning a light orangy color, nice funky farmhouse nose (not too strong though), and then a generally light and drinkable wheaty-citrus-lightly sour flavor. A tasty brew for a phenomenal price. Will be getting it again."
"D: I am able to take pretty substantial size gulps without wincing. Highly drinkable!"
"Also, while I do not allow price to impact my reviews, the $3.99 a bomber price tag on this makes it a steal."
"I've been wanting to revisit this guy, but I kept getting bad bottles. Thankfully, the CK has my back yet again. It pours a clear pale straw topped by over a finger of white suds. The nose comprises mandarin oranges, peach, grapefruit, and a light kiss of a caramel. The taste is nearly identical, with some additional mild floral bitters. The body is a heavy light, with an active carbonation and a crisp, dry finish. Overall, a very tasty brew, possibly my favorite regularly-available saison."
"Clearly a delicious brew from Victory which utilizes the farmhouse style but adds in their own splash of signature style. This was super fresh out of the growler and I can't wait to pick up some more."
"The body is a little heavy for my liking, but the massive amounts of carbonation make it feel lighter and easier to drink. Just a solid beer that happens to be inexpensive."
"The nose was really scaring me into thinking this beer was past it's prime but the taste brought in some really fine citrus flavors. A great beer from Victory."
"D: The beer is refreshing, but not quite as some of the others in this style. However, I would definitely try this beer if I wanted to have a saison on a warm day in the spring or fall."
"d - A decent saison, but not much funkiness to it. Some nice citrus, especially oranges, in the smell and taste. Would try again."
"Quite a wonderful Summer-themed ale from Victory."
"drinkability is good. nice balance. pretty refreshing. i'd have liked it just a touch drier, but it was nice."
"Out of a bomber this beer was a hazy, golden color with lots and lots of rising carbonation. This translated to a very vigorous head of yellow-tinted foam that was a good three fingers thick and refused to yield over time. The aroma was of crystal malt, pale malt, Belgian yeast, some mustiness, semi-sweet citrus peel and floral hops. The flavors were ...weird?! A blend of citrus peel, spicy hops, musty malt, black pepper, earthy yeast and a very herbal, very bitter finish. All these strong elements might have been desirable if they complimented one another but sadly they seemed to compete. It smelled very farmhouse but tasted very outhouse. Ouch! The mouthfeel was foamy, the body medium and the carbonation medium/high. The off notes I detected and amount of frothy head I saw leads me to believe that this beer was mishandled. I'd like to add as a caveat thusly that one's experience with this beer might likely be better than the bomber I tried."
"Nice crisp finish. A perfect REAL beer for the summer time!"
"Notes: A beautiful example of what a judicious use of wild yeast can add to a Belgian-style beer. Or perhaps they just have an incredible ""Saison"" yeast - and if so, where can I buy it?!?!"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color is a very light clear straw color with a white foamy head. Copious amounts of carbonation rose from the bottom, with the head not clinging at all. Aroma was very slightly sweet, with a touch of lemon. Prevalent aroma was wheat. Taste was very earthy, with a small amount of bitterness. Felt decent in the mouth, perhaps a bit much on the carbonation. Very drinkable, a nice middle of the road."
"D - I had been told by a fellow BA how great this beer was and finally gave it a shot...he never told me it was a brett beer (might have been afraid he wouldn't see another bottle in the store if he told me). This is a great surprise find for me...love saisons, and brett infused ones especially. All I can say is...this is one hell of a beer for $3.50/bomber. If you like brett beers give this one a shot...just not if you live in MA - leave these bottles for me!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, crisp, and this has a semi-dry finish. Drinkability is excellent. This was a nice surprise, something I've looked past before, but something I won't underestimate again. A really nice summer saison."
"Overall: I truly believe this is an under appreciated Saison and not only that, it is priced to move."
"The mouthfeel is lively with tiny bubbles of carbonation. Very drinkable and well balanced beer. A great summer beer and fantastic with seafood (and most food for that matter."
"D: A good drinker."
"Another well-crafted saison that sits well in the middle tier and would be worthy of another purchase."
"Helios is a strange beast. It smells very good, especially for an American Saison, and avoids being too malt-forward and sweet by simply going 180 degrees in the opposite direction. The high (for the style) levels of grapefruit bitterness and what I suspect is bottle conditioning gone weird are the only things holding this back from being a superior American Saison. Recommended, especially if you can get a new batch and drink them a few months apart. I'll surely try it again."
"Pours a large 3+ finger head of pure white foam, while mostly smaller bubbles, loose with a very whipped up and dimpled appearance, good retention at about a finger's worth, lacing only somewhat sticky. Murky yellow straw color, strong effulgence, a few beads visible here and there. Rye, wheat bread and white grapefruit to lemon citrus bloom biggest in the nose, soft and generously spread throughout clove and pepper spice, noticeable presence in the apricot, peach, pear scents, the slightest hint of cocoa beans. Close to full-bodied, the carbonation has an aggressive, if fluffy, churn. Friendly orange, white grapefruit citrus and that apricot, peach, persimmon fruit make for a sweet mouth entry, you get the mocha before the wheat, rye, pumpernickel bread. Some moderate grassiness. Not simple per se, but goes for approachability over complexity."
"4.0 D: Good saison. Not overly fruity like some and a good complexity with complementary flavors."
"this is a very nice beer, a nice take on the style, something different. nice to have the funk as well as a defined hop character. definatly worth a shot, ill be revisiting it soon."
"Ranks as an A but I think it is more of a B+."
"Pours a clear golden with some suspended material and a big white fluffy head and great streamers of carbonation. The aroma is light and spritzy, with a sharp phenolic edge, lots of fruit, apricot and pear and apple. The flavor is crisp and typically Victory - malty and firm and yet subtle and clean. There is pear and apricot, with clove and allspice and rosemary. Herby hops coat the tongue and give it a powerful but not overwhelming bitterness on the finish. The mouthfeel is slick and clingy."
"D- overall a pretty good drinker for 7.5% ABV, not to mention the $3.49 price tag, but just not impressive for a saison, the bitterness is a little out of character perhaps"
"Overall, this is definitely a great value beer and delicious to boot. Just drank it with the ""World's Greatest Sandwich"" (thanks to the movie ""Spanglish""), and it was a match made in heaven. Definitely something I'd look for again on a hot summer night."
"Over all I enjoyed the beer, relatively refreshing and easy to drink. I think it would be better with just a little more of the funky character and a little less carbonation"
"A bit on the sweet side for what I expected. Seems to taste like it is between a saison and Victory's Tripel. Easy to drink and pretty tasty, but ultimately not very special or memorable."
"This saison from Victory visually fits the style with a large, rocky head and dark golden body. Hazy from the yeast sediment. As the head dissipates it leaves slight lacing on the glass. Sweet malt and light fruity aromas dominate the nose. A biscuity yeast scent lingers with notes of cherry and lemon. Helios is again hits the mark in the farmhouse style with a crisp mouthfeel and medium body. The taste is malt-forward with a great ginger character and a rush of spice in the finish. Mild hop bitterness. The 7.5% ABV is hidden well which aids in superb drinkability. The label states that Victory was going for a specifically Belgian style, but it could use some improvement in the hop profile and choice of yeast before it's close to its Belgian forefathers. Overall, a great summer beer that I'll come back to."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkablity, I cracked a 22oz and could have another, great for a saison, I think the only thing I would like to have is a little less alcohol so i could drink more of it! Very good beer"
"I had this by growler recently and the brett was significant yet well integrated. Funkiness was nice."
"D- This beer is very very drinkable. Nothing over the top flavor wise but still bursting with flavor. Easy to finish a bomber and could crack open another one. I think the lower price I paid for this ($3.39) has something to do with a good drinkability score. Victory puts out good beers and this is no exception."
"Pours a nice golden yellow color with a thick head and visible carbonation and particles. The head gives way to almost no lacing. The aroma is of wheat, with hints of clove and a little pepper, there is also a smell of banana present. The taste has a wheat backbone with a nice banana taste over the top rounded out with a hint of clove. The mouthfeel is dry and moderately carbonated. Overall this is a very solid beer, it has a nice variety of flavors to keep you interested."
"Bought a couple of capped 22s at the brewpub retail store for like $6 a piece I think. Awesome deal for a great beer. Pours clear gold with nice steady carbonation and fluffy white head that fades to a thin lacing that sticks to the tulip glass sides. Smells peppery with lemon and a noticeable Brett character. Brett is a little musty but mostly barnyard. Taste is similar as the nose with a noticeable funk. Feels light and refreshing with some alcohol warmth. Overall, a very well executed beer that I've increased my appreciation for the more that I've grown a taste for Brett and funky beers."
"Victory Helios is a very sparkling, pretty clear, pale golden ale with lots of particles. It has a huge, fluffy, white head that has outstanding retention. There are lots of bananas in the aroma, with notes of lemon and phenol. It smells fruity and funky. It has a lively, medium body that starts a little heavy on the tongue and becomes very light at the squeaky dry finish. It has a very phenolic flavor overall. There is a little herbal bitterness and something earthy in there, but it's hard to notice-- Everything is overpowered by the taste of Band-Aids. A long Band-Aid finish lingers. Yech. Band-Aid juice."
"Overall, timing is everything. I was looking for something that was going to refresh me in today's heat, and Helios did. But, if I would have been looking for an over the top Saison, I wouldn't have found it."
"A sharp wheaty spicy flavor -- do I detect some alcohol burn? It's a big(ger) beer so I guess that could be possible. Ultimately this brew won me over. I'm going to continue to investigate this style and may re-review this one down the road."
"If I was at the brewery I might try it on tap to see if somehow it was mishandled between Philly and Myrtle Beach to cause the experience I had, but I probably won't try it in a bottle again."
"D: Easy going. Nice and refreshing. Would like it too be a little more complex for the ABV tax though."
"drinkability: not a awesome saison, not sour like preferred. but a decent beer and a good beer for people learning."
"Taste is funky. It's sweet and tart, hard to explain, it's right on for a saison but there'. A bit of that hop bitterness as well as wet horse blanket. I'd say skip this beer but I'm not a big fan of the style."
"Pleasing, but not exciting. Yummy, zesty/sour saison. Not too complex, but good with food,and great drinking on a spring/summer day."
"D - Just doesn't taste as good as it needs to to be drinkable."
"The taste is ok a little grassy flavor and more skunk. However, its pretty easy to drink, not that you would drink a lot of it."
"D: I had this with a spicy Chinese-Korean dish, and the pairing was awesome. Alone, this is a beer to be savored."
"glad it was only $3.99 a bomber to try it. Never again."
"The nose is just fantastic. A beautiful saison nose, there's a blend of light lemon and grassy hop character, a touch of Brett-based grassy funk, a moderate spice character with a little coriander and white pepper, some honey and a light bread note. Light floral character as well. Just fantastic. The palate is just as excellent, opening with a big, Brett character, just a fantastic, grass notes, blended very well with a light hop character, mildly German in nature, particularly on the finish. With a blend of honey and spices, this is the epitome of what a saison should be. Light and crisp on the palate, this finishes with a great drying, grassy, light hop character. Fantastic stuff, this is something I'm going to drink a LOT of this summer and after."
"D- One of the lighter saisons in terms of flavor; I steamed some mussels in this and had a glass to go with them, and it was awesome, but I'd easily drink this on it's own as well."
"Gotta let the giant white fluffy head settle down a bit. Maybe a bit too aggressive on the pour. Somewhat hazy straw gold colored body. Lace sticks all over. Sweet malt nose decked out with lemon and spice. Light malts backed by lemon, spicy alcohol, pepper, touch of barn yard. Almost want to call the mouth ""harsh," very active on the tongue. Pretty complex brew."
"D - I would pick this up again at this price point. This is a refreshing beer and has plenty of flavor. This is my first Saison and I will definitely seek out this style in the future."
"Pretty nice drinker for a farmhouse style."
"D- the carbonation in the beer hinders this from being a beer you can drink in 20 minutes. Overall not bad but different."
"Drinkability - I could definetly polish off this bottle, for the ABV, extremely drinkable"
"Bright lemon yellow brew with rigorous carbonation clinging to the glass. Billowy eggshell head flares up and then settles readily to just a few wisps. Nose is moderately thick with light malts, lemon, some light caramel, candy sugar. Taste is green apple, spruce, lemon peel, cinnamon. A good well-rounded hoppy bite, but not a hop bomb. Just enough malt background to support the hoppy flavors and provide mouthfeel but not enough to play a huge part in the flavor. Almost like a blend of IPA and blonde. Good with pizza after a hard day in the garden."
"Drinkability - Very refreshing saison. Great balance, although nothing that makes me say, ""wow!"" Overall, a great American saison at a great price."
"D - In the overall world of Saisons, this is offering from Victory is middle of the pack at best (which isn't necessarily a bad thing)... However, it is an absolute steal at $2.99 a bomber... Balance out those first two facts and this one is highly drinkable... Worth a try for Saison lovers and a must for those in search of a craft beer bargain..."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and the carbonation lends to a crisp finish. Drinkability is on the higher side. Finished the huge bottle with little trouble. I don't know if I could have another (its quite a lot). But I still recommend it."
"This is an outstanding beer. It's not one I would have considered before and I'm glad I had the opportunity to try."
"Lots of carbonation. Bright and clean with a fizzy feel. Refreshing and zesty."
"Notes: This quite a brew from Victory I am glad I picked this one up. Cheers."
"D: I really enjoyed this beer a lot. Reminded me a lot of a Belgian Pale Ale, and I almost want to call it a ""poor man's Orval"" and I mean that in a very nice way...for $4 a bomber, and for how good it is, it's tough to beat."
"While this is far from a bad brew (and at $3.49/22 oz, not a bad bargain), there are other widely-distributed farmhouse ales that are more worthy of your time & money."
"A solid saision, nothing too special, very peppery, light and dry, perfect for a warm day. Only costing $4 is another huge plus for something this solid."
"This is a highly drinkable saison that is really well crafted. A relative bargain of a beer as well. I would have this one again."
"MD- Light and bubbly. Not a bad beer but not really my style."
"Great drinkability. This would be a good hot day beverage, a good drink to pair with a meal...Or alone. I've only had a few Saisons, but to me this is a solid beer and a solid Saison."
"All in all this is definitely a beer to try and for the price, more so."
"The mouthfeel is light, dry, and bubbly with refreshing carbonation. This was a nice bottle to have, but I wouldn't grab for another right after."
"D: A solid brew all around. Definitely something for those hot summer days."
"pours a golden copper color. crazy amount of light fluffy head that receded very quickly. lots and lots of carbonation, but nothing to disticnt as far as the flavor is concerned. very thick lacing covers the glass. overall a very enjoyable beer, especially if like me it was a sunny 70 degree day outside relaxing in my backyard when i first enjoyed this tasty treat. WELL worth the 4 bucks i spent on it."
"HAIL HELIOS!"
"Bomber poured into a tulip glass. Color is Bright cloudy yellow with white fizzy head. Fair amount of sediment floating around. Thick head settles into a nice creamy layer of suds. A little lacing but not a whole lot. Smells like a saison should smell. Yeast, spices, pepper, citrus, perhaps some cloves. Lots going on there. Tastes grassy and lemony. Hoppy bitterness comes though at the end. The taste isn't as complex as the aroma. Medium mouthfeel that drinks rather easy. Dry, smooth texture to it. All in all it's an enjoyable beer to drink."
"D: Since each sip becomes a bit more of a chore as you drink it, the drinkability isn't all that high. I was quite taken aback by the less desirable qualities of this beer but delighted by its good qualities. Not for everyone, but give it a try and see if it's for you, I would never dissuade anyone from drinking it."
"Victory recommends this as a ""pair with food beer", and I have to agree. It was so crisp and refreshing, I have half a mind to buy a case for nice dinners. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability: This is a pretty easy drinking ale. A good session beer from Victory, though it is a little strong to have more than one or two. The price point can't be matched, however."
"D: Nice and refreshing, a simple but enjoyable saison and at $2.99 for a bomber a steal of a deal."
"$3.99 for a 22 oz. bottle is a steal. With just a scant few tweaks here and there, soon there will be no beer in Belgium that we can't make here just as well. I like that idea."
"Very drinkale, no alcohol presence to note. Very tasty."
"Pours light golden in body with white frothy head that leaves some attractive lacing. An aroma that is distinctly belgian: burnt sugar, some pepper, lemon zest, floral notes. Tastes of lemon zest, pepper, floral, sour notes, orange rind. Light in body with some feisty carbonation. It's a fine ale but doesn't represent the style as well as other brews do."
"drinkability: This is a superb selection for anytime of the year. Easy to throw this back, then the 7.5% reminds you what time it is. This $3 bomber is a dream come true. Victory by a landslide with this one."
"D: Wasn't as easy to drink as I would have expected at first, but still enjoyable."
"D - Extremely. I've had this on tap and from the bottle and it's both pretty much the same. I'd quaff this all day in the summer. 4.5"
"M/D: Nicely carbonated and lightly bodied, this displays that classic saison property of being overly drinkable in a high-alcohol format. Proceed with caution, and enjoy!"
"I really enjoyed this beer. It has all of the wild appeal that I like in these type of beers with one difference. The lemon peel/citrus notes add to this beer but still leave a bit of funkiness to it. Helios is really crisp and refreshing. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, but for this style, it seems to work really well. My overall impression is pretty good for this beer and will get a good score from me."
"I'd get this again, and again, and again, especially if it hovers around $4. It's probably very mood-dependent for me, but it's a good beer for what it is."
"I'd be happy to have this again. I wouldn't exactly want cases and cases of the stuff but I'd be happy if I saw this on a tap menu in a bar."
"Drinkability: An above average saison that has a nice combo of bitterness and fruit. Far from my favorite, one bottle is most I could have in a sitting, but it is an excellent value for what you get."
"D - Very drinkable for a Saison. Not as spicy as most I've tried and sort of tastes like a clash between a Saison and a Pilsner. Has that champagne quality about it. Overall a decent pour and for the price I would get it again"
"d: Very nice saison! A real bargain too, $35 a case!"
"The funk and spice are a little to heavy for me to enjoy the whole 22. Again as it warms, it is starting to show more of it's flaws. Not my favorite Saison. May like this more if it was with a meal. I'm seeing this paired with the local brewpub's blackened salmon chowder."
"D - This is this beer's downfall to me. Too rich; it's flavor is a killer on the tastebuds. On my first sip, I thought this beer was an A+, but I'm nearing my last now and it's going considerably downhill. More suited to 12 oz bottles, but then again, who could drink a 6 of this? But overall, a decent brew."
"Picked this one up, Never had the V-Saison when was out but the art on this bottle (and price) caught my eye. Brew poured into a chalice cup to a nice golden color, crystal clear with a thick white head on it. The head retention was very good and left great lacing. The aroma has a nice mix of grass, lemon and pepper. Also maybe some green fruit? Somewhat sweet aroma as well. The flavor is nice, the grassy flavor comes to mind at first but then seems to break away to a slightly sweet lemon citrus flavor. Pepper flavor is there and adds a nice little prickle with the hop presence. Drinks quite easily and is a surprise that this one weighs in at 7.5%. Overall I would say that this brew is very good based on the flavor coupled with the price of this bomber (3.99). Will look for this one again; think it could be a nice summer brew when looking for something a little bigger."
"drinkability is not so great. sock bad. still manageable."
"D: Would def drink again, thinking of another bottle for summer after grass cutting,mmm."
"Pours a a golden honey color, slightly hazy, with a smallish white head that settles into a ring. The aroma has some horse blanket aromas, as found in most saisons, followed by white wine, lemon and green apple. Some hay aromas as well. Good rustic aroma. The saison has an aggressive hop flavor which seems out of place for a saison. It kinds of gives the taste an asprin like characteristic. The rest of the flavors are spot on to the style. Nice horse blanket, hay, pepper, tart lemon and green apple. The feel is light and crisp, with fizzy carbonation, perhaps a touch overcarbonated. The finish isn't all that great with the asprin like bitterness. Overall, a decent saison. It has some nice flavors but the bitter asprin like characteristics kills this brew for me. Still good though just not great."
"22oz. bottle served in my ST tulip. Poured a translucent orange-gold with a three inch, fluffy bright white head. Copious tiny bubbles effervescing in solution. Head eventually settles into a thin cap, leaving some residual strands of lacing as the brew recedes. Light nose - lemon zest, orange peel and belgian yeast. Taste consistent with nose; however, some tartness comes out towards the middle, a little bitterness follows (maybe lemon rind) and lingers between quaffs; belgian yeast evident in the nose is pretty much masked. Mouthfeel is light and lively with some astringency coming out towards the back. Fairly decent farmhouse; however, lots of acidity and tartness. Closer to a Belgian Strong Pale/Farmhouse hybrid in my opinion. Worth a try if you like cleaner examples of the style."
"Drinkability is quite good. There is a lot to recommend (fruitiness, dryness, yeasty funk) and only a few distractions (too spicy & too much carbonation). I think I would prefer to try this on tap next time, given the opportunity."
"Above average, but not quite exceptional. Something just not quite coherent in the flavor profile that I can't put my finger on other than to say it leaves a slight bitter aftertaste that's only just off putting enough."
"D: This is a solid brew under 8% ABV, easy to drink with a good taste."
"Drinkability: Overall its a great session beer. The high abv limits it a bit, but is a great substitution for white wine and would go great with salads and fish. Hennipen is a bit better IMO but for the price ($3.50) you cant really beat it."
"Pours a hazy pale yellow color, nice carbonation, nice two-finger foamy white head, with lots of sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with lots of yeast, pepper, licorice, spices. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, yeasty, bitter, with some pepper, licorice, and spices. Medium body. Drinkable, not really liking this one, too hot, peppery, spicy."
"D: Drinkability was good, especially for style. Like mentioned earlier the funk balance was just right adding for optimal drinking experience per style. You will no doubt have to be a fan or respective of the style (which I certainly am). This will no doubt deliver an adventuress journey into the world of Belgian funk which was fairly well captured here by an American brewer. Novices may want to split a bottle at first until you gain a appreciation per style but overall for the fan this beer overall was a good experience coupled with a fairly good drinkability and enjoyability factor."
"Clear gold with a fluffy white cap. The bubbles were a bit fizzy, decent head retention, a little sticky. Lemony and floral aroma, a bit grassy and spicy, pear and grain. Nice flavour, fruity lemon and grass, light grain sweetness, light spice. It finished with lingering lemon and spice plus a bit of hop bitterness. Medium to light bodied with ample carbonation. Pretty tasty overall."
"I am loving the mouthfeel on the first sip. Fluffy and soft, full and light all at the same time if that makes sense. It start out full, but doesn't leave a bunch of sticky malt on the tongue. Ample carbonation cleanses allowing for a wonderful finish that asks for another sip."
"I can only hope I got a skunked bottle. This was...not impressive at best. Pours a nice light golden color, and has a vaguely plasticy smell. taste is vaugley matly, but rather astringent. Not hops, no farmhouse quality I had high hope, but this is...poor at best"
"D: would buy if i was on the cheap, it is good, but dupont stills rules the style. but, is a good offering and would drink again."
"Pretty versatile semi-dry saison, but that back end might be an acquired taste. A little like Ralphie in Christmas Story after he says what the fudge."
"D: While this beer is more suited for summer drinking, it's still very drinkable."
"Overall quite drinkable, but after one glass the flavors begin to wreak havoc on the tastebuds. On my first sampling of this beer, my fiancee and I split the bomber; this time, drinking the entire bottle alone, it becomes a bit of a chore. Still, though, it is an excellent beer, and the clerk that sold me the bottle said that he much preferred the original V Saison -- I may have to try that one myself if I can snag a bottle."
"Certainly nice and drinkable. Not many domestic versions of the style can captivate but this holds up well. Worth a try."
"Not even close to what I was expecting from the time I bought it to the time I poured it, but a damn fine beer. Being that it's the middle of the winter and Saison's are beers I prefer to drink in the summer this might be one I have to seek out in a few months to balance out the kolsch, pils, etc."
"D – It is cheap AND delicious. Obviously…"
"$3.99 for a bomber, nice. ""Bottled on Dec 10, 2009"" stamped on the front label, well done. Pours clear yellow amber, long lasting off white head, ample frothy collar and sheeting, below bits of lace. Spiced up, citric nose, more lemon/lime, add a healthy dose of pepper, herbal and fresh tasting hops..all add up to a quite pleasant, zesty and fresh tasting saison...here its a freezing night in january and I've been transported back to a hot day on the back porch in July...bring on the salads and cheese/crusty bread lunches...nice saison, for a nice price, always a plus..."
"I could go on and on, but I think I've pretty much summed it up. Some of these Victory experiments are serious misses in my book. One of the few breweries where the regular line-up is better than the ""special"" stuff."
"Overall a bit malt-heavy, and lager-like - the tweaks to the style are not for the better...but still, not bad, and quite refreshing."
"If you're not into super strong saison flavor, but still like a little funk, here's your beer. Great bang for the buck."
"Now I'm a huge novice so maybe my palate is just feeble and untrained, but I actually had this pegged as a pilsener - I was surprised to come here and see it was a saison. If you like pils, I think you'd enjoy this as well. Oh, and at $2.99 for a bomber...you can't beat the price."
"D - I had no idea what to expect from this beer and it turned out to be a pretty weird one. The wild yeast character is intense with a huge nose of musty and very enjoyable funk. The flavor shows some background notes that are reminiscent of a normal saison, but the funk still dominates. Here it is not as pleasantly complex as it is in the nose, but it is still enjoyable. A funky, cheese-like wild beer it is pretty drinkable for something so over the top funky."
"Very good example of the style, bright color but a little cloudy, very good carbonation, flavor also good."
"Very drinkable, and it doesn't smack you in the face with offensive brett/horseblanket/barnyard/feces aromas or flavors."
"I poured from a 22 ounce bottle into wine glasses. It pours like a typical saison, hazy, golden and a big white head. The smell was lemony, but less than I expected. It had all the flavors I was looking for, but they were not as strong as expected, lemony and zesty. The beer was easy drinking and paired well with my fish. A good value(under $4), but there are more flavorful examples of the style."
"Pours from the 22oz. bottle a golden yellow color with a large pillowy head that settles into a light lacing. The carbonation is light but active. The aroma is of hay, grass, & lemon. 1st sip is crisp & dry, with notes of bitter citrus peel (orange & lemon) that intensify on the swallow. Mouthfeel is bubbly, tingly, light & crisp. Drinkability is superb, I could easily down one after another on a July day. Overall, a very refreshing beer that would go very well at a cookout or on a hot summer day. Quite a pleasant beer! Victory does it again!!!"
"Overall this isn't a terribly complex saison but what's done is done well. Well worth a shot, especially at such a reasonable price."
"Dr. Hope so, I bought a case of bombers today."
"*need to work on temp that beer is served at and what flavors are really coming through"
"D - goes down nicely. I prefer more traditional Saisons to this one, but it is still pretty good."
"Light golden color with huge white head that sticks around for a while. Smell is of apples, brett, and some tart lemon. Taste follows suit, bringing in some pale malt and leafy hops to the mix as well. MF is thin, a bit astringent, was looking for a bit more, although not bad especially for the style. Drinkable and refreshing, nice beer, especially at $3 a bomber."
"F: Very dry, pulling the water out of my tongue and almost giving it a dry singe burn. An almost minty like flavor hides in the background with the fresh dry taste. The sourness doesn't stay too long, but the funky yeasty flavor does. Almost a lemon bread like taste sticking around too. A pretty nice funky farmhouse saison, that gives wild yeast and Brett like qualities, but a little tamer. Still pretty funky though and great for the price."
"I don't think I have had a Victory beer I didn't like. Very drinkable and full of flavor. Well worth checking out."
"Lemon drop yellow body. Slightly hazed. Voluptuous fluffy white head. Carbonation looks to be quite active as multiple streams of CO2 rise vigorously throughout the body. Aroma has a lemon tartness and a little yellow cake batter character. Horse blanket also. Mouthfeel is quite prickly. Body is light-medium. Lemon is big in the flavor with a nice sourdough like backdrop of maltiness. Sprinkle a little black pepper throughout and add a little horse blanket tartness/funkiness and you've got a pretty solid saison. A bit of a lambic feel to it. Unique, but good, saison."
"Pours a clear golden color with a large white head that hangs around for awhile. The head does settle to a thick cap. Moderate amount of spotty lacing is left on the glass. I pick up quite a bit of funk in the nose, barnyard. Hints of lemon and pepper as well. Not as funky in flavor but it is present. Light fruit notes with some spicey pepper. Fairly dry and crisp. The body feels appropriate for the style, light and nicely carbonated. I enjoyed this beer and at its value price makes this an easy buy."
"D: Very good. Paired well with moderately spicy shrimp fajitas -- the fruityness offset the spice in the food, while the lemon complimented the shellfish and the spice complimented the heat in the dish (cayenne pepper & chili powder). Bomber disappeared quickly, which is solid for a 7.5% ABV beer. Ay $3.99 for the bomber, I'll definitely get this one again."
"D: I love this beer and can enjoy it all day, nice with a schnitzel."
"A good and drinkable ale - as a saison should be - however there just wasn't enough there in the flavor for me. The finish was a bit watery but there were hints of grassy farm and soapy citrus. The nose suggested a bit more than what was there. Also it gave me a slight headache, not sure why."
"Straw color and really clear. Fruity but dry, bitter, slightly sour... the funk taste is not overpowering. The nose is funk, alcohol and lemon. Generally one saison at a time is enough for me, though."
"D - Highly drinkable - not the best saison I have ever had, but very good. The inexpensive price (under $3 for a bomber) means I'll be coming back again for this one."
"D- Overall, it is very drinkable. Not the best saison I have had by any means, but nothing in it makes it hard to drink. I wish it had a little more funk. The flavors simply don't mesh that well and nothing really sets this one apart. Great value for your money ($5/bomber in center city Philadelphia, where single bottle prices are outrageous) so definitely one I would consider buying again, but not a stand-out saison."
"Pours a Slightly hazy and bubbly golden straw color. Ample head, decent reterntion & lacing. Smell is of yeast, straw, grains, grass. Mild funkyness. Taste follows the main components of scent, earthy yeasts, straw, grain and grass with a nice faint funk and peppery taste and background fruityness (apple, pear). On the lighter end of medum bodied, full fizzy carbonation. Good tasting saison with well hidden ABVs, only issue is some over carbonation."
"Drinkability is good, but not great. I'd prefer a little more richness and complexity, but overall I would recommend this - would make a great Spring/Summer Saison."
"I had this on tap at Fat Heads in North Olmsted. The beer is bright yellow and hazy with an enormous poof, easily 4+ fingers of foam that needed time to dissipate so the pour could be completed. The range of aromas you find in saisons makes it difficult to rate to style, so I'll rate to my own tastes. Some lemongrass, floral hops (not citrus, more herbal), a little estery fruit in the background. The taste is a little sweet upfront, no real funk which is a shame, a little peppery aftertaste. Delicious despite my wishes for some brett flavors, medium body and refreshing character. A more than decent stab at the style, equal to most of Victory's endeavors."
"D - Ok but not great. There is something funky with this beer so one glass is more than enough to enjoy it."
"Easy-to-drink. A nice refreshing spiciness lingers. Alcohol is very well-covered. Could be a bit funkier. But, overall, a well-done interpretation of the style!"
"D: A great value with the usual Victory quality malting and hopping to finish a tart, dry, and enjoyable saison."
"Poured from the bottle into oversized wine glasses. Beautiful white fizzy head. Golden yellow color. Plenty of carbonation. Great looking presentation. Smell was very ripe and tangy. Taste reminded me very much of a lambic beer. Light and tart on the tip of the tongue. Big dose of Brett fills the mouth. Hoppy and peppery taste. Excellent. Gets even better as it warms up. Not as easy to drink as other saisons due to its high ABV and its Belgian wild ale-like tartness, but I loved it regardless. I have no idea why this is under $4 a bomber. Extremely under priced for a well built beer."
"Victory Helios (formally known as V Saison) pours golden and nice white cloudy head in a pint glass or tulip glass. Helios is something of Saison switch-hitter. At first sip is has mellow malt qualities, but toggles to a carbonated, green apple, yeasty, and subtly spicy finish. I love saisons and this stands out, specifically because it is saison Victory style."
"Flavors are tart and spicy. Some citrus, black pepper, sharp hops. Also sour fruits mixed with a touch of something like clove."
"Overall- Light sourness with a good malt presence."
"Poured a hazy golden-tangerine with a finger of white head that laced fairly well. The smell was a bouquet of lemon, apple, yeast, malt, grass, clove, and other spices that I couldn't place. The taste confirmed all of the above, with the fruits upfront, dissolving to grass and spices, and then finishing with malt and spice. Very nice balance. The mouthfeel had subtle carbonation, and a nice light body, which made it decently sessionable."
"Mouthfeel was prickly carbonation and medium to light in body. A very solid and tasty saison."
"For fans of the style it's a nice solid beer. If you have always wondered what a good farmhouse tastes like give it a try and if you don't like it, take comfort in the fact that this one didn't kill your wallet."
"Drinkability is great! I would love sip this all day. I will definately pick up a few of these if I see it out there. Thanks to whoever sent this as an extra in whatever trade we did!"
"D: a little strong on the 'farmhouse' and less crisp than most, but still great."
"D - Well given the price point this is a nice . Verson of the style. Highly recomended."
"Poured from a brown 22 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is mild, some hints of citrus. Taste is mostly of alcohol, with some yeast flavor. Feels light in the mouth. Not really a beer I could drink to many of. Overall this is a mediocre brew."
"Medium-light gold with a medium-large, white, pillowy, slowly-diminishing head. The smell is wonderfully funky from the wild Belgian yeast. It's dusty with sweet malts and pungent dusty fruit aromas. Peach and lemon among others. The taste follows but with more of that barnyard funk that is an aquired taste. I've acuired it and think it's wonderful! It has a light, lingering medicinal band-aid-like funk mixed with a touch of bubblegum. Odd, yes. But it keeps me coming back for more. It has a medium-light body, soft texture and moderate-lively carbonation. This was a great find, and with its reasonable cost, this is one I definitely recommend trying."
"A nice refreshing beer. In a tulip glass the beer was a gold color with a faint haze. There was a thick white head. It had a pleasant citrus aroma. A peppery lemon taste, with a little bit of late hops. Crisp, thirst-quenching. A good summer beer. Try it."
"Listen, for under $4 it's good to have around. Good, standard quality - nothing really groundbreaking here but it works for those Belgio-philes on a budget."
"D- Split the bomber, but could of took it to the head. The 7.5% is a bit high for a saison, and the alcohol shows it's head only a bit during the experience. If I could cook, i would of made a dish to pair this with as that would have made this even tastier. On it's own, Helio's rock's, even if it's not a ""new beer""."
"Overall this was a very, very solid offering here. I though the ABV was remarkably well hidden and it went down smooth and easy. I would have no issue at all with having this one again any day."
"Drinkability: Around $3-$4 a bottle for this? Are you kidding me? This will now be the best / most readily available / most affordable domestic Saison. I challenge you to let me know where I can find another with those attributes this good, especially one that tastes like an import. Bravo Victory for keeping the goodness if V Saison alive. I'll be buying a lot more of this."
"bomber from State Line, Elkton, MD"
"Pretty drinkable beer. Overall, Helios is another winner from Victory."
"Drinkability: this beer was so flavorful on tap I could have had several glasses in the session. Easy to drink and great saison IMHO."
"22 oz bomber purchased from Total Wine and More in West Orange... Great pour and appearance... Golden and hazy, true-to-the-style with a fluffy, thick, white head and visible carbonation... Raw, dusty, earthy aroma with faint hints of lemon and slight lime which were also present in the flavor... The overall taste lacked the bite and spritz of European Saisons but this was nonetheless a good American rendition..."
"Hazy light gold/straw color with a steady stream of carbonation that supports a fluffy white head and splotches of lacing. Aroma is very fresh and mildy funky. Noble hops, grassy, pepper, citrus and slight alcohol presence. Medium bodied, mildly syrup like, effervescent carbonation. Sweet and funky flavor, balance of citrus (lemon) and earthy grass, yeast with some spice (pepper and clove) and mild caramel malt. Very nice, easy drinking saison, at the price and availability this will become a goto beer."
"Very carbonated up front with a creamy, medium body. Lots of earthy notes, hop bitterness, light crisp fruit, citrus peel, lemon zest, spicy pepper and strong alcohol astringency. Slightly dry finish."
"D- A touch to funky for me to have more than a half a 22"
"It has a huge head that clings to the sides of the glass. The color is a cloudy golden. The aroma is of grapefruit, hay, and bread. The flavors really meld and taste ""farmy"". They don't call this a farmhouse-style Belgian for nothing. Lots of earthy flavors with hay, grass, pine, and autumn spices. Black pepper kicks in mid tongue. Under it and through the finish is grapefruit. It's really a unique combination. I don't think I've had a brew that tasted like this. It could be off putting or delicious depending on your tastes. I like it but I would definitely limit it to an occasional purchase."
"D - Fine version of a saison with plenty of spicy and funky character. I found this to be quite drinkable while still maintaining a fairly complex flavor overall."
"Drinkability is great a beer you'll have no problems with, share with friends don't be stingy. In fact this style of beer when done right has potential to convert most friends especially women to the craft beer movement. I was at Victory's last tenth anniversary party and I hope I'm able to have a blast at the next one. Oh yeah, Victory is supposedly coming into West Virginia in the not so distant future."
"I notice when I'm inspired to write a lot, it's always a good beer. This is better than most and may be my new favorite Saison."
"Not digging this. Probably because I was hopeing it was a pale ale or somthing besides a saison."
" Mouthfeel is citrusy, medium bodied, with a tad bit of clean funk."
"Poured into a glass. Very pleasant apperance, greaterbeing golden glowing color. Very frothy head, many many spirling bubbles to the top. I hope this beer makes me as happy as the sun on the label. Not a huge fan of the smell. Aromas of hops, pine, and alchol. The taste is complex and exquisite. Medley of flaovrs, grain, yeast, hops, spices, cinnamon, and a hoppy piney aftertaste. The mouthfeel is quite crisp and refreshing. The taste stays in your mouth until the next sip replenishes the flavor. I find this beer quite drinkable even with the high alchol content. Good price too, got a 1pint 6oz bottle for 4 bucks."
"Drinkability: Yes. Hand me these every day of the summer and we'll be friends. Very refreshing, very well balanced, well crafted beer."
"This is an undeniably thirst quenching beer, even at 7.5%. I really respect Victory for making this one more ""approachable"" to the masses. Cheers!"
"Pours a clear pale orange with about two fingers of rocky white head. Aroma has lots of fruit, namely citrus but a good dose of apple and pear as well. There is also a nice yeatyness that lurks in the background. Taste is pretty good, complex. The beer is a bit sour and tart at first. This gives way to a yeasty and fruity complexity. Moderate hop bitterness gets lost with all of the more dominant fruity esters and spicy phenols. Mouthfeel is good with medium-light body and high carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good. This isn't exactly like other saisons that I've tried but it is enjoyable nonetheless."
"A tart but very drinkable and refreshing Saison. Great for the ending days of summer. Recommended."
"Drinkability is excellent. This one is so smooth and easy to drink. There's no way this is 7.5% abv. I could drink a lot of these."
"Relative to Saison Dupont, Hennepin, etc., this doesn't really compare in the same style, I don't think. It's a bit too fruity for that. However, don't let that stop you from stashing a few away before Victory runs out for the season. A good value for the $$, too."
"Not blown away by this take by Victory on a saison, but it's not bad and I wouldn't mind having it again sometime."
