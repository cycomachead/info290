The beer smell has strong hop and malt notes. The hop notes are primarily earth and bitter with a slight hint of citrus. The malts are sweet to balance the hops but a fairly faint in comparison. The smell also has hints of pepper and salt that make the smell smell pretty good. The taste is not as complex as the smell but is still pretty good. The taste has strong hop notes that are earthy and bitter while the malts provide a slight sweetness to dull the hops. The taste also has an ever present tartness that mixes well with the earthiness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with bubbly carbonation but still has a smooth finish. Overall, a very good saison and worth getting again.","HattedClassic","Sep 29, 2014"

Bright yellow liquid, shiny, vague orange tinting, not many visible bubbles, despite the shine sort of lifeless. The nose produces the expected notes of banana and bubblegum but then it veers into another realm with tar, black earth, tea leaf, farmland funk, more peppery than floral, pulped oranges, not much fruit, mainly white pit fruit, this puts the “farm” in farmhouse. Full-bodied, muscular and not willingly mobile, same sourness from muddy earth, metal, fallen leaves, quinine, dried pine sap. The citrus recedes and the fruit still refuses to step into the breach. Banana, leesy yeasts and flower water try to pretty it up but nothing is shaking off the funk. Which, in the end, is not a bad thing because it gives it a veneer of authenticity. Carbonation is nothing special, enough to give it a swirling effect. Hard not to characterize this as a “food beer” where when paired correctly any perception of lack will be filled by the dish. But not a casual sipper.","farrago","Feb 05, 2014"

Smell was odd. Lemon, white wine and some vinegar. I began to think 'infection'. Taste was like lemon juice and nail polish. I'd heard from several people that nail polish would be very apparent when you get it, and sure enough, it was. First infected beer that I didn't realize was infected before I opened it. I have seen bacteria floating on the top of a beer before and just didn't open it. This was unfortunate.

All-spice, nutmeg, and grains of paradise, with tart lemon and grapefruit notes all blending together very well. Roasty overlays, with a tangy mouthfeel.

There's also a good amount of lacing. The aroma is nice, the brew smells like cloves, yeast, oranges, and an overall earthy/spicy aroma that I can't really identify. It tastes like citrus/citrus peel, herbs/flowers, grainy/wheat malt, cloves, bubblegum and peppery spice.

My first reaction to the smell is very fruity, as I pick up both orange/banana like citric notes as well as some pears or apples and something tropical. Also yeast, some sweetness (candi sugar or derived from fruits?) and touches of clove in the nose as well. Light-bodied and smooth, easy to drink and slightly creamy/filling, there is a balance and crispness thanks to the hops. As tasty as refreshing to drink, I pick up good amounts of fruit flavors ranging from citric to touches of plush tropical and there is a sweetness but also dryness to the beer, although I really can't say sour or funk. Just take my word that is a well-balanced beer with plenty of fruit flavors and dry/sweetness from malts and hops (and fruits?) so it's not overpowering or overpuckering one way or the other. My notes are scattered on this beer but I know I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend to anyone.","clayrock81","Apr 07, 2013"

There is bitterness up front, which comes through very strongly on the first sip. The malt backbone comes through after the initial sip, providing bready flavor. There is some of that spiciness I detected in the nose, but it is not very prominent. Some of those citrus flavors start to come through after I get used to the bitterness and I pick up that orange and lemon, but that bitter aftertaste is still strong.

The aroma is wonderfully complex... and pleasantly yeasty, of course. On one hand, I can pick up very sweet, candied phenols, and on the other, there is very sour and tart stuff in there as well. Apples and bananas come to mind first and foremost. The taste has a smack of sweetness and farmhouse funk, but in a flash that all gives way to a sour bitterness. There must have been a more than average amount of hops used here, for the style. It has a bit of a champagne-like character, being somewhat crisp, dry and metallic.

Aroma of light bready malt, lemon, slight saison funk. Nice wheat and lemon start, with bready malt and light fruit developing. Finish is hop bitterness with funky saison yeast lingering. This starts off tasting like a weizen, but quickly develops more sour, complex citrus leaning saison flavors. A nice flavor progression. Light bodied but a nice sharp mouth feel from the active carbonation. Very refreshing and pleasant to drink. Another great Pretty Things ale.","LiquidAmber","Mar 18, 2012"

The flavor is grainy and too dry. Excessive bitterness for the flavor, as there's not much there to back it up. Mildly tannic and thin. Good carbonation. Decent, but not something I'd go back to.

Huge coriander presence in the nose, not much in the way of fruity esters, some spicy hops in back end. Taste is very, very coriander/peppery, out of balance for style, even after lengthy warming the lemony fruit esters were subsumed by coriander presence, healthy dose of belgian yeast. Mouthfeel about right, on the light side of medium, pretty good effervescence, dry finish. Need to dial the coriander notes back. Not real drinkable, just to frickin' peppery IMHO.","jdense","Oct 09, 2011"

The style is so difficult to nail down though because it varies so much. This on reminds me more of the St. Feuillien as I sip further the hop does start to give way to the barnyard covered in citrus that I do love so much. A very tasty one when I want a little more hops.

3.59,-11.1,3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a murky yellow into the glass with very little white head that dies down quickly. Little lacing left on the glass while I drank the beer. Really love the smell of this beer and that was the standout here for me. Primarily a funky barnyard sourness along with a little bit of lemony sweetness. Taste was big on hop bitterness with a little bit of the citrus from the smell at the end. I was really looking for a little more of the smell in the taste but felt the hoppiness kind of overtook everything else (granted, I am not a big hop head). Mouthfeel was nice but nothing to write home about, decent prickly carbonation and pretty smooth. My girlfriend found it ""a little like a hoppy Allagash White," I kind of agree with her. She put a lemon in her glass. I did not. Overall not all that bad but just not quite what I was looking for here. I think there is more going on with this beer that I just wasn't able to pick up because of the big hoppy bitterness.","isitsavage","Sep 27, 2011"

3.63,-10.1,4,3.5,4,3.5,3,"Fragrant, heady light golden beer. Quite a slash of hops. Very appealing at first sip but in the end the bitterness is more than the delicate flavors can sustain. Pleasant citrus taste and acidity with an earthy nose. Fresh cut apple and a touch of something like artichoke. Toasted brioche and white grapes. Nice head in the tulip glass but the carbonation fades before two people can share the 22-ouncer. I will still buy whatever these people concoct, though so far this is my least favorite.","mactrail","Sep 26, 2011"
3.9,-3.5,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Overall: Thanks much to Jlindros for this bottle. I'd had this once before in a trade, though there was no date on that bottle, and I was greatly disappointed by it. This, on the other hand, is quite nice. I'm typically not a huge fan of American-style saisons (tons of American hops or high levels of bitterness, for example), preferring the more earthy, funky, and fruity versions. This, however, is pretty tasty. The lemon curd flavors, nice hint of malt, and somewhat herbal, leafy hops meld well together. I have no idea what this costs (as it's not available here), but if it went for around 7-8 dollars I could see myself picking up a few bombers of this for warm weather sipping.","BedetheVenerable","Sep 25, 2011"
3.62,-10.4,4,4.5,3,4,3.5,"Pours a vibrant, hazy, pale straw color with a thin layer of bubbly, pure-white head. The head dissipates very quickly, and leaves tiny batches of wet lacing behind. It smells of funky yeast, straw, hay, freshly-cut grass, pepper, and light citrus notes. It tastes very similar, beginning with the straw, grass, and citrus (lemon, orange) notes, moving into a funky, yeast flavor, and finishing with the peppery hops. There seems, however, to be a slightly metallic, medicinal flavor that predominates the finish and leaves an odd taste in the mouth. Mouthfeel is very crisp and finishes cleanly. Overall, a good saison save for the odd flavor towards the end.","eclipse54","Sep 25, 2011"
4.42,9.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"O- This is a very enjoyable Saison and I would definitely seek it out again. The pepper is a little bit over powering, I feel that this could be even better if there was not so much pepper. I can't wait to have more.","larryi86","Sep 21, 2011"
4.54,12.4,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"The nose is just splendid. Basil, thyme, citrus, and an Indian summer grassiness that morphs as you drink. Certainly unique, and in my opinion, exceptionally robust. Once you take a drink, you'll notice a bit less bubbles than you expected, but give it a swish and I guaran-dang-tee you'll enjoy how this one excites palate. Give it a chew, why don't you? The taste is fantastic, just as your nose hinted. You've got some earthiness, but mostly a bright citrus taste that's just ready to burst.

A wonderful, pronounced yeasty aroma. There’s a bit of a spicy bite in the taste. A hoppy saison, but dramatically different from the only other hoppy saison I’ve tried. There’s a dry finish to this beer, distinct and bold. Going out on a limb here but I think I catch some coriander as well? Thick mouthfeel.

Tastes more lively, although the thickish body seems to bog things down a bit. The hop bitterness seems to cut through the body more effectively than the spices (cloves, allspice, white pepper) or tanginess (sweetened lemon, yeast, a vague sour presence). Modest funkiness develops as it warms. I’d love to see some more of the earthy and spicy notes coaxed out of this.

3.57,-11.6,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Bomber poured into my Saison Dupont glass. Opaque straw color - almost milky - with a coif of white foam that settles back into more of a combover. Aroma is bright, alternatingly fruity and musty. Citrus peel and soggy hay, candied orange and cobwebs, honey, fresh laundry. The flavor seems restrained at first, like there's something vivid struggling to get out, but it's truncated by a mineral character that approaches astringency. Still, a mild unripe mango fruitiness is detectable along with some dry pale malts and leafy noble hops with a clean peppery finish. I was hoping this would come out of its shell with warmth but no such luck. The only development I get is a more lingering astringency and a little more sweetness. Palate is also a bit off. The carbonation is inappropriately low, giving this beer a soft but unsatisfying mouthfeel. Not bad but I'd say this needs some fine-tuning.","illidurit","Aug 21, 2011"
3.92,-3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"A good non-Belgian saison, but far from my favourite. It feels like it paints the broad strokes of the style well, but misses the little details.

A generous three finger head; white and frothy and left complex lacing just above the finish. The appearance was really quite sublime. The aroma was complex. Yeasty with peppery phenols, slight malt and a whiff of orange peels. Taste was subtly citric with medium spice and bitterness. Hops were clean/crisp and the malts toasty. Felt creamy with a medium body, yet very drinkable. This brew was enjoyed on a roof-deck during a beautiful 70°, sunny afternoon and is perfect for such an occasion.","infinitejester","May 24, 2011"

It was mostly a little funky with some wheat and some citrus in there perhaps. The taste was kind of light to me as well. I felt like I wasn't able to pull anything from this brew. There were some flavors that resembled the style well. I did pick up the farmhouse taste with some wheat and citrus in there with just a bit of tartiness. The mouthfeel was good I thought.

Taste is dominated by vinegar like, sour and maybe unripe honeydew. Really not very pleasing. I recognize an American interpretation of a saison should have a bit of funk but I doubt this is the taste they were going for. Should this beer have fallen apart in 1.5 years? Even at only 6.4% abv, this should have held up. I just want to move on and get this taste out of my mouth. A friend shared this with me, it had a $1.49 sticker on it, maybe it was marked down because of its age?","KickbacksSteve","Apr 09, 2011"

Instantly got a lot of aroma just from cracking the cap. Smell is very spicy and zesty. Coriander, Belgian yeast and banana. A faint amount of a hoppy citrus zest. For the lack of hops in the nose there is a lot going on here. The bitterness and dryness is very present. A dirty, extremely astringent hop character is very present with a fierce lemon zest. The Belgian yeast characteristics are there at first but are taken over by the bitter hop assault. Almost sour. Not sure how to interpret this one.","DrinkingDrake","Apr 02, 2011"

I also get a bit of bread and hoppiness with nice yeast scents. Taste is initially hoppy, quickly followed by some funk and delicious spiciness. This is a very good example of a saison if you ask me. There is a bit of lemon and citrus along with a lot of hoppiness. Very tasty brew. Mouthfeel is nice and dry...refreshing. Overall, my first impression of Pretty Things is a good one.

Taste is quite enjoyable with nice notes of Belgian-style malt with some light fruity ester and some residual sugar. Body is full with a somewhat oily texture and good carbonation.

4.27,5.7,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours orange, cloudy, and piled high with tight and retentive off-white head that leaves little patches of lace on the glass. Delicate aroma of lemon, green apple, orange, flowers, soda crackers, and phenols. Mildly tart lemon flavour, very dry, some clovey or peppery spice notes, finishes with a very earthy and medicinal sort of bitterness. Light bodied with fine, spritzy carbonation.

Taste has some more hops to it than I expected--a nice bitter kick to this one, even after that Surly Abrasive I had tonight. A bit of lemon to it, but definitely yeasty at the start, malty on the finish with some lingering bitterness. Light feel, nicely carbonated, dry finish. Good drinkability, not my favorite saison, but definitely one I was glad to try. I guess Pretty Things makes some legit stuff.","LordAdmNelson","May 29, 2010"
4.14,2.5,3,4,4.5,4,4,"Served in a flute with my brunch at Lord Hobo. The beer pours a lovely color, halfway in between bright gold and orange. The head and lacing are alright, but ultimately disappointing, especially given wonderful prior experiences in this regard with bottles of Jack. The nose is a blend of the typical yeast spiciness that I expect from any saison worth its salt and some citrus hop aromas (think orange/lemon). The taste largely mirrors the nose, with the addition of a noticeable amount of pale malt sweetness. The carbonation is high, which serves the brief crack of hop bitterness that hits mid palate well, but a by product of the aforementioned sweetness is that the body is a little rich for my liking for a saison. Ultimately a great beer, and I love the added american hop flavor blending with a traditional saison.","axeman9182","May 29, 2010"

The malts are in the aroma in a limited fashion but it seemed to come across as more ""beery"" to me. There is a creamy, medium texture with a nice enough wheat and yeasty taste.

Scent is of pale malts, bready, wheaty and grainy backed by a bit of orange rind, spice and sweetnes. Taste again begins with the pale malts, grainy, earthy quality to them. The orange rind is more pronounced than the nose dictates, moderate spicyness, lacking any notable herbal, floral or yeasty tastes i expect from the style. Light bodied, adequately carbonated, very dry from start to finnish. Decent saison, but one that did not live up to my expectations from the style, overly mild and dry for my liking.","rfgetz","Mar 29, 2010"

It's dry and crackery on the palate, spritzy, medium-bodied. Flavors of white pepper, lemon zest and light citrusy hops lend complexity. Medium-light in body with a pleasantly dry finish, I find myself wishing there was a bit more funk to this, but it's a solid and very enjoyable saison nonetheless.","largadeer","Mar 23, 2010"

The flavor is also quite sweet with plenty of floral, bready and grassy notes. Also detecting some spice and a definite tang from the yeast. Pretty firm bitterness for a saison. A very tasty brew with a nice long finish that is sweet, yet dry. Mouthfeel is very good with a medium body and the previously mentioned finish. Very drinkable and an interesting take on the style.

Faint bubblegum in the aroma, mild esters, very similar to Hennepin (unfortunately >2x the price). A very good saison, again like Hennepin but with a little extra hops punch.

The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a carbonation level that is way too high. So high, in fact, that it really gets in the way of the nuances that I'm sure are hiding in the taste, and caries them away into oblivion.

Citrus character is noticeable, lending a juiciness to the palate that works very well with everything else that's going on. Phenols appear towards the finish, one that's a combination of sweet and drying. Delicate floral and citrus flavors linger on the finish, with a touch of honey. The combination of the medium body and the high carbonation is enjoyable.

A typical pour, nothing too vigorous: but man, that's quite a head on this beer: huge, foamy, four fingers high, just off-white with an egg white density on top and big loose bubbles below; lots of thick lacing. The smell is classic saison: a little funk, lemon zest, wet tree bark, damp wool, pan drippings, soap. The taste comes on with some mild sweetness, moving through to some sour notes like wood sorrel, then a pleasant grain flavor that grows increasingly malty, ending with a dry bitter finish reminiscent of tangelo, plus a lot of white pepper. It's perhaps more highly hopped than the classic saison, but for a ""saison Americain," as the folks at Pretty Things call it, it's spot-on. It's highly carbonated, which keeps it nice and lively in the mouth, clean and crisp on the palate -- really excellent. I wish I'd gotten a second bottle, as this one is going to disappear all too soon. A really fine beer.","gory4d","Nov 20, 2009"

Light to medium in body with moderate carbonation. Unlike many farmhouse ales I've had.

Color is a beautiful hazed golden color matched with a large white heading that has some staying power. The champagne yeast is evident in the nose, along with some fresh grains and mango. A whole array of tropical fruits hit the palate (think pineapple, guava etc.) first, followed by some peppery notes. Hops intermingle with the champagne yeast to give this beer is nice dryness in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium, prickly and really complex. Drinking this by itself is great, but pairing it with food is a sheer delight. Since this beer has been released, it has been a go to for me, and remains my favorite from the Pretty Things line. Some have complained that the quality of the newer batches has declined, but I have to say that I haven't noticed much of a difference.

The citric quality grows into a metallic spine, then opens into something more complex... The beer is clean in the mouth, light to medium in body... It finishes with a slight caramel creaminesss that is overrun by plenty of bitter hoppiness and yeasty funk. The hop lingers in the jowls below my tongue, fitting. Zest is still apt, and I am pleased...One of the better farmhouse beers I've tried in some time.

The aroma consists of spice, banana, and Belgian yeast. A good dose of floral hops and pear. An enjoyable nose, light and fresh. Taste starts off with light fruits; white grapes, green apple, and pear. Midway the dry hops emerge which clearly help identify this beer as an ""American"" saison. The spices linger in the aftertaste with coriander and dry grass. Soft and pillowy feel in the mouth with a strong sting from the carbonation. I hate to admit it, but I pounded this beer. My first from this brewery/project, but I picked up the Baby Tree as well that I look forward to trying.

Poured a hazy golden-orange with a dense, bright white three inch head; excellent retention. Delicate, thin cloud-like patches of lacing coated the sides of the glass as the cap slowly receded. Nose reveals coriander, lemon zest and belgian yeast. Taste is consistent with nose. Some citric acid comes out, as well as some candi sugar - a very nice balance of flavors, but missing some of the characteristic funkiness associated with the style. Mouthfeel falls between light- and medium-bodied with a consistent background effervescence and some astringency detectable around the sides of the cheek. Great farmhouse. Easy drinking, flavorful and all at a 6.4% abv. A bargain to boot at $5.99. Can't wait to try Pretty Things' Quad & Brown.","Jwale73","May 03, 2009"

White pepper, coriander, apricots, and a bit of mustiness all come together in the nose. The flavor is biscuity up front, toast and yeast, a bit of orange rind, and a subtle mustiness. The mouthfeel isn't as dry as most saisons but it does have a sharp carbonation that allows the flavor to cut across he palate. This is a very good saison especially for a new brewery.

Pepper, floral hops, more grapefruit and sweet malts in the taste area. Finishes crisply dry and with more pepper and citric hops finishing the deal. Subtly complex and thoroughly enjoyable.

Hoppy aroma of citrus and peaches, definitely some grapefruit. From the smell I expected more hops in the taste but was happy to note more malt than hops. Nonetheless it had a bitter tilt that added some spice. Bananas in the background, both in aroma and taste. Lightly carbonated; overall a bit thin in the body. Compared to other saisons like Hennepin and Saison Dupont, this is rather a lightweight. But all in all, rather refreshing and worth a second try.","gfreed","Mar 07, 2009"

The hops are fresh and delicious, providing a wonderful compliment to the crisp saison tang. A refreshing beverage to say the least, and an amazing first offering from Pretty Things and Dann Paquette. If this beer was white wine, it would easily fetch upwards of $100 a bottle. Yes, it's of that caliber. On a separate note, I want to know where Dann gets his hops; these are unreal.","BasementDweller","Dec 29, 2008"
4.07,0.7,4,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,"Pours a nice orange hazy body and bubbly white head. Smells of fresh hop flowers that you just crushed between your fingers to smell, fresh orange peel, and some citrus zest. Taste: hmmmm a bit bitter from the hops, the bitterness dominates the pallet at first, followed by the smooth sweet malt. Some hints of fruit in the middle followed by a spicy finish. This beer has a lot of flavors battling it out, maybe some age will mellow them out and they will play nicely. Although the more I drink the less I notice the battle of flavors. All in all, a hint more balance would be nice (again, maybe aging). Mouth feel has lots of good carbonation that evaporates the beer on your tongue, but the beer has a dense unfiltered characteristic. That may sound contradictory, but true. As for drinkability the first bottle is great, but it's a big beer, heavy beer, so full of flavor that I would not say it's a session beer. Overall a great beer, as the bottle says this beer is an American saison due to it's much more flavorful characteristics from the Belgian style. If the brewer does a higher alcohol version we might have an imperial saison on our hands. Now start bottling shaherizad!!! (and send it to Baltimore).","danadeny","Dec 27, 2008"
