Light body, you get little bits of the herbs and spices so it's not over seasoned (I guess you can say lol) it has more of a wheat beer finish. In all, it's a chill session saison that you can totally eat dinner with (I suggest apricot baked chicken on a bed Orzo Pasta!)","Los13","Dec 11, 2014"

In tandem w/the lemon this is a perfect match for a few chicken skewers, on a bed of spinach with a crumble of blue cheese. If you don't have the facilities to do this yourself, go straight to your friendly local & demand they support your research & get on it. Ever had a lemon-pepper chicken dish? Or used a lemon-pepper seasoning in a salad? Well here's your old friend...in a glass. A word to the wise is sufficient.

3.95,11.6,3.75,4.25,3.75,4,4,"Poured a cloudy golden color with a thin ring of white lacing. Nice, though a bit more head would be better, but it looks like a quite nice saison. Scents of sour funk, barnyard-like mostly, with a tang of lemon, undertones of pepper spiciness and hints of floral and herbal hops. A good, funky, lemon-rich, spicy aroma, leaning towards the funky citrus side of the saison spectrum and not the sweet fruity side. Flavor begins with a large amount of of lemon zest, moving into a moderate peppery spiciness, further lemon zest and some moderate hoppy bitterness, mostly floral. A bit high on bitterness for a saison. Moderate levels of dry, grainy malt appear in the middle. Finish is dry with moderate-high hop bitterness, lemon zest and slight white pepper. Aftertaste is grainy and dry with notes of floral hops and white pepper. A good overall flavor profile, perhaps a bit high in hop bitterness for a saison, but with a nice, traditional white pepper and lemon zest character. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium-high carbonation and a drying feel. A good, true to style, classic saison feel, very well done. Overall this is a pretty good saison that has a fantastic aroma, a good, though slightly too hoppy flavor and an excellent mouthfeel. Good, but not the best American saison, still quite nice.","Auraan","Jun 08, 2014"

This beer is everything a saison should be. Has a very pleasant hop herbal on the nose and a bit of spice in the drink. As you drink you will find a delightful tartness to offer just a slight bit of pucker. Has plenty of juicy lemon on the palate and a crisp off dry finish.","utopiajane","Mar 25, 2014"

It is an interesting, flavorful, moderately bitter saison with lots of citrus, making it suitable for the spring, summer, and lots of cuisine. However, my only complaint with this beer is that it tires the palate, and not because it is overly heavy or too hoppy, but because it should be dialed down a few more notches. I liked Classique a lot (which I reviewed but a few days ago) because it was SO basic and well executed. I find this to be "reaching" so to speak...Nonetheless, great well crafted beer!","MusicaleMike","Feb 17, 2014"

Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon zest, orange zest, pear, coriander, clove, pepper, ginger, wheat, bread, floral, grass, herbal, and yeast earthiness. very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of yeast ester, spice, and moderate malt notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon zest, orange zest, pear, coriander, clove, pepper, ginger, wheat, bread, floral, grass, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of lemon, pear, coriander, clove, pepper, cracker, bread, floral, grass, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, spice, and moderate malt flavors; with great flavor robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice session saison style. Nice complexity, balance, and robustness of yeast, spice, and moderate malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink.

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, banana, fruit, sugar, banana runts, wheat, and bubblegum. The flavor was of sweet malt, wheat, bubblegum, fruit, spice, and subtle banana. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The banana runt aspect on the aroma really took this one to the next level as it was definitely unexpected and took me back to my favorite candy growing up and still is the only candy that I eat at all even today. This brought a huge level of complexity to the game and made it quite easy to get close to this beer over and over again. I really went into this one not expecting much at all, but was pleasantly surprised with it in both the flavor and aroma. Definitely glad I got the chance to try this one and suggest that you do the same at least once yourself.","thagr81us","Jun 15, 2013"

Finally, it simply fell like a souffle when the oven door is banged shut. Doing that to a souffle disturbs me, but the gorgeous lacing that this left behind did wonders for my attitude. Color was a cloudy golden-yellow and i must have disturbed the lees as it was initially pouring very clear. I am glad that the yeast is back in suspension as that is where the flavor is derived and who ever heard of filtering a Saison? Nose on this was full-on lemon zest, leading me to wonder what spices were used. I'd bet that coriander was one of them. Mouthfeel seemed to be on the thin side, tending to watery. Is that a characteistic of the style, I wonder? The taste was still very lemony, but now the black pepper phenols were really beginning to assert themselves. I spoke, in my previous review of Ithaca's Ground Break, of pairing a Saison with grilled fish, like bass. This beer would also work well, but as a second choice. I liked it, but not as much as the previous one. Finish was dry and lemon-peppery and a nice representation of the style as I understand it. Worth a go!","woodychandler","Jun 07, 2013"

The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, this saison just didn't work.

I got a lot of citrus fruit, spicy pepper, mango, guava tropical notes with a bready yeast appreciation that kept the beer flowing on the palate. Light herbal grassiness is I'm guessing the hop presence in this beer known as Swing Session Saison. I wish more beers out there had this much complexity in an under 5% alcohol by volume. Medium to light bodied carried by lively carbonation spices tend to sit on the palate between sips, but this was pure session ale.

It smells of funky straw and lemon grains with touches of banana and cloves with just a hint of uncharacterized spice in the nose. The yeast esters are very big and tangible on the nose, almost dripping off, which is lovely in a 4.5% beer. The overall mélange of smells does give a slightly skunked smell, but I think that is more from all of the spices and yeast esters mixing together into a strange potpourri, and less from light exposure. On the tongue, the beer tastes of grassy bitters, sweet spices, and funky yeast character that moves from bitter to sweet, to acidic, and leaves a nice bit of neutralizing saliva behind. In flavors, the beer begins with funky bitter grass, which opens into lovely banana esters with touches of cloves and some coriander as well. Lemon citrus runs on the lesser side of the flavors, and melds with some of the breadier characteristics of the yeast and the light clean malt flavors. The finish is big with coriander spice, slight orange peel, and some funky banana/clove esters, and the aftertaste continues this with the addition of slightly medicinal, grassy bitters that tingle on the tongue. Judging by the taste, I would not say this beer is 4.5% ABV. In the mouth, the beer feels medium to medium-light in body with a big fluffy carbonation that provides some tongue scrubbing to keep the sweeter yeast and spice characteristics from overpowering the bitters. The mouth is left slightly chalky and tingling with some saliva on the sides of the tongue. Overall, this is a great normal saison, and the fact that it is 4.5% and fully sessionable makes it all the better. Its flavor profile slightly reminded me of a less coriander-heavy Hennepin from Brewery Ommegang. It was phenomenally full of flavor, and comparable to my personal favorite session saison, Notch Sasion. My one complaint with this beer is that, in the belly, it seems to carry a little bit more weight than I normally like from a 4.5% beer, but it is not to such a degree that it ruins this beer. This beer is good, and great for a long drinking night. Try it.","Maxwell","Apr 16, 2013"

3.72,5.1,3.75,3.5,3.75,4,3.75,"Overall: Nice to see a new "Session" beer that isn't an IPA, although it is bitter enough. This is a very nice, crisply refreshing Spring seasonal. However, I still prefer Victory's Helios.","bsp77","Mar 10, 2013"

4.06,14.7,3.5,4.25,4,4.25,4,"Slightly hazed sunny gold topped with a small, pure-white head. Fresh herbal, lemon, and spice aromas...basil, hay, dank, spices, flowers, and a melon sweetness. Peppery, yeasty flavor with continued citrus rind and more grassy/earthiness from the hops. Fresh, cracker-like malts, coriander, and green herbs. Crispy clean, dry mouthfeel. Flavorful and very refreshing.","wedge","Mar 09, 2013"

3.85,8.8,4,4,3.75,4,3.75,"O - In the grand scheme of saisons, I'd say it's above average. They really hit the nail on the head, though, by brewing a light, sessionable, saison that packs a lot of flavor. I'll be getting more of this.","garuda","Mar 02, 2013"
