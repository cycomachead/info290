"Now, I need to try this fresh, at 2 yrs, and 3/4 yrs - for research's sake!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beautiful in appearance and flavor. Snappy earth flavors with spice. Cracker malt. Dry finish. If you find this, buy it."
"Homerun by Boulevard. Love this brew"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Poured in tulip glasses. So much head. Funky nose. Great yeast/wheat taste."
""
"this is hands down my favorite beer."
"Pour slow and pray for anything less than a four finger head....."

"Got to try this on draft at a local watering hole. I am not yet a big fan of Belgian style, but based on ratings I wanted to give this a shot. I have to admit, I was apprehensive given some of the descriptions of it tasking like ""funk"" or ""Band-Aid", but I enjoyed this more than expected. Pour was clean and clear with ample head; scent was ripe with that Belgian spice. Taste was malty and sweet up front, and I caught the Brett earthiness on the finish but by no means was it distressing. This was my first taste of a Brett beer, and I'll be trying more when possible. Coming from a non-saison drinker, this is a good brew."

"I have had this bottled and on tap and it is better bottled. The cork releases with a pop which gets louder as the beer ages releasing herbal and spicy hop aromas mingling with cidery, yeasty fruit aromas with a little barnyard funk that gets more pronounced as the beer ages. It pours a lively, hazy straw with a fizzy quickly dissipating, fluffy head. In older versions the head is more pillowy and persistent. Bread and biscuit malt flavors support and mellow the tart, citrusy funky, earthy saison yeast flavors. Mid-palate reveals some peach. The palate finishes dry and tart with a moderate hop accent. The Brettanomyces really shows up with a very finely bubbled, soft, moussey texture that becomes more luscious and alluring as the beer ages."

"I'm not going to write up a fancypants review. It's damn good though."
"Pour slow. Very carbonated and will have large head. Let it breathe."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- At first I found the brett aspect of this beer to be too much but as it warmed it the flavors really came together."
""
"Very carbonated long lasting head. Nice funky yeast flavor with a touch of Brett sourness at the end. Real nice Saison. I would definitely buy again."

"Looking at the good reviews that this beer gets, and being a fan of sours, it seems that I must have got a bad bottle."
""
""
""
""
"The other reviews had me optimistic about this... maybe it's a one-off, but to be honest - this beer was horrible. Something like transmission fluid with smelly socks kind of describes it. Purchased at Bev-Mo in champagne style bottle. Very expensive, very poor. Bummed.  I have always enjoyed Boulevard's brews... until now."
""
""
""
""
"O - Great beer; tons of favor, strong smell.  Not very bitter."
""
"2013 vintage. Pours a hazy gold with a huge white head. Lemon, biscuity malt, with a touch of funk on the nose. Hoppy, lemon, spice on the palate that finishes dry and slightly funky. Light bodied with great carbonation. Overall, the word that best describes this beer is complex."

"Big points for originality.  Lost points due to lack of balance.  I would consider this a Saison/IPA hybrid with slight hints of Brettanomyces.  Don't get me wrong, I love a good IPA.  I just think they over did it a little bit.  The intense bitterness and slightly tart flavors create an overwhelming flavor, in my opinion.  Nonetheless, I am enjoying it."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- plenty of Brett funk, but held back enough to balance out the fruity and earthy notes of the base saison.  I was already a fan go Tank 7, and this one was a winner with the addition of dry hopping and Brett yeast"

"Awesome beer!!"

"Overall: anyone who has a 2014, I recommend giving it another half year or so. This is the first time I tried this and I figured I should have waiting longer before opening this. Its good, but if you want solid Brett character, just wait a bit longer."
""
""
""
""
"Not gonna reiterate what everyone else has said about this beer. My first taste reminded me of the smell of my laundry detergent. I'm a fan of Boulevard, but not this beer."
""
""
""
""
"Saison Brett Pours a hazy golden color with a huge white lacing fluffy head.  There is a big bold aroma filled with flower and spice notes.  The taste is dry, very spicy, big pepper notes, flower like flavors, hints of sweetness.  Great flavors, blends together perfectly.  Overall its the best Saison I had to to date."

"Slightly hazy golden pour with a foamy two-finger white head. Nice slightly sour aroma of yeast and lemon. Really nice flavor of pepper and yeast. Can also taste a bit of biscuit and clove. Medium bodied with lots of carbonation. Finishes dry and crisp."

"This is my first experience with brett, and it is a positive one. I was worried this beer would be too funky, but it seems to keep that well in check. The brett adds some interesting flavor notes to the beer, it is earthy and funky, but in a good way. It is very drinkable for the abv, and is yet another example of why I think Boulevard is one of the few US breweries that gets the Belgian style of beers right."

"There are very few non Belgian beers that approach perfection for this style, but this one certainly does."
""
""
"O: Loved this one. This is the first saison I've reviewed (and the first I've tried in a long time), so everything was pretty much new to me."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very good twist on a Belgian style Saison. Good mix of fruit esters and spices with a nice kick of Brett funk."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Though the flavor profile is different, what stands out is the artisanal quality of this brew, worthy of the greatest Belgian examples."
""
""
""
"O: Great!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Still the best of the style I've tasted, although if aging I'd recommend no more than 6-8 months. I like this better ""fresh."""

"Poured a cloudy gold with minimal head. Caramel and dates move into flowers and pepper, with some cherry esters and a wiff of funk. Sweet with a mild tartness and some alcohol on the finish. Low hop bitterness and mild Goldings-type hop aroma. More complex and more Belgian than the Tank 7. The complexity imparted by the brett and whatever other bugs they threw in there make it a true saison."
""
""
"Wonderful sasion.Light golden yellow in color. BIG head even when poured gently it's amazing. Great aroma. Light and fruity. Wonderful summer beer. Like it more than Tankhouse 7 which is a good beer. Definetly will have to go out by some more to keep stocked away for a later date."

"Taste like very pleasing, there's the funk I was looking for in the smell. Citrus, and that taste you get in your mouth when you hit the rural, manure-plastered parts of Minnesota, but in a good way. As you have probably noticed, the 8.5% ABV is deceptive, as I am not even through two glasses yet and this review has pretty much gone pear-shaped (shout out to Paul Allen, the voice of the MN Vikings on KFAN! Shout out to The Common Man Dan Cole and Tenna-B on The Common Man Progrum. Shout out to Boulevard Brewing Company, get on that Tech N9ne beer, and soon! McThulhu goin hard on the beer review tip, watch out!)"

"Delicious farmhouse funk without too much sweetness. Bitter enough to stand up to most fooods, but light enough to enjoy at any part of the meal. Would love to get my hands on a few bottles and age them.  Deceptive ABV... Enjoying this at Dogwood Cafe in Jamaica Plain, MA before a Sox game."
""
""
""
"Still a decent amount of funk after a year of aging. Superbly creamy and medium full body. Nice touches of spice and a hint of sourness. Lots of yeasty, floral smells. Some dryness but not overly so. Smooth. Wonderful head. Just a superbly done craft beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: enjoyable beer that I think hits the style pretty well in my estimation. It has been a while since I had a Brett, and was hoping to get a bit more ""funkiness"" out of the beer, right or wrong, but it was a more standard Saison."

"O: I liked Saison-Brett but I like Tank 7 a lot better for it's more rounded nature. This is a good beer and one of the best Brett-character beers I have had. It comes off to me like a brighter Orval in many ways. I enjoyed it but there are saisons I like a lot better -- including the base beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"From a guy who doesn't like saisons too much, I'm really in love with this. The Brett is there and it really makes this beer shine. A must try beer for anyone. At all. Ever."

"peach, apricot, and some spiciness with a definite pronouncement of Bret funk. Orange, lemon-grass, and a nice hay flavor that finishes with a crisp bitterness. Medium bodied in a well balanced beer. The only complaints: a tad lighter in body and a lot more brett character in the flavor profile."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Fantastic example of a Bretted saison, could literally drink this every day. The extra time in the cellar definitely brought this one even more in my wheelhouse, love what the brett did since last fall."
""
""
""
"To me this is almost as perfect as a Saison can get. It looks amazing in a tulip glass, the colour, the head. It hits you first on the nose with that beautiful sweet funky brett. Your first sip has a little bit of bite from the carbonation, almost like champagne. For me the real winning part of this beer is the taste and the mouthfeel. It has a little bit of a pepper kick which to me is my favorite part of a Saison. The mouthfeel starts off with a bit of sharp carbonation bite but then as you let the beer sit it smooths out so much. Silky, funky, and sweet. On the finish, you notice more of the hops and dryness. I love this one with about a yr on it, but it has always been amazing. Changing ownership hasn't done a thing in my opinion, aside from make it more available and maybe lower the price? Love it!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Overall this was a great saison a must get."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The brett was much more pronounced in this bottle then the first one I had. It may have something to do with it being left outside all day in a cooler on a 85 degree day but I have to say that I like more then the first time around."
""
""
""
""
"O: judging by my look and mouth feel ratings, this beer was obviously made well, the flavors just didn't quite work for me and perhaps it needs some time to mature."

"O: Solid Brett forward saison. Nice balance of zesty yeast phenols, lemony hops and Brett finish. Has more heft than I'm used to in a saison but still drinks fairly easy."

"o: Certainly an outstanding saison, in the BA top 250 for good reason., in fact so tasty I had to force myself not to drink it all in one half hour session. Generally I am not a fan of Bretts, they can be too funky for my taste, but this is the second one I really enjoyed."
""
"Cork comes out readily with an epic pop, flying a good ten feet into the air, and my hand is quickly soaked in gushing foam. Not much is lost though, and pouring results in a predictably massive, airy head of persistent sea foam that extends an inch or more above the rim of the glass. Things eventually settle down to reveal a hazy orange body. The aroma is fresh and elegant rather than anything I would describe as ""funky""...very Orval-like in its flowery nature, along with pear and hay. Big, flowery Brett, some pale malt sweetness, grass, orange peel, spicy yeast, and pomaceous fruit juices in the flavor. Medium-plus bodied, creamy, yet pretty drying. I wish it was a little lighter, something in the 6% ABV range, but still a tasty treat. I'll probably snag a bottle of this year's batch to try it fresh for comparison."

"Overall: Because of the 8.5 Abv I couldn't drink it all day...Or could I? Nicely done."
"O: So glad I picked this one up. Probably won't be able to sit on one again for long since I love this beer young with all of its horsey qualities but age has done wonders for this. Kudos to Boulevard for making a beer that is exceptional both young and old but that are such different beers to drink. Excellent."

"Feel is refreshing and semi dry with a crisp finish"
""
"Against Tank 7, I'm not sure which I prefer, but this is more refreshing and light of a brew on the flavor."
""
""
""
""
"O: At first, between the giant head and the huge amount of funk, I wasn't impressed. Halfway through the bottle, this beer is exploding with flavor. I'd have to be in the mood for it, but I'd buy it again. Boulevard never lets me down."
""

"Overall- had big expectations of this beer but this is some angry angry brett. I have no idea why this needed to be an 8.5 percent beer but the alcohol is way over the top, solvent, and ruinous. Wouldn't even say it is sharp or acidic or really even very sour. It has none of the classic brett characters except a few notes I picked up in aroma. Undrinkable. I love Bouevard, Tank 7, and sour saisons but this is not good. Maybe I kept it too long, but it is vintage-dated and says ""best by 2-2014"". If others are having positive experiences with this beer than I suppose it is intended to be enjoyed fresh."

"This is a truly outstanding beer, at the top end for the style.  One that should be on your buy list every year."
""

"O: I love Tank 7 and I love this. If I have to nitpick (and I always have to, every single time) it's that the complexity is a bit concealed. Luckily, discovering all of its nuances is such an enjoyable experience. I'll definitely have to get more next year!"

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled in 3/2013. Pours moderately hazy/cloudy bright golden amber color with a 2-3 finger foamy and rocky white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty foamy lacing clings around the glass, with plenty of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big pineapple, pear, lemon zest, orange zest, apple, hay, floral, grass, pepper, light bread, light must, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity brett, earthy yeast, and moderate malt notes; with good strength. Taste of pineapple, lemon zest, orange zest, pear, apple, pepper, clove, hay, grass, floral, light bread, light must, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of pineapple, bright citrus, pepper, clove, bread, hay, grass, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and balance of bright citrus/tropical brett flavors with fruity/spicy yeast and moderate malt balance; with a great malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. High carbonation and medium bodied; with a very crisp, smooth, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an incredible saison! All around amazing balance and complexity of brett/yeast and moderate malt flavors; and super smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. An extremely delicious offering."

"Without a doubt, the  best beer that Boulevard makes (although BBQ and Rye on Rye are close). I look forward to this release each year, and often buy a whole case. Only the original classic from Dupont would be dearer to me, as this is one of my favorite styles in the world. For those that cannot find Saison-Brett, the year-long release, Tank 7, is a good substitute."
""
""
""
""
"O: an enjoyable beer overall. I wish the flavor matched the nose's complexity and it had a bit more carbonation, but it's still quite good."
""
"Overall a spectacular offering from Boulevard. I'd drink this 5 days out of the week if it were available. Just a superbly done beer."

"O - I'm slowly becoming a huge fan of Boulevard. This style is something new to me, but I can see why it is so highly sought after. There is no monotony here. They attempted to create a beer that was reminiscent of the two styles and they hit the bullseye! I will look forward to this each year from here on out."

"Verdict: A nice American take on the Saison style, and a good use of brett. It's simple and straightforward, but refreshing and easy to drink and one I certainly enjoy each year. Definitely worth checking out for anyone who loves Belgian style beers or any beer with Brett."
""
""
"I really enjoyed drinking this beer. It's a perfect hot summer brew-day beer.. it's like a lawnmower beer on steroids. I honestly think this will get even better after a year, as more of the Brett notes would be expected to come out, which would make this beer taste even more complex and interesting. Nice work, Boulevard. Glad I have one more bottle to see how it does in another year."
""
""
""
""
"This beer is so refreshing that I am glad I did not cellar it and wait. Here in the last throes of Summer, on a bright and warm day, this kind of brew really takes the cake."
""
"Nothing uber complex or out there, but rock solid how it should be. Up at the top of the American versions of the style that I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer sets the standard for saisons with brett in them in my opinion. Beautiful saison flavors and aromas that are enhanced by the presence of brett but not overwhelmed by it. Easy to drink with the slightly heavier than normal ABV for the style very well hidden."
""
""
"The feel and taste were driven by an acidic and phenolic tone. It's was almost like a cider in the natural earthy sweetness of Apple's and then a clovey, yeasty underpinning. Not really vinegar, per se, there's medicinal taste that detracts from the overall experience."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: The saison brett is earthy and grounded yet light and breezy. At 8.5%, this is something to save for special occasions, just like I saved it for my day off so I can review it while I'm sitting around listening to Bill Frisell. And it turned out to be a great combination."
""
""
"A fantastic example of a true to form Saison; its refreshing, spicy and funky with a strong, but well integrated Brettanomyces presence. I really like this Saison, but it doesn't really offer any surprises to the seasoned Saison drinker. Very well executed. Highly recommended."

"Aroma of Brett, barnyard, straw, combined with citrus notes. Pours a hazzy bright yellow with a foamy, mostly lasting, white head and minimal lacing. The taste is Saison crisp meets Brett funck. Citrus, funk, grain, and hints of sourness and pepper. Dry, crisp finish. Medium-light body with crisp carbonatin. Overall, this beer is a winner! Crisp and dry meld with funk to produce a very refreshing brew. Will drink again."

"Overall: I liked the Logsdon version a bit more, due to the increased fruity / citrus character I found within it. The Brett character is certainly subtle, but takes precedence over the Saison qualities. Would try again, often."

"I didn't expect to get this beer during this visit, but I'm not one to argue. It pours a partly-cloudy golden-brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises orange zest, cracked wheat, coriander, light black pepper, mild Brett, and a vague sense of banana peel in the background. The taste brings in more of the same, the Brett mixing with the wheat, citrus, and spices to form a very pleasant sweetness with a swirl of spices. A pall of Belgian-style yeast hangs in the air, intermingling cooperatively at times with everything else. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation, a smooth feel, and a drying finish. Overall, a damn fine saison, one that uses the Brett to an immense benefit, rather than overdoing it and turning things into a damn Brett-bomb. This is some tasty-ass shit right here."

"D: This was a great saison with perfect scent and very nice refreshing taste. The body was solid also, and the finish was smooth. The alcohol was well hidden, so it was easy to drink. Built for aging, but also great fresh. This was an impressive brew, and a real treat to drink on a warm summer evening."

"Pours a hazy golden color with a very thick foamy head.  Head retention is high.  Lacing is excellent.  Very high carbonation.  Has that typical funky Brett aroma.  I can also detect lemon and banana.  Very bready, malty taste up front with strong Brett funk and more of a banana type aftertaste.  There is some spiciness and very slight tartness at the end.  Good beer, but I do favor other saisons over this."

"T: Everything in here just works. Opens with some wet hay, faint wheat, buttery smooth malt and a drawl of funk across the palate. Some grass and pepper hit near the finish and it ends on a dry, peppery hop note that lingers on the tongue. Faint lemon zest, underripe pear and just a touch of booze. Usually I'm not a fan of saisons with ABVs this high, but this is money."

"When it first opens a rush of floral notes hits you. The eggshell white head about 2.5"" thick. Lots and lots of carbonationation. It was like looking at a champagne glass. Very light straw color like SRM 1. Citrus and floral notes followed earthy notes. Stronger than the Tank 7 and can pick up on the Brett yeast. Medium body followed with light lacing. So many flavors jump out like pineapple, lemon, grass and white peach. I am so glad I waited until the release of the 2013 to drink the 2012. Boulevard really out did themselves this time, may need to get a second bottle of the 2013 to age as well."

"O - Super beer to sip and enjoy all the flavors that come through and one of the very best of the Farmhouse styles of beer you will every taste ( at least from what I have tasted and read on the style) Highly recommended if you are a fan of this style and a benchmark of American brewed interpretation of the Belgium Farmhouse style."
""
"Overall: I think this is a very good saison. According to Boulevards website it is a take off of their tank 7 just hopped up and fermented with a certain type of yeast. I don’t particularly like farmhouse/saisons but this one is good. I think I will buy more and let it age."

""

"Overall, an amazing Saison. Not just a great showcase of what brettanomyces can do, but an incredible balance and blend of ingredients by the brewer. The complexity is incredible, and all the flavors perform perfectly. I can not recommend this one enough, about the best Saison most states have the honor of receiving."
""

"Taste starts out with a light citrus flavor and builds upon a layer of funk, neither of which is overpowering but nicely balanced, candied sugar adds a touch of sweetness, hop presence is non-existent, carbonation is very light, active and explode in the mouth much like a champagne, finishes slightly dry, alcohol is very well hidden, I would think this closer to a 5% beer except I'm starting to feel it on an empty stomach."

"batch 2012-2. took a bit of time to pour an almost full glass - 4 finger plus off-white frothy & tight bubble head, with soap-like clumps of lacing. hazy straw color w. suspended yeast. smell is tart apple skin and white pepper. taste is a bit restrained - definitely has room for more funk. taste is smooth, crisp pepper spice, w. bit of a green apple/citrus, w. woody/earthy quality. finishes wicked dry."

"Wow, I was expecting good things from this one and it certainly delivered. A funk-lover's wet dream in beer form. Despite the unadulterated amounts of funk, it never seems too harsh or too out of balance thanks to the numerous other flavor contributors. All-in-all, a very nicely crafted and well put together beer. Bravo."

"The beer pours with a very aggressive and massive head which has me thinking that the brett has been busy in this beer. The head is slightly off white and made up of a gradient of bubbles going from small to large and creating a creamy crown that stretches above the lip of the glass. The head also takes forever to calm down in the glass, which makes drinking the beer a bit difficult. The head leaves a lacing of large soapy bubbles on the sides of the glass, leaving a roadway of lacing moving across the glass. In color, the beer pours a pale golden yellow to straw yellow with a maelstrom of bubbles whirling around and feeding the massive head. The beer’s body actually looks stunningly clean and clear, with only the slightest hint of a yeast haze. On the nose, the beer smells of hay and sweet funk with bits of pineapple citrus and slight sweaty horse. This beer smells bretty and beautiful with nice grassy spice notes and hay-like character. On the tongue, the beer tastes of spicy funk and bitter, chalky grass with bites of acidic citrus. The flavors begin as spicy malt, moving quickly into grassy bitter notes with splashes of funky pineapple with touches of chalky bitter flavors and big hay-like hops. A slight sweet caramel malt sits beneath everything, and the finish alcoholic pineapple across the palate. The aftertaste rings with slight citrus funk and touches of hay. In the mouth the beer feels medium in body with some thickening of the palate. The carbonation is rich and creamy on the tongue and helps to keep the sweet funk in check. The mouth is left with acid-neutralizing spittle swimming on the tongue and a slight dryness from the grassy bitters. Overall, this is a lovely, funky, complex saison with some nice weird characters. The alcoholic finish is the only complaint I have with this beer. This is a superb saison."
""
"O - Hoppy and Brett on a great saison, Terrific beer."
"Overall- Incredible smell and look to this beer, but unfortunately I wanted a slightly more tartness to it and a bit more brett character to it. I will have no problem finishing this bottle though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - The best of the best when it comes to this style. Saison qualities with the Brett funkyness makes for a great beer."
""
""
"Nice Saison. Hoppier than most classics for the style, but still has many of the other components that put it right in the wheelhouse of the genre. Brett character is relatively restrained, which is nice. If I find this stuff again on the East Coast I'll be sure to drink it fresher to see what it's like. This year-old bottle treated me pretty damn well. (4.5)"

" This is a decent saision, it has many facets with some brett giving the tropcial fruit and subtle spice alongside some malt which is toasted but lightly sweet with some nice hop bitterness to keep it balanced and somehat spicy as the malt recedes and the carbonation settles you get a light yeast flavor in the dry finish. Overall this was a beer I have been wanting to try, Thanks Dan this was an unexpected treat. I like the drinkability I could have probably drank the whole bottle myself. If you are a fan of saison or brett I recommend this."

"Pours a cloudy gold with a big, fluffy white head that settles to a thick cap, leaving a coat of soapy lacing clinging to the glass. Definitely Brett-heavy in the nose, got some plastic, citrus, dry funk, and pineapple in here, along with some crisp grain. Taste is similarly funky, more ""plastic-y"" notes, along with mild orange peel and pineapple, and earthy Brett. Mouthfeel is light and moderately crisp, with a touch under medium body, nicely scrubbing carbonation, and a bone-dry finish. Really standout Saison, I won't sit on it so long next time."

"Atmosphere is great. Good color, great head, and plenty of lacing. Nose is bread and fruity. Flavor is bitter and pungent. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"Beer is medium-bodied, with very high carbonation, which completely foams the beer up on the palate such that it is entirely bubbles across the tongue, perhaps too much so: it is consistently prickly and fizzy despite the bubbles. The resulting mouthfeel is that you're drinking the head of the freshly poured beer: not exactly desirable and kind of amateurish. Closes out semi-dry, with notable ethanol burn on the back of the palate and in the nostrils. In general, this was over-carbonated, and a tad too alcohol-heavy for its own good."
""

""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a golden, honey color into my Delirium glass, topped with a sudsy head. The beer appears to be quite carbonated, and there is some nice lacing coming from the head which retains itself well. As expected, there is a lot of sediment visible as well. The aroma is very intriguing! I can sense a background of juicy hops, with herbal brett, and farmhouse funk front-and-center. The taste is spectacular and complex, starting with a big smack of tanginess and lemongrass. There's some tart candy, lots of peppery spice, alpine herbs, and fruit esters in there as well - apple and pear come to mind. The entire package is medium bodied, coats the mouth, and is very smooth and relatively balanced. Overall, I don't think there is any other beer quite like this. It's not a beer, it's an experience."

"O/D-Oh man, really wanted to like this more. Just one of those beers that I know is great,well made and delicious to some people...It flirted with awesomeness for a short time, but this one doesnt suit me all too well. The Brett is adds a great component, but this Saison is too fruity and not funky enough for me. $14 per 750ml."
""
"O-This beer kind of wore me out, which is not necessarily what I want from a saison. I enjoyed the first half-glass, but it was so brett-dominant that I got a little tired after a while. That being said, I really liked the smell, and would be willing to give it another shot."
""
""

"Saison Brett pours out very bright golden in color with a shine to itself up upon light. A nice off white head reaches half an inch and sticks around. Some sediment seen floating around, but still clean looking beer. Smell is overrun with brett, a very nice effervescent scent coming from it with some pale malt backing and biscuits. Some faint fruit shows up to with some barnyard characteristics with warming. Taste is very good, meaning I really liked it. I've had a lot of saison/brett beers recently, a lot running middle of the pack. Boulevards got it going on while this bottle has 2 years on it. Bright brett notes, funkiness, damp blanket, hay, earth, orange, lemon, citrus. Some pale malt backing rinses everything out at the end while the brett stings the tounge a bit, which Im all for, spicy. Feel is at about medium with sparkling carbonation and a spicy aftertaste. I could do a half bottle of this, but a whole one would be a bit much, sharing is caring."
""
""
""
""
"A pretty good beer and good interpretation of the style. I tink the extreme tartiness might turn some people off though but letting the beer air out a little might let the fruit tones come out more."
"The brett in this beer is very forward. I have never licked a goat but if I did this is how I imagine it would taste. It is just too overwhelming in this beer."
"this is one of the best saisons ive ever had, really really really. it pours a dusty blonde color with a splendid white head that floats like a cloud. the nose is pretty farmy, yeasty, properly sour from the brett, and herbal. flavor is quite similar to the nose, but it comes in waves. theres a great malted wheat flavor underneath it all that you taste right at first, then comes the funky yeasts and the sour is in the finish. also a decidedly czech malt doughy flavor that carries on throughout. there is everything from black pepper to pickled lemons on my palate, and i cant get enough of this. the feel is also near perfect, smooth and thick, expansive in the mouth, but not at all filling or heavy. i could drink this everyday if i could afford it. it went magically with an aged goats gouda from holland, and i am dying to drink another bottle of this. its that good."
""
"Overall, a stellar beer, but I think I prefer the versatility to the base Tank 7 recipe a little better. However, you can't change and evolve Tank 7 the same way you can Saison-Brett, so I'm looking forward to watching this one grow and re-reviewing."

"My my. Poured only an 8th inch head but lasted well and stayed laced throughout. Body is a pretty clear gold with even a hint of green gold unless this bar's light is messing with me. Smells richly of malt with a little dried fruit and some tropical unamable funk. Taste is great, echoing the smell and also having hints of cola, pencil shavings, and melon rind. Lasts long on the palette. Nice job Boulevard, you did KC proud."

"O: haven’t had a saison in quite some time, but decided to give this style another shot. This one is actually quite nice and I find it light enough to thoroughly enjoy on this hot day. The complexity in the nose isn’t all that big in my opinion, but I find a massive amount of complexity in the taste. I find this one extremely well balanced and think that the drinkability is actually quite high."
"O: Pretty much what I was ecpecting. Just funky saison heaven."

"So glad I found this on tap. Very earthy and funky with an incredible balance of crisp citrus and hops. Complex fruit and subtle malt in the middle. I love this beer."

""
""

"Overall (4.5/5): Saison-Brett is an excellent beer. It has all the elements of a very good big (high abv.) Saison, but the addition of Brett as an integral ingredient puts it over the top and makes it one of the most memorable examples of the style that I have had. If you're curious what a beer with Brett in it tastes like and you're adventurous, you can't go wrong purchasing a glass or bottle of this next time you see it."

"O: Fantastic. Not the sourest beer ever, so I'm glad I have another in the cellar. Everything comes together perfectly. Sour complements saison."
"This beer exceeded my expections, would buy many again."
"Pours a golden yellow with a big white, foamy head. Vubbles continue to rise to the surface and nice lacing. A nice sweet and funky aroma; banana,candied sugar, cloves, and hay. Flavor offers some funkiness alongside some lemon, cloves, a little breadiness and a touch of some hops in the finish. A crisp, active mouthfeel. Overall, an enjoyable brew. Well put together and smooth."
""
""
"I love Blvd. yearly offering of this saison. Great brett notes mixed in with a refreshing and juicy saison."
""
"If you like a good farmhouse ale, and want to know what a Brett(funked up) version will taste like, you can't beat this mana in a glass."
""
""
"O: Overall, this was a pretty interesting and unique offering. It smelled fantastic, but I wasnt blown away by the taste.  I would have liked more tartness or funk, preferably tartness.  Certainly above average, but for me there is no comparison to really any of the Fantome's I have tried. And to be Fantome and their various saison offerings are definitely still my gold standard for the style."
"Overall: This is the #2 Saison for a reason! Great beer by Boulevard! It honestly my second favorite next to BBQ. Love those smokestack series beers!"
"O: This is just an amazing beer. It hits its mark on ever possible aspect of this style. I wish I could find this beer all the time because its one of the best I have ever had."

"Pours a very hazy yellow with a decent white head that laces lightly. Nose is more to the saison side than the Brett in this bottle. Pepper, light brett notes that are more indistinguishable than merely ""barnyard"". Body is quite similar. Wheat, bread, pepper, a light buttery nature, barnyard. Finishes quite dry. Initially quite disappointed compared to some of the hype, though as time passed it grew on me to liking it. Sampled back to back with Elder Brett by Epic, and theirs was by far my favourite."
""
""
"O: Saison-Brett is an unbelievable, world-class beer; like I said, this has a year on it, and I can only imagine what another year or two would do to this"
""
"Served on tap at Durty Nellies. Appearance is a clear gold with sticky white head, nice lacing left behind. Aroma starts with funky Brett up front, very up front and aromatic. This weaves with lemon and sourdough bread. Lots of complexity in the nose with layers of funk and Brett pairing nicely with the Saison features. Taste is well balanced and refreshing. Brief tartness paired with wheat and bread, finish is slightly sweet. One of the better saisons I have had. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing. Over, this beer is well worth seeking out, especially if you want a nice balanced example of a bretted Saison."

"O: A very peppery and earthy saison. Light and refreshing, feels much lighter than 8.5%. Pretty simple and tasty, great for a hot summer day."
"Overall this is a very good saison. Fresh, the hops lend a wonderful flavor layer, but age will definitely bring out the Brett and enhance the other yeast flavors. I reall need another bottle of this for the cellar. Recommended to any fan of saisons or Brett beers. Cheers!"

"O: I like this beer, though the Brett is not nearly as pronounced as I was expecting it to be. Need to get another and let it sit to see where the Brett takes it."

"Phenols will be present, so if you're one of those folks who are super sensitive to that ""band-aid"" flavor (like me), this may or may not be for you. It has the obvious barnyard characteristics, but over the damn top. Whooo! Strong mamma-jamma. Serious ass lemon and hay. Sun. Foam. Roll this one good for the suspension. How does sun and summertime hay bailing taste? I'm not sure, but this beer is the business."

"I had no doubt I'd enjoy this beer and it didn't disappoint. Saisons are still my favorite Belgian style beer and Boulevard's offerings have helped with coming to that belief. This beer is a good use of brett. It's funky but isn't bold in its addition to the beer's other qualities, meaning it's a well-balanced and enjoyable beer. No doubt there will be many children named ""Brett"" after this beer."
"Big white fluffy head on top of a nice gold yellow body. Initial aroma gives you a bit of juicy fruit notes and some spice. Opens up quite a bit more on the palate. Nice balance of flavors but not quite as funky as expected, only slightly musty. Apple and citrus notes with some bubblegum notes. Pepper and lemongrass offset the sweetness. Crisp and bubbly mouthfeel makes for quite a refreshing beverage. Overall, truly an exceptional saison just a few shades shy of perfect."
""
"Its a very refreshing beer. Not much too it. I'm sure it was a complex process to make, but the outcome comes off quite simple."

"Overall – This is one outstanding beer. Being a porter lover, I typically stay towards the darker end of the beer spectrum, but this brew is quite a hit to me. I wish I had a case of it right now, and if I knew where I could get one I would go buy it. Highly recommended. Boulevard puts this one out of the park, much like the rest of the Smokestack Series."
"O: I'm not usually a fan of saisons but this one is pretty good. Very well balanced and drinkable with a nicley balanced yeast profile... And the Brett seems to just tie the whole package together nicley. Way better then stank 7."
"Overall: It is so encouraging to see this beer come back again. Boulevard is on a roll lately. As a Kansas Citian I'm embarrassed to admit I probably talk more shit on my hometown brewery than needed, but this shows where Bully's true heart is at. It is beers like this, the Rye on Rye and the Double Wide IPA that make me want to boast of KC's beer scene. It is an exceptional take on the trending, but nonetheless classic, saison style. The Brett, in my opinion, should respect the taste buds of regular fans of the Saisons (such as the DuPont), but I also found it pleased the palates of my APA drinking buds."

"Drinking a bottle but I've had this many times on tap and in the bottle over the years since this was first test brewed. Gold yellow with lingering head. Big flavors of horse blanket, fruit rind, funk...not a smooth and easy saison but not too funky with the brett either. Tasty and manly!!"
""
""
""
"5, 4.5, 3, 4, 3.5"
"Drink and Overall: Pretty phenonemal. I had two bottles of the 2009 with about a year and half on them, and that seemed much brighter with Brett, but this has some beautiful Saison flavors that aren't overshadowed by the Brett."
"O: A-"
""
""
""
""
"Well, after several sips, it’s clear why this beer is so highly praised. It’s fun to drink as you continue to discover all the nuances. I find that I could continue to list things I taste and smell in the beer."
""
"o - overall a winner of a beer...and a few years adds tons of enjoyable complexity. my ratings are based on the 2009...the 2011 was also great, but i'd probably drop the overall and/or taste score slightly and give it a 4 across the board, if you've got one, sit on it for a few years. i'm a huge fan of saisons and brett adds a nice complexity to the style, but seems to take away some of what i love about the style...still enjoyable, but as for classic saison-ness, this has the brett kick which overpowers the classic aspects. great beer, different and unique and it works. would love to try this after sitting in some white wine barrels for a few months. cheers boulevard."

"jd"
"A real funky interpretation of a saison, not really my thing. But pretty complex. It could use some bacteria to counter the funk."
""
"To date, this is probably my favorite offering from Boulevard."
""
""
""
"Overall: Super-solid beer overall and well worth drinking, but I'm not sure it was best to put it down for as long as I did. I need to start drinking these sours fresher. Great flavors that aren't overwhelming or too far leaning in the funky direction, this would be a great sour to get started with if you're unfamiliar with them."
""
"O- Enjoyable, Wasn't sure what to expect with this. Really wanted to try something new, and was surprised that I liked it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Nose is an estery saison with plenty of funk and crisp hops. Mouthfeel is pushing excessive carbonation. This beer is just bottle conditioned with brett, so early on it has a nice balance of saison, hops, and brett."
""
""
"O: Very smooth and drinkable – I actually would have liked a little bit more funk, but it’s still packing quite a bit of punch at the moment. While it doesn’t jump out at you with extreme flavors, it does go down with smooth complexity (and there’s nothing wrong with that, I assure you). A beer that’s rich, but not overwhelming in character: that certainly makes an offering in this style memorable."
"D - Intensely drinkable at 8.5%, and still going pretty strong. I was worried this would follow the trend of fast-fading American Wild Ales, but this has held up and kept its flavor pretty well. Still, I don't think I'd push it to five years, so drink up if you're still holding onto the first batch."
"D - Very drinkable. Really nice Saison with some added complexity from the Brett, but it does not take over."
"Overall - As i said, one of the best beers I've EVER drank, period."
""
"O- Really clean and dry iteration of this style. Great if you like your sours with less funk. I prefer weird farm flavors and sweaty dirt in it."
"amazing beer, this is dead on what i imagined a brett saison would taste like, or every saison for that matter. every quality you would want is there. very impressed. now im even more eager to try the BBQ sitting in my cellar. do whatever you have to do to get this."
"I wasn’t quite as blown away as I thought that I might be from this but it certainly very good, with that Brett and base Saison being married together with a deft touch. Alcohol seems a little high for this to be hugely drinkable but I’d certainly never turn a glass of this down."
""
""
""
"D/O- Really hard to magine a better saison as this is an absolute treat. Great drinkability. Nice Valentine's Day treat with my girlfriend!"
""
"Wow, this is quite the beer and I'm glad I could finally try it. Initially opening the bottle I'm blown away and can't wait to try one a few months down the line."
"This pours a clear golden straw color with a tremendous amount of foam. There’s a yeasty, estery, funky aroma to this, familiar to anyone who has had Boulevard’s Tank 7 saison. Similar flavor on the mouth, yeasty, floral, estery with a dry finish. Wonderful character, with a lemony tang whispering underneath. As it warms it holds up."

"Got this beer in the 100% satisfaction redux BIF. Have been really excited to try this for a long time. Opens with a loud resounding pop. I was a bit worried about a gusher, but the beer stayed put. Pours with a big billowy white head that has some great staying power with a bit of nice lacing, but there is definitely too much head here. Aroma is very nice and fruity with a lot of Belgian pale ale characteristics, not much funk or brettyness than I would have expected or wanted. Flavor is mildly sweet and fruity, but nice and dry and crisp, a bit more barnyard than the aroma (especially in the aftertaste), and a mild alcohol bite. Mouthfeel is very light with good refreshing carbonation. Exactly the dry effervescent beer I would have wanted."

"Overall: This is a great beer to pair with food. It doesn't fully come together for me, and the mouthfeel is a little harsh, but I really love some of the flavors it delivers. Would drink again, but preferably when it's hot out and with a meal."

"Notes: 2011 Batch 2 Bottle 12581. Interesting beer. There was no one thing that I really enjoyed, but overall it just kind of worked. A little on the sweet side with that honey (and slight wheat) sweetness especially on the finish. I wanted a bit more funk but there was enough there to satisfy me (I'm aging another and hopefully more funk comes out in that). Complex flavors that just work and have me wanting more."

"O - This wound up being a wonderful and refreshing summer beer. Especially after working for hours in the 90 degree heat earlier in the day. Delightful in many ways, Saison Brett reminded me of Dogfish Head Zeno - both are more of a crisp and clean style of saison than the more funky/harsh saisons out there."

"2011 Vintage. Pours a very yellowish-golden color...probably the most yellow-colored beer I've ever had. Large white head that goes down slowly. Scent is somewhat tart with a lovely barnyard funk aroma. Nice lemon aroma as well. A bit spicy also. Taste is initially lemony with nice yeast flavors. Then I get some awesome funky flavors with hoppiness and pepper. Lovely dry finish with some nice spice and hop tingle. Mouthfeel is dry and spicy, medium bodied. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this beer was fantastic. So glad I got to finally have it. Thanks Bruce!"

"750 ml caged and corked bottle, 2011 vintage, bottle #21339, Batch 2011-2, best by date of 03-2013. Served in a tulip glass, the beer pours a hazy gold color with about an inch and a half frothy off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. Aroma is a bit spicy, the brew smells like peppery spice, bready malt, citrus peel, apricots, earthy yeast and brett. The brew tastes like bready malt, citrus peel, herbs/flowers, earthy hops, hay, brett and a bit of mint. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, and it's well carbonated. I think this is a good brew, I'd pick this up again in the future."
"Taste was not as great as I expected. Lemon peel and hops with spice. The body was not as heavy as others. The carbonation was really good as you would expect. This is an easy beer to drink, but I didn't find it any more fulfilling that some of the easy ones to get like Hennipin or Tank 7. Not as wild as some of the other Bretts I have had."
"O: I have brewed a few great saisons that came out great and I felt let down on this one. I have also enjoyed some other American saisons more than this and didn't see what all the fuss was about. A good saison, just not standing out in any particular way for me."
"O - an excellent saison track this one down."
"I look forward to trying more Boulevard beers."
"Overall- Definitely one of the better saisons I have ever tried and certainly the best American-made saison I've had. Way to go, Boulevard!"
"Overall I'd say I'd be fine working in the sun for 8 hours a day for 20+ pints of this guy!"
"O: This beer is fantastic. I'm really enjoying it. It has a great balance of flavors and funk. If Boulevard distributed in my area I'd be buying this brew all of the time."
"This is a pretty well known beer that lives up to the hype. A great example, maybe even the standard, of it's style."
"Wow, Boulevard had better keep this one around. I am converted to brett and to a life-long Boulevard supporter (I was already quite a fan) by this beer. I know I have failed to capture the nuances of this great liquid, but it certainly deserves a high spot on beer geeks' lists."
"It is a glorious Sunday afternoon....working on a work presentation outside and my neighbor brought over good tidings in the form of Boulevard Saison Brett. The beer was poured into a tulip glass. The appearance is a yellow hazy color with big cabonation that lead to a foamy head that is lacing. The aroma is quite interesting....lavender, corriander, orange peel are all possible scents. The taste is a crisp ale that has spice and tartness, not much malt...if at all. The combination helps to mask the higher ABV. Mouthfeel is good...higher abv and carbonation make this more of a sipping beer. Overall it is a good beer!"
"Pours a light gold color with a great white one finger head. Excellent lacing and carbonation. Nose is grain, grass, lemon, funk. Out of this world nose! Taste is yeast, funk, lemon, clove, other spices, and some pepper. Amazing. Feel is super smooth and very drinkable. This doesn't feel like a 8.5% beer. Overall, this lived up to the hype for me. Glad I got to try it."
"D: Absolutely exceptional example of the style.  This is hands down the best American made farmhouse ale, if not the best of its kind.  Wildly funky, yet not over the top.  Earthy, citrusy, herbal, and slightly vegetal.  Amazing complex yet perfectly balanced.  Try it if you can!"
"Excellent beer; highly recommended. If you're a fan of Saisons or Farmhouse ales I'd highly recommend this one. It's really refreshing while managing to maintain some significant complexity. Impressive!"
"Pours a slightly hazy yellow-gold with a huge 3 inch fizzy off-white head that settles to a small cap. Random splotches of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of sour apples, spices, and the classic funky earthy brett smell. Taste is of grains, spices, yeast, and a subdued funky brett flavor. I was actually expecting this to be more sour and funky than it is. The aftertaste is of spices and yeast. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a medium body and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good saison with the brett addition, but I would like to try this one with a bit more sourness and funk!"
"I'm sorry I didn't pick up a few bottles of Saison-Brett this summer, as I imagine it would be a perfect warm weather beer. I still hope to pick up many bottles, as this is a great take on the style and a delicious beer."
"Vintage 2011. Consumed 8-7-2011. Lots of hype with this beer. Outstanding ratings and reviews, which I always get excited about, but in the back of my head i wonder if all the reviews follow the initial good ones- not wanting to go against the crowd so to speak. Popped the cork, and a CRAZY huge head, just as expected. Smelled like tank7, perhaps even more pronounced barnyard aromas. Hay, dusty wood, that horse blanket thing, some tropical fruit from hops, and a faint balsamic tart smell - the brett. Tastes amazing. Refreshing. TONS of flavor. that tartness from the brett, the yeasty funk layers, and some earthy hops in the back. Mouth feel is great- not too carbonated, but a very bubbly drink. It really matched the hype. I hope the ones I tossed in the cellar will become more funky over time."
"Really crisp, tart and refreshing with a dry finish and lively carbonation. I've had a few domestic saisons lately that have me a bit down on the style but this one (and Tank 7) turned me around on that quick. Really nice, drinkable, the alcohol is nowhere in sight."
"Very complex saison, probably my favorite so far. Gotta love the classics like saison dupont but this is a fresh interesting take."
"O: A beer I'd share a bottle of again, but not seek out personally. I'd rather have it on tap actually."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. I would certainly seek it out in the future, as it is my favorite saison to date."
"overall this is a really good - nay, great - saison. funky, complex, and tasty! grabbed another bottle which i'll throw in the cellar for a while, would like to see what some age does to this. easily my favorite out of the offerings i've sampled from the smokestack series."
"D.great and drinkable. I would love to drink this again. Great beer for those who think Saison sucks."
"O - What a nice refreshing brew! Super glad I have a few more to savor and let rest for sometime to come."
"O: My first offering from Boulevard Brewing Company. Based on the very high ratings, detailed positive reviews, and promise of brett by the brewery, I was looking forward to this. This was a good beer, but not really what I was expecting. I have several bottles remaining that I plan to age and see if I just drank this one too early."
"Edit: upon reviewing this beer I noticed that this was review number 420... snootch to the nootch"
"O - solid beer, but too strong and not dry enough for me. I want a clean crisp saison and some more funk and this didn't deliver. I'd give it another shot to make sure it wasn't a single bottle issue, though."
"O: I could honestly drink this one all day, but for the sour lover, they will have to age this baby for a L-O-N-G time! One would have to have a microscope to detect any Brett on this brew. Then again... this IS the 2011 version."
"I love Saison's, and have been dying to try this...but worried because I'm not into sours. But this was wonderful. The tart/funkiness wasn't over the top, and melded with the Belgian Saison goodness wonderfully! Can't wait to get more!!"
"O: Definitely better than I was expecting. I would definitely buy again. Probably one of the best American Saisons I’ve had. 4.5"
"O - This is definately sessionable considering it is a 8.5%. Quite shocking and dangerous. Would love to have again."
"O- Good beer, would be amazing if lower gravity and more crisp. Need more of a refreshing kick on my saisons. Glad I finally got to try..."
"In summary, funk, do you like? If yes, proceed."
"I also grabbed one for the cellar and am very glad I did. Should age very well."
"An outstanding saison, heavy on the funk, but with enough citrus and bite to even things out. Wish this was more readily available; as it is I may have to wait quite a while to drink it again."
"Both pour a clear orange. Almost a golden colour. A nice bit of white head. The 2009 has tons and tons of head. Smells a slight bit funky. The 2009 smells like something funky is really starting to take hold but it needs more time. Tastes sweet and thicker. a slight bit of booziness. Overall not the best saison I've ever had but enjoyable."
"O - This is a very nice summer beer from Boulevard. It drinks like a saison but has a very nice tart tinge from the brett that compliments the style nicely. This is a great beer to try if you are interested in getting into sours."
"Overall this is a decent saison fresh, but I fear I might have an aversion to such application of Brett. Not something I would seek, but can see why others dig it."
"This is a light bodied brew with a modest to high level of carbonation. Easy drinking for 8.5%. This is an interesting compilation of flavoring. The Brett is quite bold throughout which creates an interesting predicament; I don't know if aging this would make the brew evolve and become more enjoyable or if it will get completely dominated by Brett. Regardless, as-is the dryness an snap to the finish kept me interested, I'm sure I could have tackled the bottle myself. I really appreciate you sharing this one with me Leon."
"O: This is truly a sensational beer. The interactions between ingredients makes for a refreshingly unique crisp veggie and herby bread character. The flavors never appear naked. Lemony Kale, buttery watercress, sharp raw onions, creamed artichokes, and the list goes on. This is a fine dining pairing with infinite potential. Alone this is a fancy resturaunt appetizer, but aged this might be a delicious bretty feast. I'm so glad to have a bottle to age. This a magical earthy garden beer, where hops act as mentor to young funk."
"O- Awesome, a very good use of brett that helps to balance the beer overall without completely taking over. I would like to try this again with some age and compare."
"Pours a golden hay color with lots of carbonation, two finger head an great lacing throughout. Aroma of citrus, funk and pepper. Taste follows the nose just intensified. This really showcases the Brett in the best way possible. This is so tasty and so refreshing, I would love to have the ability to drink this all the time. Saision Brett is an amazing beer!"
"The best beer that's available to me on a regular basis."
"Overall: This is a complex, fantastic creation, although I prefer the base Tank 7 Saison from Boulevard."
"Aptly named, at the brett is center stage with this beer. Aggressive head that quickly settled down. Earthy, funky, tropical-fruity - the odd but interesting mix that brett brings to the table is abundant. Fairly crisp malt, but the yeast softens it a good deal. Alchohol is a bit too up front and asserts a harsh edge at the front."
"O: Nice beer, quite drinkable through the course of an evening, although I lean towards saisons which are a little more light and refreshing."
"Overall a really excellent beer even fresh. A few years on the this beer really seems to round out the astringency and bring a interesting sour citrus character into play. Even fresh as a hoppy, earthy big saison, this beer stands out as being great."
"Overall: I wasn't impressed given the high expectations I had. I just assumed I would love this beer. The mix of flavors threw me off. I guess this goes to show why there is more than one beer, different strokes for different folks."
"Overall I love this beer so much. I think it's got everything I love out of the Saison style, with the complexity from the brett that just puts it over the top for me. It truly is an exceptional beer. Can't wait to revisit this in a couple years."
"O- Kind of torn with this one. The funky aroma at first smell got my hopes up, but the sour didn't really come through in the taste."
"Overall: I was shocked with how much I enjoyed this beer. If you can find it I would highly recommend picking it up."
"Overall: I expected a lot from this beer and it lived up to expectation 100%. Simply one of the best examples for the style, in my experience. Elegantly & unapologetically funky."
"D - Very nice. Tasty!"
"O: Good beer. Not a huge fan of the saison's. A refreshing beer nonetheless."
"O – High ABV is masked well, a refreshing saison with a lot of complexity that is fun to drink, but the durability of flavor doesn’t keep my interest, a bit restrained 4"
"O- its a good saison but it may need to be aged for awhile.. i drank one now and will age 2 more till next year.. a good saison pick some up"
"O: Very drinkable and enjoyable. Remarkably refreshing and even clean in the finish. ABV is masked well."
"Overall is really good and I plan on buying more to cellar."
"This, very simply is one of the best beers I've ever had. The aroma is unique, at lease compared to any beer I've had before, and reminded me of a field after a heavy rain....if that makes any sense. I'm currently cellaring a bottle that I plan on opening in celebration of graduating with my master's in December."
"O: Highly drinkable and amazingly refreshing, especially on this hot July evening. The funky notes from the addition of brett are a great complement to the base beer. The 8.5% ABV is really well hidden."
"The taste is also brett-dominated. Appropriately dry. Far too drinkable for the ABV... though you can tell it's there. The funk is the base of the taste. Earthy and horse blanket. Maybe a bit of sugar cookie and lemon back there. All well blended and something I keep wanting to drink more. This is great stuff and I'll enjoy downing the rest of the bottle."
"D/O - Drinkability is high. This isn't the most sexy beer, but it's an interesting concept that has a near flawless execution. Although Brett beers and saisons aren't exactly near the top of my list of favorite styles, this is an excellently crafted beer that is worthy of praise. Solid and keeps me coming back for more. This is a beer that shows that craft beer can be considered in the same realm as wine and fine spirits."
"7fity of the 2009. Pours hazy straw yellow with a huge pillowy head. Aroma is brett-a-riffic with citrus and soap. Flavor is grassy and lemony, and definitely brings the funk. Dry finish and light on the standard saison spiciness. Effervescent carbonation and light mouthfeel. World class."
"Light bodied and highly carbonated but the bubbles were not aggressive and prickly on the tongue. Very refreshing for a warm day outside, which is when I had my glass of this beer. I'm glad this was my Boulevard beer."
"Pours a hazy yellow-ish orange color with a large white head that left some sheets of lacing on the glass. Aroma is dry, grassy, some notes of lemon and only a very light brett funk. Taste is pretty much the same, brett notes are very subtle, lightly tart, a touch of lemon and leather, but man this thing is dry and really crisp and refreshing. A bit of fruit and citrusy hops in the background. Nothing really stands out in the flavor, everything is just very light and mellow. I suppose I was expecting more brett/lemon character, but it's bone dry and not overly complex. Crisp, dry mouthfeel, carbonation is also lower than expected. Maybe I was expecting way more brett character,maybe this just needs more time in the bottle, but I'm not overly impressed. It tastes good, but just not much flavor overall. I say hang on to these bottles for a year and see what happens."
"O - Bravo."
"CHEERS"
"Overall: A complex, yet refreshing beer, which is especially great during the summer months. The carbonation and light acidity would make this one work extremely well with food. It's an excellent mix of light sweetness, bitterness, crisp CO2, peppery phenols, and a dry finish. I'll be interested in trying another bottle of this vintage after cellaring it for a couple of years!"
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer. It is equally as good as the Saison Valtour that I had the other day but not as Brett influenced as I was hoping for/expecting judging from the name. Two years haven't added much funk so I assume this guy can/should be saved for at least 3 more years, so if you have one, hide it from yourself and forget about this for a while if your looking for more funk. I think it just fine right now though, highly recommend, definitely 1 of the top 2 Saisons I have ever had."
"O: This is a great Saison. Had a tasting of it while waiting in line for the Gratitude release and was happy to finally get my hands on another bottle."
"Overall, I can see why this is rated as an outstanding beer. The mouthfeel is light & the drinkability is extremely high. You'll feel the 8.5% ABV so be careful. But overall, this fits like a glove for the hot weather. My only criticism is, I think that Tank 7 (known for being the little brother of this bad boy) is actually my favorite. I'll wait to cellar the others for at least another 6 months to a year before trying. Maybe that'll change my mind. Either way, PROSIT!"
"O: Oh yeah, this is a great beer. The smell is a bit timid, but the rest does not disappoint and the mouthfeel is really over the top. Worth seeking out. Pricey ($13/750 ml) but well worth it. Fantastic."
"Just a phenomenal beer. I may be a boulevard homer, but this beer fresh is great.. this beer with some age on it is one of the most fantastic beers I have ever tasted."
"Outstanding, Boulevard!"
"This is a complex saison that is amazingly easy to drink. It is quite good, though, I think the brett character could use maybe 6+ months in the bottle to really develop and come together."
"Lots of prickly carbonation, wetting to the palate, and the 8.5 ABV is hardly detectable. A great brew here!"
"O- I’ve wanted to try this for a while; this is an excellent beer, very tasty and refreshing, a perfect beer for this recent scorching weather here in MN. I’m going to have to go out a buy a couple more bottles before they sell out."
"Overall Impression- Would love to taste this beer after it ages! Such an interesting Saison, I can't say anything else but try it yourself. One of my top 10 favorite beers this year! Thanks for the recommendation Mark!"
"The flavor hits the palate with spicy, herbal hop notes and a bready, Bretty follow-up. The Brett cuts through the grainy maltiness before clashing against a fruity, boozy finish of Granny Smith apple and lemon. Mouthfeel is light and bubbly despite the medium body; the finish crisp and carbonated. All in all, a fantastic saison and an even better use of Brettanomyces re-fermentation. A must-try for any beer geek."
"Drinkability- for an 8.5% beer, the abv is totally masked. Overall, this is a beautiful Saison, but still not as good as Cellar Door in my opinion."
"Medium bodied and heavily carbonated at first with a funky, earthy brett flavor that adds dryness, complimenting the saison yeast characteristics. Nice bready yeast presence with hints of coriander and pepper along with some apple and pear. A nice amount of sweetness to counter the dry brett and grassy notes. Crisp, refreshing and very easy to drink. Very good."
"O - Really happy I hung on to a couple bottles from 2009. This was absolutely outstanding. There isn't a better brett-finished saison out there. Cheers,"
"Bottle. Pours a cloudy yellow straw color with a big fluffy white head. Lots of fruit int he nose; green apple, pear, apricot, and then florals and slight medicinal. Sweet fruit notes that then turn into the bretty floral flavors with some mild tartness. Light mouthfeel. Lots of carbonation. Overall rather refreshing. The brett is there but doesn’t totally dominate the flavor and nose."
"So I'm really nitpicking here. It's a great beer and I'll grab many if I can find it when it's released."
"I am so glad i waited till summer to pop this. this is a beer for the end of a hot day, to bookend a good one."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a trace of white foamy head that has good retention. The aroma is flowery and fruity. The taste is mellow with fruity and earthy notes. Mouthfeel is nice and balanced, with just the right amount of carbonation. Overall a great saison."
"D-Overall this is a great beer of this style. Still trying to get into this style more.As its very good and drinkable but sometimes lacks a ton of flavor for me. but overall would drink this again"
"Pours quite cloudy and is pale yellow or straw in color. Massive white head with soapy bubbles that leaves the glass coated in lace. Sticks around the entire time. Smell is a little more subtle than I expected, but Brett is certainly there and adds a nice sour aroma along with traditional Saision elements. Flavor is nice, but again is a bit subdued. Brett prevalent, but not terribly sour or tart. A bit funky and very summer is flavor. Lots of carbonation and great drinkability."
"Huge ups to Joshvandy for trading with me for this bad boy!!!"
"O: A wonderful beer and a great example of the style (and what can be done to the style). I would drink this often if it were available."
"I didn't like the taste of this one one bit. Just something about it soured the wrong way. Though if your very into sours, you will probably like this one. Someone who tried it with me mentioned a hint of jock strap and while it was just for humor, it did make me think twice."
"O - This is wonderful Saison thats well balanced and extremely drinkable. What i really like is that i find it to be a unique take on the saison style thats sweeter than i have come to expect. This is probably my last beer as Passover is about to begin, and i cant think of a better way to go dry for a week with this one fresh on my mind."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Amazing mouthfeel. Between light and medium bodied with tons of ultra-fine carbonation. Extremely creamy on the palate. Overall, I wish the Brett presence was more up front rather than a complement. That being said, this is still a world-class saison from Boulevard. The citrus component is great, as well as the mouthfeel. Boulevard really is one of the Belgian-style leaders in the States."
"Thanks so much to Ratman for bringing this one over on Saturday night. Batch 1 (2009). Truly an amazing beer, one I wish I had stocked up on (or bought period). Poured a hazy orange color with a nice white head. Nice funky aromas, barnyard, some citrus and Belgian yeast. Medium bodied and crisp, with nice funk, horseblanket, citrus zest. Awesome."
"Hazy orange-yellow color with a formidable white head, smells like belgian yeast mingling with some lemony notes and a bit of funk. Definitely has more belgian yeast qualities in the flavor, some banana, lemony notes and a bit more funk. Medium body with a good bit of carbonation. Not too drinkable to me personally. I was expecting it to be a bit more sour and the brett to be more pronounced. Anyhow I could see why some would love this but it isn't my cup of tea."
"Highly drinkable saison. Now one of my favorites."
"D: Very tasty beer, a little sweeter than I thought it would be. 8% abv is completely hidden. Overall a beer I want to drink again and again."
"Overall I love the complexity of this beer. Its just a delicate style and to get just right is amazing. Need More !"
"Saison-Brett pours a deep yellow/light orange color, almost entirely translucent. The rocky white head is absolutely *massive* (think 4+ fingers worth of foam), and has crazy good staying power. Lacing is a bit of a letdown though, especially for the style. Nose is very powerful, I can smell it even before I pour the bottle. It's pretty close to an equal blend of granny smith pale malt sweetness and the expected barnyard funk, with the scales maybe tipped just a bit in favor of the brett. The flavor largely follows, but the addition of a strong black pepper presence really elevates the beer. The mouthfeel is really superb. The body is exceptionally rich/smooth while still maintaining a dry finish, and the carbonation is very explosive, giving Saison Brett a sensation of lightness that belies its 8.5% ABV. This is my second beer from Boulevard, the first being BBQ, and I'm not sure which impresses me more."
"I could drink a 750 of this easily and quickly. Saison Brett is a beer I would drink in the middle of a hot summer day -- then fall into the pool drunk."
"Drinkability: This was well-made, but I did not completely connect with it. This is one worth coming back to revisit as I venture deeper into Saisons and sours."
"Mouthfeel is soft, refined, massaging the tongue with tiny bubbles over a light body. Very nicely balanced, plenty of carbonation without ever letting it get out of control. Dry on the finish. Beautifully drinkable, as perfect as I could ever expect - I had downed half a bottle before I even knew it. Lucky for me that my wife isn't a saison fan, since it left this one all to me. Balanced, complex, refreshing. Lived up to the hype."
"Drinkability - I could drink this all night with ease.... until the alcohol kicks in and reminds me to slow down."
"Beer pours a golden straw color with a perfectly pure white head that leaves very nice lacing and avows great head retention. The beer is crystal clear and very nice to look at. The smell is musty funky basement balanced with a very sweet aroma of dissolved candy sugar. A little bit of nice floral earthiness that comes in at the back to really bring a nice layer of additional complexity. The taste starts with a little punch of band aid funkiness followed by a peppery lemony sugar sweetness. The very nice funky Brett notes follow and really bring a nice bit of dusty earth in the finish. The beer is fairly alcoholic requiring it to be slowly sipped, but the flavors are so nice and complex that I keep going back for more. I also think it is slightly too carbonated for me. This was a little harsh before it warmed up, but the sweet and balance complexity really shows itself well one warmed. I would liken this to a funkier version of avec les bon veux and that is a huge compliment."
"This is a delightful saison, and very drinkable."
"Massive thanks to mattisloco for sending me a bottle of this in a past trade! Bottle 8062 of 11925. Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured golden yellow with a five finger pure white head that subsided to one finger very slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, spices, green apple, funk, and slight sour. The flavor was of sweet malt, banana, funk, slight spices, and alcohol. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a very good brew. Definitely had a great flavor going on here. The saison spices in this worked really well with the added wild yeast. The aroma was quite nice and inviting too. Defniitely glad I got to try this one as it is an absolute must try!"
"This bottle is batch 2009-2. This beer pours a muddied apricot into my Founders snifter with a light white, pork rhine looking head. It smells of serious barnyard funk and a lot of yeast. That basically sums it up. This is exceptionally smooth and is light in body. It drinks very, very smoothly. This is a great saison. To compare this to others would take a longer look."
"The CPJ"
"D---Recommended. Tasty Saison..."
"D: This is one of my favorite Saisons, but this is not a style that lends itself to an ""everyday"" beer. This is more of a good beer on a Saturday afternoon after you've been in the barn all morning restoring your classic car."
"D: A fine, full-bodied, and unapologetic saison, this beer is intensely fruity, fairly peppery, and even malty. Given the name, Brettanomyces qualities are surprisingly restrained. I went in expecting an overboard experience in the vein of North Coast's funky saison La Merle, but instead discovered more nuanced qualities akin to The Bruery's Saison Rue. Each beer seems to have some thin areas in the flavor profile, but Boulevard's offering features a more interesting and appealing smell. At $15 the bottle seems a little pricey for what it is, considering the competition."
"(78th)"
"Poured clear golden color with a large frothy off-white head that was lasting with excellent lacing. Heavy brett yeast and fruit aroma. Medium to full body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium to heavy blalanced sweet & sour flavor with a medium to heavy sour & sweet finish of moderate duration. Solid complex drinkable beer."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish to yellow color with a big, rocky off white head. In the aroma, small tartness, white grape like and a small earthiness. In the taste, dry earthiness, small white grape tartness, and somewhat spicy, mostly a blend of cinnamon and black pepper. A spicy bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a light dry yeasty and spice aftertaste. It hides the alcohol, somewhat Fantome like, and fantastic!"
"Drink- Well constructed saison. I really appreciated this one a lot. Need to compare it to Fantome for NYE."
"D - very drinkable. Nice balance of aromas, but overall was expecting something a little more interesting given the reputation + age."
"Lemon and orange, hint of unripe apples, really balanced Brett infusion which gives off a bit of leather, pennies, barnyard and a musty earthiness like a cellar. Quite a round body, sweet and juicy, hint of caramel in the malt profile, dry finish. Sparkly carb that carries the weight, surprisingly drinkable for its weight but its still 8.5%, not exactly traditional saison quaffability. Really a fine brew, worth the accolades."
"The flavor and mouthfeel take a hit for me because it is so wildly carbonated that it takes away from my experience. I get a touch of metallic flavor in my mouth, the finish is cut short, and the body suffers in terms of not being lush and creamy like the finest Belgians. If this beer is going to score up there with the best, it should bubble more delicately in the mouth and giver the other ingredients a chance to shine in the finish."
"Clear golden pour with frothy white head. Aroma is very bretty, some pear, and saison yeast too. Taste is pretty rough, lots of alcohol and brett, reminds me of Bruery Saison Rue, but slightly better. Palate is good, a bit hot at times, but well carbonated and saison like (I like the brett caracter here). A very good saison, but not the best."
"Not the world beater the ratings led me to believe, but its still a damn good beer!"
"D: I like this beer a lot. Its something I really enjoy with food but can still chill with a glass of it. Like I've already mentioned, this is only getting better. 4/5"
"Overall, a decent beer. I wouldn't seek it out again as I have had many better Brett infused Saisons/Belgians."
"This beer has really improved since I first tried it almost a year ago...the Brett was understated when the beer was young, but now it comes out full force in aroma (excellent) and flavor (a bit too much)...would have liked a bit less bitterness and dryness in the finish, otherwise, fantastic beer!"
"Fantastic beer."
"DB- Kind of has a fruity, non-sour Geueze feel if you can imagine that. A good addition to what was already a solid beer. I wish the funk was in the flavor more but it was still complex and enjoyable."
"A good representation of the use of brett without it being a sour bomb. Mouthfeel needs some work but a nice saison."
"Highly enjoyed this bottle and will definitely be picking up 6 or so bottles to cellar highly recommend."
" I am not usually a big Saison fan but this is an amazing brew that I wish I had regular access to. Well done Boulevard!"
"D: I really like this beer....it's too bad that it is a limited release. Very tasty and easy drinking beer. Definitely recommend picking this one up."
"D: Even though it is late fall, I'm enjoying this as much as I would mid summer."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a good beer to drink for a while. Although there are better in the style, this is a nice complex beer that is worth drinking for a while."
"J"
"I poured this into my Levitation tulip. Pours a light caramel color with a 1.5 inch rocky head which dissipates very slowly leaving a profound sticky lace. Smell is of herbal, and earthly yeastiness. Brett with a capital B! Taste is of earthy spice, grass, and faint citrus. Saison Brett has a very carbonated stinging sensation. Almost like a fine champagne. For 8.5% abv, I could drink a ton of this stuff. Great saison made with passion. Love it!"
"Taste continues the nose's sweetness, with a soft fruitiness in the middle, and closes with a lightly bitter earthiness. Mouthfeel is soft over the tongue, and drinkability is nice, but limited by the amount of time it takes for the head to fall. Reasonably controlled brew for a brett."
"D: Good beer, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it again, as there are plenty of beers in this style these days that are excellent."
"D: Definitely a quality brew and one you should seek out now, but I have to say it's not one I'd label as exceptional. Perhaps it's my fault and my expectations were too high. Anyway...great, great brew from an outstanding brewery. Keep it going Boulevard! By the by, the ABV is extraordinarily well hidden...drinks like half of what it is."
"Nice mouthfeel and highly drinkable. Body is light. Maybe a little sweeter than preferred, but otherwise glad to have this one."
"Thanks to Andy for cracking this one. First off this one was ready to pop! The cork was creeping up on this one and Andy didn't even have to touch it with a giant popped and this one shot up in the air. Poured into a tulip. This is a golden honey color with a giant rocky white head. Looks pretty good! Smell that funk! the nose is a big whiff of floral brett, bready aroma and a slightly floral hop aroma. Not bad at all. The brett in the flavor is present but not at all over the top. It adds just enough funk to compliment the slightly peppery and buttery flavor that finishes with a nice bitter hop finish. This is really great. The mouthfeel is light and the carbonation is what I would expect. This is very drinkable, a very light well done saison."
"Cheers!"
"D - Very easy drinking beer even with the amount of carbonation. Goes down smoothly and I really wish I had some more. Will have to look for multiples of this one again soon."
"The mouthfeel is on the lighter side and carbonation is high. Drinkability is excellent, it really had a great range of really good flavors to it that all worked together nicely. I was particularly impressed with the Brett and how it added so much to the beer but managed to really compliment everything instead of dominating it does in so many Brett added beers. Excellent beer overall."
"D: Goes down easily, mild nice, nice representation of style. This is a great beer to sit with for a long time."
"Such an awesome beer done so well."
"D - Easy drinker with the alcohol very well hidden. Awesome beer."
"Brett & Boulevard, job well done. The massive complexities hide its strength, yet it stays dangerously quaffable."
"Notes - Wow, this is good. It may be my favorite Smokestack so far, which is saying a lot. The diversity of Boulevard's three saisons is interesting: the original is dry, this one is sour, and Tank 7 is sweet. I never considered saisons a diverse style until Boulevard came along. Props to them."
"* = ideas form fellow tasters"
"Taste is mostly fresh lemon, very crisp and light. There are hints of several spices but cloves are the most prominent. Alcohol is barely present, making this very drinkable. Mouthfeel is very fizzy and fluffy, as this is one of the more carbonated beers I've tried."
"Great beer. So complex and refreshing. I'm really digging the high level of carbonation and the Brett is kept in check. Very well done."
"Delicious, and no trace of alcohol."
"D - A bit much for my first taste of saison with brett, but definitely worth the experience. The balance between brett and saison was there, but very interesting to find a beer that combined the 2 flavors."
"D-this beer has a huge balance of delicious saison qualities and a solid brett presence up front. very well balanced with each aspect working together with the other creating a blend of flavors that works very well together."
"750ml, corked and caged, served in a goblet. Loud cork pop. Clear gold in color, very effervescent, with a rocky white head. Smells much sweeter than I expected from anything with ""Brett"" in the name. Smells like pears and mown hay. Taste is sharp and peppery, a tad barnyard-y. A very well blended and nice flavor, though. Mouthfeel is soft and full. Drinkability is good, although as it warms that barnyard funk gets stonger. A great beer. One best served cold, I think. Very unique and well worth the purchase. Just don't drink soon after being in a real barn. You may not get through it :)"
"Hazy yellow pour with a big, rocky, white head. The aroma is light lemon, funk, soft honey and wild flowers. The flavor is also very light with bright citrus notes, some brett funk, floral notes and lots of peppery phenols on the finish. Medium body with lots of carbonation."
"This one is every bit a world-class beer and arguably one of the best saisons I've had."
"Brett. has the capacity to overwhelm or deaden this style, but the strength of the other ingredients in Boulevard's saison are such that the wild yeast adds a welcome balance and complexity to an already pleasant base."
"Conclusion: I tend to prefer my saisons dry, but quite fruity and yeasty, or slightly sweeter if they've got a big bitter hop kick. Here I think the hop bitterness works well w/the Bretty tartness, but I'd like a bit more fruit/yeast here as well. The back of the bottle suggests aging this for a few years to get the Brett to really come into its own; I think I'd like a bit more Brett presence here, and might hold onto my second bottle for a little while. In the end, for me, this is a good saison, but not quite great."
"D - I could easily tackle a bottle of this, especially in the summer. This is a beer of phenomenal proportions. I love this saison!"
"Leathery brett is becoming more dominant as this one ages, but there is still plenty of complexity and brightness to the beer. You can tell this brew had a pretty heavy hand of bittering hops to begin with and some of the lemony fruitiness helps that linger on awhile. Dry, effervescent finish, carbonation is high and I like that in a saison. Malts are a little less neutral than some of the classic Belgian examples - still light, but contributes some sweetness and even some biscuity flavors. This beer is so easy to write about, so much going on. I think I like this beer at about the 1-1.5 year mark the best. I like a heavy brettomyces impact, but I dont want to lose all the other nuances either. Wonderful beer that I have no problem forking out the 12 buck for, one of the best beers I have ever had."
"Drinkability: Do I really only have 750 ml of this?! Bummer...I could drink more...but at 8.5 percent, 750 will be perfect."
"D- This is quite a challenging saison. It will not be for everyone, but the most seasoned saison fans will adore this beer."
"Overall hands down the most complex saison I've ever sampled. I would love to get my hands on this one again."
"(D)- Definitely a unique saison with the brett addition. Dry, funky, and a good bitterness. Subtle fruits, but they come through. Probably could easily age further, but an enjoyable/unique take on the style. Cheers!"
"The feel of this beer is a little mellow. It goes down well and really has a carbonated feeling as it goes down. Is a really drinkable beer."
"A really nice saison. Tasty."
"This is one hell of a beer. The drinkability is off the chart. The 8.5% abv is non existent. The bretty funk adds a wonderful complexity to an already spectacular beer. I bow to Boulevard for creating another wonderful brew."
"The mouthfeel exemplifies the best of the Belgian styles: light, carbonated, very spritzy. It feels no heavier than a 5% Orval. Very drinkable!"
"I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and would definitely have it again when it's available to me."
"I was very impressed with this offering from Boulevard. I was uncertain as what to expect, as it is the first ""brett"" I have tried. Could not have been better."
"I love this beers carbonation and how it adds interplay between the hops and malt. A saison worth getting your hands on."
"Into a snifter, poured a hazy golden hue, with modest carbonation and one finger of white head, with decent lacing. Very spicy; grains of paradise, coriander, brett funk, biscuit, and orange peel. The taste was same as the aroma, evenly balanced palate with a yeasty finish and spiciness afterwards. The feel was a little on the thin side. I'd definitely go another session of this brew."
"D- pretty good on a hot day. The funk might limit it for me though."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is somewhat limited for me, as with other brett brews. Overall, I really enjoy a good brett infused saison, and this one doesn't dissapoint. Very nice, and one that I would love to sip on a hot summer day. Skal."
"D - This beer is fantastic with a year+ of age. It really doesn't get 'there' prior to that."
"D: Great drinkability. Wish I could have one every night this summer."
"Drinkability - Extremely so. A very good beer and am thankful I was able to try this thanks to Alex."
"This is just another American brett beer. As such, it's fine. As a saison, it's lousy. Boulevard's Tank 7 is a much better example."
"This is just about as good as it gets. I had a little sip of this at a tasting and I just had to get my hands on a bottle. Now I wish I would have traded for more than one. I would recommend this beer to anyone who even remotely enjoys a saison. Boulevard might be my favorite brewery that isn't available in my area."
"Drinkability: again, extremely drinkable, especially for a beer of this ABV. I admit that sometimes saisons can be a drag on my palate when the flavors start to accumulate, but the brett here does a great job of ameliorating this. Likewise, the funk helps reduce the pucker factor ... just a super drinkable brew."
"D: The more I drink good Saisons, the more I fall in love with them. If available to me regularly, I would certainly drink this a lot over time. The spicy, tart fruit, hop combo in this beer really floats my boat."
"I'll be honest. I didn't want to like this beer. Boulevard has made some excellent beers, and I guess I'm just jealous. I should be happy as they're taking craft brews and putting a very unique spin on them. Nice job Boulevard. Dammit!"
"Could use a slight bit more carbonation to give a nice zing at the end. Overall, a damn fine beer. Very very easy drinking."
"D: I'm glad I finally got to try this legendary brew. I've had Boulevard's regular saison before so this was naturally the next step, shame I had to wait 10 months. Not life changing, but a very well made domestic saison."
"This is a very solid beer, even excellent. However, at least for me, I preferred the Tank 7 saison. One thing I'll say, it's apparent that Boulevard knows what they're doing when it comes to making saison style beers."
"I would enjoy it with a healthier dose of brett, nevertheless it is a pleasant merge of Saison and wildness."
"Overall, this is a very well done saison. I've only ever had this vintage, but it seems that some age has probably added to the complexity of this beer and adding another year or two could pull out the brett even more. The flavor and body is a bit lighter than the standard Fantome offering, but it's still quite good overall. Probably my #3 or #4 saison. Nice work Boulevard."
"It's a Saison and it's really very average. I'd happily drink it as long as someone else is paying for it. I'd have never known there was Brett in this beer if you didn't tell me. Boring in the grand scheme of things. If you like Saisons I guess it's worth a try but at the price, I can find much better examples of the style."
"a saison with a punch. this was surprisingly big. color was a little deeper than the expected than the straw yellow orange. a murky orange. nose of a saaz farmhouse funk and a imperial fruit. palate of american hopped pepper that makes it first of all astringent. not particularly herbal. or as much as i would expect with the nose. the result is a tad sweet. it has a nice funk but the decedents of the hoping makes it a bit hard on the palate. after a bottle i made my gums swell. good... feel the american imperialization of world beer. too much alcohol. not as reserved and broad as Avec Les Bons Voeux..."
"Pours a hazy yellow color with a big white head. Smell is lemons, earthy hops, and some spices. Taste is lemons, spices, brett, and a slight hop bitterness. Medium mouthfeel, and medium carbonation. Overall im glad I finally got to try this beer."
"Flavor is very unique. It has the standard ""Saison"" flavors and complexity, but instead of the sweater versions, the Brettanomyces really alter that approach. On the other hand, the Brett isn't as ""brett-like"" sours...but adds an interesting sharp, grainy, earthy, funky characteristic. Some spices are noticable, light crisp citrus fruit, low booze, high carbonation. Medium to light body. This beer definitely should be drank above fridge temp. Overall though, it's very refreshing!"
" taste is very smooth, as expected from this style,with some lemon and rose flavors coming out. very nice, I could drink tis a while. Dont let it get too warm though as it tends to head south. bottle mentions earthiness, but I honestly dont taste it at all. overall a damn good beer. Those that dont typically like Belgians, like me, this is a nice bridge... go find some, it is worth it."
"Saison-Brett is yet another masterful creation in the Smokestack Series from BBC. It looks like this will be at least a semi-regular release, which pleases me to no end. If you have any interest in saisons or wild ales, seek this one out."
"I was a bit worried when I bought this since I'm not a huge fan of the idea of a sour beer but this one is not really sour. It's more about the citrus and hops and the brett adds to the complexity."
"Re-reviewed on 13may2010, 2009 batch, bottle 1997. This beer has grown on me since I've decided that I like funky beers, wild ales, and beer brewed with brett. This batch is still quite tasty, nicely funky, and downright delicious. Ratings adjusted slightly higher."
"The beer pours a hazy orange color with large white head. The beer was a mini-gusher. The aroma is strong brett with some citrus. The flavor is yeast, brett, citrus hops and a medium hop bitterness. High carbonation and medium, soft mouthfeel. A very nice beer that is a great example of what brettanomyces tastes like in a beer."
"D: This is a nice Saison. It's on the strong side for the style, but eminently drinkable. The brett adds a nice funk that brings extra complexity. A nicely done beer overall."
"Overall, a good saison and definitely worth picking up if you can find it."
"drinkability - excellent taste, refreshing, unique, complex"
"Drinkability: Off the charts"
"The highlight of this beer was pairing it with a 3-year cheddar. The cheese seemed to mellow out the phenols, and bring out the slightly funky/dirty flavors. This beer was such a treat!"
"Taste is exceptional. Certainly the musty yeast flavor is present but a generous dose of hops as well make this a very well-balanced ale. This will be purchased for special occasions, but budget permitting would drink often. Great beer. I'm a huge Hennepin fan and this one is right there, more a hoppy less funky version and great for a change of pace."
"Drinkability: This is an amazingly crafted and easily drinkable brew. It was an absolute pleasure to consume and as a whole, I really have few complaints. Its different elements blend together fairly amazingly. This is absolutely one of the best Boulevards that I have had to date, and is quite impressive--I would never guess the ABV."
"The Saison-Brett pours a golden straw color with the most head I have ever seen in a beer. A very gentle pour leaves a fist size head that slowly fizzes away. Lots of carbonation leads to the cork popping out and the aromas hit the nose immediately. Lots of earthy tones are first sniffed with some nice bananas and raisins lingering. Some alcohol is present in the aromas but not overpowering. After the head fizzles away, I finally got to take the first sip. Taste is unbelievably good. Plenty of yeast and breads with a semi dry finish. No alcohol is tasted. I would love to see how the yeast characteristics continue to develop with more aging. Mouthfeel is dry and medium bodied. Drinkability is good. Taste is right on queue. A very refreshing saison that can be enjoyed year round. I hope Boulevard continues this as one of their smokestack series brews."
"It pours a nice golden yellow, and the head is insane! By insane, I mean I poured into a pint glass, and half of the glass was head! So, after I let the head die down, I smell fruit and bananas and a little bit of clove, a lot of yeast and some sweetness, I love it! The taste is spicy, yeasty and citrusy, with some apples and a very little amount of funk, but it's delicious! The carbonation is too much, but if you age it I'm sure it will be okay. I could drink this all night long, good stuff!"
"I like Saisons with a touch of wild character, but this one was a tad too sweet."
"*Courtesy of fellow tasters"
"All in all, this brew definitely surprised me. This is the first Saison I've gotten to try and love it. The smell was a bit deceiving because it smelled like it might be flirting with the IPA, but the taste is something all of it's own. Very delicious!"
"Overall a tasty beer. Glad I got some. Seek this one out."
"This was my first Saison and I was thoroughly impressed. Looking forward to trying these again in the future. Thanks again Randy!"
"Poured from a 750ml bottle into my Russian River goblet. Right after I popped the cork I could smell the funky, barnyardy, aroma. Lots of Brett character even before getting it into the glass. The color is amazing, golden, and hazy, with a good deal of carbonation. My mouth is watering even before starting to taste. The taste itself if amazing. Smooth and funky all the way through. Thoroughly enjoyed this one. Very drinkable, so much so that if it wasn't so geographically difficult to get I would probably have a bottle on hand as often as I could. Overall, this is a fantastic representation of one of my favorite styles."
"D - This beer goes down wonderfully smooth for its 8.5% abv. Aging made it very smooth with subtle complexities."
"D - Not real hard to drink, but it's not enjoyable enough to do lots of. Not unpleasant by any means though."
"Overall, this was ok, expecting a little more."
"-Bye"
"M&D: Lighter bodied than I would have expected. It is, however, very flavorful. The best part is the finish. Dry and crisp, this is the perfect aperitif brew. It is very drinkable, and a great example of what Brett has to offer for those who are just getting into the style."
"This is definitely one of the better saisons I've ever tasted, extremely refreshing but also very complex. A home run from Boulevard."
"Overall this beer delivered what was promised. A very good saison with a hint of brett, well worth a shot."
"Overall not as impressed as I had hoped for, not enough wild strain here for me, at least."
"D - Delicious, light, and refreshing. A must-try for saison lovers."
"Overall, this is a delicious saison that is very nearly a great beer but is just missing that knockout element that a beer like Sofie had. Still, a strong beer and one of the better saisons out there."
"O- Quite amazing. I love the nice brett finish of the beer. I need more."
"d - Overall I enjoyed this saison a lot and thought it was very good. Having just tried the Fantome Saison today as well, I can say I liked that beer better and thought the sweet/sour combo was better done there, but this is still a very good beer. If you like that spice flavor you'd probably prefer this as well."
"D: Delightful. I like it a whole lot. Not the funkiest I've had. I'd say it is a good gateway to funk. I'd order another and buy this one again."
"overall a very nice farmhouse ale."
"It drank extremely well and this brew is back on my want list. Try this beer its is great"
"Reviewed on: 02-14-2010 07:28:06"
"Drinkability is where this shines. What's the ABV? 2 or 3? Holy smokes, for an 8.5, this is unheard of. Great enjoyable beer - quite a brilliant effort and a great way to start off a tasting!"
"M/D- Good. Great dry finish, clean and although I bitch about the Brett dominance, upon warming up, the hops here re-assert themselves with a wonderfull bitter in the aftertaste. Also hanging out for the after party, are nice bitter lemon yeast-hop notes. I have a hard time discerning taste vs. Mouthfeel notes on this beer, the two are so intertwined... I've misused the nomenclature in a review or 2, but this time, the mouthfeel DOES save this beer..."
"This is a new level for Boulevard. It smells funky, grassy, and fresh. It has green fruit flavors, and a perfect balance of funkiness and bitterness that leaves you with a dry lingering flavor reminiscent of Orval. It has a creamy mouthfeel with light effervescence. It melds a lot of strong flavors in a way that goes down really easy. I was amazed to see that it's 8.5%"
"Bottle: Poured a cloudy dark yellow color ale with a super huge foamy head with great retention and some great lacing as well. Aroma of fruity ester with lightly sweet malt and some dry Brett notes. Taste is also a well balanced mix between some lightly sweet malt with fruity ester and a dry Brett finish. Body is quite full with perfect carbonation and no apparent alcohol even though it is starting to feel like 8.9% after more then one glass. Well made though a tad too sweet for my taste."
"This is probably one of my favorite Saison's. Time did this beer alot of good. While i still loved this beer when it was new, i've enjoyed it alot more with some age on it and the brett obviously becomes more apparent with age as well."
"D: Easily the best Saison I've come across. I enjoyed that it was a bit more reserved on the pepper notes and had an increased level of fruit and dryness. A very solid beer and I'm glad I've got one of my own at home."
"Drank the whole 750 by myself and loved every sip. I have one more bottle thanks to hooliganlife which I can't wait to enjoy. Saisons are one of my favorite styles and this one is up there with the best. Highly recommended."
"Had the last bottle today, and with an extra year in it the brew holds beautifully. Brett character has developed nicely a bit. It feels softer and dryer and still makes for a remarkable brew."
"3.5 D: Good beer, very complex, just not my cup of tea (beer). I did enjoy it very much, and I have another bottle to age. Maybe it'll become better for me."
"Drinkability is still superb for all that carbonation - truly a testament to how amazing this brew is."
"I got this in a trade with mrkanable, batch number 2009-2. I poured from a 750ml bottle into a snifter. It is orange/hazy in color with a very saisonish fizzy white head. The aroma is earthy/musty with the slightest hint of lemon. The brett adds a nice earthiness to the flavor, much ""fuller"" than most saisons. The beer finishes very dry. What a great beer! My favorite saison to date."
"D: Dangerous drinkability, considering the strength. No problem knocking down a 750 ml bottle by myself."
"I struggle to find a reason not to score the drinkability a 5. I cannot come up with one factor that would make this more drinkable. The flavor and mouthfeel is everything I come to expect from the style. Alcohol is nonexistent to the tongue. If available to me on a regular basis I would purchase often."
"A mix of strong lactic and citric acid with a really full back funk and musk. There is also a slight sweetness. This wasn't as sour as I was expecting. The other batches may be slightly sour. Overall the body was thin and the mouthfeel was fine. Overall, its a good beer."
"D: One glass was plenty for me. A nice beer that has potential to be awesome. I'm anxious to sample a more recent batch to compare and contrast against this one."
"Poured a straw yellow color with good carbonation. Nose is floral, grass, funky and musty. Taste is horseblanket,straw, hay, grassy, light and a bit of booze. Lemon and fruits shine from beginning to end but very subtle. Mouthfeel is slight tinge of booze. Pretty good overall."
"D- High. I'll take a case of this, please. I could see this as a good, unoffensive beer to introduce to someone just dipping their toes in belgian-style beers. That being said, there's enough flavor and complexity to this one to keep the novice and the hardcore alike coming back. I will seek this beer out and drink it again.. truly awesome!"
"It keeps you coming back for more, well at least until the bottle is empty."
"A lovely beer - refreshing and easy to drink but still lots of character."
" I'll update my review in a year or two"
"D - the funk and malt almost even out, i wish the brett was more dominating the taste"
"An interesting beer from Boulevard. I was expecting a bit more from this after having had the regular saison, and it was a bit of a letdown. Still a nice beer though."
"Well balanced with nothing really overpowering and not a huge complex nature. Straightforward and very quaffable. Nice brett addition just adding that bit of tart sourness that brings forth the spicy character of the saison. White pepper, lemon, and wild berries. Yeasty flavors with a crisp clean finish. Nice amount of acidity as well."
"D: I would be interested in trying another batch perhaps? I didn't get the sweetness or funk/tartness I was craving from the style. The look and mouthfeel are damn impressive. All in all a good beer."
"Very good beer and perhaps the best saison I've ever had. I'm really looking forward to revisiting this beer with some age on it, because I think more prominent brett characteristics could take it to another level."
"Overall, one of the most interesting takes on a saison I have ever had. Really like this and recommend it highly."
"Drinkability is very high. Overall this is a beer that just doesn't have many flaws to it. This is about as good as the saison style gets."
"One of the best Saisons out there and it's priced really well too. I'm really looking forward to trying the bottles I have in the cellar to see how this beer ages. I plan on finishing the rest of this bottle tonight and I can't help but think that this a great beer to start the new year with."
"Mouthfeel was medium in body and had moderate carbonation."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with lots of foamy carbonation. Drinkability is high due to the refreshing nature of the taste, but like with more funky beers I am more than satisfied with 12 oz. Very solid beer, highly recommended."
"Originally for http://theiasfbeardedbrewers.blogspot.com/2009/12/boulevard-saison-brett.html"
"Poured into a tulip which quickly formed a monsrously huge white head. Cloudy orange-yellow beer with good levels of lacing and retention. Normally I would not describe saisons or brettanomyces as smelling amazing, but Saison-Brett's nose is absolutely off the charts. Sweet lotus blossoms, rose petals, hibiscus, and various flora made for one of the best saison aromas I have experienced. The beer itself tasted of dried apples, spicy cloves, and a very light level of funk. The flavor was good, but honestly the aroma is what makes this beer. The mouthfeel is also spot on, super creamy medium carbonation and a nice light body. This beer looks, smells, and feels amazing, just too bad the taste may be the weakest link here (though it is still good)."
"D: Goes down very well. It grew on me immensely as it warmed. I'd love to have more, but I think they need to tweak the brett a bit."
"Opinion: This beer has been a pleasure to drink. I must say that it has broadened my horizons as far as Boulevard beers go. I mean, I like their Bully Porter and such, but this beer borders on outstanding. It is visually very well represented with solid and diverse aroma and flavor profiles. What more can you ask for? All this said, there is no way in heck that I would put it up there with the top of the Dupont heap of Saisons, but this is a solid offering from an American brewery. I would recommend it."
"D - This is an interesting take on a saison. I really enjoyed it and can understand why it is so highly sought after. It definitely kept my interest throughout. I have one more in the cellar and will see how this develops in time."
"Taste is of the aromas with a funky, lip smacking flavor that is authentic farmhouse style saison."
" D- This is a beautiful beer. The full fragrant flavor has a nice complexity with some bright fruity flavors and crispness. This is a great beer now and I will have to try this aged to see how the brett flavors come out."
"75cl bottle shared by Diomede. Opaque gold with yeast chunks floating around and a white, frothy head. The aroma is just straightforward citrus and brett with lots of lemon peel, grass, and hay. Not really intense though, and seemed to dissipate after awhile, needing a top-up to kick back into action. The flavor is relatively clean for a saison, but gets all the nuances in there, with dry malt flavors, soft yet spicy bitterness and hop flavors, and a nice light bretty funk. Medium-light body with higher carbonation and smooth bubbles. Nothing really amazing about it, but it is no doubt a quality and well constructed saison. Everything balances out to make an exceptionally drinkable beer, especially considering the alcohol content. I'm not sure how old this bottle was, but it did have a relatively bright, fresh quality to the flavor and aroma, so maybe more time in the cellar would add some interesting stuff to it with the yeast developing a little more. Definitely worth seeking out again."
"Bottle courtesy of Diomede. Pours a very cloudy goldenrod color with a wet off-white head. Aroma is pungent with brett and sharp spices. Fruity with apples and lemons, with some cinnamon and pepper notes as well. Flavor starts off with tart lemon, hay, grass, and dried stone fruit, then melds into a sweet honey/vanilla note before finishing dry, clean, and earthy. Nice soft mouthfeel, complex yet drinkable."
"Overall: Impressive smell, and for style the brett inegrates well."
"Drinkability: Great dinner beer or just sitting and relaxing beer. It is very easy to finish the bottle."
"drinkability - no matter what time of year or what the weather is i could drink this beer"
"D: It's almost indescribable how nice and tasty this beer is, really no need to get overly flowery with descriptions here. If you see this beer buy it, it stacks up with any other saison out there today."
"Update - as I've gotten more in to funky beers, I've really started to see that this one is world class. I've updated my ratings accordingly."
"Not sure what the Brett effect is but this is a very interesting beer."
"Very nice drinkability, best drinking saison yet."
"Excellent beer that I've been wanting to try for awhile now and finally get the chance thanks to Fugazme."
"I really enjoyed this one. I think I am going to get another bottle or two to age. Well worth seeking out."
"It is, as you may imagine, nicely carbonated."
"This is a medium-bodied beer on the heavier side carbonation-wise. Feels great in the mouth and going down. A little too easy to drink for an 8.5% ABV brew; I didn't notice the alcohol at all. Biggest concern is figuring out why I decided to share this bottle in the first place..."
"Had a bottle of this with friends, soon after it first the Portland, Oregon market. The colour was a slightly cloudy goldenrod. The aroma was nicely spicy and moderately yeasty. On the palate... there was lots of carbonation with a nice hop bite as well. Some nice complexity with the yeast and a medium finish. Quite nice!"
"Light in body with very high carbonation, this is pretty much how I like my saisons. With a great finish, this is thoroughly drinkable, and I'm going to enjoy drinking the rest of this bottle."
"D: Incredibly drinkable for 8.5%! No idea it is there and never suspect it. Very easy to put down this 750...dangerous, but delicious!"
"Heavy carbonation, and medium bodied, the alcohol is well hidden for 8.5%. I could drink this again and again."
"Bottle # 106 out of 13400 - 2009-2. Cork was in there real good but when it popped out the aroma was strong. A mix of fruits but nothing specific and has that wonderful Belgian aroma. The taste is much like the aroma but more hops and a bite at the end. I keep getting a sour apple taste just before the hops and pepper take over. It has a the earthy feel nailed and I bet would be even stronger over time. I can't get over the finish on this one. You keep thinking sweet but the spice like finish is great. The carbonation is a bit much but expected. This is a really good Saison and the Brett takes it to another level. I think the Tank 7 is the only better offering I've had from Boulevard. Can't wait for that one in bottles."
"D - Super-easy to drink. I could finish this whole thing by myself, but I was nice and had to share with the g/f. Glad I live close to a bunch of this to pickup whenever I want."
"drinkability: good, but feels big for a saison"
"This was just as good as I'd hoped it would be, definitely a testament to Boulevard's brewers."
"D - Lots of alcohol, but can't detect it. Pretty good beer, but not world class."
"D= Very balanced and yet incredibly flavorful. The ABV is shockingly hidden, making this a dangerous brew. I know the Earth will shake when I say this, but I think I liked this better than Orval. Certainly a world class beer."
"Picked up the last bottle at Princeton Liquors for around $12. I was a big fan of the Saison and this didn't disappoint. Unlike Victory's Wild Devil brett-infused beer, this brett beer provided great complexity of flavor and balance. The brett provides a slightly tart licorice taste with earthy and herbal notes. The original saison still pulls through with the light and crisp bready malt and hints of white chocolate and vanilla. This is a well-made beer and certainly worth a try."
"Can't say enough about Saison-Brett. The best American-made Saison...maybe the best American-made Belgian."
"This is a great offering from Boulevard, we're lucky that it just came to the area. It's got a nice golden color with big head/lacing/retention. From the smell I get a bit of the brett funkiness, some apple, some clove, and a bit of leafy and floral hops. Taste is great, it's not over-the-top with the brett, balances nicely with some citrus (lemons?), a bit tart, some leafy hops again, some apple. Definitely a subtle sipper. A real nice saison, however. MF is good, with a light body and moderate carbonation. A bit prickly, which I like. Drinkability is also good--ABV is nicely masked in this one."
"I am sooo happy that we have access to Boulevard... I will be getting a few of these before they're gone... I think some time in the cellar will do well and only add to an already great beer."
"750ml bottle: This one opened with a very loud ""pop", but didn't overflow at all. This one poured a hazy golden color. There was a large, fluffy head that leaves some nice lacing. The aroma is nicely balanced. Brett, pineapple, other fruits, earthy, some citrus, hint of spice. Interesting taste. The first thing that hits you is a bit of sourness, and then a little bitterness. Medium body. Earthiness, a little yeast, citrus among the other flavors. Nice!"
"D- This is a very drinkable beer that I wish I could have at least once a day. Nice for people who want to try the style but don't go to the extreme. I only wish this was a couple of dollars cheaper...haha."
"D= great I can't put this beer down. Its so light and smooth. Highly recommended. Good saison and the brett just makes it that much better."
"I want to drink this every day, now if I could only justify that $10 a day to the lady."
"A traditional saison base followed by light brett funk."
"D: ABV isn't out of hand and this is a tasty, drinkable brew."
"Solid beer."
"D: What makes this beer so incredible is how everything melds together. Each facet compliments the one both preceding and following it. Amazing levels of spice, funk, fruit, and hops."
"D- Very nice, solid and tasty. A well done combination of the spicy saison melding with the brett tartness. Easy to drink and flavourful."
"Caught in the magic of the moment by this great ale, I noted the allure was highlighted by the ale not being sour, though a combination of tart and sweetness did prevail. Overall, a great bottle as a peer to the best in its style."
"D- Very delicious, alcohol hidden well."
"D - Not overly sour or tart at all, with more of the saison characteristics shining through than the Brett. Fruity and sweet, yet fairly complex, this is one of the better Boulevard released I've had."
"Drinkability: Only the abv keeps it from scoring higher in this department."
"Finally! My first white whale, so to speak. I haven't been in the beer game terribly long (long enough to review 300 beers) but this is the first beer that eluded me for over a year. As the second batch finally made it to Minnesota, I bought a couple bottles, one to drink one to cellar. I now see I'm going to need much much more. I thank Boulevard for making such a fantastic beer, and for distributing it to Minnesota. Cheers!"
"D- Pretty drinkable, the 750 disappeared quick. Maybe not my favorite saison but probably the best beer brewed with brett I've had."
"Overall: This is what I would call ""A Nice Beer", but nothing spectacular. Cheers!"
"D: Quite drinkable and very refreshing on a hot summer evening."
"Saison - Brett is a terrific American interpretation of a saison. Tasty, refreshing and appetite whetting, it makes for a perfect treat on a warm fall day."
"D: Truly deserving of its current title of best saison. Do whatever it takes to get some of this."
"Taste is very sharp, brett is strong but it's really good. There saison/barnyard flavors really start to come through. Great mouthfeel and carbonation gives it a solid finish."
"D: Just a bit of a let down on 'drinkability', mainly because of the big 8.5% abv. Not the refreshing, rustic quencher of a 'traditional' saison; instead it's thicker and good bit more boozy, a definite sipper. Would definitely have this again, but need ample time and help. Overall, it's among the best of the style I've had (despite being Americanized/Imperialized) ... highly recommended."
"D. Incredibly easy to drink. I tried cleansing my palate several times while drinking this beer so I could experience that amazing array of flavors on the first drink. This beer is delicous!"
"D - This beer is great on its own, but I really think it deserves to be paired with food, particularly a good selection of cheeses. With food, I think I could drink this all night. The 750ml bottle is not really hanging around very long though - it is going down very easily on its own. Really liking this - saisons are one of my favorite styles...this one really stands out as a great one."
"Had a bottle from the second batch of the year and found apricot aroma was much more prominent."
"hey, i'm usually not a fan of big phenols, but this one manages to pull it off ok. still cuts back on overall drinkability ever so slightly tho."
"If you stumble on to one of these, try regardless of the price. Its great."
"D: In one word this beer is amazing. The sour is just so well placed and the Brett doesn't overpower the Saison. It just has a touch of that sour goodness coming across, but it is just enough to add a new dynamic to this beer. So funky with a nice and light sourness. The flavors, aromas and look are great. Just a delight of a summer/hot weather beer. My only gripe is lower the ABV a bit, it doesn't need all that. Thanks, Mason. this was amazing."
"Pours a cloudy golden peach color, visibly effervescent, with suspended particulate and a foamy white two finger head that resists fading, leaving sheets of Belgian lacing behind. The smell is complex and nothing short of amazing! Sweet, fruity, apple, pear, and earthy yeast. The mouth feel is equally unique and rewarding. Bright yet creamy with effervescent texture, medium bodied. Full flavored, the fruity harvest celebration mixed with a well balanced tartness kicks up ""Saison"" to levels only imagined by Emeril Lagasse yet the earthen fruity sweetness l""coats"" and lingers really well. Seriously, 'Farmhouse Ales' haven't been my Fav...but this has to be one of the best beers that i've ever had...""period"". The total package is amazing..nose. texture, flavor and drinkability. Cheers to Team Boulevard! This one is outta here...i'm talk'in WOW, different planet good. This one is beyond a doubt one of the best beers that I've ever experienced!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"
"D: By the end of the bottle, the brett character simply overwhelmed(underwhelmed?) me. Very nice for a glass, but the refill did me in which is surprising considering my affinity for large bottles of saison."
"D - Worth the hype. Fans of hoppy, funky saisons, this is your type of brew. I'd pair this brew with a fresh goat's milk cheese, with a grilled cheese sandwich for lunch, or with spicy mexican food."
"Available in several places in KC, seemed to be priced a few bucks more then the other Smokestack series offerings. Large bottle, caged and corked with batch and which bottle of the batch info. Pours cloudy and dull peach, the head initially is HUGE, overflowing if not poured with care. then turning to loose merainge, then thick film and leaving gobs of thick lace. Nice looking beer. The nose also is outstanding with pungent notes of lime, pepper, tropical fruits and Belgian style intrigue that even my challanged sniffer can fully appreciate. The good stuff continues onto the tongue, more lemon and lime, pepper, ripe fruit and also a moderate ssour note adding to the complexity and interest. Real nice stuff. Saison of the highest order. I Should have bought a few more bottles of this elixir. If you can get this on a regular basis, you have been blessed by the beer gods."
"750 ml bottle purchased online for around twelve dollars, forgot where I got this, drank on Sunday, reviewed from notes, served in my Duvel tulip glass, color is a bright golden orange, 1 1/2 inch fizzy white head that does not last long, not much lacing either, aroma consists of tartiness, sweet malts, funk, lemons, sour apples, grains, brettanomyces, oranges, grass, and mustiness, flavor starts off with citrusy fruits and a little bit of the wild yeast feel, pale malts in the middle, finish is dry with funky orange and chewier malts, pretty rustic overall, crisp even once it warms, sharp, citrusy, and dry mouthfeel, medium bodied, lots and lots of carbonation, taste lingered pretty well, pretty easy to get down, alcohol is only noticed when it warms, it is not hot or anything but shines through a little along with some sweetness, not my favorite saison but the brettanomyces helps things out in a number of ways, will probably cellar my other bottle for at least a year and see what happens, worth trying"
"Overall a very interesting and successful beer. One that I would never have expected from Kansas City. Also one that I wouldn't mind seeking out again."
"D - This truly complex beer does belong atop the BA list and is a must drink for everyone. At first I didn't know what to expect and the more I drink of this the more I go out and buy another one. Just reviewing this makes me want to stop on the way home and grab another."
"I'm so glad that I let this bottle develop. I can't imagine a better time than now to crack open a bottle of the original batch if you have one lying around. I don't think that its possible for the beer to get better than it is right now. A revelation."
"Drinkability: Give it a try! Boulevard's standard saison was all-well and fine, but the kind addition of Brett really helps it to sing."
"Drinkability: I was never a Brett-head, but I think I might be now. This beer is amazing, and rightfully holds the top saison place on BA. At 8.5%, it occupies the upper range of a style known to defy definition, and it definitely continues in that fine trend. This one is just so damn complex, but not only complex - it's easily complex, and allows itself to be teased apart with no complications whatsoever because of its balance. As a result, it's enjoyable, easy-drinking, and I can see how it could have an appeal to most everyone who enjoys good beer. I'm not sure what age might do to this one, but I wouldn't mind it if Boulevard made a few more batches of this and I was fortunate enough to get the opportunity to find out. Cheers to them for making a truly stellar brew and my (now) favorite saison."
"I definitely was impressed by this creation from Boulevard. I sure do hope to get a chance to try this again."
"Overall, this is an outstanding brew. Highly recommended."
"Reviewed on 06/05/2009. Bottle shared at PPRBSG09. This beer pours a cloudy yellow with a small white head. The aroma and flavor are of tropical fruits, yeast, and light spices. Wow, this is very smooth and dry, easy drinking. I need to get more of this..."
"GI should make Matilda a year-round release, and Boulevard should make this a year-round release, and then we should all just chill out and drink these a lot. It'd be the best rivarly in the history of American beer. People would picnic more often and find excuses to go on bike rides, hummingbirds would alight on the fists of dying women and the moon would smile so wide it would cry."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a huge white head. The head slowly settles to a thick cap. Carbonation bubbles coninously rise long after the pour. THin lacing is left on the glass. Has a very funky and earthy smell. Horseblanket aroma. The Brettanomyces aroma is so pungent, no Saison qualities are detected. Again the Bretttanomycyes dominates the flavor. Funky and earthy. Just hints of a Saison spiciness and fruit on the finish. Maybe if I tried this sooner after bottling I would of enjoyed it more. Light body with lively, almost effervesant carbonation. Fits pefectly with the wild nature of this beer. As a wild ale it is very good. As a Saison, not so much. Hardly any Saison qualities still exist. Still a good ale."
"D: Super easy drinking. This was much better than their normal saison which is a good beer."
"D: Easy enough to drink at 8.5%, almost deceptive, good beer, I hope they make this again. Highly recommended."
"Huge pop, almost killed my buddy grub as the cork came out, I think it went into their neighbors yard. Pours a cloudy orange, almost a pineapple juice colour, loose white head forms, drops to a thick ring and leaves a ton of lace all over the glass. Smell is real neat, pineapple, very tropical, mangoes, hay, honey, really funk, some earthy sourness, fruit, barnyardy, really cool. Taste is good too, lots of pineapple up front, very tropical like the aroma, mango, hay and honey, grassy, barnyard funk and horse blanket, fruit, sharp and acidic. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with really high carbonation, it works with this one though. Kind of lemony and tart going down, probably the closest in flavour to an Orval I've ever had. This stuff is the dope! Thanks Randy!"
"750mL bottle shared with rtratzlaff poured into two Brooklyn tulips a hazy orange with a thin diminishing head. Aroma was a nice blend of sweet malt, spice and a hint of brett sourness. The taste was more well balanced with the brett funk blending nicely with the sweet malts and spice. The beer is medium bodied with its alcohol well hidden. This is a very unique and enjoyable beer."
"Sampled at the Power Plant Strong Ale Fest and many bottles there after. Hazy straw color with a white head. Lots of citrus and hay aromas, with subtle brett. Fruity. Lemony. The brett character is a perfect compliment for this style. Medium body with pleasant carbonation."
"Drinkability? Can you guess? Full flavoured, wonderfully flavoured, not inhibited by its 8.5% abv at all, this is another dangerously drinkable brew and a sheer joy to drink. A top notch Saison in my book and not even close to being an overrated brew. See some, get some!"
"drinkability is great. excellent balance, hiding almost all of its alcohol. great mix of saison and lightly funky brett character. i love the regular saison from boulevard, and this just brings it up another notch. great stuff."
"I have had this beer numerous times, and it is one of my favorites in the Smokestack series. The Bright gold-yellow body is covered by a thick, creamy head that was created with a not too agressive pour into a wine glass. The foam settles down to a 1/4 inch thick cap that remains until the end. In the nose I get wonderful fruity spicy and funky aromas. The beers flavors pretty much match its aromas, but with a hint of sweetness that help create balance. It also displays a really appealing fruity tartness. The finish is long, dry, tart, and a bit bitter. The mouthfeel is medium-full, but with active carbonation that kind of sets the flavors dancing around my mouth. Boulevard Saison-Brett is nicely drinkable, and as it warms, and the carbonation settles, it becomes more-so."
"D: The higher alcohol content never rears its head. That plus that lemony citrus and bretty funk make me never want to put this glass down. A top-notch saison."
"D: Surprisingly balanced. Even saison and Brett."
"M/D - Very well carbonated and lively in the mouth. Tartness balanced my the sweet and bitter fruit notes and spiciness blend into a very refreshing beer. Not a Brett bomb by any stretch, just clean and refreshing."
"D: Outstanding beer. I would love to have a few of these to age over time and compare. Looks like I'll have to look for a few more."
"Overall, a nice funky saison with good brett and sweet fruits to complement it. It definitely improves a lot as it warms."
"Straw/gold with a huge off white head that was unstoppable, but eventually faded. I'm in an open field in the countryside and the wind is blowing aromas of dandelions, white pepper, moldy wild fruits, esters, some dead insect guts into my nose. The brett is very potent- and beautifully so. Peppery and spicy throughout with a great funk flavor that isn't to intense in any one way- It's Diverse and lets many different flavors shine. Very drinkable, the only comment I could make would maybe be to say that it has a slightly higher carbonation than would be appropriate. One of the surprises of the tasting to me. ISO?"
"Drinkability is pretty good, but I'm not one to session brett beers. I'd rather pay less for their regular saison. Still, a well done example of a brett saison, Boulevard once again comes through with a very authentic offering."
"d: i really enjoyed the mix and balance of this brew and it reminds me of a good bubbly wine"
"This is an insanely complex and dry beer; much drier than most Saisons, but I like it this way. For such complexity the beer also comes across cleanly and pure- seems to be a controdiction of character: not so in this beer."
"Lots of carbonation in the mouthfeel that could have been taken down a few notches. Otherwise it is smooth and warming. Really glad I had a chance to sample this one thanks to Dave and glad no one got hit by the cork :-)"
"Yep, this is one of the best IMO. I have had this several times now, and each one is a treat. Do not pass this by. Highly recommended."
"750ml bottle $12.50. Nice hazy yellow with a super active head that refuses to die down. Nice smell, bretty without being farm-like smells quite lemony. The flavor is a lot more lemon but not sour at all, mouthfeel was good and this beer was incredibly easy to drink. This may be the best Boulevard beer I have had thus far."
"D: Not bad, not my favorite, but good."
"D - Wonderfully refreshing. This is one of the better beers I've consumed recently and I'd love another bottle next time this one's brewed. Very well done."
"Overall: Pretty good drinkability, really nice aroma and the flavors are similar but a bit less. I really like the tartness that is present from the brett, but would some like more of it."
"Can't remember if I received this one from DbHog or brewczar, but grateful for the opportunity. Bottle number 1338 out of 11950 (2008 vintage) served in my Allagash tulip. Poured a pale orange-gold with a bright white head and webs of lacing. Clarity changes from fairly translucent to hazy over the course of the tasting. Nose is pretty mild - a little medicinal and some phenols. Taste follows nose - medicinal, minty and some citrus. Mouthfeel is light and lively and clean finishing. Really drinkable brew. Alcohol is well-hidden. A really solid farmhouse, but I was anticipating some funk and additional complexity given the brett."
"Silky smooth body is delicately carbonated. Great stuff, right up there with the best in the world."
"Overall, really impressed with this one. One of the best saisons I have had. My only negative was that there was a little too much carbonation. We will see how this tastes with some age on it."
"Drinkability: This is a very good Saison. Boulevard always seems to outdo itself where these Belgian beers are concerned. The 8.5% ABV is not overbearing, and this is definitely a bottle that we'll be finishing. I can't wait to pick up a few more to cellar for the next few years."
"this brew pours up an opaque golden yellow with a decent white head. the nose is very nice! bready, yeasty, subtle lemon, you can smell the brett, hay. the taste is very badass! its the same as the nose but more intense on the brett and lemons, very earthy, full bodied, low zesty carbo. This is a phenomenal beverage!"
"overall a very nice brew...im glad i have another to age for a while and see what the brett does to it.."
"Drinkability- This is a really nice brew. One of the tastiest Saisons I've come across yet in my fairly limited Saison journey. Although I loves me some Brett I think this brew is perfect right now. The fruitiness of the hops are what makes the beer in my opinion. Not sure how many Saisons are dry hopped but more should be. Might have to find one more bottle for aging purposes but I can guarantee I wont like it more than this. Thanks Joe!"
"Tasty and well balanced, this is a good saison, but where's the brett? Maybe I should have bought the brettless version for $4 less, or aged this one."
"Medium bodied, well balanced but overall uninteresting combination of sweetish malts, minimal tartness, grainy. I kept looking for signs of Brett, and had to use my imagination more than my palate."
"Pours light golden with a massive soapy white head. The head releases an enticing aroma of sweet citrus and brett earthiness. Taste- brett plays a big role in this brew- very very dry, some alcohol heat, and lots of barnyard. Leather, rope, spice. There is still some fruity sweetness from the malt. Reminds me a lot like Jolly Pumpkin product. Mouthfeel is spritzy from the high carbonation. Drinkability is good, but my only complaint is the booziness."
"I could drink this one until I die"
"When we opened the cork we got an explosive reaction. This beer was ready to get out of the bottle. The first few ours were very foamy but once it settled down we got a nice balance of beer and head. One comment was the head looked like meringue. We were drinking from nucleated glasses and it looked like the bubbles were dancing the glass. It was certainly full bodied with deep citrus notes. Spicy and bitter but no aftertaste."
"This is a really nice saison, and I think I like it a notch more than the original overall. They are both exceptionally drinkable, but the extra hoppiness and little bit of funky brett give this one an extra dimension. I wish I had another bottle or two to see how the brett continues to develop over time, because I'm sure the hops will fade a bit while the brett imparts more funky, tart character. Maybe I can blackmail Adam with threats of releasing his big secret in order to obtain another bottle..."
"An interesting beer to say the least. Wouldn't go out of my way for it in the future."
"d: Thanks to barleywinebrewer for this one. The carbonation issues affected three of the scores above. A minor adjustment would make this world class."
"Taste/mouthfeel: Soft grain flavor with restrained fruitiness beneath it. Earthy, subdued yet complex, light citrusy zing. Ultra-dry on the palate. Slight husky grain in the finish. Not much brett yet, but it may develop more with age. Regardless, this is a phenomenal American saison."
"Stunningly focused and rounded, this is a really impressive Brett-laced saison. The Brett seems to just add to what's already there, rather than acting as the central focus. Well worth trying!"
"Overall this is not the best saison I have had but it is darn good. I really like what the brett adds to the flavor and aroma."
"Thanks goes out to Avalon68 for throwing in this awesome extra, which was on my wants list. This is batch #1 and is bottle number 5269 out of 11950. I decanted this beer in to a Stella Artois glass. First thing I note is that the head is massive, nearly three fingers worth of pillowy, fizzy white heading. Color is a radiant gold, with what looks like a chaotic amount of carbonation going on inside. The heading really doesn't seem to want to go down on this one. Aroma is of peaches, lemon grass, some barnyard funk, mild spices and something very earthy. First taste reveals a real array of flavors. Big bursts of orange zest and lemon come through along with a dry champagne flavor. Some chalky medicinal show up as well. The Brett presence is not nearly as apparent as in the taste as it is in the smell. The carbonation on this beer is amazing. It really scrubs the palate like no other beer I have had, with the exception of Duvel perhaps. The 8.5% alcohol is masked very well. It never comes off boozy, and in fact just becomes more drinkable as it warms up a bit. My final thoughts are that this is my first Boulevard beer, and that it is a real achievement. I can see why it has risen to the top of the ranks within the Saison style. One last thing, make sure to pair this with some type of food. I found it went well with some simple Muenster cheese, but I can see it complementing all sorts of dishes. Cheers"
"D - Wonderful blend of complex flavors. Glad I opened this when I did as the funk is at a very nice level right now. I hope I get to try more from this series."
"Light and refreshing, quite a bit different (better) from the regular saison."
"T,M & D = Actually less funky in the flavor than I expected from the smell. There is a strong lemon zest, lemon grass, spicy funk, but there is also a nice light white bread malt flavor and fullness that really fills this out. I think I might have actually preferred it a little funkier with less strong of a comforting malty, bready presence. On the other hand, it has a great medium weight that with the smooth creamy feel makes it an extremely pleasant drink if not quite what I was expecting in a Saison with Brett."
"Very drinkable, especially with a well-hidden alcohol content of 8.5% ABV."
"The aroma immediately reminds me of Orval. Low and behold, so does the taste! Orval being one of my favorites ever, I may be somewhat biased. What a masterfully brewed Craft Beer. Truly artisanal. Exceptional balance between mild Saison sweetness, earthy brett and solvent alcohol. However, the 8.5% is more than hidden, it is nearly nonexistent. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel, with a sharp and biting carbonation. This may just be the finest crafted American beer I have had. Hats off to Boulevard, this is a truly exceptional beer."
"The drink is very easy. Pretty expensive, like most top end beers, But worth the money, at least once, if not more."
"Overall, probably one of the best, if not the best, saisins that I have had. Easy to drink, ever so enjoyable. I wish it was easier to find, but I will just have to stock up on the next batch. I highly highly recommend."
"One of the best Saisons I've ever had... Extremely delicious and crisp..."
"D- A very drinkable brett beer. If you are looking to get into sour beers, then this one wouldn't be too offensive. I was really hoping for a mouth of funk, but I found it to be a bit too subdued."
"Pretty good drinkability, a solid and interesting beer."
"I am a huge fan of saisons, and this one might be the best I have had. Love this beers. Grab as much as you can.."
"Poured into a tulip a hazy golden yellow color, very nice carbonation, huge two-finger plus white foamy/fizzy head, with lots of sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with a good amount of yeast notes, some bananna, and corinader. The taste is very nice as well, malty, yeasty, nice notes of bannanas/corinader. Medium body, this one is not too spicy. Very drinkable, a joy to drink, thanks Tim."
"Poured from a 25 oz bottle into a glass. Poured with a golden yellow with a big head of white foam. Foam settled nicely after a bit. Beer had a slight musty smell, but was not overwhelming. This beer had good drinkability, but probably should have let it age a few more months for best taste. Overall, a pretty good beer."
"A-4.0 S-3.5 T-4.0 M-4.0 D-3.5"
"Drinkability: A terrific Saison that will be interesting to follow as it ages and the Brett does its work; for my palate, it is drinking beautifully right now (as it is after some age, though in a very different way)"
"One of my favorite Saisons. Sometimes, a 750ml bottle is just too much. This was not one of those times. I savored this beer to the last drop. A must-try Saison from Boulevard."
"this seems funkier than the first couple of times i tried this beer. if i'm not mistaken the brett character grows stronger with age so that could explain it. the brett may be a tad aggressive but essentially a real game-changing product for this brewery. really exciting stuff coming out of kansas city."
"One of the better new-world Saisons I've encountered. A bit of everything...the floral and piney hops (subtle, but they're there...especially with warmth) mesh with the dry oak to leave a lasting impression. Savor this one - surprisingly it doesn't drink entirely quickly. Still, it's awesome."
"Thanks a lot Tim. Best state-side saison I have had the pleasure of, hell, it is there with any saison I've had touch my lips."
"Pours a hazy sunny yellow with a cloud like bright white head that never really seems to die down. Spiderwebs cling everywhere on the sides of the glass, this is a great lookin' brew. Aroma is a wonderful blend of pepper, lemongrass, and good ol' Brett. Faint citrus and a good dose of the farm in the nose as well. Just a pleasant fresh bouquet of everything I was hoping for. Taste begins clean with a dash of sweet apple and pear followed by dry hay and spicy pepper. Midway is pretty grassy with a good amount of sour lemon. Aftertaste is lip smacking good, bready and sweet, just a great tasting Saison from start to finish. Mouthfeel is the only area that seems to suffer, but I say that loosely because it still got a 4 from me. Light and fluffy with a carbonation that's a bit too strong, but still not bad at all. Wow, I need more of these puppies as soon as possible. Just an easy drinking full flavored saison that's leaps and bounds above the rest. Get your hands on this one for sure, now."
"This beer pours a cloudy pale bright orange color. The head is a huge three inches in height. It looks like a cloud on top of the beer. Retention is great with foam sticking all over the glass until long after the beer in gone. The aroma is of barnyard funk, wet wool, leather, oranges, sour apples, and the huge sour/tartness only bretta can provide. The aroma is very beautiful. It is so complex and so strong that I find myself losing myself in it. The taste is a bit mellower than the aroma. It has more the the saison characteristics (e.g. barnyard funk, leather, wet wool), and not as much of the bretta. It is still very nice, but it lacks to wow power the aroma has. The mouthfeel is overly carbonated which seems to get in the way of the taste. Overall, this is a very, very good beer. I truly hope I have another opportunity to drink it"
"A solid tastying brett inspired saison from boulevard. This one oppened with a solid pop but no gushing. I'm looking forward to how this develops with another year on it."
"It's not the most complex saison ever, but the subtle perfume notes that so overwhelmed the brett-less saison here play delightful second-fiddle to a boldly constructed brett forward flavor. A great introduction, a great saison, a great beer. More, please."
"Overall this was a fantastic beer. It was subtle, wonderfully balanced and perfectly placed. I was not blown away as much as I was really impressed and respecting the wonderful creativity that was put into this one. If only more subtly created and well balanced beers like this were made, we would be in a much better place."
"Edit July 24, 2009: This is the best Saison I have ever had!"
"Thanks to tytoanderso for throwing this in as an extra in a trade. What a fantastic discovery - this is one of the better beers I've had. Pours hazy straw lemon color with big white head. Smells and tastes light, lemon, yeast, pears, and not too dry. Brett funk is present, but well under control. It plays a role but doesn't overbear."
"A benchmark beer. Exactly what a saison should be."
"D: Easy to down the whole bottle. ABV gets in the way, but, thats a burden I'm willing to shoulder. Another fantastic brew!"
"Now that I’ve had the pleasure of having this a few times, I would definitely say it’s a great beer, though not my favorite. I might even like Sofie more than this, but Tank 7 reigns as supreme saison in my book."
"Love this stuff. Out of all the Smokestack brews, I was looking forward to this one the most. It didn't disapoint."
"Similar to an Orval-Duvel-Saison Dupont hybrid, with a pleasant soft citrus in the taste. Light spicy undercurrent, almost suggests cinnamon like Orval. Dry bread dough yeastiness from the Brett. Very full bodied, yet lightly tart and lemony with a dry finish. Long lingering aftertaste. Savory and quenching with boatloads of flavor, it would be a crowd pleaser at a springtime picnic."
"Gorgeous straw golden color to this one. Very clean looking. Three fingers of foam on top-looks like an ice cream soda. Fantastic aroma-it just poured out of the bottle once the cork was ""popped"". Sweaty/bready/yeasty all rolled into one. Deep black peppery bite to it. Just a great flavor-a perfect balance between sweet and sour. Very smooth and subtle maltiness. The sweaty aroma runs right into the flavor. Very pleasing spicy bite to it. No real hop bite but the spiciness makes up for it and accentuates the whole thing. Good mouthfeel-the lingering dryness is never out done as there is still a decent sweetness behind it all. Wow what a beer! I think this might be the first brett beer I have ever had KNOWING it had brett in it. Wild, weird and wonderfully funky. I need to try and homebrew a bunch of this. Simply great. Big thanks to jtrockchalk for the Secret Santa super treat!"
"Very good drinkability, pretty refreshing for the ABV, people looking for sour will feel that this falls short, but this worked for me"
"Man, Blvd. is on a bit of a roll. The Smokestack beers were a bit of a revelation of their talents, and this beer is another step up. They should be proud of themselves... but not so proud that they don't keep putting out great beers like this one!"
"Serving type: bottle"
"Aging provides a wholly different experience than when fresh - like drinking an entirely new (or old) beer."
"D-This is one I would like to keep on hand for just whenever the mood hits, one of those if I wanted it nothing else would do."
"mouth is clean and crisp, carbonation is medium/heavy and drinks easy. I drank a glass with a bowl of venison chili and it paired amazingly well. definitely worth whatever price you have to pay for it."
"Medium body with a good amount of carbonation. If this were attenuated more, could really be nice. still, pretty good in my book."
"This is pretty tasty, I do wish that it finished a bit drier (especially since as this ages it will get more and more carbonated, it is already over carbonated, and could become a bottle bomb, though with a champagne bottle this is not too likely). Visually perfect for a Saison, the ample carbonation projects a magnificent head, with lots of lacing and lots of staying power. Despite being a bit thicker and a bit sweeter than I generally prefer in a Saison, both these components work quite well in this beer; the extra touch of hop character (especially the American bent) certainly helps with this. It will certainly be interesting to see how this develops as the hops fade and the Brett becomes more prominent, especially if it can keep from becoming explosive. Taken as a sum of its components (at least as far as aroma and flavor go), this beer is not nearly as good as it is in the complete whole; e.g. it is lacking in funky aromatic notes, isn't nearly dry enough, nor is the texture perfect. On the whole though this beer just works quite well and is very enjoyable. I am glad I have a couple bottles of this to age."
"D: a very good beer that is quite enjoyable for those who love hops."
"And thank to BuckeyeNation, what a pal!"
"Pours a nice yellowish golden color with a big chunky white head. Fantastic amount of lacing from the top to the bottom of the glass, fantastic looking beer. Aroma is floral, spices, brett, and citrus. Nice sweetness with a little bite at the end. Finishes quite dry."
"Pours a clouded yellow gold with a white head. Nose is citrus and funky mostly. Very airy. Flavor is a high amount of citrus and a lot of funk. If you don't like the funk, don't step up to this one. It's not overdone, but there is enough of it. Feel has a full carbonation that lays on the softer aide. Liquid is typical. A good saison. I haven't had the regular version, but this one is working for me nicely."
"Batch 2008-01. Numbered bottle. This is a great beer, and I'm very interested to see how this ends up as the sourness increases from the Brett. Right now its delicious, andd the Brett is there, but its definitely a subtext to the other flavors. This is a beautiful beer as well with a hazy golden/orange color that almost glows in the glass and has a beautiful pure white head that leaves some lacing. The aroma is a wonderful mixture of the dry hopping and the peppery, fruity Saison notes, and the Brett. Smells of Lemon, coriander, white pepper, orange and grapefruit citrus- very juicy- and a slightly funky sourness. Lovely flavors of bright, juicy tangerine, lemon, an earthy bitterness, and and some herbal flavors with an underlying sourness that is light, but bright- not at all washed out. Fantastic! Smooth and creamy with that bright tangerine sourness in the background. Very easy to drink and no hint at all of the abv. I love this!"
"Saison w/ George Brett combines citrus hops, a spicy saison, and a touch of sourness that all come together to form a unique and pleasing beer."
"Alcohol is almost not present and the drinkability is good here."
"Poured gently into a tulip and let the frothy head settle. The funk is not in the aroma, even as it warms, not inviting but not bad either. Spicy hop flavor washed away by a sweet/tart wave. I don't really get any leather/horse blanket funk until the aftertaste, which stays around for awhile. It is still very minor even as it warms. Real sticky mouth feel, keeps you licking your lips and roof of your mouth. More aggressively hopped than the original Saison with more body. Brett is extremely well balanced and according to the label with become more pronounced with age. I with I had a case cause I want to follow this up with my second bottle which is going away until August. I will update this review at that time."
"Drinkability is fairly high. It comes off as more bitter than tart to me. I dig the flavor though and I love the mouthfeel. I would certainly drink it again. I do wish it had a bit more in your face brett though, maybe I should age a bottle."
"Poured a corked and caged 750 into my Boulevard goblet. This beer pours a slightly hazy, golden pale straw with a huge 3 finger fluffy white head. This beer has great head retention leaving about a inch of a foamy head all the way down leaving behind beautiful lacing on the sides of the glass. The aroma is fruit esters, especially tart apples, a light grain bill, and just a hint of light funk coming through on the end of the nose. The taste up front also has the tart apple, fruity esters, a hint of spice - almost peppery and a really great musty flavor. The funk isn't overpowering but it comes through very well. The mouthfeel is light with just a bit of astringency. This is another home run in the Smokestack lineup. I will say that this bottle is on the funkier side of the 3 that I have drunk already. Each bottle seems to be developing on its own time."
"Great aroma. Citrus and spice with a little Brett funk. Medium bodied. More citrus, slightly sweet at the start but a dry finish. There is a bit of hop bitterness. More spice in the finish. Crisp and refreshing. Very drinkable. The last glass has a little more funk as the yeast is added in. It will be interesting to see what some age does to this beer."
"Overall Impression - After looking forward to the Smokestack series for over a year I was pretty disappointed in the series. I felt that the saison was one of the better of the four, but not much better than average. With the brett added this beer is given the character that it badly needed. This had been turned into a pretty great beer. For an 8.4% ABV the alcohol is well hidden. I could drink several pints of this. I would put this in my regular rotation if I could. I will go get a couple more bottles while it's still there. If you have the chance to get a bottle I highly recommend that you buy it."
"Unique, tasty, well balanced, well crafted, and I good go on and on. If you are lucky enough to have Boulevard distributed to your area, I would seriously try and seek this one out before it's all gone."
"Mouthfeel is very crisp and bubbly. Slightly sticky texture. The label says that aging will bring out more of the Brett. I'll get back to you in a year."
"Hope I can let a bottle or two of this lay for 6 months to a year, as I think it will be even better then."
"On-tap special at Cole's with a Boulevard brewer there. Pours a whitish shade of pale.And lace. A little spice in nose, active carbonation (better a few samples of it later). Smooth drinking, creamy. Absolutely smoother than can be expected . A mild bitterness. Had this bottled 3 1/3 years later and found it a showcase of brett taste, but also very boozy."
"D - This is a very good saison. The Bret makes it very interesting and delicious."
"Split between me, my dad, who is wanted is 14 states and idolizes Steve Guttenberg, and my uncle, who knows a little something about electricity, during my trip to Kansas City. According to my uncle, the bottle had been aging for about nine months. But he doesn't know where he is half the time, so take that for what it's worth. Pours a pale yellow color, with a rich, creamy head on top. Smell is complex...floral, fruit, grain, and peppery. Taste is even more complex. It's earthy, a hint of dried fruit, and horse blanket. After aging, the bret and horse blanket undertones become relatively subdued and make this beer very drinkable... but not with family. A very drinkable beer that requires some aging, but is well worth the wait."
"Strong carb and light body. Pretty easy drinking and likely to be a great quencher this summer."
"This is the saison with brettanomyces. Yellowish color with a massive & perfect head. Intriguing aroma of damp socks, horseblanket, lemon oil and wild mountain fruit. Nice & dry on the palate with hints of Torrontes. Exotic & wild, like a blend of papaya and pineapple. A really lovely example of the style Boulevard should be proud of."
