"Admittedly I'm not a big fan of the saison style, but this one is particularly bad in my opinion.  Tart, sour finish that leaves a lingering sour aftertaste.  I have stopped buying Blue Moon variety packs because this one is in there.  Shame."
"Too sweet for my liking.  Didn't get much of the traditional saison-y spice."
"Admittedly, I wasn't feeling good about this one due to the brand.  I'm probably in the minority on this beer, but I liked it. It is more red ale than farmhouse to me, but that might explain why I like it."

"BBD 8/18/14. Clear amber pour with a nice dark ruby hue. Strong head with very good lacing and retention. The nose has soft orange/lemon notes over a tart pepper-like background. Light medium bodied with a nice smooth texture. Above average carbonation that effervesces quite well on the finish. The flavor profile is laid back, but has a well balanced complexity. It begins with a citrus tartness which progresses to a light caramel sweetness. On the crisp finish, the coriander and pepper are noted along with a touch of spicy hop flavor as it effervesces. A good solid ale that leaves you with a touch of spicy heat at the back of the throat.."

"I tried the Expressionist Collection: Farmhouse Red. It has hints of Coriander, Hibiscus and White Pepper. When you smell this beer it smells a little like cilantro (coriander), which is why it has that orange/citrusy smell. I loved this beer; the flavors were delicious and it was just an easy beer to drink. It was light and not bitter like an IPA."

"I tried but no thanks. I went to my local liquor store and my buddy who owns it offered me a 12pk for $7.99. Just on the price alone I was suspicious but having drinks earlier in the day I figured wat the hell, plus ill save some $. Well that was 3weeks ago and im just on my 4th beer. Cant drink it unless im buzzed because my gag reflex aren't as sensitive."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Interesting combination of flavors, but not a beer I'd want to have again."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark amber with a thick head that dies to nothing and leaves no lace like all blue moon beers. Smells are caramel, spice, orange.. the taste follows with mostly a orange spice back ground. The mouthfeel is thin to slight medium. Overall its decent and I would have no issue drinking more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"P.S. also I have a stomach ache from 1/4 of this beer! unbelievable!!! Also I think I'm going to throw my Cassanova's pint glass away cuz it tainted it so much, ICK!"

"Picked up a blue moon variety pack for a quantity over quality night. This one was a nice little surprise. Decent looking beer with an outstanding smell and really good taste. Enjoyed it a good bit and would certainly try again if I see it individually."
""
""
""
""
"Medium body and medium-high carbonation."
""
""
""
"This is not really bad tasting but it's at the bottom of the scale compared to actual Farmhouse Ales. From the 12 oz screw-cap bottle purchased at Liticker's Liquors in Ocean Beach."

"Poured this beer, it has a reddish color body with a thin head. The aroma has a sweet and some floral hints to it. The taste has a sweet, malt flavor to it. It also has some hop on the back of the tongue. The mouthfeel is smooth and overall it is good, nothing to over the top."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a good to great ale with a nice alcohol% kick that rounds the experience. I will suggest this as tasty get-together drink that works well with chicken wings."
""
"I really, REALLY like this beer. I took a few extra sips while rating it , just so I can taste it again. The taste, mouthfeel, smell is all in perfect ranges. I strongly suggest this to anyone. Even to a not often beer drinker. Blue Moon has once again lived up to their expectations. I got this in the sampler pack. I will have to find it in its own pack and purchase. The Hibiscus flavor is strong , in a good way."
""
"Overall: Not a bad beer, but nothing too memorable either. This won't satisfy the average beer geek, but is definitely acceptable. I wouldn't seek this out, but this may be something I'd introduce if I were trying to bring someone onto the craft beer bandwagon."
"Cheers for the 4th time..."
""
"O: Pretty good, way underrated, as are many blue moon beers. Don't let the name or the rating discourage you. It's less than 2 dollars a bottle and well worth a try. Definitely recommended."

"I don't fully appreciate Saisons. I've tried a few and been underwhelmed. It's just not my thing. So I'll usually pass in favor of something darker, thicker, richer. But today I stopped at a C-store and this Short Straw was the only interesting looking beer in the ""beer cave"". I didn't realize what style it was supposed to be until I got it home. Working through this 6-pack, I'm thinking, ""It's refreshing, easy going, and happiness producing."" Overall, I'd suggest that what the folks at Blue Moon have done here is provided a ""gateway"" brew to the Saison style."
""
"A flawed attempt at the style, but drinks pretty easy despite that. This would still be the best beer available for the most part around here for at least ten miles, sigh..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"29/50"

"Had this in the winter sampler which really confused me as this is definitely not a winter beer. Has a hoppy aroma not much citrus there. The flavor had hints of citrus and the white pepper with the hops dominating it. Overall not a bad beer but as i said before definitely not a winter beer."
""
"This ale has a reddish, brownish look. Small head. Aroma of sweet roasted nuts & bread. Tate is light in all areas. Somewhat tart, light on hops, malt is stronger than the hops and stands out as the dominate taste. Fig? Flat, dry mouthfeel. Not much else stands out. Not great, not bad."
"This one confused me. Not really sure what they were going for with this. Didn't really have the character of a red ale in my opinion. Average at best."

"An interesting beer from Coors(!?)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear amber with a decent head, and decent lacing. Pick up some light breadiness, and nuttiness in the aroma. Creamy and medium bodied. Malts are there but weak, and I get some tartness. Hopping, is there but not prominant and there is also some toasted character and finishes dry"
""
""
"One of the best Blue Moon offerings I have had, by far. I guess it comes out of their ""Farmhouse"" line, so I suppose I gotta try more of these. I was very happy with it's red-tinged hue, it's distant smell of sweetness, and an overall great tasting beer."
""
""
""
"The taste is just off. Too sweet. Thin maltiness that is overpowered by a mucky excuse for a saison yeast. Very unflatteringly floral, like sipping on cheap perfume mixed with beer. It has a strange off-putting burn toward the finish. Soppy to drink with a restless body and quaintly wrapped carbonation presence. There might be a slight tartness that's hard to pull out because of the red grain push and offsetting sweetness. Hops are mildly citrusy with a gummi grapefruit note that absorbs too much of the attention. Doesn't settle entirely too well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Well this is my first time trying this type of beer, and I actually enjoyed it; since its nice to have something different once in a while."
""
""
"O- If I didn't know before hand, I'd never know that this was a farmhouse ale, no traditional flavors of the style. I did pick up some Flanders red ale characteristics, although is seemed watered down"
""
""
""
"Pours a mostly clear deep reddish gold with a smallish off white head that doesn't stick around very long. Aromas of light sugar, spicy wheat, and a hint of cherry tartness. The flavor follows the aroma, its a light tart spicy beer. Medium body with a moderate to high level of carbonation and a slick tart mouthfeel. Not too shabby, nothing earth shattering, but pleasant and flavorful enough to enjoy."
""
""
""
""
"O: I think perhaps this would be a much better beer ice-cold and from the bottle. Not the disaster I was expecting, but not recommendable."
""
""
""
""
""
"RJT"
""
""
""
"Taste is not skittles unfortunately (or fortunately for some), sweet malt front with an adequate amount of spicing that follows up, carbonation is medium-high but closer to the middle range, body is slightly lacking, hint of a peppery finish, not overly sweet like I had initially expected."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"To good health and good beer."
""
""
"O: A little flavorful, goes down ok, not too filling, decent kick, not the best representation of style, it’s flat out just a very mediocre beer overall."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very middle of the road. It would be refreshing on a summer day while doing yard work. Nothing really outstanding about it but it was not bad."
"O- Overall this is a beer worth the money if you decide to just close your eyes, shut out all aspects of what you might expect from its title and enjoy... Yes it could be a better beer but it isn't a bad one, and for that, hats off to Coors! (Kidding)"
""
"Overall: This one is ok. I won't be going out of my way to buy it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. It pours with a reddish/golden hue, quickly fading white head. The aroma is faint, straw, wheat. The flavor profile is weak, tasteless. It does not have any flavors of a saison or Flanders red. the body is light, good carbonation, easy drinking. Taste like a light wheat beer, avoid it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- This doesn't seem to be good example of the style, which is fine by me as I don't enjoy the pepper flavors associated with a saison. A decent enough beer that I might try again."
""
"Drinkable, but wouldn't buy it. It was a gift from a party guest, which thought I might like it, since I like craft beer."
""
"Pours a clear orange-red with a foamy beige head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, and spice aromas. Taste is much the same with malt and yeast flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that is drinkable but I am not getting any sort of the Flanders Red aspect that this is supposed to have."

""

""
""
""
""
"O: Decent red ale."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I think that this beer would make a great new substitution for the current coors recipe, but as mixture of saison and flanders red, this beer falls way short of being even remotely close to either style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Surprised and happy that Coors could pull this off. Deviates from most other saisons I've had, in a good way. Some might call the sweet fruit flavors (opposed to dryer notes) an easy way to make a refreshing saison, I say why not? I don't see this variety in stores much, but when the weather calls for it again I'll keep my eyes peeled for this great valued and refreshing beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, forget it. I tasted and tried a few times and even put the Flanders thing out of my head. I just tried to accept it at beer. It was full of lies. Original Blue Moon is fine with me, I'll gladly drink it over numerous other beers in certain situations. But this... What were they thinking! I'm actually a bit annoyed they put the term ""Flanders Red"" or even ""Farmhouse Red"" anywhere on the bottle."
""
""
""
""
"Another in the ""Expressionist Series," and this one has a bit more character than most Blue Moons, although the character of this beer is not one that I' am all too excited about. The beer pours a copper-orange color, clear, with a wisp of a head. So much for a red ale. There's very little carbonation apparent, and the beer just sits there in the pint glass like a lazy half-cousin. Some sour funk in the smell, french bread, some malt. The taste is more sour than I expected: lemon, vinegar, white pepper, old grains, chaff, dust. Crisp and fairly clean. So what makes this a farmhouse ale? The label, it seems."
""
"Blue Moon Short Straw Farmhouse Red Ale ---3/5."
""
""
"Beer snobbery aside, here's what I think: Pours to a thin head that leaves some lacing. Color is as red as a beer can be without containing red fruit or food coloring. Clear. Aroma is crystal malt and some fruity notes in there as well. Flavor is tart, malty, but not sweet or hoppy, except for a faint aged hop taste. Acidic finish. Mouthfeel is light and moderate carbonation. Overall, nice malt features, sort of different, very good for a mass produced Saison from Coors."
""
"A little disappointing overall, but we will finish the 12-pack we purchased. Not great, but not bad enough to pour down the drain."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I like saisons and farmhouse ales for the most part, but red ales not so much... However, I was intrigued when I stumbled across this concoction. With a more potent carbonation and more fruit up front this would be easier to recommend... Perhaps next year?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I expect a bit more from this beer ... not much but as usual this beer lands flat like the others from Blue Moon. Approachable to the masses which is what they are all about."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Easy drinker. More flavorful than a BMC but certainly a poorly crafted and poor representation of a Saison/Farmhouse ale. If this is supposed to be a beer that gives the masses a sample of this style, they've completely missed the mark."
""
""
"Overall an enjoyable quaff that leaves you with a slight pucker."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This one's a bit too funky and earthy for my liking."
""
""
""
"O: If you're a fan of the standard Blue Moon Belgian White then this should be on your radar. It has a similar flavor profile, albeit a bit fruitier and heavier. If you're a fan of saisons and farmhouse ales, you won't find the depth and complexity that keeps you buying the style. In the end it is a tasty beer, but it would be at the bottom of my list of recommendations for those wanting to try a farmhouse ale. It's just over-the-top on spice."
""
" Either way, it was a decent after work beer that I would recommend to someone who's just looking to relax with a one. Wouldn't go out of my way to get another but if I was offered one, I would take it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- This is a really interesting beer and I like it a lot. An extra spicy and dry profile from a farmhouse yeast would add a really nice balance to play off the sweetness and tartness. I feel like this beer would be excellent to pair with several oriental cuisines such as Thai and Chinese. It would also pair well with dried stone fruits, cherries and a nice dry cheese or Brie. EMP"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is okay. Dark hue, foamy head, slight lacing. Nose is woody, fall spicy, sea water. Sugary malt, tinted with a washed-out raspberry. Overall, this is an okay quaff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"3.34/5.00"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clean orange-ish to red in color with a light tan head. In the aroma, a sweet malt and a small earthiness. In the taste, a sweet caramel malt, with notes of white grape tartness and earthiness. A small bite a a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry fruitiness in the aftertaste. Too much going on that does not compliment the other."
"Overall: Not likely to be everyone's cup of brew, as there's a lot of unique yeast character overshadowing the malt and hops. A lighter mouthfeel would make the beer more refreshing, but it has some sweet, summery qualities that, when balanced with the earth and spice, make for a pleasant mix I would happily mull over once in a while."

""
""
"Date tasted: July 6, 2013... Glassware: Ayinger willibecker... Occasion: redemption bottle--could a whole sampler of brews be such a terrible mistake? I messed my July 4th hosting gig with this poor purchase....Appearance: clear, blood orange-red body with a creamy white head that settles in thinly... Aroma: white pepper?! pepper, yes--and the doughy yeast that accompanies a perplexing funky malt--too medicinal to be pleasing... Palate: balanced, drinkable body that doesn't waste time in the mouth; as profiled, a farmhouse that cleanses the palate... Taste: honeyed, candied tartness with a bit of grapelike pucker; competing flavors make for a busy development of drinking--again, not attractive... Overall: a slight redux on the abysmal tastings of the agave and blackberry, as this will hold well enough to encourage a second bottle; a decent marriage with the summer elements can be had here--decent...."
""
""
""
"The body is light and, while it's a little thin, it's not terribly so. It's crisp without biting too hard and a bit smooth but it flattens out some at the end."
"O: Overall, this is alright, nothing spectacular but nothing horrible as well. I'd recommend it, its smooth and easy going, no harm with that."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An interesting blend of styles, but this beer didn't really do it for me. Fruit flavors tasted syrupy and the overall flavors were bland. Maybe better off with a saison and Flanders red by themselves."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is better than I had anticipated from the nose. I don't get much tartness from the Flanders Red nor are the lactic impressions very forward. I also don't get any of the promised white pepper. This beer to me doesn't at all seem like a ""farmhous red ale"" because I don't any of the notes I would expect or want from either style. What I get instead are the impressions of a toned down Dubbel with caramel malt notes and fruity esters. In the end, it's definitely better than most beers marketed under the Blue Moon brand, but it's still not up to par."
""
""
""
""
"Malts can be found in the taste with a more noticeable fruity character followed by a clean, crisp hop finish. It has elements of a farmhouse but is not quite there."
""
""
""
""
"O. It's like an off Blue Moon. I have nothing against Blue Moon, but this is just a repackaged beer."
""
""
"This beer is a nice addition to a hot afternoon siesta and snack of chips and salsa. It is one I will be drinking a lot this summer."
"this is one of the better blue moon incarnations, with quite a lot going on. it has a crazy nose that's tart and fruity, as well as brightly Belgian, and even a little funky. the label says white pepper notes, and when I take my first sip, that's the very first flavor I get on my tongue, dusty white pepper powder, quite nice, and very different. it blends into a sort of flanders red acidic tartness that finishes nice and dry. there is a saison kind of feel to this, yeasty and bright, well carbonated and plenty drinkable. however, like all blue moon beers, there is a weird gut feel, which is different from the excellent mouthfeel. it sits in my stomach a little heavy, and I don't know if its the yeast or what, but it makes me a little rumbly in my guts, which limits the drinkability of this otherwise intriguing and delicious summer red ale."
"O - I just cant get used to the Saison style beers. I have not found many I truely like, but still try and give them a fair score. This beer is very good looking in appearance and has a nice aroma. Its just too tangy for my liking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - it's a typical Blue Moon Seasonal. it seems as if instead of creating a completely different beer for their portfolio they just constantly modify their bread winner. I'm not saying it's a bad marketing strategy, but it lacks in creativity"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Finish is medium and slightly sour. This is not really Flemish Red, but drinkable and not bad overall."
""
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a bronze color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of fruits and spices. Taste is fruits, malts, some spice, refreshing and very easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall would be a good choice on a hot summer day."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall this is an average beer. Very unique/different combination of flavors. Good beer for a hot summers day. Glad I tried it but not something I would seek out again."
"I drank one or two of these over two nights before this review, as I find that I have to condition my palate to this type of brew. I was put off at first by some of the fruity, flowery flavors furnished no doubt by the hibiscus, but after downing a couple I could see drinking this on a hot summer afternoon after some dry, dusty work in the fields."
"Overall for $1.50 it was a hard single to pass over but I would never consider getting it again considering I have had better rep's of the style. Just because BMC can afford to do crafted styles doesn't mean it is worth it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's a different saison. The style varies greatly, but this hardly fits, though it does have an acidic touch. Odd, but drinkable."
""
"Alright, screw the haters, I thoroughly appreciate this attempt by Blue Moon. It pours a mostly clear auburn topped by a relatively short-lived finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises perfume-y wheat and flowers, sharp (and general) sweetness, and a touch of what I can only describe as peach blossom. The taste holds notes of cracked wheat, coriander, very mild vinegar, sweet caramel, and a vague assumption of Belgian yeast. Overall, this was a relatively ambitious brew from the BM folks, but it just didn't work for me. It's too muddled and schizoid for my tastes, but I still see some value from it."
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: Not a terrible beer, but not what it says it is. It's just another shade of the same general product, as usual. Aptly named indeed, they drew the short straw on this one. Coors is trying hard to be craft here, but fell way short."
""
"update: drink chilled. does not do well as it warms."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, worst beer in the Blue Moon Spring variety pack."
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A easy drinking farmhouse ale but a little lacking of some of the desired characteristics of funk that I am looking for in a brew such as this. It is tasty, but if looking for a big saison, then this is likely not for you."
""
""
"This is the STAR of the variety pack for sure. I haven't tried many saisons, so let that speak to how true to style it is. Semantics aside, what we have here is a delicious beer. Pours a beautiful ruby color with a mild head. Smells like fruit, spice. Not really carbonated but bubbles on the tongue like crazy, tastes of orange and PEPPER! Like pepper spice. So incredible. I could literally drink enough of these to kill a large steer. Delicious. A+. Please sell in a standalone 6er!"
""
"Very good Belgian Pale Ale. I’ve been pleasantly surprised with this Blue Moon variety 12-pack. I’d have this again for sure."
"Sweet, malty floral aroma. Poured deep copper/brown with full beige head. Head lasts a few minutes, spotty lacing. Taste is crisp slightly bity and sweet, like a Lemonhead sour candy! Tangy tart mouth feel, nice finish. Enjoyable."
"An interested and slightly bland ale, not even remotely farmhouse-like at all. This is just an average American ale. Do they really think people will think this is a farmhouse? That aside, it isn't terrible, pretty easy to drink, worth trying anyway. You can't just call a beer whatever style you want, though, it has to exhibit actual characteristics of that style."
"Low C"
""
""
""
"O- Above average. Quite a nice beverage."
""
"My pour generated a finger of dense, rocky, tawny head with remarkable retention. Color was a deep coppery-red with NE-quality clarity. This represented a change of pace for me as I am used to Saisons as being on the low end of the SRM spectrum. Cool! Nose had that characteristic earthiness to it that comes from Saison yeast, but accompanied by a slight funkiness. Did Coors really make this?!? Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium and the taste was kind of muted for the style. I was getting a mushroom-y earthy flavor on the tongue and it was not unpleasant, but decidedly different. Finish was very dry and continued to evince an earthiness which was not bad, but not something that left me clamoring for more."
"O: The description on the back of the bottle compares this to a Flanders red. I know Jack Kennedy and you sir are no Jack Kennedy. Too sweet. It's an immature tasting beer and doesn't really have the fully developed that they wanted here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was an interesting surprise as once I saw it was Blue Moon as the brewer, I wasn't expecting much. The taste was especially noticeable, combining green apple, cinnamon, and chili flavors underpinned with a nice malt and bread-like (yeast?) backbone. Smooth and favorable with a multitude of subtle flavors to discover and savor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"12 ounce bottle, best before December 10, 2012 stamped on bottle. Served in a Unibroue tulip, the beer pours a clear amber/orange color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention is decent, and there's a good amount of lacing. Aroma is light tart berries, flowers (I guess that's from the hibiscus), and a little bit of spice. I think the taste is just like the aroma, but it's stronger in comparison. It's a bit tart, spicy and flowery. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and slick with moderate carbonation. This was better than I thought it was going to be. I wouldn't make a point to find it, but if you can find a single of it like I did it's certainly worth trying. $1.79 a bottle."
""
"-Overall 1.0: Utter garbage. Let me use some onomatopoeia here: ""Bleargh."" What is the ""brewmaster"" at Blue Moon smoking? I have had saisons before and this abomination is not a saison. This is one farmhouse that should be burned to the ground and salt sown into the soil along with its ashes. Again, I say, ""Bleargh."""
""
""
""
"Would be a good beer to bring that macro drinkers into the Belgian styles of beer."

"This is the sour beer of the people. It's middling, but it's not aggressively bad. It's very drinkable even though it lacks the complexity one expects from the craft-beer versions of this style that have been its dominant expression."

"Overall, this is a confusing and seemingly confused beer. I don't know what this was trying to be. Tastes like a regular Blue Moon, with some caramel malt and a misplaced tartness. I love me funky/sour ales and this one just failed in that regard. The flavor profile is all over the place and just straight-up not tasty. Try it and review it so Coors learns its lesson. Cheers!"
