"O - This is a Saison. The flavors are very clean and refreshing. This is a perfect warm weathe beer."
""
"O: Good. A nice example of the style. The lime taste is a nice change."
""
""
""
""
"Sort of confused by the reviews of this one - beguiled by Prairie perhaps; regardless, it's a decent representation of this style, but it fell short in virtually every category for me...very faint citrus/lemon, and farmhouse flavors, but overall I just get malt and an almost lager taste."
""
""
""
"Eh, am I missing something here? Tastes like perfume and flowers. I get dough and bread on the backend and an earthiness as well. I assume this isn't how it normally is. Or at least, I hope not."
"Prairie Standard -----4/5."
""
"O- this is a decent saison. I expected more coming from prairie. I'd like the saison yeast to shine through a little more. Overalls this is a decent offering that is pretty drinkable"
"Highly carbonated, spritsy brew.  Overall it's decent but not crazy good standard saison.  I'd drink it again."
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a schooner, the beer is a slightly hazy, yellow-straw coloring with a fizzy, filmy, surface coating of head. Aromas of toasted grains, lemon zest, dill, basil, jasmine, tangerine, cut grass, and subtle pepper spice. Flavors are a little more hop forward, with a bit of cedar, grassy notes, and a citrus blend of tangerine and lime. The spice blend is there, too, to layer the palate. Light bready backbone, almost like a pie crust, with some lemon notes coming forward at the end of the palate. The body is full, but light in mouth, with a citrus and herbal balance in the aftertaste. The finish is light, smooth, and slightly effervesced. Extremely drinkable beer."
""
"I loved this beer! I could drink It all day long."
""
""
""
""
""
"A clear yellow golden color with visible carbonation bubbles and a fingers worth of white head that disappears quickly.  Nice aroma of bready malts, citrus fruits, light sweet fruits, and yeast.  Taste has a light malt backbone, citrus, mild hop notes.  Lightish in body and carbonation.  Overall a very refreshing beer, would be great on a summer day."

"High carbonation and medium body tickle the tongue. Light caramel and biscuit throughout the beer. Simple and yet wonderful. Lemon and kiwi come in from the hops. Such a solid American saison. Love this."
""
"super balanced beer. man this would be awesome if I could get this all the time. very drinkable, perfect beer to sit back and enjoy with a meal. not a showstopper just wonderful. not every beer needs to be profound."

"Overall a very nice beer to have a few of. It is a nice balance of hops and malt for a lower abv beer."
""
""
""
"Pours into my Hennepin stemmed glass a hazed straw color with a fluffy bone white head that settles into a frothy mass after quite awhile.Lemon oils really stand out in the nose with a hint of funk and toasted cereal grain.Quite refreshing on the palate with lemon really standing out along with mild yeasty phenols,a hint of white pepper and some toasted cereal grains in the finish.A great ""table"" beer to be had."
""
"I really dug this one."
""
""
""
""
"Recommendation: It's a nice warm weather beer if you're in the mood for a saison, but don't go out of your way to pick it up."
""
""
""
"Overall, while I did enjoy this brew, the unfortunate cat piss-like ammonia aroma got to me after a while."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from bottle into teku.  Pours hazy and pale yellow in color with minimal bubbly head and minimal lacing.  Aroma is mostly saison yeast with a citrusy lemon-lime overtone.  Mouth feel is medium bodied and nicely carbonated.  Palate is lemon, lime, and peppercorn…sour throughout and finishes dry.  A nice saison…easy drinker."
"First Prairie brew. Translucent, hazy pale golden gorgeousness. Slight ring of bubbles and bit of transient lacing. Fun bottle art. Big ass lime note, bready/bit yeasty base, hint of peppery snap... Aromas led right into the flavors. Bright, clean citrus. Subdued enough to be a daily drinker, but interesting and complete enough to keep it fresh.  Clean, light mouthfeel with a crisp (with a bit of a juicy note) aftertaste. Prairie has hit Eastern OH, and I couldn't be more excited. Try this. Farmhouse + bonus."

"12 ounce bottle.  Served in a Prairie Teku, the beer pours a hazy dark gold color with about a half inch off-white head.  Head retention and lacing are both decent enough.  The brew smells like bready malt, peppery spice, citrus, melon and a bit of earthy floralness.  It tastes like melon, bananas, bready/grainy malt, honey, peppery spice and some white grape/wine.  Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit creamy with moderate carbonation.  I think this is an OK brew overall and I won't have any problems finishing the 4-pack, but it's not one of the better Prairie ales I've tried.  The longer I drank this, the less I liked it.  Still, it's worth picking up if you've never had it before."

"Hazy yellow with a frothy, sticky white head on top.  Aroma is spicy and on the sharp side at first...freshly milled malt, cracked pepper, wet hay, flowers, and earth.  Flavor gets things working more in harmony; the peppery yeast is still at the forefront, but a nice cereal maltiness starts to smooth it out before a light lime and melon finish.  Fairly light and zesty, leaving the mouth dry.  Definitely has the drinkability nailed down.  The aroma is perhaps a little overly rustic, but it helps lend an authentically ""farmhouse"" feel to the whole deal."
"Hazy golden straw colored beer with a nice cakey white head that in due time  fades to a lumpy layer leaving a sticky ring of sheety lace on the glass. Aroma is a bit wacky farmhouse. First thing that comes to mind is an unidentified stinky fruit that is somewhere between tropical and fig and bergamot. A little wine-like, slightly phenolic, certainly floral, with maybe honey, and an interesting array of spicy yeasty aromas. Taste follows right along the same lines. White wine nuances, slight tart bitterness, rooty veggies, a shroomy earthiness, spicy hop, and wild flowers or potpourri. Mouthfeel is smooth, evenly and finely carbonated, approaching dryness, and somewhat fluffy in texture. Overall an enjoyably farmy, earthy, and fairly unusual saison."
""
"Nice clean, quaffable saison. Bright carbonation and slight funkiness. Great simplicity here. Notes of melon, banana and long grains. Good stuff for a hot day, or a freezing one begging for summer."

"I found a bottle in a local liquor store a week or two after visiting Tulsa where I noticed Prairie beers available on tap.  It has a bit of hop, but the overall taste leans toward Belgian-style yeast."
""
"Extra crisp and refined flavor profile.  Super clean and dry with no off notes.  Simplicity at its absolute finest."
""
""
""
"Sweeter style saison. Nice hop bite cuts through some of the sweetness. Reminds me a bit of Tank 7."
""
""
""
"too much phenol for my liking.  Maybe a bad bottle.  I have some others from a newer batch that I will try again"
""
""
"Damn. This is impressive. The nose is brilliant - fragrant, rustic, fruity, wild, hoppy, yeasty, phenolic - and balanced. Grainy with a clean pils malt character, fruity with a blend of lemon and some tropical fruit, wild without Brett in that there's an earthy, yeasty funk, hoppy with a clean bitterness and phenolic with a blend of saison yeast and spices. The palate is well-represented on the nose, is light in body and crisply carbonated. Brilliantly focused and structured, this can give Upright's Five a run for its money in the hoppy saison category. Excellent stuff."
"Overall: I was impressed by this one. Its a good brew. My only complaint is I wish it had a bit more body other than that is is solid. I could drink this one more often if it were more readily available."
""
""
""
""
"Thanks to UncleJazz for the bottle.  A really nice, understated brew, soft and well balanced.  It has a nice mix of yeast notes as well as hop herbaceousness and spice.  Pleasent and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""

"O--This beer was really well done.  We know Prairie carries a rep for great stouts and I was impressed to see what they could do with a saison.  I admit the saison isn't my favorite style but I would definitely go for this one again if the mood were to strike me."
"Crisp, light and refreshing..tastes like lime...awesome"
"This beer came to me from my son in Texas, who is fortunate to be able to purchase Prairie Artisan Ales locally. I had some of their beers last year when I visited him, and was very pleased to find their version of a farmhouse ale in the box he sent me.  On the first pour it is golden in color, with a full white head, nice carbonation and great lacing thru the quaff.  The aroma is of fresh sweet pickles, and on the first sip you can taste the complex blending of sweet and sour, with a mild hop bitterness and a refreshing finish.  The last pour of the beer is totally different in color - totally cloudy, almost opaque, with sediment; but the taste didn't vary - still deeelicous! And I love their labels and the bottle cap featuring the catfish."

"Of the American-style dry-hopped Saisons, this might be the most delicate presentation I've had yet. The hops are present (but not overbearing) in the aroma, and the flavor is just fantastically melded together. Wonderful daily drinker, and at a very accessible ABV."
""
""
""
""
"Not bad for the Raul man. Light with clove and slight banana-like qualities, but it's the Posh Spice spice that gives this lil sucker a lil junk in the trunk. Smooth and sexy like Raul after a sunday wash, this bad boy could be a constant thing."

"A flavorful and refreshing beer from Prairie."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A nice American take on the Farmhouse style, a saison that brings significant hopping, but does not lose interest in the floral, grass and barnyard of the original style.  A nice introduction to the fine work coming out of Prairie Artisan Ales."

"A purist's saison with a very welcomed hop addition.  Spice, acidity, soft carbonation and mouth feel are right on.  This was my first Prairie beer, but will definitely not be my last.  Next up, BOMB!"

"Pours cloudy golden color with a thick foamy head.  Head retention is decent.  Lacing is a good amount.  Has the funky farmhouse, sour fruit aroma.  Slightly hoppy up front with some spicy carbonation and sour fruit funk at the end.  Typical farmhouse funky aftertaste.  Very representative of the type of beer.  Enjoyable."

"i love this beer, and i love the label. how to noodle for catfish? only these guys right? haha. the beer in the bottle is fantastic. it pours rather clear until the last fifth or so of the bottle when the sediment rolls out. its blonde and hazy, its pale and really really fizzy. tickles my nose as i smell the new zealand lemony hops oozing from it, and a mild french saison yeast that pairs geniusly with the hops. i like that the yeast is subtle here, its distinct, really drying with a touch of white wine esters, but its not dominating, and lets the malt and hops contribute nearly equally. the hops are so cool, i love the new zealand stuff. citrus and that peculiar oil property only these strains have. enough carbonation for a couple of saisons, which i really like. effervescence is always flattering to this style, and with a mildly creamy light to medium body, its the perfect effect for what i like. i plan to drink a whole lot of this while its on shelves. way better then the last four pack they put out, birra."

"O: 4.95 - I went in to this review expecting to give this probably around a 4. Maybe I rated this so highly because I haven't had many Saison/Farmhouse Ales, I don't know. This was my first one to review, and I will definitely be trying some more of this style. I thought the big imperial stouts reigned supreme,  but damn I enjoyed this beer. 3/3 for Prairie so far."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a golden color with a full white lacy head. Sweet lemon earthy aroma. Earthy, citrus, sweet pineapple. Genuine farmhouse sourness. I like this beer. Its different."

"Overall- The perfect afternoon beer with big bright hop flavors, slightly funky finish, and a smooth malt that wipes the palate clean.  If this was year round there would be no doubt this would a go-to, especially in the summer. (92/100)"

"Dry, refreshing, Champagne-esque beer. Very sessionable, but also because it's at times a bit tame and mild compared to what it feels like it could be."
""
""
""
""
""
"Serving type: bottle"
""
"Pours a hazy yellow with a white head. Aroma is fruity, grainy, funk, peppery, gingery. Flavor follows suit. A medium bodied, active mouthfeel. Overall, this has quickly become become my favorite (American) saison, tied with Funkwerks Saison. Not sure what more I could ask for in a saison. Just a wonderful beer from Prairie."
""
""
""
""
""
"O – Very nice drinking saison. Nothing overwhelms you here with this brew but it’s damn fine. Easy drinking and refreshing. Had this sitting outside when it was 90 out and this hits the spot. Would gladly have another."

"O: Very easy to drink and very enjoyable - definitely an every day type of beer. I really enjoy the hoppy presence to a saison/farmhouse ale."
"Poured a hazy orange with a slight orange head. The smell that immediately hit was a grassy, hoppy, peppery grains. The taste was very similar. Prickly spices. Earthy grains. Citrus hops. Lots of carbonation added to the peppery flavors and made my tongue tingle. One of the best examples of a true Belgian style farmhouse ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, just a solid, everyday drinking saison. It doesn't quite measure up to the best ""hoppy"" saisons in the style, but it's only barely below. I have to say that the lime-like characteristic isn't something I'm used to coming across in beer, so it definitely has unique points going in its favor. Not sure if it's release is seasonal, but I will probably pick up a 4-pack whenever I see it on shelves, which so far has been rather infrequently."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A whole lot going on here. I wish it tasted like it smelled instead of a spicy sour tart saison. Not a horrible beer though. I can see why this is their everyday beer. Try it if you want, but I'm buying something else."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"There's tint to the orange-yellow color, topped with a billowy head which leaves spots of lace on the walls of the glass. With one smell, I had an idea that I was working with a saison. The aroma has lemon peel, vague spice, a moderate farmhouse stink so common of the style. Regarding its taste, it's a somewhat sour flavor overall which doesn't really get funky. Slightly tart lemons, a kick of grass, and vague citrus make the flavor. With its drying and spiced finish, this beer was a pleasant pairing with a home grilled steak."

"Got in a trade with cyde. 12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours moderately hazy bright golden amber color with a 2-3 finger foamy and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big lemon zest, lime, peach, pear, apple, floral, grass, clove, pepper, wheat, bread, light honey, herbal, light funk, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity and balance of hop, malt, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of big lemon zest, pear, apple, lime, clove, pepper, wheat, bread, grass, floral, herbal, light funk, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of lemon zest, lime, pear, apple, wheat, clove, pepper, bread, grass, floral, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of malt, hop, and yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/spiciness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent hoppy saison! All around great complexity and balance of hop, malt, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"A delicious and sessionable Saison from Prairie."
""
""
"O - Overall, a good saison. Straight forward and well crafted."
""
""
""
"Yet to have a bad beer by Prairie. These guys know how to make Saisons. Nice traditional notes mixed i with a tinge of Americana and NZ at that."
""
""
""
"Overall, a pretty awesome hoppy saison. Pairs the best flavors of hops, spices, and fruity tartness. I wish I would have bought a four pack of this instead of a single."

"Pours out a hazy brass color with a thin head. Smell is very grainy, with some citrus, a bit of spicy yeast and a touch of toast. Flavor: crackery malts, citrys hops, resinous lingering hop bitterness in the finish. Yeast has a spicy quality to it, but is subdued. Finishes dry. Bitterness keeps lingering on. Mouthfeel is vibrant. A little heavy for what the flavor profile brings. Tasty saison, I'd say, although I'd rather buy a 4 pack of Rayon Vert for the money."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste a lot of citrus with a toned down barnyard funk. Hoppy but not on the same level as an IPA or barleywine. Fine carbonation and smooth mouthfeel. So dry and refreshing that I could easily see myself pounding 8 or 10 of these suckers on a serious college football Saturday."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A very easy drinking farmhouse ale."
""
"Overall, this is really gorgeous stuff, although why I'm still surprised that Another Beer From Prairie Is Gorgeous I don't really know. This is the third or fourth of theirs I've tried, and they just have such a knack for providing beautifully subdued complexity and wonderful drinkability to their beers. Top notch."

"Pours hazy and straw-colored into a mason jar. Craggy white head, half-finger retention with nice lacing. Bright lemon/lime zest characters on the nose. Tart, slightly sour at the front of the tongue. Middle of the mouth: grass, hay, Sweet Tarts. Finishes slightly dry, but not intensely so. Super refreshing. Perfect session beer. Drink outdoors."

"My first Oklahoma rate. Pours into tulip flasss cloudy yellow with a big fluffy head. Aroma is big hops--bordering on IPA--followed by big floral notes and some funky sweetness. Smells really really good! Sharp bitter up front that develops into a very floral flavor. Definite hints of yeast funk here finishing with bits of lemon peel, pineapple, banana, and mango. A little spice lingers. Crisp and refreshing on the palate with high carbonation. Serious summertime session beer here. What an excellent brew!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A great little saison. Glad I got to try one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"In my notes I used the descriptor “zesty” a lot—for both aroma and flavor it is zesty, vibrant, active and lively. I found a delicate citrusy character with some clear lemongrass aromas. Tasty to boot, with a fresh lemon/lemongrass character to it while finishing dry. Having been introduced to this on tap I’m more than curious to see how it comes across in the bottle."
"The nose seems to be the ideal highlight of the beer, but even it's light body doesn't distract from the palate and flavors. This is a real easy drinking flavorful saison, could easily be the beer a non saison beer drinker would get into."
"Overall a great offering from prairie. I'd recomend this for anyone venturing into the Bret category but not quite into the full-funkiness. A great hybrid beer."
""
"T/M/O: Incredibly refreshing! What an ""everyday"" beer! It's crisp, cold, and bitter without being abrasive. The yeast is light, only hinting at spice or funk (in an interesting way). The finish is clean and the aftertaste dry. Low on flavor, perhaps, but a solid beer that could replace a pale ale in just about anybody's repertoire. Highly recommended, if pricy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: While this is certainly not the best example of the style I've ever encountered, I do believe it is meant to be the flagship beer and I feel it is a very nice take on the Saison."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The feel is airy, bubbly and light with a slight expansiveness in the mouth."
""
""
"O: great saison with a lot of quality characteristics going on. Aside from just looking pretty, it's a very enjoyable saison with drinkability absolutely in it's favor. Would recommend to the farmhouse ale fan, or those just getting into the wonderful world of brettanomyces."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - It's a great offering from Prairie. I'd tone down the carb a bit and make the nose more fragrant. Other than that, spot on saison."
""
""
""
"Clean, refreshing, high apparent bitterness. Like an Pilsner/Saison/American Pale Ale in one. The hops assert themselves enough to be the dominant component and linger in the finish, but not overbalance the biscuity malt or spice of the yeast . Highly sessionable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hops carry more than their fair share of the load with some zesty yeast and sourdough bread. Yeast is there, but it is not as soft and complex as say, a Saison Dupont. A touch overcarbonated, but nothing a few swirls of the glass cant fix. Id rather a saison be overcarbed than under. Its a pretty damn good saison, one of the most rustic versions you will find this side of the Atlantic...I am really happy to have a good pseudo-local saison producer so close. Cheers to you Prairie."
""
"O- This beer is working on so many different levels. Definitely a hopped up Saison but there's more to it than just that."

""
""

""
""
"Pours a clear golden with a big fluffy white head. Aromas of lime and some clove. Taste begins with a tart citrus flavor, followed by a touch of funk in the middle, and a grassy, woody finish. Mouthfeel is super smooth and creamy. Overall a good Saison. I think I prefer hop forward beers to have a more neutral yeast though."
"Very drinkable and interesting, nice flavors for the ABV. Definitely looking forward to checking out more from this brewery."

"Pours a moderately hazy orange with minimal white head and not much retention. Nose features bright lemon notes along with citrusy hops, a bit of saison funk, and a touch of black pepper. Taste is fruit forward with huge lemon and orange that provides an initial sweetness followed by a mild acidic wave. The finish features strong spicy character with black pepper notes present. Mouthfeel is well carbonated and light bodied. Overall, this is a nice and refreshing saison that would make a good drinker on summer days. A nice ""Standard"" saison."

"O: Really unique American take on a Wallonian saison. So far, Prairie is three for three in my book. I highly recommend this beer and this brewery to fans of funky, idiosyncratic Belgian-inspired ales."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The flavor grows after some sipping and the Belgian yeast leaves its mark on your tongue, but it also gets more harsh. This would be a good one for Trader Joe's to put in cans. It's hardly worth the price they're asking. Bought at Bottleworks in San Diego."
"Nostalgia aside, this beer is very well made and is world-class."
"Overall- A nice hoppy sessionable saison. I'm glad I finally got around to trying this one."
""
""
""
"Overall, really solid beer. At first, I did not much care for it, but it really grew on me throughout the tasting. Love the take on the style, shows hops do have a place in the Saison style."
""
""
""
""
"T: Lemon, some light bready malt, green apple skin, chardonnay grapes, a touch of funk, white pepper and a lingering grassy hop note. Ends on a slightly peppery and dry hop note. Could use just a touch more carbonation, but a really nice saison."

"Poured into a tulip glass, this farmhouse style beer pours a hazy yellow color with a good-sized white head. Its` nose has white grape, lemon, grass and some soap. Interesting smell, a nice one to be sure. The taste is more lemon, pepper, a funk certainly presents itself, grassy, yeast. I was a bit skeptical, but this is no sub-par table saison. Mouthfeel is medium and it is fairly bitter in the finish. But, it leaves you craving some more of it. All in all, a really nice, flavorful beer with interesting characteristics to it. It`s good to know that I have a few more in the basement."
"What better place to start with a new brewery than their standard, eh? This stuff pours a clear brass topped by a finger of dirty white foam. The nose comprises wheat, mild orange zest, light sweet biscuit, and a general sense of a rustic field (or something along those lines). The taste brings in more of the same, along with a pervasive rustic tartness. There's some decent funk in here, but it doesn't go overboard. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a damn solid saison, heavy on both the funk and the enjoyment."
""
""
""
""
"O - Hoppy, light, citrus candy in a bottle. A unique sweetiness in their beers."
""
""

"D - Very nice, the hop aroma is excellent and the balanced finish makes for a very drinkable beer."
"Half finger head with little retention and some lacing on a clear dark golden body. Aroma is excellent with nice presence of the hops including lemon zest, peppercorn, grapefruit, tangerine and mild yeast presence. Flavor of bready malts, belgian yeast, lemon zest, sweet and mildly tart citrus, grass and club soda. Medium body and moderate carbonation with only a semidry finish. Very nice hop additions here with the saison and Belgian presence at the base which is well balanced and not overwhelmed by the hops."

"O - This is a well crafted Saison that would do well for anyone venturing into this style. Wish I could find beer like this in WI for summer. Thanks to deadonhisfeat for sending one my way."
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Light, shallow hue, with only a slight head and no real lacing. Nose is a really strong combination of pine, honey, and spice. Flavor is a lightly hopped hay with a subtle touch of fermented fruit. Overall, this is a good quaff."

"Very nice, traditional saison."

"Pours a hazy gold with towering soapy head, slowly settling to a thin layer with a couple of rings of sticky lace left behind. Smell: tangerine, spiciness, apricot, dough, dry grass. Taste: grapefruit zest, sweet orange, pepper, grape and grassy notes. Medium bodied, light carbonation, juicy feel. Really nice."

"Overall: Nice beer. Not extremely memorable, but tasty. Look forward to more of these guys offerings."
"This poured out as a hazy golden yellow color with a white head on top. The head is fizzy looking but has a good retention and a light scattered lacing. The smell is spicy and herbal. Very interesting on the nose. The taste of the beer is also a little on the spicy side some earthy grain and a dryness in the finish. The mouthfeel is well carbonated and light bodied. Overall it's a pretty good Saison, would enjoy trying their other beers."

"What a nice beer! It kind of combines the feel and character of a Saison with the flavor of an American Pale Ale or American Pale Wheat Ale. Very refreshing and easy-drinking, but with some complexity. I predict I will be buying 6-packs of this beer over the summer to serve as a go-to thirst-quencher."

"O-A very enjoyable saison and a nice intro to the style for those that want to baby step into the ""funk"". On the hoppier side for the style. Prairie is kind of taking the state of OK by storm with their brews and I can see why."

"O: Can't say farmhouse/saisons are the style of beer I seek, but it's not bad. I'd probably wouldn't choose to have this again, but that's not because of the eer itself as it is to the style."
""
""
"O: A fantastic summer saison that is clean and crisp. Super great flavors. I'm proud of this Oklahoma breed creation. I can't wait to pick up a sixer. Cheers!"
"O: A delightful American saison. Not Americanized, this is to style and very well done."
""
""
"O: A solid standard. I do feel like there are too many similar flavors here and they do stumble together rather than having the elements complement each other. I'd still buy this again."
""

"One of the more unique saison-type things I've encountered. A super unique fruitiness that works well with the blatant, yet mellow, Belgian yeast."
"Very rustic with a very unique hop profile. A really nice American interpretation of a Belgian Saison."
""
"An excellent saison, and I am so glad I came across another Prairie Artisan offering. Really well done. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
"O: well the name of the beer really is best way to describe it. This is about as solid as you can get in terms of a Standard Belgian saison it has the farmhouse distinctive smell and taste with a nice light crisp drinkable feel. I highly recommend this beer and I looking forward to trying more from this OK brewery"
"Overall quite a nice beer, the screw top is the only real downer (and lack of date). decent appearance, nice floral nose between the malts, hops, and saison aromas, and quite a nice surprise with the farmhouse funk flavor, and blend of nice hops that get a decent bitterness on the finish. I would drink a lot of these in the summer, and I think i will."
"A nice, mellow, standard Saison. I'm not sure anything sets this apart from the rest, but nothing draws me away from it either. Great intro Saison. I think it fits its name very well."
""
"This is a very nice beer and I am sure I will have no problem going through the case I picked up. Sort of reminds me of a batch of Fantome Printemps I recently had."
"Pours a glowy golden color, relatively light. Mildly cloudy. Big white head puffs up quickly and sticks around for some time. Lots of big bubbles. Aroma is apple/pear cider, earthy and mineral-ish flavors and a grassy hoppiness. There's a little spice of spice in the mix, possibly from the hops. Some nice bready grain notes. It's nice just a bit weak, and that apple cider flavor dominates. Mild funk. The taste is an improvement for me. On the palate, it's a pleasant, mildly sweet saison with a light spicy hoppiness. Quite refreshing. Dries out in the finish. Bright malt flavor and a spicy, floral hop bitterness. More funk. Very nice beer. Pretty gentle carbonation for the style. Light mouthfeel. Very easy to drink. Another very good beer from Prairie. I preferred Prairie Hop and Prarie Ale, but this is an impressive beer to see in 12 ounce packs. I look forward to more from the brewery."

"Pours a murky light orange with a foamy beige head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks and dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, pepper, lime juice, and citrus zest. Taste is much the same with peppery and chalky flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of citrus zest bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with some great aromas and flavors that make this one super easy to drink."

"***One of the best hoppy Saison ales I think I've had. It's not overly funky and Bretty, but, but the hop and Saison funk marriage is well executed were neither outshine the other. Awesome!"
""
""
""
"O: Easy drinking and refreshing. A starter and not something to turn to after having anything bigger since this is more delicate and simple. Look forward to trying others from this brewery."
""

"O - I liked this beer a lot. Very flavorful saison that has good complexity and balance and a nice assertive hop bitterness. Went out on a limb on this one and turned out to be a good find. Definitely see myself buying more of this especially during the summer time. How can you go wrong with a bottle that has artwork showing instructions for ""noodling"" (i.e. - sticking your hand in underwater holes to catch catfish)...great stuff!"
""
"A good domestic version of the style. Hits the right points, and has enough complexity. Some flaws, but fairly drinkable."

"12 oz. bottle served in a Prairie tulip glass. Pours a cloudy, yellow golden color with a thin off-white head. Aroma is a bit of straw, pepper, fruity esters, and earthy/grassy hops. Flavor is pale malts, grainy, pepper, lemon, yeasty, and a hint of funk. Mouthfeel is light, dry, refreshing and slightly bitter. Really good beer, great session beer."

"O-a nice sessionable Saison with good flavor, a great summer beer"

"This is an enjoyable beer. Anyone looking for a different take on the saison style would enjoy this beer. Personally, I'll probably continue to drink local and buy Oxbow when I want a hoppy saison, but I am excited to see what else Prairie sends to us in Maine."
""
""
""
"O - This is really nice. low ABVs make this real drinkable. real light on the tongue. altho the high carbonation makes this bubble in the tummy. so can't have too many. It could be a bit thicker. that being said - i would buy this again."
""
"The beer's high rate of drinkability makes it seducing. It's easy to ignore its clean taste as lacking complexity. But its balance and subtlties rewards the patient drinker drink after drink. It's about as close as Belgians get to session ales."
""
""
""
"Fairly complex, with enough farmhouse character to add intrigue, and enough supporting flavor to excite the palate, which most examples of the style tend to lack."
"Easy drinker, this will be a go to beer as long as I can find it. Fairly subtle, but flavorful enough to make want another. Would love to try this on draft to get a comparison. I could tear up some sushi, Thai or Indian food with this!"
"O: A straight forward, yet tasty Saison. Solid, but nothing special."

"This beer is really what I search for. There is a ton of flavor in a 5.2% beer. I really enjoyed this a lot and look forward to trying more of Prairie's offerings in the future. (Also, from what I understand, this is the brewer from Redbud....Cuvee 3 and 4 are awesome beers too....someone is doing it right!)"
"Served in Prairie Artisan Ales glassware - nice! Looks great, clear goldenrod with an inch-thick cap of white foam that lays down a few rings of lace. Excellent balance of flavors - tropical fruits, honey, lime, pepper, clove, and a punch of spicy hops. Malt is clean with a light sugar cookie sweetness and rustic cereal flavor. More refined than the bottled version. A sessionable, flavorful, locally brewed saison. What's not to like? A new go-to at better beer bars."
"The beer pours a transparent golden with two fingers of white foam. It has an herby, sour smell. The taste is crisp and slightly sour with hints of orange and sour apple. The mouthfeel seemed both crisp and flat. Not too sour along with a manageable ABV make this a very drinkable beer."

"O-Such a great session saison. They hoppy notes of citrus really take this one way over the top. I only wish I had this on the shelves locally. Also worth noting: the best beer label I've seen in some years... absolutely hilarious."
"Love to see a 5% ABV Saison! Awesome aroma, fresh and dry with plenty of hop character while not taking over the other flavors. Needs a little more carbonation, it's low right off the bat and quickly drops off. Very good. This is the first beer I've had from Prairie and I'm excited to try more. I could drink a sixer of this anytime."
