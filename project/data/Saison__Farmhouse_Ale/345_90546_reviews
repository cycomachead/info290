"Not my cupo tea.  It was overly floral and perfume like.  Way to much in the way of herbs and flowers"

"Not a huge fan of Saisons but I actually enjoyed this one! Light body, you get little bits of the herbs and spices so it's not over seasoned (I guess you can say lol) it has more of a wheat beer finish. In all, it's a chill session saison that you can totally eat dinner with (I suggest apricot baked chicken on a bed Orzo Pasta!)"

"O- Certainly fits the billing of a session saison.  Could easily drink a few of these on a sunny spring or summer day.  I wish it had more complexity, but it is a reasonable interpretation of the style that successfully represents even with the low ABV. (3.52)"

"05/14/14 On tap. Be aware of the peppercorns that meet you at the door. In tandem w/the lemon this is a perfect match for a few chicken skewers, on a bed of spinach with a crumble of blue cheese. If you don't have the facilities to do this yourself, go straight to your friendly local & demand they support your research & get on it. Ever had a lemon-pepper chicken dish? Or used a lemon-pepper seasoning in a salad? Well here's your old friend...in a glass. A word to the wise is sufficient. PS it's way session-able, so grab a 6 & fire up the coals."

"O: I can safely say this was the worst beer I've ever had. I'm not sure if this was a skunk batch or what, but I could not believe Victory would release a beer like that."

"Overall, this is a tasty saison and gets a bit of a bonus for keeping the alcohol down."

"Pours very pale gold, a little hazy, 1/4 inch white head. Peppery spicy belgian yeast nose. Tart, citrus taste with a peppery hop. Spicy. Buzzes in the mouth during and after. Lively saison. Snaps to a close."

"Overall it is as advertised, but it's also a little bit weak and boring."
"O - very easy to drink. Light and refreshing. Perfect for a hot day."
""
""
"Basically a middle of the road saison. Nothing really outstanding about it, but nothing really wrong either. I would like to see the hops dialed back a bit, I think they are dominating a bit too much and overwhelming the other flavors. It does go down easy, but pretty much an average beer for the style."
""
""
""
"Overall: A pretty terrific domestic saison. It hits all the notes - great aroma, nice citrus and lemon flavor, appealing dry pepper finish. Would drink again."
""
""
"Was pleasantly surprised by this low octane offering from my neighborhood brewery. As compared to other Victory offerings this beer was more mellow in taste without giving up on the uniqueness that has become Victory. The copious amounts of lemon zest contribute well to this beer as does the other spices."
""
"Poured a cloudy golden color with a thin ring of white lacing. Nice, though a bit more head would be better, but it looks like a quite nice saison. Scents of sour funk, barnyard-like mostly, with a tang of lemon, undertones of pepper spiciness and hints of floral and herbal hops. A good, funky, lemon-rich, spicy aroma, leaning towards the funky citrus side of the saison spectrum and not the sweet fruity side. Flavor begins with a large amount of of lemon zest, moving into a moderate peppery spiciness, further lemon zest and some moderate hoppy bitterness, mostly floral. A bit high on bitterness for a saison. Moderate levels of dry, grainy malt appear in the middle. Finish is dry with moderate-high hop bitterness, lemon zest and slight white pepper. Aftertaste is grainy and dry with notes of floral hops and white pepper. A good overall flavor profile, perhaps a bit high in hop bitterness for a saison, but with a nice, traditional white pepper and lemon zest character. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium-high carbonation and a drying feel. A good, true to style, classic saison feel, very well done. Overall this is a pretty good saison that has a fantastic aroma, a good, though slightly too hoppy flavor and an excellent mouthfeel. Good, but not the best American saison, still quite nice."
""
""
""
"Overall- Unlike my first Saison, which snuck up on you with its 8.7% ABV, this one is “What you see is what you get” – sessionable at its 4.5% ABV, with no surprises"
""
""
""
"Big, fluffy white head that really lasted left lots of clumpy foam clinging to the glass. The beer is crystal clear and a bright yellow/gold. Nice aroma with notes of grain and spices, slightly sour wheat, a bit grassy with a hint of coriander and parsley. The flavour was a little less interesting but still alright, with mild bitterness and spice, moderate sweetness and grain character, a bit of lemon character, lingering spice and bitterness. Medium bodied, low to medium carbonation, decent texture but maybe a bit heavier than expected."

"Picked up this one as part of a mixed 6 at the local store. Generally like Saisons and have had pretty good luck with Victory. Okay appearance but nailed the smell, gives you that good Saison vibe. Taste however returns to okay. Not bad, decent Saison but nothing special. Probably would not get the beer again but would certainly not turn one down."
"Pairings: Dry enough for fish, white fowl and mixed nuts, bright enough for salads, fruits and cheeses, serve early in a meal. Not sweet, but citrusy and acidic enough for white wine appropriate foods."

"Pepper, oranges and bright lemon on the palate. Ginger and lime in the finish. This is a fresh tasting and spiced up saison. Nice summer sessioner, probably a real nice fit with some tangy cheese, raw shell fish, salads. You get the picture"
""
""
""
"Just noticed the laundry list that Victory now puts out, and my hopes now rest on the Victory Altbier offering that I saw advertised with Sierra Nevada Beer Camp tour / 12 pack coming July-2014."

"O: An enjoyable saison. Will be nice this spring/summer season. Glad I bought a six of this. Victory does no wrong !"
"Overall a nice, refreshing beer. Would have liked some of the peppery spice from the scent to have made it into the taste. Nevertheless, a nice front porch sipper for the first day that feels like spring in Ohio."
""
"O: Overall lots of tart and musky nature packed in a 4.5% abv package makes for a great session style saision."
""
""
"O: refined, quite easy to drink... very much a Saison in its flavor characteristics... they did manage to pack a lot of flavor into this beer, though maybe nothing unique (had some strong similarities to Dupont) - but it's hard to knock it... something to keep in the cooler at a bbq"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not sure what I was expecting but it wasn't this. I will say that it isn't watery at all which is usually the first issue that session beers have to overcome. It seems that tasting too much like a standard lager might be the issue with session saisons."
""
"O: I liked this beer, but the phenols are pretty hefty by the end of the pint. Perfect for one, but I was ready to move on when it was done. Still, a really nice, earthy, scrappy saison."
""
"I really enjoyed this beer I would certainly drinking again"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a beautiful hazed lemon yellow with about a fingers worth of white foam that fell quickly. Nose is funky with Belgian yeast and has some bright sweet lemon peel. There's a tiny bit of spice on the nose too. Taste is simple and graceful. Bright lemon, a bit tart, on a sweet light dry cracker. Sparkling carbonation and a touch of pepper as it finishes. This beer is everything a saison should be. Has a very pleasant hop herbal on the nose and a bit of spice in the drink. As you drink you will find a delightful tartness to offer just a slight bit of pucker. Has plenty of juicy lemon on the palate and a crisp off dry finish."

"O/D-A bit of a let down. A session Saison sounds awesome. Eh, I'm sure someone will nail it at some point."

"Not my favorite, but a solid beer and a must have for saison lovers."
""
""

"Overall: I think this beer is best served with a pork loin. The amount of spices in it would work well with the food. Other than that, a nice Saison at 4.5%."

"This is definitely a well made beer, as most are from Victory, but the concept behind the spicing baffles me. It tastes way too savory and herbal, like chicken stuffing. It just left me with an odd impression. It's a beer worth trying, but I'm not sure how many people this will appeal to."
"O - Good beer in my opinion, although not very much like a saison in my opinion. I could definitely drink a few of these."
""
"O: Solid saison beer and at only 4.5% you can have more then a few. Was missing some of the fruit notes and yeast tartness I like in saisons. Great spring weather beer."

"O: good try here by victory. A session saison is a rare one to come across. Not quite as dry or spicy as I'd like but this is a real nice one."
""
""
"O: Saisons are not exactly my go to style, but this one in particular was not a stunner. The white pepper and clove really conflict with the crisp citrus and Belgian yeast. I'm glad I didn't get a whole 6 pack."
""
"If the goal was to create a sessionable saison, then I would say Victory certainly did their job. It is an interesting, flavorful, moderately bitter saison with lots of citrus, making it suitable for the spring, summer, and lots of cuisine. However, my only complaint with this beer is that it tires the palate, and not because it is overly heavy or too hoppy, but because it should be dialed down a few more notches. I liked Classique a lot (which I reviewed but a few days ago) because it was SO basic and well executed. I find this to be ""reaching"" so to speak...Nonetheless, great well crafted beer!"
""
"Has a golden yellow color with a very healthy white foam. Smell is lemon, but the taste is a little weak. There’s a hint of lemon and some light spices in the finish. Otherwise the beer is a little bland. Has a nice carbonated feel, but overall is just okay."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 8/13/2013. Pours moderately hazy golden straw color with a 2-3 finger dense and rocky white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon zest, orange zest, pear, coriander, clove, pepper, ginger, wheat, bread, floral, grass, herbal, and yeast earthiness. very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of yeast ester, spice, and moderate malt notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon zest, orange zest, pear, coriander, clove, pepper, ginger, wheat, bread, floral, grass, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of lemon, pear, coriander, clove, pepper, cracker, bread, floral, grass, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, spice, and moderate malt flavors; with great flavor robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice session saison style. Nice complexity, balance, and robustness of yeast, spice, and moderate malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"O: A spicey (boarderline overboard), dry, saison that doesn't live up to the session name. If this beer would have been lighter on the spices and slighly less carbonated I might be able to get behind it but overall I'm not a fan."

"The taste is as herbal as it smells with a pleasant toasted pale maltiness, slightly lemony, and a low to moderate hop bitterness at the finish. I enjoyed it and would drink it again."
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium-light in body, with carbonation of medium intensity, resulting in a slightly effervescent, then foamy and slightly smooth mouthfeel. Closes dry, with substantial stickiness lingering on the lips and palate."

"Great spring/summer season beer, and with the lower ABV - you can put a few back and still mow the lawn!"
""
"Very easy to drink on this especially hot and humid day. Very solid saison from Victory."
""
""
"That said, I LOVE Victory Hop Wallop!"
"O- a flavorful Saison that is too spiced to serve as a session beer for some. Nice and reffreshig, nonetheless, on a hot summer day."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: complex and refreshing, however more balance is in order. This is perhaps a bit too spicy and limits your desire to have more than one on those hot days."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Good for what it is, but the spice is just a bit too much in my opinion. Close to being great, but still not bad."
"O: Swing...and a miss. This one was quite disappointing, considering Victory makes another saison that's really damn good. And it's another damning reminder that they really need to put Helios in 6-packs!"
""
""
"O: Hit the mark on being a flavorful, low alcohol beer wish would be a refreshing choice for lunch if you had been working the farm under a hot Summer Sun. The flavors profile is a bitter light but the flavors see strong against the lighter backdrop."
""
""
""
"P.S. I'm just a bit biased towards Victory products. But only because they honestly do rock."
""
"O- white not the most flavorful Saison, it does a good job for its purpose, as a sessionable beer. It drinks more like a witbier with some Saison flavors. A good switch up on a hot summer day as it is very drinkable"
"O: Underrated Saison - sessionable at 4.5 ABV and yet has some Saison body. Really good."

"Served from tap into a Trappe Door tulip. Poured golden with a two finger white head that subsided to a half finger slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, banana, fruit, sugar, banana runts, wheat, and bubblegum. The flavor was of sweet malt, wheat, bubblegum, fruit, spice, and subtle banana. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The banana runt aspect on the aroma really took this one to the next level as it was definitely unexpected and took me back to my favorite candy growing up and still is the only candy that I eat at all even today. This brought a huge level of complexity to the game and made it quite easy to get close to this beer over and over again. I really went into this one not expecting much at all, but was pleasantly surprised with it in both the flavor and aroma. Definitely glad I got the chance to try this one and suggest that you do the same at least once yourself."
""
"A solid session saison."
""
"12oz bottle, pours golden, slight haze, creamy, white head, good head retention. Fruity aroma with plenty of citrus rind - lemon and orange, biscuity grain, yeast. Refreshing shot of zesty lemon and orange, Farmhouse yeast, biscuit, slightly bitter finish with a hint of peppery spice, while being slightly earthy. Lighter body and lower carbonation - I thought it needed a bit more carbonation. Overall, super refeshing, nice addition of American hops to a Belgian styled ale. I definitely could have a few on a hot summer day."
""
""
"O: I'm not sure about this one. It has way more funk and black pepper flavor than I would have expected. But it's lacking the complexity that makes the best saisons stand out. I suppose not completely unexpected for the quite modest ABV and the subsequent ""Session"" tag. This one falls into the ""glad I tried it once"" category for me."
""
"The two fingers of rocky, bone-white head rose and fell like an elevator (simile) as I poured it from the bottle into a shaker pint glass. Finally, it simply fell like a souffle when the oven door is banged shut. Doing that to a souffle disturbs me, but the gorgeous lacing that this left behind did wonders for my attitude. Color was a cloudy golden-yellow and i must have disturbed the lees as it was initially pouring very clear. I am glad that the yeast is back in suspension as that is where the flavor is derived and who ever heard of filtering a Saison? Nose on this was full-on lemon zest, leading me to wonder what spices were used. I'd bet that coriander was one of them. Mouthfeel seemed to be on the thin side, tending to watery. Is that a characteistic of the style, I wonder? The taste was still very lemony, but now the black pepper phenols were really beginning to assert themselves. I spoke, in my previous review of Ithaca's Ground Break, of pairing a Saison with grilled fish, like bass. This beer would also work well, but as a second choice. I liked it, but not as much as the previous one. Finish was dry and lemon-peppery and a nice representation of the style as I understand it. Worth a go!"

"This is a light bodied brew that is fittingly dry, crisp and refreshing. For being a smaller sessionable saison it is a little rough around the edges."

"much spice and too little maltiness for my tastes."
""
""

"D+"
"Overall, I think this saison relies a little too much on spicing (which is a pet peeve of mine in saisons). I think victory could have made a more complex beer by drawing back on the spices and pushing yeast esters/phenols a little more. Overall this is pretty awesome for the hot weather we've been having, but it has its flaws. I should say, though, that it could be worse: it could be sweet, under-carbonated, and overly phenolic."
""
""
""
"An interesting beer with lots of character. Unfortunately, I doubt I would want another right after which kind of kills it for being a session beer. Otherwise enjoyable."
""
""
"A pretty good session saison and definitely worth checking out. I definitely plan on picking another one up if I can find one."
""
""
"Hazy straw-yellow pour with a finger or so of foamy white head that retained as a ringlet; small amount of lacing. In the nose, pale malts, toasted grains, yeast, essence of citrus and grass. Pale/pils malts in the taste, grassy, slightly musty, saison-y spice notes, hints of lemon zest. Not bad, but as with most saisons made by the ""big boys," this one just doesn't cut it with me. Light-medium body, crisp and drinkable, just not something I'd go for again."
""
""
""
""
"O - Good saison, not much to go into about this one."
"The alcohol in this was light enough that if I wanted more in one session, it would be easy to take another and pop it open. Although it's night now, this would be great to have on a nice sunny day when a watered-down lawnmower beer won't do. It's not too spicy, sour, or funky and for someone looking for a light take on this style, this would be a great place to start. There's enough ""swing"" in this beer to please nearly everyone."

"A really nice easy drinking summer saison, low in ABV but complex and bitter enough to make the craft beer drinker happy. Recommended."
"Overall, I'm not sure I'd call it a saison. But I like it as a session beer with good bitterness and some funk."

"I'd make a Swing Kids reference, but no one saw that movie (and I don't fully remember it, myself). Anyway, this stuff pours a partly cloudy straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises lemon peel, coriander, sweet flowers, and light funky wheat. That lemon is rather strong, but luckily not artificial. The taste holds notes of old and musty lemon (both zest and rind) and a mild blend of vague spices, which are nearly out-shouted by the lemon. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, this saison just didn't work. I'm assuming a lackluster yeast performance, but it was just a never-ending blast of bad citrus with occasional bits of muddled spices. Definitely not for me."
""
"O-Too herbal and grass for my liking, more lemon and spice notes would have improved the beer."
""
""
"Overall: Not a bad beer, but if it's meant to be a session beer I'm not sure they succeeded. While it has a low ABV, I think they overdid it with the spices which makes it difficult to have more than 1 or 2."
"Pours a hazy yellow with a foamy off-white head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. A foamy curtain of lace coats the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, citrus zest, yeast, and spice aromas. Taste is much the same with strong citrus zest and spice flavors on the finish. There is a high amount of spice bitterness that lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is drinkable but the smell is much better than the taste in my opinion."
"Served up at Mad Mex pours with a gracious white capped head, eggshell white lovely and textured with effervescent carbonation the body is golden slightly hazed nice looking beer served into their house pint glasses. Aroma has citrus, floral and earthy spice, peppery with a yeast presence driven in this fine tasting session ale from Victory. Flavors were light palatable and complex. I got a lot of citrus fruit, spicy pepper, mango, guava tropical notes with a bready yeast appreciation that kept the beer flowing on the palate. Light herbal grassiness is I'm guessing the hop presence in this beer known as Swing Session Saison. I wish more beers out there had this much complexity in an under 5% alcohol by volume. Medium to light bodied carried by lively carbonation spices tend to sit on the palate between sips, but this was pure session ale. I doubt you will be able to have just one go forth and enjoy this type of beer with friends, I know I did."
""
""
""
"O: One of the better low ABV beers I've had in a while. A great late spring to summer brew."
""
""
""
"Thoroughly interesting light beer, but it's the driest Saison I've ever tasted. Pleasant brett flavor. It reminds me of Green Flash Rayon Vert, with the dry funkiness. From the 12 oz bottle purchased at Bottleworks in San Diego."
""
"O: Definitely an easy to drink beer with a low ABV which makes it sessionable, unfortunately it is not as complex as some other saisons but there is a nice light lemony freshness to it. Enjoyable but not anything special - somewhat pedestrian."
""
""
""
"Crisp and light and flowing nicely, it's pretty smooth all the way through. For a time, it seems to threaten to foam out of the mouth. It doesn't, though, and that's good."
"I am a bit surprised by the amount of citrus and pepper that comes through in this beer. I can't say that it is way too much but it certainly dominates the flavor for me. I enjoy the flavors but I am not sure it lends to it being a great ""session"" Saison."
""
""
""
"D - I love the words ""session"" and ""Saison..."" So I needless to say, I was eager to give this one a try... I was unfortunately a bit let down... This isn't a bad beer by any stretch, but it pushes the style guidelines and not in a good way... There are both many session beers and Saisons that I would recommend over this offering..."
""
"Quite dry, with a strong coriander and clove bite. Complex flavor with a low pale malt touch and a moderate white pepper hop finish. The aftertaste reminds me of fresh basil and oregano. The body is good if thin and highly carbonated. For me, the lack of earthy and sour flavors make this a more enjoyable, if slightly off style, Saison."
"this victory swing is a nice summertime beer. there is a lot of hops in this flavor- but also a good amount of citrus and i feel like even peach flavors here. all of these flavors come together nice and theyre not over bearing. makes for a clean drinkable brew. this is a good beer if you are a fan of flavorful beers..and you want to unwind on a warm evening."
""
"Overall not bad, it surprised me a little too with some nice saison farmhouse funk and juicy flavors, I liked the citrus flavors, but they seem to lose the point of a good saison a bit if they brewed it WITH spices since that should already come from the yeast, and I think that brings a bit too much of the spices and that green stem tannic flavor. However, very drinkable and I would call this a session beer easily, and fairly tasty."
""
""
""
""
"This is really quite good."
"Session Saison gets points for bravery in its bold additions of ingredients, but in its execution its resulted in flavors much out of balance."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a pretty good saison."
""
"O: Not necessarily a bad beer, but certainly unfocused. Still, not undrinkable."
""
"The beer pours a straw yellow color with some nice light golden tints and a soft white head that fizzles away to just a scrim, leaving some medium sheets of tight-bubbled lacing on the glass. As you sip the beer though, it tends to only leave thin and droopy tendrils of lacing on the glass. In the body, the beer is properly hazy, though some light does make its way through the beer. The beer also displays a nice torrent of bubbles working their way to the head. On the nose, the beer is nicely pungent from the moment it pours. It smells of funky straw and lemon grains with touches of banana and cloves with just a hint of uncharacterized spice in the nose. The yeast esters are very big and tangible on the nose, almost dripping off, which is lovely in a 4.5% beer. The overall mélange of smells does give a slightly skunked smell, but I think that is more from all of the spices and yeast esters mixing together into a strange potpourri, and less from light exposure. On the tongue, the beer tastes of grassy bitters, sweet spices, and funky yeast character that moves from bitter to sweet, to acidic, and leaves a nice bit of neutralizing saliva behind. In flavors, the beer begins with funky bitter grass, which opens into lovely banana esters with touches of cloves and some coriander as well. Lemon citrus runs on the lesser side of the flavors, and melds with some of the breadier characteristics of the yeast and the light clean malt flavors. The finish is big with coriander spice, slight orange peel, and some funky banana/clove esters, and the aftertaste continues this with the addition of slightly medicinal, grassy bitters that tingle on the tongue. Judging by the taste, I would not say this beer is 4.5% ABV. In the mouth, the beer feels medium to medium-light in body with a big fluffy carbonation that provides some tongue scrubbing to keep the sweeter yeast and spice characteristics from overpowering the bitters. The mouth is left slightly chalky and tingling with some saliva on the sides of the tongue. Overall, this is a great normal saison, and the fact that it is 4.5% and fully sessionable makes it all the better. Its flavor profile slightly reminded me of a less coriander-heavy Hennepin from Brewery Ommegang. It was phenomenally full of flavor, and comparable to my personal favorite session saison, Notch Sasion. My one complaint with this beer is that, in the belly, it seems to carry a little bit more weight than I normally like from a 4.5% beer, but it is not to such a degree that it ruins this beer. This beer is good, and great for a long drinking night. Try it."
""
"This will be a good lawn mower beer, if lawn mower season ever arrives in Chicago. A very enjoyable, refreshing session beer. Low ABV for a Saison, but surprisingly satisfying."
"Overall: this is a decent beer that would make a great lawnmower beer. It's not too sweet to session, nor too dry to quaff liberally. I'd like to give this beer another try in the summer."
""
"Not a bad Saison...nothing great...good enough"
""
""
"hazy yellow, prickly froth, some retention. Big saison notes with yeast and spice, light earthyness, lemon, fresh flowers. Taste leads with flowers, moves in with some spice before mellowing a bit into a nice bready profile with a kiss of lemon. Lighter side of medium, ample carbonation. Strong flavor from a beer of this ABV profile. Nice new seasonal."

"This poured a hazy lemon yellow with a wispy head and lively carbonation. Lots of wheat and Belgian yeast in the nose. Very much a summer beer, with strong tastes of wheat, citrus, coriander, pepper, a bit of lavender? Mouthfeel is light, ending very crisp. This is a really nice beer--it really is an easy-drinking saison which you could have a few of without thinking too hard about it."

"All in all I think it's decent, drinkable beer."
"O: One of my favorite beers this year – a sunny day in a bottle. I can’t think of anything I’d rather have for a lawnmower beer."
""
""
""
"O - A nice saison that isn't overly complex but goes down easy and tasty. Would definitely try again"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A solid light session version of a Saison. Nice mix of funk and citrus."
""
""
"O- Decent but ends up being a little too heavy in the spice department. Reminds me of a fruity version of Saison du Buff (DFH version)."
""
""

"Pours a clear straw golden color with a creamy white head. Spicy and yeasty nose, earthy and grassy, slight bitterness. Medium full body, well carbonated, clean dry finish. Flavor is earthy and grassy with some pepper spice. Refreshing, crisp and easy drinking."

"A really good beer, I like a big spice profile from time to time and this fit the bill, but at the same time it is really there and i can see why many dont like this. A nice summer beer that many types of people can enjoy. Although, stylistically,more of a Belgian pale than a Saison, but whateves."

"Saisons are one of my favorite styles and this one strayed to far from my expectations. I may have one more because Victory is a brewery I respect and honestly I had high hopes for this beer."

"The body is transparent and pale straw with a little over an inch of fluffy white head. the aroma brings hops, funk, farm, sunshine, lemons, lemon rind, grass, a touch of spice. Nice floral notes and hops. Light and refreshing. I'm really digging the light body and low alcohol. A thirst quencher of a beer, and packed with flavor. I'll have no trouble with this sixer and definitely see this as a repeat purchase for hot weather beer consumption, i.e. lawnmowing beer."
""
"Overall: I like this beer. It's definitely very spicy but not so much that I don't it. Not my favorite but good none the less"
"Overall: I'd always thought the Victory V / Helios Ale saison was a bit too chewy for me, bodywise. This new Swing Session Saison is bright, light, and refreshing."
""
"Notes: A solid U.S made Saison and very drinkable. Cheers."
"Swing Session Ale is a pretty nice release from Victory. For a lower abv Saison, it’s pretty tasty. No, it’s nowhere near competing with an authentic Belgian Saison. Having said that, it’s rather impressive for what it is. Definitely worth checking out."
""
""
"Overall I'm a fan of this divergent sasion. The spices are interesting and give it a freshness. Might be a little too much for those who are flavor purists."
""
"O-as a sessionable Saison this beer was very solid, but within the category is not as stellar as many others"
""
"7.0/10"
""
""
"O - not my personal preference, but a refreshing drink. I'll god drink some stouts now"
""
""
"Taste is zesty and spicy, with a tangy twist of sour citrus hops at the finish. A very enjoyable ale."
""
""
"O- This is almost a mix between a shandy and a lemon cleaner. It looks good, but pretty much goes downhill from there."
""
"Overall – The initial tastes, mouthfeel, and look were all very nice, but the finish to the taste, with its big funky, grassy, haylike, and bitter flavors weren’t balanced out by enough wheaty/bready flavors/body."
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a bright yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of spices, grassy, a bit of fruits. Taste is good, citrus, spices, grassy, malts, flavorful and complex, very tasty. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall this is a solid beer."
""
"The first sip was really offensive but it got better, maybe my tongue just needed to adjust. Light sparkly body musty belgian funk, banana notes spicy finish. Prickly with barnyard flavors. Not as refreshing as they planned i think a definitely a musty tasting beer. Also for being something sessionable it is incredibly filling. Also it starts to get a bit soapy as you go on drinking it on the back end. Also now picking up some buttered toasted biscuit flavors. Drinkable once you get acquainted with a soft sweetness, mild bitterness and possibly too much spice. Wouldn't recommend it or suggest it."

"Overall (4.25): This is a really great saison. I suspect that those who really didn’t care for it aren’t interested in more traditional saisons, given the penchant for high-ABV, soured, and barrel-aged saisons that a lot of BAs have. And I’m not knocking them, per se—it’s just a shame that smaller, dry, spicy, and for once AFFORDABLE saisons like this get passed over. Hopefully this one doesn’t become a sleeper, and hopefully Victory makes a shitload of this one. Great job, guys."

"OVERALL: A good, perhaps slightly over spiced saison. Not bad, but for a session, one is more than enough. Good lawn mower beer."
"meh, add it to the legions of average generic American saisons. the pour is clear and really light shaded yellow, funny looking for the style. there is an inch of white head on top without a ton of retention. the nose is bright and fruity, crisp yet yeasty still, not farmy and wild like a true saison, but more cultured, more predictable. tons of coriander too. the flavor has some dry lemon tartness up front and a malt body that is just freakishly light. semi bitter towards the finish with the coriander standing out a little too much, and the yeast is like if saison yeast could be a lager yeast too, its got that cold fermented clean character to it, really out of place in a saison. for a summer drinker though, it does what it claims to do. great carbonation and a really drinkable texture, gentle and refreshing. overall this is nothing special, but its nice to have a different take on a summer beer, plus, its better than the summer beer they came out with last year. ill take it, but its tough to stack this against authentic versions of the style."

"Poured into a small tulip glass a hazed lighter golden with a bone white fluffy head atop.Aromas of medicinal hops and yeasty phenols mainly,a bit of toasted grain as well.Lightly citric up front on the palate with some toasted cereal grain,the phenols come in and provide some spice,a shot of herbal hops linger in the finish.A nice session saison it has some phenolic qualities wich Iam not a fan of but it's refreshing.Solid."
"Overall it delivers what it says a full flavored saison with light ABV for session ability. I guess if anything it could use more balance because it drinks very bitter and traditionally dry."
"O - Not all that impressed with the over all taste and appearance but for a sessionable beer it's quite good."

"Overall - I'm a big fan of Victory beers, but this one wasn't quite one of their better creations. I probably won't buy again, as Farmhouse ales are one of my favorite varieties of beer and this one is further down the list of ones I've liked. Still drinkable and decent and worth a sampling."

"O: A very nice ""session"" saison with pleasant yeast and hop notes. Refreshing with no overbearing flavors. Perfect spring-summer beer"

"This is a simple take on the saison, and it most definitely works. A good all-around saison with some nice flavors. Balanced."
""
""
"Light golden yellow on color with just the slightest haze. Poured with a thick, billowy, white foam that is endlessly fed by thousands of bubbles migrating from the bottom of the glass. Orange and lemonz est aromas with spicy corriander and lepper along with a funky yeast aroma. Smooth, creamy feel with a slighty dry finish. Light citrussy bitterness up front that rides a wave of corriander and pepper through the middle. Herbal hop and funky, yeasty notes follow the spicy flavors near the end. Finishes semi-dry with lemon zest and a light spicy aftertaste."
""
""
"o: This wasn't as good as I hoped it would be, I'll stick to their incredibly delicious and bargain priced Helios."
""
"This is a really nice Saison. It's full flavored and surprisingly intricate for what I expected to be a ""small"" beer. I could see myself working through a few of these on a hot day. It reminds me a bit of a toned down version of the Saison du BUFF. It's definitely worth a try for Saison fans."
""
""
""
"The lower ABV and quenchablity of this brew are sure to be a hit in the summer parade."
"Fuller bodied than expected and a bit more like a saison than the nose suggests but it still feels and tastes more like a witbier/American wheat beer. Subtle earthy funky with lots of zesty spice up front followed by bread/yeast, banana and citrus juice. Coriander and clove flavor with lemon zest, wheat, light fruit and lemon peel. Crisp, light, refreshing and easy to drink but I don't think anyone would say that this is a saison in a blind tasting. Not bad but reminds me of a mediocre American wheat beer."

"M: Light body here."
" The flavor is good with some yeast and spiced to begin with however there is a bit too much hop astringency with a peppery hop taste coming in mid palate and overtaking the ginger which comes off as sharp as a result. The flavor of the yeast starts to emerge as it elevates in temperature, however the clash of hops and spice is not as pleasant as I hoped without much to cushion the impact in the malt dept. Overall kind of gave me an impression of prima pils with saison yeast and spice added, but not nearly as drinkable as Prima with a hop flavor that is not as subtle and the flavor could compliment the spice more, but I think the ginger is too heavy for such a low abv saison."

"O- Spices and floral notes are the main focus, kind of light, definitely a session ale. Great for a warm day, kind of reminds me of Summer Love."

"This is a nice saison. And a session ale to boot. Great nose, good character. Somewhat grassy with a yeasty thing going on and nice levels of spice; I was told they used Szechuan peppercorns in this one. A bit too inky on the tail end, I'd have to say, but overall a good beer; especially being a saison."
""
"A preferred spring drink; a saison with drinkability and just enough character to warrant another sip, and then, another glass."

"Overall, this is a solid offering from Victory but not exciting at all. A pretty tame beer although it does make for a great thirst quencher."
"Overall: Nice to see a new ""Session"" beer that isn't an IPA, although it is bitter enough. This is a very nice, crisply refreshing Spring seasonal. However, I still prefer Victory's Helios."
""
"Overall: Awesome drinkable, low ABV, high flavor. Looking forward to drinking this in the yard once it warms up a little more."
"O: This beer has nice lemony flavors and while it lacks some of the complexities compared to other beers in the style, it is very easy to drink and definitely can be considered sessionable."
""
"Slightly hazed sunny gold topped with a small, pure-white head. Fresh herbal, lemon, and spice aromas...basil, hay, dank, spices, flowers, and a melon sweetness. Peppery, yeasty flavor with continued citrus rind and more grassy/earthiness from the hops. Fresh, cracker-like malts, coriander, and green herbs. Crispy clean, dry mouthfeel. Flavorful and very refreshing."

"Extremely sessionable and easy drinking. Very balanced and clean. This is okay by me."
""
"Overall the beer is a better option for warm summer days then what is currently offered in the same ABV range."
"O - In the grand scheme of saisons, I'd say it's above average. They really hit the nail on the head, though, by brewing a light, sessionable, saison that packs a lot of flavor. I'll be getting more of this."

"O - Enjoyed this quite a bit. Victory managed to pack a lot of flavor into a sessionable brew. Well done."
