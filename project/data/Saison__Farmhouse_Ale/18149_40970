I taste Belgian cultured yeast before any farmhouse funk, and there is that malty sweetness of a classic tripel, cornsyrupy in a good way and lots of carbonation and body. this is sort of a genre bender, dry and sweet both, unusual in that way. maybe a little overpriced, but its complexity is appreciated here. really round and smooth in the feel, I wish it would quit straddling the fence between a farmy saison and a sugary tripel, it cant quite decide, and that hurts it a little. this is a beer without a true identity, but one with plenty of unique flavors and a mind of its own. on tap at cheeky monk on Colfax for more than its worth, but it tastes good and itll drink forever. lost abbey is back.","StonedTrippin","Mar 24, 2013"

Head retention and lacing are both very good, but neither are quite on par with the very best of the style The nose has lots of earthy brett funk, but with a light peppery aroma present as well. The flavor profile follows a similar layout, with the brett profile having a prominent, wet hay, barnyard essence to it. The pepper-like phenols are muted and in the background, but definitely present. The label advertises American hops, but outside of a gentle bitterness I don't find evidence of any. The body is nice and dry, and the carbonation has plenty of life to it, spot on mouthfeel for a saison. I really enjoyed this relatively fresh bottle o Carnevale, and I'd be curious to see what it's like with a little bit more age on it.","axeman9182","Aug 16, 2012"

The flavor follows suit with a nice foundation or toasted malts from which the peppery citrus flavors build. Earthen hops with mild bitterness. Crisp and clean.

On the lighter side of medium bodied with a light oily feel that surpresses the carbonaton a bit. Wheat, biscuit malt, and banana flavors up front that taper as hoppy lemon bitterness is introduced. Hops and underlying banana flavor carry through and lead to a tangy, not quite spicy feel toward the finish. Finishes with a clean feel accompanied by a lingering hop bittterness.

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, banana, and fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, banana, fruit, and wheat. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I did not pick up on any of the spices usually associated with this style unfortunately, but it allowed the rest of the flavors to step forward and take the show.

The routine provided stability yet- "Why hello..." her eyes strayed as a festive Guatemalan man began skimming her pool.

"Such grace, finding majesty in the menial" her eyes glazed over as she startled herself upon cutting to the end of an overly ripe zucchini.

It's just a little light, it took me a bit to sniff this one out. The taste follows the mouth but with a very distict french bread and dried pear taste. Super easy going down with a perfect dry finish. I LOVE saisons, this one hit the mark on almost all notes (except the price, pretty high for not being imported).

3.81,-3.8,4,3,4.5,2.5,4,"A gentle pop of the cork from a 750 into the Watou chalice it went. A bright hay color with a slight and quickly dissipating head that was not too surprising given the lack pressure behind the cork. Ah, how often do I get a Lost Abbey that lacks in the carbonation department, a quality control problem I suffer because when it turns out right, they are great. Back to the review. The nose is of a sweet malt character with an orange citrus. I suspect the lack of CO2 allows the malt character to dominate the nose and muddles the lemon citrus character others describe into a sweeter citrus, the orange I'm detecting. In the background is the funk...ah the funk. Open the mouth and down the gullet taking time to dance on the tongue. A tang hits under the tongue, almost a carbonic bite, but not. Dominating is brett's funk intermixed with hoppy citrus notes, and a slightly harsh hop bitterness that lingers obnoxiously. Its good, but I have to say it lacks complexity. Even for its faults it is an easy drinker, no problem finishing the 750 and feeling better for it.","bensiff","Beers"

4.13,4.3,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Caged and cork much like all of the Lost Abbey ales, this is a saison with American hops. Pours a clouded orange golden hue with a bright white head forming thick fine bubbled. No pop when I decorked it but no carbonation issues to speak of. Aromatics spicy peppery notes, herbal citrus qualities as well. A touch of phenolic plastic, hint of band aid. More so tropical fruits like mango and pineapple standout than the off tones. Especially in the flavor the tropical fruits are juicy pineapple and ripened mango with nice cereal malt sweetness. Hints of rounded herbaceous, citric hop character. Sometimes American hops and Belgian yeast strains clash, that's not the case here. Back ground has hints of spicy yeast tones with a black peper kick. Mouthfeel is medium bodied carbonation is effervescent, dry finish nice hoppy saison.

A corked 750ml bottle purchased at Abe's in Bethlehem for $9 - 2009 vintage on the label. Uncorked and poured into a pair of shaker glasses. The ale appears a hazed apricot color with a good two fingers of creamy light rust colored foam. Nose and flavors consist of musty, funky brett-like notes, albeit somewhat mild, (good in this case), lemon, apples, pear, spicy yeast, citrus-y. At least a notch better than medium bodied for the style with ample carbonation as well. Very nice! Thanks again Bob!","ClockworkOrange","Dec 15, 2009"

No drowning out of flavor with too much citrus or mustiness. The Belgian flavors are first and foremost on the palate. The funk of the beer is pronounced and enjoyable, a sweet and acidic brew. Less dry than Saison Dupont and without the skunk some SD's suffer from. The beer is almost a clone of Fantome's original Saison in terms of flavor and funk. I will be buying more of these very soon.

Light on the tongue with medium carbonation that seemed like it needed to be a little higher to give an optimum feel.

Full-bodied, moves like it's still slightly buzzed from the night before and thrown off by the light when the shades are pulled back at 11:00 AM. Hence, the flavors have the same gauziness as the liquid itself, the slabs of lemon and orange, the just out of the oven sourdough bread, the mixed baking spices and flowers need mastication to get working.

It is quite abrubt and hoppy for a Saison, but not in a bad way. The grassy hops mix well with the yeast and wheat. This really reminds me of a "hopenweizen" for lack of a better term.

Taste has similar components with a fairly pronounced bitterness at the end. Lots of citrus rind flavors here. These American hopped Belgian styles seem all the rage for certain breweries now, and while this shares some of those typical flavor components, it doesn't go overboard with the hops or spicing and achieves a nice balance. My only complaint is that it's a bit soft in the mouth. I need a litttle more bracing pepperiness or herbal zing in my Saison. Still, quite nice.","Georgiabeer","Mar 10, 2008"

Fluffy banana and spices but nothing over the top, very calm and clean. Sweet honey throughout. Hops show up towards the end with a slight citrus zest and a somewhat puckering mouthfeel.

4.45,12.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Overall, this was another knockout from Tomme and crew. I have said it before; there are two breweries that are just consistently outstanding for me, Lost Abbey and Pisgah. Lost Abbey though is a whole new level and this just reinforces it. If you can get this, you must it is insanely good and well deserving of any hype.","mikesgroove","Feb 23, 2008"

3.8,-4,4,4,4,3,3.5,"Overall: Another quality brew by Lost Abbey. A nice Saison for a 80 degree Florida winter day. It was pretty good tasting, and rather refreshing. Glad I had the chance to try it.","tpd975","Feb 19, 2008"

3.97,0.3,3.5,4,4,4,4,"I see this one as a cross between a saison and a Belgian Strong Pale Ale. It has characteristics of each to me. But having said so, thoroughly enjoyable.","Dukeofearl","0"

3.98,0.5,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Good refreshing taste with alcohol well hidden, a balanced flavor, and just a hint of bitterness on the finish. Highly drinkable.","watchnerd","Feb 15, 2008"
3.8,-4,4,4,4,3,3.5,"Overall, I enjoyed this beer, but it probably would've gone better with a hot summer day and some babes in bikinis rather than me sitting here freezing on a friday watching UFC.","kleffman","Feb 11, 2008"
3.63,-8.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"I think if you like the grapefruit overtones in your beer that you need to try this one.. it isnt my favorite flavor, but for what it is, a saison, its right on target with the description of what it should be.","tayner","Beers"
