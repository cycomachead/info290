review_text
"Every bottle of Fantome I have tried seems a little different. This one is more straightforward. It has rewarding qualities yet parts are still challenging, especially with the ashy finish. As it got a little warmer and as I got towards the bottom of the bottle, I enjoyed it more and more."

"Light funk.. Orangey/peachy color.. Ok mouthfeel..Light lemonade.. Hay, grass, and straw.. I was expecting a World Class beer.. However, All I tasted was an unremarkable saison.. I've tasted better.. Much better"

"Fantôme Saison pours a cloudy straw color with a nice thick white head. It is very dry. There is a little malt in the background but it has a very tart, almost cidery finish. There is also a little cidery note and Belgian yeast spice in the aroma. The tartness makes it very refreshing and combined with the body, malt, carbonation, and alcohol make it very well put together and enjoyable. Even though this comes in at 8% alcohol by volume, it is so well balanced that you do not notice it."

"Overall - A really interesting taste going on.. super complex and lip smacking good.  More of a fruity flavour than I was expecting and not as much spice as I would have figured.  A beer well worth seeking out to see its nuances."

"O: So good to have a Fantome like this once again. My last few bottles tasted like a tire fire. The only area that wasn't totally on point was a lack of carb, but in a way it almost contributed even further to the juiciness with a slick/low carb body and a lingering acidity. Keep it up Dany P!"

"Begins with soft yeast, which feels incredibly smooth on the palate, then spicy, syrupy sweetness with hints of overripe sourness turn visible. Slick sourness remains in the throat and on the palate, while hot spices add a decent complexity. Medium bodied, begins with a very smooth impression, then turns hotter with stinging spices and overripe sourness. Driven by lively carbonation, finishing slightly bitter, with peppery spices still being detectable."

"O-This beer is one of the more unique I have tasted. There is a lot going on, and no one flavor or characteristic comes through cleanly. Although some might say it is scatter-brained or unfocused, I enjoyed this quite a bit because each sip seemed to uncover something new and, interestingly, no matter what flavor crept up on my palate, it seemed to fit with the other flavors on my palate. Tasty."

"Pours a hazy radiant light amber with fizzy white head, puts up a few rings. Smell: nectarine, floral, white grape and slightly champagney, clove, grainy backing, herbal as it warms. Very bright, fruity and fairly sweet. Taste: fruity upfront... nectarine, into grape skin into light lactic tartness, clove, grassy, light breadiness, bitter orange. Fruity and herbal brettness. Light bodied, slick to creamy, crushable. Sugary, semi dry finish. Delicious, majestic, all of the good things."

"Wow, this really did deliver - it's as strange and inconsistent as you'd expect a Fantôme beer to be, but it still was very delicious. I will forever remember the aroma on this beer - it's very astonishing and transcends the style as a whole. I wish I could have bought more from this batch, but I was too afraid at the time of any inconsistencies. Regardless, I will definitely make a question to buy more from Dany the next chance I get if I feel confident enough to do so. Salut !"
"Pours a champagne color that was crystal clear the first pour and grew hazier with each additional pour. Off white head that is light and bubbly and thick (2 inch first pour, 1 inch on second). Head faded down to half a centimeter and held there. Great lacing too. Aroma is apricot, sweet grass, dry yeasty funk. Taste is sweet grass, dry earth and aged floral hops. Surprisingly full bodied for a saison, medium-high carbonation."

"O: One of the very best saisons out there, this one makes me want to drink everything Fantome. It is so complex and different, and each time you drink it there are more surprises. I would love to culture this yeast strain for my own brews at home."
""

""

"the classic fantom saison, a bit of an oddity, a downright strange brew, loosely fitting what we in the states consider to be a saison, bur probably far more true to the original style than many of these that are more ""conventional"". hazy sunny blonde to orange color with some yeast sediment and over an inch and a half of lasting whipped cream textured head. it smells sweet and fruity, almost bier de garde style, with yeast being the main flavor agent, a sweeter malt base, and notes of apricots, oranges, apples, and spices. the flavor is as herbal as it is spicy, the yeast here is just awesome, its what makes fantom famous. the beer is pretty dense, higher gravity, it feels hearty and filling even though its body isn't much past medium and its carbonation if effervescent and tickles the tongue. notes of caramel and fresh baked cobbler on the finish, again a display of a one of a kind yeast strain. white pepper and lemongrass sit on the tongue after the swallow. farmy beer, funky and strange, but incredibly appealing to me. i know people have had issues with fan time and consistency and quality, but i had absolutely no issues with this beer."
""
"not much to say here... i get a ton of charred band aid on the aroma and the taste is even worse. id say borders on undrinkable. just a huge smoky, charred, band aidy mess. not recommended and i hope i got a bad bottle..."
"As others with bad bottles have already reviewed, I will only say that bandaid and rubber band are off smells that one cannot miss when it exists in this beer. I was really hoping that I got a consistent bottle. Hopefully, I will have better luck next time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall Impression: Wow! Fantastic. Clean and crisp malt canvas splashed with spice, tartness, funk, sweetness, and blossoming herbs. The restrained tartness and extraordinary earthy complexity reminds me of a natural and wild Asturian Sidra from Spain. An extraordinary beer."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"I had my finger crossed when I opened this that my bottle would be good but it looks like I may have received a sub par example. Not nearly as bad as some but i'll have to try again."

"If you get a good bottle, then Fantome is indeed as amazing as many reviews indicate. Exceedingly good, with no weak points."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Gonna go ahead and assume this is a bad bottle. I can't imagine this is what the brewer intended this to taste like, but I can only review it based on what's in front of me. I'd like to get another chance to try this, but won't be going out of my way to find it."

"O: excellent saison with unique yeasty flavors"
"O- I don't have enough experience to rate a bottle as good or bad. This was very unique, had some great earthy notes, and some less then great hints. I did like it, but I'm not blown away. A rare treat for me nonetheless"
"Obviously I got a bad bottle. Have you ever put athletic shoes in the dryer? It starts like that. That flavor gently yields to rubber bands and then charred bandaids. Maybe a hint of sweaty gym socks. It's really hard to pin down the exact flavors, because I'm so anxious to get this monstrosity out of my mouth. Quite possibly the worst beverage I have ever had. Mind-numbingly disgusting. This is what I imagine prison wine must taste like. Check that. Prison wine can't possibly be this bad. I've had infected beers before but this is a new level of terrible. If I were faced with the choice between dieing of dehydration and drinking this, I would choose death without a second thought."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very unique take on a classic style. The complexity of smoky/spicy and sweet/dry is really invigorating. It's refreshing and crisp - seems to get better as it warms."
""
""
""
"o: i admit i may have a bias towards this, because it has been a want of mine for a while. but - this is great. even if you don't like saisons i'm begging you to give this a try. it is so harmonized and complex, while remaining easy drinking. real good stuff. you can taste the effort put into making this."
""
""
""
""
"Like others before me, I was stricken with a bad bottle. Not sure why so many bad bottles are slipping through production. After the initial foaming head, and my excitement bubbling too, I poured and tasted... burnt rubber. I waited a few minutes to see if the taste would change and it did not. Shame as I read it was a great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Excellent. I've been quasi-searching for this beer for the better part of two years now and I am glad to have stumbled upon it. Complex even for a saison, with a wide range of flavors, all of which interact nicely with each other. I do wish it was slightly more carbonated and wouldn't explode everywhere. Up there with Saison Dupont and Saison-Brett as one of my favorite saisons."
""
""
""
""
"I've sample Fantome's Saison in the past and while it was damn good this beer just goes above and beyond. This is my new favorite farmhouse ale. Fantome Saison has an incredible depth of flavor with a 100% refreshment factor. Delicious"
""
""
""
""
"O- So this was very good. Not a mind-blowing saison but certainly unique in that Fantome smoke sort of way, only this was just a touch of smoke unlike the Hiver and Brise-BonBons which were both veritable smoke bombs. I've decided that, if I ever see Fantome on-tap anywhere (I know, probably won't ever happen), I'll buy again but the bottles are just way too hit-or-miss."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one of my favorite brews right now. Not a beginners Saison - way too funky - but once you get your palate wrapped around the crazy profile, this quaffs easily and disappears fast."
""
""
""
"Happily Drunk in Cleveland"
""
"The easiest drinking I’ve ever come across. Fantastic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A good session beer, but also great enough to have one to savor. A top saison."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o - Buyer be warned that you have a good chance of getting a bad bottle. This is the worst beverage I have ever had. I understand this was a fluke but I have read enough reviews that have said the same."
""
"It had a lot of promise when poured - it was a beautiful golden color. However, it was an infected bottle - smelled and tasted like liquid band aids. I will gladly revise this review when/if I ever drink a new bottle. I won't be in a hurry, however, as it made me sick the next day."
""
""
""
"There are millions of words I want to say about this beer, but sadly it has been years since the day I purchased and experienced this beer so my memory is not fresh enough to express the love and enjoyment I had when I drank it. The one thing I will never forget, aside from the knowledge that still to this day it is my favorite beer I have tried, is that is smelled and in a weird way, tasted like the best dank in the world. Maybe my particular bottle was unlike any other, but I had multiple people to confirm that it was in fact true. This is of course stretching the imagination because when experiencing any substance, to say it is the ""best in the world"" you are just imagining what that would be like. Whether that is your cup of tea or not, this beer will definitely be worth it's price and may never be dethroned as my favorite beer."
"Underimpressed with this beer, especially since it's ranked in the top 250. Maybe something was wrong with this batch? Either way not worth the money."

"It's still a refreshing beer, but extremely different and strange for a saison. The complexity is a huge plus, whereas the sweetness can be good or bad based on how sweet you want your saisons."
""
""
""
"I enjoyed this beer and can understand its reputation as I found it to be very unique. Enjoyable, but I would have to be in the mood for it before I have it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very tasty beer that's easy drinking and different from other saisons with the smoky characteristic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Outstanding. Perfect for a warm day like today. So much fruitier than what I had thought it would be. Easily the best saison I've ever had."
""
"Poured out as a hazy orange golden color, the head is white and loaded with big bubbles. The retention is very strong, there isn't much lacing at all. The smell is slightly funky with some honey and grain sweetness in the mix, possible corn aroma on the nose and not much spice. The taste is a little on the smokey side at first, the more you drink the more sweet grain comes out with some subtle hints of spice. There is also some hints of fruit in there also. The mouthfeel of the beer is well carbonated and has a heavier body than expected. The beer is also kind of sticky. Overall it's a very unique, totally different than most Saison's out there."
""
""
""
"They say that a good bottle of Fantome is quite the experience. If that's the case, this is just a decent bottle. That being said, its definitely one that I would revisit. Certainly better than any of the other offerings I've had from Fantome."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: obviously a world-class beer. Stunning."
""
""
""
""
""
"D - This was a good bottle, and it's in the top five or so regular Fantômes I've had. If I could reliably count on bottles tasting like this one I'd buy this beer more often. A very good example of a Belgian farmhouse ale, with that inexplicable Dany twist to it. We had no problem finishing this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Still not as bad as some beers that I have had. I was still able to finish the bottle. I guess I ate too many bandaids as a kid. If you want to relive your childhood then this is for you."
"O: Beyond expectations as usual. It's all over the place while still being enjoyable to drink. Some of these bottles are ticking time bombs, this one was excellent. I should've bought more when I saw them."
""
"O: Very nice saison. I quite enjoyed this one. I’d love to drink this again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Hoping to pay this another visit later on."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Old rate: Poured from bottle into a tulip. Hazy orange color with a fluffy white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is bandaids and more bandaids. Am I at the doctor’s office? Flavor is more bandaid funk with some hints of fruit and spice. God this is effing awful. Light mouthfeel with adequate carbonation. I hope this is a bad bottle, otherwise I have lost all faith in ratings..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium body, higher carbonation level, bubbly and dry on the tongue. I've always loved Fantome, and consistently recommend it to people looking for new saisons or Belgian ales to experiment with. This one was a winner, but I still wish bottle variation wasn't such an issue with them."
"O: This bottle of Fantome Saison was undrinkable."
"O - I know that a lot of people have gotten bad bottles of this, but the bottle I had was near perfect. This is my favorite saison to date. I was surprised by the 8% abv as well, as this drinks like a smaller beer than it is. Delicious and refreshing - highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D- I've been looking for this saison for quite some time. It's juicy and fruity and refreshing and quite thirst quenching despite sitting by the 8% fire. Gotta thank my boy Bret for picking this one up for me it definitely did not disappoint."
"the beer pours a cloudy golden yellow with no head. the nose is wheaty, honey, sweet, slight white grape, metallic, and funky. the taste is definitely a delicious saison with a touch of honey and pear, no bitterness. the mouthfeel is light, drinkable, elegant, well carbonated, and has a lingering graininess. this is damn worth trying and gives any saison a run for its money."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A nice beer, but that band-aid flavor kind of spoils it a bit for me. I don't have a lot of experience with this style and am currently exploring it more. I may or may not return to this one as I have already found others I like more."
"O: Whoa. Super funky saison, which is pretty much what I was expecting. Tough one to rate. I was not a fan of the tart fruits up front, but I did enjoy the finish. Overall an interesting experiment but I doubt I've ever buy this again."
""
""
""
""
"NOTE: Orginally reviewed this on 12/4/11 - had again at Monk's in Philly and don't know how new or old bottle is, but most of tasting notes I read here match this ""new review"" 16 months later with one difference and I hope somone might know about this special trait both my wife and I picked up. Very tart, some sweet and tart fruits, yeast and funk aplenty, but here was the one kicker that is different and it made the balance more amazing and I enjoyed the beer even slightly better than before. I bring this up as I don't know if we had a bad bottle, an aged bottle, a brand new bottle and they have tweaked the recipe since they make it ""from scratch"" on a yearly basis, so I've heard, but there was a musty, even smokiness to this beer. As in for a second I thought I had a German smoked beer. This taste is tucked in the background and seemed to bring out the tart and sourness, and spices, that much more. Just had to bring it up - still an incredble beer that anyone should try."
""
""
"If George Clinton was the funk master, then Fantome is the funk master of the beer world. Seriously, every time I have a bottle of this it is different. Huge amounts of funk meets a sour twist with some weird mouthfeel and hints of Fantome madness. Whatever you are doing, Mr. Fantome, keep it up because this stuff is good."

"Fantome Saison is a wonderful display of creativity and individuality - a seemingly ""it's just crazy enough to work"" type combination of flavors and aromas. Traveling from sweet and mildly tart to funky and bone dry, for a super unique and refreshing saison. Everyone teased me for getting such a hard-on over this beer, but I don't care. I fucking loved it. And I don't care if nobody else does - bigger pours for me next time!"

""

"O: Depite Saisons not being my favorite style of beer, this is one of the better beers I've had."
""
""
""
""
"O - It seems possible that this is a weird batch, but I'm not getting very much of the smoke I've heard about. Overall, it's pretty good, seems like a good candidate for aging, though as it should probably back off the alcohol flavors a bit. This is good though, and I'll have to make an effort to try the various seasonal offerings as well."

""
"Overall - This is a great beer. Wish this were more available to me. Complexity and flavor are all there. Not as funky as other saisons and pretty sweet, but it all seems to work together."
"O: It isn't fair comparing beers like this and Dupont's Saison to the American attempts at the style but all is fair in love and beer. The only two Saisons that can come close to this are anything from Dupont and Hill Farmstead. Everything else seems to be a Belgian IPA or while a ""good"" American Saison, it doesn't even come close. And I've had a lot of American-style Saisons. This is phenomenal, top-class stuff. I would drink this every day if I could. I will most certainly drink this on a summer day in Belgium one day soon."
""
""
""
""
""
"This one was a bit of a surprise about what to expect. It is certainly a treat. Had this about a month before the bottle's best before, and was quite impressed with the dry complexity of flavours it packed together quite well. A bit more sour and wild than I anticipated, but I really enjoyed it."
""
""
""
"O - Very very different from the last 'Saison' I had from Frantome. Unfortunately this is not as good. Not sure where all the smokiness came from. Missing all the light yeasty fruity flavors. Lots more earthy. Did like the pepper quite a bit. Mouth certainty has top notch quality. 8 ABV is hidden very well. I still look forward to my next Fantome beer. Sure your never positive what your going to get - yet, all still are very very good."
""
""
""
"Would pair well with fresh pear or a good green apple. Perhaps a salad would suit it well as well, but watch it with the acidic dressing."
""
""
""
""
""
"Light to medium body with a decent amount of fine carbonation. Really interesting beer that changes as it warmed in the glass. Initially more ester forward, then really brett heavy as it warmed."
"O. Delicous! This is a really good beer. Saisons are among my favorite styles. This one has so much flavor going on its rediculous, almost like two beers in one."
""
""
"O: This has got to be one of the tastiest, most complex and satisfying beers I've had. My new favorite Saison, easy. Great balance of flavors with a great aroma and refreshing drinkability. Dany Prignon is an f-ing genious! I'm having this on my b-day and could not have had anything better. I recommend this to anyone curious about Fantome without worry or risk of getting a bad bottle. Great beer and one of my new favorites. A must have!"
"Very nice beer. Not the best saison I've had, but definitely up there. In the balanced group for the style, with no element really standing out, though it's definitely a shade towards the fruity side."
""
"750mL. Pours a cloudy, beautiful neon light orange with a fizzy, two-finger, eggshell white head. Decent to little lacework. Aroma is complex: caramel, dulce de leche ice cream, pineapples, green apples, grains of paradise, white grapes, freshly squeezed kumquats. Taste is almost all tart kumquats, passionfruit, some prevalent fruity tartness. Very refreshing and light-bodied. Buttery, coating mouthfeel. Very good."
""
"*** Revisited this one with the bottle in my fridge. MUCH better. Obviously there will be inconsistencies with a beer like this, but the bottle I had was significantly better, and I easily polished off the entire bomber myself. Aroma was fresher, lacked any smokiness. Taste was also much much better, fresher, grassier, no smoke or tobacco, vegetal notes, with a crisp clean aftertaste."
""
""
""
"O- I think this may be my favorite Saison. Looks amazing, can smell it all night. It tastes great and drinks like a champ. I wonder if the smokiness comes from the bricks? Would love to visit this brewery, and would love to find this on tap somewhere and drink all night."
"M: It's a light medium. The carbonation is very high."
""
""
"Overall: Very drinkable, high on flavor and a joy to drink. Will try more from this brewery for sure."
""

""
"A truly great saison, among the best I have ever tasted."

""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
"O- Amazing beer, easily one of my favorites without a doubt."
""
"Overall, I'm pleased by the creativity displayed here, but it's far from the best, or even the most original saison I've had. Due to the variations in quality from batch to batch (or, for that matter, bottle to bottle), it may be an unreviewable beer. That being said, there are better offerings from this brewery, and much better beers to have at this price point."

"Notes: I felt inspired, so I surveyed my options with the cheeses I had on-hand and paired it with Robiola Rocchetta. It was a fabulous marriage. If Charlie Sheen thinks he's winning at life right now, he ain't got shit on me."
"Most importantly, it's worth the purchase price, and pairs exceptionally well with a variety of food. In this case it was Thai. Cheers to Fantome for their flagship brew. It's one I wish was more common."
"Highly recommended, but if you're reading this, you already know that."
""
"Verdict: Easily the best saison I've encountered. Went perfectly with the nice sunny warm day, delicious beer."
""
"Light straw gold color, pale yellow...very small bubbles didn't last long. Light aroma of banana, hay. Flavor of lemon, pear, wheat, funk, caramel, green apple. Overall very drinkable and tasty with no rough notes...not very sour or funky and very minimal alcohol notes."

"This beer pours a light bodied, cloudy and bright sunrise gold in color with a two finger, very bright white head. The nose is light, funky, and slightly fruity. It has some orange peel and lemon zest to it with light spicing. Wowzers the flavors are out of this world! Their are loads of every citrus fruit. There is plenty of orange peel, tangerine, lemon zest, lime zest, and funky, earthy yeast and a light tartness. They are soft and light while still being very flavorful. The most magnificent aspect may be the body of this beer. I've never seen a saison be so smooth before. It's as soft and velvety as any beer of this style could be. That makes this beer incredibly drinkable! Not to mention there isn't a hint of alcohol anywhere near this beer. Before having this I really didn't understand how this beer has been such a staple of the Top 100. Now I know."
"It's been a while since I've had this. It's always different every time, this time it was on the tart side. The liquid is a nice bright golden color with some trace shades of orange. Looks nice next to the candles. A good amount of off white bubbles with minimal sticking capabilities. The nose on this is straight fruit with some funky tones in there as well. Orange with lemon spritz, light spice and the faintest of baked bread. Not as crazy as some of Dany's other offerings. Being billed as 'super sour' by the bartender, this bottle had a nice tart punch, but not on the verge of sour. Has that berliner twang to it. Tastes include bright orange, some lemon twang, trace apple, light spice, thyme, baked bread and whatever else was thrown in here. All together a great mix and a very fruity slightly sour saison. Feel is spritzy with a nice twang towards the finish. Body is a nice medium. I could do a bottle of this in no time, a truely unique offering, that is different every time."

"Pours a slightly hazy yellow with a 1/2 inch foamy off-white head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of sour and tart fruity aromas like apples, lemons, strawberries, honey, and some mineral/yeast aromas. Taste is sour and tart with a strong strawberry flavor up front with some spice, yeast, and mineral flavors on the finish. There is a slight acidic quality in the mouth with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good saison with a surprisingly refreshing set of flavors."
"Lively crisp carbonation is spot on. Goes down terribly easy. Almost sessionable, aside from the well hidden abv and availability. Probably the bench mark, but a little too middle of the road for me. Would be curious to try an older bottle."
"O: Overall, another wonderful beer from Fantome.  This is my fourth Fantome offering (Hiver, De Noel, Printemps), and they were all great.  If I had to pick a favorite I would probably go with Printemps, as it had more complexity than this one.  But the regular Fantome Saison did not disappoint.  And  as I've said before, the 'worst' fantome offering is still better than any other Saison I have had.  Cheers to Dany Prignon."
""

"O: I apparently got a good batch this time. The regular Fantome is actually more consistent than the others. Quite pleasant session beer."
"If I couldn't take a gueuze with me, this would be my Desert Island Beer."

"O - Nice delicate flavors with no alcohol presence whatsoever. Excellent beer that I could drink everyday, except for the price and availability... But I'll be sure to buy this when I see it."
""
""
"O- this is excellent. The alcohol is extremely well-hidden. Another slam dunk from Fantome, but what do you expect?"
"750ml tapped & corked bottle.Oversized glass.Enjoyed on jul´11.Lemon yellow in color.Cloudy with yeast in suspension.White froth.Surprising lasting crown.Foamy spots on sides.Aromas are piney,yeasty,slightly malty with woody hints.Smooth tartar upfront,acid apples & grapefruit hues too.Moderate fresh spicy notes,light buttery.Bitterness & hoppiness not felt hidden by gentle sweet/sourness associated with orangish touch. Medium/light body & high carbonation -pops like champagne when cork is removed-.Citric -lemon & lima- finish.Banana feel on the aftertaste.Very well balanced both flavors & aromas.Perfect pairing: marinade anchovy, green cheeses -Cabrales or Roquefort- or black paella."
""

"O: Excellent. Recommended. That said, for the price ($17) it will be a long, long time before I have another. One of the best saisons I've come across."
"Overall, just outstanding. A killer beer. A real treat to drink. I will be looking for more whenever I can. A total winner!"
"O - There is little doubt in my mind that this one is one of the best saisons in the world. It is extremely well balanced and it just plain tastes great. I need to find a few of these for myself one of these days."

"pretty impressive stuff here, I spent quite a while smelling this stuff and loved every sip I took. This is one of the better beers I've ever had and look forward too drinking it again, until then I need to thank chickenm for sending me this one"
"Light bodied and a lot of carbonation on the tongue. Very good here. Overall, a good saison. Not as good as I was expecting, but I know there is a fair amount of variation in Fantome bottles, so we'll see how the next bottle turns out."
""
"O: Definitely the best saison I've ever had and I want more!"
"O: I really enjoyed this beer but for its feel and subtle flavors, but I wish it had a bit more power in the flavor and aroma."
"O - I can't imagine a better tasting, more refreshing Saison. Balanced, refreshing, perfect. I've had a lot of different Saisons since the last original Fantome has been opened, and now it makes them seem terrible. I would drink this every day. No wonder some people in Belgium are so dedicated to Dany's beers."
"M-very light bodied and well carbed. doesn't taste like the abv."

"Overall. Nice saison. Tons of great flavour."

""
"This is a great saison. One that everyone should drink as often as possible."
"Tan to yellow and a bit hazy, head was white and about a finger but didn't last long, lacing was spotty. Smell is funky tartness and fruits, light fruits like apples, pears, and apricots. Taste follows the fruity and funky smell, especially the fruits. Tasty stuff! A bit low on carbonation for a saison, body is medium. Overall it's quite a tasty brew, a real nice saison."
""

"Great beer, definitely my favorite saison."
"O: Wow, exceeded my expectations. Extremely drinkable with amazing fruit flavors. Love the slight sour/tartness it has, will definitely grab this if I see it."

"A beautiful blend of grain and tropical fruit sweetness, tart citrus zest, and funk. Almost a saison-lambic or wild ale hybird. World class stuff and a must try for anyone that is into Belgian beers or wild ales."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I have had this beer a couple times and whether it is summer or the dead of winter, this saison is appealing and not just that, deliciously wonderful."
""
"Fine carbonation tends toward the upper end of the scale, and the body is a bit lighter than medium -- actually on the higher side for the style. But hey, that's what residual sugars from an 8% beer will do, and I'm not complaining. Fantome just easily leapt into my top 10 beers ever, probably top 5. This is one of a few that I would buy by the case (if I could). Truly a spectacular example of what beer can be. Fantome is an immensely unique beer; top tier by any measure."

"O- One of the best saisons I've ever had, the flavors are complex and keep evolving as you move through the bottle."
""
""
"Overall – A very solid saison. One of the better one’s out there for sure. Going to pick up a couple more tomorrow. Curious to see how this ages (this was a fresh one)."
""
""
"D: i certainly see why this is considered one of the best examples of a saison. there is a great amount of complexity between the fruit and a very tasty barny flavor that makes each sip enjoyable. the dry finish makes each sip rather thirst quenching as well as easy to pick up again."
"O: I typically do not seek out Saisons, but I found this funky number to be complex and enjoyable."
""
"Medium-bodied with carbonation that is a bit overaggressive at first. Waiting a bit allows the carbonation to settle out and is much more enjoyable on the palate. Overall mouthfeel is fairly crisp, slightly smooth with the dissipation of the carbonation."
"Pouring from a cork and capped 750ml bottle comes a straw golden super clear beer. the aromatics of corn, thyme and rosemary seep from the glass backed by some higher alcohol esters. The flavor is good, but to me is more of a belgian triple than a saison, very little of the barnyard horsey wild character that I like to see in a saison. Mouthfeel is good, it is medium body but finishes super dry. Overall this is a really great beer and I would recommend it, but it is not a great example of the saison style to me."
""

"Many thanks to Beenitty for this awesome surprise. Something I have heard of for some time now and never been able to enjoy. Corked and capped bottle, poured from bottle into my Jester King Farmhouse glass. Pours a cloudy light yellow color, some head that dissipates quickly. Smell- vinegar and citrus lime. The funk hits me in the nose and gets me excited here. Not sure if the sour is intentional? Taste- tight carbonation, some tartness, wet grass, cracked pepper, lemon citrus. The vinegar is barely there, but its there. This is a pleasant, light, airy Saison, and very different from all others of the style I have ever had. A very enjoyable experience."
""
"This was not what I was expecting. I enjoyed it overall, and perhaps if my expectations were different, then I would have been more pleased. I cannot say that I would buy another bottle, but one of my friends told me each bottle taste different. At $14, I am not willing to take the risk."
""
"I enjoyed trying this, and I can see it has its own greatness, but I won’t buy it again. The one other Fantome brew I had was Noel, and I enjoyed that more."
"O: one of, if not, my favorite saison. Great balance and depth, while extremely light and whimsical all at once."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall a very good beer. I'm not into saisons but I really like this one. Very deserving of being the best saison out there."

"Overall, this was one of the premier saisons I have ever had. Top three no doubt. Job well done."
""
""
""
"overall, a good first impression from this brewery... I have been passing over their beers for far too long."
"Overall: An absolute stunner of a beer. I was hoping this would have a slightly tarter characteristic to the taste, thus the .5 downgrade. I'm, as of yet, undecided as to whether or not I prefer this to Saison Dupont but those two are definitely the finest saison's I have ever had the pleasure to drink. I will be on the lookout for this eternally."

"750 ml capped and corked bottle, best before the end of January 2013. Served in a Unibroue tulip, the beer pours a hazy golden/orange color with about an inch white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. The aroma is pretty nice, it smells like citrus fruits, hay, earthy funk, apples, and some apricots. It tastes like apples (both sweet and tart ones), citrus, pears, white grapes, peppery spice, and a bit of funk and hay. Mouthfeel/body is medium, with moderate carbonation. It's smooth and easy to drink. I made the mistake of passing up this beer in the past, so I knew when I finally came across it again the other day that I had to buy it. I certainly wasn't disappointed, this is a pretty good brew! $13.99 a bottle."
""

"Beer pours a murky yellow color with a hint of brownand white head. Honestly, not a lot to see hear. The smell is potent even just from the bottle. Funky, fruity, spicy. Hints of citrus and yeast. Complex and inviting, yet completely light. Flavor follows the nose. The flavor is fruit forward, slightly acidic, and tart, with funky and earthy undertones. Delicious and screams ""rustic."" Despite all the fruitiness, it's still has a nice dry finish. Light bodied, which works with the flavor and the nose. A tremendous beer and classic saison."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The beer is relatively easy to drink and has some refreshing properties but would be more palatable if the nose wasn’t as offensive."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouth feel also could be tuned a little tighter to make a creamier drink. If you like saisons, this will not disappoint."
""
""
""
"For many months, I saw a number of bottles of this on the top shelf of one of my local bottle shops. One day, I just decided to buy one. Then I learned it was excellent. Now, all the Fantome bottles are gone. Typical."
""
"Overall, I found this to be a very complex and interesting beer. Not a beer I'd reach for frequently due to the tartness, but I'd like to try other offerings from Fantôme and compare them to this saison."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is seriously farmhouse ale perfection. Silky and creamy on the palate, a good balance of sweetness, tartness, funk, and spice. The alcohol is completely absent from the flavor and feel. Incredibly crafted. I want more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability – This is an outstanding saison. Extremely unique and dangerously drinkable. The 8% is hidden completely by the fruitiness. It is easily the best saison I have ever had. I expected a bit more of a funky edge based on what I had read, but I have three more bottles from this batch and will make sure they spend a bit more time in the bottle. Absolutely wonderful."

"Overall: This is an absolutely incredible beer. At this point I have nearly given up on Saisons as I never seem to enjoy the ones I do try, but I may just switch exclusively to Fantome. This quaffs way too easy for 8%. I am curious about aging this beer. Will some additional time let the yeast make the character of this beer even stronger?"

"Overall: Real good saison and very high drinkability"
"Overall, this was my favorite of the twenty one varieties of Fantôme sampled last night. Highly recommended."
"O - Phenomenal Saison, exactly what I look for in the style!"
"I've had three bottles of this beer. The good one was the best beer I've ever tasted. The other two were badly spoiled and were among the worst I've ever had. I rated the good one here. I'm glad I tried the Fantome, but for my money, I'll take Saison Dupont because it is less expensive and definitely more consistent."
"O: This is an excellent saison and is fully deserving of its reputation as a world classic. This should be on everyone's must try list."
"o: I want to buy a case of this beer. amazingly balanced for such a complex beer. not a typical saison, but fantome is not a typical brewery."
"Surprise, surprise this is an amazing beer. One of the best of my lifetime."
"O - This is a very enjoyable, complex saison. Although it is sweet up front, it dries quickly and has very little aftertaste. I bought this on the recommendation of Chris from Miorge Mihoublon, who told me that Fantome's products can be very inconsistent, but that this batch was very good. Thanks, Chris--you were right!"
"D. This is great. Not as funky as I expected, but very good."
"Pours a hazy yellow. Some nice white head.. Smells sweet and fruity. Lots of intresting aromas. Very nice. Tastes sweet and fruity. Lots of light berries almost and citrus. Very enjoyable. Good solid mouthfeel. Overall very enjoyable. Roger definitely chose well with this one"
"O-decent beer. Would have again."
"100th review! (and #666 for the Fantôme, apparently. Ooooh, spooky!)"
"Light to medium body with medium carbonation. Lightly sour, nice funk, very refreshing overall. One of the best saisons around in my book."
"Overall one of the best saisons I have ever had. Highly recommend this one."
"Overall this is a great example of the style. I'm generally a fan of more ""clean"" saisons made stateside, but this one may have moved to the top of the list for me. A great blending of flavors and the best utilization of the sometimes abstract ""funk"" flavor that i've had in a beer."
"Wasn't expecting the sourness, but I do enjoy it. Would have liked to seen some more spices. I don't like the finish; it makes me think the bottle is slightly skunked. Don't know if this is how it's supposed to be, or if it's because of the green glass. Not bad, but not as great as I'd heard."
"O - Dany is the frickin man. No doubt about it. This is just such an exceptional saison."
"O - Wow, what is this? This beer is unique for sure. I really enjoyed it. I have heard that each bottle can be unique. I will try another for sure."
"Overall awesome saison. Great malts, nice fruits and citrus, hint of funk and just enough booze, esters, and Belgian malts to give it a nice kick."
"So inconsistent but consistently wonderful saison."
"Fantastic beer all the way around. The aroma and flavor are impressive, though do not equal the drinkability. I could easily go through several pours in an evening. It is unfortunate we do not see Fantome in West Michigan, this would be a regular purchase."
"D/O- Hard to imagine a more widely available saison with a better flavor profile. A real treat, would like to try other Fantomes."
"I've had saisons that were crazier with more funk & spices but none that brought everything together so well. Maybe it's the thick, creamy body of Fantôme, or maybe it's something else. Regardless, I'm pretty sure this is the best saison I've ever had."
"Pricey though at $15 a pop, it'll prolly be one of those 'once a summer' type of beers, but at least I won't be let down."
"Simply put, this is one of the best beers in the world, and truly deserving of the recognition it receives, including my first perfect review. I can't wait to track some more down, Cheers!"
"Overall: If this isn't one of the best saisons out there, I don't know what is. I was sure I disliked the style before I tried this beer. It's a mind-altering experience. I'm just sad it disappears from shelves as quickly as it does."
"Overall: Good beer, enjoyable. More funk/tartness than I was expecting. Would drink again, but wouldn't go out of my way for it."
"This beer pours a straw color with a good bit of haze to it. The aroma is slightly funky and a little spicy with a noticeable malt presence. The flavor is less funky than the smell but still detectable the beer is light and very well balanced with good carbonation. Overal one of the better saisons I have had to date."
"T: Lemon, pear, apple, some fermented apple, champagne yeast and a nice dose of funk. A really great saison. Not sure it's my favorite, but it's a keeper."
"I have had this a few times, and my love for it keeps growing. One of those beers I could drink every day and never get tired of."
"O- Impressed. Very much so. Reminds me more of a wild ale than a farmhouse ale, but fantastic nonetheless. The fruity tartness is a nice compliment to the funk in the aroma, and the only complaint is the overall sweet nature can fatigue the palate towards the end of the bottle (don't judge me). Recommended."
"Overall: Wonderful beer, I loved everything about it. Amazing to have such a complex beer that is so easy drinking. If I could buy this beer in SA, it would most certainly become my summer staple."
"O - A delicious, refreshing beer perfect for the summer, or anytime of the year really..."
"-Cheers"
"O- Im impressed. Its unlike any other saison ive tried to date. I would recommend this beer to someone who says they dont like saisons."
"Incredible, complex beer.  I can't believe I waited as long as I did to try this, but this is because the Fantome labeled as ""biere artisanale sur lie"" was the classic Saison."
"Overall: Just an outstanding beer. Worth every penny of the $16. Cant wait to try the Printemps thats in the fridge."
"It's hard to believe this beer was made with barley and not grapes. It really blurs the line between beer and wine like nothing else I've tried."
"Narrative: Lakitu loved the cloud life. Day in day out, tossing refreshing spined monsters down upon the earth. “HEY THERE OLD LAKITU! STILL RUINING PEOPLE’S SHIT?” Lakitu gave a knowing nod and proceeded to throw a spiked beast from 300 feet shattering the small dry cleaning business below. Some would say “hey lakitu, why not just be a refreshing cloud, you know, water the crops and all?” Maybe for a standard refreshing cloud, but Lakitu was born with bite. His acidic temperament fueled his anger and made it rain, not unlike Yung Dro in an Atlanta strip club; notwithstanding instead of dollars it was hateful monsters showered upon the masses below. Life could be worse, you could be an asshole like that Bullet Bill."
"This is a medium to light bodied brew. It has a very slick almost creamy feel that coats the mouth with what I suspect is suspended yeast. It coats the mouth yet finishes tart. The carbonation is a very strange experience in this brew. While it looks to be low to modest at best, it is very prickly and lively on the tongue. Maybe just a bit over the top. The alcohol is masterfully hidden in this brew, I cant believe it is 8%. This is an absolutely outstanding brew, if the carbonation was turned down just a notch it could be better. As-is, this is a must try, outstanding."
"Overall: Just a joy to drink. Complex and very refreshing. I don't know that I can compare this one to anything else I've had. I'll definitely search this one out again in the future."
"O: Overall this is perhaps one of the finest saisons. Nice developed funk and very well hidden ABV."
"Overall, my favorite saison to date. Definitely deserving of its spot as a classic. A definite must try for everyone."
"Unique and wonderful."
"Light mouthfeel that is very drinkable. Excellent offering and glad this was my first Fantome. Looking forward to many more."
"Fantome Saison pours a mildly hazy lemon yellow. The foamy white head comes up to about 2.5 fingers in height before slowly falling off. Substandard lacing (very spotty) is the only thing keeping the beer from looking great. The nose is pretty good, a funky brett note that only intensifies as the beer warms, and some earthy, lightly spicy hop notes are the main attraction, with a faint bit of light fruit also present. That fruity sweetness is a bit more prominent in the flavor, and it's quite good. It almost reminds me of biting into some kind of tropical Starburst. The slightly musty brett note is probably next up in terms of relative potency, and manages to take over the lead position as the beer finishes warming. That soft, noble hop character from the aroma is definitely the support player here, but adds a nice touch to the beer. The brew is surprisingly dry/light bodied for how solid that fruity base is, the mark of a truly great Belgian beer. The carbonation is similarly excellent, bubbly and lively without giving the impression of being fizzy. I've seen Fantome brews on shelves a couple times now and passed them up. After having this outstanding beer though, I won't make that mistake again."
"750 ml bottle into tulip, best before July 2013. Excited I had to get the corkscrew once again! Pours hazy orange amber color with a 1.5 finger foamy white head with decent retention that reduces to a ring of lacing. Aromas of sweet apples, pears, strawberry, and spiciness. Very nice aromas, really fruity as well. Taste of tons of apple, pear, strawberry, lemon, and spices. Finishes with some slight tartness and tons of apple, strawberry, and spice. Some notes of fruits and spices on the finish that linger for a short period of time. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied. Very smooth drinking as well, with no alcohol noticed in the taste or finish. Overall, this is just an incredible saison, and is also very interesting with the fruitiness, but is extremely drinkable and delicious."
"Pours a hazy gold with a thin head that quickly clings to the glass, great lacing throughout. Aroma of champagne and hay, yeast and funk in the back. Taste follows the nose and more, fruity, tropical fruits with grapes, nice spicy notes, not as funky or sour as expected. Alcohol is not apparent. Smooth and refreshing, amazing saison!"
"Notes: Very nicely rounded and memorable, the ""apple"" edge is a bit assertive and surprising but in a rather stimulating way."
"O - Something that is approachable for many types of people; especially wine connoisseurs."
"Overall Impression- Now I know what people are talking about with this Saison! Perfect! Very great example of this style while having a great drinkability behind it! Will be trying more from this brewery soon."
"M. Holy carbonation Batman! Its a medium bodied beer but the carbonation really bites your tongue starting out."
"Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer is refreshing as well as easy drinking. The carbonation really helps to move the flavors through their stages while allowing them to last for appropriate amounts of time."
"Hazy straw beer with a white head that left behind some chicken scratch lacing. Smells of some hay and funky notes, not particularly sweet, but nice and dry. Taste is on par with the nose and very good. If is medium bodied with bubbles and a dry finish. I really like this beer a lot and will buy more bottles as I find them."
"very enjoyable saison. the best from fantome that i have had so far."
"O - this is an excellently crafted beer and a very good pick by me on a hot, humid night. I definitely recommend this to any fans of Belgian beers and would love to treat myself to another bottle soon. I'd like to get a bottle with some more carbonation next time, though."
"Dany Prignon is a genius!"
"The mouthfeel and carbonation were excellent. The best part of the beer by far. Overall, I didn't love it. It's kind of a mess. Not something I'd revisit, especially at the price point."
"O: Very light and refreshing yet packed with diverse fruity and funky flavors. Great and unique saison."
"Overall- Maybe I need to let this beer rest longer. This was once my favorite Saison and/or Farmhouse. Now it's coming in still in top 10."
"Poured from bomber into a tulip glass. Pours a hazy deep orange color with a big vanishing white head. Aroma consists of light sourness and balance between malt, yeast and hops. Notes of flowers, grass, citrus, with hints of pepper too. The flavor has the same balance and acidity of the aroma and a very pronounced fruitiness (citiric and tropical fruits), and grass, flowers, hops and some peppery spiciness. Medium body, decent carbonation, very dry long finish with medium bitterness. Nice complexity and decent drinkability. I kind of expected more out of this well embraced beer. A little bit disappointing."
"Mouthfeel is light with a decent amount of carbonation but does not finish as quite dry as I would have expected. Overall, this beer has instantly become one of my favorite Saisons and I know understand why it is ranked as the #1 saison on this site. I see myself drinking this one as much as possible this summer."
"O- Unparalleled complexity and taste in the Saison market."
"I would not try this again. Especially at the price. I expected much more given all the hoopla around this beer."
" Quite dry and slightly bitter with a long fruity finish; although I am sure that my bottle wasn't properly conditioned given the poor appearance. And even then, this is the best beer I have had in its style. I would buy much more of it if (a) It was cheaper than almost ~$15/bottle (b) Didn't come in green bottles and (c) Fantôme was known for putting out a consistent product."
"D/O: A great spring/summer beer that is quaffable for an 8%er. This one makes me want to try the seasonal varieties, and see where they can go. I’ve only seen the winter version in my area, but I might just try to seek out the other 3 as well"
"O: very interesting and very drinkable, it's really surprising to me that I liked this but I would happily drink another"
"Dry, very yeasty, with high carbonation. This bottle was enough to wake me up to the world of Fantome, and I am now curious to sample more."
"O: Complex and delicious. Tastes like a lambic/saison hybrid."
"I think the flavor was a little bit of a letdown after how amazing and funky the aroma was, but I still liked my first Fantome beer quite a bit. I know that this brewery is known for their spices, but I would prefer a little less of a spiced taste so that fantastic yeast profile could shine."
"Opens with a loud cork pop and an immediate blast of farmhouse yeast aroma. Pours a lovely straw-orange color, good clarity, 1-finger white head which recedes quickly. Yeasty aroma reveals some lemon, tropical fruit, spice and floral notes. Taste is floral, herbal, a balance of mild sweetness and sourness. Lively mouthfeel, lingers but without any heaviness."
"Medium bodied with high carbonation. Very easy to drink. Both sweet and dry. The alcohol is well hidden. This beer is very easy to drink."
"O: High drinkability. My first Saison Ale, great surprise. Strongly recommend"
"Exquisite. A feast for the senses yet at the same time crisp, refeshing and approachable."
"This is a delightful sour saison with clean lemony sour notes and is very drinkable."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Exceptionally drinkable and easy to drink. Perfectly enjoyed either as gulping or sipping. A good apple zing to it."
"O: Very enjoyable beer and goes down quickly; not overly funky as some saisons are (though I realize that's a desirable characteristic to some)."
"The 8% was hardly noticable and I would be able to have this brew through out the night."
"D - Yeah, theres a reason why this is one of, if not the best saison's out there. Its simply spectacular and deserves every bit of recognition. Simply put, see this bottle in store buy immediately."
"D- I found this one to be very easy to drink. I might even say this one is a slow drinker, but still very solid. I'm impressed with this one."
"Drinkability: An exceptional saison, perhaps the best I've had. This was a gift from a friend and what a gift it was! This is a very complex beer with many layers that express themselves differently as the beer progresses. Despite it's relatively high ABV, it drinks very easily, making it enjoyable and complex at the same time. Never pass this one up!"
"is almost perfectly carbonated. there is no bitterness to this, and its pretty much tart. Once you get past the first drink. Things tend to get better. it drinks better and better with each sip. i believe this drinks more like a tripel, rather then a saison though."
"This has a great deal of strawberry flavor. It is mighty nice."
"I liked this beer very much. A nice looking beer with a great big head. Smell is lightly funky, and a little unforgivably skunky. The flavor is spicy, and sharply bitter, with just a little funk. The beer has a mouth feel very similar to champagne. I've got a feeling from the aroma that I might have been drinking a mishandled bottle. Getting a better is on my long list of beer-y things to do."
"D: Delicious. Enough funkiness to set it apart from a lot of other Saisons, but dry and fruity enough to be refreshing."
"D- very refreshing and drinkable despite the large format"
"Drinkability is outstanding for a beer of such high alcohol content. Drinks a bit slower because of the tartness so the 8% ABV doesn't really catch up. Crisp, refreshing and very enjoyable."
"D- Great all around. Nicely balanced with the flavors and the modest funkiness. This is the best saison I have had."
"Thanks to glazeman for this one. This is a damn good beer. Appearance and smell are just okay, but the funkiness of the taste makes this beer the best in it's style. Nice mouthfeel with outstanding drinkability. I was shocked that this beer is 8%. Very nice."
"D: The balance in this beer and its modest carbonation for the style give it sky high drinkability. For an 8% beer this is crisp, clean and doesn't make you feel as if there's any etoh in it at all."
"D: I'm very sad that it took me this long to finally have this one. It deserves it's top spot among the worlds finest Saisons. Spectacular flavor and easy drinking. I will be picking up more bottles of this for sure."
"D - It can be a drinkable beer but its characteristics of acidity and astringence make this beer more difficult to enjoy!!"
"jd"
"Notes: This is one amongst the best Saisons I have ever tasted. Fresh, lively, and medium bodied. Drinkability is amazing! I'm glad I was in the mood to re-visit this fine piece of art tonight."
"Bottom line: I love Fantome. This is perfect."
"Huge thanks to Andrewinski1 for cracking this bad boy with me. Clear golden in color with about a finger of fluffy white head that settles down to a sticky ring of lace. Initially I smelled a big fruity nose; it was the likes of orange juice and pineapple with just a slight zing of lemon to round it out. After a few more whiffs a funky brett aroma because a bit more present. Kind of a spicy flavor with a hint of tart lemon to finish. A bit less funky than I had anticipated fromt the aroma, but still rock solid. The feel is good, light, crisp and good carbonation. Can't ask for much more. Easy drinking, tough to complain about anthing for it."
"O: In short: sour, citrusy, dry. Super drinkable. One of my favorite Saisons (and in general)."
"Drink- I really liked this beer. I probably could've had another couple. I feel this was a great way to start NYE. Although probably would've been better to ring in 2011 with this one."
"Drinkability: An excellent saison that definitely deserves its reputation. This is a brew I would be happy to drink frequently and, despite its 8% ABV, it drinks more like a summer refresher. Still, the ABV gives it a slight warming quality that could be good for mild winter days or for the autumn. Beautiful beer."
"Overall, one of the best beers I have had the pleasure of drinking. Cannot recommend this enough. If you don't like saisons or if you think you may not like Belgians, give this one a try. I guarantee it will change your mind."
"D: This review is about as close as I've ever come to narrating out a blow job. So yes, it's pretty drinkable."
"D - This beer is funky, fruity, flavorful and quite refreshing. Easy to drink, this one is always a favorite at my house."
"Its originality certainly makes it drinkable and there's little to make this beer stay in my glass (despite the often large price tag). Simply put, this is a delicious and groundbreaking Belgian farmhouse ale. It is the beer by which all other Saisons are measured."
"D: I would gladly drink this all night, any night."
"The mouthfeel was a little on the sticky side for my taste. One of the only detractions from this beautifully built saison. I will definitely revisit this as soon as possible."
"750 ml bottle, lot d, BB date July 2013. A pour into tulip creates effervescent, murky pale orange-brown body with yeasty floaties, topped by abundant white head that sets to a fine veil. The aroma is fruity and spicy: fully ripened melon, tropical fruits (mango in particular), spiciness that comes from either phenolics or adjuncts, floral hops and spicy alcohol. The flavor is fruity, peppery and yeasty, although not as deep as the aroma suggested. Medium bodied and prickly on the palate."
"D= A quality example of a Belgian saison for sure, but I feel this really pales in comparison to Saison Dupont. Still, I could drink several of these in a sitting, so high marks for drinkability!"
"This is a great saison. Pours an light orange, white haze. Love the appearance on this. Some life to it. Has a fresh fruit and citrus aroma, slight spice. Has a sweet fresh citrus taste with a slight carbonation level. Very refershing beer and nice abv. Love it. Dany is a master of his craft."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is a very nice Saison to drink for a whole evening if you're in the mood for the style."
"This was my first experience of the style and sours in general. I very much enjoyed this beer and will definitely search it out again. I'm looking forward to tasting other sours and broadening my horizons a bit. I've read that others have experienced a ""funky"" taste with this beer and that it varies from bottle to bottle. I guess I was fortunate to have a great bottle. If you experience a funky one, I encourage you to try another in hopes to taste one such as I did. cheers"
"D- Drinks extremely well considering the ABV. The alcohol is surprisingly well hidden considering how light everything else is. Unlike any beer I have ever encountered. Delicious."
"5.0 D: This is the first time I've had this. I heard there's a lot of variation between batches, but the bottle I have is a near perfect beer. I'm going to have to buy this often and hope I get more bottles like this one. Really amazing in every aspect. Exceptional smell, taste, and mouthfeel. The 8% isn't detectable in the least, allowing the drinker to focus on the many flavors present. Super complex with everything working together and no faults."
"Quite hazy in the bottle, with substantial sediment in the final pour. Lively carbonation, sharp and prickly in the tongue. A bit earthy, with faint fruit notes. A bit of a letdown, as the depth of flavor was a bit shallow, leaving a moderately tart finish unbalanced. A good beer, but I find myself less enamored than the majority of reviewers."
"D - This is a great tasting saison. The aroma is good but the flavor is fabulous."
"D: Wonderful beer. One of the best if not the best saisons I've had. Super easy to drink and refreshingly dry. Very complex. Just drink it already!"
"Golden pour with a tall, fizzy, white head that fades to a ring of lace. The aroma is soft layers peach. apple, bread, candi sugar, banana, clove, pepper, and lots of farmhouse funk. The flavor has lots of light citrus zest and granny smith apples upfront with a gentle and sweet bready Belgian ester laden middle. It finishes with lots of peppery phenols and more of that great barnyard funk. Creamy medium body with delicate champagne like carbonation."
"D: it drank really good and has the signature fantome farmhouse tart qualities. I can always admire and savor these crazy experimental beers."
"As I mentioned, I have had some bad experiences with Fantôme, but this is one they got right."
"Taste is sharp and tart with a good light malt but the mouthfeel is huge and carbonation that's super creamy and sharp. It makes it really tasty and easy drinking."
"Uncorked a 75ml bottle, labeled for export to America, bought in early summer at the excellent specialty store La Cave du Vénitien on rue de l'Eglise (sort of the main drag) in La Roche-en-Ardenne, Belgium. It opened with a gentle pop and a gust of strawberries, honey, peach, pear and grass aromas, even before I could pour into a tulip glass. A head of light bubbles formed and dissipated just as rapidly, settling into just a scrim over the cloudy brass deceptively viscous-looking (I was wrong--it's turned out very clean in the mouth) brew. The flavor is of some dessert made with lots of yellow fruits and lightly caramelized brown sugar, with a bit of coriander or some such herb poking through. There's a wonderfully quenching and drying sourness to balance all that sweet and help the drinkability."
"My first Fantome I've ever purchased! Pours a very murky golden-orange color with a couple little speckles floating around. Medium white head that diminishes rather quickly. Scent is somewhat funky and sour. Lots of lemons and zesty aromas along with wild flowers and sweet citrus. Such a complex aroma. Smells SOOO Good! Taste has just blown my mind! Initially I get citrusy tastiness (without hops) and some tasty lemon flavors. Then I get a light taste with a blend of delightful spices and delicious Belgian yeast. Finishes with a strong lemony tart flavor with a hint of alcohol. This beer has such a great mouthfeel for this style. Nice, full body with a crisp bite at the end. Drinkability is very high for these warm summer nights. I have to say I will for sure be seeking out more beers from this brewery."
"D: Fantastic brew from Brasserie Fantôme, and probably one of the better saisons I've ever had."
"I actually prefer Hiver as far as their distribution goes in the US for their more ""basic"" saisons. The flavor is a little bolder and cohesive with the same qualities as the regular saison. It's funny though that Hiver pretty much collects dust on the shelves around here."
"Strong flavors of apricot, orange rind. Mildly sour. Complex swallow of the above, a touch of sugar and light bitterness. Oddly, the aftertaste is very brief, as if this were a dry beer. The body is thin compared to the style. But it is also a very smooth beer because of a lower level of carbonation. I'm noting a warming sensation in my torso from the alcohol even though I didn't detect any in the tasting."
"This is an excellent saison with the floral and citrus character melding with the earthiness, leaving a dry vinous finish."
"I will buy and consume this whenever I can whatever the price."
"Mouth feel is more substantial than one would expect; rather heavy mouth feel. Alcohol is so hidden it scares me. This is a really refreshing drink. There is something about this beer that is really growing on me. A very intriguing drink to be sure and very well done. This is the best tart beer/saison I have had."
"Best buy date: may 2012. This bottle was purchased early summer 2009. Certainly worth seeking out. Well worth the $14 I dropped on it."
"Bottle was dated best by May 2012, batch b."
"D: Another very nice beer from Fantome. I like some of the others a bit better, but as the ""flagship", this one does a fine job."
"RESPECT"
"Mouthfeel is smooth and well-carbonated, but I think it could use a tad more carbonation. 8% is hidden very well in here, as in all of the Fantome beers I've had. One of the defining beers of the style for sure."
"Impression: Will be getting some more of these, as well as their seasons series, to cellar, and hopefully enjoy, with some time on them."
"poured a honey golden color with zero head ..smell was musty and funky with sour lemon juice and grass that was good..taste was the same it just had very little flavor no carbonation..i love saisons one of my favorite styles ..so many good/ reviews on this esteemed saison..i must of had a bad bottle ...but the side label said good until may of 2012 it was just so flat..will try again and do another update when i have $14 to burn"
"Always an adventure."
"Tasted from 750mL bottle at Lush Roscoe. Pours cloudy yellow orange with a thick white head that leaves massive lace. The nose is very pretty with passion fruit, light hay, and light malt. Flavors are some tart lemon with tropical fruits, light hops, with some hay and bread. The body is medium with average carbonation and a long tropical and bitter finish."
"Well done Brasserie Fantome, truly a masterpiece."
"Cheers!"
"D - A fantastic saison with superb drinkability, great flavor, and an awesome nose. What's not to like in this Belgian beauty? A saison I could have allll summer...scratch that, all year-round."
"DB- This beer is worth the money, for sure. Could be the best Belgian beer I have ever tried. The balance of fruit and yeast flavors is just perfect. Hard to describe but everyone has to try this one."
"Pours a light golden-yellow with a one inch white head that recedes in about a minute. Look is nice with tons of microbubbles racing towards the surface. Smell is strong and different. Champagne and apples come to mind. The taste is very interesting. Sour and champagne like at first with some citrus and sour apple flavors creeping in. There is a distinct gueze like quality here with a warm alcohol finish and a bready aftertaste. This is a complex brew with many layers of subtle flavor to wade through. The mouthfeel is silky and smooth with medium body. This beer combines a nice array of flavors for a balanced and very drinkable product. It's not sweet, but not super bitter either. It is sour, but not over the top. I will be having this again!"
"fruit, spices, and earthy notes went well together."
"D - Had trouble doing the whole bottle, although it is a big bottle. This is a good saison but like with most, just not blown away."
"Conclusion: I passed my MA defense today. This was one of the beers I finally cracked down and bought to celebrate. Definitely worth the wait, and really tasty example of the style."
"Bottle, very fresh according to our barman at the Lion's Pride, without a vintage on it though. Pour is homogen troubled yellow with some thick white head. Aroma is at first, very fruity and aromatic. I got hit by a wave of strawberry aromas along with fresh lemons and rose petals, followed closely by an underlying farmyard/funkiness. Some underlying grainy/bread dough/yeast notes complete the aroma. Taste is fruits, flowers and yeast, with a nice light sour lemony finish. It tastes pretty much like it smells, a feat such a bouquet left me thinking impossible. Palate is just beautiful as well, nice lively belgian saison carbonation that is not overdone. The yeasty components provided a rich taste, full palate and a fine balance which made this one so drinkable despite being very intense, aromatic and complex. The best beer I've ever had thus far."
"This was an extremely unique beer like nothing i have ever had before. highly recommended if you can find it!!"
"Overall, a very nice saison. Lots of good flavors to it. A nice amount of fruit flavors to it. Drinking this on a hot summer day was a treat. Pretty drinkable."
"D - For a beer that should be drank in the summer, this one does its job. Refreshing and I didn't even realize it was an 8% beer while drinking it."
"D - So easy to drink. My g/f and I demolished this bottle. The pinnacle for this style, by a long-shot. A must-have in my cellar."
"Summer is the time for this thing. Find a hot and humid eve to enjoy Fantome Saison, sitting outside as the sun goes down. That is what summer is all about."
"Drinkability is great. I love sipping on this beer during a warm, sunny afternoon. An awesome summer beer. The ABV is unnoticeable, the flavor is very tasty and I love the aroma. Just a quality beer and a classic example of the style. Right up there with Dupont in my book."
"O: Absolute pillar of the the style, and one of my favorite beers period!"
"One of the most distinctive saisons around, though I prefer the complexity and spice of Fantôme's darker offerings in some ways..."
"MF/D: due to the taste, can be drunk quickly without realizing it, leaving a healthy buzz. in addition, a very smooth taste, not overly carbonated. feels warm going down the throat, leaving a slight tingle on the tongue. the smoothest 8% ive ever had..."
"Wow. This is a good one!"
"yum"
"M/D: The finish is amazing, very crisp and clean considering the overload of flavor that hit the palate. It lingers only slightly then subsides, leaving you waiting for the next sip, and 8% ABV, I would not have guessed that..."
"Mouthfeel is great and this drinks way faster than an 8% ABV beer should. I will definitely be buying this again because even at the $14.49 price point, it is well worth it. This total package just can't be made in an industrial city because there has to be an authentic barn yard near by. Seek it out, buy it, and taste the REAL farmhouse!"
"The beer pours a hazy yellow color with a white head. The aroma is a little bit of funk with some citrus notes as well as green apple. The flavor is green apples.spices, lemons, wheat and some light tartness. Thin mouthfeel and medium to high carbonation. A excellent saison."
"D-this is very good, there is a slight metallic/medinical phenol aspect that takes away slightly. without that this would be close to perfection!"
"I try to avoid hyperbole. I try not to use words like best or even favorite when referring to individual beers. But drinking Fantome Saisons has removed any lingering doubt about my favorite beer style. For me, there is no more enjoyable, more exciting, more versatile beer style than Saison. And I don't think I have ever tried a better Saison than this."
"Notes: The level of inconsistency is really turning me off. A tasty beer, but some carbonation would be nice. Mouthfeel suffers for sure. When this guy is on, he's really on. When he's not, you can tell."
"drinkability: solid"
"Light-medium and refreshing mouthfeel, with a medium amount of carbination."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D: tasty and refreshing. flavorful. simply put, the perfect craft summer brew. a bit cost-prohibitive, unfortunately, but i will certainly revisit this one from time to time."
"Pours that cloudy, murky, golden haze that you would expect. Nice white head, fits in perfectly with the style. Smells of barnyard funk, wet hay, lemons, and some big tartness on the nose! Beautiful! I know that Im going to love this! Nice tartness on a refreshing effervescent sip that lingers with a spicy finish. No alcohol present, this could be dangerous as I could drink this all day, especially with the 96 degree weather we are currently having... Very nice brew, very glad I tried it!"
"This must be the nectar of the Gods. Highly drinkable and addictive; I cant wait till the next time I get to enjoy one of these. Goes very well with French onion soup. I really feel like I'm in Heaven right now."
"this was very interesting and hands down the oldest saison ive ever had. i would love to have more of this. the cherry flavor was amazing."
"How can you not adore this creation? Perfect treat by itself or (I imagine) with roasted turkey and stuffing, or an arugula salad with blue cheese, dried cranberries, and toasted slivered almonds. I'm sure it goes well with quite many many other dishes. I will stop whatever I am doing, no matter how urgent, to drink this again and again."
"Brett-infused saisons seem to be all the rage. I am guessing that this beer was one of the first of this sort. While I like the uniqueness of this saison, I feel that it could benefit from a more crisp and zippy flavor profile and mouthfeel."
"I would like to drink this beer at the brewery, so I could immediately comment to the brewer: ""You are a genius."" The beer is so adventurous with the spices and esters, but not ridiculous or cloying. It's one of those beers that makes me want to contact the person who made it and thank them."
"Good drinkability for 8%, but needs crisp aftertaste."
"Drinkability is excellent. What a wonderful beer, I now know why this is often considered the benchmark of the style. Top notch."
"A good beer and definitely one I will be trying again - TASTY."
"D- Overall a very pleasant beer with many desirable qualities. I'm curious if this would age well and the flavors might become a little more fluid."
"D- interesting and complex. if you love funky saisons, i recommend you check this one out. but if you love funky saisons, i bet you already have. this beer is too much of a thinker to go grab another one, but its something id like to be able to have often. a little on the pricey side at 14.99$/bottle here."
"(D)- A fantastic Saison. Perhaps the perfect example of the style? Has everything I love about the saison style and then some. It is very much a saison, but also leans towards hinting at a belgain sour somehow. Crisp and wonderful for the summer months right now. This bottle, though large, will not last long. Awesome stuff. If it wasnt so expensive, I would have this in my fridge all summer long"
"This beer is quite intense, so the ""real"" drinkability is medium-low, though I must admit I'm very impressed with this Saison. Borders on Belgian Sour territory. A."
" In all honesty, if I'm going to pay this much there a few other Saisons I'd rather have (Saison D' Erpe-Mere $15) or go for a cheaper one (SAison Dupont or Le Merle both about $7) This is, however, still a very nice Saison and I'm sure I will encounter and enjoy it again."
"I didn't want to spend $16 on this beer but I knew I had to try it. It's a bit pricey, but I was not disappointed. The style is of a traditional saison but it goes above and beyond where most saisons even try to reach. There is a lot going on here but I taste strawberry, peach, tangerine, and a creaminess that actually reminds me of cool whip (never thought I'd use that to describe a beer!) It's got some spiciness on the end and lingers on the palate as the flavors change. This is a beer that really transports you to another place. You can close your eyes and almost imagine being in the Ardennes, breathing in the air. I'm not surprised that his beer has a cult following."
"4/4.5/4.5/3.5/4.5"
"D--great drinkability--just an incredibly complex and balanced beer, have never had a bad one from Fantome, worth the price ($14) and the search"
"The beer was very smooth to drink, not chewy at all, and I would love to have another one right after the first. The relatively high alcohol might have something to say about that eventually."
"D - I dropped my wine glass - it shattered in to a million pieces, and I lost about 3 ounces of this delicious beer. So sad, as I could have enjoyed plenty more of this. The blend of tart fruit, dry finish, and slightly musty character are just perfect."
"D: This is a tasty rustic country beer from the Belgian forests. Aside from Printemps the best beer from Fantome I've had. This is their flagship, and I can see why. Give this beer to someone and they'll know what saison is all about. Hard to say this is worth the $13 price tag when Dupont is sitting there at $8, but it's good, the quality is undisputed."
"Overall I was not disappointed with a beer that I'd seen plenty of hype for. Bit expensive for daily drinking but I plan to have this often in the future."
"BTW -- notice that I have practically every Fantome saison in my wants list. ISO: Fantome; all day, every day."
"I was really surprised and impressed by this one. It was sweet enough and not overly sour or tart or funky. I really enjoyed drinking this one and at 8% ABV it was just perfect. It is hard to categorize what I really got from this beer but I definitely got fruitiness. I would recommend this to someone that likes beers that are a bit off the norm and easy enough to drink."
"Opened a 3+ year old bottle tonight which held up nicely, still a nice pop from the cork, healthy carbonation and a good mix of various fruit/funk/farm/mustiness. The fresh bottle (late '12/early '13) I opened afterwords however was off, as expected. Slow gusher, weird looking foaminess hinted towards infection. Had big smokiness and just an oddball veggie/pizza/spice feel to it. Drinkable, but barely. Unfortunate that most recent Fantome beers suffer from this, the unaware are probably getting the wrong impression about an otherwise great brewery."
"Poured a corked and capped 750ml into my Tripel Karmeliet tulip. This beer pours a slightly hazy straw with some yeast particulates floating around and a sizeable 3-inch head that leaves soapy lacing. As with most Fantôme beers, once I popped the cork, a slight sourness starts permeating the room. Under the tartness comes a slight bit of sulfuric twang, yeasty spiciness, fresh lemon zest and just a slight bit of grassy hops. The flavor is remarkable similar. Up front fresh grapefruit and lemon zest. Followed closely by spicy yeast. Just a hint of white pepper and coriander. Hay and grass underlie the sulfuric twang. A slight bit or earthy dampness. Also just a slight bit of tart green apple skins and Lemonheads candy. The mouthfeel probably is the most disappointing aspect about this beer for me. Saisons should finish dry, and for me the drier the better. This beer has just a bit of residual sweetness. Overall, this is a fantastic beer. I absolutely love the tartness. If it would just finish drier I would be in heaven."
"I try not to let a beer's hype affect my perceptions too much, but I was very excited to try this one, and extremely disappointed at the result. Everything I've heard and read about this beer leads me to believe I've received a bad bottle, so I look forward to a second attempt changing my mind."
"D: shared with a couple friends but would certainly grab more if it was available locally."
"A load pop of the cork and we get a gusher. Pours out a murky but bright yellow. Tons of floaties, even some black ones which a few thought might be dirt ;) Smell is musty, funky, almost dirty. Interesting. Taste is completely different, though. Very light and airy with light fruity flavors- soft lemon, strawberry, banana etc. What a different and fun beer. Soft medium mouthfeel makes this a summer winner."
"Downed the bottle and glad i got another one."
"Overall, very wonderful beer. One of my favorites Saison's I have ever had. A bit pricey but worth every penny IMO. Highly recommend to anyone."
"One of my favorites for sure, tangy, fruity, sweet and refreshing...tastes lighter than an 8% beer and is supremely easy drinking while still being incredibly complex and intriguing..."
"I poured from a 25 ounce bottle into a snifter. It pours a hazy deep orange with a slight white head that dissipates rapidly. The aroma is funky, citrusy, and acetic all at the same time. The flavor has lots of funk in it, and lots of sweetness. It is very complex, sweet notes overlapping citrus overlapping with sour notes. It has a very dry finish. It is full bodied and the alcohol is well hidden. A great saison, my only regret is I waited so long to try it."
"The acetic (lemony) flavors are overpowering. Otherwise the funkiness, exotic fruits, and rustic character of the drink create a beverage that is more intriguing the more you drink."
"D: Well blended, very good representation of the style, goes down easily. This one doesn't drink like an 8% - dangerously good and would love another for a nice hot summer day."
"Notes: Very tasty beer. So complex but balanced. Spiced, sweet fruit, grassy floral and herbal, a touch of bitterness, and some funky zesty saison flavors. Truly nice beer, that reminds me of springtime. Wonderful beer that is definitely worth trying."
"Light mouthfeel and light carbonation. this is a easy drinker and a keeper."
"The mouthfeel is on the lighter side with above average carbonation. Drinkability is excellent, it's very good tasting and well balanced. I haven't ever been a big fan of Saisons but I think I am now after this one. Best Saison I've had by far and rating to style definitely benefits it."
"Overall, this was great. The taste is spot on for the style, but a little boring on the nose. Certainly seek this out."
"Flavor is rich, with a complex blend of lemon zest, peach tart, sugary spice, earthy hops and strong toasted malt in the finish. The sugar sweet and peach tart grip the front of the palate and as the soft, effervescent body moves across the palate the mild earthy hops appear followed by the surprisingly potent toasted malt backbone. Finish is relatively dry and toasted, with lingering fruity acidic and sweet flavors. The alcohol detected in the aroma isn't apparent on the palate but this is surprisingly warming for a saison. Very unique, complex and enjoyable. Aside from the price, I'm always happy to have this beer."
"The palate opens quite juicy and fruity, very tropical in character with passion fruit, mango, peach and some pineapple. Spice character is quite remarkably low in this, I do not get any of the typical flavors I get from saisons. Sweetness is moderate with honey and floral character (from the nose) quite noticeable. A touch of tart citrus is present, modestly lemon rind in character, especially towards the finish. The finish is mildly drying, though there is a definite sweet honey character, along with the citrus and tropical fruit character. Medium in body with low carbonation, this is highly unconventional and absolutely not what I expected. One could argue that the mouthfeel is a little watery too. In any case, though, this is still an enjoyable beer. I will most certainly revisit this. I've had this beer a couple of times before this, and those experiences were significantly better."
"D - What a beer. I'm amazed by how floral this brew is, but also by how well-tempered the floral character is. It's just right. I'd love this beer with a creamy fresh-ripened goat's milk cheese. Yet another reason to love the Fantome beers."
"A fantastic Saison, Encore!"
"All in all, I did not enjoy this beer - and considering the price tag, I won't be buying it again. Very unimpressed and disappointed. It just seemed like a skunked beer."
"The mouthfeel is okay: well carbonated but a little thin. The drinkability is fine, and it was easy to get through, but I do not see any reason to pay 18 dollars for another one."
"D: Very, very easy drinking. Love this. Great springtime brew."
"M & D - Dry and crisp with medium body. Very delicious and refreshing."
"Overall an awesome beer. Glad I can get it by me."
"d - Admittedly not my favorite style of beer, but I thought this beer was great. The sweet and sour mix in both taste and smell made this very enjoyable, and it was still very easy to drink. I would definitely like to try this one again."
"As is often the case with Fantome beers, I enjoyed this beer more and more as I went along. Another interesting beer from Fantome. Would definitely order this again."
"Beer is medium to low bodied, finishes fine, nice sweetness up front, overall subtle on the sweetness. Beer finishes with this tartness / fruitiness that is similar to apples. Sour apples, second taste, there is definitely some sourness on the midpalate regions and that gives way to some fruitiness in the back palate. Not really bitter, overall drinkability is really high, so is mouthfeel. Love it."
"D- This is a very drinkable beer. A interesting beer for anyone to try. I would rather split this with someone to let them try than to drink it all by myself. Will be seeking a couple more bottles out for my cellar."
"Drinkability surpassed my expectations. Spot on to style, and one of my benchmarks Saisons IMHO."
"D: Very approachable yet a fun exploration. Very smooth, I could drink tons of this stuff, but I will have to be patient, because I want it around for a while."
"Overall- incredible. complex. this is one of my favorite beers ever."
"O: Overall an excellent beer, very good and unique. Shows the more rustic side of saisons."
"For me this 8% saison is as good as it gets. It was sour, complex, refreshing and I have to regard it as one of the best beers I have ever had regardless of style."
"Drinkable and pleasant, I know how much sugar Dany puts into his brews, so I always clean my teeth after one of his beers, I suggest you do the same if you want to keep them!"
"Reviewed on: 08-20-2009 03:25:21"
"I would love to have another bottle."
"D: I wish I had another bottle of this. It has been getting really hard to get a hold of Fantome beers and that really is a shame. I love everything I have ever had from them but this is a standout. World class."
"M/D - Light and crips. Sourness does not linger too long after the drink. Very easy drinking saison. Almost has hints of lambic in it. Very very good."
"Pretty darn drinkable, not as complex as I like my saisons, but still very nice. I would buy another bottle to age if feasible, to see how this ages. I remember drinking Fantome during a weekend in the Ardennes, this one brings back a lot of great memories. Enough of a sour/tart streak to this please sour freaks"
"If you have not had this beer you must."
"D- If drinkability could be rated a 10 on this site I would mark it that high. This beer is simply amazing. One of my favorites Ive had all year. I was sharing this bottle but really wish I had one to myself."
"D: Deliciously smooth, so in that way very drinkable. The sourness builds a bit...but it almost makes you want more, to retrieve the sweet flavors in the beggining of each sip/gulp/guzzle."
"Very drinkable. An excellent saison overall, up there in the top tier of the style for sure."
"Really nice balance, feel like you could drink it all night but at 8% this one could be dangerous - not a typical saison in that regards. Very nice beer, thanks Rob!"
"Saisons have risen to become mt favourite style, and even after all the ones I've had I can say that this Fantome is unique. I have heard that the flavour of a Fantome beer can vary drastically from year to year and batch to batch, but right now I'm really digging this one. It tastes like a saison with a bit of lambic thrown in for good measure, and its drinkability is extremely high. Great stuff, and I'm already anticipating what my other bottles have in store!"
"Review from notes taken on: 12/13/09."
"I was looking forward to this, but I am underwhelmed. This is one of my favorite styles, but this did not do it for me. There is nothing much here. Mostly watered down lemon juice. Nothing I would recommend."
"D: Highly drinkable. Quite complex and always inviting. Definitely one of the best saisons that I've come across."
"A great saison...'nuf said."
"Also, the moderate carbonation allows the taste to linger on the tongue between sips. That is a very good thing. Only after about ten minutes since my last sip is the taste finally dying. Guess I'll have to move on to something else..."
"Drinkability is off the charts. This is a killer beer, one of the best in the world, and something I will always keep a bottle or 20 on hand. World class, glad to finally start rating these Fantomes - I have a closet full just waiting to be rated :)"
"I can't wait to re-try this with a fresher bottle :)"
"Notes: Well there is my first Fantôme beer. I am looking forward to the remaining 3 that I have which will bring me to #800."
"At the price, I'll not be trying this again."
"Out of a 750ml corked and capped bottle. Pours a hazy straw color that produces a tight white head that dissipates into a solid ring. The aroma is tart with green apple skins and lemon. Some light barnhouse funk rounds out the aroma. The taste is of tart lemon, dry white wine, hay crushed black pepper, and light horse blanket. Not much phenols from the yeast. The feel is light to moderate, with tingly carbonation, finishes tart and dry. Must say that it is very refreshing. Not exactly what I'd usually prefer with saisons but this is very well made. I typical like my saisons a touch sweeter with more yeasty flavor but this has great balance and is very drinkable. Its tart but not to the point of puckering. Nice to finally see this available in my area and with a cork in the bottle. All previous Fantome bottles have been corkless and close to flat."
"Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is carbonated, tarty/puckering, some alcohol warming. The body of the beer is light to medium and the finish is medium. This is, I think the first funky Saison beer that I have tried. This is one beer to experience. I like the tartness and funky flavor in the beer, which give this beer a fresh vibe. I was very disappointed in the head, if the head would have been nice this beer would almost be perfect."
"750 mL green champagne bottle with no notches in the area on which to do so. It has a nice golden body with a few floaties, a good amount of carbonation, and a two finger cap of fluffy white froth that leaves loads of lacing/sheets on the glass. It becomes more opaque with subsequent pours and foam slowly builds in the bottle as I drink. In the nose there's a soft spiciness with some light hops, citrus?, tropical fruits?, an herbal, almost woody character, a big backing of yeast and some funky, almost sour notes. Spicy yeast and perfumy hops on the palate, with suggestions of orange and honey, pear, green apple, melon rind, mild alcohol, and some distracting cork flavors. Little, if any bitterness. The body begins light, with numbing carbonation that forces it to foam up a bit too much in the mouth, but when that calms down it's more smooth and dry, approaching silky, but never losing that carbonic edge. The quality of this beer snuck up on me - it was delicious from the start, but really good by the end. The only criticism I have is the pervasive cork character, but even this seems to blend well with the rest of the flavors. A highly-recommended saison."
"This is something that I look forward to aging as well as I feel this could definitely develop some really awesome characteristics a few years down the road!"
"Overall an amazing beer worthy of distinction."
"This Saison brings it, a must try. Not over the top but reminds you how good a Saison can be."
"A wonderful farmhouse treat with a velvet touch."
"Easy to drink."
"Thanks Paul! I might have to schedule another trade with you for more of this. Wow."
"Pours a very cloudy dark yellow, almost orange but not quite, color body. With a big creamy white head, lasting. Muted, musty aroma, fruity and sweet spicy. Maybe some plasticy. Soft taste, very muted, very light tasting. Some light fruitniness. Very light taste, drying. Almost watery. Thirst quenching, would be good on a hot day. Almost a plasticy taste. Just okay, not the greatest, not much flavor to speak of."
"Tastes like it smells, fruity, tart, funky and just plain different...but good. I think this is my third beer from this brewery and its probably mt favorite so far."
"The taste runs similar to the nose i.e. a huge gamut of flavors. Each new flavor flows smoothly into the next. The main tastes are bread, citrus, flowers, and earth. The body is medium with absolute smoothness. Simply fantastic all around."
"NOTE: I've had the opportunity to try a bottle of this that was cellared for about four years. It had not hold up well. It had lost quite a lot of the sweet fruity candy-like character and developed a more distinctly spicy and semi-funky character."
"D; I really wish I could drink this on a reagular basis. Not a session by any means, just a really exceptional beer. I would not refer to this as a sasion, this is very different."
"Been drinking the original Fantôme for a couple of years now, and it never disappoints. I love this beer for its unyielding earthiness, spiciness, and overall Saison-y-ness. I think it ranks among the best with Hennepin and Saison Dupont."
"Split a corked 750 mL bottle with fellow BA chowdahead at Ebenezer's Pub. This is unlike any other Saison I've tried. It was very refreshing, with a bold, fruity nose (far less horse blanket than I expected), and was tart to just the right extent (i.e., didn't temporarily wreck the palate). I would recommend this beer to anyone who likes Saison or better yet to anyone who is afraid of the funk - this beer would be a good jumping off point."
"A capped and corked 750ml bottle split with psycohops. Poured into a pair of shaker glasses. The ale appears a cloudy bright straw yellow color with a good inch of fluffy white foam. Nose and flavors are of over ripe oranges, pear, lemon, apple cider, tart, mild funkiness, vinegar, floral and fragrant. Decent carbonation levels with a medium body and a dry refreshing finish. Nice."
"This beer is surprisingly refreshing and drinkable for 8%. I'm enjoying it more and more with every sip. It's a little pricey, but I'm excited to try everything else from this brewery."
"Overall I'm lightly underwhelmed based on the reputation. It is enjoyable but it doesn't really work for me. I see it like this: I enjoy lemonade, and I enjoy water, but water with a few lemons in it is the worst of both worlds. Fantome lacks the enjoyable tartness of the lambics."
"Soft carbonation and very crisp up front with some nice light fruit notes such as apple, pear and banana that blend really well with the slightly tart funky earthy notes. Subtle clove spice with some citrus peel, grass and straw. Slightly sour/funky with a dry finish. Very refreshing."
"This is a drinkable Saison. The ABV is covered well, and this makes it sessionable. Flavor & mouthfeel make it almost perfect."
"Medium to medium-light bodied mouthfeel true to style. This is a fantastic, world class beer and I can see why it is at the top of the style class. Buy this!!!"
"Overall, this is one of the best beers I've ever tasted, and bar none the best saison. Do yourself a favor and pick this up if you see it."
"D: Amazingly refreshing. I would have no problem putting down a bottle after a day of farm work."
"Overall this is a very, very good saison but I have to say that I like the Printemps just a bit more. I've yet to be disappointed by Fantome and look forward to trying more of their beer."
"It is always a treat to have Fantome in the house, brewers who almost exclusively craft my favorite style, Saison. This pours a cloudy golden color, with a creamy looking white head that sticks around for a long while. Nose, as expected is beyond complex. Definite notes of grass, lemon, earth, funk, dusty horse blanket. Has a dry champagne quality to it, but also incredibly juicy, with citrus fruit such as lemon and orange. The funk adds an almost bread/onion/cheese quality to it. For somebody that absolutely detests onions, it is amazing that I really like it. Mouthfeel is medium and crisp in body. Again, swarming with complexities. Since this is not in my fridge all that often I will sip this bottle until it is gone, but alas, if this were available on a regular basis, I would be pounding this brew. My final verdict is that this a world class example of Saison. It ranks among the best of this style, and should be sought out by beer fans even if Saison is not your bag. Cheers"
"Drinkability: Not one to miss! Abundantly complex, flavorful, and particularly refreshing (especially considering the 8% ABV)."
"Pretty good for a fresh bottle but I'd really like to try this one with some age as I'm sure the wild yeast would do some interesting work on this one."
"This is special! So bold in aroma, and taste; it has been a joy, thank you Fantome!"
"A fun beer."
"D - I usually don't like sours all that much, but I like this one."
"Overall just about everything I hope for in the style. Highly recommended."
"Light and more refreshing than most saisons I've had recently. Fruity lemon, cantaloupe and apricot with a fresh musty yeast. Farmish--but a sunny, prosperous farm."
"Whether it's the yeast or the spirit of the Fantom, this is one to seek out."
"Overall, possibly my favorite Saison to date, which is one of my favorite styles. Therefore, this is one of my new favorite brews! Too bad it's a bit pricey, because at $14+ a bottle, I don't think I'll be getting this too often. Still, it was a great experience and a great brew."
"Awesome. I was holding on to this one for a while. It is as good as advertised."
"D - I would drink this any time of year, not just a summer saison to me. This saison is unique and drinkable like no other. I would choose this over 4 out of 5 saisons most likely. I can't recommend this enough - intense and slightly sour, but refreshing."
"I'm pretty certain this a bad bottle, but at $15.99 a pop I won't be purchasing another. Gotta go with what I've got for a rating - very dissapointing."
"Drinkability: A bit larger than most saisons, but way tastier too. Felt a little heavy at first, but after it warmed up for a bit, this went down just fine. Best saison I've had thus far."
"75cl bottle shared with larryLSB, pre-grad. Bright, hazy gold with a big white head. The flavor has bursting fruit and funky yeast with tropical and peach standing out. The flavor has the same intense fruitiness, with a funky, lightly tart edge, and a nice hop balance. Dry and refreshing on the tongue. Medium bodied with perfect carbonation that livens up the palate. This was just beautiful stuff that I'm already craving more of."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Smooth and really nice, the carbonation is seafoam in the mouth. The 8%alcohol has been gradually increasing its presence, but never dominating or becoming an obstacle. As with all of Fantome's offerings, I incorporate the yeast into the final glass and notice a smoother mouthfeel and less aggressive flavor profile."
"Hell yes! This is an absolutely stunning saison - the best I've yet had. You can see the raw, funky and dirty genesis of the style, but this one weaves all those characters into something greater. I need not mention that the perfect clarity on the palate makes this amazingly refreshing and drinkable. Ambrosia!"
"What a nice tasty treat. A good amount of puckering tartness in the late middle to finish. Front starts out a little laid back and stone fruits and spice explode in the middle. Very yeasty with peach and apricot the main fruits. Hints of apple, melon, pear and lemon as well. Nicely carbonated in the mouth with a good amount of acidity that's really showing through on the finish in the chest. Earthy, zesty and to the point. A very nice brew."
"It's a nice and complex beer. But it just seems to be lacking a little oomph. It's so ""deep"" that it doesn't light me on fire. It tastes great, then just sort of fades into nothing."
"D: Off the charts. A must have for any saison fan."
"D: This is pretty much the best saison I have had. It's prefectly sweet and sour and quite refreshing. This is probably the best Fantome beer I have had."
"Drinkability - Never has a saison made me sit back and think ""How did they do this"" until this beer. So different, so soft, so easy to drink, so complex, so well crafted. I'm just gonna sip this for awhile and let it all wash over me."
"Blipped ""Ghost Rider"" by Suicide"
"D - This was a very good and interesting beer lot of stuff going on in this one to make it very enjoyable wish I had more than the one bottle worth finding to try"
"This is a very complex beer. The taste changes substantially as it warms. When cold, dryness is the primary characteristic and it tastes like a dry champagne. Lots of fruit in the nose but as it warms, grass. Apricot, lemon, pear and very mild funk. When cold, it's so dry it evaporates off the tongue but warmer, it lingers and coats with some chewiness. A very light and soft mouthfeel compliments the other qualities of this brew. There is some brett here but in perfect balance. A great beer for a warm spring day."
"This was a great buy for 3.99 a pint. It is a light reddish orange color with a dark red center, with some spices and sediment at the bottom. Very flavorful, almost like apple cider but not that sweet or sour. I will probably buy this again and hopefully on sale."
"Overall, this is a good beer. I think this beer is very similar to a champagne due to the carbonation and elusive sweetness that hides behind it. It is still good and definitely still has the ever good beer components."
"D: Meh. Not a huge fan of saisons in general, but I've encountered several that had a stronger flavor than this, and it's not worth the ~$15 to me to try it again."
"Drinkability- I do kind of enjoy a Saison every now and again. It's definitely not my favorite style but I appreciate them more than most brews. This one is unlike anything I've tried before. Simply amazing. I didn't know anything called a Saison could taste like this. Crazy good beer that will make me find more to age and more of anything marked Fantôme."
"T:"
"Taste is nice...that barnyard funk fantome is known for, tropical fruits, grass...its a bit sweet in the finish. It has nice mouthfeel a bit carbonated for me, but very smooth and drinkable."
"M/D - light bodied and well carbonated, easy to drink and very flavorful. The slightly sour taste just leaves you wanting more."
"D= Extremely high. I love this beer. Maybe this is my first ""sour"" at least its the first one that I've had that I would concider sour. Very very nice beer and very new to me... Love it"
"Drinkability: This beer is good. Very good in fact, and I would appropriately (and as BAers seem to agree) call it the best saison I've ever had. It's authentic, earthy, funky, not too tart or sweet, spicy, and fruity - i.e., it's very complex. It'a also incredibly nice ""feeling," with a great body, as well as a solid aroma and appearance. The 8.0% is perhaps near the top of the stylistic range, but it's not detectable amidst the array of sensations this beer evokes. Recommended."
"Overall this is an excellent beer, one of the best I've ever had. It's not cheap, but if you find it, be sure to try it. It's an unusual combination that I would describe as saison, lambic, and funky Belgianess that you're sure to enjoy."
"If they had this at the bar, I'd buy one for everyone."
"Drinkability is very high. The flavor profile is spot on, and even with alcohol at 8% it's unoticeable. A great saison for sure, I can't believe I waited so long to try it!"
"Pours a slightly hazy golden yellow color, with a thick bright white head. Aroma is fruity sweet, with hints of lemon, nectarine. Taste is of faint peach, ginger, with some unique spices. Mouthfeel is very moist with just the right amount of effervescence, a slightly dry finish. Very light flavor takes a bit of getting used to, but moderate abv is very well hidden. One bottle of this is more than enough for me."
"Damn good saison. So hard to call whether it's the finest on Earth, but it's certainly a hell of a brew. Since I was celebrating anyways, the 14.99USD price tag wasn't that annoying, but it's definitely not an everyday brew at this price point."
"This is a standout beer for style."
"A fruity, mildly sour, delicious saison. I was first struck by the sweetly tart vinous flavor of this beer. The tartness surprised me, and it seems much fruitier than other saisons that I've tried. There are some background saison characteristics with a very mild farmhouse flavor. Ripe grapefruit is also a strong flavor, but I have no idea what it's from. There are nice dry oak notes. The color of the beer is very nice, but there is next to no head or lacing. The feel is good for the flavor but a tad strange. There's a good deal of spicing in the beer, some cinnamon and cardamom. The more sediment-ridden second glass that I had verges on a very dry and wonderful orange soda. There is a significant apple flavor that I neglected to mention until now; it's close to a great apple cider in some ways. This is a very interesting beer, and I look forward to trying more from Fantôme in the future."
"White head that kills fast. Sporadic lacing, low carbonation. This is a different version of the 'Fantome Saison' that I've grown to love and seek out. Rumor is that the brewer changes the fruit brewed in out with whatever of his choosing. I have had the 'brewed with spices' variant so many times before and this one is more of a pineapple version. Heavy pineapple and tropical notes on the nose. Hate to say it, but the dehydrated pineapple is an upset on this one, it isn't working. I would say the labeling on the two is confusing and misleading. Stick with the 'brewed with spices' and stay clear of this one."
"Pours a semi opaque yellow color with a small whispy screen of a white head that dissipates quickly but is easily revived with a slightly aggressive swirl. Tartness and light funk on the nose, notes of lemon, grass, and semi-sweet sour candy. Much is the same with the beers flavor, the sourness is perfectly placed atop a malty under structure and a pleasant but diminished hop bitterness, though the sour blasts appear through out the quaff it never becomes too puckering, IMO. Medium bodied, lacking much of its original carbonation but it makes for an easier to drink beer. Absolutely incredible, fresh is good but i think i opened this bottles at one of the perfect stages in its evolution."
"Overall, either a bad bottle or a major disappointment. I hope bad bottle and will try again but for now have to go with this review as it could just be the normal flavor. If this is normal, then one and done for me. I love saisons but this one is not good at all."
"Drinkability: Highly drinkable, will acquire another for the summer. Strangely thirst-quenching."
"D: Very drinkable for 8%. A high ABV saison but does not taste like it. Having had many many beers of this style, this is absolutely one of my favorites."
"Poured into Duvel tulip glass. Pours a very murkey darker orange with a somewhat small head with little retention and lacing. A good amount of sediment as you drain the glass...admittedly, not the best looking beer. Smell is very unique. Some sweet candi, ripe fruit including pears, peaches, apples and a bit of sourness to it. I can smell some yeast and a very faint hint of bread. Taste is superb. A very complex mix of ripe sweet fruits, yeast, and some tartness. The mouthfeel was very light and crisp. This is a very good beer and the ABV is hid very well. It was a great drinker and I can see having another...but not tonight."
"Clear golden color with a soft white head, good retention and lacing. Aromas of hay, lemon, must, cantelope, honeydew, and some pears. Grassy and musty at the beginning but some of the fruits mentioned in the aroma join in shortly thereafter. Earthy and fruity in the finish. Medium carbonation and body. Another great Saison from Fantome."
"Easily the best beer of the weekend. Pours hazy yellow with a big, rocky white head. Thick lacing. Funky sweet aroma with candied fruits. A wonderful taste for a saison. Lots of sweet oranges, strawberries, and plums. Sour yeast balances out the sweet and lets out the pepper and spice. Loved this beer."
"8% avb? no way. After the 750ml bottle you just want to pop another one open."
"I have to admit, I enjoyed both Hennepin and Saison Dupont even more... But this was good. I will have it again."
"Pours a hazed hazed & honeyed orange color, dense creamy white head fades very slowly, lots of sediment suspended in the beer. Some sourness and funk on the nose, peppery, an almost cider-like aroma as well. Lemony flavors, pretty tart overall, light pepper taste, maybe some apple/juicy pear in the mix too...there's a lot happening here. On the heavy end of medium-bodied, a lot of lingering spice working overtime on the tongue, cleansing tiny little bubbles doing their thing. This is good stuff."
"This beer pours a hazy golden color wiht a small head that quickly disappears. Smells a funky lemon, orange and is slightly acidic. The taste follows the nose and is sour with orange and a big pear flavor that finishes dry. The alcohol is covered up nicely and is barely noticeable. The mouthfeel has medium body and is very refreshing. The flavors really linger with this one. After giving my roomate a taste he commented that he could still taste the beer but in a good way. I was not crazy about this beer at first but it really grew on me. A must try."
"One of the most interesting saisons I can recall having. The about of sweet lemon tartness that dominated the palate was intriguing, albeit a bit distracting. The ghost on the bottle must serve as a warning to the mysteries which lurk within."
"The taste is very crisp and dry with just a subtle fruityness. Very clean and drinkable. This beer is very refreshing and I could easily see a farm worker craving one of these after a long day in the fields."
"D- It's a sipper because of its VERY unexpected tartness (for a saison). Overall, I really liked it, but I would wait 'til I'm in the mood for a Flanders or an American Wild before opening another."
"D: It is drinkable, but for me the overpowering sweet candi sugar note limited this factor. I was looking forward to this one, but honestly came away a little disappointed. (Once the higher ABV kicked in, it became much easier to quaff.)"
"D - Drinkability is one of the areas where this beer really shines. It just goes down so damn easy. Alcohol is hidden very well - which is dangerous for an 8% brew. Fantome has pulled off a very quaffable brew with the Saison. I would have more of this and can easily recommend it."
"Overall: not impressed"
"Pretty top notch brew. Different, but mightily tasty. A bit pricey, but I would surely buy this again and again."
"Markedly complex, original without losing sight of traditional aspects, this is one remarkable beer."
"A vigorous pour only gets half an inch of off white head that fades to a skim in a couple of minutes. Body is a golden straw honey in color. I wasnt expecting the nose to have such a yeasty sour tone to it with lots of fruit skins. As you take first sip you are surprised even though the nose warned of some tartness, it is subtle and crisp. A wonderful balance of bready yeast, sweet malt and crisp soured feel make for a lovely combination. This beer has tones of green apple, grape skin, fruit nectar tanins and yeasty breadieness. This really defies the style but in a good way. Mouthfeel is crisp, thick and doughy and calls for the next sip. Alchol is completely hidden. Super drinkable."
"Drinkability- Very nice on the drinkability scale. I could drink many Fantome's and be quite happy. If I ever go to Belgium, this brewery will be one of my first stops."
"Poured into a Duvel tulip. Cloudy gold color with a monstrous white head that leaves massive lacing. Aroma is of straw, lemon rind, myriad spices, and grass. Flavor is tart lemon with white pepper, dirt, grass, some tropical fruit, and an even crackery malt base. Nice complexity. Smooth and clean on the palate, good carbonation, dry finish, refreshing. One of the great classics of the saison style."
"saison straw color with consistent but not aggressive white head. delicate lacy, yeast smell of barnyard funk. banana, straw, and clove. nice light body solid but not strong carbonation. nice density throughout. taste of doughiness, light chamomile and honey malt, then big strawberry, light sweet, and a litte hop finish with herbal accent. great beer... a bottle of early summer at its best. crisp, not too meaty. don't know about all the time though. christmas in july."
"Delicate yet full body is crisp and refreshing. Really another masterpiece from Fantome."
"Hazy orange with a gushing white head. Aroma is complex mix of sugary lemon, yeast, and flowers. Or something like that. Maybe some bubblegum. I'm tasting some bitter herb/spice jive and some yeast. There is something harsh here that I'm not into very much, but I can at least objectively identify it as some appropriately earthy/ acidic quality that some people really go for. But then again maybe it's an apple jolly rancher thing attached to some bitter yeast. Aroma was the best thing for me here. I'm sensing the serious flavor quality here, but only objectively."
"Sweeter than most, more spice, and less funk. Quite tasty, and a very good saison but this bottle, at least, doesn't quite live up to it's rep as the best."
"Pours a murky orange/peach color with a massive fizzy white head. Nose is all belgian yeast, and spice. Taste follows with great belgian yeast character, apples, pears, peach, light grape, pepper. Awesome saison funkiness. Wow. mouthfeel is slightly abrasive as it is extreeemely carbonated. I know saisons are carbonated but this thing is carbonated straight up to bejesusville. Nice dry finish. Drinkability is quite good, especially for the 8% abv. Overall this is a very very good saison, one I am glad to have in the cellar, and one I will certainly revisit in the future. To bad it costs 15 goddamn dollars. WTF! Thats like 3 gallons of gas! Awesome beer."
"The smell is dominated with wild hints of pear, green grape skin, and pineapple. The taste matches the smll, with more intensity. The earthy / hay taste comes around also. The beer feels very champagne like in the mouth, with intense carbonation and dry light body. I could drink this all day long!"
"Pours a rich golden hue with a vibrant white head that mousses to the top of the glass and then drapes the walls with lace. Smell is full of lemon, ripe pear, green grapes, loads of pine apple, white cake, hints of tropical flora and earthy, fresh cut hay. Taste begins with a mix of pear, pine apple, and green apple and finishes with a beautiful array of farmhouse style hay, green grapes, pine apple, and lemon. Mouthfeel is very champagne-y. Magnifique!"
"If you like saisons, you must give this one a try. Simply a superb example of this style beer, yet a unique beer also. Highly recommended."
"Overall, very drinkable. Without a doubt, the best and most interesting saison I've tried. I have heard stories that Fantôme is hit-or-miss--this was definitely a hit."
"Pours cloudy orange with little to no head. (The first sign that this bottle might have been a little too old) Aroma is citrusy, herbal, funky and a nice finish of yeast. Flavor is salty and sour. Not quite what I was expecting. I guess this Saison tends to be more on the sour end, but I was expecting something more citrusy with an intense yeast profile. I'm just not a fan of sour beers."
"hazy dark golden with a white head. citrus, spice and signature fantome funk in the nose and taste. lemon, ginger, honey, slight, slight hint of clove, and maybe a hint of corriander and cardamom and a touch of sweety goodness... absolutely delicious. wonderful, soft, medium body. perfect carbonation, and long finish. in my top three favorite breweries of all time. i could drink this all day every day."
"A fantastic beer. great with a meal involving pork loin. A great example of the style. Definitely worth trying if you are lucky enough to find it."
"Saw this one on the shelf of De-Vino's, an amazing surprise at a fairly irregular beer stop. Pours how a saison should. a deep orange color with a finger of white head, nice and fluffy, on top. A slow dissolve down to a thickish mass of head on top. Nice. Nose is...powerful. Huge citrus aromas, with a ton of sourness in there too, although it mixes nicely with that farmhouse, earthy yeast. Flavor's likewise. Huge citrus, yeast, and sourness. Does a good job of mixing the sourness with the citrus and yeast, not straying into the uber-sourness of the Bam Biere or other Jolly Pumpkin brews (which aren't terrible, but certainly aren't the most complex of drinks). Really a fun feel comes with the sticky sourness. There's a touch of skunky graininess in the background that keeps this one from greatness, but fortunately it goes away as the beer warms up. A delicious sour candy aftertaste. Mouthfeel is lively and fun, with high carbonation and a fairly full body. Overall, a very tasty beer, one that I'm happy I tried. An unique sourness to it that melds nicely with the farmhouse funk and citrus hints."
"The best saison in the world (that I've had anyway)"
"before this, i was only just starting to truly appreciate this style of beer. but it's now official - i LOVE saisons!"
"Man this is good. There is something new to behold with each sniff and each sip, and it's just friggin delicious. I love it when a beer makes me lick the inside of my mouth after each sip to get whatever flavor is left lingering, and this one does that. I will be back for sure."
"Drinkability is exceptionally high given the careful balance between flavors. The sour/flunky taste cleans the palate well and refreshes to create a new experience with each sip. Absolutely fantastic."
"Nawt f'nuttin', but I expected a great deal out of this and can appreciate the workmanship and classic style involved but it wasn't what I was looking for at first. With warmth it definitely improved as the unexpected funk burned off and became quite drinkable and enjoyable."
"Fantome Saison pours into my oversized wine goblet with a hazy orange gold color and a just off white head. The head fizzles to a ring around the glass and leaves very little lace. The aroma is slightly sweet and fruity (ripe apples) with a hint of spice. The taste is rather sweet up front with a fruity touch. The finish is slightly tart, but certainly not inappropriate for the style. What is odd is the rather full body, cloying sweetness, and lower carbonation that the style would normally dictate. A bit of yeast spiciness is present and conveys perhaps a bit of a citric edge. Overall, I find Fantome Saison to be a tasty beer, but it rather misses the mark for the style. I would prefer a more refreshing and dry beer, with a strong yeast spiciness and lower sweetness. Either way, give this a try, it is a nice beer."
"750ml capped and corked green bottle from The Lighthouse in Manchester. Pours a murky light straw yellow with a half inch of off-white head. Smells fruity - grapefruit, orange, and hints of apple, as well as hints of caramel malt. Tastes sweet, with strong orange notes, as well as apple, pear, lemon, pith, and malt. Wonderfully complex. Fairly dry and clean toward the finish. Medium in body with ample carbonation. Super tasty, wonderfully rich and complex, yet light and very drinkable. This beer disappeared well before I thought it would, and I'd gladly have this on hand at all times."
"D: Even at eight percent, this beer is super drinkable and refreshing. I quaffed the bottle in no time and if I had another I would have quaffed that too. I love this beer! I want more of this type of beer."
"Pour gently as some of the bottles I've had have flecky sediment that can ruin the last glass."
"D- Wow!!! I didn't think a beer could be so much like champagne! This beer is so much like a dry champagne it is scary. I love Saison beers, this may top any I have tried."
"Overall, very easy to drink. The ""best buy"" markers on the side of the bottle weren't marked, but I'm guessing this has been around a while. Wish I knew... Anyway, good beer to try."
"Highly recommended. Wish I could get this for cheap (if so, this would become my tailgate, BBQ, everyday beer)."
"D: This is a nice beer. Complex yet simple. Bold yet timid. Everything you come to expect from a Saison. An assertive dynamic beer that you can drink either to savor or to slurp."
"This saison is not as good as Saison Deluxe by Southampton, and I am somewhat shocked saying this, because Southampton beers obviously are made by Americans and this is a traditional belgian style ale. I was slightly disappointed by this beer..but its probably just me, as this beer has an A rating with over 300 reviews. At 17 dollars a bottle I'm not sure if or when I will be buying this again."
"The parts are impressive, but the sum ends up even greater. It's pert and sassy, clean and satisfying, and it gets better as the glass gets lower. The ABV is moderate, but no matter, because it drinks as smooth and easy as any of the style of tried, and that speaks volumes because it's my favorite style. It's standard, world-class, and an example of top-notch brewmanship."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Medium-light on the palate with delicate carbonation, and with good amounts of it. Finish is semi-sweet and semi-dry. At times it feels dry-once the woody type of flavor comes around, during others the sweetness of the malt body comes through and it seems to finish a bit more sweet. This is a beer that I'd gladly pick up, just a great saison, the best I've ever had. Mouthfeel is somewhat warming, pleasantly warm, from the alcohol."
"D: Very drinkable. 8% isn't extremely high but is surprising. $14 a bottle sure is a drawback.. but I guess every once in awhile is ok."
"The best saison I have had yet."
"D--Why does this beer have to be so rare? When I go to Belgium, I am going to hit this brewery up. Terrific beer, get it, enjoy it."
"Bought this at South Bay Liquor. Thanks Joey! Decanted from the bottle into an oversized wine glass. Pours a beautiful golden color with a two-finger head that dissipates into a thin layer. Aroma is funk, spice, lemon, and a candy-like note. Smells great. Taste is well matched with the aroma. A little funk at first, then plenty of lemon and candy, with a little herbal hop kick at the end. Delicious. Mouthfeel is on the thin side of medium, but smooth and refreshing. Saisons are generally easy for me to drink, and this one might be on the top of the drinkability list. Overall this beer is exactly what I wanted on a hot day and is excellent in general."
"D- pretty good, glad i tried sadly wont really see this much again as its not a locally available kinda beer."
"Pours a golden cloudy yellow. There's quite a bit of yeast in the bottle so pour gently. White lacy head. It looks like summer to me. The aroma is fresh, bready and citrus laiden. There's also some apparent clove and spicy notes. It's pretty complex and very inviting. Many saisons can over do the spice or have too much earthy funk, but this thing just makes you want to drink it down. The flavor starts off surprisingly tart and is warmed up with a complex spicy clove and belgian sweetness in the background. It's very dry. There's not much if any percievable residual sugars, so it's incredibly refreshing and drinkable. This is one outstanding beer. It's a bit heavier on the lactic acid than most saisons, but it works very well for this beer. Outstanding. If I could afford it, I'd add it to my list of regulars."
"This is one hell of a fine Saison. It impresses on so many levels. For me, the balance here is what I'll remember most. Its flavor is nothing short of extravagant. Yet, the vast array of components play a somewhat modest role. Nothing is overpowering or comes across as a dominant flavor. They synergize to create a damn fine tasting Saison. This one is certainly a ""can't miss."""
"D: is it drinkable? I am pissed I only got one bottle. It is amazing. Worth a try at least, especially if you like saisons."
"A wonderfully complex and tasty beer."
"D - an amazingly drinkable beer. highly recommended for almost any occasion."
"Great beer, I really enjoyed this."
"this is not an overrated beer. definitely one of the best saisons i've had. very satisfying."
"Easy, decent carbonation, bomber is enough for me. But I want more, will try the Xmas one first. This beer is immensely drinkable and thoroughly enjoyable."
"The taste was sour and left a soft tingling in the top of the mouth and tongue. It was carbonated softly and was light in the mouth. Overall a wonderful beer."
"Mildly acidic, light-moderate feel with low carbonation. This beer is immensely drinkable and thoroughly enjoyable."
"I could drink a lot of this stuff. It goes down smooth yet crisp, with a nice feel and great flavor. The abv is occasionally noted but overall very deceiving. Reminiscent of a lightly fermented apple cider or fruity dry champagne, though it certainly rivals in ease of consumption."
"This is one of the BEST beers that I have tasted. I don't know all the adjectives I'm supposed to use, but It was a beautiful color with an amazing taste. I will be buried with this beer. I bought all the bottles I could find and hope to get more soon. THE BEST BEER IN THE WORLD!!!!"
"D: This is a fantastic representation of a saision, amazing flavor and incredible balance but brought down just a tiny bit by the flatness of the mouthfeel in the middle of the 750mL bottle, still a must try for any saison lover, possibly one of the best out there today."
"Very drinkable made me wish for summer will grab another one for sure"
"The drinkablility is limited in my opinion only by the extreme deliciousness found in the flavors. I never want my bowl of Crunchberries to end, same sad tale with this beverage. Absolutley a wonderful experience. I tasted this one after a glass of Saison Dupont, and it really made me realize the depth of flavors to be found in a Saison. All fruits in the harvest. Cheers to Mr. Prignon. Phenominal!"
"Drinkability: This is drinkable, but damnit if I am not disappointed by this one. It *could* be my bottle, and I do have a local place I found that carries it also so maybe one day I will try again, but I got this from a reputable seller (Beverage Warehouse), and so that seems unlikely."
"Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied, whish is a bit thinner than I was expecting, but oh my God is this thing drinkable. I could drink this all night until it eventually kicked my ass."
"Notes - I've had this beer several times and it always seems a bit different than I remember it. I'm not sure if it's the beer itself constantly changing, or if I'm just experiencing new complexities. In any case, this is an absolute classic of the style, and highly recommended - worth trying at least once."
"Mouthfeel is a bit aqueous and carbonation is surprisingly low. This is a good Saison but nothing outstanding here."
"Drinkability: I would only try this again if I knew it was fresher. At $12.00 a bottle, this one was a waste."
"750 ML green Belgian bottle purchased corked, but not caged from Super Saver in Edison... Pours a hazy, misty, cloudy copper and tangerine hue with minimal frothy head that soon dissipated... smell was replete with nectarines, oranges, and citric acidity... taste strongly complemented the aroma, with spritzy, seltzer-like floral essences, some pear and grapefruit, and noticeable oranges... Crisp, clear, clean mouthfeel with a modest level of drinkability despite the 8% ABV, which struggles to make itself noticeable... Wasn't blown away by this particular offering from Fantome, which is rather unusual because most of their beers are top-notch..."
"Served in my Ommegang brewery 10th anniversary glass. Poured a hazy gold with a frothy white head that could barely be contained in the glass. Complex scent - lemon, belgian yeast, apples and spice (maybe pepper). When I first opened the bottle, my immediate impression was chardonnay. Taste similar to nose with the addition of pear. Lively mouthfeel; pleasantly effervescent with a slightly tart, but clean finish; somewhat citrusy. Excellent saison. My first sampling from Fantome leaves me wanting for more."
"D: This goes down so smooth and easy with nary a hint of alcohol. An unsurpassed Saison from the Belgian master!"
"Split a bottle of this with a buddy. Extremely hazy golden brown with a thin head and moderate lacing. Looked a lot like apple cider. Smell is an in-your-face blend of spice and fruit. Fruits are both sweet and bitter. It's like smelling both the fruit itself and the rind all at once. Underneath it all is the aroma of Belgian yeast for authenticity. Taste is quite tangy. It was a pleasure for my mouth, but offered seering pain for my chapped lips. This is bad boy is complex! Spices, fruit, and yeast all over the place. It seems there is something for every region of my taste buds. Definitely a unique experience and definitely something to change people's minds about what a beer can be. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side, though it fits well here. This is just an all-around solid beer, though my first for the style."
"M/D: Extremely light, extremely dry. Light carbonation, nearly no hint of the 8% . Drinkability is excellent, so smooth and so damn easy to drink. Hard to believe that the big companies seek out light bodied and drinkable lagers, when this this baby blows them all away, while still providing taste and smell. Very nice beer."
"D: gets better with every sip. A good solid saison."
"Notes: This tastes every bit as good as its reputation. World class."
"D: I already subscribe to the believe that Saisons are among the most drinkable and refreshing of all Belgian ales, however I was blown away at how easy it was to put this down considering its high 8% ABV."
"Poured into a Belgian snifter appeared hazy gold with a very nice fluffy head. The smell is huge on funkiness. Very musty like barn animals. The taste is dominated by the Belgian yeast earthiness and funkiness, which is still strong but isn't as prevalent as the smell. A good standard mouthfeel... smooth... but the flavor of this is just slightly overwhelming for me to want to drink it a whole lot. Interesting saison though."
"I wouldn't revisit."
"Had it for dinner with a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken, a surprisingly good match."
"D- This is a fairly drinkable brew. I have never been a huge fan of the saison style but this is my favorite of the few that I have had. The hop presence really helps me enjoy this one."
"The carbonation is understated and it has a light quality to it. Very smooth with alcohol well-hidden. This is deceptively thirst-quenching."
"Into a tulip glass, pours a cloudy gold, a whopping frothy head that recedes steadily, nice lace with small blobs that stick. The aroma is everything saison, citrus galore, lemon and orange zest, coriander and other spices, quite nice. The taste follows suit, a medium body, nicely carbonated. Its juicy and fresh, zesty with lemons and oranges, nicely tempered spices. Everything up till the taste is pretty nice, but once ya tip it back, its gold. A very solid saison."
"Pours a cloudy golden brown with a sizeable head. Nose is light with an almost soap sud essence to it, but in an organic way. Somewhat of a bitter edge to it. But overall it is pretty smooth and light. You get a long term feel of yeast in your mouth and a touch of citrus for a whole, though not as long as the yeast. Feel is as it should be expected: frothy and smooth. Pretty drinkable, though it might not be a session brew of course."
"I paired this with spicy, fried catfish and it worked nicely. I would expect it to go well with any seafood dish."
"Beautiful looking beer. Golden straw with good clarity and a three finger fluffy white head. Nose- musty tartness. Taste- pale malt with a twinge of dry tartness that is earthy, woody and quite spicy. Some lime is evident as well. Carbonation is spritzy but not biting on the tongue. This really drys out the mouth in a good sort of way. Drinkability is good, and its always a sad moment to see an empty bottle of Fantome."
"Crisp with moderate body and high carbonation characteristic of the style. Clean in the finish with little detectable warmth. Very complex and well done. Lots of flavor compounds to consider."
"Great saison all around. Quite a bit more funk than most of the other saisons I've tried, which I like. I'd like to put this next to Avec in a side-by-side."
"Well, I normally dont buy fifteen-dollar beers but the Noel I had several months ago convinced me Fantome is real as steel and now its bottle poppin time. This poured a nice golden color with a slight haze to it. The head is close to non-existent, just white wisps on the surface. The smell is glorious fruits like orange peel, spices, this is how I expected VE07 to smell and it let me down. The taste is like lemon zest, pepper, with a slight amount of tart funkiness peeking from the background, excellent."
"The aroma is absolutely stunning, hard for me to succinctly describe in all its funkiness. There were citrus and sour notes clashing it out, and some ""Belgiany"" yeasty ester aroma not unlike Unibroue as well. The flavor was likewise complex, probably the dominant tone was sour like a lambic, but there were spices involved as well and I can't pinpoint what they are exactly. It was just a really nice mix of flavors, spicy and hot and citrus and sour. Real nice drink, I would buy it again without hesitation."
"Decent amount of hops in the nose, bits of grass and orange zest as well. Some lemon and a strong yeast smell, very bready. The taste is kind of wild... Tart and in your face with a subtle spicy side to it. It's very fruity, lemon, peach, strawberry, green apples, green grapes, and a bit of raspberry. There is a little bit of hops present, yeast and a light sugar flavor. All in all, incredibly refreshing - very crisp and smooth with a definite pucker punch and a little bit of a warming sensation. Medium to light bodied with moderate carbonation. This beer has a lot going for it."
"D- This is a very good saison with excellent complexity. I'm sad that mine was slightly light struck...but it was still delicious none the less. One that I will definately purchase again."
"As is, it would be perfect for a warm day, or as a great apertif."
"D: Quite an easy drinking beer. The 750ml were gone very fast, leaving me wanting more. It was very good, but I guess because I already knew its BA rating, I was expecting too much and was almost a little disappointed."
"This beer poured a hazy yellow with a thick head  nice lacing. The aroma is floral and spicy. The taste is also spicy and floral with some bitterness and a touch of sweetness. This is a flavorful, but mild beer that has great balance. The mouthfeel is medium and smooth. Overall, this is an easy to drink, light, balanced brew."
"Hazy golden to peach color with a finger and half of rocky white head and a fantastic retention. The nose with its twangy, funky yeast character also displays some pepper, citrus, floral alcohol esters, and bitter hop notes. Sour twang dominates the beginning with a large yeasty profile. Notes of lemon pith, faint orange and lime, grassy at times, and a little bitter hops. Some malt sweetness is there but largely consumed by the sour yeasts. Becomes more vinous as it warms. Really frothy mouthfeel that isnt thick but has a good weight to it. The finish maintains the bitter/sour citrus, especially lime, and bitter dryness."
"D - Good, though I can imagine some flavor fatigue might begin to creep up on me if I tried to have more than one 750. Still, an odd but drinkable beer that by no means seems to conform to the benchmarks set by the other saisons I've had. For better or worse, depending on your taste and possibly your mood, Hennepin this is not. If this is their regular saison, I must wonder, what does the Strange Ghost sitting in my fridge have in store for me?"
"After a loud pop, this pours out a beautiful brass color with tons of champagne-like carbonation, and a thick, soft whipped egg white head made up of tight bubbles. The head does not quit. When drunk, this leaves gigantic lacing all along the side of the glass. Smells like orange blossom honey, light berries, lemon, earthy funk, sweet orange, earthy, dirty hops, and herbal hops that give this almost a minty edge. Grain and alcohol are ever so slight and merely act to round this out. An acidic tartness hits the tip of the tongue initially and then washes over the entire tongue while light stone fruits, spicy yeast, and sweetbread become present. The funk doesn't jump out at you so much as it plays it relatively quiet, so as to accompany the tartness. Remains fruity all the way to the end (and on into the aftertaste) as the beer dries up and the hops come into the foreground bringing flavors of perfumey flowers, mint, and earth. Alcohol is subtle. Mouthfeel is light-bodied and very active on the tongue. This certainly does not drink like an 8% beer. It is at once refreshing and enormously complex."
"750ml bottle, served in a tulip glass. Dates on the label, but nothing was stamped. Orange color, medium-sized head. It had a great citrus/spice aroma. It smelled like those oranges you see at holidays with the cloves embedded in them. Taste was the same, a little muted compared to the aroma, and pretty tart. Thoroughly enjoyable beer."
"I am not a big fan of sour/tart beers, but I think this beer is a nice example of a beer where the sourness balances the beer and makes the beer not acidic, but 'fresh'."
"Poured into a tulip a nice slightly cloudy pale golden yellow color, awesome carbonation, huge 3 finger plus creamy white head, tons of sticky lacing to follow. The nose is malty, yeasty, green apples, and spicy. The taste is malty/yeasty, nice tangy/soury, good dose of spices. The finish is slightly dry. Medium body, highly carbonated. Drinkable, one of the better Saison I've had to date, recommended."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied, sweet pear up front, grazing along the tongue and palate with beautiful carbonation and mild tartness that kisses you goodbye on the dry finish. Lovely beer."
"Get yourself one of these."
"D: The light body and tart flavor hides the alcohol very well. Surprisingly, this beer complements bbq very nicely. Makes an excellent nightcap on a hot summer night."
"Peachy golden color with a minimal head that leaves a tiny amount of lacing. Smells of peaches, apricots, and peppers. Notes of hops and sugar. The taste is dry until the very end when it sweetens just a touch. The fruit is there, along with an alcohol warmth and a touch of malt. Very nice & very balanced flavor. The mouthfeel is soft with a nice bit of carbonation. Again, a very balanced brew. The drinkability is excellent, with the touch of sweetness at the end making you want the next to start the dry/sweet cycle over again. The bottle is 750ml, and was difficult to get. I fear it will be gone far too soon. My assessment? Don't fear the ghost!"
"D: Not outstanding, but still very nice. Quite different from other saisons that I've had and worth having again."
"Pours a hazy golden color with a 1 inch white head that is holding up quite nicely. It's slowly leaving an exceptionally thick layer of lacing in it's wake. The aroma is outstanding. Very bright and alive with Belgian yeast and floral notes. I detect something resembling jasmine, and maybe a little lemon zest. Some spices in there too, but their identity remains unknown to me. Hmm. the taste isn't quite what I was expecting, but still very good. It's a little more restrained than I was hoping for. I wanted a bit more sourness and funk in there. But don't get me wrong, this beer is incredibly complex, and leaves a pleasant aftertaste. It's very light and refreshing. Honeydew. Silky on the tongue. Incredibly smooth. Tastes mildly sweet, but finishes dry, if that makes sense. Like other Belgians I've tried, something in here is reminding me of green tea. Not sure why I keep thinking that, but it's something in the aftertaste. Leaves my tongue feeling the same way it does after drinking plain green tea. Like it's freshening my breath or something. Anyway, I am impressed with this offering, and will definitely be trying it again in the future. In just minutes, it's become one of my favorite summer beers."
"Really happy I finally got to try this one, and it did not disappoint. I got the bottom of the bottle so there was a ton of sediment in my glass, but other than that the appearance was fine. Aroma is just great -- floral, funky, and leather or barnyard aroma. Carried over into the flavour as well; all sorts of cool stuff going on here, and I'd love to get a bottle of my own to ponder over. Very, very thick mouthfeel for the style -- I liked it, but it might almost be too much when drinking a larger quantity. Who am I kidding? This was great!"
"This has been my favorite beer for some time, although I've only had it on draught, and not in about 2 years. I try as many as Fantome's other offerings as I can, and while some are quite good, none of them touch the wildness of this one, which is a shame. How much of that is reflection of having only had this on draught, and the others only in bottles, I don't know...bottom line, the Fantome Saison is my vote for best beer in the world!"
"Overall, a hugely complex and enjoyable beer. There is so much going on, I probably won't find everything with this one bottle. Highly recommended."
"Pours with a peachy white head, a marmalade orange colour. Bits of sediment. Tremendous spice in the aroma - chamomile, ginger, nutmeg, everything you could find in a Christmas pudding but better...summery! Aggressive carbonation. The yeast carries a wicked spiciness to it. Earthy malty flavours. A beautiful thing of a saison!"
"drinkability is great. well balanced and very enjoyable. glad i picked this one up."
"Next step...achieve dream of tasting Fantome at the source. Can't imagine cruising the Ardennes Forest region on a bike and stopping in for a fresh chalice of Fantome."
"D: A very drinkable and refreshing beer. Where is the 8%? You sure as heck can't taste any of it. A nice refreshing beer for a summer evening. Complex yet tasty and light. A very interesting beer and style. Honestly, I'm not sure the style is my cup of tea. A little too tart and sour for my liking. Glad I tried it but I probably won't be drinking a lot of these."
"More tart and citrus than I remember from when I first tried it almost a year ago. Tasty and refreshing. Still trying to beat Hiver and Black Ghost. This one gets close, but falls just a hair short. Like most Fantomes, complex as hell!"
"An utterly fantastic beer, just a near perfect Saison. The original is still the best in my opinion. Pours a cloudy golden with a nice initial head that fades to a thin cap with great lacing. The smell is a heavenly mix of apricots, banana, and bubblegum, perfectly balanced and integrated. More echoes of that fine aroma in the flavor, but a little heavier on the aapricot and with some spritzy lemon juice and zest as well, followed by a little pleasant waxiness and apple in the finish. The mouthfeel is beautifully creamy and tangy- you want to keep drinking and drinking this, and you don't notice the alcohol at all. For the style, nearly perfect."
"D - This one gets better with each sip."
"Overall - Excellent beer and my favorite saison. Too expensive to drink constantly, which is a shame."
"D - Overall I would have to say awesome. A very unique and hard to verbalize brew. So many different ways this could go. Very enjoyable, not too heavy, but not a lightweight by any means. This is something that I would definatly want to go back and try again!"
"Drinkability: Very drinkable for a saison. Nice"
"Tangy, wheaty malt flavors up front. Light honey and fruit sweetness. Tart, lightly citrusy edge. Freshly mown grass and hay flavors, along with herbal, funky sea air hoppiness. Slightly musty. Solid bitterness throughout counters the mellow-sweet wheat and fruit malt nicely. Dry, slighlty acidic finish. Herbal, vegetal, sea air hops stick around forever! Delicious. Medium-bodied with a smooth, perfectly-carbonated feel. Very well-crafted and amazingly drinkable. Would love to have this on tap at home year round!"
"One of my last remaining bottles...Oh well, got to drink it sometime. Cork did not want to extract. Corkscrew just pushed it back into the bottle. When this happens with wine, it is not a good sign. Using a paper clip to hold the cork back, I got a nice hazy golden pour topped with a huge foaming head. Smells of citrus and some light funk hit the nose. Taste starts out somewhat tart and bitter, but a surprising lemony sweetness pulls through. Very nice. The tastes really play well off one another. Mouthfeel is smooth. If it were not for that massive head, I'd think that there was no carbonation at all. Drinkability is also grand. Like most good Saisons, this was gone in no time at all. Can't wait to restock!"
"Seriously sealed with a crown cap, and a flush cork, this green bomber yielded a pale straw colored beer that was very cloudy with suspended yeast. The head was two finger thick and foamy. The aroma was hearty, yeasty, and rustic. The taste was drier than the middle of the Sahara Desert. This moderately spiced farmhouse ale was tart, floral, and noticeably bitter. A little taste of vanilla, followed by an oak dominated finish. Went very well with some spent grain bread (from a local brewpub) dipped in Fleur de Sel butter as well as some Beemster cheese. I felt that this Saison was a little less malty and funkier than the standard bearer of the style Saison DuPont (although it does have more ABV). Nonetheless, this was a hearty and refreshing drink, and I found it it be well deserving of the accolades it has gotten."
"D: Not sure of the drinkability on this, seems a bit too unbalanced, almost like a gueze. Still pretty cool."
"It's definitely I will revisit again."
"Bottle courtesy of Boboski: Poured d own a slightly hazy beige color ale with a nice foamy head with great retention and lacing. Aroma of funky yeast is dominating with some Belgian malt and some floral/fruity notes. Taste is also dominated by yeast with some sourness and brett like characteristics. There is also some sweet and floral note4s that provide much enjoyment as well as some light spices. Taste is quite complex but easily enjoyable with a full body and great carbonation."
"D- good. alcohol slightly noticable but not detracting. complex. starts sweet and ends bitter/dry. was expecting more earthiness. one bottle was good for me in a sitting, but will drink again."
"One excellent saison. Recommended."
"Drinkability: Very cleansing and tart, a nice level of sour with some bitterness and other flavors to make a unique beverage that's very enjoyable."
"Mouthfeel was medium to full-bodied. Minimal carbonation. Somewhat slick in the mouth. This actually tasted more like a Belgian Strong Pale Ale rather than a Saison. I really didn't experience any funkiness or spritzy carbonation."
"Poured into a Duvel tulip. This is a very nice looking beer - cloudy yellow/orange with a bone white head that goes nowhere fast and leaves some incredible lacing. Smell is crisp and refreshing, like a perfect summer day. More specifically, apples and clove dominate and in a very nice manner. I have to admit that my first sip was not a good one. Initially, I thought this would be a pain to get through, but after a while, this grew on me, as any good beer will. Totally refreshing is how I would characterize this - citrusy, apple-y, and little floral and malty. Wonderfully complex and delicious - this would be perfect on a hot day (too bad it's like 15F outside currently). Mouthfeel is well carbonated, but could use a little more to be crisper (a mild complaint). I could drink this all day - very easy on the palate. Highly recommended."
"Overall, I am hoping that I just got a bad bottle, because I was extremely disappointed. Were it not for my friends, I would have poured the rest of the 750ml down the drain."
"D- This single bottle just seems worse. I have had it 2 times before and both times it was great so I think I am going to give the scoring to the other ones I have had. Since I know it's good but this bottle just isn't."
"D: This beer for sure lived up to the hype, very tasty brew would drink this again for sure."
"this fine brew is actually rather bitter"
"This is a great, very full flavored Saison. It has mad complexity and a tonne of fruit flavors. I recommend it."
"D - Gets stupid sour as it warms, and the alcohol becomes more evident. Not my favorite saison so far."
" This is a beer that leaves you wanting more. Best Saison I have had so far."
"I enjoyed the heck out of this beer, but I don't know how indicative it is of the saison style. Whatever, I don't care, it was really good. Maybe I just need to have some more saisons... maybe I just need to have some more Fantome. Definitely recommended."
"Drinkability: Crisp and refreshing. Balanced well."
"Thanks to my friend and fellow BA HardTarget for sharing this rare example."
"Creamy and highly carbonated, refreshing and light-bodied. Incredibly drinkable. I could see myself downing pint after pint if I lived in Belgium."
"Mouthfeel is big and creamy. Much more so than expected. A real treat. Drinkability is well above average. It's a beer you want to sip and share."
"Pours out hazy gold colored body, big white head, slowly fades with lots of lacing. Smells sour and funky, apples, and other fruits are up front, spicy and very nice.The taste is light, crisp, fruity with citrus. Good mouthfeel, finishes heavy wih a little alcohol noticible at the end."
"Gosh, I really, really wanted to enjoy this beer. Had been looking for Fantome for a long time and my local beer store finally got some. I'm willing to admit that it might have been my own taste buds that were off -- perhaps the bottle was old or I served it too cold -- but I did not enjoy it, and in fact poured it out. To me the beer was not carbonated enough (which is interesting, considering some of the other reviews). Taste was weak, insipid, dull - a pale impression of other saisons that I have had and enjoyed (indeed, Hennepin is one of my favorite beers). I may spring for another bottle one of these days, but I'm not impressed at all."
"The more bitter elements are dulled quickly by the palate, and this beer becomes far too easy to drink at 8%."
"Opinion: I think that this is a pretty darn good beer. It is a bit spicy for my taste. I gave my wife a taste (who doesn't judge beer but has a pretty good palate though she won't admit it) and she said that she got a medicinal impression. I think that this was a misinterpretation of the spices. The beer is really well attenuated and well balanced for the attenuation and spice additions. Even after it warms the strength is completely masked. Though I think that I may prefer Saison Dupont more at this time (until I try them side by side), this beer is still really tasty and I would certainly drink it again."
"Drinkability is perfect. This beer tastes so perfectly balanced and delicious that I could constantly drink this. By far, the premiere saison."
"750 bottle with cork and cap. Gave a hearty pop when the cork was pulled. Poured with high carbonation but almost no head. No lace. Fruit and spice notes in the taste were subdued in the aroma. Aroma was more of the sour lambic quality, with almost no lambic taste in the beer. Odd. Palette was active, due to high carbonation, and quite complex for such a light colored beer. Slight fruity after taste of strawberries and lemongrass."
"Fantome Saison pours a pale golden color with a thick white head from a green 750 ml bottle that has a crown over a cork (corkscrew required). Great citrusy aroma with a touch of funk. Taste also has citrusy notes, lemon, orange and some rind. Definitely a bit of funk thrown in too. The alcohol is fairly well hidden, but I catch a bit of it now and then. Excellent, hightly drinkable. Recommended."
"Pale gold and quite clear topped by a big, fluffy, bright white head supported by ample carbonation. Good retention and a thick collar of bubbles that hug the glass for about a half inch above the top of the beer. Fruity nose with lemon zest, peaches, grapefruit pith, almost a sweet tart combination. There's also coriander and clove spiciness, plus a hint of funk in the yeast aroma. Big fruitiness in the flavour too, and the acidity really brings this out. There's plenty of citrus, but more like the peel and pulp rather than juice, as well as a pleasant pear flavour that's more apparent as it warmed. Sweetness is tamed by the tartness, leaving a dry finish. Spices add some depth around the middle and linger along with the citrus character. Yeast is masked, as is most of the funkiness, but a little bit of bread, grass, and earthiness peek through. Lively carbonation with a creamy texture. This is really tasty stuff. I enjoy the style overall and this is a great example of a saison. The only thing that impacts the drinkability for me is the dryness - it's fairly aggressive after a while, but still very nice."
"Pours golden in color with a bit of an orange sunset hue and a pillowy bright white head. Nose is fruity with notes of lemon zest, ripe apples, and apricots, and a bit of spice. The taste has several layers of complex flavor. Theres some sweet candied sugar, some fruity notes of apple that become more pronounced as the beer warms, a spiciness of clove and white pepper, and a bit of an earthy yeastiness all blended together perfectly. A marvelous beer that I wish was available locally."
"Over the years, I have rarely had a Fantome Saison that came close to the old label vintages in the mid '00's. Yesterday we shared a ""new label"" batch, and it tasted like sweet tea, smoke, and ""pears rolled in dirt"". Probably would rate it a 3.5-3.6. Very disjointed and nothing at all like the ""old"" Fantome. Around 2010-11 I had one that just tasted very plain and grainy with no fruit esters, spice or anything. It's always hit or miss, and lately it's been more in the ""miss"" category unfortunately."
"Semi-dry and lightly carbonated  almost Champaign style. No problem enjoying the 750ml, there is NO alcohol in this. Oops, by the end of the bottle the 8% is kickin ass."
"Evil me, I even drank from the bottle for a moment, like it was PBR at a crawfish boil. I regained my composure to admire the closing moments of this fine saison. I highly suggest this beer for anyone looking for a true marker of saison."
"For me, it's a very different but enjoyable brew that I will definitely drink again."
"note: i liked this beer, but it didn't conform to my expectations of a ""saison"" which I suppose is the mold set by Dupont. it was much thicker than I thought it would be when I was in the mood for a very dry, crisp beer and this wasn't that. just a warning for others, this is more a spring than summer beer, dig?"
"This beer is a bit too sweet for me, a bit too light on the hops, and not enough malt flavor for my liking. But, for a saison it is a very quality brew. Recommended."
"Gold color  white thin head - sweet/sour apple, wheat , sea smell sharp nose - wonderful sour green apples, as well as sweet red apples well balanced  light fluffy body  aftertaste slightly bitter with black olives Gold color  white thin head - sweet/sour apple, wheat , sea smell sharp nose - wonderful sour green apples, as well as sweet red apples well balanced  light fluffy body  aftertaste slightly bitter with black olives Gold color  white thin head - sweet/sour apple, wheat , sea smell sharp nose - wonderful sour green apples, as well as sweet red apples well balanced  light fluffy body  aftertaste slightly bitter with black olives"
"75 cl. bottle. Cloudy golden colour with a creamy head that fades quickly. Aroma is scaring at first: barnyard, horse leather, a damp musky place. Later you can find fruits, honey, floral, and spices. Flavor is pungent, sour. Acid, citrus,. It reminds me of cava. Fruity, orange, pepper and some other spice. Great beer."
"Pours hazy dark gold, with a big-bubbled one finger head. I can smell tart green apples, freshly cut grass, and a bit of barnyard. Tasting it, there are more nuances. Everyone who tasted it noticed a buttery flavor. Along with this are the grass and apple flavors, although the former is less pronounced than in the nose. This all recedes to a nice sweet and sour malt taste. Pouring in all of the yeast mellows the taste and makes it somewhat earthier. It's medium-bodied, mouth coating, with good tingly carbonation. I've had a number of Fantomes, and the variety in just this style astounds me. A whole 750 is never enough!"
"Drinkability: What can I say? This beer is executedly perfectly, balanced and delicious. I must try more from this brewery, just great."
"Pours brilliant gold, hazy with yeast, with a bone-white head that sticks tenaciously to the top of the liquid and to the side of my glass. Aroma is funky, funky, funky. Under the barynard funk lay apples, pears, candi sugar, anise, and some other spices I can't put my finger on. Very complex aroma. Initial sweetness on the palate is met by hop bitterness, tight spices, and then significant funk that lasts through the finish. Citrus tartness presents itself just before the hops kick in. Mouthfeel is on the thick side of medium, with plenty of mouth coating ability, refined-but-full carbonation and enough residual sugars to make this beer roll about the mouth with ease. Overall, a wonderfully funky saison, with plenty of complexity to interest the mind and straightforward deliciousness to interest the stomach."
"Corked and capped 750 ml. Looks nice. Pours a hazy gold, huge white head forms, tons of lace, and great retention. Smell is like what the fuck! All over the place and funkier than 70's porn music. Some hay, citrus, almost skunk, vanilla sweetness, and orange, some yeast too. Taste is sweet, hay, spices, sugar through the middle, funky tang finish, lots of spicy bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium to high carbonation, very dry finish. This stuff is amazing. I wish I had a life supply."
"Served from a 750 ml bottle. Not sure what the vintage is. The beer poured a hazy straw color with a thick active off white head that stuck around for awhile and gave good lacing down the sides of the glass. The aroma was earthy and spicey. The taste is fruity and spicey at the same time and a bit funky to boot. Just what you would expect from the folks at Fantome. This beer is very easy to drink with a good carbonated body and mouthfeel."
"Highly, highly, highly recommended. The gold standard of saisons."
"Brilliantly complex flavor. Sweet citrus peel flavors, and very sharp, well spiced. Light-medium body, strong carbonation. Yeast pour smooths things out. A yummy beer, for sure, though I think I enjoyed Saison Dupont better. Next up, La Chouffe, Moinette, and revisiting Hennepin."
"Only just short of a perfect beer, but perfect for the style, and easily in my all-time pantheon of beers... the more saisons I drink the more I appreciate this beauty."
"Drinkablity was OK...we split a 750ml...that was enough for me."
"intriguing and well-balanced."
"Drinkability: A very intriguing concoction by one of my favorite breweries; top notch"
"Not bad but I think I need to try a fresher bottle."
"Not as dry as expected...but a classic saison nonetheless."
"D - Hugely drinkable. A very tasty example of a saison."
"Very tasty."
"I thought the tartness took a few sips to get used to. Otherwise, this is a great well balanced Belgian beer."
"Medium body who is quite fruity, refreshing, the hops come in and tickle you with aromas of apple and banana. then the malt comes in and surounds you with a shy alcohol warmness which ends up on spices and very shy notes of complex flavors."
"Drinkability: the wife and I could have drank several bottles of this. Full flavored and satisfies the tastebuds. A must buy if you see it."
"Thanks to goodbyeohio for the trade."
"An absolutely fantastic beer, one to savor not just belt back. I'd love to try pairing this with a few different cheeses. An absolutely wonderful brew"
"No date on the cork or 750ml bottle. Appears a cloudy golden yellow with a tight eggshell colored head that leaves small dashes of lace around the glass. Great funky nose is packed with plenty of farmy barn notes. Sweet fruit notes blend with spices and a light hoppiness. Awesome aroma with all the funk you would expect from a Fantome saison. Lightly sweet fruit flavor with a mix of funk and spiciness come on strong. Nice crisp bitter floral hops mix in well and contrast with the slight tartness thats present. Pretty much everything I would look for in the flavor, a perfect example in my book. Smooth, crisp mouthfeel that I found refreshing. Drinkability doesnt get any better than this for the style. A must try for any Saison fan."
"D - Not a bad Saison, but for the money, there are better options."
"Mouthfeel- Pretty puckery. Not too say my mouth puckered whilst drinking this beer. But it was tarter than I expected. Almost cloying."
"PS: Now, when I think Saison, I think Fantôme."
"So, this is my 100th review... 750 ml corked and capped bottle with a ghost and the default description of their brewery on the label. If the head, which started out big and frothy, were to have stuck around a little while longer (it faded to thin lacing after a couple of minutes) this would get a perfect score. There is a good bit of yeast floating around in this beer's apricot body. I don't think I can pick out all of the different aromas. I'm detecting peach, grapefruit, lemon, orange, pear, pepper, herbs, Belgian yeast, and funk. Every Fantôme I've ever tasted has been delectable- the Chocolat that didn't taste like chocolate was the only one that wasn't amazing. The spicy bitterness, the fruity sweetness, the tart fruitiness, the funk, the floral notes- this is unbelievably delicious and it's very refreshing even though it has a dry mouthfeel. Totally worth the $12."
"Overall this is a nice Saison. As they're all different, you'll just have to try this one and see what you think. It's a lot more earthy and musty than Ommegang's top-rated brew. But I feel this has a more ""authentic"" flavor to it."
"M&D: an evolving mouthfeel from astringent to smooth, with the help of constantly fine and creamy fizz against a dryish-sour palate... this medium-bodied heavy-weight treads lightly, almost ideal as a thirst-quencher, like some semi-dry sparkling wines. It's hardly my choice for a ""session"" Saison, for which I prefer a rounder and slightly sweeter version, but this one really is hellu'va distinct beer to savour. To me it's a must-try, and something I'd love to go back to whenever given a chance~~"
"A new favorite of mine."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable but not a perfect 5 due to the higher ABV and slightly abrasive spiciness. Still, an excellent beer. I'd love to try it cellared."
"The taste too, has a citrus flavor but well balanced with sour notes and apple tang. a hint of coriander and clove fill it out. The body is light and refreshing, the 750 mL split between us two, was not enough. We were sad to see it go."
"Really a fantastic saison. One of the fruitier ones out there for sure, but one I wouldn't hesitate having again."
"Damn good. Damn drinkable. Lingers on the palate forever with its pleasant blend of spices. None of that belgian funky horseblanket stuff here, just a hell of a beer. I could forsee the inital taste becoming a little bit cloying by the end of the 750, but if there is no edit below, assume not."
"This is balanced nicely with the fruitiness with the yeast qualities and dryness. Each sip is complex and interesting. Alcohol is not evident. Quite nice overall."
"Recent bottles have really showed Dany Prignons inconsistent brewing. Fantome Saison is really only a 4.7 20-25% of the time. Sometimes it is bone dry and sour and sometimes it is very sweet. So I am lowering my score for now, until I have a bottle that shocks me again."
"After a bit of struggling, the cork releases with a resounding POP! Poured into my Ommegang cervoise. Shimmering gold with several hundred suspended particulates and a fluffy eggshell white head. Incredible aromas: mown hay, fresh strawberries, slight rubbery phenols, apple cider. Phenolic flavors surround a mouthfull of fruit: the aforementioned strawberries, tannic green grape skins, apple juice spiked with powdered ginger. Fine grassy hop bite at the finish. Clean, crisp mouthfeel; dry, despite the fruit-inflected sweetness. Less carbonation than perhaps I'd prefer. Medium-thin body. Sweeter than I prefer for a regular drinking choice, but a masterful saison all the same."
"Served in a snifter. Nearly a one-inch head with good retention and amazing lacing. Color is a light golden orange, very cloudy. Notes of orange peel, spicy clove, and a candy aroma reminiscent of PEZ present in the smell. The taste is a complex mix of earthy, citrus, clove, honey, spicy malt, with a slight sour/bitterness toward the finish. Alcohol is not very noticible. Mouthfeel is nice, a medium body that coats the palate nicely and has medium carbonation. Drinkability is solid. A nice mix of unique malt flavor, this is a great saison..."
"750 ml bottle, pours a glowing gold, slight haze, a finger of bright white head, decent retention and lacing. Nose is extremely yeasty, slightly funky, a little must, apple, spice, slightest bit of sour vinegar, complex and interesting. Taste is yeasty doughy goodness, slight bit of pear/mango/apple fruit, strong spices, clove, coriander, pepper, slightly tart lemony finish, overall a very nice refreshing saison. Medium bodied, highly carbonated, nicely effervescent,this is an easy drinking beer. This was my first Fantome, and it was really a great one."
"Drinkability: even this seemingly off sample is highly drinkable. Ill try again and rereview at the next opportunity. I expect positive results."
"FOLLOW UP: I didn't finish the 750 in one night (so much for drinkability) and so I had the last bit this evening. Lots of chewy brown yeast bits stuck between my teeth, and overall I can say I like this beer, but it's a strange beer. Much harder to get my arms around that other saisons that I may have rated lower. This one is more complex, more interesting, and in some ways, I really like this beer. But it's not as easy to enjoy as some others. Ratings revised accordingly."
"drinkability: i wished i had another on hand."
"The Beer Gods are clearly smiling upon Brasserie Fantome and all who imbibe their fine ales."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. This saison is light and refreshing, providing a great ale for those lazy hazy summer days (or mid-50 degree post-Christmas, pre-New Years December days)."
"D- I found a wonderful fizzy yellow beer. This as very subtle complexity and it is hard to pull out specific flavors. Even though it is 8% ABV it is very smooth and light. The sourness is not overpowering but compliments the fruity hints and the bitterness."
"the taste, sour but sweet with fruity flavors all over the place, orange, strawberry, lemon, peach, apple, and probably others. a subtle spicy effect is also noticable most notably a peppery. there are hints of clove and corriander that sorts of lends a drying effect. the strawberry flavor develops some strength as the beer warms. it feels thicker than it might actually be with a slightly oily feeling in the mouth. light airy carbonation cleans things up perfectly. very drinkable and delicious. an excellent saison, that really puts other examples of the style to shame, at least the others i've had."
"This brew pours a cloudy dark orange color. The head is massive, fluffy and white, and recedes slowly. The aroma is of oranges, not orange peel like you would find in a hefe wiezen, but actual oranges. Spices and tartness are also present in the aroma, but are rather mild. The sip is yeast and dry, transitioning into a juicy orange finish, which quickly reverts back into a dry yeasty aftertaste. The mouthfeel is a tad lighter than medium bodied. Overall, this is a very nice brew. It is flavorful and complex without being in your face, which is always a plus in my book."
"Taste: Carbonation nice and lively, it gave this Beer a nice citrucy pop, with bread flavors, a strange hop profile (my guess is he uses spent hops) and the finish is yeasty and bitter like banana peels. very nice stuff!"
"This bottle had been in the cellar for at least a year. I did not notice any evolution: good or bad. Ooohhh that smell, that smell of saison around you. The aroma is exactly what I've come to expect froma top-notch saison: yeasty, orange, herbs, strawberry. This beer poured an average, frothy head with excellent lacing. The body was murky with lots of small yeast particles (emptied the entire bottle). The body was amber. The initial flavor is sweet and heavy with a moderately sweet, average length finished. Mouthfeel was lively and dry. One of my favorite saisons."
"750 ml bottle, corked and capped. This beer pours out a brilliant hazy orange color with a white head. The aroma is yeast, orange, coriander, and strawberry. Slightly tart flavor at first, then turns fruity, with strawberry, grape, orange, and lemon. This is the only beer I've ever had that tasted like strawberry. A bit musty. Finishes dry. Drinkability is outstanding. This beer is expensive - I paid $10 for this bottle - but it's one of my all time favorite beers."
"I picked up a bottle of this ""Saison"" beer shortly after Georgia began allowing the importation of higher alcohol content beers. The bottle was green glass with a cork and a metal cap. There was a rather simple label with the image of a ghost. This beer was rich and full of character. Lingering notes of rustic herbal flavours throughout. Citrus flavours abounded with hints of musty earth, the beer was well carbonated. Some bits of sediment lingered near the bottom of the bottle. I was not able to really make out the colour of this ale as I drank it directly from its bottle. Needless to say, it made quite an impression on me."
"The drinkability is about right. Sessionable to a point as its ABV and carbonation catches up to ya. Nice berry burps. A tender, mild treat thats got lots of things going for it. Complicated yet simple and delicately natured. A fun beer. Don't pass it up. Recommended."
" This is what I would want after mowing the lawn on a hot summer day. Forget the supposed 8% ABV. I'm not noticing it. As I progress through the glass, the sour, funky notes become just slightly more noticeable."
"There couldn't be a greater disparity between what I would describe as my perfect beer and the beer sitting before me. That makes it all the more amazing that I like it as much as I do. It just goes to show what dedication, daring and a considerable amount of skill can accomplish. I love having my horizons expanded, so I couldn't be more thrilled that Fantome Saison has blown them wide open."
"This is a very well-conceived and made concoction!"
"I really like to see and smell a pour and this one was near perfect. A funky nose on this golden hazy ale gave you a hint of what was to come. The first taste was that of a strawberry lambic  like the Hanssens Oudbeitje. As it warms slightly, there are a number of great fruit flavors kiwi, honey dew and strawberry all in a slightly funky world class ale. This is so good and easy to drink, setting the standard for the style -great depth of flavors, crisp clean and refreshing and enough alcohol to put a smile on your face."
"750 ml corked and capped bottle. My first blog review, all others were different serving variations."
"Overall: Wow. Just incredible. Best saison I've had."
"This beer is extremely drinkable. The alcohol is nowhere to be found and the taste is both refreshing and complex."
"Drinkability... hell, I'd go for it again easily, were the price a little lower."
"That was it for me. I just couldn't get past the smell, but I still was intrigued. I will revisit this some day. Strictly because of the smell, this Fantome was a bit too funky for me."
"Wow, great brew! I like Saisons, and this one is exceptional. Hazy, near copper yellow hued with a decent cap of foam that didn't last quite as long as I'd like. Aroma was a bit muted, but stillenticing. Malty sweetness and a bit of funky yeast behing a fruity, floral scent. Taste is amazing. Fruity, tart, sour, a touch of sweetness and a hint of grainy malt. I could drink this all night, 8% or not."
"This saison drinks like a light wine; a pinot grigio or sauvignon blanc; not in terms of flavor, but re: the alcohol presence. A classic for the style, and one that I will continue to share with friends."
"Perhaps the Godfather of all Saisons, this beer never disappoints. As soon as the bottle is un-corked, a steady flow of carbonated beer flows from the neck of the bottle and seemingly never lets up. As the beer is decanted into the snifter, it releases a dull, rusty, hazy peach color and a film of foam sustains itself atop the beer. Active carbonation puts on quite a show. Good aromas of floral, spicy, and tart. Flavors of oranges, peaches, lemons, and pears. Spiciness of cinnemon, corriander, curraco, and pepper. Vineous and almost wine-like. Remaining tartness that doesn't become astringent or sour. Tartness weaves into out out of the fresh spicy hop bitterness and flavor. Light malt with wheat sweetness and texture give a much needed breadiness and creaminess. Soft texture that is slightly scrubbed. Medium body. Dry finish with mild phenolic alcohols throughout. Well balanced and easy drinking. Generally, I can expect Saisons to show a bit more sweetness but this one is as dry as a bone."
"Drinkability: Oh dear lord, back up a tanker to my house and turn on the hose. This is what beer drinking is all about. One of the most drinkable saisons -- if not beers, period -- I've yet encountered. Scary good."
"Poured a very cloudy golden color with very little head and no lace. Aroma of citrus, yeast, herb and earthiness. It had a very complex flavor, including a smorgasbord of fruits and a slight spicyness that I really liked. A slightly bitter (citrus wise) comes through in the end as well. Smooth and crisp, slightly juicy."
"Overall, this saison by Brasserie Fantôme is one of the best I've had, period, full stop. Highly drinkable, with an aroma that simply kicks ass, and a complexity that just begs you to keep on sippin'. Fantôme Saison went very well with the seasoned ahi tuna and seasoned noodles I had for dinner. A definitive example of the style; a beer any beer enthusiast should be seeking out if they want to experience a first-rate saison."
"On the tasting I was hit with an overpowering coriander and citrus zest. I can taste the superior craft in this beer, but wit the spice in it, you might as well add a lemon to a hefe weisen and call it even. The mouth feel is light and nice with a silk finish. If you like heady HW's, then go for it."
"Conclusion: This brew is both everything and nothing. It's just how you interpret the tastes and aroma's. For me personally though the huge 'barnyard' aspect was a bit too much. 'Artisanaal' is ok, but this was too much. One thing's for sure though: it's got character aplenty."
"Had this on-tap at Roman's Pub. This beer doesn't look like much, a cloudy golden color, not much more attractive than the Spotted Cow I'm used to drinking, which is to say, pretty mundane. The smell and the taste though--amazing! The best smelling/tasting beer I've ever had. Smells very much like tropical fruit and bubblegum, with a little bit of sourness in the mix as well. It's a very sweet smell, but somehow not cloying in any way; in fact, it's downright alluring. Tastes initially lemon peels, citrusy and sour, with a sweet bubblegum finish. Again, I can't explain it--you would naturally think that a bubblegum beer would be awful, sweet to the point of undrinkable, but this was not. It was perfectly balanced by the very pleasant sourness, and had a very nice, dry mouthfeel. Fucking amazing beer."
"Very enjoyable"
"Cheers."
"I'm going to drop another $10 and give this one more shot as I will admit this isn't a style that I get into, and this could have been a bad bottle."
"The envelope has been pushed until breaking. Damn fine."
"Carbonation is low-medium, which suits the style perfectly. As it begins to warm, lemony, citrus, woody flavors make themselves known. This thing (!) is growing on me (!)."
"Peach in colour with lots of carbonation. Fantastically fruity and yeasty in both the nose and the mouth. There are minor notes of barnyard, and various spices which enhances my overall impression of this beer. Light and refreshing on the palate, without compromising its complexity. Highly drinkable stuff. It's just too bad I can't get this locally."
"Drinkability is good wouldn't mind having this again if I could find it. A nice brew hope it represents this style because I will be looking for Saisons in the future. Thanks go to merlin48 for sharing this with me."
"Pours a brilliant gold color. Looks beautiful in the glass with a white small dense head. The gold really stands out. Smell is grassy, orange? FIrst sip reveals a sour tasting beer. Hints of orange in the aftertaste. Kind of like an orange sweettart. Slightly acidic. Pretty drinkable stuff. A few sips in reveals a slight peppery taste. This aspect is pretty mild. Moslty sour citrusy taste. Taste rings on the tongue leaving a slightly malty aftertaste. This is good."
"Drinkability: I'm becoming a big fan of Saisons, and this one sets a nice standard for the style. I've been keeping a small stash of Ommegang Hennepin on hand to slake my desire for this style, but an excellent Belgian Saison like this one is a special treat. Truly exceptional drinkability. I love grazing in the meadow with sheep, taking in the grassy, herbal, floral, and funky earthiness that is contained in a bottle like this one. The citrusy lemon character really adds an inviting component to the drinkability. Nice and dry, with a long finish. Lovely!"
"750mL corked and capped bottle poured into a chalice."
"This beer pours an extremely carbonated bright hazy orange juice looking color. Huge frothy head is controllable on the pour but barely. Tons and tons of lacing. Aroma is of musty yeasty funkiness I come to expect in good saisons. There's also fruits and spices involved with the yeast. Granny smith apples along with more tropical fruits then some anise. I'm getting some freshly cut grass in there as well. Taste brings more fruityness upfront. Really fresh whole strawberries and watermelons. More of a floral element comes in with a garden vegetable taste. Yeasty depth underneath. Spritzy in the feel. I'm tasting the carbonation a bit. Finish is dry and holds well. This could be confused for many other styles and to me is reminiscent of champagne. Whatever, the complexity and depth of flavors in this beer make it truly a great beer."
"There's an immediate taste of horse leather (recently worn). It's surprisingly dry, for recently worn horse leather!! This must have been stirred by a horse with sugar on it's hoof, and horehound, mint and miner's lettuce on it's breath. Wild!! Man, it's crisp and refreshing overall, with funky burps. It's quenching and interesting, and does't seem anywhere close to 8%. It gets drier as I progress down the bottle, but there's just enough sweetness to keep drinking. This is complicated enough to keep talking about, but hey, it's fantastic. It is now my goal to drink every Fantome beer I can get my lips on, and I'll steal yours if you're not watching."
"It smells like there's noble hops in here. Light pepper and spice hints come through in the smell, and it goes along very well with the other characteristics of the style. The taste brings excellent combinations of fruit, spice, and malt in different layers. The mouthfeel is brilliant and drinkability is outstanding."
"The beer poured into an oversize wine glass a bright gold, very hazy with a thick white head that receded quickly into the glass. The smell has bread dough, grapefruit, and a couple of layers of spice. The finish on the nose has more orange than grapefruit. The taste has a pleasant tanginess up front delivered in the form of the citrus. The spiciness I detected in the aroma blends into sweetness delivered by the malt. The yeast/bread dough character disperses all together in the flavor. Finish has a mild peppery bite that lingers and blends with the alcohol to generate a little heat. The mouth feel is light and slick and helps to produce a decent drinakbility."
"Notes: The best saison I've ever had. Its a lot more balanced that other saisons that I have had, just perfectly blended malt, hops, spices, and funky yeast. Amazingly drinkable, even though its warmed up way past it serving temperature. So light I could drink this on a hot summers day. The 8% ABV not detectable in the smell and taste. This beer is truly ethereal."
"Last swigs: 8.0 % ABV is masked and cloaked. Skunky socks good. 99/4.31"
"Enjoyed as a 4oz sample at the Belgian Beer Fest 2004. An excellent beer. Pours a very bright gold, with lots of particulate yeast. Taste is excellent for the style, light and smooth, with citrus undertones and lots of malt. Very spicy aftertaste. Lots to like here. Fun to drink, an excellent saison."
"Mouthfeel is light and airy with a small bubbly carbonation. Goes down so well. Such a drinkable beer here...I could drink it all night. Highly recommended. I will be buying a bottle as soon as possible!"
"(how can anybody drink Middle of the road brew after sampling this nectar of the gods??)"
"Give it a few months to mature still."
"Drinkability: Mild and well balanced."
"And a quick note: I want to thank the Alström Bros. and all the members here at BA. We have a wonderful thing going here. You've all helped me discover things I never would have on my own. This is my 200th review, and 190 of the beers I reviewed so far I never would have tried if it weren't for everyone of you out there. Thanks guys, you rock."
"Pours a peach-tinged straw color with lots of carbonation and a huge frothy white head that leaves quite a bit of film and lace. Smells of peppery spices with sweetly floral tones, yeast, and a bit of horse-blanket sourness. Flavors are a delicate intermingling of peppery spice, floral notes, and strong finishing dry sourness. The tastes are very well balanced and remain interesting all the way through the bottle. Excellent champagne-like mouth-feel. Quite light and drinkable to the last drop."
"Your senses resonate with Fantome. Spun lavender candy aromas spring from a pillow capped rousing yellow. Immediately dry and tart and lush, a childhood memory inducing drug that will keep your brain dancing while there is still liquid left in the glass. It's difficult to believe a high percentage of alcohol when a bottle drains so quick. Required drinking for anyone that says they like beer."
"Drinkability: Best thing about this brew (in my opinion) is that it's a great warmer. Between the large bottle, the bittersweet taste, and 8% ABV, this beer is definitely something to enjoy. I shared it with a friend but could have easily drank this myself (and almost wish I would have)."
"Hazy, pale golden color. Thick white fluffy head. Decent head retention. Good lace on the sides of the glass. Notes of citrus, earth, leather, and must. Pale malt flavor combined with a sharp sourness, some pepper spices, and funkyness. Light body, high carbonation. Very complex, lots of very interesting flavors here that work together very well. Even with all of the complexity, very easy to drink. Very unique and tasty. I will certainly seek more of the Fantome!"
"One of the bottles tasted at our Greensboro tasting Saturday,poured a hazy yellow with some orange tint with a nice fluffy/sticky head.Very lemony aroma it really jumped out up front along with a clovey spiciness,alot of refreshing flavors going on alot of citrus,lemons and orange mainly but I also detected some green apple as well along with some pepper but not nearly as peppery as some others of the style.A top notch saison thanks to the mother in law for bringing it down here for me so I could share it with others."
"A hazy straw yellow with a huge billowy white head, consistantly beautiful all the way through. Smells of strawberries and lemons, spicy and very tart, dandelions and crabgrass. Flavor is of citrus, peppermint, and ginger. Finishes dry with lime and lingering spices. Highly carbonated yet not harsh - just alive. Whipped heavy cream. This is cool, complex, and funky."
"Drinkability- I had a nice beerfest yesterday while watching the first playoff football games and consumed about 6 bombers with other BA member Spinlock. Fortunately it was my first beer that I had, so it was clear that I really enjoyed it, but when I woke up this morning I couldn't stop thinking about this beer and had to buy another today and try it to really give a 100% acurate rating. I was thinking of giving it straight 5's (that would have been a first for me), but wavered a bit on the appearance and the mouthfeel. Overall it's an incredible beer that I will be having many more times in my future. I am getting married in September and am narrowing down my list of beers to bring with me. This will be one of them and it may very well be the one on the main table getting consumed as everyone toasts at my wedding. It's not an everyday beer though. This to me is a special occasion beer. This falls in the same category of Stone RIS for me. It's too good to have for just any random beer craving. A most awesome crafted beer that has gained a big spot in my heart. Worth $10?? Hell yes. If any of you are wine lovers, take this into consideration. A great bottle of wine will run you typically at least $30-40 minimum. This is a truly great beer and runs you $10 on average if you can find it. This is worth the money. Seek it, buy it, drink it and savor it."
"Had this on tap at Rich O's Public House. Pours a cloudy cloudy orange color with a tall white head that had great retention and left nice lacing - in a Fantome tulip glass. The aroma was big. Lots of orange, lemon, spice, pepper, with that strange funky smell that Fantome is known for. Very nice. The flavor was very complex. Lots of orange and lemon with some spices. The carbonation has a great presence in the flavor. Easy to drink and perfect on the body. Wonderful brew."
"Fantome Saison off tap. How can I pass this one up. I've had it out of a bottle before, but this was a superb beer experience. The sweet nectar was poured off tap into a Fantome tulip glass. The beer was a beautiful oranged yellow color wtih a thick billowing head over top that didn't want to fall for anything. What a nose. Lemon, acid, slight pepper, grapefruity citrus. Damn. All I can say. Nirvana. The nose was great...the flavor was perfection. There is an underlying mandarin orange sweetness that is overlayed with huge lemony citrus acidity and peppery notes. There is a whole lot more going on in there, but I couldn't put pen to paper and give it justice. Suffice to say it was orgasmic. The feel was right below moderate, exactly where it should be. My only issue was that I was drinking it in the dead of winter, when I thoguht it should be a summer brew. The drinkability is second to none. I could have parked my glass under the tap all night and just drank this. If I ever find it, I will be forced to see if I can get a keg for home. I will actively seek this beer out whenever I can."
"I'm very glad I finally tried this. What a unique brew! The prominent aroma and flavor I detected was apples (but not overdone, like the ephemere). Huge, spritzy head. Foam and lacing right to the last drop. High carbonation, but not enough to detract. Quenching, and great with the veal and white eggplant with garlic that we had for dinner (my wife loved it also). I followed with one of my favorites (Hennepin), and the Fantome was better. Can't wait to get more!"
"Fantastically eye-opening."
"So I've just gotten really into Fantome and when I first tried it I really had no idea what I was getting into. Reading the above review is interesting. I just had the saison again last night and I taste so much more in it. SO good. Complex. A bit funky and horsey, refreshing, zesty, even a little sour. Nice and spicey, peppery, and yeasty. Love that sour kick too. My girlfriend loved it too, so much that she kept talking about it today. She never does that. I'm just glad that I can appreciate a beer like this when apparently I used to think ""it could use a little more punch."" Nah, the subtleties are where it's at for this beer. Nothing gets in the way or takes over and that's what makes all the tastes come together so beautifully. Yum."
"Lemony coriander aroma that's a bity spicy and earthy. Fluffy bright white head with a shiny mousse textured top leaves scattered noodles of lace. Hazy straw colored beer with streams of small bubbles rising slowly from the bottom. Lemony flavor is almost sour, but the beer remains fairly dry. A mild spicyness floats in midway followed by a mellow earthiness in the finish, which is even stronger with a burb. Nice solid body is light enough that it goes down easy yet thick enough to carry all those flavors. Lots of interesting mellow spices, and an underlying yeasty earthiness to this beer that make for a truely interesting beer. It's like there's something new every sip. I think I get the ""horse blanket"" thing, but I might take a drive out to the country tomorrow just to make sure."
"Has anyone else had experience with trying to get some distance out of a large bottle?"
"It pours a light tan color with a soft white head. It's cloudy as heck. Then it gets murky with the sediment at the end. The aroma is slightly floral but mild, and does not improve with warming. Carbonation is moderate. On tasting, I get a relatively harsh bitterness of neutral hops. There seems to be some spiciness. Perhaps a bit of fruit. Very cluttered and confusing to me. Surprisingly there is a pretty clean malt flavor that surges near the end. Medium bodied. Alcohol is subtle but the effects are felt later. Overall: I need to try this again sometime, but not too soon -- I tried the beer over a long time, at various temperatures, but the harsh bitterness is out of balance. Like a bad american lager recipe with a tiny bit of spices added."
"And...hmmmm, Lordy, I love it...fresh, yeasty, citric, fruity, tasty, full of deliciousness...so tasty...light to medium in body, very fresh, and zesty, tastiness personified...what a jewel, just juicy and nice..yum, yum, double yum...wow, this is a magnificent saison, I'd like to keep this in the fridge at all times, at moment's notice, ...dee-ee-licious!"
"ng"
"Be careful. This stuff tastes like a beer with half the alcohol. It's hard to believe that this light, fruity brew is 8 percent alcohol."
"On tap at Spuyten Duyvil: Very different. Incredible opportunity. Highly fruity, barnyardy with big mango and bubblegum flavors, blue cheese notes, lychee, lime. Decadent scary cloudy appearance, yellow at the top, brownish at the bottom, dirty, shadowy. Very creamy milk-shake mouthfeel."
"750ml bottle: Sampled at the CTRiver Brewers Festival. This one poured a dark straw/golden color. There was a huge white head to it tht takes awhile to die down. The first thing that hits you from the aroma is peaches. Also a bit of wheat ot the nose. This beer tastes fantastic. The tastte is dry, spicy, wheaty, and those peaches are there again, but the dont dominate nor are they sweet. A lovely beer!"
"Half the bottle is gone before I know it. I could drink this all night long! Addicting!"
"Foam gushes out of the 750 as I pop the cork. Ooo, this is gonna be good! Pours a slightly cloudy gold-yellow color with three fingers of head. There is a good amount of lacing left on the glass. The smell is sweet with apples and has a bit of spice to it as well. A very powerful aroma that is intoxicating. I could sniff this all night! The taste is also full of malt and spices. A little bit of pepper dances on the tongue with hints of granny smith apples. The mouthfeel is nice and heavy, yet smooth. The drinkability is awesome for an 8% brew! Oh man, I can't wait to get more of this one!"
"Nice hazy gold with a thick, bone white head. Slightly sour nose, like a mild lambic. Some mild yeast tones. Myiad of flavors. Candy, spice(ginger?). Reminds me a bit of gummy bears. Sourness is not as prevelant as the nose you make it seem. Flavorful mouthfeel, but quite light and refreshing. Very yummy. Clean, crisp finish. I really like this beer. Can't wait to try this brewery's other offerings. A world class beer, IMO. This will become a regular beer in my selection. Highly recommended!!"
"Cloudy and hazy bright golden-orange color, huge frothy clingy off white head that leaves a sticky lacing in the glass that lasts, fruity citrus and yeasty aromas. Fruit and peppery spicy flavors with some sourness. Medium bodied with a crisp, carbonated mouthfeel, I can't believe the ABV is 8%, very drinkable."
"I had again at Mondial 2005 and it was much better. Big head!"
"If I had to choose one beer to drink forever, it could well be this."
"Pours with a one-finger head that fades to a ring leaving a good lace. Cloudy amber color, a lot of yeast left in the bottle. Good carbonation. Nose is floral and spice. Starts as sour orange with yeasty overtones. Finishes crisp and tart. $8.55 for a 750ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Definitly a must drink again."
"Pours from the 750ml bottle an extremely hazy light yellow with an average-sized bubbly head - significantly lighter in color than I had anticipated. Huge aroma of sweet fruits (strawberry, apple, apricot) & mild spice mixed with some hints of sour. Wonderfully smooth in the mouth with refined bitterness, citrus, honey, sweet oranges, and absolutely delicious spice. Finishes dry with a wisp of malt, lemon, and a touch of mint. Exquisite."
"This beer reminds me of an old world pastoral landscape. The phantoms of the past seem to spring from the glass with its earthy aroma and to the bone sourness. Color and faint aroma of cut hay helps the metaphor along, but the crisp mouthfeel and tart and dangerously refreshing sourness awake us into the present. The sourness is melded with sweetness, hints of lemon and berry, maybe rhubarb are permeated throughout the taste. Somehow complex yet accesssible. Defintiely the best of its class that I have tried thus far. Will probably be a summertime favorite as I think it would pair exceedingly well with grilled seafood. A yard worker's delight. Another plus for me is that my wife loves this beer as much as I, driving up the drinkablity to exceptional limits."
"notes: my first saison and there are lots of subtle flavors to be found in this, the carbonation and fruit flavors make it crisp and refreshing...the 8% means finishing the 750ml by yourself can take care of you for the evening, incredibly drinkable and i cant imagine the flavor not being liked by anyone"
"I must say, that's one chessy label. Luckily we don't judge a book by its cover. This bottle may have been a little older than usual, because I didn't get a huge head out of this beer, but the carbonation was lively in this beer so all was not lost. Poured out a hazy golden color with lots of yeast floating around everywhere. Lots of fruit hit the nose, apples, pears, grapes with some hints of yeast and spiceiness, just wonderful. Taste consisted of fruity notes mixed in with some peppery spiciness with a very tart-like finish, but everything was controlled nicely. Apples come into play for the aftertaste mixed in with some nutmeg type spice. It was tartful, but not over the edge. What a terrific brew."
"Mouthfeel is clean, smooth and surprisingly full in form. Not a big bodied beer, but it is far from thin. Easy to drink, as both flavor and aroma combine to make this experience one to remember. One bottle is enough to please, but a second is very tempting."
"Light to medium bodied, the ABV doesn't hide in this one either."
"Very complex."
"Such a unique beer! Every bottle has a character unto itself....I've heard people say it can be off at times, but when it's on, it's sheer brilliance! I've also had the draft, but the kegging kills the character quite a bit and turns it into almost a lambic more than a saison. I certainly would have this one again!"
"Salute--long love beer!"
"Paired with Rosemary/Thyme chicken and rice pilaf, this is one tasty beverage. Definitely a good wine replacement."
"This beer pours with a yellow, cloudy (maybe not left to its own for a few days), slightly rocky head which subsides to a skim. Little bubbles come up through the beer from the bottom of the glass. The smell is slight to me with a little lemon and no detectable alcohol.The taste is lemony, sweet, with a little malt always present, and very little bitterness except that contributed by a persistent apricot undertaste.The mouthfeel is like softened water with a slight prickle on the tongue. This reminds me of some mead homebrew that I once had. It's not the roller coaster of other Saisons. It's an 8% ABV beer that hides its strength with its fruitiness. I'll give it another walk as a food beer; probably pairing it with lemon chicken. As a session Saison it is somewhat boring. I can't help but compare it to DuPont which (in its Vieille Provision of 6.5%ABV ) is more of a strong session beer for me. Fantome is more refined, stronger, and more consistent from start to finish. This is actually a boring Saison by itself. I will edit this review after I've had another with food."
"This is eight percent abv? Unreal. While this isn't really a true saison due to its alcohol content, it certainly drinks like one. Truly unique and unbelievably delicious. Highly recommended."
"$6.99 for a 750ml"
"Overall Impression: Finally got around to tasting this one, Fantome's ""house beer"". Not sure how sour it should or shouldn't be. If this is a tainted bottle, then it is just starting to show the signs. Still a great saison and definitely a testament to what saisons are all about: rustic, complex, ever-changing, volatile. The great thing about this little brewery is that they can keep cranking out this artistic little gems even if most Belgians haven't even heard of them. I'd venture to guess that the US demand for Fantome beers is a large portion of thier market. It's a shame it's not more widely appreciated in Belgium."
"Pours a nicely colored hazy golden orange with a thick white head. Good healthy carbonation. Mixed aromatics; green apple, candied blood orange, mango, pineapple, white pepper, a smidge of pine, and yeasty righteousness- very impressive. Tastes light and airy, despite it's ABV. A bit of yeastiness shines through it all, along with the citrusy and tropical malt & yeast profile. Goes a little bit tart in the middle, but brings it back to the sweetness. Has a strange ""wet dog"" characteristic that only shows when sipping, not in the aroma (not offensive, however). Hops are there, but don't play that large of a role in this beer. I like this saison very much. Effervescent and crisp. Quintessential summer quaffer."
"Appearance: Color is a hazed golden orange with a nice sized white head after somewhat of a vigorous pour, as far as lacing it forms in even bands very nicely Belgian style lacing at that. Aroma: First thing is the pineapple juice aromatics that come out here awesome, a bit tart with mild alcohol notes in the background. Taste: Very clean and estery fruits light and fluffy tones the perfect summer ale, I definitely am amazed by the fruit tones this beer produces exotic tropical juice with some peppery notes with the yeast dregs added it takes on herbal tone with spices arising and grassy semi-musty tones it's very nice I'm a fan. Mouthfeel: Light to medium in body smooth effervescent carbonation has a creamy mouthfeel, I'm pleased with this offering definitely will track some down this summer. Drinkability: Incredible offering complexity light and refreshing along with some alcohol kick in there as well, very balanced an awesome Saison makes me want to track more brews down in this category."
"Even flat I am enjoying this beer. I need to buy another bottle to see the difference. I can tell that I would love this beer if it were carbonated."
"Well-carbonated to provide relief from the sour notes, and make it an excellent companion to a meal. Very drinkable."
"A very unique, unrestrained, natural flavor emerges immediately from this beer. Unripened pear, melon rind, and lemon peel bitterness. The finish seems to drop off into an almost unpleasant, raw bitterness. Slightly awkward but by no means bad. More unexpected, I think, than anything else. A superior brew."
"F"
"The feel is somewhat Champaign like with a sense of carbonation in each sip. Less full feeling and greatly crisp in the finish. Very drinkable despite the alcohol level which never beomes noticeable."
"I sampled this with spicy shrimp and thai rice noodles. It paired very well. The effervescence of the beer cleansed the palate and flavors helped to soothe the heat. Quite a delicious offering. My only problem was opening the bottle. The soft cork broke apart and I had to decant the beer before I could pour it into a glass. Not the worst of things, but certainly an inconvenience."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"Certainly one of the strangest (in a good way) beers I have tasted to date! First off, the beer poured an awesome, hazy, very unique color-a shade of very light caramel with some orange and golden hues. The aromatics were extremely complex with peach, citrus-orange and lemon-some spice, coriander perhaps? The aromatics were so very insidious it was hard to stop smelling and take a drink! In the mouth a lovely jolt of bright citrus, especially grapefruit zest, followed by some orange and lemon. The ever present bitter grapefruit zest component was very refreshing and unrelenting! As the beer warmed a bready/ fruitcake flavor surfaced and added to the flavor profile. I paired this with beer batter catfish, and a bit of leftover fried rice oddly enough. I used a simple belgian white-witekerke for the batter. This was a nice match, and I will say that I will search out, with celerity, my next brew from this brewery. Cool stuff here! Oh, how cool, this is my 50'th review!! One to remember."
"Light gold color. Medium head. Aroma is barnyard and yeasty. Medium body. Yeasty and somewhat barnyard-ish. Slightly sour. Well balanced. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Yet another nice Biere de Garde from Fantome, one of the funkeyist brewers on the planet."
"The cork almost blew by itself when I released the cage. When poured there was a huge rush of carbonation that continues to bubble. The color was a golden-orange with a thick tan head. It has a super fruity, medicinal aroma with the hay-like qualities of a lambic. It has just a really fresh smell. The aroma is more complex than any other Saisons I have had before. The flavor is fruity and medicinal with a different spiced flavor that I have never had before. It is light on the palate, but full and sneaky. This is a complex beer in aroma and flavor. A definite top notch beer in my opinion. Excellent."
"This beer was served to me a hazy lemon yellow color that when held to the light had a golden glimmer to it. The head was creamy and rich and the color of cloud white. It had the consistency of a sticky rich whipped cream. It lasted fairly long, ½ glass, then, eventually fell to a ring around the edges. It produced a sticky lace that clinged the sides of the glass and stretched almost the whole way to the finish. The aroma was of a giant fruit market, fresh fruits everywhere. I nosed bananas, pears, apples, sharp grapefruit, fresh melons, strawberries, sweet honey, floral hops (lite as it warmed), spices (cloves, pepper), and yeast. The aroma was alittle on the tart side but not sour, balanced nicely. Let’s just say that my friend who is a macro drinker loved the aroma. The tastes that came from the glass were just as pleasing as the nose if not more. Flavors of strawberries first hit me, then bananas, then a whole cornucopia of fresh and tart fruits, then spices (pepper, cloves), herbs, floral hops, some earthy flavors, yeast, tad wisp of alcohol, and a hint of a malt. Ends fruity with a hint of hop. Medium bodied. This is one smooth and complex beer. I would never expect so many flavors out of one little glass. This is one incredible beer, words cannot give it justice. One of the best beers that I have ever had. All I can say is that my senses thank the brewer for this beer/gift."
".Absolutely **First Class**!!!"
"Much props to Bighuge for this ghostly treat."
"This beer poured a cloudy light gold color and formed a small smooth white head that coated the glass with ring like lace as it subsided. A medium amount of carbonation is present. The aroma of this beer is amazing. It is hard to know where to begin. It is very floral, with aromas of green apple and various citrus smell with a background feel of standing out in an orchard. The flavor was of hops, citrus and some corinader. The finish was a medium body with a bit of sweetness to it, yet slightly tart with backing of the corinader creeping in. I have tried few saisons, but this looks to be a fine representative of the style."
"A unique, sooo-left-of-center version of the Saison style, this is an incredible beer. It would be great to give to people who think all beer is boring and tastes the same!"
"Overall an ale that screams summer on the farm. Farm fresh with no artificial anything in aroma or taste. Light, refreshing, an aroma to die for, and a taste that's a malty fruit salad with just the right amount of carbonation. This is what Saison's are all about."
"This is best described as an ""interesting"" brew and an ""interesting"" version of the style. Sadly, there are better examples of the style but they seem impossible to find here. Given the options, I guess it's worth getting (though, IMHO, it's quite over-priced)."
"It pours a hazy grapefruit color with plenty of yeast bits floating about. The head is a fizzy white that leaves traces around the edge of the glass after the initial fade. Swirling the glass brings the head back to life. The smell is on the fruity side, specifically apples and pear, with some tartness and a bit of that musty barnyard smell. The tartness is quite noticeable in the taste but certainly not overwhelming and, in fact, balanced nicely by the fruit flavors. The alcohol smell and taste blends in nicely and doesn't detract from the overall enjoyment of the beer. Good stuff."
"Maybe an adolescence spent sucking on Warheads and chewing crybabies killed my ability to perceive sourness, but I didn't think this was sour in the least. First pour was clear dark gold with nice white fluff. The second pour was cloudy. It seems hard to keep the yeast out of the bottle, but you might as well feed me yeast as much as I like yeast in my beer so that's not a problem. The dominant flavor and aroma is the estery fruitiness. Ripe plums, melons and bubblegum make for a soft, thick front. The middle is a mild bitterness and ends with a lingering crisp malt. Reminds me of spring. It has some of the same aromas I remember from the back yard of my parents' house beside the horse pasture with the Jonquil flowers and pecan trees. The horse blanket is there in the tiniest degree but I'd say it's more like the inside of the horse shed where the hay and horse feed dominate the smell of tackle. Not an earth-shattering experience but I like this."
"An apple juice colored brew on the first pour from this 750 ml bottle. What an appropriate color... A medium-sized but thick head forms on top, and retains well. Second pour: looks like an aquarium that hasn't been cleaned in months, even though I Ieft a good amount in the bottle. Floaties galore. If you don't like yeast sediment in your saison, leave quite a bit of this in the bottle. Wow, the aroma! Very unique and powerful. Super-tart sour apple and candi sugar, making it similar to a sour apple candy, like others have said. Some barn-like or ""horse blanket"" aromas are present as well. Spicy yeast undertones too, almost Christmasy. The taste, although very different from the aroma, is also unique and wonderful. First in at the front are malt and yeast characteristics. The maltiness is bready and caramelly. The yeast provides some spiciness and more of that sour apple and candi sugar, but it's much more subtle here on the palate. As the beer gets closer to the back, it gets more hoppy. That muted hoppiness that is present in many Belgian-style beers. You know what I'm talking about, right? Now I'm starting to think in musical terms describing this. You know what that means? It means that this is a damn good beer, and I love it, therefore it's influencing me to be more creative with my review. Anyway, back to the description. The tart fruitiness stays all the way through as an undertone. The mouthfeel is slightly chewy, almost sticky, which fits with the sour apple theme. Smooth and thick finish. This beer says ""why didn't you buy more bottles of me?"" to me. It's expensive, but it's definitely worth it. I may have to cheat and forget my rule of buying only beers I've never tried before next time I'm on a beer run. Give me more, now!"
"The beer was a haze orange-tinted gold with a fairly creamy white head. There was a very fruity, tart nose, like apple Jolly Ranchers with a little bit of farmhouse funk thrown in for good measure. This was an extremely delicious saison. It was fruity and tart, but not puckeringly so. For balance it was lightly hopped and had a noticeable pale malt sweetness. That sweetness is important to me in the flavor profile of a saison, and some beers have too much or too little. Goldie Locks thought this one was damn near perfect in terms of malt."
"Poured to give a hazy, straw-colored beer with thin white foam. The smell was very fruity: grapes and apples. The taste was of musty grapes, sweet but thin, with some maltiness in the finish. The mouthfeel was clean with modest carbonation, but the body was a bit thin. The drinkability was good."
"A caliginous golden orange color on the pour, the beer is loaded with dross, some on the bottom; some suspended throughout the beer. Head is immature in size, the color bright white, the consistency creamy and the left over lace a thick and sticky sheet to coat the glass. I would say one of the sweetest bouquets of any beer Ive sampled in years. Over ripe cantaloupe or cotton candy come to mind, malt underlies it all, a real treat for the olfactory senses, the front ambrosial, the top thick and sweet. Finish is sparsely carbonated, the hops apropos to the style, dry alcohol bitter lingering aftertaste and a satisfactory representative to the style. It is truly a shame that more Saisons are not available here in the states, as I find them intriguing and quite tasty to boot."
"403"
"Pours like champagne.  Big fizzy white head.  Reduces to a thin film in a minute.  Murky golden orange in color.  On the nose I get some bready tones, a blend of herbs and spices and yeast.  Pretty nicely carbonated mouthfeel.  Body is light.  Taste is unlike other Saisons I've had.  Very spicy and tart in the mouth, but not bad.  It kind of grows on you.  A little bit of an acidic tinge.  I get a sour apple like taste.  One that makes you pucker rather than wince.  (And unlike the sour apple associated with a ""green"" beer.)  I'm not sure what kind of spicing they use (if any), but maybe something like cinamon or bitter orange peel (curacao).  Interesting beer, but not something I'm going to shell out out $6 a bottle for."
"My first saison, so it's possible I will come back at some point and revise my score. Anyway, this is an amazing beer. Apple cider color, bubbly tan head. At first pour, the head is immense, and the incredible carbonation ensures that the head never goes away. In fact, the carbonation was almost volcanic in appearance; there were three separate mini-tempests in my glass from the eruption of bubbles rising through this brew. How to describe the smell? Imagine walking through an apple orchard in autumn while holding a ripe pineapple to your nose. Farm fragrances abound. The taste? Slices of green apples in apple cider, with a healthy amount of pepper and coriander. Spicy, earthy, intoxicating, complex. Oh yeah, this is the stuff of life."
"The turbid, light oranged hued brew is topped by a formidably thick, dense whipped cream like head that leaves intricate lace.  The luscious aroma is comprised of sweet apricot and peach fruit esters as the dominate components, w/ slightly tarter strawberry and citrus notes secondary. Subdued green apple acetaldehyde exists as an undertone in aroma.  Buttery malt becomes perceptible as the beer warms as well.  Bittersweet dried citrus peel is perceived initially, then yields to fructose - like sweetness mid - palate, while a combination of light sour dough breadiness and coriander round out the taste.  Curacao provides most of the bitterness in this brew, since hop bitterness is very mild.  Although highly carbonated, there's sufficient residual dextrins and protein for a relatively smooth mouthfeel.  Finishes quite clean, w/ peppery notes briefly lingering.  Fantome Saison is a highly enjoyable brew.  It's got tremendous complexity, yet remains soft overall on the palate.  Unparalled in drinkability."
"This is a miraculous beer, orange and thick with a creamy head. My first experience with saisons (Dupont) was less than ideal but this is something else. Mild euroskunk in the odor but that left once it was poured in the glass. Fruity, tart, with a hint of bitterness and a delectable finish. Hints of peach, tea, cinnamon, other tropical fruits but grounded so the sweetness is kept in check. Have been craving Hitachino Nest all day but this really did the trick. Highly recommended."
