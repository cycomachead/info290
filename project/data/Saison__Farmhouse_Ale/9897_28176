4.08,4.1,4.5,4,4,4,4.25,"Wonderful clarity and good head retention. I can immediately recognize that Jolly Pumpkin house aroma (and flavor) which is very pleasant. I can detect hay, citrus and light oak notes in the aroma. Flavors are able to pop thanks to the spritzy carbonation. Lemon and light citrus play well with the bright funk notes, which are subtle. The tartness and the tannins from the oak coat your mouth in a wonderful way and the dryness keeps you coming back for more. This is a very nice and refreshing beer.","Buttermilk","Mar 21, 2015"

Farmhouse, farmhouse, farmhouse aroma.  Slightly peppery.  Maybe some lemon.  Nice farmhouse, spicy bite to the taste.  The Belgian yeasts are strong and slightly spicy.  Kind of a lemony, tart, astringent aftertaste.  Very good beer.  My first try with Jolly Pumpkin.  Will definitely try some of their other offerings.","jngrizzaffi","Feb 28, 2015"

4,2,,,,,,"Picked up a bottle this weekend dated November 2013. It's been a couple of years since I've had any Jolly Pumpkin beers, and now I regret not buying them more often. Bam Biere is a simple yet tasty farmhouse ale that packs a lot of flavor into a relatively light package. Pours a nice dark golden color and quickly amasses quite a large and fluffy bright white head. Aroma fills your nose with lots of yeasty funk and earthiness right off the bat. A bit fruity and just a touch of bready malt in there as well. First sip tells you all you need to know about this farmhouse ale. It's the real deal. Tart and funk with a nice dose of juicy fruits and an ever so light touch of herbal hops. This beer, like many a good saison, really goes to show how much flavor can be packed into such a low ABV beer.","Kinsman","Aug 23, 2014"

3.94,0.5,4,3.75,4,4,4,"Another US craft brewery hits Alberta and there was much rejoicing (at least if you like light and sour Belgian ales). Bottle poured into a weizen glass. A pale cloudy yellow color with a towering fluffy white head composed of fairly large bubbles, the whole effect is very ""lemon meringue"" pie. Aroma is tart and citric with a subtle undercurrent of sweetness and lemony spice: Sour green fruit, wine gums, faint saddle leather or horse blanket, ginger, maybe a whiff of wildflowers. Palate features huge Granny Smith apple and unripe berry notes, more grains of paradise/ginger spice, white bread, lemon and lime rind, a more assertive bretty funk than the nose suggests but still clearly not a true ""wild ale", faint tropical fruit musk ... Everything does meld together a bit to form an overarching sour funk impression that I am rather enjoying. Light bodied and fizzy, makes the mouth tingle. Finishes dry, with a decent dose of spicy funk and light floral hops. Rather good, reminds one of a dialed-down Orval or Rayon Vert type Belgian pale with some brett character but still rather fruity and not at the same level of dryness.","CalgaryFMC","May 28, 2014"

4.09,4.3,4.25,4,4,4.25,4.25,"people always forget how amazing jolly pumpkin beers are, and this flagship funky saison is the standard by which others must be measured against. hazy blonde in color, with a colossal white airy head that not only never settles, but never even stops rising, very impressive. pale wheat malt as its base, the nose radiates complex yeast funk, some brett and some belgian strain working together. some pear or apricot fruit waft too, followed by a light hop bitterness, and the flavor is just like the smell. yeast driven with subtle malt, but not light in body, its fluffy and bigger, but drinks easy with its effervescent carbonation and low alcohol. bam is textbook saison, simply made but elegant and layered with nuanced flavors in perfect proportion that are not so easily recreated it must be, or others would be this good. one of the best in the business. perfect mix of yeast characters that constantly evolve. living beer at its finest.","StonedTrippin","Feb 14, 2014"

Some of my favorite saisons are high ABV, so the fact that this one is so well done while remaining low in strength is a credit to Jolly Pumpkin. Now that they are being distributed to Missouri again, I look forward to trying more and more of their offerings.","LambicPentameter","Jan 14, 2014"

A highly drinkable and refreshing beer that does not take a hit in complexity and flavor. Its just crazy that other beers nearly twice its potency can have a fraction of this beers complexity and personality. Definitely one of my new favorite beers and will definitely buy again and again. Beer poured, as mentioned above, is over 7 months old which explains the light lactic tartness and Brett character so I'm also curious to see how this tastes fresh and perhaps even older.

4.06,3.6,5,4,4,4,4,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 4/19/2012. Gusher, but I am not even upset. Pours hazy golden straw color with a beautiful 3 finger fluffy white head with incredible retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Thick foamy lacing clings to the glass; plenty of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big tart lemon zest, pear, apple, pepper, earth, grass, wheat, light funk, and yeast spices. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity. Taste of lemon, wheat, earth, pepper, clove, pear, and yeast spices. Light earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, wheat, earth, pepper, clove, pear, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of flavors; with zero cloying on the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a very crisp and slightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Zero alcohol presence as expected for 4.5%. Overall this is an excellent saison. True to style in flavor with a nice little kick of that JP funkiness. No complaints at all; very easy to drink and refreshing, with a nice amount of complexity.","superspak","Sep 28, 2012"

The flavors however fade too quickly. Really, this has Berliner Weiss type qualities with a bit more body. It's funky, so I suppose it's a farmhouse but isn't really similar to any others of the style. This beer just has unique qualities. It drinks really light in body with a lot of carbonation.

This seems more dominated by lactic sour than horse blanket funk. Same notes hit the tongue with a mild jaw clenching sour.

Bottle dated 6-8-11, so it may be a bit past its prime. Smell- a little sour tart citrus waft. A bit funky, some barnyard. But not an overwhelming obvious brett funk. Just something that reminds me of a farmhouse. Some coriander, orange citrus presence. Taste- a lacto-based sour (lactobacillus?) orangy- tart flavor. Funky for sure. Some nice complexity here, but easy drinking at the same time. I can see traditional Saison Ales tasting close to this. Refreshing, mildly funky, but overall for the purpose of refreshment and low ABV. This one doesnt have as much of a dry finish as you would expect from a Farmhouse Ale.

There are some lovely lemon flavors as it finishes with some hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is very light, crisp, and dry.

The mouthfeel is medium without any hint of alcohol. I really enjoyed this beer and I found that the colder it is, the less sourness you can pick up.

My palate must not be ready for this style. I'm sure some love it and maybe I will revert back to this and give it a second review when I have had more experience with this style of beer.

The flavor follows logically, the beer is very dry and has notes of light sourness some good bitter fruit rind plenty of fruitiness and citrus flavors as well balanced by a good consistent earthiness throughout.

Lots of fruit; lemon and apricot. Quite tart, but refreshing rather than mouth-puckering. Background of Brett barnyard funk, but complimentary rather than distracting. Moderate hop bitterness and low spicy hop flavor. Medium light body with high carbonation leads to a dry finish and highly drinkable beer. A truly outstanding wild ale.","CASK1","Nov 30, 2010"

After that the beer settles nicely into the glass with a huge and long-lived head, atop a bright orange biere. Fresh and lively, inviting. This beer is all about the fresh and the lively - zippy aroma of fresh grains, light grassy hops, and a slight musty funk. Subtly complex yet maintaining a simple, straightforward quench and drinkability factor. Nice woodsy funk, slightly sour, dry and earthy, slight hints of soap and bitter hop, lemony fresh and light grains. Real dang tasty. Finishes dry and refreshing. Quite possibly a perfect beer.

Lactic tartness, pale malt, sour apple, pear, spice, a hint of skunk, lemon grass, grain and cellar. The body is fairly light and it has a slightly sticky and lingering finish.

This actually kind of reminds me of a light beer that has a sourness added. Good mouthfeel, I like the lightness of the beer and the carbonation is good.

It's light and refreshing, bone-dry, mildly astringent and quite musty and funky with a restrained pale malt flavor. The wild yeast and bacteria brings a lot of complexity to this light-bodied ale.

4.06,3.6,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Poured a capped 750 into my Dogfish Head snifter. This beer pours a cloudy straw yellow with a massive puff of bright white head that leaves lace Lorraine down the entirety of the glass. The aroma starts off with subtle note of pear and apple, followed by fresh cut hay and finishing with just a hint of bright lemon zest. Slight bretty earthiness to it. While I don't think Bam Biere is fermented with brett, I can smell just a hint. The flavor is very similar with unripe green apples and hard pears. Lemon zest cuts across the palate, a slight bit of grass and damp earth. I pick up hint of bretty funk. I wonder if maybe the barrels used might contain some bacterial remnants adding another layer of complexity to this beer. At the very end is a citric tartness that lingers on the palate. The mouthfeel is about perfect for this beer. Heavy carbonation lifts flavors off the palate almost scrubbing it for the next sip. The carbonation is very energetic and never over powering. Bam Biere finishes exactly the way I want a Saison to finish: very dry. In a day in age when breweries are trying to Imperialize everything, its refreshing to see a great beer at 4.5%. This could easily make it into my regular Saison drinking rotation.","hwwty4","Mar 07, 2010"

Very sour/tart smell, some grain, and spice, but I keep getting the sour which I thought was fine. Taste is about the same. Some grain and general earthiness, yeast, some spices and a little tart to it. Pretty good I thought. Mouthfeel was very light, lots of carbonation and almost a little too thin.

Hard to put into words. Nicely carbonated, but while the taste is right there, it just feels thin throughout. Very drinkable, and for me, the sourness only enhances the allure.

The taste is slightly sour, with a good deal of earthiness coming forward as well. This is all balanced by a hint of sweetness and a lightly bitter finish.

Aroma is of lemons, saltines, and that distinct tart aroma of lactic bacteria. Tasting this beer was like biting into a lemon wedge but not quite as sour or tart. Mouthfeel is medium light and way too thin for a saison and there's a distinct flavor of lactic bacteria which is also off for the style. I could not smell, taste or detect any hops at all because of the sourness and tartness. Finish is harsh and the effevescent carbonation actually intensifies the off-flavors as I swallow the beer.

Aroma is pleasant somewhat spicy and very yeasty could be more prominent. Mouthfeel is alright nothing great very crisp but a tad thin for my liking. Flavor is right in line with the saisson style.

Rocky inch and a half head rose just below the lip of the glass before eventually settling into a thin layer of foam about halfway through the session. Lingering streamers of lacing with good adherence. Scent of citrus, green apple, yeast and lots of funk (similar to the smell of VT in the spring if you get my meaning). Taste is a little more subdued. Mild peppery flavor, as well as corriander and grapefruit. Lively mouthfeel with a mild burn across the roof of the mouth and a bit of a citrus pucker at the finish.

Lemon and green apple are the fore-front flavors, with light traditional farm-house spice flavors in the end. The feel is light and nicely carbonated, finishes sweet and tart for a nice balance.

There is a fresh crispness to the mouthfeel of this brew. A pickled feel and a bit of a mineral feel also exist on the tongue. Farmhouse ale seems to be pretty bready as it has attributes of a pilsner, pale ale and flemish sour ale. Sour spicey hue sits on the mouth long after the sip.

Taste is the same as the aroma, it's tart and sour, and finishes tart/bitter. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's smooth with good carbonation and a dry finish.

Hazy golden coloring with a chimney of carbonation rising like crazy through the center producing an amazing white head. The head very slowly beings to fall and become more dense and it leaves rocky chunks that don't move for the rest of the drink. The lacing that sticks to the sides also stays in place of the entire time. The smell is very full and rich with metallic, rubbery hops, spicy cloves, rich citrus, and sticky sweet candi sugar. The taste is completely different than the smell: The flavor is much more delicate and thin than the sticky sweet smell. There is a Co2 tastes that comes from the wild carbonation that is backed and twisted with the metallic Belgian hop addition. The first thing this reminded me of was when I had my Saison DuPont last month. I could also see similarities with this beer and Orval, minus the Orval Brett funk. One of the best things about this beer is that it is a session saison. These are so hard to come by. The price is a little steep, but it tastes like more expensive imports to me. A true fit to the authentic Belgian Saison style.","Rudgers73","Nov 17, 2007"

Strong spicy nose of wheat, and lots of citrus as well (mostly lemon). Light sourness, making this one unique compared with other saisons I've had. Taste is...Jesus Christ. Straight sour, kicks you square in the nuts. Nothing else whatsoever. I thought this one might have gone bad, but reading some of the other reviews, I'm not so sure. Awful, a pourer (one of the first I've ever poured, I think). Feel is okay, medium body. I'm hoping this one's gone bad, but I'm not sure if I'll have the gusto to throw more money at it.

I get some mild fruity esters mixed with crackery pale malts, a good overall tartness, and a bit of citrus pith. Finish is extremely dry and ends with some floral accents.

Sure, it is refreshing and a great introduction to this style, but there are other beers out there that would better fit those bills. Instead, this is great for the night at home of pure enjoyment and quite introspection. Being a big Frasier fan, I love the Jask Russell Terrier on the bottle, as it reminds me of Eddie. More importantly, this reminds me that American brewers can take on a foreign style of beer, and beautifully craft their own version of it.

Funky brett character on the nose, along with some oranges and a bit of wet-leaf must. On the palate, very complex with typical saison flavors, while the brett funk adds an extra dimension. First off, citric hops and juicy bitterness, with things skewed toward the hops at the expense of the malt. Light and bitter, but not too acidic. Mouthfeel is marked by huge carbonation (central to the style) and light consistency. Overall, this is very good.

4,2,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall: This was a pleasant surprise as I am not a huge fan of wild beers (in general). Very drinkable and would be excellent on a nice warm summer day. Best saison that I have ever had (as it lacked a skunky aroma like most)","bigman147","Jun 03, 2007"

An explosive aroma, soft fruity notes (the likes of peach, apricot) coated with light funky notes (as result of the wild yeast) that blends for an almost cider like complex. Steady streams of bubbles rise. I fell in love with the aroma. The taste isn't as effervescent (or impressive for that matter). The malts come more aggressive, not as tasty as their aroma counterpart. Fairly void of spice and not as ""fresh"" as the aroma would have you assume. A little flat and really quite dependent on a boring malt bill. I loved part of this beer and was neutral on the other half. I intend to revisit (because I enjoyed it) but I wasn't overly impressed with it as for the style goes.","biegaman","May 26, 2007"

The sour quality is rather muted compared to the nose, with notes of lime and maybe a little green onion making an appearance. Finish is dry, yet refreshing.

Near the end, the aroma seemed to become perfumey. Soft carbonation gives this a great mouthfeel, almost creamy. A bit of tartness, followed by some earthy spices, and lingering lemon zest. Great patches of lace are left clinging to the glass as I drink this brew. Lingering earthy and grassy bitterness. There is a bit of funky flavor that hits as you raise the glass to your lips.

Nose has a sprightly citrus like tone, hints of hops and a nice malt sweetness at the back, start is tartly sweet, grain presence delectable and the top moderate in feel.

It appears to have a lot of carbonation with tight bubbles. The smell of the beer is in character for a Saison, lemon and a slight must. The taste is sharp due to the high carbonation with a lemon and white pepper character. It finishes very dry. To me, this beer could have a little more body and it seems quite thin. I did not notice the low abv until I got home. Most saisons I have had are in the 7-8% range and have more of a medium mouthfeel. Bam is very light tasting, but it is refreshing. It reminded me more of a wit than a saison. The overall drinkability is good because of its clean crisp taste, but it is a little on the thin side for me.

The taste is complex, on par with the style. There are light pepper and citrus notes, with a refreshing bit of sourness and vinegar like acidity. The sour and the spice combined make for a very interesting combination. Slight farmhouse notes, a bit of must and hay.

As I popped the cap, the beer almost gushed out. A quick and careful pour saved every single drop. In the oversized wine glass, this looked like the prototypical Saison, with a hazy pale body, and a very large foamy head. The smell was typical as well, with a yeasty and doughy rustic smell mixed with a smattering of grassy and floral hops. The taste was light and refreshing with a good balance between sweet, sour, and spicy flavors. Not as funky as authentic Belgian examples, but still a very good interpretation. Mouthfeel was a bit too thin and watery for the style, considering the better examples of the style are above 6% ABV and cellarable. I would have no problems visiting this again in the middle of the summer for a change of pace from the Witbier and Pilsner rut.","rajendra82","May 12, 2006"

Early bitterness and light astringency, the bready aspects from the aroma seem to take a lesser role. Takes on a medicinal quinine flavor in the second part of the profile, at the same time that it becomes more unidimensional and less interesting. Dry and fairly refreshing, not as vacant at the close as some others Jolly Pumpkin brews, still these beers overall look good, have the chops in the aroma department but all seem less complex than their set-up implies.","ADR","May 11, 2006"

Taste is a bit more controlled, with a somewhat tart and spicy overall picture. Also a slightly chalky close that lingers. Mouthfeel is a bit prickly, what with spiciness and carbonation, but probably more or less to style, and drinkability is not so bad either.

Aromas are initially confused with that of a rotten granny smith apple and kitchen cleaner. Yet, when the senses are opened and the mind becomes more aware, the smell of sour fruits, citrus, mild sugars, and, oddly enough, the essence of freshly frozen ice, like on a hockey rink, fill the nose. I can now appreciate the aroma. Taste is very saison like; flavors of lactic sourness, lemons and oranges, coriander, fresh flowery mildness and mild raw veggies. Mouthfeel is good; very bubbly and zesty. Feels like my mouth is being wrapped around a beer blanket.
