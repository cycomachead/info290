"Wonderful clarity and good head retention. I can immediately recognize that Jolly Pumpkin house aroma (and flavor) which is very pleasant. I can detect hay, citrus and light oak notes in the aroma. Flavors are able to pop thanks to the spritzy carbonation. Lemon and light citrus play well with the bright funk notes, which are subtle. The tartness and the tannins from the oak coat your mouth in a wonderful way and the dryness keeps you coming back for more. This is a very nice and refreshing beer."

"Pours a very cloudy golden color with a very thick foamy head.  Head retention and lacing are superb.  Not many comparable to it.  Farmhouse, farmhouse, farmhouse aroma.  Slightly peppery.  Maybe some lemon.  Nice farmhouse, spicy bite to the taste.  The Belgian yeasts are strong and slightly spicy.  Kind of a lemony, tart, astringent aftertaste.  Very good beer.  My first try with Jolly Pumpkin.  Will definitely try some of their other offerings."
"O: A very underrated beer. The funk character reminded me so much of Cantillon but the tartness was lower - being a farmhouse style i didn’t expect that but a welcomed surprise."
"Good to the taste with yeast and malts and funk and some light lemons."

"Overall: This one took me by surprise - really a lovely beer. Absolutely delicious aroma, with apples and appleskins taking center stage. As for the drinking, nice and light and tasty. I'll be picking more of this up to see if it's as good when fresh. (4.25)"

"Too fruity for my taste"
""
"2010. Crisp refreshing tart light funk"
""
"A bottle conditioned ale so it poured a bit thick. The head stuck around for a while with this hazy beer. It had a lemony hay flavour with a slight bitterness. Out of all the beers we tried during this particular tatsing it had the lowest ABV at 4.5% but presented higher in the mouth. A great sipping beer."

""
""
"This is a beer that has aged quite well. I found this beer to be a bit simple (though still quite good) fresh. Much more complex with age, but still quaffable."

"M: Thick carbonation and has a slight tingle of the tip of the tongue."
""
"Serving type: bottle."
""
"Cloudy golden pour with a large frothy white head and lots of carbonation. Aroma of yeast, pepper and light lemon. Taste is somewhat peppery upfront with a good bit of yeast as well. Nice sour flavor comes out as the beer warms with flavors of lemon, oak and earth. Finishes with a nice sour lemon taste. Very interesting and complex."

"Picked up a bottle this weekend dated November 2013. It's been a couple of years since I've had any Jolly Pumpkin beers, and now I regret not buying them more often. Bam Biere is a simple yet tasty farmhouse ale that packs a lot of flavor into a relatively light package. Pours a nice dark golden color and quickly amasses quite a large and fluffy bright white head. Aroma fills your nose with lots of yeasty funk and earthiness right off the bat. A bit fruity and just a touch of bready malt in there as well. First sip tells you all you need to know about this farmhouse ale. It's the real deal. Tart and funk with a nice dose of juicy fruits and an ever so light touch of herbal hops. This beer, like many a good saison, really goes to show how much flavor can be packed into such a low ABV beer."

"Overall, this was a tasty, lighter style beer. Beautiful to look at but the bandaid and funk flavors just didn't combine well for this particular beer. Very easy to drink the bomber but don't think I'll be revisiting this one anytime soon."
""
""
""

"I know bottle conditioning is a 'thing', but sometimes it just goes too far. I'm a reasonably patient man, but this sort of shit just doesn't pass the smell test (well, it does, actually, as that's all I can do with this beer for a long while once I've 'poured' it). Pretty? Yes. Pretty wanky? Even more so. While I have nothing bad to say about the flavour or overall bearing of this offering, shitty presentation just has that cranky, negative effect on me."
"O: It's a great beer and everything works really well together. Jolly Pumpkin consistently produces beers with a nice funk and sourness to them."

"Another US craft brewery hits Alberta and there was much rejoicing (at least if you like light and sour Belgian ales). Bottle poured into a weizen glass. A pale cloudy yellow color with a towering fluffy white head composed of fairly large bubbles, the whole effect is very ""lemon meringue"" pie. Aroma is tart and citric with a subtle undercurrent of sweetness and lemony spice: Sour green fruit, wine gums, faint saddle leather or horse blanket, ginger, maybe a whiff of wildflowers. Palate features huge Granny Smith apple and unripe berry notes, more grains of paradise/ginger spice, white bread, lemon and lime rind, a more assertive bretty funk than the nose suggests but still clearly not a true ""wild ale", faint tropical fruit musk ... Everything does meld together a bit to form an overarching sour funk impression that I am rather enjoying. Light bodied and fizzy, makes the mouth tingle. Finishes dry, with a decent dose of spicy funk and light floral hops. Rather good, reminds one of a dialed-down Orval or Rayon Vert type Belgian pale with some brett character but still rather fruity and not at the same level of dryness."

"Very good brew. A tart Farmhouse ale that is not too biased to yeast and it is not really sweet. Utterly refreshing and not aggressive, I could easily drink it a whole afternoon."
"Prost!"

"Pour is hazed golden amber with a tight white head. Nose is hoppy and juicy, clean grain, juicy golden fruits, and a light dustiness. Grains are more in the forefront, clean. Dusty yeast, juicy golden fruits, extremely strong carbonation on a light body. Pear, lemon, nice integration and bright flavors but the carb takes a hint away from the finish."
""
""
""
""
"O: I think this is just a wonderfully made beer. It has so many subtle flavors that blend into something complex. It's refreshing yet interesting. Recommend."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The aroma from this beer was a citrus with a peppery spiciness with notes of tropical fruits. The beer had a white foamy head and was slightly cloudy and straw in color. You could still easily see through the beer but it was a little hazy. The beers flavor was just a little malt sweetness that turned to a citrus and clove flavor, and finished with a subtle spiciness. The beer was pretty clean and balanced no overwhelming flavors. The mouth-feel was very dry and bubbly. When we opened our bottle it slowly started to foam over a little."
""
""

"people always forget how amazing jolly pumpkin beers are, and this flagship funky saison is the standard by which others must be measured against. hazy blonde in color, with a colossal white airy head that not only never settles, but never even stops rising, very impressive. pale wheat malt as its base, the nose radiates complex yeast funk, some brett and some belgian strain working together. some pear or apricot fruit waft too, followed by a light hop bitterness, and the flavor is just like the smell. yeast driven with subtle malt, but not light in body, its fluffy and bigger, but drinks easy with its effervescent carbonation and low alcohol. bam is textbook saison, simply made but elegant and layered with nuanced flavors in perfect proportion that are not so easily recreated it must be, or others would be this good. one of the best in the business. perfect mix of yeast characters that constantly evolve. living beer at its finest."

"M: Kind of a weird saison, but still a tasty beer. A touch of graininess to the malt base that I think detracts a bit from the beer. But still pretty good."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, an excellent example of the style, and one that stays true to it's origins--low alcohol, easy to drink and refreshing beer that would have been given to farmhands as they worked the fields in hot weather. Some of my favorite saisons are high ABV, so the fact that this one is so well done while remaining low in strength is a credit to Jolly Pumpkin. Now that they are being distributed to Missouri again, I look forward to trying more and more of their offerings."

"O - Bought this on a trip to Michigan, direct from the source. Jolly Pumpkin brews have a distinct taste. I like that about them. It could be a bit divisive though. Wife took a sip and hated it! Me, I think I'd buy it again if I visited JP."

"A tart and thirst quenching Saison. Excellent summer fair."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: this is a seriously drinkable saison. Its lack of strength means it doesn't pack the flavor punch of stronger brews, but it also makes this a superbly drinkable session saison. Love it!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: All I have to say is I am legitimately impressed by the huge character of this relatively small 4.5% abv beer. A highly drinkable and refreshing beer that does not take a hit in complexity and flavor. Its just crazy that other beers nearly twice its potency can have a fraction of this beers complexity and personality. Definitely one of my new favorite beers and will definitely buy again and again. Beer poured, as mentioned above, is over 7 months old which explains the light lactic tartness and Brett character so I'm also curious to see how this tastes fresh and perhaps even older. Ron Jeffries I love you!"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This is very refreshing and a great beer to have on a hot day, with its low ABV. The Belgian characteristics are there without being overwhelming."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: amazing saison, had always wanted to try and figured at the price there wasn't too much risk even if it fell off after 2 years sitting on the shelf, happy I did; wish I could have found a fresher one around town to compare"

"""Subtle"" is perhaps too strong of a word for the flavor, which is not much. It's more like a science experiment. There is a slight acidic whiff if you try to smell it. This is just such a shadow of a beer, that if MillerCoors came out with it as a new Blue Moon flavor, the Lite drinkers would complain. On tap at the Public House in La Jolla."
"A pretty much a 2 note beer(brett and yeasty spiciness) with a light, almost watery body. I was really expecting the high level of complexity that comes with most of Jolly Pumpkin's offerings, but I have to say I am pretty disappointed by this beer. However, It does achieve what it set out to be; which is a light, refreshing rustic ale. I just wish that the Brett character had more of that signature Jolly Pumpkin layered complexity."
""
""
""
"Certainly one of JP's best year-round brews, it integrates a few different styles by taking a funky farmhouse saison and souring it just a bit - not quite a saison, not quite a Flanders oud bruin. JP often blurs the style guidelines, and that's what I love about them. Possibly the best thing about this beer is the 4.5% ABV tag, too - so drinkable and quenching, and you won't be paying for it later. Definitely a solid brew."

"O: rather mild flavor; not a bad thing for the Brett component. Bretty/earthy/funky beers your kind of thing? ... then this one’s for you. For me, it's barely drinkable, at best."

"O-I was slightly disappointed with the mild flavor, but then I realized that this brew has half the ABV of many of the other beers I was comparing it against and it clicked why the flavors were less intense. Keeping that thought in mind, I would drink this again on a hot summer day or as a session-type beer. As a stand-alone, however, this brew is a little light on taste for me."
""
"O: i possibly set my expectations too high on this one. definitely not a fan of the how light the brew was as i think it off set the beer.. just my honest opinion"
""
""
"Overall: For the price and availability this is a go to saison for me. I love how easy this one drinks. I just discovered JP and I can't wait to drink this one on a hot summer Jawjuh day."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 4/19/2012. Gusher, but I am not even upset. Pours hazy golden straw color with a beautiful 3 finger fluffy white head with incredible retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Thick foamy lacing clings to the glass; plenty of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big tart lemon zest, pear, apple, pepper, earth, grass, wheat, light funk, and yeast spices. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity. Taste of lemon, wheat, earth, pepper, clove, pear, and yeast spices. Light earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, wheat, earth, pepper, clove, pear, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of flavors; with zero cloying on the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a very crisp and slightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Zero alcohol presence as expected for 4.5%. Overall this is an excellent saison. True to style in flavor with a nice little kick of that JP funkiness. No complaints at all; very easy to drink and refreshing, with a nice amount of complexity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The lemon was a tad lactic, plenty of spiciness, solid fruity middle with a dry finish. The aroma was almost perfect for what I want a Saison to smell like. I liked this better than the E.S. Bam."
"O- not a bad beer by any means, but not standout at all. I prefer Brooklyn Sorachi Ace when looking at a lemony saison, but the ABV on this is a major bonus"
""
"The funk would emerge more in the bottle. There is a nice crispness to it across the aromas and taste. A very good beer with nice balance as well."
""
""
""
"Overall – A decent saison,, but at the price you pay for it is not really one to go after -rather standard."
""
"Not one of my favorites. Too much white pepper drowns out the flavors I normally like in JP brews."
""
"Overall a very complex saison that is definitely worth a try . I love the funky sour this beer offers. A great blend that just seems authentic."

""
"Based on my relatively limited experience with farmhouse ales, I'd say this one fits the profile dead on. There is some nice complexity in the various tastes, and other than the style's tangy character, pretty nicely balanced."
""
""
""
"o - Overall a nice beer from JP. Has their signature funk and yeast to it. I liked the nose a lot as it was quite funky and sour, though the taste was a little less and a little too much pepper and spice for me. Would have it again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Great Brett-driven Saison. Very refreshing and crisp, but could use a little more oomph. Of course, it is under 5%, so that is quite impressive."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's exceptionally drinkable. Yes, it is. It's a very, very good beer. Yes, it is. I just have such a high bar for Jolly Pumpkin that I want them to hit me out of the park with every brew they make. This is their standard beer."
"O: Not a bad saison. The funky kind isn't my favorite but this isn't offensive at all."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Body is medium to medium-light, with medium-high levels of carbonation. The result is a somewhat prickly beer upon the tongue at first, gradually declining to just feeling ""crisp"" and ""tight"" across the palate due to the carbonation and lighter body. Finish is semi-dry. Generally, this felt appropriate and very enjoyable on the palate."
""
""
"O) Farmhouse Ales are admittedly not my favorite style, and yet I keep drinking them. Guess I'm waiting for some sort of ahha moment. This brew seems like a solid option to me, and while I'm not likely to seek it out again, if you like farmhouse ales, I think you'll probably enjoy it."
""
"Good, quite bretty but balanced well, nice and pretty easy drinking. Brings on some funk without it being intense."
""
"Follows the other JP beers that I have had. This one is smooth and easy going and really refreshing for the hotter weather."
"O:  A solid offering from Jolly Pumpkin. The sourness was a great match for the spicy carbonation. Very well blended flavors.  I'm so glad we have this selection in Oklahoma. "
"750 ml bottle. Pours a hazy golden amber with a small white head that has good retention and leaves some light lacing on the glass. The aroma is funky with earthy brett, grapefruit hops, some light lemon, and apricot. The taste has a light initial sweetness and a mild tartness. There is grapefruit, lemon, and an earthy funkiness. The finish has a slight tartness and bretty earthiness. Light body. Medium-low carbonation."
"Bottle enjoyed at Blue Tractor in Ann Arbor. Pours cloudy golden with big fluffy white head that goes on and on. Smells of spice, hay, big yeast, and grassy hops. Starts bitter on the tongue with a sour finish, big funky yeast influence, and a nice lingering funky grassy finish. Generous carbonation and light bodied. Very nice. I have come to enjoy these JP beers as a nice change up from the ordinary IPA, and the hint of sourness makes this more enjoyable than other saisons I have had."
""
""
""
""
""
"The body was fairly average for the style, medium and with just a lingering finish. Drinkability was good (but then, I think pretty much all Saisons are highly drinkable), and the beer went down easily enough. Overall, a nice enough beer, one that's worth trying if you see it, but not really a special example of the style."
""
""
""
""
"Super refreshing, not too complex. Not what you'd typically expect of a saison. The brett funk is pretty prevalent. Not that I'm comlaining. I really love Jolly Pumpkin beers, and although this isn't my favorite of their offerings, I still think it's awesome."
""
"Overall; Perfect to show people if they want to experiment with new beers. Still of 16$ its just ok. Would wait a few years and see how it tastes for sourheads."
""
""
"O: Overall quite nice, though a little one dimensional on the flavour front towards the Brett."
""
"Overall – Very drinkable. A lot of gueze like qualities. Looking forward to trying more beers from this brewer."
"Overall - not a bad brew, and interesting to think about, but not interesting enough for another bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall the sum of the parts is more than the overall appeal of this beer. It seemed quite one dimensional to me even though many of it's qualities were good. As I made my way though the bottle I didn't notice any differences as the beer warmed and I felt like my first couple sips told the entire story. Also the wording on the bottle weirded me out. It claimed malt and hops however I got none of either of those. Overall an average beer."
""
""
"4.5, 4, 4, 4.5, 4"
""
"D: Creative, interesting, and tasty. With the tart/sour/funk this may not be for everyone. But for those that like this sort of beer, this one is very solid & super drinkable."
""
"All in all this a great beer. These guys really do things right at this brewery it's a still I love."
"O - 4's across the board on this one... Great farmhouse ale."
""
""
""
""
"D ~ A very straight forward Saison with a great nose, but the overall beer is more good than great. Worth a try."
""
""
""
"Poured from undated bomber to Duvel tulip the beer pours a hazy golden yellow, fairly translucent with a huge billowing 3 finger head, good retention and lacing. The nose is bright with a nice tart yeast character supplemented by hints of toasted grain and earthy hops. The flavor begins tart and flavorful. The yeast provides a subtle tartness from which the flavor builds: hints of toast, earthy hops, some fruit character. The middle provides a medium bitterness. Finishes crisp and clean with a lingering tart bitterness. Lighter bodies with good carbonation. Overall this is a refreshing beer, lower Abv but still flavorful and enjoyable."
"O- A quaffable ""sour"" if there ever was one. I like the flavors that come through here. There's more to it than I'm able to really describe here. This is one to revisit."
""
"Cheers!"
"Overall this is a refreshing, drinkable saison - but pretty one-dimensional and maybe also a little thin."
""
""
""
""
""
"* Obviously I was much too high on my prediction."
""
"This beer pours a light bodied clear gold in color, to begin with, with a one finger very bubbly and quickly dissipating white head. The nose is very dry and tart. It has a lot of funk and an assertive tartness, almost champagne yeast esque. The flavors are tart, full of brett, light, with some lemon and a slight acetic acidity. The flavors however fade too quickly. Really, this has Berliner Weiss type qualities with a bit more body. It's funky, so I suppose it's a farmhouse but isn't really similar to any others of the style. This beer just has unique qualities. It drinks really light in body with a lot of carbonation. It's spritzy. Overall I like this a lot but it is very light and the tartness isn't as strong as it could be. It's also $11."
""
""
""
"Bottled in 7/2011. Pours a slightly hazy amber with one finger thick fizzy white head; settles to a thin ring with a few dots of lace on the glass. Smell: lemon, soapy, barnyard whiff, mildly sweet graininess. Taste: fairly hefty acidic lemon kick, spicy with a medicinal note. Pale malt base with nary a residual sugar. Light bodied with a drying citric/acetic finish. Carbonation is a bit much, becoming almost seltzery. Tasty and refreshing table strength saison."
""
""
""
""
""
"The smell seems like it's just Brett and dryness, some faint fruity esters. The taste is a dry Brett bite with some graininess in there. Very interesting, but for me, this is a beer that goes with a meal, light, thin bodied and crisp. Don't get me wrong the flavor is strong, but hard to describe. Grab this crazy beer and drink it, because it's good."
"O - A really nice beer, not too sour a good introduction to the offerings of Jolly Pumpkin."
"Overall I'm disappointed. The visual, aroma, feel all lend themselves to a great beer. The taste is ok, but highly disappointing especially after the nose. There's nothing necessarily wrong with the taste, but it's lacking something."
""
""
"Overall i really think this is an excellent take on the Saison i'm excited that this brewery is coming to OK in the next couple of weeks and am way too excited to try the LA Roja."
""
""
""
"Bomber of batch 506/507 shared with the girlfriend & loving the labelwork. A murky light orange into a tulip glass. White head with a little lacing, looks refreshing. Nose is all lactic sourness, oak, white wine, champagne like yeast, tart funk, but the classic Saison style does not come to mind here. This seems more dominated by lactic sour than horse blanket funk. Same notes hit the tongue with a mild jaw clenching sour. I get the oak, the lactic wildness, and a lot of citric fruity characters - but this isnt what I think of when I think of a Saison. Very drinkable beer, just was looking for something different here I guess."
""
"Pours a bright golden yellow with a tight white head that has good retention. Nose opens with some tart lemon, then moves of to the funk, some wet mushrooms and forest floor. Not overpowering in the funk department, just enough to balance the tartness. The taste is more of the same, very well balanced beer. I get a little bit of an aspirin bitter aftertaste but not enough to ruin the beer for me. The mouthfeel is spritzy and thin and lends itself to high drinkability. Overall, this is a nice funky farmhouse ale, nothing overpowering or outlandishly funky but definitely drinkable."
""
""
"The beer isn’t bad… but the bubbles are ALL I can think about. So if you like a beer that is loaded with carbonation, this is the beer for you. The most I have found in a beer to date. Not sure I could drink this one again. I will finish the glass, but that’s as far as I can go."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I think I'm just not a huge fan of sour in my beer. This is the second beer I've tried from Jolly Pumpkin, and I remember the other one (Oro De Calabaza) being similar but better. I have a Luciérnaga waiting in the fridge, so maybe that will be different."

"O: kind of a strange beer, the nose suggests a much stronger sour but it's actually a little watery and the flavors are quite subdued."
"O - Overall I was somewhat dissappointed by this Jolly Pumpkin offering. Its nice and lightly funky/sour but not as assertive as some other Jolly Pumpkins."
"Taste is very tart balanced with spicy malts and floral hops. Decent beer for a sour. My favorite of the Jolly Pumpkin beers that I have tried."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: I’ve enjoyed this one a good bit. The beer drinks easily and each sip invites the next. My overall impression is of a well made saison that I intend to revisit. It isn’t Saison Dupont and that is one of its strengths. It is recognizable as a saision but it is also its own beer with a unique interpretation of the style."
" What a nice beer, I could drink this all day."
"Try if you like."
"Hauled back from Colorado from my GABF trip. Poured from bottle into my DFH snifter glass. Pours a cloudy yellow-orange flavor, some head that quickly recedes. Bottle dated 6-8-11, so it may be a bit past its prime. Smell- a little sour tart citrus waft. A bit funky, some barnyard. But not an overwhelming obvious brett funk. Just something that reminds me of a farmhouse. Some coriander, orange citrus presence. Taste- a lacto-based sour (lactobacillus?) orangy- tart flavor. Funky for sure. Some nice complexity here, but easy drinking at the same time. I can see traditional Saison Ales tasting close to this. Refreshing, mildly funky, but overall for the purpose of refreshment and low ABV. This one doesnt have as much of a dry finish as you would expect from a Farmhouse Ale. Overall, very nice, great summer beer."
"Light bodied with a lot of carbonation. Very flavorful and refreshing."
"O - Lots of flavor and easy to drink. Worth checking out."
"O- I really like this biere!"
"O- A nice Saison that it sour, funky, yet very approachable and drinkable. This has the most barnyard funk taste I've had in a Saison, but am impressed with this brew and curious to try more of their offerings."
"25oz bottle. Pours a semi hazy golden color, white foam cap and lacing. Aroma is barnyard, lightly sour, lemony and hay like. In the taste, more musty basement, lactic sour, grapefruit rind, and a small hop bitterness. Pleasantly sour and earthy. Drying, yeasty finish. Medium to light bodied and well carbonated. Another characterful sour ale from Jolly Pumpkin."
"O - I am actually really pleased with this beer. It's an all around enjoyable beer, the carbonation and palate are quite solid. I had their Luciernaga, The Firefly and wasn't blown away. The owner who I bought this from was raving about the different layers, so I gave them a try. It's making me wonder if I possibly got a bad batch of The Firefly. I'll have to retry it sometime."
"This is a greet summer beer because its very light, lemony, and easy to drink. I'll be back for more next year"
"Overall a good beer that I hope to try on draft sometime."
"My first brew from Jolly Pumpkin, and it definitely didn't disappoint. For $7, this is a bargain within the style, cheers!"
"Overall: A very enjoyable summer beer that is refreshing and complex."
"Appears golden bright yellow with a fluffy white head, great retention and lots of lacing. Smell is spicy yeast, hay, pear, citrus rind, typical jolly pumpkin funk, and pale malt. Taste is just like the smell. Faintly acidic with an equally faint sweetness. Thin body, smooth texture, with a tart, dry finish. Very easy to drink, full of flavor and great for warm weather. Not the most traditional saison, but does not taste Americanized."
"Overall: A nice return for me to Jolly Pumpkin. A nice, light, sessionable, summer beer. I could have several glasses of this. The pepper is not overpoweriing and the fruit tastes are amazing."
"Overall: This is light, crisp, and refreshing. Saison is not a style I normally get into, but the Jolly Pumpkin twist makes this a winner for me. Perfect for sipping outside on a hot summer day."
"Edit: Had another bottle of this tonight thanks to zimmerbloke! It's been almost a year since my first bottle, but it's still a phenomenal beer in my book. I'll add the date later when I look at the bottle again, but I know it's over a year old. Checked out the old review I did and decided it needed bumps in points. Easily one of the most underrated saisons I've encountered."
"Overall-I'm not real sure what to think of this beer. This is the first beer of this style that I've tried, so maybe I wasn't prepared for how sour tasting it was going to be. Don't think I would buy again."
"O - I feel like I wasted this beer by opening it while it was so volatile. It was really good though. I'm not sure how old this particular batch is, but I'll be buying another bottle or two to cellar. I did find it to be sort of in between a saison and a gueze. It was lacking some of the characteristic spice from a saison, but it wasn't as intense or tart/sour as a gueze. Perfect beer as an intro to some of the funkier stuff."
"O - damn good beer"
"This was paired up with a red cheese wild mushroom puff pastry with ginger plum chutney, awesome combo. The smell of the beer had a really nice dry hopped aroma and earthy farmhouse smell it to it. The taste paired with the food was very nice, the sour hoppiness was matched very well with the creamy cheese. The mouthfeel had a healthy amount of carbonation. Overall this beer was very enjoyable with the pairing and on it's own."
"I wasn't sure at first sip, but I enjoy it. However, I do enjoy saisions which have a stronger hop presence."
"Pours a slightly hazy, dirty straw color with a medium white head that diminishes quickly. Scent is very funky and a bit tart. Some nice barnyard aromas, along with grass and pepper. Some nice yeasty aromas as well. Taste is initially funky with some nice hop flavors. Then I get some pepper, Belgian yeast, green apples, and just a hint of tartness. There are some lovely lemon flavors as it finishes with some hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is very light, crisp, and dry. Drinkability is very high, as this is a very refreshing and sessionable beer for this hot, summer day. Overall, not one of the best saisons I've had, and definitely not one of my favorite JP beers...but it's good."
"Pours a light straw, even a bit hazy. Head is huge and never really dissipated. Scent is not huge, but present is a fruity sweetness. Taste is apricots, peaches, fermented apples even. A bit of mustiness? The mouthfeel is dry, there exists some, a little, hoppy bitterness in the back. Overall, solid Saison."
"Once poured, it has a thick white foamy head. The head dissipates quickly and leaves nice lacing down the glass. Really effervescent, translucent and a pale orange color. I smell green apples and slight citrus notes. The taste has sour green apple that quickly drops to dry. The acidic sourness is not overbearing and in fact refreshing. The mouthfeel is medium without any hint of alcohol. I really enjoyed this beer and I found that the colder it is, the less sourness you can pick up. I just finished mowing the lawn and this was a perfect way to finish. A great lawnmower beer and a nice twist to the saison style!"
"I really love Jolly Pumpkin - if you haven’t yet discovered them for yourself, start here and work your way up to the bigger, crazier and sourer stuff."
"Overall, this was a very refreshing and tasty beer. I wish that Jolly Pumpkin was more available down here because I would blow this beer up all summer long. I highly recommend this beer for sure."
"Pours a cloudy, maize color. 1/5 inch head of a white color. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells of sweet malt, yeast, slight spice, floral aromas, and hops. Fits the style of a Saison / Farmhouse Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with an average carbonation level. There is also a noticeable tang. Tastes of sweet malt, slight pale malt, hint of hop, slight floral, hint of spice, and hint of yeast. Overall, very drinkable; good aroma, body, and blend."
"Overall not a bad beer, but not the great experience I had with Sofie from Goose Island. I wouldn't get this again."
"Overall - Interesting saison. I love the tartness and I love the funk. Definitely would buy this again."
"O- Only my third saison, first from Jolly Pumpkin, really starting to love the style, will be stocking up on JP next time I head to Buffalo!"
"Like it seems with most Jolly brews, give this one at least 15-20 to open up as the flavors and especially the tartness needs to harmonize. Overall, another winner in my book. I think I'm much more of a fan of the lower-gravity Jollys, as they seem to be incredibly flavorful yet really light on their feet. And not too overwhelming in the funk department either."
"Poured a clear golden-yellow, with a small white head that dissipated rather quickly. Musty smell, sweet malts, and a touch of sugar. Sweet toasted malt taste, grassy with extra dandelions, some hay and light sugar notes. A subtle sensation of bitter hops also noticeable in the finish. Light bodied and moderately drinkable."
"I like a good Saison and Bam is hitting few of the right buttons for me."
"Overall not half bad. Not the best in the style I had ever had, but definitely worth seeking out to try again."
"Lighter medium body, high carbonation, refreshing and drinkable. Nice flavor and good integration of tartness, fits in nicely with the rest of the JP lineup."
"Overall, it tastes good, drinks good, but it's really not anything special, especially for the price. This is my first beer from Jolly Pumpkin and I'm disappointed."
"o: Just an outstanding, refreshing, unbelievably drinkable small saison. Loved it."
"o - not bad. better on tap. this bottle has been staring me in the face for too long so im happy i got one to review here. not gonna be buying consistently, but i might go in on one with someone who hasnt had something like this to share the experience. definitely unique for a farmhouse style."
"I like how this one is able to play up the funk/barnyard while still being a light, crisp drinker. Not something I'd see myself buying much, though."
"O: I have had this beer before, but I was not able to rate it at the time. I loved it then, and I love this batch now. If you like saisons or sour beers, you will adore this brew. Jolly Pumpkin strikes again offering a beer with sour fruit notes, pepper, and yeasty bread. It is a perfect beer to drink in warmer weather."
"Light mouthfeel that finishes crisply. A solid beer that, with the low abv, could be enjoyed in nice quantities."
"Tons of carbonation as expected. Bubbly, light mouthfeel and a bone dry finish. Just what you want in a saison. Overall a well done beer, just wish there was a bit more to it. The low alcohol and easy palatability make this a great one for a hot day. I'll grab another and save it for summer."
"D-5"
"Pours a straw yellow colour with thick white head. Good head retention with some lacing around the glass. Smells quite funky (brett?), almost wine-like, with lots of yeasty aroma. Some mild citrus hops as well. Flavour is tart, verging on being sour. A nice saison. On the sour side, but it works nicely."
"I am pretty impressed with this one overall. I am not usually a big fan of this style but this just might be my favorite so far."
"Light straw yellow with a dense, white head with great retention and lacing. The nose is great. Plenty of Brett and funk, this has a great balance between old leather and hay, bringing to mind a good BDSM session.Straw, wheat and a little yeast are present. With no malt or hop character, is is all about the yeast. The palate has a complex Brett character, leather, straw, clove and hay. The clove plays second fiddle here. Light in body with high carbonation, this is drying and mildly spicy on the finish. A great deal when on tap at Max's, the bottles are just too damn pricey."
"O - A good beer, I'm not sure it's a session beer because of the flavors, but it's a good beer that will stand up on its own with good food."
"I won't be coming back to this beer. It's tasty and certainly has some good parts, but there's nothing outstanding or memorable about this beer. It will go down with countless other beers when asked I'll simply say ""it was good"" or ""there's nothing wrong with it."""
"Note: Batch 695/696, Bottled 12/17/2010"
"Good over all drink ability. Very tasty saison to have around."
"This is a really agreeable and sessionable Farmhouse Ale that's better had being sipped."
"D- very well put together, nice combination of a saison with a sour, very easy to drink, nice and refreshing, another solid beer from jolly pumpkin"
"I was surprised that I enjoyed this beer as much as I did. I bought eight Jolly Pumpkin beers today; and had this first because I expected it to be my least favorite. I think this will be slightly hard to top, however. It still does not compare to La Roja as far as my personal taste; but one of these is bound to top it. For the style, an excellent Saison that reminds me why I love Jolly Pumpkin brews."
"Overall, this is a pretty good beer. Its nothing extraordinary but its still quite good and I'll be willing to give Jolly Pumpkin another try sometime in the future. I'd give this one a go if you are a fan of saisons. Cheers!"
"Drinkability - Well, this was my first Saison, so maybe I was caught a little off gaurd by the aroma and taste. Maybe just a touch too sour for me. My palate must not be ready for this style. I'm sure some love it and maybe I will revert back to this and give it a second review when I have had more experience with this style of beer. As for now, this is not a beer I would want on a regular basis."
"D: Probably my favorite Jolly Pumpkin regular line-up beer. This one is just fantastic."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D-Just sour enough to make it very crisp and refreshing, super easy to drink. It is different from what you would normally get these days, but I think its a really nice change. This was my intro to Jolly Pumpkin and I am not let down."
"D: Very easy drinking. This beer went down well, with nothing distracting from the enjoyment of a good beer. One of the better offerings I've had from this style, but it's hard for me to compare."
"D: The beer itself is decently drinkable, if you like sour beers. Alcohol is hidden well, and the sour flavor is all you taste. Probably won't purchase another bottle, but would try it again if somebody else had one."
"D- very good its a light saison that has a nice floral ,citrus,tart taste will buy again"
"A very crisp, light bodied and well carbonated saison. At just 4.50% abv, yet still be capable of so much flavor is impressive. Very drinkable beer, and interesting to boot."
"Pours a hazy sunny yellow with some floaties and a huge semi loose head that leaves lots and lots of spotty lace. The aroma is lemon rind with a good funky barnyard character, some tartness, and some really well defined fruitiness. The flavor follows logically, the beer is very dry and has notes of light sourness some good bitter fruit rind plenty of fruitiness and citrus flavors as well balanced by a good consistent earthiness throughout. For it's sourness the beer is only mildly tart, but everything works together harmoniously to make a really damn refreshing complex and delicious beer, I really wish they still had the six packs of this around."
"D: Pleasant to drink, but not much more than that. I'll spend my money on a more satisfying saison in the future."
"Poured from a bomber into a tulip. First glass was a brilliantly clear, deep gold color with a thick, creamy, meringue-like head. Aroma is very light grainy malt with tart fruity notes of lemon, peach, pear and orange. Low peppery phenols and low spicy hop aroma. Low Brett character in the nose. Complex and refreshing taste. Lots of fruit; lemon and apricot. Quite tart, but refreshing rather than mouth-puckering. Background of Brett barnyard funk, but complimentary rather than distracting. Moderate hop bitterness and low spicy hop flavor. Medium light body with high carbonation leads to a dry finish and highly drinkable beer. A truly outstanding wild ale."
"Im still wondering why this beer is not rated higher. It is well balanced, easy to drink, and it is unique. If I had this blind and someone told me it was a Fantome brew, Id believe it."
"O: Highly drinkable due to low gravity, acidity. Fruitiness and funkiness well balanced. Not the most complex Saison, but quite pleasant to drink."
"Drinkability: Really light great clean beer with some nice flavor undertones"
"A good introduction to sour/funky beers for novice drinkers - and a unique example of the style."
"D - I could drink this all day every day, it is infinitely drinkable."
"Overall: Easy drinking. I was expecting more complexity out of it. Very light yeast driven beer."
"Incredibly drinkable, went through the bottle in no time."
"Pours a moderate yellow-golden with a nice white head and some pretty good lacing. The nose is quite good with some moderate funk, light grain, green apple, and some oak. The taste is a bit peppery with some oak and funk. Some very light fruit. Really good feel between the oak and the funk. Drinks incredibly well and is absolutely sessionable."
"D - Very good ABV and good overall flavor. I would have this more often but its not my favorite Saison."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style even though it's a bit on the sour side, although there are better beers in the style this is a good beer do drink for a while."
"D: Not the best example of the style I've ever had, but certainly something that brings you back for another sip. Light and lively, which is what I want in this beer."
"12oz tulip on draught at fine establishment. A very lively pour, so much so that the bartender had to let the beer sit for a minute or two to give me an honest glassful. After that the beer settles nicely into the glass with a huge and long-lived head, atop a bright orange biere. Fresh and lively, inviting. This beer is all about the fresh and the lively - zippy aroma of fresh grains, light grassy hops, and a slight musty funk. Subtly complex yet maintaining a simple, straightforward quench and drinkability factor. Nice woodsy funk, slightly sour, dry and earthy, slight hints of soap and bitter hop, lemony fresh and light grains. Real dang tasty. Finishes dry and refreshing. Quite possibly a perfect beer. Jolly Pumpkin embraces the barrel and so should you."
"D: If you like the style, this is probably more legitimate than many American attempts. Still, nothing like Fantome, or DuPont. I adore the style, and will have no trouble finishing this big bottle, but it's just about average for the style, I think."
"I'm torn - I suppose because I don't care for this style. This is a decent Saison, being very light and tart, and representative of the style, and it would be a great quencher on a hot day, but there's no excitement within this bottle. The beer is a lightly-soured version of a very plain pale. Not that they would, but Anheuser could brew this and call it Bud Light Farmhouse."
"D - A boozy 4.5% beer? Not bad, not great"
"D- Extremely drinkable, enough interesting depth in flavor to keep me interested, and light body, dry finish that is refreshing."
"Overall a good wild ale. I like De Dolle Oerbier Special Reserve much better (especially one that is a few years old), but its a much bigger and different beer. I would definitely buy again!"
"D- Since having this a few more timesw around the city, I gotta say it's one to go back for. It's not super complex, but an easy drinker with character."
"This beer pours with a golden straw color with a beautiful head that clings to the glass and recedes very deliberately. A heavy green apple presence in the aroma which comes from their love of open fermentation. The flavor is exactly what you expect from the first sniff...lots of green apple and heavy sour notes. Not a beer you can drink several of in one sitting because of the sourness. The finish is quite dry and one would expect from a saison style. If you want to experience the pinnacle of open fermentation brewing, get your hands on just about anything this brewery makes!"
"Would like to try this one fresh to compare the brett levels in each. This one just has a bit too much, maybe it's the age, maybe that is what they were going for. Makes it hard to finish the whole 750..."
"D: A solid, well made, drinkable saison."
"Pours a near clear yellow sunlight color with a huge, white head with ridiculous retention and a clumpy lacing that rub a down the glass. The aroma is big time floral and even some perfume aromas. Very light and fresh with some sourness to it. The flavor is very crisp, flowery and fen has some sour notes like the aroma. Really a classic tasting saison. Love how light and crisp it is. The mouthfeel is nice too with laser focus on the acidity and light palate cleansing components. The low abv is just perfect for the summer and really shows how a beer is capable of huge complexity and flavor with such low abv."
"Mouth feel is quite effervescent. I would like this a lot more if it was stronger alcohol. Came across watery. Otherwise, a fine tasting beer."
"Nice farmhouse. Enjoyable."
"Very good farmhouse ale from JP. It's incredible how much flavor they can fit into a 4.5% beer."
"Served up a cloudy, slightly golden yellow with a nice foamy and creamy head that leaves droopy lacing on the sides of the tumbler. Aroma is of fresh citrus, pepper, grass and summertime. It also carries are fare amount brett tartness. The flavor is quite nice and much more complex than the smell. Lactic tartness, pale malt, sour apple, pear, spice, a hint of skunk, lemon grass, grain and cellar. The body is fairly light and it has a slightly sticky and lingering finish. This is a very drinkable beer that would make a great summer session choice."
"Draft. Stopped in the brewery and had a little sampler of several beers. Pretty cloudy yellow pour with a white head. Spice and slight fruit aroma in the nose. Spicy farm taste as well. Funky finish with fruits. Light/Medium mouthfeel. Not really something that I thought was spectacular but not terrible either."
"D_Very drinkable. Great summer beer which seems to be the point of saisons."
"Hazy honey color. Smells of sour funk, and citrousy fruits. Nice fluffy head to it. Very lemonie in flavors. Well balanced. A little mild for my taste, but a lot of the non-sour beer drinkers were digging it. there is something to be said about that. This might be a good one to try if you are looking to get into sour beers. Highly drinkible for how out there it is."
"D - A little more body or less sourness would have resulted in a more balanced beer, but this still works very well. It seems like something that could be sipped on slowly for hours and enjoyed thoroughly."
"D: Very easy to drink. Sour, but not overly so. Low alcohol content with a pleasant aroma and taste. Good stuff."
"In tap at the jp pub as part of a sampler...Pours a light gold semi clear, ok retention and lacing...The aroma and taste are both dominated by sourness, there is not a lot going on here in terms of complexity or flavor. A typical jp sour beer but a little below average for them."
"D - this was definitely on the musty and sour side within the Saison flavor family. I wouldn't say I was crazy about this, but at the same time I wasn't disappointed. Good saison. Given the price point, I don't know if I will return to it, however I have been meaning to check out this brewery for a while and will definitely pick up some more by them."
"O: The aroma is better than the taste, clean and light, want crisper/drier, more funk would be good but it would probably mean hops would be weaker"
"Overall, another good Jolly Pumpkin beer. Cheers!"
"This particular saison beer comes out of the tap a hazy, barely translucent light honey golden. Strong aroma is sweet, fairly malty and slightly spicy. Malty flavor is somewhat honey-sweet and slightly spicy and hoppy. Texture is lively, fizzy and tingly."
"Notes: A great brett-ed saison. Lots of apple/stone fruit notes and good balance. Highly recommend."
"Poured this guy into a White Birch goblet. Thanks Andy for cracking this. Pours about two fingers of rocky white head and leaves attractive lacing on this golden beer. Smells yeasty and sour. Faint aromas of citrusy fruit such as grapefruit are present, but it isn't really prominent. This definitely has some funk. Not much in here to taste. Sour yeast. This actually kind of reminds me of a light beer that has a sourness added. Good mouthfeel, I like the lightness of the beer and the carbonation is good. Easy to drink and I wouldn't pass one up on a hot day, but not my favorite."
"D - Pretty easy to drink in this too hot and humid SC weather. I would pick this up again but wouldn't go nuts trying to find it."
"Tart and woody flavors are prevalent; the tannins, bitterness and mild sourness combine to form a flavor profile that brings to mind lemon and orange peels. It's light and refreshing, bone-dry, mildly astringent and quite musty and funky with a restrained pale malt flavor. The wild yeast and bacteria brings a lot of complexity to this light-bodied ale. Hops are present as well, herbal and zesty in character. It finishes with mild bitterness and lingering oaky astringency."
"22-oz bottle. A hazy golden color with a large rocky white head, highly carbonated , lots of jagged lacing left. Aroma is slightly yeasty, spicy with a bit of tartness. Flavor is slightly sour and yeasty, coriander and citrus with a hint of tangerine in the finish, not as sweet as other Saison I have had. Smooth. Light body with a crisp ,clean mouthfeel , and a dry finish. Very refreshing and sessionable , a very good beer."
"Cloudy light orange in color with some nice yeasty sediment swirling around. Small bubbly head. Oaky, sour aroma. Taste opens tart & funky, with a slightly dry and bittering finish. Tried this along side JP's Calabaza Blanca, which I preferred to this one, but still a very well-crafted beer."
"D - This is a very nice saison. I love the sour/bitter combo with just enough sweet caramel to make a very tasty Belgian-style ale."
"D - A good summer sippin' brew. A little to stanky and funky for a session brew, but I like that sourness for just a one-beer-only occasion. A very well made Saison that ain't quite up to par with the gold standard (Saison Du Pont), but still a very very well made brew."
"Gowler from Capone's. Poured a cloudy lemony gold with a one-finger head which quickly settled into a coating. Nose is lemon zest, apples, pears some floral tones and yeast. Mouthfeel is medium to thin, smooth with light carbonation. The taste was green apples, lemongrass, some funk for sure (but never overbearing) and definitely some earthy, grassy hay-like presence. There was a hint of pepper or spices there as well. Finish is a nice dry lingering citrus tartness. Taste along with the ABV make this a perfect summer sessionable refreshment."
"Unique. I had a couple of these; it was a really nice summer's night, with nowhere to be. Great memories, and probably the best saison-on-cask I've had."
"So much packed into such a small package. I'd love to see more beers like this out there. Strangely, though, I was expecting this to be a really refreshing beer, but actually found it be more of sipper due to it's complex, bracing, and sometimes overwhelming nature."
"D- low abv and lots of flavor. That's the way to go. I really like how its paired with the white mussels too."
"D: Very quaffable and neither the funk nor the tartness are overwhelming."
"Overall: I've been on a saison kick lately, and this ranks right up there. It's true to the style (dry; not sweet like American saisons/farmhouse ales seem to be) and exceedingly drinkable."
"Summary: I like the Saison style. This is an excellent example of one done right. Good job Jolly Pumpkin!"
"Mouthfeel brings a dry finish, typical of the style. Overall, this isn't a bad beer, but slightly disappointing when compared to some of the other Saisons I've had the opportunity to try recently"
"Well done JP, a very nice sessionable Saison in a 12oz serving."
"D: An excellent summer beer, perfect for sitting by the pool, goes down very easy, but not a simple beer. At the same time, I don't think I want a second one right now, I will definitely have more in the future. Highly recommended."
"D: Goes down easily, well blended, definitely one to drink while a touch cooler, room temperature brings out a strong acidity."
"D- I can drink this all day long. Excellent session (if you got the money), or a good beer to pair with a mexican number. Needless to say ill revisit this Bam Biere... cheers!!!"
"golden cloudy yellow beer with a big white head and a aromatic quality. citrus, coriandor, clove, mint chutney nose. sour finish. funky. earthy muskiness that is somewhere between hay in a barn and cider. floral quality that is almost bitter... in a way almost like the green skin of an orange. very light but very broad flavors. would be excellent with indian food."
"Overall, a very unique farmhouse ale. Give it a shot, if goes down quite easy regardless. Looking forward to trying more Jolly Pumpkin."
"Poured a capped 750 into my Dogfish Head snifter. This beer pours a cloudy straw yellow with a massive puff of bright white head that leaves lace Lorraine down the entirety of the glass. The aroma starts off with subtle note of pear and apple, followed by fresh cut hay and finishing with just a hint of bright lemon zest. Slight bretty earthiness to it. While I don't think Bam Biere is fermented with brett, I can smell just a hint. The flavor is very similar with unripe green apples and hard pears. Lemon zest cuts across the palate, a slight bit of grass and damp earth. I pick up hint of bretty funk. I wonder if maybe the barrels used might contain some bacterial remnants adding another layer of complexity to this beer. At the very end is a citric tartness that lingers on the palate. The mouthfeel is about perfect for this beer. Heavy carbonation lifts flavors off the palate almost scrubbing it for the next sip. The carbonation is very energetic and never over powering. Bam Biere finishes exactly the way I want a Saison to finish: very dry. In a day in age when breweries are trying to Imperialize everything, its refreshing to see a great beer at 4.5%. This could easily make it into my regular Saison drinking rotation."
"Tap at MI brewer's guild winter fest- Cloudy yellow body with a fairly thick white froth. Strong sweet pear and melon aromas are graceful and pleasing. Yeasty brett aromas compliment. FInishing aromas are basement/barnyard and citrus. Tart fruity flavours are paired up with a dirty, earthy mash and a solid brett presence. Dry finish, with tart pear afterflavours, left we wanting more"
"Lots of carbonation in the mouth. There is a lot of fruit character to this beer. More than expected with a slight aftertaste of grain. The fruit character is tropical, almost pineapple, mango. Second taste, medium bodied, drinkability OK. Its pretty good. Flavors seem to be off style slightly but its interesting."
"The citrus notes in the aroma and flavor reminds me of the grapefruit orchards in Florida. Overall, a well-made, smooth and refreshing farmhouse ale."
"Overall, I do like this beer and think it is easily drinkable but leaving room for improvements."
"it actually mixed well with one of their other beers (that has a more sour taste) and tasted quite good... if you want to try that... you might want to..."
"drinkability: great beer and top notch saison."
"Huge white rocky head quick to die down into the cloudy yellowish beer. Smells not verry impressive atleast to me supper sweet green apple, not a fan. Taste almost like the smell but I like it on the palete sweet/sour green apple I do like it no hops to speek of. Mouth about what I was expecting kinda wattery but not bad. Could drink a few of these but I think I wouldn't want to ever again, good thing I only have the one."
"Almost too light body on this one, feels almost a bit soapy in the mouth, carbonation was fitting with small hard bubbles, matching the dryness of the brew."
"I very much enjoyed this interpretation of an American Saison. Not so much spicy as fruity, and i think the oak contributes a surprisingly good note to this. Very unique and definitely worth a try."
"D: A very good saison sour hybrid by JP. Really their flagship beer and one of their best."
"Bottle from Louisville Beer Store: 1pt 9.4 fl oz batch 367/368. Sweet honey and barnyard brettanomyces with citrus fruit. Tall rocky white head that lingers and leaves lacing on the glass. Sweet malt, lemony citrus and bitter brett flavor that last into the long finish."
"In my recent saison kick, drinking beers new to me and beers already dear to me, this flagship offering from Jolly Pumpkin rates among the lowest. This is a solid farmhouse ale with plenty of merit but frankly doesn't warrant purchase in the same market as any one of Boulevard's three world-class saisons (let alone a market that also carries Saison Dupont and Fantome). Still, as my score indicates, this is a good saison."
"D: Considering the nicely complex but not intimidating flavor profile coupled with the lower ABV, it's a highly drinkable beer."
"Mahalo! Beertracker"
"Poured into tulip from bottle. Massive, massive head! About 2 inches I swear Hazy yellow, some sediment, good retention and lacing. Very sour/tart smell, some grain, and spice, but I keep getting the sour which I thought was fine. Taste is about the same. Some grain and general earthiness, yeast, some spices and a little tart to it. Pretty good I thought. Mouthfeel was very light, lots of carbonation and almost a little too thin. Would probably be refreshing on a hot summer day. Overall a good beer, not the most memorable but fine nevertheless."
"D - Not what I was hoping for after the nose. It's not terrible but definitely disappointing for the first Jolly Pumpkin. Maybe it's old?"
"Overall the look and the smell were fine. That's the only redeeming qualities of this beer. Never again. Drain pour city! I hate it when someone cracks a beer with you and it turns out horrible. Sorry Andy."
"D- A wonderfully complex, delicious and sessionable brew. Never would have guessed it to come from the US!!"
"It's been a while since I had either a saison or JP brew. The aftertaste was such that I wanted time to enjoy it but the dryness kept me coming back. A lovely version of one of my favorite styles."
"I really enjoyed this beer. The low abv makes this a great session beer. Would gladly buy more of this one."
"D - All day. If this beer was a bit more inexpensive, I would have this around all the time. Very refreshing, I imagine even more so during the summer months. Will try again a bit more fresh."
"Drinkability - 3.0/5.0 - ok, but nothing to write home about"
"D- Moderately high. An easy drink, but I took my time with this one to draw it all in. And I'm glad I did.. this is a very good beer and Jolly Pumpkin is 2 for 2 in my book!"
"(D)- At first, I didnt like this at all. The more I had of it the better it got if that makes sense. Primarily barnyard/prairie characteristics with a delicate citrus to it that make it an invigorating farmhouse that rolls off your tongue. Well done Jolly Pumpkin!"
"I have to say I started to feel less enthusiastic about this one as I went. I was kind of excited about a nice drinkable low ABV American Saison but this one just didn't do it for me. I'm not likely to purchase again."
"Very drinkable. Especially in the realm of sours. This would be a great one to get someone started into the world of sours."
"Notes: I had seen this in bottles and read about it here on BA many times. I was looking forward to trying it here on tap. It is a fine, artisan beer but it is too one dimensional for me."
"Bam Biere is a sour beer that could be widely appreciated."
"The aroma is this beer's high point, but I would recommend this beer to a Saison drinker on the strength of the aroma alone."
"D: Good beer. Highly refreshing and not a funky as some other JP beers can be. But that is not a bad thing either. Reminds me of carbonated, not-very-sweet lemonade. Fun and enjoyable."
"Conclusion: I was really looking forward to this, and I must say, I was a bit underwhelmed...I absolutely loved JP's Calabaza Blanca, but this was just a bit light on flavor, not quite providing the intensity the aromas suggest...I would probably not get this to drink again by itself unless I could get a fresher batch, but it did pair nicely with a crostini with mild goat cheese"
"This might be one of the best hot day beers I have in a while. The modest ABV makes this a great summer day session beer."
"Mouthfeel is creamy, silky, and effervescent all at once. Refreshingly light in the mouth. Drinkability is high for that reason, though some points are taken away for the tartness."
"D: I like this one, and in general I find Jolly Pumpkin's brett character quite pleasing. Perhaps Bam Bière can't compete with the best Belgian representatives of the style, but it's quite close."
"D: All the flavor you could ever ask for in a 4.5% beer."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable. First time I had this I was at the Jolly Pumpkin satalite brewery up in Traverse City Michigan. My father and brother-in-law got a pitcher of this and sat on the deck outside looking at lake Michigan through some tall pine trees. Extremely enjoyable in such a nice cool setting. This beer will always be associated with good times with family."
"D: Not my favorite farmhouse ale. I *can* drink it, but I'd prefer to be drinking something else."
"Considering how much I enjoy JP's other brews, I can't beleive how long I waited to try Bam. Another impressive offering from this impressive Michigan brewery."
"D: Weighing in under 5% with this flavor profile? It's hard to imagine. The ale is dirty and proud of it."
"This is a pretty solid saison - thanks T!"
"Drinkability: Well, it would take some getting used to as the flavor is off for someone who is new to the brett and sour aspects, but it's definitely not bad and the ABV is really quite low, so once I'm more comfortable with these flavors, I'd be able to get through a couple of pints of this without much problem."
"Flavor is light and bright, sparkling mouthfeel and gentle lasting finish. I could drink this all day. Very dry. Brett is pronounced but not overbearing... this is not a sour beer, just a dry, farmy one. Lovely."
"I do like that this beer has some funky flavor to it, but I wish it had slightly less of that taste and a touch more sweetness. I'm merely assuming that there's some Brett in this one, but that would account for the barnyard aroma, reasonable carbonation and thorough dryness. I'm giving it the thumbs up on taste and drinkability, and the double thumbs up on appearance. This is a beautiful beer to behold. Recommended."
"A hazy golden color pour with a huge rocky white head, highly carbonated , lots of jagged lacing left. Aroma is slightly yeasty, spicy with a bit of tartness. Flavor is slightly sour and yeasty, coriander and citrus with a hint of tangerine in the finish,not as sweet as other Saison I have had . Light body with a crisp ,clean mouthfeel , and a dry finish. Very refreshing and sessionable , a very good beer"
"Drinkability: Damn tasty beer. A good session beer on a nice summer day."
"I like this one, just not as much as the other two I've had so far. I really want to try La Roja soon, I just have to find it first."
"D - A winner, for sure. I could definitely drink another one, especially with the low alcohol content - can you say ""session beer?"" I would love to try this with a fresh goat's milk cheese or a duck confit salad. This is an exceptionally well-balanced and well-made saison."
"The drink is on the light side of medium-bodied with excellent, fine-grained carbonation. Quite tasty and sporting a conservatively manageable 4.5% ABV, Bam Biere is plenty quaffable."
"This beer poured a slightly hazy, golden color with strong carbonation, and tall, fluffy, pillowy, white foam that persisted. The smell was a strong ""saison"" aroma with a slight tartness, a touch of yeast, and a bit of wildness (though not sour wildness). The taste was on the tart side, lightly sour. Thin flavor overall, with some hops coming out in the finish. The mouthfeel was thin with light body and good carbonation. Lightly sour and bitter flavors lingered. This was ok, though thin and on the sour side. 12 oz bottle."
"This is without any doubt a very drinkable brew. And the lower level of alcohol really makes me understand this being a style popular among the Belgian farmers while they were working in the fields during the summer. But it is also a very expensive one (SEK 120), which makes it a difficult for me to give the highest score."
"This is a great Saison. Easy and smooth to drink with plenty of character. Perfect for the summer or anytime as the style should be. Highly recommended."
"Taste: Sour and sweet upfront, followed by a little bitterness and dryness."
"D= great. At 4.5% this can't be beat. Great beer. Ill be drinking it again. Very unique twist on a farmhouse saison. Good."
"Notes: I bet this would be a great breakfast beer, as it has some nice mimosa qualities. I can see the ladies asking for an orange wedge with it, Oberon-style."
"THIS is a session ale, right here, goes down like soda but is a full flavored, full bodied beer."
"A little too bitter just something doesn't hit me quite right."
"Drinkability: Acceptable, but the $10 I paid seems a bit excessive. Alcohol content is very low. Good taste, but expensive."
"Drinkability was a plus. I had this after being outside in the sun for several hours and it was very refreshing."
"D: It's sweet, light and bitter. A very refreshing beer for a hot day."
"This beer pours a nice hazy blonde with yeasties o-plenty, per the style. The smell is fruity, funky and sour. Taste - blech! This is a drain pour. It has to be ruined somehow. I know farmhouses are funky, but this is nasty. Something has gone awry - terribly awry. At least, that is my hope. Surely this can't be right. The carbonation is fine, but the taste - a rotting fruit, that is both sickening and overly sour - makes this undrinkable. Super dry, and ending with a nasty metallic taste. Ugh... I will have to try another one. This one blows chunks."
"Very crisp and refreshing with a cotton mouth dry finish. Feel is probably on the lighter side of medium. High carbonation, but it's appropriate. Tons of tiny bubbles sting the tongue nicely. Highly drinkable."
"D - Just about as drinkable as you can get for a funky saison I love Jolly Pumpkin brews and this one is no different worth trying sometime"
"D: Ok, would be better maybe on a hot summer day. A decent lawnmower beer perhaps."
"D - Easily drinkable, refreshing level of tartness that would allow this beer to be easily quaffable."
"D - This beer had a good taste to it, I like the taste of this beer, but it wasn't a favorite of mine, it takes a hit because of the price, but it was a good Saison"
"D- Easy to drink and a good example of the style."
"On-tap at the Blue Tractor in Ann Arbor, MI as their ""seasonal"". A delightful brew, and perhaps better than all their own brewpub offerings (oy!). It poured a cloudy coppery golden with a white head. It smelled of some really nice fruits which I could only guess were a mix of apricots, pears, and a little pumpkin. The taste was also a nice sweet fruitiness comprised of some undetermined gentle fruits. It had a nice, medium body and was very drinkable. I liked this brew quite a bit and would recommend it for sure."
"Overall: Not what I expected in this beer, but very good. The mouthfeel was a bit better than okay, it could have used a bit more carbonation IMO. It's not extremely drinkable but a single bottle is easy to do. Very good beer overall."
"Drinkability: Not bad, one of the more aggressive Saisons I've tried in awhile but definitely my style. I dig the Brett funk."
"With a brewery name like Jolly Pumpkin I expected a lot more out of this beer. Their other beers look crative too, so I was excited to try something from this brewery while I was in the Detroit area. The beer is really light in color and you hardly notice you are drinking it. It might be a great session beer, a great post-lawn mowing brew, but it didn't hold up as a single pint. Maybe the least tasty saison I have ever had. It's not an awful beer, there just isn't much there."
"Very sessionable beer at 4.5% abv. Not filling either. The tart/sour flavors may not be right for everybody, but they aren't overpowering. This is my first offering from Jolly Pumpkin and I would like to try others. For the style, I think Ommegang Hennepin is a little better."
"Very good."
"Slightly puckeringly sour, but not a tart sourness like I expected. More like a musty sourness. Has a citrusy, bluesy feel to it, almost like fresh lemon. Lightly hopped, leave a bit of soapiness in the finish, but not much at all. Nicely spiced, adds consistency throughout, flavor without being overpowering. Very dry, with a funky coating left after. Hard to put into words. Nicely carbonated, but while the taste is right there, it just feels thin throughout. Very drinkable, and for me, the sourness only enhances the allure. Overall, while I don't have a lot of experience with farmhouse ales, this one seems like it is a pretty good representation for a while. Very nice if you want something low in alcohol to relax with, and if you're looking to try something different."
"Has a clean brett taste (if that makes any sense). Pretty stylistically saison, reminds me a bit of Fantome. Not really all that sour but hints at it with some delicate lemony tartness and a bit of rotting oak log flavor. This one is dry as hell and as refreshing as JP probably gets. Light bodied and delicious. Would have no problem finishing a whole 750 of this. A must try for fans of JP or wild ales in general."
"Can't wait to try the Bam Noir Dark Farmhouse Ale I've got."
"This beer poured a nice-looking hazy yellow/golden color with a generous, frothy white head that dissipated quickly. It has a sour citrusy aroma that I found refreshing. The taste was very nice. It has a spicey, sour, and citrus taste to it. The mouthfeel is good, this is light and fizzy. This is a very refreshing beer that would be great in the summer."
"I had never heard Jolly Pumpkin before. I like this beer overall and will be trying other brews from JP."
"I'd drink again, tho I'd have to be in the mood for a much more sour version of a saison so would have to definite be eating with some goat cheeses and the like- good for a brunch meal or apertif."
"This is a very drinkable beer and a very refreshing one at that. Another good beer from Jolly Pumpkin."
"D: very drinkable. Low abv leads to a very drinkable beer."
"M- very carbonated but doesn't feel fizzy."
"Ok, I love sour beers, but this is now my favorite saison. I always loved Fantome since it was one of the more 'sour' saisons, but Bam Biere reigns supreme for me now. If I was a Belgian farmhand working in the fields in the summer, this is what I'd reach for."
"batch 311/312. hazy golden with a big white head, lots of lace and very good retention. what more can you ask for really? nose is lemon, lemon zest, white pepper, a touch of sweet tea, and white pepper. taste is very well balanced with a touch of sour funkiness coming through, especially as it warms up, as well as a faint, faint touch of clove. i wish it had more oomph, and a little fuller body, but i'm a saison snob, and very very hard to impress as far as saisons go. dry hopping does it well. long finish with lemony hoppy goodness lingering long after the beer is down the tubes. my first jolly pumkin beer, and i am impressed. i'll be after the whole line now. good job pumpkins!!!"
"Drinkability- fair."
"Batch #224. Pours opaque, hazy orange with a large white head. Nice retention and lacing. Smells like a saison should: sour, leathery yeast aromas, light citrus esters, and some floral hops in the background. The taste is slightly sour, with a good deal of earthiness coming forward as well. This is all balanced by a hint of sweetness and a lightly bitter finish. The mouthfeel is a bit lacking; it's surprisingly not very highly carbonated at all, though this could be due to the age and storage conditions. Overall, this is a very nice beer; probably the most authentic saison from the States."
"Mouthfeel is full with a slight sour bite and a breath of alcohol."
"D - One of the better and more enjoyable saisons that I have had. Not to strong and easy to drink. The funk could be overwhelming to some but if you enjoy saisons I think it is near perfect."
"Crisp apple and honey, good wet mouthfeel, with a great earthy brett characteristic. Downright tasty and incredibly drinkable. At 4.5% I can drink this one all night!"
"Poured a semi- clouded yellow with a white fluffy head that descends to a lasting swirled cover. A tad bit of lacing sticks to the side of the chalice style glass. The smell is an herbal and spicy mustiness with a tart note. The taste has a citrus tang with some mustiness and herbal spicing. Has a nice dry finish that I believe has a subtle hop note. The light-to-medium mouthfeel is light in feel and carbonation. A fairly complex beer, most Jolly Pumpkin beers are. This is another great example of their great brewing skills."
"Poured this ale into an oversized wine glass. Appearance is orangy golden, cloudy with a champagne-type 3-finger head. Smell is strong of citrus--mainly orange--along with apricot, apple and spices. Taste is very strong of orange and apricot, earthy. Mouthfeel is really carbonated and crisp. This is a very impressive Saison that's defined by its rich taste and unique aroma."
"Reviewed on 4/1/08. Bottle. Poured a golden yellow with a thick, creamy white head that persisted. Aroma and taste of lambic funk, lemon, spices. I think this was the perfect blend of sweet lemon and sour lambic funk. I haven't had many saisons before so I don't have much to compare this to, but I think this is an excellent beer! Very underrated. 8/4/9/5/16 (4.2/5)"
"Pours a golden yellow, slightly orange color with big, foamy white head. Aroma of citrus, apple, orange peel, lemon, alochol and hops. Flavor is filled with fruit especially citrus fruits such as lemon and orange. Hints of apple, hops and sweet spices with a mild alcohol presence."
"Pours a golden color with thin, very bubbly champagne like two finger head. Lemony, grassy aroma hits the nose upon first smell. Lots of carbonation and tingling as it hits the tastebuds. Very lively beer to say the least. Drinkability is very high. I am a big fan of the farmhouse/saison style so it came as no surprise that I enjoy this. I never had it fresh, but would like to and compare notes. Overall a decent representation of the style. I would reccommend this beer to fans of farmhouse ales."
"light, spritzy, heavily carbonated feel; mouthfeel is champagne-like as well. a bit of lemony sour apple with a yeasty finish and a slight spicy bite. fantastic drinkability. it doesn't blow you away, but i don't think any saison that meets the style would anyway. very enjoyable."
"Pours hazy gold with a meringue-type rocky head. Aroma isn't as funky as I expected, but you can tell that there is something going on underneath the typical saison aromas--- hay, tart fruit, subdued spices. The flavor is a bit sour, with almost no sweetness coming or going. The finish is dry, with a lingering spice. Had this with a spice thai noodle dish and it went very well with it."
"overall, a pretty tasty beer that is well suited for the summer months."
"Pours a pretty golden orange color with a big fluffy, sticky white head. Lots of fruit notes going on in the nose, lemon, lime, grapefruit skin slightly tart and acidic great use of the funk in this one. It does come on a bit strong though, not overly sour but overly funked, if that makes any sense. Pale malts are obviously very important here as well as dry grassy, earthy hops, lemon pulp, tart onions and hay. Highly carbonated and very drinkable, i had this bottle fresh and i think 'll wait 4-6 months to crack the other to see how the funk is doing"
"This was my first offering by JP, and won't be my last. I think next I will be moving onto Oro de Calabaza."
"seems a lot like watered down lemon cough syrup, and not very good cough syrup. i gave it a chance and sipped it for half an hour, but for the most part ... yuck."
"D: Light and refreshing beer. A decent offering, but certainly not one of the better saisons around."
"I had something from Jolly Pumpking recently which was intoxicating, but the Bam and La Roja haven't quite lived up to that standard but are still quite enjoyable if more subdued, less sour/aggressive."
"Overall very fun and very drinkable."
"Eric"
"D: This is an easy to drink beer once it warms, but it does have a lot of wine-like characteristics."
"Very light, easy to put down, at times a bit thin, but it has an amazing amount of flavor for such a low ABV: it starts earthy, goes grassy and somewhat bitter with a lively carbonation; spices abound, and fruits come and go, particularly citrusy. A bit more body and depth would go a long way, but would compromise the drinkability. A very good summer beer."
"Beer is too subjective to demand- but take a second lap if you pass this one in the store. It is just Bam good."
"Bam Biere pours a pale hazy yellow with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is apple, pear and funk. This beer is very highly carbonated. The flavor is also apple and pear with just a hint of funk. Very light, very drinkable and considerably better than I expected."
"A unique Saison, that pulls a bit tarter than I would normally like, this never goes overboard and stays quite smooth and drinkable on cask. Nice."
"When all is said and done, this was an easily drinkable brew, although I prefer JP's other offerings more. Worth a try if you see it somewhere however."
"It has the characteristics of the style, and they work well together. Pretty complex, in a subtle way, with a lingering lemon zest. Modest abv for style."
"Bam goes down easy and quick, and it's no wonder. It offers a heady explosion of taste and aroma and is an awesome American example of a difficult to emulate and near impossible to perfect Belgian style. More please!"
"First off, I love Jolly Pumpkin ales but unfortunately this was not a strong offering. Appearance is cloudy yellow-gold with a massive rocky white head. Aroma is of lemons, saltines, and that distinct tart aroma of lactic bacteria. Tasting this beer was like biting into a lemon wedge but not quite as sour or tart. Mouthfeel is medium light and way too thin for a saison and there's a distinct flavor of lactic bacteria which is also off for the style. I could not smell, taste or detect any hops at all because of the sourness and tartness. Finish is harsh and the effevescent carbonation actually intensifies the off-flavors as I swallow the beer. Clearly a cross-contamination happened here, but it won't stop me from reaching for a Jolly Pumpkin beer. I'll just select a different beer from their line-up."
"D: Assuming you like aggressively carbonated sour beers this one would get high marks here. Too bad I do not care much for that."
"Single bottle, wish I had picked up a couple more since it would have been nice to sip on a few throughout the evening. Pours a cloudy bright yellow-orange with an enormous fluffy white head. Agitated the yeast and dumped it on top creating a light brown sprinkling on top of the head that swirled nicely. Aroma is pleasant somewhat spicy and very yeasty could be more prominent. Mouthfeel is alright nothing great very crisp but a tad thin for my liking. Flavor is right in line with the saisson style. There is a mild peppery spicy flavor backed with some light fruitiness, lightly hopped this beer seemed well balanced and it is very drinkable. Yes I wish I had a couple more to enjoy."
"Opinion: I actually like this beer quite a bit. I think that it is probably more typical of a classic ""farmhouse ale"" than most commercial examples today because they were traditionally kept in barrels where they would take on a bit of a ""wild"" character while aging. This is not a beer that you can sit down and drink a whole six-pack of, but the flavors and aromas are so complex that it would definitely be a welcomed treat occasionally if it were available regularly here."
"Into a Val-Dieu chalice, this beer is a pale straw-gold color, quite hazy, with a nice initial head, though it fades quick. Big aroma with lots of grassy hops and spicy yeastiness. Initial fruity, moderately hoppy taste quickly gives way to a quite tart sourness. Is that supposed to be there? It's interesting, but not what I expect from a saison. I'd like to taste some other things here as well, but the sourness is quite overpowering."
"Overall I didn't enjoy this brew too much. The flavors I thought should be brought out more were masked by the less pleasant qualities."
"Overall I haven't had too many beers of this style, but this is pretty unique and pleasant."
"The beer pours cloudy golden with a good white head. But what really stands out is a unique sour citrusy taste and feel. Have had this beer on several occassions, and found it more enjoyable each time -- the proverbial acquired taste. Every beer has its place, and for me this one is best had occassionally lest the singular character becomes too routine."
"D: This is one fine beer. A bit expensive at 11 bucks plus for a sixer, but well worth it. I could drink this beer all day, wonderfully complex but also boldly argressive in character this is a quintessential summertime beer. What are you waiting for go pick some up right now!"
"interesting, but not sure i'd try again for the price. classification as a ""saison"" is kinda questionable, but then again, what else does one classify it as?"
"The result is a pale straw ale with sustained carbonation and fragmented head and lace. It tastes like wheat and old hops with a light sprinkling of pepper. An elegant table beer with a friendly bite."
"Taste is spicy, ginger and peppery. Clear notes of cork and phenols. Quite a remarkable yeast this is. Bitterness is light and malt is pilsnerlike and has some straw notes. Drinkability is great, it's 4,5% really makes this beer a thirst quencher. Great beer!"
"D: Very drinkable. Going down almost too smoothe on this hot July night."
"I'll drink it again. Great summer beer."
"Tastes are clean grains that are slightly husky with herbal hops and spiced yeast, but there are transitions of a slight metallic note here and there that throws everything off a bit. There are also some clean citrus hops notes as well but they are very slight. Hints of funk and spice in the finish but it drys out a bit as it should but there are just some classic Saison notes that are missing here. Overall it's a decent take on the style but not on my short list."
"D - To sweet and sour for me, this was hard to finish."
"Drinkability- Better on tap than in the bottle in terms of drinkable sweetness."
"D: More like a lambic/gueze. A sipper and one & done."
"from it's injury. Interesting stuff here."
"The beer itself is pretty smooth, a first watery taste hits you slowly, followed by tastes of apples, especially green apples, then tartness comes in with sourness added with a shy hoppy ensemble which ends up with some hints of spices."
"D - if I could I would have a stockpile of this beer in my cellar all summer long..ubur-refreshing, and very drinkable.."
"4.5% with this much flavor? It's amasing! I'd have this on hand all summer long if I could... perfect for hot summer day BBQ."
"This isn't one I will seek on a regular basis, but I will buy it again. It is a nice change of pace from what I am used to, and I look forward to trying other saisons and Brett beers."
"WOW, popped the top on this at about 48* seconds later i had a 1""+ foam finger sticking straight up out the bottle and even with a gentle pour could only fill my snifter 1/2 way with cloudy pale yellow beer before the giant rock of foam crept dangerously close to the rim then continued until it was a whopping 6"" higher than my glass, yet never spilled over ; a modest smell, sourish w/ green fruit & woody sweatsocks ; a thin, tart flavor, a bit too bitter initially helping to mask the complex taste, all i taste is a cheesy brett ""twang"" and a bit of earthy hops in this one, finishes dry and tart ; extremely dry w/ a an almost too light body and tons of carbonation ; a drinkable brew, contains the ""jolly pumpkin flavor components"" but again a bit ""watery"" overall"
"D- At first my thought was no way, but the funk definitely grows on you. Perhaps not as refreshing as other summer beers, but definitely enjoyable."
"Mouthfeel is light and dry with a crisp carbonation. A tad filling. A very good offering."
"LOL prosit baby. MK"
"Take that out and the rating goes higher, like cheech and chong."
"Very drinkable, but the complexity screams for attention rather than a lazy after of yard work. The beer is similar to one of my music history professor's explanation of Bach in that you don't do the dishes and listen to Bach. You sit down and pay attention to Bach. Bam biere is similar in that there's too much depth and complexity not to sit down and pay attention to your drink."
"1 pint 9.4 oz bottle poured into a tulip glass. Pours a golden orange color with a massive white head formed from the high levels of carbonation. The aroma is a little tart and floral notes with some malt and a good dose of barnyard funk. Wow, the aroma is definitely on the funky side with a lot of Brett. The taste is funky much like the aroma with some spices and a dry spicy finish. The mouthfeel is a little thin for my liking, but doesn't detract from the brew too much. Overall, Bam Biere is another solid offering from Jolly Pumkin that is highly recommended for any saison lover."
"Still, a decent offering."
"Not as good as a Hennepin but this beer stands up on its' own for what it is. A great session saison!"
"Pours a yellow with ever so slight haze and tiny orangeness with good fluffy white head. Nose is brett funk horseblanket. Taste is also funky. I like it, but it is not familiar to my saison taste buds. It has a lambicish tartness on the finish. Mouthfeel is ok, but nothing special. Drinkability is ok, but defenitely not what a good saison should be. I like it, but it is a bit too tart for a saison, and lacking some of the typical saison flavors. good beer, just a little style defiant. This one is defenitely one of the funkiest saisons out there, so much so, that it is borderline wild ale, and more like a wild BSGA than a wild Saison, IMO. One I will revisit. Very good brew."
"Received as extra from northernbrews (thanks Jeff). No freshness dating on bottle. Served in my Ommegang 10th anniversary glass. Poured a hazy straw-gold. Some effervescence present in solution as well as some particles of yeast. Rocky inch and a half head rose just below the lip of the glass before eventually settling into a thin layer of foam about halfway through the session. Lingering streamers of lacing with good adherence. Scent of citrus, green apple, yeast and lots of funk (similar to the smell of VT in the spring if you get my meaning). Taste is a little more subdued. Mild peppery flavor, as well as corriander and grapefruit. Lively mouthfeel with a mild burn across the roof of the mouth and a bit of a citrus pucker at the finish. Decent drinkability, but there are better representations of the style out there."
"It's okay. I vastly prefer Hennepin to this. The lack of complexity hurts this one. I'd like it to finish a little drier too. This is not the type of beer I'd want to drink several of, so the relatively low abv doesn't work to its advantage much. I'd like it better if it was beefed up. In my mind it completely falls flat in terms of body, and it doesn't work for me. A lot of reviewers like it though, so probably worth picking a single or two up sometime."
"I wasn't blown away by my first Jolly Pumpkin experience, but I'd definitely like to pursue their beers further. As it stands, Bam Biere is a nice saison in it's own right and is certainly worth trying."
"Pours a murky golden brown color with an explosive pure white head (ala Duvel), that left plenty of soapy lacing on the glass. The smell is of spice and that barnyard funk, lemon and green apple tartness, white pepper. The taste disappoints a bit. Lemon and green apple are the fore-front flavors, with light traditional farm-house spice flavors in the end. The feel is light and nicely carbonated, finishes sweet and tart for a nice balance. Flavor wise not even close to the best saison. But a saison in a sixer and at 4.5ABV, that is nice. Definitely would keep these around for a session or a change of pace brew."
"Bold and assertive flavor in a small beer...a perfect fit for the jack russell mascot on the bottle."
"I would seek this out again, without question."
"I could drink more of this in one sitting I think so I'll definitely try it again if I get the chance."
"Overall, this is a refreshing and approachable farmhouse ale, and another solid brew from Jolly Pumpkin"
"D: decent drinkability, much better examples out there. moderatly enjoyable."
"D: Definitely drinkable as a session beer - not a high alcohol beer. Probably not a favorite for many beer drinkers - seems more like a good summer/hot weather beer. I like the spin that this brewery puts on different beer styles."
"Be warned pour this beer very slowly as it is very carbonated and the head jumps right out of the glass. A rocky off white head has nice staying power and easily reaches three fingers. Scattered lace is all over the glass. Body is a golden orange haze. Nose is a nice mix of lemon zest, spice, mellon and honey suckle. First sip brings a unique mix of piney hoppy bitter and shrill soured balancing the bitter. There is a fresh crispness to the mouthfeel of this brew. A pickled feel and a bit of a mineral feel also exist on the tongue. Farmhouse ale seems to be pretty bready as it has attributes of a pilsner, pale ale and flemish sour ale. Sour spicey hue sits on the mouth long after the sip. This beer is easy to drink but could really use a hint of malt to balance better."
"D: A little too carbonated for me to drink more than a glass of in one sitting."
"A very good brew indeed."
"D: very easy to drink however the large amount of carbonation is accumulating causing large sporadic releases of deep bellowing belches throughout the room. Overall a very different enjoyable experience of a great tasting beer."
"Microscopic carbonation washes everything away a bit quickly, but makes this beer an outstanding companion to spicier foods. The palate may not quite live up to the nose, but I can't think of many beers that could. Drinkability is off the charts with food, and just fine for a session."
"First Jolly Pumpkin beer and pretty good, look forward to trying all the other ones I currently have, especially the Noel de Calabaza, would drink this again when in the mood for a saison even though I do not consider this like any other farmhouse beer I have had in the past, could definitely tell it was bottle conditioned and could have passed a mild gueuze or wild ale in my opinion, unqiue and worth a try"
"A little overcarbonated, nice medium-light body, dry finish. Quite quaffable."
"Drinkibility/Overall: A mellower rendition of Oro De Calabaza. A little funky, even for a saison, but an interesting and fun beer from an innovative brewery."
"Verdict: Decent at best. I don't expect a saison/farmhouse ale to be sour though. This still captures the essence of that style but based on the other saisons I've had recently, I wouldn't recommend it to a first-timer to the style."
"Pretty good all around every sip gives a new taste. I've only had maybe 9-10 saisons in my day and none anytime in the last 6 months... This one strikes me as not as complex as some of the European counterparts ... but for the money, Bam Biere is pretty damn good... plus I love the Coop is carrying it in 12's."
"Drinkability: This is one great brew. I intend of having more of these in the future."
"My first Jolly Pumpkin brew... Copped a single 12 oz bottle from Oak Tree in South Plainfield... one thing that can be said about this beer is that this is an extremely unique and different sample from anything I've ever tried, let alone a Saison... the taste was very distinct and one that you will remember... Best thing about this one was the incredible appearance, with a hazy, cloudy, citrus-color with a gigantic foamy and frothy head that boasted amazing staying power... a full, five-finger head for sure... smell was rich, full of citrus, lemon, and pepper... taste very much complemented the smell, with strong lemon and pepper notes that were very strong and noticeable... mouthfeel was pretty good, and drinkability was average due to the strong conglomeration of flavors... the interesting thing about this beer was the fact that despite a relatively modest ABV of 4.5%, the beer still exploded with flavor and character... Certainly worth a try... A light, yet flavorful easy-going beer... Recommended..."
"Served in a chalice, the beer pours a cloudy yellow/hay color with about a half inch white head. Lacing and head retention are both good. It smells like tart pears and apples, funk, lemon, and an earthy aroma. The aroma overall is tart and sour, pretty much what I expected. Taste is the same as the aroma, it's tart and sour, and finishes tart/bitter. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's smooth with good carbonation and a dry finish. Drinkability is good, but I don't think I could session this just because of the tartness. But I could have 2-3 of these at a time. Overall I think it's a good beer, and Jolly Pumpkin is starting to become one of my favorite breweries."
"This beer has impressed me greatly. It is light yet complex, and drinkability is through the roof. I could enjoy this beer anytime. It's very fine."
"I had this out of a 12oz bottle poured in to a goblet, woth a golden haze and quickly dissapating white head. There was a huge funky bouquet of clay, hay, earth, and wet cat. The body was a bit light but there was plenty of flavor to make up for. Bam was plenty spicy with lots of peper and coriander and nice citric hop flavor in the aftertase, tinged but a bit of sourness. enjoyable i need to try more of there beers."
"Fair (at best) drinkability. Certainly not a beer devoid of character, just not a great interpretation of the style, overall."
"D- It is pretty good. Don't think it's anything to go crazy over but it is a decent saison."
"Poured into a Duvel tulip. Golden straw coloured with a massive chunky white head. Nose- fantastic smell of wood and vinegar sourness. Creates a pavlovian reaction in my mouth as I'm drooling to get into this beer. Taste- very subtle brew, citrus sourness, with light pale malts. Woody dryness, but still a juicy tanginess. Wonderfully crafted and amazingly flavourful for <5% beer. Mouthfeel is light bodies, but still has a creamy texture. Drinkability is through the roof. I could drink pail after pail of this stuff. One of my favourite beers."
"A very drinkable Saison for sure and one to try if you haven't already."
"Tastes of citric hops, pepper, some yeasty tang and earthy. The mouthfeel was a bit on the thin side (IMO)."
"Pours a clouded gold with a quarter inch white head that stays. Nose is kind of mild with a slight yeast presence. Flavor is very smooth and traditional saison. Feel is a little less meaty than I like, but still fairly good. Extremely drinkable. A damn good saison, and an American produced one at that."
"By all means, seek this one out. You won't regret it!"
"Body is light and the carbonation is expansive, giving it a fluffy mouthfeel and airey texture. A session Saison?"
"Overall, I find this Saison a treat to drink and quite sessionable. I'd drink it again, no problem. Thanks again, John!"
"D- Delicious and complex, just what I expected out of this beer."
"Pours a great white head that leaves a great lacing behind and leaves the head still sitting there. Color is gold and very clear. The smell is sour and gueuze like, slightly fruity, and light. The first thing I noticed was the high carbonation on the mouth, almost soda like. The flavor is lighter than the smell and more wheat-like at the end. The sour flavor is very subdued and nice. Very drinkable, but hard to find. This one cost me $14/six pack."
"Taste is pretty sour, very dry. Some may call this one-dimensional, and maybe it is, but i just love the way it tastes. Mouthfeel is very light, pretty high carbonation. Low alcohol and light body make this a drinkable brew, but far from sessionable because of the huge sourness. I got mine for $2.25 and it is a steal at that price."
"Drinkability is good too. A nice beer that is interesting to taste. But something about this doesn't really taste right to me. Seems like it should be in the American Wild Ale category, instead of Saison. But with that said, it's still worth a try, and really easy to drink, almost sessionable with the low ABV."
"D: It's very interesting... I know it's not going to be something that I drink very often but I really would like to try a few different saisons, still. Local 1 comes to mind but there's no way I'm gonna crack open a 750."
"I poured this into my Duvel tulip and it almost looked like a Duvel. Hazy golden coloring with a chimney of carbonation rising like crazy through the center producing an amazing white head. The head very slowly beings to fall and become more dense and it leaves rocky chunks that don't move for the rest of the drink. The lacing that sticks to the sides also stays in place of the entire time. The smell is very full and rich with metallic, rubbery hops, spicy cloves, rich citrus, and sticky sweet candi sugar. The taste is completely different than the smell: The flavor is much more delicate and thin than the sticky sweet smell. There is a Co2 tastes that comes from the wild carbonation that is backed and twisted with the metallic Belgian hop addition. The first thing this reminded me of was when I had my Saison DuPont last month. I could also see similarities with this beer and Orval, minus the Orval Brett funk. One of the best things about this beer is that it is a session saison. These are so hard to come by. The price is a little steep, but it tastes like more expensive imports to me. A true fit to the authentic Belgian Saison style."
"Hazy gold color, well carbonated, with an airy white head that thickens up as it settles, leaving behind sticky strings of lace. Smells delicate but funky...lemony and sour. Apple and lemon flavors along with a fine sweetness and yeast. The sourness makes things interesting. Lots of flavor for such a ""little"" beer. Light bodied, effervescent, refreshing, slightly tart, with a dry finish. I could drink many."
"Drinkability: I tend to like funky beers but can't drink a lot of them because of what the sourness does to me. This one has a nice level of funk. I personally wouldn't calssify it as a farmhouse ale, but would come up with new names or styles. Let's call a spade a spade and a spade this aint."
"It may not be truly special, but it doesn't want for personality. It's zesty and cheeky, if a bit halting in spots. So each sip is a nice precursor to the next. And the clean, crisp finish leads to an easy drinking presentation. It may not be about delivering on a lot of anticipation, but it does end well."
"I bought this bottle at Murray's Wine & Spirits ""going out of business"" sale."
"D: Very refreshing. I love Jolly Pumpkin's beers and this is an excellent component of their line up!"
"This is not my style and it is also not the best of this style, imho."
"Opening the bottle and allowing it to sit for a few hours before drinking might tame the carbonation a bit."
"D,notes: Of the Jolly Pumpkin's I have tried this is my favorite. Excellent balance between tart/sourness and malt. complex. Really good mouthfeel. For a sour leaning beer good drinkability."
"Great Saison, and this is from a guy that doesn't do saisons."
"[Served in a bulb]"
"ooh, that's tart. but not dry. up front it is quite acidicway more than a true saison should be, i suppose. truth is, however, i don't think capt. spooky gives a damn. like everything else he makes, this is a fine beer. it is not particularly dry and hops play a morethanminor role (aroma: musty and lemon, flavor: detectable bitterness and more of that continental zing)"
"Poured into a SABL glass a hazy pale orange with a frothy cappuccino head that slowly faded and left spotty lacing. Aroma is sweet malt and Belgian yeast with a hint of spice. The taste is sweet fruit, spice, and some citrus notes. Coriander and orange peel show through in the taste as well. The beer is extremely light and crisp with decent carbonation, just enough to help it go down very smooth. I'm sure those French farmhouse workers would have loved this one! This is a very good representation of the lighter side of this style, extremely refreshing!"
"Poured into a weizen glass. Color was a cloudy amber with a white thick foamy head. Aroma was slightly wheaty, and slightly fruity. Taste was fruity, reminded me of a sweet, slightly dry apple cider. There was a tinge of bitterness, but not very noticeable. Mouthfeel was disappointing. The beer clung to the inside of my mouth like an overly sweet fruit juice. Beyond that, it was pleasant to drink."
"The beer pours a cloudy gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a refreshingly fruity scent of yeast esters and spices. It's a bit tart, but nothing over the top. The taste is good. It has a dry earthy pale malt and yeast flavor. It goes down easy and finishes peppery with a mild tartness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good drinking beer. I love the aroma. Also, the hops in the finish add a nice complexity to the palate. It's light and fruity with just the right amount of earthiness."
"Pours a cloudy golden yellow with a giant white foamy head. The head is HUGE,lasts forever,and leaves very good lacing. The smell is pungent with lemon,grass,citrus,wheat,and banana. The taste is like the smell,floral,lemon,sweet grass,with some bitter hops.l. The m/f is light with the flavors not mixing all that well. This beer has it's moments,but all in all you can do alot better with other Saisons"
"Bottle. Pours a cloudy, golden color with a large, fluffy, long lasting white head. Aroma is peppery and yeasty, maybe a touch of citrus. Spicy flavor, lemony, malty, a little sour ( it is a Jolly Pumpkin afterall !!!!), very clean. Nice carbonation."
"This isn't a bad saison overall, but I'd call it a second tier representation of the style. It's solid all around but just doesn't wow you anywhere except for the appearance. That said, I enjoyed it overall and would be happy to have it again."
"The smell is of a sour fruit to my nose. The flavor is light on the tongue a little hoppy but a soft balance between the spicy malts and hops. It seems to have a dry mouthfeel. Not an expert in this style but it is a good beer."
"The beer sort of moves from earthy and bready into sour and puckering with a touch of bitterness, finishing fruity and refreshing. Very crisp and peppery, medium body, little bit more than moderate carbonation. The beer is outstanding, but it's a little puckerish for mass consumption I'd say. I'd love to try this again, but I think I'd rather share a bottle with someone next time. It can be a little much after a while."
"Drinkability- Huge disappointment!! After having Jolly Pumpkin La Roja I expected more from this beer. I'm hoping that maybe I got a bad beer which is very possible. I'll change my review if I can find one that is fresh. There is no date on the beer at all so I cannot tell freshness."
"D - Extremely drinkable beer. The sulphur in the nose is a little off putting at first (and it was stronger in one bottle than the others), but once you get used to it, it is all-right. Not the most complex saison, but a nice, bright and refreshing example."
"M&D - a very dry beer, it has a bit of bitterness that makes this a great beer to pair with food, but different on its own, overall though very nice beer"
"Well done for the lighter Saison...."
"D- Decent Saison. I look foreward to trying more brews from Jolly Pumpkin. Something I will probably have again."
"Lively carbonation, perfect body and lovely, bitter astringency on the finish. I'm starting to think that Jolly Pumpkin is at the very least the most exciting brewery in the Midwest if not the best. Completely drinkable in every way and if it weren't so damn expensive I'd have it in my fridge all the time. Other BA's seem not to be very impressed? Oh, well, more for me!"
"It's certainly an interesting creation, with some traits reminiscent of a gueuze, primarily its Bretty funk-derived brutal dryness. Like many of the Jolly Pumpkin's I've tried, it's merely a novel, and flawed, idea."
"This beer pours a translucent orange color with a thick and fluffy white head that dissipates slowly. Spotty lacing. The aroma is grassy and yeasty, and a friend mentioned that it also smelled like an opened packet of ketchup which is 100% true. Light-bodied with flavors of apple and citrus, plus yeast and spices. The finish is tart and fruity with a lingering spice character. Refreshing and good all around."
"ORIGINAL - 4.5/4/1/3.5/1 - I really wanted to like this one - Jolly Pumpkin's a local and one I'd heard good things about. Sadly, this was just no good. It looked great - solid copper color, slightly opaque, with some floating yeast. A huge billowy head on top that hangs around forever. Strong spicy nose of wheat, and lots of citrus as well (mostly lemon). Light sourness, making this one unique compared with other saisons I've had. Taste is...Jesus Christ. Straight sour, kicks you square in the nuts. Nothing else whatsoever. I thought this one might have gone bad, but reading some of the other reviews, I'm not so sure. Awful, a pourer (one of the first I've ever poured, I think). Feel is okay, medium body. I'm hoping this one's gone bad, but I'm not sure if I'll have the gusto to throw more money at it. Too bad."
"D-This is a very easy drinking saison and one that I would think was European in a blind taste test. I could go for a little more of that funk but really that is getting nitpicky."
"Just fine by itself, but I think it needs the breakfast menu by its side to complete it. :)"
"Pours a golden color with a nice frothy head that the last remnants of the bottle are now sitting upon. Smell is really funky. There is some spice, some yeast and just a hint of ass. Taste is bubbly carbonated and a good amount of funk/sourness. This is a easy drinker. Its lacking some punch at the finish. Seems like its good upfront, then theres nothing there to round it out and finish off. Good beer none the less."
"Got this one and it was hissing when I pulled into the driveway...had to go ahead and drink it. Poured with a lively head and pretty good carbonation. It was a somewhat cloudy golden color. Smell was funky, of course. Very earthy and nice spicy scents come through. Not your typical Heineken funk, this is some good funk. Taste picked up more tart flavors that weren't so apparent in the smell. Zesty lemon and some orange were the most present. A little too sour for my liking which continued in the mouthfeel. It had a zing to it, for sure. Still, a very light and refreshing drink. Went a little downhill after having higher expecations from appearance. James Brown, step aside. This is one funky mother!"
"This brew pours a hazy pale orange color. The head is massive, billowly, and doens't recede. Instead, it just sits there, and eventually breaks apart into thick chunks which stick to the sies of the glass. The aroma is of citrus, pollen, flower shop, oak, and has a nice tart/sour edge. The taste is like the aroma, but a little less expresive, and with a nice refreshing bitterness in the arftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively, fine carbonation, and a smooth velvety texture. Overall, this is a wonderful beer, and at 4.5% ABV I could session this for quite a while without getting bored."
"Thanks, TheBungyo, for another great experience"
"Very nice beer."
"This is a very drinkable beer and at a lower ABV than many saisons I've encountered, it is very sessionable. Try it if you find it."
"Highly digestible due to its dry and light body. Pleasantly surprised with this beer- thought I was going to get a typically American interpretation of a Saison instead I got a uniquely wild concoction. Reminds me of Orval. Seek this out."
"Pours a pale cloudy tawny/golden color with a white, fluffy fine, tight bubbled head with good retention. Citrus rind is dominant with soft herbal hops and yeast notes with something like the scent of dill. Nice dusty lemon pith flavor with delicate waves of herbal, earthy, and floral tones. Perfume essence throughout with slightly increasing bitterness as it warms. Terrific sour yeast presence and slightly peppery. Carbonation surrounds the tongue with a very frothy mouthfeel. Yeasty residue and herbals make up the finish. Very nice complex Saison."
"Pours a cloudy pale golden color with an off white head. Aromas of a sour, fruity, belgian yeast. Basically like a sour saison. In the taste, a small fruitiness and a dry sourness. A dry yeasty aftertaste is left behind, leaving it not as refreshing, but very good. I don't care what anyone says, Jolly Pumpkin makes some great beers."
"Drinkability: Would have more of these, but I am cellaring the others. Quite enjoyable."
"Overall, a pretty mediocre Saison. I really like sour beers, but this just fell short in both the sourness and complexity factors."
"Drinkability  Not a bad effort from the Jolly Pump. The fizziness cut down on its drinkability but overall this is a nice one."
"D: One of the better domestic saisons I have consumed. I would highly reccomend this."
"Drinkability is good, the alcohol content is quite low, but I dont feel like my taste buds can handle more than one funky brew in a sitting."
"Pours a cloudy pale yellow color, nice carbonation, nice two-finger plus foamy white head, lots and lots of sticky lacing. The nose is malty, yeasty, soury, with some spices. The taste is malty/yeasty, with some sour notes, and spices. Medium body. Drinkable, really this is not my cup of tea, I've had better Saison's."
"Overall- A decent Saison. Couldn't drink too many due to its high carbonation!"
"D-Come on...beers don't get much easier to drink that this. The bundle of flavors is phenomenal for a beer of such low gravity. I can barely finish the review without opening another bottle. For an ""all day'r"" , this one should be worth seeking out. Why can't there be more session-style saisons out there (or any saison for that matter!)"
"This is my first saison and it seems to match the style. Another good offering from Jolly Pumpkin. Keep up the great work!!!"
"D - Decent beer all around. I did like the flavor, even with the odd bitterness. I'd drink this again, but it's not my favorite jolly pumpkin."
"As with all Jolly Pumpkin beers, make sure to pour slowly to avoid a frothy mess, and for this one, make sure your swirl the bottle to get all the sediment into the glass. Appearance (other than loads of sediment) was not memorable, neither was aroma ... but the taste -- the sour, fruity notes were excellent, but started to thin out toward the end. An average Jolly Pumpkin brew, but their average brew is still worth it."
"Wickedly drinkable, that acidity and thin body makes it a Beer I could drink by the gallon. Probably one of the best US-made Saisons I've ever had. My first samplings of JP didn't thrill me, but I'm a believer now with this Beer."
"Pours out a slightly hazed and brassed golden color with tons of carbonation reaching towards the 3/4"" bleached white head. Tart and funky brett notes are overwhelming in the nose with some toasty malt, as well as perfume-like floral notes and stone fruits. The funk seems a little more toned down in the flavor, which works more as an accent to the beer. I get some mild fruity esters mixed with crackery pale malts, a good overall tartness, and a bit of citrus pith. Finish is extremely dry and ends with some floral accents. Jasmine and ligustrum stay trapped on my palate long after each sip. Mouthfeel is really light (almost a little too light for me) and the carbonation is exceptionally lively. Amazing drinker. Completely refreshing and interesting, which is what I ultimately look for in a beer."
"D - This is a decently drinkable beer. JP makes good stuff. But, for the style I'd probably break for the Hennepin first."
"An interesting beer, the taste is opposite of many beers in that the bite comes first instead of the malt tastes. A pretty good summer beer."
"First, let me just say, Jolly Pumpkin makes some damn fine looking beers. This poured a hazy gold with effervescent bubbles rusing toward the top. I topped the frothy head with a last swirl of residue which left brown specs on top like cinnamon on a latte'. Nice. Funk and lemon hit the nose hard. A nice herbal mustiness later on. Taste is very much like a lemony Dupont. There is also a noticeable hop presence which plays off the tartness nicely. This is smooth, though somewhat thin, drinking. Delicious."
"D- This is definitely a new favorite of mine for the warmer summer months. It was very flavorful, yet clean and crisp."
"Good, though....not bad in the least..."
"A very nice, refreshing Saison. It has a nice bitterness & lite sour quality that was very nice and had an enjoyable mouthfeel. This would pair great with a variety of cheeses, some artisan bread, simple fare like non spiced cured meats, non-spicy food. Its easy to see why the Saison style is a ""farmhouse ale"" in that I can see just about any simple provincial fare going very well with this. A most enjoyable brew, and one I would definitely drink again and would love to try with a amuse tray of cheeses, meats, breads & fruits."
"Overall, this just does not do it for me. Definitely my least favorite from an interesting brewery."
"Single 12oz. brown bottle purchased at Oak Tree Buy Rite in NJ. Poured into my large wine glass. Appears a cloudy, golden yellow color with about two generous fingers of fluffy white head that settles down to about half an inch. Moderate amount of lacing is left on the glass. Smells of musty hay, fruit and spice. Taste is tart, sour, peppery, and spicy with a touch of malt at the end. Medium in body with a moderate amount of carbonation. Pretty tasty."
"Drinkability: A simple lil' saison!"
"Pours a very cloudy light golden. Huge fluffy head, with lots of retention,and lacing. Smell is of tart fruit. Body is light with some carbionation. Taste is for sour cherry,with a bit of spice. Nice little touch of hops in the finish. Try this one over the summer."
"750ml bottle from Florian's. Hazy light yellow body with a couple inches or so of rocky white head that dissipates slowly leaving a fair bit of lacing. Smells strongly fruity and spicy - very very good. Tastes sweet, fruity, pithy, and spicy, with strong citrus flavors. Lighter in body than many of the style, but it along with the fantastic flavor help make this among the most drinkable beers I've had. Very very good."
"Very drinkable, and is fairly refreshing. This is what i wish 7-Up or Sprite tasted like, and actually might be an approachable craft brew for those who enjoy lemon lime sodas, or dry sparkling white wines. Definitely sessionable, although im trying my best to go slow and savour it. My restraint is aided only by the fact that all I have is one. Recommended, definitely a good, sessionable and refreshing ale, perfect for a hot summers day or night."
" The 4.5% ABV would easily qualify this as a great session beer, but I can't imagine the novice craft brew drinker or someone looking for refreshment on a summer day grabbing this first. Sure, it is refreshing and a great introduction to this style, but there are other beers out there that would better fit those bills. Instead, this is great for the night at home of pure enjoyment and quite introspection. Being a big Frasier fan, I love the Jask Russell Terrier on the bottle, as it reminds me of Eddie. More importantly, this reminds me that American brewers can take on a foreign style of beer, and beautifully craft their own version of it. If only I grabbed more than one bottle of this!"
"The finish is very distinctive to Jolly Pumpkin. There is a good presence to the beer but needs to be drier. The tart leaves a decent feel but could be more distinct if the beer was drier. Overall I thought the beer was very nice to drink, especially on hot summer day."
"Pours a cloudy golden color with a bit of dullness to it. Big, incredibly chunky white head that leaves fuzzy lacing on the sides of the glass. Funky brett character on the nose, along with some oranges and a bit of wet-leaf must. On the palate, very complex with typical saison flavors, while the brett funk adds an extra dimension. First off, citric hops and juicy bitterness, with things skewed toward the hops at the expense of the malt. Light and bitter, but not too acidic. Mouthfeel is marked by huge carbonation (central to the style) and light consistency. Overall, this is very good. It strikes me as a true saison of the old times -- hoppy, a bit funky, relatively low in alcohol (at least compared to what saisons must have been way back when) -- and that's a good thing."
"Overall: This was a pleasant surprise as I am not a huge fan of wild beers (in general). Very drinkable and would be excellent on a nice warm summer day. Best saison that I have ever had (as it lacked a skunky aroma like most)"
"D - A refreshing version of style, and probably the best US attempt at it I've had to date. The smell can be a little off-putting, but were at available in my area I'd pick this up as a nice alternative to wheat beers on a sunny summer day."
"Pale beer with a decent head that stuck around, even in a small sample. Funky, almost fungal aromas. Flavour is very mild (especially compared to the Maracaibo Especiale right before), and not particularly aggressive. Floral notes as it warms, and a surprisingly cidery aftertaste."
"Big fluffy, cloud like head that sits atop a lovely tarnished golden coloured body. Thick lacing. An explosive aroma, soft fruity notes (the likes of peach, apricot) coated with light funky notes (as result of the wild yeast) that blends for an almost cider like complex. Steady streams of bubbles rise. I fell in love with the aroma. The taste isn't as effervescent (or impressive for that matter). The malts come more aggressive, not as tasty as their aroma counterpart. Fairly void of spice and not as ""fresh"" as the aroma would have you assume. A little flat and really quite dependent on a boring malt bill. I loved part of this beer and was neutral on the other half. I intend to revisit (because I enjoyed it) but I wasn't overly impressed with it as for the style goes."
"drinkability is good. this is probably the most ""straightforward"" beer i've had from jolly pumpkin, and i think it may have suffered from being sampled after maracaibo especial. still, a solid beer that i enjoyed."
"D: Complex yet quenching and thoroughly enjoyable to quaff."
"What tasty lighter ale. Blows all the other golden ales out of the water from the complex yet light flavor, really  wow. It has a funky bread aroma, but the flavor expands on the light barley with tartness that matches the hops flavors. A heck of a summer beer and a little spendy but worth trying. Great balance, appearance, and a juicy mouthfeel. MMmm."
"Shit is trill. What else can I say? This is one of the most underrated beers along with Helios. I'm ready."
"Drinkability - This would be a nice session ale. Nice and complex, easy drinking for a hot summers eve on the porch."
"The low alcohol allows for a lot of drinkability. Very similar to the other Jolly Pumpkin brews but less potent."
"I found this beer on a trip out of town in the Boston area, and brought it back to Jersey. I know that some Jolly Pumpkin beers are available widely but have not seen this one locally. If it is available in your neck of the woods, Yell, ""Bam"" like Emeril and pick some up."
"Not the best Saison Ive had, but not a bad beer either."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden with good sized white head that fades to a thin cap. Very nice aromas that are slightly funky and noticeably sour. there is a light citrus spritziness in the flavor , but also an orange rind bitterness and barnyard flavors that are delicious. Nice yeasty metallic undertones that are pleasant. Light and refreshing mouthfeel. A very nice beer and a great interpretation of saison."
"Transported back from Portland, OR. 12oz. Bottle. It pours a cloudy white peach color with a frothy white head and sticky lacing. The nose is filled with apricot, tangerine, and peach with a sour barnyard sourness. . Those flavors plus a woody sour taste that leaves a tannic mouth feel. I really like this beer and think it is well made but I can see how it might turn some people off."
"Overall impression: Wow - I had no idea this was coming to Colorado! Was very excited to see it in Liquor Max's newsletter. Definitely a great saison, and one of the best beers I've been able to get in 6 packs. Sessionable, but interesting enough to sip and savor."
"Drinkability: easy to quaff this one. Very enjoyable farmhouse brew that everyone should give a shot."
"12oz bottle poured into a Duvel tulip glass. Body is a cloudy golden color topped by a small flourish of a creamy white head that retreats rather quickly. Aroma is complex - largely sour and funky, with a decent amount of citrusy bitterness. Palate is nicely nuanced, a delicate balance between the flavorful yeast and light malt character. The sour quality is rather muted compared to the nose, with notes of lime and maybe a little green onion making an appearance. Finish is dry, yet refreshing. The light body is just about perfect for this absolute treat of a beer. A must for sitting on the porch on the first day of spring."
"A 750ml capped bottle. Poured into a tulip glass, this beer is a hazy yellow with probably the hugest head I've ever seen. Pure white, long-lasting, leaving some nice lacing. It has a citrusy aroma, mostly lemon. Some spice lurking in the background. A nice tart taste, again with a hint of spice. Good mouthfeel, oily (in a pleasant way). Wonderful beer."
" Mouthfeel is highly effervescent with small bubbles. With such a low ABV, this beer is eternally drinkable."
"Man do I like saison's! This is my first offering from Jolly Pumpkin, and I'm quite impressed. At first I was skeptical of the low ABV, but it suits the refreshing quality of this beer perfectly, and is a marquee example that you can get big taste without having to make a big beer. Dare I say this reminds me a lot of Orval? I do. Not sure how much this would cost by the the case, but surely cheaper then it's Belgian counterparts, which would further it's cause as a top choice for a long day in the sun."
"As with most of the other JP beers, plenty unique and ""wild", but lacking a cohesion of qualities that make a beer extremely drinkable at the same time."
"As I said, most of JP's beers are not on my ""buy again"" list, but this is a smooth, summer style beer that I could see having again."
"D - Overall, a very tasty brew with a nice sourness to it. First Jolly Pumpkin brew, and I will try some of their others."
"A very crisp beverage, very refreshing and a great beer for a warm day that is dry enough to want another but not enough to tire the palate. Very well done!"
"highly foggy glowing yellow beer with gobs of yeast dancing about. mammoth white head comprised of huge bubbles. smells of funky yeast, lemon, honey, mint, spices, sandalwood... this scent should be marketed for all kinds of incense and cleansing products: Bam soap; Bam shampoo; Bam scented oils. tastes fresh and spontaneous, lemon juice counteracts the belgian yeasts, spicy malts add all sorts of dimension; mild hints of pepper, clove, coriander, honey, mint leaves. heavily carbonated, very gaseous, crisp in the mouth. refreshing, and frighteningly easy to drink. it takes massive restraint for me to make a 12 oz. bottle last more than 15 minutes."
"Explodes out of bottle with a five+ finger white head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Cloudy pale amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Yeasty nose. Flavor is slightly sour and yeasty, citrusy, tart, dry finish $2.08 for a 12oz bottle from Hi-Time Cellars Costa Mesa, Ca."
"12 oz. bottle, 4.5% ABV. Pours a cloudy yellow/gold color, with a huge thick fluffy white head. A good deal of carbonation helped this head hold for what seemed like an eternity. Aroma is floral, grassy, spicy, and a bit funky. A few citrus notes in the background. Near the end, the aroma seemed to become perfumey. Soft carbonation gives this a great mouthfeel, almost creamy. A bit of tartness, followed by some earthy spices, and lingering lemon zest. Great patches of lace are left clinging to the glass as I drink this brew. Lingering earthy and grassy bitterness. There is a bit of funky flavor that hits as you raise the glass to your lips. Seemed just a bit harsh for me, which hurts the drinkability somewhat. Overall, pretty good."
"D- Not as drinkable as I thought it would be for a 4.5%. I am also glad this wasn't in the typical 750mL Jolly Pumpkin bottle. 12oz. was just right."
"This is the 3rd Jolly Pumpkin beer i've had and the first one that we can't actually get in South Bend. Pours orange and mostly clear with one of those great white creamy puffball heads that good saisons get. Sour tangy odor, some light spiciness. Fruity tangy taste. Some fresh grassy hop flavor that sets it apart from some other saisons. Quite flavorful and intresting. Also very easy to drink. a refreshing, yet different, example of the style."
"I like the bottle on this one. Pours a slightly hazy yellow with a small white head. Nose is fruity, perfumy hops. Almost like rose hips. Yeast aroma comes through. Taste is hops, bright fruits, with slight alcohol and grain in the finish. Mouthfeel is super foamy and sharp. Pretty interesting. Drinkability is good."
"Light and zesty and sessionable too no end."
"Recommended."
"Mouthfeel is light with lots of carbonation. Drinkability is high. A great summer refresher. I will enjoy this beer again soon."
"A light,crisp pleasing mouthfeel,very refreshing and very drinkable also. Recommended tasting here. Thanks to the WVbeergeek for bringing this beer down"
"Overall: I enjoy JPs experimentation and this does well for their portfolio of brews. Extremely high drinkability with a unique (did I stress that enough) take on a saison. Definately worth seeking out if you are a fan of the style; but beware of the tart, sour finish (in a good way)."
"Mouthfeel felt really light and airy, going down smooth, with just a hint of oil on the tongue. I could see myself really getting the hang of this in the warmer weather. The most drinkable funky brew I've ever had."
"Pours a cloudy golden orange with a fluffy white head with large champagne like bubbles. The smell is citrus with sour notes, with some spice and yeast characters as well. The taste is citrus up front with the yeast/doughy flavor followed but a not overwhelming but very noticable sour that lingers. The mouthfeel is interesting, light with carbonation that adds texture to the beer. This one is not the easiest drinking beer, especially for those not familiar with the style. This is different and worth checking out. Enjoy."
"Light orange pour with big Saison head but low residual carbonation. Less spicy flavors than the other commercial standards, but a nice low final gravity keeps the taste light and the taste buds awake and looking for more flavor. Tart and lemony with some nice yeasty/bready notes."
"Last swigs:"
"D- a fine brew, would go well in place of wine of campange, tasty and very enjoyable. would go easy with many different food combonations"
"Drinkability is good since I had 3 in a row..."
"Slainte!"
"D: A lot going on, but spiciness and dry finish dance well together. This beer is sold by the sixer. I couldn't have more than one or two a night, but could see having it on hand as an occasional reward."
"It's more tart then other saisons and lacks the body that others do but it's alright."
"Enjoyed multiple pints of this nice saison on tap at 3 different spots in the Ann Arbor, Mi. area last weekend. Pours dark apricot, cloudy. With an off white head and leaving loads of fine ringed lacing. Spicy/yeasty nose. Tasty, funked up/brett infused saison. Thoroughly enjoyable, complex, BA worthy saison from the folks of Dexters Jolly Pumpkin. Well worth seeking out and enjoying"
"Poured out a hazy straw color with a fluffy white head. The nose was strong with yeast notes, some delicate fruit and caramel. The taste was fairly simple, yeast mostly, tiny bit of malt, not much to say here. Mouthfeel was highly carbonated, too much. Goes down easy, but a poor finishing flavor."
"One of the beauties of this beer is that, to me, it could be nothing but beer. Some beers seem candyish, or chocolaty, or very fruity, or just hops. This has everything present, but in the end the flavor is not very much like anything that I have ever tasted besides, well, beer. A good one that has that special magic."
"Like Jolly Pumpkin's Calabaza Blanca, they've got the framework for a great beer here, but the recipe, particularly the balance of flavors, needs some fine tuning. I'd like to see this beer in a few years, as I'm hopeful that Captain Ron and company will be able to broaden the flavors in this brew. Until then, I'll keep drinking La Luciernaga, listed on this website as a Belgian Pale Ale; however, it is clearly a saison, and a better one than Bam Biere."
"Overall, OK, but too tart. Very drinkable, just not to my taste."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability; mouthfeel is medium bodied and very creamy, with a nice smooth natural carbonation, and the drinkability is very good."
"Cloudy golden orange with a cobwebby, thick, whipped, off-white head. Looks great! Modest bouquet of sour wheat malt, fruit, a hint of spice, and yeast. Tangy wheat and light fruit malt up front. Refreshingly acidic sour notes mesh well with wittish malt and spice. Medium-bodied, proteiny feel that ends up smooth and goes down very easily. What an interesting little session saison these Dexterians have whipped up. I'll be ordering another soon!"
"The drinkability is good. The lightness makes this beer an easy drink, and the flavours are mild enough to avoid becoming overbearing. This would be a nice beer to enjoy in the summer in true farmhouse ale tradition. I would say this is most likely a very proper rendition of the style. Another solid product from Jolly Pumpkin."
"Overall, a saison that looks and smells wonderful, but attacks the palate and tastebuds too aggressively to achieve a perfect balance."
"Bam Biere is an excellent JP offering and is second only to the outstanding Oro De Calabaza in my opinion. This bottle disappeared in the blink of an eye and I find myself wanting more. I love the idea of a sessionable saison that comes in 12 ounce bottles. I wish more American craft breweries would follow Jolly Pumpkin's example."
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer. Probably the best saison I've had. I've been a big kick of sour beers lately, so really no surprise I was pleased with this offering. Here's to trying many more beers from Jolly Pumpkin."
"($6.50 / 12 oz. bottle)"
"D- a good beer, a would definitely buy/drink again, goes down very easily. A semi-rare feat, a belgian style ale from a non-belgian brewery that not only tastes good, but actually tastes like the style it's supposed to be"
"My third saison, this blows away the one Saison Dupont I had, but doesn't hold a candle to the Biere de Miel (also from Dupont). I'm thinking straight saisons might just not be my style."
"Pours out to a brownish-gold in the glass with a huge head. The aroma is that of yeast and light plum. The taste is lighter than I expected, with a light fruity tartness to it. Not complex, but then it shouldn't be as the style is quite simple being as its a farmhouse ale. Refreshing."
"The beer exploded from the bottle into my glass with a head that could not be contained. Beautiful bountifel lacing.Smell is banana like, fruity, yeasty. Taste follows through with more fruit and banana, and a strong pepper taste at the finish. Nice full creamy mouthfeel. Nice and pleasant to drink. Extremely refreshing."
"Pours yielding a massive foam head which nearly escapes the glass rim. It settles very slowly leaving some nice lace. The color of the beer is a deep gold with nice clarity. A fairly potent aroma of lemon spice dominates the nose with a hint of floral hoppiness also. The taste carries more of the spiced lemon zest which is mildy tart. The flavor doesn't open up to much complexity, however, but does turn to a earthy, dirt-like finish. Very dry, low alcohol. The mouthfeel is rather light, yet fluffy with a good mouthful of carbonation. Very easy to drink. It is perhaps a good session beer considering its low ABV, but not overly unique for Sasion..."
"From the bottle. poured a cloudy golden with a huge fluffy white head. aroma a nice blend sweet spices with some lightly sour citrus fruit a small amount of hops pops out and a nice hit of yeast and pepper. flavor the sourness comes out first, followed by citrus and the pepper, lemon. after working around the house all day this was a nice refreshing beer to wind down with."
"M: mouthful is light and bubbly, leaves mouth with earthy spicy after taste, goes down smooth"
"This arrived with a thick, white head above a very cloudy, medium-amber colored beer. The nose was really funky, obviously yeast-driven, with a sour quality to it, like overripe fruit. The mouthfeel was somewhat thin and the taste had a vinous quality, like a dry white wine. The finish was likewise dry, with a lingering aftertaste of that yeasty funk. I have to admit, this was my first Jolly Pumpkin on draft (not cask) and I was disappointed. I got Johns Grocery in Iowa City to sell me a single bottle out of a six-pack just so that I could re-review it. That review has already been posted, so it might be interesting to compare my two reviews. One beer does not change my stance, though. Jolly Pumpkin IS da bomb, yo!"
"Overall, enjoyable and easy drinking."
"overall- I was hoping for a little more from this, but its not terrible. The carbonation is a little extreme, and the flavor is kinda dull. Im reviewing this directly from the fridge, so im hoping once it warms up a bit it will bring out some more flavor."
"Definitely will drink more of these."
"Very easy to drink and a nice change of pace and the ABV wont knock you out."
"Mouthfeel is md, but dextrinous. Carbonation is strong, despite my releasing a large amount during the pours. Minimal lacing on the inside of the glass and decent yeasting on the bottom of the glass. Nice summer quencher and, IMO, a relatively simple saison. One that was a great opportunity for me to explore into relatively unfamiliar territory."
"this is a dead on saison."
"Drinkability & Notes  Slightly tart and all this flavor, at under 5% abv? Now that is a hot summer day quencher with some character. Not sure if there is brett in this one, if there is I imagine that it is to blame for my overcarbonation, hopefully its finished eating..."
"Overall Impression: Being in Dexter, Michigan, I never thought I would try Jolly Pumpkins Artisan Ales. Well, thy bottle condition great beer. This beer is cleanly fermented and has such a wonderful farmhouse or barnyard flavors. If you can pick up a bottle of this do it. Great on a hot summer afternoon on the deck BBQing."
"Drinkability: very easy to drink, I could drink a few of these and not get sick of them."
"I would imagine this is how old school Saisons taste. Drinkable and enjoyable with an edge. Try it."
"Good example of the style, and a good answer to a July heatwave."
"Overall. a very interesting saison. Aroma is incredible, i think. the taste i do not think compares to the aroma. But i think this will be a great beer if it had just a little more alcohol to fill the mouthfeel up, however i cant knock that too much cuz i think that is a personel preference."
"Served up fresh on draft at Vintage Estate's in Boardman, OH...appears cloudy unfiltered honey amber sunburst golden tone with a large slightly off white mother of pearl head forms thick the way I like it as it dwindles slowly leaves fine lacing evenly great retention on this brew. Aromatics funky farmhouse spicy with citrus notes and hints of oak barrel aging to go around. Herbal hop aroma mixed with so much zestiness citrus peel, funky yeast mix definitely an acidic character but great smelling overall. Flavor is grassy and spicy upfront with funk ridden citrus combo going on as well, one of the better more creative American saisons I've come across what has gotten into this folks up in Dexter, MI wow this is the Bam. Mouthfeel is light in body by no means thin healthy carbonation carries the flavors very nicely almost spritzy in a sense spice mixture coats the palate and sticks around. Drinkability a very quaffable challenging version of this style great for the warmer months not to be turned down especially on draft good stuff."
"Sampled on the 4th of July with my cousin and brother. The beer poured a hazy golden yellow color with an thick active carbonated body and head that stuck around for awhile and left some good lacing. The nose of this beer was a pleasant mix of brett and earthy tones and some spice and malt that made my taste buds quickly jump in for their share of the beer. The taste was very strong as well with a nice hop bite on the tongue but balanced out well with the sweet maltiness and earthniess running around in there. The body is light but complex and makes for a very good summer brew."
"The beer empties from the 12-ounce brown bottle a slightly hazy gold with bits of suspended matter, the head modest in size, semi-creamy in texture, the color a splendiferous white, and the residual lace a velum like sheet to obfuscate the glass. Nose has a sprightly citrus like tone, hints of hops and a nice malt sweetness at the back, start is tartly sweet, grain presence delectable and the top moderate in feel. Finish is prickly in its acidity, the hops delightful; a nice semi-sweet dry aftertaste ends this most excellent beer."
"Bottle courtesy of Thebeercellar2: Poured a slightly hazy blonde color ale with a huge foamy white head with great retention. Very interesting aroma consisting of brett with some sweet malt, some funk and some wheat and spices. Taste as some sourness and funkyness which is well balance with some sweet malt, some light spices and some oak characteristic. Very well done and very interesting from this brewery, which just seem to continually amaze me."
"To be enjoyed without any sign of moderation."
"Touching story on the side of the bottle to boot. Can't recommend this beer enough."
"Listen, I don't believe in this mouthfeel mishmash. In fact my ""mouth feels"" a bit filthy saying it. But my ""tongue feels"" that this is a member of the fruit family. Namely the glockenspiel fruit playing Jesus music. It pings in there and bounces from tooth to tooth: boong baaang bong bong. And my belly says it is truly the spice lords stamping their gummy little feet into the loam and making footprints. And there's a tractor behind a barn carrying apples to a spice-barrel and dropping them in and all the monkeys are loose and throwing gobs of the pulp at the back of your throat and your uvula is saying ""aaahhh."""
"Carbonation is very high with a light body. A refreshing beer that is low in ABV and super easy to drink."
"Cheers!"
"This takes Belgian style carbonation to another plane of existence. Very carbonated, a bit too much, otherwise awesome. I'm very impressed with this beer, I believe it rivals many Belgian saison offerings."
"The beer pours a cloudy orange with a minimal head, lots of bubbles dancing around in the glass. It has an interesting aroma of apple, citrus and a good heaping of yeast. The taste was nice: lemon and apple, a nice floral touch with the open-fermentation tartness and overall very refreshing for a warm summer day."
"Overall it's quite impressive. The initial broadness of the yeast softens as it warms to reveal its full range, and the combination of muddy Brett and floral hops is engaging. This is not a beer for the mainstream or entry-level beer connoseur, but rather a teasing delicacy for those familiar with the complex beers of Belgium and southern France."
"Nope, didn't like this much at all, either for style, or overall. Seems like a lot of other people's comments mirror mine, yet they rate it higher. Guess it's just a matter of taste..."
"I like the Jolly Pumpkin beers, but they're always on the brink of over attenuation and this one kinda falls off in that regard. It's easy to drink, but overall it's kinda weak."
"Poured cloudy pale peach with mammoth soapy white head. The beer exploded on the initial pour, so I only got about 2/3 into the glass. The smell is full of appropriately sour fruitiness (lemons?) and spices (cloves, pepper). Dry and rather hopped and yeasty flavors up front. Middle is full of earthy yeast, lemons, tangerines, and pepper. Tastes s bit restrained compared to the aroma. Light and strongly carbonated in the mouth."
"6 pack purchased at La Bodega, Riverisde, CA for $10.99 in late May 2006. Pours a slightly cloudy yellow with lots of head and lots of carbonation feeding it. The aroma/flavor- 2 words: funky delight. Seems a little more unrestrained in its funkiness than the others I really like (Hennepin and DuPont). There are mild sour citrus notes among the funk, and it has a sharp cheese-like ending. Overall, pretty enjoyable beer."
"Notes: Highly reccomended. You pay for what you get and in this case its well worth it. This is one of those beers that is a ""MUST HAVE", seek it out, trade, drive, fly, You Must Try This Beer. The best part is its great in the heat, complex, ans SESSIONABLE!"
"This beer is ok, but 25% more malt would really make this top-notch. It has alot of things going for it, but the bitterness is too much for it's own good and some sugars would really bring out a tremendous amount of character."
"The taste and mouthfeel were almost flawless. A little sour and malty with a hoppy after-taste. Everything worked together perfectly. Easily my favorite Jolly Pumpkin."
"Drinks okay on hot day like today (just got finished playing catch with my boy & raking a lot of dead grass). But tartness would prevent this from being more than a one or 2 beer selection. But having said that I didn't like about 1/2 the saisons I had in Belgiue either. First I've had from jolly pumpkin, makes me want to try some more"
"Drinkability: Low. Flavors are unbalanced but not bold enough to be interesting. Not my cup of Saison."
"I picked up this beer recently as it has just become available in the SouthEast. It poured a cloudy pale yellow with a frothy white head that dropped pretty quickly. It appears to have a lot of carbonation with tight bubbles. The smell of the beer is in character for a Saison, lemon and a slight must. The taste is sharp due to the high carbonation with a lemon and white pepper character. It finishes very dry. To me, this beer could have a little more body and it seems quite thin. I did not notice the low abv until I got home. Most saisons I have had are in the 7-8% range and have more of a medium mouthfeel. Bam is very light tasting, but it is refreshing. It reminded me more of a wit than a saison. The overall drinkability is good because of its clean crisp taste, but it is a little on the thin side for me. Decent beer, but I would not go out of my way to drink it."
"Drinkability- I guess this would be qualified as a nice session saison if there is such a thing. Very easy drinking...just not the big flavor punch as many other of this style."
"This beer had a hazy deep straw color to it, with a foamy, almost sponge like head that never seems to cease. The smell is dominated by rich fruity esters, some sour apple with light spice notes from the hops, a bit of vinegar and funk toped off by a splash of olive. The taste is complex, on par with the style. There are light pepper and citrus notes, with a refreshing bit of sourness and vinegar like acidity. The sour and the spice combined make for a very interesting combination. Slight farmhouse notes, a bit of must and hay. The moutfeel is smooth, and has a lingering power that is not unpleasant coupled with solid carbonation. Bam Biere is a very drinkable beer."
"Overall: Not your usual Saison, but I love the upped ante on this one. Brash at times with a bold Who Dares Wins feel throughout. Very enjoyable indeed. Cheers Joe!!"
"I've given it a 3.5 across the board because it isn't bad and is much better than merely 'average'...if and when I try it again, I may adjust my scores."
"I just don't find this enjoyable."
"Drinkability: Overall this beer would made for a nice refreshing summer beer. I could see myself drinking this if the weather outside was really hot. If the Jack Russell Terrier knew if he was on the label, I would think he would be happy about the beer inside."
"Mouthfeel is a bit thin and over carbonated. Drinkability is still good regardless. A bit ofr funkiness which isn't overwhelming and the lightness form the carbonation make this go down easily."
"D: Nice beer. Original. Different. Saison fans should take it for a run."
"A run of the mill Saison in taste and feel, but the appearance and aroma had me excited...until I started drinking it of course."
"For the first time ever, Jolly Pumpkin beers have become available locally. The Bam Bière is the first of the new arrivals to grace my home. As I popped the cap, the beer almost gushed out. A quick and careful pour saved every single drop. In the oversized wine glass, this looked like the prototypical Saison, with a hazy pale body, and a very large foamy head. The smell was typical as well, with a yeasty and doughy rustic smell mixed with a smattering of grassy and floral hops. The taste was light and refreshing with a good balance between sweet, sour, and spicy flavors. Not as funky as authentic Belgian examples, but still a very good interpretation. Mouthfeel was a bit too thin and watery for the style, considering the better examples of the style are above 6% ABV and cellarable. I would have no problems visiting this again in the middle of the summer for a change of pace from the Witbier and Pilsner rut."
"Hazy tarnished gold appearance, lots of bubbles and an attractive huge mousse-like head that holds a nice shape. Lots of sticky sparkling lace. Aroma is yeasty but has more complexity in that it shows elements of sweet grass and shortbread. Light mouthfeel and active carbonation. Early bitterness and light astringency, the bready aspects from the aroma seem to take a lesser role. Takes on a medicinal quinine flavor in the second part of the profile, at the same time that it becomes more unidimensional and less interesting. Dry and fairly refreshing, not as vacant at the close as some others Jolly Pumpkin brews, still these beers overall look good, have the chops in the aroma department but all seem less complex than their set-up implies."
"spritzy mouthfeel, strangely refreshing and refreshingly sour. drinks easy with a raw pale ale flavor compounded over slight bacterial funk which adds green strawberry seed madness to the party. remiss to not mention orval, which tames the wild farmhouse spirit in a similar fashion, although this one finishes a bit creamier with a hint of sour milk and bread in the end. a queer bird for sure, but solid, and clean. not my cup of tea per se but admirable for what it is. in a blind tasting, i'd swear this was belgian."
"D- This is a very unique beer even for the saison style. It is smooth and drinkable but the flavor over tart fruit with a faint nose of funk. I will have to drink a few more to wrap my brain around this beer."
"Drinkability: Middle of the road drinkability compared to other saisions I've had. This is good, but not one I'd need to return to over and over."
"On tap at Ashley's in Ann Arbor,poured a light golden with a fizzy white head that was gone pretty fast.Aromas were nice quite phenolic and lemon zest with hints of black pepper and coriander.In my opinion this beer is a little to phenolic and yeasty there with notes of green apple and peppery spice in the finish.Its a decent brew but I was somewhat lrt down by it,its ok but I wouldnt seek it out again."
"I poured this beer from the bottle into a wide mouth wine goblet. It has a pale straw color with a small head, but it laces nicely. It smells musky with citrus overtones. It has a refreshing tart citrus taste with a clove and peppery backtaste. It is much drier than most saisons I have had. Very drinkable, goes down quite easily. Tastes much better than it looks!"
"Very drinkable at only 4.5% alcohol. I could have a few of these and not get tired of the flavors. However, I think the taste would be a bit fuller if this were around 6% alcohol. But still very good and worth a try, especially for the summer months."
"I think this is a very drinkable beer. Great for the summer. I'd pick up a bunch of this if I could get it in my area. Thanks again Trbeer."
"Is this a pumpkinized english bitter? It didn't blow me away, but piqued my curiosity enough to want to try it again."
"The palate is also bracing and tart - dry and citrusy with yeasty notes. It's very, very quaffable and food friendly. One of the cleanest beers I've had lately (it actually makes you thirsty for more)."
"Having tried this once before I was anxious to try it again. Wonderful pour big noisy lasting and bright white. It also smelled great with wild funkiness and sublte lime scents. The taste is very nice and approachable despite the funk. The only ding I would give this is it is a bit thin but that makes it all the more drinkable. Another excellent product by JP."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a big ol' 4"" off-white head over the cloudy dark golden brew. Meringey head fades VERY slowly, with intricate lace tatting along the entire glass sides. Aroma is a fervent mixture of spices, sweetness, funk, and what have you. Taste is a bit more controlled, with a somewhat tart and spicy overall picture. Also a slightly chalky close that lingers. Mouthfeel is a bit prickly, what with spiciness and carbonation, but probably more or less to style, and drinkability is not so bad either. Overall, my anticipation from the look and aroma overwhelmed what I got out of this flavor-wise. Still a pretty nice beer though."
"Straw colored and hazy with a tight white head. First smells are perfumy, tart green apples, and then a light honey with a little spice. A lot going on in the aroma of this one. There is a slight sweetness first on the tongue which is followed by a lemony, grassy tartness with a bitter finish. The beer is crisp and refreshing and although this might not be something I choose for everyday drinking, Jolly Pumpkin has a very wide array of aromas and flavors built into this beer."
"Once again, the Captain at Jolly Pumpkin proves his little brewery to possibly be the best in the state of Michigan, and certainly one of the best in the Midwest."
"Pours a cloudy amber/gold, huge rocky white head, lots of lace and great retention. Smell is sweet, wheat, orange peel, some barnyard funk, citrus, yeast and lots of spice. Taste is sweet, with citrus/orange peel, some sugary sweetness, barnyard funk again, wheat, yeast, some floral and spice. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation, very smooth, very refreshing. Thanks DrJay!"
"Slightly hazed gold colour with a big, fluffy white head. Decent retention and chunky lace remained on the glass. Complex aroma with plenty of barnyard and leather, plenty of lemony citrus, a light breadiness, and a spice character somewhere between ginger and clove (maybe I'm just getting a bit of each). There's a light, lemon bitterness that lingers through the finish. Earthy, musty quality with a bit of leather and a balanced tartness. Mild sweetness ties all the flavours together. Light bodied, moderate carbonation after the pour, some dryness. A very drinkable beer with a lot of character. Quite enjoyable!"
"Mouthfeel is on the lighter side with a blast of fast moving carbonation. Goes down easy and is a really refreshing beer. I'd have to say drinkability is exceptional here...I just wish the availability was better. I grabbed a six pack for $9.99 and after drinking this one I would buy a case at the drop of a hat to drink through the summer months. Another wonderful brew by JP. Keep 'em coming!"
"Farmhouse aroma with attractive spices. Lace, cloudy yellow, thin head. Aggressive carbonation, tasty and very drinkable. Medium mouthfeel. Crisp, funky, citrus, ginger heat, corriander, pepper,sour aftertaste and spice burn like a hot chile pepper. Recommend with dinner."
"Pours a cloudy orange color with a medium head and decent retention and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma is weird, imagine that. Lots of citrus (mostly lemon) along with a barnyard-like funkiness. The flavor has a lot of the lemony bite with some funkiness. Not too sour, but has some hints. The finish leaves a little of the funky on the tongue along with some dryness. The body is fairly light and the drinkability is good. Tasty brew."
"I'm having a second bottle, and the funk is definately more pronounced in the flavor. This one is a winner."
"From the new 12 oz bottles. Pours out to a light and hazy yellow color with a nice 1/2 inch head of foam that remains consistant. Higher level of carbonation. Aromas are initially confused with that of a rotten granny smith apple and kitchen cleaner. Yet, when the senses are opened and the mind becomes more aware, the smell of sour fruits, citrus, mild sugars, and, oddly enough, the essence of freshly frozen ice, like on a hockey rink, fill the nose. I can now appreciate the aroma. Taste is very saison like; flavors of lactic sourness, lemons and oranges, coriander, fresh flowery mildness and mild raw veggies. Mouthfeel is good; very bubbly and zesty. Feels like my mouth is being wrapped around a beer blanket. Overall, I don't think this is a brew I'd look to very often, but it's probably the best Saison I've had. Recommended"
"Great for the upcomming warm season. Very citrusy and musky. Looks a hazy yellow with fleeting head retention. Promises to be thin and tart. The nose offers a tart / sour taste and feel. Lemony and orange-ey with a bold spice undertone. It turns from an upfront creamy and smooth to a finishing thin and tart. Lightly barnyardy and musky. Lightly acidic, alcoholic and astringent. Very clean and crisp. A true refresher for the warm summer evenings."
"***sidenote*** Had this side by side with a bottle also provided by hopdog. My bottle seemed to have a huge amount of floaters compared to his bottle, which had barely any floaters. Also, my bottle seemed to give off more of a sulfuric smell when poured; whereas his bottle didn't seem to have much of that at all. Interesting. Could it be the batch, brett, or bottles? He got his yesterday, and I got mine today."
"D: More approachable than some of their brews & quite refreshing. Personally, I wouldn't be able to drink too much though..."
"Eathy, rustic, a touch of spice, and subtle fruit all interplay nicely. Dry finish. Light bodied, airy. A showstopper."
"Aroma is an overripe citrus fruit mash and fairly musty. The cloudy golden color of the body holds a creamy, two finger thick, white head. Tart and mildly critic fore...great mouthfeel-creamy yet still wet and quenching..musty overripe oranges, mild spice...finish is throat tickling crisp with more musty notes and a twinge of sourness. This would pair well with spicy foods I think."
"This is a very complex beer with a noticeably low alcohol content, proving that a lower alcohol beer doesn't have to a be plain or boring. This is really exciting to me, as all last summer I experimented with creating lower strength (around 4-5 percent alc. by vol.) Belgian-inspired ales in my homebrewery. However, that said, I think this brew is over-priced at $11 a six-pack and I worry that will scare many people away from an otherwise delicious and highly sessionable ale."
"D - It's light. I couldnt drink this all night. The flavors kind of throw me off."
"Luckily for me, I am refilling my glass as I write."
"This gets much smoother and more well-balanced as it warms."
"Pours a very hazy, golden, copper color. Huge white, fluffy head that fades quickly, leaving lots of sticky, clingy, delicate lacing. Incredible smell, a combination of sour apples, cinnamon, and a hint of lemon. Other aromas include, flowers, yeast, and spices. One of the most aromatic brews I've sampled. Beautiful! Well balanced, fruity, sour, and tart all descibe the taste. Reminds me of a light tasting cider, not overwhelming. Lots of carbonation, light bodied brew, and is very dry. Easy drinkability and with an abv of 4.5% a definite session brew. Highly recommended!!! Another fine example from Jolly Pumpkin!"
"Medium to full mouth that is a little puckerya and enjoys a good dose of the carbonation tingles. This is the most complex and flavorfull session beer to ever pass my lips. I strongly recommend this incredible beer."
"A clay colored blur tempers the amber from within. A surface of pale on top barely obscures the liquid. Exotic winey aromas contain sweet sappy resins. Wild whole cinnamon, nectarines, pears and yuzu come to mind. Fluffy, chalky dry texture. Tangy. Mashed pears and apples. A vigorous charge of gas expands the wheaty, mineral flavored dryness. I attribute the seizure of wiry, earthy bitterness on the finish to wood extract. Identifiably Jolly Pumpkinish."
"The aroma is definitely the best aspect of this beer, everything else is world class as well though. I have really become a sucker for these low alcohol, yeast & wee-beastie flavor driven profiles. They are so refreshing, yet fully complex and interesting."
"The drinkability of this beer is ridiculous and I look straight at the abv and balance of flavors as the top reasons. It is no surprise that it is dedicated to the Jeffries' Jack Russell terrier, Bam, because it (and he, I'm sure) is in your face with tenacious but lovable personality."
