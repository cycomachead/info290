I like the flavors of toasted malt, orange-like citrus and the spices, but for my taste, there is way too much hops and bitterness.  It really doesn’t even come off as a saison, in my mind, just a very spicy American pale ale or IPA.  I shouldn’t have been surprised, this is a beer brewed by Stone Brewery, however, I am disappointed.","Jeffreysan","Jan 20, 2015"

4.05,14.4,3.75,3.75,4.25,4.25,4,"I find it interesting in that the dryness at the end prompts you to go back to the beginning where you found that juicy fruitiness, making it almost compellingly drinkable. What it lacks is something that I find kind of intangible, or at least hard to explain in many cases, and that has to do with the complexity of the yeast. This is fairly straightforward, and essentially "clean", which is usually a great thing but this time around I'm missing a little bit more of the funkiness or unusual yeasty character that you sometimes find in a saison. On the other hand, they do state that it's "A MODERN TAKE ON A BELGIAN CLASSIC", so I can hardly complain - and as I look at an empty glass I really can't complain! If you can handle the spicy pepperiness that'll build on your palate I'd recommend you give it a shot.","NeroFiddled","Dec 09, 2014"

The aroma is great, with big fruity esters and spices. The taste, though, is kind of off. And hard to describe. It's not bad, but it doesn't match the aroma or the style completely. I'm guessing it's the different herbs used in the brewing process. It's light-bodied and pretty effervescent. The flavors may work for you. They don't do it for me.","delta490","Nov 16, 2014"

After a bit I got used to the thyme flavor but it still overwhelms and detracts from what you usually look for in the style.

The nose comprises clove, light black pepper, sweet flowers, light grass, light wheat, a hint of lemon zest, and a touch of Belgian candi sugar.  The taste continues to bring the spice pain, the lemon, wheat, and yeast tossed on the back burner to languish.  Some leafy greens try to peak in from the distant background, but to very little avail.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel.  Overall, though not necessarily a bad beer, per se, it's a pretty weak excuse for a saison.  Yeah, I'm probably not gonna grab another bottle of this any time soon.","TMoney2591","Sep 07, 2014"

Taste is much more herbal than suggested by the nose, with the addition of lavender and thyme, and finishes with a slight peppery kick and a lingering medicinal bitterness which I can't say that I'm overly fond of.  The mouthfeel is the best aspect of this beer.  Light in body with a bright carbonation and a mild, citric acidity.

Pervasive and pleasant aroma of lemon verbena and lavender. Flavor brings some immediate acidity. Sourness is accentuated by a heftly load of carbon dioxide. Past that, there's a little bit of fruit on the tongue, and a pleasant almost-dry finish. But really the sourness just isn't my thing.

The aroma is spicy, with notable hop, spice, and a little soft malt smells. The taste is peppery, dry, and more bitter than expected.

Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my tulip glass. 1/4 finger of white head left quickly, though slight lacing was present throughout. Beautiful copper hue. Interesting aromas of anise, pepper, lavender (as things warmed up), and Belgian funk (in a good way; again, new to saisons). Tasted a hint of lemon, and a nice peppery finish. Smooth mouthfeel. I enjoyed this beer. Nice stepping stones like this could get me more interested in the Belgian styles as a whole. Well worth a try.","Mikus","Jul 19, 2014"

Has a good bit of funk on the nose and some honey malt sweetness. A nice tart lemon with some bright lemon peel. A bit of floral musk and a maybe a hint of orange. Mouthfeel is a bit thin and could use just a few more bubbles. Drinks well though with a soft malt, cracker sweetened with honey. A bit of that funk gets to the palate and is a touch sour. The fruits combine in this for an overall fruity middle but nothing you could name. Finishes dry and a touch tart with some aftertaste to leave you thinking that maybe it is a bit too sweet. It has a musky floral that develops in the nose as it warms and that is light and powdery dry in the drink. Also shows some pepprcorns as I am finishing the glass.","utopiajane","Jul 17, 2014"

The aroma is such that there is no mistaking it as anything other than a saison. There is a hint of orange beyond the belgian yeast. Taste follows the nose with a citrusy yeast flavor, followed by a peppery characteristic. It's a bit more peppery than the "run-of-the-mill" saison, which I enjoy. A faint piney hop bitterness lingers on the tongue. Overall, a solid brew.","thomda11","Jun 28, 2014"

The aroma was very floral and herbal, with a smell of lavender, dried coriander seeds, and thyme. The taste was a little unusual for the style, as the notes of spice and flowers, that were first evident in the nose, were followed shortly by an unexpected hop bitterness, and then finished with a dash of pepper. The feel was little on the lighter side for the style, making this more of a summertime Saison. A bit of a departure from the usual Stone offerings.","rajendra82","Jun 11, 2014"

Lavender, cardamom, coriander, honey, flower petals, licorice, and sugary citrus...spiced up and adorned like many American Saisons tend to be, but Stone pulls of the blend very well. Flavor opens up with a blast of spicy yeast, leading to a more subtle lavender and herb presence, and finishing quite crisp and dry. Zesty citrus, perfumey floral notes, peppercorns, grass. and mint. Definitely not a Saison where the yeast and funk do all the talking - again, more of a jazzed-up American style, which I'm generally not a huge fan of, but I like the end result here.

So an overall interesting beer, but I would not have recognized it for a Saison if it hadn't said so on the glass - too strong herbal flavors and not enough malt and other flavors to compliment. But maybe that's the point Stone wanted to make in complimenting the herbs from their garden. As for drinkability - one is enough. I could not have a second one as it awfully powerful on the palate and wears it out. It's the lavender I think. I've had it once or twice in beers and it always wrecks my taste buds. So great looking beer and it smells really nice, but then it drops off.","damndirtyape","Jun 01, 2014"

AROMA: immediate Cali citrus with a yeasty funk that melds well with the airy floral scents that evoke lavender or lilac--definitely a farmhouse concoction... PALATE: soft, active body--palate cleansing and refreshing; pleasant,, lengthy aftertaste...TASTE: funky, almost spicy yeast that finds the teeth as hops might; a complete profile, far beyond the hay and decay one usually encounters in this genre, with pepper sprucing up the yeast...OVERALLL: first off, I love saisons --not much needed to give this a thumbs up, but add Stone to the mix, and we have a new possibility: a refreshing yet boldly spicy, floral take....","dacrza1","May 29, 2014"

Aromas of lemon zest, orange peel, pear, apple, clove, black pepper, herbal, floral, grass, wheat, bread, lavender, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, spices, and pale malt notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon zest, orange peel, pear, apple, clove, black pepper, lavender, wheat, bread, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Moderate earthy bitterness/spiciness and light tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, orange peel, pear, apple, clove, pepper, lavender, wheat, bread, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good robustness and complexity of pale malt, fruity/spicy yeast, and spice flavors; with a decent spice/yeast/malt flavor balance and minimal cloying flavors after the finish. Fairly intense on the spices in the taste, but not horrible. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately crisp, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice spiced saison style. Good complexity and robustness of pale malt, fruity/spicy yeast, and spice flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 27, 2014"

This one pours a hazy straw color with a small and short lasting white head that leaves little lacing. The nose is a refreshing blend of citrus (lemon peel and oranges), spices (coriander, pepper, and juniper, and bready malt and funky yeast. Its quite a nice bouquet. The mouthfeel is light, effervescent, and quenching. The taste is not quite as refreshing as the nose with more west coast hops dominating and not as much of the belgian and farmhouse characteristics coming through. It is still a nice blend of citrus, spice, and funkiness though. This was good but I was hoping for more from such a great brewer. Uts definitely a Stone style saison though.","lochef81","May 27, 2014"

This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it was fairly smooth, not the cleanest, slightly crisp, not too filling and the taste didn't do the best job at holding my attention so one would be enough for me, I don't have any urge to drink another one in a row. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance, I thought it was pretty good and it seemed to be the aspect that was truest to style. What I liked the least about this beer was the balance and the lower amount of carbonation, to me those were things that needed the most work. I wouldn't get this beer again, it's pretty easy to find a Saison that better suites my taste and I don't think I would recommend this as a good Saison. All in all I wasn't too impressed with this beer, lately I've found myself being a little let down with these new beers from Stone and this one is no different. It's for sure not my favorite Saison and it's not even close to being one of the better beers from Stone. I appreciate the effort, but this one could use some work, better luck next time guys.","StoutHunter","May 21, 2014"

Fail, fail, fail. This actually makes a really good comparison to Allagash's saison I just had a few minutes ago: Allagash Saison is subtle and balanced, this isn't. Allagash Saison is easy to drink and refreshing, this isn't. But hey, this does do one thing better than Allagash Saison: it's far more overspiced.

It really is a pretty interesting beer, and I'm not finding it NEARLY as harsh as some other reviewers do with the carbonation. The lavender is definitely there but not in an overly-done way, and the lemon zest and thyme make an otherwise-can-sometimes-be boring style more interesting. It's not blowing me away, but I like that little bit of Saison funk with the added flavors, as it makes for a light and refreshing beer. Nice job again, Stone.","Alextricity","May 19, 2014"

Stone are good craftsmen—they have the skill to get the fundamentals right—but there's absolutely no art to the beer, and this is a style that demands it. It's a weak, disappointing echo of a great style, and there are far better examples out there for you to find.","lacqueredmouse","May 03, 2014"

3.83,8.2,3.75,3.75,4,3.5,3.75,"Cracked open a fresh bottle. It poured a clear gold with a white head. Overall it's a dry and spicy saison, but with hits of citrus you won't find in traditional Belgians. The aroma is more grassy lemon, while the flavor matches juicy hops with coriander and peppercorns. There is an astringent touch in the mouthfeel that knocks the beer, but otherwise this is a very solid American take on the style. Definitely give it a shot.","tempest","Apr 23, 2014"
3.59,1.4,3.25,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.5,"Light body with a crisp peppery spice presence that's countered by bready yeast, farmhouse funk, light fruit notes and tart citrus sweetness. The zesty spice is prominent with hints of white pepper, ginger, grains of paradise and coriander. This is complimented by a subtle earthy/grassy hop presence and a decent amount of musty saison yeast. Decent amount of funk without overpowering the other notes giving off hints of wet hay, straw and grass. Some bread and biscuit flavor present mid-palate followed by apple, pear and citrus sweetness. Again, the citrus flavor becomes more prominent as it warms with slightly tart lemon juice and zesty lemon rind. Overall, the flavor profile is very similar to the aroma in that nothing really stands out but there is an excellent balance of interesting flavor. Not in the top tier of saisons I've tried but it's light, flavorful and dangerously sessionable. A decent go to beer for warmer weather months.","corby112","Apr 23, 2014"

4.18,18.1,3.5,4.25,4.25,4.5,4,"Overall (4.0): What the eff, Stone. Sometimes all people talk about is “do something other than hops for once, Stone, make a non-IPA for once, Stone.” Well, you did with this beer, and guess what? It doesn’t suck. In fact, it’s pretty damn good. This beer has a nice level of complexity: multiple distinct components, nothing clashing, nothing overwhelming, nothing muted. Personally I found the appearance somewhat lacking after the head died down, but the aroma, taste, and feel were all really, really good. Some self-professed purists will claim that this beer is too sweet (it really isn’t—the sweetness is moderate at best, but that’s just my opinion), some non-purists will be disappointed that it’s not funky, tart, or musty, and some newbies will drink it too damn cold, but in my opinion this is an excellent beer. It’s more or less a classically Belgian-leaning, non-funky saison that manages to TASTEFULLY incorporate some interesting ingredients that never clash. I’m very pleasantly surprised by this beer, and very pleased that Stone’s put a slightly-more-affordable saison in sixers. Very happy with this!","fmccormi","0"
