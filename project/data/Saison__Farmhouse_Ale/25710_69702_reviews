"Very good Brett Saison. Appearance is a mammoth off-white, extremely frothy head that settles slowly, loads of lace, and a hazy orange amber color. Aroma is yeast, malt, pears, plums, spice. Flavor's similar to nose, slightly sweet at first, then a bit of carbonic tang, followed by rest of characteristics and finishing again with a bit of bittersweet. Body is very good for this style and is the soft side. Overall, quite a drinkable beer."

"The taste begins with a general fruity complexity that leans towards pears. Midway the yeasty phenolics and black pepper round out the flavor.  Nice crisp and dry finish with a moderate level of carbonation. I'd like to age a few bottles to see how the brettanomyces continues to develop. I feel the additional aging would help create more depth and complexity. Nonetheless, very enjoyable."

"An interesting and tasty beer, in that order. I would drink this again, but not more than a single bottle on any occaision. It’s just not the kind of beer I would like to session. Damn glad it finally showed up around here, though!"
""
""
""
"Not much brett, but a dry crisp finish with some wheat and spice flavors.  Lemon as well."

"This was a fantastic brew to enjoy after a 62 mile bicycle ride on my birthday in 2014.  Hats off to my buddy, Jeff, for sharing with me!  Great friends, great times, great beer!"

"I really enjoyed this beer, and I did not expect to. The initial aroma was that of a sour, but the taste was anything but!  The flavors were of sweet malt and some hops; no unpleasant sourness to be discerned, which was in direct contrast with the nose. Wonderful mouthfeel and medium body with no indication of its 8% ABV made this go down quick and easy. It's a delicious and very interesting and complex brew, but such an easy and pleasant drink that I was extremely pleased with giving the style a shot. Will have again."

"On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Not my usual cup-o-tea but worth a try. Super organic lloking head & mild but resounding funk on the nose. Tart is the first impression on the taste buds. Lacing is impressive. A bit of lemon/citrus starts to peek through & a lingering in the palate is both unctous & dry. Not at all unpleasant. Not a very resounding compliment but I can recommend this as change of pace."

"A great use of Brett in this beer. Somewhere between a fruit and funk bomb from the wild yeast but the flavor and body are spot on."

"The dryness is incredible and the brett leaves a chalky feeling that's almost tart yet has champagne similarities that keeps it light, flavorful and going down way too easy for this ABV. The aftertaste is grainy, sweet and gives tart white grape flavors that resemble the bitter white wine grape right before fermentation. Very tasty beer, really enjoyable but a little less flavorful than I expected."

"O- This is just about everything I look for in a Brett saison.  You'd be hard pressed to find a better example."

"Big brett aroma like I've popped open a not-so-fresh (in the best way) Orval, but the body is lighter and drier as a saison should be. In fact among dry Belgians, this feels especially light for an 8% beer. The big barnyard funk aroma dominates and rolls through the flavor with a mix of citrus rind and spicy floral notes. There's a mild bitterness on par with Saison Dupont and the hops blend nicely in the bret. Hell of a beer, but I would like a touch more body to carry the flavor. Just a little more malt maybe, but it's still an excellent saison."
""
""
""
"Hazy golden body with a creamy white head and great lacing. Herbal, fruit, banana and yeast aromas and flavors. Sour Brettanomyces finish."
""
""
""
""
"This was most excellent. If it was slightly less carbonated, it would be better."

"Tasty, refreshing, good. Plenty of flavor to boot. Excellent."

"Overall: A nice and complex farmhouse ale. The flavor are huge and bold and dominates the palate. A definite Brett bomb for when you are craving it. Usually I like my saisons lighter and more quenching but I won't knock this ale for bringing the flavor"

"The Brett developed beautifully. Big orange rind, some tartness, and that big dry Brett character. Almost picked up some sweetness. Enjoyed this a lot more then having it fresh."
""

""
""
""
"Overall:  My scores reflect my disappointment with losing half the beer and if it didn't gush I would likely have rated it .5 higher; my expectations were very high, having just enjoyed the Seizoen the previous night - even so, I would still have likely rated the Seizoen higher"

"Pours with a good thick head that dissipated nearly as fast as it came. Glad the bottle recommended leaving the yeast in the bottle cause there was a crapload.  Smells of sweet strawberries and tart raspberries. Starts off sweet and malty and slightly malty. Taste then drifts fruity with strawberry, blueberry and blackberry--both sweet and tart. Mild yeastiness finishes in with the tart fruit and also some lemon along with a mouthwatering saltiness. Almost gose like flavors here. As it warmed up a little, I even tasted a bit of pinot noir at the end. Definitely a tiny bit of oaky fruity wine. Mouthfeel is surprisingly light for the 8.0%. I really like the fruitiness at the end. Very nice!"

"Well crafted saison that has a bright fruit character and mild acidity. The Brett is really a non player in the scheme of things and a let down in that manner. Quite drinkable and well crafted but unremarkable without some age on it."
"This is one of my favorite beers. It has just a bit of sweetness but not much, and wonderful complexity. There is a cloudiness to it that adds to its mystique. Also the fact that it is still reasonably hard to get and unavailable on the East Coast. The bottle itself conveys a certain sort of old-world mustiness."

"Bottle: Poured a dirty cloudy dark beige color ale with a huge dirty head with good retention and some excellent lacing. Aroma of rustic malt with light funky yeasty notes is quite sublime. Taste is dominated by dry rustic notes with some funky yeast notes and a dry floral finish. Dry Brett notes are clearly identifiable but are not overwhelming and keep the malt base flavours intact. Body is full with super great carbonation (a bit of a gusher as well BTW) and no apparent alcohol. I could drink this beer this every day of the year!!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M - The carbonation is perfect. The mouthfeel is creamy yet lively. This is one of those beers everyone should try at least once. THIS is how Brett saison's should taste."

"Happy to try but won't rush out for this again."

"Deep gold capped with a tall off-white head that quickly settles to a low, lumpy covering. Big time flower and wood funk in the nose. Dusty cellar, hay, berries, earth, light citrus, and a general spicy sharpness. Taste goes in a more fruity-funk direction starting off tart with a building sweetness being cutoff by a nice acidity and dry finish. Definitely more of a tart, juicy Brett character with this Saison. Flower petals, white wine, and peach pits...not as old and funky-feeling as the smell. Crisp and dry which helps conceal the strength. One of the more interesting Saisons I've had, I think."
"Initially large creamy peach colored head made of tight foam bubbles over golden orange beer. Aroma pours in loads of fruit, wild floral, tart funky, and sunny dandelions. Really fun to smell.... Berries, apples, mango, colorful flowers, sweet orange, spice and pleasant but unusual tropical stink. Taste passes through an array of experiences. Miscellaneous fleshy fruits, dry, smacky, tart, citrus rind-like bitter, flowery and farmy. Carbonation is very fine and evenly disbursed. Juicy, bubbly, slick texture with an easy drinking medium body. Goes down very smooth even with the tart bitterness. There's enough fruit and sunny flowers to balance all that out."

"Pours hazy golden color with nice 2 finger head that is pillowy and beautiful.nose is lemony, Belgian yeast, little bit of grassy funk. Taste closely follows nose IMO. Very refreshing, clean lemony tang. Yeast is upfront as would be expected and the grassy funk from the nose holds on the finish/aftertaste. Not tons of carbonation, but the correct amount. Finishes dry and long. Overall I love this beer, the Brett doesn't outshine the well brewed saison base."
""
""
""
""
"Flavor starts off with nice notes of fruit juice. Notes of pear and apple juice. Nice grainy sweetness that is enveloped by an awesome Brett funk and some good spice. Slight tartness is present with a nice fluffy carbonated body. Mild lemony notes mixed with bread and some oak as well. Solid saison."

"The perfect mix of flavor and drinkability for the big beer summer club, of which I am an honorary member."
"O: 4.75 I really love this saison. I usually like the style and don’t seek them out too often, but this one is really special. The flavors flow and develop beautifully on the palate and each sip is very interesting and you find something new."
""
"O: This is up there with some of the best saisons and being a true farmhouse ale I am thoroughly impressed by this beer. Citrus and funk with a smooth crisp finish. I will buy this again."
"O: A really tasty, fairly uncharacteristic saison."
""
""
""
" The flavor is very good with great brett which is tropical and fruity bringing a juicy and earthy flavor with light spice and citrus tanginess almost grapefruity with mild zest and light hint of pepper in the very dry finish with a mild hop and alcohol taste. Overall I really enjoyed this, I was wishing I could have gotten more, the brett character is excellent and this is perhaps one of the best bretted saisons I have had recently. I recommend this highly."
""
""
""
"dry, crisp, with a nice citrus fruity juiciness"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This is a funky American Saison that is worth the hype. I think this is truly one of the best Saisons I have ever tasted. Complex and funky, but sublimely smooth and eminently drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a really good beer that's extremely easy to drink. The Brett is amazing, as usual. Most of the time I don't care for beers that are subtle, but this is one exception."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A decent example of a Brett inoculated saison but the alcohol bite and huge hop spice is a little too much. I actually have a non-Brett home brewed saison at this abv and made with huge amounts of EKG hops and I have a similar problem. In fact, it tastes almost identical minus the Brett tropical fruit flavors. Glad I tried it tho."
"The finish is dry. A slightly disappointing brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a nice cloudy golden color with a thin white head. Very true to style for a saison, quite nice. Scents of sour brett yeast, apricot, fruity esters and some spicy Belgian yeast. Despite the sour overtones there is a nice underlying frutiness that is the hallmark of a good saison. Very nice, wild, yet very much a saison. Flavor is quite sour upfront with a lemony character alongside sour green apple and green grape skin. In the middle the sourness continues but hints of pepper are also present. Finish is dry and sour with some slightly grainy notes. Aftertaste is sour brett yeast and lemon. A very good, sour saison with a large amount of sourness, yet still with the backbone of the style present. Very nice. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with moderate carbonation and a drying feel. Good, true to style and quite nice. Overall this is an excellent sour saison that provides a good wild sour ale but also an excellent saison. The flavors, aroma and mouthfeel mingle to make this one quite enjoyable. Highly recommended."
"Overall just keripes wow a fantastic saison. It's pear juice?... woah, that explains the green like skin I get perhaps. I think the only thing that doesn't make me score this higher is that it doesn't ""quite"" remind me of a classic big ""brett"" saison."
""
""
""
"All time highlight. Sublime beer. Highly recommended. Will have again."
"Overall, this is a unique take on a brett saison. The pear provides a fruitiness and juiciness that is not always found in a saison, and the brett gives an overall dry flavor character to the drink."
"With the heart of the Belgian and French farmlands in mind, its assuring to know that beer lovers of the Pacific Northwest have more to whet their whistle than only hoppy ale."
""
""
""
"Overall I really enjoyed this session. I wouldn't say I love beers with Brett, but this one had the right amount (and not too much) to make this a solid beer for the style. Perfect warm weather reach for. This was my first venture with the Logsdon crew but definitely not my last. Very reasonably priced as well which is sweet!"

"Orangeish somewhat cloudy pour, with a nice head of light/frothy texture. The frothiness of the head is really outstanding. Somewhat funky finish is preceded by a nice medium bodied mouthfeel. Notes of spice and citrus through to an earthy finish. Nice beer!"

"While there are a number of brett-infused saisons on the market today, Seizoen Bretta takes the cake in terms of overall complexity and mouthfeel. I aged my bottle for nearly a year and would recommend others to do likewise if you want the brett to be kickin'. Just be careful when you pop the cap!"
""
""
""
""
"One of my very favorite saisons, never fails."
""
""
""
""
""
"Yes,,, this is the masterpiece I remembered the first one i had being. This is the epitome of the farmhouse saison style. All Saisons with brett should be judged against this one. Let's get this straight, it's not the BEST saison I've had but it's the one that laid out the cards and said, beat this queens high royal flush."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This is a win, except in the refreshment department; it's a bit heavier than most saisons. The alcohol is well-hidden, though."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-I was excited to try this beer and it did not let me down. The mouthfeel is really nice and drinkable, and it pairs well with the flavor profile here. This is a very balanced beer with a subtle complexity that doesn't hit you over the head with flavor, but still provides plenty to think about on the palate. Unlike a lot of brett beers, i could drink this regularly and repeatedly and not get tired of it."
""
""
""
""

"Light, mildly funky nose and floral, crisp, mildly funky taste. I didn't really have any expectations either way for this brew, but I was so impressed I went out and bought another one immediately. Looking forward to checking out more from these folks."

"Thanks to bstyle for the opportunity to try this 'want'. 750ml bottle served in a Hill Farmstead stem. Best by 04/2018 indicated on the back label. Pours a dull orange hue with a hazy clarity and a fluffy, two inch bright white head that exhibits excellent retention. Head eventually settles into a half inch cap with thick, textured swaths of lacing revealed as the brew recedes. Nose is a bit subdued, but I get tangernine, zest and a hint of spice - it all comes off a bit witte-like. Taste consistent with nose with the addition of a mild Brett presence towards the middle/back - it's not overly bold and has just a slightly medicinal character. Mouthfeel is light and lively with a trace of acidity. Overall, I have to say that I enjoyed this one a bit more than the standard Seizoen; however, I was expecting a bit more Brett. Perhaps some extended cellaring might help bring that quality out."

"light orange with a white head that disappears quickly in a film of a head. Awesome outhouse aroma, with hints of earth, pear, oranges, lemons, hey. There is some slight undertone of funk, like fresh cheese. Taste is sublime, just layers and layers. Very dry but also very much zest. Perhaps the most zesty beer I have tasted. There is also some lemons, very acidic, just explosion of lemon fruits with a perfect carbonation. Some slight hint of peppercorn and spices. Just an awesome saison. Incredibly well executed."

""
"Seizoen Bretta is an excellently made American saison. Juicy fruit, easy going brett additions, and a great nose make this one of the better American versions I've had in a while. The mouthfeel has that Belgian frothy quality but is a touch overdone; minor gripe. I've had my eye on this beer for a while, glad I was finally able to give it a whirl. Thanks again, Scott!"
""
""
"Above average saison, nice mild fruit contribution to an otherwise straightforward saison. In fact, it reminds me of a more tart Orval. I probably wouldn't buy it again since usually when I see it, I'm traveling and usually have other things to bring home. Highly recommend though, to anyone who enjoys a good saison."
""
""
""
"Medium bodied and with strong carbonation and prominent funky brett flavor.  One dimensional with all brett and mineral flavor.  Musty funky and earthy farmhouse yeast along with very subtle citrus fruit and bready yeast character. The mouthfeel is off and there is a surprising lack of complexity.  Disappointing."
""
""
""
"O - A great blend of flavors. Nice to see a beer like this from a US brewery."
""
""
"Overall (4.25): This is a really, really great, brett-forward saison. This beer executes and integrates a really bright, vibrant brett character with a relatively straight-forward, classic-ish (albeit not very spicy or herbal) saison base. It just gets juicier with that tangy fruit character as it warms up, too. Considering how big this is, this is astoundingly bright, easy-drinking, and even kind of light. Extremely full-flavored and easy to drink. Highly recommended!"

"What a beautiful beer this is - it really puts most Brett-infused saisons to shame. I have a feeling that the Brett they are using comes naturally in the barrel, and rather, it further accentuates the fruit and spice notes, as well as the intriguing addition of pear juice that produces secondary fermentation. I'd imagine this would age very well in the bottle - it'd be a little less fruit forward and green, but the dryness and spice plethora would make it even more vinous than it even is. Every variant of their Saizoen series has been fantastic, but for the sake of everyday drinking, this is probably my favorite - and also one of my favorite farmhouse ales made in the US, period."

"O: The nose of this beer is top-notch - I think it's my first ""5" I've awarded in the category. They also nailed the appearance. The typical Belgian brett flavors are there on the tongue and it has the typical Saison dryness. Two criticisms: 1) my bottle was a gusher; and 2) I wish the beer had more body. It seems a tad bit too ""light"" to me. Otherwise, this is an excellent beer."
""
"O: Really good funky, tarty, fruity beer! I really recommend this if you like saisons or brett!"

"Overall, an amazing beer. As a saison lover, this would have to be my favorite saison. Hits the notes from classic Belgian examples but adds the wonderfully fruity, tart brett accent. Well worth seeking out. Honestly don't understand why this isn't massively sought-after."
""
""
"Pale, glowing orange and hazy with a big white foamy head that sticks around for the whole experience. Funky aroma with musty orange, lemon zest, and damp hay. This has a very refined taste - the flavors are mild but also complex and full. Damp earth, with a nice dry finish. Super creamy in the mouth and just a little bit tart and funky. At the same time it's also amazingly light and crisp. Just a wonderfully crafted Saison. The bretta does some great stuff to the beer."

"Pretty gold pour from a 750 mL bomber into my trusty jester king goblet. Soft white head with good retention. Grass, lemon and green apple in the nose. Very dry. Tart. Lots of funk and horse blanket. Tastes terrific. Alcohol well hidden. I would drink this with Stilton and olive tapenade."

""
""
"Balance: This beer's complexity has a delicate balance I don't plan to question. It is on the malty side, though the malts are gentle and light. There is no hops taste specifically but there is an earthy, almost woody quality there (look forward to seeing the difference in the oak aged). The orange fruits and citrus notes are dull but broad - there are no sharp peaks in the flavour profile, but there are no gaps either."
""
""
""
"T: Despite the fairly high abv, this one feels really light and well balanced. Opens with a light, floral note. Then a hit of peach, apricot and some doughy malt. The brett comes in near the finish and I get a nice dryness with some white grape and lemon. A fantastic saison."
""
""
"Gusher alert! Held over the sink, and had glasses ready for this one. Nice pale golden-yellow pour, hazy, with a full taster glass of foam that eventually died down to a thin layer with splotchy lacing. Crisp aroma, brett, fruit salad, wet grass, indistinct spice, floral hops. Taste was crisp and clean as well, light barnyard funk, citrus bringing in a very mellow sourness, essence of pear and peach, white wine, grassy, floral, light spices with a drop of honey sweetness. Not sure how old this bottle was, but regardless, it seemed at its peak. Mouthfeel was tremendous, smooth and light, once again I'll say it: crisp and clean, soft carbonation, easy drinkability with none of the 8%ABV detectable. Really liked this one a lot."
"Mouthfeel is thicker and creamier than many saisons but refreshing nonetheless. Overall, an absolutely top-notch saison and easily one of my favorite brett beers to date."
""
"It would be hard to craft a saison better than this. The carbonation with tiny bubbles is something you notice in the appearance and the mouthfeel and is a highlight of both. You smell the fruity esters and slight funk on the nose that tells you you've got the correct yeast strains. The beer is delicious. Fruity, spicy and everything you'd want in this style. The pear is easily picked up and adds a sweetness that makes this beer so drinkable. I didn't realize that pear juice was utilized, but you can tell right away. A homerun for the style and amongst all styles. Beware of gushers. Have a glass ready."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy orange with billowy white head that fades into a frothy cap. Big nose of Brett, fruity esters and a bit of spice. Hits the palate bitter with nice doughy malt backbone. Finishes dry with a slight funk aftertaste. Mouthfeel is thin and effervescent. An outstanding farmhouse ale."
""

"O/D - Bredd didn't take this over, and that's what I enjoyed about it. It was well integrated with the rest of the flavours. A nice saison with plenty of complexity and no alcohol to speak of."

"I had this beer at Original Gravity in San Jose California. Served in a 12 oz tulip glass for $9. First impression is of a cloudy, straw color with effervescent carbonation streaming up to a very thin head that does not stay around long. Citrus zest nose with a very faint hint of phenol. Tart Granny Smith apples and citrus dominate the flavor. High acidity makes for a nice dry finish, which leaves me refreshed and wanting more! I am very surprised by how much I like this beer."
""
""
"Review 1500! 750 ml bottle into tulip glass, best before 5/2017. Instant violent gusher upon opening. Pours extremely hazy golden orange color with a 3 finger dense and fluffy white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big lemon zest, orange zest, pear, pineapple, peach, apple, pepper, clove, wheat, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance, strength, and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and brett notes, with moderate malt balance. Taste of big lemon zest, orange zest, pineapple, peach, pear, apple, clove, pepper, floral, grass, wheat, and spicy yeast earthiness. Light earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, light fruits, pineapple, clove, pepper, floral, grass, and earthy spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and Brett ester flavors; with light-moderate malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. High carbonation and medium bodied; with a lightly creamy, crisp, and prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an incredible saison style. Fantastic complexity and balance of fruity and spicy ester flavors with moderate malt balance; and extremely smooth to drink. An extremely enjoyable offering."

"Hot damn son. A true American farmhouse with added Brett funk. Crazy complexity and depth, but so light and fresh. I want more of these forever."
"This is a fantastic saison. Like, this is the type of saison that would make someone that would make someone believe in this style. Juicy, tart, funky, and consistently interesting. Awesome stuff."

"Overall, a wonderfully balanced version of the style. The only reason it's not rated higher is because I prefer this subset of the saison style to be a little more in your face, to pack a little more palate wallop. All the same, it's incredibly drinkable and a solid representative of the style."
"a special treat from my rare beer club, decanted after sessioning my homebrew saison to compare how the brett affects this style of brew. the pour on this is pale straw color and hazy with an inch of white head that leaves nice lacing. the nose has a lot of funk to it, some lemon zest and wild yeast. the taste is light, just simple white wheat malt and the crazy yeast and brett, its different than most, lighter, less fruity really, and very summery, pollen heavy, honey sweetness is slight towards the finish. I wouldn't get pear juice if it didn't say so. its super dry, which is nice, but I wish there was more carbonation in this, it just doesn't have the brightness I like in the genre. plenty drinkable though, and a well hidden alcoholic strength. a solid beer overall, and I was impressed with its simplicity yet dynamic flavor profile. a little more carbonation would make this world class, and it has me inspired to do a little experimenting with brett in my own beers..."

"This was my first beer from Logsdon, and I am impressed. This Saison is unique and delicious. Would love to cellar one."

"The flavor comes across as crisp and spicy, even, with a bit of a cracked pepper and orange peel together with an emerging Brettastic funk. It's terrifically effervescent which keeps it light, and each sip invites another. I loved it."

"O: The smell kinda turned me off but the taste was great. Excellent balance of tart and sweet flavors leaving you with a tasty and refreshing saison. Almost no black pepper at all, uncommon in a saison. Mostly fruity and crackery flavors. Very nice saison, I enjoyed it a lot, it's up there with Boulevard Saison-Brett."

"Pour is pure hazed pale gold with tons of tight fluffy white head. Nose is very nice, faint farmhouse yeast up front with a great Brett presence of citrus and apricot, faint spice behind. Taste is more integrated but a little less bright, just slightly. Light farmhouse, nice citrus and peach, faint banana. Strong carbonation and dry finish on the light airy body."

"Appearance is a cloudy golden color with a couple fingers of a bright white head. Its` nose has banana, funk, grains, white pepper and lemon. Sipping on this farmhouse & I taste apricots, belgian yeast, brett, more lemon and candied sugar. Mmm, this tastes pretty damn good. Mouthfeel is medium with great carbonation. It was a treat to try this beer, it was very good overall. I most certainly recommend picking it up or trying it if you are given the opportunity."
"O - The best American made saison I have ever had, I'd even go so far as to say its better than the Hill Farmstead offerings. Its simple and clean with plenty of brett and fruit juice overtones. This has sat for weeks and even still it exploded upon opening. Getting over that I adore this beer."

"#TBS11 and #BOTG 3. Poured from bottle into Hill Farmstead glass. Pours a very cloudy golden orange/yellow color. It may be the light in the room, but the color near the top of the glass lightens to an almost yellow color. Really nice head retention, a creamy appearance of white head. Smell- bready yeast, a little bit of funk. There's a sweetness, almost fruit pear aroma to go along with the bready yeast aroma. Really nice aroma. Taste- sweet creamy breadiness, a little bit of hop bitterness on the sides of my mouth, and on the end, the twangy barnyard funk delivers a little sharp kick with a tart finish to let you know the Brett is in play. The signature of this beer is its mouthfeel (creamy, rich) and it's yeast presence (bready, Brett funk ending) and the sweet malt presence that balances out the beer perfectly. This is one that I've looked forward to for awhile and it lives up to the hype. Well done."
""
"I'll say it: boo this spelling... Anyway, this stuff pours a hazy amber topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises orange juice, potting soil, buttery toffee, and a small smattering of dark greens. So much earth... The taste tones down the earth a ways, but still continues the general trend of dominance on the part of the Brett. Here, there's more of the fruity aspect of the yeast, though the earth and cobweb remain. It's all a bit much in this department, if you ask me, but it's luckily not enough to completely sink the ship of state. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, if you're a Brett fan, you'll find endless entertainment here; otherwise, your tongue might receive something of an overdose..."

"Overall- Very enjoyable, a solid A as far as I'm concerned, maybe even an A+. Very nice to be able to get Belgium quality from an Oregon brewery. It really impresses upon me that I need to take a trip to Upright Brewery to sample their saisons."

"D: A nicely complex and refreshing offering made even more impressive by it's organic qualification. A solid take on the style and extremely well-crafted with some unique touches (the brett strain is less aggressive than many and the pear adds a surprisingly nice aspect). A perfect beer to enjoy outside on a cool, but sunny spring day."
"Taste: very spicy with hints of grapes, musty in middle, ""horse blanket"" lasts throughout, can taste malt at very end as it warms up, smooth mouth feel."

"Seven-fifty trucked back from the promised land, dosed out into a Hill Farmstead wine-style glass. Slight, slow gusher, gorgeous golden amber - hazier with each pour - with a full bone white head, long retention, and some lace. Nose of lovely fresh-hay brett, dried herbs - sage, stone fruit skin, pear, roses, dried fruits - lemon, papaya, mango, cleanly malted and mildly hopped. Lively, palate cleansing carbonation, light bodied. The overriding flavor of cleanly funky brett does great things on a crisp pils malt body. Immediately pops into a drying, dusty vitamin-c funk with flavors of dried sage, lemon, hay, and stone fruits weaving in and out. Sat around six months no worse for the wear - a thoughtfully executed beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"They take their Brett seriously over at Logsdon - this baby was no joke. Aroma had me thinking it would be mostly tart and a little funky, but it was just the opposite. Certainly not a bad thing, though. The flavors work well together and the funk is controlled pretty well - it just has to be what you're looking for. Can't wait to try the Peche n' Brett."

"The body was light, smooth, clean and very dry. Drinkability was excellent, I shared this bottle, and was almost wishing I had kept all for myself (that's OK, I've another in long-term storage). Overall, an excellent beer. Worth seeking out or trading for. I'll just go to the store and grab another bottle."

"Overall, it's decent, but I wish the peach flavor was more concentrated. In my opinion, it's a mistake to use a brett beer as a base. The flavors are just too overpowering and so less focus is left for the fruit. For a true classic in this vein, try Cantillon's Fou Foune (you might have to go to Brussels for this). Fou Foune could teach this beer some lessons - it has sharp acidity that brings out the fruit, extreme complexity, and exquisite balance. Wild yeasts all the way!!"

"Logsdon seizoen brett pours a beautiful hazy gold with a fluffy white head. Funky and slightly sour in the aroma with hint of citrus. There is just a hint of pale malt sweetness that quickly leads into a dry, slightly tart and sour funk. The classic saison flavors are there and blend perfectly with the flavors from the brett."
"Poured a pale murky orange in color with pale yellow highlights and a nice half finger of head that left some good bubbly lacing sticking to the glass. Lots of funky brett upfront in the aroma with plenty of citrus character, mild spice, signs of apple fruit, subtle herbs and tart qualities. Like the aroma there was plenty of bretty funk with citrus zest accents, good oaky character, a touch of spice alongside a little applesaucey flavor, subtle herbs and mild sweetness. The brew was medium in bdoy with a good amount of carbonation. Which had a semi sweet, mild fruity, funky, slight spice, citrusy and tart finish. Just the way I like my saisons and these guys know how to do it."

"This beer looks darker than your average saison, with a nice golden yellow, smells great with some nice tropical fruit coming from the brett, but it's the flavor that really makes this one shine. It's awesomely drinkable at 8% and has an incredible fruity flavor to it with a nice balance that keeps it from being too sweet. Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated and rather dry. Overall, an amazing beer - I wish I had access to this year-round!"

"The beer is orange and hazy with a quarter inch of white head. The aroma brings lemon rind, orange peel, grass, floral hops, citrus. Smells nice. The flavor imparts orange citrus, floral hops, a touch of wild yeast. Medium bodied with a slightly bitter finish. Lingering floral hops."

"The newer batches that get sent to VT are horendus. No carb and straight paint thinner"
"Pours a nice unfiltered golden orange with a thick cream colored head. The smell is very bretty (in a good way) without the vinegar hints of a more traditional sour. Taste is a great balance of malt, brett and a hint of citrus and hops at the end. Purchased at Whole Foods in Pasadena, CA."

"O: Plenty of shifting scents and flavours while still crisp and clean overall. Enjoyed this Seizoen with an arugula salad and baked sockeye salmon, perfect pairing with this meal because of the lemon pith flavour and crisp clean taste. Watch out - the big bottle and the incognitio 8% alcohol really sneaks up."

"Pours cloudy orangeish yellow, white head with nice retention. Nose is scented with lemon, sourdough, brett funk, nice balance.

"M: Very dry for the strength with a lovely creaminess on the palate."
"The beer poured a cloudy straw yellow with explosive carbonation and 3 inches of sticky white head after a careful pouring. Once the beer had a chance to settle (and more could finally be poured into the glass) the bottle's depths revealed dense chunks of tan brett that re-submerged at the bottom of my nonic. The nose was fruity, harsh, and immensely bretty. It tasted like barnyard. The mouthfeel was citrusy, slightly tart, dry, and medium bodied. Nothing about the beer qualifies it as refined (although you can't spell refined without rind...kind of like a lemon rind at points). Honestly, I could see this beer having a time and place, like when I'm in a bretty mood, but I may stick with saisons that possess more honey-like sweetness in the future."

"Nice farmhouse for sure with a great yeast profile, very drinkable stuff and no mention of booze anywhere Cheers Matt for bringing this one"
"Overall pretty much what I expected, tasty, nice Brett funk, nice tropical fruit juice and pear flavor, light saison, except for the eruption quite nice."
"Seizoen Bretta pours a light bodied clover honey gold in color with a nice and soapy two finger, off white head. It looks great. The nose is bright and lush. There is a good amount of Brett, some barnyard funk, fruity esters, pear, hay, and wildflower notes. It's really earthy. The flavors are complex as well. The first things to hit your taste buds are the floral components and Brett. It drinkslight and yeasty with a good amount of earth. it has a fruity, grassiness to it. Luckily the Brett doesn't dry it out too much. It's very flavorful. It drinks light and off dry and is quite sessionable. I like it a lot. This is a very well made saison and one worth searching for. I had been wanting to try Logsdon for awhile and I'm glad this didn't disappoint."
"O - Overall this wasn't a bad beer even though it erupted from the bottle. Super enjoyable."
""
"O: A decent Saison, but I don't really get what all the fuss is about. The aroma is very subdued. The flavor is a bit more flavorful, but is pretty straight forward."

"O: Awesome. I really enjoyed this beer. It's in my favorite style, and this thing delivers. I'd love to have more exposure to Logsdon beers in the future."

"Pours a hazy light orange with a solid head. Smells of farmy grass, orange custard, sour apples, pears, pepper, and a hint of bready sweetness. Tastes crisp, fresh, apple skin tart, dry, and doughy. Hops aren't making a big impression... maybe just some herbal and citric notes that fill out the flavors form the yeast. Finishes quick, dry, and slightly tart with a bit of lingering lemon custard and green pear juiciness. Light bodied with spicy carbonation. Very crisp for 8%... would prefer it be a bit lower ABV but what can you do? Top notch stuff!"
""
"O: A great introduction to these guys. The flavour I really liked, but I was just waiting for something to push it over the top. Nevertheless, a fun beer to delve into and an interesting saison."
"Pours a murky orange with a foamy bone colored head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, citrus zest, yeast, and Brett. Taste is much the same with a slight tart and funky finish. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."

"Shared by cmrillo during BRoss242’s send-off party before he moves! Will miss you man! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured a yellow-orange with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, funk, earth, spice, and fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, funk, fruit, and earth. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. This one definitely showcased the Brett if I am honest. Nice funky notes going on that mixed very well with the fruit aspect going on. This kept my palate on its toes and ready for each sip. Definitely worth trying if you get the opportunity."
""
"O: This beer is amazing, reminded me of HF E."
"This is a good and interesting saison. The brett does give it a bit of an earthy kick, but there is also an orange citrus tone to it. The overall tone on this one is an earthy one though. Robust and hearty. Flavor profile is even and consistent. This reminds me of New Glarus' R&D Golden Ale and slightly of Orval as well. Regardless, this is very nicely done. Glad I walked a mile to go buy it. The only drawback is my bottle was a gusher and I lost some beer. Tragedy indeed."
""
""
"This is a medium to light bodied brew that is excessively carbonated not only visually and in the feel but it also carries over into the flavor. Overall its a solid brew that I would drink again but it needs to be cleaned up a bit to fall in line with the heightened level of talk/respect that was surrounding this."

"D - Very drinkable. The Brett adds some nice complexity to the beer while still staying very balanced."

"The brett on here does well with the pear juice and clings to the light biscuit malt quite well. Good spice, great feel. Slight funk and tartness. Very quenching."
"One of the better saisons I've had, for sure. Doesn't quite hit the level of Boulevard's Saison-Brett, but it's just a step below that. Very very tasty, and one I would definitely drink again."
"O: Another enjoyable offering from Logsdon. I was very impressed with this one. A fine job keeping the characteristics of a classic saison with an addition of brettanomyces. Well done."
"The pour is an orange color with a tall white head. Nice bretty nose on this with good funky, earthy aromas and a fair amount of fruit. Citrus is certainly prominent, as is a touch of tropical fruit. A mild, but pleasant spice note and some sweet bread. The flavor is fairly dry but a touch of sweetness/malt remains. More citrus fruit character on the nose along with a touch of grass, earth, and pepper. Really interesting and enjoyable."
"O- Damn this an excellent saison! Until now Fantome Saison had been my unimpeachably favorite saison (when you get a good bottle), but this is a serious contender for my new favorite. The flavors are absolutely delicious and it's very drinkable as well. I would go out of my way to have this beer again, great stuff."
""
""
"Nice looking brew, leaves great lace. Funky yeast meets citrus in a harmonious blend of flavors. Smooth, crisp, and clean with lingering lemon. Properly carbonated (!). Saisons aren't typically my fav style but this is tasty."
"An enjoyable offering from an up and coming brewery. As for Saisons with Brett, this is only my second but it lacks a lot of the intagibles that you'd find in Boulevard's version. Might be better to grab another bottle and hang onto it for a couple of years to let the funk further develop."

"Best by 5/2017. Pours a very hazy, golden-orange color with a large white head that goes down at a steady pace. Scent is initially pungent with pear juice and lemon zest. Some nice, peppery aromas with other tingly spices...making this smell very fresh and crisp. As the beer warms, the pear scent really come through. Somewhat funky...not as much as I was hoping for, but some definite tart aromas. Taste is initially tart! More tart than I had expected. Tart lemon and orange peel with canned pears juice flavors. Great pepper and spice to this one...tingling the tongue and the taste buds. Although the Brett was not very noticeable in the aroma, it is definitely present in the flavor. Great Brett flavor with a mellow funkiness. Some hops in the finish. Very refreshing! Mouthfeel is medium bodied, dry, and crisp. ABV well-hidden. Drinkability is very high. Overall, it's not every day you come across a beer from a brewery you've never heard of or had anything from and are blown away. This beer is fantastic, and I look forward to try anything else these guys put out. Also, I love the angle they're going with."
""
"Very nice saison. It's not particularly good looking for the style. Not really a complaint; there just happen to be some great looking saisons. Pours medium gold. A bit murky. The head puffs up but fades away relatively quickly. There's a wonderful depth to the saison yeast flavor in both taste and aroma. It smells like peaches, strawberries, grass, hay and fresh grain. Mild to medium funk. Compared to the normal version, the brett is easy to spot, which I had been told was not the case. It's more fruit funk than barnyard, closer to Sanctification than a funk bomb. The taste is medium tart. There's a bit too much body to call it dry, but I'm not getting much sweetness, either. It's got lemons, apples, oranges and a lightly bitter/astringent finish. Great stuff. The mouthfeel is round, though not heavy, and the finish dries it out. It's just a really tasty beer. I guess it shouldn't really be a shock that Dave Logsdon knows his way around yeast flavor, but I'm still quite impressed. It definitely stands out, even though the regular Seizoen and Kili Wit are also quite good. I'd love to try the Peach version or any other Logsdon beers."

"O: This puts Saison Brett to shame. The aromas were good but the flavor is amazing. I don't like sour beers but this is great and what I expected when I had my first sour."

"O- very good saison, but expected more sour and funk."
"A joy to drink. I've had this probably four times now and have loved it each time."
"Smelling of fresh wet hay, plenty of spicy phenolics alongside some lemony citrus esters, this bright and highly carbonated hazy orange amber brew features a complex nose and flavor profile, likely due in no small part due to a brettanomyces yeast addition and bottle conditioning. Very dry, a touch grassy, with just enough barnyard on the tongue to make things interesting without overpowering the soft malt balance amidst its peppery and lemony profile. Absolutely delicious, one of the best (if not the very best) farmhouse ale I've had the privilege to enjoy. This one is worth seeking out."
"Overall: Great saison. Logsden really makes great Farmhouse beers. Another benchmark beer in the saison beer family."
"Very nice Brett infused saison here. I'm no saison expert but it's one of my favorite styles and this one is right up there with Saison Brett to me. Worth seeking out!"
"O: This is a great brett saison that I really knew nothing about before trying it out. I think it would be hard to not like this. Perhaps I am not a fair critic of this as none of the flavors are strange to me, but I could see a person who had never heard of a farmhouse ale even liking this. Smooth crisp and refreshing."

The nose is a delicious and tantalizing melange of tart orchard fruit including underripe peach, apple and pear. There is also a very green grassy note with some undertones of white grape tannin. The whole thing is rounded out by a Brett nuance that is somewhere between Band-Aid and pineapple, and more toward the former than the latter. Taste-wise, it is very refreshing and juicy, though not terribly sweet. There are tart tropical fruity notes to lead the way: guava, passion fruit and papaya are implied along with the aforementioned orchard fruits. There is also a bit of a lemony citrus zest note. The feel is authentically Belgian, though the beer is domestic; the expansive creaminess, the balance between refreshing and toothy; they have nailed it all. A very very good beer overall; one I definitely want more of."
"Shrug. A decent enough beer, but nothing to get very excited about either."
"This is a really solid saison with some great Brett notes. The Brett is quite dominant but that is my style and I think that this really works."
"5.7/10"
"Lot's of fruity flavor and body in this Saison. On tap was a little more mild, in the bottle had a stiffer head. Good either way"
