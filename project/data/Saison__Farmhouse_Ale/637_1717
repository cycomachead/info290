However, I can also say that this beer has struck me, as often as not, as a merely good (not great) representation of the style. Not sure how to account for the discrepancy except to suggest that 'fresher is better'. But I'd strongly recommend it either way.","biegaman","Mar 29, 2015"

4.49,7.4,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured a gorgeous cloudy golden body with one and a half fingers of thick, foamy head. Overall impression of appearance is of a nice saison, very true to form. Scents of light tea, moderate levels of honey, light dank, cellar-like aromas, high levels of floral hops with some herbal character, spicy phenols at a moderate level with notes of clove and white pepper, sweet, fruity aromas, particularly orange and tangerine at high levels. Overall impression of flavor is of a fantastic saison. It captures the fruity character of the style nicely, with a good hit of phenols and a nice presence of hops, true to the style. A good, classic saison that is quite nice. Flavor begins lightly dry with notes of honey and medium-high levels of floral, herbal hops with medium-light notes of lemon zest, light phenols with a white pepper character and a bit of fruity esters with an orange quality. Middle is lightly dry with notes of honey, spicy phenols with notes of white pepper, herbal hops and a light hint of alcohol. Finish is dry with notes of herbal hops, some spicy hops, notes of white pepper, softly sweet malt and a light lemon zest and orange zest character. Aftertaste is dry with notes of herbal and spicy hops and a bit of white pepper. Overall impression of flavor is of a classic saison, nothing off, fantastic, balanced and true to style. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with effervescent carbonation, some prickly tartness and an overall drying feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of an excellent true to style saison. Quite nice. Overall this is an amazing saison. It has a wonderful aroma and flavor, truly fitting the style, and a mouthfeel that compliments the flavor.","Auraan","Mar 27, 2015"

A light fruit, pineapple nose combines with light bread aromas and a trace of well ripened fruit. It starts crisp and dry on the plate with a trace of fruit – primarily orange – that becomes more prominent as it warms seasoned with spice and a hint of sweetness over biscuity malt. A moderate hop accent brings it together on the finish. It has medium to medium high carbonation and a refreshing, medium body.  If you get a good one, the large green 75 cl bottles are better the brown 33 cl ones but about one in 4 of the larger bottles is skunky.","pat61","Jan 30, 2015"

This beer is a tad heavy on the hops for my taste, obscuring most of the malt profile and likely much of the yeast complexity as well. This drank closer to a hoppy wheat ale than a saison for me. Other folks will likely find this to be balanced and more complex.","UrbanCaveman","Dec 08, 2014"

4.5,7.7,,,,,,"The actual taste differs a lot from the aromas. It evokes a much warmer feeling on the palate, than the aromas revealed, due to soft yeast, straw, peppery hints, tart lemon, pear and spices. Has an incredibly smooth mouthfeel, which is just outraging soft on the palate, with added complexity from the slightly biting, savory spices among peppery notes and lively, metallic carbonation. Pleasant, floral hops act as an enjoyable counterpart, with the addition of earthy malts, to the sweeter spices. The palate is simply perfect, substantial and round up front, finishing very dry and lightly fizzy. Outstanding well balances beer, which is close to perfection in taste with a particular complex body.","aleigator","Nov 04, 2014"

Tastes mellow and of fresh milky oats and grains. Finishes with grAssy earthiness. Not a bright green grass taste, but more of a dusty grey dried out grass in late summer. After a few sips some of the earthiness melts away and just leaves a mellow sweetness with a very mild caramel sugar. Pretty darn tasty. I expected this to be a little more delicate, but still refreshing. For being widely regarded as the best saison ever, I think my expectations were a little high.","constantine_272","Aug 28, 2014"

3.87,-7.4,4.5,3.75,3.75,4,4,"A classic Belgian Saison Ale which pours slightly cloudy to a brilliant golden color. A abundance of carbonation leaves a huge fluffy head which lasts much longer than most heads. Fabulous lacings remain while the ale is consumed. The taste is citrusy, crisp, dry and effervescent. The flavor is nicely balanced and ends with a slightly bitter finish - which in this case is a plus. The alcohol content is 6.5% which is a little higher than most saisons and is also a good thing. The ale came in a 75 cl bottle format.","rhino110","Jul 03, 2014"

Some of the American breweries that are making the style are mucking it up with all these herbal additions, leave the yeast to do the job my friends and it should speak for itself.

Needless to say, this is an absolute must-drink for any true beer geek. Pairing options are endless, but salads and lighter fare are easy choices. White fish and chicken as well, along with a multitude of different herb and spice combos. Fried portobello mushrooms just popped into my head too, maybe play up the funk a little bit. It's very versatile, as it won't overwhelm the more delicate dishes, but can cut through bolder flavors and richer textures as well.","ryan1788a5","Dec 11, 2013"

Delightful aroma of bananas and biscuity bread, with enough spiciness to be interesting but not overwhelmingly cloved. Well balanced taste features the Belgian yeast more prevalently, but is again not unpleasantly one dimensional. There are enough malted grains to support the banana and coriander without being overpowered, and a respectably clean bitterness in the finish.","hopsolutely","Nov 14, 2013"

Maybe its been sitting on display for almost 9 months. Maybe…it’s just beer. Whatever the case is, time and a green bottle has done nothing to diminish the appearance of the beer as it comes out a hazy golden straw color with a generous cloud of foam that doesn’t want to dissipate. Big, airy bubbles give off an aroma full of green apple zest and dampened straw. First taste coats the mouth with a bubbly, funky, inviting mix of pleasing, welcome flavors. I imagine green apple nectar, a light floral pollen-like delicate touch, mixed with a pleasing crisp and edgy acidity. Some damp straw, a dry finish, effervescent vitality. My only question is, can I have some more? With the moderate ABV and a 750 ml bottle all to my lonesome the answer is yes, yes I can.","elNopalero","Oct 18, 2013"

3.74,-10.5,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Classic saison that arrived a pale straw with ample white head. Aroma was a bit subdued but yeasty esters and citrus were notable along with some herbs and peanut butter sweet malt. In the mouth, beer was a heady mix of orange spice tea, lemon, clove, white pepper, herbal perfume, apple, and cashew brittle, all integrated well with a dry bitter finish. Did not notice the funk that some describe. Pleasing combination of malt and spice with a dryness that evokes champagne and a surprising nuttiness.","CalgaryFMC","Sep 17, 2013"

Don't misunderstand me, I'd still have one of those as often as they come, but I've tasted some products, even within the Dupont brewery itself, that pleased me much more than this still very fine beer.","FrostBlast","Sep 15, 2013"

APPEARANCE: pale, cloudy yellow heather body with a half-glass mushroom cloud of soft white head--as attractive as C.J. Spiller, my first rounder... AROMA: clean, grassy, lemony roundness with enough vanilla and citrus medley to complicate the nostrils ...PALATE: goodness, this is easy-drinking; a slightly warming finish does little to detract from the beer's pleasant front-end presence and sipability...TASTE: a touch of sourness denotes the citrus presence, while the overall flavor is soft hoppy goodness, like a freshly mown lawn wafting... OVERALL: after the Dogfish Head 60 yesterday and this today, I probably could retire from summer beer drinking; as I remembered it, a refreshing, almost euphoric bottle that makes one question the need for another night's drink; enough alcohol to be significant, weak enough to be enjoyed more than once...","dacrza1","Aug 25, 2013"

Not cheap, but I don't expect a specialty Belgian ale to be cheap by any means. This one is worth it.","SmashPants","Feb 02, 2013"

The nose is light and yeasty with orange peel, lemon rhind, aged hops, Belgian yeast, and a light floral character. The flavors too, are light and citrusy. There is a light orange sweetness followed by the lemon bitterness, a touch of corn, old hops, and light hibiscus and tea. I would say I prefer the nose a little more. It drinks very light and is definitely sessionable and easy to drink. This would be great for warmer weather. Overall this is a fine saison and one that at $10 is a must try.","aasher","Jan 19, 2013"

4.22,1,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 5/1/2012. Pours hazy bright golden amber color with a nice 2-3 finger fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big lemon, apple, pear, pepper, clove, straw, hay, floral, earth, wheat, light leather, and funky yeast esters. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy esters. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, pepper, clove, straw, hay, grass, earth, floral, light leather, and lightly funky yeast spiciness. Fair amount of earthy spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, pepper, clove, straw, wheat, hay, earth, and lightly funky yeast spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice flavor complexity and balance; with zero cloying flavors on the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a lightly slick and fairly crisp and foamy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent saison! Great flavor complexity and balance; and very smooth to sip on this the high carbonation. A highly enjoyable offering as expected.","superspak","Jan 16, 2013"

This beer had very good drinkability, it was very smooth, with some nice flavors that held my attention, I can see myself drinking a couple of these during the summertime. What I liked the most about this beer was how clean and complex it was, nothing was muddled and there was a good amount going in the aroma and taste. What I liked the least about this beer was the price, I know it's not cheap to import awesome beer from Belgium, but it's a little too pricey for me to buy often, if it was cheaper I could see myself drinking this often in the summertime. I would buy this beer again, but only once in a while, I recommend this beer to just about anyone. All in all I enjoyed this beer and it gave me a good idea as to what a traditional Belgium Saison tastes like, it was pretty good but I have had a couple American Saisons that are just about on the same level. I'll have to be on the look out for more beers from this brewery.","StoutHunter","Dec 30, 2012"

Strong & prickly carbonation, and a dryish finish. For a beer I have heard so much about, and in the midst of saison tasting, this beer just didn't do it for me.

This is the third separate bottle I have purchased in an attempt to rate this beer fairly, but after wasting $25+ on skunked beers, I have come to the conclusion that if the brewer is dumb enough to put a beer in a green bottle, they deserve a horrible rating if the beer is skunked. Other than the skunked notes, there is a little citrus and spice. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Overall, a gross, yet I can’t say unexpected, beer.

Vigorous carbonation accentuates a spiced flavor that matches the aroma. Belgian yeast character asserts itself up front. There's some citrus and banana, but they're well-controlled and not cloying as is sometimes the case. The finish is crisp and dry, giving the palette ample opportunity to reset between sips. A nebulous, mild barnyard funk manifests itself as the glass warms, adding a touch of complexity. A hint of pepper is lurking somewhere in there as well. This is a very crisp and refreshing saison, well-deserving of the stellar reputation that preceded it. Impossible to turn down on a warm summer's day.","MaximalC","May 10, 2012"

It smells mildly of grass and grain. Taste is delightful with citrus, grapefruit, grass, grain, and a slow to reveal but long burn from a hops finish.

4.42,5.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured on-tap and served in a stemmed vase, the beer is a hazy, opaque, yellow-gold coloring with a thick, foamy, small bubbled, bright white head about a half an inch thick. Aromas are yeasty, with hints of clove and floral highlights. Very light and spicy on the nose. Flavors are very spiced, with a solid clove profile along a citrus and bready blended foundation. Some lavendar and juniper highlights throughout...this beer is well balanced and extremely complex at the same time. Very good challenge to the palate. The aftertaste is clove spiced and toasty, and the light body leaves a sparse lacing on the glass. The finish is slightly lingering, but light and spicy. Good brew.","GarthDanielson","Mar 09, 2012"

A nice bready malt base sits underneath the sharp, crisp, hoppy and bitter flavors. It finishes with a slight bitterness that lingers. A lot of the aroma comes thru here with the flavor as well. this beer has a nice creamy mouthfeel and strong carbonation. Overall, this is a classic for a good reason, it's just so unique and enjoyable, although the very bitey and crisp flavors may be somewhat of an acquired taste.

There is maybe a little citrus flavor in there from the hops as well. The MF is very crisp, clean, and carbonated.

3.62,-13.4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"From the caged, corked green bottle. Sampled on December 17, 2011. The cork explodes off the bottle and flies into the next room and the foam erupts out of the bottle. The pour is cloudy yellow with a tremendous long-lasting foamy head. The aroma is a nice mixture of yeast, light grains, citrus, and a pleasing hop bite. Very typical of a Belgian Farmhouse. The body is light to medium but also creamy. The taste has a dash of pepper mixed in with the light malts and vaguely sour finish. It is too bad they don't put it in a brown bottle.","puboflyons","Dec 17, 2011"

4.06,-2.9,5,4,4,4,4,"I used a gentle pour as per the brewery who I e-mailed for directions. They like the lees to remain in the bottle as long as possible, if not infinitely. My motto since childhood has been "Waste not, want not" and so I usually reserve that last pout for yours truly. I poured into a champagne flute from the Seabee Ball in 1998 and damned if it did not look like champagne. It was a golden-yellow color under a puffy head of bone-white head that slowly fell, leaving a touch of lacing in its wake. The effervescence was unending and I just gazed at its beauty, enthralled. The nose was fruity in a berry field sort of way with an underlying mustiness of newspapers stored in the attic. Mouthfeel was thin-to medium and the flavor was initially vinous, giving way to a dusty, musty tartness. Holy spit in the ocean, Batman! This was deelish and I could totally see it as the champagne toast at my never-to-be wedding since no one will ever have me as more than an amusing lover. Finish was bone-dry and I think that this might act as a nice panty peeler. I must try it out on some femmes in the near future ...","woodychandler","Nov 20, 2011"

Slight champagne like effervescence that lingers before settling into a sweet and slightly tart, dry finish.

The aroma was of a straw like malt, a nice dose of floral hops and a moldy yeast with notes of citrus and some spices. It tasted mildly bitter and acidic with hints of citrus and clove at first and finished a bitter-sour with a strong wheat note and with a nice dose of hops at the end.

I’m a big fan of the flashy hop presence and its crisp, refreshing bite. This is a fantastic summer ale if there ever were one. Yeah, the nose could use a little more muscle and the body could be a little bigger. Those are small chinks in its armor though.

1.24,-70.3,2.5,1,1,1.5,1.5,"The beer itself looks innocent enough, pouring a nice hazy, bronze-yellow with a healthy puff of head. But it smells like a compost heap. Maybe some lemon notes coming through, but that just makes it smell like compost with lemon on it. It tastes like rotting hay and manure. Seriously like manure. And the aftertaste is of--you guessed it--manure. I've had other farmhouse ales, and they didn't taste like someone added rotted hay and the fecal output of a horse during the brewing process, which is all I really get from this, and there's just no two ways about it. Funk is good, hay is good; I don't mind those qualities in a beer. But not horse crap, seriously. I've tried: I've choked this down on the occasions I've ordered it, but really...not good...quite simply not a good beer. There's no complexity here, and if there is, well, I'm sorry but I just can't detect it within the overbearing manure. I would almost prefer a Bud to this. Sorry. Start bottling it correctly, and then we'll talk higher ratings.","Rifugium","Jun 10, 2011"

Medium body with a somewhat dry finish.","rundocrun","Jun 08, 2011"

The taste is quite dry with a strong alcoholic component and a moderate fruity quality and a hint of spice. Hops are present throughout, without being overbearing. The finish is long and fairly clean with a touch of spice. On the palate it is light-medium in body with a dry texture and average carbonation. Overall, this is a good saison.

After the pour the fluffy head reached to an impressive 1.75 inches. The smell is slightly difficult to describe, I will attribute that to the funk, I do detect notes of lemon and grass. This also smells kind of boozy, but it is something i do not detedt in yhe taste. This is just wonderful to drink on a warm day in the sub, the flavors match the warm weather so well. The beer touches my tongue with a bit of light malty sweetness. As the beer crests my tongue the carbonation lifts it up, letting it crash once more against my palate with a strong taste of lemon that lingers for a bit as well as a bit of spice. The mouthfeel is just as it should be a nice medium body with aggressive carbonation.

Very herbal and earthy, but fresh and citrusy at the same time. Flavor is very nice, upfront and good body and mouthfeel. Carbonation is a bit prickly, but subtle. Citrus fruits and bready malt linger on the finish. Overall a very reliable saison, but for the price range, ill stick with my DIPA's.","Tripphop","May 05, 2011"

There is also a lot of fruit and bread aromas. Taste is just like it smells, except with some pleasant bitterness. The citrus really comes through in the taste with the barnyard funk. Some grainy flavors with a nice bitter finish. Mouthfeel is nice and medium-bodied with a smooth, crisp finish. Drinkability is quite high, especially on a warm summer day. Overall, I absolutely love saisons, however, this is not my absolute favorite. It is up there though in the top 10 or 20.","DovaliHops","May 03, 2011"

Definitely a good beer for a warm spring evening, and it would work really well in the summer. I feel though that I need to have it with food though. By itself it's good....but I keep wanting something to eat with it. Definitely a sipping and savoring beer, despite its warm weather quenching quality. Definitely a good beer that I'll have to revisit sometime.","damndirtyape","Apr 13, 2011"

4.08,-2.4,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Reviewed from notes. 750ml bottle split with buddies. So often I get light struck bottles of this, thank goodness this wasn't one. Perfect stram yellow, just oh so hazy. Tiny bubbles cruise to the top of the glass under a dense whipped cream head. Sheets upon sheets of lacing cascade down the glass. Spicy, zesty and peppery aroma, just a hint of farmhouse. Simple and well presented flavors here backed by a basic malt bill of pils. Grassy noble hops make there presence known and then that great yeast. Spicey and earthy with highlights of citrus and coriander. Real well attenuated, dry. When one gets a good bottle of dupont there really isn't much better.","pmlondrigan","Apr 09, 2011"

4.03,-3.6,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Jumping right back into the Saisons with one of the most well-known examples of the style in Saison Dupont. 750 mL bottle poured into a tulip glass. Light golden color with a fizzy head that forms quickly and dissipates almost as fast. I get a lot of sour tartness in the nose, with a white grape funkiness going on along with some slight skunkiness. This one has been in my fridge since purchase, but I get this earthy basement smell out of it. First taste takes me by surprise, but in a good way. Mouthfeel is nice and dry, with a good, almost sour bitterness. Taste is light and lemony, with some earthy hops giving it a nice musky feel. Towards the end of the drink I get this pepper sweet - almost green pepper - note. This thing would be great on a warm summer day. It's not sweet like other saisons can be, and the bone dry finish literally makes the mouth water. Overall a very nice saison and one I won't be afraid to reach for in the future.","eclaycamp","Apr 08, 2011"
3.23,-22.7,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"O - While this beer isn't offensive in any way, it's completely lacking in flavor which makes it hard to believe it's worthy of the high score it's received. That leads me to question whether there's something wrong (besides a little skunk) with this bottle.

The malt character is thin and there's a mild but complimentary hops presence. The after-taste is spicy and slightly sweet. Crisp and very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, very clean finish.

The beer pours a very hazy blonde and that huge head of course leaves a beautiful lace. The aroma has just the nicest hint of funk, along with some very earthy, fruity, and yeasty aromas. Everything is just in it's right place with the beer, and you can really tell that this recipe has been perfected over a considerable amount of time. This is not to say that this is a refined beer, because it very much is not, but this rustic nature is part of the great harmony of this brew. The flavor is at once dry and funky followed by pronounced fruitiness of apples and some citrus. There are certainly bubblegum notes but that is not to say that we are dealing with anything cloyingly sweet. Oh and it is hoppy too, the spiciness of the hops albeit is not the dominant flavor but lends well to the harmony of the dry and fruity flavors.","BieresDesMoines","Feb 21, 2011"

I get some faint hints of lemon and orange peel along with a soft, wheaty malt. The flavor is as equally light and delicate as the aroma. There's some slight herbal, floral bitterness balanced out by hints of pepper, cracked wheat, lemon, banana and clove.

MAkes for some nice lacing on the glass. Light Malt. Very clean, Light and refreshing mouthfeel. light malty sugar with lemon in aftertaste. Very well done. I like the carbonation left on the back of the tougue at the end. Slight dryness on the finish with pale citrus peel feel. Feeling in the back of your mouth light and tart, could have a bit of a peppery effect. Not really picking up on the big sour that some get, but a great example of style.

The nose had a strong aroma of citrus & coriander, hints of grapefruit. The beer is medium-bodied, slightly sour to start, but evens off as the hints of citrus & fruit come forward, finishes with a dry aftertaste. Pretty true to the saison style possibly a bit more sour aftertaste than most. Still an excellent saison.","Prospero","Dec 08, 2010"

I think I understand why this beer is well ranked, but it just isn't for me. Bottom line, buyer be ware. This isn't a beer for "advanced pallets" it's a beer for those that enjoy this style of beer.

Flavor is outstanding, changes throughout the bottle both as the beer warms and as I pour the last yeast-laden dregs into it the glass. Just wonderful. Tart, spicy, herbal and a hint of lemongrass.

The head erupts up from the liquid to make a beautiful towering pillow of rocky foam, and leaves beautiful lace in its wake. The Aroma is wonderful. Fruity and funky with a pleasant graininess. Green apple, pear, citrus, a perfume of floral and herbal aromas and white pepper all mingle in my nostrils. The flavor seems to be both delicate and robust at the same time. It has a tart and slightly lactic attack that gives way to a wonderful grainy malt profile. Herbal hops and notes of pear and citrus also mingle about in my mouth. Peppery spice and lemon grass are also there, and I find it hard to describe all the flavors as they seem to transform as I sip. The body is on the light side of medium and mouthfeel is full of carbonation. It is a bit tingly on the tongue, but at the same time it's also smooth. Super drinkable and super delicious.

ReaLoy floral flavors with some rose pedal, white asparagus and some pink peppercorns on the tip of the tongue. Has a nice bitter mid palate and subtle sweetness on the finish to balance out this saison. Slight skunky notes of hot rubber and some bacon fat but still tasty. These green bottles need to go.

Aroma is not overpowering, and features a very pleasant hops tartness and green apples upfront, with notes of maltiness present in the background. Taste features more muted tartness and green apples, along with a bit of "barnyard" presence. Decent mouthfeel, featuring a restrained level of carbonation.

Taste is slightly less agressive then the scent dictates, but still bold fr the style. The grassy, lemmony, spicy and herbal hops dominate the palate while a backbone of nice bready yeasts and clean malts provide the backbone... a touch of alcohol and some muddled, earthyness pop up from sip to sip.

4.28,2.4,4.5,4,4,4.5,5,"Hazy golden body with carbonation showing itself with a big foaming head. It actually falls pretty quickly. The color is really nice. In the aroma, this one is all about the yeast and letting it shine. Nose is distinctly funky Belgian - it has that earthy barnyard aroma with a nice fruitiness, including pear and apple. The taste actually has a nice crisp maltiness holding it together with the yeast playing a more subtle role, adding some light fresh fruitiness. Carbonation is on the higher side, but really makes it refreshing. Plenty of body for a beer this dry. A subtle raw earthiness to it.

Bready malt and some musty yeastiness as well. Taste follows suit, some citrus notes, with a decent malt backbone to back it up. Creamy and full-bodied, this one is not over-carbonated, like many American versions of the style. Great drinkability, the theme of this one is balance and melding of flavors.

When I looked at the beer in my tasting glass, It looked yellowish, with hints of green reflection glow. Good head, and retention. The smell was intense and could be smelled at least 3 feet away. It smelled of grass, hops, skunk, and I caught a note of sweetness in the smell. Then I drank it slowly, the flavors really explode on the palate and lingers well after the consumption. This I think is a world class beer.","StevenBilodeau","Feb 05, 2010"

3.9,-6.7,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Notes: It´s a decent beer that for me lingers too close to blah qualities. For all its hype and complexities it is too close to some funky European largers or their better Pilsner sisters. In fact primarily from the people I´ve shared the brew with, those that claimed that macro Euro lagers were their beer of choice seemed to be the most pleased by this ale, Maybe in that regard it is not too bad a beer to have people switching gears towards craft brews. Maybe it´s the icon reference for saisons but there are a few ahead of it within the style.","Daniellobo","Jan 18, 2010"

This beer pours a hazy golden straw with a big fluffy white head leaving just a minimal amount of lacing. The aroma is big and fruity up front. Ripe fruits like apples and pears are in the forefront leading to light hay, damp earth with a light grassy hop. The flavor follows suit with ripe apple and pears coming through up front. Musty earth, light grass, hay and just a bit of aspirin on the finish. The mouthfeel is light and finishes just a bit sweeter then I would have liked. I really much prefer a dry finish to a Saison, nonetheless this is a wonderful example of a ture Belgian Saison.","hwwty4","Jan 09, 2010"

Golden orange body, lots of lemon peel, grassy, herbal notes in the nose which is otherwise dominated by yeast. The taste is well done; spicy with a big clove and coriander backing, peppery with banana and fresh cut golden apples. Mouthfeel is spritzy, crisp and refreshing.

Smell was lemony and pine-like. Taste was tart and refreshing. The citrus flavor gave this beer a nice tang, but the mouthfeel of this farmhouse ale really balanced things well. It was so smooth, light, crisp, and mellow. Not overpowering though, so it paired well with a variety of cheeses. A very flavorful and classic example of a Belgian saison.","morebeergood","Dec 29, 2009"
4.2,0.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"I poured from a 750 ml bottle and poured it into several wine glasses(I shared it with non-beer drinking friends at a dinner party). It is a hazy, cloudy gold with a massive , long lasting, white head. Lemon zest is prevalent on the nose, along with a hint of spiciness. The flavor was as good as advertised, lemony, spicy, with a drying finish. The beer is highly carbonated, medium/light in body and it goes great with any food.

4.18,0,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"M/D: Light to medium in texture, the feel of this beer evolves with temperature and time it has been poured. Initially, there is a strong effervescent feel, but as the beer warms and sits exposed to air, the beer turns smooth and almost silky, finishing nice and dry. There is a lot of great stuff going on with this beer. Every overlying feature that I was looking for in the flavor was there, and they all went together in a near perfect balance.

I got the same foam on the last glass that I did on the first, and the lacing lingered nicely. Aroma is a strong one; tough to pin down, but the best way to describe it would be the hay/barnyard aroma I associate with Saisons. Taste is a little strong, a little acerbic, pleasant but I've tasted others I prefer. Very dry finish; definitely a palate cleanser.

Great smoothness that is balanced with a well-carb'd crispness. Yeast and bread malt make the beer somewhat chewey and creamy and there is a little bit of sweetness derived from the fruit flavoring.

Surprisingly bitter on the finish, a lot of hops coming through following that light, wheaty flavour. This leaves me, to be honest, with a really quite sinking, heavy feeling because it feels over-hopped without enough rich barley malt to balance, and the mouthfeel is a bit clunky.

Saison Dupont is such an all-star that I hardly know where to begin. The first thing I notice is the way it makes me tongue tingle, followed by a sweet fruity and spicy blast not unlike that of a Belgian tripel just before a rush of orange zest hits the back palate and lingers on the finish. It's body is quite extraordinary -- tingly like I said but has a very substantial body that gradually breaks down and softens. An exceptional beer.","droomyster","Mar 14, 2009"

Retention is good, as it takes some time to fade. A few spots of lacing are left to and fro. Smells phenomenal, with fresh yeast, light fruits (green apples, pears) and diacetyls all moving in perfect balance around the nose. Tastes spicy and a bit sour with more light fruits, big malts, sweet bread and yeast. Goes down a bit dry and there's plenty of carbonation. Mouth-feel is medium.

Thick, rocky head 2 fingers thick and she stayed around quite a long time. Beautiful lacing all the way down the glass. Aroma of grass, grains and very fruity with a slight whif of hops. Better tasting than I imagined from the aroma. The Dupont has a slightly grainy, fruity taste to it with the slightest amount of light bitterness to it. As I drank it the fruitiness became more noticeable without killing or overcoming the hops. Mouthfeel is so very smooth, almost creamy with a decent amount of carbonation that offsets the dryness that is evident later on. Really alot going on with this beer.

Very enjoyable to sniff. Taste follows suit very well but a touch sweeter. Sweet apple, pear, and rhubarb with a grassy dry flavor. Midway some pepper and clove with a slight melon sweetness. Aftertaste is more dry with a bit of a citrus hop linger, very nice. Light body with a soft pillowy feel and an active carbonation, great representation of the style.

3.55,-15.1,4.5,4.5,3,4,3,"First thought: Upon the first sip, far more vinegary and soapy than anticipated. As I let it sit some, these flavors seem to mellow into the background a bit. Hints of spices I couldn't begin to name permeate throughout, backed by pale tart vineyard fruit, apple, pear, white grape. It's crisp, dry, light-bodied, all of those aspects full to character. But the aftertaste is where the negative aspects rise to full character. i get a very soapy and overly vinegaric finish, it's making me wonder if I got a bad bottle. I have limited experience with the genre at hand, but I don't think these qualities should be so present. If it weren't for them, it would be a very pleasant slight tartness providing a sour character, and that would make it very palatable. It really gives a hit to taste and drinkability, so I won't deduct them that low until I know what's up. will revise these scores if necessary after trying this beer again at a later date, to give it a more fair shake.","damienblack","Jan 30, 2009"

4.5,7.7,4,4,4.5,5,5,"The "Chob"(Michelob) the champagne of beers??? I think not. Pouring this beer into into a small snifter it can barely be contained. Immediately there is a large effervescent head that monopolizes at least half my glass until I find the right pour-to-head ratio so i don't get beer all over my rug. The original aroma has that same metallic smell that all beers in a green bottle have to me; but when the aggressive, tightly laced head finally calms you get the flavors that are under it. That fruity/yeasty/funky Belgium scent that you would expect. But drinking it is a different story. Honestly, i can say this beer is balanced. The hop flavor is low but the bite you might be looking for is supported by it's effervescence. It gives way to a malty finish that makes itself known to your taste buds but fades to a dry finish, and this beer is incredibly dry. And drinkability??? Well let me just tell you that I, sir, am drunk. This single bottle is so deceptively drinkable that during the course of this review it has hijacked my brain because i have drinking it like soda. WOW. Those damn Belgians just pulled out a bottle, no pun intended, of whoop-ass on me. Damn my wife is going to be pissed when she comes home. Oh well. This brings me in an ass-backwards kind of way to my next point; which too me scores the highest of honors for beer... Every dang sip tastes the same, and as FRESH as the first. I find this rare in a beer and worth mentioning. Man thank God I have spell check or anyone reading this review would be in a world of hurt right now. Anyway... DO GET THIS BEER.

Taste has more earthy funk, some cheese ash bitterness, grapefruit, more spicy pepper, overall very complex flavors. Mouthfeel starts off with a heavy carbonation that starts off rather sweet, and changes course to leave the palate on a dry and bitter note.

The fruits are dominate and more more complex and layered than my simple description of citrus can encompass.

Floral, hay, summer day in the mountains cool refreshing type of beer, yet still showing a lot of hops. Could see how this could be considered the model all other Saison's are produced from.

Taste isn't too funky, maybe I could trick my mind by picturing a barnyard but not much of a petting zoo taste.

An excellent beer (and restaurant) for the meal and for the warm summer night on which both were consumed. The waitress poured the beer straight into the bottom of a tall glass, which created a massive head that erupted with a bready, fruity aroma. The head dissolved quickly except for the final inch. The color of the beer is hazy yellow-orange, which is quite beautiful. The initial carbonation stings a bit and then disappears, leaving behind the flavors of clove, peaches, apples and whole-wheat bread. A bit of bitterness follows. Alcohol was lower than I expected, so having two was not a problem. Drinking this saison was absolute delight.","gfreed","Jun 14, 2008"

I was expecting some slight fruit esters however none have come through. Solid mouthfeel, not too thin or cloying. Drinkablity is also solid as this is not a heavy beer, or overly alcoholic.

The crispness of this beer is seriously impressive. The carbonation is soft and provides a mellowness to compliment the borderline sourness of the beer. The body is light.

The nose is absolutely dilectable for a farmhouse saison. sweet, spicy, fruity nose. The first sip is very fruity and smooth. The hop taste follows with almost a coriander, fruit taste and spicy tones, with slightly skunky mixtures ( It is in a green bottle!) the finish has reduced in bitterness with its two years of age.

Mouthfeel is much more light and spritzy than I remembered, and that may be the biggest disappointment. Flavour is peppery, spicy, mildly sour, with a little bit of lemon but none of the funk I want to see in a farmhouse ale. Still, it's fairly refreshing if that's what you're looking for. The aftertaste is a little on the tart side, but fairly clean. I'll definitely get through the case, but might not make it a regular purchase.","crwills","Oct 20, 2007"

There is a complex mellowness to this concoction that is mostly sweet with notes of wheat, almonds, biscuit, and pears. Hops were well embedded and showed only toward the finish. Mouthfeel was very full, smooth, and silky. Finish was long, hoppy, dry and semi-sweet. Overall: this is a beer that I would drink at any occasion. I think it might go particularly well with seafood.

Very subtle belgian spiciness, grassy, earthy and very fresh. There is a slight yeasty sourness which helps round out the finish.

First sip blows me away as it has greater depth than I've ever experienced in another saison. There are many layers of flavors that dramatically change with such quickness it is difficult to discern each and pick apart everything judiciously. It begins like a typical saison with a lemon zest taste and then moves to a peppery hop bitterness. The finish is dry, but the aftertaste develops a life of its own with full flavored bitterness unlike any other. Ample carbonation in this one does not detract from its flavor, but seems to warm the palate. Highly complex and drinkable brew.

4.17,-0.2,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"So the famous Dupont arrives in Alberta, coming in the single 330ml brown bottle. Simple labelling here, dark green mostly except for some white and red. Very little information on the beer itself, save the ABV and the location in Belgium. The beer from Tourpes pours into my chalice a cloudy peach/nectarine hue, with a two finger cream-coloured head, chunky, pillowy, and fine-bubbled. Yes very cloudy beer indeed, with soft little tiny chunks floating freely. The aroma reminds me of a combination of Tripel Karmeliet with Kwak, which to me is an exceptional thing. Very soft malts, a little butterscotch, massive hits of bitter yeast, some metallic notes, ripened fruit, especially prunes and peaches, figs, and definitely some touches of lime even. The malt asserts itself the more the beer warms, and by room temperature the soft caramel aromas mixed with the yeast and buttery fruits make an excellent overall impression on the nose. Sensational. I'll say it again: very similar to Tripel Karmeliet's aroma. The taste is a little bit of a chameleon, equal parts tart and bitter. In fact it is much more bitter than I anticipated. The finish is all iron-like metal and plenty of grainy hops. Extremely effervescent mouthfeel; easy to see why this would be quenching on a warm day on the farm. Absolutely classic Belgian yeast taste, giving the dryness of Saaz with the flavour of Fuggles. Very classic taste, but all in all, for me personally, I was expecting a fuller and sweeter taste. As it stands, every point is flawless. It just doesn't excite my tastebuds overmuch. Still this is a classic example of the saison style, and I am glad it is finally available here locally.

Maybe a hint of some red berries in there too? It feels a bit dry on the tongue but it's a great summer beer. Perhaps a close cousin of a witbier?","JanM","May 16, 2007"

The taste is complex, with more of the same that are in the aroma, but a lingering bitterness that doesn't seem to come from hops, maybe a slght minerality as well. More farmhouse and brie flavors here, and while there is a touch of tartness, its pretty slight and is not at all the predominant flavor. A crisp, subtle beer with complex flavors that are restrained enough for it to be a real quencher. Very nice as always.","Georgiabeer","Apr 29, 2007"

Cloudy straw yellow color with bits of yeast floating around. Tons of thick lacing. The smell is very interesting. Has a very strong skunk smell. Smells like a strong lager. Has a belgian candy smell along with yeast notes. Strong lingering bitterness on the finish. The mouthfeel also is wonderful. Perfect balance of carbonation that leaves a foamy texture in the mouth.

Just a bit of dark sediment pairs with a lot of fine bubbling, fine carbonation for sure. The aroma is light and fine, sweet and citric, grasses, orange peel, quite delightful. And it gets even better, the citrus quite flavorful, lemon orange zesty, grassy hops again, more spices, corriander in particular. The mouth is lively, carbonated, light to medium, sweet and zesty to dry, nearly perfect for this beer.

Thick creamy white head that settles fairly quickly to a foam on the surface that stays around.... Smellwise, it has a very lambic quality to it. Tastes quite nice, a bit grapefruity, slightly pungent, but still preety good. Mouthfeel is sort of fizzy. Swallow a drink of it and you feel a fizz moving to back of the throat slowly evaporating as you swallow. Altogether not too bad of a beer, i'm sure it's very typical of the style, but i'm not sure if i'd try this again or not.","BigJTrucker","Mar 06, 2007"

Lemon flavor as the beer warmed to room temp. now and slightly more alcohol flavor in the aftertaste as it warmed as well. It finishes really crisp and dry.

Nose is all citrus, mostly orange. Taste is likewise citrusy, more lemon now, with some yeasty flavor as well. Tastes like a really good hefeweizen. Feel is good medium body, with a nice solid aftertaste. Overall, not my preferred beer type, but fairly delicious nonetheless.

Since the beer came in a 750ml bottle, It is sessionable (what else are you going to do?), but this beer is a sipper. Plan on taking a couple of hours for this bottle of beer.

It makes much food taste better. It smells a little old because I've been told they use aged hops. Try it sometime...put some hops in a bowl and leave them in your beer closet (or wherever you put beer) and smell them in a year. They smell different. So rusty water and old ingredients. And they still make a fantastic beer. It tastes great with food. Try it. It is on my top 10. Pass on rawish fish. It takes the smell up into taste. However, it is the best grilled salmon beer around.","faernt","Jan 26, 2007"

Some moderate Styrian aroma, and a solid skunky/spicy Saaz bouquet. Some soft wheat and mild medicinal aromas are also evident, with lambic yeast notes and faint pilsener malt in the background. Timid pale malt sweetness and sharp pilsener upfront, followed by zesty Styrian and Saaz flavor, perhaps a little light-struck. Then comes a tame but prominent farmhouse profile. Dry aftertaste with lingering skunk and noble bitterness while the farmhouse character remains apparent, but not overwhelming. Nearly perfect execution of the style. High carbonaion and ultra-thin body, almost champagne-like but with some wheat-like texture. Overall the mouthfeel is refreshing and light with a pleasenty acidic yeast character and spicy german hop backdrop. Finishes dry and funky but restrained enough to quench the thirst as well as supply ample sour flavor.","PBRstreetgang","Jan 18, 2007"

4.12,-1.4,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Available in Vancouver in the big bottles ( better to cellar than the small versions) , this is a spicy take on the Saison. Lots of head tops a light gold body. The nose is all yeasty with citrus notes and the first sip is very assertive( You need to let the beer settle to really get the nuances of the finish). I like this version as it has body and finesse in one package and really shows well as a counterpoint to the malty, heavy dark beers.","canucklehead","Jan 07, 2007"

Mouthfeel is quite thin-bodied and wet, and there's little here that could be called bitterness, just mildly sour. Carbonation is mellow.

A few months ago, my wife and I split a bottle (or tried to...) of a Saison Dupont that was skunky to the point of undrinkability. Even at La Caves Dupont, the small pub directly across the street from the brewery, the saison began to get a skunky smell as it warmed in the sunshine while we enjoyed some on their back lawn.

Perhaps because it goes down as smoothly as it does, but still, that's a warrantable quality. The bottom line here is, sometimes tradition is all that, and this beer is one of those times.","Foxman","Sep 13, 2006"

3.99,-4.5,3,4,4,4.5,4,"This was my second saison, first foreign, and I must say that I am a fan of the style. Pours very similar to a wheat beer with a lot of head, had to be careful of the sediment at the bottom of the bottle. The smell was that of fruit and yeast, although whereas a wheat has a very distinct banana or citrus aroma, this was notably grape-like. The taste had little to no malt characteristics to it, and there was an unusual strong (but not overwhelming) level of carbonation. The taste was tart, not bitter, almost champagne-like.","nkurz129","Sep 12, 2006"

When it finally does fall a little it leaves mountains and craters of sticky foam behind. For a pale beer, this looks incredibly appealing. Smell is peppery yeast. Taste like the smell with a pepper bite up front. There is some bready malt taste but no sweetness at all. Very dry and smokey. Finishes with a spicey aftertaste and some bitterness. There is just a touch of fruityness between the intitial pepper and the finishing dryness. This one is proof that a light colored beer dosn't have to lack taste. This one is full of complexity and enjoyable to drink. Thanks to maltygoodness for throwing this one in a trade.","beermanbrian","Sep 08, 2006"

From the onset of a magical deep yellow glow with stark-white head retention, incredible rocky head retention, sprikled with peppery spices, and continuous lacing.

Palate is intriguingly complex; a medley of spiciness (black pepper, coriander, and cloves ...) hoppiness, and a slightly sweet, sugary sublety. Citrus elements are abundant as well - lemon zest and orange peel. Mothfeel is light and alive. Good carbonation and a slight "burn" that is refreshing. This saison has complexity and class in every way! Finishes dry and a little hoppy. Very drinkable. I love Saisons, and this one is the gold standard, I believe.

The color is a deep yellow/orange and has bits of yeast suspended throughout. The flavor starts sweet from the malt and then finishes dry from the hops. It is both refreshing and complex.

I did have one once with a tomato soup that didnt really do anything for me but have it with a ham and strong swiss cheese sandwich!

Definitly different. Unlike anything I would call a belgian pale ale, as many have described this brew. Good mouthfeel is enhanced by the high level of carbonation.

Blegian sugars come through as the initial flavor, but are quickly replaced with a surprising amount of hops. I can barely find any yeasty fruits, flavors or spices. While refreshingly crisp, it does not drink as smooth as I was expecting. It came across as much more like a bitter than a Belgian farm style ale.

The foam is just too much. There's great foamy beers like Piraat but this is just a step over the top. The carbonation seems to domintate all aspects of the taste. It's like champange but much more intense. I poured it into a wine glass and when the glass 1/3 full of beer the rest is complete foam which holds for minutes. So it took a good 6 or 7 pours to finish the bottle. Then you burp 100 times. For that matter the smell is not very pleasant. Now that said this is a pretty tasty, good beer. The taste itself is certainly the high lite.

Aroma was filled with a doughy malt, yeast and a funkiness. There were also notes of sweet fruit and a bit of spiciness. The taste was quite malty with a spicy backdrop. Notes of biscuity malt and sweet fruit were intermingling. The taste ends on an earthy bitter dry note. Mouthfeel was light to medium with a very well carbonated feel to it.

I have to let this sit to see if I can get the head to go down, or I will have foam all up in my moustache. The flavor is really nice. There is a tartness that carries through the entire beer, but there is also a nice citrusy sweetness in there too. Very nice. The beer is moderately thick, not too heavy for the flavor.

Beer is the color of bronzed honey with highlights of pure gold; highly translucent and full of lilting carbonation. A swirl of the glass leaves slothful lace oozing back towards the surface of the liquid. Quite a looker, until later in the bottle... when I start getting loads of sediment, no matter how gentle the pour. Crisp, hoppy aromas of new-mown grass with grated lemon zest and pickled ginger; soft, rice wafery maltiness. Nosefeel is almost too light to be considered "floral." Flavors are neatly balanced, everything drenched in coolness: lemon juice wetnesses give way to an assertive, spicy body of white pepper, coriander, ginger; nectarine-pit bitterness; vigorously dry, hoppy finish. Mouthfeel is wet--wetter than water--on the tongue, but somehow finishes warm, bitter, and refreshing. Good drinkability overall, but I was beginning to feel some palate fatigue after 750ml of the stuff. Delicacy is absolutely the focus of this brew. I preferred this when I had it on tap, but this sample simply reinforced my notion that this is the archetype for the style. This paired very nicely indeed with orange-glazed salmon and asparagus frittata.","NearerMyBeerToMe","Sep 26, 2004"

Yeast and some slight hops show up at the end with a tart-like finish that lasts into the aftertaste. Quite nice. Nothing was overwhelming which was nice to see.

Spicy and "authentic" farmbrew flavour, which unfortunately soon is overpowered by a strange medicinal bitterness on the the back of my tongue - Im not sure how much of this bitterness comes from the hops and how much comes from dead yeast cells.

Massive chunky white head on the pour into a tulip glass, the foam rose so high above the lip of the glass that it eventually formed a saison nipple as a crown. Hazy pale golden coloured body, intense carbonation. Pepper, corainder and citrus on the nose, some sweet malt and candi sugar as well. Through the billowing foam it seems to have a cotton candy sweetness to it, it suits the texture, that's for sure. Intensely sweet flavour up front, definitely cotton candy, strawberry licorice, citrusy towards the middle, and the spices popping up near the finish: pepper, coriander, bitter orange peel. Floral sweetness on the aftertaste, some clover honey. A small sample to make a decent impression from. The mouthfeel is smooth like mylar, a frictionless plastic texture that slides through the mouth. I'd drink another of these just to get part 2 of the experience, hopefully in a larger serving.

The green bottle may be to blame for the skunkyness that enveloped the sweet fruit and yeast in the aroma. Light-bodied and very carbonated, with an earthy mix of tart fruit and sweet spice flavors. However, the flavor falls off very quickly for some reason. The finish is lightly sweet and has a touch of pepper. Overall this beer is decent with only a couple shortcomings, but I think the green bottle and travel did it some harm.

I assume the gasses from the bottle were released prematurely as the bartender open the 12-ounce bottle and it took the waitress a moment too long to bring me the sample. I am angered and disappointed. No lace was produced either as the beer was removed from the glass, speaking of glass it was a straight-sided pint glass! Curse the Dundee Dell! The nose is tart, earthy, peppery, grassy and very lively. The potency is respectable, welcoming for sure. The palate is everything you want in a Saison and then some. Tart and lively upfront with earthiness, fresh cut grass, hay, horse blankets, pepper, grapes, traces of white wine, pears, a hint of green apple peel, undercurrents of indescribable loveliness. The carbonation is lively enough to play up the taste and refresh at the same time. Medium in body, smaller than I expected but it has a very workable mouthfeel. Dry finish yet fruity and juicy. This is a great beverage, absolutely wonderful, it doesnt hurt I love this style of beer. If I were stuck on a desert island this would be the beer of choice.

This beer is a hazy orange yellow colored brew, which, is topped by a prodigious white head. The head is long lasting and turns to a cratered rocky surface over time. As I pour I get a strong light struck character in the aroma. The main aroma in the glass is of grain. The light struck character is, thankfully, quite muted in the taste. The beer has a sharp grassy-grain character to it, which is quite good and make me think of a nice hay field in Belgium. There is a slight sweetness and a balancing bitter hop finish. It is a fairly dry beer overall, and has very little fruitiness to it. The middle of this beer has a certain sharp spiciness to it. Overall, though this beer is fairly mellow, the flavors are well integrated and flow one into the other. I like this beer; a quality, good farm-house beer.","Gueuzedude","Jan 21, 2004"

Nice color, not quite yellow, and not quite orange but certainly hazing with a nice topping of foam. The smell is very fresh and awakening, slightly fruity, but certainly refreshing and dominated by the yeast. The taste is a wonderful combination of the farmhouse yeast, some hops, sour fruit and tongue tickling spices. The aftertaste was very dry and long lasting.

Smell is subdued and mellow with light fruity citrus peels and quite floral in its sweetness with an overall dry wood character adding a nice earthyness with dried grassy and musty yeast notes. Taste is a nice meld of complexing little bits of sharp wheat tones that playfully dart around the palate leaving trails of spices, grasses, dulled citrus peels, musty yeast, wood and earthy tones that leaves a real interesting dryness thats milding smooth and long with its own complexities lending nice frothy wheat malts and some mild hop bittering tones. Nice finish, very calm, smooth, lengthy, and subtle with drying tones. Nice airy carbonation upfront that builds quickly to a nice little grab and fullness midway, and finishes dry remaining smooth and kinda tingly/spritzy the whole way through.

Nice golden hue with a very slight haze. The start is smooth, quite malty, and somewhat fruity with notes of peach and sour apple. Quick hit of considerable carbonation is soon to follow. Carbonation lends to a rather fluffy mouthfeel. Spice notes come out in the middle  clove being the most noticeable. The finish is tart and dry with malt undertones still noticeable.

Flavors aren't really jumping out at you, and in fact seem to me to be hard to put a finger on anything specific. Grassy, earthy flavors are present, as well as some mild citrus notes. A great drinker, but not one if you're looking for loads of flavor. One of the few "don't think...drink" Belgian ales I have come across.

I was concerned about the ale being light struck because of the green bottle, but the first smell dissipated these fears. The nose was slightly fruity with a background note of earthiness. The appearance was pure sunlight in a glass! A spun gold, effervescent body sat under a dense, rocky, white head that would not have looked out of place with a cherry placed atop of it! The head lasted the whold way to the last sip...talk about excellent head retention. The flavor was every bit as substantial as the head. An intense assault of tart hops backed by a fruitty maltiness that dissipates into a long, tart (almost lemony...if that's a word :) ) finish.

4.38,4.8,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Cellared 750 ml bottle. The cork is dated 11-98. It releases a Champagne-like "pop" when the cork is released, and a foamy head starts building in the neck of the bottle. Carefully poured it's a clear gold with just-smaller-than-standard bubbles quickly rising from points across the entire bottom of the glass. A second pour should bring up some haze and tiny dark particulate, giving it a hazy peach colored body. The carbonation supports the billowing, frothy, creamy and pillowy bright-white head; and it holds a continuous 1/2 inch or more of head. Quite an appearance! Initially it leaves solid sheets of lace, but as you progress through the glass they break up into an interesting 'patchwork'. The nose is musty, hay-like, and lightly sweet but lacks the citrus rind and spice of fresh versions. The body is thin and the mouthfeel is lightly creamy - a contrast from the biting carbonation of a fresh bottle! In this case, however, it adds to the drinkability as the spice and hop flavors are diminished as well. It offers a lightly earthy, touch acidic, mildly sweet malt with some soft fruit (peach, apricot) and a cusp of peppery spice. It's quite supple, and yet it retains a fair amount of complexity. Astonishing! It finishes long and dry with a bit of the forementioned supple maltiness, a touch of summer fruit, and some mild peppery spicy notes. It's clear that this beer is extremely well made, considering that it's held up so well after 4 years. In fact, I enjoyed the aged version just as much as a fresh one. It's notably different, but still quite nice. I wouldn't recommend laying it down for more than 2 years, but if you find one in a corner of your cellar a few years later give it a try, you might be surprised!","NeroFiddled","Jan 18, 2003"

Pleasant, funky flavors associated with this style can be found in this brew. There were also more common flavors such as tart green apples and doughy bread. Also, there was a nice, long, soft hop bitterness. Very gaseous beer, but this did not take away from the mouthfeel at all.

Nice tame malt lies in the background with some pepper and other spices over riding towards the end of the aroma. Nice light maltiness is the first flavor onto the tongue. This is quickly followed up by some light pepper and clove spiciness mixed in with other spices. There is a definite spicy, herbal hop flavor to this as well as some nice earthy qualities. It is almost like a Gueuze light. All the flavors I love in my favorite Belgian style are toned down just a bit for this one. Slightly sour and acidic qualities are balanced by the herbalness.

4.34,3.8,4,5,4,4,4.5,"Very cloudy in appearance. I have to agree on the similarities to a wheat beer. Definately a hint of lemon. A real treat and a great find.","AtrumAnimus","Dec 02, 2002"
5,19.6,5,5,5,5,5,"Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a massive, pure white, meringue-like head that explodes every time new liquid is introduced to the glass. Cobweb-like lacing. The aroma is grassy and earthy, with honey, peppery spiciness, phenolics, musty yeast, oranges and apricots, and flour-like malt. The flavor begins phenolic, with some white pepper spiciness. Midway, the other flavors foretold in the aroma appear: honey, musty and funky yeast, citrus (orange peel and lemon zest), and bready malt. All of these ride atop a rustic, earthy backbone. Hints of leather, iron, and hops towards the end. The finish is extremely dry and completely washes the palate clean. Crisp and clean in body, with a fairly light mouthfeel and huge acidic undercurrent. This fresh bottle is a bit young and rough compared to some of the older bottles of this Ive had. Still one of the best examples of the saison stylea classic brew.","MJR","Nov 30, 2002"
4.28,2.4,4.5,4,4,4.5,5,"2000 Edition. Loud pop when uncorking gave me an indication of how highly carbonated this brew is. It poured a crystal clear pale gold, with massive trails of CO2. Huge, rocky head with great retention. Leaves thick, foamy trails on the glass. Smell is lightly fruity with a grassy and spicy smell. Moderately tart taste of apples with plenty of peppery spice and low bitterniss. Light, crisp mouthfeel with a slightly dry finish. Lingering aftertaste of tart apples.","Viking","Nov 29, 2002"
4.4,5.3,4,4,4.5,4,5,"The thick, fluffy, well retained white head w/ soft peaks tops a hazy dark golden hued brew.  Musty yeast hits the nose at first, then is ensued by candied fruit sweetness, citrus rind, and tart pear at the end of the aroma.  Cidery sweetness is perceived initially, but quickly yields to a capricious melange of honey, sugar coated lemon rind & rustic bready malt, w/ hints of green apple acetaldehyde and black licorice.  Well attentuated and somewhat dry, with a spritzy, lively mouthfeel that complements the tart fruit notes.  Hop bitterness is nearly lost, yet manages to offset sugary sweetness & accentuate the dryness of this brew.  Finishes w/ a bready malt and fruit combination reminescent of tart orange marmalade on wheat bread.  Saison Dupont is complex yet balanced, relatively light on the palate, and thus superlatively drinkable.","marc77","Aug 22, 2002"
4,-4.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Golden ale with long lasting lace and continuous beads. Mild aroma with light malt hints. Round and spicy in the mouth, with soft malt character contrasted with hard water, almost metallic. Hops give the beer a good crispness and the yeast really lays it on thick. Slight euro-skunkiness from green bottle. Long lasting finish which draws out the best qualities in the flavor of this beer. This is not quite to my liking; the yeast is overbearing and the mouth is a little too frothy for me. However I cannot criticize the quality of this well-made beer; only my taste and my inexperience with the style are at fault.","Thrasher","Jul 22, 2002"
3.53,-15.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Very nice fresh and spicy like a good saison should be, spicy almost peppery nose, with a bit of cloves and coriander in there aswell, i liked it a lot, spicy and not too over the top on the palate,very nice easy drinking saison.","rastaman","Jul 11, 2002"
4.12,-1.4,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Big green bottle. A fun semi-hard pour yielded a fizzy third of a goblet head thats long-lasting. Almost a gold color, hazy and opaque. Slightly estery and fruity aroma. Pleasant sweet malt flavor, leaning toward the strawberry/banana, touch of black pepper. Lemony astringency toward the end. Finishes quite dry and a tad grassy, but the malt flavor is pretty robust initially. Pretty complex. I like this Saison style and give Dupont the thumbs up.","ADR","May 02, 2002"
4.48,7.2,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Ah, the complexity of a first-rate Belgian saison!  Cloudy golden color, huge frothy head, nice lace.  And then a very dry fruity-spicy nose and palate with a dry finish.  Carbonation is on the high side.  Everything comes together so well in this brew -- it's just incredibly drinkable.","BKotch","Apr 07, 2002"
