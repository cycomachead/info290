"The sweetness doesn't even come off as even Belgian strangely. It's got some really fascinating qualities but it misses the classic saison character and depth, and just misses the mark. There's a real interesting beer in here but it's sort of all over the place."

"This is a decent rendition of the style but perhaps it left me begging for more fruit and less spice."

"O - I actually enjoyed this more than I thought I would. Pretty standard example of a saison. Smooth drinking and good flavor."
""
"O: Honestly being from FFF this would have a unique spin if it had a touch more hops though it's tasty and fits the style well as is"
""

"Overall: I absolutely love saisons, and Rabbid Rabbit is one of my favorites in that style. If you've not had this, you are truly missing out."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A very good, but not exceptional farmhouse. Not your typical brew from 3F, but well done. The only knock is that the single bomber cost as much as a 4-pack of my favorite of this style, making this particular offering hard to justify."
""
""
""
""
"Usually grab anything I see from 3 Floyds because the artwork kicks ass, and they all tend to disappear quickly. I would love to put this bunny in the mall for Easter photos. Pours a deep golden straw color. Smells yeasty and sweet, typical Belgian aromas. Taste a little on the sweet side. Cloves, maybe corriander and pineapple, other baking spices, sweet yeast, faint banana, very citrusy with a crisp finish. A think it has a solid flavor profile compared to a lot in the style. Very drinkabke. I like it. Dinged it overall just because $12 bomber price tag (man do I hate it when I find a beer I like that is 22oz only), but would love to have again."
""
""
""
""
""
"D- Decent brew that seemed to miss the mark for me being just average."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Its pretty good, Its a little to light and thin in the flavor. The sweet yeasts add lots of sweet flavor, along with the malt backbone to provide the main flavor. Tastes much more like a triple. Solid but not world class that usually FFF makes."

"O - A bit sweet for a saison and for my taste personally. Actually let me rephrase that, I don't like the rock candy added and the more of this beer I sip - I really dont like it."
""
"This beer changed a lot from the first pour to the end. It tastes more like a Belgian pale ale than a saison."
""
""
""
""
""
"Well, it looks like FFF CAN deliver a slightly funky product after all. It's definitely one of the least hoppy offerings I've had from them, but it was without a doubt flavorful and in particular was great to drink outside on a nice day, as I did. The floral notes are fantastic on this, and it's worth buying for that reason alone. The flavor is less complex overall, but it drinks quite well. It's a good way to take a departure from their hoppier offerings yet still get something that's complex in its own way."

"I agree with the reviewer who said this is more of a Tripel than a Saison. This is not a Saison to me. No where near the class of Saison's from Hill Farmstead and the like. Even Jolly Pumpkin is quite a bit better than this. I never regret trying a new beer, especially from a place like FFF, but this is not one I will try again. Considered pouring it out even."
""
""
""
""
"a great beer, but to me more of a tripel than a saison, with all the malt sweetness, so maybe more of a line bender than anything. who cares really, taste is king. it pours a clear golden honey color, we have seen this before in the globe, with a half inch of lace. the nose is very sweet, big malts, but on the lighter color and taste spectrum. did they really add rock candy to the kettle? if they did, I can smell and taste it, if they didn't, I still think I can. light herbal notes in nose and taste too, like green tea, but not bitter or quite as earthy. more of a grass vibe. very full body, ultra sweet, sticky almost, but the Belgian yeast makes this awesome. it gives it a slightly dry finish for all the sugar, and it unites that tea element perfectly. glad I had folks around to share this with, but it is a really different beer that I enjoyed a lot. 27 bucks for a bottle at revolution brewing in Chicago, but id say it was worth that markup for a first timer. three floyds are known for there hop use, but this is up to par with some of their better known beers in my opinion."

"Overall eh not that great wouldn't recommend if your wanting a good saison, but not really bed just not up to par on whats available out there."
""
""
"O: This is a strange brew. Its fruity, dry, malty and very beady. Its interesting and funky, Not my favorite representation of the style. /79"
"Trade from BrewMane. Thanks! Pour is orange golden and very clear with nearly no head at all...interesting for the style. Aroma is strong orange, pear, apple, honey, and only a hint of yeast funk. Flavor is candy sweet apple honey flavor, thick mouthfeel for style, but with light effervescent carbonation. Lingering carbonation prickle and honey sweetness. A bit dank and syrupy. Decent beer but heavy for this style. Worth a try."
""
""
""
""
"O: Good beer. I lover peppercorn beers, so I might rate this a little high. Legitimately not for the faint of heart. If you don't like pepper, don't buy this beer. It's basically apple juice and pepper. Seriously."
""
""
""
""
"a really strange, yet nice saison."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm pretty sure I can count in one hand the saisons I've tried but this one stands out as different. Sweeter, thicker and less carbonated than I expect. Still enjoyable to me."
"Pours hazy yellowish orange with a bubbly single finger head. Funky Belgian smell, some straw, some orange. Taste is a lot like the smell, lots of Belgian yeast, some sweet orange, dry straw, slight hop presence. The texture is nice, good carbonation, not too thin. Overall I really liked this for a warm day, it's got some funk, nice Belgian yeast taste, slight sweetness, but does leave a dry bitter aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Taste was really quite nice and not indicative of the rating. Really surprised that a brewery of this quality would miss so badly on some of the key components of the style. Not that it was a bad beer (it wasn't), it is just a poor example of a saison."
""
""
"Overall - It was significantly better (and fresher) on draft at Dark Lord Day. This bottle wasn't that great. I'd drink it again if someone offered me a taste, but it's definitely not worth $10/bomber to me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A little disappointed in this beer. The taste seems slightly muddled compared to the classic aspects of the style."

"A wonderful saison fit for a hot day."
""
""
"Just for the information, the Saison DuPont has no spices, no sugar. It's 100% pils malt, continental hops and yeast. Everything comes from the yeast (even the high attenuation). It's dry and highly carbonated."
"I really don't know where to begin with the taste. I've had really flat old macro largers with this same taste. Nothing jumps out. Some pepper, some apple, and some slight banana. It has a certain wheat ale feel to it. It's is nice on the palate but that's about the best thing going for it. I love Three Floyd's, their seasonals (most of what we get in Ohio) really disappoint me most of the time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Solid beer, would drink again, but highly overpriced at $10 per bomber. Not a huge fan of Saison ales but it was a nice change up and the anticipation of 3F beer always makes for a good time. It is definitely not your typical ale and has some distinguished flavors, well worth a try."
""
""
""
""
"O: Disappointing. I like some of Three Floyds' other beers but this one just doesn't do it for me. It's not a saison, it doesn't know what it wants to be instead, and whatever it is, I don't care for it."
""
"O: Not so sure about this one. Not necessarily a bad beer, but in terms of Saisons and Farmhouses, there are a lot better beers out there at a lot better price."
""
""
"O-Balance isn't where it should be, the chamomile is too dominate."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I really did not care for this beer. It's labeled a saison but it doesn't feel like one to me. I found it to be overly spicy and lacking in fruitiness/tartness (both of which are characteristic of saisons). The low carbonation was also very strange and unappealing and probably the worst thing about this beer. It's brewed with rock candy and chamomile, which I found interesting but ultimately the flavors don't mesh well and the resulting brew is disappointing. I would never buy this again and I frankly I wouldn't even recommend it, especially at an inflated $11 a bottle."
""
""
"O: This style is not a strong one for floyds. I loved zes zes zes, but it was a floyds take on the style - super hopped up and unique."

"Appearance is gold with thin layer of white head and and visible yeast chunks. Nose is fragrant with notes of lavender and a touch of cinnamon along with a bit of sweetness. Taste is herbal up front with a bit of honey and sweetness up front with cinnamon present (wtf?) mouthfeel is light with moderate carbonation. Overall all, this is incredibly unique but not my favorite rendition on the style."

"Aroma is spicy and bready, though not super complex. Taste doesn't have much going for it: spices are surprisingly absent, malt takes over and washes away any hints of flavor. Disappointing across the board. FFF should stick to IPAs & stouts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I feel as though the flavor could use some more lemon peel and spicing emphasis to complement all of the herbal focus that is going on. That's my main constructive criticism for this one. There's also issues with low carbonation causing texture problems, but it's more important to keep the citrus-y bright flavor going in a Saison than to work on the texture IMO."
"Overall: I think this is a solid saison. There are only a few examples produced in Utah, so I need to try ones from trading. I enjoyed this beer."
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a reddish, golden-orange color with a small white head that disappears quickly. A little bit of floaties in there too. Scent is quite interesting. Initially sweet, bready, and herbal. A bit of funk and wet dog aroma...Also get sweet apples and cinnamon. A bit of orange peel as well. Taste is at first grainy and a bit musty with some sweet apple flavor. Subdued hops with Belgian yeast and bready malt flavors. Tons of herbs and spices...somewhat winter-like. Very unique flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth and creamy. No alcohol flavor detected. Drinkability is high. Overall, this was one great beer. Not very typical for the average saison, as it is unlike any one I have tasted before. I got this as an extra in a trade and wish I had access to purchasing it myself."
""
""
""
"Verdict: Kind of a blander and overly sweet beer. I haven't really had a Belgian style from FFF that knocked my socks off aside from Live a Rich Life, (but c'mon, that's really just another DIPA) and this isn't really turning the needle in the other direction, not that it was bad, but it just wasn't memorable."
""
""
""
""
"This is good stuff. A cross between a saison and a dubbel, it's an easy to drink beer. Very good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly murky honey orange with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain, yeast, spice, and some chalky aromas. Taste is the same with a very peppery spice bitterness with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some nice aromas and flavors. Good stuff."
""
""
"O: Very grateful to have tried this beer but ultimately this is just a little too strong for my preference in saisons. As always, it's great to experience a new offering from 3 Floyds."
""
""
"O: Between the yeast and thin alcohol, it reminds me of a tripel but it is still clearly a saison. Surprisingly drinkable for such a spiced beer."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavors and aromas. Very refreshing and tasty, I could drink this all night."
""
""
""
"Hazy bright orange, with a dense white head of several fingers. Great retention and lacing. Lots of wheat and yeast on the nose, bright fruit notes and a dash of spice. Lots more yeast and wheat, citrus zest, and a good spicy component. Good hopping as well. No real alcohol to be felt. Medium body, good texture with a medium carbonation. Quite pleasing for such a warm evening."
"Overall a very delicious beer. A bit sweet for the style, but I really liked it and do not think it detracted from it. Flavorful, crisp, and biting. An absolutely delicious beer that I will be seeking out again."
""
"Its really cloudy, even for a saison. Tight white head. The smell is loaded with spicy yeast esters. There an odd hint of tobacco smoke as well. The taste is very spicy, like they added black pepper. Lots of banana, and a light body. Very peppery and spicy, yes it necessitates being mentioned twice."
""
""
""
"This beer is all over the place; not as funky as a typical saison, not as yeasty as a wheat beer, not as pure hoppy as an IPA, but instead is a mixture of the three, and more, with its peppery notes. Certainly a decent beer, but not one of my favorite 3F beers - though that is no knock, since it would be like saying this isn't one of my favorite classic Corvettes. I definitely recommend it, if just to try it, though I would not list it as a go-to 3F beer for me."

"Pours a beautiful glowing cloudy orange body with a bright white head forming thick in my new Tripel Karmeliet glass. Aroma has a big punch of citrus, and herbal spice, chalky yeast notes, and a touch of alcohol coming together. As I take my first initial sips, I get a strong assertive bitterness from the herbal chamomile, citrus peel edges, and strong long lasting spicy notes from the yeast. Bright citric notes initially followed by hints of bready sweetness all followed by a strong alcohol flavor, it was the last bottle available at Chalet Premier in North Lima, OH. Worth it to try it, sense I've been looking for this beer pretty much since they first brewed it. Mouthfeel was effervescent with sturdy carbonation medium bodied yet mellow and smooth nothing overbearing, a bit of alcohol warmth I welcomed along with a lasting spice/bitterness on the palate. Overall a truly tasty American brewed saison, which was definitely worth it. Will I revisit this one soon, probably not because I prefer the hoppy 3 Floyd's offerings."
""
""
"After writing my review, Ive started eating pizza with it and it enhances the spice of the pepperoni and crushed red pepper. This is light, easy to drink, with a spicy kick. Enjoy!"
"MOREY’S BOTTOM LINE: An above average Saison. That being said, I guess that I expected a bit more from FFF. It’s more of a peppery and spicy Saison, as opposed to the tart and funky ones that I’ve been drinking as of late. Well crafted, but it’s just a little tamer than I was anticipating. It’s worth a shot…but personally, I wouldn’t seek this one out."
"o - Nice subtle Belgian yeast and citrusy lemon. Perfect for a hot night."
""
""
""
""
"Picked up this bottle at the last DLD. Pours a hazy light orange with a healthy off-white head. Carbonation was really nice, a ring of bubbles lingered in the glass till the last sip. Nice medium bodied beer. Had very prominent bready, banana yeasty characters in the aroma department. The first sip reinforced the smells lots of bread and banana. Very light hints of peppery spice on the tongue. Normally I like my Saison’s with more of that spiciness but this beer was really nice just the same. Wish I would have gotten 2 bottles instead of just the one."
""
""
"O: Good beer but not a Saison at all. A Hefe!"
"I’m glad that I finally sat down with a bottle of this, as it ending up being a rather tasty and easy sipping take on a Saison with a nice balance of malt, fruit, spice, and hops that kept this interesting to drink."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: likeable. Glad that i tried this, but could go either way returning to it at the price point. Hard for me not to sample all of the 3F offerings!"
"Big thanks goes out to Bobby91w for sending this one my way as an extra in a very recent trade! I had honestly just added this to my Wants list! Thanks again man! Served from bottle into a Three Floyds XV Anniversary imperial pint glass. Poured a hazy yellow-orange with a one finger slightly off-white head that subsided to a half finger very slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, earth, earthy hop, spices, and floral notes. The flavor was of sweet malt, earth, earthy hop, spices, floral, wheat, banana, fruit, and subtle bubble gum. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. The aroma on this one was pretty nice and inviting. It was really well balanced and was fairly good for the Saison genre. The flavor was fairly good, but it was a little more toward the earthy side of things rather than being really well balanced like the aroma. This was unfortunate, but didn’t kill the brew overall. Still really nicely done and I’m really glad I got to try this one just because the label art is SO badass…"
""
""
"easy drinking, not bad, but nothing spectacular. worth a seek though."
""
""
"o - Overall I thought this was a really good saison; another winner from FFF for me. The nose is super fruity which I loved, and the taste is as well, though not quite as much. Easy to drink, would certainly have it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"p.s.-hilarious illustration on bottle"
""
""
""
"Thought this was just a tad sweet overall. Worth trying though I suppose."

"O: I'm always happy to try something new from 3F, but this seems like a bit of a dud for them. Perhaps the style is just not their forte."
"O- Very drinkable and nice and sweet. The spiciness is a nice touch to the end. Not to blown away by it. Seems somewhat average for a Three Floyds brew. Saison’s aren’t necessarily my thing and so for me, this is not really worth the price. Bought it mostly for the artwork and for the fact that it’s made by Three Floyds, and I have never passed up trying one of their beers."
""
"O- This beer is a good as it is strange, and its very strange. One of the most unique beers I have had and definitely worth getting. Will be back next year for this odd gem."
""
""
"This is another interesting and well made offering from Three Floyds."
""
""
""
""
""
"It's a good saison and I was pleased that 3F didn't try and incorporate hops into this, keeping it true to style."
""
"Overall Impression- Wow! Close to 5 out of 5 from FFF. I'm glad that stuck ""true to style"" on this one. Will be patiently waiting the release of this in 2012."
""
""
"Compared to their other reviews, this beer from Three Floyds seems to be something of a red-headed stepchild. It's a wonderful, refreshing beer with a nice faint tart fruitiness and a soft acidity, but it costs notably more than some better Saisons (like Ommegang Hennepin). Still, if you're a fan of the style and/or a fan of the brewer (like me) you owe it to yourself (and the brewer) to give this a whirl."
""
"O- a solid saison, a lot going on, much like other 3 Floyds beers just big on the spice notes in this one"
""
"O- its hard to knock this beer, its not quite a saison from my experience, but its still pretty tasty, so style aside this was a very good beer that i wouldnt mind picking up again"
"O- A really nice saison, highly drinkable, one of the better American-made saisons I've had in a while."
"O: Pretty nice saison. Didn't exactly taste the rock candy, but it was very sugary-sweet, so that might have been its manifestation. Either way, tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
"From a bomber into a duvel tulip. Pours a hazy yellow apricot with a 2 inch white that shrinks to a finger with nice lacing. Aromas are apricot, bread, pine, yeast, and has an earthiness to it. Taste is somewhat nutty with mild tropical fruit and grapefruit. It’s slightly bready and has a bright fruitiness to it. Mouthfeel is medium and kinda frothy. I like this saison a lot."
"O- A standard Belgium that doesn't really do much for me."
"Literally if you want a rock candy infused beer this has alot of rock candy flavor. It is okay I guess, defiantly a goofy beer and not one that is supposed to break any ground."
"Body is medium and a bit chewy with a spicy coriander finish. Really unbelievable how much spice is in this one. Potentially my least favorite FFF beer ever, unfortunately."
""
"O: One of the most uncharacteristic FFF beer I’ve ever tasted; I thought Three Floyds was all about hops in every style they attempt. This, however, showed that this brewery has a great range. Awesome."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I'm not a big fan of this style but reviewing without bias I found this beer to be a great example of a Saison. 3 Floyds can take any style of beer and dominate it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad saison. Quite spicy as mentioned. Reminds me more of a witbier, tastes like a witbier mixed with a saison I think."
""
""
""
""
""

"Medium body, nice carbonation, a little creamy, pretty smooth on the tongue. Pretty solid saison which seems to ride the line between sweet and funky."
"After smelling this for a while, I expected more funk in the taste. Instead, I got a weird cocktail of spices and other flavors that worked really well. I really can't compare this beer to anything else I've ever had. It's very interesting and tasty."
"O - Actually had a little too much flavor versus what I was expecting in a Saison. It's a more powerful and interesting take, but if you're looking for something in the more traditional vein, it's a bit of a let down. Good beer, but one I would only drink occasionally."
"O - I am always glad to try a brew from FFF. I enjoyed this but wouldn't put it in rotation."
"O: I thought this had some really good interesting qualities, but the alcohol is a bit too much of a villian here for my liking. I think that some people (hard alcohol drinkers) would be really intrigued by this saison, but I found it to be frustrating over the course of a pint. I was getting a lot of interesting notes at first, but after time the alcohol just seemed to make the flavor window smaller and smaller. I found myself having to focus on what comes before the alcohol, as I would lose sensitivity. That was too bad, but when this is good it's good. This would go very well with a full belly and some hearty dark greens and earthy veggies. Beet salads would make for a nice subtly sweet contrast."
"O: Definitely a more 'interesting' saison than a necessarily good or delicious one. I'd be really curious to age this and see what happens, as there seems to be a ton going on here and losing some of the heat might do a lot. I'd reccommend giving this a shot but I can't promise much in terms of how much you will like it."
"O: Very enjoyable. Another fantastic brew from FFF's!! Looking forward to trying next year's."
"Fairly smooth mouthfeel that finishes nicely. Pretty good saison, but a little sweeter than the best I've had overall."
"O - Quite interesting - a different set of flavors and aromas than typically found in a saison, but they work well and yield a very enjoyable beer for me. Hope to have again somewhere down the road."
"O: Not the most Belgian-esque saison I’ve had. It’s a bit too heavy and thick to be highly drinkable. The spices are good, but they seem to overpower everything. That and the alcohol. It packs a punch. Worth a try though. Cheers."
"O: this is a pretty good beer. definitely goes good with the 107 degree day we are having here in Phoenix."
"D/O- Enjoyed it. Lower top tier saisons I've had. Great 4th of July weekend beer. Thanks PTMcB."
"Here's one where I feel the overall BA score is a bit low. This is a really nice saison, crisp, fruity, sweet and refreshing."
"Huh, wow, I'm still drinking this and am still surprised by its sheer excellence, especially as it warms a little. I kind of picked this bottle to prove to myself that not all 3Fs beers are incredible, as I figured they would screw up a saison like most American brewers (Hennepin and Le Merle excepted of course). However, this is simply the best American saison I've ever had and I'd be interested to hear anyone's recommendations of their top American saisons too."
"O: I'm not sure how much of a Saison this really is, but I found it to be enjoyable anyway."
"The pour was very nice, very cloudy and hazy with a huge billowing head of white coming up and over the top. Really nice carbonation could be seen streaming up toward the top of the glass and a light bit of sediment in the bottom. Light aroma, light spice, bananas and light grain, nothing really over the top here at all and very understated. The taste was a bit bigger, grainy with a light fruit hint to it, but still nothing that is terribly over the top. Good, but not great. Light dry finish with a hint of peach and pear as it rolls out. Smooth, light and even carbonation and a nice easy to drink quality to it."
"Overall: I really enjoyed this beer. I thought it had a nice balance of flavors."
"O: I thought this was a decent saison, but its flavors give off more of a tripel vibe than a saison. It was ok, but there are 4-5 saisons I'd choose over it."
"The CPJ"
"Overall a very interesting take on a saison. Not what I'm used to, but it works. Very nice effort."
"O: This is my first saison and I liked it!"
"Split this bottle with my brother, and he seemed to enjoy it. Good times. It pours a cloudy golden straw topped by a healthy finger of white foam. The nose comprises lemon zest, lightly funky wheat, light coriander, black pepper, orange zest, and grass. The taste maintains some the of the citrus leaned toward in the smell, but focuses more on an earthy and spicy character, with notes of clove, cardamom, nutmeg, light balsa, heavy wheat, and honey. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly refreshing finish. Overall, a very nice saison, one of the few I wouldn't mind regularly sipping on in the future."
"Three Floyds knows their stuff and this is a fantastic beer."
"Poured as a golden orange with a pretty good white head retention. Spicy banana aroma and some light spices. Tastes like a mix of wheat grains, banana and spice. The aftertaste and complexity non existent, it has good flavor upfront but kinda drops off the map after the swallow. This brew is on the lighter side also and would be ideal for summer drinking."
"I am a huge fan of Three Floyds, but this one will take a back burner for me. I hope to find it on tap sometime and compare to the bottle variety. After the smell, the best part of this one was the label."
"This is not the best saison that I've had, nor is it the worst. I think FFF can do better..."
"O: This beer hides in 9% ABV quite well, and is true to style. Yet another good beer from 3F. But seriously, how about a date code, guys?"
"Thanks to funkyaudio for this great brew! Poured from 650ml bottle into a tulip glass. Pours a hazy dark golden/orange with a thin short-lived, off-white head. Tangy and herbal aromas of woodruff, mint, and birch. A symphony of saison and fruit elements. The body has a sturdy crystal malt underpinning that contributes a continual light voltage current of caramel. Flavors of malt, birch, woodruff, allspice, light orange, cinnamon cross the palate one after the other. Cinnamon-allspice also unveils itself in the bouquet. Light tingle of alcohol and cinnamon allspice finish. At a point I picked up some butter pumpkin/butternut squash. This brew reinvents itself with each whiff of aroma and sip after sip. Medium bodied and decent carbonation throughout."
"Poured a nice fizzy pale yellow with some very nice head and excellent lacing throughout. Nice deep and sweet malty aroma with a nice peppery spice in the nose. Excellent flavor, with great sweet light malts, a wonderful spicy zing (peppery!), and a bit of nice floralness to it. Went down fairly smooth. Excellent Farmhouse ale."
"I went into this expecting 3F's to do something wacky, but overall I think they played it pretty straight, if a bit American-ized (i.e. Ommegang). Just the barest touch bready up front, with some sharp fruity notes. Settled down for a nicely full mouthfeel. Well balanced and most drinkable. The 9% abv is evident only in a touch of pepper at the finish."
"(22oz bomber courtesy of jcnd9803) pours cloudy yellow with white head. Aroma of spices, banana, wheat-similar to a weisse. Taste is sweet malt with a little bitterness. Medium bodied with thick texture. Smooth finish. a refreshing beer that hides its alcohol well."
"O - Not a typical saison, but still pretty good."
"D: As far as saisons go, this one is pretty basic. I've never been particularly impressed with any of the Belgian offerings from Three Floyds. The one is somewhat of a novelty for me because I like the bottle. If you like saisons, give it a try. Overall the 9% is well hidden but it kicks up the peppery phenols a bit too much. As far as seasonals go this isn't necessarily a run out and get it while it lasts, but I'm glad to have at least one a year."
"very disappointing brew from three floyds. it just wasn't very interesting of good."
"This is a really good Saison and it's refreshingly not loaded with C-hops as expected from Three Floyds. I'd say it's a pretty traditional Saison but perhaps without the same body as one from France or Belgium."
"Overall (3): I wasn't crazy about this one although it was a bit different that many saisons I've tried previously. The people I was with liked it more than I did though."
"Please send me a beer mail if you find RR on tap around Chicago."
"This was the first Craft Beer that woke up my taste buds, many years ago. Straw Haze in color. A slight yeast smell. Taste of dry fruits. At 9% I found out why they called it Rabid Rabbit, cute and fuzzy but packs a bite. It is a spring time favorite."
"Bottle poured into de dolle tulip. Hazy apricot orangish yellow with a small white head that fades fast. Smell is all yeast, cloves, earthy, some orange rind. Taste is similar, peppery and sharp, yeast, some peach flavors most likely from amarillo, slightly malty. Mouthfeel is light with a heavy carbonation. Watery feeling in the finish and pretty dry. An ok beer with some interesting flavors, but far from my favorite saison or favorite three floyds beer."
"drinkable - sure, a couple."
"O- easy to finish and another win for three floyds. not your average saison. check this one out if youre either a fan of the style or a fan of the brewery. too strong to have another one of, but a bottle split between two people seemed perfect."
"Overall/Drinkability: I didn't finish the bomber, I was not impressed with this beer as compared to others of this style. 3F is a great brewery, but you can't be good at everything."
"Overall, pretty good. When I think of saisons, I think of really nice, refreshing beers, and this is certainly one despite being 9% ABV. This is my first Three Floyd's beer, and will definitely not be my last!"
"D- Overall a pretty solid beer all around I really enjoyed this one."
"drinkability is great - one of the easiest drinking 9% abv beers out there and one that is light enough to quench my thirst on a hot summer day of a cool spring/falll night"
"D - Very high in terms of flavor but the hidden 9% ABV might be a bit much. Very god take on the style. Not classic but a good interpretation."
"D - This beer is one of the most flawed beers I've seen from FFF, I am surprised by it."
"The RR pours a murky tinged gold with medium consistency and a quickly dissipating thin white head. It's definitely got some funk to it. It smells yeasty, sweet, and has this spicy funkyness to it. The flavor echoes the aromas. The spicy funkiness hits you after the sweet yeast flavors and is in between pine and citrus. It drinks pretty smoothly and has moderate carbonation. I really like this one. It's unique yet what I'd expect from the style. I recommend it."
"Drinks easy enough, the ABV is well hidden. This one is a bit different, nice change of pace, not really a ""go to"" Saison IMO. I come to expect a lot from FFF, this really didn't deliver"
"a decent beer, but the combo of it being relatively high alcohol and the fact its not a favorite of mine. i wouldnt really rank it that high."
"D: One of the weirdest beers I've ever tasted and the sweetness might start to grate on me after a while, but this brew is fantastic. I had had this one last year and forgotten how good it was. When the season rolls around again, I'll definitely trade for a couple more of these or get my family in the Midwest to pick me up some more."
"Thanks to Dan for bringing this one by the other night. Pours a cloudy yellow/amber with a minimal amount of white foam. Aromas of brown spices, black pepper and Belgian yeast. Flavors of candi sugar, brown spices and yeast. A pretty decent effort, and enjoyable, but not among the upper tier of U.S. saisons."
"I have no idea what inspired the name of this beer, but I hope to find out someday. Maybe it means nothing. Mabye it's like the ""33"" on a bottle of Roling Rock. Who knows? If the name is a bit different, but the beer is bit....well, not as good as it used to be. This Rabid Rabbit tastes a bit like a strong Euro-lager with a somewhat unpleasant phenolic character. Not as a complex as I remember, nor as tart and spicy. It is golden to amber in color. There is alcohol and some decent bitterness I suppose, but overall I'm very disapointed with this beer."
"D. Fairly drinkable. This is a unique beer. I know that pepper and saison are a good combo. This might be just a little too peppery."
"very easy drinking with great smooth mouthfeel"
"Overall- Very drinkable. Solid brew, may have held on to this bottle a bit too long. When fresh this beer is hard to beat."
"Mouthfeel is good for the style. It has medium body and appropriate medium carbonation. The beer is drinkable and enjoyable. The chamomile provides the depth most American saisons are missing from their Belgian farmhouse counterparts. This is a unique and enjoyable beer, recommended for all, and something I would buy again."
"The Mouthfeel is on the lighter side with carbonation being on the moderate side. Drinkability is average at best for me, the pepper flavor was just too much for me. It seemed to have some good flavors but they were just overshadowed by the spice. Not one of my favorite FFF beers overall."
"D: Nice summer beer to drink on the patio on a hot day. Definitely get another bomber, but I'll be a little more careful in the pour, as there's lots of sediment in this beer."
"(D)- A tasty brew. When you consider the style though, it fits, but in a twisted or bizarre way. I definitely was hoping for some funk, but this is a much more fruit and spice driven one. Not bad, just not what I was expecting. 3 Floyds has better offerings."
"D- Reasonably drinkable... the high ABV is actually well hidden... I never would have guessed 9% ABV by taste alone!"
"D: pretty decent saison from FFF. I think they had their own take on the style and made it a little bit more intresting; Probably not one of my favorite from 3 floyds."
"The beer is very easy drinking for being 9%... But not all that refreshing as I have come to expect from the style. This is certainly not the huge, boundary-pushing beer that I'd expect from Three Floyds. It isn't bad-- but it doesn't blow my mind either."
"Overall, not bad but not my favorite Saison. Very in your face, with not much in the way of balance."
"D: Goes down ok, milk kick, nice twist of the style. This is a decent beer to have, though the corriander was a bit too overwhelming for me."
"Chad"
"Have to admit, based on the first few sips I really thought this was going to be a slog. It's not a quick drinker, but over the course of a bomber to myself, it proved to be very enjoyable. Now, I'm not going to put it up there with Fantome and Saison Dupont, but it is a cool stab at the style from an American brewery not known for it."
"pours a slightly hazy golden yellow color with a small/no head and white ring..the smell is spice and fruit,slight clove and coriander.the taste is crisp with a spice and clove hit first then some fruit and corriander maybe some pepper and lemon or citrus peel..the mout feel is medium and this brew did not impress me for the style it was just average..FFF is one of my favorite go to brewery's ..this style is not there forte .this will be a try one and done 4 me"
"D- Unfortunately I drank this on the same night I had Saison Dupont so that is the comparison. Not nearly as drinkable or smooth and the flavors are good, but don't balance quite as nicely."
"Not a bad beer at all, just not my style...I like more of the funky earthy saisons than this type of spicy (too much IMO) saison..."
"Medium bodied, slick feel, decent carbonation, and the alcohol is well hidden for 9.0 % abv. I would not hesitate to buy this again."
"There's none of the Alpha King wort present in RR, as this is a pure and independent interpretation of a Belgium, and its done very well. The appearance was a cloudy, deep yellow. A wonderful bouquet, and the mouth feel had a bit more alcohol content than I remember. Given the alcohol content it was a bit drier than my recollection, but it only forces you to slow down and savor this delicious beer."
"Drinkability is very good. There is little to no alcohol presence in the nose or taste. Unique tasting saision, almost like a blend between a saison and wheat ale."
"Medium bodied, tightly effervesent, slightly warming in the throat and back of palate. Some resiny aspect to the aftertaste is the only knock I can find. A very good brew indeed. Glad I stopped in."
"Overall I think this is just too sweet for a Saison and far too one dimensional for my liking. The spice one dimensionality and real lack of complexity make this kind of a dud in my book. Definitely a different take on the Saison style, but not to it's benefit."
"Drinkability is good--a nice refreshing beer for one of the first warm days in Chicago this year."
"Ovearll, ok. An easy to drink saison."
"D - A nice Saison, Three Floyds style, which differs from the norm. I really like this one, and when it's on-tap at the BrewPub, I'll usually order at least one, if not more."
"on tap at FFF brewpub in tulip. Straw color and large white head. Great cake like smell with some fruit in there as well. Not as carbonated as bottle conditioned belgian ales (esp. Hennepin) but that didn't detract. Nice yeasty funk and overall a great tasting saison, never noticed the 9%. Had to buy a bottle of this and will certainly get again."
"On tap served in a tulip glass. Two finger white head with minimal lacing. Great yeast smell, mild fruity mango. The taste is nice and spicy, a little black pepper, ginger, nice and sweet. Overall a good, big, Belgian wheaty saison. You hardly notice that 9% abv. This is really great on a hot afternoon!"
"Drinkability: Easy despite the 9% abv"
"Big Thanks to Phaleslu for sending me this one, which has been on the wants list for quite some time. It pours a very hazy orange pour, with not a whole lot of white heading. It smells like a very spice heavy version of this style. I get some ginger, orange peel, brown sugar, pie crust, nutmeg. It starts off kind of musty in the taste, but then all of those spices come rushing in. Alcohol is nicely hidden too. Body is pretty thick for a Saison. At first I did not really care for this beer, but it grew on me as time went on. This beer screams American interpretation of a traditionally Belgian style. One of the more interesting Saisons I have run in to in a while. Cheers"
"D: Not as drinkable as it should be as a saison...too heavy. But a good offering nonetheless. FFF's always makes solid beer!"
"Thanks to Thirstybird for sharing. 22oz. bottle served in my Allagash goblet. Poured a tawny orange-gold with a murky consistency. A half inch, creamy white head dissipates into a skim, revealing delicate bands of lacing. Nose is very spicy and herbal - nutmeg, cinnamon and chamomile. Flavor profile is a spicy muddle of chai, clove, nutmeg, pepper and a little mint. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a lively effervescence. Interesting, but definitely want to split this with one or two other people. Not very saison-like in my opinion. Kind of reminded me of Sah'Tea."
"Overall a weird yet pleasing beer. Not bad at all just out there as far as saisons go. I would love to give this another try in the future."
"Overall I'd say it was pretty drinkable but not an excellent Farmhouse, and not what I have come to expect from TF."
"Drinkability is nice - there's really nothing holding it back at all, Tasty, fairly straightforward for the style. Definitely an easy to drink beer."
"I gave this high marks in the taste category based on its uniqueness alone, but in reality, this is probably one of the best saison's I've had anyway."
"My advice...seek this beer out and enjoy a few of them before the weather turns too cool. I like this one a lot and will definately seek it out again. Very good, very cool, very tasty!"
"smells of very faint ale. Very nice, creamy head. Presentation is cloudy (as this is the other half of the bomber). Lacing is evident and taste seems to decline a bit, being much more smooth, less carbonation and a bit more detection of carbonation. I would prefer this in a tulip glass over the pint glass but I would like to try this in an oversized wine glass as well. Overall, I'd probably give this a B- (72/100)."
"First off, I love the label. Once again great artwork from 3F's. Golden yellow body with a nice initial head that dissipated to nothing. This beer has some unique smells and flavors. Aromas of chamomile, cinnamon, roses? and cotton candy?? Tastes of lavender, nutmeg, more chamomile, cranberry, and white pepper. Lingering flavors but some light dryness. A pleasure to drink, unique flavors and light body make this easy to drink. ""Not Normal"" is definitely right."
"Pours a golden/amber with a little over a finger of head in my 25 oz. snifter. Smell is orange peel, rubber cement, straw, dandelion. Taste is a huge splash of ginger...seriously like chewing on a gingerbread cookie. Some light tropical fruit notes, nuts, a faint hint of band aid. Medium bodied and pretty normal for the style. Honestly I am having a tough time deciding whether I like this or not. The ginger spice is very unique and interesting, but it kind of overshadows everything else going on underneath. I guess in the end I would have to recommend this simply because it isn't like anything I've had before."
"D: Glad I got to try - and split - this beer"
"This was my first Saison beer and I thought I would be pretty safe with the Three Floyd's entry. And maybe I was. Rabbit poured a cloudy, honey color with a respectable head that didn't last. Here, I will lump the aroma and taste together: There is a brand of vegetarian hot dogs out there that smell and taste just like Rabbid Rabbit. Needless to say, while that's not bad for a veggie dog, it's not what I expect and desire in a beer. Pumpkin was also present (maybe pumpkin is the veggie in the dog too). Feel was average and drinkability just above. It was only OK."
"Notes: This has been my least favorite offering from Three Floyds thus far. I am a fan of saisons, but this one was a bit too off the mark for me to really go nuts for it."
"Interesting brew, refreshing for a hot day. This is one of the better saisons that I've had. Still, not a huge appreciator of the style, but it wasn't bad. I'd drink this again."
"Two thumbs up"
"Thanks again d0b. If nothing else this one made me work to review it."
"D- Meh, not really. The cinnamon taste is weird for a beer like this. Not digging it."
"Spices and fruit go down very smooth."
"D- This is eerily drinkable for the 9% ABV. The alcohol is not noticeable in the slightest. A very unique beer and worth a try for any beer enthusiast."
"Overall, a different kind of saison, and very tasty. Drink it fresh."
"D= I liked this beer a lot, and could easily drink a few in one sitting."
"Really a interesting beer all around, from the color, to the smell and taste. Stronger abv farmhouse ale beer. Orange hazy color with small white head. Very sweet complex floral flavor with definite banana taste. Enjoyable to drink in the spring outside!"
"Overall not a very good saison. Probably won't trade for it again."
"Drinkability: Well, that was certainly a bit different and surprisingly drinkable. Worth a try."
"Don't Drink & Drive!"
"Orange colored body with a thin head of white suds that fades very quickly and leaves fine lace on the glass. Smells of perfume/potpourri & mascerated peaches and allspice. Tastes of roasted pumpkin,cloves and funky allspice with a nice hit of cinnamon, almost more like a pumpkin/apple spice beer than a saison. This beer reminds me of patchouli a little too much. Nice, spicy hop bitterness in the finish. Slick and smooth mouthfeel with fine carbonation. Not my favorite FFF offering."
"A pretty easy-drinking saison from FFF. Maybe I should have picked up a couple more."
"This is the first saison I have had and if they are all like this I won't have many more."
"D - This was a pretty good saison. Not your typical saison, but still pretty good."
"Very citrusy and fruity and very delicious. I am beginning to like this style alot."
"Very small white head. Slightly cloudy, well carbonated, apricot in color. Smells sugary, flowery, like brown sugar. Aromas of french toast, cinnamon. Tastes like french toast with apricot syrup, cardamom. Medium body. Finish is custardy, cinnamony. Apricots and alcohol in the finish, but not ovepowering. Would definitely buy again."
"Drinkability is good. Nicely done 3 Floyds, this is a interesting and complex take on the Saison style. It might not be all that true to style, but I like it, and I'd happily drink this one again."
"Drinkability: Easily the worst of the 3Fs beers I've tried thus far in my countdown. It's both stylistically inaccurate and just overall a little strange. Don't get me wrong, it has its redeeming qualities, and the alcohol was masterfully hidden for its size. I'd recommend toning back a little on the herbal/floral/phenolic notes, however, and amping up the yeast action - get some fruity flavors and some carbonation in this one and it could be a pretty solid beer."
"Pours a clear golden yellow into my Duvel tulip. Almost exactly the appearance of commercial apple juice. Even with an aggressive pour a two finger head is just reachable with multi-size bubbles quickly dissapearing leaving decent chunks of lace behind. Smell is sweet malt and biscuit yeast to start with crisp green apple, concord grape, and a fair spicy nose. Taste is very fruity with apple and grape followed by cinnamon and other spices. Faint barnyard is nearly lost under all the sweet fruit and spices only showing themselves after the beer had warmed up to nearly room temperature. Finish is very dry and doesn't linger. No real heat, surprising for nine percent. Medium thick mouth is a pleasant surprise and the carbonation massages the tongue well. A nice beer, but not quite the saison I was hoping for. I am having my suspicions about the age of this bottle"
"One of the more disappointing Three Floyds beers. I doubt I will purchase this one again."
"Take your time with it. Rabbid Rabbit's complexities aren't apparent on the first several sips. Neither is the 9% alcohol. I would've guessed 6% at most. Tons of depth to be discovered, obviously. I also like how it's not insanely hoppy, as one might expect from this brewery (not that there's anything wrong with that). With Robert the Bruce, Gorch Fock and now this bad-ass Rabbit, Three Floyds are proving they're not just a one-trick hops-pony."
"This beer pours a cloudy amber with a 2 fingered head and lacing. The smell is nice and sweet with a very pleasant malt base to it. This is proabbly the best commercial saison I have tried, very nice balance between the sweetness, the malt and the spices, really a lovely tasting beer. The mouthfeel was nice, the carbonation level seem appropriate and this is a very drinkable brew and I wish I had some more!"
"I fear I may have aged this one a little too long - but good nonetheless."
"This is a fantastic beer. I'd put it right up there with Dupont as one of the top saisons I've had. It's completely different than Saison Dupont, but wonderful in it's uniqueness. Definitely worth a try. If it weren't 9% I could drink it all day. Ahh Three Floyds, you crazy bastards, this one is a home run."
"D - I'm not a fan. It's too weird."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish/ yellow color with a light tan head. In the aroma, quite yeasty and fruity. In the taste, yeasty, fruity, and nice ginger presence. A smooth and medium mouthfeel, with a semi dry yeasty, and a small ginger spice in the aftertaste. Very nice yeastiness, and nice with a hint of ginger."
"D-I will be more than happy to finish this one off, but not one of 3F's best."
"Drinkability/conclusion- not sure why I waited so long to try this one, and I'm equally not sure why this only is rated a B+ currently on BA. This is one of the better saisons I've had in a while I must say. Not style defining by any stretch of the imagination, but very very solid, and more enjoyable to me than many that fit perfectly into the mold. And after all... ""It's not normal!"""
"Flavor is more balanced than aroma with cinnamon, nutmeg and camomile mingling with a slightly spicy yeastiness. Sweet as well, but not clying. Good carbonation keeps this from being overbearing, but I don't think I could finish a whole bomber solo."
"HV"
"A good saison, as interesting as the style seemingly demands, marked by contrast and differences in both mouthfeel and taste. Creamy but crisp, smooth but spicy. Tastes of orange zest and coriander and some freshly milled grain and grasses. A slight hint of band aids, as well. Finishing with some alcohol warmth."
"Poured a dark orange color with a billowing, resilient head. Smells of chamomile, nutmeg, spices. Spicey zest, orange, chamomile, hops define most of the taste for me and there is really some very obvious mint. It is a smooth drink with a creamy mouthfeel. The high ABV is not obvious. Overall a pleasant and interesting take on the saison style."
"D: Pretty high ABV for a Saison, a little overpowering on the spices and alcoholic burn in your throat is definitely noticeable."
"Tasty, yes..Subtle, no..But what else would you expect from Three Floyds?"
"D- overall a pretty solid beer all around, pretty close to style which is unusual for FFF as well."
"It is impressivelt thin for such a high ABV beer, and the taste is even stranger than the aroma; it seems overspiced, and the coriander, orange, pepperiness and something else, somewhat sweet that I cannot identify all keep mixing, but not very well. It is definitely unique, but not in a good way, in my opinion. Expensive like most FFF, but unlike others, not really worth it. But if you are looking for something really different, this might suit you."
"Tasted on 5/7/08."
"Drinkability - This is a great beer from 3 floyds. i haven't had a beer from them that I did not like. This was right up there with the rest of their line. Quite tasty and a great saison.."
"Drinkability - I love three floyds and this is no exception. Like their bottles say ""It's not normal", sums it up. This was a little different saison than i'm used too, but they pull it off nicely. Alcohol is almost non-present for a higher level brew."
"all in all, id buy this in a growler any day. thanks 3floyds."
"Rabbid Rabbit is an enjoyable beer, however I feel myself wanting and expecting more flavor from this brewery at this abv."
"D: It's a decent brew. Definitely different. Drinks easy enough. I like the uniqueness but maybe a bit over done. It's definitely not a drain pour, but 22oz. has ended up being a bit of a struggle caused by the 'uniqueness' haha. And $9 a bomber is typical FFF."
"Poured from bottle into a goblet. Cloudy yellow color with a thin white head. Decent aroma of bready yeasts then some fruits and spices. Bitter first sip. Get all sorts of bitterness on the sides of my toungue then some candy or licorice floavor on the back of my tongue on finish. Beer mellows as it warms. Good finishing flavor. Not my favorite version of a saison, but pretty good none the less."
"Drinkability- This was a pretty darn good brew that I really enjoyed. It was surprisingly easy drinking at 9% and had no idea it was that high. I'm not 100% sure about the style since it was more of a Wit and Hef mix but none-the-less it was good. Another quality offering from Three Floyds!"
"D: The 9% fooled me, it's completely hidden. I could have had a couple more, no problem."
"I can say that I am not typically a Saison fan and in fact, had some hesitancy when opening this beer, but after my first sip I can say I am glad I did. Once again Three Floyds does not disappoint. The color was caramel in hue with minimal head and had an aroma of butter popcorn. While I was a little put of by the aroma, my reaction after my first sip was ""Wow, this is a great beer."" The chamomile flavor really comes through followed by a very pleasant spiciness that let me craving for more. As I drank this beer, the pairing of the aroma with the taste was extremely well balanced. Based on this beer, I might become a convert Saison fan."
"Get out and try this one. Need some in Jersey if you dont like it."
"D- I'm not a huge fan of this style of brew but this was very nice and worth a try for any one. Glad I got to try this one!!"
"It's a highly drinkable beer. Would be perfect for a warm spring day that hasn't ridden itself of the winter cold yet (a little nippy in the air.)"
"This is one of my first experiences with this type of beer. I read the description of what this style should taste like before opening the bottle and I think that FFF did a great job on this one."
"Thanks to DavidEddie for the opportunity to consider this one!"
"Drinkability: VERY easy to drink. I would love to do a side by side with this beer and Hennepin. Maybe next week?"
"This does not seem high in the ABV area but this is a one and done beer. So many flavors ruin the palate for anything else. That being said, it is still fun to drink. Not as good as some of the other FFFs, not as hyped either. I'd recommend it if you are looking something different from a good brewery."
"Pours a deep orange with a white head. Sticky lacing hangs around. Has a sweet smell of a graham cracker pie crust, nutmeg and citrus. Tastes of cinnamon, other spices, banana, and citrus (mainly lemon) hops. Finishes slightly dry and crisp. The 9% ABV is hidden extremely well. Mouthfeel is smooth and moderately carbonated. Drinkability is great. Has a nice refreshing quality to it, like a spiced up Gumballhead. I love how this smells and tastes, truly unique. If it wasn't for the high ABV and the price tag, I could easily enjoy this one all night long. Highly recommended!"
"From Notes: Crimson sunset with a nice slightly off white head of foam. foam sticks around nicely and is easily revived with the easiest of swirl techniques. Aromas of spice, and a slight Belgian saison summery funk. A nice interplay of spicy malts and home grown malts with an atypical green hop resiny three floyds amarillo twist. Taste is spicy up front with a nice yeast and malt character, but the hops are there too. to me, this is Three Floyds major brewing fault and success. They really do have a trademark flavor. None of their beers taste to different from one another, but than again, they are all pretty damn nice and drinkable. This one features a smooth prickly carbonation and a great mouthfeel that lends to a nice drinkability. Nice."
"Nice hazy orange, with a smell that at first is all butter. It then starts to smell like home-cooked cinnamon buns, then cinnamon toast, then the smell that you get when you walk by the Cinnabon in the mall. You get the picture. The taste is perfumy, some spice, ok. Interesting beer but rock candy and chamomile did strange things."
"Drinkability: This is a unique ale.... it's my FIRST Saison... so I have nothing to compare it to. Maybe it's not my favorite.... but I think it accomplishes everything it wants to according to the label."
"D: A tasty, though very unique offering from 3 Floyds. A little too pricey where I'm from, but I'd definitely pick up another bomber if I was in the Midwest."
"A big beer with hug drinkability. Extremely unique. I wish I could get FFF in Tallahassee."
"D- This is certainly out of character for a saison. I was looking forward to trying this brew from FFF and was pretty disappointed. It was difficult to drink my 750ml bottle of it. I will definitely not purchase this one again."
"Not really what I expected, although it was enjoyable."
"Drinkability - an interesting pick for a beer tasting. A bit of an outlier for Saisons; this would feel more at home among pumpkin or fall seasonal beers."
"22 ounce bottle. Served in an oversized wine glass, the beer pours a clear golden orange color with a very small white head which went away very quickly. No lacing at all. The aroma is very sweet, it smells like cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, candy sugar and orange. Taste is sweet and spicy, it tastes pretty much the same way it smells except for the addition of some apricot and apples. Mouthfeel/body is medium and creamy, with a good bit of carbonation. Drinkability is good, it goes down very smooth and easy. The 9% ABV isn't very noticable. It's not exactly a traditional saison, but I'm not complaining! Overall I think it's a good and solid beer."
"Thanks, aslamm75, for the chance to re-visit in 2013 - better carbonation though it still didn't capture the Belgian style; I do like the flavor profile, however"
"this was a cloudy apricot in color with some particulates. very complex aroma, dessert-like. flowery honey, pecan pie (this is what came to mind), along with what some of us thought was cinnamon, cloves, nuts, and citrus. i know i'm saying cinnamon, but this is the only conclusion we could all agree on even though none of us have ever smelled cinnamon in a beer. upon checking the label afterwards i discovered that it was chamonile and rock candy. moderately sweet taste balanced out by a bit of tartness and bitterness. medium to full in body. drinkability suffers a bit due to the high abv. this would be great with any dessert, or with pancakes at breakfast."
"D: What an interesting brew. Not sure if this is strictly a Saison, but it's still great to drink. I suggest taking some time with it, and enjoying it with a friend or two, so you can compare all the things you get in here. Will definitely return to this one!"
"Pours a crystal clear light amber with minimal head and minimal lacing. Aroma is mulling spices and sweet malts. Taste is somewhere between a hot cider and a strong ale, with lots of cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and sugary sweetness. Enjoyable beer, but sweetness makes it slightly sticky in the mouth. Overall, one full pint was enough for my session, but I could see drinking it again. Would rather have it on a nice autumn day than in the spring, but that's just my preference."
"Medium orange with some head. Pleasant citrus and cinammon and corriander aroma, and taste. If there were gradients in the important taste rating, it would be higher than a 3.5 average rating. Not very complex, still pleasant, refreshing and quite drinkable. Thanks Crushinator,A good saison in many ways, however I have had bolder and more varied taste and aromas saisons, what a great style."
"A far cry from a saison in terms of roots but this is a solid beer that certainly has the FFF touch to it. If I could review it as an American saison or something to that effect it would have done better but it's not really fair to pit this against Saison Dupont and call it a true stab at the style."
"This beer goes against the expectations of the style, and I don't think that is a bad thing--the label screams twice ""It's not normal."" And it isn't. It's a different, satisfying take on Saison."
"Bottle shared by Fisherman34- big kudos to Kris for sharing this rare bottle of FFF!! I had high expectations for this brew, but it didnt quite live up to them. Aroma- was earthy spices and cinnamon. Poured out a foggy orange, with no head or lacing to speak of. First time Ive seen that with a saison style beer. Taste was like a big old bowl of cinammon toast crunch- very bready, toasty and extra helpings of cinammon and sugar. Mouthfeel was pretty thick and carbonation was medium to low- not in style. The finish of the beer was more dry than sweet , and I picked up some booziness on the finish. Not my thing, but an interesting take on the style. Thanks again for the share Fisherman34!"
"D: One bomber is enough. The sugars are intensely sweet and filling. If you are looking for saison, this is not it. Go to this one for a full body Belgian ale that'll knock you out."
"Slow pour from bomber into a pint glass. Hazy, light orange color with minimal subsiding head. Lots of carbonation bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. Smells like cinnamon raisin bread. Some nutmeg and slight citrus hop aromas. Tastes very much like it smells. Starts with candied sweetness, some raisin and fig flavors. Finishes with a little spicy hop bitterness. This has many similarities to a winter warmer, but without the dark roasted malts. It's kind of like a summer warmer. Packed full of flavor, but maintains a light, dry feel. An interesting sweet, spicy brew that's easy to drink, but the alcohol will sneak up on you. RR would certainly be enjoyable for fans of this flavor profile."
"Much different flavor then aroma. Almost like a hybrid Christmas ale with subtle pumpkin notes and spices including nutmeg and slight coriander. Sweet malt notes with touches of sweet fresh right out of the oven bread notes. Flavors are really built around the spiciness and floral aspects. Nutmeg plays the biggest role. Smooth though spicy mouthfeel that leads to a softness in the finish. High abv goes unnoticed on the palate with the spices lending to the smoothness. Drinkable, but not one I'd go out of my way to get more then once. You have to be in the mood for the rabbid rabbit."
"Overall its a great brew. I think it falls more in the line of a fall beer as opposed to summer. I could see myself drinking this along side pumpkin beers in October/November. Its not your typical Saison, but is wonderful nonetheless. The sweet spiceyness of the beer would make it a wonderful way to finish off any meal. It's my new dessert in a bottle."
"Overall, the flavor here is amazing. It definitely reminds me of a spice cake with citrus rinds. Lots of candi sugar (I think). Reminds me of honey in a way too. Very nice complex malty American take on a saison. Very different from the traditional Belgian style though."
"A unique saison. Comfortable enough beer, too sweet for me (and for the style, really). One will suffice. I'm not likely to have this beer again, hence the low drinkability score. I'm a bit disappointed, but 3F is better at hoppy than subtle anyway."
"Saisons seem to be very hit-or-miss for me."
"The taste really follows through and is consistent with the expectations raised by the nose. A balanced sweetness, herbal tang, totally delicious and very successful effort at the elusive saison style. Thoroughly impressive!"
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into an oversized wine glass. Pours a lightly hazy golden color with a small foamy quickly diminishing head. Aromas of very sweet malts. Taste is hard to pinpoint. Taste is a bit sweet, but not fruity. Nice spicy bite on your tounge with a very smooth, quick finish. Good amount of carbonation. I am not that familiar with this style, so it is hard to be critical. Not bad, but not something I would go out of my way to find again."
"Pours a clouded orange colour. An outside trim of white airy bubbles. The aroma is delicious with a crisp and distinct gingerbread cookie like smell. Notes of other spices - the chamomile, cinnamon, and clove. All the spice is eminent and abundant. There's also some malt back there in the distance. The flavour is also incredibly distinct. Balanced. I cannot believe this was 9%. No indication of that! The most mellowed of hops but an abundance of malt that keeps everything in check. This is an incredible harmony of malt and hops and spices. It was notably unique for the saison style and another fantastic beer from Three Floyds. I really, really liked it."
"drinkability is good. balanced and enjoyable. this one definitely leans over to the spiced side of saisons and away from the funky side. a solid and enjoyable beer."
"Another beer brought back from Milwaukee. I had no idea what to expect. This is a pretty interesting beer but different than the other 3 Floyds beers I've had. Maybe something to try again in the fall due to the pumpkin flavors."
"A drinkable ale, I had no problem getting a 650ml bottle down, but I switched to IPA afterward. I couldn't have more than one bottle at a time."
"Poured a copper amber color. About one finger of bright white bubbley head formed, and almost instantly dissapeared into a thin white layer on top of the beer. Smell: strong clove like aroma, hints of brown sugar, caramel, cinnamon, and maybe nutmeg. A rather strong aroma Taste: tastes like a warm pumpkin pie. More cinnamon, all spice, nutmeg, and sweet candy sugar. Didn't notice the chamomile. A very sweet drink, almost too sweet. Mouthfeel was a bit on the thin side but definitely had a good flavor. Not too bad of a brew. Pretty drinkable actually. A little strange. It's definitely not normal."
"The beer pours a nice amber color and is really hazy. The head is nice and fluffy. It is about 3/4 head and leaves some lace. Now here comes the weird part, the aromas. It is a strong fruity smell. I get a lot of soft fruits in there, but nothing citrusy or sharp. There are hints of nutmeg, cinnamon, and the dead on smell of fresh plain yogurt. The yogurt aroma is exceedingly overpowering to all other flavors. The chamomile is no where to be found. The aromas transfer to the taste but the yogurt seems to leave and turn into cinnamon and nutmeg. There is very little to no malt character, but the woody chamomile flavor comes out as it warms. The mouthfeel is rather full for the style guides, but then again farmhouse ales, are very subjective. It is a very drinkable beer. And something rather new."
"Thanks to BeerBeing for this one thru a trade. Poured from a 22oz bomber with no dating info into a tulip glass. It was a golden orangish color that was slightly opaque with a visible alcohol shimmer. It has about a finger of head that quickly went away. The smell was herbal and fruity with a definite alcohol presence. It didn't really smell like the typical saison but nothing FFF's does fits the normal definition (which I'm finding is not a good thing). The taste was really sweet with a kick at the end. ABV also shows in the taste. Much more so than other saisons that I've enjoyed. Overall, it's a good one but a poor saison. This is the 5th FFF's that I've had and I find that I like them to a moderate level as a beer but find they don't match the styles very well. Now that's fine since I don't believe you have to rigidly follow a style guide but it makes it tough to figure their beers out. For example, saison is one of my favorite styles but I wouldn't recommend this a saison. It's more like a Belgian Strong ale (3.5, RB, T, O)"
"My least favorite from Three Floyds so far. I love all their beers I've had in the past but this one just doesn't do much for me. Maybe next time I sample Rabbid Rabbit it will be a fresh bottle instead of a cellered one. Still solid but much different than my favorite saisons."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium bodied and has a slightly syrupy feel. It's relatively easy to drink, but at 9% drinkability is somewhat limited. Overall, it's a pretty good beer. Definitely worth a try."
"But oddly enough, after all that, it does go down nicely. It's a good thing I love tripels, because this is what I am reminded of with this beer. I like it!"
"Two expensive to drink more then once a year but good."
"D - Not bad, just a bit to sweet to be really drinkable. There are no major flaws in this beer, it fits fairly well into the saison style. However, it has no outstanding features either and it totally lacks the depth of flavor that characterizes a great saison. From other reviews, it sounds like it might be better on tap; I hope it is."
"22oz. brown bottle picked up at Goldstein's Deli. Appears a lightly cloudy amber color with about two fingers of fluffy off white head. Smell is sweet, fruity and spicy with just a hint of that characteristic musky aroma. Tastes of peppery and spicy yeast, and honey with pleasant flowery notes. Slightly thin bodied with medium carbonation. Not one I would seek out again, especially at the ""Three Floyds price"" this one commands."
"OA, I like it. A hoppy/bitter saison. Definately follows the 3F kick in that ""It's Not Normal"". Of course, saison as a ""category"" has a pretty wide definition anyway. Enjoy!"
"22oz. bottle poured into my glass a cloudy gold and peach color with a small white head that didn't leave but a few specks of lace. The smell has a great complexity to it with some sweet fruit and cinnamon toast. Taste has a light sweetness to it along with some spice and a bit of alcohol warming as it goes down. The feel is light with a slight tingle of carbonation and is also very drinkable due to the enjoyable flavors and well hidden alcohol. This is probably my first beer in the saison style and it intrigues me to try this one and others like it again."
"22 oz. bomber. Darker orange/apricot in color. A few chunks of goodness floating around in the glass. Thin white head disappears and leaves a thin layer. The aroma is abundant with fruit, tangerines, other citrus, floral notes, and a bit of sour funkyness going on. Nice malt character, a bit sour and spicy. Finishes with some nice fruit flavors again. Good amount of bitterness, no overkill here. Very interesting combo of flavors. This was very enjoyable."
"Thinner bodied with little carbonation. This one almost seems a bit flat. I may not have a perfect sample here in all fairness. So with that in mind, I might have to give it another try."
"Very clear, orange amber beer topped by a thin, slightly off-white head. The foam reduced to a long-lasting ring, leaving behind a bit of lacing. Peppery spice and citrus hit the nose initially, then earthy malts and a bit of farmhouse. A bit crackery with faint alcohol presence. Spicy, funky flavour with some malty, caramel sweetness up front. A bit fruity at the mid, light citrus and grassy hops. The finish had growing dry, bitterness and lingering spicy alcohol. Medium body and carbonation, which was lower than expected. Mild warmth. This is really enjoyable, very tasty and a little different from more classic saisons. Recommended!"
"Pours an amber color with medium carbonation and head. Aroma is not overly powerful, but is of spices, sweet malt and yeasty fruitiness. Taste is spicy, herbal and sweet. You can taste the rock candy a bit and definitely the chamomille. Just a touch of alcohol taste and some fruitiness. Seemed a little too sweet to me, actually. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, but needed more carbonation I think. Pretty drinkable, but too sweet and spicy to want a ton."
"a dramatically rich, smooth saison. tons of sweet cookie character in the flavor, and little hint of the high alcohol. a medium prickly carbonation and a very clean finish. not exactly a stellar example of the style, but it's easily my favorite saison: smooth, drinkable and flavorful, and definitely not normal."
"A decent offering in the style. Would go well with a light tomato and mozzarella salad as an apertizer. Interesting beer in a style that is underlooked by many brewers. If you get the chance try one yourself."
"Hazy deep amber orange body hosts a light tan head that is about an inch deep. Body almost glows. Very sweet wheaty zest on the nose with hints of honey and vanilla. A mouth filling fullness is what you get from the first sip. Syrupy sweetness is all over with a long malty bitter sour feel fading into the end of the palate. The finish an dmouthfeel really are the main down points to this beer I believe. It sells itself a little short with an odd unbalanced ending."
"Thank you nflmvp for this trade."
"D - Excellent except for the price...I paid an arm and a leg for this one! I love the strange, unique, and complex flavors."
"22oz. bomber: Mine poured out a crystal clear slightly lighter amber color. There was a small bit of fiziness and a small head that dropped off quickly. The aroma is nice. Hints of spiciness, floral, caramel, fruits and a few others, but it is a bit subdued. The taste is good. Notes of the caramel, spices and some others. A bit complex, yet also subdued. Good, but not great."
"Arguably the least interesting of all the three floyds beers I have tried, though it is certainly drinkable enough, with the alcohol barely noticed. There is a certain irony in my disappointment with the beer being that it wasn't mind-blowingly complex or unique, rather than just a very pleasant representative of style."
"This orange beer shows a lot of carbonation in the body and a flufffy white head that leaves ample amounts of lace. Sweet candyish aroma with a little yeastiness there as well. And a little pepper and a little lemon. Nice taste. It's got the bready yeast thing going on. It's got that lemon pepper thing going on. A little bit of a hop presence. Slight bitterness on the aftertaste. Great stuff. The carbonation isn't overly active on the palate. It's good enough to give a little scrubbing power though. Medium bodied and quite flavorful. Very drinkable."
"A saison, huh? Well, if so, it's a densely sweet and uniquely spiced saison. The bledning helps it aspire to being basic, but in a rather distinct fashion. It's fun while it lasts, but the sugary character keeps it just moderately drinkable in the absence of any overtly mitigating factors. So I don't know about rabid saison, but it is a different sort of experience."
"D- I like it a lot. After having a fantome though it made me relize its not a to good example of the style but it is good. Almost like a Gumball Head on steroids."
"Fruity in the aroma and taste, but wow, a quirky orange bubble-gum dominated the taste-buds. Very sweet and gummy brew, it just doesnt cut it as a saison. And for freakin $9 a bomber  brother, Ill spend my money elsewhere next time."
"Now I cant wait to try more 3Fs - in the times to come."
"D - Good. Nice flavor and not overbearing. Easy drinker."
"I was excited about his being my first three floyds. Poured a rust color with a little bit of orange and red mixed in. No head to speak of. Not to familiar with saisons at all but i was really impreseed. Was a little too cold, needed ot warm up some to get the full taste of the beer. Was very sweet, must be do to the rock candy but overall it was quite good."
"This was a good, not great saison, but I'd definitely drink it again. Also, paired very nicely with an aged gouda. From what the owner of the store (B&C Liquors in Smithfield, RI) I bought it at told me, 3 Floyds is ending their distribution to RI, which was the only place to find it out here. Too bad."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This beer is slightly less than medium bodied. The beer has a dry peppery finish. The beer is a bit too subtle and sweet for my taste. This was a strange beer experience for me. This is a Three Floyds beer I dont like and will not buy again. I suggest to my other BA's to drink something else."
"The mouth is slick with low carbonation. I like this beer, but it would be a once and a while beer for me. I paid $9.99 at Sams in Downers Grove. Seems a bit high priced, but Im glad I got to try it."
"Head is thin and the lacing isn't very strong. The color is very clear crisp and orangish brown. Smell is fruity and aromatic with orange flavors mixed with a smell I can only describe as Saison. The taste is hoppy and lightly fruity. The mouthfeel is a little too carbonated and has a small amount of bite to it. Overall this is very drinkable and I would like to have another."
"I hesitated over this bomber of Rabbid Rabbit Saison because the $10.99 price tag gave me temporary sticker shock. In a way, I'm glad that it was so expensive because it kept me from buying a half case as originally planned. The bottom line (for me at least) is that this rabbit is more like a fluffy little bunny than the hair-trigger hare depicted on the label. A rare Three Floyds disappointment."
"Not a true Saison, but typically a solid offering from one of the best breweries in America's Heartland. I'm certain that I will try this one again."
"...After revisiting this several times I have updated the mouthfeel from a 4 to a 4.5... It is really creamy."
"Looks good and smells good, but I can't say something is really drinkable if I don't like the taste. I realize Three Floyd's isn't normal, but this one isn't working well for me. I do; however, like the bottle art."
"If they would just call it a Belgian Style ale, I wouldnt be such a hard critic, but a saison it is not. An ok low 3s Belgian style, but as a saison, it misses the mark, especially in the appearence and mouthfeel department. Why would I buy this, when I can get Blaugies for the same price?"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" beige head over the clear amber brew. Head lasts nicely, with heavy sticky lacing. Aroma is spicy sweetness. Taste is sweet malts upfront, with spices kicking and haning out through the rest of the experience, with a warming swallow. Reminds me somewhat of a sedate tripel. Mouthfeel and drinkability both very nice. It may not be normal, but I'd drink it often."
"Bomber purchased at the new northern Foodery location in Philly. Couldn't find any freshness indication. The second glass from the bottle was very cloudy due to a respectable yeast load on the bottom of the bottle. This is a strange and differant brew, they put chamomile tea in it and it tastes of it. Sort of a sweat, yeasty, malty, off-kilter American heartland attempt at a Saison. I did pick up some more typical Belgian phenolics, but they are muddled and jumbled into this one. Not my favorite Three Floyds or Saison. Most likely would never purchase this one again."
"Side note: this is the 2nd Three Foyds beer I have had. I love the Dreadnaught but would probably not buy this again. I feel like they are reaching a bit too much in making a wacky unconventional beer - leave that to DFH and the like. Its really off the beaten path for a saison."
"bomber split with dirtylou during my stay in Madison"
"drinkability: pretty good"
"Picked up in Chicago. Pours a hazy dark orange, medium white head forms, good retention and nice lacing. Smell is sweet, wheat, floral, strawberries, some spice, yeast. Taste is wheat up front, floral and strawberry, chamomile and lavender, some vanilla, little bit weak in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, very smooth. Not my favourite 3F, but an interesting experiment."
"Mouthfeel- A tart and earthy beginning and finish. Very sweet saison if I do say so. Mild carbination and a little dry. But good dry."
"I really enjoyed this beer. Very different from any other FFF brew I've had. I expected there to be a much more prominent hop character after trying several other FFF beers, but the hoppy bitterness was absent. A very solid example of a saison in my opinion; not a great one, but a solid one. I'll definitely get this one again."
"Drinkability: I could drink many of these - not as good as what Dupont has to offer but these guys know what they are doing and this is a great american interpretation..."
" I would definitely like to have more of this beer on hand to share with some of my wife which loves Saisons."
"Borderline tripel-like in malts and tone with some of my favorite Belgian trips. Very good stuff. Drinkable and sliding open to extreme sessioning; even given its bigger ABV. Which isn't very evident anywhere by the way? Subtle, complexing malt play, both within the flavor and body. Wow, a solid and fun brew from 3F. Who woulda knew? S o l i d ."
"Not bad. I mixed up the yeast on the bottom and added it to my glass and that managed to balance out the sweetness. With that done, this beer becomes less sweet and considerably more drinkable."
"""It's Not Normal","It's Not Great"" either."
"Rabbid Rabbit has a modest head and a deep golden color that strikes me as a bit on the dark side. The smells are faint but spicy and fresh. This is a deeply tangy and rather spicy beer, though I can't really pick out identifiable spice tastes. Not very much in the way of earthy or yeasty qualities here, but this is none the less a complex beer. Mouthfeel is kinda thick and syrupy, but doesn't hurt drinkability much as it seems to kind of blunt the spices. Highly carbed this might be a bit harsh. Drinkability is dangerous for a beer of this ABV. Not the faintest hint of booze. It definately had me assed. I don't know much about Saison, but I know I really liked this beer, and found myself wishing it had less alcohol so I could drink more of it."
"Poured a reddish orange from a 22oz. bomber into a pint glass, slightly hazy, left a short-lived half finger white head that fell away to a light white lacing. Aroma is sweet and spicy, slightly bready like a belgian, light hop aroma present along with lighter herbal notes filling out the nose. Taste is sweet and herbally spicy, light breadiness in the aftertaste, well balanced hops and malt. Complex flavors,citrus orange notes accompanied with honey and coriander. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate levels of carbonation, finished clean and smooth leaving an herbal aftertaste. Drinkability pretty good considering the well hidden 9% abv that easily sneaks up on you if you're not expecting it. Overall another solid offering from the masters at Three Floyd's, but far from my favorite beer I know they're capable of."
"A good beer. I guess I expect a bit more from the Three Floyds, but still worthwhile."
"Definitely a tasty beer that I can't tell is 9% from the taste. I don't think this is quite as drinkable as Hennepin is but this is quite close. If this was a bit drier it could make a 5 in drinkability."
"Cloudy dark orange body with a white fluffy head that clings to the glass as it drops. Nice floral hops in the aroma with funky yeast notes. Some fruits, mainly orange come out the more this warmed. Flavor starts off with some fruit sweetness with yeast and bready malts. Very light spiciness and fruity finish. Pretty thick for the style but smooth and easy enough going down. Definitely not among my favorite of the style but it was solid."
" It's a hazy gold, with tons of bubbles and a very small white head. Maintains great lacing. Nose is very yeasty and a bit spicy. Taste is a nice spicy mix of coriander and orange oil. The coriander lingers around for a nice sharp finish. Alcohol is very well hidden. The spice is very one-noted, but nicely balanced by the orange. Mouthfeel is creamy and super carbonated. Drinkability is good, it's an interesting brew."
"orange, kind of cloudy with a white head that disappears quickly. smells sour and spicy with some ethanol. Taste is orange rind and coriander in a big smash. Orange is very strong, so is the spiciness. Gets spicer as you drink more, which makes it interesting but not particulaly palatable. I dont think this beer should get the flack it gets for not being ""crazy"" enough or fitting into the 3 Floyd's lineup, i mean, it's certainly ""not normal," and its tastes very different from other Saison's i've had without totally diverging from the style. Im not going to buy it again, mainly because of the price, but i'll remember it."
"Slàinte!"
"22 oz bottle. Pours a solid peachy color with just a light broken film over top. Clarity is very good and just a few stray bubbles are making their way to the surface of the brew. There is not as much carbonation or head as I expected to see on this one. The first big inhale brings solid sweetness, both from pilsner malt and the candied sugar, with orangey zestyness and a ,ild chamomile spiceyness rounding it out. The first sip brings good sweet candied chamomile, with a light banana and orange background. None of the flavors are very strong, and everything blends well. I've had this one off tap a while back, and I recall the chamomile really popping and making this beer shine. It is taking a back seat now. The finish is a Mouthfeel is moderate with a pretty weak carbonation. I really would like to see this one with a nice effervescenceto make it feel more light. Overall, this one is tasty and overall a nice drink. As it is warming, the chamomile is starting to pop a little more, fiving it a nice spicey, almost light cinnamon and graham character. I know there is variation in batches, but this one just seems different from what I remember it being. This one is a monster at 9%, so it is a really drinkable brew for the punch it has. Its not necessarily what I look for in a saison, but this is 3F's...It's not normal."
"Drinkability: Crisp, balanced flavor is awesome and infinitely drinkable, though the alcohol militates against drinking too much. The price probably means I won't return to this for a while - at $10, this is more expensive than many Belgian counterparts and twice the price of Ommegang's Hennepin. Nonetheless, a great golden ale that will please fans of Belgians and of FFF."
"A good brew."
"A very drinkable brew. I enjoy the hop aggressiveness for the style. A little sweeter and fruitier than expected for the style."
"Malt dominates the flavor profile... doughy and gently candyish. It's rich and round and just subtly toasty and mildly caramel-tinged. Light herbal and floral spiciness rounds it out, and then floats about the mouth in the finish. Some delicate phenolics lend a hand to it's candy character. Bitterness is kept at a minimum for the style, and this is a malt-monster compared to most of the saisons coming out of Belgium and France. It lacks a bit of complexity and dryness, and perhaps even balance. Still, it's quite enjoyable as it is, and surprisingly drinkable. It's just not what I think of when I think of Saison."
"Cloudy peach-tinted amber with a very small, white, foamy head. Smells of wheat with some mild yeast and a touch of piney hops. Citrus, white wine, apricot and a solid alcohol presence. The taste is rather sweet up front. Clove, pine, apricot, peach. A little more hoppy than Im used to getting from a saison. It has a medium body, mildly astringent, light syrupy texture. An odd one for sure. Not my favorite saison by any means, but one thats worth trying. Big thanks to hero27 for the chance to try this one."
" Overall, I enjoyed this. I will try on tap at a later date."
"Pours a rich, clear copper color with 1/2 inch of foam that dissipates quickly. The aroma has a rich bready smell that is rather vinous with a light gingery spice. I also detect somewhat of a funky, tangy aroma. The taste also carries a light spice and a nice malty backbone, mildy sweet of bread and citrus. The finish has a hint of sourness and just a small touch of a DMS like flavor. Not bad, interesting, very different than what I expect from a Saison. The mouthfeel was light with moderate carbonation present. Unique in flavor, I wasn't overly impressed by this brew, but I still found it to be an easy drinker. I didn't notice until after I was almost finished that it's actually 9% ABV, so perhaps I should have shared this bottle? Give it a try if you get a chance..."
"Soooo surprisingly smooth. And warming. High ABV on this one, and it's sneaky. I like it."
"The smell was kind of funky in a good way, and included the 3F aroma of hops. The taste was not so hoppy, more biting and maybe just a little bitter. Pretty smooth but not as grassy or bubblegummy as Belgian saisons I've tried. But a pretty good saison."
"Bottle from Robertdoesbeer: Poured a slightly dark yellow color ale with a medium bubbly white head with minimal retention. Aroma of spices is interesting with some subtle (for 3F anyway) citrus hops. Taste is a bit puzzling with a nice mix between some sweet malt and great spice mix. The end is a bit too dry and a tad too hoppy for my own taste. Body is way too thin for the style and way too filtered IMO. Even though it is an interesting beer, there is no way that this is close to the farmhouse Saison style being brewed in Belgium."
"This beer poured a bright amber color. It's topped by a thin off white head, and has just a bit of sediment that settles quickly into the glass. The smell has a nice yeast quality. Bread dough, a bubblegum quality, a little green apple, and mild spice. The flavor has an almost candy quality. The bubblegum character is back, the apple reminds me of a Jolly Rancher. Spice comes through pretty quickly. There is some white pepper, a little cardamom, and a touch of citrus orange. Its fascinating to drink a beer from 3 Floyds that doesnt have an assertive hop character. The mouth feel is slightly sticky with just a bit of heat. Nice beer, not great, but its fun to have something different from 3Floyds."
"Pours a clear orange color with little head that is gone fast and doesn't leave any lacing on the glass. The aroma has a lot of spice, citrus, and fruitiness going on. The flavor is much the same. Lots of spices and citrus along with hints of fruit and it seems to have a little too much bitterness. I'd have preferred this one with a little less hops, but it's still a tasty brew."
"D: It was hot and I was thirsty. Generally saisons and heat go really well together. I was hoping for something a bit dry that begins the self perpetuating cycle of drinking a saison because it makes you thirsty. This is just sweet."
"Pours a a golden, orange color, quite clear. Minimal white head, maybe half inch, that fades quickly. No lacing is left behind. Some cloudy sediment left in the bottom of the bottle. Big bready malt smells, with lots of spices, pepper and a touch of alcohol. Some fruity and floral aromas. Sweet malt taste, bready, and yeasty. Some fruit flavors show up, maybe banana and orange peel. Medium bodied mouthfeel, with a nice crispness to it. Easy too drink, especially during the summer months. Not my favorite style of beer, but this is worth a try, but not worth $10 a bomber."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability  This was a pleasant, easy drinker that went down well. It was off-style but adequate."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, on the lighter side with good steady bubbles. Quite refreshing with no sign of the slightly high abv to be found. A good summer brew that I'll enjoy on the beach when I'm camping in July. This is an interesting take on a saison that ends up being quite enjoyable. However, the price point pushes down the drinkability on this one for me personally. If it was more around $5 a bomber I'd be drinkin it all summer!"
"22 oz bottle pours a hazy copper color with a small off white head that doesn't last long and leaves very little lacing in the glass. Aromas of flowers and spice, spicy yeast, honey and hay flavors. Medium bodied with a smooth mouthfeel, finishes dry. Good drinkability for the 7.4% alcohol and that is about it, 9 bucks a bottle I just don't get it."
"D: Goes down very easily, might be a bit filling and the 9.00% ABV may catch up with you after a while, but if you can put that aside, you’ll be throwing this beer back for a long time. This is yet another excellent beer from Three Floyd’s. I wasn’t too thrilled with the Saison style, but I liked this one much better than the others that I’ve had."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"perhaps not the most drinkable beer due to three floyds' patented excess, but a noble effort at a style- applause-worthy. lots of saison styles out now, this is the best one."
"Received from orbitalr0x as part of BIF 33, this 22 oz. bomber had a humorous label of rabbit attacking a gnome. When poured, this one came out a hazy golden color, which was a little deeper than typical. It was also under-carbonated compared to other examples of this style. Aromatically, it was a little too clean, which may have been due to me over chilling it. I could detect floral hops and green apple (which must be the chamomile), but none of the funk and spiciness that is typical of farmhouse ale. The taste was dominated by hops and chamomile with some unfermented candy sugar still evident. The warmer the beer got, the stronger the chamomile taste and smell became. Like Avery 12 (which has lavender), the flowers gave this a one dimensional quality. But unlike the 12, this was an agreeable one dimensionality. I much prefer the funky yeasty Saisons over these floral varieties. The Mouthfeel was medium thick, which was more in line with a Trippel than a Saison. The alcohol was well hidden, and the aftertaste was grainy sweet. It was quite drinkable, considering the fact that I dont particularly care about chewing on flowers."
"I think if 3F's said they were making a strong belgian ale in the spirit of Duvel, I would have had a very different approach to this beer. The profile of it fits much better with that style. I liked Rabbid Rabbit, but I really would not call it a saison."
"Amber/orange in color with a nice active white head. The smell is fruity and sweet with a little alcohol bite. The taste is fairly complex, with lots of sweet sugars and malts, fruity yeast flavors, and a combination of hops and spices that leave a slightly herbal finish. Mouthfeel is slightly sticky, but balanced in the carbonation department. Overall this is probably one of the best I've had from the Floyds."
"Drinkabilty - this goes down easy, but it does not entirely taste like a saison - like many 3F's it claims to be a certain style but actually sort of does its own thing - a good thing usually, certainly a distinctly 3F thing, and this is really good, just not entirely ...a saison. High and well hidden abv limit it to just one bomber per session."
"Quality brew to be expected from Three Floyds. The color is stuck somewhere between copper and orange with a light haze and a mysterious glow. The aromas of bruised fruits, spices, and must. The taste confirms the aromas. Heavy flavors of peaches, pears, oranges, apricots, mangos, and papayas (all of the over-rippened variety) with a light pepery spiciness. Lovely medium texture, creamy and smooth; softens a bit in the finish for easy drinking. The beer did have a 'dish soap' flavor that began midway through the sip and lingered into the aftertaste which was a mild deterant. I also prefer a less rich fruitiness, but prefer a lighter refresher 'juicy' Saison. I also prefer a bit more woodsy, musty, and earthy flavor in the style. Nevertheless, I do recommend the brew. Thanks Kmpitz2 for the find on the road."
"22 ounce bottle. Thanks afatty for picking up this scary green elf eating thing for me."
"D- This beer has lots of nice complex flavors that disguise one another very nicely. The flavors are hard to pull apart but all work together and the hops are big but appropriate to the beer. No big pine flavor or grapefruit flavor in the hops."
"O: Solid Saison. I like some of the classics like Dupont better. This wasn't quite as clean and crisp as Dupont, but still good. I reviewd this almost a year ago on tap at the brewery and thought it was better. Don't know if there's any difference now that they're bottling it."
"If you're into that sort of thing..."
"Mouthfeel is warming with spices and pepper jumping around."
"The body is moderate. Not too sticky. Fairly dry and spicy in the finish. Not too bitter, since the hops are subtle yet aggressive. Drinkability is good, though as I've already stated, it's no match for Gumballhead in that department. I wish I had more."
"I'm not a huge Saison fan, but I enjoyed this one. The spices and fruits blend together really well, and the soft malts round this out a bit to make for a very sweet offering from a brewery typically known for it's extreme use of hops. For 9%, it's amazing how every sip still feels very crisp & refreshing without being heavy at all. Certainly very different from every other Three Floyds brew I've had to date, and an interesting take on the style. Absolutely worth a try."
"Very particular yeast flavor. Complex fruit flavors of the tropical variety. Some peach, banana, malt and a nice blend of hops. Mouthfeel is somewhat bitter and sharp. Not necessarily a bad thing but the finish is slightly off. A good Saison but not the best."
"thanks to bbb63 from the other site at the Kuhnhenn gathering on 6/10. from the bottle. poured a golden brown, with a small white head. aroma spicey, orange, cloves, ginger, coriander and hints of floral. flavor a nicce blend of cinnamon, gloves, ginger and orange peel and touch of malts come out at the end with a dry mouthfeel. good beer"
"Hazy gold color. Medium head for a 9% ABV. Aroma is delicate by Saison standards and suggests cloves, ginger, milder yeast (somewhere between earthy and bready) and floral hops - no hint of alcoholic aroma. Malts are blended with fruity esters and seem slightly sweet. Amarillo hops are floral and offer no bitterness. Maybe the best presentation of delicate hop flavors that I have yet encountered. Smooth taste that is light and refreshing to fit the summer season but this is not your simple summer thirst quencher. Complex spices and hop flavors open up with warmth. Pleasant diacetyl taste adds to a full and round mouthfeel. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet (I heard described as honey and bread) - no bitterness. The alcohol may dry the mouth a little but stayed hidden as you finally sense the ABV by effect not taste. Most drinkable."
"I found the drinkability so good I had trouble saving a glass in the growler for my best freind."
"Draft served by Nick Floyd. How, this is even better than when they had it last year. Great coriander & citrus spiciness (""light spicing"" my Aunt Fanny!), even a suggestion of cinnamon, layered on a good caramel malt base (Its better than that, actually, but all the adjectives I want to use are already on their own description). A burly drink; a lawnmower beer only if youve been mowing golf greens for 8 hours."
"Anyway, I did get a strong taste of apple crisp. It was very comfortable and inviting. Something I could drink often with a chicken dish."
"Thanks, Floyds, and most of all, thanks to cretemixer for the growler!"
"ng"
"Served on tap. Pours a hazy gold with a thick white head. Lavender and chamomile dominate the aroma. Some floral spiciness linger in the background from the hops. The body is full and very flavorfull. Definately something different to drink if you have not had a saison before."
"Tasted at the 2003 Oregon Brewers Fest. Medium gold color. Medium head. Aroma is a touch barnyard, leather and must. A medium bodied saison. Malts are fruity and slightly sweet. Hops are floral. Smooth taste. Light and refreshing. Very nice beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet."
"Very good beer:  wonderful aroma of Belgian yeast/banana, with the same initial taste.  Initial impressions are misleading, however, as the taste was dominated by hops, with a spicy kick.  Nice alcohol warmth in the end. Excellent."
"Amber-gold color, with a nice white head.  Good retention.  Very spicy aroma - the coriander really comes through, with undertones of citrusy orange.  Good flavor, spicy, yeasty, and smooth.  Taste of alcohol apparent as the beer warms.  Lightly zesty mouthfeel with the continual carbonation.  Overall, a tasty brew.  Not really my favorite style, so hopefully my review isn't skewed..."
