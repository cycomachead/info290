3.84,16,3.5,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,"this beer is appallingly under rated. i mean, yeah it could use a little more carbonation, and sure, it might not be the most delicious beer in the whole world, but to score this so low is offensive. the beer is aweomse, its a clear golden color, dim in the radiance, but bright in aroma and taste. honey is raw and not all that sweet, but real authentic, and something pretty unique in a beer, as its flavorful and not fermented out, but yet pretty dry. the rye is what makes it though for me, honey and rye together, they almost act to offset one another, but instead join forces and make it distinct. mellow but bold, real hard to do, but really well done there. again, a little flat, and thats my main knock against it, but this is a great sixer of beer, one of my favorites from montana, and a cool fusion of ingredients that dont always get paired together. excellent beer, drinkable for miles, and im craving another as i type this. way better than the other(s) i have had from madison river...","StonedTrippin","Nov 18, 2014"

Honey more prominent on tongue than nose. Acidity and carbonation lingers. Smooth, lighter feel blends well, somewhat foamy texture. Overall, not bad. Not as tasty as I'd like it to be. Would recommend for a session style beer on a warm summer day.","sporklift87","Oct 31, 2014"

3.5,5.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Sampled at Beer Revolution in Calgary, a relatively pale gold/just shy of amber rye beer with minimal white froth on top. I was immediately struck by the fruity nose, which features assertive but nondescript orchard fruit notes, citrus, and floral vanilla overlaid on a sweet white bread and cereal malt base. Not much in the way of rye character on the nose. As is so often the case, the taste follows the nose. Indubitably the fruitiest rye beer I've yet to encounter, the orchard fruit carries over onto the taste buds (pear!), there's some vanilla and sweet honey, violets, graham cracker, and some characteristic rye spice thankfully, although this latter element is still downplayed compared to most examples of the style. There's some rye enhancement but not much; someone apparently did not wish to alienate too many palates and the result is a rye beer that comes off like a high-end cream ale. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel, thinnish body, and some pleasant lemon-lime citrus in the finish, which lacks in the bitterness and spice departments. Rather difficult to rate this one, as while I enjoyed it on the basis of its own merits, it is missing much in the way of rye character.","CalgaryFMC","Dec 10, 2013"
