"Poured a copper body with solid head and lace ring down glass.  Aroma is citric, floral hops and a hearty malt base, some of it being the rye (I think).  This is a really smooth IPA with the rye helping smooth things out and having a noticeable presence.  Beer is balanced as it has citric hop dryness and a little bit of malty sweetness.  Not the most flavorful rye beer but the sour and dry, grainy aspects are minimal and that's how I prefer a rye beer. I had this in draft, not can , so apparently I missed out."

"Mouthfeel is rich and crisp,  The  slight sweetness from the malt, the Simcoe hops  and  rye are nice balanced mix on the tongue. There is no hint of alcohol.  This beer holds up nicely over the 24 ounces. I  would drink this one again."

"O: 3.75 - Drinkable enough, but not interested in having more than once."

"Pours a golden amber color with white head. Dankness, spice, pine, and earth tones on the nose; follows onto the palate. Finishes with an earthy grassy note"

"Pours a beautiful clear gold with ample head and tremendous lacing clinging all over the glass. Aroma is dank, hoppy, piney with some grapefruit and assorted citrus. Taste is very hoppy, with plenty of piney hops and grapefruit. Carbonation is a touch lighter than I would have wanted, but overall, this beer feels good and the 7% ABV is hidden very well !!!"

"Poured a nice clear Amber.  Almost no head when poured from a 24oz can.  Fant citrus smell with a hint of Simcoe.  Smooth with a nice spicy grapefruit finish.  Not a whole lot of body but very drinkable.  Would not search it out but would drink again."

"Aroma of citrus, spicy rye, malt, caramel. Taste sweet spicy rye, malt, grapefruit, faint grassiness, bitter finish. Nice!"

"Sorry, kids, but there was no way that I was going to perform an inverted Glug with a 24-oz. CAN following the Crack! I went with a heavy-handed pour, instead, and still got two-plus fingers of tawny head with moderate retention. The head fell as I was typing and cuing up some accompanying music, but loads of lacing remained in its wake. Color was Amber to Deep Amber/Light Copper (SRM = > 9, "

"Before this, I don't think that I ever had an official beer of a band - check that off the list."

"Wow. Surprisingly good. Well balanced with a nice piney finish."

"To be blunt, it's a standard smaller brewery IPA.  To be fair, it's a decent representation.  This beer fits what I think is the new normal for a decent, no bones, enjoyable local/small brewery IPA.  It's not special, but it's not to be avoided either."

"Overall: a nicely done rye ipa. a bit too much rye to be refreshing and just enough sweetness to give a slight balance to the rye."
