"A nice beer. Very autumnal. Appreciate that, while this is a full flavored beer, the oak aging and spices aren't overdone."

"Overall: This is a really nice rye ale from a dependable Maine brewer. Autumn seasonals are full of browns, marzens and pumpkins and it's nice to see a slightly spicy rye in the mix for a change of pace. Good stuff."

"The taste also has those malts and hops but there is an added minor spice bit. If the label did not say Autumn I would have thought it was a standard pale ale."

"Beer is medium to medium-light in body with carbonation of medium intensity, resulting in a mouthfeel that is strongly foamy (9/10) and slightly smooth (1/10). Seems a bit foamy for the beer and style, a bit more smoothness would benefit this ale. Closes dry, with light stickiness coating the palate."

"O - Its ok, not my favorite beer at all, could benefit from more balance."

"12oz can @ Duckfat: This one pours a cloudy, amber color. There was a large frothy tan head on it. Almost no lacing. It has a nice nose. Spice, pine and rye notes. The taste is very good. Rye, spice, hint of pine. Perhaps a touch of orange and ginger. A touch bitter. Very Nice!"

"Over all this is a very good beer although I felt the pine like flavor from the hops was a bit too forward and made this brew somewhat off balance. However, the underlying, deep flavors added a complex and likeable beer. The malt came through and added some sweetness. The finish was somewhat bitter (which I like) and left no lingering after taste. I would not make this my every day drink but I will be happy to have this in my refrigerator in the autumn."

"Overall: One of the better ""Autumn"" Ales I have had."

"Overall this beer lacks definition. I can't say it is off style because it's merely a unique take on the general fall-beer theme. But it does seem muddled and confused. And some ingredients that are supposed to be in this beer are not distinguishable. It doesn't taste bad and I will finish the 6 pack, but I sure wont buy it again. I say its best to drink this with a hearty meal, rather than on its own."
"This brew shows a murky haze of rusty brown with a stout tan-ish head and goodly gobs of lacing. The aroma offers a malty mulled apple with hints of light lemon hop. It definitely sets the stage for those October days. The flavor brings more bright yeasty bread over the same cider malt with woodsy-leafy characteristics and a dry grass finish. I get some ideas of nutmeg and tea and hints of orange clove. It's medium bodied with delicate but purposeful carbonation that provides a good bit of tongue tingle and refreshment for those football afternoons and brisk autumn winds. Very woodsy, crisp and flavorful. Nice job Baxter!"
"An easy to drink beer with lots of flavor. Very malty."

"Overall: Pretty solid rye beer that I have enjoyed a bunch this year and last. The can aspect is good for those warm and cool fall days."

"Overall ok but nothing special. More like hoppy American red ale with hints if mulling spices and touch of toasty oak. But still more of an average craft beer, and very light nose, spices orish could have cut in more, maybe mix up the malts a bit, something to at least bring a specific character out rather than a mundane American red ale with hints if something that could have made it more unique."

"Poured from a can into a tumbler pint, the beer is a deep, dark, almost opaque ruby-copper coloring with a tall, frothy, dense, off-white head that starts around an inch and a half and slowly settles into a half an inch that remains for the duration of the brew. Slightly hazed body gives the appearance of opaqueness. Aromas of a malt-bomb. Rich, roasty caramel and nut, with a subtle grainy underlying character. Smells pretty good. Flavors are hop forward, surprisingly, with a resiny and bitter backbone that supports the grainy and malty profile. Tangy and sweet caramel with a roasting characteristic, blended with some pepper spices from the hops. The malt profile is a bit restrained compared to the nose, providing a little more breathing room for the hops presence. Resiny and peppery aftertaste, with a touch of sweetness at the very end. Slick, rich finish, with a clean, slightly drying feel. The body is a bit lighter/watery compared to what I was expecting on the pour, but the flavors are interesting and tasty. Easy to drink."
"Not what you might expect but it hits the spot. The ginger, citrus and spicy flavors on-top of a amber-brown malt profile make for a nice Autumn ale."

"Notes: A very good Rye beer citrus hops with light belgian yeasty notes. Cheers."

"Poured from the can into a pint glass. Murky orange red body with a white head. Smell has piney and citrus-like. Taste was not really what I was expecting. The can says it has all these spices in it, plus it's aged on oak. I didn't get any of that. All I tasted was a hoppy amber ale that tasted like all their other beers. Mouthfeel was sharp and crisp, which was on par for a rye beer. It's not a bad beer, but it was just kind of a letdown because I wanted more flavor."
"A beer of ostentatious vs. mild: bright, vibrant hops vs. mild and mellow oak. Spicy rye vs. subtle honey sweetness. It's a bit messy but I like it. Most of the time."
"This was way too sharp for me. I think a little bit of rye goes a long way, and this was a bit over the top."
"I really like how this beer is malty but dry, and the spices don't overpower. Far and away the best Baxter offering I've had. When you get a clean can or pour of Baxter, the beer is solid. (4)"

"O: I really enjoyed this beer, this is a great fall rye ipa, nice body and warmth, complexity and balance, defiantly give this one a go."

"Taste is a bit more complex than the aroma unfortunately it's all over the place, what starts out with caramel malt soon is hit with other flavors like ginger, rye pops in the aftertaste along with a spicy hop character, sharp carbonation with a surprisingly soft and full bodied mouthfeel."
"The body is medium with good carbonation. Overall this one is alright. Nothing super special but surely not bad. I'm sure there are other seasonals I'll enjoy more though."
"O/D-Cool set of flavors to put other for an Autumn brew. May be a bit too ambitious because none of the flavors really stand out. Baxter has some interesting brews and this one fits in with their collection. They just didn't really nail it with this one."
"Kudos to Baxter for trying things outside the box."

"O: This is a nicely complex brew that captures the season well. Perfect for the cooler weather, and as always with this brewery, easy to transport in the canned format"

"O: another great beer by Baxter that I would definitely have again."
