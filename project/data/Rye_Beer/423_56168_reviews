"cloudy and sediment-ridden.  smells like raisin and sweet biscuit.  big ol' rye & whiskey barrel taste, with some nice plum/dark fruit notes.  aftertaste is the same.  delicious!"

"My on complaint is I let this bottle warm up to room temperature (which where I live is 50) and unlike other bottle conditioned beers this one was a gusher.  But looking past that it was the best foam I have ever had. Nice rye spiciness and the whiskey flavor and aroma does wonders. It's not stout like at all with lots of chocolate or coffee flavors but it is a dark full bodied beer with some nice tones of whiskey and rye. The person who blended this is a magician, well i am guessing it's blended based on the ratio but overall good beer thick warming great tasting."
"A classic from Boulevard. None of the flavors punch you in the nose, but the nose is excellent. Not sure I would pay $12.99 again, though. Maybe $9.99. So probably my last bottle."

"Mouthfeel is alright, a little disappointing.  Has a light feel on the tongue yet it has a really strong lingering flavor.  A bit of a high carbonation level, but not overly aggressive.  Starts bitter, goes slightly sweet, then goes to a dry, hard bitter finish, and even hot at the end.  Good but not great beer.  I've had it fresh and aged and they both are pretty good.  I'd drink it again for sure.  This is a beer that should be shared in my opinion though, it's strong and not overly deep which slightly brings down it's drinkability, but you could still finish it on you own if you're into this kind of beer."

"O:  this beer kills it plain and simple. it's smooth, complex and just so good.  Definitely one of my favorite Boulevard beers that I look forward to seeing again next year."

"Big rye whiskey flavors marry perfectly with the underlying rye ale. A winner."

"Equal parts strong and smooth, this is no beer for the faint of heart. It poured nicely and it's rich brown color and head were ascethitcally pleasing. The aroma is what you'd expect from a beer aged in rye whiskey barrels. Full of flavor on the front and back end, along with a pleasing aftertaste. All in all, very well crafted brew!"

"Boozy and delicious. Did I mention it's boozy??? Super strong, packed with flavor, it's a butt-kicker no doubt. It's like taking a drink of barleywine and chasing it with bourbon. It's obnoxious and if you don't like huge beers that punch you in the face then you need not imbibe this glorious nectar. However if you do appreciate the awesomeness that is a 12% whisky barrel aged rye bomb then by all means.... drink deeply and allow your palate to forever be left wanting. Great job once again Boulevard, please send me free beer....j/k... but seriously...."

"Maybe a little hard on this to start, as it improved as it warmed and slowly grew on me. Still was hoping for more sweetness and maybe it was one of those ""not on the mood for this right now"" issues. But it paired nicely with some dried figs, and I suspect would be enhance with some funky cheese alongside that."

"As previously mentioned I'm a huge fan of rye beers (Lenny's RIPA is a favorite) and this beer takes rye in a totally different direction. Rye and hop bitterness play really well together. But an IPA this is not. It is, however, a fantastic barleywine, and a fantastic way to showcase oak aging. And also a really delicious rye beer."

"Boozy number here no doubt. Enjoyed growler from Lincoln Filling Station. Another tremendous beer from Boulevard. At 12% this is a sipper for sure . meant to be enjoyed at a slow pace. Appearance is caramel colored and cloudy. Smell is boozy and rye whiskey. Taste is rye and caramel, booze. Mouthfeel is warming thick and creamy with whiskey notes.  Overall a solid 5 best whiskey barrel aged beer I've tried"

"I'd prefer this beer to be a little drier, and use more rye malts, but other than that, this is a fairly decadent, delicious beer."

"I really liked this beer, but didn’t love it. My ratings could have gone a few different ways, but it was definitely tasty. Booziness rules the day."

"D: Not as in depth as I had hoped for but still a damn fine brew. Recommend taking your time with this one even though this is actually well balanced and very approachable. Not only because it is such a big beer but temp really allows it to blossom and improves this one quite a bit. I think they blended this one down so well that many of the flavor components are fairly nuanced."
""
""
"I'm torn on whether this is one to cellar or enjoy now. I could definitely see how cellaring could improve it, but as it is its pretty awesome and I'm worried that cellaring would smooth out the somewhat rough character that I like in rye."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Decadent, masterful beer. A real gem."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall a real enjoyable beer. Something that each time you sip at it you taste something new, or a familiar flavor melds into something else. Not sure I have my head wrapped around this one, and I will have to see what it does as it warms. With a little bit of time this beer changes from a complex brew into an easy sipping beer to be enjoyed slowly, and savored."

"O: Rye-on-Rye is a unique drinking experience -- it melds whiskey, rye malt, and barrel character with a deft hand. I recommend drinking this beer young to get the best of all three -- my bottle is probably about 2 months in my hand and probably about 4 since bottling. Stellar beer."

"Mouthfeel is nice, creamy, hint of grittiness. Overall...too hot to be great, but some pleasant flavors otherwise."
"O: So glad I got this at the bar. A little pricier than the others, but definitely worth it. I'll be getting the bottle when I go to the shop next. Cheers!"
""
"O: Oh yeah, this hits my palate in all the right places. It's sweet, but not too sweet. It's spicy, but not too spicy. It's boozy...no fuck that, it's not boozy at all. Boulevard really worked wonders here - it's so good, I think I'll kill this 750 solo."

"Excellent beer, but then again, I've never had a big rye I DIDN'T like. This one was robust, a bit boozy, but not as much as I was hoping for. Some fluffiness in the mouthfeel that tells me there was plenty of yeast. The spiciness of the rye comes through perfectly, though I do detect hop bitterness added in to try to cut into the sweet and sour taste. Maybe not enough bitterness, though. The one thing I didn't like about this beer was it was a bit too sweet. It was a fun sour-sweet that I like about rye, but both the sweet and sour character were a bit cloying. I wish they'd been cut into a bit with some smoky wood, some roasted malt, or maybe even hops. At the same time, I know this was an experiment into how big and ""how rye"" they could make a rye beer. So, it was fun to try, but definitely a cloyingly sweet and sour taste was left in my mouth that was unpleasant."

"Best rye beer I've had. Superb!"
"This bottle was fresh but the rye scent was all too soft with a more barley grain tone. The rye then became very tangy on the tongue with hints of grain and a strong bourbon alcohol taste. This did not take on the complexity I expected nor the overly overt flavors that it claimed, but it was still a good drink."

"Overall: great beer, hides the alcohol well."

"O- Malt and wood forward with no discernible hop flavor or aroma but just enough bitterness to provide balance. A classic to look forward to each year."
""
"Poured a brownish body with decent head and lace and has a sweet, boozy aroma, picking up a good amount of not only bourbon/barrel notes with alcohol but love the dark fruits (figs/raisins) and minor rye base (not overpowering) in the aroma. A medium bodied beer that is chewey and has some sweetness to it, figs and plums coming through with a little bit of sugary goodness and there is a woodiness and alcohol kick to this beer - the rye makes the beer real smooth and adds some heat and alcohol bite to this beer as well as a touch of sweetness; the rye is front and center in this beer. At times the sweetness is puckering but overall the beer is well balanced and the ABV is kept in check and this is just a solid drinking beer."
""
""
""
"I could see this aging great. Too bad I just drank my only bottle."
""
"O- One thing that I like about Boulevard's limited release beers, is that they only use a blend of barrel aged beers,complimenting the base beer and allowing the to shine. The rye plays well with the barrel notes and drinks very easily for the ABV. Very good"

"Overall- With the 2014 in hand, I have the last few years of this delicious beer and am excited to give them all a shot thisyear. This beer ages extremely well while still being drinkable first year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A great sipping beer. I am a little surprised that I have enjoyed this beer as much as I have. I normally don't enjoy barrel aged beers that much because I don't like the taste of bourbon but maybe I should give rye whiskey a try if it's half as good as this beer."
"Mouthfeel is good.medium to light body with moderate carbonation keeps this very drinkable through all the big flavors."
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
""

"Overall- Good to really good beer. But rather pedestrian for Boulevard. This brewery does such good work that it's really hard to praise a competent beer from them. It's not exactly my cup of tea but it could be amazing for someone else. Must try for those who like rye beers but know that this is very sweet (with notes of cherry, lemon, and orange). Connotes bourbon without any real bourbon flavors. A fun beer but not one I could drink a lot of."
"overall, a very nice brew for 12%. a little different than what I was expecting, but decent."
""

"This was my first experience with a boulevard bomber...and I loved it! medium to dark brown in color, unfiltered with a 1 inch foamy khaki head. there is a definite mediumly strong aroma of sweet bourbon and some slight rye. the taste is great! again the sweet bourbonyness takes the forefront, but there is some pleasant rye undertones that are pretty solid, unfortunately the rye flavor subsides after the first few drinks. this beer has a great body and mouthfeel as well, moderately low carbonation. this is a rich sipper for sure but nothing the experienced bourbon/beer/bourbon beer drinker cant take on on his own. great beer and good for the cellar too!"
"O- great BA Rye beer smooth mellow whiskey notes"
"750 ml bottle for $14.99"

"**I edited this description throughout drinking it as the beer warmed up to room temp and it got much better. So don't necessarily need to refrigerate.**"

"The 2014 vintage has more barrel char and smokiness in the nose and taste, and a touch of white pepper, relative to my memory of previous Rye-on-Rye offerings. Not much alcohol heat or sweetness, as the high abv may suggest. To me, the 2013 rye-on-rye was the perfect adult candy, with more of the malty sweet and vanilla flavors of barrel aging. 2013 was much sweeter. I'm not sure which flavor profile I like better. This beer is incredible."
"Overall, this is a fantastic and pretty unique offering from Boulevard. Not many people are dabbling in Templeton barrel-aged rye beers. It's hard to compare to my other favorite rye beer, since this one is barrel aged and the other one is far more aggressively hopped, but it's probably safe to say that this one is pretty close to tied for best in style in my mind. I look forward to it's annual release every year."

"O: This is a very balanced beer. Of course the rye notes dominate the taste, but they are mellowed out nicely by caramel malt base with a healthy dose of hops. The alcohol content, while apparent, is well-hidden. It's a great sipper while curling up with a movie on Saturday night. That being said, there's nothing that stands out to me as remarkable about the beer. It's a great, inoffensive big beer."

"O: Extremely complex rye beer with lots of layers and flavors to pick out. A nice sipper for colder nights. Even though the 12% is well hidden, you can still tell that it's a big beer. Good value for the quality"

"O: Incredibly delicious and offers the rye whisky flavour and smoky wood that's soul satifying and comforting. Incredibly bold flavours that are perfect on every front. I'm not even a whisky lover, but this might change my mind."
"What a beer! Just plain awesome and so much character to entertain the senses."
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a deep copper color ale with a rather large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of spicy rye notes with some rye whiskey notes and some light grainy notes. Taste is a very drinkable mix of spicy rye malt with some dry rye whiskey notes that are well-balanced and rounded with a dry finish. Body is about average with good carbonation and surprisingly not apparent presence of alcohol. I still can believe how easy this one is to drink, well-balanced while retaining a good level of complexity."
""
"Despite the premature oxidation that has taken place, the beer was still pretty nice and quite drinkable for what it was. I'd really like to have another go at it, with a fresh bottle, as I'm sure it stands the chance to be even better. I'm not the biggest fan of rye beers, but this one was executed nicely, especially if you're a fan of whiskey and dryness."
""
""
" This beer pours a wonderful ruddy brown head that foams and foams, excellent head retention from my bottle. Wow you can smell the bourbon nose right off the bat, raisins, prunes, rye spiciness, clove, faint oak. The flavor is much the same with a forward rye spice followed by boozy bourbon notes and dried fruit sweetness, faint smokiness and a lingering oak finish. Only beef w this beer was the cloying thickness of it, but overall a very interesting and complex beer that tastes similar to an old ale with a healthy amount of rye thrown into the mix witch makes this a beer worthy of seeking out."

"2012 edition. Imagine ""Blonde on Blonde", only with brunettes...mmm... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear garnet topped by a finger of cream foam. The nose comprises prime whiskey, rich caramel, sweet biscuit, mild oak, vanilla bean, a touch of buttercream, light candied orange peel, and a bit of vague spicy flashes in the back. The taste brings in more of the same, the barrel and the malty sweetness interpenetrating each other beautifully on my tongue. From beneath bubbles an undertow of clove- and brown sugar-heavy spicy notes that compliment the proceedings quite well. The body is a stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a nigh-silky feel. Overall, a damn fine beer, one of the better melds of base and barrel I've yet encountered."

"Overall - An excellent rye beer with a unique spin by Boulevard. Phenomenal flavours with an excellent complexity. Really like the nice warming sensation."

"1600th review! Got in a trade with Cyde. 750 ml bottle into snifter; 2013 vintage bottled 3/2013. Pours moderately cloudy ruby red color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, raisin, orange zest, brown sugar, spicy rye, bourbon, vanilla, oak, toast, clove, floral, brown bread, and light spicy alcohol. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, raisin, brown sugar, orange zest, toast, toffee, rye, bourbon, oak, vanilla, clove, brown bread, floral, and toasted earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, raisin, brown sugar, toast, toffee, bourbon, oak, clove, vanilla, and toasted earthiness one the finish for a while. Fantastic balance and complexity of dark malts with a near perfect balance of barrel flavors; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy and slick mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic barrel aged strong ale! Fantastic balance and complexity of malt and barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for 12%. A highly enjoyable offering."

"The beer pours a dull, hazy orange/red amber with a thin halo of tan head, loose lacing, and plentiful sediment. The nose is buttery whiskey barrel aged caramel sweetness, slightly boozy, with a touch of rye. The taste is definitely whiskey barrel forward with a generous amount of rye spice in the finish. It's medium bodied, barleywine-esque, slightly spice, heavily barrel aged and boozy (but not as much as the BBQ). Wow, what a good beer that presents huge barrel aged sweetness along with excellent rye spice. It's more of an evening sipper at 11% and with huge rye spice, but very tasty and impressive. I'd certainly try this beer again."

"overall? yeah this was well worth hunting down on r/beertrade, and well worth waiting to drink. one of the best barrel aged beers i've had."
""
""
"O- Not necessarily complex since what you have is a rye beer aged on rye barrels but it's certainly drinkable and enjoyable if you're a rye fan like I am."
""
""
""
"A story of rye, for the rye and of the rye.Enormous head on beige body. Mild rye spice aroma. Above average body, Decent surprisingly smooth drinkability. The taste yields much barreling including vanilla and coconut, perhaps a result of maximum time recommended in bottle,just a drop of faint sour. Bottle from IP with Steve in Warren."
""

"Overall. Nice big rye beer that's smooth and tasty. Finishing this bottle won't be a problem even being as big as it is..."
""

"O-Was expecting a little more but still a very good beer. Maybe some more rye spiciness would have been nice."
"O- This is a great beer, especially considering the price. Definitely pick this one up if you come across it."
""
"Frankly I was confused for a while about the beer I actually got but soon enough the rye comes forth... maybe the only element that keeps the bitterness in check on a warm beer. I started to like it finally and it is certainly a well made beer. But I didn't really enjoy it."
""
""
""
""
"This is a really nice beer. The flavor isn't as intense as I would have expected and it's not overly complex. This beer is very drinkable for the ABV and has a nice solid flavor profile that shows off the immense rye character. This is a must try for all rye fans."
"Stellar brew done well in style! Big bottle of this asks you to invite a friend. Nice brew for the launchpad."
""
""
""
""
"The body is a dark brown hearth color, filled with lots of carbonation and topped off with a thick tan head that consists of creamy small bubbles and larger billowy bubbles in the center. The aroma is semi-dry, filled with wheat and mild malts and plenty a light fruits and banana bread. It is light on the tongue and crisp. It is very creamy and the caramel is very pleasant, there is a slight whiskey note in its aftertaste. Very complex, the more I sip on it the more flavors come out, mild fig and apple, toffee, butter are all mixed in very well. The body does seem to thicken up just a bit, the mouth feel after letting it warm up would be medium to full bodied."

"O - Mellowed way out, tons of toffee and carmel, no booze or heat detected."

"the taste is something like i've never had before. like i said before, this marriage was meant to be. to have a 12% brew be so classy and smooth with little to no sign of an alcoholic bite is beyond me. This is a must try for anyone and everyone."

"I have to commend Boulevard on making an aggressive, whiskey barrel enhanced beer where all the other desirable attributes are also readily apparent. Easily my favorite Smokestack Series beer. If you like rye and whiskey, this is your beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, certainly a memorable and genre-busting brew."
"Pours a hazy golden caramel with a huge thick, frothy cream colored head with nice lacing. Aroma offers a nice dose of sweet whiskey, sweet bread, a tease of some fruit, rye (which comes out after it warms some) and a little vanilla. Flavor is whiskey dominant and shows itself throughout the entire sip, it pairs with some bread and caramel,, some rye comes out as it warms offering some spiciness, and vanilla. Alcohol is present but works with the beer. A fuller, creamy mouthfeel. Not too much activity. Overall, highly enjoyable. I am quite hit and miss with Boulevard's oferrings but this one is a definitely a winner. A little more straightforward and less complex than I expected it to be going in, but quite enjoyable, nonentheless, and that is ultimately what matters."
""

"O - good beer, I wish it was more readily available. I look forward to drink it fresh."
""

"Tremendous, as always. Great job Boulevard!"

"Really fun and great beer from these guys, this one might be my favorite I've had from them so far."

"This is definitely a niche market beer. It came highly recommended by the shop owner and I was attracted by the high ABV and the whiskey barrel aging process. Obviously, it is not chugging beer. It is brewed to enjoy slowly in an easy chair along with good company and stimulating conversation. I have to say though, that I didn't enjoy it as I though I would. I can't blame the beer... it was exactly as advertised. But as it turned out, I just didn't like the blended tastes. In the future, when I want rye whiskey I will drink rye whiskey and when I crave a brew, I will have a beer. With that said, its a distinctive and unique tasting beer that is worth a try by true beer aficionados."
"O- A solid beer overall, has a really nice aroma but is a bit less rich and delicious in the flavor, consider skipping this."

"damn this is a big beer. pours hazy golden brown like when the tater tots are perfectly ready, with a caramel hue and a fluffy tan head as tall as you want to make it. yum. it smells like rye malt, spicy and peppery and rich, and it also smells like oak casks, with some char and some strong whiskey notes of vanilla. the flavor is about the same, not as rye malt heavy as I thought from the nose, but still undoubtedly a rye forward brew. I think the barreling process is a little overdone in this one. I never really say that, but this one tasted more like whiskey than beer, especially in the finish, and it really overshadowed what I assume to be an expertly made strong rye ale. maybe just the blend was too much, I don't know, but it was an experience either way, with the alcohol becoming punishing in the finish and as I worked my way through a bottle of this on my own. full full body, good carbonation and a very expansive feel. lots of booze burn in the finish, and at least a mild hangover awaits the overeager, but like all beers in the smokestack series, this was well planned, well executed, and very original."

"Overall: A really great barrel aged rye beer. Big rye and barrel flavor and the sweetness and heat is kept in check. Really well done."

"O: a best friend of mine said that this is like an English Barleywine, and I must admit that his statement is very true. Immense complexity, and it has a terrific balance. For being 12%, it is one of the best balanced brews I have had. This will be one that I consistently seek out. A well done brew."

"EPIC! I never rate beers because I feel they are a personal choice. This one was on another level! Seriously I've had all of the top 5 or more and this one is the best! Thanks Boulevard for doing such a good job with this beer and please, PLEASE, make more for me to imbibe."

"An interesting rye theme here. It has a much different profile than the typical rye-P-A that seems to be gaining popularity. The rye whisky really steals the show. I've not previously considered aging a rye beer but I this would be a good candidate."
""
""
""
"The impression I get from this beer is that if I was blindfolded I would think it was a barleywine. It's not super hoppy. It's not super malty but it has many nice flavors and lots of boozy warmth. Looking at the label shows 12%. This is definitely the strongest rye beer and a different rye beer since most of them have leaned toward hoppy IPAs. I like this unique beer and it is definitely a keeper. Top shelf all the way."

"I am currently reviewing the 2013 vintage of this in 2012 (very soon to be 2013). So in other words, this beer is from the future. Pours a murky brownish, tawny color with white head and plenty of lacing. Nose is full of caramel, rye, vanilla, and oak. The rye spirit lends a somewhat sweet quality to the nose which is quite nice. The taste starts with tons of rye malt, a bit of toast, light fruit character in the vain of cherry with a considerable spirit character towards the end. The barrel quality is nice and smooth and rounds out the rye malt nicely. A bit of heat creeps up on the end. Body is hefty, but not a big as I'd expect from an 11% brew. Carbonation is a tad high for my preference with barrel aged brews. Overall, a very solid offering from Boulevard that showcases rye in an amazing way."
""
""
"Oh my... Can you mess any beer up by aging it in whiskey barrels? I digress... this beer is awesome... please do not drink this cold; let it sit out for a good hour before you pour, then the flavors really come out. in my opinion, it's kind of a cross between a wit and a farmhouse ale with added oak and lots of whiskey flavor. There is also a bit of funk in there that makes it unique. You could pound this beer if you wanted to... no sipping desert wine. This is arguably my favorite beer this year, since they killed the production of Bourbon Barrel Quad this year."
""
""
""
"O - A rather unique beer. Reminds me of a peatier Backwoods Bastard. Quite tasty and a good representation of rye and its spice, however it is a bit one dimensional and cloying."

"My least favorite part of the beer. Has a medium mouthfeel with a too much carbonation. Feels a bit thin overall, but also is exceedingly drinkable for how much booze there is. Unless you really like whiskey this may not be the beer for you. It is truly a whiskey lovers beer, not just a barreled aged beer. Cheers!"
"Overall: Enjoyed more than any of the silly $25+ beers that I've paid for. will spend the rest of my life figuring out how to brew this. Buy it, age it, enjoy it."

"Poured a murky brown, with a cream head. Nice lacing and moderate retention. Nose of caramel, rye bread, light whiskey barrel notes, spice and some rich apple pie filling. Tastes of rye, caramel, whiskey barrel is quite prominent, bready and sweet malt with some whiskey heat on the back end. Full feel, good density and medium carbonation. A definite sipper."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: An interesting complex beer to say the least. There is so much going on that each sip elicits a different reaction from me. Sweet but spicy and the barrel is done to perfection in this beer. A sipper but one I can't stop sipping! I'm glad I bought two of these because this is one hell of an enjoyable beer."
"Cheers!"
"Cheers and enjoy--Nastic"
"Pours a brown color with a big 2 finger head that retains very well. Smell is sweet with raisins and plums. Some malts and spices are also present. Good smelling, similar to a quad. Taste is pretty alcoholic with loads of caramel and spices. Not much sweetness to the quaff. Dry finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and pretty alcoholic. Overall this has a good, complex flavor. I think it could sit a little longer to mellow out some of the alcohol."

"D: An epic example of barrel aged brew. A must-have if you're in to this sort of thing, but probably quite overpowering if you're not. Finishing this bottle is going to screw me up in all sorts of nice ways. I usually gotta drink wine in order to get this kind of buzz from a single bottle. Gets the job done with class and style. I almost want to make a Manhattan with it."

"A big thanks to cploking for coming through with this beer. Poured from a brown 25.4 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy crimson color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of whiskey, a bit of oak. Taste is strong of whiskey and alcohol, a faint rye presence, a bit of oak. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall if you are into whiskey barrel beers, this would be in your wheelhouse. For me it was just a bit overpowering."

"750ml bottle shared by jdiddy. #20,513 indicated on the label. Pours a dully, hazy amber hue with a loose, off-white head that quickly dissipates into a soapy skim. Nose is floral, perfumey and sweet with some definite rye notes. Taste is really quite good - buttery and woody with some rye and caramel notes. Definitely let this beer to warm a little to allow it to open up. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with a coarse carbonation and some acidity. Overall, I really like this beer. It's still a bit hot, but I see a lot of potential in this beer with an additional two years in the cellar to dissipate the heat and carbonation."

"O:  Jack and coke anyone?  This reminds me of high school when I used to mix whiskey with cherry coke.  Despite the hearty dose of booze this is really quite good. It has much better character and complexity that a mixed beverage. The drinkability is really grand considering the ABV and the encombesment of alcohol. I would like to age one and see how it develops. "

"O - Overall I guess I wasnt expecting this to be quite as boozy as it was, nor was I expecting all the floaties."

"Overall, a unique beer. Unlike most barrel-aged beers (imperial stouts and barleywines), the malt profile here lets the whiskey flavor dominate. This beer tastes more like a straight-up glass of whiskey than any other beer I've had. Should have poured into a shot glass."

"The beer pours a hazy mahogany color with a tan head. The aroma is strong rye with some oak notes and dark fruit. The flavor is very nice with rye, cherries, vanilla, oak and a strong, spicy hops and rye finish. The alcohol is fairly noticeable. Medium mouth feel and medium carbonation. Tastes better than the smell. But a solid brew."

"Overall, this is a wonderful Ryewine. Probably the best Ryewine in the world. The barrel aging here is marvelously done. All of the flavor of whiskey with little of the harshness. Seek this beer out."
""
"Wonderful. A winner."
""
""
"Fuller medium body, well carbonated, sticky and full on the tongue with lingering tendencies. This is one hell of a rye beer - I'm already a pretty big fan of the style but barrel aging it definitely adds a whole new dimension."
"Aging this one; got three more and I think it's only going to get (amazingly) better."
""
""
"This is a pretty nice brew. The alcohol is unnoticeable. The whiskey malt sweetness is pleasant."
""

"Overall, this is quite delicious fare, and it seems a very wise choice on Boulevard’s part to do a 67% rye whiskey barrel-aged/33% ale mix, as this option provides the beer with both a full, round, flavorful sugary malt base, as well as a nice whiskey overtone that plays off of the other flavors, rather than dominating them (as can happen with 100% barrel-aged beers). The heavy 11% ABV is noticeable throughout the entire mouthful, marking one of the beer’s few weaknesses, but even here that sensation mostly blends well, reminding of the beer’s origins. Very much worth trying."
"2012 Vintage. Pours a crimson reddish brown color with a medium off-white head that disappears quickly. Scent is rye whiskey up front with a slight cherry aroma. Some oak with smooth vanilla and a hint of toffee. As the beer warms a bit, the rye really comes through nicely. Taste is sweet rye spiciness at first. Some woodiness with a ton of vanilla. Rye whiskey on the back of the tongue with a surprisingly light burn for such high ABV. Mouthfeel is a little on the lighter side...should have more body to it. A tad bit watery. Drinkability is fairly high. Overall, this is a damn tasty beer. Just wish it had more body."
""
""

"Pretty amazing beer. The rye is integrated nicely and adds a pleasant flavor without being overpoweringly boozy."
""
""
""
""
"This drinks much like a smooth rye whiskey cocktail, say rye with vanilla cola, but much smoother, deeper, fuller, substantial and more balanced. This is a fine whiskey barrel aged brew. Boulevard brews a line of generally excellent beers and Templeton Rye is an excellent whiskey; the two merge together nicely."

"750 ml caged and corked bottle, bottle #16855, batch 2012-2, best by 02-2014. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a murky ruby red/brown color with about an inch tan head that stays around for a very long time. There's a small amount of lacing. Aroma is sweet and malty, the brew smells like dark fruit, caramel, brown sugar, whiskey, vanilla, and a bit of apple. It tastes like oak, rye whiskey, dark fruit, vanilla, caramel, and some orange marmalade. Nice mix between the sweet and spicy rye flavors in this beer. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's creamy and smooth. The carbonation is soft which helps make this easy to drink. I think this is a very good overall brew, I'd buy it again. $13.99 a bottle."
"(D)- A nice rye beer with rich, but balanced flavors and feel."
""
""
""
"The aroma is very nice with fruit, wood, whiskey, and vanilla. It is dominated by a bold whiskey barrel flaovr. The rye is there but it's hard to detect at times. The flavor reminds me of a sweet Jack n Coke. I guess it would be nice to drink by the fireplace on a cold winters night."
"Pours a slightly hazy brown with a a beige head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, dark fruit, whisky, and wood. Taste is of malt, dark fruits, slight rye, and a woody whisky kick on the finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but I think this one smells better than it tastes."
""
""
"At $14 for a 750ml bottle of barrel aged beer, it's not a terrible value, but I think your money would be better spent on any of the numerous superior barrel aged beers on the market today. I wouldn't buy this again, but I'd happily accept it as a gift."

"Overall, this is a great rye beer that does well to showcase the grain alongside a barrel treatment. Definitely worth seeking out and trying."

""
"O: A fantastic, complex beer. So many flavors. The alcohol heat is notable but complements the whiskey flavor. Might want to age another one to take some of the heat off."
"The feel is a little harsh with slightly sharp carbonation and a medium body. Overall this one is very enjoyable. Wouldn't mind having this once in a while."
"This is a big slow sipper, with soft creamy carbonation. This is a great barrel aged brew at an affordable price (relatively speaking)."
""
"Poured into a Black Raven pint glass. Pours a medium to dark red amber with ruby tones. Fine light tan head that slowly dissipated to a film and ring, leaving lacing. Light but delicious aroma of rye whisky, wood and dark malt. Wow, this is a great first taste. Complex flavor of whisky, wood, vanila, dark fruit and malt. The rye sourness appears fleetingly to keep things interesting. Finishes rich with the rye element coming out more, but combined with oaky wood and fruit. Only medium bodied, but still have a very nice creaminess and mouth feel. This is an outstanding beer. I wish it wasn't so high ABV because I had to force myself to pace this tasty rye. An exceptional beer and one I will buy every year."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy, and certainly full bodied. Overall, a bold and tasty treat with a nice deviation from the usual bourbon-stout combo."
""
"Overall Impression- A very rich one from Boulevard! Enjoyed every last sip and will be enjoying my bottle of this very shortly. I suggest enjoying this on-tap and wouldn't tell you not to grab one of the last bottles available."
""
"A good beer, though the boozy, oak is a bit much at times."
"I was a bit disappointed in this one. Not bad, but a bit over the top of spices. Barrel flavors are a bit on the lighter side."
"O: I didn't think this beer was all that good at the start, but towards the end of the glass I'm really enjoying it. It's hot, but there is something with the tart cherry/sour raisin that is keeping me with this beer. It's not my favorite Boulevard brew, but it's still darn good."
"O: Rye-on-Rye is more booze than everything. Imagine an old ale with a shot of whiskey and you’ve got this explosive brew; it’s intensely flavorful and alcoholic. It isn’t my favorite style, but it definitely satisfies."
""
""
"This beer was great. If you enjoy whiskey, especially rye this beer is for you. It was the initial punch of a sip of rye but then mellows in your pallet to what I would describe as being as close to rye as possible but still maintaining its beer roots."
""
""
""
""
"Very smooth mouthfeel and way too drinkable for the high abv. Might be the best Boulevard beer I've ever had. Highly recommend."
""
"D - I definitely prefer the nose here. The front end of the drink is particularly weak and I'd prefer a bit more barrel presence overall, particularly some sweetness to balance everything else. Worth a visit but don't expect an overwhelming success."
"O: As the beer warmed it got progressively sweeter and more complex. This does need some time to mellow out as the barrel is really taking over the base beer and you lose out one some of the fine qualities of the rye beer itself. Overall though, this was a nice beer and I will give the one I have in the cellar a solid year to see how it develops."
""
"Overall: Amazing. Maybe the best from Boulevard that I have had and certainly one to revisit. I love the oaking in here especially the way it combines with the caramel malt. My only complaint is I wish the rye was more pronounced. That said, as long as I do not expect to get a rye bomb, this is phenomenal."
""
""
"Mellow and smooth, this has some sweet notes of toffee and butterscotch, a little leather, some orange marmalade and no significant hop flavors to speak of. There is a little spice at the end as it finishes and a moderate hop bitterness. The rye whiskey characteristics become more notable as it warms. Give it some time and it will open and transform into a beer sharing some “quad-like” characteristics, with dark stone fruits, like dates and figs and plums, coming through flavor-wise. A lighter bodied beer than I was expecting. While it clocks in at 11% the alcohol isn’t a key player. My second glass had far more spice and some bittering, possibly a result of it warming up and opening even more. This was enjoyable and a fun bottle to share as it kept evolving."
"I’ll have another."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a light to moderate carbonation- alcohol warming and burn is a big part of this brew as it seems to be brewed to taste like rye whiskey. They did exceptionally well. Get this beer if you like whiskey!"
"Overall quite good, again similar to Ry(e)an ale but a bit bigger, boozier, but not quite as good. The barrel really comes through with some barrel char, vanilla, and plenty of whisky flavors, and if it had a bit of bourbon that really would have put it over the top. Nice malts, caramel, hint of cocoa, nice spicy rye, candied stone fruits, and bit of juicy malts add a nice complex flavor. The booze is a bit much, but whats to be expected for 11%, and a bit of bitterness more from the rye and char than hops, but tasty. A great tasting beer, but hard to finish an entire 750ml bottle by myself."
""
"Overall, I'd choose the Rye Wyne over this one 9 time out of ten. This one is more approachable though which is nice."
""
""
"Dark amber with a off-white three finger head that dissipates fairly quickly after a very firm pour. Initial aroma of whiskey, slight undertones of wood, and hints of spicyness from the rye. Very complex taste rye spicyness combined with sweet malt, light accents of charred wood, ripe fruit, and booze. Heavy-medium to light-full bodied with a creamy, smooth mouthfeel. Really exceptional brew that is really unique. Definitely one to try if you haven't."
""
""
""
"Pretty girl drank this with me and we enjoyed it. Worth seeking out for any rye beer or whiskey barrel fan. Another Boulevard Smokestack success."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being moderate for the style. Overall it was a pretty good beer, the oak dominated a little but the caramel and bourbon notes that came out were really good. It felt pretty close to being great, but didn't quite get there."
""
""
""
""
"I like the flavorful and mellow bourbon but the base beer doesn't seem to bring much to the table. Still it definitely pulls of a nice unique combo of a rye beer/rye whiskey, it's enjoyable."
"One of the best rye beers I've encountered in a while. Good balance between the grains, hops not overly assertive in the aroma but coming through well in the bittering department. An excellent rye quaff!"
""
"O: I found this beer not only to be great, but also brave. I hope other breweries begin aging non-traditional beers like this one."
""
""
"This beer pours a medium bodied cherry wood brown with a one finger soapy and creamy two finger head. Te nose features smooth and spicy rice with a touch of rye whiskey. I expected it to be a little more pronounced. You could say that the aromas are holding back a bit. The flavors are nice and malty. There is plenty of spicy rye with a nice about of rye whiskey, some caramel, and some toffee with a slightly soapy finish. The flavors are nice. I like how the rye base works with the whiskey. They complement each other well. If anything there could be more whiskey presence. Luckily it builds as it warms but even then there could be more. It drinks medium in body and not necessarily over carbonated but it instantly stimulates your entire palate in an effervescent type of manner. Overall this is a nice beer. I definitely prefer it to their bourbon barrel aged imperial stout. This is yet another high quality beer from the Smokestack series."

"Beer number 4 of the Astros #brewandbaseball challenge! I'm behind but doing my best to catch up. Poured from bottle into CBS Snifter. Pours a nearly transparent dark amber color, some decent head retention, which is surprising given the ABV and Barrel aging. A creamy looking texture to this beer. Smell- booze, molasses, some spicy bready notes from the rye. Woody barrel notes, some vanilla. Alcohol is obvious. This will be a really boozy bastard. Taste- the booze is puckering. its pretty much all I am getting at the front of the tongue, resembles straight rye whiskey. Some nice woody notes and vanilla linger around the sides of my mouth, but I struggle to get a lot of depth and complexity to this one. After the booze, it seems that the flavors are a little muddled. Nothing stands out, but this is a beer that will have to develop in order to be worthy. I'll review again after a year and see what comes of it, but would not recommend to drink it fresh. Not a great experience, not a horrible one."
""
""
""
""
""
"I can see why anyone argues it's not appealing. You have to like whiskey to like this beer. Definitely a burn and booze flavor involved. But for me it works, I like it a lot."
"O - This is easily my favorite beer of the year because of its amazingness and that it promises exactly what it provides. 5's across the board."
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip. Pours a reddish brown with a creamy off white head, very little lacing. Smell is vanilla, Oak, Bourbon, carmel, and leather. Taste is all of those things, vanilla and bourbon dominate, pretty mild considering what it is. Body is a little thin, plenty of carbonation, not overly dry, and very easy drinking. This solid not really familiar with the style."
""
"Had this in a snifter at Beer Kitchen. Not very much head. A thick dark brown looking brew. Smell is sweet, malty, and rye. Upfront the taste is strong rye. Extremely bready, thick, syrupy, not much carbonation. The taste is also sweet cherries and caramel malts. The 11 percent alcohol is well hidden. If you like big semi-sweet beers and rye bread on your sandwiches you'll like it."
""

"Love, Chad"
"Overall – A very impressive beer, a good representation of the Smokestack series and my hometown brewery. Boulevard strikes it big with this one. If I was going to send one of the Smokestacks to someone, I would likely send this one over all others. Highly recommended. Drink this with whatever or whenever you would normally think of drinking bourbon, except this is much better."
""
""
""
"What an AMAZING beer. I could drink this all day. (Technically I did). :-) I really wish this was a full time brew from Boulevard. Awesome stuff. I ordered a second round, then went back later in the day to order a 3rd and 4th. Seriously, awesome beer."
""
"Clear amber, nearly brown, thin head of white foam. Tons of oak with vanilla, burnt toast, and dark cacao coming forward. Caramel and toffee malt run deep. Smooth hop bitters with some biting tannins at the end. Not nearly as complex or rye-forward as the bottled version, but a really nice beer nonetheless."
""
"O/D-This is a really cool beer. There is so much going on within this beer. It boasts one of the most memorable finishes I have experienced in a beer. Perhaps the best component of this beer is that it isn't too intense but has more than enough flavor in every sip. Very unique and very interesting."
"Yep, another Smokestack success that I love. No surprise. Everything here is very balanced and complimentary to other components. I love it and highly recommended."
""
"Overall: Once again, this is like a Manhattan in beer form. Unique, utterly delicious and dangerously sippable."

"O: Well, definitely a beer for rye lovers, whether it be the spice or the whiskey (or both). Feels lighter and more bubbly than you'd expect for such a big beer. Definitely boozy though. It's pretty good but I'm gonna have to sit on some to see if it mellows out a bit."

"O - Awesome first impression of Rye on Rye! Great brew! Highly recommended, i'll be anxious to see where this one goes with a bit of time. Huge and enjoyable!"
"This beer pours a murky amber color. The head is an inch of solid off white foam that recedes very slowly into a firm cap of lacing that sticks to the sides of the glass. The aroma is of caramel, rye whiskey, oak, and rye bread. All of the elements of the aroma are well balanced, and play nicely with each other. The taste is of maltier than the aroma with more caramel, and rye bread character. There are still a significant oak and whiskey notes, but they are more in the background. There is also a noticeable alcohol presence in the finish that distracts from the rest of the beer. The mouthfeel is full bodied with moderate carbonation, and a cloying texture that I dislike in beer. Overall, this is a good beer that I would drink again, but I can't see myself searching for it."
"Overall, this is an excellent example of what a rye barrel can do to a beer. Fantastic."
""
""
"Pretty much what one would expect with rye beer and rye whiskey. A nice oak presence and the rye whiskey and malt add spicy pepper, coriander and raisin hints. Balances out pretty nicely."
"Boulevard doesn't make a bad beer (especially their smokestack series stuff). Love the drinkablity for 11%. Would have classified it as a american strong ale, rather than rye, but it doesn't matter either way. Seek it out."
""

"Extremely flavorful and pleasant to drink. Wouldn't know it was 11% if I wasn't familiar with it. Looking forward to my bottle."

"Medium bodied with average carbonation. The alcohol is well hidden for an 11.00 % abv beer. One of the best tasting Rye beers I have had since SurlyFest."
""
"Not enjoying this at all, a big mess."
"O- If I were a whiskey guy this would be exceptional. But I find some of the flavors overwhelming.... A sipper for sure."
"An amber colored brew with sudsy sand colored foam and fair lacing. Whiskey and spice coming out and filling the nose. Tastes of two main components, peppery spice and hot whiskey. Pretty minimal malt sweetness and there is some oak presence there, but the spice and whiskey are so prevalent. A little age would help this to settle some, but overall, this fresh one is ever so tasty. A very nice example of a barrel aged brew. Will grab some more of this one."
"overall: great stuff - as expected from the smokestack series"
"I picked this beer up outta town, as we havent got it in yet, been a big boulevard fan, but this is by far my favorite! Go get ya some!!!!"
"This rye beer leans away from the hops and has more of a barleywine taste. In my opinion this is the best beer Boulevard has made so far. You will never have a rye beer quite like it."

"Overall this is a superb beer. Really a great showcase for Rye malts and rye whiskey barrel-aging. It is basically a barrel-aged Rye Barleywine (per say), so if you like Barley Wines and Rye beers and Barrel-aged beers, this is HIGHLY recommended. My one complaint it that the rye whiskey alcohol is a little dominant for my tastes and slightly overpowers the rest of the flavor profile but regardless it is still quite good. Would be better to share a monster like this because to indulge by yourself could be a task. Can't wait til this is going to be released again (early 2012) because I will be buying several."
"D= Though this was a deliciously complex beer, I was hard pressed to finish the bottle by myself. Just a lot of flavor going on here...."
"This bottle became kind of a joke at our regular tastings. Ottovon would bring it along, we would always go for other stuff first and get too drunk or fatigued, and the bottle would sit lonely in the fridge. But the mockery was undeserved — this is a damn good beer displaying a complex, spicy flavor."
"Some vanilla in the flavor, but that's quickly beaten down mercilessly by the malt, spice and charred wood-caramel. Fruits bounce around as does some grassiness. I'd have to say this is a unique beer with rye coming at you from two directions, dodging the hops and yeast along the way. The wood gives in a smoothness that tames (a bit) the alcohol. Very nice"
"A says she is high on the rye."
"750ml bottle poured into a Great Lakes snifter. Pours a medium brown that is a little murky capped with a bit of light tan head that dissipates rather quickly. Smells very strong of rye and booze with hints of barrel. Some sweet malt and a bit of bourbon. Not overly boozy, but it is there. Taste is rather sweet, but kinda dry at the same time. Lots of rye in both malt and barrel form. I have a bit of a love/hate with this beer. Certain sips are fantastic while others are less than stellar. Mouthfeel is full, but a little more carbonation would help and this feels a little flat. Decent beer."
"Rye-on-Rye is a really clever beer and it's far more tempered and accordant than a lot of bourbon barrel offerings. The trade off between rye beer and rye barrel happens like the shuffle of angel’s feet - it's seamless and blissful. There's no clashing, the two parties hit things off like bread and butter. Another highly recommendable Boulevard offering."
"Pours a cloudy brown- rust colored but topped with a nice off-white head. Good retention and decent lace. I detect some apple, rye, earth, wood, and a touch of booze in the nose. Once the beer hits my tongue I get some very unique tastes. Apple juice, whiskey, and wood- strange but in a very good way... not at all off-putting. Full body and a little light in the carbonation but still good. This was tasty but one glass is plenty."
"Cheers!"
"overall another winner, and i am starting to think they really cannot or so not go wrong."
"Picked up a bottle to try, it definitely has a nice tangy, spicy rye kick to it along with some barrel-aged flavors. However, it seemed a little oxidized despite the cork being a monster to remove. Worth a try and glad to see Boulevard doing more than cranking out the unfiltered wheat by the truckload."
"Wow, pretty epic ... an amazing twist on the barrel aged beer movement which is nearly commonplace in the craft beer world. Very happy to run into this bottle."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, this is a decent beer to sip on for a long time, especially if you what something a little different."
"The 66% barrel-aging was definitely for the purpose of balance as the rye whiskey hits the back of your throat, but in a very subdued fashion. The rye flavor from the beer/barrel kinda of sits in your mouth. There is a bit of fruitiness that I would have guessed was from the yeast, but the bottle tells me is from citrus hops. This is really smooth and I really, seriously cannot believe this is 11%. To me, this has a nice, creamy body, the flavor of rye as advertised, mixed with a bit of citrus and oak, well hidden booze, big carb and that's about it. ...and what more could ask for? It's crazy drinkable. The only thing holding it back is that it is not assertive, but for some I think that is a positive. I am actually pretty surprised at how good this is."
"Heavy stuff, not entirely appreciated by me, probably my least favorite from the smokestack series."
"Overall the flavor profile wasn't quite balanced enough to take this beer to the next level, but it is a very interesting beer and those who love rye will certainly want to seek this one. Worth a shot."
"Thanks to cobeerbuff for this one, poured from a bomber into snifters. It pours a deep amber with a medium white head, light lacing. The aroma is sweet booze, oak, vanilla. The flavor is sweet, spicy rye, oak, and vanilla. It finishes with some sweet alcohol. The body and carbonation is medium. A great beer, very easy drinking for a BA beer."
"Drink- It's big, not as boozy as I thought it would be but hit me hard after drinking it. I loved it though. The whole smokestack series has been awesome!"
"I had too many bad experiences with JB to enjoy this but grateful to at least try it. To those that can hang with this beer....more power to them! Boulevard nailed this beer!!! Anyone thinking session beer would absolutely get their A$$ kicked!"
"D: really interesting brew, has a lot going on, especially the nose. i like the rye emphasis. i think it's still improving. a little sad that i only have one bottle left."
"Mouth: Slow start, somewhat tart and dry up front. As it moves back it opens into an interesting mix of malty sweetness and whiskey warmth. Creamy, well carbonated mouthfeel. Finish shows hop character, bitterness from somewhere (maybe tannins?), and more toasty flavors of (oak) wood. Lingering warm finish coats the throat, killing any cold or flu germs that might be lingering there. This'd be the best ""sore throat"" medicine ever."
"Sweet, bready, and almost fruity nose, the Templeton Rye is immediately recognizable, soft aroma of brown sugar and toffee sweetness. The rye beer provides the rich bready component, and the barrel offers a mellow vanilla sweetness with traces of honey, citrus, and dry woodiness in the aftertaste. Rich and full bodied, soft and supple feel, but not boozy. Medium level of carbonation. Rye spirit flavor is very present, but with minimal associated heat. Great symbiosis between the barrel and the beer. This bottle was cellared for around 3-4 months."
"D: Better as you go and surprisingly drinkable at 11%."
"This beer has been added to my Wants. I sure hop that they make it again!"
"D: More. I love this beer. Their smokestack series does nothing but impress. It is a toss up between this and old habit. Damn close. If you like rye beer this is a must."
"The palate is massively art and tangy in a woodsy, boozy, leathery way. The rye brings a sharp spiciness, alcohol is balanced but this is an aggressively flavored beer. Excellent!"
"Very good sipping and sharing beer."
"Very chewy beer. Silky smooth low carbonation. The mouthfeel is spot on. Awesome beer just a tad hot right now I'd say sit on this bad boy for a year or two, and it'd be a prize in anyone's cellar."
"D: Excellent drinkability especially given the ABV. Not quite up to the 2010 vintage, but still solid. (4.25)"
"D: I certainly couldn't have too much of this stuff, and I am almost willing to say that this belongs in a class of hard liquor, rather than beer. Still, this is a wonderful seasonal and very different from anything else we had at our tasting."
"D: A few ounces is plenty. This would be a nice after dinner drink."
"Drinkability:This is a very tasty beer, lots of complex flavors, a great sipper."
"Drinkability - not high. It is delicious, but the 11% is definitely there."
"D: Tasty, interesting, and about as drinkable as 11% can get."
"Beer is medium to full in body with a creamy mouthfeel. There is a lot of sweetness up front but its not cloying. It finishes a little dry but overall the syrupy flavors in the front are good and it gives way to this nice whiskey flavor in the middle. Its a great barrel aged beer and I would definitely have it again."
"D - Tastes great. Pairs phenomenally with West Indian food."
"Overall, a solid beer. Definitely some great rye flavor and aroma, and I love the name. I couldn't drink a lot of this, but glad I had the opportunity."
"Alas, it makes this one no more than a sipper. Ideally, it would be great to split a 750ml with a friend. But tonight I drink alone. With no body else."
"Notes: Perhaps the best of the 3 Rye on Rye beers I've had (this one, Smuttynose Ry(e)an, and Lenny Bruce RIPA on Rye). The whiskey influence is good, but I'm starting thing that you cannot successfully integrate rye whiskey into a rye-based ale. Just doesn't meld well. Glad to have tried it though."
"Great balance to this beer. Neither the rye or bourbon is overbearing but still contribute greatly to the complexity of the beer. Not to mention the beer drinks more like 9%, not 11%."
"Taste is rye whisky, sweet malty booziness. Very sharp an crisp with a light fresh mouthfeel. It's a really solid and drinkable beer for rye lovers."
"D- This beer is limited to a bottle and that's it. I like it a lot and would love to see how this one ages..which I assume would be pretty well."
"D: This is one smooth and easy drinking beer. The whiskey and the beer blend seamlessly and make for a really nice experience."
"D - Very drinkable for what it is, it's got a fantastic flavor and aroma! An awesome rye brew from Boulevard, it might be one of my more favorite rye beers."
"D: Something just not right all around here. Usually a fan of Boulevard's bigger beers, but can't get into this one."
"D: Overall a fantastic rye beer. I could easily finish a whole bottle myself. Thanks again Matt."
"flavor profile, which is one of my few minor gripes. Otherwise an excellent beer that I would buy again tommarrow if I could."
"EDIT: Very drinkable."
"Average-plus drinkability. A very solid beer overall, but not one of the better ones that have come out of a rye whiskey barrel."
"D: I thought I was a little goofy, opening this bottle on a 90 degree summer day, but it actually was refreshing. I couldn't justify doing it all in one sitting, going to save the second half for after dinner."
"Drinkability: I both really enjoyed this beer and thought it could have been a little more. First, the specifics. This beer is, process-wise, pretty near perfect. The appearance is nice, above average for barrel aged beers of any variety, and the mouthfeel is great for the flavor profile presented here (as well as objectively and independently). The taste and aroma fall a little short, I think, though I'm not sure why - even when fully developed and near room temperature, it seems to fall a little flat. Now, relatively speaking within the broader spectrum of Boulevard beers (perhaps an unfair point of comparison), this beer is perhaps at even more of a disadvantage - their BBQ and Imperial Stout were both a little better than this one, and most of their Smokestack Series has been uniformly outstanding. Don't get me wrong, this is a really good brew - it's just not a great brew. Still worth a try (not that there are any left on the shelf now). Grab it if you get a chance, just don't expect it to be a Saison Brett or a BBQ."
"I would definitely drink this again if given the chance - probably the tastiest beer I've ever had from Boulevard."
"D. Drinkable. Goes down fairly easy for such a big beer. Smell is very boozy, but the taste is already smooth and well balanced. Another winner from the Smokestack Series. *With a year on this beer, it becomes something else. The booziness fades away and leaves a very delicous complex beer*"
"d - A nice rye beer, but definitely some heat to it. Would try again with some more time on it."
"Very nice. Full of toffee and caramel, dates and fig and a touch of prune. Vanilla oak, with woody tannins on the finish. Thick and creamy with good moderate carbonation levels. A bit of earthy hops and spicey characters on the finish from the rye. Nice alcohol burn in the chest. But overall a very tasty friendly beer."
"D: For what this is, it has a decent drinkability, but this is one you must share--sweetness and whiskey gets a bit wearing"
"A very different beer that exhibits a wonderful use of Rye and barrel aging. Interesting and worth a shot."
"D: drinkable and very good but only in smaller amounts due to ABV, perfect for a winter night"
"D: I really had to think of this as a beer and a whiskey as I was drinking it. This is the only barrel-aged beer that I've found myself considering this way. That alone is enough to consider this a success."
"D: For what this is (a wine substitute), this was excellent. The bottle was split over dinner and disappeared way to quick. Both my wife and I enjoy rye beers and the addition of the whiskey barrel aging was a very nice compliment to a solid base beer. While a little on the spendy side ($13.49), this will be a regular as long as it's available locally."
"Pours a clear, dark amber color. One inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and poor lacing. Smells of whiskey, alcohol, wood, sweet malt, and slight hops. Fits the style of rye beer. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of whiskey, alcohol, wood, hint of hops, and hint of dark citrus. Overall, very strong whiskey/wood flavors."
"The taste is a bit bolder, showcasing both the caramel sweetness of the barrel and the spiciness of the rye malt. There's also caramel malt, black pepper, tannic oak. Medium-bodied, very spicy around the mid-palate with a mildly hot and peppery finish. I love the concept of this beer and had high expectations, and while it is good, the flavors and especially the aromas are somewhat muted for such a high gravity barrel-aged beer."
"Pours a nice, clear, medium-amber color, capped off with a huge, rocky light brown head. Aromas of freshly cut wood, vanilla, spicy rye and booze. Fairly boozy on the palate, with rye whiskey, brown sugar and some late hoppiness. As I mentioned, this one is pretty hot, but also quite good. I'm really enjoying these new rye barrel aged rye beers."
"Thanks again BlueOkie- I owe you!"
"Considering the intensity of the beer, drinkability is is good. It's a sipper for sure, but well worth investing the time it requires. Every time I've had a Boulevard beer I really wish they distributed to Ohio; this is no different."
"T- Nice vanilla, oak, light whiskey, fruity hops. A big dose of sour rye that gives it a bite."
"I started this guy in a balloon glass at about 55deg, and let it sit as I drank...took me about an hour and a half to fully enjoy this beer, and was therefore finishing it a room temperature. Quite a journey of a beer."
"Careful when pouring or you'll get a head of three plus fingers, loosely knit tan brown color, medium-sized bubbles, looks very frothy, average stickiness to the lacing takes some time to settle close to the surface. Very hazy orange-brown color, like muddy water, fully opaque, no change in hue further from the core. In the nose the oak comes through loud and clear, vanilla, buttered toast and caramel, definitely on the boozy side, banana and bubblegum as well as poached apricot and peach scents, the rye component softer than expected, lowering the overall breadiness, as it warms more mixed citrus comes out. Full-bodied and a real mouth filler, the carbonation ensures every pore covered cheek to cheek. Sweet without turning dulcet, caramel, butterscotch, vanilla fudge and carob, the raw whiskey flavors doesn't choose sides, dry in that heady, boozy fashion. The rye much stronger here, cuts the sweetness and lends a bitter burst. The orange citrus juicy and sweet, same for the concentrated apricot, peach, cherry, banana fruit flavors. Earthy in a fecund, herbaceous manner. This is a road grader of a beer so be forewarned."
"Bottle#7296 of 12148."
"Served at cellar temp. Pours a clear chestnut color with a large cream colored head that had good retention. Heavy lacing is left on the glass. A lot of whiskey in the aroma. Hints of vanilla, leather, and toffee. Not really much of a beer aroma. Very boozy in flavor. Definately get the rye whiskey flavor but not much from the rye beer. Also hints of vanilla and toffee. Just a touch of sweetness in the finish that gives a clue to the base beer before it was barrel aged. Not a bad tasting beer, actually enjoyable if you enjoy rye whiskey, but it seems the barrel aging got away from them or they should of adjusted the blend a little. The body feels full and creamy. Nice for a big, boozy beer. As a rye beer this is not the best example. But as a barrel aged beer, whiskey fans will find this quite enjoyable."
"D: While not terrible it got a B out of sheer generosity. Avoid. This beer is way overpriced and spend the $13 elsewhere!"
"Pours a beautiful golden mahogany with a huge head (careful!). Head settles eventually into a white coating. Lacing isn't heavy but lasting. Nose is whiskey, molasses, toffee and candied fruit. Taste is very complex - the rye, cherries, toffee and tobacco noticeable, but the whiskey taste is throughout. There is a boozy warming and tiny bitterness at the end. The progression of things this goes through are fascinating. Mouthfeel is moderate but it does feel heavy in aftertaste. This is NOT boring! Couldn't have much more of this at a sitting (11%) but will definitely seek it out again."
"D- Not a huge fan of the rye beers, but I really did like this one. Probably more of a sipper but very nice."
"The beer goes down so easy, especially for its high ABV. It seems like a refined and mature beer to add to Boulevard's illustrious Smokestack series."
"Overall, get some."
"D- A very enjoyable beer that is unique and very impressive. Along the lines of Founders Nemesis. A touch whiskey heavy, but very well done."
"Drinkability? Despite the alcohol being up there at 11.00% and I can feel it just about to the max, this is still pretty damn drinkable. Lots of good flavours, lots of enjoyment. Well made brew."
"I absolutely love all of the Smokestack Series brews, but I think this is the best one by far. I WAS never a whiskey drinker, but the more brews that I sample that have been aged in whiskey barrels, the more I am seeing myself grow a liking for that smokey goodness."
"D - This is yet another fine brew from the Boulevard Smokestack series. One of the best rye beers that I've ever had."
"Still can't tell if I like it, or want a whole lot more, even after it warms. It's quite tasty, and it's scores are deserving. Drinkable, but strong, and the flavors can get overwhelming after awhile. Another one to share as I think one glass was an interesting treat."
"750 ml corked and cagedf bottle poured a clear tarnished copper with a lasting amber head. Aromas of rye whskey, oak, vanilla, toffee, spice and white pepper. Palate was medium bodied and smooth with light carbonation. Flavors of rye whiskey, oak, pepper, earthiness and toffee with a smooth dry lingering rye whiskey finish."
"D. A very enjoyable beer, the 750 mL bottle would be great to share with friends."
"Has to be one of the best beers I've had in a long time, not a surprise, as I've yet to have a Smokestack brew I didn't love. These guys are doing great work!"
"Medium to heavy bodied, firm, and a bit oily. Doesn't seem as carbonated as the earlier pop would suggest, but still too carbonated--a problem I've noted in the recent Smokestack beers (Harvest Dance, Collaboration No. 1, Tank 7). But a darn tasty beer all the same. Best to split with at least one other person."
"Pours a nice cinnamon stick brown color with some nice head, decent lacing. Smell is big on the whiskey with some nice spicy rye notes in there too. Taste follows, but with some big buttery vanilla notes. A bit of piney hops, but just a tad, some spicy malt, wood, and more vanilla. Oddly, this all seems a bit muted to me. The flavors just don't 'pop' like I want them to. Also, as the beer goes on this becomes more pronounced. Medium to full body with some nice creaminess, decent carbonation to keep it going. Drinkability is pretty good, but as the beer goes along it kind of loses its power, an odd experience. I was happy to try this. This might be an unfair comparison, but given the option to spend $13 on this or a 4-pack of Backwoods Bastard, I'd go with the Backwoods. Nevertheless, good stuff, just not necessarily all there for me."
"Mouthfeel was a bit thinner than I expected. Medium bodied with adequate carbonation."
"Thanks to my brother for splitting this bottle with me. Bottle No. 7,873 of 12,148. The beer pours a murky brown color with a tan head. The aroma is strong rye with some oaked notes and dark fruit. The flavor is very nice with rye, cherries, vanilla, oak and a strong, spicy hops and rye finish. The alcohol is fairly noticeable. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"This remains my all time favorite. (7/17/2010)"
"Dark red color with a decent head. The smell is very whiskey-like and malt rich. The taste is spicy, thick with a solid aftertaste. You can definitely taste the whiskey influence but it is not overwhelming. The beer is a bit strong tasting and so not all that drinkable. Good beer to split with a friend and I strongly suggest this one to any beer lover."
"Drinkability was good although there were some signs of the ABV and booze. Slightly sticky. One bottle would be enough."
"D- It's a good sipping beer, and I still drank the whole 750."
"Mouthfeel medium bodied, hot, and really delicious."
"Notes: I´m admiring more and more some of these limited Smokestack releases. Quite outstanding brews, Here they offer again something rather unusual that works very well. It has a touch of their Bourbon Barrel aged Quad, but it is just a nice memory of its distant cousin since this one is clearly its own thing."
"A huge, signature smokestack head tops off a tawny brew. Has good retention with some fat fingers of lace sticking up above the leftover thick covering. Aroma is a bit sweet and sour with an undercurrent of oakiness and some dark fruits. Tastes a bit vinous with a quick hit of alcohol heat followed by more oakiness mingled with a nice hop bite all wrapped in some caramel. After a couple of sips prominent notes of maraschino cherries become noticeable. Medium bodied and smooth going down with the aforementioned alcohol heat lingering throughout. Another winner from the Boulevard crew."
"I can't wait to see how this one ages. Fortunately, I managed to get a couple of bottles to stash in the cellar."
"Very good. Very unique. Love the rye overload."
"D= This is a different beer for sure but a little too boozy and not nearly rye- ey enough. The rye is not very pronounced. An underwhelming beer indeed."
"Enjoying a '13 again on 01/10/15 - enjoyable as every. More vanilla has really settled in here, becoming present on the nose and in the mouth. So good, I've completed melted into it. The perfect sipper for a winter evening."
"Great drinkabilty for the ABV, I am shocked at how well this worked. I had Odell's Bourbon Stout a while back & thought that was a slight disappointment, this is a much better blend of flavors. Thanks again Boulevard for raising the bar for beer in my neck of the woods!"
"Bottle number 9130 of 12148, poured from a 750 corked/caged bottle into a goblet. Pours a cloudy amber, very hazy with a gushing two finger head. The head lingers for a few minutes and receeds back into a nice thin layer on top of the glass. The aromas are fruit, vanilla, and bread. First sip of this beer gives notes of toffee, caramel, with a touch of alcohol. The finish is a spicyness from the rye, and the alcohol burns on the throat. To be expected (if I am reading the bottle right) as it's less than three months old. The bottles that I have cellared will be fun to open in 6 months or a year to see how time has changed the flavors. The mouthfeel is creamy, with a medium amount of carbonation. Drinkability is good, a little bit of alcohol burn reminds you not to drink it too fast. Another great barrel aged beer from Boulevard Smokestack, and this one doesn't disapoint!"
"D: This is an interesting beer. Really a beer-whiskey hybrid; it feels like some freak experiment gone wonderfully wrong. Though I would enthusiastically drink this again, it is obviously not something for regular consumption. I continue to be impressed by what Boulevard is putting out in its Smokestack series."
"Drinkability is quite good, but its very much a sipper. Alcohol is not hot or a burden of any kind. So drinkability rates well here."
"D - This is a strong beer both in ABV and in flavor. Although very delicious it would be rough to drink more of these."
"Medium to full body is nicely carbonated. Tasty stuff."
"Another excellent offer from Boulevard...maybe I'm biased being from Kansas City, but I'm pretty impressed."
"This is a superb beer. Perhaps my favorite of the Smokestack Series so far."
"Overall, its a very tasty interesting beer."
"If the breweries of Belgium made a high point rye beer, this would be it."
"edit: I can't seem to get enough of this beer. it's become one I develop a taste for frequently and am not disappointed in."
"Though it is impressively balanced, this is definitely a Whiskey drinkers beer. A real Rye showcase without allowing the whiskey to overwhelm the more delicate flavors."
"Very creamy mouthfeel. 11% hinders the drinkability a bit, but it is rather well-hidden all things considered."
"D: At 11% this is crazy smooth and drinkable. Although the booze is present it doesn't detract too much. Great beer!"
"drinkability is ok even @ 11%abv - my only true beef with this beer is the baking soda flavors"
"Lots of rye whiskey on the tongue; this beer is still a bit green. But even in its early stage, the alcohol isn't overly hot or taxing on the tastebuds. Chewy caramel and toffee malts add a sticky, brown-sugary base that is balanced well by a crisp, piny hop profile and lots of rye spices. I can't wait to see how this beer matures in a year. Mouthfeel is a little thick and syrupy, and the rye whiskey weighs heavily on the palate. But still, this is an excellent beer, and I can't wait for another taste. Highly recommended."
"Mouthfeel is good, drinkability is ok."
"This a very unique and delicious beer from Boulevard. Another Smokestack success here."
"750ml bottle $13. Nice dark, tawny color. It smells like strong rye whiskey but is oddly pleasant and I do not like whiskey at all. i could not stop sniffing away at this and the more I drank the more the whiskey faded into something sweet. The flavor was very similar to the smell, rye whiskey with sweet notes, barley, maltiness, just a really nice tasting beer. Overall, this is a perfect beer to share or sip with a friend. Once again Boulevard has impressed me."
"4/4.5/4.5/4.5/5"
"Drink- This is a pretty nice beer. The boozyness makes this a total sipper. But, still a delicious drink. 4.5"
"I would love to taste the original beer without the barrel. If you like rye whiskey (and I do), you need to try this beer."
"I always buy at least 2 of Boulevard's Smokestack Series, so I'll try it again in a year or so-but may take my own suggestion and grab another bottle to have with a cigar."
"This beer pours a dark, caramelized brown sugar with a massive 4 inch beige-cream head that leaves a surprisingly large amount of lacing down the sides of the glass. This could very be the best head retention on any barrel-aged beer I've ever had. An inch of frothy head always is sitting squarely on top of the beer when I go to take a sip. At first whiff, caramel and toffee from a malt centric beer. As the aroma develops the rye really lends a spicy freshly ground black peper to the aroma. Also vanilla and charred oak from the Templeton barrels. This really has an extremely developed aroma. The flavor is just as complex as the aroma. Rye really develops up front lending a spicy black pepper harshness that's rounded out by caramel and toffee, toasted bread and vanilla. The only fruit note I get from the flavor profile is a slight green apple flavor on my lips that really works well. Also just a slight bit of oak on the very tail of the profile. As this beer warms, the 11% really starts showing. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy and leaves a vanilla booziness on the palate. My one knock on it, as Rye-on-Rye warms it starts becoming pretty boozy. In my opinion, this could well be the best barrel aged beer that Boulevard has put out to date."
"Some rich toffee sweetness on the front of the tongue, lively carbonation leads to a distinct whiskey taste, ending with a spicy burn that reminds you this is a sipper. The warm whiskey fade goes on and on, in a good way, it just limits quantity. I wouldn't open one of these by myself, whew!"
"Mouthfeel is a little lighter than I expected, plus the carbonation is very aggressive. It smooths itself out in the end. Not a flaw but more of a surprise. This is a great sipper and demands some summer sausage."
"Drinkability is limited to your means and ability to acquire this limited edition from Boulevard. I've consumed all of the Boulevard Smokestack series and I would consider this one, along with the Saison with Bret as the best."
