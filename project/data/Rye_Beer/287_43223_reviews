"Overall, a decent beer, but nothing special."
""
""
"Thoroughly enjoyable beer."
""
""
"Tastes more like a bitter shock top"
""
""
"An easy-drinking, balanced refreshing pale ale with a subtle hint of rye."
""
"Pretty great warm weather beer light and refreshing"
""
"Beer advocate gives a harsh grade on this one. Not overly complex, But I don't the sense that was the goal. It screams ""spring", simple and clean."
""
"Pour from a tallboy can into a 16 oz pint glass, with a fizzy, fairly short-lived craggy white head, some lacing. Transparent gold color with mild carbonation. Faint smell of pine and hop. Tastes of pine, resin, with tiny bit of fruit, a little watery at the front but with a citrus hoppy finish. Mouthfeel is pleasant, sticky. The relative thinness of taste might fool you into thinking this is a session ale, save for the tacky, slightly boozy aftertaste that lingers. It took a couple sips for me to get into this, and I still don't love it. I always have such high hopes for anything from Bell's so I was eager to try this. For this ABV, I think I'd rather something a little more complex or flavorful. Maybe I just do not appreciate this style."
""
""
"Appearance has a large off-white head, some lace and a clear amber color. Aroma is malt, hops, yeast, and a little fruit. Taste is similar to nose, bittersweet with a little carbonic tang and lingering bitterness on back of the tongue.The flavor isn't bad, just not super interesting. Body is just right. One off for me I think."
""
"I was in the mood for something light one evening while working on a small project but still wanted some flavor so I decided to pull this beer out of the fridge and give it a try. It has a nice golden color to it and you can smell that rye flavor. Oddly, though, the aftertaste is more enjoyable than the taste of the beer itself. That's not to say it tastes bad, but it leaves me wanting an IPA. Again, though, the aftertaste is good so I enjoyed the beer overall."
"Rye + IPA = Blargh.  not a good effort Bells."
""
""
"I was very pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this. I hadn't tried rye ales before but I will definitely be trying a few more now."
""
""
"Fantastic golden from Bells. Loved this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear, golden color.  2/3 inch head of a white color.  Great retention and great lacing.  Smells of sweet malt, slight rye, slight pale malt, hint of honey, hops, and a hint of pine.  Fits the style of a Rye Beer.  Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level.  Tastes of hops, sweet malt, slight rye, hint of pale malt, hint of honey, and a hint of yeast.  Overall, looks good, but body and aroma are weak and not impressive."
""
""
""
""
""
"Light copper in color with lots of tiny sediment suspended within the body.  A quarter inch off white head rests on top.  Brussels lacing.  I smell earthy rye and a bit of citrus hops in the background.  The flavor is a blend of bitter citrus hops and earthy rye, but the hops dominate until after the fade.  If it wasn't for the lingering rye I would bill it as a rye IPA.  The mouth is moderately carbonated with some stickiness from the hops."
""
""
"In my opinion, what Bells does as well as any brewery is take ordinary styles and perfects them.  They make super clean and tasty offerings of styles that I would not be as excited to drink a six pack of.  Smitten is no exception.  The beer tastes somewhat leafy, very citrusy, and has a touch of spice from the rye.  Not the most complex brew, but wow is this juicy and drinkable.  This is one that I will certainly revisit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Full golden colored. Healthy ring of fuzz, lacing. Spicy pine. Tangy citrus. Take your pick. Definitely leads pine. Pinier than most ryes I've tried, an interesting combination. It's growing on me... fans of bitter IPAs will like this; fans of ryes with low IBUs will tolerate it I imagine."
"Very unique beer, good, but glad I only grabbed a single.  Not something I would drink on the regular.  If you like rye, my guess is you will love this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Golden pour with big off white head.  Big citrus pine aroma.  Flavor is light spicy rye malt with piney bitter and a citrus grassy hop finish.  Tasty."
"one of the better golden ales that I have had, I am a sucker for rye at the moment though.  If you sometimes feel golden ales are missing something, this may be it, a little more spice."
""
""
"this beer was just alright. nothing special. easy to drink but lacking anything memorable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Honey colored, hoppy, citrus flavored 2 fingered head in a snifter was good for me.  Rye is very understated, but Enjoyed immensely & would highly recommend!"
"Pours orange golden with a slight white head that quickly recedes.  Aroma is toasted grains,  honey, spicy rye, a little fruitiness and some grassy hops. Flavoris biscuit, honey, spcy rye, fruity, with a mild to moderate resinous finish. A crisp, medium bodied mouthfeel with a dry finish. Overall, surprised a little by how much I enjoyed this one. Dangerously ""sessionable," because at 6% abv it is certainly no session beer."
""
"Huge head. Cloudy orange liquid. Not a big smell, but it had orange and pine. The taste had a nice mix of sweet citrus and little bitterness to it. Very spritzy. All in all, I could drink it all the time just because it's refreshing."
""
"This was very strong in the citrus department for a rye beer, spiciness provided balance and made this quite drinkable"
""
""
"Pours from the growler in to an IPA glass with a light golden hue and just a kiss of red rye. The minimal white head settles quickly in to a thin collar, while the transparent liquid shows just a touch of chilled haze. The aroma yields bready pale malts and hops of the earthy variety. Only moderately aromatic, with just traces of rye discernible. The taste follows the nose. Mildly flavored and balanced, with a slightly drying finish. A bit of peppery spice from the rye and a lingering mild hop bitterness leave a lasting impression. A spritzy, lively carbonation helps give the impression of a fuller body, though it's mostly an illusion, and a good one. Overall, this is a pretty standard affair, and it makes me yearn for something more potent and flavorful, like a Ruthless Rye. When a pale ale takes on the same basic profile of an IPA, but tames all of the desirable characteristics down, it simply leaves me unsatisfied. It's not easy enough to be a session beer, and not bold enough to stand out. Perhaps a good bridge to better things if you're trying to ease in to the craft world."
""
"The color of this beer is insane. The smell is also great."
""
"Overall an easy drinking beer, nothing especially exciting though."
"Overall, this is much better than I anticipated. Light and citrusy, but just enough earthy rye spiciness to balance things out."

"Golden with moderate head that dissapates slowly into a lacy white collar. Subtle nose with notes of grass and slight fruitiness. Medium bodied with nice complexity. Starts off slightly sweet and fruity and transitions to bready, then earthy almost woody hop notes. Well balanced and easily drinkable. Yum."
"Overall-  Bell's has once again formulated a very nice brew.  I recommend everyone give it a try."
"The aroma was slightly sweet with a hint of rye and hops. Fairly typical of an American ale. The taste followed the aroma but not quite as sweet. Refreshing."

"Nothing stands out about this beer, but it is a superbly balanced, beautifully crafted ale.  Don't expect fireworks here, just relax and enjoy this one, being glad we're living at a time when such good, fresh beer is so readily available.  I'm smitten :)"

"O-Not my favorite beer but very drinkable."
"The bottle is dated 01/04/15 and was decanted to a standard pint glass. This beer pours a slightly hazy gold with a small head. A small amount of head lasts throughout with quite a lot of lacing left behind. The aroma is subtle with a nice malt and piney smell. The taste is nicely crisp and refreshing. The hop bitterness is not overwhelming and the aftertaste is clean with just a touch of lingering bitterness that fades quickly.  The presence of rye is not obvious in this beer. Overall this is an extremely drinkable beer."
""

""

"Great hop-heavy rye. It’s bitter but goes down easily. All around a great brew."
"Smell and taste are totally flowery and perfumey, but I just love it."
"It is making me type a review"
""
"Not my favorite Bells beer, but by far better than some of the beers I had in the ""flight"" at the Ecentric cafe"
""
""
"Overall: A very nice, hop-forward English-style rye pale ale.  Extremely drinkable despite the bitterness.  As usual, a nice offering from Bell’s and a welcome addition to their early winter seasonal rotation."
""
""
""
""
"O- Reasonably unique pale ale with a nice rye spice to it and plenty of citrus and floral bite. It's kind of like what I would expect a rye English bitter to taste like. It's pretty solid, nothing special but worth a shot."
""
""
""
""

"Pours a burnt orange with a little head and lacing.  Very smooth - the right mixture of citrus and hops.  I believe this beer would serve as a good introduction  to American IPAs to a newer drinker...Overall a great experience!"

"Not bad, had this on one of the last few warm days of summer.  Poured out of the bottle into a pint glass.  Clean golden ale with a nice spice from the rye.  Usually I prefer rye in a pale or IPA, but this worked.  Nice yellowish color, completely clear with a little head.  Not bad."

"O: I really like this beer; for what it is--a slightly bitter and citrusy RYE forward beer, this hits it out of the park; so refreshing and drinkable"
"Pours golden amber hue with foamy carbonating white head. Aroma is tart and bitter.. Hoppy and floral with some mild pine notes in the background. Flavor is pleasant..hoppy but not overwhelmingly so. Mouthfeel is thick and satisfying..hop flavor sticking to the sides of the mouth. Another success from bells."
""
""
""
"Amber yellow in color with perfect clarity. Poured with a thick, dense white foam with excellent staying power that left sheets of sticky lacings on the glass. Citrus hop and floral aromas up front with rye malt notes in tow. Medium bodied with soft carbonation and a resinous feel. Flavors are similar to aromas with citrus and floral hops up front followed by spicy rye malt through the middle and a clean, light crisp finish. Refreshing and easy to drink "
""
""
""
""
"A fine, light, summery ale featuring a delicate lemony tartness. The rye component definitely adds a one-of-a-kind of subdued spiciness to things. Nice and delightful."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very solid rye pale ale with clean flavors but maybe light on the rye to bring out its true qualities."
""
""
""
"A: Very mellow, enjoyable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- like a less bright, deeper and more malt-oriented version of the two hearted (which is also very good)"
""
"Poured from a bottle into a Lagunitas mason jar. Good head retention finger and a half head. Darker golden color with plenty of carbonation. Mild smell, some hops and malt nothing overwhelming. Tastes good to me, malty and bitter but sweet as well. Some caramel notes for sure and definitely a little bite on the back end. Some hints of rye in there but not a ton. Mouthfeel is solid but doesn't stick around very long. Overall a nice beer probably would have been better if it was fresh or on draft but I got this with a case being clearanced at $20 per so I cannot complain. Will definitely try to get it on draft for comparison."

"Much like Bell's Two-Hearted Ale. Has a strong hop taste and aroma balanced out by the caramel undertones. There are overtones of rustic dry malt which balance out the caramel and hops as well. Not a very large head if poured and very carbonated. Great on its own!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is very similar to two hearted ale by bells. It has a very hoppy aroma and taste...good clarity with a light caramel color and thirst quenching. With a six percent abv this beer finishes very smooth. The carbonation finished very creamy. Great!"
"Very similar to Bell's Famous 2 Hearted Ale. Lighter in color, a golden yellow and not as strong in terms of hops or bitterness. Refreshing flavor is perfect for the summer month. There is a distinct carbonation that leaves a tingling aftertaste...."
"Hoppy and refreshingly light beer. Light carbonation aids in the hoppy flavor developing. Doesn't leave an after taste like other beers with this much hoppy flavor. A great beer to pair with light foods and great for summer time drinking. A great rye flavored beer!"
"This is a very refreshing beer. You are invited in by the caramel color and once you smell this beer you are hooked. You can smell the hops right from the beginning. Once this beer touches your lips you can taste the hops and citrus flavor of this great beer"
""

""
""
""
""
""

""

"O- Another good beer from Bell's. This beer seems like a great session beer, although I say that without having checked the ABV."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is light and crisp with a little texture, light fizzy carbonation, and a slightly bitter spicy finish that’s on the dry side with rye and hops. Nice beer overall, pale ale or rye beer category is not important since it’s tasty, crisp and easy drinking. Could be a session beer if I can get more of it."
""
""
""
""
"O: I bought this single bottle at Price Chopper and I'm guessing it hasn't been properly handled. I'd like to get a fresh, clean bottle; I suspect I'd give it a better review."
""
""
""
""
"O: Very nice and worth the quaff. Dare I say it, it is what I would seek if I pictured a rye Hopslam."
"Pure white foam head, tightly woven microfoam, semi-aggressive pour yields a little over a finger, retention is okay, the lacing streaks are meager but long, average stick. Filmy golden colored liquid, lots of fine particulate floating throughout, semi-opaque as a result, few visible bubbles. Very grainy nose featuring spicy rye notes, black pepper, orange and grapefruit rinds, once you get past the initial burst there’s underlying sweetness found in honey notes and peach, apricot fruit accents, light touch of mineral water and cigar ash before it floats off. Medium-bodied, the carbonation charges right out of the gate, gets things churning. On the dry side even as the rye is not over the top, hoppy with no lack of leafiness even if it’s the grains which take precedence. Stronger citrus presence here, lemon to orange. As in the nose, the apricot, peach, yellow apple fruit holds off before showing. The finish is filled with earthy, metallic notes, creates added bitterness. That said, balanced on the whole, drinking well chilled helps. You can tell it is well crafted, however, it also has a sort of lowbrow “throwback” feel and taste to it."
"M- full bodied and refreshing for a 6% abv, very easily drinkable. I really enjoyed this beer and even my wife likes it, who usually prefers very easy-going wheat beers. I've had many a good beer from Bell's and this is one of them. Definitely a good session beer on a warm spring day."
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer goes down so easy! It keeps you refreshed especially if it were a hot day I can imagine a cold one of these going down great. Probably good with BBQ and lounging on the porch. My only drawback is that it dries out the palate a bit much. I like what Bell's is going for here with this beer and I think it could be sessionable at 6%. Give it a try."
""
""
"A fairly nice brew, perhaps more of an American Pale as referenced above with hints of rye as it lacks the robust rye backbone some of its counterparts in the style possess."

"Not my favorite beer. Not terrible, but the flavors mix in weird ways that don't really work for me."
""
""
"Here's an interesting alternative to the number of standard pale ales on the market. I like Smitten."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured in to a pint glass. Hazy dark yellow, thin white head. Smells bready with floral notes. Taste light and sweet up front, dry rye and floral hops on the finish. Much to commend, but nothing particularly remarkable. Solid session beer, hides the alcohol well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This pours a copper gold with incredible head retention. I caught just a touch of peppery rye backing the lemony hop aroma along with a lightly buttered body that's smooth and crisp. There’s a touch of lemon and crack of peppercorn. I enjoyed this but I'd like it more if it was a sessionable 4% ABV instead of its 6%."

""

""

"Recommendation - Plenty of value for this beer. Ideally I would drink this on my patio on a hot day but this has enough dimension to sip and ponder."
""
"Light and does not linger in the mouth and is very easy to sip on. I think this is a good addition to Bells rotation, but is not something that I would pick over the Oberon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A good mix and balance of sweet faint caramel, toasty and fruity spice, and orange hop bitterness. Pretty solid enjoyable beer even for me who is pretty picky about rye beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not a horrible beer, but not my cup of tea. Proper price, 6% ABV, a nice try for a beer drinker who likes darker versions of beers that aren't too heavy, like ales, lagers and pilsners."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Super easy drinking beer. Can't believe how good it is. A real sleeper in their catalog, I will definitely be drinking tons of this now that bells is in town!"

"Rye here matched perfectly with its hops. Pleasant and tasty."
""

"O - A decent quaff, and easy to drink. Not a huge fan of rye bread; I find it overpowering. So I welcome the muted rye notes which have many of the virtues of the bread without bowling me over. I liked this beer's balance, and I'd drink it again."

"I really like Bell's in general. I have had a few rye beers and none of them have done it for me, I thought if any brewery could do it Bell's could. Maybe my taste buds were off tonight, but this is an odd beer. It smells great, similar to an IPA or pale ale. It looks great, and in the beginning it tastes good, then that spicy bitterness hits and it lingers on the back of my tongue in a bad way. Its a very strong bitterness that I could not shake. I thought maybe it was me, I drank some water ate a few pretzels then tried again, same result. It tastes very nice on the front of my tongue but as it passes over the rest of my mouth it clings in a rather unpleasant way to the back. It gives off a strange alkaline flavor that I just cannot get past. I will have to say this is not my favorite by Bell's. I will place it in the same category as Oberon another grain that I don't enjoy in my beers, wheat! Oddly enough the other rye beers I had tried in the past did remind me of wheat beers, and is why I did not enjoy them, but now I have found another reason not to like them. I am giving this one higher marks than I should and on paper it looks better than it is, but the smell is nice, I will have to give Bell's that. Anyway, I will keep trying on occasion, but this one does fall short. I do find this odd because I generally like rye whisky and I also like wheated bourbons. But as far as beers go, neither wheat nor rye work for I."

"Saw this today at Meijer and decided to pick up a 6 pack.Sure am glad I did.Poured into a pilsner glass about 1 inch of head that faded but left nice lacing.Has nice hop aroma and flavor but you can also detect some spiciness from the rye.I REALLY like this.Well done,Bell's!"

"Really great overall - I could drink this every day. Super great hop flavors and really well balanced!"

"As a fan of Bell's and of rye beers I felt inclined to try this offering. Though it was met with mixed reviews, I am very glad I tried this offering. This ale pours a hazy beautiful golden amber color with a thick frothy white head that lasts throughout the pour. There is a significant amount of lacing for such a light bodied ale. The nose is very subtle with fresh flavors of rye and a little yeast. Almost smells more European than American in nature. The flavor is light and subtle as well. Slightly bitter and sweet at the same time with definite notes of yeast and rye. It is very light and easy sipping. By far not my favorite offering from Bell's or my favorite rye ale but none the less a very enjoyable ale that could be sessioned all day or just enjoyed as a refreshing quaff after work."

"Hazy golden body with a soft, white head. The aroma brings grain, mild hops, earth, citrus. The flavor is ok. A bit too conservative for me. A hint of hops, mild bitterness, finishing dry. Crackers, grain, earth. Middle of the road. Not one of the better offerings from Bell's."
"I'm just not a huge fan, nor everyday drinker, of pale ales. As it stands, this is a good pale ale. Worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
"This Bell's offering misses the mark. I will never begrudge a hoppy beer with an edge. However, Smitten has too much resiny bitterness and not enough malt to back it up. And whatever the rye was supposed to do, it decided it had other places to be. Besides a quick earthy taste, I do not think the rye has contributed much. Really, this beer is just far too bitter with nothing to accentuate the brute force."
""
""
""
"o: great beer here! if you are a fan of hoppy rye beers this is one to pick up. easy drinking, some rye beers get a bit too hoppy and all the acidity can make them difficult to consume for a session beer. this has great balance. wish it was available year round. it would make a great spring/summer beer!"
""
""
""
"My 2nd beer from Bell's and my 2nd let down. The label to me explains how it tastes. As a kid we would dare each other to break the stem of a dandelion and lick the white stuff....this beer taste like that. Very bitter and immediately after sipping I feel my sinuses clear. The after taste taste like a generic beer to me."
""
""
"O- I enjoyed this beer, and would drink it again. The beer is labeled as a Golden Rye Ale, but the short description states that it is an ""interesting take on the American Pale Ale."" Based on the overall flavor of the beer, I'd concur that this is an interesting take on american pale ale, and that the Rye while part of the ingredient list is part of the flavoring rather than the primary grain. The 6.00% abv makes this a very drinkable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bell's Smitten Golden Rye Ale ---4/5."
""
"Overall, the best thing about this beer is its flavor, coupled with its ease of drinkability. The rye really flourishes with warmth, adding to the depth of the grain bill, while lightening up any inherent bitterness of hops that may have escaped the final blend. This is nice, as it adds a robustness to the main bulk of both the nose and the tongue. This does, however, seem like more of a commercial pull, with enough lightness to appeal to the masses. That said, we ended up very much appreciating that aspect of it, as it made it wonderfully drinkable, especially when coupled with the soft and creamy drag to each sip. Although well known within the stage, this is one of Bell’s sleepers, and definitely something we feel would appeal to many beer appreciators."

"Pours bright yellowish orange with a white one finger head. Lots of sediment in here, so pour foul on my part I guess. Aroma is orange citrus, spicy rye, and a bit if wheaty yeast funk. Light orange rind flavor finishes with some hint of rye spice. Seems very much a summer ale. Not a bad beer, and a neat twist on the rye beer style. Almost a combo of Oberon and Ruthless Rye."

"Pours a hazy deep yellow with an off white head. In the aroma, floral and a dry to apple like rye note. In the taste, dry green apple to tartness, with some floral notes. A small bite and alighter bodied mouthfeel, with a lightly dry green apple rye presence and floral notes in the aftertaste. Nice presence of rye and floral presence, quite enjoyable."

"Overall- Like having some sourdough rye toast with grapefruit marmelade in a glass. Very enjoyable and a unique change up from a lot of other summer type beers, would be great around a campfire at night. Perhaps an odd combination of flavors for some, but I'll be buying again."

"I allowed the beer to flow freely from the bottle until the foaming head threatened to pass over the lip of the glass. I easily had two fingers of French Vanilla-colored head with not only great retention, but as it fell, it was creating great lacing in its wake. Color was a cloudy orangish-yellow, like freshly squeezed grapefruit juice. The nose was to die for! It had the black pepper of the rye along with a very earthy scent, like digging in the garden. Mouthfeel was medium and the black pepper flavor was immediately evident on the tongue. It combined nicely with the grapefruit flavor of the hops. This is an APA?!? Wow! The finish was dry, especially with that lingering flavor of freshly-turned soil. I would have this again real soon, hopefully to share with the Old Lady."

"Bell’s did a pretty nice job with this one. Smitten? Yeah…kinda. It’s good. The rye presence is probably a tad strong. A slightly stronger hop presence (with less rye) would be spot-on. This is good stuff though. Worth picking up."
"High C+ (Borderline B-)"
"Pours a warm golden-brown color, with a puff of white foam over top, which clings nicely to the sides of the glass. The aroma brings to mind buttery bread crust, faint floral notes, and a trace of Rye whiskey. There's a strong taste of piny hop varieties accompanied by rye bread. It's got a medium mouth feel and quite the bitter finish. Greater than the sum of it's parts, it's a very solid Rye Beer all things considered."

"D: This was not a great rye beer. The scent was sub-par, and the taste and body weren't a big improvement. The finish wasn't bad but wasn't great. No real impressive or redeeming element. Not recommended."
""
""
""
"This is a medium to light bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is a nice summertine refreshing brew with lots of enjoyable hop aspects. I could see where someone who doesnt dig pale ales or IPAs might be turned off by this as it has quite a hop punch to it. Thanks again Jason!"
""

"Overall- Meh, I'm not really a fan of this brew, doesn't really come together for me and it's neither light nor dry enough for what I want it to be. Spicy, bold ale? No. Light, crisp ale? Not really. Too middle-of-the-road I suppose, and the rye characteristics are overshadowed by the yeast and what I interpret to be the liquor/water characteristics. I probably wouldn't avoid it, but I'd likely not order it for myself either."

"Overall, this is a fantastic beer that is nicely balanced and light on the tongue."

"This is a different, much lighter take, on what can be done with rye. Not great, but enjoyable."
"O – I really liked this beer. It really had all the things that I look for in a pale ale, plus the addition of rye to make it a “rye beer.” There’s nothing particularly groundbreaking here, but it’s definitely tasty, drinkable, and a great example of the style."
""
""
"Smitten pours a golden golden color, with a nice large lacing head. The aroma is a bit similar to a bathroom, luckily its not too strong. The taste is crisp a nice strong citrus, and a nice bit of bitterness. Nice full flavor. Overall a not bad beer, good citrus flavors that work well in this beer."
""
""
""
""

"O: Refreshing and easy drinking porch beer. The hop and malt profile are clean and simple yet play well together. A seasonal ale that doesn't break the bank."
""

"Overall - This is a pretty awesome pale rye ale. Flavor-wise, reminds me a bit of Deschutes Red Chair. Solid all-around balance, with an interesting mix of flavor. Bring this to California, please!"

"Here's the typically terse but clever label verbiage from the bottle: ""With wonderfully bitter citus notes, resinous hop flavors and earthy overtones, this interesting take on the American Pale Ale doesn't leave a lot of room to wonder if you'll love it."" Well done, but I'd skip the superlatives. ""wonderful"" and ""interesting"" should be left to the consumer to decide. True enough, it's a very likable brew."
""
"To me this would make a good summer beer, I'm not totally sure why its bottled in January. It's very drinkable and price point is right on track with most craft sold today. My only real gripe is if its a rye ale, I think it should use a much heavier rye recipe. Overall a nice little beer for a hot summer/spring day."
""
""
"O- A decent experiment, the hops and the rye clash a bit but not to a degree to make it unpleasant. The 6.0% ABV is a nice little kick and is well hidden."
""
""
"Served from bottle to glass. Had a thick head that was about 2 fingers thick. Rich yellow color with some sedimentation floating in the glass. Had a great smell of citrus. First sip hits you with bitter citrus notes and slight hit of hops. Has a smooth mouthfeel. Good summer Ale."
"Overall, a solid beer, but I seem to have a favor for lighter rye beers. I love the way the spiciness of the rye comes through when paired with lighter flavor/smell profiles. I would easily find myself buying a sixer of this brew."

"Listening to Dr. John on Spotify goes great with this light summer/spring brew from Bell's...color is a kiss of orange/apricot preserves with a whipped head that brings a beige cream colored head forms thick with fine even banded lacing poured into a Tripel Karmeliet chalice. Aroma heavy hitting with floral citrus based hops, underlying hints of spicy rye malts with signature Bell's house yeast strain glowing through like your favorite artisanal crusted bread. The nose hits with orange marmalade like notes heavy on the peel, glazed with sweetness from the malts and balanced with the rye sharpness. Flavor is melding well, heavy bitterness with minimal crashing waves of alcohol seeping through this beer is sending out a lovely message, refreshment with hop bitterness. Someone had to do it I'm glad it's a great company like Bell's, I'm going to quit trying to act like somebody else and just enjoy what's good and not what's popular. I don't see this beer getting raved about, let me start the bandwagon, it's fuckin' good simply pleasurable well crafted American pale ale. The more I taste and smell this beer I'm getting limoncello with spiced rye grains bleeding through the alcohol, not nearly as strong but the same presence. Mouthfeel is creamy textured with hints of nuttiness on the sides of my palate, ample flowing carbonation this beer is smooth but still has that lingering rough hop oil bitterness that most ""normal"" beer drinkers don't care for, however I'm a ""hophead"" and I wouldn't expect anything less. Overall high quality well thought out beer, that I'm pleasured to sample a bottle of keep 'em coming good stuff from our friends up in Michigan."
""
"A nice beer here for sure. Admittedly Rye's are not my favorite of styles, but this one was refreshing and tasty."
"Eh, I wasn't very impressed at all. It seems like a user friendly beer for people just switching over to craft."
"O: I saw this six pack when I visited Bell's two weeks ago and I just had to try it, nothing crazy very simple rye beer."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of hops, some citrus. Taste is hoppy, spicy rye, some malts, a mild bitterness, well balanced. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."

"I love Rye beers and the Bell's Smitten is no different. The beer poured a clear golden color with this white head that left a very nice lace down the pint glass. The scent carried a rye flare with subtle lemony citrus notes. The taste was a very crisp common rye taste with light sitrus backing. The mouthfeel is light to medium body with good carbonation. Overall this is a great session beer and I will be looking to drink more of it...good beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a snifter. White head on a hazy gold body. Moderate head retention. Suddsy lacing. Aroma is a pleasant mix of citrusy, lemony hops, and a light sweetness. Taste is nicely bittered, refreshingly fresh tasting, with a mild background sweetness. Very easy to drink I would think, over and over."
""
""
""
"D - I'm a big fan of both Bell's Brewery and Rye Beers,but this one misses the mark for me... The rye component isn't nearly present enough in any facet and there isn't too much else here to get excited about... This is something that I'll avoid in the future..."
"O - Pretty good rye beer. The spicy rye is done just right, and the assertive hop profile really balances this beer out. Very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"O- The great hop flavor and nice rye support is full and tasty but it is dry enough and light enough in the body that it is very drinkable as a session beer."
""
"O - this is nice pale ale with a touch of rye. I like it a lot better than Bells regular pale ale. It's a better PA than a rye beer, but it's a nice beer regardless."

"Overall Smitten is an excellent surprise. I found it delicious and enjoyable, and will certainly seek it out again. Cheers."

""
""
"O- Pretty decent, but nothing to scream about. A good beer, though."
""
""
""
"A golden body with great head and lace on top of a piney hop aroma with a good amount of rye that is picked up (that bready smell it can sometimes give off). Smooth, almost creamy, easy to drink, not bland or boring but not the most exciting beer. A floral hoppy taste, along with citric, is balanced with a hint of sweetness and the rye smoothes things out while giving it a tad spiciness and crispness in the finish. Can't complain with relaxing with this beer."
""
""
""
"This is a really nice take on an American Pale Ale. It has the hops and spiciness of an APA and the graininess, drinkability, and refreshing qualities of a wheat beer. It would make a terrific summer beer."

"O-An easy drinking spring beer, however adding more rye or hops would give the beer slightly more flavor, which it needs."
""
""
""
""
"O= This is a great beer. Offers a smooth transition from winter to spring. I don't know if this is seasonal or what but I like this baby. A nice smooth sipper with great flavors."
""
"There is a lot of stuff in the bottle, but with semicareful decanting pours mostly clear amber. Well carbonated and pours with a foamy head. This is pretty hoppy, and the rye seems to add some spiciness. Still, the hoppiness does not seem to be as over the top as in All Day IPA, but I sense a head to head tasting coming up. The carbonation and hoppiness combine for a solid mouthfeel. Overall, this goes down very easily, perhaps sessionable by taste, despite ABV = 6."
""
""
""
"don't get caught up in the style, just drink it. a very nice beer, will take this over Oberon as a better spring offering from bells."

"O - Generally wouldn't be my type of beer considering it's hop-heaviness, but Bell's does it well."

""
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and an above average example of the style, this beer had good balance and the spicy rye flavors went nicely with the floral hop profile. This beer had ok drinkability, it was fairly smooth and the flavors held my attention, but it was a little filling so I think two would be enough for me, but I might be inclined to drink a few of these on a nice warm spring day. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and aroma, they were both good and pretty true to style. What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was decent, but it was a little to thick and too filling for my liking. I would buy this beer again when it gets warmer, it seems like it would be a nice and refreshing warm weather beer, I would recommend this to people who like rye beers. All in all I was satisfied with this beer, but I think it would be more fitting if they released this beer in the late spring/ early summer, it just seems like this beer would be good for that time of the year. This is a nice rye beer but I think I would rather have a Founders Reds Rye or any of the Short's Rye beers instead, but this one wasn't bad by any means. This was another solid offering from Bell's, keep up the good work guys."
""

"Poured this Rye Beer from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a clear, orange/golden color- produced an average white head, nice retention and left ample lacing on the glass. The aroma contained spicy rye, caramel and floral hops. Medium bodied, a foundation of sweet caramel, spicy rye and citric hops. Overall, this is an excellent session beer, very easy to drink- average to above average example of the style."
""
"A bit thinner than I would have expected for a rye beer. But it's a nice earthy presentation overall. Inky and earthen tones are there on the end. Fairly full carbonation. A hearty drinker, even though it's on the lighter side of most rye beers you get out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Full bodied and much more interesting than expected. The nose is pretty boring but it's actually complex, well balanced and flavorful. Crisp spicy hop bite up front gives off some dry bitterness with resinous oils, grass and pine needle flavor. Some peppery rye, but like the nose, it's not a dominant flavor. Nicely balanced by yeast, light fruit notes and a pale malt backbone. Hints of bread, biscuit and cracker round things out in the dry finish. Not a great beer but it's refreshing and easy to drink with nice hop flavor."
"Pours a golden body with lots of yeast suspended and swirling around, with a small white head with decent retention. Aromas of honey and grain with slight hints of flowers and pineapple. Taste is consistent with the aromas and extremely well balanced in the malt to hop ratio, and finishes dry with a flavor of orange pith. It's worth trying if you don't mind chewing yeast."

"smitten golden rye ale is pretty bold. less citrus than an ipa with a more bitter finish. it smells hoppy and crisp. the look of this beer is cloudy and golden with small chunks suspended like fruit in jello. this isnt a bad beer at all pretty full flavored. id drink it again."
""
""
"Taste/feel: Great stuff. I've only had about three or four rye beers in my life, and this one tastes different than most... but I think that's a good thing. The sweetness of this beer is something I'm not used to, because ryes generally seem more bitter to me. The floral notes with the sweetness and, really, light rye makes this a super tasty beer. The rye doesn't come out very strong, but a good beer's a good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taset is pleasant with citrus peel hop flavor and gentle earthy malt with slight grassy taste from the hops w/ light tannic element which seems like a tea-like hop astringency with toasted maltiness in the back end. Overall a pretty tasty rye w/ nice balance and plenty of hop flavor which is almost a Rye IPA in terms of perceived bitterness with fresh taste and dry feel that brings you back for more."
"This beer is immaculate. Superbly crafted, amazing balance, straightforward and clean with a nice complexity. This beer is about everything I could want from an American pale ale. My favorite beer this year so far, hands down."
"Smitten pours out a hazy orange color with a nicely retaining head. The aroma is nice and rye-forward, with light malts and hopping. The taste, again, is rye forward, but it doesn't smack you upside the head with spiciness. The rye is also brilliantly matched by an APA-level of bright citrus hops. The mouthfeel is light and moderately carbonated, and the drinkability is exceptional. Bell's Smitten is an excellent rye beer, one of the best I've had. It provides an insanely delicious level of balance that keeps me coming back for more."
"Pours into a standard pint a clear light to medium golden with a great looking sticky over one finger white head that lift multiple rings of broken lace as it settled into a frothy mass.Aromas were just mild with a sharp note of rye over top of light citric hops,again pretty light.Flavors have some decent citric hops and sharp rye notes but they end ebruptly and nothing really lingers.There is some earthiness that comes into play but the flavors seem to die out pretty quickly after a good start.Not one of the better rye ales I have had but it's not horrible by any means."

""
"O: In the end, I think this is a very good beer, but I am not sure how often I will buy it. I think I would always prefer two hearted over this especially since this is 6%. If this was a 4.5 - 5% beer, this would end up in the fridge more often. Like it, don't love it, but worth trying."
""
"O: Not bad - but I'm certainly not smitten with it. It's too sharp in feel for its nondescript flavor profile."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a honey gold color with a white head and a bit of lace. Large chunks of yeast or proteins are hanging in suspension. Aroma of clean maltyness, some floral and sweet fresh doughy bread. In the taste, bready malt sweetness balanced by a citrusy hop character and a bit of grainy rye. Mild bitterness with notes of grapefruit. Medium bodied with a chalky finish. Overall, this was an ok beer but a little disappointed. This ale could use some cleaning up."
""
"I like this beer the rye is nicely balanced and not over powering which is good because I'm really not that big into rye beers. Plenty drinkable."
""
""

"This is my favorite rye ale thus far. You can actually taste and enjoy the addition of rye in this one. Quite quenching and sessionable, this would also make a great ale for summer."

""
"O- This is a very well balanced pale ale. There was a lot less rye flavor than I initially thought that there would be, however the amount present turned out to be perfect. I can not emphasize how drinkable this beer is. I drank my first bottle waaay to fast, and I'm not usually a fan of rye. A very nice spring offering."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Nice beer, would be better in hotter months."
""
"Overall: A pretty solid rye beer. Good spice and citrus taste."
"This beer pleases me a lot, in part because there are too few beers with this sort of bitterness (as far as I know there is not a vocabulary in English to distinguish differing qualities of bitter). Perhaps it's the rye I am into. Otherwise I'd love to know which bittering hops were included. The substantial body (for a ""pale ale"") seems to help keep that flavor lingering long enough that I can really relax into it. In contrast, some very tastey beers have fleeting flavors that I would rather hold onto longer. Perhaps I'll have some criticism after a few more, but the first two just taste balanced and delicious."
"O - This was really tasty. I wished that I had another one as soon as I finished the first."
"Overall: I found it to be tiresome and tedious, frankly."
"4.5/5"
""
"A nice light hoppy ale, good rye flavor but it could stand to have a little more rye. Easy to drink and worth having. I would drink it again."
""
"A tasty spring seasonal that I'm short on words for. Worthy of a six-pack purchase, however."
"I love this beer and brewery. I wish this was a year round beer for this brewery. A true good representation of a rye beer. Beautiful golden hazy color with good retention. Floral with a spicy rye finish, another very drinkable beer. Not alot of depth but a great initial flavor that is very easy to drink."

"Pours an orangish amber with a layer of off white head. The nose is abut weird. I'm getting rye and some citrus but there is also a slight medicinal quality. The taste is better. Rye spice teams up with citrus peel hops. The malt backbone is quite nice. Quite enjoyable but not spectacular."

"Taste is nicely floral upfront, much like a nice American pale ale....not too strong but certainly flavorful. Afterwards, the spicy rye comes out a bit and adds another layer to this beer and makes it a bit different. The bitterness is fair on the end and lingers a little while. Fairly clean otherwise. Pretty good stuff, a good take on an APA."

""
""
""
"O: Not bad, but it pales in comparison to Founders ""Red Rye"" and ""Red Rocket," both of which are roughly the same price as a sixer. Sure, I'll grab this one again on draft sometime."

"Pours a brilliant golden-tan with a significant amount of minuscule flocculates - almost hazy. Produces a creamy, thick, 2 inch off-white head. Poured a second carefully and ""candled"" - stopped pouring when the flocculates reached the neck. The ale does have a slight haze! Beautiful, fresh citrus and hoppy nose. Bright, clean, spicy palate that lingers. Totally moreish. Perceptively sessionable, although the 6% ABV may be a concern. Develops a very nice Belgian lace. Forward bitter notes with lingering malt and woody-earthy notes! Poured a third . . ."
"Pours a straw like yellow with three fingers of white head. Smells of hop resin, grass, citrus notes. Opens with a mellow sweet bit of honey followed by a crisp hop jab for balance. A medium bodied brew that has a tart almost sour aftertaste. This is very solid brew that is easily and dangerously sessionable."
""
""
""
"Not sure if I'd get this again, but it's not bad for a single bottle."
"D: good, but I wanted this to be hoppier and more rye focused. without either of those aspects it is a tad middle of the road imo."
""
""
""
"As I've heard there could be a looming price rise/switch to a four-pack on Red's Rye, this could be a different, but totally suitable, replacement."
""
""
""
"O: This is a good, hearty, old-fashioned ale. It has a very old-school feel and taste about it. You would think the citrus would heavily clash with the rye, but this doesn't really happen. The actual sweet tropical notes are quite low. This beer has more of the bitter, zesty aspect of the aforementioned citrus, which seem to complement the rye well; it ends up being slightly dry. In my opinion, this is an excellent rye beer. I hope to see more beers like this in the future."
""
"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled on 1/14/2013. Pours very cloudy golden amber color with a nice 1-2 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of orange zest, grapefruit, lemon, pine, floral, spicy rye, grass, bread, and light herbal. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity. Taste of orange, grapefruit, lemon, pine, spicy rye, bread, toast, floral, grass, and light herbal. Fair amount of piney bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pine, floral, rye spiciness, bread, toast, and grass on the finish for a bit. Very nice flavor balance of hop/malt, with good complexity; zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, lightly sticky, and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with nearly zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice rye pale ale! Nice balance of hop/malt flavors with good complexity; and extremely smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"I picked up a 6-pack of this beer the other day at Franklin Fine Wine in Royal Oak. I have never had a Bell's beer I didn't like, so I figured this one would be a good choice. And it was. I like just about any craft beer, but this is one of my favorites of the month. It had great flavor. A nice hearty flavor, but not bitter and not too filling. This is a great beer. I encourage you not to run to the store and buy them all, because I'd like to have them all for myself."
"On the label it claims this pale ale will be citrusy and resinous. They oversold it, big time. Pours a cloudy amber with thin white head, spots of lace on the glass. Smell: wheat, soft graininess (rye), spicy, just a hint of lemon peel. Taste: tastes like a pale wheat with rye subbed in, light caramel. Hops are spicy, lightly earthy, a little but not enough citrus to advertise it on the label. Dry finish. Yes, the rye is featured decently, but it's not a very good beer, and the marketing team screwed up. Glad it was only a single. Bottled 1/15/13."

"One of the better RyePA's out there. It has a great appearance with a lingering head. What sets it apart from its Sierra Nevada counterpart is it's more comforting mouthfeel. It's not as harshly bitter as the Ruthless Rye ( which is a great beer, don't get me wrong). One of my favorite Rye beers."
""
""
""
"Overall - Very tasty, easy to enjoy, and plenty of rye. Think sierra nevadas ruthless rye made a big enough impression that bells had to bottle this one. Very solid, not to bitter, not to pale malt forward, great balance, a must try for rye fans."
""
"I had this on tap and its a bit different. There are no floaties, which must mean they are at the bottom of the barrel and the finish is really bitter. The bitter end, really takes away from that bread finish you get this beer."

"Overall: This is a superior brew…the flavor is unique and distinct…Bell’s took the “APA” concept on a journey, got a bit guidance from a magical liopleurodon and ultimately found candy mountain with this one…it’s super good, zesty, lively, refreshing, but there’s a touch of sour that I actually like…the peppery/rye flavored brews have taken over for me as the choice seasonal, I’m gonna be on the look out for more of these in the future…I could drink this flavor all night and now am curious how this is out of a tap, I really need to make a trip to Kalamazoo…total score, I’m definitely picking up another sixer for later…(4.5/5)"

"Light, refreshing and easy drinking, would be great for the warmer weather. I get a good bit of Pilsner qualities in this...like a hybrid of Prima Pils and a Pale Ale with a dash of rye. Pretty good...better than their regular Pale Ale."
""
"Firm herbal bitterness, floral, lemon rind, rye and pale malt, lingering dandelion bitterness. Light bodied and a little bit thin, would be quenching on a hot summer day for sure. Hope to revisit in warmer months."
""
""
"Overall: I am impressed by this one. not overly complex, just nicely balanced and well done. certainly would be happy to have one of these when I am in the mood for a pale or just a refreshing beer. I hope its around for the summer. I would like to crack a Red's Rye open and see how it goes. I think I have to give the edge to Founders but this isn't fair behind."
""
"Overall – A nicely hopped rye with lighter notes of wheat and a decent citrus showing. A little more refreshing then the typical rye IPA, but not quite as complex. A great brew to try (and likely try again)."
""
"A crispy, tasty, and refreshing ale that feels almost more like a lager. Nice helping of rye, though it would've been nice if it were more ""up front"" with it. Drinkability is great, but I could see this one getting old fairly quickly. Still a solid choice, though, but there are better rye beers out there."
"o - terrific beer, very refreshing. i'll be going back to this one."
""

"Slightly hazy gold color, leaving a shit-load of sediment behind in the bottle. The head is tall and densely creamy, slipping down to a cushy covering and heavy lace. Pleasant floral and spicy hop aromas, rye, citrus, and a trailing pale malt sweetness. A little more sweetness in the flavor, which is welcome to balance the hops. Zesty citrus and rye, green and floral. Medium-ish, crisp, and refreshing. I like it."
""
"Overall: This is a very good hybrid of an American Blonde Ale and IPA, with some rye flourishes. Refreshing and crisp."
""
"The ale pours a nice bright golden color with some yeast particulates suspended, plenty of carbonation, and is topped with a frothy, white head that leaves some chunky lacing is on the glass. Aromas are grassy, earthy, spicy rye, fresh citric hops. Tastes are crisp, grassy, earthy, nice dry spiciness from the rye, lemony citrus, while finishing bitter. Thin-to-medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Nice balance of flavors. Overall, I really like the rye in this one. Very crisp & clean. Nice variation on an APA with some rye. I'm surprised this wasn't released in the summer as I found it to be nice and refreshing."
"With all the rye beers out in the market now, this one stands up with the best of them. Really enjoyed the hop flavor that goes along with the rye flavor."

"This is a decent beer. The rye is forward and intense. and the hop character is very complementary. There are some subtle, underlying citrus and herbal notes as well. Though not terribly complex, I am impressed with its drinkability. I really enjoy a rye beer especially a rye beer that showcases the rye as the primary ingredient rather than a secondary element. This is worth a try for all rye fans."
"12 ounce bottle, Batch 11695, packaged on 1/14/2013. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a hazy gold color with an inch and a half white head. The head stays around a long time, and there's also a good amount of lacing. The brew smells like bready/grainy malt, rye, citrusy hops, and some grassy hops. The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also the addition of some light peppery spice. There's a nice bittersweet finish in this brew. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit creamy, but also refreshing with good carbonation. Would be a great beer on a hot day, but it's still good on a 25 degree day, too. I like this brew, I'd buy it again. $9.99 a 6-pack."
"O: a good beer. A bit one note, but this has to be one often most rye forward beers I've come across even if that's all there is to it."
""
""
"Light to medium bodied with soft carbonation. Finishes dry. Not a bad beer, but I would like it better if it didn't have as much bread and biscuit malt flavor to it."
""
""
"Overall I am more confused by this beer than anything. I like it but don't know how to review the thing. Probably wouldn't buy this if weinstephaner was available. Still Bells kicks butt and this is not a bad beer by any means."

"Smitten pits its supple sweetness against raw spicy notes for balance that shows both its seduction and its boldness."

"A new Bell's in six pack form..A straight to the point review IMO. If you like Bell's Pale Ale try this. It seems somewhat similar less hoppy add rye. A sweet bready smell. Taste sweet, rye at first followed by hoppy kick...overall I like it and I would try it again if I was in the mood for this style."

"Overall I haven't found one bells beer that I hated and even though I don't enjoy rye this one is very drinkable."
"Very light in body. Just a little syrupy in texture. Light flower hop bitterness and rye spice. Watery, toasted cracker with a little crouton dried bread crust. Easy to drink, spicey, bitter, but nothing special."

"The aftertaste is a nice lingering of the pine taste, again, more like an APA or AIPA. Everything about it gets better as it warms."
""
""
"Enjoyable beer. Bell's own description of the beer is spot on. Very earthy beer. It's definitely a unique take on the Pale Ale style. It also nails the rye aspect. The craftsmanship is there. I was just hoping for something a little bolder. This would be great for the summer."

"Overall: happy to have found a good beer that is both accessible and well done."

"Packed with flavor, but the citrus and bitterness don't allow other ingredients to shine. And the combination just doesn't hit my palate well."
""
"This new arrival pours a light bodied, very clear and bright yellow gold in color with a soapy one finger bright white head. The nose is light and hoppy with a moderate pine character. I could smell the beer the second I took off the cap. The flavors are great for the style. It's hoppy with a pine, floral, lemon aspect with a touch of malty sweetness in the finish, rounding it out. It drinks light in body and slightly dry and drinks very easily for 6.5%. Overall this is a really nice and lighter pale. This is perfect for warmer weather."
"Poured golden with a white head and good sticky lacing. Aroma is lemon and citrus hops. Rye is up front on taste, Some citrus and spices, mild hop bitterness. Crisp with moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Been more willing to buy rye beers lately and this has backed it up."
"Enjoyable beer as I was not expecting that much rye kick. Nothing substantially great, but if you are a fan of ryes you'll like it."

"But what did he end up saying when the last petal was plucked? Anyway, this stuff pours a clear gold populated by a steady suspension of floaties and topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises pine sap, leek-y grass, funky lemon rind, and a light dusting of rye spice. The taste generally brings in more of the same, though now the leek character is more of a dank/dark one, and there's less of a funkiness present, allowing the lemon to express itself as it sees fit. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a relatively dry finish. Overall, a pretty nice rye beer, one I could easily see enjoying a few sixers of over the course of its availability."
""
"Overall I like it... I want to love it but it won't let me... Good stuff though if you see it drink it! It's totally worth it..."
"Overall: A tasty beer, the rye toasty flavor dominates, but there is definitely a citrus hop presence up front in the nose and mouth. A good bridge between winter and spring."
"Worth a try. Very fresh and grassy. Hard to compare to anything else. Bell's continues to produce thought provoking beers in variable styles."

"O - It is an enjoyable beer."
""
""
"Things are a bit more happenin', flavorwise. But, still, it's pretty much like a boilerplate ryePA, only a bit crisper and lighter. Earthy malt, green hops, and then a bit of rye tang."
""
""
"An easy drinking ale. Prevalent but not edgey rye flavour, a decent pale ale level of IBU. Good drinkability. Floral. Cloudy golden colour with a good lasting head. A bit above average mouthfeel. Bottle from February 2012, thanks Steve.Rich, satisfying."

"O - Pretty good beer with a nice rye presence, but otherwise nothing really sticks out. Enjoyable, but not sure this warranted being in the 750 series."

"Overall a pretty boring beer, just Rye, and nothing else."
"O: Sure to find wide appeal. I might not be looking for more, but I like it. Tentatively recommended."

"The 6.5% alcohol is not noticeable. Solid beer"
"Beer is medium to light in body, a little grainy, a little dry on the finish, overall a nice beer but a little bit of a let down. I""d have it again though."
"Pours a light yellow color w/ a thin white head in my snifter. Average lacing on the side of my glass. Nose is rye, malt, citrus, hops. Taste follows the nose profile w/ the rye a little more present. Feel is light, well carbonated and crisp. A good example of a rye beer done well. Cheers."

"O: This was a good beer, but it really wasn’t anything special. Paired very well with the Pork Tenderloin, but on its own, I don’t think it would have been all that great. 3.5"
""
"Nice beer, the rye is light and zesty adding a hint of spice on the finish, melding well with the droning earthy hop which turn floral on the finish. Semi sweet cereal grains in the middle add great depth, and an untelling fruitiness in the back the while time. Zippy, fat cutting carbonation a great food beer."
"Overall fine, a slightly bitter-er summer beer."
"Pours a clear golden color with a thin white head and some spotty lacing on the way down. The nose carries some rye and a bit of light spicing. The hops are mostly floral and there is an earthy component as well. Nothing over the top. The flavor has a bit of rye and spice with mild hops. Light body and high carbonation. Body is crisp and fairly bitter. A nice, easy-drinking brew."
"O: overall pretty good, the people around me enjoyed it more then I did but it wasn’t bad. This RYE is worth a TRY... like that rhyme?"
"overall: fine, and certainly drinkable, jut not very exciting"
"It's not bad for a golden ale, and is actually an interesting take on the style, though I maybe could've used a bit more rye. If I hadn't known it was there, I might not have noticed."
"D-Nothing fancy but solid and easy to drink. A nice intro craft beer that is certainly a good summertime drinking."
"D= As rye beers go, this is a very refreshing and drinkable ale. Definitely pairs well with pub grub and is worthy for anyone who likes rye beers."
"Very good beer. Love to see this one in bottles, I can see this becoming a go-to summer beer in our fridge. Thumbs up."
"Drinkability: Definitely some nice hop relief here, although I generally enjoy bigger beers. I would like it better if it had a deeper flavor or was a little bit more balanced."
"Drinkability: Fine and dandy - a beer that doesn't pack too much of a punch in terms of ABV and it's got that really nice grassy, earthy flavor. I would probably pick this up in the bottle if I came across it as such."
"Drinkability: Really high. I like the lightness of it that's different from a typical rye beer, but it still has the characteristic full and satisfying graininess that I really enjoy."
"Easy to drink for sure."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer. I have unloaded nothing but hopbombs on my palate as of lately and this was a nice standout beer that I have enjoyed a lot. Drinks crisp and refreshing...almost too much. So much I got another one after I was done with the firsdt one."
"The beer is a good drinkable brew."
"Not bad. This definitely brought the crisp rye character but the alcohol was dialed up just just a tad to too much make this thirst quenching. This was worth a try though."
"D - Not a lot happening with this brew, but it does have a dry rye presence and a decent hop bite in the finish. Pretty average for Bell's."
"I am surprised that a New Yorker is adding a beer to the site. This beer was suggested to me by one of the workers @ Bell's and I was not disappointed. This was my first Rye beer. This beer poured a cloudy golden... cloudy is always a good sign in my books. The smell was nice but no overpowering. The taste was similar to a wheat beer but nicer. I will keep my eyes open and hope to try some new rye beers. Well done"
