"O- well balanced with just enough spice from the rye, a good deal for the price and one that I would try again"
""
""
""
""
"Definitely one of my favorite Rye IPA's. Golden hue with a slight tint of red. Beautiful nose with plenty of spices and earthy notes. The most remarkable thing about this beer is the balance of  all the different hops. Tastes of grapefruit, pine and a wonderful array of spiciness. Dry across the tounge. Give this a try. Doubt you will be disappointed."
""
""
""
""
"Can't rave enough. My favorite go-to beer. Balanced in all aspects, nothing that overpowers the rest. Simply perfect."
""
""
""
""
"A nice IPA.  Nothing great and certainly nothing wrong.  At this price point it is very good.  Not a lot of rye presence.  Bought in a mix pack."
""
""

"O: A well rounded, properly balanced IPA. Well worth trying, another strong offering from Harpoon."

"O - I had heard good things about this beer, but I have to say it was a bit of a disappointment.  The sticky grapefruit hoppiness is really quite enjoyable, but the malt is a bit too saccharine and viscous to give it a good backbone. The spice from the rye is under-realized, too. Sierra Nevada's Ruthless Rye is a far superior beer for the price point."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: One of Harpoon's best offerings, and doubtlessly their best hoppy beer I've had to date. Would recommend for Harpoon fans. 3.75/5"
"o.  Boarder-line outstanding beer."
""
""
"Overall- I really like this beer, I don't see it being sold often down in Georgia, but the next time I see I will pick up a few bottles."

"Pours a bright orange color with white head and spotty lacing. The aroma has a good blend of malts and rye grains, some fruity notes from yeast and hops round it out. The taste has mostly rye grain notes and a satisfying spice bite with the hops leaving the palate dry. Each sip leads to a need for another, and this beer was consumed in a matter of fact fashion. Harpoon makes decent, drinkable beers and everything is well in Massachusetts."

"O - pretty good offering from Harpoon."

"Overall I'll have to revisit this one if I see it fresher. Always been a fan of beers that incorporate rye so I'm a bit partial."

""
"O) A good brew. I'd drink another one."
""
""
"Taste is well-hopped, for sure, with elements of pine and citrus up front. The rye infusion comes through at the finish, with a spicy zing. A very nice and enjoyable IPA, even a few months past it's ""best by"" date! Worthy."

"Overall/Comments: I really enjoyed reviewing this offering and thought it was very well done with all aspects one would look for in a Rye IPA with a nice complexity to it. Classified as a Rye Beer @ 6.9% ABV. Consumed 10-22-2013."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 1/15/2014. Pours lightly hazy orange amber color with a 2 finger dense cream colored head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, orange zest/rind, floral, grass, pine, rye, toast, caramel, and floral earthiness. Very nice aromas with good complexity of hop notes and moderate malt balance; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, orange zest, floral, grass, light pine, caramel, rye, toast, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peace, floral, grass, caramel, toast, rye, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity of hop flavors with prominent malt backbone; with fairly crisp malt/bitterness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately creamy, and fairly crisp/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice rye IPA. All around good complexity and balance of juicy hop and moderate malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Pours a orange amber with a nice head that leaves a ton of lace.. the smell is floral hops with a hint of pine..maybe a little rye on the end.. the taste leaves a little more spice pepper rye but barley.. you also get the hops pine and flowers but not a ton of bitterness.. just a hit of sweetness in the beginning that comes on more while it warms.. the mouthfeel is pretty full.. a slight chewy.. wish there was more bubbles. Its a good beer but not a lot of rye more just a ipa.. pale ale.. still good"

"Pours copper in color with a finger and a half of head that took a while to dissipate completely. The primary note in the nose is hops with the rye secondary. The flavor is the reverse of the nose - the rye is upfront and the hops follow. There is a touch of sweetness on the finish followed with a dry spiciness from the rye and a mild hop profile."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very in tune with the style, but not a standout in the style."
""
""
"O - A very solid rye beer. Very nice looking, and features a unique combo of malts to give it a good rye taste, and a very light and pleasant amount of sweetness. The bitterness of the hops play very well off of this. I am looking forward to drinking the 2nd of these from the Harpoon Winter variety pack. Nothing I'd actively seek, but this is a good beer for any Rye Beer or IPA fans. Recommended."

"o- an IPA that does not taste like an IPA i expected. Enjoyable."
""
""
""
"O: The beer isn’t that difficult to drink for the style because the spiciness from the rye is not overpowering."
""
"Overall: IPAs are my go too brews and this one's a good one. 6.9ABV is hidden in the flavor, it's not upfront."
"Overall: One of my favorites. You can't go wrong."
""

"Just had a growler filled today at Harpoon in Windsor. I have had Rich and Dan's filled in a bottle a few times and its consistently a good not great RIPA. This brew fresh on tap is way different- Pours a amber coppery color leaving a generous head of foam. I immediately pick up on floral hops and bubblegum. Smell is not dissimilar from the taste- I pick up on bubblegum fading to more of a floraly flavor with a malty presence but not overwhelming. For being an IPA its not overly bitter but I may consider this one to be a bit ""chewy"". Overall this is a fantastic RIPA and I am enjoying this one way more on tap as compared to bottled. If you can try it on tap I would strongly recommend it , and if you like RIPA's I also recommend trying it fresh out of a bottle."
"O: If you just pick one up to drink casually its manageable however, its not a very good beer in my opinion"
""
""
""
""
"To be fair, this was strong but never really felt it. On its own, this beer was solid but I don't think I could ever figure out what this wanted to be. It's one I could easily down a few in a session, even though it's nowhere close to being a session beer. Experimentation can lead to brews like this that don't conform to a particular mold or style but lead to some tasty concoctions to enjoy on their own, and this was certainly one of them."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - For what it is, rye, it knows what it is doing. IPA seems like a side element, it is almost TOO balanced for its own good. Would recommend for rye fans, would not recommend for hop heads."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Solid beer, and I love the rye flavor. Truth be told, however, if you're not a big fan of rye flavor you might not be impressed with this one. I enjoyed it, but it didn't knock my socks off."
""
""
"Clear, brassy gold colored with a small, off-white head. Smells lightly hoppy...flowery and lightly oily with an easy a going all around spiciness and a touch of orange. Flavors of grapefruit and resin, subtle rye, caramel, and spiced fruit. Not overly complex or anything, but rather soft and easy drinking. Medium bodied with some added creaminess. Pretty enjoyable."
"Clear amber and medium to small head. Nice looking but a bigger head would be welcome. Aroma is fresh with light graininess, lemon, grass, spice, and earthy nature in general. Flavors are light sweet malt, spicy rye, and clean. Fairly simple arrangement...not bad. This is nice and refreshing. Texture is a little syrupy and body is a light medium. Pretty suckdownable beverge. Overall a decent choice but maybe not in comparison to other greater options out there."

"Hazy copper color with a huge head that fell pretty slowly and left good lacing. I don’t know what I expected in the ""rye"" part but the IPA part is solid. Nose is pretty good with plenty of malt character to lead you in, a touch of caramel and a solid rye. Taste is rye and spicy/sour with a little citrus, pine and grass. It’s a medium body malt and is well carbonated. It’s crisp and it’s not what you expect from hop flavor because it’s not hop flavor. It’s rye. Get it? It’s wry! It has a palate of it’s own and would be great with sandwiches. This was originally from the 100 barrel series but I had it from a 6 pack."
""
""
""
"Poured into becker pint glass. Slightly cloudy copper with a medium-thick white head that fades fast into a nice layer of foam that leaves nice lacing on the glass. Smells of spicy malts and some hops. Taste is just like you'd expect; spicy rye malt and bitter hops in taste and both through to the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is clean and a bit dry."

"O- An enjoyable IPA thought I don't get a huge amount of rye, just enough to poke around the hops. This beer could also use a little more hop flavor up front rather than just the finishing bitterness."
""
""

"M: creamy mouthfeel and highly drinkable"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This is a medium bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. It is a pretty nice IPA with the rye being very noticeable. There was just something about the strange melon notes and strangely strong focus on alcohol for being under 7% that hindered the overall drink-ability for me on this one. Regardless, no issues finishing the glass and I am very appreciative of the chance to give this one a try. Thanks again Matt."
""
""
""
"Overall not bad but I have had much better Rye beers and IPAs."
""
""
""
"Taste - yummy, yet flat. As you drink the beer the aftertaste builds with a nice musky grass taste, which is lovely, but I'm missing the up-front hoppiness that I love from IPAs. Good amount of rye flavor too, which I'm perceiving more as I'm halfway through this bottle, poured into a Sam Adams glass."

"A good beer but wish it had a bigger hop profile."
"O - decent, run of the mill IPA"
""
"O: Overall a good beer but would have to be in the mood for it next time the hops are very crisp and clean tasting with a nice IPA taste."
"In the grand scheme of things, this seems a pretty mild rye beer. Decent level of spice from things, but nothing that's really blowing my taste buds away. Flavor seems to drop off fairly quickly as well. Or at least sooner than I would hope for. Decent beer, but maybe I don't have the freshest sample."
""
""
""
"O: Crisp and refreshing beer here from Harpoon! More of a west coast approach compared to some of their other beers. This demands attention and can be a great beer to introduce someone to rye in beer."
"3.6/5.00"
"Overall: a nice rye IPA"
""
""
"Poured into a nonic a clear rich copper with a creamy-like one finger white head that never really settles,just some nice froth.Aromas have a nice spicy rye kick to go along with the citric hops,a bit of nutty malt is detected as well.Flavors start with citric and earthy hops wich is good but the rye doesn't quite stand out as much on the palate,there is a slightly sweet and nutty malt base wich holds up well to the hops.There is a nice creamy feel to the beer and it has alot of stuff going for it,a little beefing up on the rye malt and this beer would be outstanding,as is it's still pretty damn good."
"Overall: Not bad. Dependable Rye IPA characteristics. Would drink if offered."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A bit sweeter than I would imagine but this beer is solid overall. The rye and hop profile are both satisfying and keep this beer from being mediocre."
""
""
""
"Overall: this is a decent beer, but I don't think I'll be going back to this well anytime soon. Rye is a hard thing to get right; they are close here, but it's a bit over-fruity to me."
""
""
""
""
""
"... (Bah, who needs a not-really-all-that-witty remark to start a review, anyway?) This stuff pours a clear amber-copper topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises grapefruit zest, light banana, biscuit, and a hint of toffee. The taste brings in more of the same, with the grapefruit showcasing a sharp bit of its rind and most of the malty backbone's elements fading into obscurity in the back. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a decent RIPA, though the rye character is pretty much nonexistent, and the hops come across sharply dull. Still, it ain't all that bad, really, just not all that good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, a fair amount of rye character, and nice citrus notes. More sweet malt than expected."

"A very tasty offering by Harpoon. Color is perfect for a rye beer. Just dark enough to see the colors of this interesting grain. Not overwhelming though. Nice spice and floral hops in the nose. Mouthfeel is medium. Flavor is a combination of spice and hops. Really nice. Had this with some good cheese and it was a perfect pairing."
""
"i liked this one, thought the rye was quite subtle, an accent rather than a dominant flavor, which works really well in this ipa. it pours a lighter coppery color, clear as day, with a medium white head about an inch tall. the nose is spicy rye malt, bready but light, like breakfast, with a ton of citrusy hops, bitter and pungent. i really like the taste of the hop blend here, its oily and sticky, without being sweet in the slightest. lemon rind and rye meet in the middle somewhere, and the result is quite refreshing. body is a little fuller that i want it to be, id struggle drinking a 6er of this, but the carbonation is lively and it drinks pretty well. this to me is a perfect winter ipa. id like to see the malt bill cut down a little bit to reduce body and let the glowing hops take over a little more, but the way the rye plays off the fruity notes is just splendid. a really well balanced beer."
"Overall – Really good stuff.. probably the best beer I've had from this brewer. My bottle was best before Nov 15th, so I can imagine this is even better fresh. I'll keep my eyes out for a fresh bottle."
""
"Overall a tasty full bodied IPA."
"Overall: Big fan of this beer, but then I am a sucker for rye. I'd consider buying a case of this, and I'd enjoy drinking it regularly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I remember liking this but I don't remember liking it quite this much! They've either tweaked the recipe and really honed in on it or I'm just forgetting how great this beer has always been."

"Overall: This is a really nice rye IPA that I recommend you give a shot. I will certainly be picking it up again."
""
""
""
"On tap at The Office. Pours orange with a long lasting, white head. Aroma is of orange fruit, citrusy hops and biscuit malt. Body is medium and tangy. Taste is similar to aroma with citrusy hops dominating biscuit malt, orange fruit and rye spiciness. Long grapefruity finish. Fresh on tap, very nice IPA."
"A flavorful beer, filled with minor flavor flaws along the way. A little rough around the edges, but a good starter recipe to craft."
""
""
"O: Certainly a solid beer, but not very IPA-like. All the hops really do are add some aroma and bitterness. I guess the strength and ale qualities qualify, but it's not typically what one would expect in terms of hop flavor. Worth a shot if you like rye beers, though"
""
""
""
""
""
"D - A very nice beer from Harpoon... Stellar appearance and solid in all other facets... I would gladly drink this with regularity... My only real complaint was that the rye component only translated on the palate and not the nose..."
"overall a nice beer. not an eye-opener by any means but solid. enjoyed at an end-of-summer clam bake on the cape and it hit the spot."
""
"O: Nice beer here, nice mix of a solid ipa and a malty rye. Worth a try."
""
""
"As a rye IPA, it misses the mark but as a straight rye beer it's pretty solid"
""
""
""
"O - decently good rye beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty nice one, here. Adequately malty and balanced by a good showing from both the American hops and rye."
"O: Now that its in six packs this is likely to become my go to IPA, its a toss up between this and flower power, great job by harpoon on this one"
"notes; drinkable, refreshing. A nice change of pace beer."
""
"o - this is very light and very tasty. The more I have it the more I want to drink. The cycle continues."
"Overall: At the end is of the day this is a good beer, but i was expecting more rye malt in the taste."
"12oz. bottle served in my Harpoon IPA glass. Best by 8/15/12 indicated on the neck of the bottle - got this one in right under the wire. Pours a dull, burnt orange-copper with a loose, half inch, off-white head and a slightly hazy clarity. Head eventually dissipates into a broken slick that coalesces around the shoulders of the glass. Some delicate strands of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose initially expresses pine and citrus before yielding a hint of caramel and earthy malts. Taste is earthy malts and hops with a slightly bitter and medicinal finish - all the nuances of the nose seem to drop out of the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a crisp carbonation and a light, palate-cleansing acidity. Overall, a bit lackluster. Not something I need to revisit again."
"Mouth feel is about medium. It is pretty easy to drink."
"Interesting rye brew, I enjoyed it. Again, more hops would have been great, but I did get that chewy rye grain flavor, which is a good thing."
""
"Definitely more interesting than their normal IPA, with a deeper range of flavors and more hop aroma and flavor. Still needs a boost in the hop flavor department. The rye keeps things interesting but almost drags the beer down with its rough, spicy flavors. Enjoyed one or two, but wasn't sure I was ready for a third because of the rye."
""
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the amazingly balanced nose. It smells just as you would expect for a “Rye IPA”. The flavor is not quite as robust as you would expect, but this guy still hits the style on the head in every department, making for a nice prototype for this emerging style."
""
""
"Above average rye ipa from harpoon. vibrant orange color with large bubbles, yet not overly carbonated tasting. i detect dusty grains and rye on the nose, some english/east coast fruitiness. ale starts off on the fruity side, and then progress into a dry, bitter finish. the rye is more subtle on this one than something like the ruthless rye in my opinion. quite drinkable at almost 7%, though the mouthfeel was slightly oily."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" I really like how this takes a little bit of influence from Harpoon ipa and adds a new dimension, the rye adds to the spice flavor of the hops which are bitter in flavor and a little citrus tasting at times too. I like the gentle orange rind element with hints of pine and the malt adds a nice caramel tinge in the back end. Overall I was pleased with this ipa, pretty solid for the style and enjoyable with a nice rye presence."
"O: Havent had too many Harpoon's and thats a surprise since I'm from MA, but overall a quality IPA and a nice take on the style!"
"I liked this beer... Extremely solid and one that will be a staple while the hot weather lasts..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall quite enjoyable, even if the taste profile doesn't hit all the notes, it seems the feel gives those notes just the right amount of ooomph to dig. Yeah.. I am liking this one."
"Overall Harpoon really does make some good beers and even though I don't love rye beers this one is quite drinkable. Worth a try!"
""
""
""
""

""
"Harpoon got this one right. I'm not a huge fan of rye beers but this one hit the spot. Would recommend to friends."
""
"Lovely. This is an excellent beer that melds two of my favorite style in a complex yet drinkable beer. Great rye presence, vicious hop bite, great flavor. Big winner. Love it."
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass, best by 8/15/12. Pours a slightly hazy dark orange, with a one inch sticky white head that leaves a nice collar of lace on the glass. Smell is tangerine, pineapple, and grass. Taste is similar, some carmel and Rye in the finish. Body is medium, plenty of carbonation, a touch dry, and easy drinking. I first had this last year at Harpoon's 25 fest. This is very nice and will be in my fridge often now."
""
"Do I enjoy this brew? Yes. Would I buy it again? Yes, preferrably on-tap if I can find it. Would I recommend it? Yes, to a lover of rye beer and English IPAs. 4.0"
"Pours a hazy pale orange-ish color, with an off white head. In the aroma, citrus hops with some pine like hops. In the taste, pine hops with a nice rye and apple dryness. A small bite, but mainly smooth, with a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry green apple sweet and pine like hops in the aftertaste. Nice hops and a nice rye presence, very nice!"
""
""
""
"Pours medium copper with semi thick ring of white foam. Evident lacing. Strong rye nose. Taste is a thin malt that evolves into a bitter hop/rye blend. Very dry. Open is almost water-based and the rye lingers. good./"
"Poured a 1/2"" custard yellow head with decent lifespan. In masstone it looks like tea but held to the light there's a pretty hazy burnt orange color. It smells richly of piney hops. Taste matches the smell and has that sort of sour bitter rye bread taste you get from rye. Finish is pretty subtle. Pretty good all around."
"This is a very good Rye IPA. I'm glad that Harpoon has decided to release it in 12 oz bottles. I imagine that it will find it's way into my fridge somewhat regularly."
""
"O - I enjoyed this brew because of its own take on the style with flavors and feel that appeals to me. I'd have it again."
"Being that I tend to love rye beers I was a little let down. Way too much yeast and not enough rye characteristics. Just an ok beer."
""
"O-A nice Rye beer, Ruthless is much better, carbonation needs to be toned down a little bit."
""
""
"From the 12 fl oz. bottled version rather than the 22 ouncer, which is the way it was first released. Best By 8/15/12. The pour is a pretty standard copper-amber color with only a short lasting head that dissolves to a ring and a topping of foam. The aroma is alive with floral and piney hops which overpower everything else although there is a little grainy character in there. The body is in the medium range and rather smooth but not creamy. The taste also brings forth a huge hop character with a biting bitterness at the end and some grains. Nothing sweet here. It will linger for a bit after it is finished."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I’m really glad they put this beer in 6 packs. It’s not that I dislike the normal Harpoon IPA, it’s just become such a staple it’s almost routine and boring at this point. This beer completely reinvigorates the style. The rye is the perfect touch that gives it that little extra bite that makes the beer nerd in me happy."
"Overall not bad but nothing to write home about, doesn't really do anything wrong but doesn't stand out in any specific way, pretty much at all. The hops are pretty light overall with some bitterness on the finish mostly but could have used a lot more aromatic and flavorful hops, the malts are nice but a bit on the sweet side, and the rye really doesn't come through until towards the end."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good beer. I would like to compare it to the 12 oz offerings that are now available in 6ers."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: One of harpoons best 6-pack offerings, and one of their most flavorful/interesting beers. I liked this better than SN Ruthless Rye. Great value purchase and I'd definitely purchase again. Def better than regular IPA."
""
""
""
""
"This is crisp and refreshing. A very nice IPA that showcases delicious spicy hops with the rye flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not a fan. I love Rye IPAs, not sure what happened with this one."
"Gratz on the 25 years, certainly a good stab at the Rye IPA style. Big and hoppy equals fun and the house character keeps it interesting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is not quite as good as it smelled, unfortunately. Lots of rye bread with a ton of near-burnt toast. Hops show plenty of both bittering and flavoring...kind of piney and floral. Not bad, not bad...big rye, big hops. I think Harpoon accomplished what they set out to do with this one, although for me the results are just decent, not lip-smackingly delicious."

"The Rest: Body is medium, and overall this is a decent beer. I'm guessing its the rye, but there is a definite unusual grain note in the taste that I was picking up that I couldn't really place."
"Overall: this is a decent rye focused beer, but after finishing the bottle I was looking for something a bit bolder in flavor. Good for a pint or two, not really sessionable for me."

"It's not a terrible beer, but it's not something that will make you say, ""Hey, this is a damn good beer."""

"Overall an enjoyable version of the IPA style with a solid malt backbone to backup the bitter hop kick. Could use more layers in the hop flavor but still a beer I'd drink more than one of."
"A cloudy yellow-orange brew with a small head that clings slightly to the glass. I found the nose to be a welcoming rush of floral and citrus hop notes and fresh cream. The taste was a little disappointing - I enjoyed the rye and grain flavor, accompanied by hoppiness; but it was not as complex as the aroma suggested. I'd rather have a Founders Rye PA."
"Overall, a decent beer, but a little unbalanced. The malt is a little light for the hop character. I like most of what's going on here though. From Harpoon, I wish this was more available."
"Overall: a great beer. I bought quite a few bottles of this because I had it on tap and wish I would have bought more when they where around. I shared a bottle with my old man who isn't into rye beers or I.P.A.'s and enjoyed it to the point where he was pouring another glass for himself. A great brew that created great memories."
"It's like an IPA with some spicy rye malts. Otherwise, it's a very good beer."
"This is a nice IPA with a rye touch. Drinks well - an enjoyable brew!"
"Almost feels like you aren't drinking an IPA at all. This beer is so airy, crisp, and smooth. It kind of feels like a pilsner or a light ale when it hits your mouth. But then you go through a series of taste that is incredibly definitive. First I felt like it was an APA, then the rye comes in, and finally the additional hops at the end to take to the imperial level. It is amazing how the hoppiness stays with you but isn't dry or overpowering. All in all, this is by no means is a session beer but I feel like I could drink it all day long. Light, mellow and tasty. Well done gentlemen."
"A great example of the style."
"D - Overall a solid beer. I probably wouldn't get it again, however, given the price and the fact that there are better rye beers out there. Pretty good showing from Harpoon, though. I just disagree with the mouthfeel, but obviously they chose to make it that way and I think the fact that they decided to take a risk and make this beer thick is pretty cool. Respect, Harpoon."
"O: This beer is almost a case of Jekyll and Hyde. What we have at the moment of drinking this beer is almost completely different from what is tasted between sips. One is bitter and clean tasting while the offbeat, between sips taste, is mellow and semisweet. This beer is therefore almost more of an experience than it is a beer--but it happens to be a damn fine beer too!"
"On tap at Moxie's. Poured a slightly hazy copper stained amber. Visibly effervescent with a deep frothy collar with decent hang time and impressive Belgian lacing. The smell is aggressive and complex; fruity citrus and grassy hop blend. Really added a lot to my overall impression. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, has a hoppy tang and is nicely carbonated. There is an enjoyable resin aftertaste that lingers appropriately. The flavor mirrored the nose and had the grainy rye character that i've come to expect from rye beers. Overall a very fine drinker. I'd recommended it."
"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass, the beer pours a bright, vibrant goldenrod color with a tall, frothy, light bubbled head that quickly recedes/settles into a decent film. It also coats the glass quite well as the receding occurs. Citrus blends the aromas, and stays strong throughout the nose amidst the smokey and grainy characteristics, along with a subtle background hopping. The flavors are heavier in citrus aspects initially, but quickly blend with a roasted grain and dry hopped flux of flavor. The blend actually keeps the overall flavor profile lighter than most IPAs. The aftertaste is more of the resiny characteristics of hops, with a strong jolt of bitterness, and it translates into a drying finish that is somewhat smooth at the same time. Well blended flavors and a light, smooth body make this a refreshing brew."
" Bring on more ryeIPA's!"
"O: A nice beer that is well-brewed but lacks a little character to push up into the tier of exceptional beers."
"A hazy golden grain color with a sturdy one-finger frothy white head and luscious lacing. The aroma brings a pleasant citrus tinge with a grainy sweet biscuit theme blended nicely. Almost a subtle spice idea here. The flavor comes on with orange-lemon biscuit and oats. It’s wonderfully creamy in feel with a tasteful tingle of carbonation. It settles in with a slight orange peel clove and a reasonable rye overtone that maks for a very decent brew. Nice. This is quite drinkable and a smooth IPA with a nice bitterness."
"Appearance is light amber in color and slightly cloudy, but certainly toward the clear end of the spectrum for IPAs. Aromas were of fresh grapefruit and lemon. Predominantly grapefruit citrus hop flavor, with a bracing metallic finish. This is a very dry and clean drinking IPA with very little sweetness. It would be great food beer."
"Good rolling bitterness that doesn't scorch the palate or linger too long. Rye maltiness is noticeable but fits right into the flavor profile. Somewhat dense body for an IPA, rye tend to be viscous and I assume that's why. Really easy drinking for a close to 7% ABV. I truly impressed by this beer. I think I can easily say its the best beer I have had from Harpoon. Just my opinion. This beer is right up my alley, I love rye beer and I love good flavorful American IPAs."
"This beer was refreshing and very tasty, I would definitely have it again as it went down easy and completely hid the alcohol. Quite enjoyable and a beer that I recommend trying."
"O: Overall, this beer delivers what I expect in a Rye IPA - freshness! Every ingredient that came through tasted fresh and crisp. That rye bite really kicks the taste buds from beginning to end and provides a solid malt backdrop to the citrusy and floral hop dominance. Harpoon delivers a very solid effort on this limited brew. If you dig rye bite and hoppy freshness, this beer is for you!"
"Draught: This one poured a darker golden color with a bit of an amber hue. There was a good sized off-white head on it, that left a good deal of lacing. Grapefruit nose with a bit of pine. Some rye also. The taste is good. This one is fairly bitter, with grapefruit and pine hop tastes most prevalent. Some rye taste coming through also. Not a bad beer!"
"O: It was ok before the oxidized flavor hit, but even without it, I probably wouldn't go for it again. Thought that the rye was a bit weak as well."
"Overall: A solid flavor mix with the rye coming through nicely."
"D - This beer has a very nice aroma with a juicy, fresh hop flavor. The bitterness is harsh, but the flaovr is otherwise nicely balanced, though not as pungently hoppy as the aroma implies it might be. The rye character is a high point since it is strong enough to be noticed above the other flavors and doesn't get lost the way it does in so many other ""rye"" beers."
"This is perhaps the worse sampling of the 100 Barrel Series I've had to date. Harpoon has shown time and again that they can do better than this...much better. I eagerly await the next."
"The feel of this beer is big with a heavy feel to the body that makes it a beer that may get loose on you. It goes down smooth but is something like a heavy weight when it hits bottom then releases that heavy feel at the end."
" Overall great drinkability smooth interesting can't feel the 6.9 percent alcohol."
"Third beer on Sat night at Penguin Pizza. Served in a standard pint glass. Dark orange colored body. Nice sized white head. Smell was hoppy and peppery. Flavor really packed the hop punch, as it had a plethora of IPA hop flavor bursting at the seams. The addition of the rye had positive and negative effects. I liked the rye for the flavor, as it lent a spicy and smoky flavor to the taste. What I didn't like was the effect on the mouthfeel. It made this beer way too dry on the palate. Would have been a struggle to enjoy a few of these. I liked a pint of this beer, but I would not make a night of drinking this brew. Not smooth enough and too high in abv."
"O: A pretty good rye beer, though the hop profile really falls flat. The rye grain adds enough character to save the beer."
"Notes: Might be a little over the top for some, but I enjoyed it. One of the better 100 barrel series entries in my opinion."
"A nice rye beer that lacks some of the rye emphasis and malty backbone that some of its counterparts possesses, but at the same time has great traditional IPA characteristics."
"this is a brisk one and quite a chalk dry feel on the tongue. a bit lighter than most rye. orange almost clear with a just very very slight off white head. nose is pine mineral with wort sweet undertone... very subtle. the palate is similar in that i seem to get a interesting earthy and not as sweet as most. but there is a hint deep deep in the finish... if you're drinking it alone of fruit orange preserve. nice bitter earthy hint. mineral touch. rocky not earthy. interesting water character. solid but not exceptional. like the series none the less. reminds me of the smuttynose IPA but broader... and just as dry."
"Between the Imperial Rye and the 100 Barrel Rye there's a lot of rye floating around at Harpoon. They must have gotten a good deal."
"Overall, this is a good IPA, though problematic in that the rye flavors are not as prominent as the label would suggest--indeed, not knowing this was a Rye IPA, I wouldn't have necessarily known rye was in it. And the heavy alcohol in the aftertaste did become overwhelming after about a third of the bottle. Still, the hoppy tones are delicious, and there's just enough spice to give the beer a welcome kick. Worth a try, but don't expect to be blown away."
"Opinion: Overall this is a well made beer, but the recipe is off a bit to showcase the Rye. I believe that they were going for spicy complexity in an effort to compliment the Rye malt, but instead they they took away from it with the hop bill. All that said, this is a decent beer and I have no desire to pitch it or anything, so it isn't bad at all. I would just adjust the hops if I were them to something more American than Belgian."
"Cheers!"
"Taste starts sweet, lemon and spice in the middle, and pine hops comes on for the close. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is good as well. Rye adds a nice twist to the IPA style."
"Overall, a really good rye beer that hits the spot. High recommend. Avail here in TX. Rotation - one time release so will probably grab another before it goes away. Tap if I can find it. [O;Y]"
"this thing comes out a nice orange with a big old fluff top sportin' three fingers. the fingers stick nicely. the nose is mostly rye / piny hop fest. its basic but its good. taste is similar as well. starts with a rye upfront and finishes with pine hops. its decent but just about that. a little too basic for my tastes. a light bodied brew with medium carbonation good puckering. overall its not bad but its nothing to write home about either. still glad i got the chance to try this one."
"Not overly impressed with this one. Its good but nothing really stands out. The hops are more bitter than flavorful."
"O - Not a huge fan of this, it went down easily enough, but that was more for lack of taste than anything else."
"O: A very drinkable beer with no real faults, just doesn't blow me away. I would buy it again. Would like to try this on draft."
"O: Not bad at all, don't let the score scare you. It's just pretty simple and plain. No strong smells or flavors, not much complexity. Just a pretty simple IPA with some rye. Like a weaker and blander Hop Rod Rye. Not an insult to this beer, more of a compliment to how good Hop Rod is."
"Nice rye grain flavors and decent bitterness but not a lot else going on and I'd like to see more hop flavor / aroma."
"Would drink it again."
"The flavor is aggressively bitter with hop resins, but not so much as to leave behind a medicinal twang. Rather, the spicy rye character in the grain bill finishes with a snappy, dry malt note. The medium-light body is crisp and dry on the palate, with a tight carbonation level. Overall, a good beer from Harpoon. A little unbalanced, as the delicate fruity citrus and yeast esters in the aroma are almost overpowered. Still, it's tasty."
"The beer pours a beautiful golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a mild pale and rye malt scent. It's light with a touch of spiciness. The hop aroma good. It's not incredibly bitter, but it balances the malt aroma nicely. The taste is good. It's really smooth with a mild hop bitterness. The malt bill provides adequate complexity and balance. The rye also lends a subtle spiciness that compliments the hops. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer. It's easy drinking, yet flavorful; an accessible rye ale."
"O- Overall, I was so excited that Harpoon decided to brew a Rye IPA. Not so much anymore! Not a bad brew just not very special. Not one I'd seek out but can see giving this to a buddy that is just getting into craft. Maybe not fair to Harpoon that two of my favorite beers are nelson and Founders, Rye IPA!"
"Edit: as this one warmed the metallic taste vanished but all that remains is an interminably long bitter finish, totally overwhelming any other subtleties of this beer. Come on. I like hops but there's no hop notes here just bitter, bitter, bitter. One dimensional."
"In conclusion, this beer seems to be yet another great option for IPA lovers, but for people looking for more of a rye profile, I would suggest looking elsewhere."
"Very good cookout ale, especially with game meat."
"O - I'd buy this one again, Rich & Dan's has some really nice qualities and for hop heads, it would be interesting if Harpoon dialed up the intensity of the aroma and flavors. This one is worthy of adding to the regular rotation of Seasonal or Year 'Round brews in their line-up. The 100 Barrel Series hasn't been ""as"" appealing (compared to the Leviathan line), but this beer is solid. Then again, I'm biased because the Leviathan Imperial IPA is by far my most favorite Harpoon beer...hands down."
"Stunning for an IPA as it's quite drinkable. But rye bother for the price?"
"Poured into a nonik glass, this is a fairly pale beer with a small head. The aroma is full of citrus hop notes--pretty normal for an IPA. Flavor is hop-dominated... in fact, there's really not any malt detectable. I can't pick out any particular rye notes, but it's very tasty none the less. It makes me think of a very clean wheat IPA as much as anything."
"Poured into a pint glass a Copper/red with a minimal amount of off white head. The aroma has a lot of the rye but also an equal amount of tropical fruity hops. A earthy/hay aroma is subtle after jostling the glass a couple times. Starts off lightly toasted malt with a hint of fruity hops on top but finishes off with a tangy rye bitterness. Medium body with a smooth transition of malty, fruity and bitter."
"Pours a clear deep golden almost copper color with a stingy beige head that dissipates slowly before attaching a fair amount of lace to the sides. Smells of grapefruit and citrus fruit mixed with a spicy rye twang. Lots of toffee and caramel in there to provide a backbone. Taste is pretty much what I expected from the aroma. Sweet caramel and toffee up front mildly spicy rye followed by less grapefruit and citrus than I expected. Finishes kind of dry with a long lingering citric bitterness. Reminds me a whole lot of Harpoon IPA, but a little creamier and a little rye added. Creamy smooth mouthfeel, medium body and carbonation level. I enjoyed this one there's really nothing wrong with it, but there's not really anything spectacular about it either. Good beer, but not great, glad I got to try it."
"Okay, this is strange, the first flavor I note is...pate. It's a meaty taste with a note of oysters. The hop takes over in the swallow without much more than a bittering effect. The body is as expected and the carbonation is mildly elevated."
"Appears a slightly hazed copper in the body with a billowing off white cream head rising above the edges of my Gulden Draak chalice. Chunky sporadic bands of lacing are left behind with each sip. This is a nice beer, full on citrus and spicy rye interplay going on in the nose. Enough base malt provides some bread/crackers balance to it, but big alpha hop brings the grapefruit pungency. Flavor wise it's banging with citrus hops and a bit of earthiness, which is blended nicely with a bready/spicy rye notes bringing out an herbal/grain note to it. Bitterness lingers in a good way on the palate, with nice slick hop oils flowing along, ample carbonation carries the body just fine. Overall between a nice brisk bitter IPA and interesting rye spiciness, this was one of my favorites I've had from the 100 barrel series in some time, pretty rock solid offering so solid that the founders of Harpoon threw their names on it."
"Medium body, a bit higher carbonation, prickly and dry. Not a particularly great rye beer, but drinks pretty smoothly. Definitely not in the same league as Nelson, Righteous, or Red's Rye."
"Overall, a tasty ipa which uses the rye as seasoning, not a dominate characteristic."
"Notes: The most forgettable 100 Barrel Series I have tried. I do understand that rye can be unforgiving and difficult to brew, and I have a slight weakness for it. But this goes neither here nor there. And while not something to send back the brew is quite forgettable for me."
"O: This is a wildly uneven beer. Not terrible, but not all that great either."
"Flavor as well combines the all of the elements very well to a great, balance beer that's a lot more interesting than the standard ipa and/or many other rye beers I've tried."
"O -"
"Overall, a decent IPA. Not spectacular but good. I really like the Harpoon 100 Barrel Series. It's interesting to see what there brewers come up with on a regular basis."
"Looks nice, clear gold with a fluffy, off-white cap. Lots of clumpy lacing, decent head retention. I got a whiff of grapefruit and grassy hops during the pour and wasn't disappointed once I had more time to contemplate the beer in the glass. There was a slight pine resin edge to the hops as well, plus mild nutty and bready malts. Solid bitterness, citrus pith and grassy hops in the flavour, some spicy hops in the finish, with mild malt bready/rye presence, minerals, and slight alcohol. Good texture, medium light in body with moderate carbonation, but it felt light and creamy. Overall, I enjoyed this one. The rye didn't add a lot, but I did like the hop character."
"O: The beer isn’t that difficult to drink for the style because the spiciness from the rye is not overpowering."
"I like this IPA. It has a lot of potential."
"Thanks to my friend Paul for sharing. This reminded me of Harpoon IPA for better or worse. The body was relatively light for the style, but it was by no means watery and on a summer day, I didn't mind. The hops and rye blend into a spicy bread floral citrus mix that's quite pleasant, but should be a bit richer for an IPA. It just didn't have the same kick as most ~7% hoppy ales."
"O: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, decent kick, very good representation of style, this is a very nice beer worth drinking for a while."
"Mouthfeel is sticky and full yet the finish is harsh and unforgiving. The rye and hops are too out of balance for my preferences. I love good rye beers and this is not one of them. If your going to mail in the malt bill you have to at least have late hops additions for nice hop flavors, but this doesn't have any. After making a lot of great beers in this 100 Barrel Series, Harpoon seems to have mailed in the last couple. If I was Rich or Dan, I wouldn't want my name attached to this beer... I haven't had a good drain pour in a while, adios #37!"
"Pours a moderate golden color that is mostly clear. Good white head and a nice bit of lacing on the way down. The nose carries a good portion of rye along with some floral and spicy hops. The flavor carries the same with the rye really taking a step forward and bringing a bit of spice. Mostly floral hops with a bit of an earthy feel as well. All is very well integrated into a medium-bodied brew with a nicely-bitter finish. Some alcohol detected afterward. This was a thoroughly enjoyable brew."
"O: OK at best. Won't buy it again, though it did improve after the palate adjusted to the metallic impression."
"Crisp and bubbly medium body mouthfeel. Overall, this is a fine beer but I do feel that Harpoon could do better. Something about the hop bill just doesn't work for me. Still though, I have no problem drinking it even if it wasn't quite what I expected."
"Pours a golden amber. Nice white head. Aroma is little bit citrus with a hint of spicy rye. First sip is clean, more piney citrus with that kick of rye at the end. I would like a little more of the Rye to give this a bit more bite. As it is its just a toned down IPA with a bit of rye in the background. THis could be a really nice beer with a bit of tweaking. Not bad, certainly an easy drinking summer IPA."
"O - Overall I was extremely disappointed with this beer. The most important facet of beer to me is the taste and this beer failed epically there. I suppose I had too high of expectations, but still...nearly a drain-pour..."
"D - Pretty drinkable. The finish is a bit heavy. The rye is a nice addition to the IPA. The hop profile is nice, but maybe just a bit too subdued."
"O- Harpoon did good with this Rye IPA. I am pleasantly surprised at how hoppy this brew is. I like this more then their regular IPA easily. Drinks very nicely. I wish it was cheaper ($7.50), but glad I tried it. I would get on tap if nothing else amazing available or priced well."
