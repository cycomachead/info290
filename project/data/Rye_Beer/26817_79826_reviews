"Cask on Tap Very Good"

"Overall, there were so many beautiful things about this beer.  From the look to the nose, it introduced itself and presented itself well.  The first whiff brought crashing imagery of Nugget Nectar to the forefront of our minds, although the flavoring showed much more bitterness from both the hops and the big rye grain inclusions.  The hops became frankly soapy, and when mixed and indistinguishable from the malts, gave a doubled bitter blend that was cleaner, but equally as robust as your west coast bitter hop bombs.  Very,very tasty.  The only negative thing about this one was its heavier feel and flow, but we suppose that is seasonally reasonable, and only minor given the wonderfully fresh ingredients, aroma, and taste."
"This beer surprised me. I got it in a taster out of curiosity and wasn't let down. This beer is very good. I picked up a growler along with a growler of Regular coffee."

"Finished off a growler tonight. Clear, nice color, good hoppy aroma. I mostly go for IPA and this is a worthwhile alternative. I will buy again."

"Overall: for those that enjoy red ales, the rye kicks it up a notch and creates an enjoyable beer."

"An interesting red rye. Not bad."

"Reddish-brown pour, with a lasting white head that left some spotty lacing on the glass. Aroma of toasted bread, caramel malts, citrus pith and piney hops. More of the same in the taste, toasted bread and grains, malty, with notes of citrus and pine, dash of cracked pepper, and a notable apple skin finish. Mouthfeel was crisp and quite drying, body was medium. Decent beer."

"Medium bodied with a prominent rye spiciness that adds another dimension to the slightly roasted and sweet malt flavors.  Peppery and spicy with nice rye flavor countered by sweet caramel malt, toffee, hazelnut and slightly roasted coffee.  Subtle hop bitterness compliments the rye before a dry finish.  Not overly complex but there's a nice spicy rue presence that's stronger than most beers in the style."

"Carton red rye. Pours a reddish light brown. Sticky foam. Clingy. Bready nose with rye thrownm in. Light open with a firm caraway hop flabor. Pushy bitter close. Open softer with a tight close. Good. Certainly lops of hops to please. 4 4 35 35 375"

"Overall a pretty tasty rye beer, although something of a stylistic hybrid."
"Probably the weakest offering from Carton that I've had so far. Several other awesome beers in their limited portfolio though. I could drink BOAT or Monkey Chase till I vomit down . Just a bump in the road."
"o - Overall a very good rye beer. Reminds me a lot of Founder's Red's Rye PA, though I like that one a bit better as it is a bit hoppier than this one. This one has more sweet dark fruits, which is a nice touch though. Would certainly have it again."

"Hoped with piney simcoe, cluster, and horizon hops, with a spicy touch of rye. Overall a very nice rye ale, comparable to my favorite, Founders Red Rye. A great option for hop heads and I continue to look for more great beers from this local brewery."
