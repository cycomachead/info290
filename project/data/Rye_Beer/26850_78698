4,11.4,4,4,4,4,4,"750 ml bottle into snifter, no bottle dating. Pours slightly hazy dark orange/copper color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, vanilla, brown sugar, light nuttiness, raisin, plum, fig, apple, bourbon, oak, herbal, light pepper, and yeast/oak earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, oak barrel, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, brown sugar, vanilla, light nuttiness, raisin, plum, fig, apple, bourbon, oak, herbal, light pepper, and yeast/oak earthiness. Light earthy/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, brown sugar, raisin, plum, fig, apple, bourbon, oak, herbal, light pepper, and yeast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity, balance, and robustness of dark/bready malt, oak barrel, and yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, moderately crisp, and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice English strong ale. All around great complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, oak barrel, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 16, 2014"

Dry mouthfeel, from the rye. It's not a rye bomb and it's thinner than I would have expected, but it's complex and fun to drink. Try this if you get a chance. I'm in NC, we hit Against the Grain last year... the brewers couldn't have been cooler. They're doing a great job of it now.","Mantooth","Jul 30, 2014"

It tastes like spicy rye, rye whiskey, caramel, dark fruit, wood, and some earthiness. It's mostly a sweet, malty tasting brew, but there's also a good amount of bitterness.

Aroma of caramel malt, rye whiskey; estery and spicy with a mild rye sourness. Flavor is rye malt, rye whiskey, oak, caramel. Big burst of well integrated malt and barrel flavors, but tapers off rapidly and finishes with more stark mild rye whiskey, almost like rye after sitting in a couple of melted ice cubes. Light residual hints of rye, oak and slight malt. Medium bodied, also seems to start with a mild creaminess, but finishes unexpectedly a bit light in mouth feel. An interesting take on a rye barrelled beer. The initial flavor and mouth feel are quite nice and promising, but it finishes a bit thin and much less flavor intensity. I'd try this again, but not in the quite pricey 750 ml bomber. Interesting, flavorful, but unbalanced taste sequence. The bottle is very cool but leaves feathers everywhere. I can't imagine unpacking a case of these.","LiquidAmber","Mar 20, 2014"

2.89,-19.5,3,2.75,2.75,3.5,3,"O - Part amber ale, part brown ale with some dark fruit, spiciness, and bourbon presence. The most enjoyable part is the rye spiciness that lingers on the palate, the flavors are a subtle blend. If you enjoy brown ales this may be a good match and worth trying, if you expect a moderately bold, flavorful beer, it's not.","jzeilinger","Jan 05, 2014"

The taste was a disappointment. There is no flavor on the front end or mid-palate. There is a nice rye whisky finish on the very back end. The thin body combined with oily mouthfeel and lack of flavor made this one a clear miss for me.","PHBoiler","Nov 21, 2013"

Smell is of malt, caramel, toffee, and fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with rye and caramel flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of woody bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some solid aromas and flavors but I am not getting any real barrel presence other than some slight woody aspects.","UCLABrewN84","Oct 28, 2013"

I supposed I was spoiled when my first ATG beer was the De Molen created Bo & Luke. Too many avg to poor beers have come after. Cool bottle - but don't rush out and buy this. That being said, rye flavor is very nice tho. no booziness - ABV is hidden quite well. Must be in that Chiquen.","weonfire","Sep 21, 2013"
