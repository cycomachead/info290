"o; A tasty IPA with more citrus than spice for a rye.  Here the rye seems to have affected the brew more by adding body rather than spiciness, which is fine considering the more evident dominance of hops.  Substantial and enjoyable."

"For a rye based IPA this one is exceptional.  Looks great, smell is subtle citrus aroma.  Taste is extremely well balanced and very complex for an IPA.  To explain, the rye/grain is noticable up front, then it gives way to a citrusy hoppiness and finishes very sweet and smooth without much bitterness at all.  This may be one of the best rye IPAs I've had to date.  Excellent."

"Rye is very prevalent (in a good way). Smutty hop bill is still very much there.  Earthy but very drinkable."
""

"Taste is similar. Firm rye spiciness backed by hops and a surprising residual sweetness. A little too sweet for my tastes and I'm surprised to see the notes indicating it was mashed lower than Finest Kind IPA. Otherwise a nice balance between the rye and hops. Firm bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a medium level of carbonation."

"Very good beer.  Golden/orange color on the nose.  Nice grapefruit on the nose.  Good hoppiness.  Enjoyed this beer."
"I little tropical on the hops.  not a ton of rye coming thru but it is a tasty ipa"
""
"Another great beer from Smuttynose, they nailed this one."
"Cloudy golden in color with tropical fruit and citrus coming through the nose.  Sort of a dominate grapefruit in flavor with a slight tan head and very minimal lacing.  Light and smooth with a creamy feel and no aftertaste and acceptable bitterness.  Refreshing and very easy to drink.  Poured into IPA glass and relatively fresh.  Overall, another fantastic offering from Smuttynose!"
""
""
"Caramel orange in color with a fingers worth of khaki head.  Citrus, tropical fruits, and caramel aroma.  Taste is very similar to the smell with a light spicy rye finish.  Moderate body and light to moderate carbonation.  Overall very drinkable, rye is a bit light, but is overall another very good beer by Smuttynose."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nearly clear light amber hue, sexy lacing down the glass. Dank citrus nose. Subtle hop bitterness, more of numbing hop resin with a kick in the palate from the rye. Kickin smoothness, lush medium body. Easy drinking for a beer closing in on 7.0% abv. Bitter finish, on the dry side. Bold and wanting more sip to sip."

"9/11/14...pours a rusty orange amber. Thick pouring white foam. Lots of lacing. Rye tinged pine nose, good aroma. Mellow malt taste bursting into a juicy biting hop. Light sweetness."
""
""
"Far more dry than the smell indicates--the obvious presence of rye.  I think this makes the hop more pronounced as well.  Dry, nearly astringent finish that creates a very long aftertaste.  Neutral body with a heightened level of carbonation."

"Overall pretty nice, a really interesting combination of flavors and aromas, nice big spicy and slight fruity rye, great spicy earthy hops, little fruity citrus note as well, and that really interesting caramel toffee notes. Quite enjoyable but not a pounding beer, def a long night sipper for a bomber. I also love that they actually give all the details of the recipe, which is pretty nice."

"So this is a mixed review but a warning to me. Don't buy it again, Bob."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, 2013 vintage bottling. Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a 2 finger dense and rocky white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, orange rind, apricot, floral, grass, rye, biscuit, light caramel, light pine, and floral/grassy earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with balanced hop and malt notes; with decent strength. Taste of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, apricot, orange rind, pine, floral, grass, biscuit, rye, light caramel, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of grassy/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, apricot, floral, grass, light pine, biscuit, rye, light caramel, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity of citrus hops and balanced malt flavors; with a crisp malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, smooth, and fairly sticky/crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice rye IPA. Good balance and complexity of citrus hop and rye/bready malt flavors; and smooth and crisp to sip on. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Pours a clear amber with huge dense white head.  This thing is structural, undisturbed it might never settle.  Glass finishes coated in thick sticky rings of lace.  Smell is very perfumey... floral,  grapefruit peel;  apricot,  bready and caramel  notes.  Taste:  grapefruit blast fading into astringent  and grainy flavors.  Light caramel.  The rye  comes through but it gets a bit monotonous."

"How about that gobbledygook? ""Our Rhye IPA bulls it's way into our lineup because we love really hoppy beers and were looking for an opportunity to play with rye malt and add a big boatload of hops. Would a rhino enjoy the big flavor? We don't know, but let us know if you found out."""
"Hazy gold with a soapy white cap, fluffy with clumpy lacing and good head retention. Strong aroma of hops and malt, fruity and spicy with nutty notes. Sturdy bitterness that lingered in the finish. Fairly clean flavour with nutty malt, a bit of spice and quite fruity. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, a bit creamy and off-dry. A solid beer."
""
"This beer was decent but the rye malt wasnt spicy enough and the hops were to bitter for my tastes."
""

"Poured into a Black Raven pint glass. Pours a medium golden amber with a massive, fine off-white head that continued to grow for several minutes after pouring, pyramiding above the glass. Tons of lacing. Nice aroma of citrus and floral hops, citrus and light stone fruit and caramel malt. Flavor follows aroma with a nice bready malt body, citrus hops with light herbal and piney elements, light sourness from the rye. Well balanced. Finishes with a grapefruit rind citrus hop finish and lingering hop bitterness. Great creamy body and the head is so thick and substancial it was was like whipped cream. A very nice rye IPA that leans more towards the citrus IPA end of the taste spectrum, with the rye adding nice spicy, tart notes. I liked this quite a bit and if Smuttynose was available here, I'd get this again in a heartbeat. And that's saying a lot because local Rueben's Brews is making world class rye beer a few miles from here."

"O: Everything I expect from the style and from Smutty. Absolutely delicious and a pleasure to drink."
""
""
"D: This was a decent rye IPA, but the scent and taste weren't anything special, and the body was weak. The finish was smooth enough, so at least it was easy to drink. Don't feel bad if you never try this one."

"O: A solid beer overall, though a bit too bitter. I'd like the hops to stick out a bit more as well."
"Big on flavor but light in body, the beer covers a lot of ground because of its sheer complexity. Fruit, spice, grain, sweet, bitter, bread and pepper are all represented in exact proportion. Where its rustic nature is celebrated because its a part of the complexity it also distracts from the smooth hop bitterness."
"Aggressive. I like it."
""
"Nice big head of around three fingers, very even surface even with a full spectrum of bubble sizes, dark eggshell white in color, nice retention plus the lacing is quite thick and sticks like glue. The liquid itself is a paler orange to yellow gold, has a sort of metallic sheen to it, fully transparent and shiny with extra tiny bubbles rising quickly within. The nose comes on first with tangy white grapefruit to mandarin orange notes, followed closely by dried grass and hay and then veers into cocoa powder and flowers, minimal breadiness but what’s there is country style, very light pineapple, peach to nectarine fruit scents. Medium-bodied, the carbonation seems creamier through the mouth entry but afterwards tends to prickle in support of the bitter herbaceousness and hoppiness. Peppery with some saltiness too, any pine or flowers come across as dried in nature. That said, there’s juice in the sour orange to lemon citrus. The rye clearer here and helps fill the blank spaces left by the spotty mixed white fruit component. Minor maltiness peeks out by the end, cocoa and caramel. No alcoholic heat but it is fairly intensely bitter which can create a similar impression. Just seems attenuated and lacking in volume and palate weight, especially at the end."

"Light copper orange in color with a heavy chill haze. Poured with a solid, billowy white foam that reduced to a wispy cap that left sheets of sticky lacings on the glass. Fresh citrus grapefruit and spicy rye aromas, fresh pine in the background and a pleasant sweet maltiness beneath. Medium bodied with aggressive, but soft carbonation, and a tangy feel from the middle to the end. Citrus hoppiness up front followed by spicy rye malt through the middle that transitions to light pine hop bitterness to the finish. Citrus hop flavors up front that are quickly subdues by spicy rye maltiness. Rye flavors are strong through the middle until light pine hop bitterness takes a bite at the finish. This is one of the better rye beers that I’ve had. The rye malt aromas and flavors are the spotlight, never outdone by accompanying malt and hop characteristics."

"Appears to be muddied orange with a gold glow. (Yeast poured in). Head is modest and leaves a nice foamy layer once it fades. Shifting lace strings and spots. Aroma is sweet, flowery, fruity and peppery. Lemon, tropical something, decaying pine needles, rye aromas and grains. Flavors match. Complimentary rye and hop bitterness that lingers. Pine resin crystals....and earthy too. Mouthfeel is pretty spectacularly tingly. Fluid and foamy. The bitterness continues to push on through. Perhaps a little tooo bitter but overall, yay Smuttynose!"
"Solid golden orange with a bit of haze with a thick, lumpy white head that sticks to the glass. Fairly subtle floral, soapy, and oily citrus aromas. More spiciness as it warms up. Citrus pulp, some piney resin, yeast, and a pleasant addition of spicy grain in the finish. Medium-fullish body with a nice creaminess before a dry bitterness wraps it up. Some sweet toasted, almost biscuity notes, but the bitterness all but buries it. Pretty good, not sure how old the bottle is. Lots of bitter, spicy qualities, but I'd love a little more diversity in hop flavors and less plain old aggressiveness."
""
""
""
"My conclusion is somewhat confused. It seems like a beer that just didn’t do anything well, almost tasting like an 6 month old IPA. Maybe it was, I don’t know, because the only dating was the notch under 2013, but I won’t visit this one again."
""
"D - Good one to try!"
""
""

"Attention brewers: this is how you marry rye with hops. They're beautifully balanced, aggressive, tasty as all hell. An excellent work of art."

"O - excellent example of a ryed IPA. I may buy this one again."
"Overall: Pretty solid rye IPA from the Portsmouth boys. God to see thus is a year round offering."
"I was on the fence initially, but I love the mixture of big bold hops and spicy rye. Really good, as usual from smuttynose."
""
""
"Don't get me wrong. This beer is bold and a worthy purchase if you love rye beers. I could see myself drinking it more often."
"O: $6.99 for a world-class rye beer? Gimee, gimee, gimee!!!"
"O: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, good kick, decent representation of style, this is a solid beer to drink for a while if you want something slightly different."
""
""
"A zesty little number, packed and well-balanced with warm, soothing grains with hints of citrus fruits in the aroma and finishing with a pleasingly biting spiciness and hop bitterness."
""
"A nice spicy rye malt IPA. Easy to drink, tasty and good complexity."
"The good part is this is hugely drinkable and refreshing. A great quaff with modest bitterness and tangy gulpability. From the 22 oz bottle purchased at Olive Tree Market in Ocean Beach."

"O: A solid IPA that reminds me a lot of Sierra Nevada’s Torpedo (which is most definitely a compliment). The balance in this beer comes through to create a meshwork of interconnected flavors; so, while I wouldn’t exactly call it complex, it’s certainly a rich, palatable brew."

"This beer was a huge disappointment. It had very little hoppiness and not a lot going on at all really.  This was my first beer from this brewery and thus one doesn't have me clamoring for more of their beers.  This beer has pretty good reviews on this site.  Maybe I got a bad bottle?  Aroma was weak and flavor was the same.  Very subtle for an IPA.  Not how I like my IPA's at all."
"Not a fan of rye, not a fan of bitter, but the hop character is nice. Not a bad beer at all, but not my style."
""
""
"O: Overall, this is a great variation on rye beer/IPAs. The beer comes of as hoppy, yet still easy to drink. Very nice work to Smutty again! I hope to find this on-tap/next time I go to the store."
"In all catagories, this is an exceptional example of the hybrid rye-IPA style."
""
"Pours a hazy gold with a foamy orange-white head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest and slight rye flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a nice citrus forward hop presence, but the rye aspect is quite subdued in my opinion."

"on tap as a guest beer at Amherst brewing. this pours a greyish shade of light brown, funny looking and cloudy, with only minimal white soapy head. the nose is heavy on the rye, more bready than spicy, but robust nevertheless. also well hopped, dry hopped obviously, with some residual oil and bitterness to boot. the taste is actually lighter on the rye malt than the smell, it just accentuates the other malts. the hops are real aggressive, plentiful, and bitter more than anything else. I get some high alpha varietals, but I also get some more subtle English stuff, it really works. light and delicate for a rye beer, because of the grain. it drinks easy, and the higher alcohol is well disguised. nice in the early fall, smuttynose continues to impress me. rye beer is boom or bust most of the time, and this falls on the right side of that for sure."
""
"O-The IPA part of the beer was spot on. The Rye part wasn't. More rye to help out the balance and the beer would improve greatly."
"O/D-A great beer. I really enjoyed the hop bouquet here. Pretty complex in my view. Love the label too."
"The taste has an full floral and citrus taste but it is not overly bitter. It is moderately bitter and the bitterness ends dry and lingers briefly on the tail end but it is not overly so. A great variation on the rye IPA style."
""
""
""
"T: Pine under a blanket of caramel and toffee malt flavors. Spicy rye near the middle with a good amount of bready malt. The peppery rye shows up on the finish with some light pine resin. A really solid beer."
""
"This is a solid Rye IPA. Fans of Finestkind will like this one. The aromas and flavors are decent, but the craftsmanship is what really sells this beer for me."
"On the fuller end of medium bodied with a crisp hop bite up front that lingers over the spice and sweet malt backbone into a slightly dry finish. The rye is very prominent with a nice spicy, zesty flavor that nicely compliments the dry, earthy bitterness of the hops. Hop profile is a bit one dimensional but still has nice flavor. The malt backbone is huge, much stronger than I prefer. Lots of caramel, biscuit and toffee. Good for balance and blends well with the rye but it takes away from the hop flavor a bit too much for my preference. Still, this beer is very dry and bitter with spicy, grassy hops and dank pine needle character. Overall a decent tasting beer but I don't think I would seek it out again."
""
""
"o - Overall a decent DIPA; some nice citrus hops throughout and definite rye in the nose. Worth checking out."
""
""
"Poured from a bomber into a shaker pint, the beer is a hazy, bright, orange-gold color with a frothy, chunky, clingy, off-white head. Nose of toasted grains, heavy rye, and a citrus/tropical blend that is tangy and balancing. Flavors of toast and earth forward, with a solid bitterness following, both resiny and fruity. Peppery and grainy end-feel into a spiced and subtle citrus aftertaste. Light, slightly effervescent body. Dry, bitter, and spicy lingering finish. Solid, well balanced beer."
"O: This is good stuff; like oranges and rye in a beer."
"Delicious hop punch bouncing all over the mouth just enough sweet notes to keep it lively but mostly bitter. Definitely get herbal, grapefruit, orange on the bitter side with slight floral, mango, and malt sweetness hidden in the intensity."
""
""

""
""
"Very nice."
"Pours into an impy nonic a dull hazed burnt orange infused medium golden with a terrific tightly formed one finger craterous white head that is not fading in the least bit,just great.Big grapefruit rind-like hops jump out at ya in the nose along with spicy rye,I like the fact that the rye plays a big role,lately some of the ""hopped up rye"" beers I have had leaves me wanting more rye.A fresh citric hop blasts greets the taste buds with the spicy rye coming in right afterwards making for a nice 1-2 punch,a firm lightly sweet bready base compliments the beer with the alcohol creeping a bit.Maybe the best Smuttynose beer I have had,this is what a big hoppy rye beer should be,fantastic."
""

"22 ounce bottle, stamped with ABV 6.8%. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a hazy golden orange color with about an inch and a half off-white frothy head. Head retention is excellent, and there's a good amount of lacing. The brew smells like citrusy (orange, grapefruit) and pine hops, and spicy rye. I think it tastes like the aroma, but with a good balance between the rye and the hops. There's also a long lasting bitter finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and has moderate carbonation. I liked this a lot, and it's priced well at $5.99 a bomber. I'd buy this again!"
""
""
"O: A very solid rye IPA with a great balance between both the hops and malt as well as the amount of rye used. Easy to drink to go along with the great balance. Great value as always from the Smutty BBS, so definitely worth trying"
"O: I really enjoyed this rye beer because it was very bold and spicy yet remained drinkable. No traces of alcohol are noticeable in the taste."
""
""
"O_I like this more as it warms. A nice mash up of rye and IPA."
"Pours a slightly hazy light golden color with a huge off white head that persists forever. Aromas of spicy rye, onion, garlic, and pine with a very subtle and almost completely hidden light bready malt. The flavor is spicy and lightly tart with huge pine and onion flavors and just a hint of malty sweetness. Long lingering spicy and hop bitterness persists long after every sip. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick resinous mouthfeel. Really nice spicy hoppy brew!"
""

"Excellent rye beer. Hope to find it on tap as well."
"Taste has a bit of toasty malt sweetness to start, but then shifts gears quickly. The rye spiciness is right up front, and the hopping is solid. It has a good background of resiny citrus with a hint of pithiness added for good measure. But the rye still sticks around to the finish, which tends towards the dry side. Quite nice, indeed! Nice work (again!), Smutty! Prosit!"
