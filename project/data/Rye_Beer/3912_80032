4.06,0.7,4,4.25,4,4,4,"This is a tasty little number! I've enjoyed it before, but I was working in my garage so I didn't give RPA the attention it deserves. This beer pours with a deep orange hue, a bit cloudy, with a finger of tan head. The nose is lovely - plenty of floral hops that give a nice hint of what is to come. The taste is everything that a quality brew should be - layered and ever evolving. The malt, rye, and hops blend together and each layer pops out at you as you taste it. This beer plays out like an IPA with a nice dry black pepper finish, and the rye adds a delightful twist. This is an awesome brew that is worth seeking out!","Bunman3","Dec 17, 2014"

It was enjoyable and refreshing albeit an intense experience and would definitely pick up again if I were in the mood. Keeps getting better the farther you get into the glass.

4.47,10.9,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.75,4.5,"Final Grade: 4.47, an incredible A grade. Worth the wait - Cameron's Rye Pale Ale is probably the best IPA I've had in the last year or so. The spicy, peppery feel imparted by the rye malts is the perfect companion for the intensely citrusy, earthy flavours of the hops, making for an excellent brew that is certain to please the palates of hopheads everywhere. This is easily the best Cameron's beer I've yet tried, and something that the brewers should be extremely proud of. If this is available regularly, you'd better believe I'll be buying plenty more, as this is definitely a new favourite for me. The perfect choice for my 500th beer tick on BA - and on International IPA Day, to boot!","thehyperduck","Jul 25, 2013"

3.15,-21.8,4,4,2.75,2.5,3,"Final Thoughts: This is my second Rye beer, and it certainly fared better then the first. That still being said, Rye beer does not appear to be my cup of tea. It's like an IPA with the hop kick spread out a bit more, and the sweet malt replaced with it's rougher rye cousin, which I would say is the best piece of advice I can give if you are drinking your first rye beer. Standard beer is toast, and this beer is rye bread toast. Regular toast tends to be sweeter the bread because the sugars in the bread caramelize. However Rye bread toast doesn't really do it quite as well, because, well I dunno, I guess there is less sugar/it's hardier? Either way, rye malt seems to have the same characteristic as there is next to nothing remotely sweet here, which makes for something different, it's just not quite what I'm looking for. Glad I tried it though.","TheHammer","Jul 22, 2013"
