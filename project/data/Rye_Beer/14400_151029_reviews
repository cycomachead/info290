"Overall, I enjoyed this.  It's nicely balanced."
"O:  A good drinkable rye."
""
"Nice beer. Bite of rye and hop bitterness. Banana and nuttiness. Solid take on a rye beer."
""
"Mouthfeel is thick, heavy, a little gritty. Overall, not bad, but too sweet for me."

"22 oz bottle purchased from Roth’s Sunnyslope Market in S.Salem OR $4.59 Darker amber/garnet coloured ale with a large thick and creamy light tan head. Malty solid coffee .spice and a bit of hop nice. Taste is like the aroma but with a bit more rye spiciness. Nice soft bodied ale. Good beer in moderation."

"it started out with almost no smell at all, the taste was very sweet with caramel vanilla malt and then went extremely bitter making it not that drinkable. maybe if I aged it for some months or years the bitterness will go away and it would be a wonderful beer I still love Ninkasi one of my favorite breweries"

"This beer is a mess, I know rye is difficult to work with but offer a better product, wasted $5.99 on this drain pour."

"Wasn't quite what I expected, but its still quite good.  As long as you keep an open mind and don't let your expectations guide you I think you will like the journey.  I got lots of dark fruit, toffee, brown sugar, bark, burnt malt.  Mouthfeel and body were a bit thin.  Spice apparent on the aftertaste, but not much Rye in the mix flavor-wise.  Overall, definitely worth a try."

"A quite well done Rye Beer. Tasty, unique flavor without becoming too much."

"A lot less flavor than you would expect from an imperial rye."
"Overall not a bad beer but maybe a bad bottle."

"Some may find this overly sweet. The right at beer at the right time can make all the difference. I can sort of get the Roggenbier comparison."
""
"Amazingly clear for a dark beer, a nice tan head led to lacing that  clung the entire glass, mild malty smell. The rye didn't really standout , great caramel taste.  Malty taste but a bit thin body, good residual bitterness. A nice special release,"
""
"Overall I am pleased with this brew, and can't wait to see what new stuff they come out with. Devil went down to Oregon is a surprise that most beer geeks will appreciate."
"This seems like a beer that isn’t quite the sum of its parts. I’m glad I tried it, but I’m not terribly impressed and will be unlikely to try it again."
"It's a quality brew but I wish the rye came out more."

"This is an interesting brew. It's malty but the rye adds that sharp edge. Not as spicy as many rye brews. From the 22 oz bottle purchased at Whole Foods in Portland, Pearl District."
""
"Not getting a whole lot of West coast love from this brew, which is fairly indicative of this brewer as a whole, but at least there's an excuse this time.  A generally agreeable offering overall, I suppose, but the particular grainy maltiness makes me want to seek out any and everything else next."
"Darn good beer yes sir"
"(*) sorry, it's actually a 3.76 as I write this... 0.02 above the average rating for all beers in the database."
"Overall: if you really dig ryes, this is definitely worth a try.  For me, though, I think it's one-and-done."
