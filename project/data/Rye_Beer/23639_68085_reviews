"Rye spice compliments the hop profile rather well. I feel like this is a bit underrated because it isn't a tropical citrus bomb but I find it to be a well brewed ale."
""
""
"The taste also has a grainy, grassy taste with that lemon bite."
"Quite a quaffable brew and well made.  The rye having just a bit more flavor profile would enhance the beer, but otherwise I enjoy this one."

"O: the perfumy hops need something to balance them out;"

"Clean, refreshing, light hoppy and a revelation. One of the best pale ales from New England. Taste doesn't linger too long on palate."
""
"O - This was great.  Not overly complex but a good light and dry rye ale.  Would make a great barbecue sixer."

"O: Not a bad beer but nothing to notable. Not worth the higher price per bottle ($3)."

"Overall a very crisp and aromatic pale ale, the rye is noticeable in the flavor but less so in the aroma with a crisp dry mouthfeel."

"Overall: An interesting pale ale/rye beer with a lot more lime taste to it than I had anticipated. The rye is there but it is faint. I have had better from this brewery, but I would not turn this down."

"O: This beer is quite drinkable and the use of rye adds a twist of spiciness to the finish."

"The beer pours a pale orange color with yellow highlights. The beer forms a smooth, creamy white head of medium sized bubbles, and it is replenished by a maelstrom of bubbles racing up like an upside down snow storm to replenish the snowy head. The head sits at a healthy finger’s width above the beer, and it does not fade away… Ever. It leaves a lacing of fat clouds, made up of tightly knit dry bubbles. This beer is pretty to look at. On the nose, the beer smells of juicy pine with hints of grapefruit and a subtle rye spice that hints at grainy bread. The hop smell also gives off surprising hints of juicy citrus, moving from orange to slight pineapple, and then back to grapefruit. On the tongue, the beer tastes dry and bitter with some light acidity and only the faintest kiss of sugar. In flavor, the beer begins as light spicy rye with lovely grapefruit accents which eventually eat up the light rye flavors and move into a juicier flavor with hints of pine. The finish returns to big beautiful rye flavors with pine accents that work together beautifully and slightly suggesting bell pepper flesh on the tongue. The aftertaste is a tingly sense of rye malt and slight bitter hops. In the mouth, the beer feels medium in body with a phenomenal carbonation that provides a lovely fluffy scrub to the tongue and keeps this beer nicely dry and sippable. The mouth is left dry but clean, with some slight spittle forming from the hop acids. Oddly, this light spittle seems to help quell the bitters of this beer and balance it nicely. Overall, this is a lovely flagship beer, and a really nice lawnmower beer as well. They need to throw this thing into cans or a six pack so that people can sip it in canoes or on top of mountains. This is just a solid, American, hop-forward rye beer. It is a little harsh on the hops, overall, and some more rye character would not be a bad thing, but overall, I like this. Good beer."
"Glad I shared this $7 bomber with a buddy because I didn't find the 11 oz in my glass all that inviting. When I don't look forward to the next sip with anticipation, I know it isn't a beer I'll spend my money on a second time."
"First impression is dry and bitter. The starting malt is muted. Relatively thin. The aftertaste lasts a long time--peppery bitterness."
""
""
""

"The beer pours a clear, watery looking golden yellow with a thin white halo of head that offers mild lacing. The nose is a touch spicy/hoppy with a sweet backbone. However, the flavor brings forth a lot more rye and hops that play off eachother to create a spicy/bitter phenomenon. The mouthfeel is relatively sweet initially that transitions into a bold, spicy bitterness. There is a lingering sweet, hoppy aftertaste. It reminds me a lot of a less citrus-forward hopped rye of the tiger. The beer is worth trying once, but it's not worth another pint."

"22oz. bottle: This one pours a clear golden color. There is a bit of a foamy off-white head on it. Decent nose. Piney hops are the most prevalent. Some floral notes also. The taste is also good. A bit bitter, with no real sweetness. Pine, as well as some spiciness. A medium malt body. I’d have another."

"O: this is a pretty good pale ale, especially if your a fan of rye beers."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Good beer, If you are just getting into IPAs, this is one to start out on. It gives a good overall IPA flavor without the huge punch of intense hops."
""
""
"O/D-Far better than their IPA. A hoppy Pale with plenty of rye. Could stand to be a bit less expensive for a bomber, but overall, I am happy with the purchase."
"O: This is a great American Pale Ale. The marriage of rye and a nice spicy hop profile is a harmonious one. The brewers weren't afraid to get a little creative here, but they didn't stray too far from the style. The result is a beer that colors outside the lines a bit, but still retains that classic APA feel. Tasty, nuanced, and creative. Great stuff."

"Finally tried the Daymark last night. I think I've found a rye beer I like! Daymark is an exceptionally well made beer, with great balance. The earthy, bready rye comes through, but it is still a crisp, drinkable ale. All Rising Tide beers are made with a lot of care, and it is no surprise that Daymark is their flagship beer."
""
""
"As an APA, this was ok. There was a metal after taste that did not appeal to me. Reminded me of Sam Adams Noble Pils."

"Browned orange with a big white head. Great retention and lots of lacing. Nose has some lighter orangey/citrus notes, grainy breads, rye and some sweeter bready malt character. Taste has a drying grainy rye bread character, bitter citrus notes and light cracker and spicing. Medium mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. Bitterness is overpowering to the point where it detracts from the beers. An OK pale, but bittering is too aggressive for my liking in the style."
"Fresh bottle from Maine. The rye and the Centennial and Columbus combined make this a very bitter beer, even astringent. Would like to distinguish the rye spiciness if I could. The bottle says a pale, its not that. It is more malty with sediment on the bottle and grows on me as far as drinkability, but it is also a palate eraser and harsh."

"O: A great anytime beer, and nearly perfect for the warm weather. The hops and rye malt compliment each other extremely well"
""
"I will look for this beer again, as well as others from Rising Tide Brewery."
"O: this is a good beer. I have been enthralled by the appearance. I would have this again. I will ask this: is this a Rye Beer or an American Pale Ale? Whatever, it doesn't matter to me."
"If you see this beer on the shelf-- grab it- you'll be pleased with it."
"A lot of good pale ales coming out of Maine as of late. Daybreak is equally as good as Spring Peeper, MO and it's other hoppy pale ale neighbors."

"Pours dirty bronze with 2 inches white foam. Quite puffy. Laces a lot. Pine and grass nose. Spicy. Lemony. Lighter malt taste, with a subtle hop. Some bitterness hangs out at the end. Quite mellow, but with full flavor. Light rye in the background that would almost be missed if not written up."
"This poured out as a hazy yellow color with a huge white foamy head on top. I tried to pour this as slowly as possible but it didn't seem to matter. I gave the head some time to settle before pouring the rest of the bottle in the glass. The head had a good retention and lacing. The smell of the beer was very lemony, the rye gave off a nice little spice note in there as well. The flavor of the beer was pretty good also. The rye and citrus seemed to go pretty well together. The other flavors of grains balance the beer out a little. The mouthfeel was on the lighter side and had a nice crisp bite in the finish. Overall it's a pretty good brew if you enjoy rye. I'm not a huge fan of it but I felt that it worked well with this beer. I would say it's worth trying, I can't say that I'd buy it again though."
"The mouthfeel is on the lighter side of the style with carbonation being moderate. Overall it was a pretty tasty and easy drinking beer. The rye flavors really came out in it. Pretty solid beer overall."

"22oz bomber purchased at Trader Joe's in Portland, ME. Pours a very hazy yellow-amber body with a good inch of persistent off-white head. Hops dominate the aroma, with orange, grapefruit, and pulp notes. Orange, pulp, lemon, with strong spice notes from the rye. Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Rye beers are not my favorite style, and I didn't realize at first that that's what this beer is. That said, it's pretty good and among the best rye beers I've had."
""
""
"O- This was a unique take on a rye beer mixed with a pale. A great aroma and appearance, but though the taste was a bit disappointing. Definitely worth trying though."
"Liked this one. The hoppiness of the brew with the spicy malt really made this a good one. This is a summer brew? This should be a year-rounder (and since I bought it in Nov., it looks like it is!)."
""
"dark pour here, dark garnet brown with a huge tan head on top. Slow receding left tons of lacing down the sides of the glass and really gave it a very nice and very complete look. Aroma is huge, lots of spice at first, caramel, molasses, hints of brown sugar and earth, deep hops. Warming brings out some touches of dark fig like fruit notes but nothing like that warm rye touch that really adds to it. As I take the first sip a really wave of caramel and light peppery rye hit the tongue. Light notes of chocolate that come over it wave after wave. Really quite complex and I have to admit not at all what I was expecting. Still very well done"
"Overall, I think this is a great take on a rye beer. Quite a pleasant surprise. My wife said is has a nice little ""zing"" to it and I agree - the citrus notes and light sweetness accent rather than cut or drown the bold hops out. Recommended."
""
"O - Nice surprise here. Its a very enjoyable balance of hops and malts. Would definately buy this again. So far all the Rising Tide's I've sampled are solid. Would continue to buy from this brewery."
"Overall: I love this one. Dry, floral, light in the mouth, local ingredients. A great beer. Keep it up, up there in Maine."
"Overall: This is a really good beer that could be great if the finish fit the rest of the sip a little bit better."
"lots of fun. very easy to drink and refreshing. loved this. only beef is the massive head in the pour."
"o - overall, very impressed with this beer. it is a great pale ale with a subtle hop forward sweetness."
"Overall a solid beer. A little less carbonation and a little less from the hops and this would be a home run. That being said it is enjoyable as is and I wouldn't mind throwing back a bunch of these."
"A great-looking and -smelling beer, but just too unbalanced for my taste in Pale Ales."
"D: Would happily drink another. This is a crisp and refreshing pale ale with a lot of grapefruit character. Plus, the bottle logo is pretty cool."
"Picked up a bomber back in May while visiting Kennebunkport. Poured into a stemmed beer glass. Way over carbonated. It foamed way up in the glass, and while I was tending to that, it spewed out of the bottle and all over the table. Unfortunate. Once it settled down, I was able to continue. Hazy sunshine yellow color with a fine white head. Smell had a pungent aroma of tangy hops. Taste was excellent. Lots of spicy hops, but a bit of malt to help things out, then a nice dry crispness at the end. I liked the mouthfeel a lot - very fresh and assertive. This is a very nice beer that I enjoyed a lot and was glad to try, except for the overflow accident."
"Overall.. wow I am a fan!! This is easily the best Rye beer I've had, although it tastes like a very distinct American IPA."
"Mouthfeel is light and crisp and plenty refreshing for a nice summer rye beer. Overall, this is my first beer from Rising Tide and I enjoyed it quite a bit. I love a good rye beer but have been rather disappointed with many I've had recently so I'm glad this one came along."
"O - On a warm summer day, this is the kind of beer I'd want. The rye keeps me from drinking too many, but it's incredibly refreshing and a great rye pale ale. Definitely bringing a bomber or two of this home with me."
"pretty impressive. nothing is out of proportion. balance is key. a touch of rye, a touch of hops, a touch of sweetness -> gone."
"A floral, juicy pale that serves as a nice addition to the Maine beer scene."
"What a surprise to find such a unique flavor and delicious beer. Most of my favorite beers for the last year have been small, unknown, local breweries. Add this one to the list. Highly recommended, thank you Mr. Matazz!!!!"
"Pours a hazy wheat color. The color of golden raisins, with a tight stark white head that laces a bit, but doesn't cling. The head settles quickly. The dry hopping gives a good whiff of hops up front. Herbal and fruity. A clean crisp ale, that hits you with a wall of bitterness. Bitters linger deeply in the dry finish. Herbal dry hops with an alcohol kick. Initially, it was a bit much, but you settle into it, and begin to look forward to the next bitter wave. A creamy mouthfeel makes this enjoyable to drink. For some reason I'm thinking of bitter white grape juice fermented with stems. Rugged. Hop oil residue coats the mouth. Peppery spicyness in the back of the throat lingers along with the dry hop. A complex concoction."
"Well, the first fault comes right off at the start - body is a bit low, I'll attribute this to the rye, carbonation is nice and does make up for a lot of it. There's a solid hop/rye bitterness that bites at your pallate. Finish is a bit harsh in the bitterness but it's still tasty and fairly easy drinking."
"Decent feel here. This one is a little sticky and the body is a bit heavier than I would like. Nice soft carbonation. Overall this is actually a little dissapointing. I have some bottle of their other offerings so I'm hoping those go better. Damn, this one kind of broke my heart. Maybe I got a bad bottle, so the next batch that I see I'll give it another go. I'll rereview if I need to."
"Another very solid beer from Rising Tide, I like that they brew accessible beers with their own little twist on things."
"Overall – A very enjoyable beer that is extremely drinkable (quaffable if you will). A great amount of flavor for “only” being 5.5%. If they sold this in a six pack, and actually where I live, I would for sure get some of these to have on a hot summer day."
"A nice hoppy APA. Rising Tide does it again."
"I really love this beer. There is a lot of hop flavor that goes well with the rye malt."
"Hoppy pale with rye? Sounds right up my alley. Pours bright yellowy orange, lots of bubbles and a nice thick white head, lacing the glass on the way down. Aromas of floral hops, fresh fields, and bread. The hops are very up front here - grassy, bitter, soapy even, very dry. This is backed by a nice doughy and yeasty body, with nice bit of spice and heft from the rye addition and a slightly fruity finish. Crisp and light on the palate with just the right bitter smacking. Definitely my fav of the three so far from this new Maine brewery."
"As a local, fresh beer, this one is top notch. I can see myself enjoying a few of these this summer. And though the beer lends itself well to summer months, I don't think it would be unwelcome at cooler times. This is definitely a beer worth checking out."
"Overall a good beer nice to have on a hot day."
"D: Another winner for Rising Tide. Nice crisp, easy drinking pale with a twist"
"Mouthfeel is top notch. The rye adds a nice amount of body to a beer that you wouldn't expect to have after seeing the color. Carbonation is perfect, and the finish is on the dry side. Each sip leaves you with rye flavor that lingers for a while. Overall a very well done beer with the perfect amount of rye flavor and smell."
