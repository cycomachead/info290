It has the rye spiciness that I was looking for without any extra sweetness. I sometimes think that an extra hop kick could make it even better, but, overall, it's a good and sessionable rye beer.","beermeplz","Jan 26, 2015"

Out of the 12oz releases from the Speakeasy brewery this might be my favorite.  give this beer and any other beer from this brewery a try.  if you're ever in the San Francisco area this is a really cool brewery to visit, excellent vibe and friends service.","Totalpackage411","Dec 28, 2014"

Mild, but classic red ale aroma of slightly toasted caramel malt with light grassy hops, supplemented by rye bread notes. Flavor is toasted and caramel malt, grassy hops with light sourness and rye grain. Medium bodied with nice carbonation. A nice red ale that is somewhat light on the rye, but fairly well balanced.

A rather light, nondescript aroma for a rye beer as I get a little bit of roasted and sweet malts, along with citric hops and rye, but nothing really going on here and it's a little odd. Smooth, easy to drink, this isn't a bad beer in my opinion but it just seems to misfire. The rye gives it a little dryness and heartyness, and the sweet malts and hops are in there and balanced but as I finished my glass it was more grainy and harsh than anything resembling sweetness or hoppiness. A good beer but not one of the greats.","clayrock81","May 26, 2013"

3.36,-9.2,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Overall: A pretty flavorful session beer. I wish the rye had a bigger role in this beer and I also feel that the carbonation is too high for this ale. If the carbonation was dialed back a bit, I think the malt and hops would have a much bigger playing field to interact with each other on. It definitely is a good session beer to have while watching the game with some friends.","flayedandskinned","Dec 09, 2012"

3.88,4.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Mouthfeel is thin and watery, with mild carbonation, a light body, and a slightly bitter finish that fades clean with rye trailing and making its mark. The aftertaste is clean, yet funky like cardboard, so this has some different qualities to it. Overall this was much better than I expected and quite easy to drink; borders on a session beer for me. This lady is legit and one I will seek out again.","CHickman","Beers"

3.38,-8.6,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was its refreshment and coolness on the sip. This was definitely darker in style for a rye beer, with generous attention given to the malty backbone. The flavoring, however, was washed to the buds, and you actually lose a lot of the rye, and sweetness of malt. There was interesting phenolic bitterness, which helped to keep you interested, but really not enough when coupled with the lighter nose to make you refill your glass with the same. This all eases up with heat, making it more refreshing, but again, it is not enough.","TheBrewo","Nov 05, 2012"

3.58,-3.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall - Somewhat disappointed, if only because I've been so impressed with Speakeasy beers in the past. This one's not bad by any stretch, but if you're looking for a beer with strong rye character, you might want to look elsewhere. Not a bad beer, but doesn't necessarily deliver on the promise of the label.","TheSixthRing","Oct 28, 2012"
4.15,12.2,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"This beer is definitely the younger/lighter sibling of their imperial red ale. I think this version works more effectively—I love rye ales, red ales, and at this ABV I could have more than one. Whether in a bomber or sixer I’d love to see this on shelves as well. A winner.","elNopalero","Oct 27, 2012"

3.53,-4.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Clear, amber/ red ale with sticky white head that barely covers the top. Lots of copper caramel malt aroma with some chalky chocolate. A little bit of weedy, green, wet hops with a swirl. Taste starts with roasty chocolate and coffee. Not too bitter, but smooths out the drink towards the end. A little bit of metallic/blood flavor in the middle for good measure. Spiciness of rye is there, but barely noticeable. Handled the grain well IMHO. Dry finish, balanced MF. This reminds me of an unimperial version of Betrayal. Very good and sessionable. Would be good in the fall with these flavors. I wish they released this in six packs.","Philousa","Aug 30, 2012"

3.78,2.2,4,3.5,4,3,4,"Overall I would like to try this bottled actually, I'm wondering if less of the hoppy notes would come through, as well as if the carbonation makes a difference. A decent rye beer, which is great since the rye selection is small.","lsummers","Beers"
3.83,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours a clear copper with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Thick foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, rye, caramel, and herbal hop aromas. Taste is much the same with a slight toast/roast flavor and an alcohol kick with each sip. There is a mild roasty and hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink.","UCLABrewN84","0"
