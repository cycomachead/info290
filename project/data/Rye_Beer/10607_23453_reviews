"Gorgeous amber hue with the richest and stickiest head I ever did see. Great spicy and bready aromas with some nice resinous notes as well. Flavor is spot on, like drinking a loaf of rye bread. Toasty hearty grain notes, spicy finish, long lasting bitterness. One of the richest and thickest bodies I've ever experienced, takes away from drinkability a little but an incredible beer none the less."

"Just cant see this being a style I'd ever consider ""go-to", but I think Sixpoint does a fine job here."

"Mouthfeel is on the smoother side, with a medium body, average carbonation and a slightly bitter finish that trails off and leaves you guessed it, rye. I like this beer and have been drinking it for years. It is always good if you enjoy mixing it up and the flavor of rye, plus the can keeps the hops and rye fresh and mildly spicy. One of the top rye ales made."

"From out dated can. No loss as far as I can tell. The appearence, aroma & taste have not suffered. The head was maintained throughout. It was lively on the tongue & there was no telltale ""skunking in the brew. Toasted malt is what comes through under the nose & is solidified (or liquified) on the tongue to a very pleasent end. The labeling laudes rye as the star but I beg to differ. The brewers are first rate & withot their deft touch this could never have happened. I'm a traditionalist & this has opened up a new path for me. In the long run the flavor tires the taste buds, so perhaps a smaller can may beneifit the consumer, but don't let that stop you. Chill it, open it & enjoy it."

"Poured this beer from the 16oz can. It has a light brown color body with a thick head. The aroma is spicy of rye and with a slight hop aroma. The taste has a rye forward flavor with a pine hop taste on the back of the tongue. Mouthfeel is smooth and overall a very tasty beer."

"Poured into an English pint it produced a one-finger head of moderately thick foam that came down to a fairly solid surface froth with very solid lacing. Color is clear dark amber with hints of dark honey and toffee and an appearance of solid carbonation. Aroma is a nice mix of malty, hop pine, and spice. It’s interesting to note that when I first drank this beer, I was unaware of the rye component to the brew, however, after reading up on the background of the beer, it actually comes across quite clear on the nose. Sometimes beer and liquor descriptions cause you to perceive things that are described in writing but aren't quite there in the glass, and sometimes they cause you to suddenly notice something that was there all the time. So, caramel and crystal malts seem to be there helping to produce a strong toffee aroma; the rye brings in an herbally, grassy, peppery-spice note; and the hops contribute a very, very light floral pine quality. All in all a sweet and appealing nose. Sip is sweet and malty up front with caramel, toffee, and mild hints of butterscotch alongside some grassy notes from the rye. Mid-palate sees the bitter notes come on strong - bitter hops, mild white pepper hints, and bitter cocoa. Back of the tongue and swallow see a strong bitterness matched with sweet cola, roasted pear, and toffee sensations. Finish is short and somewhat unimpressive, dominated by a generalized bitter dryness subtlety under-girded with rye notes. The balance is towards the bitter in this ale, and yet this is nonetheless a solidly constructed beer with enough smooth malt backbone to keep it from becoming a tannin bomb - in fact, it’s dangerously drinkable. Carbonation is a bit strong, but works perfectly in this case by breaking up some of the malt-y sweetness in spots. If I had to credit one thing that makes this such a superior beer it would be what a smooth and velvety mouthfeel it has, specifically in terms of the malty side of the equation. All-in-all, this is one terrific, subtlety complex, and dangerously drinkable brew. Furthermore, it's really interesting to see a brewery go in a different direction than super-hoppy IPAs with a rye beer."

"This is a well balanced drinker. There's a wonderful combination of hops, sweet malt, spicy rye, medium body, full flavor, yet without being too bitter for the palate and easy drinking."

"Special version brewed at Adnams (at 6.3% abv) for Wetherspoons. A copper coloured beer with a slightly offwhite head and a citric, mostly lemony, nose. It begins with a warm, sweet lemony flavour similar to Jack D'or brewed by Pretty Things before a more leafy hop flavour takes over backed by a rather savoury biscuitiness (I guess that'll be the rye). It leaves a pleasant oily residue on the tongue, meaning the big hops really linger. It was a pity I only had time for a half pint (particularly at £1.79 per pint)."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"A rocking beer. Excellent, big hop flavour balanced by a nice rye malt flavour."

"Poured into a sam adams glass, great, off white to tan, head developed with nice retention and lacing. Aroma was malty and herbal with some hop and lemon notes. Appearance was a haze, amber to copper color. Tasted a sweet malt to start with some herbal notes and went to a hoppy and bitter finish, good stuff. Mouthfeel was creamy and full with a nice bitter and dry aftertaste."
""
""
"Pour brown and a bit hazy. Kind of looks like a dark iced tea. The smell is ok. Kind of a little sour smell and some hops. Nothing bad or good about it. The taste is pleasant. Kind of graining and a touch sour. It's a good mix and pretty smooth. Overall, this is a decent beer that has a place on a fall night."

"Big winner. Tasty and complex."
"I had a few of these 16 oz cans at August in the West Village. It poured a red/brown with a beige head. The smell gave off light hints of malt, caramel and rye. The taste was something roasted, perhaps coffee. I struggled to find a ton of rye, but that was a good thing. It allowed the subtle floral hops to shine through. The carbonation was lively. This was well balanced and does not go overboard on the hops."

""

""

"Love these Sixpoint tallboy cans. I almost skipped right over this thinking it was one of the others when I saw it on the shelf. Glad I picked it up. Pours coppery with a decent head. Lovely smells and tastes- lots of gently spicy rye and toasty malt that lends the beer a nice sweetness. Slight hints of chocolate that you get in rye sometimes. Not an uber rye like the founders, more restrained, and a bit sweeter and softer, but oh so balanced. Delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Many people shy away from brown ales because they find them boring or bland. Well this beer will change all that. The hop qualities keep the palate interested and the gently sweet malt keeps it satisfied. The rye makes this beer. It is so well done and really shines with it's touch of sour alongside a perfect citrus tartness. Bold refreshing and brawny."

"O - I was very impressed by this beer. I don't typically favor rye beers, but this had tremendous balance. Complexity of flavors that all came together perfectly, with nothing out of place. Bonus points because I love the pounder can format. I will be revisiting this one frequently."

"Brown and red hued liquid with an off white creamy head. Nose is all malt and rye. Nice balance of roasted malt and rye. Nice sweetness to it. Also a bit of smoke and spice. A simple yet tasty brew that shows how good rye can be. Overall a very delicious and enjoyable beer. Recommended."

"I enjoy this one alot. It has nice dry taste which goes down real smooth. I can make this one of my regular brews to have in the fridge. It also seems to stay pretty will in the fridge without spoiling. I had a case of 24 back in December. I have a few cans left and they still taste as fresh."

"This is a rather interesting beer. It has a very complex flavor profile and is far hoppier than I was expecting. I am pleasantly surprised and impressed with this beer. I could definitely put a few cans of this away. If I can get my hands on it, I'll definitely get more."
""
""
""
""
""
"There really is nothing not to like in this beer."
""
""
"Overall – This is a great, rather rye potent brew, with a nice hop profile and balance for the more malty and rye flavors of the brew. Quite tasty and a good drinker."
""
""
"Poured from a 16 oz can into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a nice deep dark red with a very nice fluffy slight off white head. Smells of grassy notes dominately with slight floral notes very nice. Tastes of earthy notes with grassy bits and bite with citrusy notes. Beer is light medium bodied and carbonation is good, finishes nicely. Overall, a very good beer."

"I've had a couple of brews from Sixpoint and I can say the folks over at Sixpoint know what they're doing. If you like a rye beer, then do yourself a favor and look for this. You absolutely will not be disappointed. Great session brew."

"O- Very drinkable and enjoyable. I gotta have my rye!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!!"

"Very good beer. Nice aroma from the hops, and the hops predominate at first. As the beer warms, the sweetness of the rye develops. Clean and crisp throughout. A very drinkable beer for all seasons and most occasions.i have not had a beer from six point that I have not liked."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""

"Poured a clearish aubunr red brown with a good head and lace on top of a very malty aroma of bread, barley, rye, some caramel malt, as well as a smidge of citric hops. Medium-bodied with great balance, the rye makes this beer slick and easy to drink. The hop flavors are minimal but they get the job done and there is some sweetness from the caramel as well. Mostly though, a robust and sturdy beer that the malts make it a tasty, crisp beer with good finish."
""
""
""
""

"Good beer. I found it quite interesting, again so far always a good brew from Sixpoint (though I prefer the other core over this one as a regular beer)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, pretty tasty. The rye isn't highlighted quite as much as I was expecting. This beer, to me, is almost more of an IPA, which is fine in my book."
""
""
""
""
""
"For some damn reason, every time I see the word ""righteous", even with regard to moral/religious accomplishments, my mind immediately goes to something dumb like ""Surf Ninjas""... In any case, this stuff pours a clear garnet topped by a finger of khaki foam. The nose comprises lightly-toasted rye bread, light mint, light pine needles, and a tiny touch of mild cocoa. The taste brings in more of the same, with the emphasis placed squarely on the rye (unsurprising here). The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly creamy feel. Overall, a nice little rye beer, one that maintains a healthy hoppiness without allowing the hops to overcome all else. Not bad."
""
""
""
"Overall- Interesting, never had anything quite like it, rye beer or otherwise. A gotlandsdricka I had a while back would be the closest to the slightly spicy, slightly herbal, mellow-with-a-sharp edge feel. Worth trying, but I wouldn't pick it out over Bengali Tiger."
""
""
"Dark caramel brown in color with decent clarity.Poured with a tall dense foam that reduced to a soapy cap that left sticky lacings on the glass. Earthy rye malt and citrus hops aromas compete for dominance, but there is no clear winner here. Medium bodied with assertive carbonation. Rye and toasted malt flavors up front followed by citrus hop bitterness. Finishes with a fading citrus hop aftertaste and lasting rye malt presence. Probably my favorite Six Point offering. There's just not enough rye ales out there."
"Overall: Great beer, although it is not my personal first choice."
""
"O-a different type if rye beer. Has all the qualities of a past due pale ale yet with an extreme complexity unseen in most rye ales. Quite drinkable and tasty."
""
""
"O: Creamy, spicy, sour, malty, all of these descriptions work at different times when drinking this beer. The finish has a real bitter edge. The rye is pronounced, lending a woody quality. Rough, but enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Enjoyable. I'm glad I bought 4 of these. I love the tallboys. i would order another."
""
""
"O- This is a nice rye brew. Drink out of the can because the look and nose of this beer aren't its highlights."
""
"This is a very good beer. It is not exactly a rye... it stands on its own."
"O- exactly what I'm looking for in a Rye."
""
""
""
"This is a solid beer, tastes good, Goes well with food or just for slow sipping."
""

"16 oz can. Pours dark amber with a long lasting, fluffy, off-white head. Aroma is of citrusy hops, caramel and bready malt. Body is medium and smooth. Citrusy hops, rye spiciness and caramel malt combine on the palate. Finish is long and bitter. Enjoyable brew."
""
""
"Overall? I really like it. Not as hoppy as I expected, but the light sweetness, spicy flavors, and subtle earthy hop flavors all balance together nicely. Good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Found at Pies & Pints in Middlebury, CT this rye ale shows a pretty murky dark brown color with a sturdy near Guinness like head that is vaguely light tan colored. Lacing trails in a healthy cascade. The nose offers tangy rye-wheat and peppery citrus grain. Relatively mild but okay. The flavor brings on a much hoppier profile with tangy citrus/orange and buckwheat grain. There’s an interesting malt cream idea coupled with a crisp hop and rye grain medley. Feel is brisk with a energetic wave of carbonation, and body is a solid light-plus. Very refreshing and an adequate hop quotient worthy of a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a fairly unique beer in a style that is not represented to any great extent. This is a great effort and a beer that I will look to pick up again sometime."
"O-Most everything seemed off in this beer, flavors are bland and seemed off."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this one was the rich look. Each swirl reproduced a nice froth, heady film, with wet and sticky lacing around the glass. We found the nose to be a little weak in strength, and were expecting a more pronounced hops character. The taste followed the nose, and was also a bit dull. Here we were hoping for a more robust strength to the rye itself, rather than the rest of the malt bill, which we found to be on the adjuncty side. Otherwise this guy is refreshing, and decent for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"What a tasty rye. This stuff is great and packed with robust flavor."
"Overall: This is a decent rye beer. Nothing mind blowing, but consistantly good across the board."
""
"O: An outstanding offering by Sixpoint. Probably the best rye beer I have ever tasted."
""
""
""
""
""
"The body was nicely full and well-rounded, with a pleasantly crisp ""bite"". Drinkability was very good, if this were available locally, I'd drink a bunch of it regularly. Overall, a very nice beer that is worth your attention."
""
""
"O- I haven't come across too many rye beers that weren't rye ipas. This is very satisfying, I thoroughly enjoyed this one."
""
""
"Overall: this beer just runs me the right way. I wish I could get it out west."
""
"O - Instead of your typical American amber, Righteous Ale promotes rye first and foremost with earth and spice attributes that meld well with the subtle hop characteristics and a malty backbone for a drinkable beer that's still appealing to a more broad spectrum of drinkers while giving said ""base style"" a new spin."
""
"not sixpoint's best beer, and not the best rye ale i've had, however it is refreshing and a nice beer to have on hand for summer months. not much to explore in flavor, but the amount of lacing and the mouthfeel make it great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very citrus-forward brew with enough rye to add complexity but not overpower the hop bill. Bold offering from Sixpoint."
""
"Pours a dark redish brown with a frothy tan head. Smell is rye, malt, some citrus hop, and a hint of yeast. Taste is mostly the malt and rye with the hops and bitterness come in at the end. The aftertaste has the bitterness, and rye. The mouthfeel is medium, a nice consistency and balance. Smooth and easy to drink, strong flavors here that could turn some away, but I find very enjoyable. Overall a good beer, great flavor, worth checking out."
"The only drawback is the body is a bit thin for me, hard to pinpoint but had similar reaction to Bengali Tiger."
"O - Overall a nice beer from Sixpoint. Good rye spiciness without going over the top. Hops are present but restrained. Quite drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is very easy to drink and very enjoyable. I would gladly enjoy drinking this beer all night long. I find that I like the rye spiciness with a bit of hot bitterness (kind of a hybrid Rye IPA)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: This is a Rye IPA I am guessing which is beginning to become one of my favorite styles. The rye balances out the hops to make it from becoming too hop heavy, which I really don’t mind on occasion. This is an easy drinking beer that goes down as smooth as any session ale. This is definitely one beer to find in my opinion."
"M: full-mouthfeel with spicy hop finish"
""
""
""
""
""
"16oz can, pours deep red with a fluffy ivory head that holds great retention and leaves good lacing on the glass. Aromas are citric with a nice dose of rye malt/rye bread. Tastes are bitter with dank, piny hops, pungent grapefruit, peppery rye, some caramel in the background, although it comes across as burnt caramel from the heavy pine resin taste. Mouth-feel is medium-to-full bodied, moderately carbonated, and smooth. Overall, good take on the style."
""
"I love that the can mentions harsh winters and acidic soils. This beer looks like it came acidic northern forest soils."
"As billed, this brew hits the sweet-IPA spot. If you're a malt guy looking to see what one's taste buds can do beyond the usual sweetness, you'll do well with this. The 60 IBU's that would frighten off the usual malt lover are here softened by the stiff malt backbone. The aroma is frighteningly sharp of fresh dry hops, w/ a reassuring caramel sweetness beneath it..."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (4/5): Righteous is a great-looking, highly-drinkable beer with bold flavors and offers a nice take on a rye ale–one that showcases the rye above all else and doesn't try to offer the rye ingredient as a modification to an IPA recipe. My first Sixpoint can, and a good place to start. Recommended."
"Overall, very well done and one I'd easily drink again."
"(originally reviewed: 06-20-2011)"

""
""
"O: A decent rye beer. The rye spice is folded into the beer nicely, with brown malt flavors giving it a more traditional, sweet flavor. One of the more drinkable rye ales I've had."
"This pours a dark and murky brown amber with a finger’s worth of foam. It has a light aroma without a dominant hop presence. It’s heavier and maltier than I anticipated. Thick, real thick almost, with a definite resiny chew to it, and a noticeable rye presence. There’s a pronounced bitterness that’s balanced by a rounded sweetness as it opens up. I’m glad I spent some time with it as it ended up growing on me."
""
""
""
""
"Drinks easy, a good take on the style"
""
""
"Overall: A big fan of rye beers and happy to add this one to the mix. Will be looking for more of this in the future."
"The body is medium, with both crispness and smoothness, but it all tapers off toward the end of each sip."
""
"O: A very enjoyable Rye Beer. Not quite in the same pantheon as Red's Rye, but a strong contender none the less."
""
""
""
""
"D: This was an interesting brew, with scent and taste that had odd elements. Not so much rye as mint and fennel, which isn't really my thing. The body was ok, and the finish was smooth enough, so it was pretty easy to drink. But not a remarkable beer by any means."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall a nice beer that brings lots of unique but enjoyable elements to the table."
""
"O: im pretty impressed by the taste complexity of this brew, the malt character as well as sweetness are well balanced with the spiciness of the rye. there wasnt really much to find in the scent but then again i guess i hadnt expected much"
""
""
"As the beer seems much of an American pale ale, I seem to want elevated hop flavor, bitterness, and dryness to pull slightly ahead of the rye malt but that's not to be. Where I want more of an IPA base, this lighter version keeps me wanting more."
"Overall- this is pretty solid. It is almost like a decently balanced Rye pale ale. This is my 2nd favorite Sixpoint beer!"
""
"Poured into a nonic pint. Appears a deep red with mild cloudiness. Fluffy 1 finger head upon pour, great retention and tons of lacing. The aroma is malt forward with notable rye and caramel. Mellow pine hops are there as well. The hops come up front on the flavor with mild bitterness. Lots of rich malt notes come through with plenty of bready malts. Some mild sweetness comes through with a more aggressive rye grain flavor coming in at the end. Nice balance of flavors here. The mouthfeel is smooth and a little creamy. Overall, this is the best Sixpoint offering I have tried so far. Highly drinkable with plenty of flavor."
"If this is at all representative, I will be drinking more rye."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: My new favorite Sixpoint beer! It has a good rye character and a sweetly-bitter hop flavor and aroma; smooth and tasty. Another can, please."
"Rye beers always seem to be a bit of a style-bender, and this is no exception. Nice level of hopping with spicy herbal notes in the American Pale Ale Range, with a bit of chewyness in the malt along the American Amber ale line. Rye is well moderated and introduced just enough to lend a little bite in the middle. Nicely done."
"O- very good rye beer. Probably one of the better ryes I have had. Will be picking up a 4 pack soon."
"O: Of the 5-6 rye beers I've had, this one is definitely on the lower end of in-your-face with the spiciness of rye. It does a great job combining with the earthy hops to make this very solid overall"
""
""
""
"O- This is a good Rye Pale Ale that i would liken to SA's Ruthless (Although Rightous came first). Lots of piney hop notes with rye spice mingling within. Recommended for hop lovers looking to step outside the American IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: Burning remains for a long time, across the tongue and the cheek area around the molars. Oddly, the throat does not have this experience as much."
""
""
""
"The beer pours a hazy brown color with an off-white head. The aroma is very nice and is full of rye and pine. The flavor is a little more complex. I get a lot of toffee and rye notes, as well as some nice bitter pine and orange citrus notes. The beer is fairly spicy overall and is refreshing. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
"O - This is a nother example of Sixpoints ability to brew great ips .Fresh with hints of rye bread .This beer is makes you want to come back for more like there resin . Fresh and rye like . Great for pasta ."
"Overall this is certainly not a bad beer. Doesnt excite me too much but would drink it again in a second. A good standard for the rye beer style."

"Poured from the can, the beer produced an orange tint with a very slight white head. The aroma was a little odd for a rye beer, being slightly fruity and slightly indescribable. Taking the dive, the initial taste was orange with a mild flavor of rye drawing the attention of the side of the tongue. A hint of tea is also present. This might be an odd point of comparison, but I can't be the only person the chews on popsicle sticks after eating the popsicle. That said, something about the taste reminds me of chewing on the stick of a orange dreamsicle. There is a synthetic orange and a little woodiness. A smooth drinker, the aftertaste fades into a mild citric and hoppy taste. It lingers in the back of the throat, but does not make an overwhelming impression."
"O- the best rye beer I've ever had. Downright fantastic."
""
""
"This one is dark looking and tasting. It looks to be well made - clear - and the can further helps keep it pure. My plastic hotel cup is covered in lovely lace. It's mostly hops bitterness without much of a malty or yeasty character. All appropriate for the style. Recommened. I will buy again."
""
"Overall, I'm a little bit disappointed with this one. It's serviceable, but the flavors don't seem to come together completely, and the sweetness nearly overpowers the rye at times. Still, there are no unpleasant tastes, and I'd drink it again."
"Taste-Toasted malt, citrus, spicy rye and spicy yeast note. Interesting flavor keeps you coming back for another sip."
""
"Overall - Impressive, hoppy as hell and very drinkible. Smooth rye and malts work well to mellow out the hop bomb. A nice twist on a rye ipa that will set it apart from the rest. Really nice job, this is one of the best for sure."
""
""
"16 ounce can, best before 25 July 2012. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a burnt orange/copper copper with an inch light tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. The brew smells like spicy rye, floral and citrusy (orange peel, grapefruit) hops, along with some caramel malt. It tastes like rye, floral and citrusy hops, and some earthy and caramel malt. There's also a nice lingering bitter finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating and has moderate carbonation. It's also easy to drink. I think it's a good overall brew, I'd certainly buy this again. $8.99 a 4 pack. This is my first Sixpoint brew, and I'll have to try some other ones now!"
"The rating was high on this one, which made me give Sixpoint another shot - I have to admit I'm disappointed. Overall, a decent beer, but not great, nothing stands out about this one. Its got a long way to go to stack up to a rye like Reds Rye or Hop Rod Rye. The hop profiles seem very similar for all the Sixpoint beers I've had - not enough aroma paired with firm bitterness, leaving them unbalanced."
"O- Nice beer from a can. I have had a few Rye IPAs this seems more like a Rye Pale Ale. Very drinkable and something I would definitely pick up for a tailgate or BBQ."
""
""
"Nice beer, this is my first Sixpoint offering. My mind isn't blown, but it's a pretty solid beer that hopheads should try."
"Along with Founder's Red Rye, this offering is a standout in a style that is becoming increasingly popular among brewers."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a decent rye beer, bitterness more in-line with an IPA than expected. Not sure why the aroma is so muted. Not on the same level as Hop Rod Rye or Red's Rye, but nice to have another can option."
""
"overall a good showcase of what rye can do in a beer. very flavorful"

"D: I like hoppy rye ales a lot, and this certainly fits the bill. Call it can cognitive dissonance, but it still feels a bit unusual to pour such an unrestrained ale from a can. A bit of a sipper, and not the most accessible from the style, but it's very nice nonetheless."
""
""
"After pouring my first one of these into a pint it changed everything. You cant go commercial ever again after having one or a whole four pack of these bad boys. This is the perfect ale and a standard that others should follow. I haven't had many rye ales but this beer will make you thirst for more. The look, the smell and the tast are exceptional. This beer is also drinkable, no your not going to drink ten of these but there is no need to anyways. After having one you will want another though and probably another after that and it has some kick to it too."

"Mouth feel is very smooth medium body with a delicate bitter nearly sour in the finish dry and nice. Very well executed rye with that great bitter/almost sour finish."
""
""
"The mouthfeel was smooth and a bit thinner than expected. Adequate carbonation and enough body. Sixpoint is new to my area but I am loving all that I have tried from them. I dig the packaging too. Thank you Sixpoint for dating your product!"
"Pint can thanks to gtreid! Dark copper in color @ 19 SRM and a light tan soapy head that laces the glass a good deal. Nose is all rye & spicy earthy hop aroma. Taste follows suit, approaching a soap-like hop presence & not enough sweet malt character for me. Mouth expands quite well but nearly metallic backend cloys at the tongue. Could shave this character off the brew & would be a lot better."
"Sixpoint's decision to start canning and distributing their beers may have been the best thing to happen to craft beer in 2011. Enjoying a pint of Righteous Ale is probably the best thing to happen to me today. I make no secret of my love for this Brooklyn brewery who seem to do good by just about any style of beer they put their minds to."
"Tastes a bit more boilerplate than it smells. It's still good, don't get me wrong, but the balance doesn't quite come together as well. The rye is a bit more aggresive and blots out the interesting (and not all that typical) caramel nodes that made the aromatic malt profile so interesting. This is still backed up pretty well by the hoppy back end, though, and the long-lingering rye aftertaste is pretty kickass."

"O: What can I say, this beer is thoroughly boring tasting. It is clean tasting at least, with a pleasant flavor , but just boring. Needs much more of a hop injection and some more tang. i recall these characteristics on tap, but in the can not so much. I'd recommend trying this on tap for sure, but in the can..."
"D: This is a really interesting beer and very refreshing. The spiciness of the rye provides some nice balance for the hops. The bitterness restrains the drinkability to some extent, but overall it's definitely work trying."
"Can: Poured a brown color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma consists of spicy rye malt with solid hosp presence. Taste is a nice mix between some spicy rye malt with a solid hosp presence with some medium bitter notes. Body is quite full with a creamy texture and good carbonation. Really enjoyable and quiet refreshing."
""

"This pours pours a very smooth and light bodied, nice amber in color with a one finger soapy white head. The nose is sweet and piney. There is definitely a lot of rye here. It smells like a rye pale, similar to Founders Reds Rye. The flavors too have plenty of rye. It's smooth and the malt bill contains the happiness quite well. The piney happiness is just right. It drinks very, very smoothly. Overall this is a really nice rye pale ale. It is perfectly built for a can. It's good to see a rye from a can with crossover appeal."
"Overall: I love love love this beer. This is what I wish more rye beers would taste like. This one screams rye, yet there are enough other flavors there to make it complex. This one is not overly bitter so I can enjoy the bready taste. I am getting this again. Superior beer."
"One of the most interesting beers I have had in a long time. Not hoppy or overly malty but just a great tasting beer. Unlike a lot beers this one does not hit you at first taste. It actually gets better the more you drink it. I get a sublte chocolate, smoke, light sweet and earthly like flavor. Great job Sixpoint. Can't wait to try your other beers."
""
"O: easily drinkable but not a standout. Would pass in store but drink if offered one."
""
"Notes - I woud love to pair this with a cornbeef special sandwich especially with a really nice strong swiss or gruyere cheese...would be a thing of beauty!!"
""
"O- an excellent beer from sixpoint, I could see myself drinking a few of these bad boys, delicious flavor and manageable alc vol."
"o - Overall a good rye beer. Ton of rye (obviously) so if you like that, well worth checking out...I liked the nose quite a bit. Would have it again."
""
"All in all, a good solid rye ale."
""
""
"O: Besides the aroma, a solid beer, but the smell really drove me away from it. I remember having on tap before and it definitely did not smell this strong."
"Poured out as a rich looking amber color with a white head on top. The head has a decent amount of retention and lacing to it. The smell of the beer has a good malt backbone to it with some toasted notes and a spiced aroma coming off of it also. The taste of the beer was has a hefty amount of rye in it which is nice. It brings in a good amount of spice to the beer. The flavors leave your taste buds tingling with the blend of hops and rye that they use here. The mouthfeel is dry, it leaves the mouth asking for another sip. It's a drinkable brew for sure. Overall it's one of the better rye beers I've had, I like it because I can actually get a healthy amount of rye in the flavor. Worth trying I think."
""
""
"I'll come right out, I love Rye beer, but this easily one of (if not THE) best rye beers I've had, right up there with hop rod rye! It's bitter but the rye doesn't dominate, there's a good herbal tangy/zesty/citrus hop bite that is really delicious. The mouthfeel is full and creamy, it's just world class!"
"Overall/Drinkability-This beer has singlehandedly changed my entire mindset on Rye beers, I had initially written the entire style off as I had not found a single example I liked. That said, this is an extremely well crafted brew that is supremely drinkable, well done Sixpoint, well done."
""

"Very easy to drink brew with no hint of the ABV. Well crafted and balanced, I would drink these regularly if I had em in the fridge."
""
"Overall: This is one of the better rye beers out there. Definitely worth a try."
""
"Again, same hop profile or yeast of all their other beers. Completely overpowers everything else. Very mediocre."
""
""
""
""
"O: A very pleasant drinker, and my first rye beer. Only the second beer I have had from this brewery, I have yet to be disappointed."
"Not very impressed with this rye beer. Would not drink this again."
"O: I am going to skip the Sixpoint line except for the exceptional Crisp lager. Their ales all have an over-biscuited, sweet meaty malt profile that drowns out all other flavors. It just doesn't agree with me, and I have tried their whole lineup now."
""
""
""
"O: Not my cup of beer."
"Id drink it again though"
""
"Overall – A solid, quaffable rye beer. Glad I have another can to drink."
""
""
""
"O - A wonderfully drinkable Rye beer that stack up with some of the best!"
""
""
""
"This is one damn fine rye ale. There isn't much room for anything else but hey, when it's done this well, who cares about complexity? Rye rye rye. Glad to have three more cans cooling in the basement. I don't think they'll last."
""
""
"Interesting beer but a little scattershot, hop flavor is a bit odd and doesn't really mesh with the rest of the beer. Not bad though, enjoyed it for the most part."
""
""
"This was my first time with this beer and it’s probably my favorite of these Sixpoint cans. It’s pretty aggressive overall with the hops and rye but it never seemed to get out of hand at all and keep things fairly drinkable. I would probably have this again."

"D/O- Liked this one. This puts rye in the forefront, perhaps more than I've ever tasted. Would want to have again. Thanks mcb4538!"

"Pours a clear reddish orange. Pretty colour. Nice white head. Smells a bit muddled. Some malty sweetness. A touch of spiciness. Tastes rich and spicy. Well carbonated. Sweet. Overall very nice flavour profile. I would Definitely drink this all the time if i could get it easily"
""
"O-very nice beer but not really for me"
""
"Overall - Tsates more like an APA or American IPA, but it a decent beer. Hard to drink more than 1 in a sitting though with the hop bitterness."
"Overall a good beer. Not up there with Hot Rod Rye but still a nice usage of an under featured element. This would have probably been even better had it been opened sooner after its purchase."
"Cheers!"

"Hazed and murky reddish sienna color; I still got a nice volcanic topper on my rather gentle pour into a pint glass. The head crown laced down an inch below the rim as I imbibed. The nose has that familiar Sixpoint hop character side-by-side with a spicy rye malt. Hints of steakhouse brown bread and ginger can be detected. The taste is more of the same bready malt and coppery spiciness. Those hops reminiscent of Bengali Tiger are there offering bitter orange notes. Mouthfeel is creamy and comfy; nice and round with a soft medium carbonation. A just short of remarkable rye beer. Well done."
""
"This has a very tame hoppy taste. Because of the robust scent the mix with mild bite of hops and smooth balance of malt makes this an extremely pleasant beer. Nothing is obnoxious and it's just a nice, chilled out brew."
"O - A pretty good beer if you are looking for rye (which you probably are if you're drinking a ""Rye Beer"") but not much other than that."
"M: Sickly sweet with anise, a very liquified, syrupy version."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours opaque, dark amber and brown in color, with thin, off-white head leaving a touch of lacing. The aroma has a definite, sharp grain kick to it right up front, along with assertive spicy, herbal hops notes, with some grapefruit or tropical fruitiness as well. Slightly sweet, with a grainy malt base. Intensely bitter with sharp, spicy notes, with just a hint of citrus fruit. The mouthfeel is exceptionally rich and chewy."

"D: Drinks very easily. Super smooth and highly quaffable."
"O - The Righteous Ale is a tasty brew. I enjoyed the mix of rye and hop flavors and would definitely enjoy another tall boy can for the win!"
"O: I was really surprised and impressed by Sixpoint Righteous. I'm used to Rye IPA variants, but this is a different animal. The acidity, smoky, fruity and toasted sweetness of the rye shines through a complex and slightly boozy 6.4% ABV. Glad I rolled the dice on this 4-pk."
"O - This was a very enjoyable Rye beer...the spice levels of both the hops and the rye were able to play off of each other and the complimenting malt bill was a nice addition...I just wasn't a fan of the finish"
"I've never had a beer with this much rye. It sure rules the show. I've enjoyed Sixpoint on draft several times, but have yet to be impressed with one of their cans."
"Rye beers are hit or miss for me, and this is a hit. Nicely done."
"Morey's Bottom Line: I pulled some strings to help bring Sixpoint into the area, and I'm glad that I did. A good fall beer for sure. I thought that I was getting a bit of a metallic taste on my first sip, but the more I drink, the less I notice it."
"O/D - This is one the better rye beers that I have had. I really enjoyed it. If you're looking for lots of bready malt and balanced hops with little sweetness this one is the ticket. I will seek this one out if I'm ever near NY."
"Pours a dark mahogany color with an inch of head. Very little lacing. Aromas of malts, bread and some citrus/orange peel. Taste is of grains and malts with a good amount of hop flavor. Orange peel at the end with some bitterness. Good balance of malt, grains and hops. Very drinkable and one of the better Rye beers I've had in a long time. Sixpoint has impressed me yet again. Overall, its certainly worth seeking out."
"D: Pretty darned good, like I stated above very sessionable - pints to pass all night."
"Overall - a solid rye beer that's a nice change of pace. I would like to see more rye beers overall because they certainly have potential."
"O: For hop heads who are looking for a slightly off-kilter IPA, this Bud's for you!"
"I really liked this although I felt the hops were a bit too assertive and bitter and the rye flavor was somewhat overwhelmed."
"Overall, this is an excellent rye beer. The rye really comes through in the flavor profile, but it is well balance by the hop presence."
"VERY GOOD, SEEK IT OUT!"
"O: Smooth drinkability, the rye grains really makes this distinct. Crisp, dry, with just the right amount of alcohol warmth. Refined, six pack worthy and a solid example that defies the myth about can packaged beers. Righteous by style."
"Not going to go with a formal review on this one. But this is an excellent Rye beer. Rates up there with the best of its kind. Very drinkable, very tasty for sure. Only down side if the best buy date is on the can, this is good. Except that the can is in a closed package so you don't know the date until you get it home! Not sure why they would do it like this, but I understand they will put date on outside of package soon. Mine had a best by date of 10/18/2011, so I am just under the wire with this one."
"Overall: This is a toppers rye beer that actually uses the grain instead of hiding it in hops. I also like the fact that this beer can be enjoyed year-round. In my opinion, it is the best colder-weather beer of the Sixpoint flagship lineup. 1 for 1 Sixpoint. good stuff!"
"Pours a murky iced tea color with a huge 3 inch foamy light tan head that only slightly settles to a craggy cap. Random swaths of lace form on the sides of the glass on the drink down. Smell is of rye bread and some earthy/pine/citrus zest hops. A very pleasant and rich aroma on this one. Taste is of malt, rye spice flavors, and some herbal/citrus zest hops. Very mild bitterness quickly fades from the palate. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good rye beer from Sixpoint with some nice rye aromas and flavors."
"Yeah, not huge on this, but some borderline enjoyable flavours."
"Righteous Ale is a simple take on a hoppy beer with a rye twist; it's right up my alley. I don't know when it was canned, but considering how close it's getting to the best by date, I'm all the more impressed with how hoppy it is. I'd chose this over Bengali Tiger any day."
"Overall - Very tasty, but not a looker. Extra credit for being canned instead of bottled. Won't turn it down and will pick it up for outdoor activities. Overall, I'll say a solid very good."
"Overall I did not enjoy this ale and most likely would never drink it again. Unless maybe I was at a wedding and that was the sole imbibement. Even then, one would be enough. 15 minutes into this review the bitterness still hangs on my palate. However I recognize that this is a craft ale, unlike big beer crap. So if you're into a hoppy ale with some nice characteristics, by all means go for it."
"Righteous is a spicy, malty ale with some hints at caramel sweetness, a pleasant finish, and enough character and balance to retain a great level of drinkability. I'll be enjoying the rest of this 4 pack, one can at a time. Cheers!"
"A very drinkable and flavoursome brew, nonetheless. I really enjoy the prominent rye characters, which make it different enough to be recognisable, while the rest of the recipe is tempered to make it approachable and drinkable."
"Beer is medium in body and a really decent little pale ale. I enjoy it thoroughly. Not too malty, the rye comes through some, could be more showcased, and the finish is nice with mild to moderate bitterness, I'd have it again."
"I'm really hoping this is an off-batch, but three different styles?"
"Great brew, thanks again Jim!"
"A decent beer, but my least favorite of the 3 Sixpoints I was able to sample. I don't really like rye very much, and this one is packed full of it."
"O - An amazing beer, I had no clue it was this good. I figured you know a good session brew, however it clearly presents itself as a session-able complex beer. Looking forward to Bengali Tiger. Stay thirsty my friends~! Thanks to Dan Diaz for the recommendation. Cheers from Cali brotha!"
"Notes: First impression from Sixpoint and this feels like quality, and well worth of its reputation. Looking forward to trying more from them. Welcome to DC :)"
"Pours a clean amber-ish to brown color with an off white head. In the aroma, sweet malt, small grapefruit like hops and a small fruitiness. In the taste, small grapefruit like hops, dry graininess, with a small fruitiness all the way through. A small hop bite and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry ryeness and small grapefruit in the aftertaste. Nice mellow hops and a small rye presence, not too shabby!"
"overall, this is a solid rye beer, the rye flavors are definatly right on, but i find this unmistakable yeastiness to the 3 sixpoint beers ive had including this one. not really offensive, almost tastes like some homebrews ive had. this is worth a try, but not sure if id ever buy again."
"Notes: A solid rye ale. Doesn't make an attempt to hide its spicy ingredients, which makes it all the more tasty."
"Mouthfeel is creamy with great carbonation. It goes down easy and each sip leaves me wanting more. A really solid hoppy rye ale that I'd love to drink more of! I can't wait to try more Sixpoint stuff. Thanks to smokeypeat for this."
"O: There's lots to this beer, especially if you let it warm up a bit before drinking it straight down. A peculiar balance between fruit-cocktail-sweet and rye-bread bite. A treat, to say the least."
"The body is medium and the carbonation holds it up nicely. Overall a pretty tasty offering from these guys. Glad to have more rye beers locally."
"What a great beer, best rye beer that I have had so far. Lots going on with this one in flavor. One of my new favorites for this year."
"Overall this is a great hoppy rye beer. I've had a few hop forward rye beers like this one (Hop Rod Rye, Founders Reds Rye, Cane and Ebel) but none showcase the rye and have it work as nicely along with the hops as this one does."
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer. Super tasty and enjoyable. I'd recommend this to anyone that's not afraid of hops. The only thing I'm disappointed with is that I can't get it where I live."
"O Not bad of a beer. Pleasantly surprised with the hop presence. Nice subtle sweet malt flavor with a dry finish. Not bad at all."
"I like this one, I might try to track down more cans for the camp!"
"One of the better rye beers out there. The combination of the rye and citrus hops make this beer top notch."
"Cheers."
"16oz. can served in a Spiegelau nonic. Pours a deep caramel hue with a semi-hazy clarity and a half inch, creamy, loose, off-white head. Head eventually settles into a solid, quarter inch cap with thick swaths of lacing present during the tasting. Nose expresses rye, herbal aromas, citrus zest and some faint fruity esters. Taste is a bit on the acrid side - lots of bitter rind, more earthy rye and a trace of the light fruit suggested by the nose expresses itself towards the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a pleasant, crisp carbonation and a little bit of acidity. I haven't had too many rye beers, so can't really determine if this beer is to style or not - that said, my review is generally more to personal preference than style. As such, I generally found this beer to be decent, but not really my thing. The earthy bitterness is interesting, but quickly loses its appeal for me."
"On tap. Pours a deep amber in color. Aroma is hoppy, Malty, with a hint of rye grain. In the taste, citrusy hops, vegetation, rye graininess, a little fruity with a good deal of bitterness behind it. Hop forward with pine, citrus and herbal flavor. Rye spice is in the background. Caramel malts are there as well. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied. Overall, a decent beer, there is a lot going on in the flavor. Would try it again some time."
"Terrific beer. I'll pick it up again. Layers of flavor work together well to make e highly enjoyable brew. I can see this going with with beef, or sitting by a bonfire."
"O: Righteous Ale continues my streak of high scores for Sixpoint beers. It's a well crafted Rye beer which, much like Sixpoint's other offerings, really pushes the boundaries of the style. There's a lot going on here in the nose and on the palate. Slow down, sip, and savor. Well done."
"Overall: I enjoyed the hoppiness of this beer along with the rye spice. Solid balance and enjoyable. I would have another."
"wow. i didn't think i'd like this as much as i did. i guess my expectations were on the low side, thanks to most rye beers i've had in the past not really doing it for me. this beer makes me think better of the style. recommended."
"Body is a deep mahogany crimson red with a large biillowing creamy of white head, fine speckled lacing left behind forms quite nicely. An enjoyable drinking experience just visually, if that makes any sense. Aroma is full of spicy earthy rye notes with a back end citric pine hop nose. Looks like this clocks in at 57 IBUs, did I mention I'm really enjoying the pounder can format. Flavor is quaffingly bitter full of hops and spicy rye notes this is an in your face hopped up rye ale, the only better counterparts I've had are from Founders Red's Rye and Brew Kettle Red Eye RyePA. Each sip tastes better and better especially if you like rye and bitter pine cone hops, a bit of citrus pith but really crushing spruce tip bitterness with just hops and rye interplaying pretty awesome. Just enough sweetness to make it drinkable but really a dry finish for most of each sip. Mouthfeel is medium bodied slightly resinous with some hop oils making it through in texture, carbonation is smooth and not overdone really a nice drinking rye. I'm kind of sad only four came in my variety pack. Overall to reiterate what I've already said, kick ass spicy rye ale hopped up with pseudo spurce tips aka dank hops."
"Overall, a little malty, but not bad at all. Wondering about the freshness of my can..I know you don't want to do it, Sixpoint, but you probably should."
"O - Easily drinkable. Lots of smells and flavors going on, and it comes together quite well. I'd buy it again."
"I like this beer a lot. It's hoppy without being too oily and sweet without being sugary or sticky. The rye feels like just another ingredient, not the focus of the beer. This is a recommended beverage!"
"The big malts make this a perfect evening air, or cool weather beer. I can't see it disappointing any fan of craft beer regardless of profile preference."
"Overall I liked this beer as most rye beers have been too hoppy making them too dry or bitter this one is very drinkable. In fact even though I don't enjoy rye beers this one is very tasty. Nice offering Sixpoint!"
"Overall, although i'm not too experienced with rye beers, I loved the mouthfeel of this.  So full of flavor for such an easy drinking brew.  "
"O: Overall, the flavors were surprising but well balanced."
"*Cheese pairing at the time: Italian Truffle-infused Sottocenere. Highly recommend."
"Very nice bready aroma drifts from the beer. It also has a very nice citrusy hop aroma. It pours a deep amber or mahogany body with a fluffy cream colored head that leaves behind great lacing. It tastes very bitter up front followed by a bready sweet finish. It is a great beer but somewhat rich and something i could only have one or two a night."
"This has quickly become one of my new favorite brews. It reminds my of a Belgian Pale Ale or border line Belgian IPA. You know there's Rye in there when you pour and see the beautiful red color, and the aroma supports the Belgian yeast with an aroma of dense malt and the smell of fall. The taste is rich malt with a big yeast profile and a nice hop taste and balanced bitterness. At around $8.99 a four pack of 16oz. cans you can't beat the value and quality of this beer... two thumbs up!"
"O: In a word, Sixpoint's Righteous Ale is fantastic. It's perfectly balanced and easy to put back. I'm continually impressed by their quaffable yet complex brews. Another knockout from the (other) Brooklyn brewey. Possibly the best rye ale I've encountered."
"An interesting, complex beer. Slightly more astringent and bitter than ideal, but quite tasty."
"Into the glass, Rye poured out a straight brown becoming a browwnish with hint of dark red in the liquid. It's dark enough. A stealth pour yielded only some minor cream colored bubbles that became nothing, no stick. Smell is deep on the roasted malt with a small whiff of rye. Hops are present although earthy smelling with a light dry hop appeal. Some caramel and that's about all. Taste is between a brown ale with Rye, which is probably what this is. A mix of roasted malt and tootsie roll with a small spicy rye in the middle with some bittering dry hops on the end. Grassy, earthy tasting. All of this comes and goes pretty quick with an earthy aftertaste. Feel is kinda bland, not watery, the body is a sturdy step from medium but it needs more bubbles. Comes off as dying yet not dead. I got through it but won't reach for it again."
"O - Not too bad. This was one of the spiciest rye beers I have ever had yet I still enjoyed it. Thanks again to whoever brought it to the party."
"Overall - All of the Sixpoint beers I've has seem to have some similar attributes. This isn't a bad thing.. I enjoyed this beer and I could session it for sure."
"O: Solid. Had it nearly 2 years ago on the cask at Rattle 'n' Hum in NYC and liked it better off the cask, but there's nothing wrong with this in the can if you like rye beers (which I do - my favorite, from memory, is still Bear Republic's Hop Rod Rye)."
"O: The gas smell really put me off, but the rest of the beer wasn't too bad."
"A good ryepa"
"Overall: Definitely a unique beer. It's delicious, spicy, and full-bodied, which makes it a nice choice when you're looking for something a little outside the box that won't force you to commit to some odd combination of things that may or may not work."
"O - really quite good stuff; easy to drink and a beer of interest"
"Would pair very well with cheese, though it is quite flavorful on it's own. One of the better rye beers I've sampled."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: This is a beer I’ve enjoyed drinking more than once and will be having again. It goes down easily and leaves me wanting a few sips more. My overall impression is that this is a well made, very good rye beer and well worth seeking out."
"Poured a deep chesnut hued amber with a thinner slight off white head atop even after a hard pour.Aromas of sharp rye,resinty hop,and toasted nuts,a nice mix with the rye really the main component.Big sharp rye flavors mixed with a healthy dose of citric hops,a great combination that alot of brewers cant do as well,light toast as well in the background.A great rye beer,again alot of brewers in my opinion cant make a rye beer like this."
"Yes Virginia, good beer can indeed come in a can."
"Thanks Mikey for this extra. Pours a clear rusty orange with an off white head. Nose is bursting with hops and some really nice cracked grains, edgy, a la rye. A touch spicy and earthy. Fairly bitter on the palate, nice hop progression. Starts grainy, earthy, and bitter, ends long, hops focusing on tropical fruits and grapefruit rind. Very nice stuff, pleasant surprise pouring something so good out of a can."
"O: Well done beer. I would prefer this on a fall evening where the air is cool and clammy, this would suit that setting well. With the malt bill on this, I think an imperial version would be quite appealing and have high cellar potential."
"Overall -- This is a nice rye beer - taking a decent APA and elevating it with an actually detectable level of rye. Good stuff. If you like rye beers, I definitely recommend looking for this one."
"Final Thoguhts: Damn good. Buy this."
"O - This was one of the toughest beers I've reviewed. It's a unique beer and very well brewed at that."
"Definitely unique. Good to see another NY brewery on the map. Could get a lot of popular support in an area with a bunch of people, but low amount of breweries to divide their loyalties. The final frontier."
"O- this is an excellent beer. My new go-to in a can"
"O: Overall, a very good beer. I feel like more carbonation could have helped it in several categories, but the combination of the hops and rye smell and taste great."
"This beer's score suffers a bit from the look and smell but its exceedingly tasty and well crafter overall. Very smooth and surprisingly easy to drink, a solid representation of the style overall."
"Overall, a really great beer."
"Nose is super floral, some citrus and pine, sweet bready malt. Flavor has some nice juicy citrus hop notes, orange segments and grapefruit, some pine and floral notes - neat hop character. Moderate to low levels of bitterness, bready malt with a hint of some spicy rye, hint of earth. Body is quite thin, not much there for the finish, little disappointed there. Drinks quite easy but nothing blows me away here. Nice aroma hopping but could use a little more malt complexity and balance."
"16 ounce can, best by Sept. 29, 2011. Pours slightly hazy reddish brown color with a dense 2 finger off white head with great retention that reduces to a thin lacing cap that lasts. Some decent lacing is left on the glass as well. Aromas of caramel, chocolate, roasted malt, spicy rye, pine, and citrus. A lot of interesting aromas going on here, great stuff. Taste of caramel, rye, chocolate, pine, bread, nuttiness, and some citrus. Mostly malty sweetness on the front with a decent amount of bitterness on the finish that lingers for a bit with caramel, chocolate, bread, and pine. Medium-full bodied with medium carbonation. No alcohol noticed in the taste or finish. Decent amount of creaminess in the mouthfeel as well. Nice balance as well between sweetness and bitterness, with the sweetness being slightly stronger. Overall, an excellent rye ale, highly enjoyable and very drinkable stuff."
"O: I must admit, I was wary of beers from a can (NASCAR Alert!), but I was impressed by this offering from Sixpoint. My dinner is done, so it's time to drink this bad boy down and get my grub on. Cheers!"
"O: This beer is a far stray from the traditional rye style, being a canned beer, with big hop taste. I like this trend of good canned beer. Keep it coming 6 point."
"As nice as the hops in this one were, I think a little bit more rye might be an improvement, but not many beer people ask for less ""less hops, more malt!"" With that said, Righteous Ale impressed me. Sixpoint has always brewed some great beer, and I'm pretty pumped to have easy access to these cans."
"Sixpoint distributing its four-packs of cans into NJ has been a Godsend. I've enjoyed all of them so far and this one is no exception. The dark ruddy amber and the cream-colored head that leaves excellent lacing makes for a great presentation. The smell and the taste are identical and the smack of pine coupled with the rye sour and spice make for a nicely crafted brew. Do not read that ""sour"" as the sour you get from lactobacillus...it's entirely different. So please no beer messages. The grains and the the hops are in great balance and the rye gives of a feel of the grain spirit, making this sometimes seem like it has more heat than it does. This beer can cut through even the spiciest of food and I've been enjoying it with a SPAM, rice and cheese concoction that I make with a bhut jolokia (ghost pepper) hot sauce. If it can stand up to all this grain, dairy and capsaicin then it can cut through anything."
"D - There is good drinkability here. It goes down smooth and it is definitely a thirst quencher. This is a great beer to have on a hot summer day. One of my favorite rye beers so far. I recommend giving this one a try."
"o - i really like this beer. although none of their beers have been a disappointment, this and the crisp are beers that i can see myself regularly seeking out from the sixpoint line up."
"Taste from the onset is also dominated by the spicy rye character. Goes a bit sweet in the middle, and is dueled with some prickly hops through the close. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is good. Nice thirst-quencher for the summertime, and also an all-around good brew for anytime."
"Pours a dark shade of amber-bronze with a thick and foamy off-white head. Lots of nice white lacing on the sides of the glass as it goes down. The nose brings some light resinous pine hops and a bit of a citrus character as well. Good rye spice and a bit of caramel and toasted bread. The flavor is nice and hoppy with a good balance between it and the malt. Reminds me of a hoppy amber with a bit of rye spice. Nice pine throughout. Great balance between semi-sweet malt, rye spice, and hops in the mouthfeel. Medium body and slightly chewy with a bitter finish. Very, very solid offering. Another impressive brew from Sixpoint."
"O: Overall I'm very impressed with this beer. I went to the store and bought 4 different 4-Can packs and so far I've been impressed with each and every one. Sixpoint is a solid brewery and I cannot wait to try more brews by them."
"O - This is a rather enjoyable rye ale. Dont think the month or so I've had this in my fridge rally hindered things, but the overall lack of head and aroma knocks this beer back a bit for me."
"O- Nice to try, a little heavy but nice nonetheless. Y'know how it is, the craft beer geeks are always looking for something to really stand out and catch us off guard, this one does not do that but is a solid ale."
"Medium bodied with same for the carbonation, this has a fine mouthfeel and is pretty darned drinkable. Another classy brew from Sixpoint."
"Oh wow, that's good. The subtlety of the rye in the aroma is more than made up for as the grains coat the palate with a hefty bite of spicy rye goodness. Hops do more than balance the malt, and coat the back of the tongue with bitter pine resin and tropical fruit flavors. A hint of medicinal-like, tangy booziness (despite the low ABV) is all that keeps Righteous Ale from a perfect 5.0 in the flavor department. Mouthfeel is crisp and sharp, with a well carbonated medium body. Overall, a fantastic Rye Beer...very much looking forward to the rest of the 4pack."
"I'm already on #2."
"I can drink plenty of these and I will."
"Poured into a pint glass it revealed a nice copper hued amber color with a head that was maybe an inch or so high and balanced out well along the walls of the glass. Aroma was heavy hops at first, citrus and pine, but as it warmed some balance is brought forward by bready malts and hints of caramel. Nice and smooth, clean finish had a nice bite to it but mellowed tremendously as it went down leaving a semi dry, semi sweet finish in its wake."
"D - A very nice offering from sixpoint... I would have no problem drinking a couple of these and am glad that I invested in the four pack... The rye is dominant which should be the case... Another fine brew from a brewery that has yet to disappoint..."
"Overall: A very good brew. I'm very glad Sixpoint has started canning, because I am absolutely going to get my hands on more of their brews, especially if they are as good as this. I could drink this all day. A 16oz can is the perfect size too."
"Righteous reminds me of a recent homebrewed IPA minus the rye and add another 20 IBU's."
"First impression: this close to the driest beer I've ever tasted. There's enough hop to make this multidimensional. Even though there is nearly no sugar, the body is still rich. Good carbonation as well."
"O: I'd say that this is a pretty positive first experience from my first Sixpoint can. This is a great rye beer that sets itself apart from the pack with an amazing smell and a very interesting mouthfeel."
"O: Great beer, I would easily put it up into my top 5 rye beers!"
"O: A nicely done RyePA. Rye can get harsh but these flavors work well together. Nicely bitter with plenty of rye spiciness. Great for summer drinking."
"Poured a rich dark red amber with a thin finger head. Aroma is very sweet and rich. The taste is outstanding... a balancing act of minimal hops, sweet caramel malts, and twang. Very citrus-like for a rye beer. Bright and delicious. This is the best Rye Pale Ale I've ever had."
"One finger beige over amber red and copper hues. Aromas are wheaty, steel, and that delicious rye grain all over a caramel and toasty malt. Tastes are that caramel bready malt and spicy rye. Mouthfeel is medium and low carbonation. A little bit of acidity is pretty noticeable. This is a pretty good beer, but the hops could be given a boost to balance out the caramel. Not a ton of retention and just sporadic lacing."
"D- this is a very impressive crafted beer. The combination of the rye malt and citric themes is fantastic. Another great brew from sixpoint"
"Overall, its really good, best thing I've had from sixpoint so far."
"Overall this is a great rye beer, one of the best I have had to date, perfectly spicy without going over the top. It's a fine line that many breweries cross, so I appreciate that Sixpoint has done this style justice. Now that it's in a tallboy can it cannot get any better and is the best readily available and economic rye out there."
"it look me a few sips to warm up to this beer but i have warmed. it's not 'knock your socks off' delicious, but relatively tasty and enjoyable. i'd definitely buy it again."
"overall, I'm glad I tried it, but I was not overly impressed. I like hoppy beers that are accentuated by rye, but apparently I'm not a huge fan of rye beers accentuated by a spattering of hops. It was okay."
"Clear, deep copper colour with an inch of beige foam. Good head retention, lots of clumpy lacing. Citrusy hop aroma, pithy rather than juicy, caramel and nutty malts, a bit bready. Nice flavour, malty up front with citrusy hops following, finishing up with sturdy bitterness. Nutty and bready, grapefruit and tangerine, slight hop spiciness, slight toffee. Drying texture, medium bodied with moderate carbonation, leaning towards creamy. Overall, very enjoyable. I liked just about everything about this beer, including the balance between malts and hops (with hops winning out)."
"Medium body, nice carbonation, bubbly and dry on the palate. This is pretty much exactly what I look for in a rye beer, and I'm psyched to see these finally available in cans."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp and a rather heavy than expected feel. Overall I'm really digging this rye beer. Too bad it's not available around here."
"The Crack & Glug came off without a hitch and soon I had two foamy fingers of tawny head sitting there in defiance. This was a righteous beer! Color was 19 SRM, or how so many Lovibond, I have no idea. I would have said 14 or 15, max. Does anyone know what I am talking about? Probably not, which is one of my problems with putting TMI on labels. Color is very subjective and hard to calibrate, but there is a scale for beer color and this one weighs in at a measured 19 SRM. On the Woody Scale, it was a very deep-copper, approaching ruby with NE-quality clarity. BUPGOO, in its most righteous form! Nose was full-on black pepper and I will never forget nor stop thanking the most righteous Sopor for turning me on to Rye beers. He was also way ahead of the curve. The taxation of rye was what sparked The Whiskey Rebellion here in the US and if you really want a treat, try some Rye Whiskey. Smoooth! And so was this beer. It was like it was evaporating from my glass in terms of its smoothness. And the lacing ... thick, dense, requiring a jackhammer to remove. Finish was minty and peppery, but not pepperminty. Rye has its own bite, unlike any hops CAN impart. These guys really let the Rye Flag fly. Cooler? F**k no! I'm keeping it all in my fridge for those days when I come home from teaching and want to die. This will make me feel better."
"Would I buy more of it? - absolutely, positively. Once these four cans are gone, which won't take too long, I'll be buying more...much more!"
"Overall: Very enjoyable! I have now had 3 Six Point beers and they all impress me. I would have no qualms about buying this again."
"Righteous Ale pours a nice, clear mahogany color, and there are a few red-orange freckles shining through. The cream colored head comes up to almost three fingers in height, very nice in a smaller glass. Retention is above average, and the glass is absolutely coated in lacing. The nose is fairly solid, though the malty aspect of the beer doesn't really shine through. Instead the aromas of spicy, earthy rye and resinous, piney american hops commingle en route to my nose. The flavor gains balance and complexity relative to the nose, but at the expense of vibrancy of flavor. There's a definite dose of caramel up front before the rye and hops from the nose come in for the second half of the beer. Those flavors just don't seem as powerful as they did in the nose though. The mouthfeel is a bit off for me. The body is too big and rich and is paired with not enough carbonation. The result is a mouthfeel that doesn't have close to the levity that I like in a rye beer. Despite the lackluster mouthfeel, Righeous Ale is a fairly to very good rye beer, I'll be glad to have this one available in cans on a regular basis."
"Overall this is a solid rye. A quality hoppy presence and a clean malt bill allow the rye to add its qualities to the brew nicely. This is definitely my favorite in the style."
"Taste of a healthy malt backbone, light pleasant caramelization, some molasses and brown sugar flavors. Citrus hops complimenting the malt body. This is a very well balanced beer. I have had this numerous times on tap but this one really excites me in cans. A welcome addition to the NY area Canning line."
"O: The hops and rye work well together, and this beer is as drinkable as one expects from Sixpoint."
"O- A really great session beer here, opens up to different levels as it warms. Just really nice. Good job Sixpoint!"
"I love this beer in all it's incarnations. Equally as good if not better on cask. Just a different experience."
"Looks great in a tulip, dark reddish brown with some nice light color where light can shine through. Slightly opaque. Ok head retention and surprise some spotty sticky lacing. The aroma has familiar Sixpoint yeast qualities as well as spicy rye notes and a nice blast of zesty hops. Tastes earthy and zesty, smokey from the rye. Really nice rye presence. With the addition of a fair amount of hops which are herbacious and zesty this beer has a nice taste balance. The mouthfeel is clean with a slight lingering bitter aftertaste. All in all this is one special beer, almost sessionable, really tasty and has interesting flavors. Kudos to Sixpoint."
"A hop forward rye ale. The base flavors are nice. I noticed with many sixpoint brews that the yeast results in an overly chalky feel which isn't all that pleasant. It doesn't ruin the beer but takes it down a notch."
"A shout out to woodychandler for yet another canned beer for me to try. Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a deep copper color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of hops, some rye. Taste is also a bit hoppy, some rye is present, a bit of citrus, considerable bitterness. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a quality brew."
"A very nice combo of malt and hop flavors. Love the use of the rye and the tropical type hops."
"Wow what rye character. Deep, creamy, thick rye flavors, spicy, with bready malts, some biscuit on the finish with again candied orange peel, other citrusy fruits, rum, earth, leather, delicoius, dank and full of lush juicy flavors."
"This is either my favorite offering from Sixpoint, or at least on par with Sehr Crisp. It's light enough to be absolutely delicious in the summer, but heavy enough to break the monotony of the other summer beers. Definitely worth checking out, and there's no doubt I'll seek out more in the future."
"O: Really a very strong rye beer - lots of rye beers just have a smidge of rye or some sort of other defining characteristic. This is for the rye lover. Quite good."
"O/D-My second Sixpoint experience. I still like the Bengali Tiger more (I really love that beer). This brew is no slouch however. This beer is sweet, spicy, and hoppy...all good things! This one is definitely going to make me grab the other available two in the future (Crisp and Sweet Action)."
"D - Very drinkable. Really great balance of hop and rye flavor from start to end. The flavors are nice and rich and the beer stays fairly light."
"O - a very good example of the style."
"Very nice, tight white lace up the sides of the glass. Held its head pretty tight for a growler. Purchased at Whole Foods- fresh- huge hop aroma. Lots of bite in this one- almost like an IPA, but no citrus like flavors at all. Just hops and rye of course. The rye seems to import and dryness- which is interesting given the hop value here. A very nice, decent brew. Somewhat strong, but backs off a bit to let you really drink it."
"a savory rendition of and otherwise, in my experience, citrus forward style. More on the floral dry side and it may be a big who for those that appreciate my dry, almost salty IPAs. Pour is like all others. Ruby dark amber almost completely clear. Nose is floral with hints of lemon zest. Grapefruit... But barely. Dry. Mineral that is expanded by a subtle sweetness. Not too dry that the beer feels in to waves of mineral crisp with a alcohol that comes after."
"This beer is quite a nice surprise. By far the best I've had from Sixpoint, and this ranks right up there with the best rye beers from any brewery."
"O - Very drinkable for me, and a good beer, but not quite what I'd expect from the style. Still, I enjoyed it."
"The hop bitterness lingers on the tongue a little, but otherwise a very clean feel. Dangerously drinkable at 6.5%"
"If you love rye give it a shot."
"This is the brew developed for the God's. I cannot get enough of the amber color pour and rich, thick head, taste is sweet with subtle hoppiness bitterness. I can drink this over and over again. Excellent ABV content. A very filling brew worthy of your salute. Cheers!! BTW, the finish is the super star, nice and nutty."
"D: A very drinkable beer, very well balanced and very tasty."
"D: This beer goes down very easily; I could keep drinking them all night."
"I think the sour notes and the wood-grain here came from the cask, in addition to the limited carbonation and heavy feel. I think this beer would suffer tremendously with a tap serving or bottle, but on cask, I liked it just fine."
"Sixpoint Righteous Rye is a nice rye ale had on draft at the Abbaye. The beer is a pretty good rye beer with a bit of rye tang and spiciness, but nothing great. The beer is hybrid of india pale and brown ales with a hearty amount of rye added. The color was a clean medium brown with good creamy lacing. The beer had a rye bite and citrus hops with an assertive bitterness at the end."
"I could drink this all day. I intentionally savor every sip as it's just great!!!"
"I could (and did) drink a few of these over one lunch and dinner the next day."
"Drink is good but it just lacked something to me. A kind of bland rye beer."
"D-Good stuff, not just another rye IPA. A nice ale with a healthy % addition of rye malt I am sure. Sharp bite but yet very drinkable."
"D - One of the few rye ales I have had on cask - a very unique intense rye tast, while good I am not sure I consider this a drinkable cask beer, I would prefer the regular draft version"
"Medium bodied with a lot of dry earthy pine hops which are quickly balanced but a very dry earthy pine bitterness that lasts throughout over a sweet malt backbone into a bone dry finish. Hints of caramel malt with biscuit and rye. Very hoppy for the style and not very well balanced with a lot of dry bitterness completely overpowering the sweet rye malt. The ABV is decently masked and this beer is pretty drinkable but the hops outshine the sweetness from the malt too much for my liking."
"A thoroughly enjoyable rye ale. I haven't delved deep into this style yet but I wouldn't be surprised if this stays in my favorites for a while."
"Notes: Good not great. I would have liked some more carbonation and a little more complexity."
"Drinkability: I am starting to get into rye beers and this is worth the try but a one and done for me. The hop profile is in my opinion un-balanced with the rye which doesn't have a strong profile, a one and done for me. I recommend this to those seeking a tangy/ spicy open with a rye and hop bitter middle as a subtle hint of malt pops in oh so briefly."
"So this ale is a rye ale. Probably the only notable rye ale I have been fortuante enough to gulp...gulp...gulp. Toasty, burnt tips, charred bicuit, deep simmered grain alongside dank weed, (the hops), buttery yeast, sticky residual sugar, fruit hops at front, hella malt on the back end, with clean bitterness, jewish grilled cheese, and bod; he must work out. An N Y staple. A rye, the best one you ever had...the best. Ryetit down, Sixpoint Craft Ale."
"Good example of type and drinkable for strong flavors. Still learning to love the rye, though..."
"D - Very smooth and easy going. Would definitely try some more."
"D: Very interesting and delicous at first, but lost it's charm quickly. I'll have another at some point down the road."
"This is a very good beer. Rye imparts a very distinct flavor to beer but it is used with many different styles ranging from IPA's to fruit/spice beers. Very refreshing flavor with enough alcohol to make it interesting. Good dark copper color, great carbonation, great fry and hoppy flavor. This is a very good beer."
"Amber pour, thin head, but decent retention and lacing. The smell was decided bready and malty, with some orange/pineapple citrus in there, and even some nuttiness. The flavor confirmed the aroma, but was very nicely balanced, starting with rye, biscuit, and maltiness, blending in with some toffee and nuttiness, and then ending on a pleasant mildly dry hop note. The body was medium, and very pleasant on the palate. Very good representative of the style, but not quite Hop Rod Rye."
"D - good but not great, another sixpoint brew thats just missing something and has a slightly off taste"
"MF&D - there was basically no carbonation in the beer, but I assume that is what happens when a beer is casked. the slight amount of carbonation in the beer does nothing to hide the fully medium body."
"D- I love rye beers- the few I've had I've loved (Alpine Nelson, BR Hot Rod Rye)- in fact I haven't had a bad one...yet. I enjoy this style and I enjoy this beer. Very easy to drink."
"While not crisp, Righteous Ale will fill the bill after a long hard day. Heck, have a couple with your buddies."
"D: Gotta love the local brew, especially when they make such a damn good one. It's full, it's complex, it's not too aggressive, it's great."
"Some hop and grain aroma. Mahogoney colour with good head. Creamy mouthfeel, bulked up from caramal malt, with c-hop taste and a rye edge. Very good, nice drinkability with food. On-tap at Rattle N Hum. Served at appropriate temperature, not too cold."
"D - Hoppy and dry with a hefty malt character big on tosted grains and breads. Another winner from Six Point!"
"M&D--Mouthfeel is biting and rocky and not really smooth enough to balance out whatever lingering rye comes through. Drinkability is low because I expected a rye beer to match with food and a rainy day, but got a hoppy nearly amber ale (think Troegs Hopback with some peppery notes) instead. Oh well--not bad, just not true to the style."
"Pours an amber-red hue with white head. Lacing builds down the glass in a pleasing fashion. A sweet aroma with floral notes, slight pine and evergreen,biscuits with burned edges. Some dominant characteristics in the taste: grassy, pine, spices, doughy, toasty, hop bite with dry characteristics at the finish leaves a slick aftertaste on the tongue. Medium in body but thick mouthfeel. Definitely a go-to beer for hopheads and rye fanatics alike."
"Notes from and tasted on: 4/9/09"
"D: Solid rye beer. With 7.2% its a hearty treat."
"Medium body, moderate carbonation."
"D: Amazing beer all around. A totally different and incredible beer. Damn six point for not having their products in Albany."
"D: Great. The ABV is low enough to drink a good amount."
"Pours a dark amber/ mohogony color with an awesome head that leaves great lace and has great retention. The aroma is so goddamn unique and awesome. It's super dry and hoppy smelling. The taste is phenomenal. Defintely the best rye beer I've had. It's super crisp and has a medium body. Such an awesome combo."
"Mouthfeel is robust and flavorful. Drinkability is good, especially with pork, beef and spicy food. My first beer from Sixpoint... more than satisfied."
"Not super complex, but with the almost inaudible alcohol, it's scary."
"Had this on tap at both Char #4 and at Back Forty. I love how drinkable this beer is for the ABV- it's a little dangerous! The first sips reveals smooth, sweet malt and earthy rye with a pleasant hoppy finish. The flavor is like a much darker beer but the heavy carbonation makes this drink much lighter. This worked really well with the grub at Char #4, which is smokey BBQ. My favorite from this brewery so far."
"I love how this beer starts malty, goes through that sour, rye bitterness, and finishes dry with the hops. Very easy to drink -- really a wonderful brew."
"From tasting notes 10/4/2008 a the the Gingerman NYC"
"7/4/8/4/15 (3.8/5)"
"Overall, this is lovely stuff. Wonderful example of the style, and I think it rivals all the others I've tried. Highly recommend."
"I was very impressed with this beer and would rank it up toward the top of rye beers I've had. Highly recommended and crazy drinkable."
"D - Great beer, one at a time."
"Pours a murky orange brown. Nose is a rye, hop, grain thing. Flavor has a bit of a burn to it. It's not so much alcohol as it is an intense mix of ingredients. Ryes and hops combine to give a thick earthy flavor. Almost seems a touch like an amber. Feel is thicker on liquid a bit and the carbonation is low and smooth. Fairly intense I have to say, but another good Sixpoint brew."
"Big ups to RblWthACoz for hooking me up!"
"Sixpoint still impressed me with this offering as well, and I look forward to having their future concoctions."
"Had this on tap @ Old Bay Restaurant in New Brunswick, NJ. $4.75 for a pint. Had a dark bronze color, 2 finger lace. Nose had hints of citrus & pine. Had alot more hops and bitter than most rye beers ive had. To compare it to Founders Red Rye, it has alot more bite, but not as balanced. Overall a very nice rye beer, if the hops storage continue, this would be a nice replacement for my IPA fix. Another great brew from SIxpoint"
"Pours a deep red with a vast head that simply will not quit, almost down to the last sip. The aroma a bit weak, but the flavor is vast, with a huge rye taste and a robust spicy cherry character. It's like a great cloud of fragrant cherrywood tobacco smoke. There is a deep hop bitterness that extends all the way down your throat. The mouthfeel is round and satisfying and will invite you to keep drinking. This is a powerfully drinkable beer - but beware, because it carries a deceptively stiff ABV bite."
"HV"
"The carbonation on this on stays middle of the road and just right for the brew. This one is thinner than I imagined it would be but is just right for quaffing (at 7%??)."
"Flavor was pine from the hops, malt, dry wood and a small amount of rye coming in at the finish. A decent beer overall, tasted great coming out of the cask."
"Feels chewy and a bit gritty. Really really thick; sandpaper. Almost layer upon layer of challenges. It's merciless. A unique, brutal beverage. Repeats are simply not an option. It's an onslaught of harsh rye, grain, oak and grass. Quite the hard drink."
"The beer pours an amber/red color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a light caramel malt scent along with a mild hop aroma and lots of rye. The taste is great. It has a tremendously smooth taste that boasts of rye and light caramel malts. It goes down as easy as any beer I've ever had, and it's 7.2% to boot. It's got a really nice hop content that blends well with the rye. The mouthfeel is great. It is a low/medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a great drinking beer. It's dangerously drinkable at 7.2%. Look out for this one. Recommended!"
"I enjoyed this ale on cask via the handpump at the Spotted Pig. The barman was a bit rough, well overly so, and it was a bit less carbonated than it should have been. It was delivered with a thin layer of creamy bone-white froth over the hazy copper body below. Clear notes of rye appeared in the nose, along with notes of malty-sweet dark caramel. Hops appeared, grassy, floral, and even piney...? or was that the influence of the rye crossing over? Regardless, the spiciness of the rye definitely appears in the flavor and it finishes with dark lingering caramel and spice. Very nice. A richly flavored, slow-drinking pint."
"D- This is a suberb beer and was way over my expectations. To go with the Sixpoint IPA I had last week I'm really looking forward to trying more of their beers and I hope they are all as delicious as this one."
"Had on tap at Buk's in cambridge. Nice chestnut red color with creamy white head. Tons of lacing. nice floral hop aroma. Solid flavor of bitter hops smoothed out as you drink. Good balance with a grainy malty finish. A very drinkable 7% beer. Can not wait to try more of their beers!"
"I am very much looking forward to having this beer again!"
"After not having a beer for a while, this was great way to return with pints from a fresh pin of Righteous Rye with a bunch of friends this evening in Rocky Point, NY. We were at Dek's American, which had a pin sitting on the bar, and we were drawing healthy pints for the crowd. This amber-gold ale really had an interesting taste that I felt was a vast improvement over the regular tap version. Bearing the marks of a Sixpoint ale with the floral hops in the aroma, there was a slight cream taste matched by the twang of the rye malt. It was easy to drink if one already knew to expect something different than what memory served about rye ales."
"Toasted malt, bready rye again, with a hoppy finish. Aftertaste carries the rye spiciness for a little while. Fairly full-bodied, similar in feel to some German Dunkels. There's a good presence of yeast as well, possibly accounting for the apple in the aroma. Some mild warmth from the alcohol, but it's hidden well. It's pretty hearty but still very drinkable. A success..."
"D-Yet another winner from sixpoint. This is one well balanced beer that provides a good hop fix."
"T/M/D- More rye than I expected...I was kinda expecting a rye pale ale, but this thing has a big rye flavor, medium thick body and a big round fullness....spicy hops to balance the malts... Easy to drink, so easy I had two, Great stuff....Sixpoint so far has not disappointed me! Highly recommended."
"Smooth/creamy mouthfeel very reminiscent of a nut brown with muted sweet malts leading off alongside loads of cashew/peanut. Herbaceous grassiness appears towards midsip and lingers into the finish. Pleasant and easy to drink, an appealing though unassuming ale."
"Poured into a chalice, reddish brown with next-to-no head (it's from a cask). Little carbonation. Smells enchanting: bitter hops, toasted caramel malts, spices, and rye. Tastes much the same: rich, toasty malts, and the sweetness is nicely complemented by a hop bite and the rye spice. Goes down very smooth for the ABV. Well done, boys. Well done."
"This is my favorite Sixpoint ale, as well as my favorite rye beer. If you have the opportunity, this is a must-have. Very well done."
"A very nice Rye beer for a hard to find style ... seek this one out."
"Pours a nice cloudy brownish color, nice carbonation, nice two finger creamy tan head which last awhile, nice islands and sticky lacing throughout the drink. The nose is malty, slight hops, some rye, slight spices, and caramel. The taste is mostly malts and rye, slightly spicy, and a nice touch of caramel. I can taste the rye, but not a whole lot, just a difference from the malts/hops. The alcohol is hidden well. Light-Medium body, well balanced brew. Drinkable, a nice brew from Sixpoint."
"MF and D: Dry, but very drinkable. Nice carbonation. Full-bodied. Very pleasing experience."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, bitter, and semi-dry in the finish from the rye addition."
"D: It’s tasty, but the taste didn’t really appeal to me, goes down OK, not too filling. To be perfectly honest, I really didn’t like it and had to force myself to finish the pint."
"Overall a very drinkable rye beer. Excellent, but not overpoweringly spicy. Good hidden ABV as well."
"Medium bodied, firm. Overall, very very drinkable for the strength. A superb beer."
"Sixpoint has done it again. This is a very tasty, and nicely drinkable beer. It smells of hops. The hop backbone is there in the taste, and the funky rye is a very nice compliment. It is a bit bready due to the ABV and the accompanying sweetness, but the alcohol is not overtly present."
"Musings: This beer is like cutting into a crusty loaf of artisnal bread - right out of the oven. So fresh and full of life. One of the most friendly brews you will find."
"Very murky brown color. The top 1/2 of the glass has a darker tint still. Moderate amount of lace. Smell is woody and pine-like. Taste is sweet upfront but fairly balanced with a hoppy bite to the finish.The mouthfeel is excellent- a real-palate cleansing effervescence to it.This is another quite tasty offering from Sixpoint. Unfortunately, its just not extremely drinkable due to the fairly high abv and this style inherently is not real sessionable --even if it had a lower abv."
"cloudy like a rainstorm with a reddish-brown glow in the bottom of the glass. murky and foreboding like the red sky before said storm. continents made of foam wisps lie still on the surface, hardcore walls of lacing take hold of the glass' inner sanctum. smells brilliantly of piney pine cone hoppiness and freshly baked pumpernickel bread.. not quite rye although a cracked pepper spiciness permeates my nasal cavity. bold is an understatement here for this strong aroma. once this beer enters my mouth, i can feel the hops, physically. super hoppy with a nice rye tang in the finish. licorice-like bitter spice and lemon rind abounds. crisp and crippling. malt really lays back as the botanical richness and peppery accents rule. robust yet extremely quaffable.. it's just delicious and rich without heaviness. aftertaste reminds me of grape-nuts and continues to perplex me. this beer is a crazy, funky, beer bomb. use with caution, but extremely effective and tasty overall."
"I really enjoyed this beer. Frothy, cavernous off white head, easily agitated back. Strong body. Smelled of rye, spice, and hay. Taste was a great combo of rich malt, spicy prickly rye, and this barnyard sort of grain funk. Beautiful balance, complex flavors, highly drinkable, very quenching. Full bodied with a little tickle. Leaves the palate dry wanting more. Everything about this beer left me wanting more. A rockin and unique brew. Dont pass up on this one."
"An enjoyable beer that drinks well and has all of the flavors nicely balanced. The malt and hop balance is quite well done with each inntial bitter sip balanced by a semi-sweet maltiness. Well done."
"Poured a hazy and dense looking coppery color. Big foamy head on top of this beer. Nose was slightly rye but it struck me as more hoppier. The flavor was also less rye than I thought there would be with a nice kick of hops. However, between the hops and the rye there was a nice bitterness to this beer. Little bits of lighter fruit want and try to break through--but they are no more than hints. Slightly dry finish and fairly oily feel."
"I like rye beers a lot, and they seem to be few and far between so I tend to seek them out when I see them on the menu. Had this on tap at the Sunset the other day, and it blew me away. Poured in a tulip, this American brew really has a Belgian vibe about it, which is odd given the style. Nice murky russet color, and an excellent foamy head that sticks around and leaves some rings of lacing. This is an awesomely complex beer. Super spicy, full of rye character and peppery notes. Also some sweet cinnamon and nutmeg, or maybe even clove. I never thought I'd say this about any beer but I was sort of reminded of a Fantome saison because of the sweet/spicy characteristics. A lot like the spicing in their Hiver or Printemps or something. Excellent. Also, it's got a really bitter hop kick towards the end with a great bone dry, yet somehow smooth and creamy mouthfeel. I'm definately getting this again, and highly recommend it."
"This ""righteous rye"" beer poured a cloudy, coffee brown color with white foam that settled. The smell was lightly malty with a hint of sourness. The taste was malty with a lightly sour, citrusy flavor, together with an underlying, very light sweetness. There was good rye maltiness in this beer. The mouthfeel was dry overall with medium body and medium carbonation. The aftertaste and feel were dry. This was a good rye beer, and the alcohol content was well hidden."
"Nice Beer!"

"This is very good on draft -- I had it on cask prior to this and didn't get to take notes to review it, but it was even better."
"Had on tap over this past weekend at the Sunset. I've had good luck with Rye Beers, and this one was no exception. Turgid brown when served, came topped with some frothy white head. Surprisingly low aroma, perhaps some malt and yeastiness. Tastewise, I really enjoyed this one, malty, slightly sweet, small tingly carbonation. I found it very smooth and easy to drink, but had only one glass during this sitting, due to the abv. One interesting note, I thought there was some sweetness to this one, but others at the table commented that they picked up on some sourness. That's why I enjoy drinking with other BAs, hearing the different takes on a beer."
"Another good one from the Sixpoint crew, and is an offering I would pick up in a heartbeat."
"The beer pours a dark orange copper color with an off white head, that has a creamy-ness to it and good retention. The aroma of sweet malts, citrusy hops and some spice. . The taste is caramely and spicy, with the bitterness of hops and the crispness of the rye at the end. I want to say it has a background of oak, but I don't know if my pallette is that in tune yet. The rye beer and the belgian yeast really compliment each other on this. An all around good beer."
"Drinkability: Wow! This is one terrific and unusual beer. First time I have had anything from Sixpoint but I will be on the lookout for them the next time I am in their territory."
