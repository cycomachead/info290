"Reminded me a little bit of a red ale. Rye notes as expected, a little spiciness but nothing overly memorable"
"Overall: An interesting brew - Nicely balanced and goes well with food. However, it didn't make a very strong impression. I thought of it very much as a Rye EPA - besides the rye it seemed very similar to Summit's standard pale ale."
"Overall : it's a little different, but I guess that's the point. I don't think I'd have it again, it is a little off-putting. A bit dark and garbagey, the malts are a tad on the rotten side and the hop is pretty intense. Meh."
"Summit's ""Frost Line"" delivers a rich, darkly caramelish and malty ale with a fairly distinct note of spicy rye, and some gently citrusy hops in the background. It's not particularly strong as a winter ale at just 5.8% abv., but it also follows on the heels of their standard ""Winter Ale"" at a slightly more respectable 6.2%, so that kind of makes sense; and it's full-flavored, and satisfying enough that it's name shouldn't need to be questioned once tasted. A solid bitterness backs it to the point that it's bitter and dry while still allowing the malt to stand out with just an edge of sweetness which is blanketed by a light cloak of floral and mildly citrusy hops, and then ultimately balanced and livened by the spiciness of the rye. Nicely done!"
"Dark amber, 1 inch slightly off-white head. Dissipates fairly slowly with some lacing.  Odor is very good, a bit grassy, with subtle spice. Relatively highly carbonated. Bitter hoppy initial taste and bitter aftertaste. This is quite a bitter beer - a spicy bitter, but still bitter. Substantial mouth feel, with a difficult to describe malt foundation behind the  spicy bitterness."
"(...) Well-balanced and also in-between-styles; delicious and frighteningly drinkable. 》"

"A very surprising beer.   A pleasant suprise from MN."
"Had on tap. Pours brilliant brown with a spicy nose with a touch of roast. The palate is creamy with light roast, a hint of chocolate and spicy rye flavors. Medium body and carbonation. Tasty and drinkable."

"I can't believe I didn't try this when it came out last winter (or spring, or ""in-between-seasons"" as Summit calls it). Very well-balanced and also in-between-styles, but delicious and frighteningly drinkable. Worth a shot."
"Clear with a deep amber cooler. Nice frothy persistent white head.  Light English hop aroma with carmel and chocolate malt aromas. Flavor profile similar to a English brown with rye on the clean finish.  Good brown ale with a hint of rye.  Like all Summit beers, it is worth a try."

"Overall: Didn't match my memory from last year, which I remembered being more spicy and hoppy... even so, this was enjoyable, and I'll drink it more than once.  I love rye, and a lot of the better rye beers out there seem to bring a certain amount of citrus into the mix, which I'm fine with.  This one doesn't, though, and it doesn't need to...it is solid, as is.  (Thinking about rye beers makes me miss Schell's Emerald Rye though...)"

"O: This beer doesn't seem nearly as spicy as other rye beers but there is a nice contrast between the different type of malts that are used. It is very easy to drink."
""
"o: A good spicy rye, pleasant throughout."

"O - Excellent Rye, which should be no surprise, summit does an excellent job on style representation through their whole line. This beer is not an exception, great aroma, very balanced in flavor."
""
"O: A very flavorful and delicious rye beer. Tastes like a rye pale ale or ipa. Very clean and delicious, but not overbearing. Could easily drink a bunch of these in a night. Thanks again Matthew!"

"This would make for a solid session ale, but I think that a fall release would be more appropriate than a winter release."
""

""
"Overall: A really dry beer, clean on the palate."
"D: A tasty little seasonal. I really didn’t know what to expect with this one. The Rye is fairly mellow to me but complimented well by the other components of citrusy hops and coffee/chocolate roast malts. Nothing spectacular but a nice Winter brown ale for sure."
""
""
"If you like Rye beers I certainly recommend this one!"
""
"Overall – A rather nice easy drinking rye overall. While not top class it is more moderate in abv. then most rye's and is rather affordable. A decent go to rye."
"O. In hindsight, I should have reviewed this beer a few months back when it was fresher. I remember liking it a lost more a month or two ago. Will have to try it again next year."
""
"Pours a cloudy, dark brown color. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of rye, sweet malt, hint of roasted malt, slight hop, hint of caramel malt, and a hint of grass. Fits the style of a Rye Beer. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, rye, slight roasted malt, hint of grass, hint of hop, and a hint of caramel malt. Overall, good appearance, decent aroma, and decent blend."

"Coppery amber hue topped off by a khaki skien. Lacing is prevalent. Odors of amber malt, hints of cut sod and dry straw. Taste pricks the tongue with citrus, characteristic rye pepper and a bitterness of the aforementioned hop smothered over a crackers and biscuits backbone. Medium to light body with crisp carbonation. Presents interesting elements that I can enjoy but altogether this beer doesn't stand out from the crowd."

"O - easy drinking rye beer. Nothing spectacular, but it's good."
""
""
"I do enjoy. It's a good beer, and I can drink it. Very session-able, very warm, peppery, and tasty. Indeed, it's a fine in-between-er. Not quite this, more than that. It also dances around style designations in an admirable way. I like it."

"Nice for something different - like it, but don’t love it. But no one should be complaining about not being able to taste the rye in this beer. I see one more 6pack in my future."

"Deep brassy hue, clear with a good sudsy lacing. Full on rye jacket is toasty and spicy throughout. Just enough hop bitterness with some floral and soft citrusy flavor. One of the better Rye Beers I've had in a while."

"I had a Bear Republic Hop Rod Rye (BA 100) last week and this beer is in that same class. Hoppy, refreshing and overall very satisfying. I had a pint with dinner and stopped at the beer store to pick up a 6-pack on the way home and they did not have it so I picked up a Sierra Nevada Ruthless Rye - it was good but not as good as the Summit Frost Line. The previous Unchained Rye had over the top rye flavor and it was almost undrinkable. This version is AWESOME! Great work Summit!"

"Pretty easy to drink, nothing mind-blowing here. Hell I'd probably prefer this in the warmer months. Makes me think ""poor-man's"" red's rye substitute"

"Jesus, this is awesome. It is PERFECTLY hoppy (a great balance of hop aroma, flavor, and balanced bitterness), and JUST aggressive enough with the rye to cut through the hops. Masterfully balanced; not too hoppy, not too malty. I highly recommend this."
""
"Overall: A new seasonal from Summit. Definitely whacks you over the head with rye flavor. Big rye bread all over the place. Fits in pretty well with the season, easing out of winter with a different kind of spiciness than the Winter Ale."

"Assuming this is a spring seasonal and it is fitting."

"D/O- Good session-able beer here. I've always enjoyed Summit beers for what they are, good, wholesome, drinkable beers."
"O- this is a rye beer pure and simple and well done"
""
""
""
"Overall: Certainly not as good as the old India Rye Ale from the Unchained Series (this one isn't as IPA like), but still a solid addition to Summit's lineup and also a nice lower abv choice for the depressing late winter months."
""
""
""
""
"O - RyePA is a common beer name going around but Frost Line Rye is neither play on words nor a hoppy style. This is a down-n-dirty rye beer, smooth in body but harsh in aroma and flavor with relentless rye character that brings spice throughout and doesn't hold back. A nicely balanced beer though, it drinks wonderfully for the few cold months we have left ahead of us."
"Overall: A really good new Rye beer from Summit. Really nice rye spice presence with some good subtle notes of fruit and chocolate."
""
"All in all, a quality brew that is VERY easy to drink. Well done."

"It has been four years since the India Rye Ale so I cannot make a direct comparison. This one just does not impress me as much. Maybe the way the brewer used the Summit hops in this beer did not suit my tastes. Still a lot of impressive rye flavor to be had."

"pours deep copperish red color with a 1 inch off white head, the smell has strong spicy notes of rye and some mild hops and maltiness but then also has a sort of off putting aroma that I cant place (like earthy smokey...?), odd I hope that doesn't come out in the flavor. ooooh this is great! the rye is definitely in the fore front of this one, very much balanced out with the hops and malt. has a good mouth feel, medium carbonation and pleasant but somewhat strong after taste. good job summit, I wished they released beers like this more often, too bad its only seasonal and not new to the line up. best summit beer released since saga!"
"This one is a major winner in my book. At the price point, I can't think of another beer on the market that has this much character. I'm going to be drinking the heck out of this!!"
