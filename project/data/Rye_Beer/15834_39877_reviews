"Another on-tap Philly airport tasting. Nice rye flavor and nice and hoppy. I think a bit lacking in smell though. Nothing extraordinary, but very tasty. Wouldn't seek out to buy in a bottle shop, but still very enjoyable. Pretty akin to most of the other rye IPAs I've had."

"Cheers!"

"Poured from a larger growler filled at Devon PA Whole Foods into a Nonic glass. Not too much head and just a bit of lacing. Pours a cloudy coppery hue. Faint flowery pine smell. Taste is very hop forward, more bitter than most IPA's in this range that lingers a bit. Overall another impressive entry in Dock Street's lineup."

"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. Overall this is a smooth and easy drinking brew that I would have again if the opportunity presented itself. I bet this brew is pretty awesome when fresh."
"would certainly get this again."

"Medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation. Lingering bitter aftertaste. Pretty average for the style."
"M: Medium bodied IPA."

"Medium bodied, decent carbonation, sticky and chewy on the tongue. Very nice integration of rye and malt into an already hoppy beer - I'd definitely drink this again."
"Overall I really enjoyed this one, as a matter of fact I had two. Well worth seeking out if you are in Philly."
"D: This was my favorite beer of the night it was so balanced and fresh tasting that my tastebuds were pleased with each sip. One of the best beers I have had from Dock Street. Get it when in Philly!"
"Found at the Jet Bar on Terminal D at Philadelphia Airport this shows a yellow brown color, a cloudy iced tea appearance with a whispy off-white head and decent lacing. The nose detects crisp citrus hops, lemon-orange and bready caramel sweetness in the background. Quite tempting. The flavor comes on with a sturdy woodsy grain mixed well with the citrus bite. Carbonation is modest but arguably adequate with a supple, near chewy feel in a solidly mid-body brew. This is not highly rye flavored by my definition of rye (as in bread) but it is a bready/grainy IPA and is very agreeable and equally drinkable. This has some flavor balls, with plenty of bitterness but an unusually strong grain character. Is it rye? A bit. I'd like more of a rye definition in this but no real complaints here. It's a fairly unique, quality IPA with a rye idea. Good job Dock Street."
"This is a favorite of mine."
"Smooth, creamy medium body with perfect combination. This is a nice relaxing sipper at 7%. Should have picked up a growler of this guy as it was very enjoyable."
"Had this on tap at the brewery. Dark brownish amber, clear with frothy cream colored head. Good retention and great lacing. Smell of bready malts, clean/earthy hops and lots of rye. Taste chewy malts up front then the rye hits hard. Almost overpowering rye, not as balanced as Hop Rod Rye or Red's Rye, but still quite good. Definitely worth a try."
"Drinkability: I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. Sipping led to more sipping and I was ready to order another when it was finished. I will revisit this one again next time I have the chance. It would be easy to drink a few of these."
"Rye IPA is by far my favorite beer from Dock Street. The hops in this IPA really sings, piney, citrusy and hearty. The rye adds an acuity and acidity that perfectly accentuates the grapefruit and resinous hops, the mouthfeel is chewy and carbonation is very pleasant"
"Huge hoppy bitter spicy mouthfeel with great drinkability."
"Pours a hazed dark copper with small cap of frothy white head, diminishing quickly but decent lacing. Scent is of bright tropical and citrus fruits with a touch of floral hops as well, a nice backbone of sweet and only mildy spice. Taste brings the tropical and floral hops with touches of citrus and pine, bitter at first but cut by a grahm crackery sweet background. The rye doesnt contribute much spice but instead gives some body and grainyness to the medium bodied brew. A decent IPA, malt forward."
"D - One was enough"
"A nice amber-chestnut color with a frothy white one finger head. Aroma of pine, rye (of course!), and malt...a little sweet; slight flavor of honey, although not sticky. The malt adds a bit of chewiness to the beer. Not overpoweringly hoppy, fairly well balanced."
"Still, if Hop Devil weren't available, I'd drink more of this next time I'm in Philly."
"A very drinkable brew that hides the alcohol content well, making it all the easier to drink a few."
"Not a bad IPA by any means, but the rye should have given it just a bit more bite. Overall, the general impression was a bit darker than ususal mid-range IPA. The level of hopping was nicely done and did not overwhelm the malt - but I was looking for just a bit more distinction. Enjoyable but not particulary memorable."
"Slightly chewy medium body that is on the fuller end of the spectrum. Pretty hop forward with a decent amount of dry earthy piny hops, subtle citrus peel presence, sweet caramel malt and prominent rye flavor. This beer is excellently balanced and although the malt backbone and rye are prominent they don't overpower the hops, allowing the sweet citrus and dry pine notes to shine through. The sweetness from the caramel malt and rye actually enhance these flavors and the balance makes this beer very quaffable. was pleasantly surprised by this one. Highly recommended if fresh."
"I had to come home from school for an appointment. I spent the night at home hanging out with my dad listening to some great music and drinking some great beer. I had absolutely no problem polishing off a growler of this delicious beer."
"Pours hazy, opaque copper with sticky head. Aroma is fresh and hoppy, thick with simcoe hops. Flavor is carmelly and sweet, citrusy, heavy with what seem to be simcoe hops. Mouthfeel is viscous and clingy."
"Overall- Quite tasty. The bitterness is a bit overpowering but the creamy malt makes up for it."
"D- I really wish/ hope the bottle this beer, very easy and inviting to drink but has enough character to make it stick out"
"D- A bit higher than sessionable, but the taste makes it good for a few IMO. I've had a few rye beers in my time but this is in the top five and I was quite impressed. Here's to hoping that dock street can keep up this pace and pumping out some good brews."
"Overall this was a very very drinkable and sessionable IPA and I am very glad I was finally able to track it down!"
"first taste - WOW. you get a great taste of the rye, it sort of disappears quickly after it hits your mouth with a fresh train of hops coming right behind it. in the end it balances extremely well. it has a light to medium body. as you drink more it becomes a bit creamier. nice beer."
"Drinkability: this is an interesting IPA that takes you away from the norm today. Easy to consume and very flavorful, so you will not grow tired of this at all."
"Had this on draught whilst waiting at the Philly airport. Lovely off white head. Transparent brown. Rye and hop aroma, nice. Perfectly subtle. Sweet and bitter, hop/rye. Very good. Ends bitterly. Sort of on the thin side, but still ok. A good drinker. Not too heavy and very flavorful."
"Drinkability is not bad, but this is really more of just a plain rye beer then a rye IPA by my (albeit incredibly jaded) Portland standards. Still, a sturdy beer that goes down with ease, assume you like the spiciness of rye."
"Drink: Yes, very good. Incredibly refreshing, crisp, and slightly dry."
"D-Good stuff. The 20% rye bill really gives it a sharp crispness and pleasant drying feel. Nice job in using ingredients to compliment each other."
"If you find it try it!"
"HV"
"d: I had two of these and would have loved several more. Perfect example of the style."
"D - Man, this is a tasty IPA that is extremely fresh and flavorful! Very pleased with this one, not only for its well-balanced flavor and intoxicating aroma, but also its drinkability. Nice job, Dock Street!"
"Mouthfeel is kinda big, but well balanced. Drinkability is good, but again, this is a big feeling beer. A nice tasty that you can have one or two of."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, grainy, bitter, fruity, and zesty."
"Wa-wa-wee-wa! To call this beer a revelation would be an understatement, but that's what I'm calling it anyway. I order it assuming I would like it, and I end up loving the sweet earthy bastard. This is an IPA that grabs you by the ears and shakes you, then gives you a big wet kiss for the effort. ABV be damned, it goes down smooth and makes you want more and more. Such a blending of complexity is a tribute to Scott. I, for one, would like to thank him for this elixir. And I know I'm not the only one."
"Thanks to jcwattsrugger for bringing back a growler of this for me from PA!"
"the beer smells of bread and piney/resiney/perfumey hops. This beer is made with amarillo and simcoe hops, and 15% rye. It tastes incredible...this is the best local made IPA, ever....to me its better than weyerbacher double simcoe and dogfish head 60 minute IPA. Why? its the rye...it gives it a luscious dry, spicy character that I simply adore in an IPA....Boy am I lucky I only live 15-20 minutes away!"
