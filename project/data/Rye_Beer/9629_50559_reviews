"O: A must try, on par with its competition in Rye's"
"This is strikes me as a different kind of take on rye beers. There is an interesting slightly spicy earthy thing going on, as opposed to the direct spiced tones that a lot of rye beers seem to have. Hearty. I kinda dig it. And, frankly, I wish there were more rye beers around there to try."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours slightly hazy golden straw color with a nice 2-3 finger dense off white head with fantastic retention that reduces to a thick cap. Some decent lacing on the glass. There was a slow cascade of carbonation as I poured this. Aromas of big pine, rye spiciness, biscuit, herbal, caramel, and citrus. Some nice and well balanced aromas. Taste of big rye spiciness, caramel, biscuit, herbal, grapefruit, pine, and earthiness. Strong bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of rye spiciness, biscuit, caramel, and citrus for a bit. Good balance of flavors. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and slightly thick mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish. Overall this is a nice and very enjoyable rye offering. Apparently this bottle was a bit old, but it held up nicely!"

"D - Very drinkable. The rye flavor was a bit weaker than expected and overall the flavors are a bit unbalanced and rough."

"O: C+ or B- on this one. It's another ""interesting"" beer from Short's. I guess this one is more drinkable to the fruity ones they make, but still not a fan."
"I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. It tasted more like an IPA to me. For those who didn't like I think you most likely are drinking old beer or got a bad bottle b/c there was nothing unappealing about this beer in taste smell or appearance in my book. Just my opinion"
"Beginning to think I just don't like Short's. There's nothing about this beer that appeals to me."
"Overall, if this beer could do anything about the aroma, it would be the easiest way to improve the brew. I found it took the whole experience down with it. The beer is pretty decent, but every sip introduces itself with a foul smell. I would have no problem having a few more of these if they did something to change it."
"O: Just an atrocious aroma. The flavor was better, but not by much."
"M: Very chewy, a malt explosion. The late hop infusion doesn't change the rye-centric nature. If you like rye, you should enjoy this one; the rye gets center stage."
"Good introduction for those unfamiliar with ryes. It has the allure and familiarity of a pale but allows you to enjoy the rye flavors as the sips taper off. Sad I only got to enjoy a single bottle."
"Rye, rye, everywhere, creeping in my underwear. This is a drinker. Excellent beer. Joe, I'm going to need more of this next summer, & now that I know how good it is, the remaining bottles won't survive long."
"Medium bodied with a strong earthy hop presence up front that provides dry bitterness that lingers over the malt backbone into a slightly dry finish.  Floral and earthy with some pine and soil notes.  Vegetal with a funky farmhouse feel countered by a sweet malt backbone which is a touch too strong.  Hints of rye, caramel toffee and biscuit.  An interesting experiment but it's somewhere in between a hoppy golden ake, rye pa and a farmhouse ale.  Abv well masked and easy to drink but a strange combo of flavors.  "
"Pours a hazy honey orange with a 2 inch puffy bone colored head that settles to a small cap. Foamy rings of lace stick to the sides of the glass on the drink down. Smell is of citrus zest, malt, and some rye aromas but all very subdued. Taste is mainly of watery grains and a medicinal bitterness. Pretty gross in my opinion. The bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation and is somewhat flat. Overall, this is not a very good beer as the bitterness is very bracing and medicinal in nature."
"O: Not so sure about this beer. The flavor and aroma profiles are quite limited, but what is present is very bold and assertive. Not bad, but I think I'd pass on having another."
"This was a decent beer, but not much going on in it. Shorts usually pushes styles to extremes and this was was rather ordinary."
"Drink-  a nice little beer.  Hoppy, bitter rye forward. So far best shorts beer I have had."
"Overall- I really wanted to like this one, but unfortunately apart from the rye and slight hoppy flavours there was not a whole lot going on here. The aromas were a bit more promising but the tastes just didn’t come through the same, maybe people who love their rye beers would really appreciate this one but I just couldn’t find too much out of it other than the rye and slight hoppy aromas. Would not go out of my way to get this one again and definitely not a top offering from a great brewery like Short’s in my opinion."
"O: This could have been much better if the bitterness as not so harsh. Lots of bitter without a lot of taste or aroma. I love Rye-IPAs but this one was a let down for me."
"Overall= There are other beers from Shorts that I do like better, but like most of their beers, I thought that it was pretty good."
"The appearance clear golden color with thin white head. The nose is dominated by pine. The taste is quite unique the rye seems to be fighting the hops as to who will win the pallete cling....in the end the bitter grapefruit taste lingers. The mouthfeel is good....but it is an explosion of flavor. Definitely worth a try!!!"
"M./O. The mouthfeel is very smooth and slightly creamy and overall a very enjoyable beer to drink."
"O- It's another bold offering from Short's (experimental even?). It's not a beer I'm going to drink in quantity, but it certainly fits the ""super hopped golden rye beer"" to a ""t."" As a big fan of rye bread (pastrami or ruebens anyone?), I really like this brew."
"Overall I thought this was a pretty lack luster beer. I knew going in to this that it was a Rye beer, I just wasn't expecting the rye to be that bold and dominating, I didn't hate all that rye but it could have been toned down a little. The hops imparted lots of nice aromas but when it came to the flavor all it did was add a really heavy Imperial Pilsner like bitterness to it that I thought was way too much for this beer. I don't think I would purchase this beer again it just really didn't do it for me. If you are a die hard rye fan you may want to seek this out but other then that it doesn't have much going for it. I wasn't all that impressed with this beer and out of all the different short's beers I have tried this is my least favorite to date, I guess you can't win em all Short's."
"Overall this beer was a big disappointment. Perhaps people that are die hard rye beer lovers would enjoy it, but for me it seemed like it was really heavy handed. Personally, I will chock this one up to being a poor beer from an excellent brewery."
"I love unique offerings and Short's is always king here. Rich'e Rye falls in line...well worth a try!"
"worth a try if only to observe the combination Short's achieves with a smooth, creamy base taste and a strong finish of hoppy bitterness."
"A very tasty beer, try it sometime!"
"D- I was worried upon opening that this may be an infamous infected beer from Short's but after tasting I don't think it is. Good all around, I just wish about a third of it wasn't lost down the sink."
"D: Great! I'd love another pint and would buy a sixer definitely."
"Drinkabiliry is good. I'm a fan of this one, a very flavorful beer, that doesn't kick you upside the head with a ton of alcohol."
"Super hopped golden malt. Dirty road with a dry mouth. Really carbonated, spewed over glass when poured. Average for the most part - hints of rye bread and saurkraut. Just poured the second half slowly & it overflowed again. Not really all that great of beer by an amazing brewery."
"3.5/3.5/3.5/3/3"
"Pours a light golden copper with a white head and some good lacing. Smells nice with nice, zesty hops and a bit of malt. Taste brings forward a good amount of hoppy bitterness and some sligt spice. Feel is nice with good carbonation levels. Drinks quite well. I always seem to enjoy what Short's does with hops."
"Overall a good offering, but it could have used a bit more to round it out."
"D - I didn't have a problem finishing the bottle, but it's a pretty underwhelming Short's offering. Perhaps it was better in June when it likely had more hop aroma. Stick with Huma-Lupa-Licious."
"Very explosive head on this one. I poured about 4 ounces of beer into the glass and ended up with one finger of hazy amber beer on the bottom and an overflowing head. I'm gonna assume this is just a bad bottle. Lots of rye and fruity hops in the smell and taste. Very full mouthfeel."
"This was certainly not a bad hoppy Rye beer here. The band-aid smell in the aroma pissed me off but is didn't absolutely ruin things or anything. The heavy body on this was really unique though and I'm still trying to wrap my brain around it. I would definitely like to give this one a shot on draft sometime though to see how it compares."
"2.5 D: I wouldn't recommend this for anyone other than a seasoned IPA drinker and even then it's still a bit tough to get all the way through. Mouth destroyingly bitter. Good hop flavor, but much of the rest is covered up by hops."
"Amber color with one finger of head that quickly settled to a thin cap. Moderate amount of spotty lacing is left on the the glass. The aroma is a combination of rye malt and piney hops. Sort of has a Pine-Sol aroma. I do not know what happened to the flavor. Has an astrigent flavor that is hard to get past. The rye and hops do not work that well together. Maybe not the best combination of ingredients. The other malt does not show up. Medium body with a nice carbonation. Good texture. The flavor falls short. I would not buy this again."
"drinkable - no, not very."
"D - At first this tastes great but the after taste is kind of gross. Too bitter in the finish but not a delicious hoppy bitterness like Sculpin or Huma-Lupa. While I'm glad I got to try this I think I'd pass on having it again."
"The beer tastes kind of bland to me. There's definitely a lot of peppery rye but it's missing balance as there are no sweet flavors from the malts or fruitiness from the hops. Kind of a dud taste-wise. The body's a little heavier than anticipated too, odd at such a low ABV with so little sweetness. Worth a try but only once."
"Good stuff. I enjoyed Rich's Rye, but it seems like the bar for hoppy beers is raised higher and higher everyday and as such I can't give it too great a rating. Still, I'm glad its occupying my glass and I would gladly drink it again."
"I need to try another bottle with better carbonation."
"The beer pours a yellow-orange color with a white head. The aroma is rye, toffee and grassy hops. The flavor is rye, toffee and some citrus hops. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A pretty good beer and nice to see something from Short's that wasn't infected."
"D- This beer wasn't horrible, but I probably wouldn't buy it again. It needs either more of a malt presence or less of a hop presence. The bitterness of the hops was too overwhelming."
"D: This is a good time to time beer when I would really want a dry, bitter palate dominator. I would not want to session this, however."
"A solid brew however."
"D: I want to state upfront that I like hoppy beers for the most part. That being said, this brew is beyond hoppy. This is cheek gouging, enamel destroying, tongue blisteringly bitter and I can't take it. I appreciate and understand the effort but this is just too much for me in every way."
"Overall, not the best rye I've had, but a very nice effort."
"Poured like thick molasis with a thin head. Amebery copper tones cloudy and dense. The smell is super dank, so good it almost smells perfect. A great hop presence backed up by a seemingly smooth rye malt. A great beer. Short's delivers again and again. Rich's Rye is no exception. Cheers"
"Pours a fairly standard and non-descript amber/brownish color with a small amount of head that leaves minimal lacing. Aroma is highly roasty with some strong malty notes coming through as well. Flavor is somewhat similar but with a distinct bitter hop presence that becomes the primary flavor. Mouthfeel is nice - smooth and not overly sticky. Decent beer, but not something I'd necessarily seek out again."
"Hop presence is through the roof in the taste, with some mild grainy flavors keeping a slight semblance of balance. Still, this beer is very hoppy with an extremely bitter finish. Despite the bitterness, it is a solid session beer and a very easy drinker."
"D = went down easy for a beer that was so bitter."
"Yet another stinker from Short's, one of the most disappointing brewers in my state."
"The drinkability is decent. No problems dropping this one down the ole alimentary canal for a little in out. Glad I snatched this up off the shelf at Ladd's and Co. Another solid brew from the Great Lakes state."
"Overall a good ale that still tastes & feels like a amped-up pale ale. The texture of this beer is very interesting because on one hand it feels flat, but on the other it's very airy & soft. There's a little hop burn on the inside of my cheeks that lingers for quite a while. Maybe it's the inherent spiciness from the rye malt, (I bet?). I bet the IBUs on this are very high too. Leave it to Short's to make you ponder after you've consumed one of their offerings. Good work on a very unique beer."
"In addition to the astringincy the mouthfeel is also downright chewy and not at all pleasant. The drinkability is awful for one bottle, so what was a candidate for a quaffable beer at 4.9 just doesn't cut it. This was not a beer for me. But, just to temper, still love Short's! Keep pushing your envelope...hopefully in other directions."
"D - Got through about half of it, then I drained poured it, it way to bitter for me. If you like extremely hoppy, bitter beers, then this one is for you, but not for me."
"D - Its an IPA but not an IPA. If you like IPAs, with the abv on this one, you could enjoy one after another. I did."
"Overall- for being a hophead this brew i highly recommend to anyone who loves the bitterness. what got me was the words on the bottle ""supper hopped golden rye beer"" and comming from short's with their huma lupa i had to try it."
"D- A rather unique take on the style that drinks very nicely. Full flavored and low ABV... nice."
"D-Good, but I wish all of those tropical fruits in the aroma would come through in the taste. A bit to sharp(harsh) in the finish for me. A good brew that with a little change could become classic!"
