4.02,13.9,4.25,4,4,4,4,"O: To just call this summer rye is a bit misleading. It's really more of a well-hopped Belgian table beer. I'd push that angle more than the rye angle. A lot of people feel that rye is coarse and a bit less approachable than other grains, so to put that in people's minds first is a mistake in my opinion. They should also play up the fact that it is a beer of true session abv. Get that right on the label somewhere, it's a big selling point these days. At any rate this is a pleasant and crushable little beer that would be equally at home pairing in the early stages of a fancy multi-course meal as it would in your hand after a hot day of lawn mowing. Perfect pairing partner for almost any light salad, ceviche, or other such things.","ryan1788a5","Aug 30, 2014"

3.5,-0.8,,,,,,"an insanely pale beer, almost white in color, looking more like a Berliner than anything else, hazy and yellow, like its all wheat, but there is some substantial rye under the lace airy white head. nose shows some mild spice and plenty of malt heft for its color, and the flavor agrees. spicy from the rye, cracked white pepper earthiness and a dried fruit aspect as well. some wheat in here too though, there has to be. carbonation and body are both up for how light it is, and the rye is the dominant flavor, although not out of balance. I may prefer a moderately larger hop plan for this thing, give it a finish, but I must admit this is extremely unique as a session beer with the hops so mellow. its refreshing but a little filling I found, but still appropriate in hot weather. I like how pale it is, lets the rye show though really brilliantly. my first mayflower beer has me keen for more from them, and that's always a good sign. on tap at the farmhouse burlington","StonedTrippin","Aug 11, 2014"

Foggy and hazy in the glass, the color of watered-down Pine-Sol with plenty of the lemons found in that cleaner but none of the ammonia or whatever the solvent is that they use. Oddly, I detected a distinct aroma of vinyl or... rubber? Something plasticky. The head lasted but an instant. Some bitterness in the nose as well. The vinyl carries into the taste, somewhat covered by lemons and cloves but still prominent. A bit fruit-punchy overall, with a denser body and nice fizz to cut into the summer heat. Still, this is no Great Beer but rather a ho-hummer that you can drink easily. The rye adds some spice and a new tang that isn't present in other lighter fare, and the low ABV makes this a slammer after you finish painting the bathroom on a stagnant and stuffy July afternoon.

3.7,4.8,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"12oz. bottle served in my SA Perfect Pint. PKG on 05/04/10 indicated on the back label. Poured a semi-hazy pale yellow with a bubbly, two inch bright white head - this beer looks a lot like a Berliner-Weisse. Head eventually settles into a fairly solid, quarter inch cap, with some delicate strands of lacing revealed during the session. Nose reveals some citrus, earthy/herbal aromatics and a nice mix of rye and wheat. Taste falls somewhat short of the expectations that the appearance and smell suggest. Many of the qualities in the nose come out in the flavor profile, but everything is a little bland and watery with the lightly lingering herbal/earthy quality that was expressed in the nose manifesting itself, before culminating in a light, lingering bitterness - not really hops bittering per se, so it must be coming from the rye. Mouthfeel is light in consistency, with a lively carbonation and crisp finish. This beer has a lot of good qualities to it and proves that a low abv beer can be pleasant and refreshing. Unfortunately, the flavor falls a little short for me. Still this is a pretty refreshing beer for a hot day and a nice alternative to a Hefe because it has some different qualities.","Jwale73","Jun 09, 2010"

3.45,-2.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"it drinks ok. nothing is oppressive, but I have had more refreshing summer seasonals, as well as more flavorful and more aromatic too. Rye is way too far in the background in this one, and it falls into just another wheat beer category.","silentjay","May 22, 2010"
2.88,-18.4,3.5,3,3,2.5,2.5,"Good for Mayflower for branching out and experimenting with different flavours and ingredients, but I unfortunately don't feel that this beer is all that well balanced.","TLJ","May 22, 2010"
3.93,11.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"F: Pretty bitter actually, not crazy over the top, but a nice bitterness comes through with teh grassy, slight spicy, and pale hops that again have a fresh Cascade dry hop taste. They are accentuated with the dryness. It gets dry, and I mean really dry. Imagine that it just keeps getting drier, and drier, until is really, really dry. Imagine that, being way, way too dry... (don't remember the exact South Park quote but you get the idea). It's very dry. Lots of wheat lingering, with some hints of spicy rye but barely there. This is a tasty beer and pretty refreshing. Being less than 4% it drinks really well too, I could pound many of these without skipping a beat.","jlindros","May 22, 2010"
3.17,-10.2,3,3.5,3,2.5,3.5,"Cloudy yellow, a bit murky, with a fine skim of white bubbles and a thin collar. A bit of lacing, fair head retention. Sour wheat aroma dominated initially, but spicy rye took over as it warmed. A bit of lemon character and citrusy hops too. Bracing bitterness, spicy and peppery, light malt, lemony bitter finish. Light to the point of being thin, dry, a bit of a soapy texture. Light and refreshing, but the mouthfeel was a bit harsh. This one was okay, but it didn't really come together for me.","DrJay","May 21, 2010"
3.16,-10.5,3,4.5,2.5,3,3,"The beer pours a cloudy, dirty dishwater yellow with no head and no lace. The nose has witbier or hefeweizen all over it. You have the cloves, coriander, lemony orange peel, and some subtle spices. The nose is very good. The taste is a real let down and it is from the rye. The grain is just too coarse to be in a summer ale. Enough said. The beer is very light bodied and somewhat refreshing, but it is flawed.","albern","May 14, 2010"
3.14,-11,3,4,2.5,4,3,"Overall, not great. Maybe with some spicy food, but I could never have two of these in succession. The bitter edge in this one just sucks the life out of the beer. I actually think my ratings (flavor-wise), might be too generous. if you want to drink local and support the little guy, try this. If not, I certainly would not trade for this.","OtherShoe2","Aug 21, 2009"

3.63,2.8,3.5,3,3.5,4,4.5,"Reminded me a lot of maybe Real Ale's Full Moon Pale Rye from Texas, just a little thinner though & maybe trying to be too brash in carbonation. Not as much flavor going on, but almost as easy to drink. :)","PEBKAC","Jul 09, 2009"
