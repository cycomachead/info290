"Overall: very good but not great."
"Overall I recommend this beer. My only regret is not buying two bottles. Next time I might try this one with a little bit of the Bulleit 95 rye whiskey added for extra fortification and ryeyishness."

"Just seems a little to smooth for my beer drinking tastes, I do like the ryeish taste it has I just wish it were more pronounced."

"O=I am not that familiar with the style and received this as a gift...I don't like the style enough to purchase it, and this beer didn't change my mind...still, if you like IPA's and rye beers, this one would be worth trying."

"Overall - Decent beer, nothing to write home about but at least trying for a dollar. Wouldn't pick up a sixer of this though"

"Overall 3.75: Probably the best rye beer I have tasted. It is not perfect by any means, but is good at what it attempts to do: create a refreshing, ""seasonal"" (the box said that, not me) brew. Sessionable and probably great with food, there is no hint of its 6.3% ABV. A sleeper, a surprise and worth purchasing if you see it."

"A fair little rye beer that goes down nicely. Nothing extraordinary, yet has enough character to warrant repeat visits..."
"Nice use of rye, not overpowering and could work well as a session beer, if it werent for that off-putting flavor. The mild fruity yeast added a nice English accent. This didn't go down that ""smooth""."

"Rye puns: second only to hop puns when it comes to groan-inducing beer names. Anyway, this stuff pours a clear rusty-copper topped by a finger of glowing off-white foam. The nose comprises lightly-toasted rye bread, watery Sprite, light grapefruit peel, light grass, and a few tidbits of toffee. The taste holds notes of funky orange zest, soggy rye bread, light brown sugar, earthy greens, light topsoil, grass, and a few shavings of oak. The green-y hops just don't meld well with the sweet malts and spicy rye. At all. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slick-ish feel. Overall, this just seems like something of a confused mess, clashing flavors and all. Not a fan am I."

"Meh, nothing unpleasant, but also quite forgettable."
"Overall: With absolutely no hesitation, this was a total drain pour."

"O: Not bad at all, a good session ale. I wouldn't buy it again but would gladly drink many more!"

"Had this on tap at Bridgeport. Nice heady pour, which kept its retention. Decent lacing and a clear copper color. Decent caramel and malty smell, and the mild hops kicked in after 1 taste. For a ryle ale, this holds up well. The consistency of the taste is alittle dissapointing. I found ithis beer needed a bit more hops to balance. Overall, this was good, not memorable."
"one of the more rye heavy rye beers out there. I really liked this one a lot. it pours a surprisingly light and clear color, new penny copper is my closest approximation, radiant, with an inch of lasting white head. the nose is pretty spice from the rye, but there is a good dose of other malts in here, some caramel notes and something german maybe. flavor really has a nice rye spice to it, peppery and intense both at the start and in the finish. I like the hop kick at the end, and there is a fruity element too, maybe a touch of orange peel or something that ties the whole thing together quite well. its not as complex as some other rye brews, but it has a clever flavor profile that was just spot on with a bowl of homemade chili. the feel is just okay, its creamy and well carbonated, but its also a little thin. more body would put this beer into the A range for me. I could also see this working well in a cask situation. overall another solid brew from Bridgeport. this is one I will definitely be buying again."

"12oz bottle, pours crystal clear copper with a fluffy, off-white head that holds great retention and leaves excellent lacing down the glass. Spicy nose with caramel, toasted malt, and somewhat metallic. Tastes are metallic at first, then spicy, peppery rye, toasted grain, earthy hops, finishes dry while the spice lingers with some aspirin. Thinner body, astringency takes away from smoothness. Overall, not a real smooth ride, but decent. Very rough around the edges and kind of acidic at times. There are much better rye beers out there."
"Aroma made up of sweet toasted malt with some herbal notes mixed in as well. Appearance is dynamite. I let my bottle sit out of the fridge for a half hour before pouring. The head was huge and billowy white. Sustained for minutes on end. Body is clear with a reddish gold hue. Almost champagne like bubbles continue to rise from the bottom. Flavor is nicely balanced for this style. A little sweet at first but followed up with a herbal bitter dryness. Rye grain is there but I don't pretend to be an expert at identifying different herbs and grains in beer. If it wasn't named Smooth Ryed, I might not say rye. Nice drinkable body, smooth carbonation. Could drink this year round. Nice all around beer."
