It's average weight and reasonably drinkable, a standard American craft ale. The flavor has a mix of malty, toasted bready rye with a dry grapefruit hops kick that blends right into the rye malts.","tempest","Aug 28, 2012"

3.35,-4.8,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I'm not detecting a whole lot of rye coming throuh in the nose. Pleasant aromas of bready malt with citric and herbal notes, a touch of honeyish sweetness. Rye flavor is much more potent, appearing as if out of nowhere to deliver it's signature savory/spicy duo. It works pretty nicely with the moderately sweet malt profile. The hops cooperate as well, somewhat citric, somewhat grassy, somewhat herbal. Fairly grainy and crisp in the finish. Not exactly a storm of rye, but solid.","PDXHops","Jul 21, 2011"

3.53,0.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Super aggressive pour only yields a one finger head in my standard pint glass. The head in completely white and has mostly big bubbles, some small ones, but for the most part the head is pretty lame. Good lacing throughout the glass is nice, and the head never completely disappears, but it's still not too great. The body is a very cloudy, dark orange color. The color isn't nearly dark enough for it to be this non transparent, so there must be a cloudy factor in here as well. Carbonation looks extremely low, very few bubbles rising to the top. Overall the looks is good, the fact that the head leaves a nice layer of foam on top of the body really saves it, and the lacing helps a lot too. The body is solid, so no problems there. Overall a good look but the head for sure could use some improving. The smell is interesting, because you can for sure pick up on the honey smell, that aspect is there. The pale ale smell is a little hard to clarify though. I can't tell if it's going to be all malt, or a mixture of nice malt and nice hops. Obviously it's not going to be all hops because it's a pale ale, and hopefully it's not all malt, but the smell kinda indicates that it might. All over the beer doesn't smell bad, it smells good, but I'm going to give it a 3.5 because I'm pretty sure it's going to be a very heavy malted pale ale. The taste is very very interesting because the honey and malt are very small. Frankly all the flavors are small, it's really just a mix of malt, hops, honey, and water, not one flavor is much more prominent than any others. I'm shocked at how small all the flavors all though, it's really just very watered down. I mean it almost works for the style, just because it is supposed to be a light summer ale, but it's just too light, it's supposed to be a pale ale, and it doesn't meet that criteria. It does have all the necessary flavors, they are all there, which is good, and the hops are there, and I was afraid there would be zero hops. It's just too watery all around. It's not a terrible beer, but I will say that it is barely getting a 3.5 on taste. The mouthfeel isn't terribly thin, it's for sure thinner than I would like, but it's not as watery as the taste is, it's a decent mouthfeel for a pale ale. The carbonation is pretty damn low, but it's not really offensive, it works for a summer beer I suppose. Drinkability may be it's best factor, not an offensive beer, and it's very light, and somewhat tasty. Overall though, this is just another disappointing beer from Oakshire, I remember all of there beers to be much better than they have been when I have reviewed them. Not a terrible beer by any means, and frankly one of the better brews from Oakshire. It has all the necessary weapons, it's just firing a little short on all of them. We will see if the flavors pump out more potency when the beer warms, but for now, just coming short on all the flavors.","MaltsOfGlory","Nov 15, 2010"

Tasste is the same except the rye is more noticable near the end..and some sweetness from what i expect is the honey..though it seems arfificial. Palate is OK it gets a bit cloying as this goes on.

Mouthfeel is medium carbonation and moderately bitter. Finish is just cider, soap, and mild bitterness. As a fan of other Oakshire products I will try to find another bottle from a different store to try.

3.37,-4.3,2.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"D: This beer is mediocre among extra-pale ales. It is effortlessly consumable, but unremarkable at the same time.

Still, a more dominant hop aroma/flavor profile would do wonders here.","beagle75","Jul 19, 2010"
3.75,6.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"The flavor holds back some of that initial rye spice suggested by the nose and replaces it with a grainy, mineral-rich malt huskiness. Not much hop flavor to be found, but they do supply a nice dose of herbal bitterness. Rye finally kicks in on the finish--dry and crisp, but it's a bit too little too late. Mouthfeel is uppity in its carbonation, but still maintains a creamy feel to the medium-light body. All in all, a serviceable rye beer and a good choice for the summer heat. Thanks again Scott!","wagenvolks","Jul 11, 2010"
3.9,10.8,4,4,4,3,4,"Pours with a pure white head. Aroma is spot on for a pils and taste is incredibly reminiscent of a northern German pils, with maybe 50% more IBUs. The rye is quite subtle and I think adds nice to the hop profile. Living in the PNW it's rare to see fresh pilseners, and even though this is a rye pale it really almost reminds me of a pilsener until the yeast profile appears as the beer warms up. This is quite a nice, light summer beer.","ChrisPr","Jul 05, 2010"
3.83,8.8,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"D: Oh, so very drinkable on a warm July afternoon...perfect for sipping in the shade or (I suppose) pairing with anything from a crisp salad to something spicy or grilled...pale ales don't usually excite my much, but the deft balance of hops, rye and honey in this one make it memorable and earn it a spot in the 'need to have more this summer' category.","msubulldog25","Jul 02, 2010"
3.77,7.1,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Other comments: The rye definitely comes through, which is nice because it is so often shunted behind overly heavy hops or just not present enough to cut through the malt.","GreenCard","Aug 01, 2009"
3.51,-0.3,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Overall, at $4-5 a bomber, it is nice to try and a great offering from Oakshire and a great choice for a hot summer day. However, a little more rye would make the beer a real winner and a repeat choice.","Jebus","Beers"
3.58,1.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Oakshire describes Line Dry as a ""rye pale ale with a touch of Oregon blackberry honey"" brewed with 10% rye malt and 10% flaked rye. It is warm yellow with a plump body and an exuberant white head. The honey lends an unexpected yet intentional sweetness, while rye elements point to a crisp, dry terminus. Personally, I prefer a grainier rye beer as a summertime thirst quencher and palate cleanser. But conceptually I ""get it"" and the honey is ultimately a nice flourish if that sort of thing appeals to you.","RedDiamond","0"
3.46,-1.7,4,3,3.5,3,4,"Pours a golden color with a creamy white head that never fully dissolves and leaves a nice layer atop the glass and has nice streaming carbonation lines. The aroma is sweet hops, rye and caramel malt. The flavor is more sweet caramel malt upfront followed by and earthy bitterness and ends with a sweet, spicy finish. Its light to medium bodied with a pleasant carbonation. This is a very subtle beer and makes for easy drinking. Highly recommended for a hot summer day spent on a patio or outdoors.","DiabolikDUB","Beers"
4.54,29,3,4,5,4,5,"Line Dry Rye is the third Oakshire I've tried, and like their Watershed IPA and truly amazing Perfect Storm Imperial IPA, it too is excellent. My first taste of LDR was at a Hillstomp concert on a warm Sunday afternoon at Papa's Soul Food Kitchen and Blues Joint in Eugene, OR. The only thing bland about this summer seasonal, which was served in a plastic compostable cup, was the iced tea color. LDR is made with 10 percent rye malt and 10 percent flaked malt, which gives it a refreshing dry flavor that is balanced by the moderate hoppiness and malt finish. My tongue must be scorched from too many hoppy beers because I could not taste the touch of blackberry honey used to make the brew. It could have been the music or it could have been Papa's fried catfish, but Oakshire's Line Dry Rye is one tasty hot weather antidote.","bumpqua","0"
