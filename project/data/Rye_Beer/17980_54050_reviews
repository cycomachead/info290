"FInal score: 4.04"

"Deep copper color,  faint aroma of citrus, dough, and rye, ...taste is similar with a strong malt presence-- but with mild hop flavors and medium dry finish its not the cloying malt that I dislike in many ales.  Nice spicy quality as well...Enjoyable."

"I enjoyed the beer and it had good flavor, could benefit from more hops."

"Enjoyed this, but can't really get down on a guy for being heavy handed with the hops, but I think Mr. Lawson did provide freely. He may have had LTS for this batch haha. Very Good, not Great."
""
"Overall- A nice well-hopped pale with a lot of rye spice. A pleasure to drink."

"o: A spicy rye for sure, one of the best I have had of the style."
"O-Once again, not a big drinker of ryes but finally cracked this after going to the Lawson's 6th party. Enjoyed it like everything Lawson's does, but I don't think i'm biased they just make good beer!"

"O: Second beer I've had from Lawson's and this doesn't compare to Double Sunshine. But it is unfair to set the bar that high. This is a very very well made rye pale ale in perfect balance and very drinkable. Good value for $6 a bomber."

"Poured into a worthy burger tulip glass. Dark amber color, minimal head, some nice bubbles around the glass. Smells very malty. Bready, caramel, can't really pick up any hops. Taste is slightly better. Bready malt with the caramel but also some pine and citrus swirled in there, but just barley. A nice spice/bitterness from the rye, as well. The aftertaste is malty. wishing the hops were more apparent, but I knew that they wouldn't be coming in, so I'm not sure why I'm disappointed. Mouthfeel is alright, medium, slight carbonation. A decent beer from Lawson's, but I much prefer their ipas. Still glad to have tried this."
"Nice and fresh. Poured into a Lawson's tulip. Deep amber color, not much of a ""pale"" ale. Smell is fantastic. Citrusy, little grassy, with subtle spice notes. Taste is great. Lemon, some earthy notes with a slight rye spice to balance it out. Very drinkable and delicious."
""
"Pours clear orange with a fat creamy head of tan foam that lasted and left nice lace. Sweet light malt smell. Spicy sweet rye with a touch of lemon and sweet malt. A bold hop floral and a peppery and spicy rye. A fruit skin sweetness and a very faint musk. It smells like a rye beer. Light sweet rye grain cracker with sweet flowers. Taste is pale malt with a lovely hop floral and bitter. My question was ""Is there wheat in this?"" There's a hint of something smooth in the malt. The hops abound and are IPA style bitter. A touch of graham cracker is especially pleasant to the both the nose and the drink. The bitter is sharp in the finish and and there was some earth in the malt too."

"a - deep amber with yellow white head. spotty lacing. great rye smell. some good sweet malt. a bit thin, very rye. water like malt bomb. overall, expected a bit more, but not bad, just not great."

"Poured into an imperial pint. Color was a nice darker medium amber, slight reddish hue. A nice 2 finger creamy slightly off white head formed, didn't last long, but stuck a bit to the sides. After the initial pour, next to no carbonation rose from the depths. Aroma was nicely hoppy, with a small hint of sugary sweetness. Flavor was spicy hoppy, not overly so, and was well balanced. Felt good in the mouth. Slightly over tingly, but coated nicely. Overall a respectable beer. Well balanced and pleasant."

"Body is soft, almost creamy-like texture. Medium bodied, with ample carbonation to carry the beer. Overall this beer hits pretty damn close to the American Pale Ale category, even though rye is used to excess here. Tasty beer!"
""
""
"This beer pours a medium bodied dirty amber in color with moderate cloudiness and just a very light off white lacing around the glass. The nose is just spicy malt and little else. There isn't any hop presence at all. It's just sweet malt and rye spice.The flavors are ok but there isn't much hop presence. The malt bill is nice however, featuring light caramel and light toffee with that trademark rye spice. I just wish hops were present. It drinks with slight residual sugar and on the upper end of light in body. It unfortunately llacked proper carbonation. This beer was pretty middle of the road for me. It is nowhere near Rye'd Da Lightning or other hoppy rye pales."
""
""
""
"Overall: A malt forward Pale Ale done right. Assertive hop presence with complimentary malt character. Higher carbonation would have improved this quite a bit."
""
""
"O: This is a very balanced, relatively mild rye beer. Very drinkable and tasty, but not the best rye pale I've had."
""
"O - If you like Rye Pale's, then this is a great example of one. I really enjoy how light it was while packing a nice dose of rye and hops. If you don't like rye beers, I'd have to say avoid."
"This is my first bottled Lawson's and I'm impressed. It's not a knockout but it's a very well-composed and drinkable pale ale that displays a lot of polish."
"Overall nice, great nose, bit syrupy and malty, but the hops are awesome and add nicely to the rye."
"O - Overall this is a rather nice beer from Lawson's. Good slight spicy rye finish with solid delicious multiple hops. Surprisingly good."
"Clear pour, chestnut brown in color with a small off-white head; moderate retention and nice soapy lacing. Aroma of herbal hops, pine, a bit of earth, wood. Taste of toasted grains, bready, with a nice herbal hoppiness, a touch of orange peel, slightly nutty and woody, nice and well-balanced overall, slightly bitter in the finish. Medium body, smooth and drinkable."

"First of a few of Lawson's beers I have gotten my hands on.Poured into an imperial nonic a clear rich copper/bronze with a large two finger white head that left broken chuks of lace as it settled into a frothy mass.Fruity esters,citric hops,and light sharpness from the rye in the nose,flavors are crisp with herbal and citric hops dominating but not overpowering,a decent shot of lactic-sharp rye in the finish.A nice hop driven rye ale like I like them,a good introduction to Lawson's for me."
"I enjoy ryes and this is really nice example. Not all beers are supposed to be epic.. This is just a really nice brew."

"If you didn't tell me this was a rye beer brewed with a nice blend of generous hops, I would be pleased with it. I do get a little rye, but not as much as say, Red's Rye. I wanted the hop profile to be brighter. So, good, not great."
""
""
"O- A very refreshing and delightful Pale. Not as hard to get as other Lawson's beers, so I suggest people seek this out. Well worth it."
""

"D - This sucker is brimming with hops and bordering IPA territory. I wish I would have cracked this open in June or July, because this has a really complex hop character for a pale ale. The addition of the rye really spiced things up too."
"Cheers!"
"This is a medium bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. The alcohol is well incorporated here. Rye beer? Pale Ale? Ohh I dont think so, this brute is hopped to the perceived IBUs of something more in line with a DIPA. Overall quite good stuff but a bit of a surprise with how hopped it was. Worth a try for sure. Thanks again Heath!"
"This is another well done beer from the LFL, with a great balance of aggressive flavors from the rye and hops here, yet this was still very smooth and approachable as a whole, to point where I would almost call this borderline refreshing on the palate. Sign me up for a bottle of this anytime."
"Overall: Fairly drinkable and interesting."
"O: Great rye beer in my opinion. The hops manage to balance the spiciness of the rye and the dry finish keeps me coming back for more. My travels through Vermont are only re-enforcing what I already thought about the beer scene here. Great, creative brewers putting out some high quality stuff."
"O - I liked this one. I am not the biggest fan of overly chewy beers and I was afraid this one might go along those lines but I am glad it didn't. Can't wait to try some of the other Lawson's offerings."
"The beer is transparent orange, with an average sized head that leaves decent lacing behind. The aroma is of spicy malt (rye) and hops, with some pine and citrus in the mix as well. The flavor is nice, with everything balanced well. The rye component is subtle, but present throughout. Citrus and floral hop notes mingle nicely with a strong malt backbone. Overall, this was a pleasant and drinkable brew, but not anything that really moved me. I would definitely have it again."
"O: One of the best examples of rye in a beer there is, and another great brew from one of my favorite breweries. Another huge thanks Michael!"
"The taste has lots of bready malt that aren't the most appealing to me, almost macro like in their flavor. Dry rye and semi bitter pine hops save this from being ordinary. Pretty smooth body and good carbonation not overly bitter. Not overly memorable for me, but I may want to try it again as many reviews I see have much better scores from people who usually rate a lot lower than I do!"
"Disappointing given all the hype surrounding the elusive beer from this brewer."
"Pours a nice, clear copper color with a thin white head and a good dosing of spotty lacing on the way down. The nose brings forward some light bready malt along with some spicy rye. Following that, there's a pretty good amount of hops, mostly citrus and pine. Orange and grapefruit standout, and there are some slight floral hops there as well. The flavor bumps this up and offers a nice experience, combining the rye and hops quite well. Medium body and moderate to heavy bitterness. Solid brew."
"Pours a perfectly clear bronzed brown with a massive beige head that settles to a finger thick cap with short, broken clumps of lacing covering the entire glass. Aroma is like a loaf of bread with a splash of citrus hops. Biscuit malt and rye spice are the first notes detected before a thin wisp of citrus picks through at the finish. Flavor is a little more hop forward and resembles some of the other hoppy Lawson's beers I've had. Rye is present throughout but it shines in the finish with an exceptionally dry, spicy kick. Light, creamy, and smooth body with moderate carbonation. Near perfect balance of the sweet hops and spicy rye with a phenomenal long and rich finish; easily one of the better Rye IPAs I've had."
"Excellent beer, another masterpiece from Lawson's, & in a genre (rye) that I love. Anybody who wants to send me Lawson's anytime, I'm game."
"Beer is big in body and nice in finish, the overall effect is great. It is not sweet up front, mild carbonation unfolds into a nice hoppy palate, complex, fruity, bitter finish but not so bitter to cover up some graininess at the back, the rye comes out here more than anyplace else. I really like it."
"Highly drinkable beer fabulous in fact. Rye seems to be very well balance. Shines through just right, not under powering or overbearing. Well made beer"
"Serving type: bottle"
"A great refined and balanced beer from Shawn!"
"D: Really enjoyable. This is now the second lawson's I've had in as many days. I like what Sean is doing. Keep it up."
"D: Really great and sessionable. Not a big beer and not meant to be. A good beer to grab and be able to enjoy from start to finish."
"Drinkability: An excellent rye beer where the rye is pronounced. It mixes beautifully with the hops. I could drink this all day and am thrilled my buddy let me split his bomber. One of the best in this style."
"Once again I'm really impressed with Lawson's offerings. This beer looks great, has a big bitter flavor and lots of rye, all handcrafted by a small Vermont brewery. Lawson's definitely know what they're doing and I'll be looking for more of their beers wherever I can find them."
"Thanks to Thirstybird for sharing. 22oz. bottle (batch #83, bottle #63) served in a standard pint. Poured a murky, golden-orange with a creamy, quarter inch white head embedded with ringlets. Mild nose - citrusy and yeasty; that's about it. Taste reveals citrus, wheat and big bittering hops coming out at the finish - closer to a Rye PA than any rye beer I've tried. Mouthfeel is light-medium with an assertive background effervescence that falls just short of prickly and finishes dry. Quite tasty and refreshing, but a little too bitter for the style, in my opinion."
"Very good. In a way, I need to aim more for something like this whenever I decide to homebrew again. There's just something special about rye beers that hits the spot."
"Taste is very bitter! A nice combo from both the hops and the rye bitterness. A Hint of maltiness brings it all together. An awesome Rye beer, keep um comin' Sean!"
"As far as I know, this is the first time this beer has been brewed."
