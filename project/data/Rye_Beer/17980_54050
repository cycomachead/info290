A nice spice/bitterness from the rye, as well. The aftertaste is malty. wishing the hops were more apparent, but I knew that they wouldn't be coming in, so I'm not sure why I'm disappointed.

A bold hop floral and a peppery and spicy rye. A fruit skin sweetness and a very faint musk. It smells like a rye beer. Light sweet rye grain cracker with sweet flowers. Taste is pale malt with a lovely hop floral and bitter. My question was "Is there wheat in this?" There's a hint of something smooth in the malt. The hops abound and are IPA style bitter. A touch of graham cracker is especially pleasant to the both the nose and the drink. The bitter is sharp in the finish and and there was some earth in the malt too.","utopiajane","Nov 28, 2013"

The malt bill is nice however, featuring light caramel and light toffee with that trademark rye spice. I just wish hops were present. It drinks with slight residual sugar and on the upper end of light in body. It unfortunately llacked proper carbonation. This beer was pretty middle of the road for me.

The nose brings forward some light bready malt along with some spicy rye. Following that, there's a pretty good amount of hops, mostly citrus and pine. Orange and grapefruit standout, and there are some slight floral hops there as well. The flavor bumps this up and offers a nice experience, combining the rye and hops quite well.

Aroma is like a loaf of bread with a splash of citrus hops. Biscuit malt and rye spice are the first notes detected before a thin wisp of citrus picks through at the finish. Flavor is a little more hop forward and resembles some of the other hoppy Lawson's beers I've had. Rye is present throughout but it shines in the finish with an exceptionally dry, spicy kick. Light, creamy, and smooth body with moderate carbonation. Near perfect balance of the sweet hops and spicy rye with a phenomenal long and rich finish; easily one of the better Rye IPAs I've had.","yourefragile","Apr 01, 2011"

4.26,5.7,5,4,4.5,4,4,"Once again I'm really impressed with Lawson's offerings. This beer looks great, has a big bitter flavor and lots of rye, all handcrafted by a small Vermont brewery. Lawson's definitely know what they're doing and I'll be looking for more of their beers wherever I can find them.","sisuspeed","Nov 13, 2009"
3.9,-3.2,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Thanks to Thirstybird for sharing. 22oz. bottle (batch #83, bottle #63) served in a standard pint. Poured a murky, golden-orange with a creamy, quarter inch white head embedded with ringlets. Mild nose - citrusy and yeasty; that's about it. Taste reveals citrus, wheat and big bittering hops coming out at the finish - closer to a Rye PA than any rye beer I've tried. Mouthfeel is light-medium with an assertive background effervescence that falls just short of prickly and finishes dry. Quite tasty and refreshing, but a little too bitter for the style, in my opinion.","Jwale73","Nov 11, 2009"

3.88,-3.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Taste is very bitter! A nice combo from both the hops and the rye bitterness. A Hint of maltiness brings it all together. An awesome Rye beer, keep um comin' Sean!","kingcrowing","Beers"
