4.27,0.7,3.75,4.25,4.5,4.25,4,"My on complaint is I let this bottle warm up to room temperature (which where I live is 50) and unlike other bottle conditioned beers this one was a gusher.  But looking past that it was the best foam I have ever had. Nice rye spiciness and the whiskey flavor and aroma does wonders. It's not stout like at all with lots of chocolate or coffee flavors but it is a dark full bodied beer with some nice tones of whiskey and rye. The person who blended this is a magician, well i am guessing it's blended based on the ratio but overall good beer thick warming great tasting.","i4ourgot","Feb 24, 2015"

A bit of a high carbonation level, but not overly aggressive.  Starts bitter, goes slightly sweet, then goes to a dry, hard bitter finish, and even hot at the end.  Good but not great beer.  I've had it fresh and aged and they both are pretty good.  I'd drink it again for sure.  This is a beer that should be shared in my opinion though, it's strong and not overly deep which slightly brings down it's drinkability, but you could still finish it on you own if you're into this kind of beer.","AndyAvalanche","Dec 08, 2014"

Some fluffiness in the mouthfeel that tells me there was plenty of yeast. The spiciness of the rye comes through perfectly, though I do detect hop bitterness added in to try to cut into the sweet and sour taste. Maybe not enough bitterness, though. The one thing I didn't like about this beer was it was a bit too sweet. It was a fun sour-sweet that I like about rye, but both the sweet and sour character were a bit cloying. I wish they'd been cut into a bit with some smoky wood, some roasted malt, or maybe even hops. At the same time, I know this was an experiment into how big and ""how rye"" they could make a rye beer. So, it was fun to try, but definitely a cloyingly sweet and sour taste was left in my mouth that was unpleasant.","ElCommodoro","Mar 01, 2014"

A medium bodied beer that is chewey and has some sweetness to it, figs and plums coming through with a little bit of sugary goodness and there is a woodiness and alcohol kick to this beer - the rye makes the beer real smooth and adds some heat and alcohol bite to this beer as well as a touch of sweetness; the rye is front and center in this beer.

Not much alcohol heat or sweetness, as the high abv may suggest. To me, the 2013 rye-on-rye was the perfect adult candy, with more of the malty sweet and vanilla flavors of barrel aging. 2013 was much sweeter. I'm not sure which flavor profile I like better. This beer is incredible.","Lunny777","Jan 08, 2014"

It's hard to compare to my other favorite rye beer, since this one is barrel aged and the other one is far more aggressively hopped, but it's probably safe to say that this one is pretty close to tied for best in style in my mind. I look forward to it's annual release every year.","LambicPentameter","Jan 08, 2014"

The flavor is much the same with a forward rye spice followed by boozy bourbon notes and dried fruit sweetness, faint smokiness and a lingering oak finish. Only beef w this beer was the cloying thickness of it, but overall a very interesting and complex beer that tastes similar to an old ale with a healthy amount of rye thrown into the mix witch makes this a beer worthy of seeking out.","oceanman907","Aug 31, 2013"

The nose comprises prime whiskey, rich caramel, sweet biscuit, mild oak, vanilla bean, a touch of buttercream, light candied orange peel, and a bit of vague spicy flashes in the back. The taste brings in more of the same, the barrel and the malty sweetness interpenetrating each other beautifully on my tongue. From beneath bubbles an undertow of clove- and brown sugar-heavy spicy notes that compliment the proceedings quite well. The body is a stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a nigh-silky feel. Overall, a damn fine beer, one of the better melds of base and barrel I've yet encountered.","TMoney2591","Aug 09, 2013"

4.3,1.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"1600th review! Got in a trade with Cyde. 750 ml bottle into snifter; 2013 vintage bottled 3/2013. Pours moderately cloudy ruby red color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, raisin, orange zest, brown sugar, spicy rye, bourbon, vanilla, oak, toast, clove, floral, brown bread, and light spicy alcohol. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, raisin, brown sugar, orange zest, toast, toffee, rye, bourbon, oak, vanilla, clove, brown bread, floral, and toasted earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, raisin, brown sugar, toast, toffee, bourbon, oak, clove, vanilla, and toasted earthiness one the finish for a while. Fantastic balance and complexity of dark malts with a near perfect balance of barrel flavors; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy and slick mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic barrel aged strong ale! Fantastic balance and complexity of malt and barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for 12%. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jul 24, 2013"

The nose is buttery whiskey barrel aged caramel sweetness, slightly boozy, with a touch of rye. The taste is definitely whiskey barrel forward with a generous amount of rye spice in the finish. It's medium bodied, barleywine-esque, slightly spice, heavily barrel aged and boozy (but not as much as the BBQ). Wow, what a good beer that presents huge barrel aged sweetness along with excellent rye spice. It's more of an evening sipper at 11% and with huge rye spice, but very tasty and impressive. I'd certainly try this beer again.","ThePorterSorter","May 13, 2013"

It is very creamy and the caramel is very pleasant, there is a slight whiskey note in its aftertaste. Very complex, the more I sip on it the more flavors come out, mild fig and apple, toffee, butter are all mixed in very well.

Aroma offers a nice dose of sweet whiskey, sweet bread, a tease of some fruit, rye (which comes out after it warms some) and a little vanilla. Flavor is whiskey dominant and shows itself throughout the entire sip, it pairs with some bread and caramel,, some rye comes out as it warms offering some spiciness, and vanilla. Alcohol is present but works with the beer. A fuller, creamy mouthfeel. Not too much activity. Overall, highly enjoyable. I am quite hit and miss with Boulevard's oferrings but this one is a definitely a winner. A little more straightforward and less complex than I expected it to be going in, but quite enjoyable, nonentheless, and that is ultimately what matters.","denver10","Feb 09, 2013"

I have to say though, that I didn't enjoy it as I though I would. I can't blame the beer... it was exactly as advertised. But as it turned out, I just didn't like the blended tastes. In the future, when I want rye whiskey I will drink rye whiskey and when I crave a brew, I will have a beer. With that said, its a distinctive and unique tasting beer that is worth a try by true beer aficionados.","Anonymousmark","Feb 04, 2013"

I think the barreling process is a little overdone in this one. I never really say that, but this one tasted more like whiskey than beer, especially in the finish, and it really overshadowed what I assume to be an expertly made strong rye ale. maybe just the blend was too much, I don't know, but it was an experience either way, with the alcohol becoming punishing in the finish and as I worked my way through a bottle of this on my own. full full body, good carbonation and a very expansive feel. lots of booze burn in the finish, and at least a mild hangover awaits the overeager, but like all beers in the smokestack series, this was well planned, well executed, and very original.","StonedTrippin","Feb 02, 2013"

Pours a murky brownish, tawny color with white head and plenty of lacing. Nose is full of caramel, rye, vanilla, and oak. The rye spirit lends a somewhat sweet quality to the nose which is quite nice. The taste starts with tons of rye malt, a bit of toast, light fruit character in the vain of cherry with a considerable spirit character towards the end. The barrel quality is nice and smooth and rounds out the rye malt nicely. A bit of heat creeps up on the end. Body is hefty, but not a big as I'd expect from an 11% brew. Carbonation is a tad high for my preference with barrel aged brews. Overall, a very solid offering from Boulevard that showcases rye in an amazing way.","homebrew311","Dec 31, 2012"

There is also a bit of funk in there that makes it unique. You could pound this beer if you wanted to... no sipping desert wine.

The heavy 11% ABV is noticeable throughout the entire mouthful, marking one of the beer’s few weaknesses, but even here that sensation mostly blends well, reminding of the beer’s origins. Very much worth trying.","jondeelee","Jun 04, 2012"

Rye whiskey on the back of the tongue with a surprisingly light burn for such high ABV. Mouthfeel is a little on the lighter side...should have more body to it. A tad bit watery.

Give it some time and it will open and transform into a beer sharing some “quad-like” characteristics, with dark stone fruits, like dates and figs and plums, coming through flavor-wise. A lighter bodied beer than I was expecting. While it clocks in at 11% the alcohol isn’t a key player.

Pours a nearly transparent dark amber color, some decent head retention, which is surprising given the ABV and Barrel aging. A creamy looking texture to this beer. Smell- booze, molasses, some spicy bready notes from the rye. Woody barrel notes, some vanilla. Alcohol is obvious. This will be a really boozy bastard. Taste- the booze is puckering. its pretty much all I am getting at the front of the tongue, resembles straight rye whiskey. Some nice woody notes and vanilla linger around the sides of my mouth, but I struggle to get a lot of depth and complexity to this one. After the booze, it seems that the flavors are a little muddled. Nothing stands out, but this is a beer that will have to develop in order to be worthy. I'll review again after a year and see what comes of it, but would not recommend to drink it fresh. Not a great experience, not a horrible one.","lnashsig","Apr 13, 2012"

The aroma is of caramel, rye whiskey, oak, and rye bread. All of the elements of the aroma are well balanced, and play nicely with each other. The taste is of maltier than the aroma with more caramel, and rye bread character. There are still a significant oak and whiskey notes, but they are more in the background. There is also a noticeable alcohol presence in the finish that distracts from the rest of the beer. The mouthfeel is full bodied with moderate carbonation, and a cloying texture that I dislike in beer.

My one complaint it that the rye whiskey alcohol is a little dominant for my tastes and slightly overpowers the rest of the flavor profile but regardless it is still quite good.

Lots of rye in both malt and barrel form. I have a bit of a love/hate with this beer. Certain sips are fantastic while others are less than stellar.

This is really smooth and I really, seriously cannot believe this is 11%. To me, this has a nice, creamy body, the flavor of rye as advertised, mixed with a bit of citrus and oak, well hidden booze, big carb and that's about it. ...and what more could ask for?

The appearance is nice, above average for barrel aged beers of any variety, and the mouthfeel is great for the flavor profile presented here (as well as objectively and independently). The taste and aroma fall a little short, I think, though I'm not sure why - even when fully developed and near room temperature, it seems to fall a little flat. Now, relatively speaking within the broader spectrum of Boulevard beers (perhaps an unfair point of comparison), this beer is perhaps at even more of a disadvantage - their BBQ and Imperial Stout were both a little better than this one, and most of their Smokestack Series has been uniformly outstanding. Don't get me wrong, this is a really good brew - it's just not a great brew. Still worth a try (not that there are any left on the shelf now).

Full-bodied and a real mouth filler, the carbonation ensures every pore covered cheek to cheek. Sweet without turning dulcet, caramel, butterscotch, vanilla fudge and carob, the raw whiskey flavors doesn't choose sides, dry in that heady, boozy fashion. The rye much stronger here, cuts the sweetness and lends a bitter burst. The orange citrus juicy and sweet, same for the concentrated apricot, peach, cherry, banana fruit flavors.

Also hints of vanilla and toffee. Just a touch of sweetness in the finish that gives a clue to the base beer before it was barrel aged. Not a bad tasting beer, actually enjoyable if you enjoy rye whiskey, but it seems the barrel aging got away from them or they should of adjusted the blend a little. The body feels full and creamy.

To be expected (if I am reading the bottle right) as it's less than three months old. The bottles that I have cellared will be fun to open in 6 months or a year to see how time has changed the flavors. The mouthfeel is creamy, with a medium amount of carbonation.

4.2,-0.9,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Lots of rye whiskey on the tongue; this beer is still a bit green. But even in its early stage, the alcohol isn't overly hot or taxing on the tastebuds. Chewy caramel and toffee malts add a sticky, brown-sugary base that is balanced well by a crisp, piny hop profile and lots of rye spices. I can't wait to see how this beer matures in a year. Mouthfeel is a little thick and syrupy, and the rye whiskey weighs heavily on the palate. But still, this is an excellent beer, and I can't wait for another taste. Highly recommended.","wagenvolks","Mar 13, 2010"

4.1,-3.3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"750ml bottle $13. Nice dark, tawny color. It smells like strong rye whiskey but is oddly pleasant and I do not like whiskey at all. i could not stop sniffing away at this and the more I drank the more the whiskey faded into something sweet. The flavor was very similar to the smell, rye whiskey with sweet notes, barley, maltiness, just a really nice tasting beer. Overall, this is a perfect beer to share or sip with a friend. Once again Boulevard has impressed me.","ArrogantB","Mar 03, 2010"

4.62,9,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer pours a dark, caramelized brown sugar with a massive 4 inch beige-cream head that leaves a surprisingly large amount of lacing down the sides of the glass. This could very be the best head retention on any barrel-aged beer I've ever had. An inch of frothy head always is sitting squarely on top of the beer when I go to take a sip. At first whiff, caramel and toffee from a malt centric beer. As the aroma develops the rye really lends a spicy freshly ground black peper to the aroma. Also vanilla and charred oak from the Templeton barrels. This really has an extremely developed aroma. The flavor is just as complex as the aroma. Rye really develops up front lending a spicy black pepper harshness that's rounded out by caramel and toffee, toasted bread and vanilla. The only fruit note I get from the flavor profile is a slight green apple flavor on my lips that really works well. Also just a slight bit of oak on the very tail of the profile. As this beer warms, the 11% really starts showing. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy and leaves a vanilla booziness on the palate. My one knock on it, as Rye-on-Rye warms it starts becoming pretty boozy. In my opinion, this could well be the best barrel aged beer that Boulevard has put out to date.","hwwty4","Feb 25, 2010"
4.05,-4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,"Some rich toffee sweetness on the front of the tongue, lively carbonation leads to a distinct whiskey taste, ending with a spicy burn that reminds you this is a sipper. The warm whiskey fade goes on and on, in a good way, it just limits quantity. I wouldn't open one of these by myself, whew!","brownbeer","Feb 24, 2010"
4.35,2.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Mouthfeel is a little lighter than I expected, plus the carbonation is very aggressive. It smooths itself out in the end. Not a flaw but more of a surprise. This is a great sipper and demands some summer sausage.","bort11","Feb 22, 2010"
