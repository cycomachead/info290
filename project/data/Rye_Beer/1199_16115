I'd be tempted to buy another one of these and see if it was a bad beer.  I enjoy Founders brews but I have to rate what is in front of me.  That being said I have to knock some points off this one for the "chlorine" smell/taste.","fscottkey","Yesterday at 06:30 PM"

It just goes well and makes it a brew I can enjoy any time. I didn't get to try this back the first go round, but I'm glad they released it.

4.51,11.9,4.5,4.75,4.5,4,4.5,"Black Rye is a beautiful opaque obsidian shade, and a stubborn antique white head encircles the perimeter of the glass after the initial pour. Quite a bit of lacing is left artfully behind. A lively woodsy aroma comes off the brew, with bitter citrus, oak smoke, whiskey grains, burnt toast, and a touch of brown sugar as well. I am loving this! First of all I must say that this is very soft and smooth, and lighter-bodied than expected, however, there is a bit of a warming sensation following a good gulp. The hops are in the foreground, and they present themselves in a nicely dry and bitter way. I'd say these are almost herbally pungent, in essence. The roast and rye serve to compliment the hops with subtle grace. I would strongly recommend this to any person who likes to explore the complexities of hop bitterness in a unique way.","Neorebel","Mar 28, 2015"

Definitely rye on the nose, along with some roasted malt and citrusy hops.  Flavor is crisp citrus hops followed by roasted malt with a dry, semi-bitter finish.

Aroma is dark malt, roast, cocoa, toffee, faint coffee, smoke, pumpernickel bread, brown sugar, some caramel & spice. Taste is dark malt, burnt dark bread, bold rye maltiness & spice, molasses, smoke, prune, brown sugar, tobacco & a lively bitter finish that lingers long in the burnt malt, smoky, dry aftertaste. As with a number of rye beers a metallic note emerges in the background & becomes most prominent in the aftertaste but is not detracting .

Citrus peel and a touch of twiggy pine.  To my surprise I then discovered a lightish chocolate scent and a bit of bread.  taste is very unique.  The malt in this one is full but strict.  It has a bitterness that is up front to the palate.   Smooths out after the first sip to show you a very brisk palate of dark malt.  Chocolate that is not too sweet and a touch of smooth weaker coffee.  The citrus peel is just bright to the flavor so it's not out of place .  Only a light pine in the finish and it does finish crisp and with that rye to come to the aftertaste pretty strongly.  Mouthfeel is on the fuller side.

We had though this was long since retired, but were happy to see its name up on the tap board.  Through our critique, we found this to be much more along the lines of a rye porter or rye-heavy stout, when compared to your typical rye ales that are becoming more and more popular.  It certainly takes its “dark” label to nice and new depths across all aspects and departments, making for a uniquely experienced beer.  The grain is wonderfully represented, especially the heavy roast to it, and the authenticity of the rye.  This gives a fuller presentation to it.  Very bold and heavily drying, stylistically, and it seems almost naughty, like smoking a cigarette where you’re not supposed to.","TheBrewo","Jan 27, 2015"

4.21,4.5,4.5,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Overall I thought this was a really nice beer and I thought it was a good example of the style, it had three main aspects, roasted malt, hops and rye, they were all represented nicely with no single aspect sticking out too much and being overpowering.  This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, crisp, slightly creamy, dry on the finish, a little filling and the taste did a good job at holding my attention, I think two would be a good amount for me, anymore than that and it might start to be too filling for me.  What I like the most about this beer was the balance it was just where it needed to be and it made for a really nice beer.  What I like the least about this beer was nothing, there isn't anything that I disliked or would change about this beer, it's good just the way it is.  I would buy this again, it would be nice to have on hand for when I feel like a dark rye beer  I would recommend this to anyone likes Rye beers, I think it's worth a try and it's similar to a Black IPA, but it doesn't seem to be as bitter as most.  All in all I was happy with this beer and just a little impressed, Founders shows just how talented they are with how great of balance this beer has, I get all the aspects that I'm looking for and they don't step on each others toes and I don't think that's easy to do when it comes to a beer like this.  This isn't a favorite from Founders but it is one of the better examples of a Dark Rye beer that I've had.  Good job guys, this was one tasty beer, keep up the hard work.","StoutHunter","Jan 05, 2015"

Pumpernickel bread. Dehydrated cereal grains. Flavor is a makes me think stout more than Black IPA. He notes on this page say it's 64 IBU but the label says 78 IBU. Bitterness is lingering. It isn't preposterously bitter. Roast, dark neutral chocolate, piney hops. A bit of burnt rye bread. Just the tiniest whisper of minty hop. Fuller bodied. Long, hidden bitterness. Bitter from hop and dark malt. Medium carbonation. I recently purchased a four pack of Founders' dark penance and it was far too bold for my taste. I was nervous about this one being too similar but it's a full standard deviation below Dark Pennance in terms of ridiculously coercive flavors. Probably going to take some time to burn through the four pack; I imagne another bomber and sixer might be purchased and drank before I finish this quartet. I still trust Founders.","VelvetExtract","Jan 02, 2015"

Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, chocolate, cocoa, coffee, spicy rye, brown bread, floral, grass, and floral/roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/pine hops and moderate roasted/bready malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, chocolate, cocoa, coffee, spicy rye, brown bread, floral, grass, and floral/roasted earthiness. Good amount of pine/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon/orange zest, pine, chocolate, cocoa, coffee, spicy rye, brown bread, and floral/roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of citrus/pine hops and moderate roasted/bready malt sweetness; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, moderately sticky, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent black rye IPA style. All around great complexity and balance of citrus/pine hops and moderate roasted/bready malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 21, 2014"

Roasted malty coffee flavors remind me of a warm porter. Again the tangy spicy sourness from the rye comes out. I've recently become interested in rye beers.

Very spotty lacing on the sides, could use some help in this department. The nose of this one is probably the best characteristic of this beer. There's a wonderful explosion of fresh grassy rye and dark smokey chocolate. Fresh ground coffee with a subtle citrus hop bite. In a way I could find people really disliking this smell, but I find it complex and very appealing. Taste is very similar to the smell. Fresh burst of citrus up front with a chocolate and carmel malt undertone. Toasted rye flavors are presesnt from start to finish which gives this beer a very unique and crisp bite. Aftertaste is somewhat dry and clean with a fairly bitter feel. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a fair carbonation. I just recently had Bell's Rye Stout and find these two beers to be fairly similar in taste. Bell's was more creamy and Founders has more of a bite. Another solid brew from Founders.","BeerTruth","Dec 10, 2007"

The first mouth full through the beast is creamy and full bodied. Initially you can enjoy a chocolaty aroma from about a foot away from this one. As the head subsides the rye character sneaks out from beneath the cocoa. Full flavored, the taste is quite similar to the nose. A hoppy finish balances the malts out nicely.

The aroma is somewhat reminiscent of a stout but also has shades of smores being cooked over a campfire. There was an abundance of roastiness in the flavor, but not quite what you would find in a stout, more like toasted rye bread than roasted barley. Bitter espresso and dark chocolate linger in the finish. The beer is medium bodied with a slight amount of carbonation but nothing too aggressive. This is certainly one of the most interesting dark beers I've ever had, clearly not one to fall into either the porter or stout classification.

Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and viscous, with (again) a huge bitter java bite to the finish. This beer is good, if not very good, but it's a bit much to be able to stomach more than one per setting.

Something crazy in the pour of this whole sixer - huge (4") tan head, frothy, if a little excessive. Beer is mahogany with nice red highlights. Looks great and I'll blame the giant head on mishandling. Nose is crazy spicy malt, turns more roasted as it continues. Molasses, some light dried fruit. Taste is much more roasted than the nose. Spices go strong on the tip of the tongue. Some bittering hopes at the back end and in the fairly short aftertaste. No real sweetness to this one. Too carbonated and fizzy, although the body's good.

A little bit coffee like, with a little bit of hops and malted rye in the background. Taste had a nice smooth malty kick to it.

The flavor is rather complex. A medium roasted/burnt malt note is delivered upfront, followed by moderate hop bitterness, and moderate-high hop flavor. The finish is rather smooth and has a crisp, dry rye character with a pleasant hint of roast and hop flavor lingering on the tongue. Carbonation is medium and body is medium to medium-full. Overall I really enjoyed this brew. It was nice to see the hop aroma shine along side the roasted/chocolate aroma and the flavor is very well done.

Produces an immense, rocky tan head which slowly settles to a durable 1/4" coating. An amazingly complex aroma greets the nose with upfront notes of dusty/earthy hops, spicy crushed caraway seeds, rye, dark roasted malts and cocoa. Found the palate to be full, but was way too spritzy for the style. Less CO2 would have provided a silkier mouthfeel. Flavors seemed a bit more subdued as compared to the aromas. However, lots semi-sweet burnt malt and chocolate initially, followed by a firm hit of an earthy and citrusy hop presence. A subtle taste of spicy rye grain is left on the tongue in the finish. A very unique and pleasing dark ale. Perhaps a dark IPA to be more precise. Worth seeking out for sure.","macster","Jan 12, 2007"

3.78,-6.2,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Poured into nonic, mahogany-esc color, almost opaque except for shades of red as its held to light. Huge full off white head looks like some crazy root beer float. Smells of dark toasted malts right up against a grainy rye character, both chocolate and coffee notes run through out with a slightly nutty smokiness and a tinge of grapefruity citrus from the hops. Taste is predominantly subtle bitter chocolate flavor, the rye is more present when its cold, as it warms up it becomes way more tolerable. Starts with a medium sweetness then dry smokiness backed by a slight chocolate coated grapefruit flavor, finish (after it warms) is mellow dark roast coffee, mediated by rye. The mougthfeel on this is sort of grainy, because of the rye I assume. At first when I was drinking this I was on the fence, it basically comes down to this if you like rye you will love this, but if not it might be a bit more of a task.

Some hops up front, then a deep bitterness from roasting, followed by spicy rye flavors and a little grainy sourness on the aftertaste. Its very dry, but there are cream and dark chocolate flavors here as well. The mouthfeel is medium weight, but bitter tannins and creaminess are nicely in balance.

Plus something else I can;t quite put my finger on, probably the rye?? Taste is of coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malts, slight hops, with a constant lingering rye undertone which stays with you after the sip is over and done with. Very dry.

Aroma of yeast, burnt coffee beans and a strange quality (that I must assume is due at least in part to the rye) that reminds me of rising bread dough crossed with a pool liner. On the palate, zesty hops give way to sweet-and-spicy malts that possess an earthy, still-fermenting quality. Full carbonation pumps up the gravity artificially, but not unpleasantly -- I'd say the mouthfeel is actually the best aspect of this beer.

There are also hints of garlic here and there in this beer, giving it a big doughy character. Mouthfeel was as usual with all the Founder's beers ive tried so far, damn near perfect.

Nose is fruity and grapy, with tangy citric hops presence over some chocolatey roasted grains akin to English porter style. Very inviting nose. Taste is heavily roasted with a faint grape flavor, and a blast of bitter hops. Very unique. A bit like an American porter. I think the rye is adding the fruity/grape brightness as well as some more characteristic rye bread aftertaste. Theres some chocolate going on beneath all that. Surprisingly goodI was expecting to be disappointed, but this stands its ground among dark beers, with a unique twist. Mouthfeel is a bit towards the thinner side of things, with fairly pronounced carbonation, but not in a disappointing way.

4,-0.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Black with ruby highlights. Thin, dark tan head with good retention and some lacing. Chocolatey, roasted malt aroma is balanced by strong citrus and pine hoppiness. Slight spiciness as well. Malt sweetness and chocolate kick off the flavour, followed quickly by leafy and citrus hops. The rye imparts an oily spice to the malt towards the end. Bitterness builds through the finish, but stops short of being aggressive. Lingering hops and a hint of alcohol warmth. Moderate carbonation, slight stickiness with full body and light dryness. Alcohol warmth grows as it warms up. A unique combination of flavours, not something you run into on a regular basis.","DrJay","Nov 21, 2005"

For some reason I can't detect the rye in the beers flavor. I have tried Founder's Red's Rye and the rye is evident. I have even brewed with rye and can easily tell its a rye beer. Perhaps the chocolate malts are strong enough to disguish the spiciness of the rye malt. That being said, this beer is to me a cross of an American brown and a porter. Chocolately, slightly smoky, crisp like a black lager (is this how the rye is presenting itself?). Aroma is warm and of alcohol. Crisp mouthfeel.

Taste confirms the baffling nose, intense bitter hops, bitter rye malts with uncanny subtle toasty, bready, coffee undertones. A beer that pours like a stout, but smells, tastes, and feels like a hoppy IPA? Quite a trick, it's amazing how dark this is without considerable roasted malts or coffee flavors.

Looks like a stout, and smells like one too, roasted coffee along with the promised rye. Tastes hoppier than the smell, a floral hoppiness, which contrasts well with the chocolate and coffee malt flavor. Creamy mouthfeel. One of the most interesting beers I've had. I think it's interesting how the rye, though part of the malt, has a hop-like character, and I think that putting it in a sweet, malty, stoutish beer really showcases that well. Fascinating.","battlekow","Sep 27, 2005"

The appearance surpassed expectations, and poured a solid black with slight ruby highlights, and a thick tan head that retains extremely well. Aroma reminds me of rogue shakespeare stout; chocolate, coffee, roasted barley, and a nice dose of citric and floral hops with a sour background. Taste begins with flavors of bittersweet chocolate, coffee, fig, sourdough bread and oily, resiny hops. There is a cloying sweetness reminiscent of blackstrap molasses that is quickly overtaken by the hops. This is my first rye beer, and i really enjoy it but find it not that different from just an ordinary stout, or perhaps a porter due to the hoppiness. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with moderate carbonation and a crisp, bitter finish. The alcohol becomes more noticeable as it warms but it's still surprisingly drinkable.","silver0rlead","Jun 24, 2005"

Lots of little floaties in here, and the carbonation has them moving all around. Head is heavy froth, and lasts throughout the drinking experience, with foamy lacing prevalent. Aroma is toasty burnt rye. Taste starts with that same toasted grain, and balances well with some piney hoppiness. The rye flavor lingers on the tongue, even after swallowing. As it warms, chocolate joins the party as well. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both great. Nice one here, give it a try.","ppoitras","Jun 03, 2005"

Close your eyes and inhale and you'd think its a pale ale. Lots of clean citrous and floral hops hit the snout, as well dark malts. Taste starts off a little light and crisp, with surprisingly strong hops. Suddenly, you are rushed by huge bitter chocolate and roasted grain. Some coffee is there as well. Sharp rye characters are present, but subtle. Moutheel is pretty full and creamy from the large malt bill, but the assertive hops keep things crisp. I wonder if you made a black and tan using an IPA if it would turn out like this. It is the best of both worlds. There is the huge malt profile of a good stout, but they wonderfully hoppy qualities of an IPA. This beer really took me by surprise.","BeerFink","May 13, 2005"

Very bready, notable hints of rye, backed up by roasted chocolate malts and molases. Taste is even better. I love the taste of rye in beer... before this one all I'd come across was Bear Republic's Hop Rod Rye, which is one of my all time favorites. This has similar rye characteristics, nice and spicy, but also has a good deal of robust chocolate malts and burnt bitter coffee in the end, almost like a nice smoked porter. Nice hoppy bite in the finish. This beer is dark, but unlike the big huge stouts and porters this beer has a really great mellow mouthfeel, medium full, and oh so smooth and creamy.

4,-0.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Surprising darkness in the color...much more sinister than expected (however, it DOES say "black" in the label....). Aggressive pour yields a finger-thick layer of tan-colored head that is "big-bubbled" and sticky. Good lacing of the glass. Aromas are quite similar to that of a well-hopped stout: large, lots of toasty malt, and a strong hop presence. Flavor was fine, with a hefty amount of creamy mouthfeel. Hoppy from the get-go, with a bit of chocolate moving in during the middle, and finishing with a pronounced dryness. Drinkable. Another successful rye beer for me.","OldFrothingSlosh","Apr 29, 2005"

Dark cola-brown/bordering on black with a big old three finger head of tannish foam. Carbonation is lost in the opaqueness of this brew. The head has some big bubbles in it though. Carbonation is smooth. Aroma is good, more green, hoppy stout like than anything else. The rye is there, but it is in the background. The taste is great. Well blended, smooth, and it even tastes aged? I taste some rye, fresh hops, a bit of chocolate, coffee, and hints of herbs as well. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and drinkability is very good.

The lacing holds from the original mark and runs all the way down the inside of the glass (and outside if you would let it). The nose is like creamy milk chocolate and black coffee. The color is.. well.. Black.. although that may be stating the obvious, when held up to the light you can see reddish highlights breaking through. It is heavily malted, yet remarkably smooth and drinkable. I keep searching for the hops in the nose, and there is something green there.. but it becomes more obvious in the taste.

Decent amount of bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel is fairly smooth and creamy up front, but still has an edgy feel to it on the finish. It's fairly unique in that it starts oily and finishes rather dry. Drinkability is good. I could have a couple, but I think this is a beer that could be one to "suit your mood" rather than be an everyday session beer.","aaronh","Mar 29, 2005"

Creamy tan head is two inches tall and retains well, leaving enormous splotches of lace all over the glass. Aroma begins with hoppy spruce and grapefruit, with dark roasty espresso notes and rye bread crust quick to follow. Mouthfeel is silky rich, almost full bodied, with tingly spicy hops and rye tickling the palate. The taste is complex, with bitter and acidic dark roasty malts, pine cone hops, spicy rye grain, and rye bread notes. Delicious flavors mingle all over the palate, and are never overly bitter. Wow! This is one tasty brew. Exceptional balance. This is just about the perfect beer, with outstanding aroma, appearance, taste, and mouthfeel. A sublime sipping experience that is immensely pleasant.

The smell was malty with spicy hops, but was a modest aroma. The taste was malty with a rye malt bite, together with spicy hops. There was a touch of caramel, and a very hoppy finish. The mouthfeel was smooth but sharp due to the hops and the rye. The body was medium with good carbonation. This was a good, very hoppy rye beer. Or was it a rye IPA?","UncleJimbo","Mar 13, 2005"
4.35,7.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"I can say that this is definately interesting. I'm not too sure how well the often burnt flavors meld with the citrusy punch of the hops, but it's quite easy to take on. Not my favorite from Founders, but definately another solid brew.","Skidz","Mar 11, 2005"
3.93,-2.5,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Picked this up on my last trip to Cincinnati. Pours a very dark color with a moderate head that sticks around a while and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma is subtle with hints of rye and lots of dark malts. The flavor doesn't have much rye character - more of a slightly light stout. But it makes for a good stout. Thick body and easy to drink, but only a hint of rye in the flavor. Still tasty.","clvand0","Mar 11, 2005"
4.12,2.2,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,"The 'darkness imprisoning me' hits my tongue and I taste chocolate malts along with the rye. Tastes similar to a mocha java stout in my humble pie eating opinion. It feels medium bodied, decently carbonated. I think I could have a few of these but it is more of a single serving beer. Another good brew by Founders.","HogHill","Mar 07, 2005"

3.58,-11.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Dark brown with orange highlights and a medium tan colored head. The aroma has a nutty-sweet character that the rye usually brings accented by more malty sweetness (dates), and a mild doughy back. The nutty component is there in the flavor too. A bright citrus hop flavor cuts through the malty sweetness to enliven the flavor. The rye leaves a definite after taste of walnuts and a slight bitterness. Not unpleasant, just there. The mouth feel is very smooth. I came to enjoy rye beers through some of the rye IPAs out there. I think the hoppier beers accent the rye better than the extra malt in this beer.","carln26","Feb 28, 2005"
3.93,-2.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Generally, I love the attempt by the brewer to make and market this beer. It's a good beer with interesting and complex flavors that's certainly worth having on hand for people to explore what's great about craft brews.","longarm","Feb 26, 2005"
3.76,-6.7,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"You know, I could probably have a few more of these. I just see it as more of a dessert type beer. It has the potential, but I would not choose this particular brew for an extended excursion. Definitely a treat to keep on hand though.","SupaCelt","Feb 22, 2005"
3.7,-8.2,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a light tan, two finger head, fades slowly and leaves a ton of lace. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Color is deep red almost black. Nose is coffee. Starts and finishes with a burnt coffee flavor, the hops are always there with a slight hoppy after taste. Good winter beer. $1.80 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, MA.","jdhilt","Feb 07, 2005"
3.82,-5.2,4,4.5,3.5,3,4,"pours a nearly opaque black, somewhat thinner than expected. The head is a dirty brown that has a nice lacing on the sides of my glass. The dry hopping of this one is evident. This beer smells of burnt malts and hops, charcoal and pine, quite different. The taste on this one is quite piney upfront. A blast of coffee and chocolate come from the dark grains. The rye is also evident in this one. The mouthfeel is kind of thin, but I wouldnt expect anything else from a rye beer. I could probably drink quite a few of these, but probably wouldnt. This beer is reminiscent of a dry hopped porter with a lighter body. A different beer that I am glad I tried, another good one from Founders.","bnuttz","Feb 04, 2005"

4.33,7.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"An outstanding winter drinker to have on hand. It pours a dark ruby (black) with a dark tan head. Lace is web-like, not tight but holds true to the glass. The aroma is malty with hints of cold coffee. The taste is dark toasted malt with solid hints of rye. You also get flavors of coffee, bakers chocolate, biscuit & pumpernickle bread. A nicely balanced shot of hop rounds things out. The mouth is left slightly dry with a lingering toasted feel. A good steady beer that does not change much as it warms. Easy on the mouth for a dark brew, and easy to have another.","chilidog","Jan 28, 2005"

A burnt malt body, black licorice and dark coffee beans are rather tasty and blend in well to the value of this medium bodied beverage. As it warms, it gets better, a sweetening malt dominated body with some rye and cereal tasting. The warming also brings out some nice earthy hops, which are not noted until the last few ounces are left, dont matter, this is a winner, an incredible winter seasonal, a rye stout?","GeoffRizzo","Jan 21, 2005"

3.5,-13.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a nice deep, dark brown with a thick, pillowy light tan head. Dark malt aromas, along with a healthy dose of rye in the nose. Some hoppiness noticable. Roasted malt flavors dominate, but once again the rye component is very noticable. Hops add a nice bitterness and spiciness to the palate and finish. Flavorful mouthfeel, but surprisingly light, thanks to the adequate carbonation and the hops. A very nice beer. Drinkable, but not a session beer for me. The combination of rye, hops, and dark malts makes this one worth trying.","winomark","Dec 20, 2004"

3.96,-1.7,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Black body that is barely cola-colored at the thinnest parts around the glass. Frothy tan head that hangs in there for a very long time. Citrus hop nose with roasty notes and sweet malt underpinnings. Beautifully crafter beer. Great roasted malt flavors, bittersweet chocolate, and a little sweetness brings up the rear. Moderate yet fine hop bitterness which keeps everything very clean. It kind of reminds me of Storm King (because of the bitterness) but without the fruitiness of the hops and depth of malt. OK, its not Storm King, but I would call this an imperial stout because Im not getting much rye besides from suggestion. Yeah, I guess a little as it warms. Very good mouth feel from creamy carbonation and medium body. Im impressed more and more by these guys. I would definitely buy this if it were available in Jersey.","yen157","Dec 12, 2004"

Comparable to the quality of the other Underdog, Bear Republic. Just another wonderful brew from a world-class brewery. Another exceptional brew from Michigan. Highly recommended!","Mitchster","Dec 01, 2004"
4.02,-0.2,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Has a very nice flavor profile, and I wouldnt mind having a few. Think passing current convention and mellowing out the hops could improve it upon. Still, it is a very nice beer. If I could find it in MD, it would be sampled quite often. Id like to try it as a compliment to nice, fresh pumpernickel with spicy mustard, onions, and liverwurst.","Dithyramb","Nov 23, 2004"

4.03,0,4.5,4,4,4,4,"This is a beer not easily defined by labels. This tastes almost like a combination of Stout & Wit, even though I'm sure the spiciness comes from the rye. Founder's has come up with good beer. If you like stouts, porters, or wit beers, give it a shot.","frazbri","Oct 25, 2004"
3.48,-13.6,4.5,4,3,3.5,3.5,"Smells like rye and pumpernickel with a distant, muddled aroma of nutella and a sort of pale ale citric quality. A certain milky quality to it -- chocolatey, sweet, creamy up front. You can certainly get a feel for the rye in the dark, pumpernickel aroma and flavor. Slides into a bone dry hoppiness. Piney and citric, the finish dominates, and while it's cleansing, it's abrupt and disjointed. Like a darker, more chocolatey west coast pale ale. I feel like the beer itself is an original, but the concept is merely following the herd -- more hops, more hops, more hops. I appreciated the crispness of it all during the first bottle, but after that, it got a little grating.","marburg","Oct 17, 2004"
4,-0.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Dark reddish brown almost black color with decent creamy head that leaves lacing in my glass. Chocolate and pine aromas, chocolate, oatmeal and rye bread flavors. Medium bodied with a creamy, smooth mouthfeel, finishes clean. Very tasty and drinkable almost reminds me of an oatmeal stout.","maxpower","Oct 09, 2004"
4.32,7.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Anyways onto the beer. It pours a dark brown nearing black in color with crimson highlights when held to light. The head is a mocha tan color and a little small in size but it holds well. Lacing is minimal. The aroma is strong on the bready rye notes. It kind of reminds me of oatmeal. The taste to me is very similar to their Chocolate Rye Porter. Except this time the rye is more dominant and the chocolate is more subdued but those are the two main flavors. An earthy hop flavor lies in the background. I notice the hops but the thickness and roasted flavors in the body hold them back from coming foward. The finish has more of a grainy roasty astringency to it. Like most Founder's beer this isn't the smoothest but the flavors draw me in to continue to drink more. I really liked this beer and it improved the more I drank it. Definitely recommended.","granger10","Sep 16, 2004"
