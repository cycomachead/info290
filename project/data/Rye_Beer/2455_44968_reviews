"Its quick and bone dry finish is given a compelling creamy dryness that keeps the ale supported even in its fleeting moments. Hop bitterness seems exacerbated by the bite of rye grain, elevating both to utmost proportions. An aftertaste of dried citrus and peppercorn linger on."
""
""
"Clean clear copper color, the head is very thin and fizzy. Rye malt nose, rye malt flavor this a properly called a Rye Ale. The feel is incredibly thin, almost watery. Nothing particularly remarkable about it but it certainly presents itself as what it is...a Rye Ale."

"O: Love rye beers, and I love this one. Drank in Canton, June 21st, 2014. Great look and taste. Got this on sale at Ingles today."

"Poured from a bomber into a shaker pint, the beer is a slightly hazed, amber-highlighted copper coloring with a frothy, foamy, off-white head and a ton of carbonation action throughout the body. Aromas of hops first and foremost, with a resinous blast, moss and pine, and some subtle tropical fruit, all on a roasted and slightly bitter, grain backbone. Flavors are more of the bitter and pungent rye forward, with a bitterness around the edges from the hops, resinous notes, and citrus highlights. Smooth, light bodied, with a crisp endfeel. The aftertaste has a bit more of the citrus notes coming to the palate, with the bitter grains still providing a solid foundation. The finish has a grainy and citrus linger. Not bad overall, very balanced, and the light body keeps it refreshing."

"I've been on a rye love affair for the past few months, with both beer and whiskey, so maybe my review is overinflated, but if you enjoy rye and all that it brings, give this one a try... very affordable, too."

"A new brewery for me. Looks good off the pour. It’s kind of a mild rye. Nothing overly abrasive or way out there. Easy drinking and smooth enough. Nice level of spice from rye. Minimal hop abrasive tones. Like I said: easy drinkin’. This could be an every day ale. I wouldn’t mind some more punch out of it, but it’s pretty good as it is."

"Pours amber brown with red around the edges and a small soapy head. Aroma is heavy on the spice, with a dash of dish soap smell, sweet caramel and toffee, and a tinge of pine. Flavor very much highlights the rye, spicey black pepper, some pine bite, bit of dark dry fruit with serious dry finish. Has some qualities of a dubbel but without much sweetness. Light to medium mouthfeel that finishes dry. Very true to the rye here, and does not go all IPA on you like a lot of ""rye"" pales do. I respect that."

"Pours a dark copper body supporting just over an inch of bone white foam that recedes relatively quickly leaving some thin rings of lacing.Aroma consists predominantly of herbal spiciness,brown bread,dirt weed and mild pine.Flavor profile contains strong tea leaf hoppiness,dull citrus,blonde tobacco,aspirin and sourdough.Mouthfeel is light/medium with a rough,edged hop bitterness and an almost tinny malt finish.Lightly resinous.Overall,a mediocre hoppy rye beer in my opinion."

"O- Nothing too complex but it is effective in its execution. Drinkable, enjoyable and flavorful. Isn't that all that matters?"
""
""
""
"Nice ipa, not world class, but enjoyable."
""
""
"O: rye is present but not outlandish, balanced well with the hops but neither flavor is powerful"
""
""
""
"This is the gold standard of rye beers for me. Only Founders Red's Rye and the Lenny Bruce beer from He'Brew showcase rye as well as Rye Hopper does. Pair this with some great music at the French Broad tasting room and you have a perfect combo."

"o - solid rye beer with a lot of hop punch."

"Color is a dark shade of amber, nearly brown. Head is average, but a nice amount of lacing is left on the glass. The smell is herbal, floral, and malty, and pleasing to the nose. The taste is malt-forward - nutty and bready - with rye also playing a big role, adding spiciness and a tingle on the tongue. Hop flavors are in the background, and are mainly floral. I think it would benefit from more citrus hop flavors to provide better balance. It's a decent rye, but not a memorable one."
"O - An average rye beer."
""
""
""
" O - a very enjoyable ale. Balanced and flavorful. Great for a cool evening."

"Light texture in the mouthfeel and relatively drinkable overall. Not a show-stopper, but a decent offerning."
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel was thinner than expected with a medium to thin body. Modest, but adequate carbonation."
"This is a decent beer, but should be consumed with a meal."
""
""
"Overall the rye hopper was a beer very different from what I'm used to and pleasantly surprising. The bitter sweet flavor was a winner for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied with a nice bitter hop presence up front that is countered by a sweet, slightly roasted malt backbone. Hints of caramel, rye, toast and dark fruit. Slight creamy texture with a dry finish. Hoppier and more complex than expected. Well balanced and easyto drink. A pleasant surprise from a brewery that I was unfamiliar with."

"O: A well balanced beer with a good combination of bready malt, rye and bitter hops. I just wish the rye were a little stronger as I am a fan of the style."
"D: A good bomber to share; plenty of flavor but not extreme."
"O: Not something I'd really look to have again. Not my kind of beer."
"Couldnt find a date to confirm, but wouldnt seek this out again at this point."
"Arrived a dark amber with little head. Smells of roasted malts and peppery rye. Taste is predominantly rye, but with a nice malt balance. The rye sits on the tongue and offers a good bite, but isn't overpowering. Reminds me of a good pastrami sandwich. Medium bodied and well carbonated. I don't think I could have too many of these at once, but this one was good."
"overall a really soli rye beer. a bit hoppier then most"
"D - Definitely a very nice beer that walks the fine line between American Pale Ale and Rye Beer... Not the best in either category, but very nice offering none the less... More hops than rye, which as a rye beer lover is a bit of a let down... A great value at sub $5 per bomber..."
"O- This beer has a nice malt flavor with some good soft rye spice to compliment the hops, but the only real hops flavor is a strong pungent bitterness and not a lot of hop flavor and aroma."
"Finish: Funk on the finish with a hint of bitter and the rye sticks on the end"
"Overall a very tasty Rye Beer."
"I got this in a recent trade but I cannot remember who sent it to me, thank you whoever you are! Dark amber color but not brown and yet not orange. Smells pretty nondescript, I was expecting hops given the label. The label also led me to believe I would taste rye in this beer but I got almost none of it. I did get a bit of oxidation though. Overall this was quite an average beer, not bad but not special at all."
"Pours a clear brown with some nice soapy bubbles on the surface. The aroma is a nice mix of the rye, some floral hops, some lemon and some spiciness. Taste is mostly rye with a nice touch of floral hops. Bready with some light spiciness as well. The mouthfeel is pretty light and thin, almost a dry finish with the rye coming back in the finish pretty strong. I'm not a big fan of rye beers, but this one is very drinkable."
"OVERALL: This is a unique beer. It isn't something I would go for all the time, but when I was in the mood for something a little different the Rye Hopper would do the trick."
"A good beer but probably not something I'd choose again."
"Did I mention that I love this beer?"
"O: A solid beer, would have liked a little more rye spice in the flavor profile, but I liked it. A nice first beer for me from French Broad."
"Pours a clear darker amber with half inch creamy white head that slowly settles to a thin ring and leaves a few splotches of lace. Smell: spicy and slightly sour rye, a little citrus rind, bready. Taste: spicy rye, grapefruit, toasty with a little toffee sweetness. Medium bodied with soft, creamy carbonation. Nice easy drinking offering."
"A good thirst quencher, crisp and sharp."
"D - quite drinkable. Tasty. Good things."
"D-OK but nothing too special"
"Pours a slightly murky orangish red. A good amount of white head that hangs around. Smells great. Hoppy and rye heavy. Very similar to Nugget Nectar in the hop profile. Similar to Red's Rye in a lot of ways. Tastes sweet and a bit bitter with the hop presence. Thick solid moouthfeel. Very tasty overall. a bit thin but would definitely drink it again!"
"M/D: Smooth, medium carbonation. Packing a ton of flavor at only 5.9%, this beer has nothing to hide. Excellently crafted, almost sessionable too."
"Overall impression: Fans of rye should definitely seek this one out."
"Pours a clear reddish amber that is almost mahogany. Malty aroma has a rye overtone and hoppy and yeasty hints. Strongly hoppy flavor has a firm rye tone and only a little bitterness. Texture is rough, fizzy and ragged. This one is a joy to drink if you like a firm, sassy, earthy beer."
"D: This beer is very drinkable because there is a good balance between the flavors from the malts and hops."
"As a rye fan, the heaping hops seem to crowd the stage. Nonetheless, Rye Hopper is a delicious rye beer which pours some extra spice into the otherwise hidden malt base."
"Mild body has a very crisp opening, dry finish ( and middle for what its worth ), and mild lingering potential in the cracks and crevices of my mouth. Drinks easy, and I'm glad to have tried this. Probably wouldn't suggest this as the be all end all rye beer, though."
"French Broad has a good thing going on with this one; rye is showcased without going overboard. At 5.9% abv, not only is it tasty, is goes easy on the palate. Recommended."
"Like many of the Asheville beers I've had, it is more timid than it need be. Still, I would happily put another down on a warm summer day on the beach!"
"This is my first beer from French Broad Brewing Company, and I'm damn impressed. Rye Hopper has a ton of flavor crammed into a small package. The only small complaint I have is that the carbonation might be a tad high. It's not so noticeable since the bubbles feel small, but the head is annoying. Yes, I'm nitpicking it, I know. Excellent beer that's well worth seeking out. Thanks a ton, Dan!"
"D - Moderate drinkability. This beer's rye-ness is probably good to style, but not good for sessioning. A bit abusive to the tongue, could be more balanced. Higher carbonation can be filling."
"Lots of hops with a nice rye, I find this highly quaffable"
"D: A pleasant, drinkable beer."
" Body is light but substantial enough to carry the flavor. Nicely drinkable. I'm impressed with this offering - not a knockout by any means, but a solid, quaffable ale that takes advantage of the rye quality. I should seek out more rye beers - this is interesting."
"D: I had a hard time finishing this one. I'm still learning what I like and may have to revisit this one day when my experience grows."
"Good crisp clean mouth. Fair carbonation. Refreshing finish. The rye really makes itself known in the flavor. Grainy start but gives way to slight souring notes, and a dry finish. I've wanted to try this one for awhile, and finally pulled the trigger. I'm not sure it's one I would make a regular buy, but I'm glad I tried it."
"D: Pretty high drinkability, although as this warms that bitter hops become a little too pronounced for me."
"Wow, this one exceeded expectations, right up there with the fantastic Red's Rye from Founders. The best French Broad brew I've had to date."
"This is my first french broad and pretty damn tasty. i think this does well as the 'medium' of the genre. would lend its self to an american session beer, though purists will whine due to the 5.9% ABV, too hard core you know."
"bomber from Bruisin' Ales, Asheville"
"This brew shocked the hell out of me... I loved it and will definitely be picking up more..."
"D: Pretty good."
"This is slightly more meaty than most. . I personally liked this beer. It was a nice surprise to see on Ingles beer shelf"
"D - This is a pretty good rye beer."
"At first whiff, this beer reminded me of the Middle Ages Wailing Wench, so being a hoppy beer with (my guess here) Ringwood yeast character and duacetyl. After the initial punch of butterscotch candy, there's richly earthy rye layered with biting grapefruit and citrus rind hops. The body is crisp and drinkable and overall this is a fine (and interesting) rye beer. Certainly worth a try."
"Smells a bit like tomatoes, which, mind you, I tend to find in Rye ales. But this one was less an accent and more pronounced, which I didn't much like. The flavors are particularly grassy and somewhat cooked, which makes me wonder about the condition of the bottle (mind you, it was in the cooler of a very, very popular beer store). The texture itself was a bit washed out and the cooked nature of the finish certainly had ill-effects on the drinkability."
"This is still a good beer if you can try to get over that aftertaste, but I'd recommend it from the tap."
"D - this is a solid rye beer. It had a nice balance between not only between its malt and hops, but between the profiles withing the malts and hops - sweet and rye malts, citrus and grassy hops. I really enjoyed this one - I wish I would have bought more than one bomber of this."
"Clear coppery brown in color. Aroma carries butterscotch and caramel. Smells like a candy store, seriously. Upon tasting, the spiciness of the rye and floral hops make their immediate presence felt. A mellow bready & brown sugar taste follow, ushering the sweetness of the aroma back into the finish. A very unexpected and delicious beer."
"D- This was a very drinkable beer. Rye beers are getting to be my favorite style overall and it's because of easy drinkers like these. I personally liked this beer and could have finished a 22oz bottle of this by myself no problem."
"Mouthfeel is rather average being neither offensive or spectacular. Weight is about what one would expect from something in the 5%-ish range, and carbonation is just enough to give your mouth a very gentle tickle. Certainly not my style, but a decent beer nevertheless. I would imagine the IPA crowd would like this one."
"D - Overall, a very good rye beer. Well integrated mix of flavors combining into a complex group of flavors to keep things interesting and balanced. Alcohol level is pretty low at 5.9%. Very good afternoon drinker."
"HV"
"The flavor is comes with a big bready malt flavor that has an awesome grainy edge to it, like wheat and multigrain bread. The hops come in balanced and humbly to add a sweet edge towards the end of the profile. Overall this is great rye malt that could stand for a bit more hops, but perhaps the Terrapin version has me confused because this too is a great Rye beer that offers a good full mouth feel and a beer that's well crafted and traditional."
"D= good rye beer. Think I may get a keg for our next party as the amber option. Good hoppy freshness increases the drinkablility."
"Drinkability- If your idea of an excellant beer is rye and hops, look no further. A little extra surprise in flavor as well. Love the low ABV."
"I have been very impressed with French Broads offerings, well crafted, flavorful, and always interesting. keep up the good work"
"Great drinkability. Big on the rye malt, but a nice hop kick to please just about any beer drinker. This would make a nice session beer."
"D-A solid, easy to drink and pleasing palate stimulator. Full of rye dryness, spicy zip and citrus zing. Well done and flavourful. Certainly a beer I could drink with regularity."
"D - Rye Hopper is a really flavorful and drinkable rye beer, and is quite dry and spicy with more of a hop presence than I was expecting. My first experience with French Broad and I was not disappointed."
"From the widely lauded cellars of O'Hoove this brew has a dark copper color, pretty clear with a reasonable off-white head and excellent lacing. The aroma is almost a medicinal buttery rye, herbal hop with some malt balance. The flavor brings bright grassy rye with a herbal malt base. I get some raspberry fruit sweetness but it's subtle. Good drinkability with mid-bodied feel but tangy and crisp. A nice brew with a somewhat dry finish and unique character. A nice introduction to French Broad if you like the sharp edge of this hop brew."
"D: A good bomber to share. I wouldn't be upset if another one showed up at my door."
"Pours from the bomber to a hazy copper-orange with thin off-white head that lingers well and leaves okay lacing. Aroma is mostly hoppy citrus and floral, with a hint of malty caramel. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, slightly tingly and just a shade bitter. Taste picks up the fruits of the nose and throws in a little toffee sweet malt. Finish is a fairly long, well rounded blend of the hops and malts. A nice from a new (for me) brewer."
"Would make this a go-to rye ale over Terrapin if I could get my hands on it often. Impressive."
"Excellent beer, go on, get it..."
"Fresh bottle from Bruisin' Ales. Pours medium yellow, with initial foamy head that settles into lots of lace. Fresh hoppy malty aroma that includes some rye bread. Taste is, with middling mouthfeel, a fairly bitter high IBU ale that is blended with the rye for flavour. Drying finish. Very drinkable."
"smells malty with some very faint piney hops notes. I found this to be rather bold in the flavor profile. mlaty with some caramel, hops are medium but the Rye, oh the Rye doth give this one an edge! Finishes with a bit of a medicinal bitterness. the Rye really makes it a bit more aggressive on the palate."
"Pours a nice hazy golden orange color, nice carbonation, nice little one-finger creamy off-white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some nice hop notes, sweet/bitter, with some nice caramel notes. The taste is slightly sweet, bitter, malty, hoppy, nice touch of rye, and caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, really enjoying this one."
"D - Very easy to drink."
"D - Yummy hoppy brew with a fruity left hook. A fantastic potential favorite for this hop-head."
"D - If you like bitter hops and a foam mustache (and I do), this one's for you."
"Nice. Solid blend of hops character, spicy rye, and sweeter malts here, wrapped up in a sleek and drinkable body. I didn't quite expect to like this one nearly as much as I did. A winner from French Broad."
"Letting this one breathe a bit really brings out the flavors of this beer. If you like hops and you like what rye can do for beer, this is one you won't want to miss."
"An easy drinking and enjoyable rye beer from the folks at French Broad."
"Drinkability: I have had me some hop bombs, I've had me some malt bombs, but this is my first real rye bomb. It's a different taste, albeit a good one. It's a unique flavor that I can see myself drinking again, though probably not more than one in an evening."
"As much as I like rye, I didn't love this one. Might pick up a bomber to compare, but won't seek this one out."
"This is really quite good. The rye flavor is very pronounced but there's enough hoppiness to complement and balance it out nicely. This is a must for any rye fan, and worth trying for all the rest of us, too."
"T:"
"drinkability: a bomber of a spicy rye is hard for any man"
"Pours a deep amber color, moving a bit to brown, slightly hazy with a huge head, kind of off-white/yellow colored. It looks a little loosely packed, but it stays around, leaving nice lacing. Though eventually, it sort of collapses to a pillowy mass and then sort of disappears slowly. The smell comes across with mostly powdery malts, and quite a bit of rye. Like rye bread, a little spicy, a little earthy. There also seems to be some spiciness and leafy-earthiness from the hops as well. Otherwise, their presence is mild in the smell. Something smells a little like cinnamon in here as well, a little spicier though. The taste comes across with a kick of herbs, like herb bread, with cloves, and a bit of mint, some basil, maybe a taste of garlic, actually there seems to be a little heat to it. Very interesting. Then there's a kind of toasty malt presence, with a bit of sweetness, liek caramellized sugars. I can also sense a bit of an estery presence, but it's barely there. There's quite a bit going on here - I'm not so sure I have anything to compare it to, but I'm really enjoying it. The body is nice and full, almost chewy from the proteins in the rye. Makes it almost hard to swallow. The alcohol warms a little, but isn't really noticeable. The carbonation hardly bites, but you can feel it there, helping to rush the beer down. Really enjoyable. It's a bit out of the ordinary - not because of some strange ingredient, but just because I haven't really tasted anything quite like it, and worth a shot if you can get it. I could see myself purchasing this again."
"Drinkability is good very enjoyable nice rye notes nice hops that blend with the fruitiness. Want to thank merlin48 for lending me this one."
"Pours a cloudy tea color with a nice foamy light tan head that fades fairly quickly leaving spotty patterns of Belgian lacing. The smell is an easily recognizable though timid peppery rye grain. Lightly carbonated, the mouth feel is medium bodied. Full flavored the peppery taste combine for a lively experience that finishes on the dry side. A really nice drinker and at less that 6% ABV its quite a session beer."
"Drinkability: Sipper by far, this beer has a lot hidden within. A stellar beer from a growing beer company. I highly recommend."
"The drink is surprisingly fullish-in body with a silky syrupiness nicely complemented by fine-grained carbonation. Plenty drinkable."
"Drinkability suffers from the bitterness. The beer also had a dry bitter aftertaste. Overall, it appears that I should give this beer another shot based on the other reviews."
"D - Easy to drink and could have a few more. I hope this isn't taken the wrong way. Nothing spectacular, but just a good all-around beer that I would love to have on hand! I will definitely pick more up next time in NC!!"
"an above average beer."
"D: Very very drinkable, the bomber's gone in 15 minutes"
"I'm very partial to a well done rye ale and this one hits the mark on all accounts. It's a bit too filling to want more than one at a single sitting, but this is my favorite French Broad product to date. Well done!"
"Drinkability: ""What some rye? 'Course ya do."" Rye Hopper maintains a more than pleasant balance between the sweetish malts and the spicy rye and bitter hops. Pleasantly drinkable and good expression of rye in beer, though, I will admit, I'm a bit partial to Terrapin's Rye Squared."
"Lets go Red Wings !"
"highly recommended. good beer at a good price."
"Even though I've only had two of their offerings to date, I am supremely impressed with French Broad Brewing Company. Altbier was delicious and drinkable. Rye Hopper is even more so. If you love rye beer and hops as much as I do, then you owe it to yourself to acquire a bomber as soon as possible. It looks like North Carolina is rapidly becoming a hotbed of great craft beer. Thanks Rbald42."
"D: Label says 5.9% ABV, about what I would have guessed. Drinkable with plenty of flavor."
"This is an interesting brew. A nice change of pace from the all the IPAs I've been drinking lately."
"Better than anything else I've had from French Broad. I like it."
"This is the first French Broad (love the name) beer I have ever picked up. The Rye Hopper was poured into a standard pint glass, and it looked darker than I was expecting. The body was a deep shade of copper and clear, and the head atop was foamy. I did not see any carbonation streamers. The smell was sweet and fruity, which is odd for a beer named Rye Hopper. The taste was also sweet and mildly bitter. The bready taste was followed by a bit of spiciness. The body was soft, but this beer lacked the carbonation to make it feel creamy. Easy to drink for sure, but not the most memorable beer made with Rye."
"Pretty decent mouthfeel and drinkability. Nice beer."
"I had this on tap at the Brick Store Pub in Decatur GA. The beer was hazy dark copper color, thick rich looking off-white head, lots of wet lacing on the glass. Spicy rye and earthy hops in the aroma. The taste had a nice bite of rye and bitter hops, caramel malt througout but the spiciness sets the overall tone. Very good, as drinkable as any rye beer I've had to date."
"Note: I tried this side by side with the bottle version and the tap version is thicker with a cleaner hop flavor. Definitely try on-tap if possible."
"Another solid beer from French Broad. So nice to see these available in Atlanta now. Pours a slightly hazy dark amber with very little head and relatively low carbonation, but with some scant lacing left behind as the beer is drained. Smells of spicy rye, piney hops, and a touch of malt. Fairly well balanced in the nose. I wouldn't call the taste balanced, but it's delicious nonetheless. Starts with a bang, with a big blast of rye and piney hops intermingled to create a quite spicy, dry, bitter, prickly mouthfull. I like it, and the rye and the hops work well together. Bone dry with very little noticeable malt makes this almost tannic, and approaches rye whiskey in its flavor profile, without the burn. Big and spicy in the mouth, this one surprised me when I poured it after working in the yard expecting a lawnmower beer. That it is not. My only real complaint is that it's a bit one-dimensional, but this is one of the better beers out there for showcasing the beauty of rye, so I'll forgive it its singlemindedness. Nice, I'll be buying this again."
"Overall, very good and worth seeking out if you like rye's."
"22oz bottle into a Duvel snifter pours a crisp copper with a decent cream head. Aroma is a nice bit of rye with citrus hops right behind. The taste is a nice sharp rye bite balanced nicely with citrus hops. The beer is light and smooth with decent carbonation, very refreshing. This is certainly a great beer, one I'd love to see around this area as long as the price isn't jacked up by the distributor."
"Drinkability: A damn good beer, in my opinion, and one of the few rye beers I've truly enjoyed. I'd glad to have this one again, and would really like to try it on tap. Manages to strike all the right notes without going overboard, and the abv% seemed low enough to where a few of these wouldn't be a problem. Recommended."
"Overall it's a good beer that you should give a try if you have the chance."
"My expectations where met and I hope this was not a one off."
"D - Very smooth, balanced and drinkable. I really enjoyed this beer."
"Very nice flavor. Chocolate and rye greet the tongue immediately. Medium body and such a smooth and sweet drinkability. I really enjoyed this: so much so that I had the same beer in two different places. Well done!"
"M/D - Very dry like a good rye beer. Medium bodied and very crisp as well. Easy drinking but not the best rye beer I have had. Still not sure why they chose to highlight hops in the name."
"This is probably one of the best rye beers I've had."
"Mouthfeel- I found this to be rather bold in the flavor profile- mlaty with some caramel, hops are medium but the Rye, oh the Rye doth give this one an edge! me likey! Finishes with a bit of a medicinal bitterness. I'll agree with the previous review this one does not get crazy with the hops but the Rye really makes it a bit more aggressive on the palate. I could session this one but it feels like it might have an ABV of at least 6.5%. Good brew"
"This one is a brownish hue with amber and ruby shades. Minimal head and retention isn't the greatest. Smell is nice but not what I had expected from a beer with Hopper in the name. Bigger on the malts than anything. Some caramel, chocolate, and a distinct nutty scent. Very light to no hops present, though still very enticing. Taste is much of the same. Reminds me of the malt profile of many Catawba Valley brews. A definite malt presence. Oh so yummy chocolate and caramel malt. A good nutty flavor to compliment. A hoppy flavor shows up toward the finish but could have done wonders if used a bit more liberally. Of course, there is a light spicy flavor, though like the hops not as present as I had imagined. Still, very nice and interesting to say the least. Mouthfeel lacked the bitterness that again I had expected from the name alone. Smooth, good carbonation, though lacking a certain bitterness from the ""hopper"" in the name. I could have a couple, if not a few, pints of this. A good beer that just didn't live up to my hop head expectations. I still want to give it another go."
