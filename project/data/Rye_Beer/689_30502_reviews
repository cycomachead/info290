"Brew pours a pretty dark amber in color with a good 1-finger thick foamy off-white head. Lots of sheet lacing was seen when sipped that stuck to the sides of the glass. Lots going on with the aroma as there is some burnt brown sugar, spices and woodsey hops. More going on with the taste even with some roasted malts with a touch of caramel in the mix as well. Finishes slightly dry with a slight bitter finish but that only last a couple of seconds. Overall a decent brew. Medium-bodied with perfect carbonation."

"A truly great beer. Woodsy flavors, rye spice, creamy texture with tight carbonation and fluff for miles on the head.  Almost a smoky flavor, some sweetness.  Strong flavors, but all good flavors, a bit bitter but pleasant aftertaste.  Rich, complex, sturdy, massively excellent beer that just kicks ass."

"Dark brown in color with great clarity.  A fingernail of creamy beige colored head rests on top.  Brussels lacing.  Intriguing aroma of rye and cane sugar along with piney hops playing more of a background note.  The flavor is comprised of rye,cane sugar,and piney hops.  The mouth is moderately carbonated and has the sharp edge from the spicy rye."

"Overall impression is that this is a really fun beer with a lot of qualities that will keep you interested with every new sip. The balance is evident by the brew's ability to give you impressions of the nice base malts, the rye, as well as some really fun hop aromas and flavors. Would definitely buy this again."

"03/04/14 Just a taste...but I had to make note. This goes into the WWTT file (What Were They Thinking). I should start by confessing to not being a big hops fan, but the effrontery of the rye negates any nuances. I'm not big on slamming a beer but I'm leaving this 'message in a bottle' so I don't ever get caught up in the mystery of the name of this brew again. Might be rye-ght for some...but I'm not that guy."

"Final Thoughts: Really pleasantly surprised by this one. Picked it up for a buck, which was a very good deal. I'm typically not a rye beer fan but Two Brothers Brewing Co definitely knows how to work their malt bill to strike a great balance. Would I drink it again? Yes."

"This beer is pours a beautiful deep red/dark brownish color with a nice cream head that rises just over an inch in the glass. The smell is very nice, previews the hop taste that is to come with your first sip. A nice balance hop taste with a great malted barley taste. It's a complex flavored beer but not so bold that someone who doesn't get into the super bold beer styles shouldn't like it. Very well balanced and smooth drinking. Having mine with some popcorn lol and it goes awesome. A very good brew, my favorite two brothers brew so far."
"On-tap at Hollywood Stadium inside Hollywood Casino in Joliet, IL. This pours a dark amber color with a slight brown foamy head. Good aroma of toasted rye. Has a strong, bitter flavor and full of rye tones. Lots of bold, bitter flavors and very well made."

"12oz bottle. Aroma of rich grain, piney hops and sweet malt. Pours dark amber with a frothy white head. Flavors of spicy grain, resinous hops with a pronounced bitterness. Finishes dry and bitter. Not bad. Last beer of birthday night so impressed that I remembered it at all."

"This was really good. The rye and hop flavors balanced well and the mouthfeel was smooth and very drinkable, would get again for sure."
""

"Mahogany color with sharp rye flavors and hoppy characteristic. Nice overall balance, but not as impressed as I thought I would be though. The thai palm sugar is a good touch, though it doesn't put it over the top for me. Above average beer but not Two Brothers best."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 1/28/2014. Pours moderately hazy deep copper color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of mango, tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, orange zest, lemon zest, caramel, rye, toast, floral, grass, candi sugar, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop and malt notes; with good strength. Taste of mango, tangerine, pineapple, orange zest, lemon zest, caramel, rye, toast, candi sugar, floral, grass, light pine, and floral earthiness. Light earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of tangerine, mango, pineapple, orange/lemon zest, caramel, rye, toast, floral, grass, candi sugar, and light pine on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of malt and hop flavors; with a nice crisp hop/malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a slightly creamy, smooth, and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice hoppy rye ale. All around good balance and complexity of hop and malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
"Great beer. A bold and beer with strong flavors given its hop profile and rye, but very well balanced. Its sweetness could be tuned down a bit. If you like Rye beers and a hoppy punch, you got to try this."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is sugary, some hops as well. Taste is good and unique. Some hops, rye, a bit of sweetness, palm sugar adds a different flavor, slight bitterness, well done. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer."

"Overall- Decent, but nothing too fancy. I'd probably pick it up again at some point if I saw it, but I'm not in any hurry."
""
"Overall it's understandable why this is one their staples. Rye can be somewhat harsh sometimes but this is really well done."
"Cane and Ebel stands tall as an excellent showcase of the style. It's not my favorite rye, but it's up there. And it's certainly one of the easiest premium rye ales to obtain in the Midwest."

"The Cane and Ebel was a great beer. The color was very dark, similar to a stout. The aroma was subtle yet inviting. The head was not very frothy either. The flavor was awesome. I never had a rye beer before but it was interesting. There was no horrible after taste and was not too thick. Definitely give ryes a try."

"Excellent beer, for sure. I said it three or four times already, but this screams ""Style: Red IPA"" until the beer is basically down your throat. I tend to find that rye beers that are really heavy on the rye almost present a vomit sort of flavor (appealing, right?), so I welcome the burst of hops that I get from this beer. I'd VERY happily revisit this beer."

"O-complex flavors in this rye ale, enjoyable to savor"

"Overall - an. Excellent and tasty rye ale, very nice representation of the style, highly recommend."

"As a big fan of Rye beers, I was very excited to receive this bottle as a gift. It pours a translucent, carbonated, deep ruddy hue, with a thick layer of foam blanketing the top. Excellent retention and lacing. It's got a very sweet, yet earthy aroma, likely due to the Palm Sugar. I actually am imagining raw sugar cane having a similar scent. Bready grains were noted along with a touch of Lemon Balm or Hyssop. The flavor was quite hoppy with toasted rye bread and a backing from the malts. It finishes very dry. Overall, this felt a little light across the palate but was still very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I was expecting a hoppy rye ale but definitely not THAT hoppy. Floral and grapefruit hops but more of an english pale ale level of hops and bitterness. Well balanced, smooth and very drinkable rye beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- This is great, was not expecting the amount of flavor and aroma it packs. If you like rye and hops this is one to try for sure."

"Single finger head with excellent lacing on a clear amber with golden hues body. Aroma of toasted and caramel malt, rye breads, candied orange and earthy hops. Flavor is nicely breadt with nice rye presence, earthy hops, citrus hops and a nutty and musty sensation which carries throughout the experience. Medium body and moderate carbonation. This one is very complex and very smooth. There is a lot more to this one than I can pull out from it. A must try."
""
""
""
"Overall, a very solid, very drinkable hoppy rye brew, definitely a rye/ipa blend."
""
"A definite standout in the catagory."
""
"Bottom Line: Quality brew!"
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Poured a darker amber color with a small, stable, off-white head. Aroma of citrusy hops and toasted rye malts, nicely balanced. Same in the taste, toastyed rye, caramel, citrus, crisp hop bitterness. Clean, dry, medium body, moderate carbonation, easily drinkable."
""
""
"This is an interesting beer. The sweetness is cloying, masking the rye too much for my tastes. However, this is still enjoyable in an odd way. A little too sweet, but there is a decent hoppyness to help try and balance it out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Spicy, dry, bitter, tropical and citrusy. Yeah, I'd buy it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I will have to go back and look but this may be the best rye beer I have ever had. Sweet rye flavors makes it drinkable like an amber. I wish I always had access to this"
"O-It's no Red's Rye PA, but still one the better hoppy Rye-Reds out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- I am very happy with the way earthy rye and bitter hops dance in this ale. This unique ale really works!"
""
""
"Overall: I’m a big fan of Two Brothers, partly because I like supporting small, independent businesses, but mostly because they make very drinkable beer and Cane and Ebel is another example of that…with super flavor and a relatively low ABV, I definitely could drink a few of these in a sitting and not bat an eye…this is definitely worth picking up if you see it on your local, independent beer store or if you’re traveling through the Chicagoland area…Two Brothers strikes again! (4/5)"
""
""
""
""
"O: This. This is what a great beer should be. You could search the entire world for a better Rye Beer and come up completely empty handed and dumb founded. Well done!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I enjoy this beer. The Thai palm sugar adds an interesting sweetness and flavor to the beer. Neither does the rye or hops dominate over each others."
""
"O- High drinkability and a nice combo of rye and hops. I used light as an adjective frequently in this brew because it displays a good amount of finesse."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I killed a six pack of this over the span of three days along with all the other goodies I had in between. I'll be revisiting this brew when I'm in the area quite often now I'm sure."
"Overall - This is the first rye beer I've ever tried. I am not pleased.. lol. To me, this basically just tastes like a nasty IPA, with rye added."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a snifter. Off-white head, moderate retention on a dark amber body. Lacing is soapy and clear, sticky. Aroma includes some caramel malt, but is certainly dominated by quite a hop bill. Resinous hop juiciness in the form of grapefruit and grass, some earthiness. Taste is biting and bitter balanced by some nice malt sweetness. Tongue coating with a warming mouthfeel. Very tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
"Complex, (rye) malty, hoppy. Everything you could ever want from one bier."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- this is yet another brewery you can't really go wrong with... their more driven towards taste over ABV. track them down and enjoy like a victorious Viking lol"
""
"O: Far exceeding my expectations. First brew from Two Brothers. This suits my classification for a higher gravity, well-hopped red ale. Clean flavors and alcohol kept in check."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer goes down fast for a 7% abv. It hits the spot on a cold rainy evening. Two Brothers use of rye is the best I have had as they did not over do it while creating a unique and tasty brew. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
"All in all, very very tasty. I just wish it wasn't so expensive and hard to find!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Since the beer is well past its expiration date, I can imagine that the hop presence must be more pronounced in a fresher example. As it stands, though, this expired sample was fine drinking anyway."
""
"Overall, something I am absolutely looking forward to getting more of. I have not had all that much from 2 Bros yet, but have really liked what I've tasted so far."
""
""
""
"O- Outstanding. World class. One of the best beers one could find anywhere... in my humble opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured 7ozs into my duvel tulip. The beer pours a clear mahogany brown with no head (unless vigorously shaken). The nose is candy sweet malt with almost no hops or spice. The taste is intensely sweet with a subtle pine hoppiness and slight rye spice. This is not the beer I expected. The mouthfeel is sweet with a slight bite from the hops/rye. It's smooth and drinkable, but really nothing special. Overall I think this beer is worth sampling at a brewfest, but not a top 10 rye..."
"Overall: If you like rye beers this is one to look for in the great lakes beer region. Its good beer from chicago!"
""
"The color is gorgeous like a copper beauty shiny from a healthy application of massage oil. The malt and sweetness flirt hard with the spice of the rye and bitterness of the hops. It’s no surprise these two hook up for an orgy of deliciousness that results in a simultaneous orgasm that leaves you gasping for air and dreaming of your next sip."
""
""
""
""
"O - Easily my favorite rye to date. If you are looking to pack some kick with comfort food, this is a great option. I would make an effort to get this again. Thankfully its readily available."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drink- A good beer. Should've brought a 6 pk home but didn't have the room for 6 more beers. Want more."

""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"The beer pours a reddish color with an off-white head. The aroma is full of rye and pine, two qualities that I think go quite well together. The flavor is more of the same, with a lot of rye and pine and not too much else. Low to medium bitterness, with a medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Fairly straightforward, but also very good."
""
"O: A beer that I WILL buy I again; I’m promising myself that. Today, even. Yes, it is quite sweet, and sweet is one of my least favorite qualities in a pale ale – Cane and Ebel, though, has the biggest rye bite I’ve tasted since Bear Republic’s Hop Rod Rye. And that, my friends, is something to admire."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M: While creamy, the body is just a hair thinner that I'd like to feel at this ABV. Texture is fine grained and sticks to the tongue well. Carbonation is high enough to carry the flavors into the palate, but low enough not to get in the way."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very citrus forward beer, with enough rye to reign in the flavor and keep the profile in check."

"O: My favorite rye beer and a prime example of the style. It has a nice dose of hops, which I like, and a nice dose of rye, which I also like. The mouthfeel is great, as well. Glad to have this beer super-local."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: If you want hops with no balance, here is your beer. I like hops, but I cannot find one bit of sweetness or redeeming taste to allow anything but hops to be tasted in this beer."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""

"O - I really like the mouthfeel of this beer. The taste kind of reminds me of an Irish ale. Overall, it's a solid beer."
""

" Super smooth, I could drink a lot of these but at 7% that may not be wise. I really like this beer, one of the best coming from Two Brother. This brewery is awesome and I am glad that they are local to me!"

""
""
""
""
"o: i really enjoy this rye beer, i just wish it was a little less sugary."
""
""
""
"O:If the body had more carbonation I would have really enjoyed this, but it really knocked it down a couple pegs. I will revisit in the future and hopefully it was just my bottle. The flavors were nice though and it was probably the best tasting offering from Two Brothers."
"Overall one of the best two brothers beers. A very good rye beer in general."
""
"To be sure, there was alcohol too but it never felt too strong. This is a Rye Beer and a great example of that, as there was just a hint of spice to offset the sweetness. I loved this beer and even though it's not for everyone, Two Brothers has a winner here. I'd certainly buy this again!"
"Also starting to have questions about Two Brothers…"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - this is the best rye beer I have had to date. Really nice flavor profile to and pretty damn attractive in the glass. Glad to see this in six packs now with about the same price point it used to be. I'll be buying more of this in the future."

"2.5 D: I think this would have worked better if they used less bittering hops. In any case, it's at least interesting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a very solid brew overall. It doesn't necessarily kill it in any one aspect, but makes for a great overall package. I would certainly drink this agian."
""
""
""
""
"I could drink several of these in a sitting. Overall very well balanced, and the ABV seems to be hidden fairly well."
"Dr: Pretty drinkable, but it costs a lot. It isn't as unique as it should be. Hides its ABV well. For a rye beer, it's not bad."
"Pours a a murky, brownish-amber color with a small off-white head that disappears quickly. Scent is very sweet with some lovely hop aromas. Sweet caramel malt as well. Somewhat piney. Maple syrup? Taste is immediately caramel malt with some delicious rye flavors. Great hops balanced with rye and sweet malt. A bit of honey and citrus. A lot of pine. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied, well carbonated, with a somewhat sticky finish. Drinkability is high. Overall, I really wish there were more rye beers. This is a great one."

"O- Good rye beer with nice hoppiness. One of my favorites from Two Brothers."
"Hoppy bitterness begins the palate's journey with pine up front with a good solid bready backbone. A well balanced and very solid take on a Rye P.A. I can drink this everyday and not get tired of it."
"Medium body, higher carbonation, sticky and prickly on the tongue. Drinkable, hoppy, spicy, and delicious. I'd buy this regularly if it was available here."
"O- a rye beer that is at once spicy, hoppy, and malty. Really a great offering, my first from two bros, won't be my last."
"O: A really solid drinker. There is a great balance with the malty sweetness and the spicy rye. Each flavor is spot on. I like it. If it were available near me, I'd buy some bottles every now and again."
"D/O: This intensely savory beer drowns out the advertised hopped-up qualities, borrowing just enough citrus to allow a nod in the direction of balance. It combines a solid malt-dominated front end with fairly strong pure bitterness at the end. While as drinkable as most IPAs, it seems a bit less composed that some other offerings from Two Brothers, such as Domaine du Paige or Resistance."
"An extremely tasty beer, full of complexity and style. If they could lower the ABV a point to avoid the detectable ethanol, this would improve the beer. I believe this would be even more spectacular when fresh."
"Pours a deep ruby with an off-white rocky foam head, some of which clings to the glass on its way down. Rye malts are prevalent in the nose, though the hops take a close second. The same goes for the taste, too; the rye pairs perfectly with how bitter this brew is. Dry finish, and the mouthfeel is a bit lighter than I would expect. Overall this is an exceptional beer from Two Bros, a brewery that's soon becoming one of my local favorites."
"O: I really wish I would have opened this sooner to realize the full effect of the hops. Regardless, this is a very well crafted beer that I will most certainly seek out again."
"Poured a brilliant orange/amber color, with a smallish beige colored head. A little spicy on the nose, with a bit of caramel, some cereal and rye bread. On the palate, this one is sweet, crisp and medium bodied, with some caramel, rye, toasted malt and cereal. ™"
"This is a good rye beer. I'm not crazy about the palm sugar, but combined with the impressive rye profile and some assertive hoppiness, it's a unique beer."
"O: a great take on the style (rare as it is) great complexity, smooth and yet a bit angry, nice and thick on the palate"
"Nicely carbonated and crisp. Complex blend of rye and hops with a solid malt backbone, very slightly sweet. Tasty."
"Overall: A very good rye beer. Great flavor and a easy drinkability. Very highly recommended"
"Mouthfeel is light and clean. Overall, this is a nice, solid beer. I like it."
"D-Good brew, excellent for sessions, fairly decent balance of the hops/rye. Would recommend to anyone to have as a regular brew in their fridge."
"Cane & Ebel is a very dark brown, almost black, cola colored brew, which glows an amber read when held to the light. Topping it off is a good-sized, foamy, tan colored head. Sheets of lacing adorn the glass. The scent is pretty hoppy, with rye of course, with maybe just a touch of sourness. The taste is pretty big and bold; lots of grainy characteristics from the rye, a fair amount of bitterness from the hops, though it is well-blended, some spice from the alcohol, fair amount of citrus and grapefruit tones, pretty sweet. Medium bodied and sharp on the tongue."
"O - A very nice rye beer, and would go well just about any time of year. The taste and beer itself is nice and coating, with that piney hop making this interesting and wanting to come back for more. One of my favorite offerings from Two Brothers."
"Morey's Bottom Line: I like this beer alot. Not quite as hoppy as Founders Red's Rye or Bear Republic Hop Rod Rye, but just as good. A fun beer to sip on and talk about."
"Overall - I'm not a fan of rye beers, but there's some characteristics that bring it down besides the rye. Still drinkable, but not great."
"A solid beer from a solid brewery. I like rye, but if you don't then this probably isn't for you as it's one of the more rye forward beers I've tried."
"O: Two Brother's Cane & Ebel Rye comes off like an East Coast AIPA / Brown Ale hybrid. The rye is certainly the star of the show, and is presented in a winning and approachable way from top to bottom. Effortlessly and deceptively well put together. Job well done, Brothers."
"O-Hands down the best beer I've had in the last year."
"Overall a decent beer and a definitely recommendation!"
"Overall - This is really smooth and unique. Easy to drink after you get used to the flavor. The mix of rye and hops sets this apart from other rye beers. Very tasty, would recommend to try this one."
"Color is a murky brown with a thin head of white creamy lace. Aroma is sweet, creamy caramel, hops, and vanilla and a touch of spicy Rye. Pine hop and sweet flavors are well balanced. Noticeable spicy/tangy rye presence. Zesty citrus and resiny hop finish with a lasting bitterness. Overall a spicy, hoppy and substantially flavored rye-based beer. Really good. I would like to find more Rye beers. All the ones I had, have impressed me."
"O: This is one of the better Rye Beers that I have ever tasted. If you enjoy any type of Rye, this is a beer for you."
"Overall, the taste sneaks up on you. Nice interplay of the earthy hop, spicy character of rye, the mellow malt/sugar cane and the alcohol. Very tasty."
"Mellow but strong in equal measure, Cane & Abel is a showcase of brewing skill, melding jaw breaking strength with a balanced profile that belies that strength and settles into a balanced easy drinker. Pours a light crystal clear brown with ample sticky lacing, this brew starts with a malty caramel aroma that buoys a significant eatery piny hop aroma. The first sip is surprising as the aggressive hop content does not attack the tastebuds with prickly abandon, instead choosing to lay in wait, allowing the smooth body to mellow into a melange of malt sugars then gradually creep back lending a long resiny aspect to the flavorful finish. Skirting the territory of the barley wine, Cane & Abel deftly avoids that moniker choosing instead a strong but flavorful profile that hides its muscles in a classy and complex veil of flavors. Very well done from this young brewery."
"OVERALL: This is one of the better beers in Chicago and it's wide availability in the area makes it one of my standards. Goose Island Honkers Ale used to be the flagship beer of Chicago. The Cane & Ebel has surpassed it and should be viewed as Chicago's go-to beer."
"O- One of the best rye beers I have encountered, something to look out for and pick up."
"Overall Impression- Awesome beer to have for my first brew from Two Brothers. Good amount of body, solid taste, but has a tough drinkability. Good beer to enjoy over a good amount of time or with a meal."
"Very tasty rye beer...not as hoppy as some others I’ve had but has more rich maltiness than those examples and there is nothing wrong with that. Would’ve liked a bit more punch to the aroma, but other than that it is a very good brew."
"good atmosphere. nice body, decent enough head, and tons o' lacing. nose and flavor both full, malty, and pungent. overall, this is a really good quaff."
"Overall, this is another great hoppy rye ale. A style I am definitely in love with. It's not quite on par with Founder's Red's Rye, but close. Good stuff."
"This brew has an awesome color to it. A deep reddish brown that has a hazy opaqe fog. Thick walls of lacing cling almost the whole glass. The nose is pine filled and very hoppy. It tastes fresh and hoppy. Pine dominates the taste buds and is then met with a malty backdrop. A crisp mouthfeel nails the palate with an intense bitterness and ample carbonation. Overall, great drink with a tasty hop presense."
"Draft to pint. Looked good for a rye; deep in color w/shades of red and brown. Smelled great; hoppy with the twang of the rye noticeable. Taste was hoppy and tangy, just like it should be. Mouthfeel was good. The tanginess made it drink like a wild ale, but without all the carbonation. Overall, a quality brew that's great on draft."
"Balanced and tasty beer that really seems to bring home the idea of ""beer is food."" Delicious and inviting. I would drink this regularly if I could get it. Highly recommended."
"This beer poured out as a red color with a tan colored head. The head fades not leaving much lacing. The smell of the beer is a little hoppy, a little sweet and has some spice. The taste had some sugary sweetness, nothing overwhelming. Theres also some spicy rye and hop bitterness in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium bodies and has a good carbonation. Overall this is a pretty good beer but I didn't think it was worthy of an A. Just my opinion though."
"Overall: This beer has a beautiful body and lacing. Aroma is nice, but mouthfeel, unfortunately was a bit disappointing. It's not a bad beer per se. Just not one I'd order twice, when there are so many other options now."
"O/D- Dangerously easy to put down. Remains one of my favorites for any occasion. Too bad duff27 isn't here to partake."
"The 7% ABV warms a bit, and this is certainly bold, but I really like the rye in here and the complex flavors."
"a nice deep pour of red ruby brown with a sticky but small head. complex with a great balance of dense caramel, fruit and notes of vanilla. Nose of pine and blood orange and hints of grapefruit. This is aromatic only though. The palate is more apple with a floral zest hint and a great feel."
"O. An interesting and enjoyable find, glad the beer guy at my local store suggested it. The flavors do not overwhelm, they are just an enjoyable show that this beer puts on for your tongue."
"Overall very drinkable but something about the rye makes it more bitter than sweet which I like in my IPA's. I did like it though and believe this is a very well made beer I guess rye just doesn't wow me. I do have a couple more beers by these guys so here's hoping I like them more."
"O-this is a fantastic beer, very complex, excellent combo of hoppiness and rye, this is definitely one of my new favorites"
"D -- Solid, worth a try -- very nice brew for any IPA drinker."
"Herbal hop bitterness up front. A touch of singed, almost smoky malts follow, before caramel and fruit (ripe pear) sweetness take over. Any sweetness is handily checked by lasting herbal and pine bitterness. There's also a spicy edge to everything, making for a deliciously complex taste. Dry finish, with lingering citrus hop bitterness and traces of spicy caramel. Medium-full body with a delectably creamy feel. Great beer!"
"O: This is a truly fine beer. At 7%, too strong for a session, but I want to have one after another nonetheless. Worth seeking out."
"Overall This beer is great. Huge hop flavors without any off flavors. The only thing that makes this a rye beer and not a top notch ipa is its color. As a bonus you could drink this all day it seems. Job well done two brothers"
"I've looked at this beer on the shelves for years and never got one. Why? This is a great, great brew. I'm a huge fan of several beers I've had lately with the addition of rye. Hopefully this catches on and more brewers experiment with it."
"O- loved this version of a hopped up rye beer..its tasty,creamy and hoppy..very enjoyable ..will be drinking this again and again"
"We got destroyed at Quizzo tonight, so hopefully this is enough to make me feel a bit better. It pours a clear ruby topped by a finger of glowing dirty white foam and exhibiting a decent amount of matter floating about within. The nose comprises orange peel, onion, toasted rye bread, black pepper, and dark toffee. The taste holds notes of soil, orange rind, light mandarin orange, potato skin, grass, and a touch of toffee. I winced a bit whilst drinking this. The body is a barely-light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, I was not much of a fan of this at all, really. The flavors don't do anything all that great for me, and the smell comes kinda close to offensive. I can see how this could actually be a lot worse, but that doesn't make it very good."
"O- One of the best rye beers I have encountered, something to look out for and pick up."
"Overall- I would've liked this to maybe lower the ending bitterness in the flavor, and perhaps let more of the hop flavors to shine through. All in all though, this is an excellent beer. I wish it were distributed here!"
"This really comes off feeling boozier than it is and it defies classification. I think BA put into the rye category because it's brewed with that grain but it doesn't conform to any style...and I LOVE that!"
"O: Easily one of the better beers I've had from Two Brothers. Nice flavor and fairly easy to drink."
"O: Solid beer. Went down very easily (and quickly)."
"O - This is just a great beer. There is something to please a lot of people. Lots of hop flavor and a good bit of bitterness. Tons of malt flavor with the complexity of rye and some palm sugar which may not be tasted directly but it must add to the complexity of flavor which is great. Higher on the alcohol but not a huge beer. Fantastic rye beer."
"o: I think spicy, malty when I drink this beer. It is sweet and overbalanced to the malty side but none-the-less complex and quite nice. My bottle is marked ""best by 6/28/11"" and it seems fresh. Thanks Two Brothers!"
"That said nothing here is exceptional or amazing. Just very well done across the board."
"The Brothers are local so I will have to make a trip to further study this beer in its native habitat."
"Overall: I really enjoyed this one. It wasn't exactly what I was expecting, but everything worked for me. I would definitely have another."
"Great beer, I'd always be down for one of these. It was reminiscent of Nosferatu, IMO.. hoppy, tasty red ale. Recommended!"
"Cult classic comes at us throwing hops and rye. Dim mahogany topped with an off-white lacing, this looks like a serious beer. Aromas of spicy rye, orangey hops, toasted bready malt and fruity esters ... mouthwatering. Big malty body flexes with a creamy smoothness. Rye grips the taste buds as a hint of caramel caresses. Hops come off a little sharp to start, but the flavor kicks in with citrus rind and mild tobacco. Warming alcohol has no problem showing its 7 percent, warming and a little fruity. Truly epic drinking."
"overall a good beer. hoppier than expected which was enjoyable."
" This beer is highly drinkable. Goes down easy and is substantial enough without becoming heavy. At 7% this is one that could be consumed all evening. very enjoyable. It encompasses about everything I look for in an easy drinking beverage. Can't stress enough the care taken to create pleasing balance in Cane and Ebel."
"Had a bottle a restaurant near me. The server had no idea what it was or how to explain it to me, so it was a total surprise when I poured it in and sampled. Excellent hop aroma on the nose with a hint of rye. Both hop and rye flavors are well-balanced all the way through, with the grainy sourness of the rye blending well with the citrusy hops. The finish is smooth, and the flavors linger pleasantly for quite a while after the sip. All in all, a very good beer for any climate or any season. The numerous flavors and the way they bend and balance is great."
"Drinkability: Very nice. Almost as good as Reds. Will have to watch this one for sales."
"D: I enjoyed this bottle, and Cane & Ebel is surely a beer I'll pick up again when I get another chance."
"D- amazing. I forgot how much I really like this beer. Needs to be in SoCal ASAP!!!"
"This is delicious, complex, and overall fantastic. Love it."
"D - Great drink for a rye beer; another quality brew by Two Brothers; great job blending complex ingredients of rye & hops to produce a delicate balance of smooth taste: I would definitely have a few more"
"D - A solid offering from Two brothers, one that I revisit often and will continue to drink on the reg."
"D- Very drinkable for being 7% and 63IBUs, very balanced, nice"
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - As stated, very smooth and hoppy. A smooth drink. This feels like two brothers are working together to create the perfect drink. One brother is named hops. And the other brother is named Smoothness. And it's like they high fived each other to create this sweet concoction of a beer."
"Beer pours out a root beer color, with a tan frothy head. It looks impressive and enticing! The smell is quite bold with resinous grapefruit hops and some underlying sweetness from the malts, perhaps a touch of spiciness from the rye. Ahh, the taste is long citric hops with a touch of dryness and sharpness from the malts. Not sweet at all, lots of residual hops in the aftertaste and again that spicinous that I love from a good rye beer. The mouthfeel is full and slightly oily from the hops - not necessarily a bad thing. I had my local liquor store bring this in and when I saw the price tag I said I would only be buying one six pack, well this is number two. Drinkability is high. Everything I love about the style and overall an awesome brew!"
"I really do wish it was getting more attention then their Domain Dupage, which although almost as good, does not have the unique personality and flavor to itself like this beer does."
"d - I thought this was a pretty good rye beer; I liked how the caramel malts and rye mixed together with the citrus and pine hops. A good interesting beer I'd certainly have again."
"Drinkability: A solid beer, and one whose scores I keep upwardly revising as the glass progresses. It starts smooth and I do not pick up on all of the flavors, but as I am able to drink more and dissect the flavors I like it even better."
"SCHWINGGG! F & A!!! F & A!!!! This beer is FRICKIN AWESOME!!! Probably my favorite beer to date! The color is a clear Amber beauty! The smell is hoppy/cirus with something special...that special is Thai Palm Sugar....no less! The 7% ABV is balanced beautifully with hops, rye, caramel malt, and thai palm sugar! The head is nice/white with a perfect lace to follow! THIS BEER IS WORHT YOUR YOUNGER SISTER'S VIRGINITY! High ABV may scare some from a session stand point....trust me...after five tap servings...I still want MORE!!! YUMMY YUMMY! Jesse...thanks for having your reception at 2 Bros!!!! Stay thirsty my friends!"
"D- It's hard to drink more than one of these with the high alcohol and the intense bitterness, but I love this beer for its rye flavor and uniqueness. It really stands out, and if it was readily available here it would be my go-to for a DIPA (yes, it's that well-hopped). Also, if you get the chance the brewery and the tour are both a great experience."
"Conclusion: This had a lively refreshing taste and I would defiantly revisit it again."
"M - Medium to thick body, Chewy. Lightly carbonated."
"D- This was a good rye beer. Not one that I think I would revisit but the rye flavors are very pronounced and it was worth a try."
"D - I think the drinkability is pretty good. It is easy to drink and goes down smooth, but I just expected a little more from this beer. It is good and all, but I just wish the flavors were a little stronger. Overall, its a good beer, it just doesn't really stand out among some of the other rye beers I've had."
"drinkability: interesting and solid beer. wortth seeking"
"Very thick and creamy mouthfeel backing up the flavor yet not really detracting from the drinkability. This beer goes down smooth and makes me want more with every drink."
"D: I like it, but I probably wouldn't buy it if it were locally available, and I certainly wouldn't hunt it down via trade."
"If you're looking for an odd style that remains accessible, then this is probably the beer for you. A dark sweetness anchors the unique sensation associated with using a rye malt, yielding a complex, but balanced, beer with a high alcohol content. This beer might not be for everyone, but it's a great-tasting example of an uncommon style that's worth trying."
"The 7% ABV is masked completely and this is dangerously drinkable!"
"I haven't liked too many beers from this brewery, but they are local so I keep trying their stuff. I think this is their best brew I've had yet. Still, for the price of this 6 pack there are a lot of other options and it will be hard to pick this one again when I'm looking at a good shelf craft selection."
"Very drinkable. If not for the alcohol, this would be a great session beer. One of my favorite Two Brothers beers."
"D: great beer by TWO Brothers, probably one of my favorite offerings by them. Check this one out; not to be chugged."
"Solid beer but very straight forward."
"drinkability is ok - but if the flavors are hit and miss bottle to bottle it will not be a staple in my house"
"D: Drinkability is pretty good here. As I previously stated, the ""marriage"" of the rye malts and the hop profile chosen here is well done. I would definitely be willing to have this beer again another time."
"Deep clear Brown color, whole thing has a reddish tint. Tannish cream colored ring around edge of glass. A few bubbles and spotting on the face of the beer. Very Hoppy aroma, mixed well with a sweet matly aroma; quite a pleasant and settling aroma, very balanced. Nose is slightly stuffed up so this could be completely wrong, but still smell really good through a stuffed up nose. Moderate to high carbonation. Sweet start, Malty rye middle, with the fruitiness of the hops coming through in the end. Dry finish, finish seems to be a combination of malt and hop. Not an intense aftertaste, almost grapey. Finishes clean and light. Beer feels heavier in middle of drink and much lighter after swallow. Sweetness increases with warmth, as well as the apperance of the alcohol, but still well hidden in flavor. Overall it is a good balance in aroma and flavor of malt and hop. Might be one of my new favorite red ryes."
"Had on tap at 2 brothers brew pub. Looks very tasty in the glass. deep brown color. The quality of the ingredients come through very strongly in this beer. Rye bread is very prominent and accurate. Little bit of sweetness and salty mix. I love this beer. Went very well with muffalotta sandwich."
"Cane and Abel has an upfront malt profile but the the rye and hops clash for a red, smoky for a red ale, would not session. The hoppy aroma is misleading to an extent but overall the beer tastes very good. Pours dark but also pours slightly 'thin'."
"I could certainly try another of these, but it's defintely not my favorite rye offering. I was pretty exciting for this beer but was kinda letdown to be honest."
"Overall: I like it. It doesn't stand out for me but i still enjoyed drinking it."
"D: Very nice overall. A good mix of malt and hops. Very enjoyable."
"D= Very drinkable really enjoyed this one could drink a few of these in one sitting. Really want to try more from Two Brothers."
"Poured into a goblet, thin head with lacing all around. A very deep red color with a piny nose. Body is thin, good amount of hop presence but in a nice balance, not too overpowering. The spice of the rye and sweetness of the palm sugars add complexity. A very enjoyable beer overall."
"Overall: I like this one! I like rye bread and I think that the rye was well transferred into the flavour. Its a very original, engaging beer that I will definitely be returning to. Recommended!"
"With an interesting balance of flavors, this brew is definitely one to try out. I didn't know what to expect from it, but boy did it throw me for a loop with its unique sweet 'n spiciness. A beer I would gladly revisit if given the chance."
"D - Pretty drinkable. Interesting mix of flavors. Nothing really turns me off in this beer but there isn't much that wow's me either. Worth trying and I wouldn't mind drinking this again but I don't see myself seeking it out."
"This is my favorite Two Brothers beer to date. The complexity in its smell and taste rocks, and the experience drinking this beer is just all around enjoyable."
"It smells like citrus and pine. The body is huge, and the flavors- well, like I said, I seem to find something new every time. I swear I detected a note of cantaloupe in the last one. This is a big, bitter, fruity and delicious beer. A great way to introduce a newbie to IPAs because it doesn't smack you in the face."
"Drink: It's nice to see what a subtle yet interesting aspect rye can bring to a beer when handled with skill and a light touch. Cane & Ebel take a break from their historically antagonistic qualities and work together wonderfully in this beer. It's all very well-balanced and enjoyable."
"D: High. Great balance of hops, rye, and maltiness. Not at all boozy feeling for 7% abv. Almost sessionable, if it were a little less alcoholic. I could (and often do) get pretty tipsy on this if I'm not careful. A great beer, and reasonably priced."
"D: This is a great rye ale, many layers of complexities and s great taste that has you coming back for more. I find this to be a really drinkable brew for the autumn season, as it brings out nice semi-smokey flavors and hold a nice roasted, nutty finish. Well hidden ABV and oh so smooth."
"I had one at the beginning of departmental happy hour and wanted to go back for a second, but they were all gone when I looked around later! Am going to enjoy buying my own and maybe updating this review with something even more substantial."
"This beer is the highlight of the variety 24 pack from Costco and a long time go to beer. I was pleased when they added it to their year round lineup, and switched it from four to six pack without increasing the price."
"This is a very nice beer. One of the best rye beers I have had. Up there with the best of the Rye Pale Ales. Something I highly recommend."
"Drinkability - It's a nice beer. I had 1, my companion had 3. This one is really dependent on what you taste and how the character hits you. I'm big on smells, and didn't find the aroma of this beer quite as pleasing as other Ryes I've tried. It's a solid beer and would try again."
"As a sum of its components, this is a very drinkable beer. Maybe not a great session beer, but I would like to go have another one right now."
"Overall- This is a very servicable rye beer. It didnt blow me away, but is a great option when you want to have a solidly crafted beer, without needing to over analyze it for any reason. A few of these on a sunday afternoon watching your favorite football team would be perfect."
"Drinkability depends on ""do I want another""? I don't really want another one unless its much fresher. Notice u didn't mention anything about any rye characteristics. That's because I didn't get any. I think I'm going to leave this on my wants list for now and re-review it in the future. I do have the appropriate glassware after all. Of course, it might be unfair that I am mentally comparing it to 2 week old Red's Rye P.A. That beer was phenomenal. I don't think this beer can possibly rival one of Founders best, but I do think bottle date might make a difference."
"This is now my third Rye IPA/Red Ale (Founders Red Rye and Summit India Rye being the other two), and this is simply a sub-style I truly enjoy. Like the Black IPA (or whatever we are now calling it), this almost deserves its own style now, since this has nothing in common with the other, tamer Rye beers out there."
"I guess if I had to choose between this or Red's, I'd be lost. The price sticker would be the decision maker."
"Drinkable....yes It is a bit filling for it's type,rather tasty,not to big and boozy,but the shortage of carbonation put me off a bit."
"This was great. It was one of the few beers that really hit when taking a first swig, and I'd love to have this again."
"D/O- For a 7%abv brew, any style, this drinks incredible. One of my favorite beers I've tried in the last year. If I could get this any time it would be my go-to beer. I like trying as many beers as possible so for me to go to a large beer store in the hopes of finding something ""hyped"" or new, then see this and be ecstatic...well, whatever that means :) Automatically makes Two Brothers one of my favorites, and the fact that it's brewed just over an hour away is awesome. Absolutely delicious."
"I may try some again in the winter with it warm to room temp."
"D-Superbly drinkable beer. A shame I only had one. Kudos to my buddy Gabor the beer man at Penn Station for introducing me to this one. I have never seen it before. A great fall transition brew, I'm going to look this one up again if I can find it. It has the full bodied flavor of a much bigger beer, and while it is no wimp in the ABV category, you would never know it. Utterly superb."
"D: Easy drinking, not entirely smooth (quick hop burst/deep malt), but the transition is enjoyable. Definitely enjoy one before, during and after dinner. Truly an enjoyable beverage."
"Poured a gorgeous dark ruby brown color with a small off white head. Aroma is super dry with nice citric hoppage and some caramel malt. Taste was super hoppy with a rye twinge that could be mistaken for an astringent cleaner. This is fairly bitter. Feel is prickly from the amount of carbonation. Not super drinkable but i enjoyed this."
"I had this on tap at the brewpub as part of a sampler...A bright clear dark copper with amber highlights, lightly clear. A light tan head great retention and lacing...Light malts on the aroma but mostly hops, you can tell its totally dry hopped. Taste is is rye undertones with lots of hops throughout. The hops mostly cover up everything, makes it taste pretty good if you like hops. Decently easy to drink, but nothing special."
"all around a good brew!"
"A: Dense head, medium brown to amber in color, a few spots of foam around the edge of the glass - 4.25, S: Hearty aroma that is heavy on the malts with a solid dose of brown sugar, thick tangerine and papaya, hops provide a nice citrus punch and some earthy touches, very inviting nose though I didn't pick up any rye- 4.50, T: Some caramelized sugars, plums and prunes, solid hop bite matched with an equally impressive shot of malts, a good bit of grapefruit, rye malts are less prominent than expected, elements of a double IPA - 4.50, M: Heavy mouth feel, quite smooth - 4.50, D: A very drinkable and very enjoyable beer, I wish this one was available in my local market as I can definitely see it becoming part of my regular rotation - 4.50"
"This is a pretty solid RiPA that I'd be happy to pick up on a regular basis if it was distributed in my area."
"T- It has a very nice vegetable malt taste. Clear rye in the back. It's smooth but with a slight floral/bitter bite."
"I gotta recommend this to anyone who hasn't tried it yet. It blew my mind"
"D: I could certainly try another of these. Just what the doctor ordered after the day I had."
"drinkability is good. nice balance. a tasty rye beer."
"D - Very intriguing beer. Not sure how big of a fan I am of a rye beer. It is drinkable as there is a good mix of flavors. However I tend to enjoy hoppier beers, but for the style a good drink."
"I was lucky enough to grab a bottle of this at the Black Sparrow in Lafayette, IN. It poured a reddish brown, almost an amber with light white head. It smelled sweet and of rye malts and almost had a piny hoppiness to it. Almost had a candied fruit flavor to it. It tasted great. It was a good balanace of the rye, malt, hops, and sweetness. Kind of fruity. It was full bodied and left a sweet after taste. It was drinkable but I'd only have a couple at a time. It had good flavor and was a very good beer."
"D - I would drink these all night. Maybe I'm just not a rye fan."
"I didn't really care for this at all. I actually poured out half of the bottle. Skip it."
"Overall, another solid offering from the brothers at Two Brothers."
"D: The beer is surprisingly easy to drink and I would definitely try one of these again to sample the interesting mix of flavors. Any traces of alcohol are well hidden."
"Pours a slightly hazed reddish brown, spotty head at best with minimal lacing. Scent is a pleasant combination of spice and citrus with a solid sweet, but not overpowering bready and carmely background. First sip is predominately mild spice and tropical fruits, the spice intensifies as it warms, yet the citrusy hop presence fades slightly, the sweet and bready carmely background does not come through until the beer is almost at room temperature. Medium bodied, slight touches of oilyness, but also slightly watery in the begining. Im torn, had some good charachtertistics to it, but tastes rather uneven and flat on some sips."
"Pours a clean reddish to deep amber color, with a tan head. In the aroma, hops, rye, and a sweeter malt. In the taste, sweet malt, dry rye, and some piney hops. A hoppy bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry rye and pine hop aftertaste. Nice balance; hops to rye and sweet to dry. Real freakin' good!"
"D: Pleasing and easy enough to down, despite a 7% strength. When allowed to warm, the drinkability increases...it's a curious thing that the warming actually wanes and the result 'seems' more sessionable. As nice as I'd hope for and a beer I'd look for again."
"Pours a deep red, with minimal head even with an aggressive pour. A bit of lacing, and a slightly layer of retention but nothing to write home about. When I popped the top on this one, I got a big hop whiff from the bottle. Would have only predicted that from reading the label, but awesome nonetheless. Smells of hops, rye, some candied sugar sweetness and a bit of spiciness; really nice. Tastes is hoppy from the getgo, but fades into that rye malt quickly with a bit of sugar and sweetness to boot. Bit of a dry finish, but a quite a good mouthfeel on the whole. Drinkability is good, could have a couple of these given the opportunity; my glass disappeared quite quick!"
"June 2010 review revised upon revisiting August 2010. Does not disappoint upon revisiting; rather, I have a profound respect for the 2Bros and am enjoying this beer immensely."
"D- On a hot day such as today, I kept reaching for this one regularly."
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium full. This is a very nice hoppy rye beer with nice subtle flavors. I enjoy how different this beer is and how it is presented on my palate. Thank you DIM for getting me this beer."
"Thanks so much for this one Jim, it was very much enjoyed!"
"I found Cane & Ebel to be a satisfying, somewhat genre-straddling beer. It's easy drinking, and does a lot of things well."
"Drinkability: Another winner from the Two Brothers brewery (I also enjoy their Domaine Dupage French style country ale quite a bit). This was an easy beer to session with, I was only slightly disappointed that it came in a four pack and not a six pack, because I immediately wanted more."
"D: this is a great brew, and at a new price, there is a good chance this beer will be a staple in my fridge. I previously reviewed the cask version and loved that, the bottled version is nearly as good, just lacks some of the nuances I picked up in the cask version."
"Overall: I don't have much to say about this overall since I know very little about rye beer. I did enjoy this and would drink it again. Good dessert beer. Good anytime beer really. This beer gets better as time goes on."
"D. I could drink these all night and be happy."
"Poured a dark brownish-red with a nice stable head with good lacing and some yeast sediment floating around. Smells like toffee, toasted caramel malts with a nice citrus hop aroma. Waves of rye, hops, and caramel malts flow through to palate with some good bitterness at the end. Very good balance of ingredients. It has a nice creamy, chewy mouthfeel. A very yummy, well made brew that I would love to try again."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and a little oily, in a good way. I think that it would be a little overpowering to consume more than one of these in a sitting. Very interesting, and very tasty."
"Drinks VERY spicy. From the nose, one would expect to get a very pungent bitter hit from the hops--and they're certainly there--but the balance is pretty impressive. Big, round spice with some caramel in the malt but the floral, grapefruity hops wipe the malt away. C&E drinks big, but I wouldn't have been opposed to having another one (or two?) over the course of an evening. It's just so well-balanced. I'm very impressed."
"D- Very tasty, smooth and enjoyable, could definitely have more than one"
"Drinkability is medium/high. This is a good tasting beer that goes down pretty easy. Not a super high ABV so I could see having a couple of these."
"This is the kind of playfully inventive beer I'd like to see more of from the Brothers Ebel. Well done."
"The body was decent, perhaps a bit thin. Drinkability was good, I'd have more of these if they were local to me. Overall, a decent beer that's worth your time if you see it."
"M + D: Smooth, medium body, carbonated rather nicely with a little stickiness on the finish. It's a very easy drinker, especially considering the 7% ABV which is very well hidden (though the spicy character of the rye could also be muting the peppery or similarly 'spice-like' qualities of the alcohol). I was shocked at just how much I enjoyed this beer, and plan to pick up another pack to take home. Excellent stuff."
"Very similar to the cask version."
"D: You can most certainly to more than one or two. Very nice."
"D: Easily my favorite rye beer. One whiff of this stuff had my mouth watering. Nicely balanced and goes down smooth - this is a winner."
"Overall, I liked Cane and Ebel but not as much as some rye beers that I have had. Not sure if I can contribute this to the ""best by"" date, or not. Id like to re-review a fresh bottle so that I can be a little more comprehensive."
"D: I've had this on tap a few times before, but I can't think of a single time I've had two pints in a row."
"D-Pretty, easy drinking but not very interesting to my palate."
"Decent flavor, couldn't really have more than one though. Really thick; I think a bit more carbonation would be beneficial to this beer and make it easier to drink."
"Drinkability: Not too shabby. Would definitely recommend and drink again."
"D- Very drinkable rye style. I thought it wasn't over the top with rye flavor but a good beer for someone to have that wants to get into the style. I would have no problem drinking 2 or 3 of these before going onto something else."
"This ale pours brilliantly clear deep red with an off-white head. The aroma is moderate-high hops--citrus, floral, and spicy. Sweet malt emerges beneath the hops as well. The flavor is quite complex, initially citrus and pine hop, then sweet caramel malt before a smooth but very evident hop bitterness emerge. The body is medium-full with moderate carbonation. Overall a very flavorful beer -obviously hoppy but still good malt presence. There is just a hint of the ABV, but @ 7% it is well hidden. Recommend--worth picking up a 4 pack."
"D- This beer is great! My favorite rye so far. I am trying to take my time with it but find it disappearing fast. It has an excellent balance of sweet and bitter and superb mouthfeel. I'd drink this all the time if I lived where it was available. Would love to have this one again sometime."
"D - Good. Smoooth and perhaps a tad heavy. Perfect compliment to my dinner."
"D-this is actually pretty tasty. it goes down very easily and brings a nice hop profile for a rye beer. definitely give it a shot."
"Had this beer on cask at D.B.A. on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. I'm not a huge fan of cask ales but I always try it because, well, i'm not sure why. This one was a real surprise. The flavor was awesome and there was a spicy bitterness that helped to compensate for the lack of carbonation that tends to accompany cask ales. I can't wait to try this in a bottle."
"Overall - Thought it would be worse"
"D= Extremely tasty and very drinkable. Probably my favorite beer from Two Brothers and that is saying something."
"D- At 7%, this is a really mellow, drinkable brew. So tasty and so satisfying. Crisp, layered and rewarding. Best rye I've had in a long, long time."
"D- I am on my third so what does that tell you!"
"The feel is medium but is a really smooth feeling beer when it goes down. It is a bit warming at first but not hot or too boozy. A pretty good hopped up red ale."
"Mouthfeel is great! I like it because it definitely is nice and light feeling making it a very refreshing beer."
"Overall, probably one of my favorite rye beers of all time. Impeccably balanced, and full of a great diversity of flavors. Simpy an excellent beer. Must try for midwesters or any rye beer lover."
"D: Definitely a unique beer, and very tasty. A notch below Hop Rod on my rye hierarchy, but an excellent beer, no question."
"OVERALL really nice, easy drinking beer with plenty of flavor. I will remember it fondly."
"12 oz. bottle, best by 10/29/08; sampled January '09. Brewed with rye, palm sugar and Summit hops, dry-hopped with Simcoe. The brew is a chill-hazed cherry red, capped with a thin layer of froth that leaves a bit of lacing. You can smell the age malts on this brew, but notes of caramel malts and sticky hops pierce through and help deliver a satisfactory aroma. Lots of resiny/citric hops on the palate, with a good backing of sweet crystal malts and a medium to high bitterness. There is also some fruity/floral alcohol and a light peppery note, but not really a whole lot of rye. It has a medium body and finish, and the sugar helps to keep this brew from being too heavy. In all, a nice hoppy and malty brew, but the rye and palm sugar don't really stick out at all. Maybe they come through a bit more when fresh."
"Poured copper amber into an American pint glass, with a thin white head but decent lacing. The smell revealed rye/caraway seeds, some brown sugar sweetness, and some pine. The taste did reveal a nice rye/malt balance, but there was a lingering sweetness mid-palate..maybe overripe orange? It made for a disjointed flavor. The mouthfeel did have a nice carbo feel to it, combined with a medium body. For me, a sipping beer; not for sessioning."
"the hops are so fresh coming out of this. great rye kick. C&E has always been a little sweet for my tastes, perhaps just a little slow feeling. i would have thought the palm sugar (or whatever) would dry it out--perhaps they compensate by mashing hot"
"It's clearly not what it is when it is fresh on-tap but still a fantastic beer."
"mid-full body beer. adequate carbonation. good beer. would try this again."
"Summary: Hated this one at first but different tastes started popping out everytime I took a sip. Very unique flavor to this one. I will probably be drinking this one agian."
"This beer had great balance. A good, flavorful malt backbone stood up well to a strong hop bitterness."
"D: As good, if not slightly better than the bottled version but it's hard to battle the tastiness of a cask. But this remains one of my favorite year round offerings from one of the best and friendliest breweries around."
"D- Nice hoppy brew that is fairly well balanced."
"Definitely quite drinkable, and I wish I had more of these to enjoy."
"Good drinkability but not great."
"Solid complex beer."
"This beer is great. The rye malt comes through as the dominant flavor. There is a slight roast at the back end, there is no aftertaste to speak of. This is a great great beer. I would expect the adjunct sugar to dry it out or thin up the beer but it is full bodied, mouthfeel great, drinkability really high. If you like ryes go get this beer. Thanks Naugled. I love it."
"D= pretty good rye beer. The flavor is awesome. The look and mouthfeel are sub par to average. The smell is decent as well. Clean this beer up and it would be one of the best rye beers you can make."
"Overall, a great beer from Two Brothers. I can see why this is their flagship beer. I would gladly buy this again."
"Dark copper reddish brown. Aggressive pour yielded about 1.5 fingers khaki head that dissipated with a good amount of lacing. Smell is sweet and hoppy. Some fruit, not all citrus. Taste is spicy up front, with some sweetness in back. Kind of a dry finish. Similar to a barleywine, but way more enjoyable in my opinion. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy, a little creamy. Very drinkable for 7%. Definitely would buy it again."
"Poured a red/brown with a modest head that reduced to a skin. The aroma was hops bitter. The taste was a very nice balance of hoppy bitter and malty sweet. The feel was medium bodied and slightly oily, with good carbonation. Drinkability was very good. Cane and Ebel compares very favorably with Founders Red Rye."
"M: The carbonation and hops balance well in the mouth, with some warming from the alcohol."
"Mouthfeel is thin and this beer feels a bit under carbonated. Won't be having anymore of these thanks. I'll stick to Founders & Terrapin for my red ale needs."
"As it warms, the interesting flavors of the Thai Sugar come out and leave a nice coating on the tongue, but I can't help but wish for a little salt in the mix with all of these bold, sweet flavors."
"Wow sugary at first, then it gets interesting. Malts everywhere, noticeable sugar sweetness. Caramel sugar sweetness, brown sugar? Chocolate there. Moderate-to-full body. Nice silky rye character. Bitterness creeps up on you, surprising based on the initial sweetness. Foam clings to the beer, to the tongue, to the glass. Slightly odd sweetness and twang on the finish."
"Decent little beer."
"This is remarkably smooth, clean, attractive and delicious."
"Pretty good drinkability but nothing special in my book. Probably not one I would seek out again."
"Tasted this one almost a year beyond it's ""best by"" date. Perhaps the dates really do mean something. I might want to try one that's a bit fresher before making any definitive decisions."
"Purchased from Ray's Liquors in Wauwatosa, WI. I found a ""best by"" date of 4/22/09 printed on the bottle. Shoot. Poured a very dark red body with no head, but a few swirls gave it a little cap. Aroma is of spicy and grassy hops. Full bodied and smooth, this beer has a big roasted caramel flavor with a little ""bite"" from the rye. Great peppery hop finish after each sip. Of course this is better fresh, but it was still as good as I remember the first time I tried it."
"D: Very drinkable, the glass was gone before I even realized it leaving me wanting more."
"D: A nice change of pace beer for me. I'm not normally a fan of Red Ryes, but the extra hop in this beer intrigued me. It will go in the rotation."
"D: I Love this beer. I Love it even more on cask. I could drink a lot of this, easier than out of the bottle."
"D: One or two tops for me, but one damn good brew to drink in a session. All systems go on this one! Recommended."
"Cane & Ebel is highly drinkable with ample character and depth. This one is suitable for occasions with friends or family and can easily stand on its own."
"D - I was pretty blown away the hop presence in this rye beer...it is by far my favorite Two Brother's offering...and probably one of the best rye beers out there"
"D: Maybe being in the city of my youth is skewing my numbers, but I must say that this is a really fine beer. I even brought a few bottles of it home with me. Hopefully it will be just as good out of the bottle as this cask conditioned sample was."
"Pours a beautiful deep deep amber color, perfectly clear, almost mahogany, you now, a bit of brown in the middle, with a huge tannish-off white head, that's about 2cm, stays in a dense little disc on top, and leaves nice lacing. Really a beautiful beer. The smell starts a bit powdery, malty and sweet, backed up with a nice light toast/roastiness. There's a nice herbal hoppy smell, slightly grassy, a bit floral - resinous, with a tiny note of citrus in the background. I like the nice spicy smell here. And I like the spicy taste. It comes on kind of quickly, after the initial caramel sweetness, you get a nice spiciness, both kind of herbal and hoppy, and from the rye as well. It continues, feeling almost like dry cardaomom, a note of black pepper, a hint of lemon, and maybe some green leafy, earthy herbs. The leafiness continues, but it gets a bit like tea, just with some malt syrup in it or something. Finishes a little grassy with a hint of some roasted, kind of burnt tastes. The mouthfeel is nice. Pretty full, kind of on the full side of medium, which is nice for this. Not too sweet, not too dry, and the carbonation provides a nice little tickle. Good balance and quite interesting. The drinkability is good. I found this a very enjoyable beer, and would love to have some more. Of course, I couldn't see myself drinking more than 2 of these in a day, but it's something I'd like to have around, because I can tell I might have cravings for a beer like this. Recommended if you can find it."
"Poored a dark brown caramel color, not going to lie kind thew me off.nose was kinda weak slight hops kinda peak thru. Also kinda dissapointed to me the rye was not what I was expecting but still not bad. Would drink it again and probably will. Almost more like a ipa than a rye, atleast to me."
"Another treat picked up from Anderson's General Store in Toledo. A deep, dark red ale. Bold hop flavors with a decided tang from rye. Totally different from other rye beers that I've tried, but not as flavorful as Red's Rye from Founder's. However, this is still a really nice beer & one I'd love to try on cask. Recommend"
"Drinkability: A fairly easy drinking beer with subtle and nuanced flavors from the palm sugar."
"D - A great rye IPA, I can't imagine many hoppy ryes I would rather have. the fullness makes it hard to drink too many, but still very drinkable and one I consider refreshing for the strength. I recommend this if you are a fan of rye beers and hops - it won't disappoint in either respect."
"D - Cane and Ebel is easily my favorite offering from Two Brothers. The aroma of this beer on tap was beautiful. This is one of the best rye beers on the market, in my opinion."
"Went well with a bowl full of fresh cherries."
"D: Hop Stoopid kicked just before I arrived but you know what? This kicks Hop Stoopid in the pants 9 times out of 10. I love rye and I love hops and this beer provides both in tall order."
"D - i could go for another 12 oz. but probably have to change it up after that. excellent flavor, just really rich."
"This beer pours a deep ruby/amber color with one finger of tan, creamy head. Decent head retention and leaves sheets of lacing behind. Nose is of citrusy hops, nice caramel malts, some grassy hops and a touch of alcohol. Taste is of caramel malts and a bit of breadiness up front, moving in to some grains and grassiness, rye comes through towards the finish. Hops are detectable here and there from start to finish. This is a really well balanced beer. Medium bodied with lower carbonation, definitely a dryer beer. This is a highly drinkable beer, well balanced and the alcohol is well hidden."
"For the creativity of the style, and I think they used some interesting ingredients...bold, clever and creative. Good overall beer..."
"Got this in a mix 12 pack and not sure I will drink the other one. Just not impressed. The sugar cane after taste is just too much. Very sweet, not a fan but always worth trying something different. Never had a beer made with Thai Palm sugar. Oh well."
"Drinkability- quite drinkable. Flavors are memorable, but not too powerful in any department."
"Drinkability: A nice beer, I would happily enjoy a couple of these with any summer meal."
"Cherry amber with a fine sudsy head that leaves fine lace behind as it melts. The nose is pure fruity,hoppy goodness with butterscotch spiced malt notes. Tons of fresh hoppiness, spicy caraway seed and caramel malt balance perfectly together to create a really tasty beverage. Smooth,and kind of sticky mouthfeel, mild carbonation makes this beer go down quickly. A top notch beer."
"Overall, I am really liking this beer. I am curious to know what the hop level would have been like had I tried this when it was first released. I am not disappointed with this brew at all. I could easily drink another in a night. It had some unique ingredients going on and it was neat to be able to try them."
"D: This is a great beer. I wouldn't mind a sixer of this."
"I ended up giving the other from the 12 sample pack to my dad to drink. At least I have the bottle for home brewing."
"D- Pretty good drinkability for a 7% beer. A couple is about all I could do of this. Would like to compare this to a fresh bottle as I really enjoy this style."
"Drinkability: Moderate. Not my favorite in the style in terms of complexity or balance, but still very tasty and easy to drink."
"D: Good but I wish it was fresh."
"This is my first beer from Two Brothers, but I hope it won't be last. I haven't been able to find it here in Cincinnati. More trips to Chicago!"
"overall a solid beer, but not one I plan to revisit soon. If I do, I'd love to compare it to a fresher version."
"Note - After several bottles of this fine brew, it should be noted that the fresher the better... While still solid, this one loses a little something as the weeks pass... My rating takes into account that variability..."
"medium body, with smooth light syrupy moments and resins in the finish. moderate carbonation is lightly prickly upfront."
"This beer was kind of old, so the hoppiness is probably more intense than I felt. Nonetheless, or perhaps because of that, it is a good beer. Too bad I could not notice more rye, but perhaps I do not know exactly what I am looking for."
"This beer was recommended and it far exceeded expectations. Great stuff"
"This beer is also available from the two brothers tap house on cask pour fridays and saturdays. I had this on cask, and it's even better, but currently I'm drinking it from the bottle. It's a deep reddish brown in color, clear with a light cream head. The aroma is definitely of hops. The taste is sweet, with a refreshing citrusy flavor from the hops, and a roasted malty afterfinish. It has a hint of warming alcohol. Actually, it's hard to detect the rye malt. Wonderful beer though, very drinkable. Even better on cask."
"Overall: A pleasing beer, but you must be in the mood for a stronger, darker flavor. The aroma is quite nice."
"Overall: It's passable. There are many other beers I'd rather drink but this one was fine. I'd like to try a different bottle to see if mine was ""off""."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my nonic pint glass. Appears a hazy rich apricot color with about an inch of light ecru colored sticky foam. Moderate lacing sticks to the inside of my glass with each sip. Smells and tastes of rich, spicy caramelized malts, ruby red grapefruit juice, bready grains, and a touch of resinous pine. A notch above medium in both body and carbonation. Looking forward to getting more when it becomes available. Check this one out if you see it."
"Drinkability: It's not a session beer at 7%. But, again, if you like the hops, I'm sure you'll find yourself quaffing a few."
"I have got to admit that I've only had a couple of Rye beers so I'm not too sure how to review this one. It looked good with a lively pour and darker amber color. The head was minimal, but stuck solidly to the glass. The nose was mostly piney hops with a malty/bready combo. Solid hoppy taste coupled with a punch of sugary sweetness up front, followed by a long bitter aftertaste and a distinct grainy dryness. Time to try more ryes. I loved it and will for sure pick up another 4pk in the future."
"The feel is smooth but with medium body. A little bite at the end. Not bad but just a strange, metallic taste that overshadows the rest. Too much lacquer."
"D: As noted before, this is a well balanced beer, making it an easy drinker. An excellent representation of the style. I've had this beer in a bottle previously and it was far less impressed as it was not nearly as lively as this. However, today's beer is exhibiting a greater complexity and (obvious) freshness that was not present in my original tasting."
"Quite a drinkable beer, very tasty and light enough to drink a few back to back. I have a feeling this will be a great summer beer, I'll definitely be buying more when it gets warmer."
"7/4/6/3/14 (3.4/5)"
"While the boldness and relative heaviness of the beer prevents me from chugging it down, I'd gladly drink these all night. I've been craving this beer before getting this pack, and while Hop Rod Rye is a passable substitute and great beer, I quickly remembered why I preferred this one. I wish it was easier to find and a bit more affordable, but anyone who can get it needs to. It's fantastic right now, and even better nearer to peak freshness. I might score this a perfect on tap. It's that good."
"This beer isn't an everyday beer for me but I wouldn't mind having an occasional Cane & Ebel"
"Drinkability: This beer has a nice hoppy bitterness but it is distinguished by the cane sugar as well as the rye flavors from the grain bill; the combination is unusual and really tasty"
"This is a creative brew and perhaps the best offering from Two Bros, and I like quite a few of their brews. Their outstanding use of hops in this one makes this a top notch rye."
"Really a nice drinker, very solid and spicy enough to help the intrigue."
"D: Very drinkable. Each sip definitely leaves me wanting another. This brew would be a great early evening sipper in the summer as the sun goes down after a good barbecue."
"Really diggin' the flavor on this one: starts off with a juicy burst of malty sweetness that quickly gives way to a balance of spicy rye and fresh, floral hops. The spiciness culminates alongside a perfect carbonation level across the back of the palate, lending a nice dryness to the finish. And although the body is on the slightly thin side for 7%, this makes for a highly drinkable brew that I'll surely revisit in the future. Well done, Two Brothers; Cane & Ebel easily rivals Founder's Red Rye in terms of taste and quality."
"drinkability-very enjoyable version of one of, if not my favorite styles. i will definitely grab another."
"OVERALL IMPRESSION: This beer is definitely my favorite that Two Brother's has to offer. It has a uniqueness from the Rye and Palm sugar that is showcased in the beer. It's really a unique take on an American Rye Ale by blending the peppery spicyness of Rye with the sweet citrus spice of American hops. It's a definite must try beer in my opinion."
"This is my second go round with this beer and I may need a third because of consistency issues. I thought it was a better beer than what I'm drinking."
"D- its great to see this one in the year round category from two brothers. something i enjoy drinking a few of in a sitting. check this one out."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, there are better rye beers out there but this is still a good beer to drink for a while."
"M - Great mouthfeel. Somewhat silky and thick."
"D: Solid. The sugar notes I think slow this beer down in this department, but its a nice tradeoff in the flavor department."
"Pours a dark brown amber with nice thick lacing and a nice tan head. Smells of rye and dank hops. Nice malty flavor and hoppy smoothness. Smooth medium carbonation finishes nice and dry. New to the style but this was definitely an enjoyable brew. Recommended."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with a small amount of carbonation."
"Poured from tap into 10 oz glass. Pours a deep dark red caramel with a finger of head. Good retention and lacing on the glass. Very caramellike smell. Taste is of smooth toasty dark malts with a wheaty rye like background. The mouthfeel is light and coats the tongue. I could easily drink a few of these. Another great brew from Two Brothers."
"I'll definitely add this to to the list of beers and brewers I'd like to see here in SC."
"Seems to be a well-crafted beer. The style isn't for me but I can still appreciate the quality."
"Very nice beer, recommend."
"Pours a nice dark red color with rust highlights, a smallish bubbly tan head and some light lacing. Nice, hoppy aroma, plenty of citrus and pine notes and a light spiciness. Flavor is on par with the nose. Piney hops, light citrus, slightly sweet and a solid rye spiciness along coasting along nicely with some toasty, bready malts. Medium bodied, average carbonation. This is a tasty beer. I really enjoy these hopped up rye beers. The spiciness of the rye really adds to the complexity of the hop flavors."
"D - Ahhh...Yeah! A little bit more expensive than there other beers but for a miss priced 6 pack, I think $1.75 per bottle is well worth it. I think the price might be wrong so I am going back tomorrow and pick up some more. HELLO!!!!"
"J"
"Being a hop-head, I thought this beer was phenomenal. I love the floral and citrusy hops, and it had just enough sweetness to make this a very balanced beer."
"D- Tastes great, but a 4-pack in a night is as much as I can do. Not a bad session beer, but there's so much flavor, it's tough to keep drinking."
"Pours with a humongous tight fluffy white head, very thick. Hazy chestnut color. Aromas of gingerbread, sweet and spicy, ginger, orange peel and nutmeg. Tastes of caramel and resin, spiced rum, ginger, cinnamon, vanilla. Nicely bitter hop finish and spicy aftertaste. Medium light body."
"Solid effort by Two Brothers."
"i could drink this again. not sure it would be at the top of my search list but it certainly got me excited for my rye ale in primary right now."
"Overall a great tasting beer. Lots of bitterness with this hoppy red ale. Not sure what to look for out of Thai palm sugar but interesting nonetheless."
"T. Incredibly clean and crisp all the way through. Nice caramel and sharp cranberry flavors. Great hops come through as the rye kicks to end this beer in a very satisfying manor. This beer is very sharp and refreshing."
"Leaves me wanting another... I think I will..."
"Damn solid stuff! Goes down great at first but catches up to ya after the first glass. Worht every sip no matter how ya decide to drink it down."
"Taste is strong rye with a with a nice subtle hop finish(not as hoppy as other rye's I've had). This would make a good session beer for me because of the smooth taste, although the ABV is a little high for a session."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my New Belgium globe. This beer pours muddy brown color with a nice 2 inch head that recedes into just a thin layer. The aroma has tons of rye. Just a bit of hops and a ton of rye. Slight bit of cascade hops and just a bit of raisin. This is hands down the ryest tasting beer I've ever had. It really tastes like a marbled rye with a slice of grapefruit put on top. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and finishes quite dry. This beer reminds me more of an IPA that had a bunch of rye added into it."
"Even though the malted rye was everywhere, it never got boring. You'd think with all the malted rye that this beer contained it would get boring, but it didn't. In the end, it was delicious Rye Ale! I would love to drink this again and in fact, I just did! But this time it wasn't in a little 12 oz. bottle, but in a 22 oz. bomber bottle. Behold the power of the rye!!"
"Notes: I have not liked the hoppy hoppy beers in the past but if they continue to taste like this, a mature, well balanced but hoppy beer, then I might start to be persuaded into the hop camp."
"D: Decently drinkable."
"Pours a clear brilliant red color with way too much foamy eggshell colored head, almost looks like meringue. Almost everlasting retention yields some nice spots of sticky lacing. Smells of rye bread, caramel malt, citrus, and earthy hops with a touch of ethanol. Tastes of caramel and rye with a nice touch of orange, lemon, and grapefruit zest as well as a little earthy hop presence. Medium in body with nice carbonation, fairly smooth and sweet with a good hop character that I think could be stronger if the beer was a little fresher. According to the bottle it's best if drank before 6/19/2008, but even at this stage in the game it's pretty darn tasty."
"M&D - wonderfully complex without pretension, a nice mix of flavors, nicely layered and easily quaffable, a nicely brewed beer, well done"
"M&D--Both are quite high, as the carbonation matches well with the spice without upsetting the balance of the sweet, and the alcohol doesn't get in the way even though it's far from hiding its warmth. Worth trying, without a doubt. I like Sixpoint's Righteous a bit better, only because I like my rye's a little dry (and to use my time to rhyme), but this one's a good representative of the style."
"d: I love a good rye beer. This was a real treat, and I'll certainly look for more."
"This is OK and tastes a great deal like Stone Arrogant bastard but I don't think I would buy this again."
"Great thick mouthfeel, like I was actually drinking something with substance. Almost creamy, a pleasure to drink. Doesn't feel like a 7.0% beer, I think I'll have another."
"Pours a relatively clear dark reddish-brown in color with a minimal (maybe 1/4"") light tan head that quickly faded. Aroma is quite subdued, some light rye bread, a bit of yeast and a peppery note in the background. Taste is really quite good, lots of rye, a solid but not dominant hop bitterness, some perfumey alcohol near the finish and a bit of spicyness throughout. Good mouthfeel, medium-ish body with moderate carbonation, a bit creamy. Drinkability is pretty good. This beer is enjoyable, flavors are balanced, a version with less alcohol would probably make a pretty good session beer."
"HV"
"Overall, a very quality beer. Reminds me a lot of the Bear Republic Hop Rod Rye. Highly recommended!"
"drinkability is good. this is a wonderfully hoppy brew with enough malt character to create a nice balance. the smooth and fresh quality of the draught version prevents the brew from becoming overly bitter or stale on the palate, resulting in a great brew that is quite drinkable. cheers!"
"D: Nice. I like this one. They could easily bomber this one, it is that enjoyable. Thanks Eric for knocking this one off my wants!"
"Good beer overall - would certainly like to try the imperial version."
"Overall, an excellent beer I'd like to have again."
"M/D - Medium to full bodied and a very dry feel."
"This beer is highly drinkable, but the sweetness begins to get to me, even through the bitter, after half a glass. It's still a pleasure to finish, but not nearly as drinkable as it could be if there was a bit less cloying flavor in the middle."
"D: Very nicely balanced red ale with distinct hop flavor. Pretty drinkable for 7%. Almost a session beer, but a little heavy on the bitterness."
"D - This is a very fine rye beer. Great malt and hop tastes."
"This shows a dark mahogany red color with a hefty tan head and good lacing. The aroma is sharp lemony pine hops and deep butterscotch berry. The flavor brings very satiny smooth raspberry malt and piney hops. Delicious and rich with a very consistent and smooth carbonation. Somewhat like a mild barleywine. It has a slight resinous quality which hints at the rye taste. The bitterness gathers at the back of the mouth. There's a touch of dryness on the tip of the tongue. Very nice and distinctive. Fairly drinkable for sure."
"Pours a deep ruby brown color with a short lived cream colored head that settled into a light ring. The aroma is of a nice toasted caramel malt; some spicy rye and hops to boot. The taste is of a solid caramel malt, slightly nutty, slightly spicy. Nicy grassy hops to compliment the malt. The feel is moderate, chewy, semi-soft carbonation, finishes with a bitter twang. Two Brothers sure do know how to make an excellent malty brew. This brew is very smooth, nice rye and hop spice. Recommended."
"I haven't had many rye beers, but this is by far the best so far. It pours a very thick, somewhat cloudy, tawny brown with a nice thick tan head with lots of lacing. The aroma is a very nice balance between oily hops, maltish sweetness, some florals, some grassy notes too. The taste is a really nice treat. There is a touch of thick molasses, thick grainy breads, some nice sweet malts, very nice estery and fruity hops, some grapefruity acerbicness. This beer hits all the right notes. It is bitter without being bittering, thick without being syrupy, slightly higher on the ABV, without being throaty or alcoholy. The mouthfeel is slight, a tad drying, and the aftertaste is very modest. L'Chaim."
"This is a very good beer. Bready, hoppy, lacy. Pours a nice dark amber, the smell is heavily bready. Lacing on the glass is the most I've ever seen, now that I'm looking at this empty glass the lacing remains all the way up to the top, it's incredible. The feel and texture is perfectly balanced, very comforting drink. Drinkability is very high as this is a very well balanced and flavorful beer."
"Taste is initially citrusy and hoppy then the caramel malt backbone comes to smooth things out and leaves a nice bready aftertaste, great balance of sweetness and hops with a decent creaminess."
"D- I would not tire of this one easily."
"Nice beer but I dont think Ill be going out of my way to buy it again.Tasty though."
"12oz single bottle purchased for $3.50 - I think it was from Bauer Wines in Boston. Pours a dark reddish copper with massive fluffy head. Decent hoppy aroma. First taste is sweet. Is that the cane sugar they refer to on the label? Solid balance between a lot of hops and a lot of malt. Full bodied. Good stuff, but tough to say if it's worth the premium."
"D, notes: I'm not sure what the difference is between a well hoped rye beer and an IPA. If it is the sourness this one has it. Pretty drinkable - I liked it."
"D- I noticed a lot of people compared this beer to Founder's Red Rye, and i will agree that the red rye is probably better overall with this one probably being a little more drinkable"
"Appearance is slightly hazy copper brown with ruby highlights and an off-white head. Good lacing. The aromas of citrus and piney hops tingle my nose along with earthy rye malts in the background. Smells very inviting. Flavor has much the same as aroma and the full mouthfeel practically encourages me to chew this beer. Moderate hop flavor and bitterness. Finish is a bit harsh as I get to the bottom of my glass from all the hops, but I guess that means all you hopheads out there are going to really like this beer."
"I'm really fond of the sweetness. What a great flavor. It helps complete an already flavorful and satisfying hop based beer."
"Notes: First time with the style. I have to say I would have it again and again. Good brew and well balanced. Session? maybe,kind of sweet.Alcohol is well hidden and that was a plus."
"D-this is a very fine beer. I could easily toss back several of these babies and will seek it out again."
"I had this beer on tap last night @ DEKS, I had it right after the Brooklyn Grand Cru and it held its own vs a top notch beer. This beer poured a dark clear amber with a very minimal head. The smell is of hops and rye malts. I was amazed with the tast seeing how clear the beer was it was full of flavor. A wonderful hoppy rye, there seems to be alot of them around now and I love it. The flavor is very crisp and deep. The main flavors I get are nuts, bitter hops and wonderful creamy malty flavor. The mouthfeel was very pleasant and it is certainly a very drinkable beer."
"Drinkability is limited only by one's tolerance for hops. This is really a RyePA, and at 7% ABV ends up tasting like a pretty big beer. It is good, though, and it's biggest fault was the metallic taste. A very good tasting and fantastic looking beer. If you can find it at a reasonable price, pick up a couple."
"Pours an opaque caramel color in the glass. A huge bubbly off white head erupts and slowly dissipates leaving sticky lacing all around. Smells equally of caramel and hops. Very balanced, pleasant aroma. Nothing overwhelms the olfactory. The taste is outstanding! The hops and rye play off each other to make this a creamy IPA. the hops are not a present in the initial taste but really come up in the back of the tongue. the taste is as well balanced as the nose. Mouthfeel is pretty good. Nothing hangs on too long but one can easily distinguish the different flavors. Drinkibility is a little lower just from a taste perspective. Unless you stick with a really hoppy follow up, your taste buds will not be happy."
"My first rye ale; for me it's a standard West Coast American IPA with an added dimention. Will purchase again for a bitter fix in the future."
"This is a pretty tasty beer but for my taste I'd like to see a bit more hop flavor to offset the spicy rye. If you are a rye beer fan this one will certainly give you your fix."
"In general, I love the look, aroma, and taste of this beer... but it sits rather heavy, and the bittering is particularly forward. Still, a great example of the style, and worth picking up, and perhaps even seeking out for fans of the style. I know I am."
"D: A nice rye beer from a brewery I have never tried before, but Founder's Red and Bear Republic Hop Rod Rye are in another category all together in comparison."
"Try it with Soba noodles, veggies and tofu in a garlic sesame sauce."
"M/D - the taste is full and enjoyable, you would not know that this is 7% if you didnt read the label."
"D: great first impression of this brewery. I was impressed with this beer, and definitely recommend it."
"D-I like the sweet/citrus hop combo. A very easy to drink and enjoyable brew. Good sharp hoppy bitterness flows nicely throughout to beer to be met with the sweetness from the malt and palm sugar and ends with the dryness of the rye....well done!"
" Great Hybrid beer - the palm sugar is interesting - though I have no idea why. A new favorite - thanks brothers - keep it up please!"
"A very hoppy beer. I would prefer more of the rye to come through. High ABV and bitterness limits consumption."
"Edit: Had this again recently and it was nowhere close to being as good as I remembered. Did they tweak the recipe?"
"Pours a beautiful deep, clear copper with a small dense off-white head. There is a good ring and some foam along the top throughout with very good lacing along the sides. Absolutely wonderful looking brew. The smell more hops than rye with a huge citrus and floral aroma up front with grapefruit leading the way. The rye malt is in the background but noticeable. The taste has some of the same stuff but with a heavier malt presence that balances the hops nicely. There is also more sweetness in the backbone of the taste with molasses and caramel. The mouthfeel is medium for a rye beer, very creamy and smooth but with a fairly dry, crisp finish. Drinkability is good on this one and I would rate it right up there with the best rye beers I've tasted. Highly recommended."
"Overall a damn fine beer. Nothing out of this world, but definitely something a bit different for the hopheads and pale ale fans. It is pretty drinkable, however the price was a bit steep (12.99 for a 4-pack). I would definitely recommend grabbing a pint sometime. I don't think I'll pick it up again in bottles due to the price though."
"D: Superb. Simple as that."
"I would have this beer again."
"D - I wish i could have bought a case. One sitting is not enough... I try to savor each sip to preserve the lone bottle. A very easy drinking brew."
"Recommended..."
"Hope this beer unretires, if not i'll have to find it playing golf in florida."
"Drinkability- Very drinkable, alcohol is undetectable. A panty dropper of the IPA world."
"Wow! This is one very tasty and easy drinking offering from Two Brothers, with full use of the rye notes, a delicous creamy carbonation, and even with some hop fade, some fantastic dry hopped character. I'm all over this stuff next time it's released, as I'm sure it's incredible fresh!"
"Excellent beer"
"Notes: I had this on tap at the Hopleaf in Chicago and it was way better than this - probably a freshness issue?"
"D- This beer is an excellent example of a rye beer. It has a wonderful nose and sold hop character. Very balanced. I could definitely work my way through a six pack of these. Don't let the price dissuade you its worth it."
"Drinkability is pretty good at 7%. I wouldn't mind another."
"D: Nice beer. Very drinkable even for a rye beer. Smooth."
"Nice dark bronze color with a good off white head and spotty lacing. Smell pulls me right in. Nice piney hops with a solid malt backbone that must be the rye. This beer reminds me of Red's Rye from Founders which is one of my favorites. There is something very nice about the way the rye blends with a fully hopped beer that is very nice. Taste is as good as the smell. Full sweet flavor brilliantly blended with the hops. Some significant earthy tones sneak in there too. A nice bitter aftertaste gives this a dry finish. Not sure what the availablility of this one is, I picked it up in a variety case, but I would give this one a huge recomendation if you can find it."
"D: Very flavorful beer with well hidden alcohol, but something in the balance and mouthfeel makes me just want either a red's rye or nugget nectar as this ends up feeling like a compromise between the two, especially at the slightly high price for it in this area."
"D - May I have another?"
"M/D - Malt lingers on the palate and leaves a pleasant finish. Smooth, low carbonation, and tons of flavor make this beer one of the best brews I've had in a while."
"this is a tremendous beer.if you can get your hands on it,please do so."
"A dark red with an off-tan head, poor retention and little lacing. The aroma is very herbal with that rye spice. The flavor immediately reminds me of Red's Rye from Founder's, for obvious reasons. It's a big, but not too harsh citrus tang. As satisfying as any good IPA or hopped red ale, but with that wonderful rye twist to make it stand out. Worth a try. Quite tasty."
"Poured a hazy rusty brown colored head with plenty of creamy head sitting on top. It looks like it was poured from a nitro tap like guinness. Nose is full of rye and spicineyness. Taste is full of hops but also well balanced with plenty of full rye. Mouth feel is incredibly creamy for a Pale ale, and full on hops."
"Overall I was really blown away by this one. I did not expect it to be as good as it was. Really a top notch, quality brew on all accounts that I would love to have the chance to try again. If you see this one around, go for it!"
"Mouthfeel creamy and slick, conveys the full hoppy goodness, solid crisp, slightly sour rye malt background matches the flavor assault well. Alcohol well integrated. A RIPA--rye IPA. Very nicely done."
"Final Note: this beer is NOT retired, it's a limited-run seasonal and it's delicious!"
"D_This is a nice, well made beer where the rye makes its' presence known."
"D- Rich and thick for the style. Not very sessionable, but damn good for a stand alone beer."
"D- good d for the smell and taste alone, but the unexpected richness of the body bumps it up a little. held up nicely to the strong taste of a pizza with feta cheeze."
"This beer pours a deep ruby color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into decent lacing. The aroma is of toffee, caramel, spicy rye, and a hint of grapefruit. The taste is very balanced up front with a lot of spicy caramel and toffee and some grapefruit. The finish is dominated by a dry, lingering bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a lot of carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a pretty good beer. I could drink this agian when in the mood for a well balanced rye beer."
"Cheers"
"D - I really liked this one! I love rye based beer, and this one is excellent. I liked Founder's Red's Rye better, but this is a close second."
"The nose is a terrific blend of citrus hops and caramel malt, sweet and sticky. The sticky really emerges in the taste, combining very well with the hops to produce something vaguely reminiscent of a lighter version of Sierra Nevada's Bigfoot--sweeter, but well-hopped and sticky as Bigfoot is as well. I was very impressed. I greatly enjoy the mouthfeel of such beers; the complexity gives one a bit of everything, never a letdown. This felt stronger than the 7.00% ABV, a bit boozy in the delicious taste. But that doesn't detract from a beer that I'll soon revisit. Tremendous."
"This is one all around solid beer. Pours a cherry red color, almost opaque. Nice hops on the nose and some sweet citrus as well. Very clean, and smooth. Also crisp on the palate and an extremely dry finish. I did enjoy this beer and hope it has not been discontinued."
"12 ouncer, with ""best by"" dating on the rear label. Pours a nice rich shade of dark honey amber, medium tan head, leaving fine lace on the glass. Sweet malty nose. Full flavor darker ale, sweet malts up front and quite dry hoppy snap in the rear. Complex notes of rye, vanilla, some smoke, flowing into a long balanced finish. Nice stuff. Have not been blown away by the other Two Bros. offerings, but this amped up one is fairly impressive. Well worth a try."
"Pours mostly clear dark copper to maroon with a long lasting sticky offwhite head that leaves good lacing. Smell is sharp hoppy zesty rye and some light sweetness. Smells fantastic! Taste is moderately hopped and bittered with a really nice rye flavor, and some good finishing fruity caramel sweetness and a light lingering bitterness. Taste is really nice, noticeably rye-like and is extremely drinkable. Delicious! Thanks Andrew!"
"Drinkability - For a very much too strong IPA not bad."
"This would make a great session beer for me. There is nothing fancy about this beer, and sometimes, that's just what I want."
"Drinkability- I was hoping for a more extreme kind of beer but this makes for an easier drinking brew than I was expecting. The sweetness is a bit cloying after about half a glass but not to severely. Overall this isn't a bad brew but I was really hoping for more. Go with Founders Red Rye or Hop Rod Rye if you want a better hopped up rye beer."
"A hop chirp hits, and in a millisecond is eclipsed by a more-rye-than-rye bite, a sugary kiss and a bitter farewell. Reader, I don't know if you'll understand me or not when I say that this beer is fast. But it is. Holy shit, how this beer is fast. Boom-boom-boom-boom. Four distinct traits, in about half a second. Repeat. THis is how a beer should drink. Slight resinous oil in the surprisingly un-slick mouthfeel makes this beer and my thirst have a cause/quench relationship."
"A very good rye IPA. Bitter but balanced. Love it."
"Tasted on 3/7/08."
"Pours a clear ruby hued brown with a thick creme head. Nose is nice. Definite grass clippings there with some piney citrus. It's a nice full nose that isn't blasting away at my nostrils. I like it. Flavor is smooth. Nice thick grainy level. Bright citric tones. This is an awfully hoppy rye, but it's nice. Smooth liquid feel and a full carbonation."
"The flavors are the same as the aromas but a little heartier. A lot heartier. The viscous mouth feel blend into the slight alcohol flavor and a very faint hint of cardboard. Light green lemon zest flavor is in the middle of it too. But not the good part of a lemon. Other than that, the flavor is impeccable. The rye isn't strong, but it is very good. It starts of light and dry. The bitterness is right up front, turns smooth and creamy in the middle and stays on the tongue. Drinkability is up there. Way up there."
"D - This kind of beer is not my cup of tea, but it is well made and I can see how it would be very enjoyable for an IBU pervert. Honestly, my biggest complaint isn't really the level of bitterness, but that it is such a sharp, acrid bitterness. Personally I think some of those bittering hops might have been better used for aroma and flavor."
"Well this was my first rye beer and I had a great time with it... First the color is a deep amber, there really wasn't much of a head on is when I poured it, but slightly carbonated. The smells are very distinct, but I really liked it for the most part. The mouth feel was great, totally smooth and creamy, but had a little bite on the tongue... Will drink again!"
"An interesting beer. Great dry hop character. Rye adds a nice complexity."
"D: Very easy to drink and tasty. Glad I got more."
"This is an easy to drink and enjoy rye."
"Overall a very drinkable beer. Almost a sweeter IPA. I liked it and would have more. I like the bitter citrus hop tones. It may not exactly be true to form, but still a good choice."
"This beer makes me say ""sure we can session this"". I just hope there is someone to get us home later. A really nice rye ale. Give this a whirl."
"Not bad. Medium bodied. Sticky sweet on the toungue and teeth, yet dry finishing as well. Kind of weird. This one was way too sweet for me. There was a nice hop bitterness at the back but way too much sweetness up front. Not a fan of this one."
"I've only had a few beers that have Rye listed in the name but the one's I've tried have all turned out to be quite tasty and satisfying."
"Great beer"
"Very nice and sessionable, possibly 2 Brothers most popular brew."
"D - really a good beer that I would definitely drink again and could drink easily while hanging out. Definitely not as hoppy as I expected it to be especially since the bottle says it was a hopped up red rye ale. Nevertheless still a very good beer and one they should brew all year round so we could enjoy it all the time. Hope it at least comes back at some point. the only problem is that I only bought one so I guess that is not a possibility. Note that is my own fault and does not hurt the drinkability of this beer."
"Recommended for fans of rye beers. Fairly drinkable, and almost sessionable except the 7% abv would catch up with one sooner rather than later. More good stuff from Two Brothers. This bomber is going down quite nicely, my only complaint is that this is the only bottle i have."
"An interesting beer, I was expecting a lot more hop flavor since it is supposedly ""hopped-up", but mostly my take-away was the strong rye flavor. Decent to try, but I probably won't have it again."
"""It's warm!"" Dulcie exclaims, surprised by the higher temperature of the cask compared with the regular tap. I blush. I thought I had died and gone to heaven to see a barman pull a pint. The cask version is delectably seductive, and incredibly drinkable. That muddy red slightly hazy appearance and molasses/grainy aroma. Taste is a complex mixture of molasses, malt, hop."
"Overall a very tasty and complex beer. Thanks to unclejedi for this one."
"A very good red ale with a rye and citrus twist."
"This one is very nice for sure. I do love rye brews and all the hops in this makes it finish nice and dry but still sweet..."
"Appears slightly hazed deep copper amber with a large off white cream head leaves even lacing around. Aroma has sweet roasted caramel aspects with flowing herbal and mild citrus notes along with a spicy rye kick. Flavor is great I have no clue what Thai palm sugar tastes like but this beer is so unique with the combination of spicy rye, herbal and citrus hop tones, and caramel roastiness. Strong flow of hop oils carrying the bitterness to the edge. Mouthfeel is sticky with hop resins evenly carbonated very smooth, glides going down medium bodied. Drinkability is nice an all around very complex drinking beer that I hope to see again soon."
"D - An excellent rye beer, comparable to Red's rye but creamier which is very good. I love rye beers and I wish they were more accessible."
"Presented to me clear amber with orange hue and a cream head that laces heavily. Nose is bread, spicy rye malt and a little hops. Tastes nice and hoppy with a big malty balance and the rye shows up at the bitter end. Medium in the mouth and very drinkable. Overall a delightful rye IPA that is worth trying."
"Pours a nice rich amber color with moderate head and lacing. I can't smell much in it. If anything, all I detect is the smell of alcohol. A little unimpressed. The taste is a surprise... maltier than I expected with only a hint of hops in the aftertaste. I would have liked more hoppiness to balance this out a little more. The rye is somewhat apparent, but not as dominating as in, say, a Founder's Red's Rye. Still enjoyable and unique."
"Well done."
"Overall drinkability is pretty good, although I won't be seeking this one out."
"The beer pours a ruby red color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a smooth and creamy crystal malt and rye scent along with a wonderful hop aroma. It's bitter with a bit of rye spiciness. The taste is good. It has a very bitter hop flavor that blends nicely with the crystal and rye malts. It's incredibly smooth and light for a beer at 7%. Rye is the new trend in brewing and I couldn't be happier. It's spicey flavor lends itself well to hoppy beers. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a highly drinkable beer. It's complex all the way through; a great beer!"
"Something a bit different and very tasty and pleasant. Summit hops, plum sugar which gives interesting drinkable characterist while being fresh fruit sweet. A good showing of rye, with vanilla.Everyone I shared this with had a different take, reflecting the complexity successfully created, different fruits, citrus. Complex aroma as well."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a shaker. This ale poured a dark brownish amber color with a thick, rocky, beige head that slowly subsided, leaving some extra thick, sticky lacing around the glass. The aroma was very strong and consisted of a huge floral, citrus hop presence, along with some caramel malt sneaking in behind the hops. The flavor was decently hoppy and bitter, but the citrus elements appeared to have been mellowed out quite a bit by the palm sugar. This seemed to give the beer some brandy and vanilla characteristics. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied with a slightly slick, oily feel, along with light carbonation. A very enjoyable and unique beer from Two Brothers."
"Very nice red color with a huge, fluffy off white head. Nice level of hoppiness to it with a crisp bite in there. Heavy handed hop bitterness in the flavor. Terriffic creaminess and soft malt taste. Nice crispness from the rye. The creamy flavor really balances nicely against the heavy hop flavors. Great body-very full and smooth. Just a great beer all around. Very enjoyable."
"D- It is a very decent beer. Few things I don't like but mostly it is a very tasty beer. I wouldn't mind drinking more of this at all."
"Pours a clear rustic amber hue with a fluffy two finger off-white head that slowly dies down to a nice lacing. Webbing is very good, sticky from here to there. Smell is clean and crisp with sweet citric friut aromas with a floral scent as well, a bit weaker than I would like. When I first take the initial sip it's almost like fresh brewed iced tea (with carbonation) but then the hop rye flavor emerges. Sweet caramel malt balances perfectly with the citric hop/rye bite. Almost a kettle corn popcorn flavor to it, yummy. Creamy medium bodied mouthfeel with little carbonation. Ends pretty dry, but in a pretty good way. Drinkability is great, no alcohol in the nose or on the tongue, hidden very well. I said it before, and I'll say it again...more breweries need to make rye beers. Good work Two Brothers."
"Feel is a tad cloying and suary sweet. Medium body with plenty of carbonation zip."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied, carbonated well, and very smooth. Very drinkable beer. Overall, this is a very well done brew. Certainly one I recommend."
"Very smooth on the palate, great carbonation, creamy and full."
"D: If I had regular access to this beer, I would drink way too much beer."
"Pours a very dark caramel color, just slightly cloudy, but I don't believe it's bottle conditioned. Nice big foamy head after a very aggressive pour. Pretty mild aroma of citrus, rye, and an almost tropical mango like smell. On the palate, a faint smokiness comes first with the rye and hops clumsily juxtaposed. The dryness in the midpalate is quite firm with a thin, bone dry finish. It remains quite bitter in the mouth very long after each sip. Body is medium with moderate carbonation, it is quite balanced, not a souped up RIPA like it claimed to be. There's nothing grounding to this beer, it's slightly sloppy. Drinkability comes out low, a bit of a dissapointment."
"Creamy mouthfeel, good carbonation. Almost like it's on nitro. Very easy to drink. ABV doesn't show up at all. Pretty damn good rye beer."
"Nice. Reminds me a bit of Nugget Nectar."
"Initially, the beer is sweet with toffee and caramel. Then comes the hops. There is some pine along with some grapefruit, and pineapple is present also. The beer finishes with a nice spicy rye flavor. Mouthfeel is full bodied, creamy, smooth, and pleasantly carbonated. No signs of the 7% alcohol and this is a very drinkable beer. I wish there were more of this style available to me. I havent had a lot of these, but between this and the two Founder's rye beers, this is quickly becoming one of my favorite styles. This is a great beer."
"Drinkability is very good. It isn't overwhelming at all. Refreshing and very drinkable. Recommended. Cheers!"
"newest batch in 4-packs-the mouthfeel is just a bit thin and lacking a bit in carbonation to my taste."
"Pours a cloudy deep ruby with a sizable head. Aroma is sweet citrus hops with some spicyness. Grainy rye taste with bitter hops and roasty sweetness. The word that kept coming to mind was harsh. Just a little too harsh for my tastes. Otherwise it's a generlly good flavor and a decent drink, just maybe not quite as pleasing as Founder's offering."
"It still retains the dark ruby clarity, and the head is now much inproved in both size and staying power. The aroma of rye grassiness and citrus hops is even better than before. The flavor has a nice spiciness from both the hops and the cane, and the solid malt body balances well against the 68 IBU and dry-hop flavors. The cask presentation makes this beer even smoother and more dangerously drinkable than it was off the keg. If you're in Chicago's north loop area, don't miss it."
"5-31-07 Just had another thanks to czoch75...same scores but what a damn beer!"
"Comfortable on the tongue, pleasant drinking."
"I thought this was a wonderful beer. The beer poured wonderfully into a pint glass, and the head stayed on the glass nicely. The smell was flawless; awoke the nose without overpowering my palate. The first taste produced a wonderful coating in my mouth. A very lively beer, yet stayed right where it should. The hoppiness remained constant, and yet added to finding other notes in the beer as the glass progressed. A wonderful selection to pair with a veggie burger."
"Awesome drinkability. I love rye beers. A dry finish, some bitter hops, and some prickly carbonation make a super drinkable beer in my opinion. I could drink this all the time. Makes me want to get a 6er of one of my fall back beers which happens to be a rye pale."
"Quite drinkable. Scores points for imagination."
"D: I loved the dry hopped effect in this brew. It added another dimension to a very interesting beer. Adventurous but good. Recommended."
"Mouthfeel is decent. Not super full, but decent. This beer is very very easy to drink and very sessionable for a 68 ibu beer with 7 percent alcohol."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark golden color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, nice islands and sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is sweet malty, slightly hoppy, and some caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, with a nice touch of hops, and caramel. The finish is slightly dry and bitter. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is my first Two Brothers brew and glad I've gotten a chance to try it out."
"O - What a fun beer. I really hope that continue to make this beer. This is also an impressive combination that I would like to see more breweries give a shot at -- hopped-up rye. It's unique, flavorful and would go very well with the proper foods. As I said, it's not the most sessionable beer on the planet, but it has a strange elegance that would keep me coming back for more."
"Good stuff, and brewed right in my backyard. I'll be ordering this again."
"It poured a sparkling red with only a little head that hung around a bit. It has a rye-ish (like othe rye beers) and hoppy aroma, with some cedar notes that reminded me of some Hitachino I had a while back. Flavor is dry-hoppy, hop-citrusy, with just a touch of sourness. The sugar imparts a cotton-candy flavor as well. Mouthfeel is slightly scratchy in your mouth, which is pleasant. It is somewhat chalky in texure, but soft at the same time. Very interesting."
"Pours a nice darker orange with a fairly minimal head, but one that sticks around as a thin cap for the duration of the beer.Decent lacing as well. Aroma has a touch of sour and a touch of rye spiciness with some floral hops as a bottom note. Slight rye sourness on the start, followed by spicy combo of rye grain and hops and long hop bitterness on the finish. Citrus notes throughout. Really very nice rye flavors. Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel, and a touch of candy sugar is there as well, but very balanced. Beautifully drinkable."
"Another exciting beer from Two Brothers. I've been looking for this for awhile and finally found it. Glad I did. A really enjoyable hoppy rye beer."
"Mouthfeel was prickly. Medium/filling carbonation."
"D---I wish I had access to this on a regular basis because it is amazing."
"The body is good with a more Belgium feel. Carbonation and the sugary flavors hint at Belgium but the hops leaves more American feel. Overall this is a good beer, but I wonder if I would have sat on it longer if it would be even better. Oh well I still enjoyed it."
"Drinkability - very drinkable. A complex tasty profile that I could do multiple bottles of given a less-limited budget."
"Cane & Ebel is a balanced and very drinkable brew. Sweetness, bitterness and a touch of tartness mingle together with great success."
"A very nice, dry brew. At 7% abv, this is a deceptively strong beer for the flavor profile."
"Pours to a beautiful deep dark brown body with a hint of ruby red when held to light. Hosts a decent 1 and a half inch rich tan head, leaving some lace as it fades. Rich sweet malty hops on the nose, nice aroma balance. taste is soft even hop feel that isnt loud but welcomed. Teams with a bit of nutty backbone and slight malty mouthfeel. Even shows a bit of sugar cane sweetness. Mineral notes shows up as it warms a bit. Extremely easy to drink."
"Without even checking my reviews, I know that Cane and Ebel is the best Two Brothers beer that has ever entered my glass. It's a lip smacking combination of cane sugar sweetness, rye malt spiciness and citric hop bitterness. I consider Red's Rye to be one of the best beers on the planet. I never dreamed that this Two Brothers offering would be almost as good. It will be a crime if it doesn't become a part of the brewery's year-round lineup."
"It's delicious to say the least. Many thanks to dhchatfield for this one."
"This beers looks to have a little viscosity from the pour. It's crystal clear bronze appearance is speckled by dots of carbonation rising at a slow pace. The beige head is thin and leaves little lace. Nice hoppy nose with a little spicy rye character as well. Malts take a back seat in the aroma with a slight bit off toffee coming through. Nice hoppy start on the palate as well. Of the PacNW varieties I would think. The hops are bright and citric and resiny to a smaller extent and lemony. Nice enough. I catch some of that spiciness coming from the rye as well. And everything is backed up sufficiently with a toffeeish English kind of malt backing. Somewhat of a dry finish. Body is close to full. And the carbonation is appropriate. Nice beer and quite interesting."
"Overall I am impressed with this unique beer."
"Drinkability is good nice sweet big rich full of flavors and worth a many tries if I could. Thanks go to merlin48 for this treat."
"This bottle was purchased back in June '06 and resided in my fridge ever since. When this beer was first released in the spring upon initial pour there was a huge aroma and taste of fresh green hops (like they consulted with FFF and copied their methods). When I poured this bottle, I was very surprised by how the fresh green hop aroma/taste receded slightly from the forefront and how the rye and malt characteristics got a chance to step out a little more. I'm very happy to hear that Two Brothers are going to have this as a recurring seasonal."
"Medium body, moderate carbonation. Balance is excellent, with the hops eeking out a slight lead. Surprisingly crisp and refreshing. Alcohol is hidden well in the aroma & taste. I'd rate the drinkability high, and certainly will seek out more."
"All in all very drinkable and the first rye beer that I'd say comes close to Bear Republic's Hop Rod Rye. Not quite as hoppy and a bit on the sweet side but the rye flavor comes through clean and clear. Even as it is it's very drinkable and a near miss from being excellent."
"D - Congratulations. This is one fantastic beer that has it all -- a nice hop profile like a good IPA and a great malt profile like a well made brown ale bordering on a light scotch ale. This beer has the body of a pole dancer and the brains of a Harvard Grad, with a touch of downhome sweetness like she'd add to every loaf of home-baked rye. Talk about your balance..."
"The Drinkability is very good. What a nice smooth and delicious brew. Thanks Shbobdb for this great treat! Prosit MK"
"Very attractive and nice smelling, but just a pretty good flavor. Mouthfeel was a little less than what I'd like."
"Overall this beer rock it is very drinkable. Balanced towards rye and hops mostly. This is reccommended"
"Drinkability is pretty solid, can definitely feel a warming rush of alcohol as it goes down."
"Cheers!"
"I must admit that this I've only had a couple of Rye beers so I'm not sure how to review this one. It looked good with a lively pour and darker amber color. The nose was mostly hops with a malty/bready combo. Solid hoppy taste up front with a long bitter aftertaste and a distinct bready dryness. Time to try more ryes. Thanks to dirtylou."
"This is still my favorite Two Bros. brew and I could drink it all night long."
"red and clear, not very carbonated. not much of a head so kind of lacking in the looks department. its all uphill from there though...smells like raw hops straight from the vine. (cascade?) that's all i can smell, but it sure smells great. taste is hops forward but they dont stick around, which is fine because it allows the rye to come through a bit. nice and bitter but also smooth. very well balanced, soft and velvety. this might be my favorite of the beers i've had from 2 bros."
"Overall, I thought it was decent. It wasn't what I expected for a Rye beer, in fact it seemed more like an IPA of some sort. Worth a try, maybe split it with a friend. Thanks to Vancer for the bottle..."
"Clear deep red, with some white lacing. Smell is dry hops, with some rye coming through, and sweetness like pears. Taste is strong hops up front, but they quickly fade, allowing rye and pepper to come through. Excellent treatment of the hops. It's also not sweet at all, despite the hints of sweetness in the nose. Mouthfeel is a tad on the thin side, drinkability is high."
"Thanks to shbobdb for the chance to enjoy this pretty unique beer!"
"Oh, goodness, the ryes are growing on me. I'm going to want a bottle of this every time I see it at the store."
"Sample at Brew Kettle: Dark amber color with a thin beige head. Sheets of lacing at the top of the glass, and thinner layers below. Aroma of rye, malt and hops. Medium-bodied with a bready malt and rye flavor, along with a good amount of hops and fruit. The finish is spicy with hops and a touch of alcohol. Solid all around."
"First off, a note of explanation on the name of this beer. It was made by Brewmaster Jason Ebel and included a large quantity of Thai palm (cane) sugar in its recipe. Ha! It arrived with a fluffy, light-tan head above a clear amber liquid. The nose was a great mix of light hops, light malt, and a lot of spiciness, like pepper. The mouthfeel tended to be medium-to-thick. There was a really earthy quality to the beer on the tongue, like eating something that had been freshly picked. The finish had the expected rye bite that Sopor turned me on to."
"This was very enjoyable. A spiced American IPA perhaps? This is a beer that is very well made and an excellent example of what a beer can be. Well done."
"Thanks, Clint...another winner...BIG winner."
"Full bodied, pleasantly oily mouthfeel. Not overpowering. Alcohol presence is balanced within the beer. Easy to drink. If you like rye, you will like this."
"D: Not bad, bit off balanced. Hop profile isn't round enough to balance the sharp sugary background. Drinkable for sure."
"Excellent construction here has produced a very tasty rye ale that I highly recommend for anyone who enjoys a touch of rye malt."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" tan head over the clear dark amber brew. Head holds on nicely, with lots of sticky delicate lacing. Aroma is dominated by juicy pine hoppiness, but restrained enough to not burn out the nose hairs. Taste works nicely, with the strong hops character offset by the fleeting sweetness of the malts and what I assume is the palm sugar that the label touts. Spiciness of unknown origin, hops or rye, makes things interesting as well. Mouthfeel is quite smooth, and drinkability is dangerously easy. I'm sure I will find myself revisiting this one."
"Overall, this one is quite interesting. Not something I'd throw back again and again, but it's definitely good for what it is. I'd recommend it to most anyone."
"Thanks to JeffKrenner for the chance to try this unique and easy drinking beer."
"On tap at Boston's. Pours a dark brown color with some copper highlights. Thick fluffy white head holds together very well. Citrusy and floral aroma. Nice caramel malt background combines with just a hint of spicy rye. Nice floral and citrusy hop combination compliments the malt quite well. Medium body with appropriate carbonation. Nice patches of lace cling to the sides of the glass to the very end. A very nice IPA that when added with some rye produces pleasant results. Nice."
"Fine, solid brew."
"Pours a clear coppery orange, topped with a receding off white head. No bottle conditioning? Head dies very quickly into a meek collar. No lacing. Aroma is pretty much all hops. Citrusy and bright, with a fresh, punchy attack. An unusual sugary sweet fruitiness in the background, I expect from the added sugar. A bit too saccharine to be malt. It adds to the orange juice citrusy scent. The flavor opens with sweet caramel right up front. Big, bold flavor with a healthy dose of green fruit. Kiwi, apples, grapes. Hops peep in early, delivering orangey citrus with a bit of a bright green lime tang. The color may be red, but the taste screams green. Green hops, green fruit, green face if you drink too many bombers. Amazingly smooth and silky, with a firm, full body and gentle carbonation. I'm very happy with that, as it makes the beer just glide across the palate. I'm sure the rye contributes something to the effect, too. Is this oak aged? Something gives off that feel. Prominent citrusy hops in the finish, very sunny and fresh. Unusual sweet aftertaste that lingers on with the hop bitterness. Amazingly well balanced, with the oddball palm sugar and all. Some beer-batter yeast presence. I don't know how many batches it took to nail this, but nail it they did. I'll be buying another and probably extra to share with friends. Word on the street is that they brewed this with a new super alpha hop variety called Summit (18%!!!). It's amazingly juicy. Might be a new favorite of mine. Very good. I look forward to the Philosophers Stone."
"Unbelievabley balanced, with moderate carbonation, rich yet subtle and easy to drink."
"D-Easy to drink and a bit unique. I may choose to belly up to this one all night if it were on tap, but I may run for a Founder's Red's first!"
"bomber split with dirtylou during my stay in WI"

"Pours dark amber to brown in color and clear with a minimal light tan head. Light malty sweetness in the aroma, there is also some sweet citrus hops and a light bubble gum or cotton candy sweetness. The light cotton candy like aroma comes thru in the flavor especially as it warms and is unique and enjoyable. There is also some lemon, orange and grassy hops. The beer is light to medium in body and has a nice spicy rye and hop finish that dries the palate at the same time that a slight lingering sweetness balances the dryness. Alcohol is not noticeable to me in the aroma or flavor. Nothing too over the top here but some very well balanced, interesting, and enjoyable flavors came thru close to room temp and made this an easier drinker for me."
"The rye is muted a bit in this beer and it seems it's mostly just a huge double IPA with touches of rye. Not to say it's bad in a anyway, but it is what is. A like it, good beer."
"This is another winner from Two Brothers. Do these guys make a bad beer?"
"I often think that rye beers are way to grain-ey and bite-ey, but when used in an IPA, I think that the grain hull bittering adds a strength and additional character to the hops. This beer is just that, a serious IPA already, but intensified in the bittering by the rye addition. Allowing a solid malty, toffee sweetness to excape the bittering initially and in the finish. Otherwise, the citrus, piney hops and strong bittering dominates the brew. Good beer, if only on those occations when a hop flavored beer just won't cut it."
"Highly drinkable 7% beer. Very good."
"A great beer all-around and very drinkable. Could certainly be a session beer."
"And layered and perfectly balanced rye that kicks your ass but doesn't hurt you. It loves you too much to leave a mark."
"Overall impression: Very refreshing summer brew. I really enjoy the combination of rye and hops. This is a pretty good example of them blending well in a beer. Recommended."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is full bodied and loaded with flavor. The beer has a long lasting flavor due to oilyness. The beer is very easy to drink. I enjoyed this beer from the point I opened it until it was gone. Hopefully this beer will be reoccuring."
"Pours a clear reddish brown, big off white head forms, tons of lace and great retention. Smell is spicy, grapefruit and floral, pine, caramel, little bit alcohol, hops are real nice. Taste is spicy, pine and grapefruit hops, caramel and sugar cane in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, nice clean bitterness in the finish, most excellent."
"D- not my favorite type of beer, hence the rating. If you like ""hoppy"" ales this is the one for you. great example."
"Bold red-chestnut in color with a foamy, thick beige head. Aroma of hops, rye and some sweetness. Taste is nicely bitter - with a lot of floral, citrusy hops balanced by the palm sugar and a subtle Rye element. Dry and crisp, with some malty softness in the finish. Quite nice to sip."
"Taste- A great mix of brown sugared red rye, funky hops with a real resiny character, and grapefruit peels. Just an amzing mix of flavors in this artisanal brew."
"Drinkability - this is very, very good, and it goes down well. However, this is perhaps too bold for many, that is, it's too extreme for the masses, which could impact its drinkability, that is, if you are in mixed company. But, if you are with other BA's and/or craft beer drinkers, then it's quite sessionable."
"So many flavors at once. Spicy rye. Sweet grapefruit hops. Bready malt. Mmm. Medium mouthfeel. Ample carbonation. No alcohol taste. Drinks smooth, but lots of flavor to drink a lot of. Amazingly interesting and enjoyable."
"I would love to try this on tap and/or cask. My new favorite from this brewery. Off to the store for more!!"
"The beer poured deep mahogany to amber, very clear topped by a nice sized tan colored head. The head leaves a delicate lace on the side of the glass as it recedes. The nose reminds me of a nutty Arrogant Bastard. There is a distinct nutty character from the rye, followed by a citrus/pine balance from hops (glacier, or warrior hops maybe). Nice malt backbone, some dark caramel. The flavor is even more intense. They hazelnut character comes across immediately. The hops character is melding nicely with the malt. The pine is subdued, but a mandarin orange sweetness comes forward (maybe the hops are simcoe). The toffee sweetness from the malt provides a nice finish. The mouth feel is dry, and slightly slick. Overall, a really nice beer. I should have bought another bomber."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a really nice creamy aspect that fills the mouth with each sip. Spot on carbonation makes this one disappear from my glass with the greatest of ease. Overall, the best brew I've had from Two Brothers thus far and a benchmark for the rye beer style. Read on the Two Bros website that this might become a regular in six packs...please, please, please let that be true as I for one will buy it all the time!"
"D: Highly drinkable rye beer. Best on tap, but very tasty in the bottle. Slightly high abv flys under the radar."
"22 oz bottle pours a deep, deep red color with a nice creamy off white head that leave a thick sticky lacing in my glass. Hoppy aromas of pineapple and pine. Resiny pine, citrus and pineapple flavors, medium bodied with a creamy mouthfeel, finishes bitter and dry. Really drinkable at 7% alcohol, very nice."
"22 oz bomber. Pours a deep amber color with a finger and a half of solid light khaki head that falls to just under a finger of foam. Clarity is excellent and only a small carbonation bubbles up the sides of the glass. Very nice looking beer. Aroma is very nice. Initially, I get grapefruit and caramel, along with a very nice spicey rye mingling with those sweet smells. I like it. Flavor brings nice candies hop flavor, sweet caramel, spun sugar, backed with a mild rye spiceyness and a moderate bitterness that carries through very well, leaving me wanting more of the beer. Very nice. Mouthfeel is moderate with a moderate carbonation. It works well for the flavors that are present. Overall, I really do enjoy this one. This is probably the best beer from this brewery that I have tried. It drinks like a 5% ABV beer, the flavors are very full, and it's very enjoyable. With this being on tap at all the locals, I'll have a hard time visiting other beers. Good show."
"Slàinte!"
"Pours a dark red with a clear body leaving a thin white lace for a head. The smell is spicy hops, citrus, earthy bread tones, and finishes with a sugar cane taste that is very apparent. The taste is sweet, it starts with a bitter hop bite that is smooth and balanced with the cane sweetness and a cereal undertone this is a very interesting beer one that is easily one of my favorite rye beers. The combination of rye and hops is fantastic, I hope this brew is here to stay."
"D- This beer has very grassy hop notes and I didn't notice the exotic palm sugar subtleties. I will have to try another bottle or two and see if I can find those flavors."
"Cane & Ebel is a fairly full-bodied IPA that pours a dark amber/red hue topped with a bright white head. The aroma pleasant aroma is full of pine cone hoppiness with a rye bread accent. This is a tasty IPA with a candy caramel maltiness that mixes well with more of the citrus and pine hops. The finish is bitter and alcoholic (more so than the alcohol content would suggest), but doesn't detract too much from the overal enjoyment of this tasty ale."
"Drinkability - Definitely worth repeating, this could be a good session beer."
"This is a good one of a kind + you should definitely check it out."
"Interesting..."
"The beer was very drinkable and similair in taste to Red's Rye. A very nice balance of flavors. An innitial taste might leave one thinking this favors the hops only, but a balance of flavors; of sweetness and bitterness, is well done and lends a great deal to the beer's drinkability."
"Beautiful beer...deep mahogany... had it on tap at charlies ale house in wheaton. The roughly 7% alcohol is undetectable, probably because the distinct flavor of the summit hop covers it up. Fairly citrusy and slightly earthy/herbaly... this beer is one to be reckoned with."
"Loved it a bit more on tap, but not losing much in a bottle...probably the best beer to come out of TBB in my book."
"This is a very nice rye beer. The rye taste is dominant, with a decisive hop backbone. Weighing in at 7% abv, it is a very substantial beer, but it is very smooth in the mouth, and as a result, very drinkable. It is like drinking a sweet rye bread."
"Beermail me if you ever see this cask-conditioned. I'll drive to Chicago if need be."
"D-I am in love with this beer. Great balance, very intriguing. The hops-rye combo makes me very happy. This beer would add an interesting demension to spicy Asian or Latin American foods."
"D - A very intriguing complex beer. I had a hard time determining the weird flavor in the middle and that is the only thing that kept this from being scored higher."
"I don't usually review from memory, but I went to the release party for this beer at the Hop Leaf the other day and I was really impressed. A white head topped a rusty red colored beer. It has a sweet fruity/floral smell and assertive hoppy flavor that hits you right away. As you work through the pint it develops a kind of creaminess and sweetness in back of the hop bitterness that gave it layers of flavor making me want to drink more & more. This is my new favorite beer from Two Bros. It wowed me and is going on tap at both of my establishments."
