4.02,-1.7,4.25,4,4,4,4,"Brew pours a pretty dark amber in color with a good 1-finger thick foamy off-white head. Lots of sheet lacing was seen when sipped that stuck to the sides of the glass. Lots going on with the aroma as there is some burnt brown sugar, spices and woodsey hops. More going on with the taste even with some roasted malts with a touch of caramel in the mix as well. Finishes slightly dry with a slight bitter finish but that only last a couple of seconds. Overall a decent brew. Medium-bodied with perfect carbonation.","BeerWithMike","Mar 21, 2015"

Strong flavors, but all good flavors, a bit bitter but pleasant aftertaste.  Rich, complex, sturdy, massively excellent beer that just kicks ass.","MNJR","Feb 18, 2015"

The smell is very nice, previews the hop taste that is to come with your first sip. A nice balance hop taste with a great malted barley taste. It's a complex flavored beer but not so bold that someone who doesn't get into the super bold beer styles shouldn't like it. Very well balanced and smooth drinking. Having mine with some popcorn lol and it goes awesome. A very good brew, my favorite two brothers brew so far.","MIchelle","Apr 24, 2014"

Pours moderately hazy deep copper color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of mango, tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, orange zest, lemon zest, caramel, rye, toast, floral, grass, candi sugar, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop and malt notes; with good strength. Taste of mango, tangerine, pineapple, orange zest, lemon zest, caramel, rye, toast, candi sugar, floral, grass, light pine, and floral earthiness. Light earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of tangerine, mango, pineapple, orange/lemon zest, caramel, rye, toast, floral, grass, candi sugar, and light pine on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of malt and hop flavors; with a nice crisp hop/malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a slightly creamy, smooth, and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice hoppy rye ale. All around good balance and complexity of hop and malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 12, 2014"

It pours a translucent, carbonated, deep ruddy hue, with a thick layer of foam blanketing the top. Excellent retention and lacing. It's got a very sweet, yet earthy aroma, likely due to the Palm Sugar. I actually am imagining raw sugar cane having a similar scent. Bready grains were noted along with a touch of Lemon Balm or Hyssop. The flavor was quite hoppy with toasted rye bread and a backing from the malts. It finishes very dry. Overall, this felt a little light across the palate but was still very enjoyable.","Neorebel","Jun 05, 2013"

4.12,0.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a snifter. Off-white head, moderate retention on a dark amber body. Lacing is soapy and clear, sticky. Aroma includes some caramel malt, but is certainly dominated by quite a hop bill. Resinous hop juiciness in the form of grapefruit and grass, some earthiness. Taste is biting and bitter balanced by some nice malt sweetness. Tongue coating with a warming mouthfeel. Very tasty.","KickbacksSteve","Dec 03, 2012"

3.71,-9.3,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"D/O: This intensely savory beer drowns out the advertised hopped-up qualities, borrowing just enough citrus to allow a nod in the direction of balance.

While as drinkable as most IPAs, it seems a bit less composed that some other offerings from Two Brothers, such as Domaine du Paige or Resistance.","beagle75","Oct 11, 2011"
4.03,-1.5,4.5,4,4,4,4,"An extremely tasty beer, full of complexity and style. If they could lower the ABV a point to avoid the detectable ethanol, this would improve the beer. I believe this would be even more spectacular when fresh.","falloutsnow","Oct 09, 2011"

4.31,5.4,5,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Cane & Ebel is a very dark brown, almost black, cola colored brew, which glows an amber read when held to the light. Topping it off is a good-sized, foamy, tan colored head. Sheets of lacing adorn the glass. The scent is pretty hoppy, with rye of course, with maybe just a touch of sourness. The taste is pretty big and bold; lots of grainy characteristics from the rye, a fair amount of bitterness from the hops, though it is well-blended, some spice from the alcohol, fair amount of citrus and grapefruit tones, pretty sweet. Medium bodied and sharp on the tongue.","Tballz420","Aug 23, 2011"

4.3,5.1,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Mellow but strong in equal measure, Cane & Abel is a showcase of brewing skill, melding jaw breaking strength with a balanced profile that belies that strength and settles into a balanced easy drinker. Pours a light crystal clear brown with ample sticky lacing, this brew starts with a malty caramel aroma that buoys a significant eatery piny hop aroma. The first sip is surprising as the aggressive hop content does not attack the tastebuds with prickly abandon, instead choosing to lay in wait, allowing the smooth body to mellow into a melange of malt sugars then gradually creep back lending a long resiny aspect to the flavorful finish. Skirting the territory of the barley wine, Cane & Abel deftly avoids that moniker choosing instead a strong but flavorful profile that hides its muscles in a classy and complex veil of flavors. Very well done from this young brewery.","BeerBeatnik","Jun 29, 2011"
4.19,2.4,3.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"OVERALL: This is one of the better beers in Chicago and it's wide availability in the area makes it one of my standards.

It pours a clear ruby topped by a finger of glowing dirty white foam and exhibiting a decent amount of matter floating about within. The nose comprises orange peel, onion, toasted rye bread, black pepper, and dark toffee. The taste holds notes of soil, orange rind, light mandarin orange, potato skin, grass, and a touch of toffee. I winced a bit whilst drinking this. The body is a barely-light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, I was not much of a fan of this at all, really. The flavors don't do anything all that great for me, and the smell comes kinda close to offensive.

Aromas of spicy rye, orangey hops, toasted bready malt and fruity esters ... mouthwatering. Big malty body flexes with a creamy smoothness. Rye grips the taste buds as a hint of caramel caresses.

The finish is smooth, and the flavors linger pleasantly for quite a while after the sip. All in all, a very good beer for any climate or any season.

The smell is quite bold with resinous grapefruit hops and some underlying sweetness from the malts, perhaps a touch of spiciness from the rye. Ahh, the taste is long citric hops with a touch of dryness and sharpness from the malts. Not sweet at all, lots of residual hops in the aftertaste and again that spicinous that I love from a good rye beer. The mouthfeel is full and slightly oily from the hops - not necessarily a bad thing. I had my local liquor store bring this in and when I saw the price tag I said I would only be buying one six pack, well this is number two. Drinkability is high.

Very Hoppy aroma, mixed well with a sweet matly aroma; quite a pleasant and settling aroma, very balanced. Nose is slightly stuffed up so this could be completely wrong, but still smell really good through a stuffed up nose. Moderate to high carbonation. Sweet start, Malty rye middle, with the fruitiness of the hops coming through in the end. Dry finish, finish seems to be a combination of malt and hop. Not an intense aftertaste, almost grapey. Finishes clean and light. Beer feels heavier in middle of drink and much lighter after swallow. Sweetness increases with warmth, as well as the apperance of the alcohol, but still well hidden in flavor. Overall it is a good balance in aroma and flavor of malt and hop.

The brew is a chill-hazed cherry red, capped with a thin layer of froth that leaves a bit of lacing. You can smell the age malts on this brew, but notes of caramel malts and sticky hops pierce through and help deliver a satisfactory aroma. Lots of resiny/citric hops on the palate, with a good backing of sweet crystal malts and a medium to high bitterness. There is also some fruity/floral alcohol and a light peppery note, but not really a whole lot of rye. It has a medium body and finish, and the sugar helps to keep this brew from being too heavy. In all, a nice hoppy and malty brew, but the rye and palm sugar don't really stick out at all. Maybe they come through a bit more when fresh.","mmmbeer","Dec 08, 2009"

The smell revealed rye/caraway seeds, some brown sugar sweetness, and some pine. The taste did reveal a nice rye/malt balance, but there was a lingering sweetness mid-palate..maybe overripe orange?

4.08,-0.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Pours a beautiful deep deep amber color, perfectly clear, almost mahogany, you now, a bit of brown in the middle, with a huge tannish-off white head, that's about 2cm, stays in a dense little disc on top, and leaves nice lacing. Really a beautiful beer. The smell starts a bit powdery, malty and sweet, backed up with a nice light toast/roastiness. There's a nice herbal hoppy smell, slightly grassy, a bit floral - resinous, with a tiny note of citrus in the background. I like the nice spicy smell here. And I like the spicy taste. It comes on kind of quickly, after the initial caramel sweetness, you get a nice spiciness, both kind of herbal and hoppy, and from the rye as well. It continues, feeling almost like dry cardaomom, a note of black pepper, a hint of lemon, and maybe some green leafy, earthy herbs. The leafiness continues, but it gets a bit like tea, just with some malt syrup in it or something. Finishes a little grassy with a hint of some roasted, kind of burnt tastes. The mouthfeel is nice. Pretty full, kind of on the full side of medium, which is nice for this. Not too sweet, not too dry, and the carbonation provides a nice little tickle. Good balance and quite interesting. The drinkability is good. I found this a very enjoyable beer, and would love to have some more. Of course, I couldn't see myself drinking more than 2 of these in a day, but it's something I'd like to have around, because I can tell I might have cravings for a beer like this. Recommended if you can find it.","taylorhamrick","Jul 20, 2009"

It has a slight resinous quality which hints at the rye taste. The bitterness gathers at the back of the mouth. There's a touch of dryness on the tip of the tongue. Very nice and distinctive.

The feel is moderate, chewy, semi-soft carbonation, finishes with a bitter twang. Two Brothers sure do know how to make an excellent malty brew. This brew is very smooth, nice rye and hop spice.

The aroma is a very nice balance between oily hops, maltish sweetness, some florals, some grassy notes too. The taste is a really nice treat. There is a touch of thick molasses, thick grainy breads, some nice sweet malts, very nice estery and fruity hops, some grapefruity acerbicness. This beer hits all the right notes. It is bitter without being bittering, thick without being syrupy, slightly higher on the ABV, without being throaty or alcoholy.

A wonderful hoppy rye, there seems to be alot of them around now and I love it. The flavor is very crisp and deep. The main flavors I get are nuts, bitter hops and wonderful creamy malty flavor.

Very balanced, pleasant aroma. Nothing overwhelms the olfactory. The taste is outstanding! The hops and rye play off each other to make this a creamy IPA. the hops are not a present in the initial taste but really come up in the back of the tongue. the taste is as well balanced as the nose. Mouthfeel is pretty good. Nothing hangs on too long but one can easily distinguish the different flavors. Drinkibility is a little lower just from a taste perspective.

Absolutely wonderful looking brew. The smell more hops than rye with a huge citrus and floral aroma up front with grapefruit leading the way. The rye malt is in the background but noticeable. The taste has some of the same stuff but with a heavier malt presence that balances the hops nicely. There is also more sweetness in the backbone of the taste with molasses and caramel. The mouthfeel is medium for a rye beer, very creamy and smooth but with a fairly dry, crisp finish.

I was very impressed. I greatly enjoy the mouthfeel of such beers; the complexity gives one a bit of everything, never a letdown.

Nevertheless still a very good beer and one they should brew all year round so we could enjoy it all the time. Hope it at least comes back at some point. the only problem is that I only bought one so I guess that is not a possibility.

It has a very bitter hop flavor that blends nicely with the crystal and rye malts. It's incredibly smooth and light for a beer at 7%. Rye is the new trend in brewing and I couldn't be happier.

This ale poured a dark brownish amber color with a thick, rocky, beige head that slowly subsided, leaving some extra thick, sticky lacing around the glass. The aroma was very strong and consisted of a huge floral, citrus hop presence, along with some caramel malt sneaking in behind the hops. The flavor was decently hoppy and bitter, but the citrus elements appeared to have been mellowed out quite a bit by the palm sugar. This seemed to give the beer some brandy and vanilla characteristics. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied with a slightly slick, oily feel, along with light carbonation.

Smell is clean and crisp with sweet citric friut aromas with a floral scent as well, a bit weaker than I would like. When I first take the initial sip it's almost like fresh brewed iced tea (with carbonation) but then the hop rye flavor emerges. Sweet caramel malt balances perfectly with the citric hop/rye bite. Almost a kettle corn popcorn flavor to it, yummy. Creamy medium bodied mouthfeel with little carbonation. Ends pretty dry, but in a pretty good way.

The dryness in the midpalate is quite firm with a thin, bone dry finish. It remains quite bitter in the mouth very long after each sip. Body is medium with moderate carbonation, it is quite balanced, not a souped up RIPA like it claimed to be. There's nothing grounding to this beer, it's slightly sloppy.

Nice hoppy start on the palate as well. Of the PacNW varieties I would think. The hops are bright and citric and resiny to a smaller extent and lemony. Nice enough. I catch some of that spiciness coming from the rye as well. And everything is backed up sufficiently with a toffeeish English kind of malt backing. Somewhat of a dry finish. Body is close to full.

4.5,10,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" tan head over the clear dark amber brew. Head holds on nicely, with lots of sticky delicate lacing. Aroma is dominated by juicy pine hoppiness, but restrained enough to not burn out the nose hairs. Taste works nicely, with the strong hops character offset by the fleeting sweetness of the malts and what I assume is the palm sugar that the label touts. Spiciness of unknown origin, hops or rye, makes things interesting as well. Mouthfeel is quite smooth, and drinkability is dangerously easy. I'm sure I will find myself revisiting this one.","ppoitras","Sep 01, 2006"

Nice caramel malt background combines with just a hint of spicy rye. Nice floral and citrusy hop combination compliments the malt quite well. Medium body with appropriate carbonation. Nice patches of lace cling to the sides of the glass to the very end. A very nice IPA that when added with some rye produces pleasant results. Nice.","Bierguy5","Aug 26, 2006"

4.27,4.4,3.5,4,4,5,5,"Pours a clear coppery orange, topped with a receding off white head. No bottle conditioning? Head dies very quickly into a meek collar. No lacing. Aroma is pretty much all hops. Citrusy and bright, with a fresh, punchy attack. An unusual sugary sweet fruitiness in the background, I expect from the added sugar. A bit too saccharine to be malt. It adds to the orange juice citrusy scent. The flavor opens with sweet caramel right up front. Big, bold flavor with a healthy dose of green fruit. Kiwi, apples, grapes. Hops peep in early, delivering orangey citrus with a bit of a bright green lime tang. The color may be red, but the taste screams green. Green hops, green fruit, green face if you drink too many bombers. Amazingly smooth and silky, with a firm, full body and gentle carbonation. I'm very happy with that, as it makes the beer just glide across the palate. I'm sure the rye contributes something to the effect, too. Is this oak aged? Something gives off that feel. Prominent citrusy hops in the finish, very sunny and fresh. Unusual sweet aftertaste that lingers on with the hop bitterness. Amazingly well balanced, with the oddball palm sugar and all. Some beer-batter yeast presence. I don't know how many batches it took to nail this, but nail it they did. I'll be buying another and probably extra to share with friends. Word on the street is that they brewed this with a new super alpha hop variety called Summit (18%!!!). It's amazingly juicy. Might be a new favorite of mine. Very good. I look forward to the Philosophers Stone.","UnionMade","Aug 24, 2006"

Light malty sweetness in the aroma, there is also some sweet citrus hops and a light bubble gum or cotton candy sweetness. The light cotton candy like aroma comes thru in the flavor especially as it warms and is unique and enjoyable. There is also some lemon, orange and grassy hops. The beer is light to medium in body and has a nice spicy rye and hop finish that dries the palate at the same time that a slight lingering sweetness balances the dryness. Alcohol is not noticeable to me in the aroma or flavor. Nothing too over the top here but some very well balanced, interesting, and enjoyable flavors came thru close to room temp and made this an easier drinker for me.","hoppymeal","Aug 15, 2006"

This beer is just that, a serious IPA already, but intensified in the bittering by the rye addition. Allowing a solid malty, toffee sweetness to excape the bittering initially and in the finish. Otherwise, the citrus, piney hops and strong bittering dominates the brew. Good beer, if only on those occations when a hop flavored beer just won't cut it.","BEERchitect","Aug 08, 2006"

4.07,-0.5,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"The beer poured deep mahogany to amber, very clear topped by a nice sized tan colored head. The head leaves a delicate lace on the side of the glass as it recedes. The nose reminds me of a nutty Arrogant Bastard. There is a distinct nutty character from the rye, followed by a citrus/pine balance from hops (glacier, or warrior hops maybe). Nice malt backbone, some dark caramel. The flavor is even more intense. They hazelnut character comes across immediately. The hops character is melding nicely with the malt. The pine is subdued, but a mandarin orange sweetness comes forward (maybe the hops are simcoe). The toffee sweetness from the malt provides a nice finish. The mouth feel is dry, and slightly slick. Overall, a really nice beer. I should have bought another bomber.","carln26","Jul 02, 2006"

4.45,8.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"22 oz bomber. Pours a deep amber color with a finger and a half of solid light khaki head that falls to just under a finger of foam. Clarity is excellent and only a small carbonation bubbles up the sides of the glass. Very nice looking beer. Aroma is very nice. Initially, I get grapefruit and caramel, along with a very nice spicey rye mingling with those sweet smells. I like it. Flavor brings nice candies hop flavor, sweet caramel, spun sugar, backed with a mild rye spiceyness and a moderate bitterness that carries through very well, leaving me wanting more of the beer. Very nice. Mouthfeel is moderate with a moderate carbonation. It works well for the flavors that are present. Overall, I really do enjoy this one. This is probably the best beer from this brewery that I have tried. It drinks like a 5% ABV beer, the flavors are very full, and it's very enjoyable. With this being on tap at all the locals, I'll have a hard time visiting other beers. Good show.","kmpitz2","Jun 23, 2006"
