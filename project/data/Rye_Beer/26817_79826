4.21,9.4,4.25,4.5,4.25,3.75,4,"Overall, there were so many beautiful things about this beer.  From the look to the nose, it introduced itself and presented itself well.  The first whiff brought crashing imagery of Nugget Nectar to the forefront of our minds, although the flavoring showed much more bitterness from both the hops and the big rye grain inclusions.  The hops became frankly soapy, and when mixed and indistinguishable from the malts, gave a doubled bitter blend that was cleaner, but equally as robust as your west coast bitter hop bombs.  Very,very tasty.  The only negative thing about this one was its heavier feel and flow, but we suppose that is seasonally reasonable, and only minor given the wonderfully fresh ingredients, aroma, and taste.","TheBrewo","Jan 23, 2015"
