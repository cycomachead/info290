"This is a tasty little number! I've enjoyed it before, but I was working in my garage so I didn't give RPA the attention it deserves. This beer pours with a deep orange hue, a bit cloudy, with a finger of tan head. The nose is lovely - plenty of floral hops that give a nice hint of what is to come. The taste is everything that a quality brew should be - layered and ever evolving. The malt, rye, and hops blend together and each layer pops out at you as you taste it. This beer plays out like an IPA with a nice dry black pepper finish, and the rye adds a delightful twist. This is an awesome brew that is worth seeking out!"

"Too hoppy for my tastes."

"O: Been looking forward to having this proudly brewed Canadian classic for some time.   Really well done, no complaints here. You get both rye and IPA here.  Bought in Kitchener, drank in New Hamburg Aug 24th, 2014."
"Overall the transition from malts sweetness to hops bitterness is astounding, giving you equal opportunity to enjoy both the malt spectrum and hop spectrum of this beer."

"Strong beer, Good flavour, amazing aroma, could be filtered to avoid chunks in bottom. great canadian take on IPA. Would have been better to be slightly sweeter but the rye adds an amazing layer of depth and complexity to the beer. A good summer beer to remind you of warmth in those cold winter months"

"Overall: Damn good beer. While it's almost unfair to call this a rye beer because of how similar it is to an IPA, the rye is hard to deny. Would recommend to any beer lover and can't wait to buy some more!"
"I liked this so much I am going to brew my own RPA."
"I know that this is classified here as a rye beer, but c'mon - the IPA bitterness is so much more pronounced than the admittedly prominent rye malt bill ratio. Yer average rye beer is hardly as punchy as this one is, so the average consumer may get the wrong idea. At any rate, a pleasant cross-breeding of styles, glad to finally get a chance to try it, and with the minimal amount of effort, thanks be to Christian!"

"Overall - So I don't think I'll ever be a rye beer person, but I feel that this is a good representation of the style and illustrates some of the possibilities available especially when crossing with a hoppy pale ale. It was enjoyable and refreshing albeit an intense experience and would definitely pick up again if I were in the mood. Keeps getting better the farther you get into the glass. Definitely recommended for hop heads."

"OVERALL: This is excellent. The rye works wonders with the base caramel malts and the hop bill is spot on. A wonderful, full, creamy feel as well. Between this one and Sawdust's Lone Pine IPA, Ontario can easily satisfy my hop cravings without issue. World class beer right here, and I'm surprised the scores aren't even higher. Absolutely wonderful."

"Final Grade: 4.47, an incredible A grade. Worth the wait - Cameron's Rye Pale Ale is probably the best IPA I've had in the last year or so. The spicy, peppery feel imparted by the rye malts is the perfect companion for the intensely citrusy, earthy flavours of the hops, making for an excellent brew that is certain to please the palates of hopheads everywhere. This is easily the best Cameron's beer I've yet tried, and something that the brewers should be extremely proud of. If this is available regularly, you'd better believe I'll be buying plenty more, as this is definitely a new favourite for me. The perfect choice for my 500th beer tick on BA - and on International IPA Day, to boot!"

"Final Thoughts: This is my second Rye beer, and it certainly fared better then the first. That still being said, Rye beer does not appear to be my cup of tea. It's like an IPA with the hop kick spread out a bit more, and the sweet malt replaced with it's rougher rye cousin, which I would say is the best piece of advice I can give if you are drinking your first rye beer. Standard beer is toast, and this beer is rye bread toast. Regular toast tends to be sweeter the bread because the sugars in the bread caramelize. However Rye bread toast doesn't really do it quite as well, because, well I dunno, I guess there is less sugar/it's hardier? Either way, rye malt seems to have the same characteristic as there is next to nothing remotely sweet here, which makes for something different, it's just not quite what I'm looking for. Glad I tried it though."
""
"O - Wow! This is simply one of the best I've ever had. It sure goes down easy. It has a rye beer meets DIPA vibe to it. For some reason these haven't been moving off the shelve at my local LCBO. Next time I'm in I'll take care of that!"
"I'm somehow not catching all the nuance of this one, I guess. Mostly just hops to me, but still a good quality quaff."

"D - A solid, enjoyable, RyePA. I don't get a lot of the tropical and citrusy notes some of the other reviewers mention; wondering if there is variability to the hop bill. I'm fairly certain the bottles I've had are fresh."
"Overall - 4.25/5 Not sure if this is standard fare for the style, but if it is sign me up. Three cheers for rye beer!"

"O - big on rye spiciness which i prefer in the style, but maintains its drinkability, a very fine example of the style"
"O: I have wanted to try this for a while and I have to say that I am glad I did. I have to admit to not being a huge fan of RPA or IPA beers, but I want to give everything a fair chance. It was good. I would quite enjoy this with BBQ on a summer day."
"this ones a winner in my books, big tropical hop blast with a little spicy kick, no mention of booze anywhere and I could easily drink another bomber or two without getting board. I can see why this brews so well rated and I want to try more from this brewery, I can see why this popped up among Canada's best."

"Bottle: Poured a clear dark amber color ale with a relatively large foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of spicy malt notes with citrusy and spicy hops profile. Taste is a great refreshing mix between some spicy rye notes with some citrusy and spicy hops profile which are close to IPA level. Body is about average with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Solid beer which is definitely better then the rest of Cameron’s standard offerings."

"O/D - Slightly torn on this one. Without the rye element I typically don't enjoy, this would be a really solid pale ale for our market. It was really hyped up but I can't really see myself buying this again."
"O - I thoroughly enjoyed this brew. A hop bomb with a solid rye malt base that offered up a tasty twist to what could otherwise be interpreted as a generously hopped west coast IPA."
""
"Overall – Been wanting to try this one for a while, and it lived up to the hype. Amazing to find this much west coast flavour in an Ontario beer. It reminds me a bit of a Firestone Union Jack. With beers like this available locally it makes me wonder why I bother ticking random crappy beers."

"Very nice Rye Beer. A good amount of floral and citrusy hops mix flawlessly with the rye malts used. I highly recommend this beer."
"Cameron's Rye Pale Ale has enough bitter, aggressive hoppiness to be combat-operational but is not the kind of beer that eats its young. Layered with a remedying toasty malt, it has a collected, balanced disposition. Somewhere between English and American styles, this Canadian brewer found their own accent. Well crafted and reasonably priced, it's recommended."
""
"(4.25) D: This really surprised me and the freshness of this certainly came across. Won’t be hesitating to pick up more of this and glad to see Cameron’s experiments in the liquor stores. Highly recommend."
"Cheers!"
"Overall: This needs to be available year-round, preferably in the LCBO. Grab a sixer of this if you can."
""
"Definitely a beer I would highly recommend."
"Hoppy aroma of grapefruit, citrus, with a light grainy/earthy rye component too. Nicely pungent. Bitter hoppy flavors of grapefruit pith and peel, bready rye with a lingering earthy aftertaste, and dry hoppy bitterness. Medium to light body with an adequate carb level. Nice combo of citrus and rye, a session beer contender."
"Overall. A nice west coast style rye ipa. Enjoyed it."
"Man, this isnt something I`d expect out of Cameron`s in Ontario to produce. Quite frankly the best beer available right now, though I believe it`s intended to be a spring seasonal. The only downside was the pricing, over $16 for the six pack."

"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavors and aromas. Very impressed with this one, wasn't expecting it to be this great! Thanks alot TheSevenDuffs"
"O- I don't know what to say, this is marvelous. Just a solid beer that needs to be available all the time and in my area (preferably in the Cameron's 9pk)"
"Overall, very nice. I hope this becomes a regular because it is easily the best beer I have had from Cameron's and would be a huge addition to the Ontario beer scene."
"O - A great beer and one of Ontario's many bright spots lately. Well done!"
"Cloudy amber colour, nearly a finger of white head with some lace at the top of the glass. Smell is a blast of citrus and pine, big chunks of pineapple up front, some malt with a bit of a spicy rye kick, mango and grapefruit, lots of citrus and tropical fruit scents. Tasts is quite hoppy, citrus and tropical flavours, grapefruit, mango as well spicy malt, dry bitterness in the middle and finish, some more malt and spice in the aftertaste. Good feel, medium carboantion, lightly sweet points followed by nice drying carbonation, oily at points. This was a pleasure to have, defintley something I would drink again, very nice on tap."
"Thanks for hooking me up Jon."
"Overall - I am very impressed! I've never been impressed with anything that Cameron's has put out, until now!"
"Notice - alcohol is invisible here, this stuff creeps up on you faster than it should."
"Edit: Happy to re-review. Been drinking a lot of this on tap at The Only - great hop brightness, citrus character, balanced with a rye spiciness and a slight chewiness. Just a terrific beer and perhaps one of the best in Ontario for IPAs."
