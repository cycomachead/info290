"O: A refreshing beer, great for a post-hike cool down. Earthiness, spice, and lighter body paris great with Indian food!"

"Overall: A drinkable but easily forgettable pale whose bitterness borders on IPA. The flavors is lacking any complexity or any of the citrus that is pleasurable in the aroma."

"My server made the initial pour, so I was only a party to the Crack & Glug, rathe than being directly involved. It arrived with a finger of bone-white head with decent retention. Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Croesus, Midas and Mammon were all back in my kitchen, so I had this beer all to myself. Nose was both hoppy and spicy, grapefruit and pepper. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was really reminiscent of an AIPA with a great bitterness on the tongue. The finish evinced the black pepper of the rye, giving it a cool, almost minty, finish. Wow! The finish was very dry and since I still had a half of a CAN left, I went with an aggro pour to really release the esters and now the pepper took on a prevalence not initially experienced. Great stuff!"

"O: A pleasant Rye Pale Ale. Quite heavy on the hops, maybe to the exclusion of all other flavors."
"O-This is my first beer from Telluride Brewing and I am impressed. The smell, in particular, fits my idea of what a good rye pale ale should smell like; it is sharp and spicy, but not over-the-top bitter or astringent. The taste doesn't quite have the same intensity, but for a 5.5% brew, this packs a decent bit of flavor."
"Overall, a very nice rye pale, better than most rye hoppy beers I've had. Tons of bitterness that's slightly harsh."

"I dunno if they date their cans, but this one just didn't have anything going for it aside from the malt. I'll drink a stout or porter if I want something this malt forward. I could tell it was hopped, the bitterness was apparent, but the flavor was just muddled and didn't go anywhere beyond the rye and the barley maltiness."

"O- Awesome beer, a killer rye pale that has enough rye to be obvious and enough bitterness to be a pale. I like this beer because I've not had a rye beer this light in color before and...it's great! It's all in the balance."
"Pours a nice dark amber with a thin white head that settles to a patchy haze. Aromas of rye malt, caramel, and citrusy hops. Pretty nice so far. More rye and moderately sweet caramel malt, along with some grapefruit and resin hops. Very drinkable and quenching, with a medium mouthfeel and solid carbonation. Enjoyable brew, very drinkable."

"A pretty good tasting pale, I recommend giving it a try."

"I hope this brew makes it's way up to Denver...Telluride is a hell of a drive... Recommended, awesome after hiking."
""
"O: interesting combination of very light malt, rye, and pine-like hops. This does it well, giving it a feeling that I would be happy to take with me on a backpacking trip, especially in these nice cans."

"very well balanced rye brew. pours a less than perfectly clear golden color with a smallish white head. smells a bit like rye malts, but also like english malts and a fairly aggressive hopping. flavor is less hoppy than a standard american pale, but everything is in excellent proportion. hop profile is fruity to grassy, while the malt is like a dark rye bread, only mildly spicy but quite bold. feel is good too, very refreshing with a medium body, good carbonation, and a light crisp finish. first beer from telluride was a winner."
""
"Overall - This is super refreshing washing over your palate as it has the nice floral citrus notes along with a great spicy and bitter finish without a lot of sweetness or alcohol to weigh things down. I really enjoyed this beer and feel its a perfect bring along for any outdoor adventures in Colorado (or elsewhere). Looking at the falls on the can makes me want to take a trip out to Telluride to see it myself- and also maybe stop in at the brewery for a pint or three! Well done on your first canned brew guys! Cheers!"
