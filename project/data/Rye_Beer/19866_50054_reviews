"O: This is a very uneven beer. It has some good characteristics, but ultimately falls short."
""
""
"Pours a murky dark reddish brown with billowing dense khaki colored head. Thick sheet of lace down the glass until the end. Smell: raisin bread, dates, baking spices. Taste: raisin, caramel, soft graininess, moderately spicy, unripe but not tart plum. Medium plus bodied, finished drying and mildly sweet with lingering earthiness. Nice!"

"Overall: this beer really appeals to me. I'm very glad I've discovered it."

"A real neat drink, but unfortunately seems like it's a little haphazard in its delivery overall."
"a very rye heavy saison that also happens to be brutally hopped and dark red in color with an inch or so of lasting white head with fine ring lacing as it drinks down. the nose here is spicy from the rye, rich from the darker roast on it, and drying weirdly. i get some caramel malt sweetness in there too though, and finally a huge blast of hops from the pine family with plenty of bitterness. the flavor is a lot like the nose, the rye is dominant and aggressive, almost clumsily so, overcoming whatever interesting saison yeast might be in this beer, its a straight up rye bomb. lots of hops too, which is strange in a saison like this. i don't taste red malt but i can feel its sweetness trying to fight the bitter of the hops, but it can't contend. the is a robustly flavored brew that could perhaps be toned down a bit, especially for it to show any signs of being a saison. apparently upright does open fermentation, which is cool of course, but ti does very little for this overzealous brew. fuller bodied, spicy, and bitter, a strange swallow and mouthfeel. bubbly enough. i respect it, but i won't buy it again."

"Poured from bottle into D'Achouffe tulip. Pour is deep brown with massive creamy tan head. This looks so amazing. Aromas of fig and dried fruit with a nice rye spice and hop. Flavors of dried fruit and chocolate, figgy, and raison like. Nice hop spice. Really dry yet creamy...super drinkable and well balanced, a near perfect mouthfeel for a saison. Awesome brew."

"Dark brown/burgundy ale with a thick & sudsy white head. Heavy cherry aroma along with some hints of smoke and spice. Thick mouth feel, crisp and dry finish after a sweet explosion of flavor--cherries, cinnamon, vanilla, smoke, spice. Ridiculously easy-drinking for such a complex beer. Finishes acidic, not sour but noticeably tart. I order this every time I can, at the brewery or elsewhere around town, and it never gets old. Amazing with almost any food, especially fatty meats / burgers. One of those beers that is just as good on a snowy day as it is on 80f and sunny days. Spectacular and I hope Upright brews another batch with cherries added soon..."

"Overall: A very interesting beer, but tamarind is not something I would want as the dominant flavor in my beer; glad I tried it but doubt I would re-visit"

"Pours jet black with nice tan head. More complex than I remember from previous tastes. Chocolate, toasted malt, and slight tartness are in the forefront, but are followed by a long, dry aftertaste that is reminiscent of match heads and sulfur- oddly enough, this is not unpleasant. Complex, many flavor notes, but the mineral aftertaste is perhaps the most distinctive. Hop bitterness is noticeable underneath rich flavors of dark fruits, coffee and caramel. So much going on here."
"A pleasant enough rye-tinted saison, the heady caramel maltiness sort of cutting through the middle, with the proclaimed titular yeast and spicy grain falling by the wayside, once they've spent their load. More saison chicanery from this Portland upstart, which, while interesting, is starting to mess with my impression of the style - I'm ready for something else now, methinks."

"Pours with a big, fluffy head of white foam on top of a hazy, golden body. The head settles slowly and leaves excellent lace. A spicy, peppery aroma with a touch of clove and coriander. Some grainy malt and spicy yeast with pepper and clove. Medium body, moderate carbonation, and a Fairly sweet finish. Not my favorite example of the style. The yeast character is unpleasant and there really isn't anything else going on. Overly sweet."
""
"Pretty good beer, but I must confess and be completely honest - I'm not the biggest fan of rye beer that's ever lived, so my expectations for this beer weren't too high to begin with. Still surprisingly easy to drink when you consider the relative amount of rye that makes up the flavor profile. I'll be excited to soon try the rest of this Upright series (that is, Four, Five, and Seven)."

"750 ml bottle. Served in a Unibroue tulip, the beer pours a burnt orange/brown color with a couple inch light tan head that actually kept growing slowly for a few minutes after the initial pour. It took a while for the head to settle down before I could start drinking it. There's also a lot of lacing. Aroma is yeasty and fruity, it smells like pears, rye/dark bread, herbs, cloves, and apples. The brew tastes like dark bread/rye, pears, apples, cloves, caramel malt, and some dark fruit. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and is well carbonated. The carbonation is soft which helps make it easy to drink. I liked this, and I wouldn't mind trying it again in the future. $11.99 a bottle."

"Reminds me of Jester King's Commercial Suicide but stronger."

"Bottle: Poured a dark dirty brown color ale with a generous head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of caramel malt with light spicy notes and some herbal notes are also discernable. Taste is also dominated by caramel malt with light chocolate presence, some spicy notes probably originating from the rye with some herbal notes and dry at the end. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Somewhat dryer then I was expecting with quite a bit of complexity."

"O: Overall this is a tasty beer. Different perhaps from what I had expected but very good and worth a try."
""
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. Overall not bad but pales a bit in comparison to the other upright offeringd I have enjoyed so much. This has potential, I am just not completely sold on this particular batch/bottle I opened."

"This is pretty good, but I wish the hops were toned down a tad to better allow the malt to take a more dominant placement; there are a lot of nice malts here, and they work well with each other, but the hops easily overpower those subtleties. This is likely my Midwest bias. For a bier from the West Coast, this is surprisingly balanced."

"O: very interesting beer all around and was pretty tasty as well"
"Overall: I was really impressed by Upright’s #VI, I was surprised by all of the flavors throughout and by the overall complexity. I expected this to a light sessional saison with some rye and it ended up being a dark, robust, and complex rye beer with saison and porter-like qualities together. I am able to get the three other saisons from Upright, and I can’t wait to purchase them and try them as well. I decided to start on #VI because I’ve feeling a nice rye beer ever since fall came around. This was right up my alley and I will definitely be getting this again in the future."
"Overall, surprisingly good. Is it a rye beer? Is it a saison? I don't care. It's delicious."
""
""
""
"Overall - The worst Upright I've had. Maybe it's an old bottle, but there's not bottle date on it. Not pleasant and where's the rye?"
""
""

"3.5 D: It's hard to pick one between Five and Six as which one I like better. They are both tasty, but they are fully different. This has some good flavors, but is missing something in the taste. Worth a try, but probably not another buy."
"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours very hazy dark reddish brown color with a nice 2-3 finger fluffy khaki head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice thick foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of caramel, mango, cherry, biscuit, toffee, molasses, orange zest, pineapple, toast, and rye spiciness. Very nice and unique aromas with good balance, complexity, and strength. Taste of caramel, toast, molasses, biscuit, pepper, pineapple, chocolate, clove, earth, cherry, citrus, and rye spiciness. Light spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, molasses, cherry, chocolate, pepper, earth, toast, and rye spiciness on the finish for a bit. Great balance of flavors with nice complexity; fairly dry on the finish. High carbonation and medium body; with a fairly crisp, slick, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent rye saison! Great flavor complexity and balance; and very smooth a crisp to sip on. A very unique and enjoyable offering. Very well done."
"Pours a clear dark amber with a foamy tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, rye, caramel, and some slight herbal hop aromas. Taste is much the same with a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is drinkable but smells better than it tastes in my opinion."
"Hmmm. A rye beer? This doesn't really strike me as such, in an American sense of the definition. The first thing I thought when looking at it and catching the fragrance was it seems like a dark Belgian ale. Upon tasting it, I'd have to say it seems to follow that suit. I'll judge this one on the quality of the beer, but as a rye, it falls short to me. Still very nice to drink."
"O: An interesting beer but I didn't really care for it. The dark sour flavors in the finish were a bit off-putting."
"O: A nice, interesting beer. Fairly complex with a range of flavors."
"Overall: The rye is big in this saison, but it almost overtakes the saison. It was still pretty enjoyable beer by upright?"
"Very drinkable beer right here. Worth seeking out if you think a rye saison sounds tasty. Thanks 4DAloveofSTOUT!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O- The nice hop flavors are soft but they don't have a lot of support from other flavors and I don't get any saison yeast character. It is not offensive in any way just a bit drab. Especially compared to the bottle description."
""
""
""
"Interesting and quite enjoyable."
"Brown body under a light tan head in my Hair of the Dog tulip. Smell is of rye, caramel, touch of spice. The different smells blend together nicely and create a pleasant aroma. In the taste I first detect sweet malts and a touch of fruit sweetness. I later get notes of rye spiciness, chocolate, a slight sourness/funk. It finishes with a bit of lingering roasty/chocolate flavor and a nice sweetness. The flavor profile is very smooth with a bit of funk for a saison lover like me. This would make for a great wintertime beer for someone who isn't necessarily into porters/stouts."
"Brown...dark amber...lingering amber head. Big malty aroma, but there's some oxidation. Flavorful, malt, light fruit, watery, uh...not the best. I'm guessing this may taste different at the brewery fresh on tap...decent and I can find intrigue, but not something I could do more than a pint of without finding fatigue. Still ... tasty and fun!"

"A tasty, interesting, rye saison, though the overbearing fruit sweetness doesn't make for a very drinkable beer."
""

"I liked it. Drank the whole 750ml bottle without any problems."
""
"An adequate but undistinguished rye ale. Pours a cloudy brown with a great big head. The aroma is a bit chalky, with wheat and rye notes. The flavor is malty but with a big wheaty bite and a very dry rye finish, rather chalky in the end. The mouthfeel is astringent and dry."
""
"Overall I'm not digging this, but it's not terrible either."
""
""
"Huge complexity on this one that doesn't quite mesh together; oddly less than the sum of its parts. Lots of goodness in here, though. Good beer."
"Flavorful, well crafted, yet relatively simple (if not rustic) in many ways. Something of a thirst quencher despite being fairly dark."
"D/O: This beer has plentiful complexity as well as appeal, combining varied elements of dark malt, rye, and wild ale yeast qualities. Musty wood and sugar impurities outmaneuver simplistic cider in a pro-rustic campaign, leaping well over any assumptions or expectations one might bring with them. This is a beer for the jaded palate."
"Overall, a rich, flavorful and interesting brew. Extremely tart and woody. Very nice."
"Pretty interesting beer overall"
"This beer was consumed after a minor seal break and over a couple days. The initial beer was served cold with lots of carbonation and allowed to warm. The flavours and aromas evolved but never disappointed. The next day after deciding to try to finish the bottle, which we used a wine pump on, the beer was flat but still good. Lacking in carbonation we felt it more like a wine than a beer. Good sh*t. Get it and see for your selves."

"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. A nice focus on the rye without overdoing it which is important. It is definitely rye dominant for sure, so if you aren't a fan of rye beers, this won't be for you, but as a fan of rye I thoroughly enjoyed it. Reminds me of a lighter version of the Bruery's Rugbrood, which is the staple for Rye beers in my opinion, so this beer is in the top echelon for me for the style."
"I don't know what it is, but there's something wrong about this to me. It really doesn't have a lot of pleasant characters, as it should. The characters it has are thin, weedy and not fully-fledged. I can't say I'm a fan."
"Overall: A very pleasant beer. I love the rye notes mixed with the saison yeast."
"overall: good but somewhat dissapointing"
"O: Great drinking beer, has nice complexity but doesn't over power the taste buds. The combination of rye and fruit tartness is nice."
"Feel is solid - medium bodied, somewhat creamy, yet also prickly from the carbonation."
"Drink- A nicely balanced rye beer. I am beginning to want to get my hands on a lot of rye and this was a great beer to have around the house. Big bottle, big flavors and a good abv level."
"o - Overall a good rye beer. The nose was a little too spicey and the rye dominates, but I enjoyed it. Would try it again."
" worth a try, as it isn't something you come across from other breweries."
"Overall a very solid rye ale that is quality yet drinkable. Bravo!"
"Pretty good, but too much focus on the rye and not enough on the yeast."
"A solid rye beer with a great aroma. The flavour doesn't stand up quite as well but this thing is thoroughly drinkable."
"This is a very nice beer; I really enjoy this interpretive Saison from upright, the rye and the darker malt character really takes this in a great direction. It may not be a unique direction, but it is certainly well executed and quite tasty in the glass. Even though I have liked this from the beginning, it is still growing on me more as it warms up and I work my way through this beer. This is definitely my favorite upright beer of the few I have tried so far."
"Not bad at all. A lot of rye beers I try are IPA style, so this was a real nice switch. Big thumbs up on the Six."
"(D)- Definitely a unique take on the style with some definite Saison characteristics poking through the rye. Not sure if this is for the better, but I enjoyed the experience nonetheless."
"Overall I wasn't expecting too much from this as rye beers are not my favorite, but this was nice for the style. Flavorful and nice to partake on a hot sunny afternoon. Good enough to make me want to try the other's from Upright."
"Overall I liked this one. I really enjoyed the tartness of it which reminded me of a sour in a lot of ways. It was enjoyable to drink and I would do so again."
"Lots of stuff going on with this one. Wouldn't exactly call it balanced, but it was really tasty!"
"T: I get a hint of the rye upfront with a hint of citrus. Then a bit of tartness that reminds me of underripe apricots and cherries on the finish. A bit of malt in the finish as well. This was pretty well done and unlike any beer I've tried before."
"O. One of my favorite offerings from Upright. Definitely their best of the # series. I will never miss a chance to grab a bottle of this. No problem tearing a whole 750ml bottle apart myself. Great stuff!"
"D: This is a good beer, won't be one of my regulars but I'm glad I tried it."
"Poured a murky deep roasted chesnut brown with a fizzy-like beige colored head.big sour cherry-like aromas,sherry vinegar and some wood come thru as well.I gotta admit I was looking for caramel and milk chocolate on the palate,they are both there but far underneath the sherry vinegar tart flavors.The mouthfeel is a bit sharp and fizzy,its full on tart and thats ok for what it is,I personally would have liked more complexity to the beer."
"Tasty, spicy, and chocolatey with a nice balance of sweet and dry."
"Upright makes a lot of sours and odd ducks, so they probably have plenty of strange yeast and bacteria floating around. I just wish they'd say if they intended to include brettanomyces or if it's just an afterthought. Otherwise I have to wonder if this is on its way to being spoiled. Has some interest, and lovely to look at, but I find it virtually undrinkable."
"Overall this beer is very good, easy drinking, complex and balanced. Another great beer from Upright."
"Verdict: Good, closing in on great beer that's just a tad too expensive. Worth trying..."
"Better than expected working through the private imports,Bottle at Volo. Way overcarbonated which we handled by creating an exeptional head.Dark coloured body yielding a taste fruity, lemoney, peppery, chocolate, some rye. Caramel, decent malting. easy drinking, average mouthfeel."
"Cheers!"
"D: I drank a 750mL and enjoyed it over two hours including with a meal and I wish I would have had more."
"nice bitter aftertaste. This one is a great offering and a nice slow drinker. Try one."
"D: There is a lot of potential here but the grain bill isn't really able to distinguish itself. A great sipper and an interesting use of saison yeast."
"Pours a rich brown colour that show mahogany in the light. Fluffy off white head, good lacing on the glass. Smells of faint alcohol, spicy rye, rich malty presence. There is almost too much going on in the nose so some things are conflicting here. The taste is sour upfront, some funky presence, malt comes back in bringing spicy notes, cherry, and some dark chocolate show up as well. Mouthfeel is thin to medium but perfect, good carbonation, holds itself well. This drinks almost like a good wine, outstanding stuff here. This was very unique to me I have never had a sour rye beer, great intro to it though."
"Very fine beer. My first ""Rye Beer"". Unlike anything I've ever had so far and quite good. Balanced, tasty and refreshing."
"An extremely interesting and unique offering from Upright. I don't think it would be a regular go to for me, but certainly a fun one to try. More than happy to drink it again."
"*emphasis on local, organic sourcing."
"Pours a cloudy dark amberish brown color with a massive foamy light tan head that takes forever to dissipate and leaves thick patchy clumps of lacing. Pleasant mild aroma of spice, fruit, yeasty esters, smoke, bread, etc. As the beer warms the aroma takes a turn for more smoke and spicy bread. Wow, the flavor is a fun, unique trip melding a funky french style saison with a dark, malty rye ale. The front of the palate is coated by dark fruits and chocolately malt while the back is gripped by funk and yeast with spicy rye bread notes. Medium thick with light carbonation producing a creamy smooth body with a mild alcohol burn in the finish. A very enjoyable, unique rye beer whose weakest point is its mouthfeel; highly recommended, I'll be seeking more out."
"D: Very good. Shared with my wife but could have consumed this one solo rather easily."
"Over all this was a bit different from what I was expecting from a rye beer, as I feel it really had quite dominating saison characteristics, with the addition of some richer malt and rye notes to accentuate the flavors. I really enjoyed this beer as it was a slight change of pace without having to analyze an entirely foreign style of beer."
"D: Another nice saison from Upright. The addition of rye in this one added a nice complexity to the beer."
"The beer pours a dark, brownish-red color with a tan head. The aroma is dark fruit, dark malts and rye. The flavor is wheat, pepper, candi sugar and rye. I don't get the same fruit characters in the flavor as I got in the aroma. High carbonation and medium mouthfeel."
"Drinkability is great. A very tasty beer that washed down food well and stood on it's own too."
"- A great drink, and a nice change from the normal. Recommended."
"Bottle opened with a bit of gun-smoke, pour resulted in a large Duvel-like rocky head, slow dissipation with significant lacing. Black opaque body with tan head. The house yeast is pretty prevalent in the nose, caramel malts, floral hops. The rye is very nuanced, taste is of raisins, light brown sugar, a bit of spice, with a dab of funk. Nicely carbonated mouthfeel with a sweet, dry finish. Not a heavy beer, but one shared bottle is enough for one night, not really a sessionable style. Besides the visual characteristics, I though the bottle version had more character, probably due to bottle conditioning. I'm curious how this would cellar. Worth picking up a bottle just to look at-the complex taste is a bonus!"
"D- I could easily go for another bottle right now. The 6.7% does rear its head, but never bites. An interesting beer, from an interesting brewer. I can't wait for more."
"D: Have had this on a number of occasions and, since it's an Upright staple, will certainly have it many more times. Pairs wonderfully with meat and smokier dishes, drinks well on it's own..even pairs superbly with a peaty aged scotch (first-hand experience). A beautiful beer, one I heartily recommend."
"Still, I really enjoyed the buoyant, quaffable body and found the beer refreshing in an informal sense. It's exotic enough to inspire intrigue, yet informal enough for casual appreciation."
"I had three glasses of this at the brewery, poured by Alex himself, reviewed from notes on my phone, served in an old GABF flute glass, color is a mix between a dark orange and a copper hue, big 1 1/2 inch off white creamy head that stuck around a few minutes, lacing towards the top, aroma was full of rye and the best smelling beer of this style I have ever come across, also had esters, toasted malts, spices, yeast, mild sweetness and candied sugars, grassy accents, light hops, and grains, flavor starts off with rye, some malt that is both toasted and sweet in the middle, finish has more rye to go along with some nice floral hops, a bit of grass and lemon lingering the aftertaste as well, very balanced between the malts and hops, chewy, malty, and dry mouthfeel, medium bodied, high level of carbonation, taste lingers forever, very easy to drink with no alcohol at all in the flavor, balanced and smooth, refreshing and the prickly carbonation makes it go down even easier, this was one of my favorite beers of the whole trip and the best from Upright, it is my buddy Drake's favorite hands down, he is still talking about almost a month later, highly recommended"
"Pours a murky deep copper that has bright edging and a frothy khaki colored head that never really disappears and leaves a thick head on this beer. The aroma is spicy and has yeast esters and some toasted malts. The flavor is sweet malt, candi sugars and some grassy hops. The bodied is light to medium and is almost fluffy with plenty of carbonation. This is a very easy to drink beer. I could enjoy a few of these in one sitting."
