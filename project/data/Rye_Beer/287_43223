Faint smell of pine and hop. Tastes of pine, resin, with tiny bit of fruit, a little watery at the front but with a citrus hoppy finish. Mouthfeel is pleasant, sticky. The relative thinness of taste might fool you into thinking this is a session ale, save for the tacky, slightly boozy aftertaste that lingers. It took a couple sips for me to get into this, and I still don't love it. I always have such high hopes for anything from Bell's so I was eager to try this. For this ABV, I think I'd rather something a little more complex or flavorful. Maybe I just do not appreciate this style.","lipster","Mar 27, 2015"

It has a nice golden color to it and you can smell that rye flavor. Oddly, though, the aftertaste is more enjoyable than the taste of the beer itself. That's not to say it tastes bad, but it leaves me wanting an IPA. Again, though, the aftertaste is good so I enjoyed the beer overall.","chopp02","Mar 25, 2015"

I smell earthy rye and a bit of citrus hops in the background.  The flavor is a blend of bitter citrus hops and earthy rye, but the hops dominate until after the fade.

3.35,-8.5,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.25,"Pours from the growler in to an IPA glass with a light golden hue and just a kiss of red rye. The minimal white head settles quickly in to a thin collar, while the transparent liquid shows just a touch of chilled haze. The aroma yields bready pale malts and hops of the earthy variety. Only moderately aromatic, with just traces of rye discernible. The taste follows the nose. Mildly flavored and balanced, with a slightly drying finish. A bit of peppery spice from the rye and a lingering mild hop bitterness leave a lasting impression. A spritzy, lively carbonation helps give the impression of a fuller body, though it's mostly an illusion, and a good one. Overall, this is a pretty standard affair, and it makes me yearn for something more potent and flavorful, like a Ruthless Rye. When a pale ale takes on the same basic profile of an IPA, but tames all of the desirable characteristics down, it simply leaves me unsatisfied. It's not easy enough to be a session beer, and not bold enough to stand out. Perhaps a good bridge to better things if you're trying to ease in to the craft world.","JohnnyI","Mar 01, 2015"

The hop bitterness is not overwhelming and the aftertaste is clean with just a touch of lingering bitterness that fades quickly.  The presence of rye is not obvious in this beer. Overall this is an extremely drinkable beer.","kickbundler","Feb 13, 2015"

Mild smell, some hops and malt nothing overwhelming. Tastes good to me, malty and bitter but sweet as well. Some caramel notes for sure and definitely a little bite on the back end. Some hints of rye in there but not a ton. Mouthfeel is solid but doesn't stick around very long. Overall a nice beer probably would have been better if it was fresh or on draft but I got this with a case being clearanced at $20 per so I cannot complain.

3.56,-2.7,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pure white foam head, tightly woven microfoam, semi-aggressive pour yields a little over a finger, retention is okay, the lacing streaks are meager but long, average stick. Filmy golden colored liquid, lots of fine particulate floating throughout, semi-opaque as a result, few visible bubbles. Very grainy nose featuring spicy rye notes, black pepper, orange and grapefruit rinds, once you get past the initial burst there’s underlying sweetness found in honey notes and peach, apricot fruit accents, light touch of mineral water and cigar ash before it floats off. Medium-bodied, the carbonation charges right out of the gate, gets things churning. On the dry side even as the rye is not over the top, hoppy with no lack of leafiness even if it’s the grains which take precedence. Stronger citrus presence here, lemon to orange. As in the nose, the apricot, peach, yellow apple fruit holds off before showing. The finish is filled with earthy, metallic notes, creates added bitterness. That said, balanced on the whole, drinking well chilled helps. You can tell it is well crafted, however, it also has a sort of lowbrow “throwback” feel and taste to it.","farrago","0"

3.23,-11.7,3.5,4.25,2.75,3.5,2.75,"I really like Bell's in general. I have had a few rye beers and none of them have done it for me, I thought if any brewery could do it Bell's could. Maybe my taste buds were off tonight, but this is an odd beer. It smells great, similar to an IPA or pale ale. It looks great, and in the beginning it tastes good, then that spicy bitterness hits and it lingers on the back of my tongue in a bad way. Its a very strong bitterness that I could not shake. I thought maybe it was me, I drank some water ate a few pretzels then tried again, same result. It tastes very nice on the front of my tongue but as it passes over the rest of my mouth it clings in a rather unpleasant way to the back. It gives off a strange alkaline flavor that I just cannot get past. I will have to say this is not my favorite by Bell's. I will place it in the same category as Oberon another grain that I don't enjoy in my beers, wheat! Oddly enough the other rye beers I had tried in the past did remind me of wheat beers, and is why I did not enjoy them, but now I have found another reason not to like them. I am giving this one higher marks than I should and on paper it looks better than it is, but the smell is nice, I will have to give Bell's that. Anyway, I will keep trying on occasion, but this one does fall short. I do find this odd because I generally like rye whisky and I also like wheated bourbons. But as far as beers go, neither wheat nor rye work for I.","humuloner22","Feb 15, 2014"

This ale pours a hazy beautiful golden amber color with a thick frothy white head that lasts throughout the pour. There is a significant amount of lacing for such a light bodied ale. The nose is very subtle with fresh flavors of rye and a little yeast. Almost smells more European than American in nature. The flavor is light and subtle as well. Slightly bitter and sweet at the same time with definite notes of yeast and rye. It is very light and easy sipping. By far not my favorite offering from Bell's or my favorite rye ale but none the less a very enjoyable ale that could be sessioned all day or just enjoyed as a refreshing quaff after work.","lochef81","Beers"

The beer is labeled as a Golden Rye Ale, but the short description states that it is an "interesting take on the American Pale Ale." Based on the overall flavor of the beer, I'd concur that this is an interesting take on american pale ale, and that the Rye while part of the ingredient list is part of the flavoring rather than the primary grain. The 6.00% abv makes this a very drinkable beer.","Badger6","Dec 24, 2013"

3.57,-2.5,3.75,3,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Overall, the best thing about this beer is its flavor, coupled with its ease of drinkability. The rye really flourishes with warmth, adding to the depth of the grain bill, while lightening up any inherent bitterness of hops that may have escaped the final blend. This is nice, as it adds a robustness to the main bulk of both the nose and the tongue. This does, however, seem like more of a commercial pull, with enough lightness to appeal to the masses. That said, we ended up very much appreciating that aspect of it, as it made it wonderfully drinkable, especially when coupled with the soft and creamy drag to each sip. Although well known within the stage, this is one of Bell’s sleepers, and definitely something we feel would appeal to many beer appreciators.","TheBrewo","0"

I easily had two fingers of French Vanilla-colored head with not only great retention, but as it fell, it was creating great lacing in its wake. Color was a cloudy orangish-yellow, like freshly squeezed grapefruit juice. The nose was to die for! It had the black pepper of the rye along with a very earthy scent, like digging in the garden. Mouthfeel was medium and the black pepper flavor was immediately evident on the tongue. It combined nicely with the grapefruit flavor of the hops. This is an APA?!? Wow!

Aroma heavy hitting with floral citrus based hops, underlying hints of spicy rye malts with signature Bell's house yeast strain glowing through like your favorite artisanal crusted bread. The nose hits with orange marmalade like notes heavy on the peel, glazed with sweetness from the malts and balanced with the rye sharpness. Flavor is melding well, heavy bitterness with minimal crashing waves of alcohol seeping through this beer is sending out a lovely message, refreshment with hop bitterness. Someone had to do it I'm glad it's a great company like Bell's, I'm going to quit trying to act like somebody else and just enjoy what's good and not what's popular. I don't see this beer getting raved about, let me start the bandwagon, it's fuckin' good simply pleasurable well crafted American pale ale. The more I taste and smell this beer I'm getting limoncello with spiced rye grains bleeding through the alcohol, not nearly as strong but the same presence. Mouthfeel is creamy textured with hints of nuttiness on the sides of my palate, ample flowing carbonation this beer is smooth but still has that lingering rough hop oil bitterness that most "normal" beer drinkers don't care for, however I'm a "hophead" and I wouldn't expect anything less. Overall high quality well thought out beer, that I'm pleasured to sample a bottle of keep 'em coming good stuff from our friends up in Michigan.","WVbeergeek","Apr 18, 2013"

This beer had ok drinkability, it was fairly smooth and the flavors held my attention, but it was a little filling so I think two would be enough for me, but I might be inclined to drink a few of these on a nice warm spring day. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and aroma, they were both good and pretty true to style. What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was decent, but it was a little to thick and too filling for my liking. I would buy this beer again when it gets warmer, it seems like it would be a nice and refreshing warm weather beer, I would recommend this to people who like rye beers. All in all I was satisfied with this beer, but I think it would be more fitting if they released this beer in the late spring/ early summer, it just seems like this beer would be good for that time of the year. This is a nice rye beer but I think I would rather have a Founders Reds Rye or any of the Short's Rye beers instead, but this one wasn't bad by any means.

Perhaps it's the rye I am into. Otherwise I'd love to know which bittering hops were included. The substantial body (for a "pale ale") seems to help keep that flavor lingering long enough that I can really relax into it. In contrast, some very tastey beers have fleeting flavors that I would rather hold onto longer.

The head stays around a long time, and there's also a good amount of lacing. The brew smells like bready/grainy malt, rye, citrusy hops, and some grassy hops. The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also the addition of some light peppery spice. There's a nice bittersweet finish in this brew. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit creamy, but also refreshing with good carbonation. Would be a great beer on a hot day, but it's still good on a 25 degree day, too.
