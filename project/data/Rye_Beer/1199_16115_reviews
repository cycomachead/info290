review_text
"O: [3.25] This is a great beer with a flaw. There is an off taste and smell that keep this from really knocking it out of the park.  I'd be tempted to buy another one of these and see if it was a bad beer.  I enjoy Founders brews but I have to rate what is in front of me.  That being said I have to knock some points off this one for the ""chlorine"" smell/taste."

"Solid roasty flavors with a touch of spice from the rye.  Love the black color."

"Solid beer w good hop taste not a porter but a good lager type dark beer. Smooth finish."
"Deep black. Great smell of hops and dough. Taste is more of the same with creamy body. Perfect balance of hops and rye malt - not trying to kill you with hops or rye or roasted notes like a lot of beers in this category. Great overall beer and something I hope to see again."
"D: This was like a black IPA with extra rye added. Nice balance in the scent and taste, although the body was a little weak. The finish was fairly smooth, so it was pretty easy to drink. Nothing ground breaking, but a unique, high quality brew."
""
""
""
"Again, Founder's calls this a ""hopped dark ale brewed with rye"" and I think it tastes like a stout with rye. It is similar to their Breakfast Stout with less of everything but hops."
""
"O - Black Rye is down right awesome! There's just something about black ales (ipa) brewed with rye that do me in. It just goes well and makes it a brew I can enjoy any time. I didn't get to try this back the first go round, but I'm glad they released it. I'm hoping this is one that will be around for years to come. One of the best black ales I've ever had."

"Basically and excellent porter with a peppery like spicyness. Not very hoppy or bitter at all. Very nice beer"

"Black Rye is a beautiful opaque obsidian shade, and a stubborn antique white head encircles the perimeter of the glass after the initial pour. Quite a bit of lacing is left artfully behind. A lively woodsy aroma comes off the brew, with bitter citrus, oak smoke, whiskey grains, burnt toast, and a touch of brown sugar as well. I am loving this! First of all I must say that this is very soft and smooth, and lighter-bodied than expected, however, there is a bit of a warming sensation following a good gulp. The hops are in the foreground, and they present themselves in a nicely dry and bitter way. I'd say these are almost herbally pungent, in essence. The roast and rye serve to compliment the hops with subtle grace. I would strongly recommend this to any person who likes to explore the complexities of hop bitterness in a unique way."

"Overall - fantastic beer"
""
""

"Bottled in dec. Pours a very dark. Nice quarter inch head. Alot of chocolate on the smell same with taste. Back end is where the rye comes in. A ton going on in this beer and i love it."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is surprisingly effervescent. Overall, pretty good beer."
""
""
"This is the best Rye beer I have ever had thus far. The taste of this beer is phenomenal!"
""
""
"O - 4.25 - This is an excellent representation of the rye beer style. This works as a slow sipper, but would be even better paired up with some barbecue or other smoked meats. Having mine with a smokey, chopped beef barbecue sandwich!"
""
""
""
""
"4.00/5.00"
""
"Very unique taste. One could mistake this for a hopped-up Imperial Stout. Great slow-sipper."
""
""
"Tastes interesting. Not bad. The rye comes out and stays in palate. Dry hops adds some bitterness, smell."

"O: This showcases the rye quite nicely and the hop profile is complementary. Recommended"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is is definitely an interesting twist on a black ale, but does it work? Id say so. I enjoy the smokey malt flavor upfront with the rye hop finish, but somethings missing to make it truly great and i cant pinpoint it yet. I think id prefer less bitterness on the backend. Very interesting though"

"Black pour with thin brown head. Sweet and toasted aromas. Taste some nice hop bitterness up front, with some smoked, coffee notes in a relatively clean finish."

"black beer with hops, roasty malt and rye"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Founder's gets an A for uniqueness - I've never had anything resembling the brew. Only some of the hoppier porters come close but they have a different hops profile and lack the rye flavor of this beer. It all blends remarkably well and makes for an enjoyable drinking experience. I think this works nicely with food - I had it with a bowl of chili. If I have a complaint it is simply the price, but in return you get a quality brew."
""
""
""

"A roller coaster beer ride of flavors that work very well together with nice balance and smooth almost slick feel. The carbonation was a little lighter than average, the bitterness was slightly above average and the finish was different after every sip. A really enjoyable beer that is very different and hides the ABV completely while remaining quite easy to drink. The rye is present in every aspect of this brew and makes for a wonderful leading role."
"O - Very nicely layered, balanced taste, especially for a black IPA."
""
""
""
"O - Grabbed a single (which I wont do again based on the price), but will defintiely be looking for it next year to see if I can pick it up when its fresher.  Fans of black IPAs will enjoy this one."
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours an opaque and deeply dark black with a tan colored head that maintains its size. Nice sticky lacing too. Smells of pine and spicey from the rye. A hint of roast and chocolate.  They rye is even more prominent once sipping. Very strong rye flavors and a good firm bitter finish. Hints of roast flavors behind the rye spiciness. Very enjoyable and interesting beer. Mouthfeel is on the heavier side of medium. Well done."
""
"Definitely some pros and cons to this experience. I think the balance of the aromas and flavor is quite nice. At time the body feels somewhat thin to support what is going on. A solid hoppy dark ale with charred, chocolate grains and bright hops."
""
""
"black in color, off white head, decent head retention.  nice aroma of a well rounded hop aroma paired with just a little toasty malt flavor.  taste is hop dominated."
""
""
"Moderately black in color and impenetrable to light.  A fingernail of khaki colored head is present.  Brussels lacing.   The nose brings dark malt,earthy rye notes, and chocolate.  The flavor is as advertised in the nose with the rye leading the way.  The bitter dark malt would be next but the rye is certainly dominant.  The mouth is slightly viscous and chewy."
""
"Color is dark opaque brown with a frothy tan head.  Nice lacing and retention.  A very nice looking beer.  Definitely rye on the nose, along with some roasted malt and citrusy hops.  Flavor is crisp citrus hops followed by roasted malt with a dry, semi-bitter finish.  It's a very good example of using rye without overpowering the beer.  The rye is there and works well with the hops."
""
""
""
"Overall first the hops and malts clash, then rye turns a weird fruity instead of spicy, then the bad phenols just top it off. Def not the best beer by Founders, they kinda missed altogether on this one imo."
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste has a powerful earthy and piney bitterness that overtakes references to the dark malts and grain picked up in the first mouth swirl.  Lingering bite at the end."
""
""
"O: Overall great flavors coming from this brew, well balanced and great mixture of everything in this brew, definitely want more of this. Love me some Founders."
"founders nails every thing they do."
""
""
""
""
"Deep brown hue with a tan head. Aromas are a bit metallic and tinny but you get some very nice roast as well. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy with just enough carbonation to break up the flavor into decadent layers. Rich roast, some leather, touch of caramel and finishes with a bit of spice. A hearty and delicious beer."
""
"Probably the closest thing I've had to the Blakkr collaboration (that was Real Ale/Surly/3F, I had the Surly version):  a deep, roasty, almost savory taste that is preceded by a dark rye nose.  Unless and until Blakkr comes back this may be my go-to Black IPA.  Founders is really getting serious with the bitter black between this and Dark Penance (also quite good)..."

"Very dark brown with a 2 finger head that sticks around. Smells like hops, rye, and a hint of coffee. Tasted like hops and rye and was surprisingly smoky. Felt almost like eating sourdough bread, texture was definitely a strong point. Had me thinking it'd be an excellent beer to enjoy with BBQ. Would buy again."
""
"Had at Pittsburgh Winter BeerFest."
"Pours a deep brown so dark it appears black producing 1.5 fingers of somewhat lasting tan finely bubbled head that leaves a pasty wash of blotchy, streaky lacing. Aroma is dark malt, roast, cocoa, toffee, faint coffee, smoke, pumpernickel bread, brown sugar, some caramel & spice. Taste is dark malt, burnt dark bread, bold rye maltiness & spice, molasses, smoke, prune, brown sugar, tobacco & a lively bitter finish that lingers long in the burnt malt, smoky, dry aftertaste. As with a number of rye beers a metallic note emerges in the background & becomes most prominent in the aftertaste but is not detracting . Mouthfeel is medium bodied, moderately carbonated, lively & crawling with prickly spice, dry & astringent in the aftertaste. Exceptional!"
"Nice malts.  Enough hops.  Very enjoyable."

"Overall - Very interesting, unique and totally delicious brew. Those guys in Michigan can brew with the best of them, and it's a shame they don't distribute their product in California. Hopefully the recent announcement of expansion means we'll finally get their beers out here - come on, do it!"

"Something about the burnt flavors and the spicy rye just does not excite me. I enjoy a good use of rye, and I think the concept is interesting, but I can't say I love this. Still definitely worth a try!"

"Pours a deep not-quite-black brown with a thin creamy tan head that holds on and leaves nice small sticky lacing. The aroma is splendid, with hints of rye spice, black malt roast and pine hops. The taste is even better (if you like that sort of thing) with additional floral and earthy hops and some rye spice added in. The body is a great weight, not to heavy or slick but with a nice feel and a little spice bite on the finish."

"I wanted to enjoy this beer more than I did.  There are multiple components of this beer I enjoyed, but the lingering sense of licking an ashtray ruined this one for me.  I'll probably try another some day just to make sure my palate wasn't off when I drank this, but otherwise I don't see myself coming back to this beer."
""
""
"Taste: Sharp and spiky with lots of roasty, even burnt chocolate malts. The hop content rears it’s head with an earthiness that works well in conjunction with the dark roasted malts. Balance is good, and this is a solid, well-done, and very drinkable ale that I best describe as a hopped-up porter."
"Pours a dark brown to black color with a huge four finger off white head.  There is quite a bit of carbonation and some lacing.  The odor is powerful, roasted malts, coffee, bitter chocolate, nutty, herbal, rye, earthy.  The taste is full bodied, velvety, malty, nutty, rye, bitter chocolate, grassy, earthy, very roasted.  Bitter dry on the backed."
""
"With a touch more body, this would be unreal.   Having said that it's very, very good."
""

""
""
"Overall:  I never had the opportunity to try when this first was out, if the recipe truly hasn't changed then this is a very impressive beer considering it was around before the Black IPA trend was around.  Good balance between the hop bitterness, roasted malt flavor, and spicy rye notes.  Also impressive the rye component in the aroma."
""
""
"really like this beer.. rye comes through.. its nice and thick... very solid"
""
""
""
"O- Very tasty rye beer that I enjoyed quite a bit. Lots of flavours, nice complexity, good integration. The rye works well with the hops here."
""
"To be fair, this is my first of the style and maybe it's a good example of what a rye beer should be.  I like everything else that Founders puts out.  I'll definitely revisit after I've tried a few other examples."
""
""
""
""
"Poured a black body with one finger head and has an aroma of roasted malts, almost burnt, along with some minor hops in there.  Fuller bodied beer with a dry, more roasted malt with rye taste and the hops seem to be in background.  A little thick and sweet with nice balance and the hops cash in on the end (dry, citrusy).  Pretty good beer that's a change of pace from other dark beers."
" The flavor of rye malt with slight coffee-like roasted elements and some mild bitterness of hops with a slight spice quality which is peppery and continues with hops and mild alcohol in the finish. Overall this is a great rye with stout-like qualities nice dark malt taste."
"O: A very nice addition (or should I say re-addition) to the seasonal line-up. Very well balanced, with the rye, roast, and hops all working great together. Bitterness is also balanced by a nice light sweetness. Definitely worth seeking out, especially if you enjoyed Red's Rye in bottles or their darker beers"
"Dark brown with ruby edges.  The nose has touches of both chocolate and roasted malt.  Roasted malt is present along with rye spice on the periphery of the flavor profile.  This offering finishes dry."
""
""
""
""
"O - Fantastic beer.  Such a nice balance.  Great malt flavors that are dropped back enough to the let hops come through more."

"Coal black, cocoa-tinged head of 4 solid fingers (Speigelau), tight bubbles. Solid appearance. Roasted malts, bitter note, hint of grapefruit, definite floral and herbal hops, and an overarching rye theme. Front of the palate hits with piney and some grapefruit hops, followed by  a bite of rye and roasted malt, and bitterness on the back end. Bit of a thin mouthfeel. Clean, but a nice rye and herbal hop aftertaste. Overall a clean, restrained brew. Well crafted, it's own animal. NOT like a standard black IPA."
"Pours a dark brown/black with thin head.  Smells of chocolate, rye and pine.  Tastes of mocha, charred, dark malts, rye, and spicy pine.  Char, roasted malts and pine resin aftertaste.Medium body and med carbonation."

"t/m/o - as described, a black rye IPA. Some roastiness over a fairly watery body that is slapped in the face with a healthy dose of hops and sprinkled some rye for good measure.  Very drinkable with a moderate bitter finish, not a huge fan of the black IPAs in General, this one is pretty good, but the style isn't one that I would be interested in revisiting."
""
""
"12oz bottle. Pours a black color with a thin layer of head. Some lacing. The aroma is chocolatey and earthy with some citrus hop notes. Spicy rye notes. The taste is chocolate and coffee with the spicyness from the rye. Roasty with a good amount of hop flavor. Finishes with the roasted malts, chocolate and rye. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side. Overall, pretty solid offering I'd buy again."

"Very smooth finish, that is how I'm going to start this.  Dark, plumy, fleshy, smooth drinking craft beer.   This one is very enjoyable.  If in your location, you have to try, it's worth it.   LIke a porter / stout, but with more of a easier finish.   You have to watch youself, since you could drink the whole 6 pack in one sitting and the APV is 7.5%.  Thumbs up to Founders."

"Pours a dark brown with little head when going from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip glass.  Head quickly fades away.  Found there not to be much of a rye taste, but more of bitter flavor on the front and dry chocolate favor on the back.  Not big on dry finishes, so feel was very good.  Overall an outstanding beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown color with a off white head.  The aroma has some roasted qualities, rye grain, and a bit of an off scent.  The taste is much better with nice dark malt flavor, spicy rye, not to mention the citrus flavor from dry hopping, Roasted malt, reminiscent of the same found in Breakfast Stout or Porter, this is another tasty brew from Founders.  Full bodied, smooth brew and good taste.  I would drink this again, though it is getting a bit expensive."
""
"Pours black and with  tan head of foam that fell pretty quickly to a film and ring on top.  Nose is aloft with a nice bit of hops and some spicy and fragrant rye. Citrus peel and a touch of twiggy pine.  To my surprise I then discovered a lightish chocolate scent and a bit of bread.  taste is very unique.  The malt in this one is full but strict.  It has a bitterness that is up front to the palate.   Smooths out after the first sip to show you a very brisk palate of dark malt.  Chocolate that is not too sweet and a touch of smooth weaker coffee.  The citrus peel is just bright to the flavor so it's not out of place .  Only a light pine in the finish and it does finish crisp and with that rye to come to the aftertaste pretty strongly.  Mouthfeel is on the fuller side.  I kept thinking I tasted the hops in the finish but they are well balanced and this one favors the malt just enough to keep your interest and not too much bitterness to linger."
"Did not enjoy the smokey taste in this one."
""
"Great black, rye pale ale/ipa.  Hard to tell exactly which category it belongs in and that's one thing I love about American brewers.  I'm impressed with the extra additions of roasted malt.  It really enhances the flavor and makes it a malt forward brew."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this was a nice surprise to find during our second visit to Founders.  We had though this was long since retired, but were happy to see its name up on the tap board.  Through our critique, we found this to be much more along the lines of a rye porter or rye-heavy stout, when compared to your typical rye ales that are becoming more and more popular.  It certainly takes its “dark” label to nice and new depths across all aspects and departments, making for a uniquely experienced beer.  The grain is wonderfully represented, especially the heavy roast to it, and the authenticity of the rye.  This gives a fuller presentation to it.  Very bold and heavily drying, stylistically, and it seems almost naughty, like smoking a cigarette where you’re not supposed to."
"The rye was lacking.  Neither an excellent black IPA nor an excellent rye ale.  A mediocre beer trying to do too much."
""
""
"very dark, bitter but with less hops and rye than I would like"
""
""
""
""
"Pours really dark, almost black with little or no head.  Has a mild malt smell, with a hint of hops.  Has a strong taste, with a burnt coffee and molasses hint, with maybe a little licorice coming through.  A little carbonation with a nice finish.  Overall, a nice strong beer that has a very different dark finish to it."

"O: I was dissapointed with this beer, I was expecting better."
"What a shocker-another winner from Founders. Yes, a bit pricey but worth it IMO. If you like flavorful beers with great mouthfeel this is for you."
""
"O: Not at all what I expected as I've never had a rye beer before, but I'm impressed. It's not something I'd get all the time, but it's something I'd get again. It feels versatile; I'd have it any time of year with almost any food that could take a slightly darker beer."
"Overall: I picked this one up not knowing what to expect beyond tasting some rye which I enjoy. Founders does great work in nearly everything they do. This is no exception. Just temper your expecations based on your personal tates. This one was a win for sure, but not outstanding."
""
""
""
"Overall I like the Dark Penance more damn I hate rye beers..."
""
"Pours jet black.  Low head that remains around the edges. Leaves spotty lace.  The aroma is very nice.  Roasty coffee is the primary feature.  Flavor starts out predominately coffee.  Some chocolate notes.  The rye kicks in noticeably on the finish with that tell-tale peppery spicy kick.  Clean finish.  I'm nota big coffee guy, but I liked this one, probably because it is an enjoyably complex brew."
"Something about this beer... I don't know exactly what it is. It's somewhat light tasting (to me) but I guess that's part of what makes it so great. The best part about this beer is what some people may find to be the worst part -- the subtlety of the rye is excellent, and the feel is fantastic as well. For some reason I wasn't expecting a whole helluva lot from this beer, but it's a great one."
"Nice combination of ashy coffee grounds, prickly rye, and earthy hops in the nose. The flavor profile is largely the same. This drinks like a hoppy stout to me; roasted to the point of char maltiness with a spicy hop bite. It's hard to tell the rye notes from the hops. I just know it all works well. I loved the lingegring bitter ash. The mouthfeel was on the oily side."
"This has a great combination of flavors. Hoppy and malt rye. Smooth and with consitant taste from one beer to the next"

"Overall this is a solid beer, but founders is really pushing the limits on pricing for a good but not great beer.  Worth a try but I doubt I go back."

"Overall, a pretty good beer and worth getting as a trip back to 2006. I enjoyed this beer from the past and hop it comes into rotation as well."
"This is a solid Black IPA, but it's nothing crazy. It's basically like a lighter version of Dark Penance. It's good, but it doesn't match up with alot of the heavy swingers in the style IMO."

"O: excellent rendition of a hoppy black rye."
""
"Enjoyed the pepper from the rye, but it did not have much aroma and to me it was too bitter."
"Really enjoyed this, but the finish is quite astringent with the rye spice and dark roast malts contributing extra bitterness"

"great rye beer, lot of flavor"
"The taste is of roasted malts and a little bitter but actually just right - a very nice beer."
""
"O- It not a bad beer just a bit boring to me. I prefer Red's Rye much more and don't really care for the amount of roast to hops. I like how Founders has done hopped dark beers with Dark Penance and Inspired Artist but not this one. Plus I think this beer is overpriced like Red's Rye and should be a six pack for the 12 bucks they are charging. I hate seeing old hoppy beers, especially dark ones and I know the price point has got to be turning some people away like it is Dark Penance."

"Pours nearly black, with only a hint of ruby showing through near the base.  The khaki head is modest, but nicely creamy and sticks to the surface well.  Smells deeply malty...char, nuts, caramelized sugar, and coffee with some leafy, earthy hops.  Flavors of black malt, burnt sugar, chocolate, coffee roast, and some resinous pine.  Some earthy, peppery, spicy bite that may be from the rye.  Smooth medium body with a solid bitterness.  About as good as I remember it being.  Glad they brought it back, I remember being pretty disappointed when they discontinued it."

"Aroma of dark roasted malt, rye, faint smokiness & spice, earthy. Taste bitter toasty malt & rye, spice, zest, hint cocoa & earthiness."
""

"Reminds me a lot of Wookey Jack."

"Really good hop aroma, doesn't skimp on the rye spiciness like others of the style do, more charry and assertive overall than Dark Penance."

"Very good. Had out of bottle."

"Overall I thought this was a really nice beer and I thought it was a good example of the style, it had three main aspects, roasted malt, hops and rye, they were all represented nicely with no single aspect sticking out too much and being overpowering.  This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, crisp, slightly creamy, dry on the finish, a little filling and the taste did a good job at holding my attention, I think two would be a good amount for me, anymore than that and it might start to be too filling for me.  What I like the most about this beer was the balance it was just where it needed to be and it made for a really nice beer.  What I like the least about this beer was nothing, there isn't anything that I disliked or would change about this beer, it's good just the way it is.  I would buy this again, it would be nice to have on hand for when I feel like a dark rye beer  I would recommend this to anyone likes Rye beers, I think it's worth a try and it's similar to a Black IPA, but it doesn't seem to be as bitter as most.  All in all I was happy with this beer and just a little impressed, Founders shows just how talented they are with how great of balance this beer has, I get all the aspects that I'm looking for and they don't step on each others toes and I don't think that's easy to do when it comes to a beer like this.  This isn't a favorite from Founders but it is one of the better examples of a Dark Rye beer that I've had.  Good job guys, this was one tasty beer, keep up the hard work."

"Its clean and citrus flavor captures the fleeting bitterness of white grapefruit particularly well even while burnt pine needles and peppercorn offer a special zing in its dry and drinkable finish; despite butting up against the friction of imperial strength."

"Great addition to the seasonal list by Founders, as always, they never dissapoint. A nice hybrid between a black ipa and rye ipa."

"Flat black with a small tan head. An aroma of roast malt and pine. Creamy body with moderate carbonation. Flavors of roast malt, coffee, chocolate, rye, and pine. Dry finish with lingering pine and coffee."

"All around great! The dry hopped flavor really ties this one together"
"O: Really good stuff. Glad I grabbed the 4-pack today, even at $12.99 per. . . ."
"Bottle. Pours a very serious black. Dark tan head.head leaves sticky, thick lacing. Very roasty with a pine and citrus hoppiness that isn't too shy. Pumpernickel bread. Dehydrated cereal grains. Flavor is a makes me think stout more than Black IPA. He notes on this page say it's 64 IBU but the label says 78 IBU. Bitterness is lingering. It isn't preposterously bitter. Roast, dark neutral chocolate, piney hops. A bit of burnt rye bread. Just the tiniest whisper of minty hop. Fuller bodied. Long, hidden bitterness. Bitter from hop and dark malt. Medium carbonation. I recently purchased a four pack of Founders' dark penance and it was far too bold for my taste. I was nervous about this one being too similar but it's a full standard deviation below Dark Pennance in terms of ridiculously coercive flavors. Probably going to take some time to burn through the four pack; I imagne another bomber and sixer might be purchased and drank before I finish this quartet. I still trust Founders."

"Solid black color with a decent off white head. Roasty earthy resinous and a little spicy. Easy drinking at 7.5 % is dangerous I finished it before this review. Good stuff!"
"Love it. Black IPA's are my favorite."

"There's some good character here, but even if not being the biggest Rye fan, still the parts don't really seem to jive and fit well here.  Slightly comes out kind of session feeling too which at 6.6 abv doesn't really work over well either.  Not horrible, but not great either."

"Nice mix between a black ipa and a rye beer. Roasted taste with a spicy rye finish."

"If you like rye beers, this might be a must have.  The dark malt flavors play in, but the rye dominates.  I am a little torn between the fact that it's a well made beer, but a bit dry for me on this tasting.  Will have to revisit this one."
""
"This is a very good rye beer. Very nice to see a dry-hopped black ale that isn't completely hop-centric (despite the wonderful aroma from the dry-hop). Really lets the malt base and especially the rye shine."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 12/6/2014. Pours fairly pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, chocolate, cocoa, coffee, spicy rye, brown bread, floral, grass, and floral/roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/pine hops and moderate roasted/bready malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, chocolate, cocoa, coffee, spicy rye, brown bread, floral, grass, and floral/roasted earthiness. Good amount of pine/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon/orange zest, pine, chocolate, cocoa, coffee, spicy rye, brown bread, and floral/roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of citrus/pine hops and moderate roasted/bready malt sweetness; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, moderately sticky, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent black rye IPA style. All around great complexity and balance of citrus/pine hops and moderate roasted/bready malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."
""
"O: It's rather brash and unapologetic, but so are most black IPAs. This one strikes a nice balance between the complex grain bill and multi-dimensional hop profile, though both offer that double-dose of bitterness expected of the style that you either love or hate. the tandem of noble and American hops in particular stood out."

""

""
""

"Roasted malts and hops are the centerpiece of this beer.  The best comparison would be a Black IPA just take away the coffee and chocolate. Doesn't knock your socks off like other beers in their lineup but its a well made beer."

"Taste is well done, typical Founders deliciousness. Coffee, rye bread, bakers chocolate and light red-grape fruitiness. It would seem this beer would be better fresh, but this still is pretty damn tasty. Mouthfeel and body are about medium and the beer displays very little sweetness. My 12 oz bottle is disappearing very fast, so drinkability must be pretty high!"
"Quite enjoyable, but its hard to put a finger on whats really going on here. I guess the only style that can sum this up is the generic term ""rye beer"". Its an excellent one for sure."
"Pours black with at least 2 fingers of head. Smell some cocoa and chocolate. Taste chocolate, rye and a bitter finish, delicious! The mouthfeel is thick. I could only drink a few of these, split with friends, but very delicious."
"D- I think this has held up with time. Flavors are still crisp and clean for the most part. I have a bottle or two left and will be saving on to them for a little while longer. Would suggest you start to drink this now as I see it at it's prime now."
"Deep dark brown with a thinner head than I expected. Smell is of sour dough bread, pineaples and coffee. This has a very rich and interesting flavor. Sour, sweet, spicy and bitter with a noticable alcahol aftertaste. I've had beers with a much higher ABV that do not show their boozy side as much as this one. Roasted malty coffee flavors remind me of a warm porter. Again the tangy spicy sourness from the rye comes out. I've recently become interested in rye beers. I'm not sure if I know exactly how to appreciate what a great one is supposed to be like. This was an intersting beer with very complex flavors. I can't say I really loved those flavors."
"Overall so damn solid, one of my new favorites from Founders for sure."
"Glad I got to try this one. I would like to try this when the dry hopping is a little stronger."
"I believe Founders last brewed this ""black beauty"" over 2 years ago. So that means the bottle I was drinking was at LEAST that old, and I'm betting closer to 3 years or more. Regardless, age has changed Black Rye into another beast, or should I say another TASTY beast. I'd love to see Founders get back to brewing this. There's a lot of people out there that should have the opportunity to try it!"
"Fantastic beer!"
"D- Delicious. Definitely could keep coming back for more if this thing wasn't so damn hard to pour! A great beer, worth seeking out."
"Drainpour."
"Easy drinking, very nice take on a style that getting more popular. Despite the rough start, this was a nice beer!"
"Nice black pour with a tan head. Looks like dark porter,smells like hops,chocolate,and sweet rye bread. The flavor is awesome,kind of like IPA meets stout,and the flavor changes throughout the glass,some coffee,caramel and dark bread,rye grain notes, awesome mouthfeel good lively carbonation, and a crisp hop finish...my burps tasted like hops. One of my top 3 favs easily."
"D: This is remarkably drinkable but given that it will be the only one i'll be drinking this year, I'm savoring it. Thanks again, Joe!"
"Drinkablity was quite good. For better or worse, there was a lot of good competition."
"Very easy drinking with a great mix of flavors."
"D- two of these would be nice. another good release from founders. not their best, but certainly drinkable."
"I'm looking forward to my trip to Grand Rapids to check this brewery out in person."
"Great brew here, poured much darker than I expected. Enormous medium tan head with lots of good lacing. Mild aroma slightly sharp and bitter, scents of chocolate malt and sweet caramel. Creamy and thick to the mouth good feel to this. Flavor resembles a light porter or sweet stout. Nice bitter hop flavor with a sharp graininess, which could be the rye. This is my first rye brew, and what a great one indeed."
"12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass...can't find any light passing through the blackness with a lingering tan head. Aromas of milk chocolate are inviting, but then a swallow reveals bittersweet chocolate. There's tanginess from the rye, and some citrus-y hop goodness. What a mix--it's like chocolate covered hops! Delicious. Medium body and ample carbonation, so you get a lot of flavor that doesn't weigh you down. Not sure that I'd want to drink more than maybe a couple of these, but one is really enjoyable."
"M/D - Smooth, strong flavors, and very consistent. The characteristics of a stout without the heavy feel. Definitely recommended."
"A wonderful floral aroma with a pitch black pour and a nice tan head. Exquisite taste of chocolate, caramel, coffee, and nutty with a bitter-sweet tingle to the palate. Smells awesome, tastes great, and is a very good beer if you can get it, then fricken get i"
"A little too much rye to have more than a couple of for me but this was an enjoyable beer."
"Can't wait for Founders arrival here in NC. This will be part of my regular rotation. Thanks DavidEddie for the wonderful extra."
"Mouthfeel was light yet creamy. Carbonation lends a nice fizziness to this beer."
"The body was slightly heavy and the carbonation as well as the sticky foam made it a nice thick drink. Even though it had an unimpressive abv it was moderately warming."
"I found this Rye to be very drinkable. The character of the rye and roasted malts makes this a nice beer for the winter season."
"Pours to a attractive black body with decent carbonation showing on the sides of the glass and in the head. Head is a rocky deep tan with nice retention. Nose is wonderful with a mingling of smokey malt and spicey hops. Really gets the mouth watering. Flavor is a little thinner than the nose would have led you to expect. Does have a solid burnt malt character followed by a even, dry bitter feel that rounds out the mouthfeel. Maybe even a hint of sweetness in the middle of the palate. Nicely drinkable and quite complex the style."
"Prosit und Zum Wohl, MK"
"D: Not a bad brew, but the mouthfeel really hurts it. I'll try it again to see if I like it better."
"Opened with a pop! Poured a deep black with an off white head. Lots of roasted barley and citrusy hops in aroma also some chocolate. Aggressive roasted/patent malt bitterness. Some tangieness from the rye. Long dry finish of roasted malt and hops. Not sure if I could drink a lot of this."
"Love the mouthfeel of rye beers, a little dry and grainy. A bit of red grape skin after taste."
"Pours a thick black color with a generous amount of foamy, and frothy rich brown head. Bubbled up almost over the rim of my glass. PLenty of sticky lacing on the side of the glass. Aroma is of rich, dark roasty malt with a vine type grape aroma. Taste is sweet at first followed by a hoppy bittering. Mouthfeeling is very flat allowing for the flavor to really dominate and that is mostly the rye."
"Brownish black in appearance. Thick head. Aromas of roasted malt, chocolate, a bit of spicy rye and coffee. Tastes of chocolate, roasted coffee, burnt toast, mild pine, dark rye bread and some tangy citrus. Finishes kind of crisp. Mouth feel is creamy and slightly thick. Drinkability is nice. Alcohol is well hidden. Reminds me of a spicy/hoppy porter. Recommended!"
"Pours an almost black with a one finger light tan head that quickly dies down to a thin layer of bubbles. Very spotty lacing on the sides, could use some help in this department. The nose of this one is probably the best characteristic of this beer. There's a wonderful explosion of fresh grassy rye and dark smokey chocolate. Fresh ground coffee with a subtle citrus hop bite. In a way I could find people really disliking this smell, but I find it complex and very appealing. Taste is very similar to the smell. Fresh burst of citrus up front with a chocolate and carmel malt undertone. Toasted rye flavors are presesnt from start to finish which gives this beer a very unique and crisp bite. Aftertaste is somewhat dry and clean with a fairly bitter feel. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a fair carbonation. I just recently had Bell's Rye Stout and find these two beers to be fairly similar in taste. Bell's was more creamy and Founders has more of a bite. Another solid brew from Founders."
"Pours an opaque darkness with a huge stiff tan head. A good amount of lacing as the rocky foam drapes and fades. The first mouth full through the beast is creamy and full bodied. Initially you can enjoy a chocolaty aroma from about a foot away from this one. As the head subsides the rye character sneaks out from beneath the cocoa. Full flavored, the taste is quite similar to the nose. A hoppy finish balances the malts out nicely. At 6.6% ABV this one is real nice drinker. Been looking forward to trying it for a while...thanks Dave!"
"D - Mild, accessible and pleasant. I would probably have one with a flavorful dinner next time, rather than an after dinner drink. Seems like it would pair well with a steak and blue chess salad."
"D- If this beer is always this carbonated I would not drink another. But if I simply have a bad bottle I would certainly be willing to give it another try. I enjoyed the porteresque smell and flavor, though I was hardpressed to find any contribution of the rye."
"Pours an almost opaque black with a thin tan head that leaves spotty lacing on my SABL glass. The aroma is somewhat reminiscent of a stout but also has shades of smores being cooked over a campfire. There was an abundance of roastiness in the flavor, but not quite what you would find in a stout, more like toasted rye bread than roasted barley. Bitter espresso and dark chocolate linger in the finish. The beer is medium bodied with a slight amount of carbonation but nothing too aggressive. This is certainly one of the most interesting dark beers I've ever had, clearly not one to fall into either the porter or stout classification. I truly enjoy this beer as well as their Red's Rye and I cannot wait until Founders becomes available in North Carolina early next year."
"Thanks to Demcorhip for the bottle!"
"The aroma reveals a biscuity malt backbone with notes of brown sugar, foresty hops, and toffee. The taste blasts off with a huge roast coffee malt note, acrid as hell and lingering for what seems like an eternity. Some smoother milk chocolate and hops blend into the background. Lovin' it. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and viscous, with (again) a huge bitter java bite to the finish. This beer is good, if not very good, but it's a bit much to be able to stomach more than one per setting. Nevertheless, it's one I'll be looking forward to trying again soon."
"Got this one cause I was so impressed with the Red's Rye. This one was also very good, although maybe not at quite the same level. Great 'sphit' when the bottle opens. Something crazy in the pour of this whole sixer - huge (4"") tan head, frothy, if a little excessive. Beer is mahogany with nice red highlights. Looks great and I'll blame the giant head on mishandling. Nose is crazy spicy malt, turns more roasted as it continues. Molasses, some light dried fruit. Taste is much more roasted than the nose. Spices go strong on the tip of the tongue. Some bittering hopes at the back end and in the fairly short aftertaste. No real sweetness to this one. Too carbonated and fizzy, although the body's good. A tasty brew, although I'll probably stick with the more plentiful Red's."
"Wow, this beer is carbonated. A deep black beer with a huge head, so much in fact that there was more head than beer as I poured. It has finally settled and there is a half inch atop the brew. The smell is oatmeal, coffee. This is the first rye beer I have seen that is this dark. The taste is like a nice porter. Roasted flavors abound. The mouthfeel is interesting. Ths carbonation really makes the beer foam up. The drinkability is good. I could certainly go for this again."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. This beer made a huge pillowy cloud of a head over a pitch black liquid. The aroma is hoppy (the label states 'dry hopped') and a little stout-y (maybe the rye gives that smell) with chocolate undertones. The taste is not unlike Storm King, kind of like a hoppy russian imperial stout. Very nice, easy to drink, an excellent beer."
"Overall, quite good, and refreshingly different. I have bought some more so I can try this a few more times."
"Overall: I love this beer and wish I had grabbed a six pack opposed to one for me and the Sudsdog. This is a wonderful beer that is packed with flavor. It is another great brew, as I have come to expect from Founders."
"The mouthfeel is a little to highly carbonated for my tastes at first, but seems to get better after a bit. This beer is fairly complex and the taste allows it to go down pretty easily. A good dark beer when you want something a bit roasty."
"This is so well constructed it held up for a year without any significantly noticeable changes."
"D: I've only had 2 beers from this brewery the Red's Rye and the Black, both are outstanding, I like the Red a little better, but this is a great beer, I just wish that Founders distributed to California, but that is wishful thinking."
"Exceptionally smooth and easy to put down. Well balanced with a semi-dry finish. Highly recommended."
"Founders comes through with another winner. This beer is so unique and delicious I can't wait to drink another. The brewers at Founders are some of the best in the country at brewing so many different styles, everyone of them excellent."
"drinkability is decent, but the bold flavors will deter many less adventurous drinkers. a shame, but true. fans of porters and spiced hops will be fans of this one. cheers!"
"D: I had this one in the hot sun too. I'd like to try in on a cool autumn night. Good beer! Went down nice."
"D - Excellent! I love Red's Rye, and this is a perfect dark side companion to Founder's other excellent rye beer."
"Drank this from a 12 oz bottle with no discernible bottling date. Pours an opaque black with ruby edges with a tall, off-white head. Great retention. Nice roasted aromas: a bit woody, toffee, burnt sugar, toasted coffee, even some dark fruit like cherries or raisins. The sweetness of the fruit comes out more as the beer warms. Flavors of roasted coffee, oatmeal, bitterness of dark chocolate. Mouthfeel is on the thicker side, complements the flavors very nicely. Overall, an excellent beer. Very drinkable. Nice, bold flavors - great complexity."
"Verb - To introduce hops to the wort after the fermentation. Dry hopping significantly increases the hops character of the aroma and flavor of the final beer without increasing the bitterness or IBUs (international bittering units)."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a shaker. This beer poured a deep brown/black semi-translucent color with ruby highlights around the edges of the glass. A thin, fizzy head lasted for a few moments, then faded into a few lingering bubbles. The aroma consisted of roasted chocolate malts, nuts, and a bit of light piney hops sitting in the background. The flavor was slightly biting, and bitter at the start. Then it was followed up by some chocolate and coffee notes that lingered. The mouthfeel was lightly carbonated and medium-bodied. This was a pretty good brew from Founders. It almost reminded me of a dry stout. Worth a try."
"Overall, an interesting and enjoyable beer."
"Recieved this beer from brandoman63 from the brews-n-tunes bif. Served slightly chilled in a pint glass from a stubby twelve ounce bottle. Poured a very dark brown, almost black. About a finger of thick, froth, light tan head formed. Head hung around for quite a while, leaving a decent amount of lace behind. Smell was somewhat smoky. A little bit coffee like, with a little bit of hops and malted rye in the background. Taste had a nice smooth malty kick to it. Short hoppy blasts, plenty of rye, and a little coffee in the background. Maybe a little bread in there as well. Moderately carbonated, not much noticeable alcohol. Somewhat rich and medium bodied in the mouth. Pretty drinkable and pleasant."
"Suprizingly light mouthfeel, feels somewhat coarse,leaving an oily hop residue on the palate. Fairly easy drinking, could drink a few of these not an all nighter by any means. An interesting beer worth a try."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, easy, very drinkable, no noticable alcohol. A black session beer for sure."
"Notes: One of the more interesting beers I've ever had. My first one from Founders, looking forward to trying others."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, slightly filling, good kick, this is a nice beer to drink a few of, but personally I'd have be in the mood for it in order to select it. However, overall, it's a very good beer."
"The beer pours a jet black into my glass with a nice frothy tan head, when held to a bright light there is a very deep ruby hue. The head diminished to a skim coating but offered nice lacing. The aroma is moderately roasty, fairly chocolately, and there is a moderate-low spicy and citrusy hop aroma. The flavor is rather complex. A medium roasted/burnt malt note is delivered upfront, followed by moderate hop bitterness, and moderate-high hop flavor. The finish is rather smooth and has a crisp, dry rye character with a pleasant hint of roast and hop flavor lingering on the tongue. Carbonation is medium and body is medium to medium-full. Overall I really enjoyed this brew. It was nice to see the hop aroma shine along side the roasted/chocolate aroma and the flavor is very well done. A solid alternative to your typical porter or stout."
"Founders Black Rye pours a beautiful inky black with a creamy off white head. Aroma is a delcious mix of dark toasty malts, almost toasty, and citrusy centennial hops. The Rye character is much more pronounced in the flavor, and it works really well with the dark malts. The hop flavor really goes great with the black malts, I'm really surprised at how well it works. I really hope Founders is more available on the East coast soon!"
"Pours a great head that retains well with a good lacing. Color is black with brown edges. The smell is nice and roasty with a light chocolatey smell coming through. It also has a lot of hoppy smell coming through. The flavor is really chocoalatey with some earthy roastiness. I really enjoy this. The mouthfeel is carbonated well and a little crisp, but the flavor is just like putting a handfull of black roasty coffee malts in your mouth and just chewing. I love it! Overall I will have this again and hope to have lots of it."
"This Dark Black unfilted beer is sure to please. It pours with a sturdy dark beige/light brown head that holds throughout the session. The lace rings the glass perfectly. Defintely serve this beer on the warm side as it bring forth all the glorious roasted flavor of this brew. I found it to be big coffee taste that morphs into a dry chocolate nuttyness. The finish is a real dryness that for my taste, lingers just a little too long, but did leave me wanting that next sip. Black Rye may not be the best of Founder beer as far as I'm concerned but, it is still a very drinkable beer from a small very interesting brewery."
"This is one extremely drinkable beer. Founders knows how to make rye beers, that's for sure. Highly recommended."
"This beer was impressive in all aspects. Even though it is labeled as a ""rye beer," it closely resembles an American stout and would be able to compete with the best of them."
"D: An amazing beer from an amazing brewery. So spicy and refreshing. An excellent counterpart to Red's Rye."
"The mouth is medium-bodied with great carbonation. It is fairly complex, being slightly sweet and creamy, yet also dry at the same time. It is quite drinkable. Very good overall."
"Drinkability? Are you kidding me? This is awesome!"
"For me this is a stout with rye, not much different, but very well done."
"SECOND TRIAL: This is a dynamite beer. I really enjoy the rich bitter chocolate flavors and the extremely dry finish. The beer pours a nice black, with a modest head. The aroma is bitter chocolate and roasted malt. The taste is very similar: very, very roasted malt, burnt pizza crust, and a nice bitter chocolate. The finish is very dry and leaves a bit of a burnt malt flavor on the palate. I really, really enjoy this beer. It reminds me a bit of Three Floyd's Alpha Klaus, but it's quite a bit cheaper, making it an excellent choice. Another great Founder's brew."
"D: A different brew that has no equals. I could not figure out if it was a stout or an ale. The rye element was done very well. A must try for the adventuresome palate."
"Word on the street is that this is the last batch of black rye that Founders is ever making. Hope that's just a rumor, but in case it isn't i thought i'd do a goodbye review. Very dark beer with a nice tan head that laces up nicely. Roasted malt odor, burnt and dry smelling with some soft rye and ethanol notes. Taste is dry rye, burnt roasted grains with some dark chocolate in there too. Quite bitter, but in an interesting and good way. Overall, its tasty, and the flavor is odd enough to keep me interested throughout the whole beer, which is something i like in my drinks."
"On its own merits this is pretty drinkable - much of what many people like about a nice dry stout, without being TOO filling...but I'm finding myself comparing this to Founders Red Rye, which to me is way more drinkable. One of these is really great...but after that give me a sixer of the Red."
"Black color. Medium body---not syrup thick. Aroma is burnt grain. Bitterness comes from burnt grain, rye and lots of hops. Even better on tap at brew pub. Much less filling than stouts. Founders deserves credit for this ""different"" brew. The best of the black brews I have tried!"
"Overall, a lot of burnt dark taste, not all that pleasant but counterbalanced by its interesting aggressiveness. A great standout beer."
"DA: I love this Rye version of what seems like a nice big stout, very tastey with a good feel. This is my kinda brew."
"12oz. bottle poured dark brown/black with large tan foam cap with good retention that leaves spots of lace around the glass. Smells of floral hops with a light bread aroma. The rye is the first thing in the taste I notice along with a grassy hop flavor and some dark roasted malt. The feel has a slight tingle of carbonation and is light/medium bodied. This is a very tasty and drinkable brew from Founders and I'm finding their beers to be some of my favorites and I can't wait for them to be available in my area."
"Overall a very interesting beer. Almost like a hoppy porter. I like it, I'll definitely have to pick up a sixer."
"Overall, I'm very impressed with this beer. Very flavorful, not watered down at all. $1.50 is not bad either for the single."
"App. - 4, Smell - 4, Taste - 3, Mouth - 4.5, Drink - 4"
"Poured into a pint glass. Dark deep red to brown in color that maintains a small tan head throughout the entirety of the beer. There is also a ton of lacing on the glass. Smells sweet, chocolatety, a little bit of coffee - not sure if I smell rye, but there is some bread character. I think the taste is well the dry ryelike component comes through. There's also some sweetness and a little coffee as well. There's a good amount of carbonation here - the mouthfeel is nice for this style. I could drink more than one of these at a sitting, no problem. Recommended."
"D- It is really good. First Founder's I have had that has been really good. Nice complexity and flavors. Everything blends really nicely."
"Smooth, medium-light body. Very drinkable."
"This is a rather good experience, a recommended trying. It is different, though. If you like Chi tea, then you may really like this beer. if you don't, try it anyway."
"Cheers!"
"This seems like a departure from most other rye beers, which tend to be IPA-ish. This holds a surprise rye factor that is very enjoyable. Another winner from founders. I'd buy it if it were available around here. Thanks to Jason for this one."
"When I visit Founders later this month, I will make sure I bring back plenty of this great beer."
"Pours from bottle to snifter a dark brown, almost black color with sone copper-orange highlights. Produces an immense, rocky tan head which slowly settles to a durable 1/4"" coating. An amazingly complex aroma greets the nose with upfront notes of dusty/earthy hops, spicy crushed caraway seeds, rye, dark roasted malts and cocoa. Found the palate to be full, but was way too spritzy for the style. Less CO2 would have provided a silkier mouthfeel. Flavors seemed a bit more subdued as compared to the aromas. However, lots semi-sweet burnt malt and chocolate initially, followed by a firm hit of an earthy and citrusy hop presence. A subtle taste of spicy rye grain is left on the tongue in the finish. A very unique and pleasing dark ale. Perhaps a dark IPA to be more precise. Worth seeking out for sure."
"Drinkability: I was pleasantly surprised by this one. Much different than Red's Rye or Hop Rod Rye or other rye beers I have tried. Like a marriage between a rye'd APA and a porter or stout. Very cool."
"Poured into nonic, mahogany-esc color, almost opaque except for shades of red as its held to light. Huge full off white head looks like some crazy root beer float. Smells of dark toasted malts right up against a grainy rye character, both chocolate and coffee notes run through out with a slightly nutty smokiness and a tinge of grapefruity citrus from the hops. Taste is predominantly subtle bitter chocolate flavor, the rye is more present when its cold, as it warms up it becomes way more tolerable. Starts with a medium sweetness then dry smokiness backed by a slight chocolate coated grapefruit flavor, finish (after it warms) is mellow dark roast coffee, mediated by rye. The mougthfeel on this is sort of grainy, because of the rye I assume. At first when I was drinking this I was on the fence, it basically comes down to this if you like rye you will love this, but if not it might be a bit more of a task. Personally I enjoy this, but unfortunately I doubt Ill buy it again, all the same a damn good beer from a great brewery."
"An exceptional beer. Pours extremely dark, almost black with a short head that dissipates pretty quickly and leaves some spotty lacing. The smell is a blend of hops and roastiness with some spicy rye underlying it all. The taste is very deep and layered. Some hops up front, then a deep bitterness from roasting, followed by spicy rye flavors and a little grainy sourness on the aftertaste. Its very dry, but there are cream and dark chocolate flavors here as well. The mouthfeel is medium weight, but bitter tannins and creaminess are nicely in balance. Maybe a tad too carbonated, but very drinkable. A really nice offering from a great brewery."
"D: Another winner from Founders, this ale packs a lot of flavor into a small bottle."
"drinkable?: hmm.. not for me, to smoke headache feeling and a touch to many hops that steal its creamy smoothability."
"This beer poured a pitch black color and formed a huge, foamy medium tan head much like a float. It subsided slowly, coating the glass with lace. An aroma of malt, coffee, cocoa and slight hint of hops. The flavor was of malt, coffee and slight bit of chocolate. It has a medium body and a burnt/bitter finish. Not a bad beer, although not familiar with the rye styles as a whole."
"D - This beer is different in a good way. I could sit down with a few of these."
"d -- not for somene looking for a relaxing ""drink it and forget about it"" kind of beer; drinkability is heightened by how much attention the beer demands, leaving you curious to have another. spicy, warming, and delicious, but i think that 1 or 2 would be enough at any one time."
"Bottle courtesy of Tpaliga: Poured a medium black color ale with a medium foamy head with average retention. Aroma of hops is dominant with some traces of malt being noticeable. Taste consists of predominantly citrus hops with a bitter finish and some light roasted malt. Body is a bit thin IMO and rye is very hard to detect. I would have appreciated a bit more complexity and less reliance on hops personally."
"Shipped southward by dirtylou. Notched bottom center of the front label...September?"
"Medium body, moderate carbonation. Balance is excellent. Alcohol is hidden well, no trace of it in the flavor or aroma. Great mix of flavors, this one is definately unique. This is one of those beers I could drink again & again."
"Overall an excellent and flavorful beer. Really the perfect winter brew. Very drinkable and a solid ABV to boot. Thanks to robertdoesbeer for this one."
"D: A good one - nicely balanced, good flavors. Recommended."
"The body has a mid feel but lightened probably due to the rye and hops perception. The beer is easy to drink and quite tasty. Overall I like the new taste, but as for Metallica, I like the old style better."
"Poured beer from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a very dark color with a slight amber tint and a cream colored head that leaves small amounts of lacing. The smell is nice, of hops, roasted malt and slightly of alcohol. The taste is initially of hops, followed by burnt chocolate, rye, and a bitter/alcohol finish. The mouthfeel is great, full bodied with creamy carbonation. Overall I would have to say that this is a pretty drinkable beer, but the bitter finish is a bit much. Definitely worth trying."
"An enjoyable beer. Many thanks to trbeer for the chance to try this one."
"Overall, another innovative ale from Founders."
"Can't think of another beer to compare it to - maybe a whiff of Alpha Klaus in there, but still different. Thanks to BA JeffKrenner for the bottle!"
"D - Roastiness will become fatiguing, besides that though its fairly decent."
"Pours a deep black, a hint of a rub hue when held to light, with a good tan head that lasts a while with good lacing. Aroma is of rye bread and some hops. Taste is sort of like rye bread with some burn malt, a little spicy, and some oily hops. A coffee like after taste as well. There are some hints of chocolate as it warms. Mouthfeel is very good. First few drinks I had I didnt care for. The more you drink of it and it warms the better it is. Interesting brew."
"Mouthfeel was smooth with an mildly oily texture. Medium to full body. Founders Brewery has become my all-around favorite. Everything I have tried from them has been well above average."
"I'm already a huge fan of the red rye, and I'll definitely be buying a six of its darker cousin."
"This beer is a marvel of architecture. Whoever brews this is showing off, and they deserve to because I doubt many brewers could pull this off so nicely. By all rights, this should taste like hate, but it is so well put together that it is awesome. Definately a different take on rye. Kind of the inverse of a dark lager."
"A dry-hopped dark ale made with rye sounds good to me! Pours an inky dark brown with a voluptuous, creamy, glass-coating, light khaki head. Big roasted malt aroma with whiskey, smoke, peaty earth, and dark fruit. Spicy hops. Roasted malt flavors blend with chocolatey sweetness up front. Whiskeyish fruit comes around as the roasted turns to increasingly bitter and coffee hops. Yum! Faintly warming. Long dark chocolate bitter finish. Medium bodied with a surprisingly spritzy mouthfeel. Nice work!"
"Very easy to drink. Unusual enough to make you want more than one."
"Decent carbonation in this medium bodied brew. Coffee aftertaste remains for a while. Some bitterness on swallowing and just a touch of dryness, as well. If you're looking for a rye beer you may want to grab a Founders Red Rye instead. Not a bad beer....just not quite what I was expecting."
"This is my first rye and was really looking forward to drinking it. I poured this 12 ounce bottle into a glass beer mug and dark body and tannish brown head was suprising. The head had some staying power with medium lacing. The beer smelled very, i guess rye, and was very earthy as well. It may have been the appearence but it has the look of a stout and so that is what I tasted at first but then the taste mellowed on to a nice grainy taste, with a touch of alcohol. Drinkable, I like it."
"Overall, it's drinkable, but not bold enough for me. If you're going to put RYE in big fonts, lets emphasize it."
"A fun beer that I would love to try again. With all the rye beers I've been brewing lately I've been curious on how a rye porter/stout might turn out, this gave me a great idea."
"D: Interesting brew, fairly original which is always nice. This could pass like as an Xmas beer."
"I wouldn't drink a ton of this at once, but I would drink it often. A quality beer, and very unusual. Highly recommended."
"Nice body abnd nice carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer that I enjoyed throughout."
"D: Highly recommended. I could have a bunch of these in one sitting and with the abv being at a decent level, almost a session beer."
"Drinkability - this is good, would go for at least two of these in a session, might be up for something else after that, or maybe stick with this."
"Thanks for picking this up Eric!"
"Enjoyable and flavorful. Certain aspects of this beer remind me of a nicely crafted porter, but the rye flavors are nicely highlighted as well."
"Drinkability: I was worried that this might be a hop monster, but was pleasantly surprised that the overall impression was a bold hop taste that was very well blended so as not to overwhelm me....a very nice beer, that I would try again."
"D - Very drinkable. This is a very tasty brew offer from Founders. Glad I had a chance to check it out."
"Thin body, surprisingly, appropriate carbonation. Very easy drinking. Incredibly smooth and the aftertaste reminds you of the goodness that you just sippied on."
"Crisp mouthfeel with a clean finish. A little bitter in the finish but not overwhelmingly so. Light to med bodied. A nice beer with some great flavors."
"First time seeing this one today and curiously picked it up. Glad I did! Pours a nice cola like color - very dark with a rubyish hue to it. Excellent creamy head with terrific lacing left behind as the brew disappears. Smells of malty coffee and chocolate roastiness like a good stout in fact. Plus something else I can;t quite put my finger on, probably the rye?? Taste is of coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malts, slight hops, with a constant lingering rye undertone which stays with you after the sip is over and done with. Very dry. I could only take down a couple per sitting and move onto something else, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I am very pleasantly surprised at this blind purchase and will definitely purchase again, as well as try out other Founders brews. Recommended for stout fans."
"Appears an almost opaque cola ruby brown forms a large tan head leaves behind even specks of lacing. Aroma has some spicy rye and herbal hops along with a very nice mix of dark chocolate, dark cofee, and a touch of anise or mint like tones. Taste...a beautiful blend of chocolate powder, tea leaves, fresh ground cofee beans, spicy rye with herbal and earthy hop notes. Mouthfeel is Schwarzish light to medium body range smooth even carbonation. Drinkability...honestly challenging and drinkable an all day any season kinda beer great brew truly quality from Grand Rapids."
"Dark, coke-color with sticky, lace-inducing head. Aroma of yeast, burnt coffee beans and a strange quality (that I must assume is due at least in part to the rye) that reminds me of rising bread dough crossed with a pool liner. On the palate, zesty hops give way to sweet-and-spicy malts that possess an earthy, still-fermenting quality. Full carbonation pumps up the gravity artificially, but not unpleasantly -- I'd say the mouthfeel is actually the best aspect of this beer. Overall, this experiment in rye is interesting but not terribly drinkable, and not terribly memorable. Only OK."
"I won't critically review it at this point, but I will again, reiterate what I think of it... it's awesome. So chocolatey, so hoppy, with this twisted rye sensation. Imaaculately smooth. Ultimate drinkability! I have to raise my marks - this is soo good!"
"Very easy to drink! Not a heavy feel in mouth. Heck of a beer and I'll have to get some more!!"
"Had this on tap at Founders. Pours a dark black with a dark tan head, plenty of carbonation and looks inviting. Smells quite hoppy with burnt and rye notes. Taste is very hoppy for a darker beer, has plenty of rye, and a good deal of bite. This beer packs a strong punch. It has ok mouthfeel, I thought it hit me a bit hard for me to score it high for mouthfeel. That doesn't mean this beer wasn't delicious, because it was. I could enjoy this beer anytime and recommend it for hop fans or porter lovers. Enjoy!"
"This beer was really tasty. Oddly, I'd say that it had a homebrew quality about it. A touch syrupy, IMO. I loved it and could drink this one reguarly."
"One of the finest American beers I've had. Would love to try it on tap."
"Drinkability is good. Rye is sort of wasted here as it just isn't a major flavor component. A good porter but not really a notable rye beer."
"Comments  Thanks to skyhand for sharing this tasty rye gem. She nose I loves me sum rye!"
"This is another good offering from Founders. It doesn't have quite the complexity of the Red's Rye, but it is very smooth and, I dare say, more drinkable. It has the dark rye funk as well as a pleasnt nuttiness. It is very drinkable and easy to palate."
"Drinkability: I really enjoy a beer that stakes out its own turf and this beer clearly accomplishes that goal. Highly recommended!"
"Man, I was just psyched to try a Founders beer down in North Carolina. Thanks to Brent56 for allowing me to have a few tastes. This is a much better rye in my opinion than Terrapin Brewing. Mix of coffee and fruits with the rye on the nose and tongue. Nice bit of carbonation and lacing, more than I expected."
"I'll have to revisit once I've had more ryes. But for now, I can say it's worth a pit stop."
"I've had this on tap before, and the bottled version is just about as good as I remember it being on tap. Hopefully I'll be able to pick up another sixer of this next year."
"Pours out almost pitch black with a tall tan head. Some nice lace was left around the glass. Great aroma filled with nice bitter hops, plenty of rye and dark chocolate. Some lighter fruit notes and smokiness were there as well. Nice citric bitter hops bite up front before some chocolate sweetness evens it out. Nice and roasty with a bit of smoke an coffee. Nice rye bread bitter finish. Very unique and damn tasty stuff. Pretty thick and well carbonated. Very drinkable stuff and it goes down way to easily. I could drink this all day. I am kick myself now for only getting one sixer of this when I was in the area."
"It's not quite a stout, not quite a porter but all rye beer. I'm not sure if I'm crazy about it, but I love the idea of a dark rye beer."
"A nice crisp, easy drinking beer from Founders. Pours what appears to be a deep brown until it fills the glass, then total blackness - except for the tannish head. The smell of roasted malt is the stand out and a hint of rye (or am I just influenced by the name?). Notes of coffee on the tongue, some sweetness of chocolate, and a slight hop tingle at the end. A very good beer."
"This is an outstanding brew! Founder's again!! Some chocolatey mocha going on with some possible caramel and toffe, but light, very creamy and light. A definitely different brew. Some nice hops on the back end and a lot of mocha. A refreshing beer that washes down better than a porter and highly recommended."
"D- Interesting to say the least, this one really grows on you after a while. Dark, spicy, hoppy in a floral kind of way ... certainly not conventional but it works. I could see drinking this one on a regular basis to mix things up."
"D - high, its easy to put this back, this is my first rye beer, i look forward to having this more and try others"
"Drinkability is very solid but this beer is a little confused as to what it wants to be, IPA, rye or darker malt bomb. None of these are bad options just a little bit too much going on here as the amalgam doesn't quite do it for me."
"Pours a near pitch black with a slight off white colored head that held its retention well.aromas are unique chocolate with dry earth with a hint of sour rye faintly wich goes well with the chocolaty/earthy aromas.Starts out with some bitter chocolate with a lighter caramel note finishing with that light sourness with a hit of piney hop in the finish.Quite unique in its different flavors like that of a oatmeal stout finishing with the hit of rye and American hop,I really liked it will have again for sure."
"Dark in color-not quite black. Slight tan head. Low aroma though quite hoppy and sweet. Big malty flavor-very subtle roasted flavor. Slight graininess to it. Nice hop bitterness. Very nicely balanced throughout. Good body Very drinkable. Have wanted to try this for ages and am very impressed."
"Yet another excellent beer from the folks at Founders."
"Exceptional appearance. Black, pillow head..fantastic lacong. Hop notes...some malt presence..detracting was a hint of ""wet dog"" smell. A touch of sorness mentioned in the style was noted. A thick, slightly sweet flavor was the main characteristic. Mouthfeel is extremely chewy, just like (rye) bread. Mostly smooth, but a tad too chewy for my tASTE."
"Mouthfeel is slightly thin, with roasted malt, cocoa, and plums battling it out along the palate."
"Thanks again, Ern! My first beer from Founders didnt disappoint. Thumbs up!!"
"Medium to full body, well carbonated, this is another kick ass beer from Founder's"
"It pours a dark chocolate brown almost black with a nice head that disappears quickly. Nice lacing on the glass. The aroma is coffee notes and roasted malts. I can taste the rye, malts and hops all in a nice balanced way. This is a medium bodied brew that is very drinkable. Another great Founders brew!"
"The overall experience is quite refreshing. A presentation of roast, warm rye notes, slight dark malt astringency, and nice hops flavors. This is basically a pale ale with some rye and roasted malts thrown in to mix it up a bit. Nice style. Very, very drinkable and enjoyable."
"Typical dry rye finish that I like and look for, but that doesn't mean the flavors finish dry. They linger for quite awhile. Initially this one feels ""medium"" on the tongue. This is how I think rye beers should be. Drinkability is good. Lots of flavor. The dryness and the strong flavors might limit it to being a sipper. Nature of the beast I guess. But definately give it a shot should you have the opportunity."
"Poured what appeared to be black in color was actually dark brown color with ruby highlights through it. The head of foam was very small and tan in color. It however left plenty of lace throughout my pint glass. I noticed a huge helping of rye in the aroma along with some chocolate and coffee notes in the background. At some times I also noticed some hops in there as well too. The taste had plenty of dry rye in the front and along with some chocolate, malt, coffee and some hops in the background. The othere taste besides the rye were very subtle, but they did come through eventually. The mouthfeel was dry with a slight bitter chocolate aftertaste. I could only find a single of this, but I wish I could have found a six-pack of this. It's hard to imagine I only paid $1.35 for this. My first rye beer."
"Presentation: Packaged in a short twelve-ounce brown glass bottle with a pop-off crown, served in a Pilsener glass. Probably best enjoyed in cold weather."
"D: relatively light for such a dark beer and easy to put down. dont mistake the relative simplicity of this beer for a fault or brewer error. while not meant for a session, it is meant for easy drinking. right on Founders again, this is a very enjoyable and unique beer. cheers!"
"Has the strangely drying and addictive taste of Red's Rye (hops and slightly metallic twinges). I'm not totally sure on this one. Give me another sixer and i'll decide. It should also be mentioned that if you don't like hoppy stouts/dark beers just wait a few months on this one. It has died down in terms of hoppiness significantly in only a few months in the reefer."
"The rye lends a nice dryness to this beer. The hops balance it out perfectly. I really like this beer. Reminds me of a good imperial porter. So far I am impressed with Founders. Great work!"
"Finally a beer that competes with the Great Danes Black Moravian. I would label this as a Schwartz Bier rather than a Rye beer to be sure. A huge citric assault on your tongue and palate is followed by a deeply chocolate underbelly in this fantastically jet black brew. Dry and toasty as beer can be. Black as night. Just great. The mouthfeel is unbelievably assertive. The carbonation is extremely biting. Lots of fun and full flavored."
"Verdict- Tasty. Smooth and rich."
"Jet black with lots of creamy head. Boozy and roast stout aroma. Some chocolate. Very faint rye, nothing like Red's Rye.Creamy and well carbonated taste, toast, spice, nothing too intense. Buit of roast on aftertaste. Very drinkable. Thanks Dr. Jay."
"Quite aromatic. Hops, dark fruits and pumpernickel with hints of chocolate. Dark brown to black in color with creamy mocha head that is mostly diminishing. Fore is bitter and roasty with lots of black licorice notes. Some roasty and nutty asspects through the middle and more dark druits into the finish, but with a mostly bitter hoppy lingering flavor."
"Poured from a bottle with no date into an Goose Island Imp pint glass. A thick, firm, tan head sits on top of a black opaque body. Good lacing follows the body down the side of the glass. Chocolate and roasted malts greet the nose first backed up with some hop bite. Roasted malts with a hint of coffee and chalkiness along with a solid resiny bitterness cover the tongue. Good carbonation move things along. Nice long finish. I really like this beer. I would enjoy to drink this more regularly."
"Poured into a pint glass very dark brown, just bordering on black. Head was minimal with a sticky lace that lasted through till the end. Aroma consisted of light bitter coffee, mild chocolate and a malty bread odor. You can really taste the rye here, and it really does a justice to all of the other flavors going on in this beer. There are also hints of garlic here and there in this beer, giving it a big doughy character. Mouthfeel was as usual with all the Founder's beers ive tried so far, damn near perfect. It is really difficult to describe, but this beer's tastes seem to vanish yet linger after swallowing. The beer was medium bodied and extremely easy to drink. Another great offering from Founders. I'm trying to decide whether I prefer the red rye or this one...both are....beatific?"
"Drinkability is good on another winner from founders."
"Jet black color, with a small head of tan foam but generous lacing. Spicy, roasted dark cocoa aroma. Sharly roasted yet slightly sweet malt flavor, with a moderate amount of bitterness. The rye malt flavor is a bit hard to detect, adding a subtle peppery undertone which lingers a bit with the hops in the long aftertaste. Excellent body, perfectly smooth."
"Very nice feel to this beer, not heavy at all, leaves with a kinda dry hoprye feel in the mouth. Easy too drink, and with a abv of only 6.6%, I could put these down all night long. Founders continues too amaze me with their awesome selection of brews. A must try!!!"
"Quite the drinkable beer. I don't think it's quite as drinkable as Red's Rye, but it is much more complex. Both are admirable qualities in a beer, so I couldn't exactly say I enjoyed one over the other."
"D-This beer has tons of flavors going on in it and it is very enjoyable. The complexities would come through very nicely if drinking at varied temps throughout the night. This is a beer that is somewhat unique, but very delicious. Prost!"
"a very nice surprise in this one, quite unlike anything i've ever tasted. a very well crafted beer."
"This is a very interesting brew. Personally, I enjoyed it better than the Red's rye but I know that I'm in the minority. A well crafted unusual beer."
"Definitely a beer I could drink a lot of."
"Drinkability- Not my first choice for a session beer. But good for watching a though provoking movie by yourself."
"Another classy brew from Founders...I like the risk-taking. This beer pours a dark brown with very little light passing through. The smell is rich with dark malts and some aromatic hops. Taste is great! I find this to be very close to a porter in taste, but I also enjoy the crisp rye profile. The mouthfeel is bubbly. This is a nice one to quaff after shoveling the walk."
"Overall, this is a very drinkable beer. It is sharp and full flavored at the same time, with a quite distinctive taste."
"Pours a dark ruby brown/black, big tan head forms, sticky lace on the glass. Smell is fruit, citrus, rich malt, chocolate, floral hops, and licorice. Taste is chocolate, citrus and floral hops, licorice, and grainy coffee, with a dry bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with medium carbonation, very tasty. Thanks for the pickup DrJay."
"Excellent beer and great to revisit every once and awhile."
"Yeah, these are easy to drink. I'm usually a sipper, but this one goes down soooo gooood. Be careful out there."
"The body is medium to full. I am a lover of good bread as well as good beer and this brew was a real pleasure. I usually do not like a marked roasted presence in my beer and this came through with a pleasing mild presence. This is a good, drinkable beer. After drinking this, I will look for another example of a rye beer."
"A flat black porter like with a small tan head that quickly fell back. Smell of rye spice apple with soft roasty chocolate undertones and popping with citrus hops. The taste begins with the dominate rye flavors and receeds to unveil a slight malt sweetness and biter roastedness complimented well by the cirus hops. Good density in the mouth and an enjoyable experience."
"I would like to try this again, if I ever see it."
"Drinkability: Carbonation helps make this a very drinkable beer. This is a very nice beer to have a few with."
"Gentle pour yields small, diminishing head over a black body with faint purple highlights. Does retain a soft silk screen of foam. Nose is fruity and grapy, with tangy citric hops presence over some chocolatey roasted grains akin to English porter style. Very inviting nose. Taste is heavily roasted with a faint grape flavor, and a blast of bitter hops. Very unique. A bit like an American porter. I think the rye is adding the fruity/grape brightness as well as some more characteristic rye bread aftertaste. Theres some chocolate going on beneath all that. Surprisingly goodI was expecting to be disappointed, but this stands its ground among dark beers, with a unique twist. Mouthfeel is a bit towards the thinner side of things, with fairly pronounced carbonation, but not in a disappointing way. Overall, a very pleasant surprise, and well worth trying for a unique beer experience."
"I'm on the fence with this one but would probably hesitate to go with it again. IMO, for anyone else it's worth a try if you happen to come across it."
"Notes: The mouthfeel seems a bit thin, but since this one is primarily rye and not a porter or a stout, I don't know exactly where to place it. Regardless, there is depth in both aroma and taste here and it's definitely worth a sample."
"Black with ruby highlights. Thin, dark tan head with good retention and some lacing. Chocolatey, roasted malt aroma is balanced by strong citrus and pine hoppiness. Slight spiciness as well. Malt sweetness and chocolate kick off the flavour, followed quickly by leafy and citrus hops. The rye imparts an oily spice to the malt towards the end. Bitterness builds through the finish, but stops short of being aggressive. Lingering hops and a hint of alcohol warmth. Moderate carbonation, slight stickiness with full body and light dryness. Alcohol warmth grows as it warms up. A unique combination of flavours, not something you run into on a regular basis."
"Pours out deep black, with a few ruby highlights. Aroma is faint, slightly coffee like. Taste is hoppy upfront, or is that spicy from the rye?, but it leads to a deep coffee taste in the beer as well. Finish is clean and neat. Mouthfeel is a touch thin, but this is one of my favorite rye beers out there."
"Mouthfeel is substantial and carbonation is creamy. Very drinkable. I could be easily fooled into thinking this is a porter."
"Pours black of course, but held to the light you can see ruby red hues. Nice tan head that didn't stick around long enough, but lacing that went all the way down. For some reason I can't detect the rye in the beers flavor. I have tried Founder's Red's Rye and the rye is evident. I have even brewed with rye and can easily tell its a rye beer. Perhaps the chocolate malts are strong enough to disguish the spiciness of the rye malt. That being said, this beer is to me a cross of an American brown and a porter. Chocolately, slightly smoky, crisp like a black lager (is this how the rye is presenting itself?). Aroma is warm and of alcohol. Crisp mouthfeel. Drinkability is nice since this beer is not too heavy."
"Smokey, coffee, burnt nuts dominate this beer. You can really taste the grains in this beer. I can imagine this beer going nicely with a pungent cheese plate."
"Pours pitch black with a couple fingers of off-white bubbly head with great lacing. Smell is a big surprise, piney/floral hops and citrus dominate the nose. Taste confirms the baffling nose, intense bitter hops, bitter rye malts with uncanny subtle toasty, bready, coffee undertones. A beer that pours like a stout, but smells, tastes, and feels like a hoppy IPA? Quite a trick, it's amazing how dark this is without considerable roasted malts or coffee flavors. However they did it, kudos....this is a damn tasty Rye and superior to their Red's Rye due to those mystifying undertones that compliment the hoppiness. A truly unique beer."
"Thanks Rick for trucking a bottle back from Indiana!"
"Overall = A strong kick in the ass type of beer that I can definitely respect. I think it works in the right situation. I certainly wouldn't turn one down again and look forward to sampling more rye beers."
"Overall it is pretty good. I think Founders has better, but I wouldn't pass this over."
"If you like rye bread and beer then try this great offering from Founders. Founders have done it again with their black rye beer. Keep up the great work!!!"
"overall: This beer just falls under the interesting category and I probably wont be seeking it out in the future."
"In appearance, Black Rye almost lives up to its name. It is, in fact, a very dark brown, with ruby highlights. Nice chocolate-colored head and lacing. Looks like a stout, and smells like one too, roasted coffee along with the promised rye. Tastes hoppier than the smell, a floral hoppiness, which contrasts well with the chocolate and coffee malt flavor. Creamy mouthfeel. One of the most interesting beers I've had. I think it's interesting how the rye, though part of the malt, has a hop-like character, and I think that putting it in a sweet, malty, stoutish beer really showcases that well. Fascinating."
"Overall, I would add this beer to my favorites list, I wish I bought a six pack rather than a single. Much like drinking a stout, but with a strong rye presence. Would make a great beer to enjoy on a cold winter day."
"Tasty brew, but I couldn't drink it fast enough on my own to have bought a growler. I'll have to split a growler or stick to the bottle, which overall I don't thimk I liked as much. Seemed less like a stout and more like a black ale in the bottle."
"this is my first try at a founders product and i am now afraid to try any of the others. it's like this: once you've hooked up with heidi klum you might as well kill yourself, 'cause it's not going to get any better"
"Very good, and only $1.33 for the 12 oz bottle - quite the bargan. Glad I have a couple more for tonight."
"Pours an opaque black color with a large tan head. The aroma is very complex. Roasted malt, coffee, and all together tangy. The taste is as complex as the aroma. A large roasted malt and coffee presence is off set by tangy hops. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied. with lots of carbonation. Overall, this is a very good and interesting brew. Definitely recommended."
"A little hoppier than I would like. Couldn't drink more than one of these, and not sure I would have another anytime soon, but respectable for what it is."
"overall its a good find. dont like it as much as the red rye, but other then the use of rye, i dont think theres anything that should be similar with the two. Im guessing this is 6-8 months old since its a winter seasonal beer. I would really like to taste this fresh and see if theres a little more carbonation and hop presense that comes out."
"Black Rye isn't quite the equal of Red's Rye, but then few beers are in my estimation. It's still an outstanding concoction that provides the added bonus of chocolate and smoke in addition to its rye malt spiciness. A good indication of a beer's drinkability for me is how full the glass is when I've completed my review. As I type, my pint glass is empty. 'Nuff said. Thanks once again to deejaydan for more Founders excellence."
"Quite a substantial and fulfilling brew. Nothing run of the mill about this one. Somehow adds some sophistication to any beer fridge without being snobby."
"Drinkability...Tasty but not overpowering, full but not too filling. Would be even better on a cold night in front of a roaring bonfire. Even in the summer, I'll take another..."
"The mouthfeel is good. Swish it around a bit. Also the label sends you back to the AC/DC days we've all experienced at one point and time. I recommend this beer."
"Thanks to trbeer for the tremendous heeping stash of samples!"
"I didnt really know what to expect when i popped open this beer, seeing as how this is my first rye beer. The appearance surpassed expectations, and poured a solid black with slight ruby highlights, and a thick tan head that retains extremely well. Aroma reminds me of rogue shakespeare stout; chocolate, coffee, roasted barley, and a nice dose of citric and floral hops with a sour background. Taste begins with flavors of bittersweet chocolate, coffee, fig, sourdough bread and oily, resiny hops. There is a cloying sweetness reminiscent of blackstrap molasses that is quickly overtaken by the hops. This is my first rye beer, and i really enjoy it but find it not that different from just an ordinary stout, or perhaps a porter due to the hoppiness. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with moderate carbonation and a crisp, bitter finish. The alcohol becomes more noticeable as it warms but it's still surprisingly drinkable."
"Has the roasted malt flavor that is found in really good porters. There's a good dose of dry hops that hang on through the finish, but the rye taste is there from begining to end. Has a malty, stout-like mouthfeel. I could sip this all night."
"This beer is black (lest anyone worry about misleading labels) with a medium dark beige head and thin lacing. Toasted malt, chocolate and a bit of hops in the nose. Medium-bodied and nutty with lots of malt and hops flavors. The finish is dry and grassy with a nice rye aftertaste. As with most Rye beers I have tried, I enjoyed this."
"A nice offering from the guys at Founder's. Poured out to a dark brown/nearly black color with a great head that was the color and consistancy of a well made latte. Aromas of rye, hops, barley and raw cocoa were noted. Taste was well crafted, and slightly complex, with a roased dry malt malt flavor, with hints of hops and grain. Finished slighly bitter, and went down relatively easy. I would drink this again, no problem. Recommended."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1 1/2"" tan head over the clear deep reddish brew. Lots of little floaties in here, and the carbonation has them moving all around. Head is heavy froth, and lasts throughout the drinking experience, with foamy lacing prevalent. Aroma is toasty burnt rye. Taste starts with that same toasted grain, and balances well with some piney hoppiness. The rye flavor lingers on the tongue, even after swallowing. As it warms, chocolate joins the party as well. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both great. Nice one here, give it a try."
"Very dark and deep color with a slight head. A very bready smell with the obvious roast. A lot of hop bitterness and flavor right up front. The high hopiness and rye create a dry and almost astringent hop flavor. This would be bad if it weren't for the roasted malt in the background. This is one of those beers that breaks all the rules. There is a real bready and coffee flavor that is delicious."
"Strongly recommended."
"Drinkability is great yet another great beer from the folks at Founders, when they expand in 2006 can only hope the Dist area includes VA or better yet a cap free NC. Thanks again to merlin48 for another fine beer."
"Pours a deep brown, mahogany liquid that can barely be penetrated by light. Thick tan foamy head, very good retention with patches of lace sticking to the sides of the glass at the end. Roasty nose, along with mocha. Some hop aroma, probably combined with some rye. Nice roasty malt flavor, good amount of hop flavor with some bitterness. Finishes with a fair amount of rye flavor. Somewhat dry at the end. Rye is not overwhelming, but seems to go fairly well with this beer. Medium body, maybe a bit thin. Low carbonation. A very interesting and satisfying beer. Another great offering from Founders."
"12 ounce bottle. Thanks ncbrewerbun!"
"Pours deep mahogany, looks black until you hold it up to the light. Foamy khaki colored head crops up immediately. It looks like a stout. Close your eyes and inhale and you'd think its a pale ale. Lots of clean citrous and floral hops hit the snout, as well dark malts. Taste starts off a little light and crisp, with surprisingly strong hops. Suddenly, you are rushed by huge bitter chocolate and roasted grain. Some coffee is there as well. Sharp rye characters are present, but subtle. Moutheel is pretty full and creamy from the large malt bill, but the assertive hops keep things crisp. I wonder if you made a black and tan using an IPA if it would turn out like this. It is the best of both worlds. There is the huge malt profile of a good stout, but they wonderfully hoppy qualities of an IPA. This beer really took me by surprise."
"A very dark but highly transparent brown, with a good bit of crimson highlights. Large offwhite head, seems to want to stick around for a while. Smell is great. Very bready, notable hints of rye, backed up by roasted chocolate malts and molases. Taste is even better. I love the taste of rye in beer... before this one all I'd come across was Bear Republic's Hop Rod Rye, which is one of my all time favorites. This has similar rye characteristics, nice and spicy, but also has a good deal of robust chocolate malts and burnt bitter coffee in the end, almost like a nice smoked porter. Nice hoppy bite in the finish. This beer is dark, but unlike the big huge stouts and porters this beer has a really great mellow mouthfeel, medium full, and oh so smooth and creamy. Wow, I need to find more rye beers."
"Surprising darkness in the color...much more sinister than expected (however, it DOES say ""black"" in the label....). Aggressive pour yields a finger-thick layer of tan-colored head that is ""big-bubbled"" and sticky. Good lacing of the glass. Aromas are quite similar to that of a well-hopped stout: large, lots of toasty malt, and a strong hop presence. Flavor was fine, with a hefty amount of creamy mouthfeel. Hoppy from the get-go, with a bit of chocolate moving in during the middle, and finishing with a pronounced dryness. Drinkable. Another successful rye beer for me."
"12 ounce bottle. This beer pours out black with a light brown head. Roasted malt aroma together with fresh hops. Big malty taste up front. Bitter coffee, bread, and spice. Finishes with a nice fresh hop flavor. I like the use of the rye. Great complexity and balance. Medium mouthfeel and good drinkability. This is another good creation from Founders, one of the best brewers of unique beers around."
"So here I am, with another founders brew in hand (thanks MJR). This brewery is pretty kick ass, and this brew is no exception. Dark cola-brown/bordering on black with a big old three finger head of tannish foam. Carbonation is lost in the opaqueness of this brew. The head has some big bubbles in it though. Carbonation is smooth. Aroma is good, more green, hoppy stout like than anything else. The rye is there, but it is in the background. The taste is great. Well blended, smooth, and it even tastes aged? I taste some rye, fresh hops, a bit of chocolate, coffee, and hints of herbs as well. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and drinkability is very good. A masterful rye beer from a masterful brewery."
"Very tasty, easy to drink beer.  The rye leaves it just spicy enough.  Slightl sweet.  Nice dark color, solid carbonation, yet thin enough to drink this all night.  Another nice offering from Founder's."
"Mouthfeel was moderately good, and I would have more were it offered to me without hesitation."
"Full side of medium in the mouth. Nice malt sweetness and richness balanced almost perfectly by the bitterness from the hops and dark malts. Very long. Nicely carbonated to give a velvety mouthfeel. Great beer."
"This is a beer that is alot like a great porter or stout. The head is 4"" thick and climbing right out of the glass. Great head retention afterward. The lacing holds from the original mark and runs all the way down the inside of the glass (and outside if you would let it). The nose is like creamy milk chocolate and black coffee. The color is.. well.. Black.. although that may be stating the obvious, when held up to the light you can see reddish highlights breaking through. It is heavily malted, yet remarkably smooth and drinkable. I keep searching for the hops in the nose, and there is something green there.. but it becomes more obvious in the taste. Just a touch of bitterness. A good all around brew, really."
"D- This is a very interesting beer. It has a big hops taste that blends with the spiciness of the rye. I was expecting more malt or at least more roasted malt characteristic in this beer. It is a nice beer but I would just like to see a few more complex flavors or more depth to the flavors that are there."
"Another good offering from Founders"
"Pours a deep garnet color, topped by a moderate tan head that gradually fades to a thin ring of foam. Sweet malt aroma with little else. Flavor is powerful, with a sharp, dry flavor presumably from the rye. Also a good bit of black malt flavors are present as well. Dark chocolate and red wine flavors creep in a bit later. Decent amount of bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel is fairly smooth and creamy up front, but still has an edgy feel to it on the finish. It's fairly unique in that it starts oily and finishes rather dry. Drinkability is good. I could have a couple, but I think this is a beer that could be one to ""suit your mood"" rather than be an everyday session beer."
"Thanks to clvand0 for sharing this with me a few weeks back. The beer poured a slightly rubied deep dark brown, almost black color with a finger of head that fell ot coat the beer. The nose was dark and roasty, with a bit of the spiceyness from the rye. The flavor had rich coffee tones with a slight creamyness. The bitter in the coffee flavor was really nice. The feel was moderate with a moderately strong carbonation. I could definately sit down to a few of these. Founders has not let me down yet. Very well built."
"Another Founders acquisition courtesy of brewedlyhooked13, and a fine one it is. Pours dark and opaque into the pint glass, ruby mahogany when backlit. Creamy tan head is two inches tall and retains well, leaving enormous splotches of lace all over the glass. Aroma begins with hoppy spruce and grapefruit, with dark roasty espresso notes and rye bread crust quick to follow. Mouthfeel is silky rich, almost full bodied, with tingly spicy hops and rye tickling the palate. The taste is complex, with bitter and acidic dark roasty malts, pine cone hops, spicy rye grain, and rye bread notes. Delicious flavors mingle all over the palate, and are never overly bitter. Wow! This is one tasty brew. Exceptional balance. This is just about the perfect beer, with outstanding aroma, appearance, taste, and mouthfeel. A sublime sipping experience that is immensely pleasant. This is one of those beers I would choose to take to a deserted island, in mass quantities. I admit to being a fan of rye beers, and this is probably the best one I've sampled. Another big winner from Founders."
"Good medium bodied mouthfeel and carbonation...very porter like in body. This is an incredibly enjoyable, tasty brew that I could easy see myself sitting down to a few of. Somewhat reminds me of Alpha Klaus in the flavor profile. Cheers to Founders for another winner!"
"This beer poured a very dark brown/black color with hints of red near the edges and with creamy, tan foam that settled flat, but clung to the glass from the edges a little bit. The smell was malty with spicy hops, but was a modest aroma. The taste was malty with a rye malt bite, together with spicy hops. There was a touch of caramel, and a very hoppy finish. The mouthfeel was smooth but sharp due to the hops and the rye. The body was medium with good carbonation. This was a good, very hoppy rye beer. Or was it a rye IPA?"
"I can say that this is definately interesting. I'm not too sure how well the often burnt flavors meld with the citrusy punch of the hops, but it's quite easy to take on. Not my favorite from Founders, but definately another solid brew."
"Picked this up on my last trip to Cincinnati. Pours a very dark color with a moderate head that sticks around a while and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma is subtle with hints of rye and lots of dark malts. The flavor doesn't have much rye character - more of a slightly light stout. But it makes for a good stout. Thick body and easy to drink, but only a hint of rye in the flavor. Still tasty."
"The 'darkness imprisoning me' hits my tongue and I taste chocolate malts along with the rye. Tastes similar to a mocha java stout in my humble pie eating opinion. It feels medium bodied, decently carbonated. I think I could have a few of these but it is more of a single serving beer. Another good brew by Founders."
"""Black is Back"" indeed."
"Dark brown with orange highlights and a medium tan colored head. The aroma has a nutty-sweet character that the rye usually brings accented by more malty sweetness (dates), and a mild doughy back. The nutty component is there in the flavor too. A bright citrus hop flavor cuts through the malty sweetness to enliven the flavor. The rye leaves a definite after taste of walnuts and a slight bitterness. Not unpleasant, just there. The mouth feel is very smooth. I came to enjoy rye beers through some of the rye IPAs out there. I think the hoppier beers accent the rye better than the extra malt in this beer."
"Generally, I love the attempt by the brewer to make and market this beer. It's a good beer with interesting and complex flavors that's certainly worth having on hand for people to explore what's great about craft brews."
"You know, I could probably have a few more of these. I just see it as more of a dessert type beer. It has the potential, but I would not choose this particular brew for an extended excursion. Definitely a treat to keep on hand though."
"Pours a light tan, two finger head, fades slowly and leaves a ton of lace. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Color is deep red almost black. Nose is coffee. Starts and finishes with a burnt coffee flavor, the hops are always there with a slight hoppy after taste. Good winter beer. $1.80 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, MA."
"pours a nearly opaque black, somewhat thinner than expected. The head is a dirty brown that has a nice lacing on the sides of my glass. The dry hopping of this one is evident. This beer smells of burnt malts and hops, charcoal and pine, quite different. The taste on this one is quite piney upfront. A blast of coffee and chocolate come from the dark grains. The rye is also evident in this one. The mouthfeel is kind of thin, but I wouldnt expect anything else from a rye beer. I could probably drink quite a few of these, but probably wouldnt. This beer is reminiscent of a dry hopped porter with a lighter body. A different beer that I am glad I tried, another good one from Founders."
"Another great beer from Founders...I would highly recommend this beer."
"Thanks to cokes for another Founder's sample."
"An outstanding winter drinker to have on hand. It pours a dark ruby (black) with a dark tan head. Lace is web-like, not tight but holds true to the glass. The aroma is malty with hints of cold coffee. The taste is dark toasted malt with solid hints of rye. You also get flavors of coffee, bakers chocolate, biscuit & pumpernickle bread. A nicely balanced shot of hop rounds things out. The mouth is left slightly dry with a lingering toasted feel. A good steady beer that does not change much as it warms. Easy on the mouth for a dark brew, and easy to have another."
"Hurrah, Black Rye, ..."
"This is another beautiful creation. Wow."
"Calm black hue, with some bright red wine highlights; an evaporating tan head. The nose is subtle, some chocolate, roasted malts and espresso are easily detected, though. A burnt malt body, black licorice and dark coffee beans are rather tasty and blend in well to the value of this medium bodied beverage. As it warms, it gets better, a sweetening malt dominated body with some rye and cereal tasting. The warming also brings out some nice earthy hops, which are not noted until the last few ounces are left, dont matter, this is a winner, an incredible winter seasonal, a rye stout?"
"...a classic rendition of extreme, American-style porter."
"from the bottle. poured a reddish brown, with a light tan head. aroma bitter chocolate, toffee, yeast, hops. flavor, toffee. bitter sweet chocolate, hints of caramel, a nice bitterness, some hops and malts and this one after the breakfast stout, so this one was a little weaker in the flavors but still a very good beer."
"I'd almost describel this as a dark IPA. This is a fun beer to try. I found it to be a unique brew and would certainly recommend it."
"Pours a nice deep, dark brown with a thick, pillowy light tan head. Dark malt aromas, along with a healthy dose of rye in the nose. Some hoppiness noticable. Roasted malt flavors dominate, but once again the rye component is very noticable. Hops add a nice bitterness and spiciness to the palate and finish. Flavorful mouthfeel, but surprisingly light, thanks to the adequate carbonation and the hops. A very nice beer. Drinkable, but not a session beer for me. The combination of rye, hops, and dark malts makes this one worth trying."
"Many thanks to Spiledriver for the goods."
"Black body that is barely cola-colored at the thinnest parts around the glass. Frothy tan head that hangs in there for a very long time. Citrus hop nose with roasty notes and sweet malt underpinnings. Beautifully crafter beer. Great roasted malt flavors, bittersweet chocolate, and a little sweetness brings up the rear. Moderate yet fine hop bitterness which keeps everything very clean. It kind of reminds me of Storm King (because of the bitterness) but without the fruitiness of the hops and depth of malt. OK, its not Storm King, but I would call this an imperial stout because Im not getting much rye besides from suggestion. Yeah, I guess a little as it warms. Very good mouth feel from creamy carbonation and medium body. Im impressed more and more by these guys. I would definitely buy this if it were available in Jersey."
"Damn, I'm spoiled to be a Michigander. We've got some great brews here and Founders is in the top 3 as far as I'm concerned. Comparable to the quality of the other Underdog, Bear Republic. Just another wonderful brew from a world-class brewery. Another exceptional brew from Michigan. Highly recommended!"
"Has a very nice flavor profile, and I wouldnt mind having a few. Think passing current convention and mellowing out the hops could improve it upon. Still, it is a very nice beer. If I could find it in MD, it would be sampled quite often. Id like to try it as a compliment to nice, fresh pumpernickel with spicy mustard, onions, and liverwurst."
"Beer that has some interesting aspects, but could have done with more rye and less hops."
"This is a beer not easily defined by labels. This tastes almost like a combination of Stout & Wit, even though I'm sure the spiciness comes from the rye. Founder's has come up with good beer. If you like stouts, porters, or wit beers, give it a shot."
"Smells like rye and pumpernickel with a distant, muddled aroma of nutella and a sort of pale ale citric quality. A certain milky quality to it -- chocolatey, sweet, creamy up front. You can certainly get a feel for the rye in the dark, pumpernickel aroma and flavor. Slides into a bone dry hoppiness. Piney and citric, the finish dominates, and while it's cleansing, it's abrupt and disjointed. Like a darker, more chocolatey west coast pale ale. I feel like the beer itself is an original, but the concept is merely following the herd -- more hops, more hops, more hops. I appreciated the crispness of it all during the first bottle, but after that, it got a little grating."
"Dark reddish brown almost black color with decent creamy head that leaves lacing in my glass. Chocolate and pine aromas, chocolate, oatmeal and rye bread flavors. Medium bodied with a creamy, smooth mouthfeel, finishes clean. Very tasty and drinkable almost reminds me of an oatmeal stout."
"Anyways onto the beer. It pours a dark brown nearing black in color with crimson highlights when held to light. The head is a mocha tan color and a little small in size but it holds well. Lacing is minimal. The aroma is strong on the bready rye notes. It kind of reminds me of oatmeal. The taste to me is very similar to their Chocolate Rye Porter. Except this time the rye is more dominant and the chocolate is more subdued but those are the two main flavors. An earthy hop flavor lies in the background. I notice the hops but the thickness and roasted flavors in the body hold them back from coming foward. The finish has more of a grainy roasty astringency to it. Like most Founder's beer this isn't the smoothest but the flavors draw me in to continue to drink more. I really liked this beer and it improved the more I drank it. Definitely recommended."
