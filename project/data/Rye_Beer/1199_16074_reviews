"Invested in a full 1/2 barrel for my home tap.  Love this stuff.  Great balance of bitter, body and unique flavor of rye.  Nice maroon color and head that creates a nice lacing.  Avoid if you don't like rye.  But if that is good for you, it is a great alternative to super hoppy west coast ipas."

"Pours a transluscent pale reddish-copper. Smells of grapefruit zest and piney hops. Tastes like a grapefruit IPA with a malty rye backbone. Well balanced, clean bitterness at the end. Very drinkable, not too sweet, something that could be my new go-to. Will need more for further testing. 4.45/5"

"12oz bottle poured into tulip. Murky reddish copper body with a one inch khaki head that settles to a cap and ring. Patchy lacing throughout the drink. Aroma is grapefruit, herbal hop, rye spice, and caramel malt. Taste is light malty sweetness all the way through, piney and floral bitterness, spicy rye bite, and some citrus fruit. Medium body, creamy texture, moderate carbonation, and a bitter spicy finish."

"Pours a thick reddish mahogany with solid tan head. Hops, pepper notes from the rye, and sweet malts on the nose. Taste is bittering hops up front and on the sides mingling with the rye giving it that zing of white pepper and an even body. Malt sweetness on the back makes it nicely rounded with bittering hops coming through on the aftertaste. Many love this brew, I personally love rye brews, yet the hops are a bit strong to my liking. Hop heads dream."

"This is an amazingly heady malt bomb, packed with rye spiciness, superb malt sweetness, and well-tempered hop bitterness and bite. From the incredible sticky, brittle sheets of lacing on the glass to the evil malt sweetness and sugary feel spiked with a delicious rye pep in the flavor and the nearly decadent pleasure of the heavy, rich mouthfeel, this is one winner of a beer. An exceptional find and even better drinking experience."

"Nice frothy head with great retention and sip analyzing lacing. Aroma of straight up marshmallow. Taste started incredibly strong with the caramel marshmallow overpowering everything, as I went along some hop/malt presence became more apparent but the caramel remained throughout. This beer has an incredible rich feel that is only enhanced by the caramel taste. Very interesting."
"Pours a nice reddish amber with decent head. Despite it's light color, this thing pours nice and thick! Very surprised with the hefty body. Smells clean and piney typical of an IPA. Taste is wonderful. Nice clean and refreshing but not thin. Has wonderful mouthfeel and nice and creamy with no bitterness. A great fantastic beer."
""
""
"Raw and somewhat rustic in taste, it nearly earthen taste from rye and barley offers a moderate semblance of balance even though the ale's finish is malty-dry and deeply resinous with torn pine needles, evergreen and citrus. Both its medium body and Its long bitter-sweet finish is the perfect companion for American cheeseburgers."

"Pours a deep, slightly cloudy red, drifting towards brown. A thick creamy light tan head lasts throughout the beer and leaves nice lacing. The aroma is soft, but not lacking in character, with distinct hops notes of floral and citrus. The taste is excellent, with strong malt flavors balanced superbly by the hops and with a nice peppery notes on the finish provided by the rye. The body is just the right weight and there is a wonderful silky feeling and crisp finish. This is a great rye IPA."

"Very nice beer. Refreshing with different characteristics. Rye IPAs don't always work but this one shines among its competitors."
"This is a very unique beer that is excellent on occasion. This is certainly not a heavy beer, but for me it is difficult to drink a lot of these in one sitting. It is a very nice change in pace having a rye beer every once in while because of the flavor that it brings the table."
""
""
""
""
""
"Great color: dark, redish amber color. White head thats moderately thin. Scents of hops came through right away. It definitely has some fruit notes as well. It has a light earthy taste as well. Almost more like grass as opposed to those heavy earth tones. The hops taste lingers yet it finishes off nicely. Very flavorful and a great overall IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""

"Overall: Enjoyable with a lot of great qualities, well balanced, sweet but still has some bitter elements"
"This brew offers lots of malt, hops, rye, and some grapefruit, but just a little too much bitterness especially on the after taste. The bitterness almost leaves a flavor that makes the beer unenjoyble and I am a big IPA drinker so I am usually used to this... This one just doesn't do it for me like the other Founders IPAs do."
""
"Deep red in colour. Thin, white head. This beer was once called a Rye Pale Ale. As much as I like IPA's, I wish it had remained as such. I feel it's a bit too bitter to be able to appreciate the rye in the recipe. I've had others that are more subtle. Maybe our friends south of the border are, in fact, too into their bitter beers. Still a very good beer, nonetheless. Good mouthfeel, just overpowered by the 70 IBU's."
""
""
"In terms of India Pale Ale's this beer is not overly bitter. A very nice red color lives up to the name and its welcoming aroma of peaches leads to an easy drink, especially for fans of bitter beers. For those trying to delve into the IPA world this is a good place to start."
"Medium mouth feel with malty hints. Very strong bitter notes that leave a not so enjoyable after taste. Has a very welcoming appearance and smell but was very thrown off by the flavor. Not my favorite beer to taste, but a decent IPA for what it's worth. Doesn't leave an enjoyable mouth feel and the bitter taste lacks enthusiasm."
"This is a beer caramel in color. Once you bring it up to your nose you can smell hints of citrus. Once you taste this beer you can taste the hops as well as some slight citrus flavors. This also has a good amount of hops, but does have a very strong aftertaste."
""
""
""
"This beer was poured from my growler into a regular pint glass. Pour was amber color with a little lightness to it, very nice. My pour had a fairly small white head. Smell as happy with some grapefruit and a little lemony. Taste was similar to that as it was flavorful and happy with a citrus kick but decently balanced. This was my first time having this beer and I was very happy with it. When available on tap, I will definitely get again. Solid brew from founders"
""
"Overall - Wonderful, get some of this one fresh and it won't disappoint...if you like grapefruit, it is seriously a gulp-able brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Evan though this is 8 months old, it is still flavorable, with the rye predominating. The reduced presence of hops could be because of the age of the beer."

"O- A RIPA fully realized. However they've honed this recipe is very impressive since a lot of Rye beers miss the mark for whatever reason. This one has a good balance and the flavors aren't overly accentuated."

"O- Founders makes some of my favorite brews and and this one is no slouch. Well balanced including an interesting hop transformation from nose to mouth. I typically enjoy rye IPA's and this one rates up there with the best."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a well balanced rye beer. It is not as heavy on the rye and peppery spices as other rye's I have had but the strong sweet malt backbone makes up for that. It could be said that this is a rye IPA for those who don't like to be overwhelmed by rye."

"O - Once labeled Red's Rye PA, the addition of one single letter suits the beer a little more. Red's Rye IPA is a hop-and-rye forward beer that doesn't focus directly on one ingredient or the other but melds the two in harmony as grapefruit, earthy, and floral attributes blend with the spicy rye over biscuity, bready malt for a superb balance considering it's listed IBUs. At a fair 6.6%, this full-flavored beer packs a wallop without walloping the imbiber; one hell of a combination!"

"O: I want more...so smooth, velvety, spicy, dry, all the notes I like in rye whisky but toned down a bit."
""
""
""
""
"This ale pours a deep mahogany color with a very small Head that lasts just a minute or so. The aroma is all rye, malt, and spice. There is little to no hint of hops or of the ipa qualities of this beer. It's Sips dry and a little rough with a bit of alcohol bite on the tail end. The body is a bit thin for this type of ale. The flavor is definitely rye and a lot of malt. Almost more like a porter than an ipa. There is virtually no hoppiness at all. Overall this is a very good beer (still rarely disappointed by Founders). It's just not what I expect from a rye ipa. Hits on the rye notes but not on the ipa ones."

"This is a great beer! Deep amber color, grainy sweet carmelized malty smell, and tastes of earthy grains, slightly citrus with a hint of dry hops. Very enjoyable, improves dramatically as it warms. Continues to reveal new subtle flavors with each drink."

""
""

"O: Excellent drinkability. Absolutely delicious PA. My 7th Founders which gets an above 4 evaluation. What else can I say about this brewery?"

""

"O- This thing is a treat. Exceeded all expectations."
""
"Amber colored with a bit of a red tint. A thin off white wisp of a head covers most of the top of this beer. Good clarity. I get a nice combo of rye and pine like hops in the nose. The front of the palate I get more of the rye and then a nice bit of bitterness from the hops kick in and remain in the aftertaste. The beer has some moderate carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: overall I find this the perfect beer!"
"O: Enjoyable and will definitely be one or two four packs a year. Little pricey at the 4 pack format but unique and very little out there is like it. Best right after release as many contend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a solid beer, nice balance between sweetness and bitterness. The rye and hops complement each other well. Definitely reminds me of an imperial red ale, even though its only 6%."

"served in a chilled, but not frosted pint glass. poured out sort of thick looking. reddish hue, cloudy. Formed a medium head that settled to a film. streaked the sides of the glass. Smell was great. Citrus of an unknown variety, pine, black pepper. Truly a treat to my nostrils. Taste was surprising. I'm an oddball. I do not typically enjoy rye, RIPA's. This brew was a pleasant surprise. Earthy, hops, gentle bite of citrus during the drink, with a hint of bitterness in the finish. Otherwise dry. Mouthfeel was above average. some carbonation. Outstanding rye beer."

"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled on 8/19/2013. Pours lightly cloudy reddish orange color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of huge grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, orange zest, orange rind, caramel, floral, pine, spicy rye, and floral earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus hops with moderate caramel/rye malts; and great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, orange zest, orange rind, caramel, floral, pine, spicy rye, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pineapple, citrus zest, caramel, floral, pine, rye, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Awesome balance and complexity of citrus hop and moderate rye/caramel malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, smooth, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic rye pale ale! All around awesome complexity and balance of citrus/pineapple hops and moderate caramel/rye malts; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A highly enjoyable offering."
""
""
""
"Poured a crystal clear burnt orange in to a Dogfish head tulip. Moderate foam that left nice streaks down the side of the glass. It smells spicy with the hops giving off a citrus/pine scent undercut by the rye and a slight caramel note. The taste is full. The hops and rye mingle nicely and are balanced nicely by the toasty malt base. The aftertaste is a peasing bitterness that brings the next sip in quick succession. Low to medium carbonation suits the taste well. Overall, a very good offering from Founders."

"Pours amber with a dark ruby red tint. Fair head that laces well but fades fairly quickly. Light medium body with a hoppy nose. The rye flavor tends to be overpowered by the hops, assuming a more background presence in the flavor profile. A bit less hops would improve the balance and bring the rye more forward. Slight, but pleasant, hop bitterness as an aftertaste while the rye becomes more pronounced. Another excellent Founder’s product."

""
""

"Really outstanding take on an IPA. Keep in mind I just drank a Sculpin before this which I consider one of the best IPA's there is. The Rye just adds a little something, a little breadyness, a little something different...but still really good. It has all the aromas you expect from a great IPA, Grapefruit, Mango, Pine. The malt bill seems much higher than a typical IPA so you get a really good malt sweetness to counter the bitter hops. Dry finish only leaves you wanting another sip. If you haven't had it, try it."

"UPDATE 7/14/14: Had a bottle I bought on the cheap at Spirit Haus in Amherst about ten days ago. It was dated 8/13/13! Too weak to see with the naked eye in normal light in the store. It's smooth but not all that hoppy. Very good, but not great. Worth what I paid ($2)."

Enough body to stand up to colder weather and heartier foods, but refreshing enough to fit in with hot weather and light foods as well."

"O: Founder's did it again with releasing this take on a rye PA. by far the most refreshing and crisp rye PA I have had. The only thing I wish is a little more predominant rye flavor but that discrepancy ends up being a strength in this offering."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a deep bronze color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of hops, rye. Taste is somewhat bitter, spicy, hops, rye, a bit of citrus, very dry at the finish. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall this is a solid beer."

"I am unfortunately going from memory. I would be all in favor of this beauty achieving year round status. The heartless bastards at Founders have made it a seasonal brew for some unknown an obviously insufficient reason. Had it on tap at Founders brew pub which was a slice of heaven, but by the bottle it is extremely close to fresh tap taste. Founders is awesome and I highly recommend this heavenly brew to just about anyone as the maltiness and hop finish are sublimely and superbly blended to achieve party in your mouth status...it is just about perfect for beer lovers of most types. Cheers"

"Overall a brawny full bodied hop bomb. Very nicely made."
""
"This is a real treat to drink, and actually goes down quite easily in spite of any thickness. At this point, I'm not so set on Founders' hop-focused beers, but their maltier offerings are fantastic. This may be old at this point, but it's still drinking amazingly well. I love the spiciness imparted by the rye, as well as the earthiness, rather than excessive sweetness, on part of the predominant malts. Would love to try this fresh, but it seems to be good any time. Truly ahead in the style!"

"Overall/Comments: Wow. I was very impressed by this offering. Really great on the nose. The flavor profile is really great with rye being the perfect compliment for the sweet citrus hops. A mush try. Consumed 4/27/2013. Classified as a Rye Beer @ 6.6% ABV."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into stange. Clear golden orange with a thick yellowish-white head, leaving tons of lacing all over the place. Smells an even blend of hops and malts, with some subtle graininess. Taste is some hops, with a wide spicy bready malt taste with barley and rye combining nicely. Mouthfeel is clear, full and smooth. Overall, I'm very pleased with my first rye beer."

"Overall: I really wanted to like Red's Rye PA, and I certainly found enjoyment in the rye IPA; however, I feel that RRPA could be so much more, in terms of flavor. It looks nice, it smells great, but the taste leaves me expecting more. I would toss a few more tropical fruits into the mix. Since I'm only an hour or so away from the Founders' Brewhaus, breaking and entering doesn't seem half bad."

"Beautiful amber color and a nice light beige head. Strong piney hops smell, very clean. Bitter but not overpowering, a very clean hop forward taste, fades in the middle then a pleasantly bitter after taste returns, just what you'd expect. Mouth feel: Medium carbonation, dries you up nicely. Overall: Excellent Rye Pale Ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"pour is dark copper, slightly cloudy, denser murky white head. Nose is hopped up, light rye spice and juicy citrus and sticky piney hops. Taste is a bit less fresh hop, spice is mild with a more present malt body, biscuity and chewy, lighter carbonation, soft citrus and sticky pine, very creamy feel, soft body."
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy golden/red with a HUGE frothy white head. The head dissipates very slowly. Smells of citrus and tropical fruit with some rye. Taste follows the nose but with a more pronounced rye taste. Also has a bit of a sting from the hops at the end. Mouthfeel is pretty light and crisp. About average or just below average carbonation. Overall, this is pretty good. I wouldn't go around hunting it down, but it was nice to try."

"Pours reddish brown, more red, with some foam. Little ring. Nice blends of caramel and rye. Both pop out. Light sweetness. Taste is a wall of hop that fades into a toffee sweetness. At the end, some bitter pops back up. Lots of rye in the blend. Well carbonated too. As with all Founders offerings, quite good."
""
"Overall - This is certainly a good beer, but not even close to the best Founders has to offer. I could name a half dozen Founders beers better than this, although it is certainly deserving of a try. It just doesn't strike me as a Beer of Fame, although it is. Most Beers of Fame really leave an impression, but this is mildly forgettable. Give it a shot, but I wasn't too wrapped up about it."

"An interesting style for Founders: despite its’ average 6% abv., it comes across as somewhat heavy than the style would have you believe. While not big on rye, I could still recommend this for a single quaff. That is that for this."
""
""
""
""
"Amber, hazy, and with a white soapy head. The beer has a clean aroma...some woody, earthy scents. Spicy hops, some malt. E rye does not come out in the smell as much as it does in the taste. Sweet up front, with lots of malt. Some softness and grain character. Wood and chaff. Firm body. Solidly good."

"Great dark red amber, that pours heavy with a nice head. The taste is prevelant immediately and is a full flavored and full bodied. Can't quite compare the taste to anything else at the moment, but I found it excellent. A full bodied beer with a full taste and not an overpowering after taste. Not to strong ABV wise nor too watered down. Just a phenomenal beer I was lucky to find at my local craft store. Two draughts and an immediate purchase of a four packs should say enough. excellent!"

"O: Great beer. Love the freshness, uniqueness, balance, herbal healthy quality, the label, the company, the colour, etc. Great by itself, it would go well with Scottish oat cakes and whipped butter."
"O: This is a great beer, exactly what you would expect with Founders. Like great American pale ales, it pleases with its hops, however the addition of rye creates a spicy, earthy, and wonderfully different tone for this brew. Get this beer whenever and however you can, it is excellent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is slightly sweet from the caramel malt but more than enough hops to balance it out, nice spicy rye character, quite bread-y, body has good depth without being too heavy, soft but ample carbonation lends a creaminess."
""
""
""
""
""
"I have nothing bad to say about this beer. After pouring from bottle to glass it looked beautiful and rich and smelled powerfully good. There was plenty of good flavor and a fantastic after taste.

"Mouthfeel is slightly syrupy and thick, not in a bad way though. Carbonation is medium. Overall I really enjoyed this beer. The harshness of the rye is held in check by the other flavors. I'm glad I got it and will probably be picking up a sixer of it in the near future."

""
"A touch of rye, a strong hop flavor and some earthy flavors dominate an unbalanced array. The hops are a touch overpowering but then again that's what was advertised. The rye is left begging, wanting to share the spotlight but getting drowned out. The finish is a touch earthy, almost oniony. Overall the taste is of a good quality I just caught myself savoring the malty, grainy rye flavors and wishing the hops didn't overwhelm."

"Pours a reddish brown, almost maroon hue with short white head and some lacing. Aroma of spice and strong hops. Scents of wheat and grains and rye. Tastes of bitter citrus hops, pine and grain. Citrus hops are grapefruit and orange peel. Malt flavors are light, but some creaminess comes through bitterness. Subtle notes of grass, ginger, cinnamon, apple. Grains are earthy but with some nut meat. Overall a superbly bitter IPA with much more grain and earthy tones than your average IPA. Also more pine notes and strength in the hops than your average IPA, but what drastically sets this IPA apart from the pack is the grains."

"O - Very solid spicy pale ale that I would definitely drink again."

"The earthy hops are noticed up front in the taste like the aroma with a classic balance of grains moderating the overall flavor. There is a huge bitterness at the end. Rye PA's are not high on my style list but this was a fine example of it."

"Had this one at the Brick Store Pub in downtown Decatur. The hops is masked a bit too much at first sip; however I did pick up the customary IPA bitterness at the end. There was a tad too much rye on the front end and not a sufficient amount of hop bitterness for my taste. I enjoy all the other Founders brews, but have to put this one at the back of the bus. Having said that, while I would never go out of the way to pick up a six pack or growler, I would certainly order it at one of our Atlanta area beer bars if the other draught offerings were sub-par."
""
""
""
"Overall - This being my second rye beer experience.. I know now for a fact that I do not like the flavor of rye. Lol"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very good but I wish I could could taste the rye more."
""
""
""
""
"As a fan of rye beers and separately IPAs, I wanted to like this, but the beer has a sort of whacky, out-of-balance characteristic. The Michigan hop-head aesthetic is in full bloom here. Bell's Brewery has been setting the pace on these over-blown hop styles. The problem with this Rye PA is that the hops get masked by the rye grain charateristic. Sort of a train-wreck. Malty sweetness isn't evidenced by intent, but the result of this combination is sort of a sharp mush of bitterness. Over many beers this would escalate with growing fatigue on the palate. I've tried this on two occasions- once in the tap room at Founders and once at a bar in Ann Arbor. I did not finish either pint. Exceptionally poor label art too for Founders on this as well."

"Founders Red's Rye P.A. ---4/5."

"Overall: A very complex, but at the same time, easy to drink beer. It's more refreshing than expected. Great look, smell and taste make for a very nice experience overall."
""
""
""
"Deep weathered copper orange in color and murky. Poured with a short white foam that quickly reduced to a thin cap that left lots of sticky lacings on the glass. Ripe grapefruit, sweet malt, rye and sweet dark fruit aromas. Smooth creamy feel over the top with lightly carbonated tangy feel across the tongue. Citrus grapefruit and herbal hop flavors with sweet malt and rye. Finishes with a sticky, bitter hop aftertaste."
""

""
""
"O- A very nice beer. I was a little underwhelmed, because I was hoping for more, but overall a very solid beer. Well balanced."
""
""

"Final Thoughts: Just a straight up good beer and great example of the style. Would I drink it again? Sure."
""
"O - Just another outstanding offeriing from Founders. While I'm not a pale ale fan, Founders has achieved the ability to create balance and keep the hops from being too much at the front. A good thing, IMO."
""
""
""
""
"O: It was good, but not the best rye beer out there, even from my limited experience. Still, founder's is never a bad choice."
""
""

""
""

""
""

"Deep reddish mahogany, with a cream coloured head. Nice retention and a good bit of lace. Nose has loads of caramel malts, some citrus, spicy hop qualities. A bit of bready character. Taste has bitter citrus, light spice, very nice fruity hop character and some toasty bread notes. Medium feel, medium low carbonation - delightful feel. Moderate bitterness. A very nice rye pale."
""
""
""
"Overall: A great rye ale. Great balance. Very to easy to drink as I said. I would recommend this beer to anyone. A damn tasty brew."

"O- Love drinking this one, perfectly balanced flavors, lack of much carbonation is only complaint, regardless its a great beer."

""
""
""
"O: A fine, tasty rye ale with a good balance of flavors. Really drinkable and nice without being super-strong."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Is this a case of entirely drinkable vs. playing it safe? This beer is certainly drinkable, but by that same token, it doesn't do much to excite me. I could definitely see myself buying this beer a handful of times a year if it were available on the West coast, and it'd make for a great session beer... but it's nothing I couldn't live without."
""
""
""
""
""
"Great rye beer thatnleads the pack in my opinion."
""
""
"O: A mighty fine brew indeed. Founders has certainly hit it out of the park with this once again. It'll definitely be a beer I'll seek out and I'd definitely suggest doing the same. Plus, at 6.6% it's a easy sessionable beer and one I'll keep in mind for the future."
"I love rye enhanced beers anyway, but this is one of the best I've encountered thus far. My friend and I didn't let the six of 'em hand around for long. Why didn't I bring more home..."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very drinkable, refreshing, a nice malt/hop balance. I picked this one by accident, but it didn't disappoint me. I don't usually care for this style, but the malty character followed by a nice hoppy aroma leftover in my nose made this beer enough of a happy accident. I wouldn't do it twice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall I like this but judging from reviews I think it's a bit dated being that I should have a bigger hop presence."

"Full disclosure: I am not a huge red rye fan but this is a very good example of the class. Founders always puts out quality beers."

"I had the Founders Red Rye on-tap, poured straight. It had a good head, light and semi-transparent. The smell was excellent and perhaps my favorite part of this drink. It was so fragrant of grapefruit and citrus that my group of friends commented on the smell upon its arrival. It was highly carbonated, crisp, and fresh tasting. Staying true to its citrus scent, the taste was equal parts citrus and floral. I really enjoyed this and would both recommend it and have it again."
""
""
""
"Overall - This is such a great example of balance and complexity. Such a tasty brew, and available year-round. This is a must try, not too sweet, too tart, too bitter, too dry, too alcoholic (which is perfectly hidden) - this really is the best of all worlds, 2 thumbs way up :)"
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A good IPA overall, nice flavor and aroma profile. Has nice malty flavors while still giving in to a nice hop bitterness everyone loves. One of the better IPAs that I have had."
""
"Dark amber orange with an off white head that is relatively thin but throws a lot of lace. The smell makes it immediately clear that this is an IPA. Intense hop aroma mainly of the citrus and pine variety are dominant with caramel maltiness and rye spiciness providing the base. The taste too is upfront hop bitterness and flavor with the citrus really packing a punch. Next the malt comes in with a bit of caramel and rye balancing the hops. Balancing may be a bit of an overstatement because this one remains on the bitter end of the spectrum throughout, even the finish is tinglingly bitter. The body of this beer is medium with low to medium carbonation. There is a bit of a stickiness to this but it's definitely not sweet because again the hop character sticks around throughout leaving a dry tingle at the finish. Overall I'm very satisfied with this beer. Maybe not exactly sessionable but I'm having a hard time putting the glass down."
""

"Red's Rye Pale Ale arrives ruby red in the glass, with a bit of clarity and some lighter red highlights. Almost two fingers of foam crowns the beer, and while it fades quickly at first, the last third or so hangs on for a while. There's definitely some lacing left clinging to the glass, but I'd classify it as spotty. The nose is disappointingly mild, but a bit of caramel plays off spicy grapefruit notes as aromas from the hops and rye meld together. The beer's a little more robust once it hits my palate. A prominent caramel note greets me, before a mild bitterness segues nicely into the spicy touch from the rye. The hoppy finish has some citrus, but also a more dank, pine-y aspect to it. The body is just too chewy for my taste, and as a result the carbonation struggles to cut through it all and make an impression. Red's Rye PA is a decent offering, but doesn't quite measure up to the quality of most Founders brews."
"Founders makes a drinkable Pale Ale no matter what variety. Nice balance and depth without being too much."
""
""
""
""
""
"Slightly hazy pour, a medium brown/amber color with a finger or so of foamy white head; decent retention and lacing. Pine and citrus in the nose, stone fruits, bready malts and rye notes. Good mash of all those components in the taste, bready malts, caramel, stone fruits and citrus, pine bitterness, and a mildly sour twinge. Medium body, well-balanced, a very nice drink overall, and a great, easily-obtainable selection from Founders."

"A nicely balanced beer with a nice touch of rye and hops. The rye adds a nice element of dryness that works extremely well with the citrus. A good red, a good IPA, and a good rye beer."
""
""
"O: My first RyePA and I'm totally digging it. It is a great combo and I can see myself going back for this and venturing out trying some other RyePAs.I see this beer being a good session beer as well as being a great pairing with a meal."
"O: a definite go to for me when i'm looking for something on the bitter side, the rye defenitely adds complexity to the IPA style. highly recommend."

"Pours a dark amber brown color with a slight off-white head. Scent is mild with bitter hops and hints of roasted malts. Taste is bold and bitter. It starts off very strong with rye and earthy tones that turn into a dry, bitter after taste. Good flavor and very well made. Not too strong on the alcohol, but after a couple of these, your taste buds will be worn out."
"-Overall 4.0: Very, very good IPA. Definitely worth trying for fans of the style, as this brew has many notes that one will not find in non-rye IPA's, notably the spiciness. Recommended."

"O: Overall this was a fantastic representation of the style, the smell was amazing, just like when adding hops to a boil. Where this beer could improve is with a little higher IBUs, but otherwise this is a difficult beer to criticize."

"This is a beer loaded with flavor, and it looks gorgeous as well. Nicely done."

"Overall – Great Rye Pale Ale. Lots of smooth hops with a bit of spicy rye. Delicious!"
""
""
""
"Never had a Founders I didn't like, but this is an excellent pale ale, and was enjoyed as a second in a series at lunch. smooth feel, crisp taste, less carbonated than I would expect. Nice tart hoppiness, more citrus than pine. Definitely one I would order again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Tasty, though almost certainly too old to be in tip-top condition. The rye comes through well, lending a grainy, bready character to the beer. Plenty of yeast presence (presumably due to age). Hops are rather muted, although a considerable bitterness remains. A rather nice brew, but I'm sure a fresh example would be even better. Well worth trying, and I'll grab another if I get the chance."

"What a flavorful, unique offering. Great eye candy, great flavors, and a really good balance on a beer that would probably fit every season."
""
""
""
""
""
"I had no idea what this beer had to offer and had never thought about buying it. It was offered at a beer tasting by Founders and was surprised to find it tasted like your standard pale ale. It even had a little bit of a sweet fruit taste and certainly no rye taste. I guess I would just call this good but not great."
""
"Overall this is a solid beer from Founders, like all of their's, that would probably benefit from being more fresh. I'll get this fresh and update sometime."
""
""
""
"a golden color like an ipa. tastes outstanding with complex maltiness and a mild but noticeable sweet citrus flavor very drinkable although u might want to drink no more than 7. Mouthfeel was exceptional. Smell was that of grapefruit with floral character. Overall a nicely crafted beer, hard to find anything bad about it."
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a nice amber red with a froffy white head. Smells of nice sweet hops and grain, with slight hint of citrus. Tastes of nice hop aroma with nice rye aftertaste, very bitter, but not offensively. Beer goes down very smooth for its light body and leaves no offensive aftertastes. Carbonation is fine. Overall a very good beer."
"Every beer aficionado ought to consume a six of this, it should be part of your life's beer experience."
""
"Pours a white foamy one finger head that quickly dissipates leaving some lace. Clear reddish hue with some brown and orange - rust colored. Mostly hops on the nose with bright citrus and secondary aromas of pine. I love this beer. Infinitely session able and food friendly. Quite hoppy, but not DIPA hoppy, with nicely balanced caramel malt. Wonderful. Might be my favorite year-round Founders."

"just a brilliant ipa, my first foray back into hops after a few months in europe. its sexy amber body and frothz white head indicate that its going to be fantastic, and it is. aroma is big west coast hops, fresh and piney, with a balanced amber malt profile and some clever rye spice. flavor is backed off a bit on the rye, much more hope forward, which is delicious. not sure the varieties, but its something high alpha. the rye malt gives the beer a nice little kick in the middle. mouthfeel is also excellent, its more than medium on the body, perfectly carbonated. this is one of the better red india pales out there. i could do a sixpack of this no problem. bravo!"
"up there with the most drinkable American rye beers I've had - it may take second to SA's Revolutionary Rye in my eyes, which is still strange to me - perhaps if they dialed back the hops a bit on this one and let malt come through more, it'd be the apple of my rye, harharhar."
""
""
""

"O: I like everything about this beer but would only suggest a bit of tweaking on the mouthfeel. I would still get this again."

"Overall: Always been a fan of this beer. I like the balance between rye and hops. I will definitely have another."

""

""
""
"I will seek this time and again!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes fanatasic, everything I hoped for and more. Perfect balance of malt, hop and bitterness. No tacked on gimmicky flavor to finish it off. Just disappears down your throat leaving the sides of your tongue just a little bitter and begging for another sip of this exceptionally balanced beer. Not too watery and just crisp enough."
"O: This is different & tasty! Another good beer from Founders. Glad I have one more!"
""
""
""
"Poured from a newly tapped keg. The beer poured well with a nice firm head. Overall color was reddish-brown and nice clear viscous, semi-translucent appearance. Easy roll and good mouth feel. Balanced hop taste and a bit of very light sweetness as the beer temperature rose during drinking. Very smooth and balanced taste. Initial heavy hop feel from first sip, faded and became more balanced with subsequent tasting. The smell was average, non-floral and simple. However, the taste offset the nose and delivered a solid IPA taste without an after-taste. A solid beer!"
"O: another great beer from Founders (no surprise there) - satisfying, gratifying, hearty - truly a rye IPA."
"Pours a clear amber. Nose is spicy with grapefruit hop on nose. Earthy dankness in body along with some citrus with a slickness and a light spicy finish. Some lift sweetness from malt balancing the bitterness well. Well put together beer. More rye character as the beer warmed."
""
""
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavors and aromas. This is my kind of beer!"

""
""
""

"O - red's rye p.a. is a pretty complex brew with lots of both worlds. Malt, hops, and spices are all paired very well and allow for a tasty beer. I can't really say anything bad about anything I've had brewed by Founders and red's rye is no different. It's a must try for anyone and one you can continue to grab year round without any doubt."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Very nice beer. Pours a dark amber, almost orange in tint, with a small head and some lacing. Smell is pleasant and it has a wonderful mouthfeel. Taste is fairly complex with a hint of sweetness progressing to a bitter rye flavor on the backend. Worth a taste for sure!!!"
""
"O – This is a really nice beer. It smells phenomenal with a great hop profile that is layered with toasted and sweet malt and spicy rye, and the taste follows this great aroma well. This is a very drinkable and tasty beer. Founders strikes again."
""
""
""
"Pours a dark amber with some very fine lacing. Scents of floral hops, rye, and citrus. Taste is similar to nose with a perfect balance of floral hops, rye, and a hint of nuttiness. Mouthfeel is really fantastic as its not too heavy, not too light - it's just right. I wouldn't hesitate to pick this up again, another hit from Founders."

"Hands down my favorite rye beer. Not only because of the obvious amazing west coast ipa hop flavor and bitterness but because of just how tasty that malty sweet rye is. As I'm sure others can tell you this is just all around a really great beer."
""
"Nice and hoppy. Great beer."
""
""
""
"Overall: Another rye beer to add to the list. Would be interesting to see a variety of hops, but you can't go wrong with amarillo. Will be enjoying more of these in the future."
"This beer pours a clear copper with no head or lace. The aroma is mainly grapefruit with caramel in the background. The flavor is pure hop bitterness which completely overpowers the palate. It's mouthfeel is light-medium and leaves a strong, bitter aftertaste. Founders Reds Rye PA is a disappointing, one-dimensional beer. Not recommended."
""

""
""
""

""

"This is an excellent beer, even with being on the thick side for a pale ale. Very easy to drink. A great summer brew."
""
""
"I had one to try. Then another. Then another. Wow this beer is delicious. Bit west coast hop profile on the nose. Pine, citrus, wonderful. Sip starts with that flavor, then transitions into the wonderful taste of the rye, which is big but still spicy. Great mix of spice and sweet. Hops carry the whole time. Nice clean finish for such a crazy beer. Really just wonderful."

"This isn't as hoppy or as rye-filled as some others of this style, but it works really well. This is quite possibly the most drinkable rye beer I've ever encountered. I could drink a lot of this."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall an excellent beer but in the rye beer stakes I think that bear republic's hop rod is a bit better. This beer is well balanced and very tasty, it would have been nice to have a bit more of a stronger rye flavour."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is my personal favorite of the Rye PAs, and objectively an exceptionally well crafted brew. The rye and grapefruity hops blend so well together it is almost like it's own flavor. Too bad Founders has a relatively small distribution area. If you are in that area and haven't yet tried this, shame. Try it! Cheers!"
"O - a decent rye beer; nice combination of hops and rye"
""
"O - one of the best and most unique rye beers I have tried this year. What a great surprise. Founders does it again!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
"This is medium bodied with smooth carbonation. A very good beer, that has just enough rye malt flavor to complement the hoppyness."
""
"Overall this is a must try. I remember grabbing this on tap at Founders and hating it because I was a beer noob. I couldn't handle the bitterness. I decided to grab a bottle down in SC... Sad that I moved away from Founders :'( ... and this second go at it really was impressive. It has all the hops of an IPA without the great amount of floralness. The way the beer handles on the palate is perfect. Certainly a must try."
""
""
"O - I am shocked that this is one of the last brews from Founders that has made it to my fridge. Bursting with almost chewy fruit and rye flavor, this is a must try."
""
""
""
""
"O-Very well balanced beer with excellent rye flavor. Definitely one of the best rye beers I have had and the first I have had from founders. Looking forward to trying more from them"
""
""
"A nice burst of fresh fleshy grapefruit, followed by a bitter rye punch in the back of the mouth. There is an elusive malt backbone in the background holding the deliciousness together. This is an excellent beer full of flavor that leaves your mouth yearning for more."
""
"Pours a crystal clear reddish orange color with a huge bubbly off white head that persists forever. Smells of spice, and pine, with bits of citrus and caramel coming off of the edges. The taste follows the aroma to a tee.Medium to thin body with a moderate level of carbonation and a watery resinous mouthfeel. This is a nice beer, it smells great! For my tastes I would have liked a hint more body though."
""
""
"O - Very nicely balanced brew, good hops, have yet to go bad with Founders."
""
""
""
""
""
"For the style, i'd put it above the SN & 3F versions, but not as good as the 2 Brothers. With the disappearing bottle date, i'm not sure how fresh this is. Looking forward to my trip to Founders in a few weeks, as this is one of my favorite Founders beers."

"B"
""
"12oz bottle with a Bottled On Dat of 04/19/12. Pours a dark reddish brown with no head. Zero lacing. Aromas of sweet, piney hops, caramel, and malts. Taste is oily, resinous hops. Pine, brown sugar, malts, and rye. Piney finish. Dry, oily mouthfeel. Very intresting beer for sure. Overall, worth having again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Now this is what Sierra Nevada's Ruthless Rye should have been! (SN, I love you to death, but Ruthless Rye was pretty much Torpedo with a hint of rye and less drinkability) Rye-flavored anything isn't normally my cup of tea, but this is pulled off incredibly well. I'd love to drink this one side to side with Hop Rod Rye, too."
""
""
""
"Poured a very vibrant red with about a finger of head into a pint glass. Can smell a hint of rye along with a few qualities of a pale ale. Wow, what a taste! I can see why this style is really up and coming. A full taste unlike most I've ever had. This beer, while aesthetically pleasing, also has such a great flavor...bready yet not overwhelming."
"O- I think the truth must be told with this tasting... Founders is that good when it comes to interpretation of their styles! This Rye beer is so good with the classifications of hoppy flavors. What a brewery, what a beer.. glad you are here founders (finally)"

"originally reviewed: 10-24-2010"

"O: Very good brew. Everything balances well and there are some truly unique flavors that all go very well together. Would def purchase another six pack of this and would like to try it on tap to compare."
""
""
""
"O: My favorite rye beer and one of my favorites from Founders. Perfect amount of rye to add flavor and mouthfeel without dominating the flavor profile."
""
""
""
"O: A very good rye beer. The touch of citrus helps bring out the spiciness of the rye. This creates an intense rye flavor. This is a good example of a rye beer for those who enjoy rye beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Very chewy, almost like you're eating NY style Jewish Rye bread. Nice blend of spiciness, bitter citrus and sweet caramel malts. Not a beer I would constantly seek out, but really glad I was gifted a bottle. Thanks Tony!"

"Overall: Another solid beer from my favorite brewery in the world. Not their best, but pretty goddamned good. "
"Overall – This is a very nice red IPA. It’s got a great hoppy flavor with nice rye bread tastes."
"Ov: This is a great Rye PA and while SN RR is really enjoyable I definitely prefer Red's Rye. Grapefruit notes from the Amarillo hops blend perfectly with the spice of the rye and rich caramel malts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a very drinkable rye IPA style beer. Hops overpower the rye maltiness slightly and I wish the finish was a little less bitter, but quite tasty none-the-less and a solid beer to find on draft in NYC."
""
"O - One of the best rye beers I have had. Well balanced with a good amount of rye flavor and the perfect hoppiness. The best of founders year round beers IMO. I highly recommend it."
""
""
""
"Truthfully, I am puzzled. This really tasted like a quality IPA. I noticed it had the smoothness of a rye whiskey, but I could not notice the rye characteristics! The beer smelled like Founder's Centennial even! I plan to try more in this style, and pursue a draught offering of this beer. From there, I will see if ""Rye Beer"" is for me."

"Poured 12 oz bottle into pint glass. Deep mahogony red body, nearly caramel one finger head. A bit of lacing as the head dissipates. Sour apple and citrus hop (70 IBU's quite apparent) and rye on the nose, as well as the flavor. Dry and spicy with milky malt. Classic founders smoothness, wet, crispy, drinkable."

"Founders Red's Rye Pale Ale from Founders Brewing Company is a welcome addition here in Alabama. It's color is dark amber with a beige head. The smell is pine, hops, and rye. The taste is fantastic. It's a well balanced beer that has equal parts sweet malt and hop bitterness. Will be in heavy rotation at my house. This beer has made me want to try other rye beers. Keep the great beers coming to Alabama."
"This is a winner in my house."
""
"O: This is a very pleasant drinking beer that could easily be a session beer for me. I enjoy the aromas and the flavor of this beer quite a bit. Definitely one to get another time."
"Overall: You just can't go wrong with a Founders beer. It well balanced with the rye and hop profile that its best attribute in my opinion. Its another great option for a hot weather beer that will keep me drinking local brew!"
""
""
"Drinkability: A solid brewski. Enough said."

"O - Wow, what a great beer. One of my favorites."
"And enough bitterness to keep me coming back for another drink."

"Definatly going to enjoy this one again, Cheers!!"

"12oz bottle, pours a bronzish-red color with a thin beige head that settles to a layer of foam atop the ale. Good clarity. A little lacing on the glass. Aromas are great with notes of floral, citric, piny hops, rye malt, and carameley sweetness. Tastes of peppery rye hit the palate up-front followed by strong piny astringency and bitterness from the hops. Notes of pungent grapefruit rind, caramel, aspirin, and peppery spiciness battle in the mouth, while being crisp yet finishing dry. Overall, always a favorite of mine, and one of the best rye beers out there."

"Smooth for an IPA. A tangy effervescence up front relaxes quickly. Drying finish. Rather full body. I like this, wish it was distributed here."

"O- I don't like rye beers but this is awesome! So glad I can get this whenever I want. All hail founders!!"

"O - very nicely balanced brew, serious rye spice and lots of refreshing lemon flavors. Malty sweetness is a bit lacking. Overall a good session beer on a hot day"
"12oz bottle. A ruby red amber with a beige medium head on the pour. Aroma of rye, some malt, yeast with some earthy floral hops. Taste is rye, earthy resiny hops, malt and yeast. A medium to full body on the palate with a crisp moth feel and lively carbonation. Finish is rye, grains, sweet maltiness, yeast with some nice lingering bitter sweet earthy floral resiny hops ending. A brew overwhelmingly dominated by rye and bitter hops but overall a good drinkable brew."
"O: Pretty nice rye beer but there are probably better options out there. Glad I got a chance to try it, cheers!"

"One of my #1 go-to's. Pours a deep amber red color with a creamy just barely off-white head. Aroma of spicy rye, big piney hopes, maybe a little grapefruit peel. Flavor follows with big up front bitter, but quickly runs smooth on the palate into a spicy rye accented by toffee and biscuit malts. The pine comes back into play as it goes down the gullet. Medium mouthfeel, a bit dry on the finish. Plenty of carbonation. This beer is pretty awesome."
""
"O - Overall this beer was fantastic. Great balance between the rye, sweet malt, and bitter hops. The rye creates such a bold flavor there is really nothing else like it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very bold and spicy PA. Much closer to an IPA than some others in this class, such as Terrapin's fine Rye Pale Ale. Well crafted!"
""
"overall-for me, perfect. I'm a big rye fan and any time that rye and hops work togehter in this way is very enjoyable"
"D- Not a bad beer with a nice rye character that brings me back for more, not much of an IPA but a really solid red rye."
"Rye beer seems to be on the rise, and this one is at the top of the small but growing heap that I've tried lately. It's a good alternative to the amber/altbiers that are everywhere these days, and this one is especially worth hunting down. The aroma is stiff with hops, but this sharp edge is filed down nicely in the taste by the rye. The finish is pleasantly dry, in that IPA-dry manner, but it won't have you crawling across the floor, gasping for air as you reach for your humidifier. Nice."
""
""
""
"O - Another solid offering from Founders. I don't particularly like the style, but this one works well."
"O: Seems like a fairly middle of the road beer to me. A bit too malt dominated, and the hops don't seem to compliment it all that well. Among the rest of Founder's offerings, I wouldn't particularly go after this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Poured nice and copper like a red. The smell is great. Flowery, yet sweet, with a hint of earthy rye. I think it might be one of the best smells from a beer that I've experienced. The taste is just as complex. A slight carbonation gives was to a great mix of hop, malt and rye. Overall, this is one of my favorites. Love the uniqueness of Rye IPA's."

"Overall, a really good example of a rye beer. Definitely worth a try if you enjoy rye beers and comes highly recommended."

"Overall: Not a bad beer at all, actually it's pretty damn good. I love how well constructed and flavorful it is. Pleasure to have, keep drinking....Salud!"

"A light, spicy, and bitter beer. Smells like a DIPA, tastes like a light IPA. Not sure if I picked out the rye at all. But a nice beer. Interesting note: leaves a slight coolness (menthol like taste/feeling) in the salivary gland region."

"Im sure most of you have tried this delicious beer...an easily attainable year round offering from Founder's...always fresh(they bottle date)...and an (almost) session beer that can be enjoyed throughout an evening...please try this beautiful beer if you havent and cheers to Founder's once again as they pull off an impressive but at times precarious balance between their year round and highly in demand seasonal offerings..."

"Final verdict: a big winner. It amazes me the kind of flavors a brewery can wring from a relatively limited amount of ingredients! I'm going to be picking up this in quantity as soon as possible."
""
"Poured 12 oz bottle into stange. Deep mahogony red body, nearly caramel one finger head. A bit of lacing as the head dissipates. Sour apple and citrus hop (70 IBU's quite apparent) and rye on the nose, as well as the flavor. Dry and spicy with milky malt. Classic founders smoothness, wet, crispy, drinkable."
"I used to call this one of my favorite IPAs, but it's not. An IPA, that is. Sometimes it's not all about the hops, but they certainly help. Here's to this rye beer! Cheers!"
"O- I love this beer, the complexity and depth the rye adds balanced off w/ a great blend of hops!!! Great!!"

"I'm not sure I'd seek this one out, but where available it is an almost must have from time to time. I hear so much love for Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, but frankly those people must not have access to this one."

"O: This is a great beer. I grabbed this is a mix and match 6 pack and this blows me away. Just amazing."

"Nice reddish amber color with a thin white head. Smell is great. Fresh lemons, grapefruit, rye spiciness and pine. Taste has a lot of spice, but is balanced very well with the citrusy hops and bisquity malt. Extremely well balanced and very easy to drink. Nice carbonation and a good overall drinkability. This is a style that doesn't necessarily impress me most of the time, but this is a very good one."

"Received a 12oz bottle in a local 4 local beer trade. It pours a nice dark apricot body with a creamy head. Great lacing on the grass. It didtnt produce a strong aroma like I expected but you get nice hoppy/tropical fruits. It has a nice smooth mouth feel that is mildly hoppy upfront, but you get a spice from the rye towards the end that highlights the hops. Im not a big fan of rye beers but I love this beer. I wish I could get it locally."

"D/O: Never extreme, this fine pale ale extends itself masterfully across the continuum of of style-appropriate qualities. Rye, while a component of the malt bill, successfully joins an ensemble whose range includes toasty, caramel, and even slightly roasty qualities. Hops are companionable to other flavors, joining with English yeast metabolites especially well. This is an ale in the truest sense; an ale for all seasons and occasions."
""
"Overall I thought this was a good beer and a pretty damn good example of the style, sometimes rye can be a little overpowering but Founders kept that in check nicely with a good amount of tasty citrus hops and that worked out pretty well. This beer had good drinkability, it was pretty smooth and the flavors did a good job at holding my attention, I can drink around three of these but that seems to be my limit for this beer, it's a good beer for just about any season. What I liked the most about this beer was how balanced it was, it had a good amount of rye and hops in it, but neither of them were too overpowering and that made for a really nice beer. What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeel, it wasn't bad at all, but the creaminess did through me off a little. I would buy this beer again, I don't buy it often, but when I feel like a Rye Beer it makes for a pretty good and affordable choice, I recommend this to just about anyone and it's a must try if your a fan of Rye Beers. All in all I was happy with this beer, it's pretty damn solid and that's what I have come to expect from this brewery. It sucks that Founders decided to make this a seasonal, I will miss being able to buy it year around, but I often forgot about it which won't be happening when it turns to a seasonal, but Founders has to make tough decisions sometimes and I respect that, but it still sucks. Good job guys, it's nice to have a world class brewery like Founders in Michigan, they make some damn good beer."

"This is my first and only rye beer so I don't have anything to compare to. Malt is certainly prominent. Not sure I'd feel compelled to pick this one up again though."

"Powerful tasting beer for the Abv. Couldn't pick up the rye distinction too much from other ipas. Was trying to figure it out. Founders makes some killer beers."

"On the tasting end, there's a very nice floral bitter scent with some rye hints underneath. Very good, but a bit disappointed if only because I was expecting more of a rye wallop. It's hoppy with hints of citrus. Very nicely carbonated and refreshing. This is a beautifully balanced ale with tons of flavor coming through."

"Poured this rye beer into a pint glass from a 12 oz bottle. Produced a very nice white head, retention was great, lacing was also outstanding. This beer poured a cloudy orangish brown color. The aroma was full of spicy rye, citrus and piney hops. The taste of this beer was medium in body, very smooth, drinkable,and full of malt, bitter citrus hops. Spicy tone set by the rye...very nice. For sure a keeper!"

"D/O - Drinkability is moderately high. Smooth drinking and a nice flavor, but the bitterness tends to overshadow the tastier parts of this beer and tends to imbalance it a little. I feel the rye is well-integrated as well and adds a nice kick to the pale side of this beer."

"This brew poured out as a nice looking reddish brown color. With a pretty good sized white head on top. The lacing is a little sticky and it also has a good retention. The smell of the beer had plenty of spicy rye mixing with floral hops. The taste of the beer was citrusy, bitter and spicy. It had a really nice drinkable mouthfeel and it went down really well. Overall it's. OT my favorite Founders brew but it's still pretty damn tasty."
"O: i was really taken a back by this beer. It snuck its way into my six pack of centenial ipa without me even noticing. im probably going to head back tomorrow and see if i can buy the rest. What a good solid beer."
"O: I’m not a big rye fan but this is a pretty good one. What else would I expect from founders? Drinkable and good but I wouldn’t buy it for my tastes."
"O: A great combination of flavors that come together in this brew."
"Theres enough hops to make their presence known, yet its not too much. If you like hops, this is your drinkable beer right here."
" around."
"Overall a superb rye beer with great hop character."
"o: Wow, another great beer from Founders. I believe this is my first rye beer and I imagine it will be tough to beat as the benchmark for the style. Highly recommended."
"Another solid beer from Founder's. A very good go to for a nice year round beer."
"O - Quite a well balanced beer with lots of character and depth."
"O: a good brew, could be a bit nicer on the nose but works nicely with the taste and overall mouth feel, really loved the appearance on texture of this one"
"o: one of founders best and hard for anybody to beat this when it comes to rye beer."
"Yet another beer I opened and the sent filled the room. There was quite the yeasty-rye aroma. A nice color, and what a taste. Super-rye flavor, with just the perfect hint of hops. Enough to taste it, but not overwhelmingly so. Just a fantastically solid brew from Founders, per usual."
"This is very tasty and at least my bottle tastes noticeably better than it smells. The color and taste explain why this is a benchmark for this style of beer."
"amber color. head retention is ok. aroma is nice and spicy. cloves maybe. tastes kind of like rye bread. the malt character is quite different from any amber ales or ipas i've had. quite pleasant. nice hoppiness (balanced bitters at the end. nice aromas up front). carbonation is low. finish is medium. nice. but i have a feeling my bottle might be a little low. a stronger carbonation wouldve made this a much more pleasant experience"
"I will leave it to the pro's to break it down structurally and simply say, this jewel is beautiful."
"Light to medium body with a lot of small bubble carbonation that is prickly on the tongue. Easy drinking and tasty rye beer. One of the better ones that I've tried."
"Overall this is my favorite beer of the very general ""rye"" style, though really this could be thought of as an IPA more than anything else. Another great job by founders and one of my personal go-to, easy to get beers for hoppy styles along with 2hearted and Hop Notch."
"Pours a rust, burnt orange, red color with a light khaki-colored head. About two centimeters of foamy bubbles form during the pour, and large strands/patches of sticky lacing cling to the glass as the level subsides. The ruby hues in this one are gorgeous. The aroma is of rye, ample caramel malt, grapefruit, orange, and some faint herbal notes. The caramel really shines through in the nose, reminiscent of a malty amber. The taste is similar, but with an added emphasis on the citrus, especially at the end. The rye is balanced well with the caramel flavors, and some muddled herbal undertones round it out nicely. Mouthfeel is exceptional; smooth going down, crisp on the tongue, and a finish that leaves you wondering if you really did just take a drink. Certainly one that keeps you coming back, and just a great beer overall."
"Pours an inviting tawny red color, & the beer retains a carbonated head quite well. The aroma is incredible - bright fruity hops, creamy caramel, malt sugar, and a savory undertone. The taste is very complex - it thrilled my tastebuds! The flavor begins sweet and spicy all at once. It's fresh towards the middle and fades to a dry and pleasant bitterness - leaves one wanting more. Light mouthfeel. Compares very favorably to other Rye beers."
"O - awesome beer! I love rye in beer"
"While everyone else is caught up in the CBS chaos, I'll happily stick to Red's Rye, if and when, because I always do, need my Founder's fix."
"O - Great rye beer with a nice hop bite. Not too complex but this is a solid beer with emphasis on the bittering hops. Just enough malt backbone to smooth things out nicely."
"Pours a nice dark amber, not cloudy but definitely opaque. Off white head that lasts and lasts. Nose is really nice, lots of citrus and a touch of pine. A hint of rye spiciness and a surprisingly strong malt backbone. As it opens up I get a touch of earthiness, it actually reminds me of a McDonald's hashbrown. Taste is strongly bitter but not overpowering. It is balanced with spice and a small amount of caramelly malt. Mouthfeel is perfect for the style, good carbonation. Overall a really tasty brew I will definitely seek this one out wherever I am."
"O- Decent beer, I feel like I might have drank a bad bottle because I remember this being a lot better, either that or my palate has changed tremendously since the first time I drank this. Other than that still a solid beer from founders."
"A damn nice beer; quite balanced for such a hoppy brew, there's plenty of complexity to keep you interested while still being easy to drink."
"Anyone looking for a solid IPA spiced up with a confident malt profile, give it a shot."
"D: This one lives up to the hype of being a simple, delicious, rye-forward beer. At 6.6% it's impressive in flavor and body."
"Overall I've enjoyed this beer and would consider having another go with it. Would be a great beer to have next to a nice rye whiskey."
"Meh"
"Enjoyable beer, but just reminds me, really, of better beers in the same vein."
"O: Another winner from Founders. Hoppy enough to make a fan of IPA's happy, but a nice change of pace with the rye thrown in there."
"A cloudy deep orange brown colored brew with a healthy big bubbled off-white head and modest lacing. The aroma says cat piss hops, a little grassy citrus bite and a little caramel malt sweetness. The flavor brings sharp hop bite, lemon and grapefruit over what I find to be a proper rye bread touch. It’s finely but prominently carbonated in a medium-light bodied brew. Awesome!"
"Really nice beer, and big when it comes to flavour. Plenty of complexity to make it interesting, and nicely balanced. It could actually show off the rye a little bit more, but that also might make it more gimmicky, rather than having everything integrated as it is right now."
"O - decent brew but the complex aroma led me to high hopes the taste didn't match to my surprise, with that being said i know this isnt the most fresh offering so ill take that into consideration. huge rye fan and always try something when i see the word rye. this beer is just not big enough for it to be great to me, and no bigger doesn't mean better to me but i feel this way with this one."
"O: I enjoyed this a lot more last time I had some. I looked all over the place to find some with bottle dates but the last shipment must have missed that step at Founders. A really hoppy interesting rye pale ale when fresh, decent at this age."
"O - This is what I would call a complex beer, I can see it pairing with so many foods. This is a great beer that I wish just looked a touch better."
"Edit: Second bottle on 10-13-2011 and most of my thoughts stay the same. On the tongue I taste a bit more malts than I remember with a nicely balanced piney hop flavor."
"Overall this an incredible beer. An instant favorite. I will always pick some of this up if it's fresh. I hope to find this on draft."
"This beer pours a nice reddish color with a decent sized white head that laces the glass as it recedes. the smell is amazing amarillo hops with a rye backbone. the flavor follows suit with the amarillo flavor coming through followed by the rye malt and finished with a nice hop bitterness. the mouthfeel is nice and light and just right. overall one of the best rye beers out there."
"O- While it's no Nugget Nectar, I can easily say that this is the second best Rye beer I've had to date. It has just enough citrus notes to break the mold of the malty rye style and I prefer it to any of the Founders IPAs. Great beer."
"O- Another great beer by Founders, as is the norm. Certainly would seek this out again if the mood struck me."
"D - Very drinkable. The rye flavor here is very nicely balanced and incorporated with the rest of the flavors. The hop flavors especially work together nicely with the rye flavor."
"Overall, this is a solid beer. I still have never been disappointed by a beer from Founders!"
"Very complex beer here. The rye is noticeable but this is definitely closer to an IPA than an all out rye ale with the intense hop character. Nice twist on an IPA though. A must try for all hop heads."
"Overall – My bottle was a little out of date but I still enjoyed this beer. It's a god a big unique taste that keeps the beer interesting all the way through. I imagine I didn't get a whole lot of hop bitterness due to the age of the bottle, so I will surely revisit this beer again when I find it fresh."
"O - A solid RPA, good profile, pretty easy to quaff @ 6.6%, and overall well rounded yet surprisingly complex."
"O- Decent beer, I’ve had a few rye IPA’s of late and this one certainly stacks up. Its not my favorite style but still a beer I would enjoy every now and then B+"
"Pours a hazy copper orange with a 1 inch puffy light tan head that settles to a thin cap. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of citrus fruits and citrus zest and some rye/malt. Taste is of bitter citrus fruit, citrus zest, and a malt and rye backbone. Mild hop bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good rye beer with some very nice citrus aromas and tastes."
"Quite good, was my go-to at one of my favorite restaurants in Richmond."
"Overall, an excellent beer. Glad to have tried this and believe this further solidifies Founders as an awesome brewery."
"Overall a fantastic brew. Hops overwhelm the rye component a little, but overall a good match."
"O: this is drinkable, delicious, and well crafted. It was $9 for a 6 pack in Michigan. I'll buy it again if I see it."
"M: Medium body with creamy flow. Good warming and mouth coating."
"Overall: I liked this one a lot. Just another solid beer from Founders. You can pretty much expect a solid brew from them every time. Yes indeed I would buy this again... and again."
"O- I want to like rye beers, and some just aren't my thing. But I think I found one that I'd definitely get again."
"Many reviewers noted the ""two-finger head"" on this beer, something that was notably absent on this bottle. Think I got an old one. Still good, but not as good as it should have been."
"O: A very good beer that fits this style perfectly. Founders did it again. I would definitely recommend this beer."
"Overall: An outstanding beer. Rich in body and taste and the flavors are both bold and well balanced."
"Overall, this is a great beer. Each component is very good and results in a solid overall product that is nicely balanced and not so intense that you can't have another, which you will likely want to do."
"This is one of my favorite Red Beers. I would recommend this beer to anyone."
"O: As others have all said, this stuff is great. On the one hand you can pop one any time because it would fit with pretty much any occasion, yet it also causes you to pause and contemplate it."
"Notes: A very unique and interesting beer. Should be able to create some great food pairings with it."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer were the extremely bold hop components. The floral, and citrus came together nicely here to yield a brew both earthy and refreshing. Where this one lost points was in the diminished “red rye” components. It instead seemed more like a unique IPA or DIPA, with the hop components really taking the front seat here, and the grain and spice taking the back seat."
"What a treat to be able to enjoy this beer fresh as can be. This bottle poured a ruby-auburn color with a bit of foam that releases all sorts of hoppy citrusy aromas. Reminds me of a freshly squeezed grapefruit balanced with malt sweetness and a touch of rye. The taste of hoppy grapefruit is balanced by a spicy rye kick and ends with a bitterness turned sweet. Just a touch of chewiness and a drizzle of honey to round out this engaging, interesting, complex brew. A real treat."
"Overall, my FIRST beer from founders, and certainly not my last. Hellooo Midwest brewing scene. I can get used to this."
"O: This beer was kind of a let down for me. The acidity seems to just come out of nowhere. I have a hard time believing this is the intended state of this beer. However, a strong hop presence really seems like it would dominate the beer in any form. Currently, the hop serves more as a preservative than a flavor ingredient. I'd like to retry this, but I won't get my hopes up, or make it an item I'd trade directly for.."
"While there is nothing here that is exceptional in itself, the whole package is a very enjoyable drink. A session ale without a doubt. The lingering dry hops invites one to have another sip and then yet another and so on until you run out of ale. Then you look into the fridge to find that there are none left. It’s that kind of ale."
"D. Very hoppy for style. Kind of drowns out the malt."
"Overall - Definitely have to give this one a 4.0 overall. It's not stupendous, but it is very good. For this being my first Rye beer, and with no real prior conception of the style going in, I'm pleasantly surprised. Obviously I'm thinking this is a hoppier version than most Rye beers, but since I love IPAs/DIPAs, it's a very welcome iteration. If you like hoppy beers, definitely seek this one to give it a try!"
"Medium bodied, slick with good carbonation. Good for a rye beer, but it really dominates."
"Overall, this beer is very impressive as stated before. A wonderful suprise indeed. I was expecting just a super hoppy one dementional rye pale ale, but I thought wrong. Should've known Founders would knock it out of the park like Barry Bonds. I absolutely love this beer! Thanks Founders!"
"A very good bitter rye beer. Certainly another fine Founders beverage, one worth seeking out."
"The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with above average carbonation, providing additional sting on the palate. There is a definite stickiness to this mouth. Overall this is an amazing brew. The complexities, the mouthfeel and the aroma are all great and really bring everything together. Another great brew from Founders."
"O: I thought this beer was pretty awesome for its style. I was suprised that I rated it this high, but I can't find any reason not to. Overall better then Bells Rye beer “Golden Rye” I think, and even though I haven’t had Sky High Rye from Arcadia I can’t see myself liking that more then this."
"Overall another solid offering from Founders, I am glad that this is an easy beer to get and I can find it whenever I'm in the mood for it. On a side note to me this almost comes off as a light version of Devil Dancer. That is not a knock on either beer because I really enjoy both of them but when drinking this beer it really reminds me of Devil Dancer."
"This is medium bodied with a moderate level of carbonation. Easy drinking with a nice toasted grain flavor backing instead of the typical sweet caramel malt undertones. I felt both the bitterness of this ""pale"" and alcohol hit home a little harder than what was listed on the label but no complaints here."
"Final Thoughts: It's good, but it might be a bit overhyped. People act like this will blow you away. It's good, just not the caliber the hype gives it."
"sets the bar for every genre of beer that they create, everything that I have tried from them thus far is nothing short of spectacular and top notch in whatever beer category they are pursuing. This rye beer from them is no exception, the other rye beer I tried from another local brewery was nothing compared to the simple complexity and amazing balance that this beer has. This beer is available year round because it is just awesome; it needs to be available anytime you want a quality rye beer. Another win from Founders, do they ever do anything that is subpar?"
"O (D) - it's decent, will have to try it fresher."
"An excellent beer!"
"O: Not a bad beer. It tastes ok, but it's just not doing it for me right now. Can't really recommend."
"O: Maybe this beer was over-hyped for me, but I don't find anything exceptional here. Still, it's a good enough beer, and I'd be keen to try another one to see if this was a one-off poor experience. In its current form, not recommended."
"This is a great brew. The aroma is wonderful. The flavor balance can be noted from the first taste. It is nearly perfect and flavorful."
"Overall - Another excellent Founders beer. Definitely will buy again."
"M - Creamy and smooth."
"O: A solid brew and one that deserves a place in any ale-lover's rotation. Definitely a west-coast style brew. A solid B+/A- for me. I just wish I could get this in my area."
"Pours a amber brown w/ small head and left lace patches down glass. A strong sweet malt smell of caramel and rye and a fruity, hoppy smell as well. Smooth and creamy, with caramel notes and some other sweetness; slightly sticky. There's a dry, citric hop flavor that passes over but it is balanced well and finishes dry and crisp. An easy to drink beer."
"O: I'm hoping there's something wrong with my bottle or something and I can retry this and get the nose to be the mouth on this one. As it is, though, the bitterness is near-impossible to get past to find some enjoyment in this beer."
"O= A tasty ""rye P.A."" but not particularly memorable. I am a hop head, but the hops are lingering long after the last swallow. Again, surprising for 70IBUs."
"I really enjoyed this beer, and if I had normal access to it, would add it into my regular beer rotation."
"D/O- Another treat from Founders. I'd place Two Brother Cane and Ebel in the same category and prefer that but would rate this right below it....great beer overall though."
"O: Really a good beer. complex, nicely balanced. Not only worth drinking, but worth going out of your way to find. Another great offering from Founders."
"M - Thin-to-medium body with a slightly dry finish. Great carbonation."
"look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5"

"On the whole, an interesting rye beer. Perhaps a bit too hop-forward for my liking. If there was a bit more balance to it, the other flavors could really come out and provide a counter to the bitterness, which came across as almost seething at times. I would probably revisit this beer given the chance, but I don't think I'd go out of my way for it."
"O-Excellent rye beer with great balance and finish. To be savored for it's obvious quality and craftmanship."
"Mouthfeel is just about medium-bodied with moderate carbonation, giving clean and crisp qualities to it. Very balanced and flavorful. Reminds me of Nugget Nectar to a certain degree. Actually want to give huge thanks to the gentleman who shared this with me while I was at RnH and opened my eyes to this beer."
"O- it's alright. maybe rye beers aren't my thing. it's ok, won't drink it again though"
"O- While not my favorite style, this beer is really nice, and definitely worth picking up if you haven't tried it. Another victory from the guys at Founders."
"Drink- This was a welcome gift. I had wanted to try it for a long time and was not let down. It was spicy, malty, rye, hoppy. A lot of flavors that works well."
"I gave this beer extra points in the overall category because while it's not particularly amazing in any one way, the combination really shines. Not too much spicy rye, not a hop bomb IPA. Not too wussy but not too heavy. Just all around well balanced and tasty. Sometimes it's hard to find good beers that aren't ""extreme"" in one way or another."
"M/O. This beer has a semi-dry taste in the mouth and is a little sticky, but overall a good beer and another winner from Founders."
"I've been keeping an eye out for this one and finally scored some. So far, everything that I've tried from Founders has been great and Red's Rye is no exception. This beer works well on many levels. It has visual appeal with a deep red/amber color with a great off-white head that laced well. The nose is nice and hoppy with some malt and rye bleeding through. Palate is outstanding from start to finish. Spicy rye and bitter piney hops blast the taste buds and are complimented nicely by the flavorful caramel malts. Finish is semi-dry and very bitter. Overall, this is a well made brew that I could see going well a meal and one that I look forward to having again."
"This beer is outstanding. I got this bottle about 4 or 5 months ago, placed it in the back of my fridge and forgot about it. Its still tastes completely fresh and delicious, all of the flavors blending nicely."
"12 oz bottle into 13 oz tulip glass. Bright amber with a sticky off white head. Really attractive beer. Hops biscuit, pine, grapefruit, pretty pungent. The taste is even more forward then nose. Heavier then u expect. Easy drinking for such a big body. Really different then most beers, a real treat."
"Due to the bite I would usually be able to down one of these before moving on to something else, but that one is quite good. Nice beer, have yet to find a Founders I don't care for."
"D - A pretty standard hoppy red ale. The aroma is very nice with lots of green, pungent hops and enough malt to to hint at the thick sugary character of the flavor profile. The caramel and toffee that dominate the malt character work nicely with the pine and grapefruit hops but never become excessive. My only complaint is the way the bitterness becomes sharp and almost overwhelming in the finish, to the point that some soapy notes linger on the palate after everything else fades away. This last impression kind of ruins the drinkability of an otherwise very nice beer."
"O- Overall this is the second best rye ipa ive had, next to Jester King's. Glad Founders has gone to the yellow dating ink on the bottles, this stuff fresh is hard to beat."
"This is a good one!"
"One of the best rye beers I've had, up there with Hop rod Rye. Red's is not as sweet, not as strong, but gives a big rich cornucopia of flavors."
"Pours cloudy orange with a white head. Very hoppy smell and some hints of the rye in the nose. Great crisp hop flavor with some sweet rye notes. This one has a nice round finish. It says its 70 IBU but I don't believe it. the carbonation was spot on. This is just a great beer."
"O - Pretty much my standard for a rye beer, and I think the added hopping lends an additional element. Love the rye spiciness through out."
"This is only my second offering from Founders, but damn, they make a quality beer. Have to try more from these guys."
"This is a good beer. If you see it, I recommend it as a good pairing to red meat or pizza (without being too heavy). Just be careful, the ABV is high for this time of year."
"Very defined in flavor but open to many new fans!!! I am one!! Pick this one up if possible!!!"
"D: This beer is well balanced and has a nice hoppy/sweet taste to it. Kind of like sweet and sour chicken is polar opposites in flavors yet it comes together flawlessly. Very easy to drink. If this was easily available in California i would make sure to keep it in my fridge at all times."
"o: this beer rocks. its a real treat. best of its kind and a must try. great work yet again fonders."
"Overall, though, i really love DIPAs and this one swings with the best I've tasted and I most certainly would try it again."
"O: A great rye beer that truly proves that you can pull off both rye and aggressive hopping in the same beer. Check this out for sure if you can find it"
"This beer is well worth checking out especially if you typically gravitate to hoppy brews."
"Overall / Drinkability: Hmmm... good looking beer, good smell, good mouthfeel, but the taste is an acquired one and I'm not sure if I've acquired it yet. Maybe with the right meal I'd enjoy this beer more. Well, glad I tried it and maybe I need to revisit again when my palate has expanded more. I'm thinking that if one is a massive hophead then this beer really is appealing - no sweetness to get in the way of the hop bitterness and flavors, but for me I think I need more malt to counter the hop bitterness."
"Pours an oakish red. Beautiful smells right from the popped top. Strong citrus, hops, and caramel. Nice hoppy, citrusy taste. A lot of caramel on the finish, maybe a tad bit of oakiness to it. plus a dry bitterness. Mouthfeel actually feels a bit creamy. Quite full. Medium carbonation. This is yet another fine beer from founders. I am consistently pleased with them the more I try."
"D - Superb. Much bigger and complex than it looked. A true wolf in sheep's clothing. Can't wait to enjoy another."
"O: Overall this is an excellent beer. Complex malts bill, big citrus hoppiness. The rye and amarillo has a place in my heart."
"Overall-Kind of pissed because It had a lot of promise, and is still a quality beer that I would absolutely drink again, just a little bit watery for me. Nonetheless, go get this beer if you can."
"Taste is sweetly malted at first, with a bitter pine hop resin and grapefruit in the followthrough. Good, and well-balanced flavor...definitely a solid choice for hop heads."
"M: Clean, crisp, perfect amount of carbonation."
"this beer is easy to drink but full of flavor, not overwhelmingly hoppy or alcoholic. strikes off in a different, refreshing direction from typical ipas."
"overall: simply put, a great, refreshing beer that can easily be enjoyed with a variety of meals or by itself on a summer day. As far as rye ales are concerned, this is definitely worth checking out."
"Overall: A good flavorful ale and though i would have preferred a more pronounced hop kick, it's worth trying for sure."
"O: Stellar representation of the style within all regards. Comes recommended. Looking forward to drinking more when applicable."
"O - Wow this is a great brew. I've heard a lot and read a lot about this one and it did not disappoint at all. Awesome! A session brew to boot. I could see myself having 3 or 4 of these puppies in a sitting during the summer! Very well done!!"
"O--This is a good example of the style, but it is not my favorite. I would certainly never pass it up, but I won't be seeking it out."
"Overall- Drinkability was great but still confused on the malt, and all of the ingredients used. I've only had a few Rye Beers and am interested in learning more about this style. Will be trying more in the future, could drink many (4+) of these beers in one night."
"O: Interesting beer. More bitter than expected. Quite good. Found myself trying to pick it apart but not many flaws in the armor. Something didnt make me freak out about it but very good."
"Pours a copper color with an off-white head that's pretty puny and fades quickly. Not much lacing either. Popping the cap yields an absolutely intoxicating citrus scent - some tart apple, grapefruit, and maybe some peach. This got my hopes up for an exceptional taste, but it didn't quite match up. Grapefruit is most prominent in the taste, but there is a bit of spiciness from the rye in the background. Good, nicely balanced, but not outstanding. I'd go for one of these again."
"this beer rocks, and it would be a fantastic compliment to some of your favourite meat and cheese snackies. a beer worthy of the esteem and respect it has. highly recommended."
"Scores: Appearance 5/5; Aroma 3.5/5; Taste 4/5; Mouthfeel 4/5; Overall 4/5"
"D: This is a very good beer, it is well balanced and has a nice hoppy taste to it. Very enjoyable and easy to drink, I would say this could be a ""sessionable"" beer, even though the ABV is a bit higher than the ""session beers."" An excellent summer beer."
"Overall - Hard to place for me, but I enjoyed it."
"Pours a copper color with some orange highlights. 1 finger of white bubbles. Looks really nice. I smell hops- pine and grapefruit along with some alcohol. Intially I taste the nice Amarillo hops- nice amount of pine and grapefruit. Then I taste some sweetness from the malts and a little spiciness from the rye. A slight amount of alcohol in the flavor profile. The mouthfeel is light to medium with some light carbonation. Overall this is a very nice easy drinking beer."
"O: This is simply a phenomenal Rye, and my favorite rye beer overall. It showcases every element and leaves me wanting little else from this brew. Founders simply can do no wrong. The He'Brew Bittersweet Lenny's is another excellent Rye IPA, but Red's Rye came out on top. One of my all-time favorites!"
"A dark amber with thin white head that leaves great walls of creamy lace. The aroma is a mixture of earthy hops, spice, and pine. Sweet caramel hints in the back with hints of leather. The taste is perfectly balanced. Nothing overpowering. A nice malty backbone of caramel and honey cut off with a bitter sword of pungent pine followed by fruity tones of citrus and pear. Some spicy and peppery notes from the rye complete a complex profile that finish with some floral/herbal tones. A mild and easy to drink beer. On the hoppy side, but nothing over the top. Very mild and very well balanced."
"O: Absolutely delicious and highly drinkable beer from Founders, my favorite rye beer that I have had to date."
"I am excited to try this since I haven't had a rye since Mild Winter. Pours a rich copper/amber with specks and a sizable tan head that leaves great lacing. The smell is strong on the hops, grapefruity, mingled with a sweet malt aroma, with a soft wave of rye following. Nice and bitter but I have a hard time detecting the rye amongst the very strong hopping. Smooth body amongst crisp carbonation, refreshing in it's own. This beer is great, can satisfy many a hophead, but I want more rye."
"O: A fine brew out of the bottle and a real treat to have on-tap. Tops the list at Clark Street Ale House tonight."
"O - Not a bad beer, interesting flavor and easy to get down. Would drink again."
"O - Wow, at first I really didn't care for this beer. Re-reviewing it with a fresh palate I can really appreciate it. Probably one of the best rye's I've ever had."
"Taste, pleasantly surprised just how much rye went into this. Hopped well, but not trying to be an ipa either. Well, a little bit. Reminiscient of nugget nectar, not as bitter, but less in the appearance of a red as well. Great interplay between the rye flavor, caramel and the amarillo hops, ample bitterness is swallowed by the rye I suspect, all in all, it flows well together."
"Pours dark copper with a whitish head that sticks around. Very hoppy nose with floral and citrus notes - a touch of pine. The mouth is a little thin for my tastes. You definitely get the rye character with a nice robust hop profile. Finishes relatively clean. A nice example of a solid rye ale - not life changing - but definitely worth a sample."
"So pleasing to my hop-craving taste buds. I don't have many ryes to compare it to but this one seems to be missing the somewhat wheaty character I find in Hop Rod Rye. Still amazing!"
"M – Each sip leaves you with a pleasant, rolling bitterness. Medium/light body."
"O: This is a damn fine tasting rye/IPA beer. Really awesome. The amarillo hops did a wonderful job with this beer, as they do with most beers. The only problem with the beer is the too light feel, but like the overall score indicates, FAR from being a deal breaker for me."
"O: Overall, I'm confused but I think I like it. It's definitely an IPA in sheep's clothes but I don't quite know what's missing. Since it's a Rye though, this is quite a delicious beer."
"Served from bottle into a Grolsch Pilsner. Poured red-orange with a half finger off-white head that remained throughout. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, subtle grain, and subtle citrus hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, and slight grain. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. If I am honest this might have been the best Rye Beer offering I have had to-date. Very nicely balanced and enjoyable. The citrus aspect really blended well with the grain aspect going on here. The aroma was very nice as well on this one. A definite must try!"
"Pours a red amber with hints of burnt orange and holds a finger of fluffy head. Nose has grapefruit pith upfront along with pine resin, light malt sweetness to go along with some spicy grain. The taste has some a nice malty richness to go along with rye bread, citrus and pine forest. Finishes with a touch of resin and pretty dry and bitter on the finish compared to the malt upfront. Pretty straightforward beer, definitely good but not really that special."
"O: I have a lot of respect for this beer, and I always will. No matter how many PA’s I have in my lifetime, I can almost guarantee that this will remain amongst the top spots. I love this beer."
"EDIT: Pairing sidenote: before my second bottle was finished, I made some cheese pizza with lots of garlic and sriracha. The beer stands up really well to these bold flavors, with the sweetness coming out a lot more than when I just drank the beer on its own. This beer would be a great choice for pairing with hot and spicy foods."
"This is one of my favorite beers and I will definitely buy this again (soon and often). Wonderful flavor, spot-on balance, and very easy to drink. This is why we drink craft beers. I could drink this every day."
"O- A good beer all around. I would have to seen a more assertive character, though, I suppose, particularly in the aroma, it may be there, but is merely covered by the hops. That being said, it's a fun, tasty, well hopped beer."
"O: Overall it's an ok IPA but I can get an IPA a dime a dozen that taste like this. I would really like more rye flavor to make it unique."
"D-Overall this was a great rye beer.Had good flavors thoughout and was very drinkable. Could enjoy a 6 pack of this anyday!"
"D: the color of an amber, the flavor of an IPA, and the finish of a rye beer. overall, very interesting beer. pretty drinkable indeed. interesting mix of styles. hard to put a ""rye"" or any specific title on it for that matter."
"D. Quite a good offering. I could down a few of these. The only downside is the lack of aromas, still an okay beer though."
"This is a solid American Pale Ale, though I'm not sure how much I'd want to call it a ""rye beer."" The hops are aggressive, but tempered by the malt presence. Overall good, but I'd like to see more rye presence."
"Had this on tap at Shark Club in Howell. Pours a deep amber-brown colour with thick off-white head. Tons of lacing down the glass. Smells of fresh grapefruity hops with lots of bready malt base. Bitterness level is quite nice, though balanced out with the sweetness. I think this could be hoppy enough to be considered an IPA even. A really nice beer."
"Good stuff. Strong bitter aftertaste that lingers but a good beer."
"Medium bodied, decent carbonation, sticky and dry on the palate. This is one of, if not my favorite rye beers where you can actually taste the rye presence amidst the other flavors. Another awesome beer from Founders."
"M- Medium carbonation and dry finish make this beer drinkable and desirable. A solid tasting beer with a deep flavor that holds your interest."
"O - Don't think rye bread, think actual rye making out with hops and sweating citrus. A really refreshing beer, akin to the effect tasty double IPAs have on me."
"O- Wonderfully crafted beer with great balance and flavor. I have been hearing about this one for a while and am glad to finally be tasting. Cheers!"
"I'm not a hophead but I really enjoyed this one with a reasonable 70 IBUs. I'd not drink 2 at a sitting but will go back to this in the future."
"Overall: this is a good beer. Its fairly imaginative and I can't say I've had any beer quite the same as this and don't really have anything in mind to compare it to. Founders is one of the best breweries in the country, if not the best and this is another example of why. I would give this one a try as soon as you can. Cheers!"
"Overall a well crafted craft beer. Nothing offensive and tons of positives. Flavor is well balanced between sweet and hoppy. Also a slightly spicy rye flavor."
"This is my first time sampling this beer and I think it's a wonderful offering from Founders."
"Pocked up a sox via Bierkraft. Glad I did. It was a sub for the out of stock ruination but a great new find. One of the finest amber colored beers I have ever tried. Nice tannish head and decent lacing iny tasting glass. The smell is awesome. Herbal delight of malts and citrus. The taste is great too. O don't always pick up on subtleties but this is a complex brew. Nice bitterness of hops and citrus a sweetness and cooked malt combination. Well worth rhecweek waiting for delivery. Mouthfeelis good. Medium nodded and the alcohol is masked. Will try again and again nut too good to session out due tonlimited availability in Spain."
"Overall - A good beer, especially being a rye beer. But I feel like it was a bit over-peppered, and left an unpleasant burning sensation in my throat, as if I had a sore throat."
"O: Worthy of an epilogue. The highlight of the day, citrusy, rye-y, delicious. I'd love to see more of this."
"2015 Notes - I raised my ratings a bit."
"o: What a fun beer to have tried. I wouldn't choose it over the regular version everyday, but I'm really glad I had the chance to try it."
"O- This was decent. I liked the rye element, but it was just a little bland for me. Maybe this isn't my style. Easily drinkable though."
"Mouthfeel is creamy, light and crisp, with high carbonation, a medium body and a sweet malty finish that's dry and crisp with the rye present in a very appealing way; good drinkability, this went down easy and could make a good session beer."
"Poured into a mug a nice dark semi cloudy copper with red tints, good amount of off white foamy head. Nose is dominated by sharp citrus hops, floral auroma with a great balance of spicy notes and sweet malt. Taste follows the nose, nice rye blend that is subtle and replaced with sharp hops that are bitter at first and mellow leaving a dry finish. Has a resemblance to an Imperial Amber flavour, packs alot of flavour. Great tasting beer! Chewy and dry mouthfeel, medium bodied. I love the label of this beer. Overall, nice drinkability / abv. that rounds out a very quality beer from the makers of Founders. The rye is subtle enough to keep it an interesting flavour profile and the hops bring the brew to another level."
"Almost perfect in my book."
"I haven't had many Rye IPA's. This one is great, not as good as Hebrew Lenny Bruce, but very very good. It's nice to have an IPA with a slightly different grain flavor from time to time."
"D: Probably the best rye beer I've ever had. Another winner from Founders."
"Overall: Not bad, but not feeling it. Too much bitterness and high astringency for my tastes."
"The only thing actually bugging me about this beer is the classification. As much as there's rye in it, I think it should be in the IPA category. The amount of rye I tasted was pretty slim, or perhaps buried beneath all the hops. I need to try another bottle or two to see if mine is off, but it seems like an IPA with a touch of rye added."
"O: Very easy drinking despite the bitter and dry finish. Pretty good beer that I'm sure to drink again."
"O overall this was awesome. I love Rye beers and this one did not dissapoint."
"O - One of the better rye beers I've tried, I like the big citrus profile and the ""clean"" taste of the rye. Could see picking a six pack of this up as my ""go to"" beer this summer."
"D-well it doesn't exactly have the qualities to make this a great drinker. the tastes just aren't something i would want a lot of. i really wanted to try this, i'm glad i did, but it isn't something i need again."
"Very good and easy drinking brew for the abv and overall I thought it was good. Not exactly the kind of beer I would seek out and buy again though. It's just not amazing"
"D: This is a good, well balanced beer. The sweetness of the rye and malts comes through, but it's clear in the taste why they used a play on words in the name ""Rye P.A."" The hoppiness of an IPA is definitely present, combining with the rye and giving this beer a distinct flavor."
"D: It is a fantastic variation of the I.P.A; one of my favorite go-tos."
"D- overall a solid beer. I could drink several in a sitting. I'd love to get this by me, especially on tap!"
"d- drinkable but not too many for me"
"D - Not too bad. I enjoyed this one but the overall bready feel really brought the drinkability down a few notches. I felt like I ate half a loaf of hoppy bread after only one glass."
"D - Delicious and well crafted flavors all around. One of the better offerings from an amazing brewery."
"On tap last night at Canary Sq in JP. Served in a standard pint glass. Dark shady orange colored body. Thin white head. Smell was very floral and citrusy. I liked the flavor very much. Not as hoppy or bitter as I was expecting. Hints of lemon and grapefruit along with fresh hop flavors. Very crisp mouthfeel, with a smooth body. Very easy beer to drink. The more rye beers I try, the more I like them. Add this one to the list of winners."
"The bitterness seems higher than 70 IBUs, but that may be due to rye giving some acrid flavor tones to the beer. It reduces the drinkability and those who are not lovers of strong IPAs will find this one a bit difficult to last through."
"D: Not much out of place to detract... high honors."
"Overall, I'm really digging this beer. While I would love for this to be a bit fresher, it still taste great once the hops have faded a bit. Certainly I'll re-review if I get a fresh bottle."
"Pour red as the name implies (actually ruby) with a nice white head, solid lacing. Smell is intensely hoppy, very much like an IPA. Again, taste is also hoppy, but not as bitter as the hop profile would make you think. pretty good balance in the flavor. Hops are on the fruity side. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and slightly creamy. Very good brew from Founders as usual. Took me a while to finally sit down with one of these, but glad I did."
"Full boded for the style with lots of dank, resinous oily hops countered by a slightly toasty, sweet malt backbone. Nice hop presence up front with a good balance of earthy,dry bitterness and sweet citrus flavor. Hints of grapefruit and orange peel as well as some earthy pine. The malt backbone is sweet with a prominent rye character as well as hints of subtle caramel, biscuit and toffee. Really well balanced, refreshing and insanely drinkable with a slight dry finish."
"d- could drink a 12 pack..soo tastey and still light..very dry"
"Easy to drink and very good offering."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is dangerously high! Overall, this is one fantastic brew, just another reason why Founder's is at the top of the hill when it come to craft beer. Skal."
"Knowing how amazing Founder's is, I am going to give this the benefit of the doubt that this just isn't right because of freshness issues. I'd love to rer-eview this from tap or a fresher bottle."
"Overall: Definitely better for rye fans."
"D: Complex, enjoyable and refreshing. Rye adds a nice kick to the hop character while the malts round out the brew with just the right amount of body and sweetness. Balanced, interesting and enjoyable."
"D - A wonderfully drinkable beer"
"The taste isn't quite as complex as the nose. A little lemon, pepper and a pine-bitter finish, but not as much of the spicy complexity that I like from a rye beer. Still a fine, quaffable example of the style and well worth a try."
"D: would be able to drink a few of these without to much trouble."
"Drinkability is outstanding and like many Founders brews, iit is a regular resident in my fridge."
"No freshness date, poured into a Bear Republic pint glass. Pours a cloudy orange color with a massive and fluffy orange head. Specks of lacing down the side of the glass, good retention. Lots of hops in the nose, with rye spiciness. Loads and loads of rye hit first in the taste, with some piney hops and bready malt. Mouthfeel is a bit thin feeling, extremely high carbonation. Drinkability is great, the tasty rye and light mouthfeel make this one I could drink a few of in a sitting,"
"Haven't had many rye beers, but this one has me interested in trying more."
"D - Most excellent! Not really a session beer but a great tasting, high quality brew from Founders. Liked this one a lot."
"D - A pretty easy beer to drink, nice flavours."
"D- ""Sessionable"" compared to the others... Quite palatable and enjoyable!"
"Mouthfeel is smooth and silky, with the end, as mentioned earlier, herbally clean. Approaches thin at times, but flirts with the line well, offering up a delectably light yet full-bodied texture. Drinkability is flawless, finish + start = a great mixture of palate cleansers + sensitizers that can't be topped. Nothing is too strong, nothing is too weak; there is nothing left to be said I guess. Top, top beer, regardless of style."
"D - good on hot days served about 50 degrees great with BBQ. I drink some every month."
"This is a very pleasant, refreshing and quite drinkable beer."
"Drinkability: This is one of the best examples of a rye beer I've had, the rye elements here work well with belgian malts and whatever hop they used. Very good. Drinkability is very high."
"D: I thoroughly enjoy how these flavors work together. They blend so nicely while being distinguishable at the same time, and result in an excellently balanced beer. I could drink another one (or more) to continue exploring this."
"Overall I enjoyed this beer don't think I would buy a case but definatly another 6er. This is my first rye beer, alot like an IPA. I would recommend this brew. Another good offering from founders"
"D: easy to drink. very enjoyable overall. would certainly drink again and could see it being in the rotation if available in my area."
"D_Drinks like a good IPA with a slight spicy note. Reminiscent of Hop Rod Rye."
"D: Goes down easily; with no detectable alcohol, a complex flavor, and the uniqueness lent to it by the rye, this beer is enjoyable for a long time, and one that I'll be returning to soon."
"Another treat from founders. I think I already prefer it to their standard IPA and it's at least on a par with Double Trouble."
"D- Full of taste and drinkability, you'll want to stock up on this one."
"Drinkability was where this beer seemed to falter. As much as I respect the style, the combination of dry, bitter hops and sour rye notes was a bit too much for me to handle. If you are a fan of Hop Rod Rye and other super hoppy rye beers, you will likely enjoy this as well."
"Drinkability: Rye does interesting and wonderful things to beer, and this is no exception. The balance of wet, juicy hops and rye is amazing. Founders executes well, and this is welcome anytime in my fridge."
"It's a little heavy to drink 6 of them at once, but I sure wouldn't mind another one. The 6.6% alcohol is well hidden, increasing the drinkability."
"D - Yup, pretty nice. Definitely would rock it as a session beer. The rye was a new twist for me and I enjoyed it."
"This beer pours a beautiful ruby red/amber into your glass with a one finger cream colored head that laces the glass. Based on the aromas this beer gives off, if I didn't know any better I'd guess this was an IPA and not a PA. It begins bitter before ending sweet and malty. It has excellent flavor which tends to be more on the malty side. The hops aren't as big of a characteristic as they could be. It is sweet and has a ""different"" accent to it as well, I'm guessing that's the rye. It drinks very crisp and has good carbonation. It's between light and medium in body and drinks well. It's very good for the style and an exceptional brew."
"Overall, a really great beer."
"Acidity might stand some tinkering, but really a great beer. I plan on getting this one again."
"A wonderful beer with great flavor! I love that the flavors are distinct and have a delightful balance of hops and malt. This is a well crafted brew."
"Drinkability: A very under appreciated beer from Founders by me. I often overlook this for their other offerings, but this is a very solid rye based beer."
"Overall: I've already said it. This on is in my top 10 for sure. Very drinkable...great taste...great balance...keeps you coming back. Definitely my top Rye beer. Highly recommended."
"D -- Yet another solid offering from the brewers at Founders. Well constructed and worth a try."
"Had this in a bar that didn't seem like they would have a micro but they had Red's Rye so boy was I happy when I found this."
"And with that it feels and tastes like one too. Typical hop and grapefruit associated with an IPA in finish, palate and mouthfeel. I was expecting something a little more unique for a Rye beer but this is still tasty. However, it feels like just another good solid American IPA instead of something distinct. Can't say I am blown away by it either so I am going to probably never desire this again."
"D: Very good overall beer. Love the play between the rye and hop character and balance."
"A very enjoyable beer, but not world class. Perhaps my expectations were too high. I don't get as much rye as I'd like. It's a very enjoyable and dry-enough grapefruit beer."
"M&D- This is a bit thicker than the centennial. It gives a nice mouth feel and definitely makes you feel like its a beer. I would recommend this beer to everyone. It incorperates everything an IPA would have but add's a bit more with the rye."
"D - As high as it gets. Very well balanced, and tasty. I have not been able to find it in stores here in Atlanta, but I am keeping my eyes open."
"Overall if I had access to this beer all the time I would buy 6 packs but I don't so I don't think I will trade for it again. Good to try it though."
"D - I had a sixer but never went past 2 in one sitting. At first it appears almost session-able because it is quite smooth going down. However the dry finish lingers a bit. This beer would be great at lunch with a reuben or other deli sandwich."
"D: Good beer, a bit too much going on in the bottle. Wish the amarillo's were balanced with something else. Will not seek out, but wouldn't turn down either."
"Drinkability- the full taste of this beer makes it a sipper. I wouldn't drink more than one. But its not difficult to drink by any means..."
"Pours a deep reddish brown color with a thick unrelenting yellowish white head with a ton of lacing. Smells of hops and rye. Tastes of piny hops, rye, and a little caramel malt in there. Bitterness is just right. Mouthfeel is medium with a good carbonation. Drinkability is medium as well. Best Founder's beer to date."
"The CPJ"
"D: I've always considered this to be one of my ""go-to"" brews available in my area. This is a craft beer lovers ""candy beer"" for sure!"
"This is my first taste of Founders Brewing and I must say I am impressed. I am usually bound to buy the typical Belgium Trippel's and Quad's, but this bottle struck my eye at Total Wine. The beer pours a nice red color, and it tastes fantastic. The carbonation is not overpowering and you can taste the Rye and hops. A well balanced beer that I see myself buying in the future. I definitely recommend this beer to anyone."
"Pours a bright, hazy amber with a reddish tinge. Thin white head. Smells of piny hops and black pepper spice. Faint malt sweetness quickly gives way to faint citrus and piny, herbal hops with a huge pepper character. Maybe a little woody? This beer is a total spice bomb. Alcohol is well-hidden. Fair carbonation, very smooth. Extremely enjoyable."
"d 4-4.5 i cracked open a hop rod for comparison and it sucked--finally too elderly i'm afraid. will need to get fresher hop rod and redo."
"Poured into dimple glass from bottle. Pours a cloudy ruby color with some floaties. The decent size beige head is mostly lasting. Aroma is caramel with pine and citrus hops. Flavor begins with sweet malts but finishes with a well balanced bitterness from the pine/citrus hops. medium bodied. The finish is rather dry."
"D- This was an excellent brew that I wish was available locally."
"D-Surprisingly very drinkable. Never really enjoyed a rye beer, but this one definitely makes me think twice about the style. I can't really get over the drinkability. I guess that is why it is near the best rye beer."
"Drinkability- nicely drinkable for a hoppy beer. Finished a glass with no difficulty"
"drinkability: very refreshing when your in the mood for something light."
"Smooth, easy drinking, bountiful hop character but not overly bitter. Interesting and creative. I like it."
"D- I really enjoy this one. However, the rye factor only seems to give an otherwise solid IPA a crispness it otherwise might not have. That is, I was hoping for a rich, spicy character that I didn't find. That said, I'll certainly seek it out in the future."
"RUN, don't walk to get this beer!!"
"Drink - I like this beer; nonetheless, I could only do one of these at a sitting. I will be buying some more of this in the future."
"very high. ABV not to high and it's readily available. Might be one of the most sessionable rye beers I've had. Tastes great and not too expensive."
"D. Very good, but not incredible. I will reach for it again, but this is not an everyday beer for me."
"Great ipa!"
"Easy to drink. I could have several of these. Definitely among my favorites."
"Very drinkable. My favorite from founder's so far."
"Great brew."
"d- drinking the bottle is clearly not an issue, but not sure i would want to line a bunch of these up in a row for one sitting."
"On the heavy side of body for a Pale Ale, with a creamy low-mid carb bite."
"D: A really great brew that shows a bit of a classic of all ingredients used. A nice use of rye while still having a nice hop presence. Good classic Founder's taste that runs through all brews."
"Just maybe for a food that doesn't leave me so comatose as tonight's. Time to find some coffee."
"Overall/notes: Like their Centennial IPA, Founders has a beer that's just easy to drink and tasty, here. This one may even be better. I've never had a rye beer, but I'm downloading the style to my memory banks for future purchases. Really well-rounded brew that I'd say you should try if you haven't already."
"D - I could definitely drink a couple of these on a summer day."
"Creamy mouthfeel, almost slides down the gullet. The ABV leaves you wanting more."
"Opens seriously bitter with a blast of citrus hops and suggestions of grapefruit pith. Moves into a deftly balanced, rich caramel malt middle. Crisp mouthfeel. Medium bodied with expressive carbonation. Rye character begins to emerge. Finishes grainy with a scratch of spiced rye on the back of the throat."
"Big juicy red - a bit thin and burny, but close to a classic."
"D: With the medium body and only subtle bitterness, this beer is highly drinkable. It would be a great beer to ease into IPAs for a new advocate. The bitterness is not overpowering, and the sweetness will keep those new guys interested. I do not think I could drink a lot of these throughout the night, because the flavor is rather intense, but this does not hurt the overall rating of the beer."
"This make me want to do the Humpty Hump. Can I have a case delivered to my doorstep ever other week?"
"D - Very drinkable, refreshing beer. I put several of these away after the first one. Nicely done beer."
"D- Great tasting brew that stands out because of its unique style. Try one!"
"Drinkability - This is a very nice brew. The bitterness was delicate and fitting. This beer would be very special during the Spring of the year. Easily drinkable at 6.6 ABV. I could drink a few of these at one sitting easily. The head stayed around for the entire beer. Amazing!!!"
"M/D: Medium bodied with nice carbonation. Goes down smooth, very drinkable. Overall a very nice beer. Even though its a rye beer, the spiciness was a little surprising."
"D: the hop assualt seems a bit on the strong side for a pale ale and there is a lack of malty goodness to back it up. This lack of balance, while dilicous, hurts drinkability. I honestly liked this beer more than the grade reflects."
"Overall a decent brew, but didn't quite live up to the expectations I had following my experiences with their good scotch ale and fantastic porter."
"D: Robust all the way around, the color, the malts, the hops.... Actually leans on the hop angle of the P.A. part of the name a tad more than the Rye. But the rye does still come through. A bit too dark to really be called a pale. Verging toward an amber. Nothing wrong with any of this, it is one nice and tasty drinker."
"this beer pours a reddish amber color with a tan head that leaves a nice bit of lace on the side of the glass. the aroma brings a goodly bit of malt and peppery rye almost overshadowing the citrus hops. the taste reflects the aroma with a bit of fruity sweetness, before the peppery and citrus finish. very nice mouthfeel for a rye, not overpoweringly heavy, so a very good drinkable rye p a...."
"D: a good easy drinker... Kinda impressed me."
"Pours a deep amber red color with a thick soapy off-white head. Has an aroma of grapefruit, caramel, and rye, with hints of pint. Has a DIPA feel to it but with the rye flavor on the aftertaste. A nice creamy mouthfeel. Has a nice hop hit as well. Not a fan of Rye Pale Ales, but this one is very good. Not a surprise coming from Founders."
"D: Definitely a beer to drink about an hour after dinner, very filling but one of my favorites!"
"4.0 D: Solid beer, but something you have to be in the mood for in order to have a really enjoyable experience. That said, I might have given this a much higher score on another day, but it's hard to say for sure. Still, this is good enough anytime."
"very smooth mouthfeel, very drinkable."
"Drinkability: Very good, this being not an overly complex beer and so balanced you can hardly notice that it has 6.8% alcohol. I could drink more than a few of these at a time. I will definitely try this one again."
"Red's Rye is one of the few brews that I'll go for virtually every time I see it available. A fantastic beer - with all due respect to Terrapin and Bear Republic, this one is the benchmark for world-class rye pale ales."
"Pretty good IPA all around. Not too aggressively bitter but it doesn't lack punch. Heavy on the pine and pretty clean."
"Taste is really rye forward, it's got that bitter rye bite that's a bit almost minty. Theres a pretty solid bitterness from the hops as well that rounds it out nicely. Mouthfeel is nice and full."
"The word balance keeps coming up as I describe each facet of this wonderful rye brew. It seems that a lot of care was taken by the brewers to balance each aspect of the drinking experience. Judged as an IPA it's fairly mellow, but that doesn't mean that it's not a full-flavored brew. I'm sure that I could put a couple of these away without much effort, but the 70 IBUs combined with the 6.6% ABV knock down the drinkability a smidge. However, Red's Rye is still well worth seeking out and highly recommended."
"Another great offering from one of the finest breweries out there."
"D - Very excellent brew, had great flavor and complexity that was great. The flavors mix well with the high carbonation to give this brew a nice bitter/sweet character. Only set back would be that this brew is more an IPA, then a rye, but im a fan of IPA's and of Founders, so not true points lost."
"The beer has a nice spicy rye character which interacts very well with the hops. A bit sweet and a bit caramel up front, while the after-taste is bitter and planty. The beer coats your mouth, but is also dry. It is quite a treat."
"Don't pass on this uniquely crafted brew. Complex but yet so original."
"The beer pours a hazy amber color. The head is frothy, and very thick. The smell is of caramel malt, citrus hops, and a hint of bread. The taste is somewhat creamy. There is an earthy, malt spicy flavor to the beer. The rye plays a good part with this being amber with an orange tint and the earthy spicy malt character. Mouthfeel is medium, not a lot of carbonation. As far as drinkability yeah I could see having a few of these."
"D - Founders got it right with this mixture. A lot of taste, but you can easily down 1-3 of these to relax. A beer I will look foward to having many times in the future."
"Overall: A great example of the style. A classic and another home run from Founders. I'ts about tied with Cane and Ebel for the title of best rye beer in my book. Great brew!"
"It's medium on the palate with perfect carbonation. It's hard to drink only one Red's Rye Pale Ale and anything that follows other than another Red's has a tendency to be disappointing."
"The taste is very bitter with a complex of malt flavors. The rye is very nice but the bitterness is somewhat harsh and very forward. It limited my interest in finishing this beer and interfered with the otherwise nice complexity of the malts and hop flavors."
"Deep amber body with a solid 1/2 inch of light tan head and nice retention - really nice looking beer! Lots of floral and citrus hops in the nose, maybe a hint of rye as well. I get alot of hops upfront in the taste, which gets balanced out quickly with a nice dose of malt and spicy rye, and a somewhat bitter finish. Medium bodied and decent carbonation, I did get a bit more heat than I would expect from a beer of this ABV percentage."
"D - Very enjoyable beer that I would definitely recommend but I would call it an IPA instead of rye beer."
"This is one hell of a good beer. Perfect IPA character in my opinion by offering a crisp, hoppy flavor with terrific aroma. Love the red color and slightly tan head. I think the packaging on this beer should be changed, because I've seen this before in the store and have just walked on by. Man am I glad I finally stopped and grabbed a sixer. Kudos to Founders for putting together a beer that follows the West Coast example of hoppiness and ABV, while using unique ingredients over your run of the mill IPA. I can't see how anyone wouldn't like this beer."
"This poured a very nice deep red with a nice fluffy head that had good retention, and left nice lacing on the glass. There were also quite a few carbonation bubbles to look at. The smell was that of rye and breadiness. There were also notes of cirtus, grapefruit, and some malty toastiness. This beer was nice and hoppy with a nice amount of bitterness. I thought this was a nicely balanced beer. The taste also included some citrus, nice amount of rye, and some lemon zest. The mouthfeel was good. It coated the mouth nicely, and had a medium body with nice carbonation. The drinkability was good as well. I think I could keep drinking these all night. I really enjoyed this beer. Another fine Founders beer. Keep up the good work guys. Cheers."
"The taste had a delicious hoppiness that was just bitter enough without being too bitter. A nice hint of rye was backed up by the flavors of a good red ale. It made me think of a higher-end Killian's with more hoppy flavor. I'm not sure if that's what the brewers were going for...maybe my palate was just shot. The creamy and full mouthfeel went down pleasantly and was very enjoyable. I highly recommend."
"Drinkability -- A great APA with solid rye character. Nice contrast from the traditional APA. Must try."
"(D)- A great rye beer. Not my favorite style, but I always would reach for this one. Most tend to be over-done in the rye smell and flavor department, but this one is nicely balanced. Would not expect anything less from Founders."
"D-Could have 10"
"The first thing you taste is fruity hops. The aftertaste comes on slowly and doesn't have much bitter kick. The rye is noticeable here. This beer has good carbonation and so it has some volume in the mouth. A very nice brew."
"medium-bodied mouthfeel with carbonation decidedly on the low side; still, pretty drinkable in my book. enjoyable beer."
"This beer was strikingly similar to Flying Dog's Raging Bitch. I'm not convinced they aren't the same beer actually. That being said, this one is a bit more malty, while The Bitch has a bit more hop to it."
"O: Very good selection from a great brewery. One of my favorite session beers."
"D: Very drinkable, could easily throw a few back. Cant wait ti get more."
"D: I'd order another pint, but this bottle seems past despite being only 2 months old."
"the appearance of this beer is a rusty, redish brown, color. It smells of aroma hops i almost wanna say they used a bittering hop, such as chinook, as the aroma hop. lots of nasty bitter hops, i love it. I smell a mild tea aroma to. The taste is of nasty bittering hops....if you are a hop head like me you will love it...if you are not i assure you this beer is not for you. A creamy mouthfeel. The drinkability of this beer is not so much, as it is 6.8% abv>>>>This is one of my favorite beers. I get it about once a month from columbus, GA. Because they do not offer this beer in my area."
"Drinkabilty - GReat beer. One of the best ryes out there. Not quite the hop rye killer that hoprod is but very nice and smooth. I really like how the hops and rye work with eachother to create this great beer, i could drink a few of these in one sitting."
"Drinkability: Hides the ABV well, and is definitely a beer I could have more than one of. Very balanced, with a complex flavor/aroma combo."
"This beer deserves the high marks it receives. Founders is as good as any brewery in America. They certainly know how to do big limited release beers but their everday, bread and butter offerings are the real treasures."
"D - I think this is my favorite rye beer now this stuff is awesome tastes great this is a beer that I would try to drink all night worth getting your hands on to try"
"Bottle. Pours a very nice reddish brown color with a fluffy 2 finger head taht slowly settles and leaves a nice lace as it goes down. Fruity floral hop aroma fills my noise as I take my first sniff. An interesting first taste as the rye used gives a different type of taste compared to the usual malt profile. Nice an smooth subtle sweetness then gives way to a nice hop bite that lingers. Some citrus rind type bitterness along with fruit and floral. Pretty tasty! Nicely balanced. Medium mouthfeel. Minimal alcohol notes."
"d- solid beer here, i would drink this one again, i'm convinced that founders doesn't make a bad beer."
"D: this is an excellent brew! It has nice rye character and has an interesting hop profile which pairs nice with the rye."
"This beer is very drinkable; it's light enough to keep you coming back and complex enough to make each sip very interesting. Overall, a quality beer from Founder's. Get you some Red's RyePA ASAP."
"I could easily make this a go-to beer, and a session beer, if it was just slightly more affordable. Instead, I milk every bottle like it's going extinct. But I'm sure I'll come back to this one whenever I can."
"Very nice"
"D- This is my go to beer when I see it on tap. I can drink this beer all night long. Founders hit this one out of the park with this beer. Fantastic beer that is a easy drinker."
"The beer pours a reddish-amber color with a white head. The aroma is strong rye with some orange citrus notes. There is no doubt that this beer has a lot of rye in it. The flavor is rye with a lot of hop character. I get some pine, orange citrus and pineapple, as well as some toffee. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very good beer."
"Overall: Excellent beer overall. Another great offering by Founders. I would highly recommend this."
"Highly drinkable for this hop-head, and at 6.8%, not mind-cloundingly strong to the point that you're one and done. My only regret is that I bought this as a singleton instead of the whole six-pack."
"Medium brown, cloudy, even cream head. Lots of lacing. Smells nice and hoppy - citrus and grapefruit and mango and pineapple. Resinous hop flavor with a medium malt balance. The rye comes through subtly but pleasant. Nice lingering bitterness and hoppy aftertaste. Great pale ale overall - rye balances the hop bitterness really nicely."
"side note: my bottle said 6.6% ABV vs. the 6.8% listed on this site."
"D: Goes down pretty well, but it's really heavy - a meal in itself."
"I thought I wouldn't have a beer this week that would rate above a B, but this one is really good. I might be a bit partial, seeing this beer comes from my hometown, (I did not know it until I tasted it and got curious about where it was brewed), but that withstanding, this is a good, unique beer. This is about to be my favorite style. This brew gave me about a one finger head of light brown suds and finally faded after about two minutes, the color is a rich dark amber-red rating a 26 on the SRM chart. The smell of apple, grapefruit, currant, rye, caramel, sweet malt, and raspberry are the strongest smells, with a hint of clover. This is a wonderful flavor far from your run of the mill brew. This beer has the flavor of grapefruit, berries, apple, malt, and finishes with a great bitter flavor of hops. The more I drink of this the better I like it. I am so glad I have access to this in the south. Feels like cream in my mouth, nice tingle and buzz as it passes over my tongue and down my throat. I only bought one bottle of this, but it sure won't be my last, and next time it will be in bigger quantities. For sure I will share this with my friends, I am sure some will not like it as much as I, but that is why we are all individuals."
"D-A pretty easy drinking beer but the drying qualities and lack of mildly chewier mouthfeel hurt my enjoyment of this one."
"D- im having a hard time finishing this one, it tastes like im sucking on bitter hops that have a bit of spice to it, not for me"
"Goes down like swimming in your esophagus, although the 6.6 abv maybe is a bit low."
"D - Pretty drinkable. The rye gives it a spicy tinge but this beer doesn't have a lingering bitterness. A solid beer worth trying but I don't see how it is in the top 100."
"Cheers!"
"This is great for anyone. I would recommend this to my friends who are just getting into craft beer, and my BA friends alike. This is a versatile brew!"
"Overall- no need for a long review here, you get what you hope for and expect. This is excellent!"
"Founders, Bells, Great Lakes - If you're listening, we want you in Colorado!"
"Surprisingly good. I really liked it. Immensely drinkable. Mouthfeel is juicy, chewy, and fluffy, all at once."
"D - Even if this was just marked as an IPA I'd find the hops too intense for my personal tastes, but if that's your style then you might like it. Just don't expect any rye."
"Finally tried my first Founder's and it ain't no flounder....beer came in a bottle with no freshness date. Pours a deep translucent, unfiltered, reddish copper color, with a thick frothy head. The beer didn't quite smack me with the smell of fresh hops I was suspecting when I cracked it, and I think this beer is fairly fresh, and I can smell a sweet malty backbone. The taste is of grapefruity hops, you can tell it was dry hopped, has that extra-deep pungent layer of hops in there you get from the process, that extra pucker at the end in the aftertaste. But I don't pick up much rye in there, yet there is a maltiness to round out the hoppiness going on here. The label mentions rye, and belgium malts, but honestly, and it could all be due to a slight lack of freshness (please start date stamping these!?), I am a little disappointed with the lack of complexity in the taste of this brew. I love Amarillo hops too! I think it was fresh cause I bought it from a decent store with good turnaround, etc. I know what hoppy beers taste like when they fade....but overall, this is a pretty good beer that I found pretty darn drinkable, despite my complaints. But where is the rye (hell, even always watery Goose Island Mild Winter has way more rye than this)? Oh wait, I taste it, hmm, or did I...and those belgian malts, really?"
"Overall this is fantastic session beer that balances sweet malts, bitter hops and a dry characteristic. Very nice"
"D: I'm a huge IPA fan and a pretty big fan of rye so I was expecting great things from this beer, and I wasn't let down. The rye was a little outshined by the hops, but overall a very good beer that I'd have again if it was local."
"Overall, I am impressed. This is only my second time trying the beer, but I will be returning soon!"
"I expected Founders to bring a top PA,but gimme a Sierra, A Mirror Pond,a Burning River,or better yet a Yakima Twilight."
"Overall - An excellent and supremely well balance brew... definitely recommended..."
"Not the most drinkable but pretty good for the sweetness."
"D- Very drinkable, very surprising beer, really loved it and would have it again."
"D- This is a good beer. This is my first for this style of beer and looking forward in trying some more."
"On tap at Trappeze in Athens. Poured into a pint glass. Off- white fluffy head, nice retention. Amber body. Aroma is grapefruity orange hoppiness and some mild malt sweetness. Smooth tasting, nice hop bite, caramel notes on the malt and juicy fruit salad goodness. Lovely."
"D- as it warms the flavors get more intense and spicier and for me one or two is enough because it becomes a little overwhelming...still a great beer but not exactly sessionable"
"Great appearance. The head-to-beer contrast is quite beautiful with nice lacing. First thing you smell is grapefruit and slightly burnt caramel. To me, the taste is in-line with the aroma - very citrusy, fruity and crisp, with that backing of malt. This beer is very smooth with a nice hit of hoppy bitterness at the top of your mouth as it goes down."
"Smell contains citrus notes, including grapefruit, candies such as caramel, and some rye as well. The taste is a mix of some hops, malt, a well balanced sweetness with a very clean aftertaste. It is a medium-bodied brew with just the right carbonation. Red`s Rye has very good drinkability, I wish that I had a few more bottles of this. I will be sure to pick up more of it the next time I am in a state that gets distribution of Founders !"
"Thin off-white head that leaves bountiful lace. The aroma is a tropical fruit melange. And some of that resiny taste in the background. The taste follows suit to an extent. You've got your tropical fruit blend. But also some sweet marmalade like tones. The bitterness is sharp, yet clean. And there's a dulled spiciness present that is a contribution from the rye rather than alcohol I believe."
"d - A pretty good rye beer. Lots of hops in the nose, but more malts in the taste. Would have again."
"Picked this up at Save-On, a great beer store in Mentor Ohio. Clear copper pour with quickly fading head and decent lacing. Nice big earthy, herbal nose with hints of toffee, caramel, citrus and rye. The taste is very unique and has a lot going on. The bitterness of the hops hits you first, but is nicely offset by a solid roasty, caramel malt backbone. Hints of tea, pine, grass, resin, toffee, and of course rye. The rye really comes to the forefront as it warms. Great chewy and resiny mouthfeel makes this quite drinkable for me. The spicy rye bitterness is there from start to finish. Only my second experience with Founders, but they're two for two so far! May have just taken over first place with me for Rye PA's."
"another thanks to irishkyle21 for sending this one my way, I regret giving the second bottle to a friend before tasting it, I may have been selfish had I'd known how much I would've enjoyed, that's OK though my mother always told me to share the love"
"Red's Rye PA is a great beer. It pours into the glass with a nice two finger head and a rich red color. It is a good balance of serious hops and gentle malt to make for a full and complete smooth yet hoppy flavor. It comes it at 6.6 abv and 70 IBUs according to the brewery."
"This is a highly drinkable beer, just a bit to bitter for more than 2 or 3, but great tasting, done very well."
"I had this on cask at George Keeley's on Manhattan's upper west side. I'm not a huge fan of cask versions but I always try them and this was better than most. Surprisingly good carbonation, nice flavor, not too warm. If you see it, get it."
"pours a copper brown color with good off white frothy head, good lacing, and lively carbonation. sweet bread caramel like smell. taste was much the same with some bitter grass hints. thin slick texture and a light body. pretty harsh bitter bread like finish with an average flavor duration. good brew but nothing special."
"The rye in this, for my taste, takes just a little bit away from the drinkability, as compared to some of the IPAs that I could drink for days without hesitation. As it stands Rye PA is hella drinkable and worth revisiting again and again."
"Poured into a pint glass and boy did it look beautiful! Gorgeous copper in color with some brightness and a nice head. Smelled like heaven. Tons of hops in the nose, pine... grapefruit... caramel... rye. Awesome. Tasted pretty darn amazing as well--a beer crafted for me it seems as I love rye beers and all their spiciness, and yet I crave the hop assault of the DIPA. This was both, and yet strangely drinkable. I wouldn't want to drink them all night, but I'd like to have two or three a night pretty much every night of the week! Hops hops hops and rye (obviously) with just enough countering malt character to go down real smooth. Nice carbonation. Give me more! Love this one even more than the Centennial, and you can't compare it at all to the Breakfast Stout (the other Founders' I've tried), but everything I've had from them is phenomenal. Tastes a lot like Bear Republic's Hop Rod Rye, which is a great thing and each are one of my favorite brews. Wish there were more ""RyePA""s out there as good as these ones. Awesome stuff."
"Thoughts: Im pretty sure I have never had a bad or even average beer from Founders. I might be byased on this review. Everytime I have a Founders beer I think I already give it the benefit of the doubt. Probably not the best thing but w/e they rock."
"Very drinkable. I look forward to trying this again for sure. Maybe the best rye beer I've had."
"Pours a bright reddish copper with a nice dense off-white head. Strong citrus/pine hop aroma with a healthy touch of rye and caramel malt. Flavor has lots of pine and citrus, biscuit and caramel maltiness, a touch of dark fruit, a bit floral, and a dry bitter finish. Kind of tastes like a heavily American hopped ESB. Medium to full body that has a nice creamy texture to it."
"D. For a year round offering, this is an excellent beer (Founders does the same thing with their Porter and IPA). It perfectly melds big, bold hops with a nice malt bill for excellent drinkability. Glad to have finally tried this - it will be part of my regular purchase rotation."
"D- i would like to try this one with an amped up amount of rye. another solid year round beer from founders. i like they date their bottles, i just with they would make it a little easier to find and read. oh well, freshness usually isnt an issue with them around here anyways."
"I had this on tap into a tulip at the map room...A dark amber pour, nothing of note...The aroma is strong, lots of hop present with a light malt caramel backbone, a rye accent finish...the taste is mostly hoppy but in a good way, does not let the rye dominate or really present, hoppy throughout. Really nice feel, bitter, easy to drink."
"Served in a tulip. Pours a hazy amber with a consistent, half inch, off-white head composed of compressed, tiny bubbles below the surface of the cap. Head exhibits good retention with thick swaths and strands of lacing revealed during the tasting. Nose expresses sweet citrus notes on a toasted malt backbone with the merest suggestion of caramel. Taste is somewhat consistent with nose; however, sweetness is somewhat muted and an even bitterness comes out. Malt profile is a little more flat and earthy (the rye definitely makes itself known here) and finishes with a light, lingering bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium-light (closer to the lighter side of the spectrum) with a lively, semi-sparkling background carbonation. A solid beer with a great balance between malty and hoppy; sweet and bitter."
"Loads of hop bitterness on the tongue. Pine, citrus, caramel malts and once again more bitterness. This is a nice treat."
"D: Delicious flavor, great body, but the higher ABV limits sessionability. Still, this is easily the best rye beer I've ever had, and would rank highly on the IPA scale if it were so classified. Fantastic job by Founders on this one."
"D - very drinkable."
"D- this is an awesome brew. Excellent use of hops and rye. I would like to pair this up with a bunch of different stuff to see how it works."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonation is moderate. Drinkability is great, I really love this beer. This is one of those can drink any time beers. This is one of a few that is on my regular purchase list. Great beer overall."
"D-One of the best Rye-inspired beers in the world. Founders never misses when it comes to hops, and this is no different.This is an awesome beer that is unique and obviously worth trying. Unfortunately, this beer degrades quickly and the drop-off is big; so drink this ASAP because it becomes a different beer after a few short months."
"Easily one of the best ryes I've had."
" Body is just right, a medium character that is not too thick or syrupy. The rye provides a bit of a lightening effect, making it almost silky. An excellent, highly-hopped rye beer."
"D-this beer is delicious a great blend of hops and malt that can be enjoyed all night"
"Notes: Founders never disappoints me....ever. This is no exception."
"D - Very impressed with this beer. Flavorful and not too heavy. Makes me want more!"
"Overall a splendid beer. Has this many times on tap and always loved it. This is my first bottle but certainly not my last."
"D-Another very drinkable beer from Founders...one which is very different when it is allowed to warm a bit. Also, I might add, a hell of a value...I expected this to be offered in a 4 pack for the price of the 6 pack that it comes in."
"mouthfeel is not as luscious as i'd like, but really, the taste makes this really stellar. and drinkable. highly. at 6.6%...session with care. this would go well with casual but elegant 'pub' fare"
"Good drinkability, well balanced, nice, refreshing and very satisfying."
"All in all, this beer is pretty much a standard rye beer. For what it is supposed to do, it does well. Not my favorite style of beer, but I have nothing really negative to say about it. Give it a try, only you can decide for yourself. *Shrug*"
"D- Another great beer from Founders. Easy to drink and leaves you wanting more."
"Red's Rye is one of the best rye beers I have tasted. Its also a nicely balanced IPA. The rye is present, but never overwhelming. The caramel malt, and citrusy hops strike a nice balance. The alcohol never gets in the way. The drying hop qualities make this more drinkable than it should be. I tip my hat to Founders for creating a tasty world class quaff."
"D: This is one of the best full-time offerings that I've ever had from any brewery. It strikes the perfect balance for a ""Rye PA"" for me. There is a copious amount of citrus hop flavor, nice barley and rye malt, and yeasty breadyness available to my mouth. Simply put, this is a great beer."
"Dark, coppery red color, with a chucky thick head that stuck all over the glass. Smell was citrus, reminded me a strong grapefruit. Similar hoppy taste, except with a surprisingly prominent maltyness and of course the rye flavor. My first rye IPA, but my impression is that this beer was particularly well balanced and delicious!"
"D - A good beer. For a rye beer, which I'm not a fan of, it tasted ok. I would pick a IPA or PA which has a little more flavor to it. Still though I wouldn't be opposed to drinking this."
"In the mouth feel it is very prickly with carbonation, a bit powdery from the excess yeast left over, and there is a mild burn in the end."
"Founders Red Rye poured a dark amber color with a small head that went away rather quickly. It had a nice hoppy/malty smell to it. The taste was overall fantastic, it had a very nice combition of malts, and hops, and maybe a pine flavor as well. It had a very strong taste that lasted much after you finished this beer, and it was easy to drink too. Overall another fantastic beer from a fantastic brewer, would love to have this one again."
"Notes: This is good. Very balanced with a good hoppy taste. Glad to have been able to try it."
"D - Overall I enjoyed this about the same as Hot Rod Rye from bear republic but it was defiantly more hoppy which I loved more. Great beer."
"D_Very."
"All in all, this is an ok brew. Nothing more. Just ok. I've tried some of this style before and thought others were better. I had high hopes but was left disappointed. Not worth your time. Good to try once if you have access, but that's all."
"This is a huge beer. Really liked the appearance of the copper color and one finger tan head. Smell was of hops, grapefruit, a bit of pine and other deliciousness. Taste was the same. I loved the hops and rye playing together nicely. Mouthfeel was medium as was the drinkability. This was big and bad in a good way."
"most founders beers are so good that they make you want to drink more, this is no exception. highly recommended."
"D-I have to admit that I dig the rye a good deal,so I might be biased,but I consider this a highly sessionable beer"
"D - One of the most drinkable beers I've ever come across. One of those beers that I just want to drink more and more of. PERFECT to session with basically any time of year. So crispy and delicious. Damn near perfect."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle (bottled on 4/20/10 haha) into a Sam Adams perfect pint. Pours a reddish/copper with high carbonation and a nice sticky light tan head. Lots of citrus in the nose from the Amarillo hops with a good mix of caramel malts. Lots of doughy rye malts ride the palate with a nice spicyness at the end. Very full mouthfeel with a smooth chewy texture. This is a very good overall beer that I will have to get more of next time."
"Poured this into my tulip. Pours a nice ruby color with patches of visible carbonation that look great. A rocky off white head sits atop this beer at about two inches! Huge! Sticky lacing all along. The nose is full of citrus with a the hint of rye. The front-runner on this is a big sweet pink grapefruit smell. Great citrus flavor with a bit of hop bittering for the finish. A little bit spicy though. I immagine that is due to the rye. Overall though this taste great. A really nice mouth feel to this one. Good carbonation and a medium body. Not bad to drink but I think it is a bit spicy so that brings it down for me a bit."
"Who's Red? Probably some filthy Commie... This beer pours a clear ruby-amber topped by nearly two fingers of ecru froth. The nose comprises pine needles, tangelos, creamy caramel, and a touch of peppery rye. The taste kicks up the rye a great deal, though it is still not allowed to take any position of preeminence. Instead, it shares the spotlight in a vigorous tango with hop elements that themselves gracefully combine the talents of pine and ruby red grapefruit. It's quite a dance, particularly set against the backdrop of sweet caramel. The body is a fluffy medium, with a light carbonation and a very creamy feel. This beer begs to be continually consumed and returned to. Thankfully I've got the rest of this growler to help me with that..."
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium full. This is a good beer with rich and flavorful flavor. There is a lot going on in this beer, it is complex but simple. Well done, Founders."
"D: I don't know if I am still into session drinking IPAs but if I were this would be the one I start with. The balance makes it easy to drink."
"Mouthfeel is medium, smooth, mid-level carbonation. Drinkability is high."
"Drinkability is very good. Tastes so great, and makes me ilfing."
"D - A drinkable beer, but just not that outstanding in my opinion. This would be a nice session beer, but I wouldn't particularly seek it out when there are so many other good pale ales and IPAs out there."
"Tops out as one of the best beers I have ever had! Dark chocalate brown with a small head, smells of bourbon, a dash of malt, chocalaty for sure, making me very hoppy! Smooth rich and goes down fast! I'ld write a review about its taste but all the ground has been covered on this one. Outstanding!!! I need not say more!"
"This beer pours a beautiful deep red brown color with almost crystal clarity. great head retention and nice lacing down the glass. Smells like a spicy IPA with some nice caramel malt undertones and spicy piney hops. Great floral aroma as well. Taste is on point with typical founders hops. Nice spicy character, would pair well with bbq ribs and burgers. rustic rye component gives a nice earthy undertone. Nice carbonation and coats the palate well with a great aftertaste that lingers. Drinkability is high on this one as its not only delicious but well made and enjoyable."
"Very smooth. Interesting brew. I think I'll have to pick up another."
"This is my first rye beer and I am very impressed."
"drinks really well. a bit of alcohol can be detected but its overshadowed by the plethora of flavors going on here. not as hop-forward as the 70 IBU designation would imply, but still plenty hoppy. a good brew, and one that will find its way into my glass when Im in the mood."
"Pours a pretty amber brown color with a pillowy tan head that slowly settles leaving a sheet of lacing on the glass. The aroma is quite hoppy, with grapefruit and pine standing out. There is a touch of pepper and candied fruit. The taste is of a solid bready malt with some light caramel notes. This is followed by a grapefruit forward hop profile which also has notes of pepper and candied tropical fruit. There is some nice balance between the malt and hops; everything comes together for a nice spicy profile. Red's Rye is moderate to full bodied with tingly carbonation; finishes with a hoppy bitterness and dry. A hoppy rye brew that is supported by bready malt. Nothing is over the top but there are some big flavors. Very well made."
"Very drinkable...a super example of the style. Tasty and refreshing...definitely one to keep stocked!"
"This my favorite from founders! A deep red-burnt orange that is great looking. Thick head that lasts to the end with smooth soft lacing.Smells of fruits and malt with mild hops. Taste is awesome and not overly hopped with a slightly bitter finish. Extremely well balanced flavor overall. Some grassy tones. Creamy and smooth on the palate. Drinkability is amazing, in fact i gotta go get me another out of the fridge! One of the best from founders!"
" ~ This is a great beer. It is one I will be picking up again in the near future. It has a mildness that most IPAs lack which is why I think the RPA is now going to be the sought after style of my up and coming brews."
"D: Very balanced, drinkable beer for those who like a bitter dry bee"
"Seriously, does Founders have anything on the shelves thats not a solid A!?"
"D- Highly drinkable and enjoyable. Goes well with virtually any situation. The best balance between rye and hops I've ever had in any beer."
"Wish I could have had it on tap, but unfortunately Taco Mac blew the keg and I had to get it in the bottle."
"Pours a deep amber with a thin tan head that doesn't retain particularly well. The aroma has fresh and juicy hop notes upfront, along with rye, caramel, citrus, toasted bread and a little alcohol. The flavor is similar to the aroma with piney and citrusy hop notes initially, along with some caramel, rye bread, brown sugar, and some alcohol. The mouthfeel is smooth and velvety, and drinkability is pretty good. A very tasty and intensely bitter rye beer, but the fresh flavor/aroma of the hops really help this beer stand out from the crowd."
"M/D: Medium to light body, average carbonation. A little tickle on the tongue, but that could be from the rye. Very good drinkability, well balanced and tasty, goes down too fast!"
"Overall- for getting a botched 6 pack of two hearted i ran to the store looking for a hopped up beer and i decided on this. i was gonna go with the centennial which is classic but i tried this for the first time and i can't complain. i highly suggest any hophead to try this."
"I can see why this beer has such a high rating..bought it in a 12oz bottle and poured it into a pint glass. Great head on the beer that retained all the way through creating a great lacing on the glass. Not an overly hoppy beer but you know it is an IPA and a good one at that. Great balance of the flavors creates a high drinkable beer that I would definitely buy again."
"D: Great rye flavor without sacrificing the traditional IPA balance of malt and hop. A well rounded beer that I will purchase quite often."
"Overall, I really like this beer, and my comments are meant to be too negative. It's just that if this beer would just be marketed as an IPA or a regular Pale Ale- I would give this beer a bit of a higher score. It is only because it is called a Rye beer and I'm just not getting any rye is due to a lower score. Like I said, this is a great beer, but doesn't give me what it tells me it should..."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into an English pint glass at slightly warmer than fridge temperature. The beer pours a nice, white head that falls fairly soon to a thin film. Slight lacing. The beer itself is dark amber, showing fine suspended particles and moderate to heavy carbonation. The nose is pungent hops, spice and perhaps apple skin. The flavor is very hops forward, with sour fruit and a tartness that can only come from rye. There's a definite astringency to the finish, and a dryness on the back of the tongue. It presents as a full-bodied beer. Drinking several in a row might be a bit of a challenge, in large part due to the astringency of the finish. Overall, though, a very good beer and different from the norm."
"Awesome beer. First had it on Draft, then saw it in the beer shop...Knew i had to get it...This is the review of the bottle I bought."
"I highly recommend this brew. I have shared Red's Rye with quite a few people (at least 10 people) both men and women and only one had less than great things to say about it. Everyone else said ""Do you have any more?"" That's 90% approval right there. What more can I say..."
"D - Love it, could easily drink a few in a sitting. One of the staples in my fridge, one of the best from Founders. Great beer!"
"overall: well crafted very enjoyable brew I can see why founders gets so much hype the beer was almost perfect"
"Impressions: Tasty, I think this would be a good one to have with some savory snacks."
"A ruby amber color, brilliant hue, catches the light and uses it to illuminate itself from within. Moves like a light syrup, licking the sides of the glass, decent head. Sweet malty scents with hops coming over the top, more subtle on top of the sweet. Smell of freshly mowed lawn, zest of pine, leaves, maple syrup. An almost toasty flavor on the first sip, malt and rye, beautiful together. The rye is crisp and refreshing, lingers on the tongue. The bitter and the sweet rejoice in this beer. This beer is an Indian summer in a bottle. It is a crisp, delightful experience."
"D- I could have easily polished a few more of these off."
"Overall,"
"Overall - This beer is a little too strong, and probably slightly too complex, to be a session beer. That being said it is a wonderfully balanced rendition of an increasing segment of pale ales. I would definitely buy another six pack of this and drink it with dinner."
"Poured a nice dark amber color with a decent amount of carbonation. I smell nice sweet malts with bitter hops following. This one has a very fruity taste to it. I taste apricots (as it also reminds me of DFH's Aprihop). This one has a nice, thick mouthfeel with slight chewiness. Very refreshing. I find this one a little more enjoyable than Centennial IPA, although both are great beers."
"D. More balanced and drinkable than many IPAs. The sweet and spicy malt character really shines through to make this a pleasant drink."
"A 'dark' IPA, pours with an instantly sticky head. Very unique color, sort of a tarnished ruby. Taste is round and dense. Elegant, mega-hoppy front with a finish that unfortunately hits a dry brick wall. Well worth a try."
"This beer is a must try and can definitely hang with all of your favorite American IPAs. I definitely don't drink this beer as much as I should. This beer is special!"
"D - An excellent RPA. Could easily drink a few of these in one sitting. One of my favourite beers."
"Overall I would say this is one of my favorite beers."
"D: This beer is very drinkable and is also quite sessionable."
"Would make a wonderful session brew, wish I had more than 2. Danka Huff!"
"D- Easy drinkability and nice for a sunny day. Also, this is a nice switch up for someone seeking a bitter beer but wanting to step outside the traditional I.P.A."
"D - I am a big fan of RPAs, and this beer is no exception. It is hoppy, spicy, flavorful and satisfying. The abv is low enough to have a few of these in a session, and the alcohol is completely hidden in the taste. If only Founders was available in CA, this bad boy would be making frequent appearances in my fridge!"
"Pours a brilliant red-amber-mahogany. A 1.5 inch, creamy, creamy, tan head forms. Totally inviting! The initial nose suggests spice and a heavy dose of flavoring hops. The body is medium and the palate is immediately hit by a wallop of bittering hops that cleanses and lingers very nicely. Thick, distinct lace forms. Nice malt notes, however, the rye is evident and produces a very clean, delicious spiciness. The carbonation is delicate. Should try this ale with my next Reuben or Pastrami on rye. This ale is definitely moreish!"
"The beer poured a dark amber with a tan head. The aroma was of floral hops and rye malt. The taste had hops and rye up front with a malty cherry hint in finish. The feel was light and dry. A very well put together rye beer. Such strong tastes that I'm not sure I would drink more than 1 or 2 at a sitting."
"Serving type: single bottle, wish I had got a couple more"
"D - I LOVE this rye - the hoppiness fits the style well and compliments the hop profile is great with just enough spice to keep you coming back - drinks very smoothly for such a bitter ale - wonderful - Kudos Founders!"
"High scores but this is one of the better rye beers I've had so far and the hoppy flavors are outstanding. Founders continues to amaze me with their solid brews."
"Creamy, awesome mouthfeel, with a thick, tenacious head. Pleasing amber color, although I personally prefer a much darker-looking beer. Smooth, subtle, hoppy taste, colored primarily with hints of nut and citrus. Overall, I really enjoyed this beer, but it doesn't quite have me jumping out of my chair. Definitely worth trying."
"D- Great drinkability but it takes time to drink, the flavor was a different style and combination that I have ever had before but the flavors complimented each other well. It is always nice to have a nice hoppy beer with something a little different to it, will have to try out some other Rye beers in the future."
"Drinkability: The hoppiness in this beer is perfectly balanced with the spiciness of the rye. Palate fatigue is not an issue and I can keep on craving this all night, excellently put together beer."
"D-It's very drinkable...I made the mistake of bottle drinking a couple of these and for some reason that amplified the rye/nutty characteristics and made it un pleasant. Out of the glass it was stellar."
"Drinkability is above average. The taste is interesting and may take some time for the novice. It's hoppy and bitter. It's going quite well with my corned beef sandwich."
"drinkability: Goes down fast and easy. Very nice brew."
"0verall: Easy to drink, very sessionable beer. For the money, I'd stick with the Founders Centennial."
"drinkability: solid taste but a little heavy for style. great flavor though"
"D - Very drinkable if you are into IPAs and you can definitely feel all 70 IBUs."
"Drinkability is exceptional. I could drink this by the keg (in fact, this is the next 1/6bbl I'll be seeking for the kegerator). Amazing beer from Founders and perhaps the best rye IPA out there."
"I'd be happy to have local access to this rye pale ale. It keeps the taste buds kicking, I like it."
"This beer is also very drinkable for 6.5+ and could easily be a session beer. This may not be for everyone, but in my opinion this is a unique and delicious creation from Founders(which is rapidly becoming a favorite brewery of mine)."
"D- This beer is delicious. Drink it. Love it. Repeat. It is truly a hop-bomb but a hop-bomb to love. More drinkable than expected."
"D - fantastic representation of the style. not modest, shy or graceful, just straight to the point and gets the job done. this would be great paired with a whole slew of foods. a king among rye's!"
"Picked one up at the brewery, pours a very dark red with a decent amount of foam. Smells very fruity in a good way, but the taste doesn't quite match it. Still tastes good with a bitter hop kind of finish to it. A very sessionable beer overall. Glad I finally got to try this one."
"D: I haven't experienced too many rye beers, but I enjoyed drinking this and will definitely have it again. Another solid offering from Founders."
"M & D: Really smooth and easy to drink. This would make a great session/summer beer."
"Overall this beer was a pleasure to drink. The rye added an interesting note that I haven't tasted too often. Overall a great beer for the spring."
"D: Not a bad rye, but not the best example of the style either. It held a lot of promise, but the taste just doesn't hold up to the smell. I won't have a problem drinking the other one received in trade, but likely won't seek this one out again either."
"pours a brilliant hazed copper with a perfect, fluffy, one finger tan head and impressive lace. prettiest beer i've seen in awhile. the smell is strong and magical. hops and glory. pine hops coat the tongue. mango, lemon, citrus, and orange rind. ends with a wheaty, grainy rye flavor mixed beautifully with tropical fruits. go founders!"
"D: Could drink this all night long. Wow. Simply amazing."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer that I will definitely be purchasing again."
"Drinkability - Very much so. I am really liking how the flavors are mixing together. A very refreshing and tasty brew. I would defiantly have this in my weekend mix during the summer if I had my hands on it, to give me a break from all the D/IPA's I'd be drinking. Would buy again."
"Another great rye beer, and an excellent beer from Founders! If I didn't have to drive all the way to MA to get this stuff, it would be in my fridge constantly."
"These are very easy to put down, a bit more-so than when bottled."
"Summary: more than your standard pale ale, very bitter hops but not aggressively so, smooth finish, drinkable"
"Poured into a standard pint glass. The beer is a red/orange color with a thin, off white head. Not a great deal of aroma. What's there is faintly hoppy, but a little different. Ah, that's what it is, the rye is evident at first sip. Taste starts out creamy with a good malt profile. Finish is dry and bitter. Rye makes it's presence known throughout. Very tasty! Feel is creamy, with appropriate carbonation. Very drinkable IPA. Another solid offering from Founders! I enjoyed this beer and would have it again!"
"Pours dark red with small off-white head. Dusty sediment visible. Not getting much rye in the smell, getting mostly caramel, sweetness and hops. Hmm, interesting taste. I am definitely getting a subtle rye taste which I like alot. A lot less hops than I expected, maybe I have an old bottle? Tastes of pine and wood work great here as well. Still getting a bit of caramel sweetness too which balances out the more dense previously mentioned tastes. No alcohol taste present here and the tastes aren't overpowering, I would not session it though mostly because of it's slight heaviness. Another excellent and complex offering from Founders."
"OVERALL: At 70 IBUs the Founders Red's Rye is right up my alley. As much as I love to jump all over the place with my beer selections during a night out, if I find Founders Red Rye I stick with it for the evening. It also makes a fantastic six pack to bring home and unwind with."
"Pours a rich reddish mahogany brown with subdued carbonation, a smallish parchment head and moderate lacing. Aroma is quite nice with plenty of grapefruit, some caramel sweetness and a rye seed twinge in the background. Flavor is quite nice. Extremely well balanced, complex yet nuanced. Plenty of grapefruit from the hops, solid caramel and bready malt backbone and a rye toast presence that compliments, rather than dominates as in some other rye beers. This beer has a firm bitterness that once again, seems to meld with the other flavor aspects. Very tasty. Medium bodied with a wonderful surprisingly smooth mouthfeel and great semi-dry finish. Oh, and this finish is miles long. I take a break to type and the rye lingers on my tounge. I am not the world's biggest rye fanboy, but this one is well executed and extremely drinkable. Strongly recommended by a friend from Founder's home of Grand Rapids, back in my native mitten. I have to agree that this is a top notch offering from one of the Midwest's premier brewers."
"Overall Impression: Another winner from Founders! It has a good malt backbone and a little hoppiness , with the unique twist of rye. It's a Jewish deli explosion in my mouth! Oye Vey!"
"O: My favorite hop bomb, pick this one up if you like em'."
"Overall I'm very impressed with this one. Although they're sometimes excellent, many other well known American brews that use rye are essentially American IPA's with rye thrown in to up the complexity. While not quite as hop forward as something like Hop Rod Rye, the way the rye is so skillfully showcased really makes this a special beverage. This would definitely be a regular in the fridge if I could find it locally."
"Hard to find any major fault with this beer. Very drinkable for such a bitter, flavorful brew."
"All in all a good brew, but doesn't stand out."
"The Red's Rye PA pours an amber almost copper color with a thin 1 finger head and some lacing on the glass. Aromas are sweet malts and caramel. A solid hop backbone that rounds out the nose. The grains are much more prominent in the quaff along with a nice candy sweet finish. Also some citrus orange peels and lemons. Not much hoppiness is noted in the mouth. Mouthfeel is medium weight but smooth. Drinkability is on queue with this one. A very sessionable brew."
"Overall this wasn't quite as good as I remembered, perhaps because the bottles I had were gushers and by the time the head settled in my glass it was absurdly smooth. Still, this remains one of my favorite beers and is well worth a shot."
"Overall, this is a very nice beer and my favorite rye beer to date, although it's very hard to pick out a whole lot of the rye because of the dominating hops. I look forward to getting my hands on a fresher bottle because this is a very tasty and very drinkable beer that would be great for lounging around in the late summer or fall. I'm not going to complain about drinking it under all this snow right now, though, because this is a very good brew from a brewery that never disappoints."
"A stunning beer. Beautiful pour, rich red-amber color. Smell of honey/vanilla/pine. The flavor is exceptionally good: rich, rewarding, balanced - a real knockout. The peppery punch of the rye is offset wonderfully by the IPA hop kick. Flavors of honey and dry, clean hops are dominant, but not overbearing. This brew is your master, but it is kind and benevolent. Washes down like silk and the aftertaste really blooms the flavors nicely. Hops are very pronounced, but not straight pine or citrus, something else that is much better. Founders wins again."
"Poured it into a standard pint glass. A good amount of thick head. I Let the beer sit while I ironed a shirt, when I came back to it, there was still some head left with a good amount of thick lacing. The smell is strong of rye but at the same time crisp and almost citrusy. The taste is exactly what I expected. It's an IPA with a good malt backbone, but with a powerful rye taste to it. Didn't know if these two flavors would blend well, but the taste is exceptional. I get a bit of caramel in the taste too, a lot of complexity. The mouthfeel it thick with a bit of sediment that you can sense. Substantial but smooth. I could only see me drinking a couple of these because they are thick and filling."
"I must be missing something on this beer. It was my first rye beer so maybe that could explain it. I need to give this beer another try at some point. It looked very good, but the taste didn't do much for me. I found it to be much more bitter than I was expecting. I didn't find the smell of this beer to be to appetizing either. I'm way off all the other ratings, so I will need to try this again."
"Not as dry as I would like. It sticks around a little in the mouth."
"D= 4.0 Great beer from founders. They make some amazing world class brews. I don't know if I'd call this one world class but it's an amazing beer and world class in it's own style. Great job founders."
"Overall, another delicious offering from Founder's. Love that bit of rye flavor and good hoppy bite."
"This is a good beer. I don't love it, but I had a craving for rye and it hit the spot."
"d: a very good beer; absolutely worth a try; very sweet and very falvorful"
"D: Another very nice beer from Founders. I've said it before, but rye works wonderfully in this style of beer, matched with some caramel maltiness and a big kiss of American hops. It's no Hop Rod Rye, but it's a most acceptable runner-up."
"wonderful beer, wish I'd taken my friend's recommendation sooner. won't even doubt him again."
"Pours out a very dark red, almost brown with a two finger head that is very foamy/creamy with amazing retention. The head doesn't wanna go away and leaves off-white, thick lacing behind. The lacing itself comes off the glass about a millimeter or two! By my standards this is pretty much as good as it gets for apperance. Smell is of great, fresh hops and some pale malts with a hint of caramel. The malts remind me of homebrewing. The hops come through with earthy, fruity and herbal notes. The strength of the nose is good and the hop aroma stays throughout the whole experience. The hop aroma of this bad boy could rival almost any IPA I have had. Taste is like the nose but does not fade. The hops are great in flavor and bitterness. Piney and earthy hops dominate and the fruity ones take a back seat. The malts are very pleasant and the rye likewise. Malts are have some caramel hints and balance the hops very nicely. The rye creates a flavor I am not used to but I enjoy, I am not very familiar with rye beer. Overall the flavor is great and well balanced. Mouthfeel is nice for this beer. The body is moderate. The carbonation is right where I want it and medium in strength. The only thing I would want is a bit more creaminess. There is a huge warmth which I did not expect but it adds to the experience since I cannot taste the alcohol creating this feeling. Drinkability... I have been searching for a sessionable Founders beer that is great. This is it. The price is on the higher end for a session beer but it is worth it. After a six pack of these I would be in a perfect place. This is now my go to beer due to the great hop aroma and balanced flavor. What a nice surprise."
"Smells of orange peel and tangerines. Tastes of caramel and hops up front and finishes with a big citrus punch. Pours a light amber with decent head. An excellent Pale Ale.. very reminiscent of Dale's Pale Ale with more caramel tones. I do not pick up on the Rye much."
"M/D: Full body, with an excellently long finish. It's brilliantly spicy and sweet, with the hop bitterness rounding it out extremely well. I wish New York had Founders."
"Overall, a pretty damn good beer. I didn't think it was that great the first time I tried this, but I'm glad I gave it another shot. I love the sweet, citric juice flavor that dominates this one. Also a great spiciness from the dry hopping and the rye adds a unique characteristic that I like. Definitely worth checkin' out."
"D - I really wish I could get this more often, as it would surely jump to the top of my regular brews."
"-unlike most of the rye stuff i have had before, but good. would definitely enjoy another"
"This beer was wonderful. One of the best pale ales on the market IMO. There is grapefruit zest in the aroma and the flavor imparts grapefruit juice. Can't say I taste rye as an ingredient but there was a mineral after taste in the drying finish I could not put my finger on that may have been to rye. Slightly thick/chewy mouthfeel. This beats out Sierra Nevada pale ale any day of the week."
"I initially had this at a bar a while back and thought it was great. I like it even more now."
"12 ounce bottle gifted from piscator34. Pours a light brown/ruby with moderate clarity. Big fluffy offwhite head and sticky soapy lacing. Nose- soapy hops, caramel. Taste- spicy, peppery rye mingles with piney hops and a solid bready caramel backbone. Medium body with a perfect level of prickly carbonation. I could session the shit of this beer. Finishes with a perfume like hop bitterness and some lingering sweetness. A rock solid brew."
"Somewhat thin, but not overly fizzy. A bit strong to session, perhaps. Think I won't let that stop me this time."
"Pours a clear, dark coppery amber, almost mahogany, with a fine-bubbled beige head. Aroma is strongly hoppy with a firm evergreen overtone. Flavor is richly hoppy and evergreen, just slightly bitter and subtly different from a traditional IPA. Texture is ragged, edgy and quite tingly."
"Good beer. I have to say I was expecting more, being a big fan of rye & Founders, & hoping for a blow-outta-the-water kind of rye. And looking at the bottling date, I wonder if MN got a few old shipments. I'll give this another shot with a bottle that's fresher with, I hope, even better results."
"F: Finishes dry and bitter, both accent each other. The rye flavor also lingers for a bit and seems to lead to this fruit punch like flavor as it fades. It has a spicy almost quality as well, like spicy spicy. Bitterness lingers but it's nice. This is actually a really enjoyable beer for a rye whisky fan, and it has a lot of great qualities."
"The mouthfeel is viscous with a long lingering bitterness. This is a very good beer - I wish I had purchased more than a single bottle."
"I poured this in my Duvel glass and the head started off good and retained some small patchy lacing on the glass. The nose was very spicy like fresh cracked pepper with a candied sugar tone on the fade. The taste starts with a bold hop presence that quickly goes to a yeasty dark toasted bread flavor. The second wave of flavor seems to be a dark cherry fruit mixed with a touch of black liquorish. The finish is dry and spicy making your taste buds yearn for more. This would go great with Hot Wings. Cheers...."
"Finished my last of my first 6-pack last night and bumped the score up a bit. This is really a fantastic Rye Pale Ale, the best I've had outside of Terrapin Rye-Squared. Hop heads would love this one, very hoppy and man that rye malt works really well here to balance things out."
"The rye malt profile is great, it complements the hops nicely and has a complexity throughout the drink that changes from a soft bread flavor to a much sharper kind of spicy grain edge. The hops of the other hand are just really well balanced and perfectly involved in kicking this up. The hops are somewhat grassy but really kind of fruity and bitter at the end with an awesome finish. The mouth feel also kicks ass on this, very smooth and full."
"Pours mostly amber with a little red,nice little redish copper head that dissipates quickly,no mistake this beer is a rye from the smell and taste malt and rye and nice hop balance,it reminds me of the caraway seed in a loaf of rye bread,not overpowering but wanting another slice,this is an easy drinker and a solid rye"
"a solid brew. I wish it weren't so expensive (around $13/four-pack here)"
"D - a fine tasty beer. Maybe could use a bit more hop flavor. Nice though."
"another solid beer from the folks at founders..."
"I've heard this described as a pale ale with rye, but what I had on tap was certainly more of a rye IPA. Regardless, the rye characteristics balanced the heavy hops well and added only positive things to the drinking experience. Simply put: its really good. A beer that deserves regular fridge time."
"This is a bit strong at 6.60% ABV but I could easily see myself having a few of these in a session. It's not terribly complex but this is a good example of a beer not needing to be full of hops or having a ton of flavors in order to be great. Simpler can be better and this is a great example of how enjoyable a well-crafted beer can be. A must for any hophead looking for a more sublime drinking experience."
"Poured a cloudy amber brown, with three fingers of off-white head, with fantastic lacing. The smell was dominated by pink grapefruit and orange peel; very pungent. The taste was much more complex...starting with malty, toffee, caramel, earthiness which dissolved to a nice citrus fruit/malt balance, and then finishing with soft citrus. Creamy, medium-bodied mouthfeel. Very little evidence present of caraway/rye, but nonetheless a very sessionable and tasty brew."
"This beer does a great job of showcasing both hop flavor and bitterness. Floral, grassy and grapefruit hoppiness play nicely with the zesty, pepper and bread-loaf rye flavors. There is a touch of sweetness in there to help smooth things out a bit. The mouthfeel and body on the beer are just about right for the style and I'll be damned if Red's Rye is not far from chuggable. Drinkability is through the roof. I dont think I could ever get sick of drinking this brew and am very sad this is the last of a six pack I got for Christmas...thanks Dad! Unbelievable beer, great job (as usual) Founders."
"This is by far one of the best somewhat easily available rye beers out in the market and I thoroughly enjoy it."
" Lets start with the head.... I poured this baby somewhat lightly and there was about a 1/4"" of mountainous head domed above the rim. Big bubbles, small bubbles.... bubbles o plenty. An off white head rests proudly atop a beautiful hazy red ale. The laser etched bottom sends lanes of carbonation racing to meet up with the rest of the trapped bubbles at the bottom of what seems to be a never dying pile of head. The lacing shows evidence of the beer levels before i took my last few quaffs. The sweet grain and rye spiciness combine with the citrus minty hops witch are coating my tongue as I type. The thought of another sip is satisfying only reminding me the end of this glass is nearing. Aroma, taste and aftertaste compliment each other well giving this ale a three ring show."
"D - Drinkability is good. It gives you a very warm feeling right at the end of every sip. I was able to consume one faster than the usual ale. This goes great with bread and gouda cheeese. I look forward to drinking more of these."
"Poured into a pint glass, left a finger and a half of off-white head, loose bubbly lacing going down. Smell is rye, hoppy, raw grain. Taste is superb. Lots of rye and hop, some citrus action going on. Mouthfeel is thin to medium. Mild carbonation. I like this, I could drink a few of these."
"As I drink that last few sips, when it had really warmed up this is really really tasty. This is an excellent beer."
"i have been enjoying this beer for a few years now and it never gets old - hands down this and 2bros cane & ebel are the best rye beers out there - go seek them out"
"D: Founders can do no wrong in my eyes and this beer is just another reason why. A really good RyePA."
"Red's Rye is pretty drinkable. Overall it is a pretty good beer."
"Not bad, there just wasn't much about this beer that stood out. Good, but this wasn't one of the better rye beers I've had, nor one of the better P.A.s."
"D: The flavor and balance make for a wildly drinkable rye beer. This one should not disappoint."
"a great ale, founders brewers know what there doing and this is a fantastic example of the brews that thay are capable of. highly drinkable ,enjoy ,,cheers."
"Pours a crystal clear copper color with a think lacy off white head. The nose is full of sweet citrus hop aroma. The taste is semi-tart citrus hop bitterness with subtle vinous characteristics and a well balanced malt backbone. The body is mildly heavy with moderate carbonation levels and is very drinkable. The finish fades gently with tart hop bitterness and sweet vinous qualities. Ends with a gentle warming sensation."
"A great beer. More of an IPA with a little rye, but still a really good rye beer. Something I would recommend."
"drinkability good but not a session ale for me, you dont need more than a couple."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was gasoline colored and did have a pretty nice head. The color of the head was a light tan. The beer had a truly hoppy smell to it. And The beer had a truly hoppy taste to it also. It reminded me of eating a cypress tree. I will not buy again"
"Prickly on the tongue, but not spritzy, it's from the spicey pepper character. Nice and interesting brew."
"Overall: Nice ""Rye P. A."" Not my favorite beer, but probably my favorite rye. Admittedly, I usually don't like rye beers too much, but this one isn't dominated by the rye and strikes a nice balance with the hops. If you see it and like rye or hops, or even aren't totally turned off by hops, give it a shot"
"Overall, a nice beer, but not something i'm going to drink often."
"D- Pretty good, I would have had a couple more if I was eating dinner instead of lunch. Went great with a burger and fries."
"D- Very good drinkable beer, the alcohol really presents itself nicely, moderate and fresh, balanced. I like the rye, it is strong with hops, really good beer."
"On another note, I would categorize this is an IPA rather than a rye beer. I assume the name of the beer is a play on words. It's like a little brother of HOTD Blue Dot, which is definitely considered a DIPA."
"I couldn't put my finger on the fruit component, until I had a second bottle days later and was smacked in the face with the grapefruit. I am hoarding two bottles that are left. Reminds me of a mix of Hop Rod Rye and Hop Stoopid, and anything that tastes like the lovechild of those two beers HAS to be good. Thank you, Founders."
"Just a really great beer the flavors all complement each other nicely. While not a all nighter could easily be an every nighter for me."
"I think Founders sometimes tries too hard with their gigantic, ambitious offerings, but this one is spot on. This is a fantastic beer that is reasonably priced to boot!"
"Hazy copper color with a rich off white head. Lots of rye right off the bat. Floral hops and then some citrus. The rye was also the first taste on the palette. Lots of hops, again more floral than pine, and the citrus is just a hint. To me, this is definitely better than Hop Rod Rye. Then again, Hop Rod is considered an IPA and has less rye. This is superb, I could see this as a regular if it were more readily available. Oddly enough, I've rated a couple other offerings from Founders higher, but if I had to pick one of their beers to sit and drink all night this would be the one."
"D- Could have more than one or two of these."
"D- Really a nice rye beer; try it if you can."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a Beautiful crimson red with a creamy tan head. Nicely balanced with its hop bitterness and floral bouquet achieved from the dry hop. In the finish, the generous amount of malted rye used gives it a spicy crisp finish. This is better a little warmer, flavor bursts when around 46 deg. It's not a cloying rye, and the body is lighter than I though it would be...and not in a bad way. Drinkable, maybe not quite a session beer but I think I'll have another."
"The appearance is of a light amber to almost sunset orange.Very nice carbonation. A pale ale that has a clean roasted malt bouquet with candied citrus aromas.This beer definitely has the rye and raosted barley flavors. Not a typical pale ale but a wonderful different example of a great Founders brew. The mouthfeel is quite full and long lasting. I found this beer is a nice complement with food , like anything grilled. Overall it is a fun beer to drink and to enjoy over a relaxing evening."
"Drinkability: I liked this in bottle but like it even more on draft. This is definitely a drinkable beer and I could easily have ordered 2 or 3 more. This one stays on my shopping list and I'll be having more next time I find it on draft."
"Overall -- very pleased with this beer, didnt blow me away, but i dont think it was supposed to. just a really good take on some classic flavors. not too challenging, and exciting to try."
"Yet another great offering from Founders. Very complex and bold flavor. Truly a treat for the palate and sure to alleviate any hop craving."
"D: While fairly hoppy and a little strong this beer is quite drinkable; actually kind of nice summer session beer."
"D- Very drinkable, it is simply a smooth, good tasting beer. It's not going to pound your palete nor will it knock your socks off with amazing flavors. What it will do is deliver a solid all around beer that won't let you don't in any category."
"Feel and Drinkability: Creamy mouthfeel, carbonation is in check and it just goes down smooth. This one is easy to drink and I can see myself going after another sixer of this easily and in the near future. Body is medium-light helped by carbonation which gives it a lighter feel than what it actually has. Finishes clean and semi-dry. Bitterness lingers. Rye character lingers at the end too, hard to say what its like, but I know that it is different than any kind of flavor you get from barley. Very nice all in all."
"Pours a deep, dark, hazy ruby red with a nice tan head. Smells like a sweet IPA: caramel covered apples and a candy tartness. Taste is well-balanced between a green apple bitterness, candy tanginess, and caramel sweetness. There's also a woody element that I find enjoyable. This is a very big and bold beer and I dig it, big time."
"This was my first rye beer. To me, it had some of the best elements of amber ales and low-bitterness IPAs, neither of which are favorite styles of mine. That said, I would definitely drink this again. Next time I want something hoppy and/or red, I'll think of this."
"Dark amber color with thick and frothy beige head. Some visible prickle bubbles some of which are moving. The nose is a little heavy, sweet and floral. At first I thought of describing it as muted, but that isn't correct. It comes through clearly, but is heavy and ""hangs low"" if that makes any sense. Good balance. Nice malt presence and pleasantly hoppy. The hops must be chinook as its very similar to the ""Rye PA"" I had at Great Waters in Saint Paul and the chinook hops was the ""unique"" quality I am almost certain of it. The mouthfeel is a little thicker than many ales. The sweet presence of the chinook (if I am indeed correct) works well to enhance the malt flavor. Deinitely a hoppy beer, but not just for hoppy beer drinkers."
"Medium orange-amber with a small, slightly off-white head the diminishes rather quickly to a thin film. Beautiful pine and citrus hops aroma. A lightly caramel a dn grainy backbone barely making its presence known. Tastewise, wow this is good. Huge hops right off the bat like the nose. Lots of citrus and some pine. A little spicy as the caramel starts to show. A mouth-watering finish that turns floral as it slowly fades. It has a medium body, dry texture, moderate carbonation, and a light hoppy-spicy sting to it. This a very enjoyable beer. Big hops presence without being a big beer. Every sip leaves me wanting more. Definitely worth trying!"
"Morey's Bottom Line: This beer is right up there with Nosferatu as far as my favorite red ales are concerned. One of the best."
"Not my favorite Founders, but definitely makes me want to try other ryes."
"Drinkability is pretty good. The bitterness is not overpowering and quite enjoyable. I could see this as a possible session beer and I plan to get some more."
"Notes: I'm not a huge fan of highly hopped beers, but they have been growing on me. This is exactly what I wanted. A very hoppy beer with good bready balance and awesome feel."
"Overall, this tastes like a distinct brew from the 'regular' Red's Rye, but it is definitely nice in it's own way. I think I prefer the other one a little better."
"Nice beer. I think this one is dominated by the pine... which I love!"
"Every sip invites another. If Founders was sold in NYS, this would definitely be one of the staples in my fridge."
" Get Some!!!"
"D- I doubt I would have a problem drinking these one after the other but I have found myself enjoying each one on its own, as its own experience from first sip to the last grainy little sip at the bottom"
" I will be buying a case of this next time I head out to the store! Everyone should try this. Rye may be where it's at. I'll have to try more rye style beers now!"
"I have a feeling that once I got two of these in me, I'd be able to drink them all night long. Very tasty and easy drinking."
"Overall impression: Hugely drinkable - dangerously so given the ABV. Lots of interesting flavors here - great for hop heads."
"The nose is definitely spicey hops. Definitely hoppier than malty, though, what malt flavor you get is rye."
"There is a definite floral component to the beer too, one which balances the strong flavors of grapefruit and caramel. The red rye color and finish are really noteworthy, as the creamy head lasted until I finished the beer and washed away the graininess in the finish. The hop structure was clean and the carbonation soft (not too dry). Likely used a very acidic, soft water to break down the rye as well as they did."
"The punchy bitterness is a surprise at first, but it melds nicely with the spicy rye, light caramel sweetness and herbal hop flavor. This has the bitterness of an IPA, but the flavor comes more from the earthy, spicy, slightly sour rye malt than it does from the hops. I get a bit of tropical fruit mid-palate, mango and pineapple. The finish is dry, bitter and lingering, almost excessively so, but it's not an astringent bitterness. Enjoyable stuff."
"Pours a beautiful deep amber with red highlights capped by a couple of fingers of cream colored head. Tiny bubbles of carbonation dance up to the surface. The aroma is a blend of citrus, grains, and caramel. In the flavor is where these are presented more interestingly, with hops and malts striking a fine balance, featuring said citrus and caramel. The rye is allowed to shine here with nutty, spicy, and earthy twang. Some hints of honey, especially in the coating mouthfeel. Body remains in the middle, and I feel like I could drink a bunch of this. On the other hand, one is oh so enjoyable. The best rye beer I've had to date--thanks again, Founders!"
"D: Very drinkable. Is a great session beer for me. Look forward to drinking again."
"D- As I said earlier, this beer drinks like it has 3-4% alcohol. It is hidden very well. Could drink these all night long. Too bad I don't have regular access to it."
"Drinkability: You must try this beer. It's unlike anything else you've ever had. Hops, fruit, rye...what's not to like. I paired this with a hearty bowl of bean soup on a chilly autumn evening and was really enjoying myself."
"The beer started out with a nice redish look. The taste gives way to a piney citrus taste with a great hoppy aftertaste. It is nearly IPA like with its flavor. The rye taste helps mellow out the hops giving this beer excellent drinkability. An exceptional beer with terrific flavor."
"I would gladly have 2-3 of these in a row without getting tired of them. Very nicely balanced and finished."
"D. Founders is a great brewery. Red's Rye is an exceptional session beer. Plenty of hops for my liking balanced with a strong malt profile of caramel and rye. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. I say highly recommended!"
"Makes me want to make a honey-baked ham sandwich one rye w/some hops instead of lettuce. mmmm."
"Went pretty damn well with the fried brie and apples at Fuel and Fuddle."
"D. Very drinkable. Great beer to drink a six pack of. Nice balance and flavor."
"Poured into pint glass and after pouring a thrid of the bottle the head overtook the glass. Massive thick, rocky head with lots of lacing. Hazy and rusty, off-white head. Smell was a bit strong of a sweet caramel with some hops, almost barleywine-ish. Taste was comlex. Some caramel, little hops, malt, some toasted grain and other earthy flavors. Fuller mouthfeel, smooth and somewhat velvety. Overall a good beer but somethinga about it just didnt hit home for me."
"Drinkability: This thing smells, tastes, and feels like an imperial something, but at just 6.8%, it makes a nice daily drinker. We drank a bunch of these on the beach a few weeks ago. Very refreshing, so delicious."
"*Served warm, the heavy, licorice taste can overwhelm."
"Drink is simply good a drinkable beer but a little much for me to have more than a few."
"D=very drinkable, and enjoyable."
"D - As with the Centennial IPA if this was offered localy I could easily see myself choosing this one as I would to have more of this."
"Not my favorite, but yet a very good beer from the people at Founders."
"Pours a copper color with a small head and decent retention. The aroma is very hoppy, smells of rye, grapefruit, and pine. Taste is also hoppy, but there is a sweet malt backbone which gives this beer nice balance. The rye flavor comes through nicely. Has a medium body and proper carbonation. This is a nice drinkable beer. Very nicely made."
"as others have also said.. tasted very similar to a IPA due to strong hops"
"Definitely an enjoyable offering from Founders, its hits all the right notes. Cheers Red!"
"D Fair as this is a huge tasting beer with a moderate ABV. 3.5"
"This is a very drinkable beer. It's full-flavored, and its sour & spicy flavors go really well with peppery food."
"Dark red with haze. Nice complete, yellowish head, small bubbles, cover the beer in a thick layer. Alcohol and strong aroma of hops. Almost pine like aroma. Familar, think Rogue Yellow Snow. Interesting flavor, the rye no doubt. How much rye was this made with? Very dominant rye flavor. Almost no aftertaste. Very smooth, a nice drink. Slow to drink, probably due to the lateness and my current ""state."""
"Drinkability: Excellent. This is a beer that I could drink consistently and often. Well worth a try."
"A full-bodied beer that is very drinkable. My first Founders, and it did not disappoint."
"M & D - Creamy and thick bodied. Leaves a bit of a hoppy ending lingering on the tongue. 6.8% ABV is well masked. This is an excellent brew...Founders has yet to disappoint me. Anyone who loves IPA's will love this brew (even though it's a Rye). One I will recommend to my friends!"
"D - very high but i cannont imagine having more than 24 oz. in a single session. outstanding flavor, but it could be an overload to the senses after 2. that being said i wish i had more to keep on-hand for when the mood strikes for another. damn you Founders, bring your nectar to the Mile High City!"
"Drinks ok, this is such a different taste with my first experience with rye beer. It has smooth parts though."
"The mouthfeel and drinkability is such that you could sip and enjoy it or pound it on a hot summer day"
"Picked up a single to try this, as Founders makes some excellent beers. Not as much rye flavor as I was expecting, this reminded me more of a IPA that was shifted to the bitter side. Hopefully someday I can try their Black Rye."
"Overall, this is a pretty solid beer. I think I would definitely like to have this around for a hoppy session beer. Just a great drinking beer, at a great price, with a nice touch of rye that I really like."
"The mouth is decent with a good amount of carbonation and crispness. This is a very good beer. Big malty sweetness starts the beer off, but this gives way to a nice mellow bitterness. Lots of caramel, bitter rye, and finishes toasty and bready. I dig this. I guess there's a a Red's Rye and a Red's Rye P.A., I wonder how different they are. Recommend."
"D-Very drinkable. That simple. I'm glad that Founders is now available in the Twin Cities, as this brew is delicious. I look forward to further encounters with this brewery."
"This is one tasty brew, and with a relatively low abv, it can be enjoyed in multiples. This is not a style I am terribly familiar with, but the RyePA was excellent in all aspects."
"Amazing."
"Founders' Red's Rye PA poured a great red color with a one and a half finger white head of tiny bubbles. The smell was a great combination of rye and hops. The rye aroma was very inviting, and even more intriguing coming from this red brew. The floral and citrus hops gave the nose a distinctive IPA bouquet. The taste was an incredible combination of base and adjunct malts up front with a robust hop finish. The malts approach with a rich sweetness and the distinct taste of rye. As the malt mellows the hops take over with floral notes on the tongue and a touch of spiciness toward the back of the throat. The aftertaste is hoppy but nice. This beer finishes clean and does not leave the mouth sticky making it very drinkable, but beware of the 6.6% ABV. This drinkable beer can add up fast! Red's Rye PA is a fantastic new take on the classic IPA; rye beers are so few as it is, so coupling the unique taste of rye with the punch of an IPA makes for a unique, enjoyable, beer experience. Cheers!"
"It is one of the most drinkable beers I have had in some time. A six-pack would not last too long in my house."
"Overall, this beer freaking rocks and I may need to make sure I have some in my fridge at all times."
"D: This is a very good beer, no problem reaching for a 2nd or 3rd. I would like more rye in the flavor, but it adds a depth to the mouthfeel that makes this different from a APA/IPA. I really like this beer, will definitely purchase again. Worth trying."
"One of my favorites. A nice treat. A solid beer from a solid brewer."
"Well balanced rye IPA not the best I've ever had but close."
"A: A thick rocky head from a medium pour, lots of foam which clings to the sides of the glass, a very clear amber to ruby color - 4.50, S: Citrusy and piney, a strong but not overwhelming sweetness the smells like overripe plums, definite spiciness on the nose, one of the most inviting and smooth aroma profiles I've experienced in some time - 4.75, T: Wonderful hop bite which is balanced nicely with a solid malt profile, a little zing - possibly from the rye, some caramel flavors and slightly toasty, grapefruit on the palate as well, quite dry - 4.75, M: Extremely smooth mouth feel which translates to a beer which seems to linger on the tongue - 5.00, D: This is one heck of a drinkable beer, edges into the territory of IPA while being an exceptional example of an amber (albeit a hoppy one), I will seek this beer out again - 5.00"
"D- Very drinkable beer, almost too drinkable. I could drink far too many of these in one session."
"D: Too many flavors here to drink a lot of it, I need a break after one."
"All together an excellent brew, very nice any time but especially for a cool fall day."
"Small cream colored head on top of a hazy amber body. A bit of a lace trail. Loads of malt on the nose. Some bitter hops. Rye malt on the taste, a bit of a bitter hop background. Bit of a metallic hint. Thin and watery mouth. Kind of an interesting beer, pretty good overall."
"A perfectly balanced and drinkable beer. This is an IPA made with rye. A great mix of the bitter hops flavors and the sweeter caramel/rye flavors makes this probably one of the best beers I've had from Founders, at least of the sessionable non-overpowering variety. Medium bodied and exceptionally drinkable. Not overly intense or complex flavors, but delicious."
"Cloudy red with a huge head that takes a while to go down. A mildly citrus aroma. Once again, citrus was up front in taste. Red's left me that bitter grapefruit skin aftertaste (not a complaint). Feel was nothing remarkable, still some carbonation left after all the bubbly head at the start. Several of these would go down well, especially on a hot, summer day. Good beer, very solid brewers at Founders."
"D: Certainly a quality beer and very drinkable. I was expecting a bit more hop character out of this beer, but the rye is front and center on this one. I'm not saying that as a criticism (after all, this is a rye beer), I was just expecting more interplay with a heavy hand of hops. Otherwise, a very good beer."
"D- Moderately high to very high. Clean, great flavors make this beer a treat. Going to buy a case of this for sure."
"Pours a luxurious copper/burnt orange with a hazy, foamy thick head. The beer has a resiny and hoppy aroma, a little more spruce like than piney...Taste is a good balance of malt, rye and hops. Slightly sweet initially, with a good bitterness following. I think this is their best beer!"
"I could drink these all night. ABV is respectable but not one that's going to knock you out after a few. The taste makes me want to take huge gulps and not put it down."
"Opaque dark red with a creamy, sticky head. Nose is very sweet, floral, corn grainyness if that's a word. Sugars permiate the palate, malty goodness coats the jaws, then a blast of smoky hops and esters, lingering bitterness daring you to put it down, which is difficult at best. Mouth is sticky and chewy. Alcohol is in the back of your mind, reminding you that a 6 of 6.6 that goes down this quickly should probably be accompanied by a pregnant yet nagging designated driver. I love this beer. First time in a bottle. I have enjoyed pitchers of this sweet nectar at Chumley's in Broad Ripple with Royce Peacock, but never in a bottle. It's good, and damn good."
"edit: MUCH different as it warms up.. I didn't realize but my fridge must be a tad cold - drinkability is high as warming, as is taste - really balances out the beer with a slight caramel note on the front. must note though, cold = eh. cellar temp = awesome."
"On tap at the Dilly Deli. 10oz. Sample for $3. Even better on tap. The hops and rye really pop out when it's this fresh. Added bitterness is just perfect for this beer. Just an absolute gem. Probably their best beer. I only wish we would see more Founders kegs here in Cincinnati."
"I knew this was supposed to be a good brew, but I didn't quite expect what I got from this. Founders does it again."
"Poured a dark-reddish amber with an off white head. Nose was hops, rye and malt. Taste was medium bodied, caramel malt flavor with rye and hops. Very malty and chewy. Mouthfeel is chewy and coating. Very drinkableand tasty. Well done as usual by Founders."
"Such a good beer. Don't know why isn't more popular."
"A great way to shake up the sometimes boring and redundant pale ale category. I gotta try this with a fish fry."
"D - Well balanced Rye... have had more extreme rye's but this one is nice and drinkable."
"Founders Red's Rye lives up to the hype. It's a big, flavorful, complex beer and one I plan to enjoy many, many more times in the future."
"D- great sessionable beer. i could drink this all day. It goes down easy and is worth every penny!"
"I will definitely get this one again."
"A solid rye beer - not my favorite. I somewhat wish they would have dialed back the hopping to let more rye shine through."
"very tasty and interesting"
"D--Nice beer, but nothing that stands out to me. I would drink this any time it was offered, but won't be buying it again"
"A solid, well done beer."
"D. Great beer I could have a few of these hanging out at Founders a great place to visit."
"Founders never seems to disappoint. I love the rich copper color of this beer. You can smell the hops and while their is a big hop taste it is nicely balanced with a smooth caramel flavor to bring it all into balance. I could easily drink a whole lot of these at a setting. Nicely carbonated for solid body."
"D: Very drinkable. This has a very clean and solid flavor, and the ABV isn't too high, so it's possible to put back a couple of these. I'd love to have this again."
"What an amazing beer."
"This is a great beer. Had this with a BBQ last week and I ended up drinking three of them because they were sliding down so much...I just couldn't put the glass down....tonight as I review it I have similar thoughts....great beer....I have the new Tyranena Rye Bitter woman and I am saving the last one of these to try side by side with that one.."
"This tastes like someone's third batch of homebrew. I've heard a lot of great things about Founders and being a MI native I was very excited to see it in NC. I really hope this was just a bad batch, but it makes me wary of blowing another $10 on their beer."
"As I have said before, In my opinion Founders can do no wrong. Each new beer I try from them is excellent."
"-Oelergud"
"Wonderful red-amber with a thick creamy off white head. Initially the lacing that was left was pretty substantial and sticky, but I really like to swirl which reinvigorates the head, but removes the lace. I could just smell, sniff sniff, this beer. Grapefruit. Really intoxicatingly crisp citrusy grapefruit with a side of pine. On the palate, the rye adds a great spicy quality to the subtly sweet malt flavors. The hop bitterness helps to create a clean finish, and then lingers quite nicely. ""Red's Rye"" has a very nice mouthfeel that is at the same time smooth and a bit prickly from the carbonation. If the beer didn't smell so good, and have such a nice bitter aftertaste, I would have drank it faster."
"D - This was my first experience with rye and I was very pleased...it was like an IPA with an added kick...this was definitely enjoyable"
"Two finger cream head on initial pour, head drops low leaving great ropey lacing down the glass. Lacing is almost solid to the bottom, with heavy cream rings marking the swigs. Body is deep red in color, thick and dark letting very little light in. Nose is nice and floral, though I'm a bit congested so I'm fearing I'm not getting the best smells that I could. Bittering hops are noted as well as some pines notes. Body is super smooth, very easy to drink. Love me some rye beers and this is a great example in my book. A thick low lying head stayed with it to the end. Thanks to tatturbo for this one."
"12oz. brown bottle served in a shaker pint. Pours a brilliant, reddish copper with about a finger of light tan head. Big piny hop aroma. Starts off with a solid malty base with some spicy rye. Great hop bite that is piny with some grapefruit. Long lingering finish with the hops. I'm glad this is available in my area now. This is a great beer."
"D: Yes sir, may I have another?"
"Rich, hazy copper with blonde highlights when held to the light. Small creamy tan head that leaves beautiful fine lace behind. The nose is citrusy hops, caramel and caraway seeds perfectly blended together. Rich spicy flavors blend together nicely, grapefruity hops, rye, toffee and caramel malt in perfect harmony. Medium bodied slick hop oil mouthfeel with bright carbonation. Dry, almost salty lingering bitterness in the finish. Great stuff."
"Drinkability- I could drink this all night, it is pure ambrosia!"
"Poured a dark-reddish amber with an off white head. I couldn't smell any aroma when I tried this beer. Medium bodied, caramel malt flavor and no distinguishable hop aftertaste, not good for something that is supposed to have an IPA characteristic. It was not balanced, malts dominated and there was a strong alcohol taste. Overall this one missed the mark."
"Overall: Not as stellar a pair with my grilled lamb loin with chanterelle gravy as I was hoping for, but not bad either! Terrific with roasted asparagus. This is a solid (if quite bright and extroverted) stand-alone brew; it would also (I imagine) be a hit with antipasto or cold-cut appetizer trays."
"I marked it down in drinkability since it was only 6.8% and it seemed like it was more, the thickness and complexity from the rye kept me from gulping it down quickly"
"I poured the bottle into a glass. A nice dark red color. Plenty of head to the beer. I did not notice the spiciness that other reviewers mention. For me, the hops dominated, with a slight sourness to it. The hops dominating is what hurt the beer for me. I did not notice the alcohol and the only problem with drinking the beer was due to the hops."
"Red's Rye is creamy on the palate, followed quickly by a cutting sharpness that works to accentuate the hop bitterness of this beer. Unfortunately, this leaves me without much desire to drink more."
"Cheers"
"This brew is carbonated almost to perfection, but the super watery feel knocks points off. Drinkability is freaking awesome, middle of the road ABV and tasty ta boot. Solid offering."
"mouthfeel is creamy and smooth yet astringent from the hop addition. good drinkability."
"A-4.0, S-3.5, T-4.0, M-3.5, D-4.0"
"D= great. Like I said its my first dabble with the style and I'm diggin it."
"D: This beer packs a punch even though the ABV is not really high. Its just a big full flavored beer."
"D: This is an excellent beer. It was definitely worth the $8.99 for the sixer. It does an excellent job of showcasing the amarillo hop. Now that we have Founders in Minnesota, I'll be drinking this for quite a while."
"Highly recommended. I will say this: Red's Rye, to my palate, falls off fast, so I only choose it if I know it's really fresh."
"Smooth and sharp, I like the carbonation bite it has. Very smooth and silky. I love the drinkability too. For a cheaper brew, this is an amazing deal. Boy am I glad Founders made it to Minnesota."
"Founders Red's Rye is a beer's beer, with deep foamy good looks, and a flavor that balances sweet and bitter. The perfect start to Memorial Day weekend."
"Drinkability: One of the most strangely alluring beers I have ever had. Wasn't sure I liked it at first, but now that I am finishing the glass, I am crushed."
"Drinkability is very good for the style. Not myfavorite style but this was a good one."
"One of the best of this style I have had."
"This poured a dark, clear copper with light tan head. It smelled fairly bland, like standard copper and pine hops with some caramel malt and a hint of rye. It tasted like strong bitter pine hops, with some copper hops and caramel malt, and a bit of rye spiciness. It was slightly thick with mild carbonation, and a lasting bitter aftertaste. Overall this was surprisingly a hop bomb without as much rye as expected. Nice flavor, albeit very bitter and not as unique as I hoped. Good body and hides alcohol well, but lasting bitterness makes this more of a sipping beer. I'd like to try this side by side with Hop Rod and Rye Squared. On its own, I thought it was enjoyable but nothing too exciting."
"Delicious brew! Goes down really easy."
"This may be the best rye beer Ive had. If you want a RYE-P.A. this is as good as any."
"Drinkability: Solid all around. Founders again. Could easily drink more than one."
"This is a tasty beer, and I'd love to have more, but it is a bit filling."
"Excellent offering from Founders. I'm in love with their stouts and wanted to see how they performed in other areas. Very nice."
"D: A solid, tasty offering. It's very enjoyable, with just a little alcohol warmth adding to it. Fortunately, I can pick it up locally now and look forward to having it more often!"
"D: I'd definitely drink a 6 pack of this."
"Definitely seek this one out, well worth it. Glad that Founders is now available here in Virginia, looking forward to more of their stuff."
"Medium-bodied, easy to drink, easy to drink. Well worth seeking out"
"I love this beer. It reminds me of why I have homebrewed several rye beers. There's just something about the flavors and the mouthfeel that keeps me coming back. This is certainly a marvelous professional example of the style."
"D- Could have a few of these definitely. I would make a session out of this."
"Had this on tap at the Charlotte Flying Saucer two days ago. Review is from notes taken there. Presented in a pint glass with appearence of hazy dark amber color. It had an amzing aroma with a combination of caramel, citrus, pines, and brown sugar. Taste is excellent too with great balance. The hops were really well balanced with hints of caramel. Pretty well carbonated with a nice crisp finish. Such a great session beer. Another good one from Founders. Looking forward to going to their brewery in May."
"D: This is nice and drinkable. One that I would include in a tasting to expand one's knowledge of what is out there. I love this one in the realm of rye beers."
"Drinkability: Definitely high. I really enjoy this beer because it packs a lot of flavor and really nice feel without being overpowering or unbalanced."
"D: Very drinkable. A solid beer that is very nice on a Fall day with the nice hops and the warming feeling of the slightly-spicy rye."
"Overall this is one of the few rye beers I have had, and I really like it."
"D- Well balanced and nicely complex. A smooth, bitter-sweet brew that is most certainly worth a try."
"Amply carbonated. Feel is like a cracker - I get bread, but the CO2 and spice and feel also lend substantial crispness. Creamy towards the end. Medium body. Very drinkable, and nice."
"Thanks Ben! This is a great beer. I'm jealous that you can get this!"
"D: Really easy to drink, good hop flavor, perfect for a cool spring day."
"D: Drinkability is high."
"Quite an enjoyable Rye Ale. Slightly tart in the flavor, a good amount of hops, and balanced. Recommended."
"A good beer if you like rye ales, there is a delicate balance of hops and malt to blend with the rye. No one flavor is overpowering making this a smooth drinker."
"The taste is strong on hops. Strong. Followed by the rye. The ABV is 6.8 but its hard to tell. A great beer for a hot day."
"Drinkability is good but the carbonation problem is what makes it suffer!"
"This is truly a beer to be savored, Founders once again has set the standard."
"Pours light brown/dark red with a cream colored head which quickly vanishes leaving behind some lacing along the sides. Nice nose of hops is the first thing I get, not too much, just right. Some citrus/floral notes follow. Medium in body and perfect carbonation in the mouth, very nice. I enjoy this beer...looking forward to another trip to the store to purchase several more."
"Founder's brews incredibly good beer and Red's Rye is one of many fine examples. Can they do anything wrong? The spicy rye flavor of this beer works like a charm with its (many) characteristics reminiscent of an IPA. This isn't Founders best beer by any means, but it's damn good. If you haven't tried this by now, you're missing out. Go find a few bottles."
"Somewhat slick in the mouth, the carbonation fluffs it up a bit and gives an overall impression of creaminess. The rye bites a little but there is no astingence. This is obviously a pretty big, complex and bitter beer and as such can only be so drinkable. Founders has made the best of it and this is a beer which is very inviting if a little overwhelming. Another awesome beer from Founders. A real treat."
"Served to me on tap at Founders on 4-8-09. The liquid is a very dark ruby red with just a bit of a white head, which dissipates quickly and doesn't leave any lacing. Floral, citrus, candied pineapple and rye notes comprise the nose. As for the taste, spicy rye definitely takes center stage in this batch. Delicious! I also appreciate roasted characteristics, and my old friend Mr. Grapefruit, who becomes more talkative as he warms up to you (do you see what I did there?) The citrus hops and the spicy rye make a great combination. The mouthfeel is medium thick with moderate amounts of carbonation. The flavors are some of the most powerful I've tasted in a non-imperial brew. However, despite its very strong flavors, this beer is quite drinkable. This is a very tasty brew indeed... Amazing, even."
"Worth seeking out. I think I prefer Double Trouble to this, but this is interesting and a quality beer."
"D: Founders just produces good stuff, straight up. Would love to have this on tap."
"D - Very drinkable. No reason one can't have several of these."
"Red Rye is a clear copper color witha bountiful beige head that lasts a long time. It has a pleasant hoppy aroma and also some caramel malt in the nose. It has lots of hop flavors and some spicyness as well as some sweet caramel malt. There is also an orange rind flavor in it. It has a full bodied taste and is very drinkable."
"I don't know who Red is, but I like his Rye ale. He obviously shares my affliction for hops and my taste for well crafted, well rounded beer. This offering is deserving of its reputation and then some! If only the people of Grand Rapids knew how lucky they were. And I'm lucky too; after two trades turned up infected bottles of this stuff, I have BuckeyeNation to thank for finally hooking me up with a good sample... actually, a great sample!"
"Quite pleasant, with a great drinkability owing to the dryness imparted. A good balance of hops and rye, with the rye being balanced and not dominating the palate. Very good overall, and worthy of the praise I've heard of it."
"An amber brew, cloudy, with semi-sticky off-white colored head. A big grapefruit aroma with floral hops and a little fresh fruit in the background. A big bodied brew. Fruit up front (apple and pear) leads to a chewy center. The finish has a nicely balanced floral and pine bitterness which lasts along with a little spice. This is a big and tasty rye beer. I really enjoyed it."
"Future outlook: After being disappointed by Founders Centennial IPA yesterday, this was quite the redemption. I'll be more than happy to have this again."
"All the great complexities of this beer gives it subsequent drinkability! Brilliant!!!"
"Worth seeking out. I think I prefer Double Trouble to this, but this is interesting and a quality beer."
"Drinkability: Overall, a very nice beer that, from what I've read, represents the style well with its grainy rye presence. My personal taste is what's affecting the slightly lower rating that what I wanted to give it, but the rye flavor may be more of an acquired taste or matter of personal preference, but as mentioned, it does go down a bit sour and I haven't ventured into that realm as of yet. So here is where I'm leaving it. I'll likely try this beer again though because it is quite tasty and even a bit of a challenge to decipher all of the interesting flavors going on, so maybe my taste preference will even grow into its favor."
"On-tap at Woody's City Market and reviewed from notes, served a nice crisp red with a decent off-white head. Aroma is citrus hops with a touch of rye. The taste is a nice balance of rye malts and citrus, slightly piney hops. The beer is medium bodied with decent carbonation. This is certainly one of Founders' best year-round beers."
"This beer looked great in the glass with a nice amber color, but upon drinking I was a little disappointed. It tasted and had a mouthfeel of a watered down IPA with some of the hop flavor cut out. Definitely not for someone who is looking for a good hop flavor in an IPA."
"Pours a clear, amber color with some suspended yeast. 5/4 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells hops, a general sweetness, a grainy characteristic that I'm assuming is rye, and some alcohol. Fits the style of a Rye beer. Mouth feel is smooth and slightly chewy with an average carbonation level and a noticeable dryness associated. Tastes of hops up front, some ginger, very slight alcohol, then strong rye, and finishes with a rye flavor and strong dryness. Overall, this is a pretty darn good rye beer and definitely worth a try."
"Delicious. The rye notes add to what seems like an impressive and balanced IPA at it's roots. which is how it should be. The rye notes are delicious and add depth and complexity that's unrivaled. Possibly one of my favorites that I've sampled from Founders."
"A great looking poor. Dark golden red with a head that leaves lacing all the way down the glass. The smell is hoppy and you think you are getting another hop bomb of an IPA (not that this would be a horrible event by any means) but then you taste it and the rye comes out and mingles with the hops and it is fantastic. As it warms the rye starts to dominate and the beer changes a bit, but in a interesting way. Good at the beginning, good at the end, it is a tremendous brew. I'm getting a little tired of Founders just showing up with beer after beer and kicking butt and taking names. Seriously Founders, let some other breweries get a shot at the top of my ratings, it is embarassing. I feel like such a fan boy."
"Maybe I should go visit my buddy Karl and we could have one of these at Founders. Would probably taste much different."
"Had a strong hop scent to it with a hint of the rye. Was a bit heavy on the carbonation which was not surprising considering the head on this one. Overall had a good flavor. Would consider trying one again."
"Overall a must try for sure. If you were going to have just one beer, this would be a great choice. Very hoppy & spicy would overwhelm any lighter beers following it."
"Notes: Why more brewers don't use rye malt in their beers I'll never know. I just love that spicy element that this unique brewing grain brings to the table. I get the feeling that this is just a smidgeon past the ""optimal drinking age", but is still quite delicious nonetheless. Straight-forward and to the point, very nicely done!"
"D - Superb beer in all aspects... This is a fantastic brew that I would have no problem drinking year round..."
"Taste is heavey on the rye malt, delicious, sweet roasted flavor and some good complex hop finishes. Mostly pine and floral hints in the hops"
"A very good beer that I look forward to getting more of when Founder's finally comes to GA."
"Excellent, excellent beer. It's almost painful to get a beer this good in a trade. Founders is beginning to seem like one of my most wished for breweries to expand their distribution to California. I realize that craft beer is still a relatively small market, and, perhaps, any one are can only sustain a certain number of breweries, but, damn it, it's still frustrating. I need a job that let's me travel into other distribution areas. Ok, that's enough digression. This beer is a red amber liquid with a nice head. It's relatively clear and glows when backlit. Good looking beer, but this beer does a lot of things right. The smell is a lot hoppier than I was expecting. There are some big pine and citrus hop aromas on this one with an underlying spiciness. The flavor is not the overwhelming rye-ness that I was expecting. The slightly sour rye notes are there, but they don't dominate. There's wonderful sweet malt and bitter hops. Everything works in balance and in a complementary fashion. The feel is refreshing yet full, but the rye just pushes the whole package over the edge from great to exceptional. Red's Rye is a very, very well-crafted beer."
"I was a little apprehensive about this one at first, it being the latest wild card in my latest mixed sixer. Upon review however, it may just be the best of the bunch! This brew has totally changed my view on what rye beer can be. I would highly recommend this to anyone who appreciates good beer."
"The mouthfeel is perfect, crisp, refreshing, this is a perfect year round session beer. Easy drinking, decent alcohol content. This is a go to everyday beer."
"Spicy rye and hops. Good bready malt backbone. Slightly dry finish. Medium body, some thickness. Very smooth. Tasty."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. Pours a murky red color with a half finger of light tan frothy head that leaves thick lacing on the sides of the glass. Smell is pretty mild but a balance of citrus hop smell and biscuitlike smell, I can't tell which is more dominant. Taste is instant rye/wheat flavor immediatly followed by smooth Amarillo hops and malt. Taste is strong but not overpowering. Medium bodied mouthfeel that coats the tongue with rye flavored goodness. Very drinkable, I session this beer at my favorite beer bar often. This has been my go-to beer lately on draft but have had this bottle in my fridge to review and they taste very similar. This is my second favorite beer to eat spicy foods with(second only to alpha king) and truly a treat when you want a flavorful beer that doesn't destroy your pallate. Quite simply a great beer from a great brewery."
"D- I was a little underwhelmed with this beer. It was good but not great. I will probably try this again sometime, but it's not something I'll actively seek out."
"Had this at the recommendation from a friend in B.A.R. 6. Poured out a rich amber color, sort of this maroon-ish brown. Quite attractive. Smell didn't really hit with much. Sort of a malty sour smell, but not in a bad way. Taste was quite good. Dull piney/floral hops. Good malt profile. A little on the bready, dry side, but it didn't run the drinkability or the overall mouthfeel. Overall, not that complex of a brew. Simple but well done. Had I not known any better, I would've classified it as an amber, just on color and malt tastes. Give this a try if you see it, and I get the feeling this is one of those beers that is much, much better on tap. As I've seen my friend order one at a bar once, and it looked amazingly fresh."
"D: Another really solid offering from Founders. May not be my favorite sytle but this is pretty impressive. Probably more of a Red than a Rye (I think it's closest comparable is Red Rocket by Bear Repub), but it does a good job of stretching the style (into IPA territory) while still staying true. Not quite up to par with their Stouts, but worth a shot if you're looking for something original."
"D- A great offering from founder's that i'm glad is available year round at a nice price. Will get again in future, maybe bring a case to a party to turn some new converts. Not a session beer but good for a few. I just wish founder's had freshness dates."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with good carbonation."
"Slightly cloudy amber complexion with quickly dissipating head, minimal lacing. Aroma is a burst of citric hops up front, with a slightly spicy, earthy background. Palate is a toasted rye malt complimented by the persistent hops. Slightly medicinal and herbal. Light, smooth and oily with an astringent finish. A really very nice brew. My only critique is that the hops could be a touch more balanced between the aroma and the taste. The hop blast up front is not matched in the palate. But this is a really really good beer, a nice uniqueness to it with the rye spice, and well rounded in every respect."
"This is a great all around beer. If you like hops,it's here. If you like malt, it's here. Citrus, check. Very well done beer. This is my second beer of this style and I must say, they are very underated. Give it a whirl!"
"Very good beer. Founders is great. Every style I've tried by them, I would get again!"
"Lazy head colored deep cream, lays thinly across the surface but takes awhile before it breaks apart, not much lacing. Dark burnt orange-red in color, slight haziness deepens the hue further, retains depth along the rims. Nose smells as caramelized as burnt, develops scents of brown sugar, white grapefruit pith, pine oil, apricot pit, flower water, on the whole never gets in your face, that grapefruit the most obvious element, more about keeping it all on the same page. In the mouth it's medium to full-bodied with a steady stream of carbonated pop and sizzle, very active presence. Spicy with a crisp graininess, the citrus a blend of white grapefruit, pink grapefruit and mandarin orange. The malt dimension leaner here, some brown sugar to toffee, appears to act more as a salve for the palate than source of flavor. Nicely floral with a credible level of apricot, peach fruit. Manages to create a unified, consistent presence without ever appearing to attract attention to itself. The finish is long, yet tactful. Never bitter but comes close in the name of refreshment. Pretty damn chuggable."
"Highly recommended to those who like hops."
"Well it's official. I like Rye Beers. The medium body and decent carbonation make for a very nice mouthfeel, creamy and refreshing. A unique combination of flavors make this beer stand out in my mind."
"Overall (this is a broken record now from me) another great beer from Founders. I had somehow alluded tasting this beer, but no more. A very nice drinkable hoppy red that I recommend to all."
"Mouthfeel is oily and slick. Some sips had me thinking that the body was a little too light, however. Nothing too detrimental though. Definitely drinkable, at almost 7% it's easy to wack down more than a couple of these and fully enjoy doing so."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Boulevard goblet. This beer pours a deep cherry brown with a big 3 inch head that left some serious lacing. The aroma is definitly more like a DIPA then anything. There is a good bit of grassy hops mixed with just an inkling of rye spiciness. The flavor is a spectacular example of what rye can do for a the flavor profile of a beer. The rye adds a glorious spiciness to what I would consider a good DIPA. With the rye, this mutates into a spectacular tasting beer. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a light carbonation. In my honest opinion, Founders Red Rye is one of the most underated beers produced in the United States."
"this is a gem as with all of founders beers. pours a dark orange /carmel brown with a great hop/malt balance and the rye make it quite delicious like nothing ive had b4...with good lacing left behind. taste is earthy , ciitrus, pine and a little grapefruit. this is one tasty beer . its not one to drink 3 in a row but rotate 1 every couple of days. the beer is a treat as is their dirty bastard scotch ale...seek this one out it will not disappoint"
"Drinkability punches its way through the roof. Yeah, it's near 7% so it's not quite sessionable, but who gives a damn? This is just a top-notch beer that begs to be drank."
"Tastes of fall fruit, light caramel and cider-like malts with smooth rye spice and woody/herbal hop. Grapefruit hops run amock. Mouthfeel is thick and full."
"Nice and chewy, really great body in this one, but not to the point where you have to take small sips. Alcohol hit me a little on this one, so I don't think this would be a 3 in a row type of beer -- but you'd be tempted to have more than one if available. This is a really great beer."
"thanks donkeyrunner"
"The mouthfeel is creamy and just goes down so smooth. Who would have thought that adding rye to citrusy American pale ale would turn out so well? Founders just makes such a delicious rendition of this rye beer."
"D- I could drink this all night. Balanced flavor and a moderate amount of alcohol make this super-sessionable. If you got the money I guess."
"Drinkability-ABV a little too high to be sessionable. The flavour is big, although is masterfully balanced."
"Mouthfeel is lighter and has a dry pucker to the end. I'm not overly wowed by this one."
"Mouthfeel is creamy, just enough carbonation bite to let you know it's there, medium-full body. Very nice beer, and one I could drink for an entire chilly night."
"Mouthfeel is full and oily. A weee bit too frothy and light, but besides that, I dig it. Overall this is... really, really nice. I could see myself being in the mood for this, often. And shelling out cash for this, often. Oh come to Florida, come to Florida!"
"Note: I think this a seasonal brew, so it may have been sitting on the store shelf for a long time in less than optimal condition."
"D - Good beer, the rye beers are different and exciting, and are great for those looking for a change"
"The taste also opens and closes with hops but rye spice and a mellow caramel malt make this one especially tasty. The texture is full and thick but goes down easy. At at dangerous 6.8, a sixer would get you pretty toasted pretty quickly. I think I'm going to buy a sixer, this is really good stuff."
"This is a very nice offering from Founders. A good mix of sweetness and bitterness with a dash of rye mixed in. It is light bodied and somewhat less creamy than I would have expected. I would say this is a very sessionable beer and at 6.8% abv. I could get into some trouble."
"I found this beer to be a sipper, but if you slurp down Brettanomyces for breakfast, lunch, and dinner you might be inclined to empty your glass a bit more quickly (obviously this beer isn't a Brett beer, but it's still very sour). Overall, an incredibly satisfying beer from Founders."
"D: Again, the word outstanding seems to fit."
"A wonderful beer from a wonderful brewer."
"Another good brew and one of the original and still top rated beers for style."
"Overall, one of favorite beers I can regularly find and buy all year round."
"Drinkability: One of the best if not the best rye beer I've ever tried. Everything melds very well here, with a handful of distinctly noticeable and enjoyable but nonetheless well-connected and mutually-supporting flavors and aromas. Not too terribly much wrong here - comes highly recommended."
"Conclusion: This is a nice, straightfoward, hoppy, rich Pale-Ale style beer with a good kick of rye spice and breadiness in the background."
"Drinkability: I would have this again, but will not search it out. It is not a bad beer, but nothing jumped out at me either. I do like other Founder's ales better"
"This beer was delious."
"Very impressive."
"Nice smooth rye taste with a nice hop bite finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and a little heavy. This is a very drinkable beer, like most rye beer I suppose."
"Drinkability: Founder's continues to impress me all the time and this is another big weapon in their arsenal of beer."
"I was at Arcadia just a few hours before strolling into the back country forest preserve party that is the Founders Brewing Company brewpub. And Arcadia's rye might have just been the perfect primer for the Founders Rye, a beer I've had a few firkins of by the bottle and tap, but never one so close to the source. What amazes me still about the Founders Red's Rye is its insistence on freshness. Though a beer absolutely consumed by peppery, anisette hops, it verges on being a drinkable barleywine because the rye is so intense. This beer would only taste better with a corned beef shooter. Which is to say, you never see this much balance in what really amounts to a double IPA. But the graininess here provides great liquid-Jell-O-like texture and body, not to mention flavor, that makes the hops all the more interesting. It's as bitter as all get out, but maybe closer to Rogue's Old Crustacean than to something like 3F's Dreadnaught. I love that. I love that a beer can be this hoppy and still let the malt shine. Not more than five brewers in the world can balance the extremes this well, and none do it better than Founders."
"I can't put my finger on this beer. Some sips I was of the mindset that it was a well crafted, interesting beer, but on others it seemed like a jumbled mess. Weird. I normally like rye in beers but wasn't completely convinced with this one. It's complex and caught my attention, but didn't make me completely enjoy the experience. Huh."
"Pours a dark, ruby colored ale with off white head with a little lacing left behind each sip. A mild and restrained scent of syrup, hops, grains, and pine notes. Delicious in taste: deep notes of grain, sprinkles of juice (some apple, some citrus), hop finish without the dry. Rich in taste and medium bodied. A great brew I will revisit many more times."
"A rye take on one of my favorite styles. The head goes fast but the malt it their to stay. Thick and chewy, sappy and a bit of french toast. Dark fruits underly the hops; black cherry dipped in molasses and a bit of spicy caramel. Some wood floats atop on the high note accompanied by pine hops, tingling the wash down. Deep in potential, hiding many notes within the family to be revealed. A star addition to the hoppy red selection."
"O: A very good beer which ranks up there with all the other Founders beers. It is easy to drink a few of these and not get tired of it."
"6/4/7/3/14 (3.4/5)"
"Pours a burnt copper that illuminates a bright orange with fiery red highlights. The cap and lacing left behind are the best part of this beyond delicious looking brew. The cap is almost identical to that of a root beer float,the edges fall away at a snails pace leaving a mound of cream fluff suspended by strings of lacing that connect it to the walls of the glass. The nose smells very hoppy and sweet,with big grapefruit and pine sap notes. Some banana and malty bread crust on the tail. This is hoppy but not as hoppy on the pallet as the nose leads on,don't get me wrong there are plenty of hops. The rye adds just a touch of sourness and helps strengthen the malty bread crust undercurrent. A spiciness presents itself subtly and in the form of RYE which is awesome and lingering. The body is near perfection,very creamy with a moderately dry finish that keeps drying after the last swallow. I really didn't want to take the last sip of this beer and yet I couldn't look at the last swig for a moment longer. This Founders offering is outstanding."
"D: Yes, drinkable."
"D: great! one of my all time favorite founders. Get a hold of this beer if you can"
"Drinkability: This beer is extremely refreshing. And even with all of the carbonation, I drink the piss out of this beer and don't feel gaseous, bloated, or full. I really enjoy ryes, and this is my favorite bottled rye so far."
"Notes: Just a great all-around brew, no bullshit, no gimmicks, no hype."
"Overall, very happy that I decided to purchase a bottle of this. Will have to invest in a 6-pack sometime soon."
"I poured a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. This beer is damn good looking. It pours a clear ruby red with a massive head. The head has great staying power and leaves beutiful lacing. The smell is quite floral with a hint of citrus. The taste is heavy on grapefruit, the taste is very similiar to a good IPA. Founder's red rye is a medium bodied beer that can be easily quaffed. I really enjoyed this one."
"D - drinkable, wouldn't go out of my way to get ahold of some more however very good, my favorite Rye beer so far"
"Pours a nice deep red color, although with very little head and almost no lacing. Good smell, hearty and spicy, a nice maltiness to it as well. Excellent taste, a nice wheatish beer with great spiciness from the rye; a nicely balanced beer. Goes down fine, nothing great, nothing bad."
"This is one of the best rye beers I've ever had. Seek it out. Another winner from Founders."
" Bottle,draught,Nitro tap.Pours hazy amber with a descent off-white creamy head. Aroma of fresh citrusy hops mingled with matly sweetness and a just a hint of grain.The flavor is awesome, first you taste fresh hops, some citrus,some floral,and then you get some of the malt sweetness, the flavors deepen as it warms,nice full mouthfeel,with a dry finish. This stuff is The Bomb !"
"D - It may be a touch too alcoholic to session, but otherwise I'd say the beer is spot on in this category. Very good."
"D - Delicious. I've said it before, but I've yet to try a Founders beer that I don't absolutely love."
"nice crisp flavor. good balance of hops and rye flavors blend very well together. gives a nice creamy even coated mouthfeel with mild carbonation."
"D: This is a drinkable beer, to be sure. It goes down easy and is pretty lively."
"Beautiful reddish copper brew with caramel malt fruity sweet bread on the nose. Well balanced grapefruit with a kiss of pine on the buds. Malt came through first and foremost and bitter hoppy aspect devolved over a few sips. Mouthfeel is dusty and dry, but I mean that in a good way. Very nice! Yes, very nice!"
"12oz bottle. Pours deep reddish amber with off white head. Good lacing. Aroma is hops, rye, caramel malt, and citrus. Flavor is hops, caramel, malt, rye, dark fruits and light citrus. Mouthfeel is perfect for a rye beer with good carbonation. Finishes nice with good malt profile and balance. A delicious brew."
"Over-carbonated. Every careful pour leaves me way more head than I need and there's plenty of carbonation to."
"Overall - I've never had a Rye beer that was this good. It's very smooth with characteristics of an IPA but different enough to make you appreciate that it is a Rye beer."
"Very enjoyable and easy to drink. Solid brew."
"A solid & quite tasty brew right here. Unique flavors that work well."
"Hopped like an APA with an incredible dryness, one fine brew. Hoppy aroma half pine, half grapefruit and citrus. Nice amber pour huge off white head that stays around 1/2"" in thickness, lots of web-like lacing. Dry finish, very full and satisfying on the palate. Good all around flavor lots of malts, the strength of the hops seems to mask the flavor of the rye at first but eventually the rye is detected. Real good malt presence, great beer."
"Pours a cloudy reddish brown with excessive amounts of thick yet pillowy off-white head that exhibits remarkable retention. Aroma is mostly spicy rye with some pleasant piney hops and a bit of fruitinesses. Taste is relatively straight forward, its pretty much just rye and bitterness with some thrown in for good measure in the finish. Mouthfeel is ok, medium body and moderate carbonation. Drinkability isn't all that great. I really didn't find this very enjoyable, it seemed a bit harsh overall."
"Red's Rye is an exceptional, easy drinking rye beer and one of my new favorites. If you like this style at all you owe it to yourself to try this."
"M/D: Medium bodied, carbonation is just right, slightly creamy. Very nice drinkability. An excellent beer. I'm continually impressed with the Founders offerings, good to have them in NC>"
"D - An enjoyable hopped up brew. A little strong, but there's a great harmony of flavors going on here. The best I've had from Founders so far."
"Overall: absolutely delicious and clearly deserves its rating as the number one rye beer. If you havent had it, TRY IT"
"This is one of my session beers. OK, I'm a hophead!"
"Fine example of a rye beer; perhaps not as innovative as it is balanced, but that's jsut fine by me."
"The drink is silky-smooth with a prickle of spice and toast that keeps the hardcore dark sweetness of Founders Red's Rye in check. On the full side of medium-bodied, the brew is soft on the palate, yet a bit chewy and gritty, but without a doubt entirely quaffable. Highly recommended."
"I had this beer on tap @ Sunset Grill & Tap. It pours a dark amber with a 2 fingered white head with very nice lacing. The smeel was very nice and hoppy, with a very nice malt base to it. The flavor followed suit, a very nice balance between the two and its alwasy nice what flavors the rye adds to beeds. This beer was nicelt carbonated and the mouthfeel was good and a drinkable brew, but not an all nighter."
"The mouthfeel is well carbonated as noted above, but remains medium bodied. Highly drinkable, but you may want to pour the second as you drink the first to let the foam monster subside."
"pours dark red/copper/orange colour with beautiful whte-ish head. Gorgeuos. Smell - citrusy hops, some raspberries, hint of rye. very nice deep smell. Taste - bready, hoppy with slight bitterness. Very balanced, very smooth, wonderful brew. it's drinkable too, I just can't get enough of it. In my this year's Top 5 for sure."
"i can safely say that i have never had a rye beer. this was quite a nice start. APA copper/amber color with a bit of murk. lace is there. good amount of head. smell is very cirtus ester. particularly grapefruit. some sweet some astrigent. very good blend. nice on the tongue. hop, fruity sweet, piney yet grainy. wonderful blend of grain and hop. wonderful use of fruit. great beer. will definately have again."
"M: Slick with a hoppy bite and lingering tannin quality."
"Served with about an inch of dark tan nitro-smooth foam with considerable staying power on top of a dark coppery beer itself. Unfortunately the head somehow seemed to limit the hop smell I was expecting. Nothing wrong or off, it just seemed tame. However, Nitro-tap makes it much smoother and creamier than I've had it before and definitely let the flavors blend more. As I said above, this was not a smack you in the face with hops beer, followed by a rye aftertaste. Instead they blended and grew as I enjoyed it. This is a beer to savor over a long time, not pour down."
"D - I'm no rye expert, so I can't comment on the rye-ness of this. OVerall though, a fairly drinkable, full flavoured ale. A bit raw tasting maybe, but seems to work."
"4/3.5/4.5/4/4"
"D: More bitter than i expected, but this is the first Rye beer that I have tried so I read the description of the style and tried to write my review with that in mind. I would like to get one or two other rye's and see how this stacks up to them."
"The beer pours a brilliant amber with a creamy tan head that holds fantastically and laces well. The smell is of caramelized sugar, citrusy & piney hops, and spicy grains. The taste is fantastic, spicy rye, floral, citursy, spicy, and piney hops. The flavor also has plenty of caramel sweetness. The mouthfeel is creamy and medium-full. Overall, fantastic beer, i could drink this all the time."
"Red's Rye pours a deep, nebulous red with a giant frothy head and some vile lacing. Smell is of spicy rye and sweet malt with some herbal, floral, and fruity hops. Chewy mouthfeel, smooth, and creamy. Spicy initial taste which leads into a sweet, mellow maltiness. The hop bitterness is strong but it isn't enough to overpower the malt. The finish is long, and the presence of alcohol increases as the beer warms."
"D - Great beer."
"D - wow, my friend from Chicago brought me this and it rules. It's nice to see something that can hold a candle to Terrapin Rye for once. Highly enjoyable. Would certainly drink more if I could afford it"
"D: It is exciting to drink. Wonderful introduction to rye beers for me. Founder's treats it more like an IPA, but with this rye character, there is something different than other IPAs."
"D: Ok dirnkability overall, Decent combination of mouthfeel and taste. Pretty good beer overall; a nice session beer, but nothing too impressive."
"Complex and unique, but to bitter(rye?) for me."
"Pours a hazy copper color with a single finger cream colored head that fades into a thin coating on the surface. The nose yields a nice lemon almost grapefruit like aroma. The taste is much the same as the nose with the addition of a slightly sweet maltiness. It is medium in body and carbonation. Overall, a pretty solid brew."
"Bottom line: This is an *awesome* brew! It is probably the best of the style that I have ever tasted!"
"Dark and hazy amber/dark red color with a nice two finger head that sticks around for quite a while, becomes rocky and fades after several minutes leaving some nice lacing. Nice floral and citrus hop aroma backed up by a nice caramel malt sweetness in the nose. Taste follows suit. Plenty of crisp rye flavors, a healthy bit of citrus rind bitterness, sweet in the middle, and dry on the finish. Incredibly silky and smooth on the tongue. Hopppy, semi-sweet, very well balanced and an always welcome edition of spicy rye malt. Very nice brew."
"when poured, it looks just like apple juice with a nice off white head with slight lacing. it smells of rye, citrus hops, grapefruit, hints of lemon, subtle sour red apple. the taste is red apple, rye, citrus hops, grapefruit, mellow lemons, caramel malts. medium to full bodied, medium carbo. A great rye beer!"
"A rye beer for those who don't like rye beers...and those that do. The rye is one ingrediant, not the solo star, but a featured performer. Definitely worth a try."
"I wasn't expecting this beer to be so hoppy but being a bit of a hop head I throughly enjoyed it. This beer may have a recurring role in my beer fridge."
"D: Great drinkability. Wish I could get 6 packs of these in the NW..."
"D - this is a solid beer. Nice balance and easy to take down. Makes for a great staple in the refrigerator."
"solid A"
"Yet another excellent Founders' brew, though I think it's going to be tough for them to top that Breakfast Stout of theirs."
"The beer is a heavy brick of a brew. Really not prudent to drink too much of this one. It's as filling as a milkshake."
"Very smooth and creamy with a nice medium-bodied feel. Definitely a high drinkability and I would absolutely recommend this to anyone. My second experience with Founders and they are definitely shaping up into one of my favorite Midwestern breweries."
"The appearance is amber with great two finger head. Nice lacing as well. This is one of the most fragrant beers i've sniffed. Fruity, faint citrus, hoppy, perfumy aroma. You can taste mild citrus hops, tangy malts with some orange, minimal dried fruit, grains. Mouthfeel is an exceptional creamy thick feeling. This beer has a nice hoppy finish that doesn't overpower the grains, but definitely balances out the semisweet malts. I first had this at Bukowski's in Boston and then got some to review. If I could get this in austin I would drink it often. What is it about Michigan? They an make an interesting beer!"
"I drank this right after I had the Upper Canada Light Lager (which had a lot of flavor for a Light Beer but...) you can imagine the adjustment. Right from the first second I smelled a strong sharp hoppy aroma. Cloudy brown color with a moderate head. Quite strong rye flavor with a hoppy bite to it. Spicy, sour and a little sweet. This is a nice beer."
"M/D - Medium bodied with a very dry finish. Damn tasty beer with a nice mix of hop bitterness and rye spiciness."
"D: Drinkability was good, really liked this and easy to drink. Dry, bitter, crisp and everything you come to expect from a good rye beer. definitely one to consider."
"Drinkability is oddly enough, excellent for something that starts out as hot as this does. It simply increases the more you drink of this. At first, I wasn't impressed but the more I drank it, the easier it went down. Would recommend this beer but remind them to keep drinking it as it gets better the warmer it gets to a point."
"Low to medium amount of carbonation. The overall drinkability is pretty good, although too much citrus hops tend to overwhelm my palate after awhile. But I can really enjoy sipping on one of these, the taste keeps me wanting another sip. Overall, another nice brew from Founders."
"Edit. Duh. And thanks to OHLRangers for this one, too!"
"Overall: What I like most about it, the flavor and mouthfeel, do detract from enjoying in the summer like I did. Regardless, this is one tasty brew that I really enjoyed and will be buying more of in the future."
"a bit dry for my liking, could use a little deviation from the amarillo hops. Still this grows on me with every sip. Nice, not sure I'd session it, but I'd be happy with ordering one if on tap."
"This is a very fine red ale. I know it is a rye beer, but it's sort of a red ale made with rye in my eyes. Anyways, it's very sessionable."
"Tasty tasty taste, the hops in high regard here, almost bitingly bitter right away (but I like it!) and the rye is nice, then settles to a sweetly malty thing, lots of Belgian caramel malts supposedly used here are used quite well. The mouth is smooth, good body and carbonation. In all, not quite spectacular, but damn tasty and a fine brew."
"D: Drinkability is out of this world, the look the smell, the feel and the taste of this beer are enough to make you feel guilty about something. Most of the time I tend to find Founder's beers to be a bit off in the flavor department, I don't really enjoy the hop profiles in their beer, they taste almost metallic oftentimes. But this beer, this I am a fan of, I huge flag waving fanboy to be exact. Excellent, excellent beer."
"D: Wish this were available closer. Would love to always have a six pack of this in the fridge."
"D: I liked it in a bottle and I like it on draft. Founders make some real good brews."
"I am really a fan and will be back for more of this beer."
"Well, I just went out and tried one tonight after reading the reviews on here. Well, I must say a well-crafted beer, the rye was just to strong for my taste! Otherwise, good looks, pretty easy drinkability with little carbonation, but one was plenty for me, doubt I will try it again as I just couldn't get into the rye, but if you like that kind of thing, you'll probably love this, give one a try!"
"One of Founders' best, and one of their most simple. This went down frighteningly quick. Almost too drinkable, but with a beer this tasty and this sensible of an ABV, there's really no such thing. Seek it out."
"D: i could easily session this. it is hands down the best rye beer and the best amber i have had yet. i keep trying too find a rye that beats it. so far, no one comes close."
"The feel is really prickly with fine carbonation- almost creates sort of a sting. I think this beer would benefit from a bit less. I think the key is not serving this one too cold. As for any Rye in it... I don't know.. but it was good anyway."
"D: Excellent. Goes down real easy."
"Drinkability is remarkably high. Beer is sessionable and has great flavor. Not as aggressive as say Hop Rod Rye."
"D= I was blown away by this beer. Maybe I didn't go into it expecting enough, but this is a big beer. My only real critique is that it is a bit overcarbonated - and that's saying something from a guy who loves high Belgian carbonation levels! Highly recommended."
"D- Definitely a beer I could session on a porch in the summer. Very Refreshing with a decent hop presence and malt balance."
"This is a beer that surely got better the more you drank, a fine thing. Im far from an expert on rye beers, but if this epitomizes it, Ive got to try some others."
"Despite the apparent carbonation problem, it turned out to be pretty good. Nice and crisp, spicy, with a good hoppy finish. Not one of my favorites, but it's good."
"Holy Crap could I have this all the time. It poured dark reddish brown into a pint glass with a two fingered vanilla head that would not go away except to leave some medium thick lacing. The smell was of grainy malts and floral hops and was very present. The taste was definitely filled with rye and balanced by the floral hops. It starts out with some caramel notions and then gets grainy rye style before ending with a nice bitter feel and some good hop taste. The mouthfeel is great as it is refreshing and perfectly bitter, making it extremely drinkable. This is a great rye."
"Pours a very dark brown in color with ruby highlights. Off white head sits atop. More hops than I was expecting in the taste, but that's a pleasant surprise. You don't get the rye until midway through the drink. It stays around on the finish as well. This is a very well done beer. There are some hop notes coming through on the finish as well. This beer is getting better and better with each sip. Cheers to Founders."
"I found the mouthfeel to be kinda big, but the flavors keep the mouth occupied. I think that overall this was a wonderfully tasty beer, that while big, was balanced and primed the drinker for another. Will stop by Mr. Capone's and grab some more, but this time I'll save them for a cool October evening when I have some dried cherry wood in the fire pit."
"This beer is pretty big and juicy but it is also very delicious and balanced enough that I could (and certainly would) have more than one. Were this on tap near me, I would drink it often."
"D: This is probably the best rye beer I've had and an extremely unique and tasty brew from Founders. Highly recommended."
"This has alcohol? Covered very, very well. This just disappears. Very hoppy, but shows a nice malt base. Great use of rye. Unique and very well done."
"D-Above average and well crafted but I don't think I'm a huge fan of rye in beer so I wouldn't reach for too many more. Well crafted beer though"
"You would never know this guy is clocking in at just under 7%. A great beer for this time of year."
"Very balanced and drinkable beer."
"D - A very nice brew. Obviously not sessionable but with this much flavor going on you can sit and sip a couple."
"This is one to cellar."
"Medium in body, smooth and creamy. Tingles on the tongue between the carbonation and spice. Pretty good drinkability, but I wasn't digging the herbal and floral hop flavors."
"Straight out of the tap into a regular pint glass, this brew poured deep, dark , cloudy red with a thick foam that stayed around through the whole drink. It smelled very floral and hoppy. It had a heavy body and tasted wonderfully of hops and some cirtus hints. It finished hoppy but barely bitter and would very drinkable. I really enjoyed this one and will have it again."
"D- My oh my, this is one tasty treat. The rye and hops are great together, not too overpowering great balance, make sure you have this a spicy burger or some sharp cheddar"
"D, notes: This taste a lot like a west coast IPA. It tastes good but I can't really tell how this is different from an IPA."
"Drinkability: excellent afternoon beer that is perfect for a lazy day of hanging out and having some beers. This could be a session beer for me."
"D - I could see myself downing a few of these with no trouble, it's a very enjoyable beer."
"M/D- Medium body, good over all complexity and a great amount of carbonation makes for another delicious, easy drinking session beer from Founders."
"As much as I enjoy good deli rye bread, this is indeed the finest use of the grain. The sharp tang joins the glassy hops to blend into a very refreshing and graciously drinkable quench-fest. The long finish keeps the rye on the palate, just the quality you want if your goal is to really enjoy this beer. Simply said, this is a do over, and over, and over, and..."
"Recommended..."
"It is difficult to believe this ale is 6.8 percent alcohol as it is such a refreshing, smooth ale. This ale is appropriate for any time of the year. I would love to have this on tap at its most fresh."
"Poured into a taster glass with a dark copper and red color, slight head. Tropical fruit hops, sweet malt aromas and flavors. Floral and nice spicy characteristics. Very balanced and easy to drink. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and good carbonation level. Would love to be able to buy this beer or find it on tap."
"An excellent beer that makes me want to crack another!"
"adequate carbonation. mid body. i like this beer. i would drink again. this could be a session beer. good rye."
"D- Very impressed with this brew. Easy to drink and will come back for more."
"This is a great summer time beer, that is a easy drinker. Would love to get my hands on some more."
"Overall, a well balanced beer that is very drinkable. ABV not noticeable. Really wish I had more of these waiting for me in the fridge."
"Drinks very easy the crispness keeps the ABV in check. I could happily session on this, in the upper echelon of rye ales I've had!"
"Beautiful color with a relatively thin head for this rye, which dissipated fairly quickly. First impression of taste: nice in the mouthfeel, with a bit of bitterness on the tongue after. It was a pleasant beer to sit and enjoy."
"I never thought I'd say this, but this beer had way too much head. It took nearly ten minutes to pour the beer into the glass since I had to keep waiting for the head to die down. The color is nice though, a deep golden amber color. A lot of lacing obviously. Smell was very malty, a hint of sweetness to it, not really impressive though. Taste was about the same. A little more of a grainy taste to it, overall the taste was pleasing. The beer was somewhat carbonated, pretty smooth and not too full. I probably wouldn't drink more than one or two of these in a night though, I don't think it's really my style of beer."
"Overall, a great beer however I dont know if I'm a big rye fan. I never got into rye whiskey and I dont know if I would like it all the time. Its enjoyable but in a really small quantity."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, I had heard this beer was similar to an IPA and that it was highly acclaimed but I was still surprised at how much I liked it. This is a beer that I could drink several of over the course of an evening."
"I'm not normally a big red fan but the hops really make this one. This is an extremely drinkable beer that I could enjoy all night long."
"Final Thought: Hands down, a world-class beer in the USA, and competes for that credibility globally, an impressive brew that is a hit on so many levels, I couldn't be more pleased!"
"D - Overall, a great beer from founders that has a ton of flavor and was easy to drink. Could not even taste any of the alcohol and given that it was only 6.8% that does not make too much. I really liked this beer and was surprised by how much punch it has. Once again, Founder's has made a great beer that helps to blow us all away."
"D- Awesome beer. Highly recommended. Quality stuff from Founders."
"Recommended."
"D-Not something I would sit down and have a few of. Definately a one or two beer kind of night."
"I purchased this as a single on recommendation of the beerman there. I would not have gotten it otherwise (as neither red ales nor rye tend to excite me in the beer world), but this is a very good beer, and I have to thank the Merchant Beer Man!"
"D - I enjoyed this sample very much and would love to have more."
"This is a quality beer. It's not something I prefer due to the big hop profile, but the base beer is quality. Bring the IBUs down and I would probably be a big fan."
"Enjoy and don't pass by another excellent Founders offering. Definitely a fridge stocker, you will want to sip this sud regularly."
"D: There is a strong bitterness here, but boy, is this one tasty beer. Don't know if I could drink this all night, but I could definitely build to this and end the night with it. Highest Recommendation."
"Drinkability: It's all kinds of okay! I'd go for another, really I would."
"D- If it wasn't for the hops this would be an easier drinker. I think it is more difficult to drink b/c of them. Overall a pretty tasty brew but I wish I could taste more hops."
"Overall, everything about this one just begs me to drink more of it... Not conventional, but very intriguing.."
"D: A solid brew... worthy of another glass."
"I like the flavor of the beer. A hopped up and slightly sour beer that is unique. The high ABV being the only thing lowering the drinkability."
"Sorry, but to me, this was a drain pour and was dealt with accordingly. Bitter wood isn't the way I like a beer to taste."
"Cloudy, thick maroon with a frothy off white beige head. Smell is bittersweet malt with a lovely rich earthy hop aroma. Taste is somewhat more light bodied than expected, with a smooth earthy, grassy, faint sweetness. Nice rye flavor, and a quality beer that suffers from a metallic finish however."
"Pours a hazy brownish red with a great deal of light white foam, which leaves a thick layer on the glass. Nice aroma, malt, spice, maybe some fruit in there. Taste is a tad less impressive, mainly malt and a hint of rye, but not as much depth to the spices as the smell would suggest. Strong carbonation and a bitter aspirin aftertaste. Overall, not outstanding, but very solid and drinkable."
"D: Easy drinking, I wish i had more"
"16 oz, on tap at Vintage. Pours amber with a 1 cm off-white head. Aroma is a sweeter citrus and a little malt. Initial flavor is a bold maltiness, slight rye and hop notes. Flavor becomes drier at the end. The taste is by far the best part of this red ale. Some lacing, light carbonation, light to medium body, and well hidden alcohol. Drinks well and will continue to consume as long as its on tap."
"Overall, an easy-drinking sessionable effort. Very well done."
"D: I definitely noticed the alcohol content in this beer after I drank it but it is a very pleasant and well-balanced brew that I will be enjoying more often in the future."
"D- i am so unbelievably glad that i came across a six of this, it might be my new favorite beer in the world."
"D - Could have a few more..."
"Another solid beer from Founders. What a surprise. :-)"
"Overall I was literally blown away by this one. I was not quite sure how good it was going to be, as I have loved almost every Rye beer I have tried, but this was by far the best. It just had that great hop profile and the spicy notes that really but it in a class above the rest., I would love to get as much of this as I could and have one every night. A fantastic beer."
"$1.90 single from Archer in Chicago."
"Bright and crisp initially and medium bodied throughout. A juicy, mildly bready finish as well. Moderate carbonation. I can't stress enough the drinkability of this brew. With its well balanced but extremely flavorful nature, I have no doubt I could put these back all night and never tire of it. Don't expect your run-of-the-mill Rye Beer. This one is a gem."
"A little thicker then I had expected. Almost hearty, with the carbonation giving it almost a gritty feeling. A little slick, like greasy, cold chicken soup. Don't choke on a noodle. :P"
"If I could find a sixtel of this within 100 miles of PA, I would go out and buy a kegerator. It's that good."
"I sure hope I can find a place around Columbus that sells these in sixes. If not, the seven hour drive to Grand Rapids suddenly seem justifiable. How long do growlers last, again?"
"drinkability is great. this beer has a nice balance, with the alcohol almost completely hidden between the nice mix of citrus sweetness, malt, and grapefruit bitterness. then there's the light rye spicyness rounding things out and keeping it interesting. good stuff."
"Pours a orange-ish/ copper color with a reddish hue, with a small off white head. In the aroma, dry rye-ish grapefruit. In the taste, a small grapefruit presence with a dry rye maltiness. A smooth and light mouthfeel with a dry grapefruity ryeness in the aftertaste. Dry rye and a grapefruitiness mix, best red I think I have ever had."
"cheers."
"Drinkability- This beer absolutely rocks. I assumed it would be good but I never thought it would be this good. Its terrifically balanced (maybe leaning a hair toward the hoppy side, but not by much). Awesome brew and a huge thanks to Matt!"
"The experience is over, but the impression lives on. The only other helpful information I have on this beer is to get a bottle as soon as you see one."
"2007 bottle. Sticks nicely to the glass! Also nice top and nice slightly cloudy red body. Amarillo hoppy finish is a real nice compliment to the maltish grapefruit aroma. I've had this on draught too, but it's been awhile. Need to get a growler of it next time I visit! This is one smoooth rye!"
"Founder's has to be one of my favorites. For some reason I have never picked up this offering and glad I did this time around (need an IPA break). Don't be like me - if you see it - drink it immediately."
"D - A new favorite beer. Extremely well balanced in taste. Very appealing nose. Goes down so smooth and delicious."
"Pours a nice very slightly fogged amber with ruby hints when held to light. Minimal tan head does not stay long at all. Nose is nice and fruity with a decent amount of sugar/candy in the mix as well. Flavor is pretty robust. I guess the rye really comes into effect here and gives a fairly bodied experience. Seems like the profile is mostly of wood. Nice and hearty really. Feel is good on the liquid and the carbonation is fairly full. Smooth and drinkable, but slightly more of a sipper than one to pound down."
"This was a good beer experience."
"Can't believe I never got around to having this before."
"Drinkability: Good, solid robust ale. Another ROCK SOLID offering from Founders!"
"Thanks to Pegasus for the sample."
"D - Quite a hoppy red ale with lots of flavors and pretty complex hop profile. The rye presence is quite subtle. Good balance of malt and hops at the start, but hops linger for a bit longer, resulting in a moderately bitter finish."
"The Red's Rye arrived in a stemmed goblet. The color was a crimson red with a creamy tan head. There was a nice citrusy sweet bouquet with hints of pine. The taste was sweet and spicy with a balanced hop bitterness. This is the best rye beer that I have ever tried."
"Murky ruby amber in appearance. Fluffy head falls to a nice collar of lacing around my tulip glass. Aromas fill my nose with grapefruit hops, sweet malt, and tangy rye. Tastes of a balance of sweet sticky malts, spicy rye, and grapefruit. Some carmel mixed up in there as well. Bold but simple, I love it! Has a nice crisp finish to it. Mouth feel is nicely carbonated with a thick chewiness to it. I love rye beers so the drinkability is fantastic for me. Incredibly tasty! This beer would complement a rare steak off the grill. Highly recommended!"
"Would appeal to anybody who can appreciate a hoppy red ale and those rye malt lovers out there."
"D: the well balanced character and medium alcohol volume make this very drinkable. This would be a good session beer."
"Thanks to Demcorhip for the bottle!"
"On-tap on 1/10/14 at Rail Trail in Hudson, MA. It bears repeating...phenomenal beer in every essence of the word. Wow."
"Overall-This beer is definitely the best rye beer I've had and is a fantastic beer in any category."
"Absolutely delicious beer from Founders. If this was in my back yard it would be my staple beer. Pours reddish orange with litttle head and some spotty lacing. Smell is of slightly sweet malt and some spicy rye as well as citrusy hops. Nicely balanced and very appetizing. The taste is magnificently balanced and proof that non-extreme beers can be astoundingly good. Very nice blend of rounded malt, slightly spicy rye, citrusy/piney hops, and some fruity/bubblegum like esters. No one flavor components dominate, they just form a harmonious quartet. Beautifully drinkable wwith a smooth but slightly spicy mouthfeel. Delicious."
"Drinkability: I was very impressed with this beer and was disappointed I only bought the one."
"A red light ruby color, with touches of amber. An off white colored head forms, about an inch thick. A citrusy hoppy frgrance, with touches of malty sweetness, followed by a hint of spiciness from the rye. The taste blends well starting the sweet malt, then the rye takes over, then it layers to grapefruit and grassy flavors. The rye and the hops linger on the palate for sometime. A even balanced medium bodied feel, it glides across the palate leaving a slight arid feeling. This is a very good beer and is quickly becoming a favorite. The 6.8 percent alchol it would be hard to consider this a session beer, but man is it hard to not have two or three."
"This beer is delicious. It goes down easier than its 6.8% ABV might suggest, but its also a very complex beer. Both sweet and savory, this brew deserves your complete attention. The folks at Founders have delivered another fantastic creation."
"A good and drinkable beer and if I find it somewhere on tap I'll be sure to get a pint."
"D: Great drink and will enjoy again. My favorite Founders thus far."
"d: Its different from the other beers I've had, I don't know if its the rye or something else. Certainly unique and I like it. I only have one bottle, but if I had more, I would definitely try another and try to get a better grasp of its flavor and aroma which are both similar to an ipa, but a little different. I wouldn't call it a session beer, but I wouldn't shy away from seconds either."
"Pours a nice amber red with lively carbonation. Smell is caramel and citrus hops. Taste is much of the same. Some nice caramel malts and bitter hops. A light chocolate malt underneath and as it warms a good peppery spice comes through. Mouthfeel is very nice. Somewhat bitter with a spice that helps cut this short of too bitter. Medium bodied and great. An easy drinking brew, for sure. Glad I had a chance to try a couple of these."
"Overall- I was quite cautious going into this drinking. I had all but convinced myself that I didn't care for the style. However, this goes to show that it's not a bad idea to come back and give something another try."
"the only way I love a hoppy beer is on tap, this brew however is the same either on tap or by bottle. Only for the trained pallet can you detect the rye. Vivid color, frothy head and grapefruity taste this rates one of my favorite brews.It lives up to it's name. I encourage all to try."
"Pours a reddish brown color with a thin lace of head. Smell is sweet and has a grapefruit aroma. Taste is bitter with grapefruit flavor. The beer goes down smooth, but has a very bitter aftertaste and is slightly sour. This is one exceptional beer. Another great offering from Founders."
"Eric"
"Appears a clouded amber red with a large beige head, large bubbles with scant lacing all around my pint glass. Aroma is wonderful with spicy rye edges and pine and citrus hop layers built around the bready malt base very nicely blended. Smell is really piercing with the sharp rye and alpha acids from the hops it really tickles the nose hairs. Flavor is great with upfront bitterness spicy bready malt layers touch of caramel and biscuit tones with a current of hop flavor including citrus peel, pine cones, and herbs. Touch of alcohol in the finish but it's hard to say where the abv is at in this one. Mouthfeel is medium bodied creamy oily textured and evenly carbonated not bad at all. Drinkability is great one of those beers that is definitely case worthy, I wish I had another to follow this one."
"Mouth happiness: pint after pint after pint A sessionable beer for me"
"D- This is a good tasting beer and worth inspection. Is it complex enough to warrent continued inspection? I'm not sure, perhaps when my sinuses are 100% clear, but I'm not convinced it would present much more."
"Bottom line: This is one of my favorite beers. Enough hoppiness and at a reasonable price. Buy a six pack."
"After drinking this beer, I can say I owe bozebus17 a great debt of gratitude for introducing me to my new found friend. I will definitely be making a point to pick up a bottle or 6 next time I visit my fav beer store!"
"Tastes like an IPA with some rye in the finish. Good malt presence and some grassy and citrus hops in the finish, followed closely with some bitterness. I detect some bitter orange flavors as the beer begins to warm up. I like this one."
"I really like this beer. It is very drinkable. At the same time it is complex and beautifully crafted."
"Pours a very attractive ruby color, a bit hazy, with a thin, bubbly white-tan head. Presented an aroma primarily of hops. Taste was toffee/citrusy sweet with a strong hop finish. For some reason I couldn't detect anything that was uniquely rye, though I don't doubt it's in there. Taste was typical of an IPA. I know this is not strictly labeled as an IPA, but that's what it resembles. Mouthfeel was moderately crisp with a sticky finish. Drinkable enough and I'm glad I tried it. I won't be hunting around for it, but I'd gladly order one if it was on a restaurant beer list."
"Pours a dark amber color with a slight red cast to it. Head is small with a mild milky off white cream texture. Left a milky ring in the glass with each sip. It actually tastes a little like toasted dark rye bread. Six of these would be plenty in one evening. I really liked it and will buy it again."
"This is a great beer. Thanks to Adam for hooking me up, and I definitely have to find some more of this and get it in the fridge."
"Overall- Boy, this was good! 6 of these would be quite an evening!"
"Nice medium amber color with an inch and a half of white-tan head, nice and frothy, that takes its time dissolving and leaves great lacing. Nose is all spicy hops. Nice toffee malt comes through as well. Taste is excellent, and very well balanced. Fruity hops up front, then nice toffee malt. Smooth ending, fruity and spicy hops in the end. Breadiness and grapefruit at very states too. Body is crazy thick and creamy. Very good carbonation. I really love this beer - great flavor and totally unique. One of my faves from the always good Founders."
"D - paired with a spicy sezchuan stir fry. Wonderfully tasty and perfect with my spicy dinner!"
"D- This became more and more drinkable as I finished my glass. This was my first rye beer and a very well done ale all around. I am looking forward to trying other oferings from founders."
"Scott"
"The taste is that of semi-salty hops with lots of spiced rye, a hint of banana, more citrus, and more hops. Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing, with a medium body and a spot-on carbonation level. Packs quite a bitter finish as well. This is a well made beer, no doubt about it. It could use a bit of something more in the flavor department, but that's just me nit-picking, as it's extremely well rounded w.r.t. everything else. Nice job, Founder's."
"Drinkability: Surprisingly high. I thought this would be the type of beer I would try and just think was so-so from the name. What you get, though, is a tasty brew that rewards you as you go with a good change in taste after warming. Alcohol is not present at all which always adds to a beers drinkability. Very good beer."
"Pours a cloudy amber-red color with a full finger light tan head that's wispy and fades quickly to narrow sheets of lacing. The smell of rye gets me a dry nutty malt character. Medium bodied, the mouth feel is adequately carbonated with a tingle of bitterness up front that finishes with a dry and subtle grainy note that lingers appropriately. Full flavored, the taste is uniquely rye, with the same spicy nutty character as the nose. A really nice drinker. I've really had some great experiences with rye this year."
"Dark red body with a off white head.Citrus,"spray starch"" smell to it and some pineapple.Grapefruit taste then some nice malts.Bittering hops are there as well.Creamy mouthful,good beer and a great hoppy beer.I dont know where the ""spray starch"" smell and taste comes from but it sorda distracts from the overall taste and smell of the beer.You should try it."
"D - The ABV sneaks up on you with this one. I have bought this beer for years and am just reviewing it now because it manages to disappear out of my fridge before I even realize it."
"Pours a dark amber / brown color with a thick and puffy white head. Leaves layers along the glass as the session goes by. Malty smell with caramel layers, and a nice hoppy scent. The taste is very malty as well with great balance of they rye, and hops. Mouthfeel is not really existent, and makes for a smooth drink."
"Had this on tap at the Founders brewpub. It had a bright amber red body with a one finger white head. The aroma is aroma is very hoppy and spicy with a good rye character. The hop aromas are very citrusy. The flavor matches the aroma with strong citrus notes and rye spiciness. The rye is a bit more subdued than I would have guessed from the aroma but the hop flavor is almost so intense that it creates a muddled taste. A pretty good beer all around though."
"Pours a hazy rusty orange/red, thick off white head forms, lots of lace spots, good retention, solid ring on the glass. Smell is sweet and malty, lots of toffee, spice, orange and citrus, nice balance, and a good sweet rye kick to it. Taste is very malty, some orange/lemon zest, toffee, tart rye, touch of chocolate, very dry finish, assertive bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation, nice balance, rye makes the finish almost puckeringly dry. Not the freshest bottle, will have to try again when I see a fresh batch, but still pretty damn good."
"drinkability is good. a couple of these would go down easy, and leave the drinker with a thirst for more, all while not overwhelming the palate. overall this is a very well balanced beer that will take any palate for a ride. the aroma and the taste do not relate completely, but that adds to the interesting nature of the brew. cheers!"
"On tap at Three Floyds Brewpub, and served in a pint glass. This beer poured a dark amber color with a thick, creamy looking tan head that slowy faded away. Some thick, chunky lacing was left on the sides of the glass. The aroma was made up of sweet caramel along with some strong citrus hop notes. A touch of rye malt was also present. The flavor was very robust with a good amount of malt showing up right away, then finishing with a lasting piney bitterness. The mouthfeel was medium to full-bodied with minimal carbonation and some light warming alcohol. Very tasty. I cant wait to have some more of this!"
"Superb brew. Pour slowly or else be prepared to wait a while for the head to dissipate. Pours a very dark amber red with a great, rich, forever frothy very off-white head that lasts all the way down. Lacing is also heavy and has excellent retention. A very dark resin slips out of the bottle if held long enough. One of the best looking brews I have had, honestly. Smell is of strong hops with a very sweet citrus twang. Very tempting. This is an excellent, full bodied, complex brew. Rye malt is powerful, so are the hopps. There is citrus here and something else that I can't pinpoint within the hopps that make this hop heavy beer extremely well balanced, smooth and enjoyable. The ABV of 6.8% is easily disguised by the complex flavors. This is a home run by Founders. A must try for all that appreciate great a great brew."
"This bottle of Red's Rye looks beautiful when poured, with a rocky off-white head of foam with sugar-spun lace sticking to the side of the glass. It is indeed a red ale, with a wonderful candied orange hop nose (at least at first) mixed a touch of pine. Later on, this beer starts smelling like a bit like a wood shop (think: sawdust). It is very mellow at first, before the caramel malt flavors get coated with spicy hops and a touch of roastiness. The bitterness is very assertive and almost overcomes the palate, crowding out the other flavors. I would call this a Rye IPA for sure and one that is all about the hops. I couldn't detect the flavor of rye at first (too much hop flavor got in the way), but as this ale warmed up I was able to pick up a definite rye spiciness. The mouthfeel is smooth, but the body is a bit thin. (This actually makes the beer dangerously quaffable.) I would definitely drink this again if I was in the mood for an almost menacingly bitter, hoppy red rye ale."
"D: A great beer by Founders, incredibly drinkable, even with the high ABV, I just wish that they distributed to my area, so it wouldn't be such a hassle to obtain this great beer."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with a notch on label but no clear indication of what it means (I got in a trade so no idea on age of beer). Was a cloudy reddish orange color. It had a good light beige head that stuck around as a thin film with a little lacing. The smell was very malty with some hops but not as much as I read in other reviews (could be freshness issue). The taste was hoppy which was odd since not much hop aroma. Didn't really like it after the 1st couple drinks but then it hit its stride and grew on me. Need to try again when I know it's fresh but I could see drinking this one every once in a while (if avail here which it's not). Overall, a good beer that I'll try again but for now it's a once a year beer when I go home to Indy to see the folks. (4, RB, T, O)"
"Drinkability: Awesome. This is the second rye beer I have experienced, and it is amazing. I could drink this anyday, in every season. I wonder what the percentage of rye used in the mash was. Overall, awesome."
"Edit: After drinking some more, I have to say this is best fresh. Still excellent, but the flavors are definitely a bit more muted than fresh. Since I never reviewed this here fresh, the numbers are overall. Aged about 1/2 a year, the overall would probably be about a 4.2."
"enjoyed this one at bukowski's tavern in boston. $5.50 for a bottle. pours nice copper ale and wow, what a great smell of fresh rye right away. great balance, do not notice the hops or alcohol. not for novices to enjoy. one of the best, if not the quintessential rye beer."
"The beer pours a nice red color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a wonderful malt scent that boasts of pale, crystal, and rye malts. It's sweet with a peppery rye aroma as well as some mild hop scents. The taste is good. It has a spicey flavor that boasts of hops and rye as well as some burnt toffee. It goes down smooth and finishes with a dry bitter hop bite. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking beer. It's got a unique flavor that I really enjoy."
"A very enjoyable beer, but more like an IPA."
"Update: This is one of the better beers I've ever encountered and had the pleasure of knowing. Sublime. This is so near perfect, I'd like to know what perfect is..."
"Terrific and very drinkable beer!"
"Drinkability: could do two in a night, probably not back to back though"
"This is a predominately dry beer. While the malt is present, there is absolutely no sweetness. The hop bitterness quickly takes over and lasts long after the swallow. The body is wonderfully full and the carbonation is perfect."
"If I can say one thing about Founder's, they do hops right. I love this beer. Appearance is a nice deep red/amber hue (it is a red ale) with a nice off white head, decent retention, and lacing. The aroma was enough for me to know that this beer was going to taste good. I am guessing that it was dry-hopped as it has that nice floral piney hop aroma that I crave. Taste is well balanced with a good malt backbone to follow up the hoppiness. My taste buds are not discerning enough to tell what the rye was doing here but an excellent beer none the less."
"D: Overall, a winner, one I'd love to have again. Superbly balanced, nice flavors and enticing aroma. Definitely recommended."
"Drank right at Founders brewery on a beautiful sunny day. The pour on this is great with compact head on top of an amazing ruby red body-I dont think that I have seen many beers like this. Nice hoppy smell but not too overpowering with a bit of fruitiness maybe too. There isnt too much hoppiness in the taste but more of a malty taste, but all very clean and smooth. Unfortunately I cant comment too much more on this beer as I dont drink alot of rye beers so there may or may not be some of that in there too. I did enjoy this beer though and I will definitely have it again."
"Lots of bitter aromatic hops start to finish, with a toasty, dry, tangy malt. IMO this is too much a super hoppy IPA made with rye, I would like to enjoy the rye more with perhaps less of a hopslam. As an IPA the malt is too dry. Nevertheless this is enjoyable to drink."
"Shows off a beautiful murky burnt amber with a fluffy one finger off-white head that dies down to a nice layer that stays throughout. Stickiness is crazy good, all over the glass for entire tasting. Almost a crystal like lacing that glistens. Smell is of a clean rye, but not overpowering at all. A very nice citrus/grapefruit hop blast as well. Mild coffee malt seems to balance this one out quite well. Taste was quite a surprise. So much smoother than I had anticipated. The powerful hop odor doesn't dominate the taste at all, and I love it, but the citrus is still there. Definite malt towards the end, so balanced. Drinkability is pretty high because it's so smooth and clean. I have yet to taste a beer like this, and I am so glad I have. Definitely seek this one out."
"D - Really great drinking beer with a fair alcohol content, so awesome drinkability/sessionability. Definitely right on for its rating."
"This is the most thirst quenching beer I think I have ever had."
"I was very excited to see this one available in PA. Deep burgandy orange color with a sticky off white head. Rings of lace are left behind as you drink it. Smell is not what I expected but very nice. Tons of hops. Some fruity traces but I get more of an earthy tone than anything. Taste is all bitterness up front but it somehow manages to finish clean. I'm not sure where the rye comes in on this one but i really don't care. The hop oils are noticable in the mouthfeel. Very drinkable especially at the price i got it for. A well crafted brew and one of the better ones I've had in a long time. I will pick this one up whenever I see it."
"wow, the best rye i have ever come across. deep, hazy amber/ reddish brown. i normally don't really care about the head on a beer but the head on this is this off-white, craggy monstrosity that does not want to go away. the lacing is like a wall on the glass. there honestly was a ring of head sub-structure-a suspended ring of head an inch below the water line. have never seen anything like this. a ring of head inside the fucking beer an inch down from the top. wtf? nutty, roasty/spicy, citric, dark fruit, bread in the nose. light initial malt sweetness is quickly taken over by supporting abundant hop bitterness and roasted/spicy malt flavors. hops are pronounced. long finish. mouthfeel is medium, creamy, and nicely carbonated. complex enough to leave you wanting more and not too high of an abv."
"Pours a gorgeous, almost luxurious ruby red color topped with plentiful tight meringue like head. Aroma is filled with a mass of hops, centennial and chinook perhaps; much like a Bigfoot or Ruffian, telling me this will be a delicious beer. As the hops or pushed aside (very difficult), I'm able to smell some tropical fruits like mango, kiwi with a little bit of faint baking spice coming through, perhaps a sign of the rye. The hops are a lot more subdued in the taste, with a creamy smooth mouthfull of malt with a very dry finish. I'm not too familiar with rye beers, but I'm curious is the very dry finish is characteristic as its a detraction for me; I'm looking for a little sweetness to balance. But, that is my only complaint...the flavor is very complex bringing waves of hops and spice reminiscent of rye bread sans caraway. Unfortunately, that dryness will bring down my drinkability score a bit."
"The best rye beer I've had to date, and again probably the most impressive beer I've had in recent memory. It's perfectly balanced and quite refreshing."
"Medium bodied. Clean, dry finish. Very drinkable, though a bit on the bitter finish side."
"Taste is burned like black malt, and now the bitterness is able to overpower this burned taste. The rye is there and is a little oily and husky. Actually the bitterness is very much upfront and has a citric hoppy taste, that is also piny and oily. I never tasted a beer with Amarillo hops and I am not sure if this is a typical US hop. For me this beer is out of balance and too bitter, my mouth gets numbed after a few sips. Mouthfeel is a little sticky and lingering bitter."
"Overall, a ballsy amber with lots of hops flavoring."
"Thanks for throwing this in as a great extra brandoman63."
"This rye ale pours a clear amber-red with a moderate off-white head. The head diminished to a thin skim with some lacing. The aroma is highly hoppy and high citrus, with a little bit of fruity and sweet. The taste is initially rather bitter, pleasantly so, with a high citrus hop flavor. Toward the swallow a little bit of sweetness emerges and the finish is then dominated by a lingering hop flavor and bitterness. The finish is crisp, but I cant really pick out the rye between the immense hop presence and seemingly fair amount of crystal malt. Overall this is a tasty brew, I would put it into the IPA realm, similar in some ways to SN Celebration Ale. The aroma and hop flavor are my favorite very fresh and inviting. The color of the beer is also very nice. Ill buy this one again."
"Deep ruby colored into a goblet with a small cap of off-white head. Continuous rising bead all the way through and some lacing left behind. Mostly floral hoppiness, maybe a grapefruity hop smell somewhere in the back but mild. Smells alot to me like Bell's Two Hearted. Floral notes also in the taste with a very bitter hop bite. Bitterness felt throughout entire mouth, possibly one of the most bitter hoppy beers I've ever had. Medium bodied with prickly carbonation felt on tongue. Drinkability was only affected for me by the huge bitterness in the aftertaste. An excellent offering from Founders that I may have to try again since Founders is finally allowed in Pennsylvania."
"This beer pours a slightly cloudy, darkish red, with only a little head that doesn't hang around long. The smell is nice, ripe hops and some grain. This is a medium bodied beer with a moderate amount of carbonation. The taste is strongly hoppish with a sweet grain. You can taste the oils and embers of the hops and it is very pleasant. The only downside is that the after taste is a bit too strong, too much of a bite, and the middle and end aren't that distinguishable. What you taste on the front end is what is there at the end, which makes it anything but complex. This is a fine beer and very enjoyable, though. L'Chaim"
"Founders in PA? This will be great. Though I prefer the Black Rye, I look forward to picking up some of it and this beer as well whenever I'm out shopping."
"ovearall this is a very tasty beer that i would definitely drink again, not sure what distinguishes it from most IPA's though."
"The beer poured a bright amber color with a massive and I mean massive thick foamy head into my pint glass. The head was so thick and foamy that it reminded me of the head on a root beer float. After giving the head some time to subside, I took a wiff and the nose was pleasingly hoppy. The taste was of rye and malts with a good peppery taste on the tongue. Very interesting beer."
"Pours a slightly cloudy dark amber red color, nice carbonation, nice two-finger creamy off-white head, lots of nice sticky lacing throughout the drink. The nose is of malts, hops, nice touch of rye and caramel. The taste is malty/hoppy, nice touch of caramel, and slightly bitter. Medium body. Drinkable, a nice rye beer, I think my first."
"D: Incredibly refreshing! A perfect ""anytime of the year"" beer."
"This beer pours a deep copper with a yellowish head. A nice looking beer, its head is a bit frothy and clingy and tends to fade a bit. This beer carries a hefty Amarillo hop aroma that really pulls through. In my opinion this beer is not as balanced as advertised. It is very good and very drinkable but certianly balanced toward the bitter quite well. I was hoping for the belgian crystal malt to shine thorugh a bit more as the malt character is rather muted. Aside from that, it has the ability to encourage the next quaff. The rye does lend a spicy character that blends well with the hop bitterness. The body of the beer is moderate to low, quite drinkable."
"12oz. bottle poured reddish orange color with a nice frothy head that sticks to the glass. Smells of a light citrus hops and some malt. Taste has some citrus and floral hop flavors along with some yeast and malt. The feel is light with a bit of creamy thickness to it. This brew is another excellent drinker from Founders but has that bottle conditioned yeast flavor that I'm not a big fan of."
"Pours a deep ruby with lots of sediment from 12oz bottle into tulip glass. Huge tan head with brown speckles takes several minutes to subside. Looks like the top of a root beer float. Head leaves moderate lacing. Aroma is sweet rye. Taste is rye with sweet citrus hops and carmel malts. HInt of bitter at the end. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Very drinkable. Will buy more of these next time. Excellent beer!"
"Very enjoyable, a nice session beer but for the ABV. Very fruity with some warmth. Rye there, but mellow, nicely balances the sweet components of the beer."
"Don't underestimate the flavor - if you like hops, and are intrigued about how a bit of rye spiciness adds to it, you can't do much better. Few beers more tasty have ever crossed my lips."
"Very drinkable, but if I haven't said it enough, wasn't meant to be cold. I reccomend storing it at room temp, and putting in the fridge for 10 minutes before drinking."
"It's a nice, easy drinking beer that is gone before you know it."
"Pours a dark hazy reddish color, small 1 finger white head that doesnt stick around very long (probably due to an unusually slow pour.) Great oily lacings all around my cup as I drink. Smells of sweet citrus hops, very overpowering thats really I can smell. Taste of grapefruit all the way on this one, impressive. Medium bodied with a great mouthfeel, low carbonation, and a nice tart pine aftertaste. The balance is superb in this brew, not too sweet not too bitter, great overall, exceptionally smooth. I could definetely have a few of these."
"I found this to be quite drinkable and really enjoyed the quick transition on the palate from this one, as it made it for a quite interesting and ejoyable beer."
"D: A nice, well made beer. I enjoyed this. Very drinkable and very tasty. If I ever found this again, I'd be sure to pick up a sixer."
"D-It is good. I don't think I would hunt for one but if I saw it I would pick a couple up."
"Overall a fantastic brew. For anyone who likes hops, this beer is a must-taste. I keep a couple of these on hand at all times."
"Drinkability: Goes down fairly nice, I honestly drank it faster then I thought I would. The fact that I am unsure of what to expect from this beer really indicates to me that I should try it again later."
"Overall: Thanks go out to ggaughan for this great beer. I really like it, and would definately drink it again if I ever get the chance."
"Pours a slightly hazy orange/red color with a slim beige head. The nose displays notes of bright fruits, grapefruit, faint rye, and estery alcohol. Rye flavors are of slightly peppery tones, musky, and earthy florals and balanced by variable sweet to dry waves. Toasted grains and toasted hops that displays citric acidity, mild tart, pithy, caramel, and brown sugar sweetness. The finish is of spices hops that stick to the palate and a rye character that is dry, earthy, and chary. Medium body and medium carbonation leaves an overall smooth mouthfeel, a creamy middle, and some cloying to boot. This brew is such a tasty treat that I like to have extras sitting fridge for whatever occasions."
"D - Very enjoyable - would make for an excellent session beer, as it's one to be savored without worrying about excessive alcohol. Definitely recommend picking up a sixpack if you have the means."
"Drank this from the distinctive Founder's 12 ozer that was bottled in September 2006. Pours a cloudy reddish-brown. Very small head but great retention. The flavors and aromas aren't as complex as I expected. Smells were dominated by the sweet hops; flavors featured mainly piny hops. These aspects of the beer were definitely good, although the beer seemed more like a great IPA than a Rye beer. Medium creaminess complements the tastes. Overall, another good beer from Founder's - I'd reach for it again, now that I know what to expect."
"cheers!"
"D- The only thing hurting this drinkability is the dryness of the beer and the amount you want to savor the awesome beverage. Highly recommended, just be patient with the pour if you get a foamy batch."
"D - I could see myself enjoying this beer 3 or 4 at a time. One of my favorite rye beers. Seek it out and enjoy it. Cheers!"
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a ruby-amber color with an off-white, bubbly head. Smell is dominated by spicy hops. Taste boasts the same spicy hops with a smooth finish, alcohol is hidden well. Beer is medium bodied with a creamy consistency and not very much carbonation. This is a tasty beer and is thus very drinkable. I would recommend this beer."
"D - This is a great beer. My first Founders beer and I think I'll have to try many more."
"Drinkability: Overall a very good offering. It does remind one of Hop Rod Rye a bit, but the hops are far more subdued here to let the rye shine through. This brew conveys a sense of richness, but with some conservatism. A fine job by Founders."
"A good, smooth, tasty beer."
"D: This is a very original beer. A bit too rich for a six pack in one evening but a nice change of pace indeed. A highly recommended elixir for those willing to try something different!"
"drinkable?: maybe as can be, i have had a dance or two with more drinkable dipa's."
"Cheers!"
"Thanks to Norkyorksammy for the trade!"
"Drinkability - this is excellent, truly original, inspired, and it's entirely sessionable."
"This is yet another beer that just gets better and better with each sitdown with it. The first few bottles poured with a really huge head to the point where I had to wai ten minutes before I could drink the red liquid at the bottom. After I switched glasses, it poured much more smoothly, with less head, and a pleasing clear red. Lots of sediment lingered toward the bottom of the glass, which might turn off some people, but didn't seem to play a huge part in the overall experience. The first whiffs were of overwhelming cocoa and caramel, which was completely the opposite of what I was expecting. With some warming and spinning, I noticed a much more bitter smell, almost as if the initial sweetness was never really there. Taste was divine, with some crisp green apple tastes at the beginning, and some strong hops and rye towards the end, leaving a bitter taste on the palate. The hop/rye marriage gave it a really nice spicyness as well. Body was medium, and gained complexity as it swishes around in the mouth. As with nearly all Founders beers, theres a near perfect balance that has to be experienced to truly understand. Drinkability...I am pouring another one right now in the middle of this....it is very easy to drink. In a previous review of the Black Rye, I asked myself which one I liked better. Now I have to say that this one gets my vote as the better of the two (though the Black Rye is matvelous as well). This is another example of why IMO Founders is one of the best breweries in the United States. Now if only I could get my hands on some Breakfast Stout during it's always brief stint on liquor store shelves in this state. Cheers"
"Bottle courtesy of Tpaliga. Poured a cloudy deep brown color ale with a huge slightly off-white foamy head with good retention. Aroma of bitter hops is quite overpowering with some malt being noticeable. Taste is a mix between some caramel malt with some overpowering bitter and citrus hops. Rye is present though not overly noticeable. Body is above average with some low filtration, which is appreciated. While I did appreciated this beer I would have prefer less hops and a bit more rye."
"Drinkability: Very good balance between sharpness from rye, maltiness from darker grains and generous hopping. Highly recommended for hop heads and those who like maltiness that finishes dry rather than cloying."
"D - I could drink this stuff all damn day."
"Very disappointed that my first experience of this beer was a contaminated bottle. It has definitely been plagued by the grand funk of death."
"Many thanks go out to trbeer for the opportunity to have this delicious libation."
"Overall, one of the most drinkable beers I've had. This was an exceptional beer and lived up to the hype. An excellent choice."
"It is so hard to find a rye beer on the west coast. Thank goodness for trades. Thanks Dave."
"Drinkability: As I alluded to in the mouth feel section, this beer is pretty damn drinkable. It has everything I would want in a session beer, lots of flavor, great balance, and a mouth feel that is not too heavy."
"Pretty drinkable. A solid beer."
"Quite drinkable  thank goodness I have another one"
"Hats off to Founders...again and again."
"Explosive, rocky, thick rusty tan head lords over a burnt orange-red body. Nose is largely pine and citrus (orange-lemon) hops (Amarillo, yes). Singed caramel and rum raisin malt background barely penetrates. Those hops kick off the palate with a delightfully acidic and citrus bitterness. Slightly sugary, scorched caramel and rummy malt follow. Hop bitterness pervades and makes for a tapey, pine resin finish. Medium body. Nice."
"Last swigs: Picked up a red ale and a pinch of rye. Might need to try again."
"Big thanks to Kyle for bringing these down to me on a recent trip. After tasting two beers from Founders, I need to have more. Great beer, and incredibly well made. I can't wait to have more of them. Founders, start shipping to VA!!!"
"I later noticed that this is my 100th review, and what a damn fine brew to have on such a momentous occasion!"
"I have a hard time finding fault with this beer (it is even a good value for craft beer); I will be drinking this for as long as they're making it. I can't think of a beer I'd recommend more highly."
"Highly recommended beer."
"Recommended!!!!"
"Thanks to nucular george for the sample."
"-SS"
"D- Very smooth and creamy with a low enough ABV to make a nice session. Some nuts and cheese make a great pairing."
"This is one tasty beer, and a must try for those who like things with rye, like beer, whiskey, or bread. Would make a great session brew on a cooler night when a bigger brew is needed, would also make a great crossover brew for someone who likes rye and can handle a little hops. Ill be drinking this one again soon."
"Pours from the bottle a cloudy, opaque reddish orange hue under a huge, thick and frothy beige head. Superb head retention throughout with a trail of thick lacing. Pleasant, moderate aromas of pine needles, caramel , lemon rind, spices and rye toast meld together nicely. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a spritzy carbonation. Initial flavor seems dominated by the malts revealing a subdued caramel, toffee sweetness. This quickly transcends into a hefty hop and rye flavor profile showing off assertive notes of grapefruit, pine, rye seeds and spicy black pepper. Finish is a mouth-puckering combination of a chalky-like mineral dryness and hoppy bitterness which hangs on nicely. In the end a great balance of the malts, hops and rye to create a pleasurable, unique style."
"This began with a good, medium-tan head, but it didn't last and became just a light coating on top of the beer. The color was a reddish-orangish color with a slight cloudiness. The nose was both hoppy and spicy, like pepper. The mouthfeel was medium to thick with a huge mix of flavors on the tongue. Malty sweetness, hoppy bitterness and a peppery bite, all on the palate. The finish had that characteristic bite of rye, making it the lingering, prevalent taste. I'd drink this on a regular and continuing basis, if it were available in my area."
"A new beer to add to my list of favorites. Very nice."
"This rye beer poured a clear, dark, red, coppery color with creamy, tan foam that persisted and coated the glass. The smell was rich, spicy rye goodness with other malt and hops in the nose as well. The taste was bitter hops combined with rye malt in good balance. The mouthfeel was almost dry but with a touch of sweetness. It was smooth with medium body and good carbonation. The hops built to the finish, and the malt lingered on the palate in the aftertaste. This was a very nice rye IPA. (Thanks to Warriorsoul for this one.)"
"The drinkability is high, Excellent! Balance is flawless. O how I wish I could but this here. Thank you Shbobdb, Excellent pick! Prosit und Zum Wohl! MK"
"Great color, substantial head on pour. Beautiful appearance. Taste was disappointing. The bottle I obtained had a very distinct rye taste and smell. If you like rye, this one's for you. It comes as advertised; it's not called ""Red's Rye"" for nothing. I was hoping for some sweet undertones, maybe a little burnt sugar to offset the rye, but not to be."
"Nice well rounded beer. Hops may be a bit overbearing (thus minimizing the rye character), but I like hops, so it's no big deal."
"D: Another winner from Founders. Highly drinkable and refreshing. I will have this again."
"This beer is a solid, whole package kinda beer and nicely crafted. Every aspect of this beer is represented well - malts, hops and Rye character. Reminds me of the Bear Republic Hop Rod Rye, which is another personal favorite. Yet another excellent beer from Founders."
"D: I could have a few of these. Full-flavored, yet smooth."
"Poured with a head massive enough to be called gigantic. Body is crimson orange. Nose is sharp pine mingled with orange and grapefruit. Taste starts with pine, moves to grapefruit, then segues into caramel. Very nice. Mouth is big and burly. If I could get this without trading I would certainly do so. A winner of a beer."
"This is another great beer from Founders. Real nice."
"single bottle purchased at Woodman's in Madison"
"D: I'm not a huge fan of rye, but this is definitely an enjoyable and well-designed beer. Not a session in my book, but a nice beer to things up."
"The rye character was deftly integrated into the flavor profile of a an amber ale - a nice bit of spicy punch to the hops, with underlying malt sweetness that balanced well. The ruby-red color is certainly eye-catching, and the beer overall grabbed my attention right away. Perhaps my favorite from this brewery."
"Thanks for picking this up Eric!"
"Pours up with a tan/mocha head that sticks and sticks with the pint glass served to me at the Landmark 1850 in MKE. Color is a deep maroon/dark brown with faint carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass. The nose is highly hopped, grapefruit and citrus, some piney notes... but a lot of organic....dry and musty grains as well. The flavor is somewhat like a smooth barleywine...very dry with dark fruity base and nicely hopped. There is however a definite rye flavor in the back of this one that gives it a character all it's own. A distinct flavor....like I have had it before....but I have not had ""it"" before. The mouthfeel is creamy and well carbonated. Overall a damn drinkable brew...Try one...on tap if you can."
"What a beautiful beer this pours out. Rusty orange-tinged, copper appearance with a buttery, off-white head that just never fades. Strong hops on the nose with some warm, peach fuzz that mellows the hop burn. The piney hops and rye make this a deliciously bitter brew. However, the estery fruit characteristics make it sweet and smooth going down. I'm gonna polish off this sixer without a problem and I might even go get another before the night is through. Pick this up, you won't be dissapointed."
"Color is as expected, a ""reddish"" amber. Rye adds a pleasant ""sour taste", but the main taste is bitterness from start to finish. Body is medium; could be a touch fuller. An excellent ale for those willing to try something different!"
"Body is nearly perfect. Not too chewy or thin; a perfect beer on a hot summer NC day. I could drink a 6er of this, but alas, I have only two :( Whoever Red is, I like his style!"
"Dark red, with a full head of white foam. Sweet caramel and floral hops in the nose. Flavor is hoppy and malty and dry, with a light Belgian malt twist. Good dry hoppiness and distinct rye character. Sorry, I dont feel like discussing the beer further."
"Dark Mahogany color, mildly hazy with a fluffy tan head, that leaves a delicate lace on the side of the glass. Subtle nose, with hints of citrus grapefruit and a light herbal quality from the hops. Slight nuttiness from the rye malt. Just a light caramel hint on the finish. The taste is lively and fresh. I notice the nutty character of the rye immediately. This is followed by mild green apple, with a grapefruit hoppy finish. Nice dry bitterness. The mouth feel is slick, just a little sweet. Good drinkability. Overall, very nice beer."
"Drinkability - only have 1 six pack, but i am going to find more."
"This is truly an exceptional beer and another reminder that I need to explore Founders more often. A definite regular in my fridge, I could drink this beer everyday (and sometimes do)."
"Really nice."
"music: wolfmother"
"Served in a pint glass, the Red's Rye pours a red/orange color with a small off-white head. It has more of a citrusy and less of a floral hop smell to the beer. The beer definitely has a strong flavor to it. It tastes like citrusy (grapefruit) hops, with some spicyness from the rye, with a bitter finish to it with the aftertaste lingering for a while. There's a good bite to this beer. It has a medium mouthfeel with some pretty good body to it. I'm not exactly a hophead, but I found this beer to be pretty enjoyable. I guess I like the bitter hoppy bite this beer has! I'd recommend it to others to try, and I would drink this again given the opportunity (I only bought a single bottle of this)."
"Overall: Red's Rye is well-balanced. The hops are balanced well by sweet malts, but aren't overpowered."
"That's beer. Very smooth on the tongue with sparky carbonation. Fills the mouth well, and with its well rounded flavor is a beer I will enjoy for a long time to come."
"Excellent beer I wish I could get in the NW."
"Tastes caramel and rye musky. Hop bitter is in line with the malt and works well with the rye edge. Tangerine hop flavor with modest lemon and orange. Gently caramel. Gentle alcohol gives the citrus an aromatic ride. Dry finish keeps the md-thick body from hanging. Modest carbonation despite the strong head."
"This beer poured highly carbonated, actually over flowed out of the bottle, then took about 20 minutes to finally pour into the glass. The head is light brown thick and frothy like whipped egg white. The body has yeast floating around the red-orange body and looks wonderful. The smell is funky, rye, caramel, light citrus hops, and a powdered drink mix aroma. The taste is syrupy upfront with a bitter hop bite that is followed by a smooth blast of sweetness leaving a bready like quality in the finish. This is a wonderful brew that has alot going on def going to go back to this brew."
"Pours an redish orange with a white head. Smell was good with a nice hop aroma mixed with some fruityness in there. This had a bitter bite with plenty of hop and citrus notes. The rye came through but not as powerful as one would think. A decent balance, the mouthfeel was good, but had plenty of bite and kick to it. A long lingering aftertaste mixed of many flavors. A good offering from founders, but rated lower consider I had this one after trying other founders beers."
"This is the first Founder's beer that I truly loved. Poured from a bottle kept in an igloo cooler about 5 minutes ago. The Head started off very nice, and there is still a nice layer of head on the top. Served in a tankard, just because this is what I always drink Red's with, I like the open top to smell all of the gopodness. Appearence is amazing. mix crimson with burnt umber and you have this beers color. Not a cloudy beer. Head is a light latte color. Aroma is citusy-hoppy. Most likely due to centennial hops, which I believe is used in a lot of Founder's brews. Taste is to die for. Citrusy-hoppy just as the aroma forshadowed. very slight tinge of drynedd that you can only notice if you really look for it. Taste is dominated by hops, but the flavors of rye and toasted malt (?) are present too. Thick and chewy mouthfeel which is very enjoyable. Drinkability is through the roof. I've purchased countless six packs of this beer, and will probably keep buying it untill I die, or untill Founder's goes under, whichever comes first (hopefully me dieing is first because it would be a sad life in MI without Founder's) I suggest going out and getting this beer as soon as possible, not just as single, I'm talking like a kegs worth."
"The drinkability was very good. The beer is full on flavor, but not too heavy of a mouthfeel to make you quit after just one. It'd be pretty easy to down a few of these tasty brews consecutively."
"Great rye aroma & flavor (a really underrated ingredient in beer, imho). I love the rye taste combined with the hops..there are also some definite fruit undertones present as well. The thick malt base holds everything together very well and remind me of carmelized brown sugar. Similar to Terrapin's Rye Pale ale, with a bit more fruit flavor added. For me, I'm not sure you can go wrong throwing hops & rye together..so I really enjoyed this brew from Founders."
"Totally different experience this time with this brew. Got a good bottle this time and there was no ridiculously huge chunkies. Great taste with the rye and hoppy bitterness being in perfect harmony. Good mouthfeel without all the sediment. Highly drinkable as well. Huge jump in rating for me."
"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Nice crimson red color. The carbonation really came on, even while I poured gently. 2 inches off white foam, left crazy lacing, settled to a nice thick chunky coating. Earthy, spicy nose. The rye definitely comes through....spicy crispness. This is a seriously hoppy beer. Bitter, with some sour citrus notes. Clean finish, makes it very appealing. Fairly highly carbonated. Adds to a prickly, spicy mouthfeel backed up by solid malt. This is unique and tasty as hell."
"Drinkability: Much better than what I expected from this beer! If I ever want to be kicked again with spicy hops and rye, I'll make sure to pick up this! Another great treat from Founders!"
"This Founders offering pours a bright brown amber with substantial head that never leaves. Aroma is big and spicy, with some citrusy hops and piney notes as well. Thankfully, you can smell the malt backing for all of those hops. On the palate, this big, smooth beer starts off with exploding bitterness, then shifts to some sourness at the mid palate. The finish and ""burn"" at the end seem like classic rye to me. Overall, this is a wonderful beer that is unique, interesting, and tasty to boot. Very well done."
"D - Very nice drinkability. As far as the rye goes, I am still not that acquainted with the flavor that rye imparts on the beer. I have only had 3 rye beers at the most. I can tell you that this beer and this brewery (after 2 samples - this one and Centenial IPA) kicks ass. Thumbs up to mlh1227!"
"D- My oh my, this is one tasty treat. The rye and hops complement each other well. Paired well with some aged Irish cheddar cheese."
"D: Darn fine. As the last sip goes down, my mouth taste like I've been chewing on grapefruit. Darn fine."
"If it were readily available I could drink this beer day in and day out. Red's Rye reminds me so much of Arrogant bastard. From the fruit-juicy hop sweetness, to bitter, to sweet malt, to a quite pleasant aftertaste this brew is truely world-class. Very under-rated and under-hyped in my opinion."
"This beer manages a crisp yet full mouth. Great session beer! Well done!!!"
"The body has more medium feel then high. Good amount of carbonation that isn't too overpowering, but does assist in the rye/bitterness bite. A very easy beer to drink and the extra bite goes a long way in flavor."
"I got this from a friend at work who said he had gotten it from someone else. So first i just want to say thanks to Mike for giving it to me. This is my first founders beer and i've heard they are reguarded very highly so i was excited to have this. Plus it is my first rye beer. It pours a semi cloudy amber color with a substantial head that doesn't want to go away. Lacing left a sold wall on my glass. The smell was of balanced floral, pine bitterness with solid underlying fruits (apricot, peach, grapefruit). There was some sort of different malt smell too which i guess i can attribute to the rye. The taste was great. It was came as a nice hop explosion up front then simmered into its separate fruit flavors, a slight kick of spice, and then ended with a lingering, semisour hop presence. I can only describe the mouthfeel as very coating. This beer doesn't let you miss much. After a short time this beer was gone and if i had more than one i would have had another. A great beer by founders. I can see why people like them so much"
"I didn't know what I was tasting with this one. Lot's of everything, I guess. Didn't seem very balanced and the hops lingered intensely many minutes after I drank it. Don't get me wrong, this is a real good beer. Almost like a hopped up, double American red, is how it tasted to me. Nice rye, grainy taste, I did enjoy that and some sweet malty caramel and juicy, juicy fruits, were a joy. Just a little unbalanced for a Founder's."
"Thanks, alaskaiscold"
"Drinkability: Versus the style of rye beer, I have to give it high marks for two reasons. I haven't had many rye beers, and this is a very delicious beer, no rough edges or let-down anywhere. Thanks to Tyrawlings for the opportunity."
"A very good hop flavor that leaves a great mouthfeel paired with the rye component. Seems to ease the bitterness on the finish slightly but not overly so. Could seriously drink this beer all night. A decent complexity of all the ingredients although a little more rye could have been deserved but not necessarily needed."
"A nice drinkable rye brew. I like it and will pick up a sixer the next time I am in the store."
"good drinkability, and a very solid IPA, the more rye beers i try the more i like rye beers."
"Verdict: A rich, roasty, solid brew. Excellent."
"A fantastic American Rye beer. I know it's 6.8%, but I could drink this all day long. More please."
"This beer poured an amber with dark sediment and a large head. It had a nice hop bite to it with a caramelly characted from the rye. It is pretty tasty, definitely. I still prefer Sixpoint Righteous Rye on tap at my local, but this is a very drinkable and tasty beer."
"Founders has to be one of the best at producing beer that smell and taste so good you forget about the alcohol. Red, opaque with lots of floaties. This rye is rich, silky, malty, caramel and hoppy and oh so drinkable. If this was available in California I would drink this on a regular basis. This is a rock solid red."
"Very yummy in my tummy. Always good to have on hand."
"All kinds of fresh juicy flavor. I finally controlled the head on this one. A complex, crisp, cirtusy, crimson creation with character!"
"Mahogany color, very cloudy with subtle carbonation. The wispy 1/2 inch of foam is light tan with nice retention. Good lacing. The smell is strong and pleasant, with a nose of robust floral hops, light caramel malt and mild alcohol. The taste is not very sweet, strong on hops and finishes with a bready finish and a hint of rye. Slightly sour overall, moderately bitter, but not overpowering on any level. Full body, somewhat thick with a nice coating ability and good smoothness. I definitely liked it, but I don't see it being a great session beer for some reason. I'm glad it made the 1800 mile trip down here though, and I will have another one soon..."
"Man, I could drink this all day. Too bad it's 7%, or I would!"
"Drinkability: I felt this was a remarkable first venture into the ""Rye"" beer category, score another win for Founders and me!!!"
"Poured from a 12oz brown bottle with no date into an imperial pint glass. An off white rocky head just explodes immediately from the initial pour. It takes several attempts to pour most of the bottle into my glass while trying to leave the majority of the sediment in the bottle. Lots of hop particles and other matter are bottled along for the ride. A deep, hazy, copper body that emits a very floral, resiny perfume with grapefruit aromas. Slightly spicy too. Lace just clump on the side of my glass as I drink. The hops are mainly the focus in the body. Citrus and spicy. Not sure if the spicy part is the hops or the rye but the mouth feel is medium. Finishes somewhat soft with lingering bitterness. A great drinker and fairly complex."
"Notes from a fresh bottle obtained in a trade. I've also had this one on tap several times in Boston and in Grand Rapids and it doesnt dissapoint. This one is a dark amber colour with a dishwater coloured head that lasts for a while. Aromas are all fresh, floral hops and a nice malty edge with hints of rye to round it out in the background. The taste is hoppy as all get out in typical founders style, I do find them a bit one dimensional in their hop profiles just like FFF, but with beers this good...who cares! The rye is their too and it swirls together with a nice light caramel-like malt flavor. This one is pretty resiny as well providing the end user with nice hop burps. Mouthfeel is slightly abrasive in a good palate smacking way and drinkability is way up there."
"-UF"
"Divine offering from Founders. Will they ever expand down South?"
"I love this beer. Great flavors that are big but still easy to drink."
"carbonation is a bit high, but the hoppiness balances out well. this would be great sessional beer. many thanks norhtertimber"
"An excelent beer, probably the best red I've had yet. Tough to come by though as we dont get Founders here in Rochester. I'll have to keep an eye out for it when I travel."
"not what i had hoped for given my afinity for the black one"
"A good hoppy beer, but I was hoping the rye would be more prominant."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" tan head above the slightly cloudy red brew. Foamy head lasts well, with heavy lacing. Aroma is light dark fruit, but dominated by piney hoppiness. Taste reflects the nose almost exactly, but with some alcohol warming in the close. Mouthfeel is extra smooth from the rye, and drinkability is good as well. All around enjoyable brew."
"The rye makes for a good dry taste, and malt adds a roundness to the flavor. Rye notes and hops balance the maltiness perfectly. Very bright, sparkly mouthfeel, and yet a smooth drinking beer."
"A very drinkable beer for those who like them dry and hoppy. Nothing at all is bad about this beer, the only thing that would prevent sessioning all night is the above 5% alcohol level. A very mellow beer I can recommend."
"Wow, WOW. I had know idea what to expect from this beer. I picked it out randomly believe it or not, cause I had never seen it before. It sat in my fridge for over a month before I finally tried it. I was nervous as I had never had a ""rye"" beer. This beer goes down like cool-aid. Its got a smooth but very flavorful sweet taste. Its like a tamed down IPA but packed full with taste. This is my favorite beer so far."
"This beer is easy to drink, and the complexity keeps you sipping and smiling."
"taste disappoints slightly from the beautiful appearance and aroma. malty flavors with a gently bitter aftertaste. hints of the citrus flavors from the aroma in the aftertaste as well. overall, far more pedestrian that the pour and aroma would indicate."
"Drinkability- If the alcohol contentwasn't so high this could be a good regular drinking beer. Or session beer, but other than that a good pint after pint beer."
"What a great beer! Why did I only get a six pack? I shouldn't have shared so much."
"All in all a decent and unsual beer. The more I drink of it the more I like it."
"The taste has a sharp hoppiness to it that carries through almost to the end, but actually mellows and becomes a lingering, smooth, sweet citrus note and a bright bitterness. This is definitely hop dominated, but there is a malt character here, which, through its caramel notes, helps to accentuate the fruity citrus character of the hops. As the beer warms up it begins to pick up some minty menthol like notes in the finish. I can't say that the rye is really noticeable here; perhaps it adds a bit to the body of the beer and it seems to make it have a head with more staying power. As with many of the so called ""rye"" beers this is a hop bomb; don't get me wrong, I definitely am enjoying this beer, but I am curious as to what the rye is really adding."
"Great beer! Share with friends or try one for yourself...also a big thanks to warriorsoul for getting this brew to me! First time for this style as well."
"Very very good. I'd love to have this on tap. It's probably extraordinary."
"The balance makes this emminently drinkable and hides the 6.8 ABV. This is easily the best beer in two ale styles (rye and red) that I've ever had. Kudos to Founders for a wonderful beer!"
"Damn drinkable. When all is said in done the warmth of the alcohol, the hop profile/bitterness, and spiciness of the rye all come together and creates one hell of a tasty beer. I do really like this beer but I cant help but think it could be better. More malt and more rye would really soup-up this beer. Still, I would jump at the chance to drink this one again. My sample was provided by BuckeyeNation. Thank you it was damn yummy!"
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a full bodied chewyness about it. Very drinkable I could pound these back all night."
"Copper-orange appearance. The head is initially nice, off-white, but quickly resumes to cover. Appealing rye, cookies and raisin nose contain a strong multi-hopped facet reminiscent of smoky/earthy centennial. Bitterness comes out quite heavy. Bready and earthy profile, nicely leafy and woody toward the finish, but citric all the way. Medium bodied, slight creaminess, smooth overall feel. Good stuff."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability was smooth. Very delicious beer."
"This is a superbly drinkable brew."
"Very hazy auburn with small chunks even with a careful pour. I like my beers chunky, so it gets bonus points for that. The head is very large, stays and laces, but is just a little too foamy. Smell is dark caramel with American fruity hops. Reminds me of SNCA. Bready flavor with citric sizzle and solid bitterness that ends with that ""twang"" of rye. Cocoa too. Medium body is nice and soft on the tongue. Dry finish makes for easy drinking, easier than I usually find this combo of flavors to be. This is a nice beer, but this damn combo of fruity hops and toasted malt just does not work! Two great flavors that just don't belong together. Good beer, but not all that special. The rye doesn't make as much difference as all us beer geeks would like to believe."
"A beautiful red coloring gives a nice off white head that gives up some nice lacing too. It smells of sweet caramel deep cooked caramel malts with a playful hops citrus and floral aorma. A good wheat flavor covered with the slight apples spice of rye meeting the sweetness of the long boiled malts. The citrus hops cut straight though the blend of maltyness and add a great balance to the flavor. Lovely mouthfeel and pretty drinkable as in I wish I had more."
"Drinkability: All around a tasty and good beer. Sweeter and hoppier than I expected but they match well. Nice hop flavor without being painfully bitter."
"Yeah buddy. Good suds. Poured out to a medium red color with a nice off-orange head. Rings of lace were present and dense. Nice. Aromas of hops, floral notes, sourness and some malt made the mouth water in anticipation of what was to come. Taste was solid and full; flavors of cooked malts, strong hops and bread notes fused together in beer bliss. A medium bodied mouthfeel fit this brew well. A good level of drinkability, I could have this on a regular basis and enjoy the hell out of it every time. Recommended. Special Thanks to sopor for the sample."
"The flavor opens with pale and crystal malt flavor, softer and a bit grainier with the rye, hops right on it's heels. Initially a citrusy orange and lemon feel, moving into a less gentle grapefruity finish. The hopping is quite bold, especially for a red ale. Malt flavor is somewhat blurred and lost beneath the hop attack, but maintains a mild caramelized sweetness. A bit of yeasty doughiness. Some flowery bitters, especially in the aftertaste. Fairly full bodied, with a modest carbonation level. Goes down damn smooth. The alcohol is a bit higher than I'd like for a ""drinkin' beer", but it's a good brew for a short, hoppy session. Just what I'd expect from these folks."
"Pours out the color of a penny that's aged a bit - dark copper with some ruddy highlights. Head rises a bit to orangey peaks, and then disappears. Aroma is invitingly hoppy, with slight nuances of understated sweet fruits mixed in with malty sweetness. Flavor is initially hoppy, with some bitter pine and tangy grapefruit hints. Finishes crisp, with a lingering aftertaste that smacks of fresh tingly grapefruit. Another tasty beer sent my way from BuckeyeNation."
"Pours from the bottle a vibrant yet hazy reddish amber; hops emanate in the aroma, with a touch of sweet, biscuity malt. Very well balanced, malty and dry initially with a touch of sweetness to balance the mildly bitter hoppy finish. Cracker like biscuit flavors add to the dry mouthfeel, and herbal seedy rye bread is detectable as well. One of the few rye beers I've had that balances the rye malt and hops so nicely. Sweet malt 'twang, dry hop finish. Oh yeah. Founders does it again. Please please pleeease start distributing in PA. Every beer I've had the pleasure of sampling from this fine brewery is stellar."
"Palate- big flavor, but with a very nice dry quality. A bit of a bitter bite on the finish. It's velvety and mouthfilling, and the flavors rouse when you swish it around. I taste cedar, mineral, brandy, and maybe a hint of sherry sweetness. There is just the faintest note of raisins or prunes lurking in the long finish."
"Pours an attractive, cloudy, dark amber with a finger of khaki head and some lacing. Smell is quite floral and hoppy, some bitter rye, and light fruit. Tastes like a sweet, bitter IPA mixed with a scotch ale. Floral hops up front, some sweet malt, and citrus rounding it out. Mouthfeel is rich like Dirty Bastard, which this also reminds me of. This was pretty tasty, not as much rye as I would have guessed, which was nice cuz I really don't like rye so much. A hoppy, sweet, tasty brew. Founder's you never disappoint me."
"The appearance is a dark brick with an off-white head that falls to a tall ring surrounded by lace. Smell is malty rye with hop notes, very inviting. The taste is cracked black pepper, citric acid, and fizzy carbonation. The rye shines through along with the hops. Mouthfeel is medium and at times feels full. Very nice for either a red ale or a rye beer. Easy to drink. Pushing 7% ABV, I'd recommend pairing this with some munchies, like a buttery cheese to keep it all in perspective."
"Red's Rye and Black Rye are nothing like each other."
"yet another solid offering from Founders...Michigan breweries rule"
"Moderate body, very pleasurable with delicate and almost refreshing carbonation. Not a session brew, too big, but very tasty. I like this beer a lot!"
"overall: what can i say? i like it. a lot. very tasty brew. a lot like an apa but with a delicious spicy rye kick. easy session brew. i received this in a trade, and i wish i had a lot more."
"Drinkability -- Very drinkable indeed. I'm going to plug this one to my friends. I'll most likely pick this one up on a regular basis."
"This is my first rye beer and I like this style. Yet another fine offering from the folks at Founders. I have yet to be disappointed by one of their brews. Keep up the great work!!!"
"This is my first beer from Founders, and I'm quite impressed."
"A pretty serious beer, definitely not a session beer, but at this point of the night its disguising itself as something different. I really dig this beer. Characteristics abound in this one. Get it if you can."
"Beautiful amber red, a bit hazy with a very nice head that maintains til the end leaving clumps all along the way. Smells of massive hops and i've baked a few rye loaves in the past, definitely smells of rye. Up front are bready malts on the tongue and then citrusy hops intermingle with the rye all across the palate. The rye flavor is quite pronounced and excellent. Very bready too, just like a big hunk of rye (no caraway seeds!). Very very nice. Ends very dry with hops and spiciness slowly fading away. I love this beer. Mouthfeel is quite full with low to moderate carbonation. This is highly drinkable."
"My only real knock on this beer is my main knock with many of these lighter summer offerings, lack of depth. But the beer is good for what it is. No complaints. A quality summer style quaffer."
"The mouthfeel is a bit odd. Very thick, chewy, and grainy, but still seems to be plenty light and refreshing. I only wish this beer were available here in Iowa, because I would drink the crap out of it."
"All american hops. Pungant and resiny. Clear copper/red with tan head and fab lacing. Big hop flavor with rye spicyness. Caramel, and good bitterness. Quite dry and refreshing. My first founders beer every. Pretty happy so far."
"I downed three bottles of this stuff with ease, this beer is fantastic!"
"Founder's needs to find a way into the Nebraska market."
"Pints, yes S, at Come Back Inn in Madison, WI at the Pre-Great Taste Founders Party."
"Taste: Nice and creamy in the mouth, with that characteristic rye bite. This is the best (commercial) example of a highly-hopped rye beer I've had. Wonderful mixture of sweet malts, slightly spicy and stalky rye, and the perfect blend of juicy hops to dry things out nicely in the end. Excellent beer."
"Pours a beautiful blood red color with a creamy reddish-white head. The aroma is huge. It hits you the second you open the bottle, and never leaves. Citric hops and complex malt tones battle it out to perfection. The taste is hoppy with a strong malt backbone. It's almost like a good IPA, but with rye. The mouthfeel is medium-thick bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is an awesome brew. I can not conceive how this beer could be made any better than it already is."
"Drinkability on this great beer is great! This one is going to have some staying power in my fridge."
"I love rye beers. So unique. I always see good reviews of this on here and I've never been able to find it until last night, on the bottle list at the Sunset Grill and Tap in Allston. Nice amber color, murkier than average, with a huge bright white rocky head that sticks around for a while and leaves excellent lacing on the glass. We're talkin a ring after every sip here. I like it. Spicy hops, spicy rye smell. Taste is just perfect with the rye. Like a nice well balanced, though hoppy red ale, but with the added complexity of rye. I can't get enough of that rye taste in beers, and I really think every brewery should release a beer in this classic style. There really aren't that many that I can think of. It really adds a lot, though it's so simple, to what would otherwise be your average ale. If you haven't had a beer brewed with rye before, or you haven't had this particular beer, I definately urge you to go seek it out. Their black rye is just as good, if not better. Cheers."
"Honestly, I've never had a rye beer before, so I didn't know what to expect. I doubt they're all this good!"
"Very drinkable. Get this if you can."
"Mouthfeel is fairly full bodied, and finishes dry. Drinkability is okay, a bit unblanced which detracts from its drinkability. I'd just like to see some more malt character."
"Drinkability: Man, what a great beer! Probably more geared towards the hop heads but this grain base and aftertaste just really round out the experience. I have to admit, whenever I see ""rye beer"" I think of some nastly ol' dry rye toast. However, both renditions from Founders (red and black) have truly been an enjoyable experience. Seek out and enjoy. Outstanding for sure!"
"[Many thanks to TikkiGodxxx for including this one in the trade - this is an outstanding brew!]"
"This beer poured a deep red/amber color with a light tan head about an inch high. The smell was mostly hops with a hint of pine. The taste was supprisingly bitter. There seems to be a significant amount of hop addition to beginning stage of this beers creation. They are very noticable in the flavor and more subtle in the aroma. The taste is great. There is also some malty sweetness with a crisp alcohol finish. Moderate carbonation and full body. This is a very drinkable beer. I should have bought the lot. I highly recommend it."
"Drinkability- Right up there with Hop Rod Rye in my book. Another fine beer to add to the ""session"" list. Damn, that's right...I can't get this on the west coast :( Thanks much Jetsbeer!"
"Very nice reddish to orange color. Reminds me of a burning sunset. Nice aroma-quite floral and a nice soft hoppiness to it. Bitter flavor upfront. I dont get the rye really. I think the bitterness could be toned down a touch and maybe bring the crispness of the rye thru a little more. Good body. Overall a drinkable beer. Considering the bitterness it was actually quite refreshing. Worth a shot. Thanks to crjmellor for the sample."
"This beer poured a somewhat murky reddish-copper color, with a light head. Not totally opaque, and the carbonation to glass bottom is easily observed. It has a deep malty aroma, with heavy hints of citrus--almost like grapefruit. Also present is a tinge of caramel or chocolate. Tastewise, it has a malty, full-bodied flavor with a bit of a rye kick for a pleasant aftertaste. There are definite citrus flavors as well. Red's Rye is full, but smooth, and surprisingly easy to swallow, despite its being so sharp going down. Overall, I would say that this is a beer that is eminently enjoyable, but only when sipped slowly in order to understand its true complexity. Definitely worth drinking again and again...."
"Pours a brilliantly clear ruby color with a nice tan head of tight creamy bubbles that produce beautiful lacing right down to the bottom of the glass. Malty sweet smell with some caramel overtones followed by a citrus-like hops aroma. This medium bodied ale's flavor profile is dominated by a citrus hops flavor and bitterness, but with enough of a caramel-like malt sweetness to back up all that hops. Also some spicy notes probably from the use of rye as well as from the hops. Not typical of a lot of rye beers, but quite refreshing and enjoyable."
"Slippery, yet set with a bold rich intensity in a medium body feel with very controlled toasty tones and heavy hop handedness. Fluffy textured with hops, smooth, warm, and toasty. Oh...and damn yummy! Another fine addition to the Founders family. Unbelievably delicious and drinakable. Enjoy."
"(If I were rating the bottled version, it would still be 4-plus; but if you can get this on tap, do it!!)"
"Rye, eh? Wasnt fond of it, but never had the style before, so a straight-forward review is in order. Started with a hazy, murky brown/red pour with tan head. Not bad at all. Aroma was floral and hoppy, which came thru on the taste along with some citrus and, I guess, rye. Full bodied, rich, and carbonated. Too bitter & sour for my tastes, but I read this is the characteristics of the style."
"Pours a five-finger light tan head that fades quickly leaving a good lace. Clear red/amber color. Hoppy/malty nose. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Starts hoppy and the hops dominate and leave a lingering bitter aftertaste. Expecting something a little more mellow. $1.75 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, Ma."
"Mouthfeel was quite good for the style, although there was a little room for improvement. Overall I liked this beer, it was a good one."
"My first Founder's, to cherish. I like rye, and combined with a hopped up beer, you got a bold satisfying beer. Rye, full citrus mouthfeel and some lovely bitter aftertaste. Genuine red colour, head with initial hop bubbles. I would drink this on a regular basis. Delicious 3 weeks later."
"Very nice mouthfeel due to moderate carbonation that does not over-emphasize the hops. Very drinkable for its strength and hop level, though the sweetness on the death gets to me after a couple. Another very good offering from Founder's, though I prefer the Black Rye."
"Drinkability and Notes  Slides down easy, really fantastic beer. The only other rye beer I have had is the Black Rye, the two beers are as different as night and day. The Black Rye is a better showcase for the flavor of rye, but this beer is far superior in taste and drinkability. A definite must buy for anyone, a new favorite for me."
"overall- ive seen this in local stores for quite sometime but just decided to try it out and im glad i did. sticks out from any other brew ive had. i cant wait to try the black rye"
"A very easy and refreshing beer to drink. Nice and crisp and not overpowering with any one flavor or with the alcohol."
"Pours a nice amber color with a tall head that has decent retention and leaves nice lacing on the glass. The aroma is very hoppy - citrus hops. I didn't get much rye in the nose, but there was a lot of hop there to cover it up. The flavor was very nice. Lots of hop flavors with a strong rye and caramel backing. Very smooth. Moderate body and great drinkability. Nice."
"Edit: This beer is much better on tap than in the bottle. Bottled review is forthcoming."
"Moderately thick, foamy, dark cream colored head leaves strings of lace as it slowly fades. An almost hazy, ruby tea colored beer. Solid citrusy grapefruit hop aroma. Fairly sweet malty flavor up tastes like a red ale and rye. It's quickly joined by some chewy grapefruity hops that become mildly bitter towards the end. A tasty hopped up red ale. Thanks to Malty for this crazy bottle."
"the whole experience is good for a few sips, then settles into an average bitterness. good overall, unique for the style but average for a hoppy ale."
"Slàinte!"
"Very drinkable. This stuff could get me in trouble."
"From notes. Poured a deep amber color, almost rusty, with a small head that sat nicely atop the beer. The nose was very nice, with a definate blast of rye spiceyness and a citrusy hop with a nice thick caramel base underneath. The flavor was complex, with an almost rye-bready flavor with caramel and grapefruity hop. Everything was balanced very well. The feel was moderate with a moderate carbonation. Maybe a touch more thickness would do it good. Overall, a damn fine beer. I liked it enough to have it off tap twice since the first bottle. The flavor balance was just divine. It was smooth and refreshing. I would like to keep a keg of it around in the summer."
"12 oz. brown bottle with no freshness date."
"Wow. Tried this at the Michigan Brewers Cup last weekend at Copper Canyon. The beer was a deep saturated red color with a beige head. The aroma was caramel and fresh hops. Sweet balancing the spice and flower of the hop and the fruitiness of the yeast. Great malt/bitterness balance keeping the moderate alcohol completely hidden. Good creamy mouthfeel, I could have had this as my desert, but the turtle cheesecake was too tempting. This is an excellent beer, I wish I hadnt waited so long to try this."
"Firts of many Founders brews Iam gonna partake in over the next few days,pours a deep amver with a nice fluffy two finger head leaving a nice sheet of lace behind.Hops,hops and more cirus,piney hop with a little lemon wedge in there made me wanna tear into this one,I am almost at a lack of words on the flavors and refreshing complexities of this beer,spruce and piney hop with a nice firm nutty malt backbone finishing with a perfect tartness wich just caps this off making for the almost perfect rounded beer.Damn why did I pass this up in the past I will be bringing this home with me back to NC for sure."
"Prosit!"
"Smell and taste are apple cider-ish musty malt but musty in a good way. Exceptional in fact. Yes, you can also taste but not smell the rye elements. This dances on the tongue and is still smooth as far as mf and drinkability are concerned."
"After having this on tap at the brewpub I had to pick up a six of it. Now that I only have one bottle left I wish I would have got a case, damn this is some tasty stuff. Dark reddish color with a decent tan head. Rings of lacing were left by the floating mound of foam that remained. Quit a hoppy nose with citric and some floral hops jumping out with a nice crisp rye undertone. Light sweet caramel maltiness is there as well. Hops and rye are quite an appetizing combination. Flavor is similar with a nice hop bite to start is off. Plenty of rye and malt to balance out the bitterness. Light caramel, grapefruit and a bit of pine hops all blend together nicely over the rye. Bitter hoppy rye finish. Damn this is some tasty and smooth stuff. Really creamy medium body. Goes down oh so smooth with a light prickliness from the hops. This would be a staple in the fridge if I could get it locally. Almost like a Hop Rod Rye junior. Great stuff."
"Completely gratifying pour with a wonderful medium body to it, perhaps imparted by the rye? What does the rye do? Time to try the black rye!"
"I haven't yet sampled all of Founders's offerings, but I'd be amazed to discover one that I like as well as Red's Rye. It's easily the equal of Bear Republic's Hop Rod Rye, if not quite as assertive. An insanely hopped ale spiced with rye is the stuff of my beery dreams and I wish to thank Founders for making those dreams come true. And deejaydan, without whom this would not have been possible."
"Pours a beautiful clear deep amber color with plenty of depth. A rocky head crops up, which leaves sticky lacing as this brew is greedily imbibed. The aroma is absolutely knockout. Huge floral esters massage the nostrils before sublimely bitter hops assuage any inhibitions. Flavor begins smooth, with some sweet malts. Rye kicks in with an interesting grainy spiciness before the pure citrous hop oils sink into your brain. Finish is citric hops with a calming herbal quality. Never had a rye beer before, but I need to try out a few more after this one. I was really surprised in a pleasant way."
"Appearance of this beer was deep brown leather with hints of orange and red pearing through. The head left nice lacing down my chalice. There was a decent amount of yeast and other remnants of what I assume to be leftover from dryhopping. THe smell had a wonderful hop punch that left you salivating for a taste. There was definate citrusy notes in the nose. The taste was supremely balanced with a bitter beginning and a dryness in the finish. The rye seemed to have add it's two cents in the finish with the grainy dryness. The bitterness was exceptionally present, but was not as heavy as a IIPA. Overall, this is stuff you could drink all night and love every once of it. I foresee Founder's coming out with some phenomenal beers to add to their already fabulous line (i.e. Centennial IPA and Breakfast stout)"
"D- Nice twist on a red ale. The rye is very subtle but it gives some balance to the nice hoppiness of the beer. The hops have good complexity and taste very crisp and clean."
"This beer has a cloudy, dark amber appearance. Citrus hop aroma, along with a smell that is like freshly cut wood. Spicy smell too. The flavor starts with a sweet malt presence, then becomes tangy. This is followed by a dose of fresh hops, and finished with a tangy fruit flavor and spice. This beer makes fantastic use of different flavors. It is somehow both full flavored and crisp. Great drinkability. I'll definitely buy this again."
"This dry-hopped red ale is easy drinking and produces a hearty satisfying belch of hop delight. Special thanks to cmaruschak."
"Drinkability is great a wonderful beer easy drinkingmalt and hops both going for it.Founders is my new favorite brewery wish I could buy locally, this stuff is great. Wish to think merlin48 for this wonderful beer."
"I liked this beer quite a bit and am impatiently awaiting the chance to try other offerings from Founders."
"I'm also having a glass of Scott's Selection Royal Brackla from 1976 and it goes very well with an ale like this. And thanks again to John at Federal Wines & Spirits for hooking me up with another bottle of good beer. Cheers."
"Great job Founders...they are simply awesome!"
"Mouthfeel is nice and creamy with a medium body...good medium carbonation. Easy to drink. I wish I had a sixer of this stuff as I could enjoy a few more right now. A damn fine beer....I think more brewers should experiment with rye. Cheers to Founders...I look forward to drinking this one again soon!"
"I actually enjoyed this more from the bottle. I'm guessing the pint glass I drank this beer from at Founder's could have been a bit dirty (?). I'm definitley going to visit the brewery and have another sit-down with this great beer. Most definitley not a shy beer!"
"This beer went straight to my brain, don't know would want more than a couple in a sitting. But a real treat that I will meet again."
"much thanks to micro for the bottle!"
"The mouthfeel is oily and substantial like I expected, refreshing and sticky at once. This beer seems incredibly fresh and delicious, and as poorly handled as the beers in this area are, its probably downright heavenly fresh or, preferably, from their home."
"Thanks to JahNoth for this excellent beer!"
"Overall, quite a satisfying experience. Founders continues to impress, and I look forward to the rest of their selection."
"This is one hell of an offering. Amazing flavors and overall character! Love it."
"Tastes are hoppy and raw. Grassy chlorophyll and weed flavours are thick. The hop character seems to work very well with the rye to deliver this unique flavourscape. Those with truly discerning palates can taste the greatness here. There is a pronounced bitter effect from both the hops and the rye infusion. Synergy. This tight little brew is crisp and snappy. Flavour like none other. Drinking this brew before trying another less fortunate beer will cripple your ability to taste the inferior brew. This is robust and utterly friggin awesome. If you can handle something of this magnitude you will no doubt fall in love with it. Drinkable for sure. Pussy ass posers beware, this one will bite back atcha ass. By far the most kick ass ""mainstay"" offered by this brewery. This beer is outdone by precious few from other companies. Stellar."
"This is a very tasty and drinkable beer. It lacks the presence of rye I was looking for in both taste and aroma, unlike the Black Rye, but its still damn tasty."
"This beer is part west coast ipa and part rye beer. For the most part, the rye plays a subsurviant role. The dominat player in Red's Rye is hops. At times, the hops over run this beer, but I still thirst for more. I would be negligent, if I didn't write about the head. Red's gives you a root beer float head. It stands above the top of the glass, but does not cascade down the sides. This RyePA is not to be missed."
"Pours a deep, glowing ruby red color with a huge frothy off white head that leave a thick sticky lacing in my glass. Aromatic hoppy aromas of pineapple, grapefruit and pine. Resiny pine, citrus and pineapple cake flavors, medium bodied with a creamy mouthfeel, finishes bitter and dry. I think I may have found a new favorite from this brewery, this one is very drinkable at 6.8%."
"Since an amber ale with rye is a fairly de rigueur recipe for homebrewers, especially a certain famous ""Denny"" recipe, this beer suffers in comparison. So many people have done this on a non-commercial level, many with great success, that I'll be heretical in calling this no better than those. A straight line of caramel, rye spiciness, then hop balance. Has the pepper but not quite the oiliness and calvados-like notes that rye can impart. The brick of caramel also tames the rye as well as the purported 60 IBU's. In all, not terribly different from the brewpub amber ale craze of many years back but a little funkified to interest the beer enthusiast."
"Overall, I was highly impressed with this beer. It has a lot of great traits, and is definitly worth going out of your way to try. I'm sure it will show up on my shopping list again very soon."
"Dulled scarlet red appearance. Thin off-white head that leaves bountiful lace. The aroma is a tropical fruit melange. Pineapple, kiwi, mango... And some of that resiny canabis in the background. The taste follows suit to an extent. You've got your tropical fruit blend. Some Mary Jane. But also some sweet marmalade like tones. The bitterness is sharp, yet clean. And there's a dulled spiciness present that is a contribution from the rye rather than alcohol I believe. Another solid offering from Founder's. And another solid Founder's offering received thanks to cokes."
"This is an amazing brew and has definitely replaced Two-Hearted as my Michigan 'IPA' of choice. As beautiful out of the bottle as it is on tap. An infinitely more drinkable version of it's big brother, Devil Dancer. So smooth and smarmy, and now available year-round, this is my new ""go-to"" brew. Sexy stuff guys. Highly, highly recommended!"
"Mouthfeel is almost hefty but not thick, has some texture to it. Not quite up there with a DIPA but it tends in that direction. Thanks to trbeer for sharing this one."
"Representin' to tha fullest."
"Drinkability - delicious! Bring me more!! A top-notch session beer, packed with flavor from the wonderful folks of Founders."
"My experience with rye beers is limited to various examples from Bavaria. I can't see how actual rye might have influenced the flavors of this beer in the slightest way -- it would be obliterated by caramel malt and hops. Yet as for the brand name, ""rye"" has so many poetic possibilities (wry Red's rye... and so on) not to mention the fact that there is not so much competition in the Rye Beer category."
"This beer pours a nicely carbonated crimson color. A dirty tan head form and leaves a nice lacing on the side of the glass. The smell of this brew is great. Citrus and pine all the way, a very noticable northwestern hop profile. The taste is very piney, as to be expected from the smell. Some caramel peaks through and tries to add some balance. The rye is definitely present giving the ever famous rye taste and mouthfeel. Overall a fantastic beer. Glad I saw this stuff here in Miltown last week, knowing I dont have to go to Madison for this stuff brings a smile to my face. Simply put a fantastic beer. Much thanks to Skidz for the sample."
" Aroma is a hit as soon as the bottle is opened, citric hop. That citric is carried over to the taste along with pine, grapefruit and a good dose of rye malt. The mouthfeel reflects the blast of hop while leaving a hop oil feel. Drinkability is good for its crisp, near red IPA can get."
"Huge thanks to Skidz for this brew."
"Crisp and refreshing in the mouth. Nice, lively carbonation in a medium body. Well done, Founders. You had me at ""Centennial."" I could drink this beer all day and all night. I absolutely adore the blend of citrusy hops and light rye flavor. This beer, along with it's Founders bretheren will find their way into my fridge on a frequent basis....oh baby."
"According to their website, this brewery's motto is ""Ignore Mainstream"" and ""Push The Envelope"". I'm getting alarmed about the three bottles of Devil Dancer I bought the same day as this rye ale. This one pours a cloudy, copper body with a small beige head that quickly falls into ring and film. Nice spiderweb lacing is left on the glass. Aroma has a ton of hops, a strong note of spicy rye, and a hint of caramel malt. Hops are pine, grapefruit, and hemp. Mouthfeel has a medium body, moderate carbonation and a coating of pine resin hops. Taste is lots of hops and a hint of rye. Caramel malt is difficult to appreciate underneath the massive hopping. This one goes down really easy, and the aftertaste is not as biting as I feared. I am very fond of rye malt in beers, and this one is no exception. The hops are allowed to romp around all over the malts here, but I just happen to be in a hoppy mood as I finish this one off. Not quite ready for their Devil Dancer, though. Impressive brewery and a bold rendering of a rye ale here."
"from the bottle, poured crimson red with a nice fluffy light tan head aroma a nose full of hops, malts, grapefruits, hints of caramel, molasses. the hops were not as strong as the aroma which was good, nice mouth feel has a pleasant bitterness to it, grapefruit. do not know what malted rye taste like but there is a flavor in here that I like so maybe that is it. good beer."
"This one pours out to a dark amber in the glass with a slight to medium head. The aroma is that of pine and citrus. The taste is excellent, with said pine coming through via the hop presence this one has. Great malt backbone as well. As someone else mentioned, this reminded me of a west coast beer, and reminded me of offerings from Stone and Sierra Nevada. Very reminiscent of a Pale Ale cruising toward IPA-territory with hints of spice and pepper."
"This beer looked exactly like the Imperial IPA from Founder's on the pour. Crimson red in color with a one inch tan head that had good retention. Smell is very bready and somewhat sweet. The taste was sweet upfront with a caramel flavor, the top has a rye base to it and was quite thick, the finish was hoppy but not really bitter. Quite a thick and complex beer with some bold flavors but not overly sweet or bitter. A good beer to try at Founders but there are better choices at their brewery."
"Drinkability is pretty high, could definitely be comfortable with a few of these in a row."
