"O: To just call this summer rye is a bit misleading. It's really more of a well-hopped Belgian table beer. I'd push that angle more than the rye angle. A lot of people feel that rye is coarse and a bit less approachable than other grains, so to put that in people's minds first is a mistake in my opinion. They should also play up the fact that it is a beer of true session abv. Get that right on the label somewhere, it's a big selling point these days. At any rate this is a pleasant and crushable little beer that would be equally at home pairing in the early stages of a fancy multi-course meal as it would in your hand after a hot day of lawn mowing. Perfect pairing partner for almost any light salad, ceviche, or other such things."

"an insanely pale beer, almost white in color, looking more like a Berliner than anything else, hazy and yellow, like its all wheat, but there is some substantial rye under the lace airy white head. nose shows some mild spice and plenty of malt heft for its color, and the flavor agrees. spicy from the rye, cracked white pepper earthiness and a dried fruit aspect as well. some wheat in here too though, there has to be. carbonation and body are both up for how light it is, and the rye is the dominant flavor, although not out of balance. I may prefer a moderately larger hop plan for this thing, give it a finish, but I must admit this is extremely unique as a session beer with the hops so mellow. its refreshing but a little filling I found, but still appropriate in hot weather. I like how pale it is, lets the rye show though really brilliantly. my first mayflower beer has me keen for more from them, and that's always a good sign. on tap at the farmhouse burlington"

"Overall: Overall I am really impressed with this beer as an all around summer session ale that is light bodied, crisp and slightly sour mouthfeel makes a beer that is worth bringing to your next cook out or gathering to share with all or just for yourself and significant other at the beach. If you are looking for an alternative to your usual summer wheat beer you should check this one out if you get the opportunity to get your hands on some."

"Overall: an refreshing summer ale. The carbonation and hoppy finish bolster the overall taste. It's a low ABV beer, but it has a lot of character."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is great stuff in my opinion. Definitely stands out from the deluge of goldens and wheat ales that hit the market for summer. Refreshing and delicious."
""
""
""
"The taste brings out the rye grains at first with a notable lemon and floral hop character on the backside. Slightly tart ending. Not high on my list of Mayflower brews but it would be good in the summer."

"O - I bought a 6-pack as an impulse buy and I'm glad I did. I've now had three of these beers with the third coming straight from the bottle. This third was my favorite thus far, as I honestly am not a big fan of the color of the beer, and somehow the hop character shines through better directly from the bottle. It's relatively expensive, so I wouldn't buy it for myself, but I might bring it to the next BBQ I attend. It really is a nice summer beer."
""
"Tried it as a cask conditioned offering. Definitely improved the flavor. The scores reflect a blending of the two tastes."

"D - A good beer, overall. I didn't realize it was only 3.8% abv when I bought it, but I would buy this again. Perhaps it's a little overpriced, but Mayflower is still a young brewery with relatively small levels of scale economies, so that is understandable. This is an example of an ideal beer I'd love to drink pitchers of after reaching the top of a mountain on a hike in New England. Or in a large field on a picnic. It's that type of beer. I am quite enjoying it, actually."

"Picked it up on a trip to visit my parents near Buzzards Bay. Pours more like a pilsner--a pale gold with a thin white head. Bit of a surprise condiering it is a rye beer. I smell just the slightest hint of rye. Light malt base with the rye more of a feel on the palate than overly powerful flavors. Nice balance between the rye, the other malts and some spriggy hops. Nice session beer for a hot and muggy July day."
""
""
"Overall, this had promise to be a good beverage, as the rye flavors are out in front and potent, but there simply weren’t enough other flavors in here, even considering that it’s a summer ale. The watery taste and mouthfeel seem to evidence that the brew could have used a few more handfuls of malt and hops, the former being especially important in providing a better sugary backbone."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is great- great summer beer cause it's so refreshing. Incredibly light and well carbonated. Wouldn't get it again but if you like low alcohol beers this one is very flavorful."
""
""
"Cheers"
""
"For keeping this almost alcohol-free, it's a good beer. It's not going to replace Bitter Brewer as my hot afternnoon beer of choice, but it's certainly worthy."

"A very well made, very drinkable, and very refreshing summer ale."

"When i poured this into a pint glass, it has a bright golden body with one inch of white fizzy head, that dissappears to a thin lace. The smell is citrus hops. The taste is citrus, with some rye notes. The mouth feel is smooth crisp. Overall this is one i would drink in the summer."
""
""
"this beer pours a hazy yellow straw color with a decent 1 finger white head that lasts. the smell is slightly citrus hops with a definite rye presence. the flavor is very light on the rye, with a great citrus hop presence. the mouthfeel is light well carbed and mouth watering. overall this is an excellent brew and one of the best summer beers out there. if you live in the distribution area drink it, if you don't trade for it, then drink it."

"Light and bubbly on the tongue. Flavor would be bland if not for the rye. It brings in some spice that livens things up a bit. An easy drinking beer. Good for picnic"
"Pours a nice cloudy pale yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy white head, with some minimal sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, yeast, slight lemon note. The taste is malty, yeasty, slightly sweet, nice little touch of citrus. Medium Body, with a nice dry, slightly bitter finish. Another tasty brew from Mayflower."
"Overall: I find that some beers that lack complexity can be commended because they are easy to knock back without having to appreciate it fully. However, I think this beer needs more complexity - it seems muted. Aroma is somewhat dulled, flavors aren't very potent, and the feel and carbonation could be kicked up. It is however, very refreshing."
"O: Good summer beer. A bit of flavor but not overpowering. Resembles lemonade as much in appearance as drinkability."
"O - It has some potential, but this attempt at a rye and wheat summer thirst-quencher has muddled flavors and severely lacks carbonation."
"O: Definitely not what I was expecting. I swear this is a witbier with some rye in it. Regardless of what it is, it's very light and refreshing with just an extra kick from the rye. Honestly I think it would garner better ratings in the witbier category. A good summer beer as the name would imply."
"Pretty refreshing. I am a huge rye fan, but I'm not exactly sure how well it works here."
"This is a fun beer, but one that takes its fun very seriously. It was really well crafted to be exactly what I think the brewers wanted it to be. I like it."
"O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not filling at all, very mild kick, good lighter representation of style, this is a very nice flavorful beer to pound down for a long time."
" I could pound through this all night long"
"Drinkable, that's for sure. Between this and Spring Hop, Mayflower has made two very solid hot weather beers. Not overly complicated, but still leaps and bounds over a BMC."
"Pours a strange hazy yellow that is very watery looking. Almost reminds me of lemonade. Not a good looking beer at all. Aroma is mostly spicy rye, wheat, citrus and grainy malts. Flavor follows the nose with a pale, sweet pilsner malt backbone, spicy rye again, and finishes with a slightly sour citrus/grapefruity bite. There is also a yeasty/musty character throughout. Very light, watery mouthfeel. No alcohol presence detected. This is what BMC drinkers should be drinking. I could drink an entire six-pack sitting by the pool."
"D-Don't absolutely love the taste so the drinkability get pegged down a bit. However, at such a low ABV, this can be imbibed quite quickly and easily."
"D: Drinkability is good but not great. There are equally light and refreshing quaffs available that provide more substantial nose and flavor."
"Pours a four finger white head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Medium carbonation and light bodied. Cloudy very pale golden color. Nose is yeast and rye. Flavor is rye, grass and some yeast. $1.95 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA. Bottled Jun 3, 2010."
"Overall I was impressed with this beer despite it's relatively old age (bottled in early May if I remember correctly). A nice, complex, and most importantly easy-to-drink beer that's well worth a shot."
"After my first sip of this beer I actually had to ask the bartender if I got the right beer because I wasn't sure what the hell I was drinking. I'm a mayflower fan, but this one just didn't work for me, although I do appreciate the low ABV for a summer beer."
"One of those I like it better than I rate it beers. More flavor and complexity than I would anticipate 3.8% ABV."
"D: I love this as a summer session beer. Quite a bit of flavor and a true session beer's ABV. Well done."
"On tap at People's Republik in Cambridge. Served in a standard pint glass. Beautiful golden colored body. Thin white head floated on top. Smell was a lemon and pine aroma. Taste was very pleasant. Flavorful with a bit of citrus fruit, but the rye gave it a hay-like flavor also. Brewing with rye also lent a crispness to the mouthfeel that I really enjoyed. Mouthfeel was bright but approachable. I would drink this beer every season, not just summer. One of the better summer seasonal releases that I have tried this year."
"This was one of my lowest review. I like Mayflower brewing company. I honestly feel bad when I don't like a beer. But reviews are based upon personal opinion. And I think this beer kind'a sucks."
"This is a light bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. Carbed enough to be prickly and light on the tongue I could easily kick a few of these back during the summer and would choose this beer over the usual lawnmower brews like american wheat."
"D. A great session brew, I could have a few of these while hanging with my friends at the bbq. A great summer brew."
"I bought just a single of this beer, and I wish it was a whole six pack.This was a great summer beer. Very light in texture and alcohol which makes it quite sessionable. The rye flavor is evident, but it is not overpowering enough that would make one sick of it. Another great beer from a great New England brewer."
"An interesting Thing from the brewery of one of my favorite porters. Foggy and hazy in the glass, the color of watered-down Pine-Sol with plenty of the lemons found in that cleaner but none of the ammonia or whatever the solvent is that they use. Oddly, I detected a distinct aroma of vinyl or... rubber? Something plasticky. The head lasted but an instant. Some bitterness in the nose as well. The vinyl carries into the taste, somewhat covered by lemons and cloves but still prominent. A bit fruit-punchy overall, with a denser body and nice fizz to cut into the summer heat. Still, this is no Great Beer but rather a ho-hummer that you can drink easily. The rye adds some spice and a new tang that isn't present in other lighter fare, and the low ABV makes this a slammer after you finish painting the bathroom on a stagnant and stuffy July afternoon. I ought to be able to choke back the remaining five bottles, but I probably won't be repeating this beer."
"D: An excellent summer session beer. Very, very refreshing."
"How bout some inkwell stout to folow this ?"
"D: 3.8% ABV and an extremely dry finish make this beer perfect for a hot summer day. It's complex, herbal and earthy."
"Poured into Mayflower nonic, formed a 1/2"" bright white head above the very cloudy blonde brew. Head falls rather quickly, with average lacing. Aroma is wheat and spicy rye. Taste starts with a glimmer of wheat, then rye spices, and closes with a peek of citrus and some clean bitterness. Mouthfeel is thin, and drinkability is very easy. As a thirst-quenching summer beer, win. As a rye beer, not quite all I would look for. I think I'll think of this as one of the more flavorful summer brews and be happy with it."
"12oz. bottle served in my SA Perfect Pint. PKG on 05/04/10 indicated on the back label. Poured a semi-hazy pale yellow with a bubbly, two inch bright white head - this beer looks a lot like a Berliner-Weisse. Head eventually settles into a fairly solid, quarter inch cap, with some delicate strands of lacing revealed during the session. Nose reveals some citrus, earthy/herbal aromatics and a nice mix of rye and wheat. Taste falls somewhat short of the expectations that the appearance and smell suggest. Many of the qualities in the nose come out in the flavor profile, but everything is a little bland and watery with the lightly lingering herbal/earthy quality that was expressed in the nose manifesting itself, before culminating in a light, lingering bitterness - not really hops bittering per se, so it must be coming from the rye. Mouthfeel is light in consistency, with a lively carbonation and crisp finish. This beer has a lot of good qualities to it and proves that a low abv beer can be pleasant and refreshing. Unfortunately, the flavor falls a little short for me. Still this is a pretty refreshing beer for a hot day and a nice alternative to a Hefe because it has some different qualities."
" I do love a simple brew that has some life!"
"Drinkability - I had one bottle out of a pint glass and passed on the rest. The remaining bottles will be sent home with someone who might like it more."
"it drinks ok. nothing is oppressive, but I have had more refreshing summer seasonals, as well as more flavorful and more aromatic too. Rye is way too far in the background in this one, and it falls into just another wheat beer category."
"Good for Mayflower for branching out and experimenting with different flavours and ingredients, but I unfortunately don't feel that this beer is all that well balanced."
"F: Pretty bitter actually, not crazy over the top, but a nice bitterness comes through with teh grassy, slight spicy, and pale hops that again have a fresh Cascade dry hop taste. They are accentuated with the dryness. It gets dry, and I mean really dry. Imagine that it just keeps getting drier, and drier, until is really, really dry. Imagine that, being way, way too dry... (don't remember the exact South Park quote but you get the idea). It's very dry. Lots of wheat lingering, with some hints of spicy rye but barely there. This is a tasty beer and pretty refreshing. Being less than 4% it drinks really well too, I could pound many of these without skipping a beat."
"Cloudy yellow, a bit murky, with a fine skim of white bubbles and a thin collar. A bit of lacing, fair head retention. Sour wheat aroma dominated initially, but spicy rye took over as it warmed. A bit of lemon character and citrusy hops too. Bracing bitterness, spicy and peppery, light malt, lemony bitter finish. Light to the point of being thin, dry, a bit of a soapy texture. Light and refreshing, but the mouthfeel was a bit harsh. This one was okay, but it didn't really come together for me."
"The beer pours a cloudy, dirty dishwater yellow with no head and no lace. The nose has witbier or hefeweizen all over it. You have the cloves, coriander, lemony orange peel, and some subtle spices. The nose is very good. The taste is a real let down and it is from the rye. The grain is just too coarse to be in a summer ale. Enough said. The beer is very light bodied and somewhat refreshing, but it is flawed."
"Overall, not great. Maybe with some spicy food, but I could never have two of these in succession. The bitter edge in this one just sucks the life out of the beer. I actually think my ratings (flavor-wise), might be too generous. if you want to drink local and support the little guy, try this. If not, I certainly would not trade for this."
"Overall though it's a really easy drinking brew. 3.8%....it's something."
"Reminded me a lot of maybe Real Ale's Full Moon Pale Rye from Texas, just a little thinner though & maybe trying to be too brash in carbonation. Not as much flavor going on, but almost as easy to drink. :)"
"This is now available in 6pks and I cannot get enough."
"Drinkability: This is a super smooth beer and is very sessionable. I like the hoppy feel to this without the high abv. This is one of Mayflower's best to date."
"Not a bad choice on a hot day, very very drinkable."
"I could easily drink this beer all day, especially since the ABV is very low (which is a big plus for me). Very refreshing and light. Absolutely check this one out if you can."
"Another winner from Matt and the Mayflower gang!!!"
