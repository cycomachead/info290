"This smelled sweet for an ipa with a fair amount of rye spice and a slight minerally character.  The nose as a whole was relatively subdued, everything seemed muted, nothing jumped out.  The taste is well balanced, lots of rye spice, sticky sweet malts, earthy, peppercorns, some grapefruit hop notes, mild lingering bitterness, but still getting the same mineral qualities on the finish.  Mouthfeel resembles a bigger ipa, relatively full bodied, somewhat sticky, good carbonation.  Overall this was good but just didn't hold up to any of the other vermont and Massachusetts ipas consumed that night."
"lacks depth but generally tasty"

"The only thing wrong with this baby is it's only available during the winter time. Sad because while consuming it, I had pleasant thoughts of sitting on a back deck in the summer drinking a cold one of these. One of the most refreshing adult drinks I've ever had."
""
""
"Wicked tangerine, but a bit heavy on the mineral."
"Overall: Thought this was a fantastic brew. My wife picked it out... She's my beer muse. Psyched to finally try a rye-beer. Respectable ABV (6.5) and IBUs (60). Great for this time of year."
"Poured from six pack into a pint glass, pours a slightly opaque orange with a one finger head and lots of lacing as it sits. The aroma is very sweet, more so than most IPAs, smells of Apple and grapefruit mostly with a hint of biscuit? Maybe. The taste is nothing special, very piney at first with a finishing of the rye used. Mouth feel is fine, slightly thinner than I like, and more carbonation. Overall it's a good IPA I really enjoy the aroma. Think I would enjoy it more off a tap. Would have again 4.25/5"

"O: A very strong rye presence that lives up to its name with an equally good dry hopped backing. O.C. continues to step up their hop game and is becoming a force with a expanding portfolio of sought after hoppy beers. This is very good, six pack worthy, and the rye factor is something to be reckoned with. 6.5% abv% and drinks fairly big."

"Great rye IPA here.  Not too bitter so a good one for a ""non-IPA"" fan to try.  As a Vermonter, some of OC's stuff has been hit or miss for me; I would call this one a hit.  Nice IPA without the overwhelming bitterness."
""
"O - Plenty here for hop/bitter lovers with a nice rye twist.  Not as balanced as I'd like (too bitter) but all-in-all; a well-made and tasty brew."
"This beer is surprising. I didn't care for OC's Overgrown. This beer however definitely deserves the outstanding rating it's receiving. Its an excellent IPA to give to a buddy if you want them to get into craft and IPAs."
""
""
"O- A nice rye IPA, definitely will seek out again."
""
""
"Another winner from brewmaster Mike. A golden honey pour with some noticeable suspended particles, and a thin bubbly head. A fresh hoppy scent leads to a mouthful of fruit, pineapple, and berry. I think there's a hint of clove in there too. The malts balance out a long bitter finish, yum. Well done, I'll have another."

"Overall a good rye ale"

"solid beer just wasnt a favorite"
"Very good stuff & if I had a bucket full, this might get ass-bumped into the excellent sphere. Another fine brew from Otter Creek."
""
""
"O - Maybe not as exciting or standout as the many 'really great' IPAs of today, but this serves as a great example of a Rye-PA. They don't shy away from emphasizing the rye and it interplays with a nice hop profile."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The pour is radiant orange with a decent head and limited clarity. An average amount of lacing remains on the glass after consumption. The smell is black pepper, lemon, and grass. More of the same in the taste with additional notes of citrus, pumpernickel grain, and spice. While not the biggest fan of Rye IPAs, I do enjoy the kick this one provides. The finish is semi-dry and very bitter, but I'm not complaining. Reasonably executed."
""
""
"D: This had a nicely balanced scent and taste, with decent body. Solid brew, even if not super unique or exiting."
""
""
"Drinking this right now for the first time on draught at a bar in Baltimore. This is absolutely delicious. As a self-described hop head I'd begun to wonder whether anything under 8% would satisfy my admittedly overwrought taste buds. But at ""only"" 6.5% this delivers loads of flavor. I'd love to regale you with all the flavor nuances but I'll leave that to the folks who can actually wax poetic about that stuff. All I know is that this is an exceptional IPA that delivers loads of wonderful hop flavor. Love it!"
""
""
"First try of a rye beer. I've had better IPA's from OC in the past. Taste wasnt bad, the rye goes quick into a dry ipa aftertaste so you don't get the full flavor of some of the best out there"

"OVERALL: Good, Solid IPA that in my opinion could have been GREAT if the ""LOOK"" lasted longer AND the dry after-taste had been a bit more Prominent....All-In-All a QUALITY IPA that I WOULD Recommend and Purchase Again."
"Good beer, I like what the rye does to the flavor and mouthfeel, nice dryness. Only qualm was the appearance of noticeable ""floaters"" or proteins in suspension. Couldn't realy notice their impact on flavor or mouthfeel etc so otherwise, excellent."

"The nose on this beer is great. Super piney resin with a very mild hint of citrus; and it's consistent. That's the most interesting part as most beers fade quickly on the fragrance aspect of things. As far as the flavor goes, it's pretty decent. Mildly full and it follows through. A nice IPA. Wouldn't mind a bit more punch, but it works."
"At two months old, this IPA still has plenty of hop character, and the malt is not overpowering. Very tasty. Good balance, and an interesting hop profile."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer has a really nice balance between the hops and rye as the citrus, bitter and spicy flavors all complement each other."
""
""
""
"Sold rye IPA, reasonably priced six pack widely available, worth trying if you like a spicy rye note, which is not for everyone."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a really well done beer by Otter Creek, very drinkable and I could easily have another"
""
""
"I don't know if Otter Creek was holding back on us or if they learned a lot from Sean Lawson while making Double Dose. Don't care; if they keep making beers like this (and at this price!) I will buy the shit out them."
""
"Medium body with dry, earthy bitterness lingering over sweet citrus/tropical fruit notes and a faint pale malt backbone into a sweet, slightly dry finish. Some grassy pine needle, spruce tip and sticky resinous oils countered by prominent fruit sweetness and pale biscuit malt. The juicy tropical and citrus fruit notes really stand out with hints of juicy grapefruit, mango, pineapple, curaçao and blood orange. The sweet clementine, naval orange and tangerine notes are strongest providing the hop profile with delicious flavor. Perfectly balanced by a pale malt backbone with hints of biscuit, cracker, a touch of spicy rye and subtle caramel sweetness. This beer could use a little more earthy bitterness but is otherwise an excellently balanced, flavorful beer that is dangerously drinkable."
"This is an awesome IPA! I really hope this makes it to year-round rotation. If not... it is officially my favorite ""winter IPA"" release. IMO - better than Sucks and Celebration. Really a nice brew here."
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a light beige color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is strong of citrus, hops, some pine. Taste is grapefruit, tropical fruits, some bitterness, a bit of pine, finishes dry and tasty. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a good quality beer."
""
"O- This is an excellent rye IPA. Way to go Mike!"

"Otter Creek/Wolaver's collaboration beer Double Dose was intensely hoppy and quite enjoyable but, in my opinion, this offering was light years better. Kind Ryed IPA is incredibly tasty, remarkably well balanced and dangerously quaffable. I would love to see this became available year-round."
"The rye malts compliment the juicy tropical and pine hop flavor nicely. Another above average IPA coming out of Vermont and the North East. Soon it seems like the IPA market will reach saturation."
"Easily one of the better if more enjoyable rye hop heavy beers I've had."
""
""
""
""
"UPDATE 1/30/15: Bought another twelvepack when it came out this month, and it's a hoppy treat.  More than half of the twelver already gone and I've enjoyed them all.  This will be an annual 12 pack buy for me for as long as it's made and I'm drinking."
""

""

"O - Am starting to become a fan of Rye beers, and this is a good one. Good amount of rye and hops, which feature a very unique flavor. Recommended."
"O- A solid showing from a brewery I'm not that fond of. Lacks the depth and complexity of some of the really great IPAs I've had the good fortune to imbibe. An enjoyable beer, and one that I might pick up in the future at the right price."
"Mouthfeel is really good, great carbonation level. Medium bodied with a nice feel the whole way through. Not really smooth, but a nice natural sweet/juicy/fruity/earthy feel with a nice sharp dry bitter finish. Drinkability is ridiculous on this beer, this review was actually 2 12 oz. bottles because its so easy drinking, goes quicker than anticipated. I've had it on tap and in the bottle, it's great both ways. Otter Creek and Long Trail have been KILLING IT recently."
""
""
""
""

"The orange citrus notes are also abundant in the flavor but the rye grains attack from the rear in cahoots with a sweet melted caramel army. The sweetness is remarkable for an IPA but not off-putting. I could drink this one often and regularly."
""
""
""
"This is a decent effort, but it is not a top tier rye beer."
"A nice hazy pineapple colored body. 2 fingers worth of very creamy foam smothers the sides and drips down. Retention is average though. Smell of spicy rye with grapefruit is nice. Flavor is very mellow, rye and hops are subdued and mild. Finish is relatively tame. Ok but expected more flavor."
""
""
"overall pretty nice, great hop profile without going overboard, nice balance, malts are there nicely enough to give you a nice base without even getting remotely in the way of the hops, quite tasty and still drinkable. One of their best beers yet!"
"Nice over all RyePA... Sticks out more as a smooth session brew than a mind boggling taste buster. The rye was less predominant. Still was a great session brew~"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, really well executed rye and citrus elements. Some strawberry and watermelon starts to emerge too. Crisp and refreshing. Would definitely enjoy again."
""
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, there are better choices in the style but this is still a solid beer to drink for a while."

"Overall it's a pretty stellar IPA more importantly very drinkable and less than 10 bucks a six pack. May grab it again if I get the chance."
"O: Very solid beer! Recommended. Nothing particularly standing out, just generally enjoyable. The rye is nice in this beer, and works well with the choice of hops."
"12oz. bottle served in a standard pint. Pours a dull hazy copper with a two-finger, dense, bright white head. Thin wisps of lacing sporadically coat the sides of the glass as the brew is consumed. Nose expresses aromas of rye and light, fruity esters. Taste consistent with nose - earthy, with the addition of some more clearly identifiable citrus notes and some medicinal/piny bitterness at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium (but closer to light) with an assertive carbonation that borders on being prickly and a pleasant acidity that lightly stimulates the salivary glands. Overall, a pretty solid Rye Beer. I have to say that I like the direction that Otter Creek has been moving in recently."
""
"O: This is a really great beer. Its a blast of hops and flavor, I'm still not exactly sure what Rye tastes like but I like it. Reminds of Harpoons IPA and Stone IPA, for whatever thats worth. Highly recommended especially fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Pretty good but, more so a west coast ipa and lacking in the rye. Packs a pretty strong bitter hop punch, but not the most balanced beer out there. A little simple flavor, but done well enough to recommend giving it a try."
""
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint the beer is a hazy, muddled, orange-brown coloring that is opaque, with a clingy, filmy, off-white head. Aromas of citrus forward, with orange and tangerine, and a solid caramel backbone, with a rich and bitter toasted grain highlight throughout. Smells great. Flavors of tangy sweet and bitter forward, well blended, with a spicy profile or pepper, oregano, and cedar notes. Good citrus blend, providing tart notes throughout. The body is light, and slightly effervesced at the end. The aftertaste is rich sweet undertones with spicy hops overlay. Frothy, effervesced finish, with a bitter and slightly dry linger. Solid and very drinkable."
""
"Enjoyable beer. I have to admit I wish both the hops and rye were more prominent, especially the rye, but it's a solid effort from Otter Creek. HRd to rate because I'd like to know if the brewer intends for it to be more of an IPA, or more of just a rye beer. It works better as an IPA, less so as a rye focused beer."
""
"The sticker on the bottle is cool beans.. This IPA is great! You can smell and taste the hops right out the bottle.. This beer should definitely be rated higher.. I think Otter Creek nail it with this one..The hops linger in your mouth.. I'm bios when it comes to IPAs but this is just a good beer to have.. Cheers!!!!"
""
""
""
"Appears a clouded golden copper orange hue, with a thicket of off white head, intricate even lacing. Aroma has citrus bursts, apricot, hints of mango...hints of biscuit malt and dry yeast components. Let's see how it tastes, bitter, bitter, and oh yeah bitter. A wave of hops, big bitterness, lacks cohesiveness with a malt profile a bit of spicy rye in the backend, but more or less a wave of hops and finishes with bitter resins and dry yeast notes. Bottled 10/28/13 they have a bit of time on them but I think these bottles are just a bit over the top with dry hop bitterness, lacks malt sweetness, and balance. There is the spicy rye grassiness that only adds to the earthy bitterness and vegetal garlic/onion notes I'm getting it's like chewing on an everything bagel at this point. Mouthfeel completely drying bitterness, my mouth is a desert, waves of lingering bitterness ample soft carbonation resinous medium bodied ale. Overall, I appreciate the hops, but this cat who used to brew at DFH, needs to go do an internship on the West Coast to learn how to tame the hops or keep brewing collaborations with Lawson's Finest!!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - IPAs are my favorite and this is one is no joke. Otter Creek came out of nowhere with this beer and I hope they keep up the good work!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Solid! As good as a Rye IPA can get. Otter Creek seems to be stepping their game up."
"O - A solid, if unremarkable, IPA that is slightly elevated by the excellent rye finish, but that falls short of outstanding due to the muted nose and overall average body and flavor. I'd snag it again on tap to see if my bottle was old, as there was no visible date stamp."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I am not a big drinker of rye ales, but this was a nice beer, obviously a rye IPA, which may or may not work for some - there is a rustic feel to the ale as well as a hoppy IPA character; I found it easy to drink, and very tasty, but for my tastes, not a style I hanker for often."
""
""
"Deliberate rye spiciness with floral hops and dry grapefruity citrus. Toasty, but soft, as this works better than most red ales with similar characteristics. Almost perfectly sudsy, an impeccable feel from a medium swish body, and the texture of gulping retained head foam on big sips. Tastes great, with a keen hoppiness and solid rye showing. Slightly tea-like. Very easy to quaff. What a superb rye beer!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall the beer is pretty good, I'd get it in a bar or restaurant if it was one the ipa's on draft but probably won't be purchasing a sixer again. There's just so many other better options out there, although the price point is great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A tasty, easy drinking beer. I think I was looking for a little more hop flavor and aroma. Overall though I like it."
""
""
"Overall: This is on the upper level of IPAs. The flavor is impressive for the ABV. This makes good for any situation. For winter enjoyment it's a nice starter beer. Then you can lean on the heavier ales. I have no problem killing the sixer I just received. This brew is recommended."
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip. Pours a bright orange, with a 1 inch fluffy white head that coats the sides lace. Smell I'd tropical, tangerine, papaya, rye(I have finally drank enough to know the smell, a slight breadyness, grapefruit, and pine. The taste starts very tropical, a little breadyness/toffee, and papaya and grapefruit finish. Body is medium large, nice carbonation, not really dry, and very drinkable. This is really well done, I feel they learned a lot from brewing with Lawson's and am excited about Otter Creek again."

"O-A great smelling and tasting rye IPA. Very good beer from Otter Creek / Wolaver's. If you're a hop head this is definitely one you need to try."
""

"O - Im surprised at how much I like this beer, this might be one of my favorite Rye IPA's Ever, its really impressive how drinkable this is too."

"This isn't very good.  Double Dose is outstanding and the new Pale is also pretty good.  This just isn't for me, malty and sweet, very not good."
""
"cloudy orange color with a nice sized white head, about a finger upon pouring into the glass. the head lingered as a small white ring on the top of the beer in the glass. It has a light citrus almost orange scent to it. As the amount of beer in the glass lessened the scent turned to more of an orange than at the beginning. Started out with a little bit of a hoppy bitterness that quickly faded. Very light feeling beer, almost as light as a session IPA. This is a light IPA that would be decent for a nice summer day, and at only 6% would be fine. Its a little too light for me and the hoppy kick that is common in most American IPAs is not very pronounced in this. Decent beer to try, but I will not be buying another six pack of it for a little while."
""

""
""
""
"A good Rye beer."
"Overall I'm really impressed and will be headed back for more than a single bottle. Definitely worth a try by any rye fan or hophead."
""
""
""
"Overall – A rather tasty rye, with a rather nice blend between citrus, rye, grass, bread, and sweet.. While not quite all it is chalked up to be it is very tasty and quite balanced."
""
"As I drink on, the grainy note fades away and no longer becomes offensive. Tons of green leafiness and pine in this IPA with an almost watery body and a strong bitterness. A very well made beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is a solid brew for sure. I'm a sucker for rye. Liking rye in beer is a definite prerequisite for trying this brew or you aren't going to like it."
"Poured a golden body with good head that left a little lace. Strong floral hop aroma and you can pick up touches of sweet caramel malt and rye. The hops and carbonation give the beer an overall dryer, sharper feel, but the sweetness and the rye offer great balance so the beer is never cutting and easily passes over the tongue. Straddles the line between hoppy ale for the hop heads and milder ale for those who aren't IPA fans. Overall, a really good beer (nuff said)."
""
"Thanks!"
"O : I enjoyed this beer but the signature lemon hoppiness probably limits this to a 1 pint beer. The heavy dose of caramel malts also drags down drinkability somewhat. But not a bad beer at all."
"This is a solid Rye IPA. It's not flashy and there's no gimmicks. It's just straight foraward and well crafted."
""
""
""
""
""
"Well this the second brew from OCB that I have been impressed within the past few weeks (Double Dose being the other). In general I am not much of a fan of Rye IPA's, but this is certainly an exception. Citrusy, fruity, spicy, rye malt and bitters come together in a way that I have never experienced in a Rye IPA before. For one who had little faith in OCB, I am now willing to try out some of Mikes new brews- I honestly wonder if Sean Lawson didn't rub off on him in the best way? Certainly worth trying if you like Rye IPA's and if you are not a fan of RIPA's as I generally am, then I strongly suggest you rethink whats possible in the style."
"Hazy copper and a creamy, chunky head (seriously). Smells of citrus, grass, and pine, along with the spicy tang of rye and a touch of fruit. The rye steps it up in the flavor, with the hops keeping things piney bitter throughout and beyond. Nice medium body and fine carbonation in this nicely priced beer. Recommended."
""
""
""
"A well done rye IPA that is well worth picking up. Mike Gerhart makes his mark once again."
""
""
"Pours with an insane white head. Orange hazy look the bottom of that large white head. Very nice hoppy citrus smell that is very impressive for an IPA. The taste is very nice. The rye is very present and impressively is fairly smooth. As it warms it actually seems to have a bit less taste but its still enough there to make this very enjoyable. Overall, it's a very drinkable tasty rye IPA.q"
"Overall, this is a sessionable and enjoyable beer that's perfectly balanced."
"I employed an aggro pour to get things rolling and was met with two fluffy fingers of tawny head that soon fell away to nothingness, leaving some sticky lacing in its wake. I leaned in for a whiff and it smelled like wake 'n' bake time, man. Total dank! Phew! Color was a hazy, almost cloudy, orangish-amber, going to show that even a fairly fresh IPA can quickly devolve. Or perhaps it was unfiltered, but either way, I was ready to partake. Jeez, Louise, every time that I brought it near my nose, I could have sworn that somebody was letting me sniff a baggie of their freshly-harvested, basement-grown stash. Man, I am going to drink half of this and then put the other half in a water pipe. Please note that I am VERY careful not to mention any terms that might bring Homeland Security or other unwanted fuzz-types to my pad, man. I try to maintain a mellow environment here at Chez Woody, dig? Chill is the watchword, man. Mouthfeel was surprisingly big, like a dollop of that special caramel The Old Lady whipped up during my visit to CANorado, man. It was also kind of mellow, the hops not choosing to be confrontational, but more like ""Hey, man, how are you? Let us do you a solid, man."" Far out! I passed it to Chong and he nodded in agreement, or maybe he was just nodding off. Man, that dude really knows how and where to score the really good, ahem, hops. The wild light show going on in the sky through the windshield was mind-blowing and as kind as they were to have given me a ride, I had them drop me off at this crazy kitty's house so we could engage in some extracurricular activities. Hey, man, The Woodman does not live by or with The Old Lady alone and she does her own thing in CANorado while I do my thing here in PA. The finish was cool and minty, dosed with rye, man, and kitty cat thought that I had used mouthwash when I punched her in the mouth with my lips. May I have another hit of this one, please?"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I'm going to head back to the store and buy more. This is everything one would expect out of a rye beer."
"12oz with 093013 on the neck. Pours a hazy burnt orange color with a half inch of head. Some lacing. The aroma has some spicy hops and tropical fruits. Slightly bready. The taste is bitter orange peel and tangerine. Spicy hop notes as well. Some bread and sweet malts. Floral hop notes. Bitter orange peel at the end. Very dry mouthfeel. Medium bodied. Quite drinkable. Overall, very good Rye that's worth seeking out. I'm hoping this isn't just a one time brew."

"O/D-Kind Ryed is a tasty treat. Otter Creek crafted this brew very well. This and Double Dose have really opened my eyes to Otter Creek's potential."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" The taste is on the dank herbal side with some leafy grassy hop flavors with almost piney sharp aspect but nice mild caramel undertone gives a nice cushion for the hop forward flavor which is not astringent or off putting, but definitely aggressively bitter. This IPA is a good rye IPA to me because it seems to keep both the hops and malt flavor in mind even though it is not what I would call malty, just not out of balance or harsh I consider this to be tasty and drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A really nice rye IPA, not quite as good as the big 3 of VT brewers, but I'm nitpicking. Definitely pick this up if you can (I think it'll be distributed farther than Double Dose was, and at 9 bucks a six pack you can't go wrong)"
