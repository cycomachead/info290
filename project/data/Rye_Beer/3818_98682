Aroma is dark malt, a little brown sugar, rye spice & a slightly sour note in a fruity/juicy, leafy floral, pineapple, light citrus & pine background. Taste is malty, lightly boozy, brown sugary sweet with heavy rye spice, tropical fruit, orange/tangerine citrus hints. Finish is caramel/honey sweetness & rye spice that becomes a hop/alcohol bitterness & dryness in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied, medium carbonation, a little syrupy but creamy, lightly prickly & lively with rye spice.","mothmanscott","Feb 07, 2015"

Nice, but somewhat subtle, nose of caramel and rye over a spicy background. Heavy medium body with a nice oily creamy texture.  Well carbonated with a nice effervescent finish.  Even at one year of age, the flavor profile is outstanding with a complex balance.  It begins with a spicy character that flows to nice rye notes. In the middle, caramel sweetness flows into a light hop flavor blend (dank, pine and citric) and light bitterness.  The finish is long and leaves you with a nice rye spiciness over hop notes and bitterness.  Even aged, this one is up there with the best.","tillmac62","Sep 01, 2014"

The taste remains flushed with rye at every turn, taking the form of the savory, the bitter, and the sweet. It mixes well at each of these stops with the surrounding fruit, hops, and medicinals, keeping things warm, hearty, and pleasant. This is really a fantastic brew. It is different enough from not only their stock, but of the entire local upstate NY stock, making it a stand out on numerous levels, all while keeping it heavy enough to appeal to people seasonally. It is also kind of a blend between the dark and the light, and with hoppy enough brightness to appeal to the hop heads alike. Their best “2X” to date.","TheBrewo","Dec 24, 2013"

Mouthfeel was silky smooth and the minty pepperiness was like a celebration on my poor, aching tongue.

The aroma was quite a lovely mix of floral rye and citric hops. The taste was heavy on the grains, with sour, spicy flavor given off by the rye, which was counterbalanced by citric hops and a bit of nuttiness from roasted grains. The finish was prickly in its feel, as the rye was allowed to rule the roost. The beer felt very dry and lean as well, with not a lot of sticky coating. Very nice burps after a few sips.

Very clear, to the point of almost diminishing its color, coppery orange to lighter red, more orange to yellow at rims and glass bottom, sluggish bubbles. Straightforward nose, crisp and openly knit, sweet orange to pink grapefruit zest, the rye comes through easily, however, it still has a somewhat creamy texture in the nostrils, mixed sweet grains, light pepperiness, strong underlying maltiness, ripe peach to nectarine fruit scents, maybe banana as well, just hangs pregnantly like a rain cloud. In the mouth it is medium-bodied, soft and fluid but not creamy, the rye has an edge and that peppery quality is spotlighted. Grapefruit, lemon citrus, pine, wildflowers and a flourish of milk chocolate and caramel as it goes down the chute. The carbonation is not steady, more an irregular pulse but on the whole keeps the beer inclined towards dryness. Leaves a metallic earthiness behind as residue. Good drinkability and could see putting back 2-3 of these in a sitting, which is likely on the high end for this type of beer per se.","farrago","Nov 17, 2013"

This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, crisp clean, not too filing and the taste did a decent job at holding my attention, I think a couple of these would be the right amount for me. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and aroma, they were both pretty good, but I really liked the balance and the hop profile in the aroma. What I liked the least about this beer was the taste, it was still nice, but I thought the rye and especially the hops could have shown up more like they did in the aroma. I don't think I would buy this beer again, for a seasonal Rye Beer I would rather have a Ruthless Rye. I would recommend this to Rye Beer fans, but I don't think it's a stand out in the style. All in all I thought this beer was solid, but if the taste was as good as the aroma then this would be a pretty damn good beer, I think with a little tweaking it could live up to it's potential. This beer doesn't make me like Southern Tier anymore, but it doesn't make me like them any less either, it's kind of right in the middle.","StoutHunter","Nov 06, 2013"

Spicy and peppery rye dominates the flavor up front but is quickly complimented by dry, earthy hop bitterness that lingers through the finish. Dry, sticky hops are very bitter with grass, pine needle and spruce tip flavor. As it warms, the malts become more prominent with caramel sweetness, toffee, dark fruit, bread and biscuit. The high ABV is well masked making this beer easier to drink than it should be. Complex and well balanced but the hops interfere with rye spiciness a bit too much for my preference. I would have preferred if it was heavier on the rye with a subtle earthy hop presence. Unfortunately it was the other way around. Still, this beer was interesting and an enjoyable drink.

It has the added benefit of being over 8% without tasting like alcohol, so that might be something to consider if you're a fan of imperial versions of beer styles.

Aromas of big grapefruit, orange zest, lemon zest, tangerine, pineapple, pine, floral, grass, rye, caramel, bread, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of hop notes with moderate malt balance; and good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, orange zest, pineapple, floral, grass, pine, rye, caramel, bread, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, pineapple, floral, grass, pine, rye, caramel, bread, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of hop flavors; with a moderate malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice imperial rye IPA. All around nice balance and complexity of hop and malt flavors; and very smooth to drink for the ABV.
