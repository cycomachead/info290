The most remarkable thing about this beer is the balance of  all the different hops. Tastes of grapefruit, pine and a wonderful array of spiciness. Dry across the tounge. Give this a try.

The sticky grapefruit hoppiness is really quite enjoyable, but the malt is a bit too saccharine and viscous to give it a good backbone. The spice from the rye is under-realized, too. Sierra Nevada's Ruthless Rye is a far superior beer for the price point.","hail_seitan","Sep 26, 2014"

The taste has mostly rye grain notes and a satisfying spice bite with the hops leaving the palate dry. Each sip leads to a need for another, and this beer was consumed in a matter of fact fashion.

3.9,2.6,4,4,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 1/15/2014. Pours lightly hazy orange amber color with a 2 finger dense cream colored head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, orange zest/rind, floral, grass, pine, rye, toast, caramel, and floral earthiness. Very nice aromas with good complexity of hop notes and moderate malt balance; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, orange zest, floral, grass, light pine, caramel, rye, toast, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peace, floral, grass, caramel, toast, rye, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity of hop flavors with prominent malt backbone; with fairly crisp malt/bitterness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately creamy, and fairly crisp/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice rye IPA. All around good complexity and balance of juicy hop and moderate malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 30, 2013"

The bitterness of the hops play very well off of this. I am looking forward to drinking the 2nd of these from the Harpoon Winter variety pack.

This brew fresh on tap is way different- Pours a amber coppery color leaving a generous head of foam. I immediately pick up on floral hops and bubblegum. Smell is not dissimilar from the taste- I pick up on bubblegum fading to more of a floraly flavor with a malty presence but not overwhelming. For being an IPA its not overly bitter but I may consider this one to be a bit ""chewy"". Overall this is a fantastic RIPA and I am enjoying this one way more on tap as compared to bottled. If you can try it on tap I would strongly recommend it , and if you like RIPA's I also recommend trying it fresh out of a bottle.","80x2HopHead","Sep 17, 2013"

The nose comprises grapefruit zest, light banana, biscuit, and a hint of toffee. The taste brings in more of the same, with the grapefruit showcasing a sharp bit of its rind and most of the malty backbone's elements fading into obscurity in the back. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a decent RIPA, though the rye character is pretty much nonexistent, and the hops come across sharply dull. Still, it ain't all that bad, really, just not all that good.","TMoney2591","Jan 03, 2013"

Pours a dull, burnt orange-copper with a loose, half inch, off-white head and a slightly hazy clarity. Head eventually dissipates into a broken slick that coalesces around the shoulders of the glass. Some delicate strands of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose initially expresses pine and citrus before yielding a hint of caramel and earthy malts. Taste is earthy malts and hops with a slightly bitter and medicinal finish - all the nuances of the nose seem to drop out of the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a crisp carbonation and a light, palate-cleansing acidity. Overall, a bit lackluster. Not something I need to revisit again.","Jwale73","Aug 14, 2012"

The aroma is alive with floral and piney hops which overpower everything else although there is a little grainy character in there. The body is in the medium range and rather smooth but not creamy. The taste also brings forth a huge hop character with a biting bitterness at the end and some grains. Nothing sweet here. It will linger for a bit after it is finished.","puboflyons","May 17, 2012"

But then you go through a series of taste that is incredibly definitive. First I felt like it was an APA, then the rye comes in, and finally the additional hops at the end to take to the imperial level. It is amazing how the hoppiness stays with you but isn't dry or overpowering. All in all, this is by no means is a session beer but I feel like I could drink it all day long. Light, mellow and tasty.

The smell is aggressive and complex; fruity citrus and grassy hop blend. Really added a lot to my overall impression. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, has a hoppy tang and is nicely carbonated. There is an enjoyable resin aftertaste that lingers appropriately. The flavor mirrored the nose and had the grainy rye character that i've come to expect from rye beers. Overall a very fine drinker. I'd recommended it.","jjayjaye","Sep 02, 2011"
3.82,0.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass, the beer pours a bright, vibrant goldenrod color with a tall, frothy, light bubbled head that quickly recedes/settles into a decent film. It also coats the glass quite well as the receding occurs. Citrus blends the aromas, and stays strong throughout the nose amidst the smokey and grainy characteristics, along with a subtle background hopping. The flavors are heavier in citrus aspects initially, but quickly blend with a roasted grain and dry hopped flux of flavor. The blend actually keeps the overall flavor profile lighter than most IPAs. The aftertaste is more of the resiny characteristics of hops, with a strong jolt of bitterness, and it translates into a drying finish that is somewhat smooth at the same time. Well blended flavors and a light, smooth body make this a refreshing brew.","GarthDanielson","Aug 30, 2011"

3.93,3.4,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"A hazy golden grain color with a sturdy one-finger frothy white head and luscious lacing.

It’s wonderfully creamy in feel with a tasteful tingle of carbonation. It settles in with a slight orange peel clove and a reasonable rye overtone that maks for a very decent brew. Nice. This is quite drinkable and a smooth IPA with a nice bitterness.","Durge","Aug 17, 2011"
4,5.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Appearance is light amber in color and slightly cloudy, but certainly toward the clear end of the spectrum for IPAs. Aromas were of fresh grapefruit and lemon.

4.36,14.7,5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Good rolling bitterness that doesn't scorch the palate or linger too long. Rye maltiness is noticeable but fits right into the flavor profile. Somewhat dense body for an IPA, rye tend to be viscous and I assume that's why. Really easy drinking for a close to 7% ABV. I truly impressed by this beer.

Flavor really packed the hop punch, as it had a plethora of IPA hop flavor bursting at the seams. The addition of the rye had positive and negative effects. I liked the rye for the flavor, as it lent a spicy and smoky flavor to the taste. What I didn't like was the effect on the mouthfeel. It made this beer way too dry on the palate.

3.93,3.4,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"this is a brisk one and quite a chalk dry feel on the tongue. a bit lighter than most rye. orange almost clear with a just very very slight off white head. nose is pine mineral with wort sweet undertone... very subtle. the palate is similar in that i seem to get a interesting earthy and not as sweet as most. but there is a hint deep deep in the finish... if you're drinking it alone of fruit orange preserve. nice bitter earthy hint. mineral touch. rocky not earthy. interesting water character. solid but not exceptional. like the series none the less. reminds me of the smuttynose IPA but broader... and just as dry.","rtepiak","Jul 29, 2011"

3.93,3.4,4.5,4,4,3,4,"Overall, this is a good IPA, though problematic in that the rye flavors are not as prominent as the label would suggest--indeed, not knowing this was a Rye IPA, I wouldn't have necessarily known rye was in it. And the heavy alcohol in the aftertaste did become overwhelming after about a third of the bottle. Still, the hoppy tones are delicious, and there's just enough spice to give the beer a welcome kick. Worth a try, but don't expect to be blown away.","jondeelee","Jul 27, 2011"
3.5,-7.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Opinion: Overall this is a well made beer, but the recipe is off a bit to showcase the Rye. I believe that they were going for spicy complexity in an effort to compliment the Rye malt, but instead they they took away from it with the hop bill. All that said, this is a decent beer and I have no desire to pitch it or anything, so it isn't bad at all. I would just adjust the hops if I were them to something more American than Belgian.","SkeeterHawk","Jul 26, 2011"

3.9,2.6,4,4,4,4,3.5,"The flavor is aggressively bitter with hop resins, but not so much as to leave behind a medicinal twang. Rather, the spicy rye character in the grain bill finishes with a snappy, dry malt note. The medium-light body is crisp and dry on the palate, with a tight carbonation level. Overall, a good beer from Harpoon. A little unbalanced, as the delicate fruity citrus and yeast esters in the aroma are almost overpowered. Still, it's tasty.","wagenvolks","Jul 11, 2011"
3.88,2.1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"The beer pours a beautiful golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a mild pale and rye malt scent. It's light with a touch of spiciness. The hop aroma good. It's not incredibly bitter, but it balances the malt aroma nicely. The taste is good. It's really smooth with a mild hop bitterness. The malt bill provides adequate complexity and balance. The rye also lends a subtle spiciness that compliments the hops. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer. It's easy drinking, yet flavorful; an accessible rye ale.","WesWes","Jul 10, 2011"
3.06,-19.5,4,3,3,3,3,"O- Overall, I was so excited that Harpoon decided to brew a Rye IPA. Not so much anymore! Not a bad brew just not very special. Not one I'd seek out but can see giving this to a buddy that is just getting into craft. Maybe not fair to Harpoon that two of my favorite beers are nelson and Founders, Rye IPA!","Robtobfest","Jul 10, 2011"
3.07,-19.2,3.5,4,2.5,3,3,"Edit: as this one warmed the metallic taste vanished but all that remains is an interminably long bitter finish, totally overwhelming any other subtleties of this beer.

3.9,2.6,4,4,4,4,3.5,"O - I'd buy this one again, Rich & Dan's has some really nice qualities and for hop heads, it would be interesting if Harpoon dialed up the intensity of the aroma and flavors. This one is worthy of adding to the regular rotation of Seasonal or Year 'Round brews in their line-up. The 100 Barrel Series hasn't been ""as"" appealing (compared to the Leviathan line), but this beer is solid. Then again, I'm biased because the Leviathan Imperial IPA is by far my most favorite Harpoon beer...hands down.","jzeilinger","Jul 05, 2011"

Flavor is hop-dominated... in fact, there's really not any malt detectable. I can't pick out any particular rye notes, but it's very tasty none the less. It makes me think of a very clean wheat IPA as much as anything.","allengarvin","Jul 03, 2011"
3.64,-4.2,3,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Poured into a pint glass a Copper/red with a minimal amount of off white head. The aroma has a lot of the rye but also an equal amount of tropical fruity hops. A earthy/hay aroma is subtle after jostling the glass a couple times. Starts off lightly toasted malt with a hint of fruity hops on top but finishes off with a tangy rye bitterness. Medium body with a smooth transition of malty, fruity and bitter.","DrinkingDrake","Jul 03, 2011"
3.93,3.4,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Pours a clear deep golden almost copper color with a stingy beige head that dissipates slowly before attaching a fair amount of lace to the sides. Smells of grapefruit and citrus fruit mixed with a spicy rye twang. Lots of toffee and caramel in there to provide a backbone. Taste is pretty much what I expected from the aroma. Sweet caramel and toffee up front mildly spicy rye followed by less grapefruit and citrus than I expected. Finishes kind of dry with a long lingering citric bitterness. Reminds me a whole lot of Harpoon IPA, but a little creamier and a little rye added. Creamy smooth mouthfeel, medium body and carbonation level. I enjoyed this one there's really nothing wrong with it, but there's not really anything spectacular about it either. Good beer, but not great, glad I got to try it.","johnnnniee","Jul 02, 2011"
3.53,-7.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Okay, this is strange, the first flavor I note is...pate. It's a meaty taste with a note of oysters. The hop takes over in the swallow without much more than a bittering effect. The body is as expected and the carbonation is mildly elevated.","smcolw","Jul 02, 2011"
4.38,15.3,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Appears a slightly hazed copper in the body with a billowing off white cream head rising above the edges of my Gulden Draak chalice. Chunky sporadic bands of lacing are left behind with each sip. This is a nice beer, full on citrus and spicy rye interplay going on in the nose. Enough base malt provides some bread/crackers balance to it, but big alpha hop brings the grapefruit pungency. Flavor wise it's banging with citrus hops and a bit of earthiness, which is blended nicely with a bready/spicy rye notes bringing out an herbal/grain note to it. Bitterness lingers in a good way on the palate, with nice slick hop oils flowing along, ample carbonation carries the body just fine. Overall between a nice brisk bitter IPA and interesting rye spiciness, this was one of my favorites I've had from the 100 barrel series in some time, pretty rock solid offering so solid that the founders of Harpoon threw their names on it.","WVbeergeek","Jun 29, 2011"
3.26,-14.2,4,3,3.5,3,3,"Medium body, a bit higher carbonation, prickly and dry. Not a particularly great rye beer, but drinks pretty smoothly. Definitely not in the same league as Nelson, Righteous, or Red's Rye.","xnicknj","Jun 28, 2011"

4.05,6.6,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Looks nice, clear gold with a fluffy, off-white cap. Lots of clumpy lacing, decent head retention. I got a whiff of grapefruit and grassy hops during the pour and wasn't disappointed once I had more time to contemplate the beer in the glass. There was a slight pine resin edge to the hops as well, plus mild nutty and bready malts. Solid bitterness, citrus pith and grassy hops in the flavour, some spicy hops in the finish, with mild malt bready/rye presence, minerals, and slight alcohol. Good texture, medium light in body with moderate carbonation, but it felt light and creamy. Overall, I enjoyed this one. The rye didn't add a lot, but I did like the hop character.","DrJay","Jun 12, 2011"

3.73,-1.8,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Thanks to my friend Paul for sharing. This reminded me of Harpoon IPA for better or worse. The body was relatively light for the style, but it was by no means watery and on a summer day, I didn't mind. The hops and rye blend into a spicy bread floral citrus mix that's quite pleasant, but should be a bit richer for an IPA. It just didn't have the same kick as most ~7% hoppy ales.","tempest","Jun 08, 2011"

2.28,-40,4,3.5,1.5,2,2,"Mouthfeel is sticky and full yet the finish is harsh and unforgiving. The rye and hops are too out of balance for my preferences. I love good rye beers and this is not one of them. If your going to mail in the malt bill you have to at least have late hops additions for nice hop flavors, but this doesn't have any. After making a lot of great beers in this 100 Barrel Series, Harpoon seems to have mailed in the last couple. If I was Rich or Dan, I wouldn't want my name attached to this beer... I haven't had a good drain pour in a while, adios #37!","claspada","Jun 04, 2011"
4.05,6.6,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Pours a moderate golden color that is mostly clear. Good white head and a nice bit of lacing on the way down. The nose carries a good portion of rye along with some floral and spicy hops. The flavor carries the same with the rye really taking a step forward and bringing a bit of spice. Mostly floral hops with a bit of an earthy feel as well. All is very well integrated into a medium-bodied brew with a nicely-bitter finish. Some alcohol detected afterward. This was a thoroughly enjoyable brew.","Thorpe429","Jun 02, 2011"

3.58,-5.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a golden amber. Nice white head. Aroma is little bit citrus with a hint of spicy rye. First sip is clean, more piney citrus with that kick of rye at the end. I would like a little more of the Rye to give this a bit more bite. As it is its just a toned down IPA with a bit of rye in the background. THis could be a really nice beer with a bit of tweaking. Not bad, certainly an easy drinking summer IPA.","Liverpool08","May 28, 2011"
