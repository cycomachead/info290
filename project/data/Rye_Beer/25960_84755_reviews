"Incredibly flavorful and only 4.4!"
"Yeah, it's pretty clear that certain musky, dank hop strains so favoured by brewers all up and down the west coast of late, do not agree with me.  That said, this is still a pretty enjoyable rye ale, the adjunct grain doing well to integrate with the whole, while the other hop esters prop up an otherwise lost cause."

"Very fruity up front but quickly followed by a dry rye taste that leaves behind a bitter bite and makes you thirsty for more. I could sip on this one for a long time."

"Easy to drink."

"An easy drinking pale ale with a spice note from the rye and citrus and floral hop notes. Great session!"

"O - This is my first taste of a rye beer and I was impressed. This is a great ""lawn mower"" beer - easy to drink with plenty of flavor. Very refreshing."

"I pissed off someone I didn't know on Facebook today for repeatedly misusing the word ""socialism"" - good fuck, go look it up - so my day was already made, but hey, a beer makes the end of every night better, right? Carbonation really does no favors to the beer; still pretty good."
"Overall: I have to admit I am starting to become quite the fan of rye beers. Considering an equivalent case of 24 x 330mL would be over AU$180 however, I think I will take a Brewcult Supa Fly Rye IPA most days, and save the Gramarye for special occasions."

"Nice moderate carbonation."

"Overall: Very nice session-able, rye pale. I really want to like it more considering its credentialing, but it seems like someone turned it’s volume down. Muted, I guess. To be fair the label says “Bottled 07.30.12”, so it likely has already passed its prime. I’m going to look for it on draft."

"Good brew. Interesting flavors and easy to drink."

"Overall, this is a damn drinkable brew. The rye is subtle, but broadens the palate nicely, which is very nice. Often rye can make a beer sharper and spicier, but here it provides additional width of character. Very nice stuff, probably one of the best of Heretic's I've had."
"Pours a golden bronze hazy hue with a creamy three finger head and lacing here and there,the smell is quite light with aromas of spicy rye,herbal hops and a touch of passionfruit,the mouthfeel is just over light bodied with high carbonation and has tastes of passionfruit,peaches,spicy rye and finished with a spicy dryness and overall its abit of a let down and is pretty subdued on all levels but nice for a session ale cheers."

"From the 22 oz bottle. Bought this at Baron's Marketplace in San Diego, which had several Heretic brews all of a sudden. $6 for the Rye."
"Overall, this is a good session beer with nice rye and malt notes and a good deal of balance. It isn’t as heavy as many of the other Heretic products, but it is still good and flavorful in its own way and it’s a product worth trying if you like the taste of rye."
"This is a great example of a session beer. The rye flavor really fills in the gap most session beers have due to a lack of grain/malt. There is a good amount of hop flavor and aroma without being too bitter."
"Drink- A nice beer. I like rye and have been looking for new rye beers when I can. This was a good beer to unwind on a Sunday with."
"This is a very nice lower abv beer. Packs a good amount of flavor into that 4.4% abv. Pours a pretty orangey amber. Quite clear, minimal haze. Aroma is mild but juicy citrus hops on top of some rye spice and some caramel maltiness. A little bit of a floral quality in there somewhere. Very tasty stuff. For me, this has perfect balance for this sort of low abv amber ale. It starts with rye-spicy caramel sweetness and sweet orange hop flavor and then dries out and finishes with a refreshing bitterness, packed with pine resin and rye bread. Very easy to drink. Mouthfeel is light, creamy and smooth. It compliments the flavor very well and is surprisingly full-bodied for the beer's strength. Great stuff. I've been a bit disappointed in Heretic, so far (to be clear, I had my expectations very high), but this beer is excellent. Also, I'm happy to see another tasty, low abv beer."
"D - Very drinkable. Nice hopp rye pale ale. Great overall balance with some good rye character."
