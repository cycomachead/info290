"Overall it was tasty, easy drinking and hid the ABV quite well, but if you’re going to seek this out then you’d better be into smoked malts, coffee and chocolate flavors since those are the dominant flavors. More of a smoke beer with rye elements to me, but still a nice variation on several styles with good use of all the ingredients involved that made for a complex and flavorful brew."

"A noble idea marred by a beer that cuts a straight line down the center of mediocre. Nothing wrong with it. Just beer."
"Poured into nonic pint glass; jet black with a big fluffy creamy tan head that fades after a bit leaving awesome rings of lacing. Smell is roasted malt, slight coffee, sweet chocolate, soft rye grain. Taste is sweet chocolate, bitter coffee roasted malt, and a hint of spicy grainy rye mixed in with it all. The rye grain adds an extra dimension to the mouthfeel, which is on the thinner side for a stout but the carbonation makes up for it."

"3.5 D: I'm going to try to dissipate the carbonation for the second half of the bottle, but I had to review it the way it was."

"O: A very nice-looking and feeling stout, and very drinkable, but a little too mellow and dry in the taste."
""
"O: Perhaps my first rye stout. Rye is omnipresent but the nice mellow roasted malt provides a nice counterbalance and complementary flavor. Very easy drinking and tasty. Well done."

"O- This beer is thin but pleasant tasting with it could use a bit more character or depth. It drinks pretty quick but one pint is enough."
""
""
"Chewy palate indeed. But not overwhelming, a smooth, chewy palate makes for a nice session stout. Good roasted malt flavors, dark coffee and black rye bread crust. The finish is just a little tinny. Good beer overall, would buy again."

"Thought this would be more of a stout but feels like a complex porter. Complex malty profile that's easy to drink. Beer takes a whole to settle in and pick up the complex flavors. Awesome."

"O- Overall a good beer. Even though the presentation was bland and nothing special, the taste was very nice and the mouth feel was even better. Really enjoyed this."

"I didn't come here to try this, but now that I did, I'll be back for more."
"I'll admit my wariness going into this, what with the incredible sadness caused by things bearing the name ""Repo Man"" (eg the Genetic Opera, Repo Men, etc). Still giving it a whirl, though: It pours a deep black-brown topped by a finger of tan foam. The nose comprises coffee, roasted malts, and a bit of molasses. Somehow, it just smells sorta dry... The taste holds notes of toasted rye bread, roasted malts, a touch of sourdough, and, once again, that little hint of molasses. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a very nice stout, though it comes off just a notch too thin for my preference. Beyond that, though, good times..."
"Overall Drinkability: Excellent rye beer."

"Labeled a rye stout, hard not to enjoy this if you think that sounds good. Would have again, over and over."
"This was a really good rye beer. There was a good amount of malts on both the aromas and flavors. Bigger without being too big."
"Overall: This is an excellent example of how a little rye can make a great beer. This is expertly crafted, smooth, and ridiculously delicious. I will definitely be ordering another pint. Revolution does it again! Recommended!"
"O: awesome. This brew encompasses everything that I love in a stout: it's big bodied, massively roasted, incredibly rich, and overall delicious!"
"D= Really the best thing I have had at Revolution, and that is saying something. Many rye beers just don't get it right, but this one does. Complex, spicy and delicious."
"D - Gets a touch bitter and fatiguing after a pint or so, but otherwise thoroughly enjoyable. Is this the base beer for Bad Man? If so, I think I prefer it before it hits the barrels. Another fine offering from Revolution in any case."
"O - Really great beer. I destroyed my glass of this and went back for more."
"A few weeks before sitting down and enjoying a pint of this beer, I tried a flight of Revolution beers. This beer stood out to me for one reason: the finish. The first couple drinks finish almost totally clean like a good, dry red wine. There is a heavy roast and rye taste (the beer is 20% rye) but it does not bog the flavor or your taste buds down. About half way through to the last leg of the beer, you find that a roasty taste has built up in your mouth. If the glass was any bigger, you might find that the taste becomes too much but they have built the beer just right that you finish before you throw the towel in. This beer is a perfect first-beer-of-the-night because while it still has flavor and style, your palate washes clean with a glass of water."
"Beg borrow or steal to get some if you can. This is a beer worthy of seeking out."
"I had this both on tap and on cask at the brewpub...Pours a very dark brown with blood red highlights. A light tan head, poor lacing ok retention...The aroma is really sweet figs and rye, complex and intriguing...The taste is noting short of awesome and insanely awesome, malty caramel and dark fruits then out of nowhere awesome chocolate, roasted coffee and nuts, unreal...Thick and lasting feel, so easy to drink. By far the best beer Cibak has done to date, coming it coming."
