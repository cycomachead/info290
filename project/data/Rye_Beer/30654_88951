The more random Trillium beers I have the more I'm starting to think they are overrated unfortunately. I really doubt I will finish this entire 750ml, as its not really enjoyable, more of a chore to drink.","jlindros","Jan 18, 2015"

At first it was a decent beer, but as time went on it got much better. I have a feeling this is better on bottle than draft. Glad to get to try something from Trillium. Very much looking forward to the next.","RblWthACoz","Jul 04, 2014"

I may have appreciated this more if if it came in a smaller size, but a bomber just seemed a bit much. Worth a try, just did not do it for me.","tigg924","Jun 16, 2014"

4.11,7.9,3.75,4.5,4,4,4,"O: A very interesting beer. Enjoyable. Food-friendly. Paired well with Neapolitan-style pizza. That said, I get more "rye beer" out of this one than I do "Farmhouse ale" as there is much more rye character than there is yeast character. A fine beer none-the-less.","Florida9","May 09, 2014"

4.27,12.1,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Overall (4.25/5): Wakerobin is a really interesting spin on the farmhouse/saison ale style. Everything seems to work in perfect balance. The marriage of Saison yeast and rye malt provides a great foundation. The moderately bitter, piney hops work well as a complimentary flavor. And the turbinado sugar helps bring out some subtle dark fruit flavors and help boost the mouthfeel's creaminess. A really good beer that I would love to have again.","hagbergl","Apr 24, 2014"

3.81,0,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"The beer pours a lasting and creamy off white that takes a while to dissipate. The beer itself is a clear copper color with hints of brown. The beer smell has strong rye notes with earthy and floral hops. The smell has notes of apple and cinnamon. Other notes exist such as spices and herbs. The beer taste is less complex. The rye and the hops are the dominant notes that come out. The other notes such as apple and herbs and spices are present but not as noticeable. The texture is medium bodied with biting carbonation and drinks smoothly. A pretty decent rye beer.","HattedClassic","Sep 29, 2013"
