"Pours a clear amber producing 3 fingers of somewhat lasting, beige, foamy head that leaves motes & streaks of lacing. Aroma is dark malt, a little brown sugar, rye spice & a slightly sour note in a fruity/juicy, leafy floral, pineapple, light citrus & pine background. Taste is malty, lightly boozy, brown sugary sweet with heavy rye spice, tropical fruit, orange/tangerine citrus hints. Finish is caramel/honey sweetness & rye spice that becomes a hop/alcohol bitterness & dryness in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied, medium carbonation, a little syrupy but creamy, lightly prickly & lively with rye spice."

"A smoother approach to an RIPA. Up there with Hop Rod Rye & Bittersweet Lenny."

"Prost!"

"Beer pours a dark copper color. With mild sediment. Great lacing, smell i get malts, hops, bread.  I do detect alcohol one the taste. Over all it's a good beer for 8.1% abv. If you like ryes you will most likely like this one."

"Very good, but a little ""hot"" on the alcohol"

"What a great Beer."
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer to drink for a while."
""
"Mostly full bodied, light effervescence. Warming too. Drinks a lot like a restrained IPA but without the slap upside the face from the resin."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very solid offering and I will definitely pick some more up either next year, or sooner if I can find it."

"O - Generally, I am always a bit concerned about rye ales, because I am not a huge fan of rye breads, but it is amazing how different the two can be.  This suggests a spicy DIPA, more than anything, and it is a tasty and well-balanced one, too."
""
""
""
"Slightly opaque orangey apricot colored with an oatmeal colored head that settles slowly.  Aroma of bready malt, ripe fruit, piney hops, orange rind, dark bread, and alcohol.  A bit of alcoholic solvent vapors which detract.  Full mouthfeel, a bit tingly.  Decent beer overall, not my fave from ST."

" O: a solid beer nothing really stands out on this beer not even the rye Southern Tier makes straightforward solid beers like GLBC but unless it's the backwater series nothing stands out "
""

"Overall: A pretty good take on a Rye beer. Good balance of juicy hop notes with caramel malt with the rye adding a nice kick."

"Overall: This brew is very enjoyable! It comes off as a Rye IPA vs a Rye Beer. Is this one of those beers that a brewer throws in as a curve ball to keep you guessing on the style? If so, I like it! There isn't any really negative things to say about this brew. Back to Basics, this brew is Recommended!"

"I enjoyed this beer, but am not sure what I got.  I have no reason to believe I got the wrong beer as I did see the pour from the tap.  I definitely need another shot at this, because if the next one equals this one, I could up my rating."
""
""
""
""
"Great rye. Nice hearty and rustic tones on it. Consistent flavor. Easy drinker. If you are looking for a regular rye to go to, this would definitely be one to consider."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a mild disappointment. Rye brews have grown on me lately, but this example doesn't quite meet the standard numerous others have. Still, a solid brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - of the 5-10 rye beers I've tried to date this might be the most delicate and best for a newcomer. - 4"
""
""
"Overall:  This is an interesting beer and I wish I liked it more but I am not a fan of the rye flavors being this dominant and clashing with the hops; worth a try as I always tip my hat to a brewer who decides to try something different"

"BOD 8/31/13.  Clear light amber pour with a slight dark ruby cast.  Massive head with exceptional lacing and retention.  Nice, but somewhat subtle, nose of caramel and rye over a spicy background. Heavy medium body with a nice oily creamy texture.  Well carbonated with a nice effervescent finish.  Even at one year of age, the flavor profile is outstanding with a complex balance.  It begins with a spicy character that flows to nice rye notes. In the middle, caramel sweetness flows into a light hop flavor blend (dank, pine and citric) and light bitterness.  The finish is long and leaves you with a nice rye spiciness over hop notes and bitterness.  Even aged, this one is up there with the best."

"The taste does bring out a touch of those rye grains but this is really about the hops in my opinion.  Floral, citrus, bitter hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"12oz. bottle: this one pours a clear, lighter amber color. There was a small off-white head that didn’t linger long or leave any lacing. Surprisingly lighter aroma for an 8% beer. Some sweet malts, a hint of rye and a hint of spices. The taste is good, but not too exciting. Malts, with just a hint of sweetness. A touch of the rye and spices. Good, but could be better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"So, my basic proclamation is this - this is an IPA for people who don't like IPAs! I will be seeking out other rye IPAs to compare!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste / Palate: There is a big full bodied malty base with a good mix of bready sweetness and spice up front. This is quickly balanced with solid hop bitterness and orange like citrus hop flavor notes."

"O - gotta look for a fresh one next fall and try it then. Hopefully I can revise this review. Not bad as is, but I bet it's much better before the hops have faded."

"Overall its a good rye beer check it out if thats your thing."

"Southern Tier does less wrong than the Pope - they are the Bishop of New York state microbreweries and a leader of the nationwide craft beer revolution. They've been a favourite of mine since I first discovered craft beer and, to this day, I find their seasonals so good as to warrant cross-border trips. 2XRye made the last run especially worthwhile."
"Overall this was a very good IPA. I would certainly love to try them again."

"Good, well rounded beer. Pours with a deep head. The aroma is bright and citrusy. The body is pretty well carbonated and has a nice body, not too light. The first thing I taste is the citrus flavor, and a second or two later a fair bitterness. It's not too hoppy but is balanced by the tangy rye flavor. Nothing is overwhelming but complement each other. Nice balance. Overall a pretty enjoyable beer. Nothing unique, but nicely executed."
""
""
""
"Almost more of an IPA, decent beer non the less."
"O: I really enjoyed this one, even if each individual category wasn't particularly remarkable (i.e. 4.25+). This beer's qualities seem to really complement each other well, in a way that reminds me of Bell's Two Hearted and Ballast Point Sculpin. Well crafted and definitely something I'll keep an eye out for in the future."
"Always love southern tier."
"Overall, our favorite aspect of this beer is its robust dedication to the rye base through the flavoring. The taste remains flushed with rye at every turn, taking the form of the savory, the bitter, and the sweet. It mixes well at each of these stops with the surrounding fruit, hops, and medicinals, keeping things warm, hearty, and pleasant. This is really a fantastic brew. It is different enough from not only their stock, but of the entire local upstate NY stock, making it a stand out on numerous levels, all while keeping it heavy enough to appeal to people seasonally. It is also kind of a blend between the dark and the light, and with hoppy enough brightness to appeal to the hop heads alike. Their best “2X” to date."

"Pours a nice copper color, very little head, slightly hoppy odor. Taste is malty with a surprising amount of hops. First experience with a double rye, wasn't really what I expected. Didn't have as much rye flavor as I was looking for. Don't know if this is common for this variety of beer or not."
""
"My aggro pour created just better than a finger of dense, tawny head with good retention. Color was a button-bright, beautiful coppery-amber (SRM = > 13, < 17). Nose had a big black pepper and peppermint bite and my mouth was already beginning to water at the prospect of this one! Mouthfeel was silky smooth and the minty pepperiness was like a celebration on my poor, aching tongue. The finish left me literally breathless, like I had been drinking mouthwash, in terms of its intensity. I was minty fresh and so was this beer. The lacing that began to form in the glass was beautiful and sticky and I found myself not worrying about getting it off."
""
""
" The taste is good with nice maltiness fromthe rye with mild hop flavors backing it up with a slight toasted and woody combo with light citrus in the background and nice level of spice with a gentle alcohol taste in the finish. Overall this is pretty decent, not quite a rye Ipa, but strong and has good rye malt taste, I would drink this again."
""

"Overall, an ok beer but it is lacking quite a bit in terms of flavor and aroma. Not really worth going out of your way for."
""
""
""
""
""
"The combination of a very attractive looking two tone orange amber body, and a nice two finger thick, beige head looked very inviting upon pour. The aroma was quite a lovely mix of floral rye and citric hops. The taste was heavy on the grains, with sour, spicy flavor given off by the rye, which was counterbalanced by citric hops and a bit of nuttiness from roasted grains. The finish was prickly in its feel, as the rye was allowed to rule the roost. The beer felt very dry and lean as well, with not a lot of sticky coating. Very nice burps after a few sips. I like the amount of rye shown off here."
""
""
""
"Little under two fingers of tan foam, islands of larger bubbles break up an otherwise even surface, peters out to a thick accretion along the glass edges, the lacing is broad and gluey, in some spots covers everything from liquid surface to top rims. Very clear, to the point of almost diminishing its color, coppery orange to lighter red, more orange to yellow at rims and glass bottom, sluggish bubbles. Straightforward nose, crisp and openly knit, sweet orange to pink grapefruit zest, the rye comes through easily, however, it still has a somewhat creamy texture in the nostrils, mixed sweet grains, light pepperiness, strong underlying maltiness, ripe peach to nectarine fruit scents, maybe banana as well, just hangs pregnantly like a rain cloud. In the mouth it is medium-bodied, soft and fluid but not creamy, the rye has an edge and that peppery quality is spotlighted. Grapefruit, lemon citrus, pine, wildflowers and a flourish of milk chocolate and caramel as it goes down the chute. The carbonation is not steady, more an irregular pulse but on the whole keeps the beer inclined towards dryness. Leaves a metallic earthiness behind as residue. Good drinkability and could see putting back 2-3 of these in a sitting, which is likely on the high end for this type of beer per se."

"This one is a winner."

"O - nice strong rye ale with good complexity. Glad to try it."
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and an above average example of the style, it had just enough rye flavors but it didn't seem like the rye was bold enough to live up to the 2X name. This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, crisp clean, not too filing and the taste did a decent job at holding my attention, I think a couple of these would be the right amount for me. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and aroma, they were both pretty good, but I really liked the balance and the hop profile in the aroma. What I liked the least about this beer was the taste, it was still nice, but I thought the rye and especially the hops could have shown up more like they did in the aroma. I don't think I would buy this beer again, for a seasonal Rye Beer I would rather have a Ruthless Rye. I would recommend this to Rye Beer fans, but I don't think it's a stand out in the style. All in all I thought this beer was solid, but if the taste was as good as the aroma then this would be a pretty damn good beer, I think with a little tweaking it could live up to it's potential. This beer doesn't make me like Southern Tier anymore, but it doesn't make me like them any less either, it's kind of right in the middle."

"O: A very nice rye beer. It showcases the rye very well without getting too overboard with it. Polished enough and smooth in texture, it makes for a very drinkable big beer."
"O - A very sessionable rye beer. At 8% the alcohol is not noticeable. My only complaint is I wish the rye was more present."
""
"After having a couple world-class ryes in the past few weeks, this brew just doesn't stand up. Pretty good, just not my speed."
"Overall – A quite tasty and easy drinking moderately hopped rye. At 8.1 % abv and being so easy drinking and enjoyable, this one is a bit dangerous but regardless is very nice overall."
""
"Smooth dry start, to the taste, with a light and sweet finish. Subtle rye and hops add to a slight bitterness. An interesting brew but a bit short of what I expected for a double rye."
"O- a nice ale. Nothing really pops but it is really good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Lots of spicy rye hops but I would have loved more rye bread taste. This tastes like a slightly above average imperial ipa with lots of citrus. Not bad, but nothing that distinguishes it from the pack of other hoppy rye beers."
"On the fuller end of medium body with a stronger rye presence than the nose hinted at. Spicy and peppery rye dominates the flavor up front but is quickly complimented by dry, earthy hop bitterness that lingers through the finish. Dry, sticky hops are very bitter with grass, pine needle and spruce tip flavor. As it warms, the malts become more prominent with caramel sweetness, toffee, dark fruit, bread and biscuit. The high ABV is well masked making this beer easier to drink than it should be. Complex and well balanced but the hops interfere with rye spiciness a bit too much for my preference. I would have preferred if it was heavier on the rye with a subtle earthy hop presence. Unfortunately it was the other way around. Still, this beer was interesting and an enjoyable drink. I haven't been a big fan of the 2X Series but this one was decent."
""
""
""

"A good package rye beer. 2X series is wearing me out a little bit with all of the fortified strength, this one has it's ""chore-like"" tendencies."

"Ok beer, love the rye component, but the hops were severely lacking for a DIPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very good rye IPA that rivals Founders Red's rye in my opinion."
""
"Appearance is golden with brilliant clarity. Head settles quickly and leaves sparse lace. Nose is resinous wih heavy pine, earth, and rye spiceness. Taste is quite resinous like the nose with a fair amount of pine needles paired with bread, rye, and a bitter kick at the finish. Mouthfeel is light and well carbonated. Overall, this was a pleasant surprise, very freh and hoppy."
""
""
"Showcases the rye well. Balanced, well-hopped and easy drinking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: not quite an outstanding beer but damn near close. Glad I picked this one up."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I’d take a 2XRye over the legendary 2XIPA any day: it’s insanely drinkable with a full, complex malt character that’s not overwhelmingly sweet. Let’s hope this stays a seasonal for a while."
""
""
"Overall: Some rye, but not as much as others. I could still notice it and it balanced out with everything out in the beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A great change of pace for pale ale drinkers. This is a fairly balanced and tasty rye based ale that showcases the spicy and grainy rye character with slight peppery character, but balances with bright pine hop notes."
""
""
""
"Overall: a refreshing rye beer that is well balanced and easy to consume. Very enjoyable."
""
"This has a really soft feel that doesn't detract from the medium body, and a very nice creaminess that coats the tongue without being slick. It works off a crispness that leads right into the velvety texture."
""
"price point - $1.67/12 oz single"

"O: Overall it wasn't my favorite rye beer or anything, but it was pretty good. I can't really put my finger on it but it just didn't win me over. I wouldn't turn down a pint but I wouldn't go nuts looking for it. It has the added benefit of being over 8% without tasting like alcohol, so that might be something to consider if you're a fan of imperial versions of beer styles. If that is the case, then I would definitely recommend trying it out. If you're just a rye fan, really it just provides your standard rye beer flavors."
"Overall a pretty good rye, not one that is so complex it warrants a full review. The color was not as deep as I would expect from a rye. The mouthfeel was refreshing, but rather ordinary. One thing I need to point out is I cannot believe it is 8%...for a stronger beer, it is very very drinkable. Not boozy at all, and quite refreshing. Heck, I might put down a few of these tonight, cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not much in the aroma department, but this is a complex and tasty double IPA style beer. The rye adds some thing to flavor profile, possibly to mouthfeel as well. Nice job STBC."
"This is a really great take on 2XIPA. For rye lovers, this is a great beer to try."
""
"This is a very nice, robust rye beer!"
""
""
"O: This is a great addition to the fall lineup for ST. I'd prefer a slightly heavier body to make it feel more like an autumn seasonal, but otherwise it's really nice. Rye and hops go together like peanut butter and jelly, I just can't get enough of this combination!"
"O: No complaints and recommended for a rye beer."
""
""
""
"Overall, the rye malt really lends a stubbly-smooth sweetness to this beer, which is balanced nicely by the extra hops. It's incredibly quaffable for the %abv. Really, without the hops, this beer would taste like a cloying rye doppelbock or something. I love when Southern Tier breaks the rules, and this is another great example."
"I'm not a rye fan. I expected to dislike this beer, but the rye bitterness is not as overwhelming as in some rye beers, and there's enough hop flavor complexity and depth of character in the malt to keep my interest."
"The marriage of hops and rye seem to elevate both with an effortless taste and spicy bite. Although the ale is dangerously drinkable for its high ""2X"" potency, I really wish the ale had delivered on its IPA promises and finish with the acidic bitterness that was expected."
""
""
"This is definitely a unique beer. It is huge and over the top but completely drinkable. Another Southern Tier triumph."
""
""
""
""
"OV: A solid brew. At 8% you can't call this sessionable, but it drinks like it is as the body is on the lighter side and the flavours are mellow. This goes down rather easy, too easy for an 8%er. I like the flavours, just wish they were more pronounced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-it's not a terrible beer, but it isn't something I'll probably want again anytime soon. It's really rather boring. Definitely a fair example of they're style."
"Amber in color with an orange hue and perfect clarity. Poured with a short white foam that quickly reduced to a soapy cap. Slightly pungent, ripe citrus hop and rye malt aromas with a touch of booze at the back end. Medium bodied with a slick oily feel that pushes the carbonation to the edges. Intense ripe citrus hop flavors from start to finish. Rye and sweet caramel malt flavors push through the hoppiness from the middle to the end. Finishes with a lingering citrus hop and bready rye aftertaste. Not terribly complex, but damn good."
""
"Overall, a very good, tasty rye ipa, hard to believe the strength is where it is as the flavors really come through nicely."
""
"Southern Tier has made another terrific beer . Brisk, friendly and positively carefree."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- I was pumped for this being that I love ST and rye beers in general, and this is tasty. Really fits the weather right now and is damn tasty. Maybe not the best rye beer out there but a must try for rye fans."
""
""
"O: If the whole modus operandi was to showcase the rye flavors first and foremost, I'd definitely say they succeeded. While not the most complex, it's definitely a very good rye ale, and one where I wouldn't have regretted picking up a 6-pack of this."
""
""
"O: Good. Different."
""
""
"This one was awesome, and a worthy entry into the 2X series."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Nice hoppy red ale with rye. I wish it had a little more oomph, as there is not much bitterness or spiciness to combat the malts and the surprisingly sweet hops. Still, definitely worth trying."
""
""
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 8/21/2013. Pours fairly crystal clear orange copper color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, orange zest, lemon zest, tangerine, pineapple, pine, floral, grass, rye, caramel, bread, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of hop notes with moderate malt balance; and good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, orange zest, pineapple, floral, grass, pine, rye, caramel, bread, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, pineapple, floral, grass, pine, rye, caramel, bread, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of hop flavors; with a moderate malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice imperial rye IPA. All around nice balance and complexity of hop and malt flavors; and very smooth to drink for the ABV. Not as much rye flavor as I was expecting; but this was still a very enjoyable offering."
""
"Overall I'm a big fan of rye beers and this is another tasty offering. Great hop flavor that doesn't overpower a solid rye base. Worth a try by any fan of beer."
""
""
""
"Great drinker...like I said drinks like a pale ale to me....no booziness at all....very enjoyable.."
""
"12 ounce bottle, DOB 08/21/13. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear orange/amber color with about an inch off-white head that sticks around for a while. There's also a good amount of lacing. The brew smells like rye, pine and citrusy (tropical fruit, grapefruit) hops, and some bready malt. I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also an earthy/herbal flavor noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and coating with moderate carbonation. I think this is a solid brew, I liked it. $10.99 a 6-pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a nice beer from Southern Tier. I was hoping for a bit more rye, but it's well crafted and enjoyable. I like it. It's definitely worth checking out."
