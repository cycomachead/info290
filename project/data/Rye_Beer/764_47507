3.5,-6.2,,,,,,"I guess expecting a very potent rye flavor in a beer with rye in the name was something I should have tempered given Bluepoint's reputation? Had this on cask, and was expecting a more pronounced rye aroma and bite. Not a bad beer at all, but I've had other beers with rye in the wort which expressed the character of this grain in a much more forward fashion. The aftertaste leaves a pleasant bitterness and earthy spice that hints at rye but I wanted it more front and center.","dd43","Nov 27, 2014"

The nose comprises lightly-toasted rye bread, mild caramel, and a smattering of earthy greens. The taste brings in more of the same, though with a twinge of quinine in there for not-so-good measure. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a decent enough rye beer, but one that goes a touch sideways on the tongue.","TMoney2591","Aug 04, 2013"

The flavor is a little bit different than the aroma. At first you get a nice toasted malt and peppery rye flavor, but then it fades into a rather sweet floral hop flavor. Not getting the bitterness that I had expected. It's there, but more sweet than bitter. Feel is medium body and a bit syrupy. My favorite beer style; And although it is tasty, the bit of syrupy sweetness does just knock it down a notch. But you might expect that with the higher gravity. Still a solid rye beer though.","Kromes","Aug 18, 2012"

It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. I thought I had smelled rye in a beer before, but this one kicked me in the face with it. Definitely one of the most intense rye smelling brews I have had to-date. The flavor was a little more subtle on the rye execution allowing more complex flavors to come out. While it was more complex it wasn't necessarily blended very well. The metallic flavor was killed the flavor on the brew for me if I had to pick one.

In the mouth, surprisingly tasty compared to nose. Malt up front, slightly bready, with a definite spiciness. A friend said it tasted of unprocessed wheat but I didn’t get much “rye.” Definitely a pleasant, semi-sweet spiced flavor that is enjoyable. Moderate hops presence evens things out. Mouth his smooth and viscous, fitting to this beer’s character. Overall, pretty tasty in its own right. This is my first “rye” ale so I’m not sure what to make of it.

Popping the top I get a very heavy malt smell with molasses and some floral hopping. On the pour I get a bright orange bronze with a heavy thick head that stands firm and laces as it only very gradually recedes. On the taste this brew hits you first with the mouthfeel, as it is as thick as it smells. I think you could stand a spoon in it. The taste then hits, very balanced with a huge malt backbone and some tarty citrus underlying hop bitterness that stays steady throughout. Taste is very consistent throughout, sweet malts and bitter hoppiness with the finish being a little bit sweeter and with an earthy rye-like tone. This brew is nothing complex but hits right between the eyes. I will seek out again.","mooseisloose","May 04, 2011"

Also has a sweet smell that reminds of caramel comes through faintly. The flavors as with the aroma of this brew are very good. I have not had many rye beers in the past but so far I am impressed. Nice malt character with the rye spice, it is the rye which really makes this beer IMO, as it mixes well with the base malts which seem to give a flavor similar to what I noticed in the aroma.

No alcohol apparent. If I didn't know better, I'd session it and get in big trouble. Very well done, jumps to the top of my Blue Point list.","CharlatanSin","Jan 10, 2010"
4.12,10.5,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good. I enjoyed this one a lot and usually enjoy rye beers.

3.73,0,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1 1/2" beige head over the clear dark amber brew. Ultra-dense head lasts and lasts, with heavy coating lace. Aroma is soapy spiciness. Taste starts with lemony sweetness, spices in the middle, and moderate piney hoppiness to close. Mouthfeel is soft and smooth, and drinkability is pretty good. Wish it was a bit more chewy, but not a bad brew.","ppoitras","Dec 24, 2009"
4.12,10.5,4,4.5,4,4,4,"From the bomber into the pint glass at room temperature this baby shows a light, clear copper color with a big off-white, almost oatmeal colored head and decent lacing. The aroma is pretty herbal hops and butterscotch caramel, vanilla custard bread pudding, yummy. The flavor comes on with all the above and a bit of alcohol with toasted almond. At first I pick up a little metallic touch but it quickly gave way to sweet rye and toffee. Although this isn't thick or oily in feel, it is definitely creamy and dangerously drinkable despite the alcohol presence at 7.5%. Smooth, fairly unique with complex flavor and a tastefully carbonated brew. Quite a hit from Blue Point.","Durge","Dec 24, 2009"
3.78,1.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Carbonation is just a tad high for me but is still very drinkable. This bottle went down smooth and fast. No hint of the 7.5% ABV, drinks like it is in the mid 4's","weatherdog","Dec 15, 2009"
3.26,-12.6,4,3,3,4,3.5,"Overall, another hoppy rye beer that delivered on its description. Nothing against this beer or hoppy ryes in general, but it would be nice to see some US breweries begin to experiment with rye beers that aren't so hop-focused.","OrangeCharlie","Dec 14, 2009"
3.85,3.2,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Dark copper color, off white head with occasional lacing. Smells of floral hops with citrus and caramel notes. Spicy and warming, without overpowering floral notes. Noted a hint of lavender, sage, and orange peel along with warmth from the malted rye. Hoppy bitterness lingers in the mouth. Nice hint of piny bitterness that finishes sharply and dry. Caramel sweetness is more apparent as hop blast fades. Medium body and carbonation.","billzee","Dec 08, 2009"
3.7,-0.8,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Has a creamyness to it that is enjoyable. Somewhat of a refreshing beer, medium bodied. Taste lingers on the back of the tounge for a few minutes. Overall a decent beer would get another if it crosses my path again.","Blitzstyle","Beers"
4.09,9.7,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"The nose was at once floral with hops, somewhat grassy, as well as spicy from the rye. Color was a lightly cloudy medium amber. The head was simply wisps, the result of a gravity pour, vice hand pump. Mouthfeel was silky, rubbing gently along the tongue like a cat against one's legs. There was a mild, pleasant bitterness on the tongue, followed by the (now) expected rye bit on the finish. To paraphrase Cab Calloway, It just ain't right if it ain't got that bite. Thx, Sopor!","woodychandler","0"
3.94,5.6,3,4,4.5,4,3,"Texture is velvety without quite being "smooth". Bottom line, this is an intense, heavy beer, and one of the best Blue Points I've had. Can't say I comprehend the flavor effect of rye malt, though I think this is my first encounter with it.","whahoppened","Dec 07, 2009"
2.87,-23.1,2.5,3,2.5,4,3,"Poured an amber brownish color into an American pint glass, with nearly zero head or lacing. Smelled of sweet orange, very little malt, and very very feint caraway seeds. Tasted of syrupy sweet oranges and pineapples, with nearly no rye essence whatsoever, and no malt balance either. Medium-bodied, with a decent carbo presence. Drinkable? Not really, by my standards. One of the more overrated beers I've tried in a long time. If you want a truly superb 'rye beer', visit a Triumph Brewery (NJ/PA). Despite the chain association, that place's best beer hands down is their rye beer, and quite possibly it could be the best rye beer I've ever had.","donniecuffs","Dec 07, 2009"
3.75,0.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"The drink is medium-full bodied and slickish in feel, and to be more my liking would probably benefit from just a spritz more carbonation. A pretty easy drinker nonetheless.","cvstrickland","Dec 06, 2009"
3.5,-6.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability: To me this tastes like a slightly above average pale ale. The rye is not overly pronounced. Not a bad beer, but I have had better ryes. Could have two max.","tigg924","Dec 03, 2009"
3.9,4.6,4,4,4,4,3.5,"The taste is typically rye. There is a dry, slightly biting, non hop bitterness, a bready underneath, and just very little sweetness present. The beer has the bitterness and sourdough character of seeded rye bread. There is a slightly bitterish minty flavor on the back end. Again, there is no sweetness or real hop bitterness to the beer, just biting malts from the rye. There is a touch of hop leaf in the finish, once the beer settles a bit, and it may account for some of that minty taste I'm getting. The aftertaste is quite dry too. This is good for the style, which may not be to everyone's taste.","albern","Dec 03, 2009"

A bit yeasty and hoppy on the taste, but not as hoppy as the Bear Republic Rye Beer. Mouthfill was excellent due to the perfect carbonation.

Some spicy rye in the nose, a pungent and bitter hop aroma and a sweet biscuity malt back round. Spicy and hop forward with a balancing malty sweetness mid palate moving long on to the finish. Not bad, a rye-PA with a true rye character. Worth a shot.","ATPete","Oct 26, 2009"
4.03,8,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"D: At 7.5% ABV, this could be a dangerous session brew. But where is the alcohol hiding? This rye beer isn't exactly bursting with dextrose or stringent alcohol flavors. Would make a nice pick-up as a bomber and a must try on tap.","Gambrinus1184","Oct 12, 2009"
3.83,2.7,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"A hoppy fruity peach citrus tasting cask that worked well on cask, which came in at 7.25% a.b.v. Fruity colour, with rye to add complexity. Caramel brings up the mouthfeel. A spot of sour. Drinkabilty is good. Good balance. Nice for the style, seek it out.","Sammy","Oct 08, 2009"
3.73,0,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Appearance is a copper color with a decent sized head with a light brown hue to it. Smell contains yeast, fruit, some hops. Taking a sip of rastafar rye, I taste a doughy bread flavor, that is followed by hops and a spice finish. Mouthfeel contains more of the same, with that spice lingering along with some of the aforementioned fruit. Drinkability is just above average, the abv does present itself and with the spice and dryness of how it finishes, one bomber of rastafar alongside a meal is all I need.","mltobin","Oct 01, 2009"
4,7.2,4,4,4,4,4,"D: Very good. All-in-all an enjoyable rye beer, with the rye playing more than a supporting role. I like Bear Republic's Hop Rod Rye better, but there's nothing wrong with this.","Kendo","Oct 01, 2009"

3.88,4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"On cask at Tap and Table in Emmaus, PA, $5 for a pint. Appeared a slightly hazy amber-red with a low head. The aroma was a simple caramel with a hint of oxidation. The flavor, however, takes that same caramel and follows with a good punch of crushed pepper and spice. The rye really kicks in for the aftertaste, very nice. This beer does a great job of the malted rye. Thank you Blue Point.","tempest","Sep 20, 2009"
3.68,-1.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Overall, sweet and spicy face off pretty nicely here. The hops and rye aren't surprising, but definitely pleasant and assertive, while the crystal malt lends enough to leave it quite balanced. A little bready; I would love to have more aggression here from the rye. But that wouldn't be very Rasta-like would it?","BretSikkink","Sep 19, 2009"

I get huge aromas of hop and rye here, very well balanced. The hops are citrusy and juicy. Taste brings out the nice rye flavorings, bold and bready, a bit on the spicy side as well. This taste almost like rye bread dipped into a huge pot of grapefruit and oranges. Hops blend almost perfectly to the rye in the taste. Mouthfeel is decently carbonated, and very firm on the tongue. I get a good amount of bitterness here from the hops as well. Overall, drinkability is high, ABV is very well hidden and goes down like your traditional IPA. one of the best offerings I've had from Blue Point, and one of the better Rye beers out there.

3.6,-3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a clear, visibly effervescent light amber color with a full finger loose foamy head that resists fading. Sheets of Belgian lacing left in the wake of each mouthful compensate for the overly light color. The smell is unusually light and hoppy for the style, but the grainy rye element is distinct over the notes of citrus. Highly carbonated, the mouth is tangy, bright and light bodied. Full flavored, the flavor is hoppy lemon and grainy. A reasonable drinker. Happy 10th!!","jjayjaye","Beers"
3.83,2.7,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,"Rastafa rye ale poured out with a sharp golden color with some dark yellow filling in the gaps. A beautiful white head came up with some vigor but was short lived, leaving a small cap. Nice spots of lacing rings. The smell was decent and low with a small hop build. Malts are the focus with some bisquit like smell. Only picking up a bit of rye. This needs something more. The taste is a nice mix of bready malt first then some flavoring hops which were light and grassy mixed in with some grain. I've had better and more pronounced "rye" beers. The feel is pretty much in the middle with a touch of carb. It went down crazy easy without a hitch. The alcohol is a bit high but I did not pick up any. I could of drank the whole bomber easy.","BARFLYB","0"

3.88,4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"A 22 ounce bomber bottle purchased at Abe's in Bethlehem for around $5. Out of the bottle and into my nonic Imperial pint glass. The ale appears a crystal clear golden yellow color with at least two fingers of bone white head. Not much head retention, but it manages to leave behind a thin lace on the inside of my glass with each sip. Nose and flavor consist of a very pronounced peppery spiciness, followed by notes of light to medium toasted grains, bready, a touch of caramelized malts, the spiciness comes back into play. Finish is super dry with a fading bitterness. The ale falls between medium and full bodied with adequate carbonation. Did I mention the dry finish? A decent attempt by Blue Point. I had no problem finishing the bomber.","ClockworkOrange","Aug 01, 2009"
3.96,6.2,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"If I see this on tap I'll certainly try it out, but at $5 a bomber, this certainly isn't a great value beer, and it drinks much more like a six pack beer than one that belongs in a bomber. But, part of the proceeds go to a charity benefiting underprivileged children in the Caribbean, so you can feel good about that.

It tasted like lots of spicy rye and copper hops, with some roasted barley and sour yeast. It was fairly thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this had a great spicy rye character, with a great body. It had no real noticeable alcohol either, and it wasn't too bitter, so it was perfectly easy to drink.

I love reggae music, this beer does some justice to the vibrations that the riddim brings. Appears a clear caramel copper hue in my glass with a bright white head. Nice even layers of lace line my pint glass. Aromatics offer up spice layers of hops and rye, with a carmel malt base. Pretty straight forward creation blended nicely with a biscuit dough yeast note. Flavor wasn't as rye spice as the nose but did contain some grassy herbal citric hops with the caramel malt and bread dough finish. A nice pale ale with a creative name, try it if your out there sipping on some fine brews at a microbrew bar. Mouthfeel was medium bodied slick but not oily with hops, carbonation moderate. Definitely carried it well.

The taste is of a slighty sour malt, with a touch of rye and a light honey graham cracker malt. Not much hop detected. Moderate body with plenty of fizzy carbonation, sweet but no where near cloying.
