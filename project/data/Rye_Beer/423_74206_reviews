"i like this idea of the tasting room series, it has brought us some great beers already, and allows some of the more raw stuff they do to hit our lips, which i like, because sometimes boulevard is overly polished. this one pours somewhere between caramel and brown, with some sediment at the bottom of the bottle but other than that mostly clear. the head is tan and frothy, but shortish lived. i smells a weird tang, which the label says comes from rye, but to me its almost tannic, and the finish of the beer agrees with that, almost off, but the middle is so good. caramel malt and chocolate malt (light), and the rye, which takes on more of a dried fruit here than a spice, again the tang. yeast is english it seems, doughy and hanging around in the finish, which is off dry. well made no doubt, but definitely in need of some tweaks to be perfect. i love the grain flavor, think its awesome, but maybe the sparge temperature or something is a little too warm. those tannins arent amazing in the finish, but i like the base flavor a whole lot, and think it fits the fall season super well. underrated overall i think..."

"A decent drinking if rather unexciting beer. The rye punch comes through in the taste primarily yet the beer, on whole, seems rather bland and watery, at least initially. The smell was pretty faint and hard to pickup on although it is there. Subsequent sips reveal a bit more depth with the malt base and rye, so it can (does) grow on you. With a 30% rye grain bill, I expected a bit more rye oomph."

"As warms the rye shows stronger with a crackling quality, which is fun."

"Picked this up as part of mixed 12 pack from Boulevard. Oustanding appearance on the beer, thick and murky looking with a great head that just grabs the glass as it dissipates, beautiful. Not much to offer the nose but very tasty, Good but not great, I enjoyed this one very much and would have no problem having it again. Might not seek it out but would gladly snag it as part of a mixed pack again."

"Pours a pretty amber brown in color with about a 1/2 finger off-white head. Lots of lacing was seen with each sip which was very surprising actually. The aroma isn't too heavy and is of some grains with a hint of citrus and floral hops. The taste is crisp and sharp with a hint of rye and wheat. Overall, it is different and isn't bad. Perfect carbonation."

"The taste brings out a better rye grain character than the nose and then there is a stronger caramel sweetness that kicks in and a fuller bitterness. But this all has to be taken it consideration with the bland aroma. It tastes better than the bland aroma suggests but does that make it better? Not especially. Ho-hum. OK."
"Pours a clear, brown color. One inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malt, citrus hops, hint of floral hops, and hint of pale malt. Fits the style of a rye beer. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with a high carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, hint of roasted malt, hint of pale malt, hops, hint of wheat, and a hint of rye. Overall, great appearance, decent body, but lacking in aroma and complexity."

"overall this would have to go down as a miss for me. the malt profile should be ratcheted up a few notches to compliment the rye used. for a rye inspired brew, this misses the target."

"Update: The beer did sweeten some as it warmed making it a little better...still a rye pale ale in my book...just sweeter...I bumped up my taste .25 and my overall .25...cheers!"

"O - I enjoyed this beer after dinner no complaints. But as this is in tasting room stage it might change so I might make another review, I could drink this often"
""
"An average Rye that seems well made but nothing groundbreaking. You could session this though."

"Overall - not bad for the price, but I wouldn't have if not in the mixed 12."

"I've had this a few times now, Not a huge fan of rye ale, but its a good beer, and seems to be a good beer to mix with food. Since this is in the ""tasting room"" stage.. I would probably NOT release this as a permanent option if I had the choice. I'm not sure what they'll do, but this wouldn't be something id buy a 12 pack of... One of those kind of beers that 2 or 3 is good... Not something I could drink on through the night... The taste is pretty bland, nothing special about this brew."

"Pours a slightly hazy mahogany with a tiny tan head. Aromas of cinnamon and dark bread. Taste begins with a bit of spicy rye, then some dark bread, then a bit of metal, followed by a clean bitter finish. Mouthfeel is a bit light. Overall though, it is a good beer, there are a few downsides here and there, but the final product is nice."
"O - Definately drinkable, but not much going on. Fairly bland. Was really hoping for more"
""
"O - decent rye beer but seemed to be missing something."
""
"Overall: A pretty solid take on a rye beer. Good toasty malt notes with a nice kick of rye spice."
""
""
"Overall: I like this beer. Don't know if I would buy it just buy itself. But for a sampler I was happy with it."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied. It is very dry."

"Pours out a dark maroon in color with an off-white head, two-fingers with good retention. Smell is is definitely malty with caremal, sweet dark fruits, and tiny bit of hops that are really in the background. The nose is fairly well balances but could use a little more hop profile. Taste is sweet caremal and everything in the nose. Nothing really spectacular but it works OK. Mouthfeel is sort of thick due to the carbonation for the style but nothing great. Overall, not a bad beer but nothing I would buy again."

"Looks good, feels good, but the smell and taste are significantly lacking. It just comes across as wanting for something more."
"Dark brown color with a nice thick fluffy tan head... Smell is of roast, candied fruit, slight hops not over powering... Slightly sweet, with some sour notes on the back of the tongue... malt/hop balance is nice.. Not usually a huge rye beer fan but this is pretty good and really easy to drink. Would buy a sixer if made available."

"Overall: Picked up a single to try, I used to have a lot of Boulevard when I lived in Missouri. This is pretty good, not a rye bomb, but a balanced pale ale with a moderate rye feel to it."
"Prickly carbonation, tangy rye graininess, mildly bitter aftertaste. Sort of one dimensional, but it has some distinctive rye flavor to it. Overall just ok."
""
"Overall: This what a pretty average rye beer if you want to call it that. Easy to drink, but I wax expecting spicy notes and a bit more hops."
"Ruddy amber with a trace head and no lacing. Smells of caramel, light pine resin. Taste is malty with biscuit and caramel. There is a mild hop bitterness some rye spice. Body is medium light. Overall this is a bit muddied in flavor. The carbonation is decent but really nothing worthwhile here."

"O I liked this very much. Boulevard, to me, has always made good beers and I flat out love some of their offerings, but this kicks it up a bit. This is the most quality brew I've had from them. The flavors blend so well. Sweet, dry, bitter and the rye is present but does not overtake everything. The best rye beer I've ever had."
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Really nice head, and thick lacing. Nose is sweet and pungent. Earthy roasted caramel, accentuated with some rye bread and tea leaf. Overall, this is a good quaff."

"The Westside Rye is a unbelievable rye session ale. I would drink this all-night. The beer poured a hazy amber with thin white head that is leaving a spotty lace. The scent is carries rye in the form of a wet corn meal. The taste is evenly balanced between malt and hop. The mouthfeel is medium in body with good carbonation. Overall this is a decent session ale...but there is a heinny/stella after taste...but overall it is tasty!"

"A run of the mill rye beer, nothing to see here..."
""

"A warm amber-brown, sticky khaki head that throws some nice lace. Peppery spicy rye is front and center. Other malt derived flavors include burnt toast, toffee, and biscuit. Hops are mild with a dirty herbal note that meshes with the rustic rye. Overall, some decent flavors going on, but it seems a bit diluted and even watery at times given the high percentage of rye. It just needs a little more. If you are going for something malt driven - give me a little more body. If you are going for dryness and drinkability - give me a little more in the way of hops."
""
""
""
"Overall- A good offering from Boulevard. This beer should become a regular in their lineup."
""
"Dark copper brown in color. Fingernail thin layer of foam rests upon the top. Good clarity. I definitely get the spiciness of the rye in the nose. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth. The front of the palate is definitely the rye, but it is quickly balanced with some hop flavor. Pretty straight forward, but a pretty good brew."

"I try not to bust the balls of any brewery on here, but I couldn't bite my tongue on this one. I have really come to love Boulevard's Smoke Stack Series and could care less for their year round for the most part. This one certainly doesn't belong in the former (or neither, hopefully). Kinda sad that the variety pack came with three of these."

"O: I love rye beer and this one is no exception spicy, malty but not overly sweet. Delicious!"

"On tap at the brewery tour, 7/5/2013. To be released in upcoming ""test"" sampler packs locally. Aimed to be a sessionable rye ale. Very pedestrian as far as a unique Boulevard offering goes. Very clearly a Boulevard Pale Ale base with some rye notes and perhaps a touch more hops in the process. The rye isn't featured prominently enough in my opinion. Wouldn't be one I'd rate highly in the new test sampler pack initiative."
"O - This was nice. Glad I got to try it."
