3.45,-9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Overall: Complex and interesting, if not terribly appealing. An unusual rye, for sure. Worth a try.","chinchill","Jun 03, 2012"

3.55,-6.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"O - I enjoyed this. The Cabernet added a nice touch, and mixed with the rye fairly well. The hops take a backseat at this point due to aging. Would definitely have again.","haazer","Beers"

3.86,1.8,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Overall this is a nice attempt at an Imperial Rye ale but I have to say I prefer my Rye beers to be less ABV heavy if that makes sense. The large malt bill dilutes the quality spice and flavor profile of the rye malt. Too much sweetness, breadiness and light caramel flavors are masking the rye. Not a bad beer but not one I will revisit anytime soon, especially because they aren't making it this year.","claspada","Mar 26, 2012"

3.77,-0.5,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall - Decent, but a little strange mixture of almost west coast piney hops along with the rye. Very different from other ryes out there, and thats good and bad. Dont care for the bubblegum flavor, it feels to artificial and a tad to sweet. Decent beer, worth a try atleast once.","wvsabbath","Mar 08, 2012"

3.92,3.4,4,4.5,3.5,4,4,"Overall: Lots of aroma and a good spice malt balance. Complex and strong but very drinkable; especially as the beer warms. It is actually quite smooth and mild.","plehnus","Nov 30, 2011"
4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Bottle: Poured a clear copper color ale with a nice huge foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of rye malt with light spicy notes and some warming alcohol is well balance and enjoyable. Taste is not the most complex but is quite enjoyable with good notes of rye malt with light sweetness and a spicy finish. Body is about average with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol though some warming notes can be felt. Simple and very much enjoyable.","Phyl21ca","Nov 23, 2011"

4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a hazy amber to orange-ish color with a tan head. In the aroma, dry fruitiness, especially apples. In the taste, dry rye, fruity, apples and spice. A small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry fruitiness and small alcohol in the aftertaste. Nice rye and fruit presence, a bit boozy in the end and in the aftertaste.","OWSLEY069","Nov 15, 2011"
3.52,-7.1,3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Flavor matches the smell profile with a touch of hop. Overall, this runs on the sweet side, which covers the alcohol until the swallow. Light warming aftertaste. Very rich body but it also has an above average level of carbonation. Borderline extreme with little rye to show for it.","smcolw","Beers"

3.88,2.4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"O - I really enjoy the Imperial IPA the most in the Leviathan Series and the first time I tried this particular Leviathan, I didn't particularly care for it (which was last year). Whether my palette changed or I previously had a bad bottle, it's really speaking to me this time around. This is a beer I would definitely buy more of and I have a feeling it might be fun to age a few bottles to see how it changes over time. This particular review has been updated since my previous entry in 2011.","jzeilinger","Oct 19, 2011"
3.58,-5.5,3.5,3,4,3.5,3.5,"O: a bit of an angry rye, smooth in the end but aggressive in the beginning, could have one or two but prolly wouldn't buy their four pack","BigPlay1824","Oct 17, 2011"
3.77,-0.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Overall: Too boozy in the finish. Otherwise a nice complex imperial rye.","kylehay2004","Oct 12, 2011"
3.65,-3.7,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The rust colored body was clear, and the head was one finger thick, and foamy. The aroma was honeyed and spicy, which I suppose was the result of the malted rye use. There was a lot of up front sweetness in the taste, with very caramelized tone mid palette. The finish was spicy, but nowhere near what it should be for a rye based beer. There was a citric hop presence, but not quite at the level one finds in IPAs. The finish was dry and on the lean side. The rye character in this beer was a bit too subdued for this to truly shine.","rajendra82","Oct 01, 2011"
4.2,10.8,4,4,4.5,4,4,"This beer makes me want to have a sandwich with some turkey, Swiss cheese, and some horseradish mustard and a piece of lettuce and tomato.","Duhast500","Sep 26, 2011"

3.91,3.2,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured a rich bronze with a one finger fluffy slightly off white head atop,the head never really settled,a frothy 1/2 finger mass was there thru the duration of the glass.Sweet alcohol and some of that spicy rye in the nose,a smattering of herbal hops comes into play as well.Alcohol and sharp rye dominate the palate wich it probably should with the alcohol in this beer,the spice and hops provide spice and citric flavors and the alcohol and malt base give off sweetness.Its a solid rye ale,the rye and hops play well against the big alcohol and malty sweetness.","oberon","Sep 17, 2011"

4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"O: Good stuff. A solid rye beer that puts the rye front and center. Bumped the overall score up b/c I was close to doing so in a couple of the categories. . ..","Kendo","Sep 14, 2011"
3.84,1.3,3,4,4,4,3.5,"Crisp medium body mouthfeel with a just a bit of dryness in the finish. Overall, Imperial Rye satisfies my love for Rye beers but nothing quite stands out. Solid beer and one I'll be sure to have again.","Kinsman","Sep 11, 2011"
4.12,8.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"a rich aroma with a hint of spice comes through on the nose right away. really nice blended notes of pine resin, warm malts, a nice touch of buttery middle and a touch of rye. really well done and this carries over to the flavor perfectly. smooth, effortless feel on this one delivers a light hoppy goodness with hints f spiced rye and buttery malts. nice clean finish","mikesgroove","Sep 03, 2011"
3.31,-12.7,4.5,3.5,3,4,3,"Overall: It just didn't do it for me. A simple-tasting brew with a surprisingly high ABV. Maybe it's waiting for the drunkenness to take effect to keep me from yawning.","ChainGangGuy","Sep 01, 2011"
4.38,15.6,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"d - Quite drinkable. I can see myself getting this again in the near future. A very good autumn brew!","jmerloni","Aug 31, 2011"
3.93,3.7,4.5,4,4,3,4,"O: Really enjoying this one. Other than the mouthfeel I really cannot complain about much. A rye beer with a ton of rye in it. Imagine that! Hope they make this again and drop the saison and barleywine and of course bring back Triticus!","aerozeppl","Aug 24, 2011"
4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, chewy, gummy, sweet, and bitter.","weeare138","Aug 13, 2011"
3.83,1.1,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"O- Really nice! It's a great change of pace from IPA's, Barleywines and darker brews that I usually drink. It has a nice candy sugar/bitter/spiciness that isn't the usual suspect. I love how Harpoon went out on a limb with this one.","Thickfreakness","Aug 06, 2011"
3.98,5,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Clear and coppery amber in colour with a thick cap of beige foam. Tons of lacing - sheets and streaks at the top of the glass - and great head retention. Looks nice! Sweet, malty aroma, a bit nutty and bready, caramel, mild piney and citrusy hops, faint alcohol. Bitterness was sturdy, but not prominent, with a bit of grassy character towards the finish. Bready malts, a hint of toffee, grain and nuts, slight citrus, mild caramel sweetness, slightly sugary, warming alcohol. Decent texture, full bodied and lowish CO2 without feeling too heavy, light grainy astringency. I enjoyed it and would certainly purchase it again.","DrJay","Aug 05, 2011"
4.61,21.6,5,4,5,4.5,4.5,"I love this beer. The appearance is like a glass of bourbon, well I had it in a low ball glass, but the caramel glow and color was amazing. Had a nice aromas, some spice, hop punch, and caramel. The flavor of this beer was phenomenal. Loved it. Loads of spicy rye, kinda of like a lower abs barleywine. Nice balanced hops,lots caramel. Everything balanced. The body was medium, not heavy at all. Loved this beer and I want it again. I have a hard time understanding the ratings so far.","CampusCrew","Aug 03, 2011"
3.47,-8.4,4,4.5,3,3.5,3,"D - Things start out promising with the aroma as there is a note of rye and caramel thickness behind some very nice, fresh hops that comes together in a way that is reminiscent of a hoppy barleywine. The flavor, sadly, just doesn't live up to the promise of the aroma. The malt is ok, but it has too much toasted character and not enough dark sugar. The real problem comes with the harsh bitterness that borders on becoming aspirin like in the finish. Harpoon makes some good beer, but the Leviathan series seems to be very hit and miss, and this one is a miss.","nickfl","Jul 28, 2011"
4.12,8.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Overall a decent big beer from Harpoon that will be stored away to see how the rest of the three offerings mature, it seems like a nice beer to experiment and age with. Although I did enjoy this bottle fresh just fine.","WVbeergeek","Jul 23, 2011"
4.31,13.7,3,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Makes me thing of a rye-centric, really well done ESB. Which I like.","donkeyrunner","Beers"
3.8,0.3,4,4,3.5,4,4,"another good beer from the Leviathan series. Not my favorite rye, nor my favorite of Harpoon's Leviathan series, but a welcome addition. Much better than the saison and barleywine they put out.","silentjay","0"
3.82,0.8,3,3.5,4,4,4,"D: Very good. 9% is easy on the palate, not too complex but at the same time has a lot to think about. Definitely a well brewed brew. One of my favorites out of the series. Love beer, love life, Harpoon.","YouSkeete","Beers"
4.36,15,5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"I like this. Unlike other rye-infused beers, this one seems to be all about the rye itself. I like it and you might as well. Try it.","Brad007","0"
