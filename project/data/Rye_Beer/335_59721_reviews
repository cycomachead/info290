"Overall - I was wanting to try this brew, but unfortunately the guy I got it from missed the bottling date. This thing is way past it's prime. He's a good guy though, so I can't give him too much grief. Shows potential of what could have been, but unfortunately it's just too far gone. A certain candidate for re-review, but I doubt that will be anytime soon. PULL YOUR OUTDATED BREWS OFF THE SHELVES, DAMN IT!"

"Overall this was an okay beer. The bottles says ""Rye lends spiciness to the caramel-malt base"". I would have liked to feel more spiciness from this beer, as it was minimal. Also, I wish they brought out the caramel malt flavors more. I still don't think it would make this beer awesome, but I think it would be better if they did those things. Also, I don't know if I would have used piney hops. I would use other kinds of hops that are less piney for this beer. Again, I have been disappointed by yet another Hatter beer. I love New Holland, but don't think I've ever really liked any of their Hatters."

"Overall, a decent rye pale."

"Pours a beuatiful caramel/amber with a creamy white head that shows a nice will to live. The aroma shows off the strong malt basis with just hints of floral hops. The taste has the same profile as the aroma with just a small spiced note. Nice fullness on the palate. A very god pale ale with a small but well-executed twist."
""
"Evenly balanced beer between the malts, grains, and hops regarding  taste. Spicy, tart, and dry with a robust dark malt suggestion (perhaps the Munich malt  used in the grain bill). A nice find along the Colorado Front Range and another reason to keep looking for some of those great Michigan beers..."

"Tasty beer.  The rye is very much present and pleasant.  The caramel taste goes well with the rye.  I would pick this up again."

"Overall, I was a bit let down by this beer. It honestly doesn't seem a whole lot different from the standard mad hatter. Not really worth going out of your way for."

"Amber to a rich brass hue with a quarter inch of beige head on top. Brussels lacing. The aroma is an interesting melange of spicy rye,piny hops and light malt. The taste is rye and light malt in the forefront. The piny hops kick in and the back of the palate and then it is rye and light malt in the finish. The mouth is slightly sticky and the hops and rye gently tickle the tastebuds. Not my favorite rye IPA,but still worth checking out."

"I had this on tap last year and loved it couldn't wait to try it again. This rye ale pours a slightly hazy copper red hue with a billowing and long lasting off white head that leaves a lot of lacing. The aroma is spicy and bitter. Notes of floral and citrus hops are accented by peppery and herbacious aromas. There is also a nice underlying malt sweetness that balances the entire nose. The mouthfeel is on the full bodied side of medium. Smoith but coating. The flavor is more bitter than the nose but still all the perceived aromas are present on the tongue. I can't quite put my finger on what citrus is present but its definitely there along with the spice, floral, and some pine. This is good, real good, and quite complex. There is almost a Belgian-y quality to it with all the spiciness and yet sweet and bitter flavors. Well done New Holland. Aside from the Imperial Hatter this may be my favorite of the Hatter series."

"Overall, a decent IPA with a reasonable price-point. Will buy again."

"O: Not bad at all. I really like the way the malt and hop flavors separate on the entry and then integrate on the finish. It really shows the drinker how a beer like this is put together. As Rye IPAs go, this one is not really groundbreaking or extreme in any way, but it is very solidly crafted, very approachable, and very flavorful. I like it."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is one of the the best Rye IPAs I've had. When its fresh, every aspect being graded is flirting with perfection. As it ages, the citrus fades and the rye becomes more prominent, but its still enjoyable. The lower ABV makes it dangerously sessionable, as well."
"Deep, cloudy orange with a clingy white head. Reeks of dank citrus hops and rye spice. Tastes like it smells. The sweet malt and citrus battle it out with the rye spice and sharp bitterness. A very raw, in your face beer yet balanced too. Very well done."

"The medium body sports a steady and firm carbonation that makes for a good, crisp and creamy movement on the tongue. As the dryness kicks in, it takes a little out of the body, but not too much."

"Overall: not unique and not perfect enough to be great. well crafted but fairly average taste in terms of rye hoppy beers"

"22 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled on 5/9/2013. Pours lightly hazy orange copper color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, orange zest, tangerine, floral, pine, spicy rye, caramel, grass, and floral earthiness. Very nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus hops with moderate rye/caramel malt balance; and good strength. Taste of grapefruit, orange zest, tangerine, caramel, floral, pine, spicy rye, grass, and floral earthiness. Decent amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, caramel, spicy rye, floral, pine, grass, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of citrus hops with rye/caramel malts; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Rye pale ale! All around nice balance and complexity of hop and malt flavors; and extremely smooth to drink. Really enjoyed this one."

"Where many of the Hatters are husky, rustic, raw and somewhat lacking refinement- the rye character here continues the rough-and-tumble attitude and actually reinforces it with stern quality."
"overall, pretty decent. well balanced."

"Overall, I find myself wondering if I've let this get too old and it's lost some of the flavor (7 months old; kept in a refrigerator for a few months and the rest in wine/beverage cooler at 45 degrees). Either way, I'd prefer Red's Rye (one of my favorite beers). I wouldn't be offended if someone served this to me at their house, but I don't think I'll buy it again."

"O- The flavors are spot on. I would like a bit more rye on the nose, but still a strong effort."
""
"A good beer that's an overflowing punch of flavor that I'm enjoying for tonight, but I probably won't pick up another bottle of it."
""
"3.5 D: Quality beer with no real faults, but not really that impressive. I think more rye would have given this more of an edge over a standard IPA."
""
""
"Pale ale like in aroma, taste and feel. Medium body, crisp and clean. Pours amber with a white head. The aroma is malty sweet with caramel, bread and yeast. The flavor has a nice bite, yet is very smooth and refreshing. A little bit of pepper and a bitter finish. Nice one."
"O: Not as good as the Farmhouse Hatter, but still alright. With all these variations, I’d be happy to try the standard Hatter – there’s nothing like an original."
"Pours a darker amber with a thick foamy white head, light carbonation. Hoppy smell with light citrus hints. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and the flavor is a nice hoppy goodness and not at all overpowering. I find many ryes too strong, but this is quite delicious and drinkable."
""
"A very nice Rye P.A. and one I'd drink again, but unlike ""The Poet", I wouldn't travel to New Holland, MI to get more."
""
"Overall I thought this was an ok beer and an above average example of the style, it's not the best rye IPA, but it certainly isn't the worst. This beer had good drinkability, it was pretty smooth and the flavors held my attention, one bomber would be just the right amount. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance and taste, they were both good and the hi light of this beer. What I liked least about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was going in the right direction but when it got to the body it was just to thin, just like Mad Hatter. I don;t think I would buy this beer again, I can think of a couple of Rye IPA's that I would rather have, but I would still recommend giving it a try. All in all this beer was better then I expected, I don't like Mad Hatter so I didn't think I would like this one, but it wasn't bad, but it did suffer from the same thing that Mad Hatter had with a thin body that doesn't work well with this beer, but it was good enough to get people that don't like IPA's to drink it so I have to give it credit. This was a decent beer, but nothing too memorable, I might just have to check out the rest of the series to see if there's anymore surprises."
"Drink- Its flavorful but not what I consider a Rye beer. Small timid rye is unbalanced from the dry hopping and too much bitter. Needs to replace dry hopping with more Rye to update spice and creamy flavors."
""
"O: Ok drinkability, flavor shows flashes of peppery caramel spiciness, and a good amount of alcohol which unfortunately covers the rye contribution at times."

"2012 Vintage. Poured a slightly hazy orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, a fresh grapefruit like hops and a small rye presence. In the taste, dry notes of rye, mellow grapefruit like hops. A small hop bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry rye and small hop citrus in the aftertaste. Overall this was a very good beer and will search for more."
""
"Thanks younger brother."
"O- Founders Reds Rye is my benchmark for the style. While this falls a little short, it's still quite solid. $4.49 for the bottle is a pretty good buy. Cap says ""lay."". A nap does sound good right now."

"22oz bottle, poured into my New Holland 20oz glass. Ale is hazy copper with a tall, frothy off-white head tat holds great retention and leaves lots of chunky lacing on the glass. Aromas are citrus, grapefruit, caramel, fresh pine, floral hop, lemon zest, faint rye in the background. Tastes are complex and juicy with earthy, spicy, peppery rye on the forefront, followed by caramel, toasted grain, pine, and grapefruit. Some faint acetylsalicylic acid on the finish also. Mouth-feel is medium bodied, and the piny hop resins coat the palate and linger on the finish. Overall, I am now satisfied with this beer, and glad I didn't write it off. I love rye beers and was very disappointed after last year's run. This was good, and exactly what I was expecting from New Holland."
""
"Overall, this one has solid positive elements going for it including a nice spicy hop bitterness however the lack of a solid crafted body really is a bit disappointing."
"Medium bodied with average carbonation. Has a bit of a grapefruit aftertaste. I am glad I decided to try this. Not as good as the Black Hatter in my opinion, but still good. Worth buying again."
"This is a really nice, smooth, peppery rye ipa. I would have preferred a more citrusy hop character to go along with the spicy rye, but this hop character does it's job and is nicely balanced. It's definitely worth a try."
"Overall this is a great twist on the standard Mad Hatter. I am partial to rye beers, but this is an excellent example of the style. As intended, the hops initially take a backseat to the complex malt profile but come roaring back in the finish to let you know this is still a hoppy beer. Well done New Holland. Recommended to any fan of rye beers or IPAs. Cheers!"
""
"Solid Rye Beer. nice spicy notes with a good mix of caramel form the malt and some solid hops backing it up. A bit on the midl side though unlike Founders take on it."
""
""
"O: This beer is probably past it's prime, but it's not bad. However between it being gusher and the slight funk I wonder if something is developing in this beer that shouldn't be."
"This would not stop foaming and overflowing from the bottle. Pours dark reddish color, some ruby brown coming through the edges, with a big fluffy head of course. Smell is funky and spicy with a definite rye presence, light grass hops, and yeastyness. Something off about the flavor without much hop bitterness, some rye spice, yeast funk, very light watered down malts. Relatively light bodied with lots of bubbles. Not a huge fan of this one. Seems muddled."
""
""
"D: Very firm rye & not as hoppy as I had hoped , and quite dry as well with hardly a hint of the malty, caramelly goodness I tend to like in an IPA. But then that is not all that surprising considering the bottle I have is probably nearing a year old & appears to have dried out (and carbed up a bit) in the bottle. It is still a very flavorful & interesting drinking hoppy rye beer. Perhaps a bit rough around the edges at this point, but quite okay. Hopefully I someday get the chance to try a fresh sample."
""
"Barnyard aroma. Cloudy light brown bodied, a quarter inch of retained head. Something funky with a nice rye edge that leads the mild spiciness. Good drinkability. Bomber with outstanding carbonation that not only foamed through, but popped my locking cap afterward."

"As wonderul as this smells, the taste and feel just don't live up to the hype. I've brewed Rye PA's that don't smell as good, but taste better. Other than to experience what a good beer aftershave would smell like, you shouldn't kill yourself seeking this one out."

"2011 vintage."
"I have loved many of New Holland's beers, but I really must wonder what went wrong here. Between the contents exploding for a number of people and the paltry amount of flavor, I am very disappointed."
"Found at Cardinal Liq's, Niles IL"
"Close to the worst beer I've ever had. Like I say, I hope my bottle was a total outlier (maybe left on a warm shelf in a sunny warehouse for six months?)"
"O – This is the 2nd of the 3 hatter varieties I received from, I still have the Black, but I enjoyed this over the Farmhouse. Just has a good flavor profile and nice balance."
"O - Probably the best of the Hatter variant series, this was a nicely balanced IPA with a nice hop/spice profile."
"O: This is a very interesting -- albeit very delicious -- beer. Would recommend picking one up for anyone who likes lighter beers with subtle and exotic flavors."
"Nicely toasted rye and barley malts add some bread and biscuit flavors to the spicey earthen flavors of this bitter RYE-PA. I like it and hope they keep thi beer in the regular rotation."
"Pours a cloudy orange with a thick white head that quickly Dissipates. Aromas of Sweet malt and rye, not too much hops comes through. The taste has more hop character, with a bitter taste upfront with a spiced rye ending with more sweet/citrus hop bitterness. I'm getting a little too much sweetness....Pretty good, but I couldn't drink more than 1 of these at a time."
"Overall Impression- Very nice brew but wonder about some of these breweries' special brews like this... Is this just a mixed beer or do they really go out of their way to brew a special batch? I fully enjoyed this one by New Holland and will be looking forward to having more of the Mad Hatters that have came out (Black Hatter, Farmhouse Hatter, Imperial Hatter, etc.)."
"Nice clear standard amber in color with a two finger craggy fluffy head that leaves lovely lacing with every sip. Body is a bit too far on the lighter side for my taste in rye beers, but it matches with how subtle they made it. Yes, I was expecting a bigger beer, but instead I got something carefully nuanced. A light nose of citrus hopping on top of gentle rye spiciness, standard caramel malt, all things presented in nose are exactly what I get in the taste as well. Finish resembles the standard bittering taper down of a typical APA. The only nitpick I have is that the sweetness of the malt seems about 10% too low to be in perfect balance with the hops and rye sting. Other than that, a nice refreshing effort, just a bit more subdued than I had expected."
"Very explosive head. 3 ounces of beer became 14 ounces of foam when poured into the pint glass. Very nice aroma. Subtle rye and grapefruit/flowery aroma. Dry. For some reason this beer is really reminding me of Duvel. I'm really loving this beer."
"O: delicious, drinkable, and it's $4. I'd do it again, even though it's not my favorite."
"Great stuff."
"Lengthy in hoppy tone overall and pretty solid, but the Oak-Aged Hatter is superior in balance, body, and flavor complexity for the New Holland series of IPA's."
"Poured into a nonik pint glass, this makes a beautiful walnut-colored beer, with an enormous, airy head. The nose features abundant citrus, piney hop notes, on top of a faint maltiness. An initial flavor of toasted malt, contributing very little-to-no sweetness, is quickly washed away by bracingly resinous, citrusy hops. Bitterness is quite high. The rye quality of the malt is mostly buried underneath the hops, but still provides some subtle spicy, pepper character. Finishes very dry."
"O: Slightly disappointing. A decent hop flavor, but nothing that really impressed me."
"M: A little over-carbonated, has good coating, and a nice dry hop finish."
"O - This is a pretty nice rye IPA. Another good version of the Mad Hatter series."
"O- This beer is just like picking fresh hops off the vine, the aroma is so powerful and full. The taste was nice but didn't have the depth of the aroma."
"Overall this is rock solid. If you rate this as a rye beer rather than an IPA, it fits beautifully."
"Picked up a bomber of this, real nice citrus aroma upon popping the top. Poured with a real nice foamy head, still pouring out the nice hop aroma. Tastes moderately sweet with a well balance hop bitter through the middle. The aroma mellows out over the course of the imbibationness. Finishes with just the right amount of rye spiciness. Another really nice New Holland brew in the Hatter series, will be picking this up again."
"The mouthfeel is a little above medium bodied with carbonation being moderate. Overall it was a pretty good beer, but not amazing in the style. Nice to try but I don't think it beats out the readily available Hop Rod or Rye PA for me. Still a very good beer overall though."
"I hope this is a bad bottle, but I can't see paying another $7 and getting another doozy. If I ever get a free one or find this one on tap somewhere I will re-review."
"D: This was a nice smelling and tasting beer, but the finish was a bit harsh and the body was a bit thin and fizzy. It wasn't difficult to drink, but it could have been better. Not as refined as Hop Rod or Bittersweet Lenny's (especially On Rye)."
"The malt backbone is a bit too strong for my liking and the hop profile could be a bit more complex. The rye is stronger n the nose than the flavor and I'm not sure if it improved the beer any. If anything it added a strong spicy presence that didn't care for. Still, this beer isn't bad, just not terribly interesting."
" Overall I really enjoyed this beer,I wasn't expecting it. New Holland hit a home run if you ask me.Must try if your into hop forward brews.I know I will be getting more."
"This is the best of the recent hatter variations, by far. I prefer the regular hatter to all of them, but this gives it a run."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, grapefruit like hops and a small rye presence. In the taste, dry notes of rye, mellow grapefruit like hops. A small hop bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry rye and small hop citrus in the aftertaste. Bigger hops than rye, but nice nonetheless."
"Overall, this is a nice variation on Hatter. Rye malt is a great addition to hoppy beers in my mind, and adds just enough to make it something other than a run of the mill pale or IPA."
"O: A good take on a Rye PA, with a little more thickness and caramel used then normal. The hops were presented very well in that you could tell the difference between the bittering and dry hop flavors."
"Overall a very nice spin on the ""Hatter"" series of beers. Rye spiciness compliments the citrus hops well."
"22 ounce bottle, Vintage 2011 as stated on label. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a somewhat hazy amber/orange color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is a bit weak but still OK, the brew smells like pine, citrusy and spicy hops, along with a bit of bready malt. Luckily it tastes stronger than the aroma. It tastes like spicy, pine and citrusy (lemon peel) hops, and some caramel and bready malt. The rye gives this brew a nice kick of spice. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and is well carbonated. Easy enough to drink, too. I think this is a decent enough brew, it's better overall than the Oak Aged Mad Hatter I tried right before this. It's worth a try, you could probably do worse for $5.99 a bomber."
"Notes: Nice twist on the hatter series, and a good light and hoppy take on a rye brew. And the label paper design while not extraordinary is taking a solid direction after some lazy displays once they stopped screen printing the bottles. Ah, and all things considered the price-quality ratio is phenomenal."
"O- I thought this beer was the best of the Hatter series. While there was a rather bland aroma overall leaving me wishing there was more rye to it the flavor made up for it. A clean tasting beer with just enough flavor to keep me happy. Would I like a little more rye to it? Well yes but this one I will gladly take another pint of!"
"All in all, this is definitely an interesting brew. I wish it had a bit more complexity to it, but I can't entirely fault it, as it's pretty damn solid. wish there was a bit more of that fruit I caught in the aroma, and I would have hoped for a bit more rye pepper spice, but all in all, I'd pick it up again if it were local."
"Thanks Justin for sharing this one!"
"O: probably the worst rye I've had. VERY VERY mellow. There was really hardly any hops to this at all."
"O: While this beer is basically a rye/IPA combo (a fact that won't please some people), it is a solid, enjoyable brew."
"Overall, its a decent beer, but nothing really that stands out. I've had many other rye ipa's that have far outshined this one."
"O - Awesome. That's all."
"O - nice drinkable rye PA."
"o - Overall I liked this one and think it's right up there with the normal version. I liked this one better than farmhouse Hatter personally. Would get it again."
"O: Rye Hatter has some complication to it and drinks reasonably well, yet it strikes me as very average. The dirty/earthy note keeps distracting me, too. "
"overall - while i would drink this beer again i would not buy thisbeer ever again - flavors were muted and @ $8 a bomber there are way too many other options"
"O: Nice brew. Nice and hoppy while making a nice feature of rye. Not a bad value at $4 per bomber."
"O- i like rye IPAs, and this was no exception. ill be picking this up again. i like the affordable price of $5 a bomber also."
"I would happily order this again."
"O - was worried with the aroma bring light on the rye, flavor killed it though, will need to try along terrapin rye squared and founders rye pa"
"O: A really nice Rye beer. Nice amounts of citrus hops balance out the gritty rye. If you enjoy sipping a Jim Beam Rye, you will enjoy this beer."
"One of the best rye beers I've ever had & a masterful rendering of hops & rye. One of the rare beers that lived up previous expectations, this is a bloody classic; dare I say nipping up to the border of perfect. Snap one up if you see it."
"This brew pours a nice straw color tinted with amber. It settles a slightly hazy copper with 2 fingers of white head. The nose hoppy and clean. Pine and citrus ring out of the glass. The taste is pretty balanced. Similar to the nose, light grapefruit and pine are predominant. A hoppy/bitter forefront and pairs with a light caramel malt taste. Nothing special, but def. drinkable. The mouthfeel is light to medium with a prickly punch of carbonation. Decent overall"
"A really good Rye Pale Ale. The hops and rye go well together. Would of liked a little more rye though."
"Part of the new ""Hatter"" series.Poured into an imperial nonic a dull slightly hazed burnt orange tinged copper with a large fluffy two finger slight off white head atop.Love the aromas,bold spicy rye mixed with sharp citric hops,its no holds barred aroma wise.Sharp and a little tingly in the mouth and on the lighter side,a good mix of citric hops and spicy rye,there is a bit of toastiness in there.A solid American style rye beer,loaded with citric hops and full on spicy rye."
"D-"
"A nice brew. I was hoping it would be more heavily hopped, but to no avail. Definitely a worthy choice though."
"I'm a sucker for rye beers, so this is tasty. I think if New Holland's base IPA were better, this and the whole hatter series would be more exciting."
"Worth trying if you can find it."
"Drinkability:This is a very tasty beer that has a lot of what I expect and want from an IPA, but because the flavors are so strong, I don't think it's very sessionable."
