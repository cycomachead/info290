"Rye Malt and habanero pepper flesh along with a nice kick to the back of the throat.  If you're not used to spicy food, avoid this.  It is quite hot for the average person.  Warms the entire chest.  Personally, I love it."

"This pours a stunning cinnamon color. Gorgeous but no head. The smell is slightly vegetal, but is really not much at all. Taste is essentially missing on the initial taste, then a lingering burn in you throat. There are some pepper flavors, no noticeable hops. It's a decent beer overall, but I came away think they could have done much more with it, with more initial hop or malt flavor and less heat."

"O- Just not for me, but this is a well constructed and brewed beer that really brings the heat. Despite my below rAvg rating, I do strongly encourage any capsaicin addicts out there to try this beer."

"Pours a dirty brown muddled body with pretty good retention. Aroma has a nice spicy pepper to it. Flavor though is a let down. Mild black pepper mixed with spicy habanero but not as powerful or forceful as on tap at the brewery."

"A disappointing brew without much heat and complexity."

"Overall: The caramel and rye base of this beer is very tasty. However this is about as hot a beer that I have ever had. The taste is good but may be a bit much for some people and is fairly one note after the initial caramel. This is a quality beer to get every now and again, but I could not imagine myself drinking a full bomber by myself."

"O - Overall, this is just okay. It was so much better on tap at the brewery. On tap it was potent and delicious, this is just a weary version."

"This beer is awesome cook with. Marinate Chicken, Steak, vegetables etc... and interesting to drink, although i probably wouldn't want to kill a whole bottle. I'll definitely be doing it again."

"Overall- I personally didnt like it but the beer delivers exactly what it promises so if it sounds good to you will probably like it."
""
""

"Well the beer delivers the hot pepper, decent beer to go with it, but nothing too special or crazy."

"Nice Belgian Brown feel almost with good fruit and some habanero flavor."

"I thought this was nicely spiced. Tangy, but not overdone. I had this with a Mexican salad (beans, peppers, onions, etc) and thought it complimented the entr√©e well."
""
"O - this was the first time I had anything by Night Shift after hearing so much about them. I thought this was a very well crafted beer that was enjoyable. The spicy quality to it was great when I first started drinking this beer but as I made my way further down to the bottom of the glass, the enjoyment of the spice kind of wore off. It was a really good beer and I would recommend it to people. I've never been a fan of pepper beers but I did really enjoy this one."

"Poured from a 750ml into a snifter, the beer is a dark, vibrant, ruby color with a frothy, light, off-white head that starts a robust two inches and rapidly settles into a sparse, filmy coating. Smells a bit like a big quad...Belgian-like yeast characteristics, both fruity and floral, with a touch of pepper at the end. Flavors of mild roasted grain, but only for a split second because that's how long it takes for the sizzling burn to set in on your tongue and mouth. Very subtle to start, but this fire builds. Very good, as it doesn't overpower or sacrifice the flavor for the heat. The more you drink you start to get more Belgian characteristics, with a bit of yeast funk again, as well as some farmhouse spicing. The rye definitely gives a nice roasty and even grain backbone, and that pepper just keeps on coming. By the end of the palate, the pepper adds flavor as well as heat. Spicy, hot aftertaste, with touches of the grain bill once again. Clean and light in mouth, which helps keep things sharp overall. Smooth, clean finish. Interesting brew."

"Rusty brown pour with a thin off-white head. Aroma of caramel malts, mild peppery spice, light fruit notes. The taste was pretty mellow for a habanero beer, nice pale malt and honey/agave sweetness up front, toasty grains, green pepper, followed by some hot pepper prickle that was kept in check by the sweeter elements, making for a pretty smooth mouthfeel overall. Medium-bodied and quite enjoyable."

"Big thanks goes out to beeruser for sharing this one at a past Random Sunday Tasting! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured red-orange with a minimal off-white head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, earth, spice, pepper, chipotle, and relish. The flavor was of sweet malt, relish, earth, pickle, pepper, and salt. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. Oh great, another pepper spiced beer what could possibly go wrong based on my past experiences? Actually this one actually was quite good and well balanced. The pepper aspect was definitely there, but it did not destroy your palate and stomp it into the mud. There was quite a bit else going on that helped to cut the heat and actually balance out the flavors that were present. A huge surprise since I have always hated life after drinking brews like this in the past. Definitely worth your time trying this one if you are a fan of the style."

"Would I buy it again? Absolutely."

"O: I was wondering how the peppers would come into play here , and I feel as though they were done wonderfully, I am not usually a huge fan of pepper beers, this is well rounded with a nice bit of heat on the finish... Good show."

"Pours a slightly murky deep reddish brown color with a huge off white head that persists forever leaving moderate lace on the way down. Smells of spicy rye and peppery yeast phenols with a sweet lightly bready and caramel malt base with a hint of dark fruit. I can't find any peppers in the nose, they must be subtle. The flavor is sweet and malty up front with spice and rye providing balance. I found the pepper and it comes in lightly in the middle and lingers long into the finish. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet spicy mouthfeel. Nice brew, I could have used a bit more pepper but I enjoyed it just the same."

"I hate small pours but it's appropriate in this case. The heat built up a bit by the time I was done."
"O: A very unique and surprisingly good beer. It's not very traditional but it has good, strong flavors with excellent balance. It's not too spicy, too hot or too sweet. The flavors meld surprisingly well. It's hot but not overly so, it's a borderline chile beer in my humble opinion. Definitely the star of the show in this one. Surprisingly smooth and drinkable for a beer of this style too."
"Overall: Recent batches have dialed up the habanero and it works. Balanced and approachable for a chile beer."

"Brown/amber color with no head whatsoever served in a flute glass. Completely translucent with no sediment or cloudiness. The heat of the habanero pepper is immediate and dominating with regards to the smell and taste (moreso for the taste). There is also a very nice balance of malt/hops since I was able to decipher both over something as bold as a pepper. The pepper flavor itself was very recognizable and tasty. Many pepper beers are a mess, but this did a great job of portraying the pepper used. This beer is medium-bodied and obviously leaves some heat in the aftertaste as intended. Overall I would highly recommend this beer because it's delicious and delivers as promised."
