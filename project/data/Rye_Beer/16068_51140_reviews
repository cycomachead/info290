"Refreshing watery taste along with the grainy maltiness. Thoroughly drinkable and flavorful brew. From the 22 oz bottle purchased at Market of Choice on 29th in Eugene."

"I like rye beers quite a bit. This one is pretty OK, but totally sessionable -- in stark contrast to the usual hop wallop of ales from America typically featuring rye."

"Overall - not a bad brew at all, and not bad tasting, but not terribly intriguing either."

"O- A really nicely balanced and sessionable summer beer. Different from you average pale ale or even rye pale ale. The flavor profile is well-balanced and pretty unique. Really digging this one."
"I like this beer. It's easy to drink and would quench my thirst on a hot day. It's a good alternative to the usual spring seasonals."

"Appearance is honey in color supporting a fair but thin head leaving spotty lace. Smell of citris, honey and floral hops. Taste has a honey breadiness, caramel malt with the rye and a bitterness that makes itself known but not overpowering. Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation. not a bad brew being a borderline summer session for me."
"This is not overall that bad, but it's not doing too much for me either. It's drinkable and I could have it again, but it's not that impressive either."
"Had a pint at Clyde Common. The rye flavors isn't expansive and deep, but it is distinct. This is a dry, spicy rye ale. A legit rye beer, and worth a try for rye lovers. It's average weight and reasonably drinkable, a standard American craft ale. The flavor has a mix of malty, toasted bready rye with a dry grapefruit hops kick that blends right into the rye malts."

"Pours a hazy light amber with a shy amount of off-white head. Didn't stick around either. Aroma is light as well. Pale malt, touch of rye, and some hops. Spicy and floral with a bit of citrus. Comes out of it's shell a bit on taste. Follows the nose with light malt, bit of rye, and spicy floral citrus hop. Beer is smooth with good balance on the bittering. Overall a decent brew, but not stand outtish in any way."

"Drinkable enough in its way, but a bit depressing as well. It could have used the springboard of the rye better to express some spicy hop characters. As it is, it's a bit bland and dull."

"O: Nothing out of balance in any way. It's smooth and interesting in a low key way. It's billed as a summer seasonal, which is exactly what it is. It's got rye and honey, which is probably what makes it interesting, but it's hard to say exactly why."
"Overall: Fairly enjoyable. A light beer, but a nice beer."
"This beer is nicely textured with good bitterness but well integrated with the acids and body. Finishes long and smooth. A very good beer, but lacks the overall punch I expect (and receive) in most rye ales."
"Overall, I think this is a subpar beer. Based on the label description, I had hoped for more. Probably won't try this again, unless I got a bad (under carbonated) bottle. Might try on tap if I see it."
"I'm not detecting a whole lot of rye coming throuh in the nose. Pleasant aromas of bready malt with citric and herbal notes, a touch of honeyish sweetness. Rye flavor is much more potent, appearing as if out of nowhere to deliver it's signature savory/spicy duo. It works pretty nicely with the moderately sweet malt profile. The hops cooperate as well, somewhat citric, somewhat grassy, somewhat herbal. Fairly grainy and crisp in the finish. Not exactly a storm of rye, but solid."
"O: Pretty good"
"Unfortunately I was a bit underwhelmed with offering. I don't know that I would even guess there was rye used in this."
"Overall a flavorful refreshing summer beer."
"Overall, this is a wonderful beer, A great well rounded brew, for a style I dont usually go straight for, this is one of the better commercial examples that puts it self forward as a 'straight up' rye beer."
"Super aggressive pour only yields a one finger head in my standard pint glass. The head in completely white and has mostly big bubbles, some small ones, but for the most part the head is pretty lame. Good lacing throughout the glass is nice, and the head never completely disappears, but it's still not too great. The body is a very cloudy, dark orange color. The color isn't nearly dark enough for it to be this non transparent, so there must be a cloudy factor in here as well. Carbonation looks extremely low, very few bubbles rising to the top. Overall the looks is good, the fact that the head leaves a nice layer of foam on top of the body really saves it, and the lacing helps a lot too. The body is solid, so no problems there. Overall a good look but the head for sure could use some improving. The smell is interesting, because you can for sure pick up on the honey smell, that aspect is there. The pale ale smell is a little hard to clarify though. I can't tell if it's going to be all malt, or a mixture of nice malt and nice hops. Obviously it's not going to be all hops because it's a pale ale, and hopefully it's not all malt, but the smell kinda indicates that it might. All over the beer doesn't smell bad, it smells good, but I'm going to give it a 3.5 because I'm pretty sure it's going to be a very heavy malted pale ale. The taste is very very interesting because the honey and malt are very small. Frankly all the flavors are small, it's really just a mix of malt, hops, honey, and water, not one flavor is much more prominent than any others. I'm shocked at how small all the flavors all though, it's really just very watered down. I mean it almost works for the style, just because it is supposed to be a light summer ale, but it's just too light, it's supposed to be a pale ale, and it doesn't meet that criteria. It does have all the necessary flavors, they are all there, which is good, and the hops are there, and I was afraid there would be zero hops. It's just too watery all around. It's not a terrible beer, but I will say that it is barely getting a 3.5 on taste. The mouthfeel isn't terribly thin, it's for sure thinner than I would like, but it's not as watery as the taste is, it's a decent mouthfeel for a pale ale. The carbonation is pretty damn low, but it's not really offensive, it works for a summer beer I suppose. Drinkability may be it's best factor, not an offensive beer, and it's very light, and somewhat tasty. Overall though, this is just another disappointing beer from Oakshire, I remember all of there beers to be much better than they have been when I have reviewed them. Not a terrible beer by any means, and frankly one of the better brews from Oakshire. It has all the necessary weapons, it's just firing a little short on all of them. We will see if the flavors pump out more potency when the beer warms, but for now, just coming short on all the flavors."

"overall - still not a rye fan."
"D - Good, not great."
"D - The carbonation could be a little bit less. The use of honey was done very well. It is the perfect amount to balance the rest of the beer. The rye does not seem to be coming through though, which is why I wanted to try this in the first place. So if you are looking for a distinctive rye beer this probably is not the one, but it is still a good beer nonetheless."
"Bomber from Capital Market,Salem. 5.3% alc now. Dull brown, clear beer, with a small light tan head. Aroma, bready, cereal, some chocolate( that may be the rye)..some slight earthy tones. Tasste is the same except the rye is more noticable near the end..and some sweetness from what i expect is the honey..though it seems arfificial. Palate is OK it gets a bit cloying as this goes on. Not a bad beer overall but not a great rye..McMenamins make a really nice rye PA that would blow this out of the water."
"D - Pretty disappointing overall, and one I would pass on completely in the future."
"Pours dark amber with a modest off white head. Fair amount of lacings. Aroma is rose petals with some soap. Taste is apple jack, soap, and rose water. Never tasted the rye. Mouthfeel is medium carbonation and moderately bitter. Finish is just cider, soap, and mild bitterness. As a fan of other Oakshire products I will try to find another bottle from a different store to try. This came very close to being a drain pour for me and I don't do this very often."
"D: This beer is mediocre among extra-pale ales. It is effortlessly consumable, but unremarkable at the same time. Considering that it is a summer seasonal, this seemingly unflattering description may actually be a selling point. Still, a more dominant hop aroma/flavor profile would do wonders here."
"The flavor holds back some of that initial rye spice suggested by the nose and replaces it with a grainy, mineral-rich malt huskiness. Not much hop flavor to be found, but they do supply a nice dose of herbal bitterness. Rye finally kicks in on the finish--dry and crisp, but it's a bit too little too late. Mouthfeel is uppity in its carbonation, but still maintains a creamy feel to the medium-light body. All in all, a serviceable rye beer and a good choice for the summer heat. Thanks again Scott!"
"Pours with a pure white head. Aroma is spot on for a pils and taste is incredibly reminiscent of a northern German pils, with maybe 50% more IBUs. The rye is quite subtle and I think adds nice to the hop profile. Living in the PNW it's rare to see fresh pilseners, and even though this is a rye pale it really almost reminds me of a pilsener until the yeast profile appears as the beer warms up. This is quite a nice, light summer beer."
"D: Oh, so very drinkable on a warm July afternoon...perfect for sipping in the shade or (I suppose) pairing with anything from a crisp salad to something spicy or grilled...pale ales don't usually excite my much, but the deft balance of hops, rye and honey in this one make it memorable and earn it a spot in the 'need to have more this summer' category."
"Other comments: The rye definitely comes through, which is nice because it is so often shunted behind overly heavy hops or just not present enough to cut through the malt."
"Overall, at $4-5 a bomber, it is nice to try and a great offering from Oakshire and a great choice for a hot summer day. However, a little more rye would make the beer a real winner and a repeat choice."
"Oakshire describes Line Dry as a ""rye pale ale with a touch of Oregon blackberry honey"" brewed with 10% rye malt and 10% flaked rye. It is warm yellow with a plump body and an exuberant white head. The honey lends an unexpected yet intentional sweetness, while rye elements point to a crisp, dry terminus. Personally, I prefer a grainier rye beer as a summertime thirst quencher and palate cleanser. But conceptually I ""get it"" and the honey is ultimately a nice flourish if that sort of thing appeals to you."
"Pours a golden color with a creamy white head that never fully dissolves and leaves a nice layer atop the glass and has nice streaming carbonation lines. The aroma is sweet hops, rye and caramel malt. The flavor is more sweet caramel malt upfront followed by and earthy bitterness and ends with a sweet, spicy finish. Its light to medium bodied with a pleasant carbonation. This is a very subtle beer and makes for easy drinking. Highly recommended for a hot summer day spent on a patio or outdoors."
"Line Dry Rye is the third Oakshire I've tried, and like their Watershed IPA and truly amazing Perfect Storm Imperial IPA, it too is excellent. My first taste of LDR was at a Hillstomp concert on a warm Sunday afternoon at Papa's Soul Food Kitchen and Blues Joint in Eugene, OR. The only thing bland about this summer seasonal, which was served in a plastic compostable cup, was the iced tea color. LDR is made with 10 percent rye malt and 10 percent flaked malt, which gives it a refreshing dry flavor that is balanced by the moderate hoppiness and malt finish. My tongue must be scorched from too many hoppy beers because I could not taste the touch of blackberry honey used to make the brew. It could have been the music or it could have been Papa's fried catfish, but Oakshire's Line Dry Rye is one tasty hot weather antidote."
