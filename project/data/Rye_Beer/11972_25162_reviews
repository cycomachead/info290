"this beer is appallingly under rated. i mean, yeah it could use a little more carbonation, and sure, it might not be the most delicious beer in the whole world, but to score this so low is offensive. the beer is aweomse, its a clear golden color, dim in the radiance, but bright in aroma and taste. honey is raw and not all that sweet, but real authentic, and something pretty unique in a beer, as its flavorful and not fermented out, but yet pretty dry. the rye is what makes it though for me, honey and rye together, they almost act to offset one another, but instead join forces and make it distinct. mellow but bold, real hard to do, but really well done there. again, a little flat, and thats my main knock against it, but this is a great sixer of beer, one of my favorites from montana, and a cool fusion of ingredients that dont always get paired together. excellent beer, drinkable for miles, and im craving another as i type this. way better than the other(s) i have had from madison river..."
"Light golden/amber color with slight foamy head. Faint nose, not picking up much rye like I expected. Picking up mostly the honey. Light rye taste and other grains. Honey more prominent on tongue than nose. Acidity and carbonation lingers. Smooth, lighter feel blends well, somewhat foamy texture. Overall, not bad. Not as tasty as I'd like it to be. Would recommend for a session style beer on a warm summer day."

"Overall – A decent brew overall that is fairly easy drinking.  Good, but nothing super outrageous."

"A decent thirst quencher but won't knock your socks off...There's a definite lack of rye flavor. It tastes more like an amber ale."

"Having a rye and honey centric ale is good for a change considering all of the IPAs and hoppy Pales on the shelves. I like how the rye and honey are prominent but some yeast flavors creep up and take away from that later on in the experience."

"This seemed like rather a dull beer to begin with, but as it warmed, its character shone through. The rye is not highly noticeable, but neither is the honey overdone. I give it better than average scores all around."
"Flavor: combination of tangy, peppery rye, some citrus and floral hop flavor, sweet toasted malts, the honey is detectable but not overwhelming."

"Sampled at Beer Revolution in Calgary, a relatively pale gold/just shy of amber rye beer with minimal white froth on top. I was immediately struck by the fruity nose, which features assertive but nondescript orchard fruit notes, citrus, and floral vanilla overlaid on a sweet white bread and cereal malt base. Not much in the way of rye character on the nose. As is so often the case, the taste follows the nose. Indubitably the fruitiest rye beer I've yet to encounter, the orchard fruit carries over onto the taste buds (pear!), there's some vanilla and sweet honey, violets, graham cracker, and some characteristic rye spice thankfully, although this latter element is still downplayed compared to most examples of the style. There's some rye enhancement but not much; someone apparently did not wish to alienate too many palates and the result is a rye beer that comes off like a high-end cream ale. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel, thinnish body, and some pleasant lemon-lime citrus in the finish, which lacks in the bitterness and spice departments. Rather difficult to rate this one, as while I enjoyed it on the basis of its own merits, it is missing much in the way of rye character."

"Pours light gold, minuscule foam. Hazy. Honey nose, with hints of rye. But more of the sweetness. Smooth taste. Opens sweet with honey and closes that way too. Barely get a touch of bitter in the middle. Low carbonation in the mouthfeel. An ok brew, certainly too light on the signature rye flavor."

"This isn’t a bad beer, but it may disappoint some who try it and expect something different/better. I find it okay, but other than drinking it on a hot day by the pool, I am not so sure I would buy this beer again."
"this is not that great of a beer overall, but is decent enough for a session ale on hot summer months. i'll save the other 2 bottles for then."

"Overall Salmon Fly Honey Rye was heavily over carbonated and had a flavor profile that barely beats out higher-end macros. Part of this may be my fault as I purchased this bottle in August of 2011 on a research trip to Yellowstone. However, I think a majority of the faults are inherent to the beer itself and I don't foresee myself ever purchasing this again."

"Not going to be revisiting this one. Not enough flavor to make it worth my while."
""
"Overall- A sessionable rye beer by Madison. The fruity notes were pleasant but I was wanting the traditional biscuity flavours that are reminiscent of a rye beer. Other than that, an enjoyable beer."

"This is a nice brew. You should save this for a warm day. It goes down easy and still has plenty of flavor."

"Overall I really like this beer and I would like to be able to buy it again."
""

"O: A lightly flavored and fairly uninteresting beer, but not an offensive beer. Not something I'm likely to drink again."
""
""

"Super smooth beer that really just drank well. Nothing too complex, but I would totally buy again."
""
"If I was a local I would most likely make this a regular, but I'm not going out of my way to track one down."
"I got this as part of a BOTMC. Poured from a 12 ounce bottle, hazy yellow pour, medium white head, some lacing. The aroma is light, not much going on. The flavor is light, sweet, don't really detect the rye. The finish is sweet. The body is light, easy drinking. Drinks like a wheat beer, good summertime brew. Would have liked to see more rye in the taste."

"Overall: I didn't expect much from this beer, but is nicely refreshing and has a good flavor, even though it is on the light side. Easy quaffing."
"not going over the top with honey is a plus, I don't think I'd go looking for a second but I'm not upset there was a first"

"Overall Drinkability - Mild, though flavorful, and very refreshing. Great at what it sets out to do."
"Overall, if it was the only thing around, sure! I bet this is way better on tap though."
"Overall- A pretty eh beer. Like an adjunct lager, but slightly more interesting. Pretty sweet. Grainy for sure. Goes down easy, an I'd have a couple on a hot day. But I'd rather have something else."
"O- Pretty bland beer. Nothing fatally wrong with it, just no pop here."
"I mean, let's be honest, this isn't breaking molds with innovation and creativity but it's not a bad effort for an easy drinking beer. I really wish there was a lot more rye showcased in this beer, especially considering it's plastered in the name of the beer. Lawnmower, football, etc. type of beer. Okay but nothing special here."
"O: This is not a great beer, but it would be a good beer for summer time, mowing the lawn or just sitting at the beach. It is better than many macros and is not too complicated"
"Overall a pretty plain brew without too much ""Rye"" things going on to really push the flavor buttons. But its well made and decent enough for perhaps some warm weather drinking."
"O: Pretty lackluster. Not really much going on here that I enjoyed."
"Light bodied, lightish carbonation, this has a very thin mouthfeel and frankly, not a beer I could drink back to back. It will take me a while to drink the other 5 bottles..."
"Overall this was a good beer that I would happily partake of again. It had some draw backs with the lack of body and neutral aroma but it was more than made up for in the taste of the beer."
"D - not the best flavor but still enjoyable and very drinkable."
"D/O- Very crisp, very refreshing. At 5.5%abv, would be a good lawnmower beer in the summer. First Montana beer reviewed. Thanks fdkayti!"
"D- This is a nice beer to enjoy several of in a sitting. The refreshing nature keeps me coming back for another drink and it has a unique flavor that clings to the palate for quite awhile after the swallow. It's a nice change of pace from the usual and I recommend giving this a try."
"Gotta knock it down a few pegs."
"An enjoyable enough, um, pale ale, as both the honey and the rye do their utmost to stay pretty much under the radar - the expected malt spiciness going duly unrewarded, and nothing overtly beehive-worthy manifesting at any particular point. Easy enough to drink, however, despite these minor disappointments - just pay little heed to the name of this offering - there is no salmon, very little honey or rye, and well, as for the 'fly' - there really is no 'hook' here to make me want to seek out more."
" It's a lightly-cloudy copper with a small amount of carbonation. The aroma and taste were a small amount of rye. Nothing much there but a small amount of sourness. The honey seemed absent. It didn't make me wretch, but I'm not going to go looking for another one."
"D: Nothing too exciting here at all, not much smell or taste with this one."
"Body is on the light side with a fairly abundant carbonation.. overall I wouldn't turn one of these down... but I would get bored fairly quickly."
"A good summer drink."
"Think this coulda been a good one, but it seems to be turning. The sour dominates all else. But hidden in there is a pretty good beer. I do pick up some good grainyness, a little honey, a bit chewy. Some head and lace. Decent body. Honey finish. Be interesting to try another. Maybe someday."
"Ugh. I hate slamming craft brews but this is awful. Listless, sticky on the finish and a stale taste that lingers. It could be a bad bottle but there's nothing to indicate anything but poor brewing."
"Mild rye presence, with subtle sweet spiciness in the finish. Light bodied, sort of wimpy, it could use a touch more body. Needs more hops and spicy rye flavor. As it stands, it's very light and sessionable. It showcases balance without flying the extreme flag."
