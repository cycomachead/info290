3.45,-8,4,3.25,3.5,3.25,3.5,"Poured from a 750ml into a snifter, the beer is a dark, vibrant, ruby color with a frothy, light, off-white head that starts a robust two inches and rapidly settles into a sparse, filmy coating. Smells a bit like a big quad...Belgian-like yeast characteristics, both fruity and floral, with a touch of pepper at the end. Flavors of mild roasted grain, but only for a split second because that's how long it takes for the sizzling burn to set in on your tongue and mouth. Very subtle to start, but this fire builds. Very good, as it doesn't overpower or sacrifice the flavor for the heat. The more you drink you start to get more Belgian characteristics, with a bit of yeast funk again, as well as some farmhouse spicing. The rye definitely gives a nice roasty and even grain backbone, and that pepper just keeps on coming. By the end of the palate, the pepper adds flavor as well as heat. Spicy, hot aftertaste, with touches of the grain bill once again. Clean and light in mouth, which helps keep things sharp overall. Smooth, clean finish. Interesting brew.","GarthDanielson","Mar 15, 2013"

The taste was pretty mellow for a habanero beer, nice pale malt and honey/agave sweetness up front, toasty grains, green pepper, followed by some hot pepper prickle that was kept in check by the sweeter elements, making for a pretty smooth mouthfeel overall.

3.53,-5.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Big thanks goes out to beeruser for sharing this one at a past Random Sunday Tasting! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured red-orange with a minimal off-white head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, earth, spice, pepper, chipotle, and relish. The flavor was of sweet malt, relish, earth, pickle, pepper, and salt. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. Oh great, another pepper spiced beer what could possibly go wrong based on my past experiences? Actually this one actually was quite good and well balanced. The pepper aspect was definitely there, but it did not destroy your palate and stomp it into the mud. There was quite a bit else going on that helped to cut the heat and actually balance out the flavors that were present. A huge surprise since I have always hated life after drinking brews like this in the past. Definitely worth your time trying this one if you are a fan of the style.","thagr81us","Jan 11, 2013"

3.92,4.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a slightly murky deep reddish brown color with a huge off white head that persists forever leaving moderate lace on the way down. Smells of spicy rye and peppery yeast phenols with a sweet lightly bready and caramel malt base with a hint of dark fruit. I can't find any peppers in the nose, they must be subtle. The flavor is sweet and malty up front with spice and rye providing balance. I found the pepper and it comes in lightly in the middle and lingers long into the finish. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet spicy mouthfeel. Nice brew, I could have used a bit more pepper but I enjoyed it just the same.","johnnnniee","Sep 10, 2012"

3.97,5.9,3.5,4,4,4,4,"O: A very unique and surprisingly good beer. It's not very traditional but it has good, strong flavors with excellent balance. It's not too spicy, too hot or too sweet. The flavors meld surprisingly well. It's hot but not overly so, it's a borderline chile beer in my humble opinion. Definitely the star of the show in this one. Surprisingly smooth and drinkable for a beer of this style too.","Dope","Aug 04, 2012"

4.32,15.2,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Brown/amber color with no head whatsoever served in a flute glass. Completely translucent with no sediment or cloudiness. The heat of the habanero pepper is immediate and dominating with regards to the smell and taste (moreso for the taste). There is also a very nice balance of malt/hops since I was able to decipher both over something as bold as a pepper. The pepper flavor itself was very recognizable and tasty. Many pepper beers are a mess, but this did a great job of portraying the pepper used. This beer is medium-bodied and obviously leaves some heat in the aftertaste as intended. Overall I would highly recommend this beer because it's delicious and delivers as promised.","BeerMaverick","Beers"
