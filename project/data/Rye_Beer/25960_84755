3.72,-2.6,3.75,3.5,3.75,4,3.75,"Yeah, it's pretty clear that certain musky, dank hop strains so favoured by brewers all up and down the west coast of late, do not agree with me.  That said, this is still a pretty enjoyable rye ale, the adjunct grain doing well to integrate with the whole, while the other hop esters prop up an otherwise lost cause.","biboergosum","Mar 01, 2015"

To be fair the label says “Bottled 07.30.12”, so it likely has already passed its prime. I’m going to look for it on draft.","mhaugo","Mar 30, 2013"

4.1,7.3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Overall, this is a damn drinkable brew. The rye is subtle, but broadens the palate nicely, which is very nice. Often rye can make a beer sharper and spicier, but here it provides additional width of character. Very nice stuff, probably one of the best of Heretic's I've had.","lacqueredmouse","Dec 11, 2012"

3.43,-10.2,3.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall, this is a good session beer with nice rye and malt notes and a good deal of balance. It isn’t as heavy as many of the other Heretic products, but it is still good and flavorful in its own way and it’s a product worth trying if you like the taste of rye.","BryanCarey","Oct 15, 2012"
3.77,-1.3,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"This is a great example of a session beer. The rye flavor really fills in the gap most session beers have due to a lack of grain/malt. There is a good amount of hop flavor and aroma without being too bitter.","Philousa","Sep 23, 2012"

4.25,11.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"This is a very nice lower abv beer. Packs a good amount of flavor into that 4.4% abv. Pours a pretty orangey amber. Quite clear, minimal haze. Aroma is mild but juicy citrus hops on top of some rye spice and some caramel maltiness. A little bit of a floral quality in there somewhere. Very tasty stuff. For me, this has perfect balance for this sort of low abv amber ale. It starts with rye-spicy caramel sweetness and sweet orange hop flavor and then dries out and finishes with a refreshing bitterness, packed with pine resin and rye bread. Very easy to drink. Mouthfeel is light, creamy and smooth. It compliments the flavor very well and is surprisingly full-bodied for the beer's strength. Great stuff. I've been a bit disappointed in Heretic, so far (to be clear, I had my expectations very high), but this beer is excellent. Also, I'm happy to see another tasty, low abv beer.","popery","Sep 07, 2012"
