"At barcade Founders tap takeover."
"Doesn't taste at all like the original Red Rye.  Much sweeter with hints of vanilla.  Still a good beer, I was just surprised in the difference."

"O- This is fantastic and the benchmark for me as far as bourbon barrel aged hoppy beers are concerned. The smoother hop profile and spice notes really complement the barrel and really give this beer a sort of pina colada flavor. This is much better that BA Double Trouble (Doom) which was too dank and piney for the barrel aging IMO."

"Overall - Totally different from Red's Rye. The barrel character is nice, though. Drinks like a small, hoppy barleywine."

"O-Overall I say if love Red's Rye you'll really love this one."
"I really enjoy the complexities that the barrel brings, however the bright hop character of the Pale Ale has been slightly compromised. But the balance remains in tact- just rearranged slightly. With all the pluses and minuses- I call this one a wash!"

"Reds rye has a very deep amber color that appears red hence the term reds rye. End with a bitter taste - looks like a welcoming beer but doesn't taste that way... If I had to say something pleasant I would say it has vanilla notes. Overall I would not recommend"

"Not my favorite combination. I like red's rye, and I like bourbon barreled beers, but the aging should probably be limited to allow the base beer to shine through more. Wish the citrus presence were more pronounced and alcohol were more subtle."
