"Overall this beer was not very good and quite a let down. Shame too. The more random Trillium beers I have the more I'm starting to think they are overrated unfortunately. I really doubt I will finish this entire 750ml, as its not really enjoyable, more of a chore to drink."

"O: Very interesting and bold rye beer. Sharp flavors (this is very fresh, after all) with a bold rye that you rarely find. Very spicy and herbal. Unique and tasty."

"Ruddy brown. Medium bodied. Rye! Flavor is not so complex, but the rye is nice and up at the forefront. Not bad."

"Nice mellow sweet tone. Rye definitely steps in to give a very good spiced tone to it that is well balanced. Very smooth feel. A very easy drinker. A very nice beer. At first it was a decent beer, but as time went on it got much better. I have a feeling this is better on bottle than draft. Glad to get to try something from Trillium. Very much looking forward to the next."

"Overall: An ok to above average rye beer. The rye is dominate and it mixes well with the other flavors. A solid beer, it just felt like something was missing. I may have appreciated this more if if it came in a smaller size, but a bomber just seemed a bit much. Worth a try, just did not do it for me."

"This is an easy drinking, tasty beer. On the bready side with long lasting, lingering flavors."

"O: A very interesting beer. Enjoyable. Food-friendly. Paired well with Neapolitan-style pizza. That said, I get more ""rye beer"" out of this one than I do ""Farmhouse ale"" as there is much more rye character than there is yeast character. A fine beer none-the-less."
"O-Well done. Not many similar beers that I have come across. I am always down to try another one of Trillium's individual concoctions. Far from my favorite but I respect the effort."

"Overall (4.25/5): Wakerobin is a really interesting spin on the farmhouse/saison ale style. Everything seems to work in perfect balance. The marriage of Saison yeast and rye malt provides a great foundation. The moderately bitter, piney hops work well as a complimentary flavor. And the turbinado sugar helps bring out some subtle dark fruit flavors and help boost the mouthfeel's creaminess. A really good beer that I would love to have again."

"Dry start but malty. It quickly develops a bit of black pepper. The finish unusual but attractive. It's nearly astringent and dies out quickly but retains a lot of the spice. Moderate body with an elevated carbonation level."

"O: Enjoyable farmhouse ale, good layering of flavors and sturdy body. Not the most memorable but certainly a solid effort. Nice job, Trillium!"

"The beer pours a lasting and creamy off white that takes a while to dissipate. The beer itself is a clear copper color with hints of brown. The beer smell has strong rye notes with earthy and floral hops. The smell has notes of apple and cinnamon. Other notes exist such as spices and herbs. The beer taste is less complex. The rye and the hops are the dominant notes that come out. The other notes such as apple and herbs and spices are present but not as noticeable. The texture is medium bodied with biting carbonation and drinks smoothly. A pretty decent rye beer."
""
"O - Frozen glass aside, I don't really think there is much here to get me to try this again. I'm glad I had it, and given a few of its qualities I would like to try more of Trillium's stuff. However, this one just isn't for me."
