"O: Recommended if you want a rye beer that doesn't have a strong hop character to it. This beer really focuses on the rye and other malts. That said, I enjoyed it."

"Overall - This is a smooth rye style beer accentuating a malty body instead of more hoppy flavor like many rye brews seem to focus on. While a tiny bit more hop and a bit more rye flavor would have enhanced the flavors a bit, overall it was rather enjoyable to drink and quite tasty."

"Dry bitter malt, with a hint of hops in the background, lingering afterbite."

"this is definetly not my favorit sam adams beer but it is very drinkable"
"Overall it’s another pleasant brew from Boston Beer Company. I know most people in the craft beer community seem to knock Sam Adams, but I end up having some type of Sam Adams in my beer fridge year-round. Regardless of the stigma that has slowly evolved, I have found most Sam Adams offerings to be extremely drinkable, and still maintain the general characteristics of whatever style they were shooting for. This was an OK beer. I will certainly pick it up again."
"one of my favorites from sam adams regular lineup. got their triple bock and excited to open that."
"O: Not my favorite rye beer, but not one I would turn down either. Nice and dry with a nice balance of rye, malt and hops."
"Poured a walnut brown with a thin white head. Bready aroma, with scents of caramel and light spice. Toasty malts in the taste, bready, light sensation of dried fruits, and a touch of spice. Bitter hops follow, for a fairly dry finish, and a bitter aftertaste. Medium mouthfeel, and fairly drinkable."
"although it’s pretty subtle which makes it an easy drinking an accessible beer."
"I kinda like this beer, it is a good transitionary winter to spring beer...as the lable boasts. I like the red/amber start followed by a subtle (very subtle) piney finish. The beer poured into the glass quite nice, nice amber/red color with foamy white head. Nice carbonation as well. I did not smell to much, so rated it low in that category. The taste is what was described above andit is very easy on the pallete. Another strong beer from Sammy A!"
"D/O: This pale ale is not the most representative of rye-inclusive beers, but it drinks easily enough. It has some appealing herbaceous qualities, but one has to wonder if those were the features really intended to stand out. In the end it is unremarkable but inoffensive."
"O- Tasty and somewhat smooth. A good sam adams beer and a good rye ale. A nice summer beer."
"The nose features rye and sweet malt in roughly equal strength. Toasty, too. Pleasant but mild. Surprising amount of bitterness given the relative lack of hop flavor; the rye kind of fills in the gaps here. Moderately sweet malts. Bitterness, rye, and that's about it, not too interesting."
"Overall: This strikes me as the Boston Lager with a touch of rye. I like BL and could have several cause of this. That said, this is a typical Sam Adams beer with a small twist--of adding the rye. Drink up if you want a different take on you SABL."
"D/O- I must say, the ABV to flavor ratio is wonderful. The result is great drinkability. The bready/grainy qualities mixed with said flavor would bring a BMC drinker to his or her knees. Best of the BBC Spring sampler pack, keep it around Jim!"
"D: Hell yea. It's great for a sessionable beer but it's not my favorite one."
"O: It's alright. Seems like a decent fall beer, a little too dry for the Summer season"
"Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is oily slick coating, which is subtlety sweet. The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium as well. This beer is okay, the rye flavor is slightly muted. To me this beer is just put more beer out in the name of Samuel Adams."
"It's ok, but don't go out of your way for this one."
"O= decent, I wish they'd sell beers like this in their seasonal 6-pack versions rather than just ""the usuals"" like Summer Ale. I bought another seasonal 12-pack just to get 2 more of these but it's getting ridiculous since I give away most of the other beers."
"This beer has a nice dark amber body with a light fizzy 2 finger heat that lays down quickly to a nice sticky lace. The smell is very sweet and malty. The taste is sweet to start off but it finishes with a hop flavor (almost like a strong ipa flavor). The mouth feel is a little thick but smooth. Overall i think it is a good beer."
"Pours a big two finger head, slightly off white and pretty foamy, it's sticking around very well, but I don't know what kind of lacing I'll get out of it. The body is a dark amber color and has medium-large amounts of carbonation, the body is slightly see through, but for the most part it's too dark to see through. Overall it looks very nice, the head has stuck around for quite a while and is giving good lacing. This beer smells like a scotch ale to me, it's got a big malt flavor to it and a very sweet, molasses/maple syrup smell to it. Not much hop aroma at all on the smell. Overall it smells ok, but frankly I think it will be way too sweet. The taste is very interesting, pretty unique. First thing I taste is that molasses/maple syrup taste, and it's not nearly as overpowering as I thought it would be. There is then a taste that I can't quite identify, it might be the rye, but I've had rye beers before and I usually don't get a taste like this, it's kind of like an alcohol-y, plant like taste, it's really weird. Is it a terrible taste? No, but it's very strange. In the finish you get a little bit of a metallicy taste, which is strange because this is out of a bottle. Overall the taste is a little watered down and in the flavors that I do get it's only ok. Part of me wants to give this beer a 3.5 on taste because it's not a bad taste and it's yummy in some areas, but what it comes down to is that it doesn't have enough flavor and it's not too amazing of a flavor, it really wouldn't be fare to all the good beers I've given 3.5. The drinkability is ok, not amazing, but decent. The mouthfeel is pretty good, it's got decent carbonation and it's big enough for the style. Overall it's an ok beer, a little complex, but it lacks the flavor."
"Not worth buying a mix pack just to get it. Not something I would seek out."
"Pours a bright reddish hue, clear, with a thin head, some lacing. Smell is very impressive, sweet honey, whole grain, earthy scent. Taste is not as impressive as scent. Hops is there, rye? Not so much. Has some nice nice qualities but has a bad aftertaste. Mouthfeel is thin, even a bit watery. Overall, not my favorite."
"Overall: A simple and forgettable rye beer. Nothing really pops out here and the rye seems too toned town to make an impact on the flavour. This is too bland for my tastes."
"Taste: Sweet malty flavor with a little bitterness to balance the sweetness. There is a little bit of an alcohol taste in the background."
"Eh. It's not that bad, at least it's crisp and rather refreshing, but it doesn't have a lot to offer in terms of complexity or uniqueness."
"Samuel Adams Revolutionary Rye Ale is a very clear and very sparkling amber ale with a foamy, yellowish, off white head that has excellent retention and lacing. It has an aroma of rye, lemon, grapefruit and grass. It has a smooth, lively, medium-light body with a crisp, dry finish. It's a simple, well balanced flavor that's pretty dry with rye flavor throughout. It seems like there are American hops complementing the rye, but there's also something pretty grassy going on in there. It's amply bitter and it leaves me thirsty enough to need another sip. This is really easy to drink. I could have a few of these and not blow my palate."
"Overall, this beer is okay but lacking the big hit of rye that I wanted. The berry esters kind of bury everything other than the caramel and bread for me."
"Revolutionary Rye Ale is a decent Rye Ale – not “earthshaking” however, worth a try if you like the style."
"O: Not a ton of flavors blending together but not bad. It's light enough to drink a few but differentiated enough to keep you curious."
"The beer pours an orange-amber color with a white head. The aroma has a lot of bready malt as well as a lot of rye. The flavor is more of the same. I get a lot of rye and toffee, as well as some bready malt and a little bit of orange citrus hops. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not the best beer from Boston Beer Company, but I am a sucker for rye beers and I found this one to be very nice."
"Poured this into the Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass out of respect...I actually use this glass for lots of beers. Respectable two finger head that lasted quite a while, with some fine clinging lace. Color is a 11 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell is mostly of hops, lots of them, with a little wheat, and a touch of rye. Flavor leans to the hop side with flavors of grapefruit and lime, with a wheat bread taste next, and a faint hint of rye. I thought I would taste much more rye. Good full feeling in my mouth, smooth like cream with cling, and just about the right amount of zing. I was hoping for a little more rye flavor, but what I got from this beer was good, but not quite what I was hoping. Good flavor anyway, and if I see it again, I will get some."
"D: This had a pretty weak scent and taste, but at least it was clean and really easy to drink. Like the Sam Adams Pale Ale with a hint of rye. I wish there was more rye and less breadiness. Kind of disappointing...now I want a Hop Rod."
"Served from a 12 oz bottle. Pours with a significant off-white/ecru colored head that persists quite nicely. Beer itself is an attractive amber/medium copper. Aroma is pleasant, but is overly dominated by hoppy/citrus notes. The anticipated malty rye presence is barely detectable. In and of itself, the taste is solid and enjoyable, but once again, I had hoped for a more significant rye flavor. The rye is realy only to be found in a pleasant but not overpowering sour aftertaste. Mouthfeel is typically SA, which is to say moderatley full-bodied with a nice level of carbonation. Overall, this is an enjoyable beer, but I certainly would have appreciated more rye character throughout."
" Rye beers are fun and easy and I'm all about it."
"Pour from 12 oz bottle to snifter and it poured a dark copper color with a moderate head of tiny bubbles that didn't hang around very long. On the nose were orange citrus with spicey rye. The first taste was sweet malt and then the citrus hoppy rye. A little thin. An OK beer, I was just wishing and waiting for more flavor to burst forth."
"D - OK drinking. Could use some more sweetness."
"Maybe I'm just not good at reviewing beer. I like it all! The thing with sam adams though is recently i feel the quality has gone downhill. I think they have weakened the taste of their beers to appeal to the masses...or maybe my taste has just gone to the stronger beers :) anyway, this beer is above average as far as sam adams beer goes. at least 30% stronger than the boston lager. maybe that's why i like it. i expected an average rating from BA though so not surprised the bros gave it a C."
"Pretty much what I expect from Sam Adams. A solid beer again, the hops here are a bit better than other SA products. Easy to drink and enjoyable, a nice price as well."
"O: I enjoyed drinking this beer but it has little to no rye character. If you want rye beers, turn to Bear Republic for Ryevenator and Hop Rod Rye. Revolutionary Rye is an inobtrusive, sweetish beer that would work as an outstanding session beer, but it misses the mark as a rye beer in most ways."
"D- i was really hoping for more out of this one. they should have used more and stronger hops. i really like rye/IPA hybrids. i dont think ill seek this one out again."
"Taste is similarly disappointing. The rye is bairly there and it is difficult to determine if the toasted malt or hops are weakest. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium. Altogether this is a disappointing effort. It fails to insult or impress."
"Overall this was pretty good. Again I don’t really know too much about it, but it"
"O - Even though there was not enough rye character for me, I still found this to be quite enjoyable, and very easy to drink. Negative points for being away from what I want for a rye, but bonus points for being overall tasty and easy to drink."
"Overall impression: Drinkable and decent - but nothing overly exciting here."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, with a light body, a light, crisp feel and an overall subtle sweetness that flows down easy. A real nice beer that has just enough rye to make it different, yet is still close enough to a ""standard beer"" that this could make a good session beer."
"O: My least favorite SA brew from the spring Variety pack."
"Clear and bright red hued amber with a frothy white head in the glass. Smell is very light caramel and other base malts maybe a bit of gassy hop and a touch of yeast but everything is very mild. The taste is nice but nothing special. It is a basic amber ale with all of the expected malt profile. Hop bitterness is pretty solid and reminiscent of the boston lager. The rye doesn't add much in the way of flavor maybe a bit of contrast to the hops but not much beyond that. Body is medium along with average carbonation and dry finish make the mouthfeel pretty good. Overall I'm not entirely impressed with this beer. I've had limited exposure to rye beers mainly in the form of homebrewed examples where the rye was a much more predominate player in the taste profile. I expected something more along those lines and this beer and it wasn't to be had. It is a good beer but not a great rye beer."
"D: A well-balanced flavor and light body makes this one quite easy-drinking."
"Overall: this beer was decent. Nothing outstanding, but I would drink it ahain. I like rye in my beer, and it is nice to see it going around."
"Sam Adams Rye, 12oz's into Nonic. Nice red/amber color with a very light tan 1/2"" head, leaving nice lace. Caramel dominates the nose along with pale malts and very little rye. Flavor is of their celebrated Irish Red, but not so heavy in the Crystal department. Feels full in body with perfect carbonation in my opinion. I typically enjoy a lighter, higher IBU rye than this with a thinner body, but this beer is a welcome addition to the SA line up. Once again, a decent beer from SA. Cheers!"
"A clear, copper colored brew, finger-sized cream colored head. Scent is caramel malts and some bitter hops. Malty taste, caramel, some rye, nice floral hop background. Pretty full mouth, kinda has a sharp bite to it as well. I kinda like it, but it isnt an all-time favorite. Won't mind having a couple in their sampler a few times this summer though."
"Drinkability- I thought it was pretty good. I would probably drink it again. Sam Adams usually does a pretty stable job with their beers. They are usually pretty good."
"Overall: I'm not gonna lie, this was one of the motivating factor in me buying the spring mixed 12 pack, and I'm a little disappointed with it, not nearly as good as the winter one. Its something different from Sam, but I think they need to stop playing it so safe with some of this stuff and just make it more interesting. I see no compelling reason why I would want to pick up a six pack of this (if it were available) and other than the taste of rye, nothing about this stands out. This feels like Sam has a standard ale recipe that they just tweaked to add rye to. It is a decent rye beer, but it just feels uninspired. Oh well, I guess I should pay more attention to reviews when picking up Sam Adams now."
"Not a bad beer, except the noble pils, most Sam Adams beers taste watered down to me now. They've gotten progressively worse over the years."
"Overall impression: Meh. Not good. Not bad. Not hoppy enough to push the limits and not enough malt character to keep it interesting. Seems a little too safe for me. Well crafted but forgettable."
"I'm not sure how long it's been exactly since I last sampled a brand new brew from Sam Adams (as opposed to just new to me), but it feels like a long time. This n00b pours a clear amber-russet topped by a half-finger of dirty white foam. The nose comprises spicy rye bread (my favorite kind), caramel, orange peel, and a touch of pine in the distance. The taste really runs with the spice idea, bringing in a bunch o' black pepper, nutmeg, and clove. Some rye and sourdough bready up the works a bit, only to have some toasted toffee rush in and take everything over. Things are a bit too disjointed for my liking, with the various strong flavors all vying for my tongue's attention without any semblance of cooperation. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, an okay rye beer, but the competing flavors just don't do it for me in the long run."
"Overall this is an ok beer, I will probably share away what I have and not purchase this again"
"A solid rye beer with nice flavors and balance and a surprisingly full body/texture."
"The Revolutionary Rye Ale just lacked anything and everything. It had a very slight taste which faded very quickly. The aftertaste was stale and hollow. I really wanted to like it, but it just didn't do much for me."
"Overall this is a pretty good beer. Pretty basic, but it goes down really easy, and has nice body. This is a pretty good sipper."
"overall, this is not a very characteristic rye - but a decent sipper."
"drinkability: this is a good sessionable ale. It's not overpowering with hops, rye, or body. Just good."
"Not worth trying. Could easily throw a 6 pack of this back. If you want THE Rye beer, get Founders Red Rye or Hot Rod Red Rye."
"D - Quite the sessionable offering from folks at Boston Beer... A solid beer for any occasion... Unfortunately, a beer named Revolutionary Rye should make much more a rye punch... The rye is quite timid, but otherwise this is a solid offering..."
"overall i'm underwhelmed by this offering. i wasn't expecting the total lack of soul this rye beer serves up. it's not bad by any means, just weak and lacking in my opinion. an average beer and not one i would recommend."
"Overall: A decent version of a Rye."
"Overall pretty good, its like noble pils with a hint of rye and bit more pale and crystal malts. Very drinkable."
"I love rye. I think *more* in this beer would have made it better."
"Boston Beer Company--Samuel Adams--Revolutionary Rye Ale--American Originals--2011 12 oz. Bottle. 5.50% ABV. 25 IBU's? (3.75 / 5.0) No sediment. Big foamy mild lace lasting light orange white head. Clean pretty bright rich amber color. Mild rye spice ester rusty mild hop front. Dry sweet crusty hint malty earthy rye spiced caramel mellow fruit hint body. Mild hop lingering rye flavored rusty clean refreshing end. Nice smooth mild fruit Rye Amber Ale. Easy mellow flavor. Noticeable crusty Rye notes are blended in well. Sampled 3/23/2011. Purchased for $1.25 2 Fred Meyer--Ballard. Seattle on 3/22/2011."
"Finish: Grass with a light citric hoppyness"
"Crisp carbonation and a pretty small body lead to high drinkability, but the interest factor isn't there for me. Not bad, but pretty simple."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. Fairly easy drinking but having it once was enough. It finishes crisp but the flavors don't really meld or sit right with me. Overall this brew left me wanting more. For less than 5%, the alcohol is not hidden, it creeps in through the back."
"In the slew of Sam Adams that are good but not great, I'd say this is one of the better ones. Tasty, easy drinking."
"A very drinkable beer, though not a favorite, I would not turn this one down."
"O - Overall a fine beer. Nothing exceptional, but good. Drink easy and has some interesting characteristics. An average attempt at a Rye beer."
"D: This is a fine drinking beer. But it needs more rye character to really stand out and shine. I like the overall hop and malt balance, but if you put rye in the name, especially in hyperbolic manner, I want it to be more apparent in the actual beer."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, very good representation of style, this is a very solid beer worth drinking for a while."
"O - Another nice offering from BBC. I would have this one again, but I don't think I would seek it out."
"O- In general, an extremely sessionable beer with enough unique flavor to separate it from a standard session beer. Would buy again."
"Overall: A very enjoyable beer and stands well against others of its style. Compared to other beers in the Samuel Adams lineup, though, this is one of the better offerings they have."
"O - Not bad. Nice flavor and balance."
"12 oz bottle. Pours amber with a white, short-lived head. Aroma is of spicy rye, citrusy, piney hops and some hints of sweet malt. Medium, sharp body. Spicy, bitter rye dominates the flavor, while citrusy, piney hops add to the rough edges. Long, earthy, bitter finish. Love it or hate it brew, that require some getting used to."
"Tastes very distinctly Sam Adams. Grainy, malty sweetness up front with a touch of spiciness from the rye. Slick, somewhat buttery mouthfeel; the diacetyl really detracts from the texture. Mild but lingering hop bitterness clings to the tongue in the finish, displaying a leafy and earthy character. Pretty generic and uninspired stuff, but it isn't awful."
"Final Notes: Just not doing it for me, I'm afraid. Fairly bland on the palate except for that back end which just builds and kicks you in your ass. I would have much preferred the Belgian IPA over this."
"O: Hoppier than I thought it'd be."
"Mouthfeel: Great after taste."
"On tap at McCovey's in Walnut Creek. The tap handle said Seasonal Release. Brought to the table in a pint glass and it had no head whatsoever but after a little agitating the whote head appeared. Amber color with white foamy head that dissapates quickly. Light orange aroma with some definitey hardy rye whiffs but nothing special. Taste is definitely on the rye side and malty. Slight bittering hops on the swallow with a minor rye-like aftertaste. After consuming one pint I was not looking to take another down at all. I have wanted to like the Sam Adams beers for along time, but again and again I am not getting anything that makes them stand out from any other beers. This one included."
"Overall: Another good beer from Samuel Adams. As with most of Sam's other beers, this beer is far from world-class but is still an accessible, inexpensive beer that interprets a style in a faithful way. Sam Adams' seasonal mixed packs remain a go-to for me and this beer is no different in that regard."
"O: This darker wheat beer is a style i am unfamiliar with, but am starting to like Tastes like a summer baseball game."
"D-The winner of the Beer Lovers Choice is a little disappointing, this is what people chose to be their next beer. However a good introduction to the style."
"O - A somewhat easy drinking beer. Unfortnately a bit boring, even though there is a reasonable combination of hops and malts. Smooth. I would have this again, but wouldn't be something I'd reach for regularly."
"I would love to see the rye character turned up a notch, but also simultaneously appreciate the overall tame nature of the offering. Sam Adams makes it possible for the uninitiated to enjoy and feel comfortable with good beer."
"D - Fairly drinkable. Aftertaste is a bit strange, and the middle of the taste is fairly empty feeling. Could use a bit more flavor here. Otherwise, it starts well and feel really smooth."
"D: Very well balanced and very flavorful for a rye ale. It has some fine qualities without many faults. I enjoyed drinking this one."
"OVERALL GRADE: B/B+"
"I'm not sure what makes this beer a ""revolutionary"" rye ale. It tastes like a very well made English ESB, or maybe an 80 shilling, or even an Irish red. A solid beer, fish-n-chips all the way, but let's not get excited here."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Sour and light bodied. The caramel notes are pretty tasty, but this is nothing all that impressive."
"Bottle. Pours a delightful red/copper color with a small white head. Aroma is subtle rye notes. Caramel and bready malts. Taste is sweet rye malts. Some grassy hops towards the finish. Exceptional smooth and creamy mouthfeel and extremely well balanced."
"D - Quite a drinkable beer, either on its own or as a session."
"Drinkable yes as are most Sammys. Worth seeking, worth a try esp. in the variety pack."
"Drinkability - Goes down easily, but a style I don't particularly like. However, I did enjoy this."
"Amber-brown in color with a small amount of off-white head. Medium bodied with a super creamy mouthfeel. Palate isn't overly complex, which works well. Caramel malts, modest floral hop flavor and a bit of black licorice and raisan, from the rye. Pretty balanced and straight forward beer. Just enough flavor to keep it interesting. Would make a nice intro to rye beers."
"D- This beer is not bad, and is an easy drinker, just could have used a little more punch imo."
"Drinkability is SUPERB!! LOVE...LOVE...LOVE this beer! could drink it ALL THE TIME!!!"
"This beer pours a clear light amber color with craggy white foam on the surface. The aroma has a sweet malty aroma with a citrusy hop nose as well. A hint of the rye can be noted in the back as there is a very very minor touch of sour. The taste is rather bland. There is a malty flavor and that's truly it. The mouthfeel is pretty dry and there is almost a metallic finish to it. It's a decently drinkable beer. I wouldn't turn this beer down if offered to me, but I probably won't seek it out either."
"D: Flavorful but not aggressive and oh so smooth drinking. I could put back quite a few of these."
"This beer is one for the log books for me. I hope that the keg I had this from was not an anomoly, and all batches for are this good. My tastebuds rate this a near perfect beer."
"Pretty, clear, caramel-amber color. A thickish, off-white head sticks all over the sides. Slow carb trailers - a delicious-looking beer. Smell is hoppy and blended with rye malts all the while. Taste is oily, pithy hops, with the same backbone of roasted barley and rye. Clean, crackery taste. Finishes dry and tight. A bit of that pithy hops afterwards. Kind of a 2-D beer, but it is what it claims to be. I'd drink this one every so often."
"D: One of those middle of the road beers that Sam Adams puts out, but this one is one the below average end. Innocuous and boring."
"Overall this is a well made beer, but not one that I am a huge fan of. I love rye ales but this just seems really busy to me and I have a hard time enjoying many of the flavors. It is drinkable and attractive, but it is not something I will ever seek out again."
"D) A decent beer. I'd have another."
"Drinkability: A full-bodied brew that would be great with a surf and turf platter."
"Clear chestnut, a little bit of a burnt orange hue, with a fluffy beige cap. Lots of sticky, clumpy lacing and great head retention. Looks nice! Mild aroma, dry malt and light orange rind, slightly bready. Moderate citrus bitterness throughout, oranges and toasted malt, sweet, a bit spicy in the finish. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation, texture was on the creamy side but with a little crispness towards the end. Overall, pretty good for kicking back with."
"D: drinkable, but not extraordinary. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I was not blown away."
"Overall: A really good easy drinking, well balanced beer. Spiciness keeps things interesting and dryness makes it goes down easy. Best Sam Adams beer I've had since Chocolate Bock."
"12 oz bottle into a snifter...had high expectations for this beer since the Noble Pils and Boston Lager are both fine examples of their respective styles...a little disappointed...although it's not bad, it really doesn't compare to what I consider 'championship ryes' like Hop Rod Rye for example. It does have some rye bite but fails to be big winner. I purchased a 12 pack with 6 different kinds of Samuel Adams, but so far not a lot of winners other than the two I already like, the fine Noble Pils and the decent Boston Lager. Skip this if you're a serious rye-head, but if you don't drink ryes that often and just want to have one, it's not too bad."
"I love the taste of rye, and I feel like this is a great rye beer. This beer is not quite as smooth as the Terrapin rye beer and is a bit sharper with more tofee character. I find the hop bitterness a bit too sharp at times, and it does not complement the rye as it should. Mouthfeel is heavy but moderately drinkable."
"The mouthfeel is medium-bodied, smooth and extremely crisp, and the drinkability is exceptional. Why do they only give you two of these, I would love to be able to session it. A great one-off from Sam Adams that I really hope sees its way into general rotation."
"Notes: Recommended. This is the only rye beer I have had, so nothing in the style I can compare to, but...I liked it and would drink again. The rye makes an interesting twist in taste."
"12oz. bottle served in my SA Perfect Pint. Enjoy Before June notched on the label. Pours a translucent copper with a half inch, loose, cream-colored head that quick;y sizzles and dissipates into a thin slick and a frothy band. Specks of lacing clustered on the glass during the tasting and exhibited good adherence. Not much happening in the nose - light malt with some sweet and fruity notes and a slightly metallic aroma. Taste follows nose; however a little less fruity. There's also a light, bittering hops that comes out towards the middle but dissipates towards the finish. Mouthfeel is medium-light with an almost prickly, palate cleaning carbonation. A decent brew, but I'm not disappointed that there were only two in the 12-pack."
"An overall solid drinkable brew."
"D - I had 2 and enjoyed it. I really need to try some other Rye beers to better review this. I will come back to this one again."
"Pours clear amber with thin, off-white head that lasts. Good carbonation and some lacing. Subtle pine and floral hops in the aroma with a crisp malt character. A bit spicy smelling. A nice hop bite in the flavor is well; pleasantly bitter with a dry malty finish. Some caramel and bread flavors along with ample pine resin. Medium bodied. Overall I'm pretty impressed by this offering; if it came out in its own 6 packs I'd get a couple now and then. The flavor and character of rye beers go really well with the pine resin hop notes in my opinion."
"This reminds me alot of the other Sam Adams beers. Most have a few nuiances to let you know the style but does not go above and beyond to really bring it all in."
"I would drink this beer again and its a nice mix up since the last 2 seasonal beers, octoberfest and winter lager are very good, but very similar to each other. This Rye Ale is a nice compliment to the other spring brew, Noble Pills."
"I expected more from a Rye Beer from Sam Adams, it was decent but nothing more."
"Overall, a beer that truly brings the rye to the frontlines. Every aspect of the ingredient is noticed: cereal aromas, sourness, and a slick mouthfeel. I definitely appreciate the fact that Samuel Adams made this rye ale truly a rye ale, though it's nothing extraordinary. Still worth and try, and I think it would be a great addition to the year round six packs."
"Bottom line is, this is a good, tasty beer that COULD be outstanding but is instead ""merely"" a very tasty, drinkable beer. (I've had it on tap; it's far better that way.)"
"I really like rye beers and don't think I've ever met one I didn't like. With that said, this one is far from spectacular but very solid and highly drinkable."
"I know I didn't really say much here about this brew, but there's really not a lot to say about it. The primary though I get from this is, ""Eh""."
"This, at the right price, could be an all nighter for me. Pretty easy drinker though misses the rye mark I think."
"D-the tastes seem to merge as the beer goes on. it goes down fairly easily. to be honest, this might be my favorite out of the spring seasonal. i would've much rather just bought a 12 pack of this instead."
"Verdict: I'm a little torn on this one. I wasn't too sure whether I liked it. It's considered a rye beer but I got a lot of other things in this beer that took over on the flavor. It's relatively new, so perhaps there can be a mend on that rye component and we'd have an award winner. In the meantime, it's nothing horrible, so if you find a single, get it! B- (3.4)"
"D - This beer is ok but after a sip or two I don't find much left to keep me interested. It's almost like a bitter Boston Lager. There are no major flaws and the beer is drinkable, but I think I'll move on to something else."
"Overall: Seems like a decently crafted beer, but not necessarily something I'd go for again. I'll have to seek out others in the rye style to compare."
"D: I'd buy this in a sampler and be happy getting it but wouldn't buy it alone."
"Soft pine sap, sweet and toasty whole wheat bread malt. Good but subtle aroma. Tastes like it smells only toned down. Has that Sam Adams good but with the volume turned down character to it. I like it, I just would like to see it turned up a few notches."
"I could drink several of these at a sitting. Too bad there's only 2 in this 12-pk. Nowhere near being a flavor bomb, but it's a nice beer to quaff after a long day at work."
"Overall - I was expecting a big Rye Pale ale or IPA, but this is a bit more subdued. The hops are earthy and spicy, but I think a C-hop would fit the bill better. This is a very good beer, but not an exciting one."
"I love SA's lager, but this brew is just another repackaged Sam adams' ale in a different label with a little variation in ingredients. I need more than this."
"A very nice rye beer. Lots of rye bread that I love. Overall, fairly simple, but very enjoyable. Something I would recommend."
"Wish this came in sixers, good overall but doesn't hold up to the higher end rye beers. Still, it's worth a look."
"D: A decent brew. The 4.9 abv makes it a viable session option, though this time of year I would definitely take Noble Pils over this."
"Samual Adams Revolutionary Rye, poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Appears brownish orange, fairly light and somewhat cloudy. Long lasting head and some lacework down the glass. In the flavor a creamy maltyness with a dash of spicy rye. The peppery rye/hop interaction is there at the very end giving way to a smooth refreshing finish. Hop bitterness is mild but there. Easy drinking, well rounded, decent all around brew from BBC."
"Overall, not the best beer in the world but not the worst. One of the better Sam Adams' beers out there. I don't know where I'd place it in the current seasonal Sam Adams case but this was okay. Cheers!"
"D - All the above said, it's a fairly drinkable beer."
"D - Yeah, this is good drinking. It's completely unexciting but is solid and fine to drink."
"nicely carbonated, but almost drinks sour. not my favorite BBC SA beer i have had."
"I guess I just wished they took this somewhere new. They probably could've called this an Altbier and nobody would've noticed."
"Samuel Adams Revolutionary Rye Ale was amber in color with good clarity. It had creamy off-white head with good retention and lacing. The smell was rye bread and citric hops. The taste was malt, rye, spices, and citrus hops. The finish was long and dry. The mouthfeel was good with a medium body and good carbonation. Drinkability was good. This is a decent Rye Beer and worth a try."
"Could be a good session beer."
"D - It has pretty good drinkability. It goes down easy, and I could drink quite a few of these in a sitting. I wish there was more of a rye presence, as well as some more hop presence. I'd say that it's worth a try though."
"Despite the fact that this beer was executed well and was a fine addition to the variety pack, I am guessing it will be ultimately forgettable. Definitely not a problem to drink though. Solid, but not spectacular. Benefits from being in an uncrowded style. Maybe I was generous in this score since I can't think of any true comparables."
"Taste is a bit brighter yet quite similar with a light buttery caramel flavor coupled with a coarse and spicy finish which helps embolden the feel a bit. Pretty full bodied for a Sam beer yet not overly malty either, making for a simple yet quaffable brew which improves with some warming. Though not likely to start a revolution anytime soon, this is a good offering from Sam, lacking only in the hops department on the aroma."
"Would drink this again, but wouldn't seek it out."
"This is pretty good. I wasn't blown away by he taste, but it was still pretty good."
"D. A decent brew I could have a few of these with no issues, decent nose and a good flavor."
"D - Well another drinkable beer from Samuel Adams, what more could you expect. This beer is very balanced and drinkable to me, I liked the subtle hints of rye in the smell and taste, and I always enjoy the drinkability of the Sam line. I think it's worth a try and if they ever made this in a 12 pack for about $12.99 or less, that would be awesome. I think I'd try this again sometime. Cheers!"
"Would i have this again? I certainly wouldn't turn it down. It's nothing to write home about but a decent addition to SA's arsenal of beers."
"D. Easygoing but if I'm doing pale ale it's not my first pick."
"Pours a medium copper with a small off white head that fades fast. The smell is not very powerful, some malt, rye and sweet notes. Nothing that jumps out. Starts citrus and sweet with some strong rye notes up front, and that are the main focus throughout. The rye flavor gets stronger and finishes with a nice bitter tone, and a potent aftertaste. A medium/light body, nice carbonation and flavor balance. This beer seems like it went through a few test phases before settling on a finished product, but this is very enjoyable. This one has a good amount of flavor, a great drinker, a very refreshing beer."
"A nice surprise, as I wasn't expected much."
"D: Not my favorite tick from Sam Adams, but a cool rye beer. I do wish it was a bit more heavy handed on the hops, though."
"Nice drinkable rye beer could have quite a few of these."
"Pours a perfectly pale copper hue with a bright off white head froms fine speckled lacing scattered around the sides of my Sam Smith imperial pint glass. The rye gives it a bit of girth the head holds together really well and has a dimpled rising bread dought appearance. Aroma has a nice spicy rye with hints of pine/citrus in the American hop additions. Overall presence of caramel malt and breadiness makes for a nicely balanced beer. Spicy rye assertive bready malt character with hints of caramel malt, pine and citrus hops bursts but doesn't kill with bitterness just a nice complementary hop/rye combo, not overdone in anyway. Medium bodied ale, a bit of extra girth from the rye additions, carbonation was mellow and smooth on the palate. Nice change of paced from the typical beers that Sam Adams has been putting out, Coastal Wheat, Blackberry witbier, Summer Wheat, and White ale...how many mediocre wheat beers do you have to have."
"Again, a simple, balanced take on the style from SA. Drink it if it's there, but there are many more exciting and impressive examples out that I would recommend before this one."
"Poured a very nice copper color, although with just a bit of initial head and no lacing to speak of. Nice scent, with a decent sweet malty tone under a crisp and semi-spicy rye aroma. Nice taste, a very good pale ale start with a good peppery-rye taste as it goes down, followed with just a hint of spicy hops. Went down very smoothly, one of the smoothest rye beers I've had (although without quite as much rye flavor as usual, either)."
"12oz bottle with a Best Before Date Notched at July. Pours a translucent burnt orange with a thin head. Tons of lacing. Aromas of yeast, orange, and malts. Taste is more of the same. Orange, with a bit of a sourness to it, yeast, and malts. This brew is kind of what I've come to expect from Sam Adams. Decent but doesn't really impress."
"FourthBeer rating: BELOW AVERAGE. It's not a bad beer, but there's nothing that really stands out, and the breadiness gets somewhat monotonous quickly. BBC seems like its trying too hard here."
"Drinkability is the best part of this beer. The tastes of this beer are so well balanced that the drink goes down nice and easy. An awesome new selection from Sam that I would recommend for anyone. I will be upset when this one goes away."
"Drinkability: A temperate rye brew. It's simple, but it satisfies. A decent addition to the current SA multi-pack."
"D- A decent take on the style. A bit rich and robust for the alcohol content, but it is tasty."
"Pretty good beer, well worth trying, but one that could be better as well."
"Two finger head with an ample amount of lacing. The color is a dark gold or light amber color. Smell is of spice and hops. good smell especially as it warms up. Taste is very similiar with a hop taste at the finish. Mouthfeel is clean and drinkiability is good."
"Drink drink drink. Could have a few of these and not be tired of it... not that i'd go out of my way to do so."
"As a rye beer, this is a disappointment. I don't pick up much rye and the hops don't show in the flavor. That said, it is not a bad beer, no off flavors, just more of an amber ale."
"D: It's, essentially, an amber ale with some extra complexity of flavor. Of course it's drinkable. Watch the ""unknown"" ABV turn out to be, like, 7%, though..."
"Poured straight from my growler, nice thick 2-finger head. Drinking it now actually and it's surprising that the ABV is what it is. It's 5.5% ABV btw. I thought it was a bit higher. Mouth feel is good, very drinkable. It tastes a bit sweet going down but with a slightly bitter aftertaste though. I'm enjoying it, not as much as the Sleigh Ryed (Great South Bay Brewery, NY) I had 2 days ago, which is also a Rye Ale. I think it's just Sam Adams but I do enjoy this one a lot more than other beers I have had by them. I expected a bit sweeter taste this being a Rye Ale but I'm not disappointed. Definitely can't see it being a session beer though might have it again."
"D: This is a nice beer that didn't blow me away. Still, I'm glad I grabbed it."
"Mouthfeel has a slightly dry feeling to it and is rather light but pleasant overall. Not a bad offering from BBC, but I want more rye."
"M/D - Medium bodied beer that i could drink one or two of, but not several."
"The beer pours a nice amber color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a dry pale and crystal malt scent along with a hint of rye spiciness. It's not as pronounced as some. The taste is decent as well. It has a standard amber/red ale composition; pale and crystal malts, moderate hop bitterness. The rye is present, but basically adds a touch of spiciness that compliments the hops. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking beer. It's not overly complex, nor heavy on the rye. It is, however an excellent session ale that's accessible to those new to rye beers."
"Why can't they, SA, make more beers of this quality? Not that (I'm only now finding) all their other offerings are all that lame. They have some good stuff. But this is a fine recipe, untainted by misguided musings or palate-ine dalliances. I'll echo the feelings of a few here and suggest they should put out 6-pks of this. But what's the point?"
"Overall a toned-down rye malt bill where the subtle European hops were showcased nicely against the rye malt. A slight toffee-like backdrop with a delicately spicy middle ala the rye malt and earthy hops. Beautifully balanced and dare I say a wonderful springtime beer."
"Amber colored ale with a medium creamy white head. Slight roasted malt aroma that gets taken over by a fruity hop presence. Coppery flavor with a slight bitterness from the rye. A little bit too heavy on the citrus from the hops. I would really like a bit more of the malt to come through in the flavor. Medium bodied and not too dry with good carbonation. Very drinkable despite the slight dryness. A good beer and something I would drink again, but could benefit from toning down the hops a bit."
"D - Not bad, went well with the burger I had. Still, same old, same old."
"Taste, ok, good rye introduction, quaint spiciness. Wouldn't call it revolutionary, tastes like a lot of their more popular stuff, with just a component of it rye based malt. Definitely easy to drink, a little curve ball for you. Could definitely be something really appreciated by people moving up from BMC."
"Pretty smooth, slgihtly sweet aftertaste. Mild presence of alcohol. Decent beer overall. The rye makes it's presence known but isn't overpowering."
"D - This is a drinkable rye beer. I won't seek it out again, but it was worth a try."
"From a Samuel Adams glass, this beer is a very clear medium amber color. Modest head, with just a little lace. The aroma is a bit lacking, with a slight spiciness and a grain scent. The taste is very nice. Lots of malt and grain flavors. The beer is very well balanced, with a framing sweetness and firm bitterness. Firm and semi-full body. Nice beer."
"Hmm didn't even know Sam Adams came out with a new beer. Part of the new spring mixed sampler pack. Pours a light amber color, faint bready aroma to it. Taste is pretty light bodied, some nice spiciness to it. Breadiness and rye definitely come through, pretty decent taste for such a light bodied beer. Nothing too big here, but definitely drinkable for sure. One of the better rye beers I've had, but it's generally a boring style in my opinion."
"Pours a crystal-clear amber color with a very tiny white head that is gone with the blink of an eye. Scent is hoppy with hints of rye bread. There are also some piney notes with spices and caramel malt. Taste is exactly how it smells...Very interesting tasting beer. It tastes like a pale ale with a German backbone. The rye flavors and bready notes are definitely there with some strong malt and gentle hops. It ends with slightly bitter and very sweet/spicy flavors that aren't very appealing...not digging the finishing flavors. Mouthfeel is quite light with very clean, crisp finish. Drinkability is fairly high, despite the unattractive finish."
"D/M: Very crisp and drink able. Not too overpowering. It really is a decently drinkable beer but the rye aspect is not very evident. It appears to be too watered down. I wanted more of a rich bite to the beer."
"Drinkability - Not a bad tasting brew, but not terribly unique. It's nice to taste the rye, but it could be a little more prominent."
"I'll first say that I'm not a fan of rye and most beers with rye in it - so me finding this as drinkable as I did was rather surprising. But really, the flavor and aroma just aren't very interesting. Worth a try from the sampler pack, though, I suppose."
"D: Not exactly as assertive as I was hoping for. Emboldening all the flavors would do this beer some good, especially bringing the rye to a more prominent position and adding more spiciness."
"Poured into a slender pint glass (Yazoo Brewing Co). Deep copper color with a two finger white head. The aroma is the rye and spicy hops. The flavor is much the same as the aroma. The tang of the rye shows throughout the brew. medium carbonation and the body is medium as well. Would be a nice session beer."
"The beer has nice carbonation and a dark red/orange color. It smells like rye, I guess. The taste is nicely malty, with a hop finish. Although there are many better beers out there, I always enjoy the many different offerings from Sam Adams. This one is no exception. Spectacular? No. Enjoyable as usual? Yes."
"Overall a tasty selection from SA."
"I could probably drink a lot if these. And I'm going to now. ."
"Drinkability is good. Tasty beer that disappears all to quickly."
"Would put this on the ""won't let you down"" list."
"in the mouth feel it's crisp and medium in body, with a good amount of CO2. Altogether a good drinking beer, but a little light in any dominant characteristic."
"12oz bottle purchased as part of the spring seasonal mix-pack at Shaw's in Windham. Pours a crystal-clear amber-red body with nearly an inch of off-white head. Citrus grassy hops and rye notes make up the aroma. Lemon, grass, rye, caramel, and grapefruit round out the flavor. Medium in both body and carbonation. Very drinkable. I liked it better than I thought I would. One of the better rye beers I've had."
"D - goes down easy enough."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, Revolutionary Rye Ale is a redish-amber color with a cream colored, creamy looking head. Nose is mainly of rye with some piney, resinous hops. The flavor is also dominated by rye with a bitter hoppiness and slight caramel malt background. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a light yet creamy carbonation. Overall beer is to style, takes some getting used to but is not a bad beer."
"D - Quite drinkable. The aroma is very pleasant and the flavor more or less reflects it. The spicy rye works quite well with the pine hop character and the rich, toasty malt provides a solid background for this relationship to play out upon. A pretty nice rye pale ale, though not quite as good as Terrapin."
"Crystalline copper with a tall, persistent, dense rocky head. Mild spicy malt aroma, biscuity/bready with a touch of hops. Slightly sweet and spicy flavor with a certain ""Sam Adams-ness"" to it. Nothing exciting, but nothing terrible. Creamy, oily texture with some rye bite. Crisp and medium bodied. Simple, but I could drink a few."
"I remember sampling this at the Vermont Brewers Festival back in July of 2010, long before it was chosen as their newest recipe. Very easy to drink and highly enjoyable. I would strongly recommend it."
"Cheers BBC!"
"Beer pours out a deep copper color with a very creamy looking white head. There is already some lacing on my glass. Smells very piney (cascades?) and some herbal hop notes, perhaps a tad sweet maltiness settled in the base aromas. Tastes somewhat crisp and a little dry, and has a nice citrus palate cleansing aftertaste. This beer has a nice balance between the malts and the hops. Rye is somewhat faint but in the background gives a spicey taste. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy. Overall this a good interpretation of the style and would be a welcome addition to their regular offering."
"D: Easy to drink and fits the time well. Good winter-spring transitional beer"
"Overall drinkability - after the look and aroma, it definitely goes south. Not a bad beer...actually very drinkable....but uneventful and ordinary. NOt a bad session ale. Would try again...but I wouldn't go out of my way."
"Flavorful yet drinkable, what a great beer! Pours simply gorgeous with deep amber color and rich, creamy head. Beautiful. Nose has a mixture of herbal components and light caramel, with a clean toasty grain aroma that is pleasing. On the palate the rye is apparent but also blends nicely with the toasty caramelly sweetness, smooth mouthfeel, and exceptional drinkability. Yet another successful craft beer from this amazing brewery."
"Taste is fantastic and the color is right for a RYE beer. As others have said, it does have some sour to it, but that is normal for a RYE brew. As usual, Sam adams has a winner."
"Good for what it is, but nothing too special."
"Drinkability - Love the taste but definitely more of a beer with dinner than a drink as much as I can."
"I enjoyed this one. Lots of interesting flavors which are well balanced. Similar to many other offerings from Sam Adams but tasty just the same."
"M/D: Super drinkable. Smooth yet bubbly mouthfeel. Well done."
"Drinkability: The overall experience of this beer is real nice but extremely mild. No overpowering moments anywhere. Would be a great ""session"" beer, but not something I would be likely to go for on a regular occasion otherwise."
"D- A very malty medium to heavy bodied Rye. The sweetness is a bit much, and I would consider this beer to be a malt bomb. I think that a bit more of a smokey note would have been nice in the beer, but hey it won the contest to be the next SA beer. I tried this after having the Belgian IPA that came in second in the taste off. Not sure how this beer won out, but hey I wish it all the best. Stay thirsty my friends!"
"A decent Rye Beer but it has all of the same Samuel Adams bells and whistles which just does not make it original at all ... just a few dials of flavor moved around."
"Overall, normally I can drink a bottle of Sams and be alright. This one just isn't drinkable at all. There is nothing that works with this beer. Please don't vote for this beer."
"Bottle. Courtesy of aparris85. Pours a clear rust colored mahagony color with a slightly tan head that slowly settles. Malty, bready, with some spice aroma. Not really too much hops in the nose, if any, there is a touch of fruit like hops. Medium mouthfeel. The taste is rather ho-hum. Starts of with some mild sweetness and biscuit like qualities that then transitions to a dry like finish with just a touch of hop bitterness. Yeah, I hope they don't make Sample B. Minimal lace. No real alcohol notes."
"Pours a hazy, deep amber to copper with a light tan head. In the aroma, sweet rye maltiness and light fruitiness. In the taste, dry rye and a small hint of fruit. A small bite and medium to light bodied mouthfeel, with a dry rye malt maltiness. A nice rye ale, nice body and flavor. A bigger hop presence would be perfect."
"The feel of this beer is medium bodied. It is a beer that is not too bit for an average beer drinker. It goes down well but has a strong aftertaste. This could be better balanced but is an interesting beer."
"Not my favorite Rye Ale, but my favorite choice between Sample A and B."
"This beer poured a dark amber color, with a small head that didnt stay with the beer very long. There wasnt much in the smell. It tasted simialir to any rye ale, but rather harsh, and just not as good. Full flavor, but the harshness made it hard to finsih. Overall not bad, but I voted for the other."
"D-really full of flavor. I would drink it again though if given limited choices."
" The taste is much like the boston ale with same noble hop profile and yeast flavor w/ slight elelent of toasted rye grain in the malt and light herbal hop quality. there is a mild vegetal tinge from the hops w/ light tang from the house S.A. yeast. A mild grainy note w/ a pretty good overall balance from hops/malt in the finish which is relatively clean. This was a good beer, not a great one. I enjoyed it for what it is a pretty drinkable ale. I would probably drink this if available, but not go out of my way for it, not my first choice in the challenge between it and the Belgian IPA, but it is ok for the style."
"D - Wouldn't buy it. Definitely not digging this beer. Of the two samples, the Belgian IPA is definitely better by a small margin."
"I test-drove this at Brew Fest in Des Moines over the weekend (thanks for the keychain). I picked this one because the belgian seemed a bit weak for the style and was slightly less flavorful. It did have the rye taste to it but it seemed much more likeable that other ryes I've had. The body was good with a bit of a bunch when it hit the taste buds. It went down with a bit fo a sting but was enjoyable. It was good to place this booth near the entrance so I didn't have many other beers lingering on my tongue."
"Sampled this one at Sam's Quick Shop alongside Sample A. Poured a crisp copper orange with barely any head. Aroma was sweet malts, spicy rye and a trace of hops. The taste is not much more than a standard Amber Ale with just a slight kick of rye, some caramel malts, slight rye spice and mild hops. The beer is crisp and smooth with decent carbonation. I have always been a fan of rye beers, but this one proved to be nothing special at all, it didn't come close to its Belgian IPA competition."
"Worth a try but average."
"D: The mouthfeel would portend to great drinkable, but I just wasn't really feeling the taste. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't terribly great either."
