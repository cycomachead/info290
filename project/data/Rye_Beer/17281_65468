Hops are citrusy with a bit of pine and slightly stale. Taste is a bit more fresh, not as spicy or malt forward. Much more balanced, citrusy and piney with a light hop resin. Finish is where the rye spice comes in with a light bitterness and mildly carbonated medium body.","cpetrone84","Jun 28, 2014"

Flavor is bold and dry with a solid rye kick. Mouthfeel is a little on the syrupy side, and the finish is not the most crisp. Still this beer is a great example of why Rye and IPA is a killer combination.","hreb","May 24, 2014"

3.99,7.5,3.75,4,4,4,4,"Poured into a Chuckanut pint glass. Pours a medium bronze amber with a half finger white head with good retention and lacing. Nice caramel malt with piney and citrus hops and light rye. Flavor follows aroma with a good caramel malt supporting bright citrus and piney hops. Light grapefruit and a hint of spicy rye. Good mouth feel with a medium body with pleasant creaminess, more than expected from an IPA. A tasty rye IPA with well selected hops supported by a substantial malt body and a good touch of rye, all well balanced. Enjoyable.","LiquidAmber","Feb 20, 2014"

Smell is of malt, rye, and some herbal hop aromas. Taste is of malt, rye, citrus fruit, and citrus zest. There is a mild hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is pretty tasty and drinkable.","UCLABrewN84","Aug 23, 2012"

I'm kind of surprised by some of the reviews so far of this beer given how it was judged at GABF. Granted it was not a killer/whale Rye beer, or IPA, but it was good.

4.3,15.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"I put this on tap (Hoffer's) and it lasted just a few days. The viscosity of this citrus heavy brew was like molasses. I couldn't believe how thick and syrupy this came out of the faucet. Very difficult to create any kind of head on this beer but weirdly enough, tons of lacing were left on the glass. Amazing citrus and hop overwhelms the nose on the initial gulp. Mouth feel lingers on the tongue and the roof of your mouth. Although really thick and hop heavy, this RYE IPA was incredibly easy to drink and had just the right amount of carbonation. I don't think this beer will be for those expecting a large amount of actual rye flavor. The flavor of the hops almost completely over powers it, but if you're looking for a damn good IPA with just a touch of RYE then I would highly suggest this one.","SDHoffers","Beers"
2.65,-28.6,3,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Taste, lacked hops. Its an ipa man! Couldn't really detect a rye bill to this, based on the taste, I thought it must be low. Tasted more like a brown ale with higher alcohol. To call this a rye ipa, just seemed like it was missing the most basic premise of what a rye ipa tastes like, hops and that rye spice. Neither were here.","Beerandraiderfan","0"
