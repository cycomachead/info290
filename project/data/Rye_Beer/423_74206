3.65,3.1,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.75,"i like this idea of the tasting room series, it has brought us some great beers already, and allows some of the more raw stuff they do to hit our lips, which i like, because sometimes boulevard is overly polished. this one pours somewhere between caramel and brown, with some sediment at the bottom of the bottle but other than that mostly clear. the head is tan and frothy, but shortish lived. i smells a weird tang, which the label says comes from rye, but to me its almost tannic, and the finish of the beer agrees with that, almost off, but the middle is so good. caramel malt and chocolate malt (light), and the rye, which takes on more of a dried fruit here than a spice, again the tang. yeast is english it seems, doughy and hanging around in the finish, which is off dry. well made no doubt, but definitely in need of some tweaks to be perfect. i love the grain flavor, think its awesome, but maybe the sparge temperature or something is a little too warm. those tannins arent amazing in the finish, but i like the base flavor a whole lot, and think it fits the fall season super well. underrated overall i think...","StonedTrippin","Sep 29, 2014"

The rye punch comes through in the taste primarily yet the beer, on whole, seems rather bland and watery, at least initially. The smell was pretty faint and hard to pickup on although it is there. Subsequent sips reveal a bit more depth with the malt base and rye, so it can (does) grow on you. With a 30% rye grain bill, I expected a bit more rye oomph.","beergoot","Aug 04, 2014"

I have really come to love Boulevard's Smoke Stack Series and could care less for their year round for the most part. This one certainly doesn't belong in the former (or neither, hopefully). Kinda sad that the variety pack came with three of these.","Bosoxfan20","Aug 25, 2013"

Very pedestrian as far as a unique Boulevard offering goes. Very clearly a Boulevard Pale Ale base with some rye notes and perhaps a touch more hops in the process. The rye isn't featured prominently enough in my opinion. Wouldn't be one I'd rate highly in the new test sampler pack initiative.","tito42","0"
