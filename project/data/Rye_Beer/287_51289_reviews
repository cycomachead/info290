"The breadiness of the rye is kind of low in the mix here. Nice bit of funk and barnyard, with a fairly thin body. Slight salt taste."
""
"Had on tap with about 5 month age on the Brett. Wonderful Granny Smith apple smell with hints if wine and barnyard. The Rye balances well with the beginnings of a lactic-like souring."

"Pretty nice, a very simple funky and earthy brew. The rye works really nicely with the Brett. The only sour flavor here is a bit of sweet sparkling white wine next to some apple cider. The simplicity and earthiness of this beer are what shine. Relatively inexpensive on tap, so that's a plus. If you like earthy brews, this is for you."

"As the characterful ale finishes, it moves from the medium weight of Biere de Garde early and to the mid-light body of Belgian pale ale late. Its peppery, peaty and citrus pith finish is arid with carbonic bite and piney bitterness while sweaty brine and barnyard return in waves of aftertaste. With each sip, the memory of Goose Island Matilda and Orval Trappist Ale come to mind in comparison."
"Brett funk, bubblegum in aroma, with a lightly tart, vinous flavor, underlying woody notes, and a slightly barnyard finish. The rye is fairly subtle initially, but lingers in the finish."

"Overall glad I tried it, but not the best of the fest. (ABR)"

"Overall: definitely a delicious and underrrated beer. A great showcase of what brett can do, and the rye adds a nice complexity."

"O - From the nose, I was hoping this would be a great beer but the flavor and astringency lead to this being only solid. It is nice to see Bell's experimenting with Brett."

"I love the pun on this—it’s a play on the Kal-Haven Trail that runs across southwest Michigan. The beer is a light tan amber with light foam. I get a earthy funk from the aroma. It’s light but present, like a light onion sliced in the adjoining room… which is the only way I could think of describing it. Nice malt body with a delicate brett note that emerges as it warms. Not bad, but I’d like to see what could happen with some more time on this one. It shows promise and plenty of potential."
"Overall: a bells tap only that is easy to miss but great if you find it. Great balance between tropical, juicy fruit and earthy funky yeast. Certainly one of the more interesting beers I have had"

"Certainly a different and creative beer, here. Not quite a sour, not quite a rye beer... what the hell is it? Who knows and who cares, as long as it tastes good, right? Well, it's pretty good. The tartness gets weaker as the beer goes on and the funky rye flavors get more powerful. Still not sure if I like that or not. I'd like to try this beer again a few months from now. Probably wont be able to find it, though."

"Pours a mix of light bronze and hazy amber with bits of dark yellow. The head was an inch of loose off white suds that look die off into nothing. Small spots of lace. Smells like a lot of great bretted up homebrew I've had. Brett and some funk and a lot of barnyard IMO. Some rye is under all the wild. Some caramel and grain. The taste is pretty marvelous. Bretty up front with hay and grass and other earth, barnyard. Not overly funky, kinda tart. I like the low level of rye in this. Some rye bread and grain towards the end. Feel is below medium with a nice carb punch from the tap. Crisp and evervesant, easy going down, if brett's your thing. It's mine so this is insanely drinkable. Good job."
"Pours a dusty copper color with orange highlights, decent cap of off-white head and good lacing. Scent is mellow - funk, earth, clay with dry, spicey grain. Taste is a little more aggressive, spicy rye with a mild funkyness to it. Medium bodied, active carbonation, dry and lingering. A decent beer which combines ingredients from different styles nicely."
"Chewy medium body that is slightly spicy with lots of sweet caramel malt and rye along with a slightly puckering dry bretty efervescence. The tart Brett presence is mos prominent up frogt and slowly fades throught the palate as the malts and rye counter it. Very well balanced and quaffable with a sweet dry finish."
"D= I liked this beer a lot and between the two Bell's sour beers I have had (this and Wild One) I think I prefer this one. The rye gives it a very nice balance and makes it interesting AND easy to drink."
"Very good beer. Love to see this one again. And to repeat, Bell's start spreading these wilds around, you seem to have a knack for it."
"I was hoping to retaste it the next day but it was not poured at the beer fest (to my knowledge). It was enjoyable sharing my appreciation of this Rye with the owner and his brewers."
"D: My first visit to Bell's, so I was hesitant to get more than one glass at a time. That being said, this one is interesting, especially whem the rye makes itself known."
