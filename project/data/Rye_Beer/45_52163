4.3,9.7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This beer was totally not what I expected when it was described as a rye beer, but after ordering it and thinking about the name, it made much more sense. It was in reality a beer cocktail, where rye beer was was used as a base instead of whiskey and the spices and cherry were brewed into the beer and not added afterwards. This was great and I would definitely order it again.","Soonami","0"
3.68,-6.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Reviewed on 10/10/2009. Growler from Big Z Beverage. Pours brown with a small white head. Aroma of cherry syrup and light spices. Flavor is also cherry with some spicy rye in the finish. Not your typical s/h/v but it's a pretty decent, tasty beer. Not sure where the cherry comes from, but it's the strongest flavor/aroma in this beer.","LilBeerDoctor","Dec 04, 2009"
3.78,-3.6,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"At the Gaslight Brewery, S.Orange, NJ: poured a deep brownish amber into an American pint glass, with a thick finger of off-white head that laced fairly well. The smell was an interesting mix of caramel, malt, cherry, nutmeg, and cinnamon. The tasted revealed everything from the nose, but with a strikingly balanced cherry/malt balance throughout. Also, a thinner body than expected, given the thick color, but it worked with the cherry essence. Overall a refreshing brew, but I don't think that I can sit and drink cherry-flavored beer all night.","donniecuffs","Dec 02, 2009"

Lots of sweet rye malt and estery dark fruit notes, especially raisin, plum, date, fig and grape. Slightly vinous with spicy cinnamon, clove, brown sugar, ginger, vanilla and nutmeg. The pumpkin notes from the aroma are missing. Slightly syrupy and medicinal, being a bit too sweet with a subtle dry finish. Pretty drinkable.","corby112","Nov 24, 2009"

Malty, fruity nose that reminds me vermouth. Somehow the taste balances the bitterness of the hops with something reminiscent of aromatic bitters. The rye barrel definitely adds a nice note.

4.12,5.1,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"the beer pours a reddish brown color with a nearly white head that recedes quickly to a thin ring around the edge of the glass. the aroma does bring to mind a manhattan with the sweet malt smell and a bit of fruit at the back. the malt character is great in the taste, backed nicely by the bourbon aging. the fruit in the taste isn't as noticable but still nice, with the full body and the low carbonation it makes for a nice full beer.","almychristopher","Nov 20, 2009"
4.12,5.1,4,4.5,4,4,4,"The beer pours a dark amber/red color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a really nice crystal malt and rye scent along with some spices that I can't figure out what they are. I'm not a Manhattan drinker so I'm not familiar with the aroma. The taste is good. It has a smooth crystal malt and rye flavor. It's spicey with a touch of bourban and spice. It's a unique flavor. I'm not in love with it, but it's quite drinkable and full of complexity. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn tastey beer.

4.64,18.4,4,5,5,4,4,"Wow... pours a nice rich brown color with ruby highlights. Minimal head on this one. Smell is a crazy combination of carrot cake (bready, brown sugar, sweet cream, vanilla, nutty, slight spicing) and banana... booze comes through as it warms. Taste is banana forward with the carrot cake thing going on in the background again (bready, brown sugar, sweet vanilla, nuts, slight spicing). The background give hints of wood, dark cherry. Slightly boozy, and after Garrett Oliver mentioned it, i did notice there is a true Manhattan cocktail like charachter to it. Full bodied without being syrupy or sticky.

Although I admire the creativity behind the Manhattan Project, I fear that what makes most of Brooklyn's offerings great (simplicity) got lost in this one. Not sure if the ""Rye Beer"" classification fits, either, as Manhattan Project struck me more as a Herbed/Spiced Beer (with rye added).

3.97,1.3,3.5,4,4,4,4,"On-tap at the Bookstore Speakeasy in Bethlehem, PA for $7. Served in a tall goblet, the beer appears orange with a soft white head. Most rye beers get a generous helping of hops, but this beer focuses on the rye malt and spices. My first thoughts were that it tasted like a sweet rye cake, in part thanks to the light cinnamon and dessert spices added. I didn't detect the barrel aging, but still found this to be a tasty and smooth strong ale.","tempest","Beers"
3.73,-4.8,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Manhattan has a rusty brown look with some slight red highlights up towards the light. A nice tan head that dwindled down and leaves loose lace on the glass. The smell brings up rye along with some spices, nutmeg and vanilla. I also got some light pumpkin like flavors making me wonder if I got the right beer. The taste brings more malt than the nose leads, caramel sweetness. The rye is there but not 'There'. A nice spice backing with a slight hop bite. Fruits such as cherry in the mix. I think there is a bit to much going on here. The feel is medium with ample carb but this project leaves a funny taste in my mouth afterwards. A little spiciness in the middle with just a bit of alcohol, minimal. Im glad I tried this project, not my favorite rye beer as I think it's trying to be a bit more. A great idea from Brooklyn, this is kind of different.","BARFLYB","0"

3.37,-14,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"I really don't think this beer was much of a success. I liked the concept but it just didn't work very well. It was overly sweet - much too sweet - with the cherry flavor dominating and reminding me of maraschino. The bourbon quality was stronger in the nose than the taste, and it's not often I say this because I think bourbon is more often than not overdone, but this really could have used more bourbon character. It also really needed some balance in the form of spice or bitterness - which is why the lack of rye spiciness was so sorely missed. Maybe they should have used a noble hop to complement and bring out the rye spice. Regardless, it didn't come through and it really needed to. More bourbon or more rye character (ANY rye character) would have helped cut the sweetness and balance this out a bit. Maybe with some tweaking they can make this one work, but as of right now I wouldn't go back for more. Has potential, but not a great beer right now.","number1bum","Oct 26, 2009"
4.37,11.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Presented in a snifter, holds a decent tan head that slowly fades to thick and sticky lacing. Smells initially very spicy, with herbal undercurrents and touches of whiskey. Tastes very much like the Manhattan it was modeled after, the rye is prominent but not overpowering, some caramel and toffee malt flavors, tart red fruit, and an even bitterness from the gentian root. Very full mouthfeel with a slick texture. Comes off well balanced, maybe just slightly heavy, but that's not really a bad thing, is it?","Hefe","Oct 26, 2009"
4.78,21.9,5,4.5,5,4,5,"Served in a tulip glass at Leon's. Genuinely one of the finest beers I've ever tasted. Note that I am indeed a big fan of the Manhattan (the rye/sweet vermouth/bitters concoction), and that I had this beer after enjoying Leon's version of the Manhattan. But I can't imagine a richer, malty approximation of the Manhattan, and even though this is a rye beer, it stands up to the taste of the great sweet stouts (i.e., Flying Dog Gonzo Imperial Porter). Not sure how they pulled it off, but this one is fine, fine, fine. Too bad I can't take some home. Keg only.","chuckreece","Oct 22, 2009"

No bourbon smell detected. Taste was much less pronounced than I expected. No real bourbon, rye, or cherry flavor. Reminded me more of a bland winter warmer beer.

3.93,0.3,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Was glad to happen upon this beer at Leon's after a Belgian dinner at the Brick Store. What a nice desert! Served in a Brooklyn stemmed glass, the beer has a deep brown hue, with a slight ruby hint around the edges where light brightens the beer. A white one finger head rests atop, and thankfully stuck around for a while, as this beer turned out to be a sipper. Aroma is a mix of alcohol, rye, and a hint of cherry, but not very potent in any of these characteristics. Drinking this beer, I had mixed feelings. On one side, I have to give it credit for accomplishing the essence of a Manhattan in beer form (I am not much of liquor drinker, but this happens to be the one drink I order). The botanicals and rye whiskey barrel aging have given the beer the necessary hints that vermouth adds the mixed drink. The rye itself is not as strong as I had anticipated, and is a bit overtaken by the alcohol and cherry flavor. This is the other side, I felt the cherry presence was just too intense, it added a syrupy sweetness that was a bit much for me. In the end, an amazing blend of flavors, but maybe a bit much of the one. Despite the ABV, and mix of contents, the beer itself is rather thin and light in mouthfeel, however, the intense flavors, and maybe its youthful boozy character make it a sipper for sure. I enjoyed this as a night cap, just like the drink, and would suggest others do the same with this beer's big, complex flavor.","bhalter8","Oct 18, 2009"

3.58,-8.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"D- I'll start off by saying I love the experimentation with themes. I may have been my own worst enemy in as much that I was reallly looking forward to the rye/rye combo inspired by some fancy mixologist guy... I get more of a maraschino cherry flavor than anyting else....It is it supposed to be Manhattan project as in like the drink Manhattan, right? I just wish it had some rye beer flavor, I didn't get any of that- bummer. Cool idea though and a cool beer.","m1ked","Sep 16, 2009"
