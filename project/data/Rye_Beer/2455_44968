3.73,-2.1,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Poured from a bomber into a shaker pint, the beer is a slightly hazed, amber-highlighted copper coloring with a frothy, foamy, off-white head and a ton of carbonation action throughout the body. Aromas of hops first and foremost, with a resinous blast, moss and pine, and some subtle tropical fruit, all on a roasted and slightly bitter, grain backbone. Flavors are more of the bitter and pungent rye forward, with a bitterness around the edges from the hops, resinous notes, and citrus highlights. Smooth, light bodied, with a crisp endfeel. The aftertaste has a bit more of the citrus notes coming to the palate, with the bitter grains still providing a solid foundation. The finish has a grainy and citrus linger. Not bad overall, very balanced, and the light body keeps it refreshing.","GarthDanielson","Mar 13, 2014"

Aroma is heavy on the spice, with a dash of dish soap smell, sweet caramel and toffee, and a tinge of pine. Flavor very much highlights the rye, spicey black pepper, some pine bite, bit of dark dry fruit with serious dry finish. Has some qualities of a dubbel but without much sweetness. Light to medium mouthfeel that finishes dry. Very true to the rye here, and does not go all IPA on you like a lot of ""rye"" pales do. I respect that.","BMMillsy","Sep 29, 2013"

The smell is herbal, floral, and malty, and pleasing to the nose. The taste is malt-forward - nutty and bready - with rye also playing a big role, adding spiciness and a tingle on the tongue. Hop flavors are in the background, and are mainly floral. I think it would benefit from more citrus hop flavors to provide better balance.

The flavors are particularly grassy and somewhat cooked, which makes me wonder about the condition of the bottle (mind you, it was in the cooler of a very, very popular beer store).

4.15,8.9,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a deep amber color, moving a bit to brown, slightly hazy with a huge head, kind of off-white/yellow colored. It looks a little loosely packed, but it stays around, leaving nice lacing. Though eventually, it sort of collapses to a pillowy mass and then sort of disappears slowly. The smell comes across with mostly powdery malts, and quite a bit of rye. Like rye bread, a little spicy, a little earthy. There also seems to be some spiciness and leafy-earthiness from the hops as well. Otherwise, their presence is mild in the smell. Something smells a little like cinnamon in here as well, a little spicier though. The taste comes across with a kick of herbs, like herb bread, with cloves, and a bit of mint, some basil, maybe a taste of garlic, actually there seems to be a little heat to it. Very interesting. Then there's a kind of toasty malt presence, with a bit of sweetness, liek caramellized sugars. I can also sense a bit of an estery presence, but it's barely there. There's quite a bit going on here - I'm not so sure I have anything to compare it to, but I'm really enjoying it. The body is nice and full, almost chewy from the proteins in the rye. Makes it almost hard to swallow. The alcohol warms a little, but isn't really noticeable. The carbonation hardly bites, but you can feel it there, helping to rush the beer down. Really enjoyable. It's a bit out of the ordinary - not because of some strange ingredient, but just because I haven't really tasted anything quite like it, and worth a shot if you can get it. I could see myself purchasing this again.","taylorhamrick","Jun 16, 2009"

The body was a deep shade of copper and clear, and the head atop was foamy. I did not see any carbonation streamers. The smell was sweet and fruity, which is odd for a beer named Rye Hopper. The taste was also sweet and mildly bitter. The bready taste was followed by a bit of spiciness. The body was soft, but this beer lacked the carbonation to make it feel creamy.

4.17,9.4,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Another solid beer from French Broad. So nice to see these available in Atlanta now. Pours a slightly hazy dark amber with very little head and relatively low carbonation, but with some scant lacing left behind as the beer is drained. Smells of spicy rye, piney hops, and a touch of malt. Fairly well balanced in the nose. I wouldn't call the taste balanced, but it's delicious nonetheless. Starts with a bang, with a big blast of rye and piney hops intermingled to create a quite spicy, dry, bitter, prickly mouthfull. I like it, and the rye and the hops work well together. Bone dry with very little noticeable malt makes this almost tannic, and approaches rye whiskey in its flavor profile, without the burn. Big and spicy in the mouth, this one surprised me when I poured it after working in the yard expecting a lawnmower beer. That it is not. My only real complaint is that it's a bit one-dimensional, but this is one of the better beers out there for showcasing the beauty of rye, so I'll forgive it its singlemindedness. Nice, I'll be buying this again.","Georgiabeer","Beers"

Smell is nice but not what I had expected from a beer with Hopper in the name. Bigger on the malts than anything. Some caramel, chocolate, and a distinct nutty scent. Very light to no hops present, though still very enticing. Taste is much of the same. Reminds me of the malt profile of many Catawba Valley brews. A definite malt presence. Oh so yummy chocolate and caramel malt. A good nutty flavor to compliment. A hoppy flavor shows up toward the finish but could have done wonders if used a bit more liberally. Of course, there is a light spicy flavor, though like the hops not as present as I had imagined. Still, very nice and interesting to say the least. Mouthfeel lacked the bitterness that again I had expected from the name alone. Smooth, good carbonation, though lacking a certain bitterness from the ""hopper"" in the name.
