"taster at Uncle Buck's in Grapevine, TX."

"On draft at Flips burger in Grapevine.  Fairly decent beer."
"All bitter dull hops on the taste.  More dank sock taste than good dank ipa taste."
"Grapevine CB makes some really good beers, but the Lakefire Rye is mainly all I see at the stores in North Texas."
"Bought this hoping for something similar to the Summit rye. The majority of the six pack I purchased has been sitting in my fridge taking up space since I bought it. I will never buy it again, even if it's the only ""craft"" on tap at a hole-in-the-wall.  I can honestly say that I find run-of-the-mill Bud light or Coors more drinkable, and that's saying something."
"Regretting the 6-pac I purchased."

"I tried this along with Stone IPA and Widmer Upheaval IPA, and it had a better body and hop character than the Stone surprisingly. More floral than citrusy, and a nice smooth finish."

"Looks, smells, and tastes like a muddier version of Shiner Ryes and Shine. Some sort of light rye amber, perhaps. Nothing too offensive stands out, but it's the worst microbrew rye beer I think I've ever had. At ~$9/six pack, this is defintely one to avoid. Now I just need to figure out how to get rid of the other 5."

"O: not my favorite PA but as at as flagship beers go this wasn't too bad. Worth a beer or raster but personally wouldn't have 6"
