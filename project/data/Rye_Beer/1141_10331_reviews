"This beer deserves a better rating then an  83. If you warm it up a little, you get a variety of tastes.  A malt profile that has a scotch ale thing, only. with rye. There's a nice caramel taste that fuses with a mild hop bitterness and a peppery rye taste. The pepper corns add a lot of heat that coats the roof of you mouth. For me, this is a delightful treat!"

"Pretty interesting beer. The malt profile seems a bit lackluster but it gets better in complexity if you let it warm up quite a bit. This is the perfect beer for food pairing with steak, grilled meats, etc. I will probably buy it again but it will most likely be to pair with a meal rather than drinking as a standalone beer. While its not my favorite style of all time, this beer works well for what it is. Worth a try. I recommand it."
"not really my style of choice, tough to drink. The pepper and spice are very, very prominent."

"I'm a fan of spicy beer, and this a solid one. Albeit, it can be overpowering if you don't like the taste of pepper. The peppercorns are right upfront front: smell and taste. Add to that some caramel and some distant chocolate, strong malt flavor. Did not detect the rye or fruit as the label implies."

"Not a bad beer at all and certainly a lot better than I was expecting given the aroma of the beer, it definitely wasn't a classic but I did enjoy the spiciness to it and its fairly unique flavours. While it's not a beer I'm likely to pick up again it is one it was a decent beer and a very spicy one at that."

"Earthy spice, pepper, rye sweetness. Very interresting and fun beer. Different than any other rye. A must have in my opinion."
""

"Ruby, good lacing. Quite a strong rye component and a spicy beer, good balance, light hops but a rich earthy peppery character, good drinkability and balance. Not something I would have regularly but this was enjoyable."

"A very good beer from an amazing brewery."

"Food match: The gingerness of this brew made me think of dishes with ginger such as the Burmese ""Gyin Thot"" and the Thai ""Gai Pad King""... now I have ginger on the brain."

"It’s been nearly 5 years since I’ve had this beer and there have been changes in either the beer, my palate, or both. This was fondly remembered as a very tasty treat from the exotic land of Quebec. Now I find this to be an OK beer, lacking nose and appearance, but still being spicy. Now it seems meh."

"Poured from the bottle into a tulip glass. A reddish coppery bronze color with a moderate amount of beige head. Smells quite sweet but with an equal measure of earthy spice: Toffee, musty seed spice, rye bread, earthy hops ... One can tell right away that there is a rich maltiness, almost like a scotch ale, couple with some savory spice and herb flavors. Indeed, the initial taste is like raisin rye bread sprinkled with black pepper. A dry, almost salty leather note emerges over time, along with sour apple, caramel candies, and tobacco. The heat from the black pepper builds over time, with the rather dry finish evoking peppered crackers and providing an interesting contrast to the sweet beginning and middle sections. Moderate body like many red ales and pretty smooth. I am hard to pressed to complain about anything here. There's a rummy sweetness, a woody peppercorn bite, and some tangy fruit elements that all cleave together nicely. Great example of the skilled use of spices in brewing, even if you can indeed taste the pepper as such."
""
"Felt like a Brown Ale made with rye with a pepper time bomb. Quite interesting beer, it should perfectly match with cold cuts or steak. Stay away if you don’t like spices."
""
"This is a very enjoyable beer, one that certainly deserves revisiting with food (esp. charcuterie). It is drinkable, well-crafted, and balanced well enough that the peppercorns don't overwhelm or the malt doesn't muddle the clean spice flavor. Really like this one...and I would say that it was worth the high price tag to try it."
"O: Just a great beer overall. I would definitely drink this again and would consider buying some more. Some BBQ'd chicken would be great with this."
""
""
""
"A few seconds later the tongue tingles with the bite of freshly ground black pepper. And the bite leaves a tingle for a good while on the tongue. In this sense, it's a very interesting flavor, giving it a slight bump from being a solid mid-level beer."
"It's alright but not exceptional if you ask me. I would drink it again if it was offered but I doubt I would order it."
""
""
""
""
"Low orangey wispy head despite a vigorous pour. Opaque orangey red colored. Rich aroma of ripe fruit and dark bread. Flavor of ripe apricot and plum, bready malt, semi-sweet, no hop flavors. A peppery bite slowly builds, subtle but noticeable, just the right amount. Starts in the back of the throat, slowly moves up to the back of the tongue and rolls down to the tip, keeping the mouth warm despite the low ABV. Low carbonation, semi slick, but the heat adds to the mouthfeel. Interesting beer, worth a try, but not a quaffer."

"The pepper does build up with time making this a spicy sipper, but I like it, i didn't find it as overbearing as many reviewers found (perhaps they've toned it down in later batches?). The beer underneath it all does a fine job too."
""
""
"Overall: A decent brew. The peppercorns really take over and kick the palates ass. Takes over the brew too much to be a really truly great brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very flavorful rye beer and I'd try this again."
""
""
""
"Overall exceptional...love it. would go superb with food pairing. Memorable."
""
"The smell and taste don't match, odd but not a bad thing. It's certainly an interesting beer, more for matching with food than drinking alone."
""
"Overall, I think this is a fairly enjoyable beer, but the amount of pepper in it forces it to feel like a bit of a gimmick. Not something I can imagine anybody drinking a lot of, not having very often. That being said, I rather like it."

"Overall, I am a huge fan of rye beers and this one didn't disappoint. I do plan on trying this again. From it's darker nutty notes from the darker grains used when brewing to it's spicy rye, it is an interesting beer to at least try."
"O- I enjoy pepper in general and peppery-spiced beers ( like rye porters), this beer is simply too peppery strong for my tastes, thus keeping the feel and taste ratings in check."
"This beer starts out very smooth, easy drinking, satisfying. As it warms, it gets more complex, the peppercorns start to shine through, and it really gets interesting. For a 5.00% beer, this is way more than a session beer with mild abv. It's a really interesting and flavorful beer. I thoroughly enjoyed this and will have again and again. If you like rye beers, peppery wines, or just complex ales in general, give this a try."
""
""
"O: Good drinkability. Great Spicy beer. Unique experience"
""
""
"Overall: This is going to be a love or hate beer for most people. The only things spicier than this are going to be beers with actual chilies in there. Overall, it's a good rye beer, but you'll only enjoy it if you like, or at least appreciate the overwhelming pepper character it has."

"Overall tasty and enjoyable beer - I have yet to be disappointed by any of this brewers offerings - they are always original and unique in style."

"never had one quite like this. like a swig of rye pale ale with a fat bite of steak au poivre. brewed with green and black peppercorns, this is one interesting sip. pours dense and milky brown in color, slight amber hue to it, definitely full bodied, with a fluffy just off white head. the nose is really bitey from the peppercorns, which increases even more as it warms. there is also a full dose of rye malt in here, which only adds to the spicy nose. flavor is great and unique. its peppery as hell, almost hot in the finish, but its highly refined as well, carefully dosed, and I think they walked the line here without crossing it. I could have drank another bottle of this without issue. the rye has a ton of body and exacerbates the pepper intensity, I love the combination. never had one like this before at all, not aware of another out there really. creamy feel in texture but with quite bold carbonation. this is a beer you can keep on tasting for awhile after you swallow, the pepper just keeps coming. I can think of about a million food combinations id like to serve this beer with. highly recommended!"
""

"Pepper! Very nice pepper taste. A bit of pepper in the aroma but Really hits you at the end of the palate. Really nice copper color. Fairly dry. Descent mouthfeel. Nice different beer. Pepper is not over powering, definately taste it but complements beer nicely."
""
""
"Overall, this is a pretty interesting beer. I would drink it again, but I wish it had more powerful carbonation. I think that would play nicely with the peppercorns."
""
""
""
"Overall- Kind of a strange beer. Bought it on a whim. It's good, but I would not seek it out anytime soon."

"Served from tap into a Trappe Door tulip. Poured a deep ruby red-orange with a three finger very light tan head that subsided to one finger slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, bread, earth, pepper, and orange peel. The flavor was of sweet malt, bread, earth, earth hop, and orange peel. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. I really wish this brew had quite a bit more complexity to it. There were some good notes going on here with the orange peel, but it just wasn’t enough to make it stand out in the style. If it just had a little more going on it could have been a pretty good brew. Definitely worth your time trying at least once to judge for yourself though, but not super high on my list of must tries."

"Decanted into my City Tap House ""Sour Saturday"" mini-stem glass, a hazy, chestnut brown color with a small off-white head that receded to a wispy layer of bubbles; spots of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is somewhat distant, caramel malt and rye ""spice," toasted bread and light peppery spice. Pale biscuity malt taste, toasted grains, a little bland and not too sweet, stiff peppercorn character, and a bitter herbal hop finish. Medium body, moderate carbonation, drying. Not bad overall, but nothing great or memorable. It was free, so, giddyup."
""
""
"O: Love this beer. I like rye beers, and I love peppercorn beers! This is right up my alley. Really good. I will be buying much more of this in the future."
""
"o - really interesting take on a rye beer. much more spicy than others i have had."
""
"330 ml bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours hazy red orange color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some decent spotty lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of caramel, toast, biscuit, rye, toffee, pepper, herbal, chocolate, and light plums. Very nice aromas with good balance, complexity, and strength. Taste of caramel, chocolate, pepper, rye, biscuit, toast, herbal, toffee, and light raisin. Lingering notes of pepper, rye, chocolate, caramel, toffee, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of flavors and complexity; with no cloying sweetness at all. Pepper heat flavors seem to build up in intensity as you drink. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and lightly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish as expected. Overall this is a damn nice spiced rye beer. Nice balance of malty flavors with pepper; and quite smooth to drink. The pepper heat flavors build up on the palate, so I don’t see myself having more than one at a time. Very enjoyable though."

"I think this beer would pair exceptionally well with the right meal (maybe a montreal style brisket?), although I'm not sure I'll ever try it again."
"overall??? blecchh. leave the spice to the food. dont pour it into your beer. it's not even a good novelty brew."
""
""
""
"overall its a quality red ale with that pepper punch, really good."
"Route des Épices - The bottle says: ""Route des Épices (French for ""Spice Route"") is a rye beer brewed with black and green peppercorns. Initially the beer reveals flavors of fresh grain and malt, which, give it notes of chocolate, caramel, and fruit. The pepper flavor and arose is fully revealed in the finish, which leaves a pleasant spice, tingling sensation on the tongue."""
"Review from 2/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a clear orange amber, slight head and lacing. Aroma of sweet malt and pepper. Sweet malt changing to dry, spicy, earthy rye and light fruit. Definite pepper aftertaste is interesting, but overall flavor is somewhat muted. Light to medium bodied with some creaminess. Interesting to try, but fairly light flavored for the complexity."
""
"Overall, this brew is not bad, but quite average by Dieu Du Ciel standards. And the rather acrid tomatoey taste can be rather off-putting."
""
""
"This is an enjoyable, complex, smooth offering with great drinkability. I'll definitely have this again."
""
""
""

""
""
"O: This beer is probably only going to find a niche of enjoyment and popularity - this is a flavor profile that I enjoy and really makes me think of steak au poivre. I enjoyed this beer but it is a little spicy to be an easier drinker. Very unique."
""
""
""
"The harmony of peppercorn and rye is remarkable as each play out in an intertwined taste and texture that's as rustic as it is playful. Yet the balance is spicy and raw to the point where it becomes a bit challenging to the palate- yet curiosity resumes..."
""
"O: I couldn't finish this one, the spiciness was just too much for me. I can appreciate it for what it is, and I can enjoy the aftertaste when drank in slow sips, but this one isn't for me."
""
""
"I tried this beer on May 18, 2012 at ""C'est What"" in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The beer poured a dark brown into the tulip glass with very little head. The aroma was sweet malt, grains, and molasses, with some floral hops. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with medium carbonation. the flavour was grains, pepper, molasses, and some berryish notes, followed by a bitter finish. the pepper notes, while non-existent in the aroma were very pronounced in the flavour."
"O: An interesting beer, although not nearly as big as a hit as the hibiscus beer they brew. This isn't' something I would get normally but it's definitely worth a try."
""
""
"A bit one dimensional...peppercorns pretty much steal the show from any other flavor. Worth a try if you're looking for something different, otherwise pass. Thanks for the bday want fdkayti!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"4.0 D: The drinkability for this becomes greater as you drink it. The reasoning is that the peppery heat builds up after every sip. By the end, I had a nice warming going on in my mouth and I loved it. Would drink again."
"Drinkability: It's a smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas but not quite what I expected."
""
"Overall-At 5.49/bottle kind of pricey. Think if I have again I'll try to pair with a peppered steak or other spicy dish (Thai or Mexican). Do recommend and will buy again."
""
"The medium body and moderate carbonation give this beer a drinkable, but not quite refreshing quality. The body is like that of an American Brown Ale, which really lets the malt flavors come out. The carbonation is somewhat fizzy and foams up only slightly in the swallow."
""
"O: I'm very impressed by this beer and a bit dumbfounded by the low scores. Yes, peppercorns are strong so maybe the beer is a bit polarizing. However, I find it complex and full bodied, yet easy to drink. I really love how the rye and peppercorn flavors work together - so tasty. Highly recommended."
"I don't mind peppercorn in my beer but this might be just a bit over the top. Expect it to taste like pepper straight from the mill with some caramel. I am almost deceived into thinking I just ate a pepper-crusted steak or something. Intense."
"Overall - This beer takes your tastebuds down an interesting path. I was surprised by the sweet start that turned into a peppery finish. Hats off to Dieu du Ciel for creating such a unique beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This brew is such an experience! It is very unusual and I love it! You certainly need to like hot meals to appreciate its taste, but if you do just seek it out!"
""
""
""
""
"I didn't know this beer had pepper in it before it was served to me, it was served blind, but I called it from a goddamn mile away. The pepper wins in the palate and the nose. Rye? For reals? I couldn't tell. This beer was a pretty big let down, very peppery, and that's all. Nope, not again."
""
""
""
"O: This beer is about the pepper, but I love it!"
"O: Interesting, complex, and delicious. I love the pepper additions to this beer. At 5% ABV, this is a very drinkable beer and quite enjoyable."
"O: Kind of meh for me. I'd be interested to try the base beer without the peppercorn added. At almost $5/bottle I'll probably never have this again."
" The taste is not as inviting as the aroma led on, but still has some of that cedar-like sweet woodiness with a goodly amount of malt which comes off more creamy than caramel with a light toasted and dry accent that doesn't really reach any kind of roast level yet does seem to amplify the pepper flavors in the beer. The alcohol is more noticeable because of the spice I suppose but not really sharp or out of place there is a mild heat that builds in the back of the throat which lets you know what you are dealing with. The peaty tinge is a good woody compliment to the subtle rye. Overall I like the way this beer unfolds it is very aromatic even when cold and as it warms tends to come together quite well with the malt and spice in harmony. I recommend trying this if a peppery beer is your cup of tea."
""
""
""
"Overall: While some may complain about the pepper, it comes as billed. I see no difference in the intensity of its ingredient when compared to the intensity of the hops in many IPAs. Unique and well made."

"This is one interesting beer. Well worth a try if you are in the mood for something different."
"A well balanced, good spiced beer, the rye and pepper goes well together."
"O-now THIS is how a rye beer should be. I've had so many different rye beers, but this is finally one I can distinguish from an IPA. The only other rye beer I've had that compares is The Bruery Rogbrod. for being as complex and balanced as it was, the tastes and flavors all held up extremely well throughout the experience. it seemed to get spicier and spicier as well. i really enjoyed this one, and I felt lucky to try it. maybe not something i'll be wanting again and again though."
"Overall: Pretty nice little beer it had some things about it that I didn't like but I really enjoyed the flavor of the beer and I would recommended this"
"Overall – very interesting in taste, and seemingly quite original. I’ve certainly never tasted anything quite like it."
"This is a great combination and use of rye with pepper. This is a hot beer but tolerable without an alcohol burn. I really like this it is soa far thefor best example of pepper dominance in a beer that I really enjoyed."
"Interesting to have pepper in a beer, but kinda just one note. Cool idea though. Do like the heat on the back end, but thats about all this beer has."
"O: The only thing that comes to mind when I'm concluding this review; COOL! This beer is one of the coolest beer experiences I've ever had. The heat from the pepper really knocked me off my feet..."
"D - Very drinkable. The peppercorn is a great addition that really works well in this beer. The spices are quite bold, but I really like that."
"Overall I like it because it's different and the peppercorn flavor and character is really nice. I recommend giving this a try with an open mind especially if you dig peppercorns."
"I wasn't sure what to expect from this beer and I got a surprise both for good and bad. For one thing, this beer is much closer to a lager in taste and character than I expected. The core of this beer is laggerish and the rye is more around the edges than I expected. At the same time, I'm really impressed by how spicy and bold in flavor the peppercorns came through. I love the back-of-the-throat spicy hit fromt he peppercorns. That alone floats this ale as really unqiue and enjoyable."
"T: Caramel malt and a slight rye flavor followed by a lot of peppercorn heat. The heat grew after the finish and was really unexpected. I can honestly say I've never had another beer like this."
"This beer poured out with a copperish brown color, the head was pretty decent looking, didn't lace the glass too much but did hang out on top of the beer for a while. The smell of this beer was a little earthy to me, some malts and sweet dark fruits on the nose. The taste is ok at first, it's got some subtle elements of malts and hops, some butterscotch in there too. What really sets off the flavor is of course the peppercorns, The tingling heat in the aftertaste was really cool. I enjoy these kinds of beer so much and they're very rare. The mouthfeel had a good thickness to it and a little bit of carbonation. Overall this brew was nice, I really enjoy the heat in this ones aftertaste."
"Poured a 1.5"" beige head which quickly dissipated. Held to the light it's a hazy auburn brown color, attractive. Cold it had pretty much no smell, and I was surprised after it warmed I still really wasn't getting any. Nice rich complex flavor. The peppercorns come through as a general exotic spiciness. There's also some caramel. But frankly I usually expect a rye to be more interesting. This is decent but not great."
"Poured from a 11.5 oz bottle, marked 2/9, into my Chimay goblet. Light cola colored. 1/2 finger of white head, dies quickly. A little bit of lacing. Film retains on top. Smells very caramely. Spices galore. A bit like a savory root beer. Meaty. Could be faded hops, or might be how it was intended to smell. Can't really figure out how old it is, so definitely a possibility that it's old hops. On the mouth, dry up front, a caramel flavor without being sweet. Spicy as hell, especially after being about 3/4 done. A decent hop bitterness. The burn in the back of my throat reminds me of fresh ginger. Thin mouthfeel, but smooth. Good, unique beer. Not necessarily something I need to have again though."
"D: The mouthfeel makes this one pretty easy to drink, but I think this one is best served with food to balance the black pepper notes."
"Overall: The nose and the mouthfeel keep this beer from totally bombing. It didn't taste all that great to me, but it kept me interested. I wish this beer tasted as good as it smells. More malts would do a world of good for this beer. Needs better balance because the peppercorns are pretty hardcore. Tame the peppercorns and bring some malt complexity or some hops. Worth a try anyways for a unique beer."
"11.5oz bottle: This one pours a very hazy, very dark amber color. There was almost no off-white head on it, and it left no lacing. Interesting aroma. Pepper, rye, and some caramel malt. The pepper is prominent, but not overpowering. A interesting taste. Rye, subdued peppery spices, malt, perhaps some hidden fruits. Interesting, but I don't think I'll be having another."
"Dark amber colour, one finger of very white head, decent lace left behind on the glass. A little thin in the nose, rye for the most part, spice and malt, slight sweetness as well deep down. Taste is spicy and malty, fairly refreshing and earthy, spice takes over with a peppery spicy note that is prickly all over the tongue. Medium body, medium carb but the prickly spice makes is feel more effervescent, good weight. Drinks quite nicely and exceeded my expectations, great beer with corned beef or deli meats, would revisit this for sure."
"O: Enjoyable enough. Not something I would probably purchase again, but I liked it enough."
"DRINK (3/5) This is pretty poor, despite the great flavors. The pepper, though really tasty, has a tendency to build to become pretty spicy. The real problem, however, was that I felt that entirely too much in my belly."
"Pours a clear but dark copper color, cap of off-white head, some small spots of retention. Scent is quite pleasent... spice from rye and pepercorns, carmel backbone with hints of vanilla and grahmn cracker, a few other spices linger in the rear that invoke cinamon and corriander... like an amped up winter warmer. Taste brings a dry rye spicyness before a huge hit of peppercorns, the pepper almost dominates only allowing touches of carmel, vanilla, brown sugar to peek through - still a good beer to his point. Falls apart as finish allows the peppercorns to burn the tongue and throat, a feeling which lingers quite long. Medium bodied, smooth on the palate until the pepper just demolishes the palate. Pepper overkill - flavors of pepper take over and do not let go of the tongue, the burning sensation was too much. I cant recall any other beer with so many good points nearly undone by one huge negative."
"D- Overall, an interesting beer that is in desperate need of a freshness date."
"And yes, I tried the beer at multiple temperatures to see if the flavor evolves. It didn't evolve. The unpleasantness in the flavor evolved to an even stronger impact over time. I couldn't finish this beer... it was the first sink pour I have had to do in months."
"I smell heartburn."
"An interesting beer and reasonably well-crafted."
"Will for sure be having this one again."
"tastes like a scotch with peppercorns! cool! the spice is nearly more tactile than tastebud-centric and provides a familiar variety of heat. rye is hardly a conspicuous ingredient, though i don't not see it"
"I think this is the best 'rye' flavor I have gotten in a rye beer to date...rich, bold and bready. Peppercorns are a perfect spicy compliment, amazing how well they go together. Can you say homebrew inspiration? Sweet malts balance the zestiness well. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but thats a minor complaint. I like the overall flavor profile of this beer alot, I would buy this one again, even with the $5 price tag per 12 oz."
"TM. Spicy peppercorns everywhere. There is the slightest hint of toffee sweetness but is quickly submerged into the spice... instead a chocolate malt takes over as the background behind the pepper. There are oddball woody astringent flavors as well as occasional glimpses of the curacao flavor from the nose. Very drying, yet medium bodied only. Will make you more thirsty than when you began. Eventually a light warming from the peppercorns takes up semi-permanent residence in the back of your tongue. This brew plays out not unlike an excellent chile beer without even having chiles in it."
"Very interesting and cool beer, and definitely one of the best spiced beers I've had. I've had a couple of the chili beers, been unimpressed with their fake flavor. This one, however, tastes like I was honest to goodness brewed from peppercorns. If you like spicy food, try giving this beer a try!"
"Taste is starts off a touch sweet and rye bread like then comes the pepper. The finish is very smooth as this is not a heavy beer but it is all pepper on the way down. It leaves a little heat in the back of the throat which is good. It is a bit odd but very enjoyable."
"D - This was a fun beer! I really enjoyed having it. I might try it again soon."
"Pours a murky dark brown with a small 1 inch bone colored head. Nice rings of lace around the glass on the drink down. Smells of dark bread and malts, spices, and a subtle fruitiness. Taste is of dark rye bread, roasted malt, spices, and just as the label describes: peppercorns. The peppercorns are odd to be tasting in a beer but this is very tasty to me. There is a subtle burning in the throat after each sip. Mouthfeel is a pretty flat and it makes this beer somewhat hard to drink in a way. Overall, this is an above average beer with an interesting concept that could have been executed better in my opinion."
"11.5 oz? Seriously? That doesn't make sense in metric or English."
"O ~ an interesting beer..One I'd bring to a tasting for discussion...see what everyone thinks of it.. something about the spiciness tells me it'd go well with Mexican food?"
"Not much body, but even if there was, it would be hard to detect among the spice of the poivre. What a unique beer. This is one of those few times that, despite lower rankings across the board, the beer gets a higher overall ranking. That, sirs at Dieu du Ciel, is for your gusto and your cunning in putting together such a challenging little drink. Well done, even though I may never order another."
"Drink- Huge peppery finish. Very unique flavor profile that just didn't do it for me. I don't think I will have this one again."
"This is a very unique beer. Great flavors, unlike anything else I have sampled, this is a winner"
"O: I had some serious cottonmouth after drinking this. Just far too peppery to really be enjoyable as a beer."
"This is harder to get down as I drink this. Not for me. The pepper ruins it."
"Decent beer, but can somebody make a beer with peppercorns where they don't run roughshod? Please? This is too one-dimensional: a slug of pepper & the fading rye. I'd love to see it used as a complementary ingredient & not have it bringing on a case of acid reflux."
"D: Not one of the best offerings I've had from this amazing brewery, but it most certainly is interesting. It is definitely worth checking out if you are looking for something new."
"D - i love spicy food, and beer, so a spicy beer is a real treat, the rye beer characteristics are well represented and the, and pepper taste and feel is just like you would find on a pepper crusted steak, so tasty"
"D: One's enough. A very interesting drink, and not too heavy to have a couple, but the flavor is not so awesome that I'd want to spend an afternoon with it."
"Mouthfeel is way too thin and watery, and drinkability is actually hurt by the pepper being so pronounced. It's decent, but could be way better, as any number of flavors could have lent some balance to this beer."
"drinks ok. many good qualities just seem mismatched in this one. would drink again, but not something I can see myself craving."
"an average mouthfeel, medium body and carbonation. I'd try it again, but I think it's a one per sitting kind of beer."
"Strange beer, but I dig it. This might be a fun beer to drink with spicy food, so this will likely get another try in the future."
"I really think this would be a more enjoyable beer if the peppercorn was toned down. It really does take away from the rest of the flavor profile and takes the drinkability down. I do commend them for being unique with this one though."
"D: Well, it's a pricy beer and it's quite drinkable (although at 5.3% that's not too difficult). I especially like the growing heat from the peppercorns as you drink it. But seeing as it's so expensive it's not like you're going to be drinking a heap anyway. 3.5"
"Pepper is one of my least favourite spices but I tried to be as objective as i could here. This is a copper beer that looks amber in a bright light. The head was more of a puff that stuck to one side of the glass, carbonation not impressive. Nose is more coriander than anything else, pepper rubbed into a fresh steak. Strong pepper taste and throat burn not my favourite sensation, the rye is pronounced and slightly sweeter malts make it drinkable. I would have thought this much higher than 5 per cent ABV, again it must be the rye impressions and association. Dry, solid backbone, just not something I'd want to drink again, count me as not converted to peppercorns in my beer. But leave it to an excellent, creative and inventive brewery to put this out there, thanks Dieu Du Ciel!"
"Didn't know how much I would like this, but it's a great beer."
"The first time trying this on the first sip, you might be put off, the second sip you will begin to understand it a bit better. By the time I finished my first bottle of this I knew I would be buying it again because it was unique. Rye beer with two types of peppercorns, it leaves a spicy pepper finish (but not too overpowering) and is a great change up!"
"Mouthfeel is soft and silky. The beer coats your mouth but is smooth and medium to full bodied. It feels slightly thicker then what you'd expect but in a good way. An excellent drinking experience. This isn't the best beer out there but it is different and innovative that makes it a joy. I will definitely buy again."
"D. Its a perfect beer for food, so drink many and often. the spice cleanses other flavors and the carbonation cleans up the spice, leaving just the perception of heat."
"I'm ashamed I've never sampled a beer from this brewery before!"
"Drinkability - Not a beer i would go out and buy again but happy i tried. Very well made and has a solid tasting base."
"Certainly a very interesting and well crafted brew. I really enjoyed this one."
"D: it drank good and liked how the peppercorn add some dimension to this rye style beer. I'm glad I picked this one up."
"M/D: Medium bodied with good carbonation. Slight burning sensation due to the spices. As it warmed I found myself liking it less. Overall it is a very interesting beer, glad to have to tried it. Not bad by any means, but not really for me."
"Pours an amber brown with a thin off white head. Nose is fairly unique, bringing some mixed spice with rye, pepper, and others. Also present is a bt of fruit and mild caramel. Taste keeps the spicing at the front with some sweetness in back. Fairly dry. Drinkability is decent. Creative and somewhat unique. I liked this but wouldn't want to drink it frequently."
"this beer sounded like a good idea but the finished product doesnt quite work. i didnt get the pepper at first, then after a few sips it kicked it and was soon in high gear. my tongue was actually burning after a while. i dont gert any rye at all. the flavor seems off and is reminiscent of a maibock in a bad way. maybe this ones just not for me but im gonna have to say this beer needs some work."
"Drinkability : an average beer in the style spice and vegetable (brewed with rye)."
"D- Very delicious. the peppercorns were a welcome surprise when they kicked in, which brought a nice complexity to the sweet malts and the heavy Rye."
"Bottle pours a very dark red brown colour with a little amount of head. This tastes just like hot spices...wow. Makes your tongue tingle, thats for sure. That takes away from the drinkability, but its kinda cool that it could make your tongue tingle in that way. Very interesting beer though. Just the flavour isn't all that impressive."
"Overall: Ive heard so pretty bad reviews about this beer. Is it a verygood beer? No. Is it drinkable and unique? Yes. This beer would be kicked up a few notches paired with a nice steak or roastbeef dinner. I'm not much into food pAirings but this beer just screams Steak!"
"Overall this was an interesting beer, excited to see this brewery experimenting with flavours & styles. However I dont see any returnability to the Route des Epices..."
"M- Quite smooth, the pepper leaves spices in your mouth the more you drink, making your cheeks and tongue tingle the more you sip."
"D - The beer sans pepper a bit generic but the peppery bite is very interesting. I'd be interested in trying this at various temperatures and carbonation levels."
"Could definitely drink a couple of these at a nice steak dinner, just not on the regular."
"Thin carbonated mouthfeel, not very drinkable a bit too spicey."
"D: As for the pepper beers that I have had, this one is definitely the most overt. Nice brew."
"I also find that the sweetness improves as it warms up, which made it more pleasant for me. I would recommend drinking this at cellar temp."
"Medium brown body with fiery red highlights. Tan foam laces a little bit but doesn't retain well. A faint rye bread aroma is trapped beneath intensely aromatic cracked peppercorn. Heavy peppercorn flavour withthe tangy rye really only coming through as it warms up. Smooth mouthfeel contrasts with the peppers tingling spiciness. I think I would have liked this a bit better if it had some of the weizen-like esters and phenol I caught in the Mill Street Schleimhammer Roggenbier. Perhaps the failure lies in my expectations, but for me, this is a good beer that could have been great."
"D: Well this is an interesting and unique beer, but unfortunately not the most pleasant one to get through. A curious and gimicky beer.... however - it is well executed."
"This one has a unique head that is slightly darker where it meets the body and is lighter at the top. It smells of pepper, cinnamon and roasted malt (Shreddies?). If they put a pumpkin on the label and called a pumpkin spiced beer it would be one of the better of that sort I have had. It has a cumulative pepper effect which I like but for those who are adverse to such spice "" Beware!"""
"Still, it is as I expected, a very interesting brew, and one which is surprisingly approachable. The bite of the pepper becomes a bit much after a while, but it's quite the unique brew. Certainly something to look out for if you're after something a bit different."
"Definitely worth trying!"
"D - Woah, no way. Just give me the pepper shaker instead. I respect the effort but damn, this is too peppery for me."
"Drinkability: Clearly a controversial and extreme brew; I can see why some like it but it doesn't do the trick for me"
"Nice thick off white head with great retention. Cloudy red amber color with little visible carbonation. Malty, slightly sweet aroma. Malty, slightly sweet up front with no noticeable rye flavor. Medium bodied through the middle. Finish is similar to start except a peppery burn that builds to a mild intensity. Couldn't tell this was a rye beer, struck me more as a malty pale ale (with the exception of the pepper)."
"I'll give Dieu Du Ciel! credit for making something far more agreeable with peppercorns than I thought possible. I don't care for it enough, however, to understand the motivation for year-round production and distribution, especially when the brewpub has better offerings. Whether I liked it enough to buy again we'll have to see, but I'm good for now."
"Rather light-bodied and moderately carbonated. The unique flavour profile hurts the drinkability of this one slightly. Nevertheless, this beer definitely stands out from the crowd and may prove to a great beer to pair with food."
"D - It's tough to get through a bottle alone, though I think this really begs to be paired with food - a Vosges Mo's Bacon Bar would be great. One of the more distinctive beers I've tried, and worth sampling, to be sure."
"D - A real chore. The lingering pepper aftertaste just gets worse as I drink"
"Pours a deep brown colour with thick head. Ok lacing down the side of the glass. The smell of peppercorns is huge, but I love pepper so this is great. Some bready malts compliment the pepper. Flavour has a little dash of hop bite, but the pepper is the star of this beer. I could see this being too much pepper for some, but I enjoy it. I wouldn't want to have several of these in a row because of the intense spicing, but I certainly enjoy sipping this."
"341ml bottle from the Richmond & Fanshawe LCBO. Part of the Dieu du Ciel! Brewery Feature Release. Pours a deep copper orange with ruby hues, a thick off-white ring, and speckles of lacing on the nonic. Smell and taste are faint cocoa and vanilla, touch of cinnamon, dried fruit, a HUGE black pepper spiciness, some caramel and mocha undertones, slight bitterness, and a very hot and astringent finish. Rye aromas develop as the beer warms. A big blast of peppery heat lingers in the throat for quite some time, and I find it a little overwhelming, even unpleasant. Mouthfeel is dry, grainy, medium, spicy and peppery body, bitter and tingling astringency to end. This is a struggle to get through. I respect the fact that DDC has used an innovative, experimental recipe here, but for me it's just not an enjoyable beer. Now, what to do with these last two bottles?"
"Smooth carbonation, a real earthy dry finish blended with the heat, but still surprisingly easy drinking. It makes me excited to see what it will pair well with. Superbly crafted, unique - going back for more."
"A bold flavour like this I can imagine putting people off, but I am a spicehead and it's just a hugely enjoyable, unusual sensation to me. I just love this beer to bits and could drink it all night."
"This beer is soft in the mouth, but a little bit thin. It does, however, drink well! The peppery punch is something that both keeps lingering on your palate and nagging you to have another sip."
"The beer pours an amber color with a white head. The aroma is black pepper, cinnamon and nutmeg. A very spicy, inviting smelling beer. The flavor is heavy on the white pepper. I get a little bit of heat from the pepper - which mainly shows up in the aftertastes - but what really stands out is the great pepper flavor that is the beer has. I also get some caramel malt and some other spices. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Drink - I can applaud the fact that this beer is different, and also could possible see myself enjoying this at a ski chalet in the winter, but for the most part; it is not my sort of thing."
"D - Not a session. Though low ABV, too much flavor... Wear you out!"
"For such a spicy beer, Route des Epices drank pretty quickly. It was unique, complex, and definitely worth seeking out."
"D: This was a nice rye beer that really showed off the unique flavor of rye better than most beers in this style. The body was weak, but it was easy to drink. Recommended to try for the experience, even if it's not a favorite."
"I would have liked a little more rye-like spice, but maybe it's drowned out by the peppercorns. Still, very nice. Maybe the best use of peppercorns in a beer that I've had."
"12 ounce bottle. Picked this up on a whim because I've been on a bit of a rye beer kick lately and I really liked the label design. Pours a darkened amber with little to no head whatsoever. Spicy nose with a clear chocolate and caramel rye smell. Raw black pepper hits your tongue first, and rye makes the beer quite hot. The pepper gives way to some smooth caramel malt character, but there's no hops there to back it up. A huge, almost overwhelming, burst of pepper finishes the entire experience. As you continue to drink the pepper just lingers on the palate. This is a very complex and very interesting beer but the pepper aspect will likely turn away the casual drinker. That said, I enjoyed it quite a bit and wouldn't mind it again - though it's one I'd have to have a single of, any more and the pepper would be just too much."
"D: This beer is very drinkable if you like spicy foods (like pepper steak). I would definitely try this again because it's unique."
"D: Good for what it is; though I really like the peppercorn flavor paired with the rye, the pepper proves to be a tad much after a few sips"
"Doesn't really weigh heavy, pepper and carbonation probably help with that. I hear its expensive, had it at the SD fest, so I dunno if I'd try it again, just depends on the asking price. Was happy to have checked it out this time though."
"Interesting take on a beer. I like peppercorn sauces so I found this to be quite an enjoyable experienc, but I can see others being turned off."
"A really tasty beer. The pepper probably means that this is a better food beer than it is a simple drinking beer but as a beer it is good and I really would like to try this again with a nice steak."
"D - Definitely could not toss back a 6-er of this stuff, but it was good for a taste. Would recommend this one to anyone searching for a unique and memorable experience, but wouldn't recommend it as a sessionable beer."
"Poured from a 341ml bottle into a tulip, thanks to freud for this one! Pours a clear deep brown/auburn, with little head (mostly carbonation) even as a I try to aggressively develop some. Thin layer of head retains and I'm left with almost no lacing by the end of this. Smell is malty, fruity, spicy and complex. Interesting, this is my first rye beer however. Taste is of rye and very malty, no bitterness in here at all. Peppercorn is really present, and other than being involved in some taste, leaves a strong burning sensation on my tonsils after the fact; not something I particularly enjoyed. Pretty full and warming mouthfeel, moderate carbonation, but that tingling from that pepper really takes away from it on the whole. An interesting beer to be frank, but not something I could ever have more than one of, and certainly not something I'd be looking for given the opportunity."
"Give it a try - Brasserie Dieu Du Ciel makes an unusual set of beers that, if not perfect, are at the very least novel and perfectly drinkable. If the peppercorn heat drops out with age, this has the potential to be a very enjoyable beer a year or two out from now."
"Wow, I expected a challenging drink with this, but it provided very little pleasure. I'm not sure who the target audience is, because the craftsmanship is apparent, but it's not me."
"D: Interesting characteristics but the spice takes its toll after a while. Would go well with Indian food, but not something I'd want more than one of."
"Some beers are just for very particular occassions. This is one of those beers, although I have no idea when I would want one of these beers again except to show someone else that this kind of beer exists. This is sooo peppery it's insane. I'm halfway through but I'm starting to worry about messing up my palate for the rest of the evening. This burns. There are some other light dried fruit like aromas and soft malt flavours but pepper is right there at the front-and back for that matter. It's not terrible; it's the red-headed step-child of the Dieu Du Ciel brand for me."
"This was a very unique beer. Doubt I would order it again, but I'd be interested in experimenting with food pairing given its pepper spiciness. Would recommend only to adventurous beer drinkers."
"Taste: Interesting, as expected. Up front its got a lot of dry caramel and graininess but isn't very sweet or bitter. Very natural tasting. In the middle some juicy, slightly sour fruits and caramel emerge and has some underlying grain complexity. Also a little grassiness that might be my perception of the pepper - though there is an underlying spiciness. Moderate carbonation and mouthfeel. Finish is light pepper which lingers on the back of the throat and tongue forever - and its very interesting - along with more caramel."
"D - Too peppery for my liking and I'm not sure I would ever get used to that."
"Carbonation is good, alcohol is low, but the taste makes this one difficult to drink. Not appealing to me."
"Drinkability is where the beer loses marks. The intense peppery heat builds as you drink and by the end your palate is just about ruined. Would be awesome to finish up a roast dinner with in the colder months, but despite it being only 5% ABV, this is one of the least sessionable beers I can think of. Delicious in it's own right, though."
"10/10 for creative thinking... but really the pepper is too dominant and doesn't really blend with the rest of the beer."
"Drinkability - pretty much a sipper for a 5% brew due to the unusual heat. Gotta let the palate cool down a bit at times. Great spin on a rye beer."
"Pours a hazy, brown color. 1/5 inch head of a white color. Slight retention and slight lacing. Smells of pepper strongly, slight cinnamon, slight sweet malt, and slight tomato. This does not seem to be a Rye beer to me, but perhaps it is. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of pepper, yeast, slight sweet malt, and slight other spice. Overall, a rather interesting beer, but the rye is too little."
"This is my first Rye beer as we dont see many of this style in AUSTRALIA if any at all to be honest if i think back correctly so im definately interested in tasting it and this addition of peppercorns has got me even more keen on trying it as its two firsts for me as ive never heard of a brew using peppercorns and succeeding anyway onto the beer it pours a burnt amber,copper hue with nice carbonation that leaves behind a tanned two finger head that retains for a little while and leaves some sticky lacing here and there,the smell is almost like a normal malty lager only more sweeter with hints of toffee malts,barley and some spices,it has a nice medium bodied mouthstyle which starts out medium and finishes thin which works well for this brew and has tastes of burnt toffee,caramel malts,bitter coffee and finishes with a nice spicy,peppery dry finish obviously due to the use of peppercorns and quite simply in this brew it really does work even though i wouldnt recommend this brew as a session beer,thirst quencher or a companion to hot curries it really is an interesting brew that i would buy again and could see myself eating a big juicy steak with it, definately recommend."
"F: Finish is very spicy with a lingering slowly fading heat, like i just sucked back a slightly spicy hot pepper. Dries pretty well but leaves a slight sweet syrupy flavor. More malts late on the finish as well with a little roast and coffee and even slight creamy chocolate."
"Slainte."
"I could easily drink this beer all night!"
"Pours a hazy amber brown color with a tight and creamy tan colored head that settled into a solid ring. The aroma is slightly sour and spicy, has a detectable rye bread presence. The taste is that of an amber ale, not much hop presence, with a nice sour and spice punch. There is a bit of a zest with this one. Doesn't hit right away but pops up like tobasco, though not hot. Seems to be a true rye beer without the high hop profile like most rye beers have. A very solid body, chewy, but has nice carbonation. Finishes spicy and a bit hot from that spice. A differnt take on the rye beer. Not so much hoppy but really focuses on the rye."
"This was a very tasty beer, but it's a bit spicy."
"Pours a nice golden brown color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy/foamy off-white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some spice notes. The taste is malty, slightly sweet, peppery, slightly bitter. Medium body. Drinkable, not a bad brew, but would not seek out again."
"I wouldn't drink more than one of these in a sitting, but would definitely order another for a special occasion."
"Huge rye smell, caramel, almost a sour odor. I like my rye whiskey, but I haven't had a beer with flavor like this before. Very interesting compared to other beers that have claimed to be rye-based. Strong caramelly-rye malt flavor, but still a little dry overall. Honey ham. Otherwise the taste unfortunately thins out at the end, but not before the nice peppery burn shows up, and lingers for a while (almost like eating thai/indian food). This contributes to MF as well. This is a pretty interesting beer, and I would recommend to anyone looking for something different. Super smooth, goes down really easy, even moreso than my old crusher standby, PBR."
"Comes out of the tap an opaque chocolaty brown with a fine-bubbled pale beige, almost off-white, head. Spicy aroma is like freshly-baked rye or pumpernickel bread. Lively, spicy flavor has malty and fruity undertones and leaves a spicy finish that hangs around for a while. Texture is smooth yet edgy and quite tingly."
"The flavor doesn't build on you and tire your palate like some spice beers. It's unusual, probably not for everyone, but it's actually very drinkable for a spiced beer."
"11.5 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a dark amber color with a half inch off-white head that went away quickly. Not much lacing, either. The aroma is malty and spicy, the beer smells like toffee, pepper, caramel and chocolate. The taste is the pretty much similar to the aroma, but the pepper flavor is much stronger compared to the aroma. Also, there's a bit of dark fruit I can taste, too. The peppercorns linger quite a while in the finish. It gets spicier and spicier the longer I drink it. I know there is rye in this beer, but I think the pepper overpowers the rye, or that the combination of the 2 makes this nice and spicy. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit coating and it's well carbonated. Drinkability is good too, I think it's easy enough to drink. It's a unique brew, but I like it. I could session this on occasion too. I think it's better than the label makes it sound, and I know I'll be buying this again the next time I find it."
"Overall by far not my favorite. It could have been worse, and I have had worse spiced beers, but it could have been a lot better."
"Pours a somewhat hazy amber brown, with a minimal amount of off-white head that leaves a trace of lace. The smell is mostly malty toffee with a glint of pepper and breadcrust. The taste starts off with the same amltiness, but then eases into an array of spices: cracked pepper, cinnamon, mustard, even possibilities of salt and cumin. Needless to say, a unique flavor, but not all that bad. The body is nice and medium, though the carbonation is a tad high, leaving this brew to be drinkable, but not overly so."
"12 ounce bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours deep amber with a thick off-white head. Aroma is light, with the obvious caraway and peppercorn notes but not much else. Flavor is similar, not much of a base beer here. Grainy with a smoothly integrated pepper character that is very strong but not in a bad way. Provides a tiny bit of heat in the back of the throat. I kept waiting, thinking that some warmth would allow the base to come through and show some complexity, but it did quite the opposite. Sort of thin and watery, basic. But I do like the pepper flavor, so at least it has that. Drinkable and solid, but with the rad peppercorn notes this could have been something much better."
"A good beer with interesting flavor but not nearly up to Dieu du Ciel's standards or justified in cost."
"well worth trying and I'm a little disappointed I'm not having this with a meal because it would pair well with most meals"
"D: A very interesting take on the style. It is intense in flavor, but doesn't overwhelm."
"If you think the spice is overdone in this beer, I recommend Futhermore's Knot Stock as a more subtle option for a pepper beer."
"D: I liked this beer much than I thought I would. Drinkable."
"Overall impression: Interesting beer, but the overwhelming pepper severely limits enjoyment. Would love to try this same beer with about half the spice."
"A beer that works for what it is, the marriage of the rye and peppercorns definitely melds well, and remains balanced and in harmony. However it doesn't really blow my skirt up as far as wanting to revisit much more after a couple of them, plus from DDC there are so many other beers I'd step over my own mother to get to again."
"It tastes like a marzen or scotch-style ale with its malted barley predominance. The zing of its feel, however, is more like a barleywine. This beer looks, smells, tastes, and feels much stronger than it actually is. The feel is thick and chewy enough to think you're biting deer jerky. The peppercorns offer a neat sizzling sensation. The whole mouth experience with this liquid is an interwoven combo whose parts still retain identity. It tastes sweet strong and feels spicy, but its real punch (ABV) fails to justify its effect. In that regard, it's like a worst-case scenario: sizzling sweet sensations without an ability to make meaningful impact. It's like Viagra not working. Though your might respect the effot, it's not compelling enough for frequent revisiting."
"Taste starts out with slightly sweet malts, cut by the rye. Then the black pepper kicks in!! This is not the slight peppery taste of a complex Belgian. This is heavy-duty chew-into-a-peppercorn pepper flavor. I drank this beer with a nicely seasoned steak and it was just right as a complement. Some hoppiness and mre rye in the finish. Mouthfeel is rich and interesting as the pepper plays with the tongue and tastebuds. I found this drinkable and interesting. At 5.0 % I think I could enjoy a few of them."
"Murky looking tarnished bronze. Thin light brown head leaves sporadic rings of lace. Kind of a sticky syrupy sweet aroma. Kind of also has a ""homebrew"" aroma to it. Wow, this is a hard beer to describe. Some definite peppery tones in the mix. Quite spicy and pepper actually as I advance through this. I don't mind it and find it unique. Base maltiness is solid if uneventful. Between the rye and the peppercorns, this is one of the more spicy beers I've ever had. There's a hotness to it. But it's still quite drinkable. Good for a try, but I'll not be back for a long while."
"The beer possesses a nice deep red/brown hue and takes on some nice grainy and raisin tones, but, unfortunately, it would take something stronger than raisin to break through the spice. Don't get me wrong. The carbonation is nice, the spice is light, and there is a lightness and a crispness to this I have yet to experience in another rye beer. But the choice of the peppercorns, while unique, inevitably numb one's mouth to the rest of the wonderful tastes."
"D: Good, but wow does that pepper taste stay with you. Glad I was able to try this, but probably won't seek it out again."
"An average beer aspiring to greatness. Poured with a small light tan head and no lace. Color is a nice, clear dark brownish amber. Aroma is mild but a little of the pepper comes out with some malt. Flavor is at first a little peppery along with caramel malt, right after that it's a little hoppy, then the pepper keeps on coming. Body and carbonatioin are average at best. Finish is pretty much just the long warming effects of the pepper. Interesting premise, nothing real special tho."
"Poured from 11.5 ounce bottle into Unibroue tulip. Head quickly fades and not much lacing to speak of. Sweet malts dominate the nose and maybe some coffee notes and sweet fruits. Not picking up the peppercorns in the nose, maybe they are dominated by the sweet aromas. Upon tasting, the spice is felt and tasted for sure on the back of the tongue after the swallow. Correction...actually I am picking up the peppercorn aromas as the beer warms...interesting. Taste is dominated by the sweet malts and the peppercorns on the back end, especially upon warming. A unique beer and a pleasant experience."
"Dieu Du Ciel Route des épices pours a finger of quickly-receding foam over a deep amber brew. Nose is sweetish malts, butterscotch, yeast funk, and peppercorn. The flavor is likewise spicy rye malt with notes of fruit and butterscotch, balanced by fresh ground peppercorn off the back. Mouthfeel is light and smooth, with the ground pepper adding some warmth in the aftertaste. Pepper seems to be taking the place of hops in this particular brew- very very interesting stuff!"
"I love this beer. Exceptional. I would love to drink this all night long, but it's exceptionally rich considering it's ABV. My frist beer from Dieu du Ciel and I couldn't be more impressed. Looking forward to the other two."
"Quite unique. I've had a handful of pepper beers in the past, but nothing like this. Check it out if you have a chance."
"I was actually not that crazy about the taste of this beer and couldn't down more than one of them at a sitting, but I still can appreciate its uniqueness and craftsmanship."
"Notes: Beers willing to dare and provoke like this have to be cherished and advocated for. Surely they are not for everybody or anytime but are a great addition to craft beer diversity. This one in particular offers a notable punch in a rather drinkable brew with an admirable balance for such a loud beer."
"D - Route Des Épices is quite an interesting beer that definitely goes against the norm. The peppercorn character really stands out and works well with the spicy nature of the rye, resulting in an extremely flavorful and unique beer."
"D: It's surprising what a beer can taste like. The peppers open up the senses to taste ans smell everything else. This would be great with a food pairing."
"Overall, this beer is very interesting, and is one that is actually quite drinkable. The mouthfeel is quite and experience, and the beer itself is palatable."
"This is one of my favorite beers in the world. I have to admit when I heard about a beer brewed with peppercorns I was not expecting good things. They do it so tastefully that the rye flavors give way to the tingly aftertaste in a way that is sublime and near perfect. I paid just over $4 for an 11.5 oz bottle and I think it is worth the premium price. This is my favorite beer from Du De Ciel and I think it blows Peche Mortel out of the water. Have this beer with a good steak and you will be in heaven."
"D - Nice and spicy, this is a solid brown ale with unique contributions of rye and hot black pepper. The black pepper is strong enough to warm the throat on the way down, but also lends the beer an earthiness that works very well with the rye. I wouldn't want more than one of these, but it was very interesting and well worth trying."
"I imagine that more than a couple of these would provide some serious heartburn effects, if one were prone to such things. Other than that though, it's tasty and easily drinkable."
"There is a lot of spicy heat in this brew. Would be wonderful with the proper food pairing. This is something off the beaten path, and certainly worth a try."
"There is a surprising amount of spice to this beer. I would say this is more of a beer for to accompany a meal, rather than an extended drinking experience."
"Overall a pretty solid rye, Dieu Du Ciel is doing a great job of making beers that are different from most everyone else, yet are still very good."
"Pours dark brown with a thick, creamy off-white head with good retention. Good rings of lacing. Nose and taste live up to the label. Pungent rye aroma with a liberal helping of cracked pepper. As in a LOT of cracked pepper. Flattish mouthfeel with low carbonation and a long spicy finish. Taste really pops. Bitter rye and hops up front, very tangy. The black peppercorns then take over. Spicy, hot, and quite strong. Problem was after a while, it was just too much. The pepper made me kind of queasy as it built up. I can't see drinking more than one of these, and kind of hoped I had a partner to finish the last 1/3 of my 12 oz. bottle."
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is awesome!!! It has a wonderful mix of rye and crystal malts along with a kick ass peppercorn aroma; very unique indeed. The taste is good. This is some kind of weird ass beer. I like it, but it's way out there. It has a solid rye beer flavor of spicey rye and caramel malts. It goes down smooth and finishes with an excellent peppery taste. It really hits you in the finish like having someone crack black pepper in your beer. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is truely unchartered territory. Big ups for the effort on this one. I'm in!"
"D: One word: unique. I can safely say that I've never had a beer that tastes like this before. Not that enjoyable to me, to be honest. But I'll give bonus points for thinking outside the box."
"M - Solid body, not overly gassy. Maintained decent carbonation throughout the life of the beer."
"This isn't the horror show that some have depicted it as, but all in all, it's merely OK."
"A zesty little brew here - very spicy/peppery with caramel...A unique brew that works well... I'll have to grab another bottle to put my steak pairing theory to work!"
"light body but smooth. nice tingle from the moderate carbonation, also matching with the gentle heat."
"This beer poured a clear dark red amber color and formed a huge foamy off white head that coated the glass with lace as it subsided. A medium amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, coriander, pepper and spices. The flavor was of malt, hot peppers, and some spices. The body was medium light, slightly soft and the finish was spicy/peppery. An alright beer, but not one this brewers better ones."
"Taste - rye, toasted bread, slightly sweet and bisquity. Pepper hidden behind at first but really comes to play after. Extreme peppery aftertaste, which is not exactly bad, very unique taste. Very good stuff! You have to try it."
"As advertised, this is indeed a peppery brew, and a well-wrought one at that. Sure you have to like pepper, but hey, who doesn't? It's a shit-ton better for you than table salt, and works quite well with the multi-varied malt here. A decent beery ode to those bygone explorers who made this possible for us."
"I was going to give the drinkability a 4, but after getting close to the bottom of the glass, I gotta say the pepper does not grow on you. It's still unique, and could be a great accompaniment to certain meals (hopefully not peppered food, though, lest you get overwehelmed.)"
"I can certainly see how this beer might appeal to pepperheads who like their mouth to burn like molten lava no matter what they consume, because, underneath the heat are some really nice malt flavors. Too bad the pepper all but completely stomps them out."
"This beer pours a hazy amber color. The head is a quarter inch in height, and recedes within seconds into almost nothing. The aroma is pepper, and some light caramel malt. But really it is all pepper, and that is not pleasing to me. The taste is much the same, and just as repugnant. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this beer is a drain pour. I can think of no ideas as to how someone could possibly like it. It is straight up nasty."
"The bottle is right, the spice flavor leaves a tingle on the tongue. I've had beers that have pepper in them before, but this takes the cake. Rye and peppercorns work amazingly well together. Not everyone's cup of tea, or the perfect beer for every occasion, but I totally dig this beer."
"Overall, this is an interesting beer. I like the spices, but it is kind of giving me a headache. It isn't bad, just nothing I'd drink a lot of in a night. Give it a try if you like spicy peppers."
"This beer pours a deep clear amber with a minimal offwhite head to it, receded relatively quickly, not much lacing to speak of. Nose is of spices upfront, though blended that it's hard to decipher which spices are present in it, as the beer warms peppercorn is distinctive in the nose, and good presence of carmel in the nose as well. Taste is where all really comes through. The peppercorn gets you up front - yet not overpowering, strong presence but backs off enough to not take over the entire beer. Blended nicely is some caramel and bready malts that really even this beer out. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, light to medium carbonation, goes down pretty easily, thick and sticky. This is a fun beer to dry, or to have as a one off beer, would be good with a steak."
"Poured from a 341ml bottle into my nonic pint glass. The ale appears a clear deep amber color with about an inch of off white foam. The label does not lie. Yeah, there's peppercorns in this beer. A very nice compliment to the spiciness usually associated with a rye beer. Nice toasted bread and sweet caramel comes through as well. Medium to full bodied with ample carbonation. Tasty and unique, but I'm not sure I could get through more than one bottle at a time due to the pepper notes."
"D- Overall, this is a very interesting brew that is definitely worth picking up! Recommended!"
"D: Definitely a beer to share with friends. I appreciate how unique this is, but the pepper is by far the dominant flavor. Dieu du Ciel nailed the aroma on this one, but the pepper needs to be toned down."
"Overall: got a little sticky at the end, but otherwise an excellent quaffer with some good flavor"
"Sadly, a drain pour for me. I couldn't get past three sips before tossing this one in the kitchen sink."
"woah. almost didn't review this one after reading the review before mine. enough said... ""brown ale on drugs"". black pepper, white pepper, caramel and earth. touch of hop in the finish, but the bitter and acid may be the peppercorn. sneaks up on ya. unique. one of a kind. well done. love this brewery."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a copper color with one finger of khaki head. The retention was very good as a collar and the lacing impressive in curtains. The aroma was unique and unusual, both white and black pepper along with toasted malt and a little caramel malt tucked underneath. The flavors were also unique, with the peppercorns being clearly defined. The caramel and toasted malt provided a nice backbone though the hops profile was difficult to detect. The pepper and spice elements added to the acidity of the beer and I couldn't imagine going through a few in a row without heartburn. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body medium and the carbonation light/medium. For those looking for an unique beer experience that is still done with finesse, look no further; this one was like a brown ale on drugs."
"I can't really tell if the spicy peppercorn flavor fades, or I just get use to it after my taste buds are attached. Either way it is a great beer. Lots of subtle flavors. Recommended."
"The mouthfeel is nice and medium bodied, a nice base with good carbonation. This all adds up to some very nice drinkability. Delicious."
"This beer has the funkiest, most long lasting, peppery aftertaste I've ever had in a beer. It is quite a delight actually and very novel. The nose is full of peppercorn spices too. The beer pours a nice mahogany with not much head, no lacing, just a touch of carbonation. I'm not overly familiar with a rye beer but it is spicy, a bit grainy, a touch of caramel, maybe some fruity malt sweetness, but the defining feature here is the unmistakable peppercorn and spicy bite that just doesn't go away. The peppercorn is almost medicinal and does for the throat what horseradish does for the sinuses. This is a medium bodied beer with low carbonation. Wow, this is unique. Try this beer for the spicy peppercorn experience alone. L'Chaim."
"How much someone is going to like this beer hinges on how much they like spicy foods. If they shy away from even mild hot sauce, this beer is going to be a bad drink. But if spicy is their thing, then it should be rather enjoyable. It's spicy in a different sense from the chipotle beers, where it's less of a constant burnt, and more of a spice in the finish. Recommended for a try. For me, it's a good beer but I'm glad I only have one. I wouldn't repeat, not because it's a bad beer, but because spicy generally isn't my thing."
"D- Certainly worth a try. I found it very enjoyable but would have wished for greater depth of character in the flavor."
"D: This is a fantastic and unique beer. All the flavors are in balance, and play well together. While it's not a ""session"" beer, it's incredibly drinkable."
"I wasn't sure if I'd like this and I'm still not sure if I do. It's strange drinking a spicy beer. Nice try at something unique but a spicy beer isn't something I find myself craving very often."
"This beer has a lot of delicious flavors but they are all hidden. Too bad. I do like the low 5% abv, though."
"Not a bad beer, but not my beer style. Glad I tried it 'tho!"
"Pours a clear brown body with one finger head that dies easily and leaves some lace. An overtly peppery, spicy smell that isn't exactly pleasant dominates the nose. Has a medium-bodied texture to it that passes smoothly but with the peppers in it it has a very drying quality on the tastebuds. Hops and sweet malts seem to be held in check by this, although it does have a distinct taste. Not a bad beer but I wouldn't session it due to the strong taste."
"Pours a light brown with minimal head leaving a little lacing. Aroma is of fresh pepper with a malt backbone. On tasting, I detect a hint of rye, but peppercorns dominate. I have never had a beer like this one, and the unique flavour is really intriguing. The spicy nature of the peppercorns dominate mouthfeel giving an otherwise thin beer some extra dimension. The heat and flavour of the spice lingers long after a sip. Drinkability is low. Although this is an interesting, well rounded beer, one is enough. I plan on returning to this someday, but not right away."
"It's like a marble rye open faced sandwich of mildly spiced pepper. I like it. But it begs to be paired up with some kind of meaty sandwich. Smoked salmon or turkey."
"This is an interesting beer.. I can't say its something I love but it is unique and give credit to the brewer for trying something different."
"Beer poured into my rochefort chalice is burnt orange in color. No head or lacing to speak of. Nose is peppery with some caramel malt. Wow, quite interesting here. Upfront and through most of the drink the beer is thin and dominated by malts. The finish leaves a spicy tickle at the top of your throat. That tickle then morphs into a spicy and peppery lingering taste across my entire mouth. This takes some getting used to as the feeling is similar to what your mouth feels like after some spicy salsa. Only problem here is that the more beer you drink the more prounced the spicy lingering becomes. I guess I should have expected this since it's brewed with peppercorns. I enjoyed trying this unique beer but it isn't something I'd recommend to anybody unless they really want to try something different and they like spicy food."
"This was just very average and had no spice, which is the reason I bought it."
"[OC; tap]"
"Edit: though, that pepper really kind of gets to you by the end."
"Overall, I thought this was an interesting and tasty beer. I will probably pick up another bottle in the future."
"Drinkability - I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. I found the bitterness to be in perfect contrast with the medium peppery heat."
"D - This would be quite low in my opinion due to the high spiciness. I would imagine I could get a bad case of heartburn from a couple of these."
"Pours a dark copper color with a very small head that quickly disapeared. No lacing and almost totally devoid of carbonation. I detect a caramel malt base with some spice from rye and pepper. The flavor is good but I have a hard time connecting this with a rye beer. This has more of a sweet caramel malt base. The peppercorns gives the beer a bite and warmth in the finish. Leaves a warming affect in the throat as well. The body is thin and waterly. Almost completely flat as well. Not a well put together ale. I do like the pepper and warmth though. I would be willing to give this beer another try someday."
"Pours a slightly cloudy deep copper bordering on brown with a huge bubbly off white head that dissipates to a cap. Bready biscuity malts, incense, and pepper make up the majority of the aroma. The smell reminds me of walking into whole foods. Taste starts off with a quick caramel and biscuit which quickly fades to a spicy rye and incense which segways into a spicy peppery finish that heats up for a minute or so after every sip. Body is medium, carbonation is high, mouthfeel is watery/spicy. This one is different! I really enjoyed this one, especially that spicy peppery finish. The incense type taste and aroma that I got from this one was a little overpowering at times."
"M + D: Carbonation has a little sparkle to it... and then there's that bit of a burn brought on by the pepper. It is much more pleasant than a lot of 'chili beers' or similar, though it could have used a little more sting to the carbonation to help deliver. I wasn't hugely impressed by this one in a way I thought I might be. It's still a decent beer... I just don't know if it will be memorable enough to pick up again."
"D: A very distinctive brew, like most other DDC beers. Definitely worth checking out if you like spicy beers. Could be well fitting with less zesty food."
"If you happen to like rye beers or beers that have rye added to them, you will like this beer. It's flavorful, tasty and low in alcohol. It's pretty much the type of beer I'd drink all the time if I could brew something close enough to it. Pick up a bottle today or check out their brewpub in Montreal."
"D: Good drinkability, a great lingering peppercorn fade for a finish makes this a hot and spicey treat that is one not to be missed. Unique and well flavored and definitely comes highly recommended."
"D: One and done. Too much heat for me."
"Notes - I really wasn't sure whether to give the taste a 5 or a 4.5, but end the end it really is exceptional. The peppercorns are an integral part of the beer, yet not overpowering. Nor do they distract from the malty rye base. Additionally the pepper is complex and takes on different characteristics throughout the tasting."
"pours a nice cotton candy head. light cream tan, cappuccino in color. dark mahogany amber body. good carbonation. nice lace. smell is a very consistent rye. great malt character and light peppercorn on the nose. peppercorn seems to fade as it breathes. wonderful body. great feel. taste with a nice malt backbone. peppercorn is definitely prevalent warming indeed but not astringent hoppy pepperiness. smooth, robust, absolutely perfect with Cajun food... like soul mates. and seitan too."
"I like this one. This beer is different. Rye beer? Not really. Pepper beer? Hells yeah! The pepper spiciness is big and bold, but it's still an enjoyable drinker. I don't know if I'd want more than a couple at a sitting."
"Not at all what I was expecting, but that is not a bad thing in the slightest. Only my second beer from DDC, and I am loving the creativity I'm seeing. I only wish they were a little more affordable to pull out en mass at my next cook out."
"D - This beer really was a miss for one of my favorite breweries, if you like the idea of peppercorn infused beer, give this a try, but a huge disappointment seeing how much I love Rye Ales"
"D - No no no no. I don't see why you would buy this unless you just had an unusual love affiar with pepper"
"Pours a dark amber/brown with little clarity. Two finger white/brown head that develops a nice collar and some laciness. Aroma is yeasty with a mix of malt and cereal grains. Taste was all pepper with some malt. The taste was not overdone, but any other flavors are drowned out. Decent body and average texture. The beer was enjoyable and different. The taste was not one I enjoyed and would not pick this beer up as a session beer."
"D: Not real drinkable. The small sampe was nice, it is a very unique brew that is worth a try, but not one I would sit down with and drink a whole bottle."
"Thick syrupy body, peppery on the nose and tongue. Reminiscent of spiced meat; proscuitto, corn beef, smoked ham. Major malt dominance, hops hiding as an undertone. Thick, pillowy head sits atop and oil spill of toasted rye grain. A warming ale with a smoky attitude and some aged wood to top it off. A delicious change-it-up ale but can't session it or lay back and refresh."
"Pours a five finger cream head that fades slowly leaving a very good lace. Almost clear amber color. Spicy, hoppy nose. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is spicy, peppery with some malt, lingering pepper finish. $5.75 for a 11.5oz bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"D-The great thing about this pepper beer, compared to some others I've sampled in the past, is that Route de espices does not overly molest my mouth with pepperiness. The pepper is present and distinct, at times very noticeable, but it didn't seem overbearing. Very good, and an enjoyable diversion from the norm."
"Pours a very dark amber/ brown color and a huge foamy tan head. Very spicy pepper aroma with some maltiness and dark fruit. Malty flavor with some dark fruit up-front followed by a HUGE spicy peppery lingering finish. You can feel the heat when you take a breath after drinking. This is not like a novelty beer with a green pepper floating in it. This is very coplex with an intensely spicy kick."
"Drinkability- I could drink a couple of these with a nice meat and cheese platter, but by itself it's just too much. I appreciate what they are trying to do, and would recommend this to anyone who likes intense/unique beers. A very good beer to have with certain foods, and I bet it'd be great to cook with."
"This is not a beer to session. This one is for food."
"M/D - this one was very dry. although i thought it was very good, the peppercorn finish didn't let up and by the end of the bottle, it was just too much. But it was a very enjoyable brew, just not more than one to try."
"Rather muted coppery color. Slight haze to it. Aroma is somewhat peppery and earthy. Great blast of spice right up front-huge pepper flavor. As big as it is I kind of like it. Very sharp and acrid. Has a mellow heat to it. Black pepper and spicy red peppers combined-very unigue. Definate maltiness to it-a tad sweet. Great ""hot"" mouthfeel to it. If only the famous Ed's Cave Creek was this balanced he would have gone far! I couldnt do a lot of this that is for sure. Still very interesting and a well done beer. Cetainly pushes the rye beer envelope."
"A boost bottle- Pours a murky copper with an off white cap of foam. nice pretty lace. Nose is a blast of peppercorn with caramel and burnt malts, also a bit nutty with dark fruits. Tastes sweet, of caramel, toffee and dark pit fruits, with a nice peppery burn that does well alongside said sweetness. Rye and vanilla round out the flavour profile. A nice beer to be sipped and enjoyed. Thanks boost."
"If you enjoy very spicy Asian, or Indian food, try pairing this with those foods. Otherwise, prepare yourself for the burning sensation. I couldn't even finish the whole bottle. I can't believe I paid 8 bucks for that!"
"D: I found this to be a quite surprising and innovative beer from our friends to the North. I appreciate the power of pepper and for that reason I really enjoyed it. Knowing what I know now I would couple this beer with some Cajun or Mexican food to destroy any sense of tastes I have."
"I really enjoyed this one. Very interesting and different. IF the price werent so extravagant, ($4.50 per 11.5oz) I would have this again. As it stands, this will probably be the last time I try this."
"It's hard to recommend this beer. If you want to try something different, go for it, but unless you love pepper this beer probably won't impress you."
"Man, this beer is all about peppercorns. I can tell there's a bit of rye and hops in the background, but it mostly just a big pepper flavor and aroma. It's a good taste, but there's just way too much of it. Call this a pepper beer, it just happens to have rye in it."
"I enjoy hot-spicy food and use Tabasco liberally in chili and a few other things. I even like the idea of a pepper-flavored beer, as long as the pepper is an accent and not an 800 lb. gorilla, as it is in Route des Epices. Sorry, pass."
"D: Ok drinkability, but the peppercorn takes away from the beer a little bit. The pepper aspect does not seem to blend very well with the malts and takes away from the rye aspect of the beer. Ok, but nothing really impressive."
"D, notes: I liked this beer. Well done pepper addition. The warmth from the pepper adds significantly to the mouthfeel. I would not call this beer highly sessionable but I would not define it as a one-off novelty either."
"Was this beer brewed to go along with a smoked meat sandwich on rye? It would make a great pairing. Anyways this is pretty drinkable, although perhaps too bold due to the pronounced peppery flavours for sessioning. Highly recommended to fans of rye beers as well as pepper. If readily available this would be something that i would keep in a regular rotation."
"My only advice: don't drink it too cold. You'll miss out."
"Drinkability: the heavy pepper spice grows a bit tiring after a pint of this. Not a session beer but it has a unique flavor."
"Decent moutfeel, but the pepper presence can lend to a bit of a stinging feel. A nice sipper, but not sessionable and not something I would buy en masse."
"I have had a few other Dieu Du Ciel beers, and I have enjoyed them all. I would take this one as an anomoly."
"D- I think one is enough of these. I enjoyed it but would be very sparing in buying it again. It's nice to throw you palate for a loop every so often, but I certainly would not enjoy drinking it every day."
"D: This beer is something else, it really really took me by suprise. If you like a spicy beer this is right up your alley. Yet for as spicy as this beer is, it also demonstrates an excellent balance, every complexity of the beer is able to be detected even though the peppery spice is laid on thick. I rate the drinkablity good only because the spiciness is something I am not all that used to. Very interesting, not to mention tasty. I would argue that this could be called an extreme beer."
"Slightly hazed with an amber/reddish colour. There was a short cap from the pour that settled into a solid collar and skim of fine beige bubbles. Transient lacing clung to the glass at each sip. Big caramel aroma with some fruity esters, raisins, fairly spicy though nicely balanced. Whoa! Big time pepper in the flavour. It's pleasantly malty and fruity up front, dark fruits and raisins with some bready yeast character and caramel, but once the spice kicks in everything else fades away. Nice texture, medium bodied with soft carbonation. This is quite a good beer, but if you're not a fan of pepper then this probably isn't for you. It would go great with a lot of food, since it would have to problem holding its own against some pretty heavy flavours. By itself, it's not the most drinkable beer, but it's pretty tasty."
"Another innovative beer from these guys up in Montreal who in my opinion are the most cutting edge and consistent brew pub I have ever seen."
"Heat maintains, but it's the unique flavor and combination of spice that draws me in. Medium bodied, long finish. Delightful."
"The beer is smooth and wonderful, and really feels great in the mouth, but the pepper limits how many of these I might want in a sitting... to probably about four or five ;)"
"Overall a very unique but difficult to drink rye beer."
"Drinkability, for me is mediocre. I might have it again if the mood strikes but won't rush out to grab another one."
"Pours a dark brownish amber with a decent off-white head that hung around for quite a while and left very good lacing. The smell is all rye and spices, mainly pepper, on top of a caramel malt background. It definitely stings the nose a little bit. Speaking of stinging, they're not kidding around with the peppercorn. The rye and caramel malts are present but the peppercorn completely burns the tongue on the finish. I've never tasted anything like it. The mouthfeel is creamy and medium bodied with decent carbonation, but the spices are more dominant than any beer I've ever tasted. This is certainly a unique beer and one that I enjoyed trying, but the drinkability is limited a bit by the overpowering pepper."
"Pours a deep red-brown, as you would expect a sweetish rye beer to pour. Head fades quickly. Malty sweet nose. Also malty sweet in the flavor, but not cloying. This beer shines in the mouthfeel and in the long, spicy aftertaste. It doesn't hit you at first, but then, after a few sips: BAM, spicy and peppery as hell. It's hard to distinguish rye from pepper, but I can tell there is a good harmony going on here. A really interesting beer."
"D : This is an interesting beer. I'm not sure it's one that I'd drink a lot of but if paired with the right food, it could work well."
"If this beer weren't so expensive, I'd buy as much as I could find. Truly unique, great stuff."
"D: such a unique flavor. Rye with pepper is different and enjoyable. One of these is all I can do though."
"Purchased a single twleve ounce bottle of this at Bauer Wine and Spirits on Newbury Street. Thanks to the beer guy, Josh, for pulling a bottle of this out of the back for me. Poured in to a Stella chalice a dark copper, and a small bit of white head. Smell starts off interesting, with notes of ginger, cinnamon and nutmeg, sugar seems prevalent in places, and a nice cola as well. Taste has white pepper, more ginger and cola, and also just a slight hint of chocolate. Mouthfeel is nice and spicy, and goes down in a way that is similar to ginger beer in that it gives you a minor burning sensation in the back of your throat. Given a different season, I think I might want to have a few of these, but it didn't seem all that drinkable for a hot day like today. It actually reminds me more of a spiced beer or Winter Warmer than a Rye beer. Brasserie Dieu Du Ciel still deserve points for creating an interesting conversation beer. Worth a try if you see it. Cheers"
"Overall: A very well crafted beer that is tastefully executed and a pleasure to drink. If you can find it buy it and try it for the experience."
"Pours a fogged amber brown with a crème head. The flavor has quite a bit of pepper influencing things. At first it seems not so abrasive, but it really builds up over time. Eventually there is a pretty constant burn going on in the mouth. It causes the feel to be impacted by it as well. By the end, the carbonation (and not much else) is un-noticeable from the pepper burn. This beer shouldn't be enjoyed on its own. Pair it with a steak I say."
"I love it! A steak would go great with this one!"
"a beer like no other, very weird but every sip gets more interesting. oddly refreshing and extremely memorable. would be absolutely amazing with a honey baked ham, thanksgiving dinner, or big fat juicy steak"
"The beer has a murky dark copper color with a tickish spitty head. The aroma is a peppercorn cracker, strong pepper smells mixed with biscuit malt. The taste is literally pepper-like, it burns your lips and throat with each sip. It's hard to get much rye out of this beer, just pepper. It gets a bit much really, I guess it's original in its way but not my thing."
"D- The subtle depth of the malt is a bit overpowered by the peppercorn heat, and I could actually feel myself exhale peppercorn breath. This was interesting and not really offensive but it needed some support. I think this would be a great beer to match with a big juicy steak."
"D: What a different and interesting beer. Certainly not for everyone's taste, but this would would be an excellent compliment to a spicy pepperoni, basil, and garlic pizza with crushed red pepper!"
"Pours a pale amber/orange that is rather cloudy with a 1/8 inch off white slightly tan head. The smell of piney hops is offset by the aroma of spice. First taste is bitter and peppery with the peppercorns really meshing well with the rye malts. The hops are strong enough but fortunately do not overpower the pepper and rye. Mouthfeel is amazingly creamy - especially considering the low ABV of 5%. If you love peppers, this is one great beer. I love peppers. This would be a joy to have with a pepperoni pizza."
"The beer poured from the bottle a deep, slightly cloudy amber brown, with a delicate foamy head that released a wonderful hop-laden scent. The glass was raised and the beer tasted. It was at first rich malt with a nice hop bite--a sort of wonderful bitterness--that lingered on the tongue... and got stronger and stronger until the ""bite"" turned to a burn that never ended. The pepper had kicked in. I love trying new things. And I really enjoyed this beer... until I realized I couldn't turn off the searing pain in my mouth and throat. A few swallows of a nice German dunkel finally stopped the pain. But I just can't see myself drinking this one again."
"Pours a hazelnut brown with a fluffy two finger just-off-white head. Not much scent coming off this, sweet and a little nutty. Biscuity malt, some slight belgian yeasty notes, a touch of caram... wait, it's turning a bit sour as it twsits into rye. Soon the pepper pipes up and could initially be mistaken for a hop bite, but then dials the spiciness to 11. The pepper is pretty intense but not searing, mellowed by a bit some floral hoppy notes. This coats the mouth nicely, though I can't feel it dissipate as my tongue is still being pricked by little peppery devils. After a while, this gets a little rough but its an impressive little show of brewing creativity - so boldly spiced but still pretty drinkable. Good craftsmanship that pushes just to the edge of pallate overload. Another nice one from this brewery."
"If you're looking for something different without going extreme, seek this beer out. It's original and not over the top."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good steady carbonation that makes it almost seem creamy. I'm enjoying taking my time with this one and all of the flavors it contains. Overall, I couldn't drink too much in a sitting, maybe one more, but I really enjoy pepper beers and this one is a great example. I hope I can get more of this again sometime!!"
"12oz single bottle purchased for $2.49 from somewhere in Montreal - that ""King of Beers"" depanneur near the brewpub, I think. Pours a dark ruby red with little head. Not much aroma to speak of. First taste is tangy and spicy - and definitely a pepper bite going down the throat. It is difficult to discern any particular flavours while it's in the mouth - but there is an unmistakable, and unpleasant, pepperness going down the throat. I think I need another beer to have along with this in order to wash it down. I gotta say I'm surprised at some of DDC's choices of beers to bottle."
"Interesting stuff, worth a try, but certainly not the best Rye beer I've encountered..."
"The beer was picked up in a 330 ml. bottle, and was poured into a pint glass. The pou looked amber to orange-brown in color and the head was two finger thick. The smell was quite malty with sweet maple syrup aromas. The taste was malty up front with the spicy sweet rye grains quite apparent, some honey showed up in the middle, while the finish was pure peppercorns. I love all of these flavors so it worked for me wonderfully. The aftertaste lingered on for eternity. The body seemed sticky and creamy. This was a rare find, a beer that pushes the envelope, but still remains very drinkable."
"Pours a reddish amber with a nice initial head that fades to a swirly cap. Smells somewhat fruity and with a bit of grain and a dry malt background, but quite light. The taste is far more bold and interesting! I really like this beer. Big cherry fruit flavors, some nice rye fruity/spiciness, and big, big clean tasting peppercorn flavors. The fruitiness of the peppercorns has really been preserved, and although this has a definite pepper kick, it is not all heat but lovely fruity and herbal peppercorn flavors that keep this going. A nice aged soft cheese would be lovely with this, the flavors would cut right through the cheese unctuousness. Smooth in the mouth with a very spicy finish. Very, very powerful, and best with food, Can't drink more than one of these."
"Pours a light beige head, but hold perfctly to a thick film of foam. Great bubbling and a bit of lacing. The color is a great rust brown. The arom is a spicey toasted pale malt with herbal hops miced with bready malts. The taste really gives you a double whammy, wait make that triple wammy. The peppercorns, the rye, and the herbal hops. Spicey yet very balanced between the bitter rye and spicey yet a elegantly subdued peppercorns. I love how the peppercorns leave a little tingle in the back of my throat. Very comlex beer, one that needs some thought and caring attention."
"Iam starting to see a few of these peppercorn and or chile beers more around.This poured into a large tumbler a clear dark rust color with a large blooming almond colored head that left a smattering of lace behind as it settled slowly,the pepper is more faint in the aroma its mostly dominated by vanilla caramel,and biscuit with a tinge of hard water as well.Flavors up front are somewhat sweet with caramel and sweet biscuit mainly the peppercorns are more of a back of the throat hit and a late burn.Its pretty good but I think the peppercorns can be a bit much after drinking awhile, still something different."
"M/D: About an average mouthfeel. Drinkability is so-so. An interesting beer but just a little too much. Almost like a chille beer with the heat."
"D- Same as above. But I'm still thinking it would be good with steak."
"Slightly hazy orange amber with a fizzy head of light tan. Smells fruity with very light caramel sweetness and toasted grains with rye and distinct peppercorn. Tart aspects of dark fruit in the flavor, with some toasted grains and spicy rye. Lots of fresh green and black pepper spiciness. Unspectacular medium body. Very unique, and probably enjoyable for some. I however found the pepper a bit overwhelming."
"Drinkability: Unique and interesting in its shocking display of peppery punchiness. A beer that begs, along with the drinker, to be paired with food."
"I wasn't going to try another until I thought of the food paring potential. Maybe it's a bad sign that I'm looking for something to offset the taste of this beer???"
"Drinkability is pretty good, I really appreciate it's rich, full flavor and low ABV. This would be great with some cheese, but I'm not in the mood for some now (and ironically have a good amount of Tillamook Black Pepper White Cheddar, which would be overkill). A lingering, nutty finish makes this one worth revisiting, but it's boarderlilne gratuitous with the spices. Combined with the $4.50 price tag means this ones is not going to get much rotation. Probably a good marinade for steak and brie."
" Palate is lightly sweet malt up front for just a second before the spiciness of the peppercorns comes through. A bit of grassy hops picks up before the finish, which leaves a long-lingering peppery spiciness. Body is medium and a touch creamy, with a dry finish that complements the spiciness of the beer nicely. A tasty offering, but I wouldn't want to have more than one in an evening."
"Poured from 11.5oz bottle into standard pint glass (really need some nice glass wear) . Standard pour yielded one finger head with decent lacing . Head diminishes to a thin frothy top. Beer is a nice earthy top soil brown. Complex malt characteristics and pepper are evident in the nose immediately. Taste is initially all malt with virtually no hop character. Very finely carbonated. Pepper corns really come out, and bite the back of your mouth and throat. This doesn't diminish from the beer but rather adds to its unique character. Beer finishes dry with a slight malty sweetness . Over all this is a very unique beer and is probably best consumed in colder months as the pepper corns used in breweng provide a nice warming effect."
"Overall, an interesting brew that was nice to have on this rainy and cold day. Would be nice after a day of snowboarding for it's warming qualities."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"D - The pepper tastes good and is a nice change of pace, but I can't see myself having more than one in an evening."
"Finishes with lingering heat and eventually leaving the back of the tongue somewhat numb."
"Unusual but very enjoyable beer."
"A pint would definitely be enough as the pepper intensity increases with each sip, but I'd love to have a sixer of this in the fridge."
"Je suis quelque peu débutant en terme de dégustation de bière. J'ai ainsi eu de la difficulté à cerner les saveurs du seigle. Peut-être sont-elles un peu trop subtiles?"
"Bottle from Rahman done the street from DDC recently. A corriander like malty brew, other herb tea-like spices,somewhat a biere de garde resemblance. Carmel coats the tongue. Restrained bitterness. Some bubbly head on top of medium dark, spruce beer aroma. Not a bad beer."
"j'avais il y a 5 ans bu une version expérimentale (au pub) de cette bière qui était de l'avis de tous trop poivré"
"Very much worth trying once, it is quite a unique blend of flavours. That being said, I couldn't have more than one of these, as the pepper would be far too much."
"Poured from 12 ounce bottle. Good looking beer. Nice clarity and brown amber colour. Two finger head. Aroma is faint sweetness. Taste- amber ale sweet malt initially and then spice kicks in. Pepper is very pronounced esp on the finish. It warms all the way down. Very unique! Couldnt session this one, and I like pepper. Just too spicy. Glad to try once, but dont think I could handle another for a while."
"Bottle: Poured a deep copper color ale with a big foamy head with some good retention and some lacing. Aroma of pepper is dominating and quite intriguing. Taste is dominated with strong black pepper with a nice touch of rye as well. Body is about average with some good carbonation. This beer is probably a bit too spicy for my taste buds but very innovative; probably not something I would be everyday but might want to try this once in a while."
"Another innovative creative effort By DDC"
"Pours a hazed red/orange hue, small off white head forms, lace spots, head settles to a thin ring. Smell is neat, sweet and malty, sugary, spice, touch of funk, very earthy and peppery, pretty unique. Taste is caramel maltiness, fruits, more earth, spicy pepper finish, really lingers. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, very peppery. Pretty cool, the pepper is done perfectly, very harmonious, great ale!"
"First of all, the « Route des Épices » I drank tonight was (I think) brewed with totally new ingredients (rye most of it !) ! Because of that, I have to tell that this beer was smoothier than usual. Pepper smell very sweet. Nice red-brown color but nothing outstanding here. On the tongue, I have to say that it was very creamy. Firm malt backbone and pleasant white and black peppers on the tongue. I think it would be great with a bloody steak. Even if I think that this beer used to be more powerful, I still think that it is a good pick!"
"When this beer ages, the spiciness will probably also get less. Maybe a beer to keep in stock and age for a while."
"A great original beer for the winter time as it warms you."
"I gave this Beer a slightly below average 2.5 for drinkability, because in most cases, half a pint is enough to satisfy your curiosity, and I'm pretty sure no one orders more than one pint of this per evening. However, in a different context, say in the dead of winter, or to complement Thai or Szechuan food, I'd gladly have more than one."
"I'd definitely put this in the Spiced category though.. and it should be spelled ""Épices"" rather than Espices"
" A spicey long finish that awoke my sense but didn't overpower my taste buds!"
