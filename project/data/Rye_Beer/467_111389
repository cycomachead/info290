3.81,1.3,4.25,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"Overall: An interesting brew - Nicely balanced and goes well with food. However, it didn't make a very strong impression. I thought of it very much as a Rye EPA - besides the rye it seemed very similar to Summit's standard pale ale.","maedhros09","Mar 01, 2015"

3.94,4.8,4,3.75,4,4,4,"Summit's "Frost Line" delivers a rich, darkly caramelish and malty ale with a fairly distinct note of spicy rye, and some gently citrusy hops in the background. It's not particularly strong as a winter ale at just 5.8% abv., but it also follows on the heels of their standard "Winter Ale" at a slightly more respectable 6.2%, so that kind of makes sense; and it's full-flavored, and satisfying enough that it's name shouldn't need to be questioned once tasted. A solid bitterness backs it to the point that it's bitter and dry while still allowing the malt to stand out with just an edge of sweetness which is blanketed by a light cloak of floral and mildly citrusy hops, and then ultimately balanced and livened by the spiciness of the rye. Nicely done!","NeroFiddled","Feb 23, 2015"
3.54,-5.9,3.75,4,3.5,3,3.25,"Dark amber, 1 inch slightly off-white head. Dissipates fairly slowly with some lacing.  Odor is very good, a bit grassy, with subtle spice. Relatively highly carbonated. Bitter hoppy initial taste and bitter aftertaste. This is quite a bitter beer - a spicy bitter, but still bitter. Substantial mouth feel, with a difficult to describe malt foundation behind the  spicy bitterness.","MNAle","Feb 20, 2015"

I love rye, and a lot of the better rye beers out there seem to bring a certain amount of citrus into the mix, which I'm fine with.

Maybe the way the brewer used the Summit hops in this beer did not suit my tastes. Still a lot of impressive rye flavor to be had.","morimech","Jan 31, 2014"

4.05,7.7,5,3.75,4,4.5,4,"pours deep copperish red color with a 1 inch off white head, the smell has strong spicy notes of rye and some mild hops and maltiness but then also has a sort of off putting aroma that I cant place (like earthy smokey...?), odd I hope that doesn't come out in the flavor. ooooh this is great! the rye is definitely in the fore front of this one, very much balanced out with the hops and malt. has a good mouth feel, medium carbonation and pleasant but somewhat strong after taste. good job summit, I wished they released beers like this more often, too bad its only seasonal and not new to the line up. best summit beer released since saga!","Beerlover","Jan 29, 2014"
