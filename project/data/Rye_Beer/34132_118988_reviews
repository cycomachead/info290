"Dark amber in color with streaks of lacing and a solid, frothy white head that stays strong all the way to the end.  Smells strong of bitter hops, pine, resin and earth tones.  Taste is quite flavorful of pine, earth, hops, and rye.  Pretty smooth and medium bodied with a pleasant mouthfeel and not too bitter of an aftertaste.  Overall, a very fantastic rye ale that I will seek out again."

"O: Really nice use of rye, which can overwhelm a beer sometimes.  This is a more subtle application of the ingredient than I've tasted generally.  Surprised that I enjoyed this more than the IPA."

"I couldn't find a freshness date anywhere on this bottle.  I'm forced to conclude that it was a little long in the tooth as it was extremely underwhelming and didn't live up to the high ratings that it receives.  Same story with the APA.  I'd like to give them another try."

"Found some of this on a trip home.  Excellent Beer, er, ale!"
"This is an interesting take on a rye ale, and I like it. Rye can be quite a big flavor, and some rye beers attempt to combat this with bigger malt profiles. Here, the rye is very subtle and the malt profile is actually pretty average, balanced with some nice hoppiness. Stoneface apparently really knows what they are doing."

"The rye begins the tasting experience and then there is a boastful earthy and pine bitter bite lingering at the end."

"O - A well-balanced rye ale, which is sometimes a difficult style to do well. They did a good job with this one. I recommend you try it."

"Had some light sweetness leading off, with some caramel present as well. The hopping was solid, with some rindy, resiny notes hitting the palate. Ever present was the rye action, lending a noticeable spicy quality to the proceedings, which lingered nicely. A solid offering.  Prosit!!"

"O-I would say that this is my close second place offering from Stoneface with the IPA being first.This beer is awesome and I hope they bottle it so I can enjoy at home like I do the IPA. Keep going guys you really are doing a great job!"

"Reddish brown color. Earthy spicy pine aroma with bits of bread and caramel to counter. Spicy earthy bite in the flavor with just enough malt to balance. Nice rye beer."

"This is another great brew from Stoneface and their lineup so far has been stellar. I slightly prefer their bigger IPA but this is an awesome rye beer. Looking forward to seeing what else these guys brew."
