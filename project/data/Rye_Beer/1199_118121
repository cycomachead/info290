4.25,3.2,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"O- This is fantastic and the benchmark for me as far as bourbon barrel aged hoppy beers are concerned. The smoother hop profile and spice notes really complement the barrel and really give this beer a sort of pina colada flavor. This is much better that BA Double Trouble (Doom) which was too dank and piney for the barrel aging IMO.","PaulyB83","Jun 01, 2014"
