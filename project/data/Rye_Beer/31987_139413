4.2,8,4,4,4.25,4.5,4.25,"The nose is loaded with hops, a delicious blend of citrus and pine with a certain melon character as well. The rye spiciness lends a certain depth and backbone that most hoppy beers lack. Mildly peachy, mild nectarine character, mild Crenshaw melon and mildly pine like in great balance. The palate opens with a blend of citrus and pine, mandarins, mint, pine and a little stone fruit. This is followed by a rye dominated mid palate  where there's both, flavor and texture. Fullish despite being drying, this aspect really enhances the hop profile, especially the oiliness and resiny character. Carbonation is soft as well, enhancing the feel and texture. A long, mildly bitter drying finish with an excellent blend of flavors - pine, citrus and rye in great balance - makes for an excellent beer. Among the better rye beers I've had.","DefenCorps","Dec 23, 2014"
