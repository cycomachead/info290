"TASTE: Full rye jacket, wood tannin, mild barrel booziness, warming alcohol, raisins, light hopping, rustic, husky, smooth; long malty and woody finish"

"Has a spicy bourbon nose with traces onf rye. Pours brilliant ceep amber to brown with a white finely bubbled head that produces rich lace. The palate is bourbon, anise, vanilla, toffee and rich malt. It is creamy with very finely bubbled carbonation, a medium heavy body and above average carbonation, Very clean and smooth."
""
"Overall: I'm getting more confusion than enjoyment out of this beer. Perhaps I should have expected that when buying a bottle with feathers glued to it. Regardless, I will be cracking a Founders Black Rye instead of finishing this bottle."

"Delicious peppery rye brew with some strength of character from the bourbon barrel. Grainy smell like sour mash before distilling bourbon, but with hops to balance. I enjoyed!"
""
"This beer is super bomb..."
""
"Rye beers are not generally my thing, but this beer managed to turn my head."
"Pretty standard brown ale with a hint of barrel character.  Surprisingly mild for the description and the ABV."

"O-good beer good whiskey taste and a good mixture of rye and hops and whiskey"

"Spicy rye with a hint of maltiness. Light spirit flavor and heat. Decent drinker, but I wanted more body or sweetness to play off the spiciness of this brew."

"A quintessential rye beer. Did i say ""rye"" too much? Rye. Sorry."

"750 ml bottle into snifter, no bottle dating. Pours slightly hazy dark orange/copper color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, vanilla, brown sugar, light nuttiness, raisin, plum, fig, apple, bourbon, oak, herbal, light pepper, and yeast/oak earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, oak barrel, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, brown sugar, vanilla, light nuttiness, raisin, plum, fig, apple, bourbon, oak, herbal, light pepper, and yeast/oak earthiness. Light earthy/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, brown sugar, raisin, plum, fig, apple, bourbon, oak, herbal, light pepper, and yeast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity, balance, and robustness of dark/bready malt, oak barrel, and yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, moderately crisp, and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice English strong ale. All around great complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, oak barrel, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"I really like this beer. Pours amber with a minimal head and sticky lacing. Lots of rye in the nose and in the taste, whisky too - a bit of charred wood and raisins. Dry mouthfeel, from the rye. It's not a rye bomb and it's thinner than I would have expected, but it's complex and fun to drink. Try this if you get a chance. I'm in NC, we hit Against the Grain last year... the brewers couldn't have been cooler. They're doing a great job of it now."

"Overall, this is a nice take on a rye beer aged in rye whiskey barrels."
"really hoping for a big sticky rye wine here, but it just doesnt pan out. this is a slightly yeasty weird maybe bretty pale beer, with minimal rye character and a lot of talk but not much game. my bottle didnt have feathers on it either, which was a real let down, given it still cost basically 20 bucks, absolutely not worth that. a good beer, it just doesnt have much flavor for being a rye barrel aged beer. its pale amber, not well carbonated, and really not smelling or tasting a whole lot like rye, or much of anything for that matter. certainly no off flavors or anything thats an obvious flaw, it just seems to me that a beer with this description ought to have a whole lot more going on. its bland and i have to search for the rye. its too light in body and never really gets going for me. not bad, but really underwhelming for me. if it was ten bucks i would be less pissed. against the grain has yet to really impress me, but they charge an arm and a leg for their stuff. i dont expect it to stick here in colorado if it keeps being this lame."

"O: Very enjoyable rye beer, very smooth, great flavor, mellow and drinkable. Thanks again Pidzik12."

"750 ml bottle. Served in a Great Lakes Brewing chalice, the beer pours a hazy ruby red/brown color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention is good, and there's a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like caramel, rye bread, rye whiskey, and some dark fruit. It tastes like spicy rye, rye whiskey, caramel, dark fruit, wood, and some earthiness. It's mostly a sweet, malty tasting brew, but there's also a good amount of bitterness. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's a bit coating with low/moderate carbonation. I liked this brew, I wouldn't mind picking up a bottle of this again soon. $12.00 a bottle purchased at the brewpub."

"I thought this was okay. Tastes and sort of drinks like a rye whiskey but with a smoother mouthfeel."

"Cloudy bright brown orange in color. Served with a good inch plus if foamy head. Decent retention. Moderate lacing. Aroma is fairly malty with notes of bread, yeast, phenols, and just a touch of alcoholic spice. Taste is similar. Caramel malts, lots of rye, fusel spice. Unfortunately a touch of plastic in the mix as well. Medium bodied. Appropriate carbonation. Mild bitterness slight spice. A decent beer"

"Pours a medium to dark orange amber with a half finger off-white head with good retention and lots of lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, rye whiskey; estery and spicy with a mild rye sourness. Flavor is rye malt, rye whiskey, oak, caramel. Big burst of well integrated malt and barrel flavors, but tapers off rapidly and finishes with more stark mild rye whiskey, almost like rye after sitting in a couple of melted ice cubes. Light residual hints of rye, oak and slight malt. Medium bodied, also seems to start with a mild creaminess, but finishes unexpectedly a bit light in mouth feel. An interesting take on a rye barrelled beer. The initial flavor and mouth feel are quite nice and promising, but it finishes a bit thin and much less flavor intensity. I'd try this again, but not in the quite pricey 750 ml bomber. Interesting, flavorful, but unbalanced taste sequence. The bottle is very cool but leaves feathers everywhere. I can't imagine unpacking a case of these."

"O - Part amber ale, part brown ale with some dark fruit, spiciness, and bourbon presence. The most enjoyable part is the rye spiciness that lingers on the palate, the flavors are a subtle blend. If you enjoy brown ales this may be a good match and worth trying, if you expect a moderately bold, flavorful beer, it's not."

"I appreciate this for its differences from the norm."

"An interesting beers for those that would like an aggressive rye whisky-ed beer."
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel on this was very thin. Little carbonation and a deep amber/brown body. There is almost no nose but I got a minty sort of smell with a hint of oak. The taste was a disappointment. There is no flavor on the front end or mid-palate. There is a nice rye whisky finish on the very back end. The thin body combined with oily mouthfeel and lack of flavor made this one a clear miss for me."

"Overall - High hopes for a beer that's feathered. Didn't live up to the presentation."

"Pours a murky honey orange with a foamy beige head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, toffee, and fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with rye and caramel flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of woody bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some solid aromas and flavors but I am not getting any real barrel presence other than some slight woody aspects."

"O: neat stuff - rye ale aged in rye barrels - has characteristics of amber ales, brown ales, and rye ales - an enjoyable beer, but a bit pricier than I'd usually pay for something of this style (about $17) - but that's just due to my personal tastes prefs."
"O - Meh.... another average beer from ATG. Was really hoping for bursting bourbon, spice, and more vanilla. Its quite hollow. I supposed I was spoiled when my first ATG beer was the De Molen created Bo & Luke. Too many avg to poor beers have come after. Cool bottle - but don't rush out and buy this. That being said, rye flavor is very nice tho. no booziness - ABV is hidden quite well. Must be in that Chiquen."

"Well aged beers of moderate strength and body are a rare comodity. With a rare step outside of the few examples of Gale's and Fuller's, it's nice to see these flavors being revisited by inquisitive brewpubs."
""
"O: This is probably the nicest rye beer I've tried to this point. I think the aging in barrels that previously contained straight rye whiskey adds extra depth and additional layers of flavor to this beer. I hope they bring this one back in the future."
