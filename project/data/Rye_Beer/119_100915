3.57,-12.3,4,3.25,3.5,4,3.75,"This smelled sweet for an ipa with a fair amount of rye spice and a slight minerally character.  The nose as a whole was relatively subdued, everything seemed muted, nothing jumped out.  The taste is well balanced, lots of rye spice, sticky sweet malts, earthy, peppercorns, some grapefruit hop notes, mild lingering bitterness, but still getting the same mineral qualities on the finish.  Mouthfeel resembles a bigger ipa, relatively full bodied, somewhat sticky, good carbonation.  Overall this was good but just didn't hold up to any of the other vermont and Massachusetts ipas consumed that night.","adapt313","Mar 13, 2015"

4.08,0.2,4.5,4,4,4,4.25,"Poured from six pack into a pint glass, pours a slightly opaque orange with a one finger head and lots of lacing as it sits. The aroma is very sweet, more so than most IPAs, smells of Apple and grapefruit mostly with a hint of biscuit? Maybe. The taste is nothing special, very piney at first with a finishing of the rye used. Mouth feel is fine, slightly thinner than I like, and more carbonation. Overall it's a good IPA I really enjoy the aroma. Think I would enjoy it more off a tap. Would have again 4.25/5","anthony23cippy","Mar 03, 2015"

O.C. continues to step up their hop game and is becoming a force with a expanding portfolio of sought after hoppy beers. This is very good, six pack worthy, and the rye factor is something to be reckoned with. 6.5% abv% and drinks fairly big.","beerthulhu","Feb 21, 2015"

As a self-described hop head I'd begun to wonder whether anything under 8% would satisfy my admittedly overwrought taste buds. But at ""only"" 6.5% this delivers loads of flavor. I'd love to regale you with all the flavor nuances but I'll leave that to the folks who can actually wax poetic about that stuff.

Some grassy pine needle, spruce tip and sticky resinous oils countered by prominent fruit sweetness and pale biscuit malt. The juicy tropical and citrus fruit notes really stand out with hints of juicy grapefruit, mango, pineapple, curaçao and blood orange. The sweet clementine, naval orange and tangerine notes are strongest providing the hop profile with delicious flavor. Perfectly balanced by a pale malt backbone with hints of biscuit, cracker, a touch of spicy rye and subtle caramel sweetness. This beer could use a little more earthy bitterness but is otherwise an excellently balanced, flavorful beer that is dangerously drinkable.","corby112","Jan 11, 2014"

Thin wisps of lacing sporadically coat the sides of the glass as the brew is consumed. Nose expresses aromas of rye and light, fruity esters. Taste consistent with nose - earthy, with the addition of some more clearly identifiable citrus notes and some medicinal/piny bitterness at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium (but closer to light) with an assertive carbonation that borders on being prickly and a pleasant acidity that lightly stimulates the salivary glands.

Aromas of citrus forward, with orange and tangerine, and a solid caramel backbone, with a rich and bitter toasted grain highlight throughout. Smells great. Flavors of tangy sweet and bitter forward, well blended, with a spicy profile or pepper, oregano, and cedar notes. Good citrus blend, providing tart notes throughout. The body is light, and slightly effervesced at the end. The aftertaste is rich sweet undertones with spicy hops overlay. Frothy, effervesced finish, with a bitter and slightly dry linger.

A wave of hops, big bitterness, lacks cohesiveness with a malt profile a bit of spicy rye in the backend, but more or less a wave of hops and finishes with bitter resins and dry yeast notes. Bottled 10/28/13 they have a bit of time on them but I think these bottles are just a bit over the top with dry hop bitterness, lacks malt sweetness, and balance. There is the spicy rye grassiness that only adds to the earthy bitterness and vegetal garlic/onion notes I'm getting it's like chewing on an everything bagel at this point. Mouthfeel completely drying bitterness, my mouth is a desert, waves of lingering bitterness ample soft carbonation resinous medium bodied ale.

3.32,-18.4,3.5,3.25,3.25,3.25,3.5,"cloudy orange color with a nice sized white head, about a finger upon pouring into the glass. the head lingered as a small white ring on the top of the beer in the glass. It has a light citrus almost orange scent to it. As the amount of beer in the glass lessened the scent turned to more of an orange than at the beginning. Started out with a little bit of a hoppy bitterness that quickly faded. Very light feeling beer, almost as light as a session IPA. This is a light IPA that would be decent for a nice summer day, and at only 6% would be fine. Its a little too light for me and the hoppy kick that is common in most American IPAs is not very pronounced in this. Decent beer to try, but I will not be buying another six pack of it for a little while.","timmy2b","Nov 13, 2013"

3.9,-4.2,4,4,3.75,4,4,"Poured a golden body with good head that left a little lace. Strong floral hop aroma and you can pick up touches of sweet caramel malt and rye. The hops and carbonation give the beer an overall dryer, sharper feel, but the sweetness and the rye offer great balance so the beer is never cutting and easily passes over the tongue. Straddles the line between hoppy ale for the hop heads and milder ale for those who aren't IPA fans. Overall, a really good beer (nuff said).","clayrock81","Nov 08, 2013"

In general I am not much of a fan of Rye IPA's, but this is certainly an exception. Citrusy, fruity, spicy, rye malt and bitters come together in a way that I have never experienced in a Rye IPA before. For one who had little faith in OCB, I am now willing to try out some of Mikes new brews- I honestly wonder if Sean Lawson didn't rub off on him in the best way? Certainly worth trying if you like Rye IPA's and if you are not a fan of RIPA's as I generally am, then I strongly suggest you rethink whats possible in the style.","80x2HopHead","Nov 03, 2013"

The rye steps it up in the flavor, with the hops keeping things piney bitter throughout and beyond. Nice medium body and fine carbonation in this nicely priced beer.

4.21,3.4,3,5,4,4.25,4,"I employed an aggro pour to get things rolling and was met with two fluffy fingers of tawny head that soon fell away to nothingness, leaving some sticky lacing in its wake. I leaned in for a whiff and it smelled like wake 'n' bake time, man. Total dank! Phew! Color was a hazy, almost cloudy, orangish-amber, going to show that even a fairly fresh IPA can quickly devolve. Or perhaps it was unfiltered, but either way, I was ready to partake. Jeez, Louise, every time that I brought it near my nose, I could have sworn that somebody was letting me sniff a baggie of their freshly-harvested, basement-grown stash. Man, I am going to drink half of this and then put the other half in a water pipe. Please note that I am VERY careful not to mention any terms that might bring Homeland Security or other unwanted fuzz-types to my pad, man. I try to maintain a mellow environment here at Chez Woody, dig? Chill is the watchword, man. Mouthfeel was surprisingly big, like a dollop of that special caramel The Old Lady whipped up during my visit to CANorado, man. It was also kind of mellow, the hops not choosing to be confrontational, but more like ""Hey, man, how are you? Let us do you a solid, man."" Far out! I passed it to Chong and he nodded in agreement, or maybe he was just nodding off. Man, that dude really knows how and where to score the really good, ahem, hops. The wild light show going on in the sky through the windshield was mind-blowing and as kind as they were to have given me a ride, I had them drop me off at this crazy kitty's house so we could engage in some extracurricular activities. Hey, man, The Woodman does not live by or with The Old Lady alone and she does her own thing in CANorado while I do my thing here in PA. The finish was cool and minty, dosed with rye, man, and kitty cat thought that I had used mouthwash when I punched her in the mouth with my lips. May I have another hit of this one, please?","woodychandler","Nov 02, 2013"
