"I don't know if I got an old bottle or something but this tastes pretty much like a malt Bomb. It also feels flat and nothing like a rye ipa"
""
""
"Top of the line IPA, this one and black markets liberation IPA are fantastic.  this one exceeded my expectations.  give this one a try and if your in the area of Temecula check out this brewery."

"Overall, this is solid, but nothing special."

"Mouthfeel is light, dry. Overall, not terribly impressed, but not sad about the beer either."
""
""
""
"Notes: A totally run of the mill IPA. It does a perfect job of being perfectly ""normal"". That is what makes it boring."

"Pour is a heavily hazed copper with a red hue and a right tan head. Nose has a strong rye spice to it, malt up front, caramel and grain. Hops are citrusy with a bit of pine and slightly stale. Taste is a bit more fresh, not as spicy or malt forward. Much more balanced, citrusy and piney with a light hop resin. Finish is where the rye spice comes in with a light bitterness and mildly carbonated medium body."

"22oz bottle clumsily poured into pint glass. Huge amber head tops hazy orange brew. Hello, lacing. Ample aroma of unmalted rye and citrusy hops. Flavor is bold and dry with a solid rye kick. Mouthfeel is a little on the syrupy side, and the finish is not the most crisp. Still this beer is a great example of why Rye and IPA is a killer combination."

"Poured into a Chuckanut pint glass. Pours a medium bronze amber with a half finger white head with good retention and lacing. Nice caramel malt with piney and citrus hops and light rye. Flavor follows aroma with a good caramel malt supporting bright citrus and piney hops. Light grapefruit and a hint of spicy rye. Good mouth feel with a medium body with pleasant creaminess, more than expected from an IPA. A tasty rye IPA with well selected hops supported by a substantial malt body and a good touch of rye, all well balanced. Enjoyable."
"Pretty looking beer, leaves nice lacing though the excessive foaming upon the pour was a concern. Aroma gave no indication of anything off but really this beer is sloppy, earthy and an alpha acids swamp. I was always on the fence about Black Market, this beer is strike two."

"Glancing at the reviews, I have to believe I got a bum bottle, since this seems like a beer that's right in my wheelhouse; but roaring carbonation is never a good sign. This bottle, however, is dismal."

"Satisfying IPA in general. It's in a very competitive market being just north of San Diego, so it may get lost in the shuffle."

"B/B+"
"Very nice Rye IPA that everyone should try out."
"Flavors Carmel malt citrus and light pine hops. finish with a hint of spice. Bottle was almost the same except a little more hops to my Taste"
"Great beer. Not over the top, and is more of what I think what an IPA should be"
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. Great rye flavor with good overall balance and a nice hop profile."
"PS- some of my other favorite ""go to"" IPA's include Pliney the Elder, Racer 5 and Green Flash. This IPA fits perfectly (IMO) with the above mentioned."
"I would definitely drink it again, and if I lived in the area, this would be my go-to local IPA for sure. The DIPA was good as well."

"D: A nice easy summer drink with the delicate orange and floral character served up over a nice light body. Probably not going to seek out again anytime soon but I did enjoy and would have again. As a former Temecula native I would rally for these guys to come up with something a bit more impressive."
""
"Pours a hazy honey orange with a foamy orange-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Thin rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, rye, and some herbal hop aromas. Taste is of malt, rye, citrus fruit, and citrus zest. There is a mild hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is pretty tasty and drinkable."
""
""
"D - Not bad. Probably won't try again."

"C"
"Quite a pleasant big hoppy beer. One of my favorite breweries in the southern end of SoCal for interesting and well-made beers. Also worth trying on tap if you're in Temecula; seems to be one of the regulars."

"Very hoppy, almost a tad to much."

"Overall; this is a great IPA that I enjoy quite a bit... I am not the biggest fan of IPA's although that has been changing a bit lately... I'll revisit this at some point as my tastes continue to change, by as it stands now, this is a very solid IPA that I wouldn't hesitate to drink when the mood strikes."

"Drink- Another good local beer. This is my wheelhouse a balanced ipa with nice hops and some good citrus. Would like a growler of this for a saturday night!"
"O: I really enjoy this beer and can't wait till they bottle it."
"O: Another good beer in the growing trend of hoppy rye beers."
"O: Well balanced. Not an extreme IPA, or Rye beer, kind of in the middle, which I think is what they were going for. I'm kind of surprised by some of the reviews so far of this beer given how it was judged at GABF. Granted it was not a killer/whale Rye beer, or IPA, but it was good. Maybe something happened at the bars they were served at (Dirty lines, something in transit, bad batch, not sure)"
"Overall: I hate to trash a beer from a small brewery with few reviews, but this is one to avoid."
"I put this on tap (Hoffer's) and it lasted just a few days. The viscosity of this citrus heavy brew was like molasses. I couldn't believe how thick and syrupy this came out of the faucet. Very difficult to create any kind of head on this beer but weirdly enough, tons of lacing were left on the glass. Amazing citrus and hop overwhelms the nose on the initial gulp. Mouth feel lingers on the tongue and the roof of your mouth. Although really thick and hop heavy, this RYE IPA was incredibly easy to drink and had just the right amount of carbonation. I don't think this beer will be for those expecting a large amount of actual rye flavor. The flavor of the hops almost completely over powers it, but if you're looking for a damn good IPA with just a touch of RYE then I would highly suggest this one."
"Taste, lacked hops. Its an ipa man! Couldn't really detect a rye bill to this, based on the taste, I thought it must be low. Tasted more like a brown ale with higher alcohol. To call this a rye ipa, just seemed like it was missing the most basic premise of what a rye ipa tastes like, hops and that rye spice. Neither were here."
