"I do love my rye -- just not in beer. Or maybe this needed a bit more hops to balance out the flavors."
""
"This is quality stuff for the price and availability. I was craving a rye ale and this one hit the spot for the most part. It has the rye spiciness that I was looking for without any extra sweetness. I sometimes think that an extra hop kick could make it even better, but, overall, it's a good and sessionable rye beer."

"Love all the beers from this brewery, have not had a bad tasting beer yet. finally got to try this one and was very surprised how good it was. Out of the 12oz releases from the Speakeasy brewery this might be my favorite.  give this beer and any other beer from this brewery a try.  if you're ever in the San Francisco area this is a really cool brewery to visit, excellent vibe and friends service."

"Taste is nice lightly sweet juiciness with very light balancing bitterness, with leafy citrus, hints of toasty bread, finish of earth and light spicy rye bread.  It's very drinkable."

"smooth and a nice flavor. A good taste not hoppy"

"O: Quite impressive, though I would expect no less from Speakeasy. I haven't had a lot of brews in this category, but I imagine this will satisfy any malt-forward, toasty and drinkable beer cravings you might have. Cheers!"

"The bitterness subsides after a few sips and mostly a rye malty taste stays through to the finish."

"Enjoyable brew, a bit one dimensional and could have a more intense aroma, but it is very well balanced and even sessionable."

"O - A good rye beer. Slightly uncommon for me, but I liked it."

"O - Not bad, it's not a favorite in the rye world."

"a well made beer, but not my palate here. there is too much malty sweetness in this one for the rye to really have much of its usual spice impact, and instead we are left with a rather heavy red amber beer without a ton of flavor. looks nice though, clear dark copper in color with over an inch of tan head. it smells grainy and sweet, and the taste matches. i dont get much hops at all from either, and the rye is just way too subtle for me, but admittedly i like to taste rye when its in the grain bill. lots of body, lots of residual sugar. it could use some bottle conditioning or something to clean it up a bit, but its well carbonated and suitable for cooler early spring days. probably the least impressive speakeasy brew i have had to date, but still far from a poor showing."

"Overall, this isn't a beer that I particularly like, but it was interesting. The appearance of the beer is great but ultimately fell short of my expectations."
""
"O - really enjoyed this one. Very unique flavors and well crafted. I like what I've had from this brewery so far & I look forward to venturing more of their stuff."
"This is a good solid beer but really didn't notice any rye."
""
"12oz bottle from a friend who warned me that this was awful. He was not kidding. Looked fine, amber, good head. Smelled like the most awful malts. Flavor was dirty and like soggy stale cereal. This was a really bad beer, not sure what happened with this one but I won't be buying it."

"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a dark mahogany brown with a half finger tan head with good retention and light lacing. Mild, but classic red ale aroma of slightly toasted caramel malt with light grassy hops, supplemented by rye bread notes. Flavor is toasted and caramel malt, grassy hops with light sourness and rye grain. Medium bodied with nice carbonation. A nice red ale that is somewhat light on the rye, but fairly well balanced. Lots of flavor for its ABV."
""
"Overall- Pretty much just average. Not horrible; just has some weird off-tastes that aren't bad but just don't fit. You're not missing much if you don't try it, that's for sure."
""
""
"Solid choice with robust roasted vegetables, tougher and less flavorful meats."

"The Scarlett pours as beautiful as the girl on the label. The beer was a deep rich clear amber with white head that is leaving a nice lace. The scent was very malty. The taste was ok....started very nice then a weird stringent funk piled on leaving me to scratch my head. Does not come off the pallet as nice as other ryes. The mouthfeel was medium in body with good carbonation. Overall this beer is ok....not sure I'd run out to buy it."

"An enjoyable red rye ale."
""

"Poured a reddish brown and had nice head retention and lace. A rather light, nondescript aroma for a rye beer as I get a little bit of roasted and sweet malts, along with citric hops and rye, but nothing really going on here and it's a little odd. Smooth, easy to drink, this isn't a bad beer in my opinion but it just seems to misfire. The rye gives it a little dryness and heartyness, and the sweet malts and hops are in there and balanced but as I finished my glass it was more grainy and harsh than anything resembling sweetness or hoppiness. A good beer but not one of the greats."

"Pours crimson reddish brown with virtually no foam on top. Just a smattering of white. Toffee rye nose, subtle sweetness. Pleasing. Rich malty taste with a rye hop bitter in the middle that rolls into sweet finish. Nice bite. Solid mouthfeel. Everything really works together for a tasty end result."

"The flavor is on the mild side with an odd sweet sensation. Sort of grainy with an interesting resiny tang that may be the rye. Otherwise not much sense of the often spicy and dry rye-ness. Not much in the way of hops, though there is a pleasant bitterish aftertaste. A hint of something like cardboard that is less pleasant. Still, this grows on you after sipping through the 12 oz. Maybe this would be a good quaff. I'll try it more chilled next time. From the six-pack bought at Beach Front Liquor in San Clemente."
"O- Slightly above average. I've had better and worse examples of the style. Not complaining though. Drinkable and a good example."

"O: An average rye ale. Probably wouldn't drink it again, but not bad."

"Overall this isn't really that bad, and it's easy drinking. Just a little bit more oomph and depth and this would really hit the spot."
"overall, it's a decent brew. leans to the hop side. low abv. nice color. i get the malt balance in it and i am still learning my rye. could easily drink another, even though it's not my preferred style."

"Very good. A limited release, this hoppy rye has great balance and smoothness. Complex and subtle, this is helping me become a big fan of the Speakeasy Brewing."
""
"This poured out as a brown color until I held it up to the sunlight and saw its nice deep red hue. The head was a cream color with a decent retention and very thin lacing. The smell of the beer is toasted with a touch of earthy hops and malt sweetness. The taste also gave off a big toasted flavor upfront with some subtle chocolate notes as well. The finish of the beer was bitter with some caramel in the mix as well. The mouthfeel of the beer is medium bodied, it's got a dry finish with a good carbonation. Overall it's a pretty solid brew."
""

"Overall: A pretty flavorful session beer. I wish the rye had a bigger role in this beer and I also feel that the carbonation is too high for this ale. If the carbonation was dialed back a bit, I think the malt and hops would have a much bigger playing field to interact with each other on. It definitely is a good session beer to have while watching the game with some friends."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is thin and watery, with mild carbonation, a light body, and a slightly bitter finish that fades clean with rye trailing and making its mark. The aftertaste is clean, yet funky like cardboard, so this has some different qualities to it. Overall this was much better than I expected and quite easy to drink; borders on a session beer for me. This lady is legit and one I will seek out again."
""

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was its refreshment and coolness on the sip. This was definitely darker in style for a rye beer, with generous attention given to the malty backbone. The flavoring, however, was washed to the buds, and you actually lose a lot of the rye, and sweetness of malt. There was interesting phenolic bitterness, which helped to keep you interested, but really not enough when coupled with the lighter nose to make you refill your glass with the same. This all eases up with heat, making it more refreshing, but again, it is not enough."
"Overall a tasty and well balanced rye ale."
""
""
"Overall - Somewhat disappointed, if only because I've been so impressed with Speakeasy beers in the past. This one's not bad by any stretch, but if you're looking for a beer with strong rye character, you might want to look elsewhere. Not a bad beer, but doesn't necessarily deliver on the promise of the label."
"This beer is definitely the younger/lighter sibling of their imperial red ale. I think this version works more effectively—I love rye ales, red ales, and at this ABV I could have more than one. Whether in a bomber or sixer I’d love to see this on shelves as well. A winner."

"Clear, amber/ red ale with sticky white head that barely covers the top. Lots of copper caramel malt aroma with some chalky chocolate. A little bit of weedy, green, wet hops with a swirl. Taste starts with roasty chocolate and coffee. Not too bitter, but smooths out the drink towards the end. A little bit of metallic/blood flavor in the middle for good measure. Spiciness of rye is there, but barely noticeable. Handled the grain well IMHO. Dry finish, balanced MF. This reminds me of an unimperial version of Betrayal. Very good and sessionable. Would be good in the fall with these flavors. I wish they released this in six packs."
""
"Overall I would like to try this bottled actually, I'm wondering if less of the hoppy notes would come through, as well as if the carbonation makes a difference. A decent rye beer, which is great since the rye selection is small."
"Pours a clear copper with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Thick foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, rye, caramel, and herbal hop aromas. Taste is much the same with a slight toast/roast flavor and an alcohol kick with each sip. There is a mild roasty and hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
