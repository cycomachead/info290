Taste is malty with less sharpness from the herbal hops than many others of this style but well balanced. Mouthfeel is light to medium with a semi dry finish. Carbonation is just enough.

This is beer as beer should be, not that watery American adjunct lagers that we all have to drink from time to time.   Having said that, I would not drink this as my lawnmower beer.

I've got a great local option of Czech pilsner from raleigh brewing, and when I saw this one at the store I figured why not give it a try.  Not bad, could be better, and I expect it would be if it were fresher (aka in Prague instead of being shipped here).  I think I'll stick with my local option, but a good try.","cottonkoozie","Aug 19, 2014"

LOTS of lacing is seen with each sip, close to rings actually. Very surprised! The aroma is mostly of malts with a hint of floral. Not 'skunky' really as most of the brews that come in a green bottle for some reason. Perfect carbonation. More going on with the taste with the malts, grains, breaddy yeast with a sweet crisp dry finish. More drinking of the brew brings out a light floral taste mixed in there as well. Overall, a decent brew.","BeerWithMike","Jul 14, 2014"

Bready and caramel malt aromas are dominant with faint herbal hop and buttery notes. Medium bodied with a slightly oily feel up front followed by a light tangy feel through the middle. Burnt caramel and bready malt flavors up front followed by light herbal hop flavors that try very hard to produce a crisp snap that this style is known for, but it falls a bit short. Finishes with bready, caramel malt aftertaste.","IronLover","Jul 08, 2014"

Bright golden crystal clear color with an eggshell white head forming thick and billowing above the sides of my glass, visually very appealling so far. Aroma has some sweet bready grains with herbal slightly skunked hops, pleasant lime/grassy notes from the noble Saaz. Flavor has a muted malt sweetness with a tart/bitter zing from the hops almost with a lime zest note to it. Mouthfeel is crsip finishes nice and dry with residual bready malts left on the palate not a bad beer whatsoever. Not the best pils I have ever had but up there with some of the imported versions very drinkable the 16.9 ounce bottles don't last very long the type of beer that I'm sure appeals to the masses in Praha.

Aroma is rich malted barley and floral-spicy noble hops with traces of diacetyl. The malt-aroma is somewhat biscuity, toast-like, with almost melanoidin qualities which probably results from decoction mashing. The beer is crispy yet smooth on the palate, medium bodied with tongue-coating diacetyl that enhances the perception of body giving it additional fullness. The complex pale malt is counterbalanced by prominent yet soft, well rounded, non-lingering bitterness brought in by spicy noble hops. Good one - my impression is that the Czech beers brewed for domestic consumption always differ from their export versions and Staropramen is no exception with its fuller palate and richer mat-character.

I've had this many times before, and will probably return to it again at some point - but if push came to shove, there are several other Czech-style beers (Pilsner Urquell, Golden Pheasant, etc.) that I'd definitely pick first. If you're just a fan of Euro lagers and are looking for a cheap, passable pilsener to slug back, this stuff will get the job done, but serious lager fans will probably find Staropramen to be a fairly forgettable offering.

Pours into a pint with a nice 1-1/2 finger macro-bubble head topping a very bubbly bright orangish yellow brew. Taste is most definitely characteristic of a European pilsener. Almost a straight barley and corn-like taste comes through the beer which a has good body and slight bitterness. Then all of a sudden the the whole taste disappears, leaving a dry and clean aftertaste. This is a great beer to sit in the warm SoFla winter sun and knock back.

Hop bitterness is right out front, and is just about the only flavor going on (the malts have zero presence here). Like the nose, it's truncated, with simple flavors and no depth. Overall, this is a simple beer, certainly very drinkable, with little special character to recommend it. Still, I do imagine it would be a good substitute for Coors Light on a hot summer day. And I mean that in a positive way.","geexploitation","Beers"

Not much of anything expected in a beer, like hops, malt, or even adjuncts. Aftertaste is a bit skunky sour. I'm not sure what it is, but I hate the mouthfeel. It's dry, oily and leaves an unpleasant sensation on the side of the tongues. Not something I would drink again. I could state that if offered for free, I might take it.

The hops kick in from the start, not overwhelming, but ensuring a mildly bitter experience throughout.

Taste did not have as much skunkiness but still had a little. Very light in body. Not much malt here, mostly hops. Slightly bitter, but no overpowering flavor. Finishes crisp and clean. Good for a cheap import.","granger10","Jun 20, 2003"

2.95,-11.7,3,3,3,2.5,3,"This beer pours a normal yellow color with medium white head and minimal lacing on the glass. The aroma is very malty and almost a little sour. The flavor is dry with very apparent hops and a lot of carbonation. Sourness is detectable in the sides of the mouth, but not too much. Very reminiscent of a better Heineken. The finish is moderately dry. I'd have this again probably since it is not very expensive, but it wasn't anything wonderful.","clvand0","Jun 06, 2003"
2.91,-12.9,3.5,2.5,3,3,3,"Drinkablility: I would only drink this beer again if there was nothing else available. Probably wouldn't buy this one again.","Popsinc","May 28, 2003"
3.28,-1.8,4,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Flavor is largely honey and grain with a bit of skunk oil rolling on the tongue. The malt quickly drops to a dry crisp hoppy finish.","drewbage","Beers"
4.47,33.8,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I agree with the Pilsner Urquell comparison with this one.. This one competes with the world class pils. Staropramen is a clear golden beer with a very small and fast disappearing head. The aroma is very inviting with sweet and hoppy tones. And the flavor is just like a czech pilsener should be very easily drinkable with a faint sweetness to start with but then dominated by the very nice hoppy bitterness. 5% ABV.","stoutman","0"
3.23,-3.3,3,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The taste begins with a malty sweet assault and lingers. however it finishes with a slight hoppy bitterness.","Shiloh","Mar 20, 2003"

3.42,2.4,3.5,4,3,3.5,3.5,"Deep reddish-golden color, quite clear with lots of fine bubbles and a small off-white head. Rich aroma of sweet and bready malts with noble hops and - miraculously - no skunk aroma. Taste begins with rather sweet malts and slight carbonation, midway through the taste; spicy hops ride atop the malts. By the end of the taste, the hops leave a harsh and metallic bitterness at the back of the mouth. The mouth feel is smooth and pleasant. Overall, a good lager that might benefit from some tweaking of its hop profile, the aftertaste is excessively bitter.","Pegasus","Feb 09, 2003"
4.03,20.7,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Compared to others I must have not bought a old or skunked bottle. Mine was actually quite fresh tasting. Wonderful fresh and clear Saaz-type hop aroma that faded some with time. Bright, clear and dark gold with full head, good retention and nice lacing. Nicely balanced beer with a little less bitterness that other Czech beers of similar ilk, but enough to make presence known. Hop bite lasts throughout with medium long finish. Good malt backing, providing nice body and some richness. Light to medium body, flatter feel, but adequate carbonation. Good all around and balanced beer.","garymuchow","Jan 13, 2003"
3.5,4.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Taste = light, crisp mouthfeel. Bitter as sin from plenty of hops that hang right in there on the long aftertaste. Quaffable. I'll admit that I'd buy Pilsner Urquell and Czechvar first, but this is pretty good beer and running third place to those two is nothin to be ashamed of.","texascarl","Oct 15, 2002"
3.65,9.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"the beer is extremely smooth with an almost unnoticeable carbonation. the malts dominate the flavor with a little bit of hops in the finish. it has a medium-light body and it is very easy to drink. i would not say it is a remarkable beer, but it is certainly better than average.","ElGuapo","Jun 30, 2002"
2.83,-15.3,3,2.5,3,2.5,3,"Clear pale gold color, big-bubbled white head of 1/2 an inch.  Slightly skunked aroma.  Sweet malty flavor with a decided wet canvas impression that's re-inforced by the aroma.  Slight watery sense before a mild hoppy finish mid-mouth.  Carbonation is medium, perhaps this beer's best quality.  OK in drinkability but nothing special is going on in this brew, some similarities to Heineken et al....","ADR","May 21, 2002"
1.94,-41.9,3,1.5,2,2,2,"Crystal clear dark straw hue topped by a fluffy porcelin - white head.  Skunky mercaptans, sulfur, and rough grain huskiness in aroma.  The sharp, astringent graininess coupled w/ the rough bitterness make this quite rough for a pilsner. Sulfur persists in the flavor and is a bit offputting... All around this beer almost abrasive on the palette. The body is weak and watery, while the malt backbone is seriously lacking.  Finishes w/ an unpleasant tannic astringent note.  I most likely got a poorly handled bottle, but I just don't see myself ever having this again.","marc77","Apr 10, 2002"

3.45,3.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"hazy golden color with a thin head that dies quickly.  saaz hop aroma quickly asserts itself but doesn't overwhelm.  sort of a cross between heineken and pilsener urquell. nothing really great, a little thin in the mouth and little carbonation...seems "dead".  maybe i got an old bottle.","budgood1","Feb 25, 2002"
3.33,-0.3,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Deepstraw gold with a slight clinging lace. Mildly malty grainy, low-key hop aroma. Starts thin to bitter, ending lingering oily hop. Meager malt profile causing balance to tip too far to the hop end. It's drinkable but not worth a search.","inebrius","Jan 23, 2002"
2.76,-17.4,3,2,3,3,3,"Seems to be similar to a Pilsner Urquell, also in a green bottle.  This is from a large brewer and is better than the majors over here, the ABV is 5.2%.","jdhilt","Aug 22, 2001"
3.32,-0.6,4,2,3.5,4,4,"The initial aroma from the 12 oz. bottle was extremely skunky. After pouring, the skunk dissipated a bit. I could then detect some of the beer's true characteristics. Perfect light, effervescent mouthfeel. Nice semi-sweet malt and herbly, spiced hop finish. Unfortunately, some skunk essence still remained. I'll have to seek this one out on tap.","John","Aug 20, 2001"
3.9,16.8,4,4,4,3,4,"The largest brewer in The Czech Republic..why can't A-B or Miller make beer this good...Only average for Czech Rep. but much better than the swill we're used to here...I'm not sure where exactly the old spring that gives the beer its name is.","grdahl","Beers"
4,19.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Very clean and crisp, with moderate hops.  Not bad from the bottle, but on tap is vastly superior.  In the tap version, I sometimes get just the barest hint of spearmint in the finish.  Of course, the pink elephants show up a little while after that.","Brent","0"
