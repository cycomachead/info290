Pours a clear straw yellow with a white head that fizzles down to a thin cap. Tasty Pilsen malt sweetness transitions to Saaz hops bitterness. Good carbonation. Excellent balance. A crisp and refreshing pilsner. Love the low ABV.","loubar","Mar 29, 2015"

A very tasty pilsner with biscuity malt backed up by a noticeable hoppiness. No adjunct flavors coming into play. A solid pilsner, probably the best I've had, leaves me wanting another. This is a really pleasant change from the hop bombs I usually drink and at 4.4% it's pretty sessionable - much better than the so called session brews that everyone seems to be brewing these days.

If not for the fact that I only have half a six-pack left in my fridge, I honestly could go for a third one right now.)  I'd say it's definitely worth the price for the 6 and 12 packs that you can easily find in grocery stores.  At first I was a bit disappointed to not pick up any lemony flavors here like I did in the other pilsner I've tried (Bohemia), but after having a couple more of them I don't think the absence of lemony flavors hurts this too much--there's just so much else going for it (especially the clearly defined biscuit/cracker flavors and the way it feels to drink some when the foam's still hanging around on top.)","Pantalones","Dec 23, 2014"

It doesn't have the best aftertaste but the appearance and crispness of the mouthfeel more than make up for it and like any other hallmark, this is a beer that deserves a go at least once; if nothing more than to expand ones palate.","JerzDevl2000","Nov 15, 2014"

4.11,15.1,4.5,3.5,4.25,4.5,4.25,"BBD 2/17/15.  Pours a clear light amber (golden).  Very good head, lacing and retention.  Mild nose of light biscuit with a touch of Saaz hop aroma and spiciness.  As it warms, the hops come more forward.  Light medium body with a somewhat slick oily texture.  Above normal carbonation with good effervescence on the finish and also in the middle. Very well done and it allows the Saaz hops to really shine in the middle.  The flavor profile is intense for a Pilsner, well balanced and has a bit of complexity.  It begins with a burst of Saaz hop flavor over a light biscuit sweetness.  The middle is Saaz - both in flavor and bitterness over a balanced sweetness.  The finish is quite crisp, a touch dry, and leaves you with a lingering bitterness and a bit of biscuit and spice.  About 30 years ago, I had this fresh on draft and it was World Class.  Over the years, it has suffered in quality, but the brown bottle now helps move it towards its past greatness.","tillmac62","Nov 06, 2014"

Pours perfectly golden yellow with a nice head; perhaps a bit heavy on the carbonation but it does not defray from the mouthfeel. The beer starts with a bit of hop bitterness, transitions to a slightly malty sweetness then transitions yet again to a hop finish The combination of Pilsen malt and Saaz hops provides the perfect balance that is so difficult to achieve in this style. This beer must be poured from the miserable green bottles into a pilsner glass or a standard pint glass to achieve the aromatics and full taste profile. I will keep looking but there may not be a better pils. Thus, the "5" is still to be distributed and the hunt will continue...","Reegze79","Aug 31, 2014"

The Pilsner Urquell has the mouthfeel of a good lager but has extra notes of hops, malt and sweet breads in both the aroma and taste. A refreshing and uncomplicated beer, it ticks all the boxes and gets it right.

I have drank this beer numerous times over the years, but since I found this in cans, i thought I would give this one a review. Its got a bit of that skunk, but that is what you expect from this beer. I was turned on to numerous other beers after trying this one years ago and it proved that there was other and better beers out there beyond what the American big guys were producing. Still among my favorites and the review is probably a bit higher than it should be but its a solid beer and if you can find this four pack of tall boys you should give it a go.

Plain and simple seemingly though it has subtle nuance. Light bodied, crisp and clean. Easy to drink several on a hot day. Much better than the skunky green bottles of yesteryear, hope they phase those out. A simple classic Czech Pilsner.","emerge077","Jun 30, 2014"

Bready malt flavor up front with earthy herbal hop flavors expanding through the middle. Finished cleanly with a delayed dryness along with herbal hop and bready malt aftertaste. Love the 17oz can.

Not sure I would have this out of the green bottle unless I know it's been properly cared for, but the can protects and preserves the beer, preventing skunkiness. A refreshing Czech-style pilsener which I would gladly serve to guests in a party environment who may be used to drinking light American lagers or Euro Pale Lagers (Heineken, Stella, etc.) and a beer that would pair excellently with grilled sausages or pizza.","Beric","Jan 27, 2014"

3.65,2.2,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.75,"I finally tried this archetypal Czech pils/modern descendent of a historical icon at a Calgary pub in the Kensington area (here's another plug for the Bottle House, the food really is good now). Poured into a pint glass, a golden amber brew, certainly darker than mass-produced Euro pale lagers but with the same aggressive carbonation and white head. Much has been said and written about this beer's morphing into something more commercial, industrial, and perhaps just plain bland ... Although some of these criticisms cannot be impugned, to my palate this is still a pretty solid beer than is at least worthy of riding on its grandparent's coattails. The aroma is fresh, bright, and hits the appropriate malt and hop targets. Smells like sweet cornbread and gummy boiled sweet grains, green grassy hops (or hop extract), green fruit, and there's a faint hit of struck match or sulfur. The malts are more complex than you get with your average Euro pale lager, evoking popcorn, light toast, and even a faint raisin note. I also get some herbal Saaz hop character (lavender? tarragon?) although this feature is disappointingly muted. The hops come off more as fragrant hay and do provide a crisp lingering bitterness. Not skunked despite the green bottle. Crisp and refreshing. If you want a hoppy Czech pils find a craft-brewed example. I will say that this brew is enjoyable enough and I appreciated the malt profile.","CalgaryFMC","Jan 24, 2014"

I think however you've turned a corner....I picked up a 4 pack of the new tall format with the original art works from historical archives. Not sure f this is a limited thing but all 4 of the tallboys in this cardboard back are a cool retro label. With that said the beer however was the real stand out. I can't remember a Pilsner Urquell tasting this fresh and frankly malty and creamy delicious. The balance with the Saaz hops is outstanding in this pack and it taste more like a Munich Helles Lager to me then a watered down Czech Pils that I remember. The only other time I remember Urquell tasting this way was on tap and that was the unfiltered version of the beer. I think that the flavor is probably due to a fresher can and I will try to see if I can find more because for $5.50 a 4 pck of pints, you can't beat this legendary Pils.","bushwik","Jan 21, 2014"

This was most-similar to Sunshine Pils and about as good. I like the Prima Pils' bold hops flavor a bit more, however, it comes at the price of 1% more ABV. I like to watch my calories so Sunshine Pils is a staple in my fridge but they stop making it every year in August. This Pilsner Urquell, at the same ABV with as satisfying a taste, will get me through the winter until Troegs starts back up with Sunshine.","Tucquan","Dec 24, 2013"

This beer is known as the original pilsner and for me it is the benchmark for which I compare all Bohemian Pilsner. This is a very enjoyable pilsner and on a hot summers day I could drink this beer without desire for anything else.

I waited to review it til when I could find it in a can as the bottles and even some I've had on-tap have had that skunkiness imported green bottle lagers can have. Seems that the people at Pilsner Urquell have been focusing on freshness as of late, which means I will definitely be buying more than I had in the past. This stuff is really drinkable and I could probably drink a gallon of the stuff. This is really underrated on this site, as is many pilsners of this type. I do enjoy many of the American craft versions of pilsners, Prima and Scrimshaw come to mind, but really I think they are a bit hopped out of the style sometimes in keeping up with what craft beer drinkers want. I however enjoy the grassy medium bitter hops such as Saaz which really are showcased in this beer.","PaulyB83","Dec 21, 2013"

Finally, the light, medium-carbonated body leaves us with a brief aftertaste (as it should be in the style) displaying the Saaz exuberance.","HabiMendes","Apr 28, 2013"

Bright, herbal, lemony Saaz hops, earthy and lemony with a touch of buttery softness to complement the earthy bite. Soft pilsner malt is present, doughy and refreshing. The palate opens with a surprising butteriness, more than I remembered, and more than I'm used to, complementing the doughy, bready malt flavors. Surprisingly earthy, herbal and bitter, there's a blend of lemon and mineral (from the hop) flavors. Mildly dusty, mildly cobweb-like, there's also a mild honey flavor. Drying on the finish with the DMS lending a softness, this beer has lingering earthy bitterness and a nice, snappy hop flavor. Medium-light in body, with the decocted-mash mouthfeel that the best pilsners have, this beer is crisply carbonated and quite refreshing. The DMS , which in all fairness is an integral part of the flavor profile, is taking a little getting used to, but apart from that, this beer is stellar.","DefenCorps","Mar 24, 2013"

I poured two bottles into a tall Aruban Balashi 22 oz mug, to suck down. I really wanted Staropramen, after trying it the other day, but our distribution was lacking. I have a feeling the hippies working behind the counter called all their buddies when the decent stuff arrives on tuesdays. Anyways, this is definately a favorite of mine---a bit too sweet, but a welcome change from the stuff i've been indulging. I don't know if the Diacetyl levels are prevalent here, but a bit too carbonated for this session. I picked up a sixer in Cali 10 years ago, and don't remember all the carbonation. Maybe this case has been aged tooo long. It does have that apple cider thing going on a bit, but still better than the yuengllings, genny's and lionheads i've been sessioning. I'll probably have a couple more and then i will sample the Hofbräuhaus München---hopefully this will be a bit fresher and not as sweet, cheers.","Gaharudan","Jan 18, 2013"

Much more pronounced (although still subtle) hop bitterness, fresh noble hop fragrance, and an overall feeling of understanding of why this defined the style. Tasting it this way, I can honestly say I would drink this beer very, very often if I could get it as fresh back home.","captaincoffee","Jan 11, 2013"

The hop flavor, the peppery spiciness isn't quite there anymore, but the peppery hop flavor is still food. Urquell is still a bitter lager and that's why its still my favorite Czech beer. Now, don't get wrong, I like some of the more balanced Czech pilsners like Budvar (er, Czechvar) or Staropramen, but I've always appreciated that bitter bite in a Pilsner Urquell. The trick is to find a retailer that takes good care of their bottles. This beer needs to be consumed as fresh as possible. Those hops fade fast. Not really a pretty beer (the head always falls quickly), but decent pils that is very low alcohol for those that have to get to work early in the morning.","marcobrau","Dec 22, 2012"

This beer is darker than golden with more brown to it. A medium dark honey color best describes the Pilsner Urquell. Top it off with a pure white head that while thin, lasts and laces well, and add the extra fine bubbles and you have a beautiful beer. The aroma shouts beer. And the flavor? Ethereal sweetness is surrounded with complex and layers of bitterness and bite. This beer is in a class all its own, and can stand tall against any style. No wonder the Czechs drink more beer per capital than any other nation.","iSip","Sep 11, 2012"

I can, however, say that I've experienced standard transportation Pilsner Urquell vs. it's new counterpart, "Express Shipped", and sending this over ASAP in new packing which keeps light from the green bottles is the only way to go. Delicious and sinfully refreshing with a low ABV, Pilsner Urquell is a superb and easy-to-find lager with subtle complexity and fantastic drinkability.","BeerFMAndy","Aug 06, 2012"

Taste of light sweet malts, light citrus, some diacetyl; hoppy finish. Bitter metallic aftertaste at first. Not great, but brings back memories of this beer as a step beyond the usual commercial beer. Interesting to try again, but don't need to revisit for a long time.

Heavy carbonation amplifies the spicy hopping quite nicely, and the lighter body keeps the beer from being too filling.

It is fairly bitter, very refreshing and enjoyable, with thick, robust, snow-white head, which leaves nice ring-marks on the glass as you drink.

Semi dry finish leaves you thirsty for another sip. Decent Czech Pilsener, decent session beer- worth a try- Prost!","GossageBrewery","Jan 10, 2012"

In the nose the hops are noticeable as is the lager yeast; a little musty, but welcomed for the style. In the taste I notice grains and malt up front that add a little sweetness, but then the hops come through and add a decent amount of bitterness that really rounds this beer out nicely.

The Summit and Czechvar are so close that it comes down to a matter of preferences. If you want a little more of the Bohemian malt flavor and Saaz hops, then go with the Czechvar. Taste wise, I think the Czechvar wins, but if appearance is more important to you, go with the Summit. If you want a cleaner tasting lawn mower beer, the Summit is great cold.

There's maybe half a finger of white head that manages to leave faint spots of lacing on its way down the glass. There's a certain grainy, bready aroma from the malts, and a definite floral, European hop note as well. Unfortunately, I didn't win the green bottle lottery, as there's also a fairly present skunky aroma. While the skunking was moderate in the nose, it's a bit more prevalent in the taste. It really becomes the defining presence in every sip. I can still taste those same malty and hoppy notes, and I believe there's at least a serviceable pils hidden in there, but this is what happens when you decide to sell your product in less than ideal packaging (green bottles). At least the mouthfeel is unaffected, and is pleasantly light and spry (all the better to finish this beer quickly). Carbonation is a bit dull, failing to help elevate the noble hop flavors. I generally try to be understanding when it comes to blaming brewers for problems with a beer, but if you're going to choose to ship your beers internationally in bottles that don't effectively protect from light exposure, then there's no one else to blame for skunky beer.","axeman9182","Feb 03, 2011"

The beer poured a nice golden color with about an inch of frothy white head that dissipates quickly. The aroma was somewhat floral and also smelled of malt. The taste is very mild and there is a low alcohol content which makes this a good session beer. This is a very crisp, light, refreshing beer. While nothing spectacular, I would definitely recommend this beer for an any-occasion beer.","Chincino","Nov 17, 2010"

Carbonation is uneven all the bubbles are different sizes some large some pin sized and all coming up in different speeds. It poured out with a golden hue much deeper than most German or American Pilsners. There was a small white head that disappeared after contact. Very grassy and floral to the nose like running through a field of wild flowers with freshly mown grass. The scent is definitely inviting. Now the first sip, lightly toasted malts in a sea of grain and grass, kicked back by a sharp floral hop adding spice and dryness. Mouthfeel is like a champagne, very bubbly and dry but light in body as a pilsner should be. Hops are assertive in taste and dryness, it has a very nice dry snap. Drinkability is limited though by the dryness. It would be nice to drink a few but my mouth would become very dry and i would have to switch to a Dunkel lager or a Weizen to quench my thirst.","bigrzman","Oct 16, 2010"

Buttered bread flavor with a light hint of honey followed quickly by a bright burst of Saaz hops bringing a floral spicy taste and just enough bitterness to keep things in check. Finishes with a lingering spiciness. Medium-bodied. Soft carbonation. Well-balanced and makes for easy drinking.

The town loves it's beer and on discovery learned every pub in town carried storage variation from cask to nitro-all. Of course I was sold right away but was most delighted when it was paired with an unusual combination of beer cheese, mustard and fatty pork on top of a nice local bread. Soooo fantastic was the combination that once a month I ritualistically do the same here in the States to bring back that feel; that moment in time that I had in CZECH. On top of it all I had the great fortune to drop the work and travel to PLZEN and partake of the town that I feel hops was created... :) My twist of course, but if you were there immersion into this ideology wouldn't be that far off...","Fengzi","Jun 14, 2010"

Standard grassy Saaz with a mild bite but they never grab you - medium finish, they never stand up and take a bow, mere sidekicks. A hint of floral as well. Which is not a bad thing all the time.

No matter what, no light lager stacks up to the original. Maybe marketing and aura has gotten to my head, or maybe it's the homebrewing, but there is so much flavor packed into this beer. With the malt, the triple decoction adds a perfect sweetness to the flavor profile while turning it a beautiful golden hue. You can tell the difference immediately in pils beers if it's decocted or not in the malt presence and the darker color. It smells of floral saaz hops that are spicy and perfect in IBU's. They go very well together in the flavor of the beer and the yeast character is subtle at best. The triple decoction adds dextrin-feel to the mouthfeel, but no matter what, it's a light lager, but it BLOWS the competition away. I'll order this anytime I see it and the selection sucks, because this beer turned me on to better things, and now that I've brewed my own and realize how much goes into creating this beer perfectly, I respect it that much more.","MusicmanSD","Jun 05, 2009"

A very bready to bicuity fragrance at first, then the spiciness from the hops finishes it all out. A malty and bread flavor comes out at in the flavor, and dominates till it reaches the back, and a mild grassy bitterness comes out at the end.

Because of it coming from a can, there was none of the typical skunkyness that many associate with European lagers. Bitterness ruled the day with this beer though the semi-sweet flavors of the malt did attempt to balance the beers taste. It is somewhat light in the mouth. However, I could probably drink a whole bunch of these. I think this is still the archetypal pilsner, though probably not the best.

The smell was "skunk" right up front, probably due to the use of Saaz hops. I do find this to be a pleasant attribute and I believe the brewer intended for the beer to have a strong hop smell and taste as well. Again, the taste was Saaz hops right up front giving it a nice bitter kick with a fine balance of malts lingering in the background to even it out. This beer has a biscuit taste. Overall, this beer would probably appeal to Heineken, Grolsch, and other Euro Pale Lager or Pilsner drinkers. It is a very complex but drinkable brew.","JoKo","Jun 03, 2008"

Poured a deep amber to golden amber with a huge billwing white head that qucikly receded down to nothing, simply leaving a ring of lace surrounding the sides of the glass. No residual lace was present, and the carbonation was decent as it bubbled up from the bottom of the glass. The smell was pretty average, your typical musty, earthy grain aroma, with a touch of some european bittering hops, but just barely a touch. The taste was pretty self descript, musty grain and bread, a little cereal like but that was about it. Nice smooth, slick feel, not as much carbonation when drinking as the appearence would have let on. Very drinkable when very cold, but like alot of pilsners they tend to not warm so well in my opion. Overall this was enjoyable as always as a session beer. It is a good one to stock the cooler with for the bbq.

The mouthfeel was a little on the thin side, even for a pilsner. Can you drink this stuff? Definitely and you can drink a lot of it too. The low ABV, the thin mouthfeel and the sweet aftertaste make it overall, easy to drink. Reminds me more of something I'd be drinking during the summer than all year round since it was so light.","maddogruss","May 02, 2007"

3.61,1.1,3.5,2.5,4,4,4,"Ok - so after all the hype, I'm ready to try the beer. It's served with very little head and in a pint glass. The color is golden/red and it has some effervesence. I don't detect much of a smell at all. There's a little lacing on the glass. Now for the taste - yeasty and not really complex. It's got more flavor than some more common pilsners, but I'm not that excited about it. Maybe some weak fruits are roaming around there, but it's mostly the taste of yeast. Very refreshing though.","kdoc8","Apr 17, 2007"

In mouth is round, perfectly clean, bitter, probably the most bitter pilsner I've ever had, but with a delicate and silky flavor and smoked notes. Malt is more noticed than in the smell.

Skunky/spicy and green/earthy Saaz in the nose, with hints of grassiness and some toasted malts. It's fairly bitter on the palate with spicy, earthy, and piney hops balanced by a light dose of toasted malts.

In a pils glass, sweat on the glass, steady carbo, nice small head. Looks like a classic example of beer. The first smell was kinda skunky which is possible with the green glass. Also a sourish hoppy smell and some veggie smell of mostly corn. Taste was about the same with the biggest contributor being the hops and adjuncts. Mouthfeel on lighter side with carbonation bubbles fading fast. Light drying aftertaste, fairly crisp finish.

As always, this is a brew that will keep you entertained one after the next, never loosing the taster in beer desensitization land.

The hops really start to shine as it reaches about 14C, herbal with just a hint of lemon and grapefruit. The malts are a bit thin, and don't provide as much support as they could, but they aren't offensive either.

Lost a lot of carbonation in the pouring process (vis-a-vis the bottle version), but that improved it, IMHO. Clean, light hops in the smell and the same in the taste, which was was welcome after the Stella I had just drank.

The mouthfeel is very crisp, but not bone dry. Very drinkable, especially on a 100 degree day.

Find this on draught and you will easily disern the saaz hop flavor from the light-struck green bottle skunk. Obviously light bodied and highly carbonated, this exceedingly hoppy brew is quite crisp and refreshing, but the malt character is difficult to pick up, and perhaps a bit unbalanced.

3.17,-11.2,4.5,5,2.5,3,2,"This was ok, but did not turn out to be my style. I got this after reading some rave reviews for Budwieser Budvar, the Czech beer Busch named its best selling brew after. I couldn't find Budvar (or Czechvar in America) just then, and Urquell is its main competitor, so I got that instead. Plus many people here said Urquell is better anyway. It didn't turn out to be that great for me. The appearance is very pleasant, a golden amber with a substantial white frothy head. The bottle is nice too, I like the green and I think the foil adds a classy touch. The smell was very interesting, and I could detect some grass and even some floral aspects. The taste and mouthfeel were a letdown though. There's medium malt, not much yeast, and very strong hops. This is I think my second beer with Saaz hops, and I do not appreciate them. My problem with virtually all hops is that they generally fall into either the catagory of the almost non-existent (see especially American macro style lagers, but including some better ones like Saranac Smooth Lager or Killians Irish Red), strong and disgusting (skunked beer and Bud), or overbearingly bitter (Urquell, Sierra Nevada, Saranac Aiderondak Amber). Very few beers use hops with my ideal flavor profile which is balanced with some bitterness and a complex flavor (See Sam Adams, Yuengling Traditional Lager). Urquell uses the bitter sledgehammer and I don't appreciate it. There are definately some subtle and enjoyable things going on in the flavor if this beer. But the hops crowd it out. And the mouthfeel and drinkability further suffer because its kind of on the thick side. Of course, by this time, fans of Urquell who are reading this review are probably going "That's what real beer is like idiot! Sorry its not another tastelss Macro lager from Milwalkee or St Louis". Now that'd be a pretty fair thing to say, but I have 2 counters. 1, If your hops are good enough I'll put up with the bitterness. These are close, but not quite there. Strong bitter flavor doesn't make a good hop by itself, at least not for me. 2, Isn't pilsner supposed to be on the light side and thirst quenching? If they really are, then this is not true to the style. Except Urquell is supposed to be the origional pilsner. So my conclusion is that pilsner in general is overhyped. Just because its got an interesting color and a new hop doesn't make it the class of the world. Then again, this was still a good beer and a fairly interesting beer even if I thought it had its faults.","casualbeerman","Dec 29, 2005"

Maybe I should just say ditto and be done with it. I was about to write about how Ive tried this beer several times and from different bars, restaurants and six-pack stores and in different towns (in case the problem was the distributor), but its always quite skunked. It pours a clear, medium gold with a touch of amber and has a very small, white head that quickly diminishes to a very thin film. But the smell. Yikes! I was hit by the strong skunk as soon as I popped the cap on this bottle. I poured it and let it sat, knowing that sometimes the skunk will subside just enough that you can concentrate on the other qualities of the beer, but this one didnt. All I got was skunk with a little bit of floral hops and light grain sticking out behind it. The taste was more of the same. It has a medium-light body, dry texture, and low carbonation. Drinkability? Im rather stingy with my money and didnt want to waste a beer that cost as much as it did, but I couldnt do it, and half of it went down the sink. The burps of skunk for the next half hour made wish I hadnt even had the 6 ounces I did. Some of the other bottles of this beer I've had have been slightly better, but never good. Total disappointment, and I doubt Ill be giving this another chance, not at that price. But I agree with Hero27 that maybe I would give it another chance if it were on tap somewhere.","ski271","Nov 17, 2005"

Maybe if they had brown bottles or I could try it on draft, it'd be a different story. Pours a clear golden-yellow color...head is modest but leaves decent lacing. Euro-skunk aroma...ugh. Taste is mostly grassy, herbal hops. Light, clean mouthfeel. Drinkable, but the "imported" class labels it a bit too pricey for what you get. Not an entirely bad pilsner, and I'm frankly not crazy about the style to begin with...but it just doesn't blow me away. I can't imagine it even being that great minus the skunk.

The smell is what does it: reminds me of the Hofbrau house every time. Sweet and bitter and bready, like good beer should be. The taste is a little skunky but has a nice bitter middle and a lingering biscuity sweetness. Mouthfeel is fine. A little bit chewy but not so much that it overwhelms the delicate fruity nuances of the brew. Drinkability is tops.

3.92,9.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"One cannot help but feel a degree of reverence for this beer. Even if it has become mass-marketed, it deserves respect for virtually DEFINING the most emulated and duplicated style of beer in the world. This is the original; the basis, the foundation. The appearance is better than average, honey-coloured, translucent, with ample head and a creamy ring forming and leaving healthy lace. I suppose the appearance does not impress me much simply because its look is so similar to literally hundreds of other beers; indeed, it is such an imitated style that its appearance no longer holds any novelty. The aroma is spicy with that lovely Saaz hop, malty, bready; even slight fruitiness greets the nose. There is a pleasant toastiness of malt, very well balanced with the Saaz. This, to me, is how a good lager should smell. In short, it is absolutely bursting with aroma compared to so many lagers. The taste is bready and crisp on the middle of the tongue, followed by that lovely, dry bitterness, leaving an aftertaste to savour. Slight caramel malt flavours keep the taste partly sweet before the finish. Despite the light appearance, this has a nice full taste, leaving so many mass-produced lagers in the dust. To those accustomed to disgusting adjunct-lager beer, this is a massive leap forward. In fact, sewage-water, trendy, media-influenced beer drinkers will probably find it too hoppy and flavourful for their woefully under-developed palates. For intelligent beer consumers, however, this is an essential brew simply because of its pedigree and influence; its legacy. And, oh yes, it tastes great, too.","Cwrw","Feb 15, 2004"

Mouthfeel is soft, although decidingly NOT smooth, with a medium body and an astringent, tannic finish. Taste begins with skunky thiols, followed by a rather intense dry bitterness which continues through, and surpasses the finish, leaving the mouth with a very dry, tacky, aftertaste. There is a touch of sweet malt and corn in the middle, obscured for the most part by the skunk. The finish has very strong notes of lemon rind. I've certainly had much better pilseners, and perhaps this is good when it's not skunked, but I've had this on many, many occasions and it's always been skunked. I've even had a friend from the Czech republic bring me a bottle back home and it was just as nasty as the stuff I get locally.

The abundant Saaz hops and the crisp and sharp bitterness is more noticeable in the bottle because the drafts malty sweetness mellows out the metallic bite. The nose of the draft version is also maltier and a bit more herbal, while a trace of green-bottle skunkiness is detected in sample B. The white heads are similar except the bottled Urquell's head lasts a bit longer. The only discernable similarity is the clean finish.

It presented with a clear gold appearance with little carbonation, small head with short retention and little lacing. I detected a crisp hop smell, and very subtle skunky odor. It still held a crisp taste, with the Saaz noticeable as ever. The beer also had a nice crisp, clean finish with a pleasing bitterness. The medium- to light-body made for a rather tingly and full mouthfeel. Pilsner Urquell is a good beer to have on tap, but I was slightly disappointed that its taste did not quite live up to its reputation and esteem as the first true pilsner.

Rich buttery smells is very noticable. Taste is moderatly balanced, malt, very spritzy, and carbonated. Nice bitter finish and again somewhat sour. Not bad though. A better, more full taste than other pilsners I have had, although I don't think I have had many Bavarian style. Better body and taste than I expected. I'm all right with this one, really.

Faint malts and hops somehow manage to project themselves over the sulferous odors.  Todd notes in his recent review that this quality is less pronounced than in the past - not so in this sample, which is allegedly quite fresh.

The first sip brings a slight hop flavor, and mild spice, but the aftertaste was very bad, again this may be due to the bottle being exposed to too much light, im not sure. The smell of this beer was quite average. Overall from my experience, i wouldnt buy this beer again. It is not much better than some of the macro's. or yuppie beers (heiniken) out there.

The head leaves some minor lace throughout the glass. The aroma offers a bright, clean, well integrated hop and malt aroma. The hops are lightly earthy and somewhat spicy - Saazer - backed by a distinct maltiness. The body is medium-light with a zesty carbonation and a light crispness in the mouth. The flavor echoes the aroma with an emphasis on hop flavor and bitterness well backed by grainy maltiness. Finishes dry with a lightly lingering hoppiness that beckons you to have another taste. Very refreshing and highly drinkable. Quite hoppy, but not overly bitter. Exceptional.","NeroFiddled","Sep 22, 2002"

I could drink it all day.  Like most people have said, there seems to be a strange smell to it.  I wonder if this is due to the green bottle.  Next time I get it, I'll buy a case and see if the fact that it doesn't get any light changes that strange smell.  Either way, its a beer that should be tried.  It's what all lesser pilsners try to be.  The fact that the American company Anheuser-Bush took Czech names for thier pilsners (Budweiser and Michelob) specificaly because of how impressed they were with this beer should say enough.","theman336","Sep 14, 2002"

Nicely balanced on the palate with the hops playing a slightly dominant role to the crackery malt base.  Very good length and the hoppiness keeps it refreshing.

Crisp mouthfeel from the ample carbonation and moderately bodied for a pilsner.  Hop bitterness is fairly assertive but very clean and provides a nice contrast to the soft malt backbone and light sweetness.  Hop flavor is a touch grassy but not overbearingly so and adds to the complexity of this pilsner.
