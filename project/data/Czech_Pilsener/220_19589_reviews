"Bottle of Lagunitas pils drank."
""
""

""
""
""
""
"This is my new favorite pilsner. I could drink this all the time. Light and still 6% abv. Czech please!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not usually a Pils guy but this one goes down easy and is refreshing."
""
""
""
"A little disappointed in this one - maybe an older bottle?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not as crisp and refreshing as I would like a Pilsner to be."
""
"Good reproduction of Czech beers (having visited Prague).  Had on draft, as part of a flight."
""
""
"o: nice little pilsner."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Just not my bag. Decent color but terrible head and head retention. A little bit of bitterness in the flavor with a little metallic aftertaste. Drinkable but not something I'd choose again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Felt pretty weak to me, but not watery or anything. It's okay."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured slightly hazy light straw color. 1"" head stood for a minute, great carbonation. I get citrus and a bit of hops. Crisp feel, with some alcohol at the finish. I like the style and this is another good one in a field of many good ones."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great brewery, but not my style. Golden pour with thin white head. Aroma is a little bit of funk - I can never put my nose on middle-European hop varieties. Somewhat malty, which saves it for me. Very clean finish which is also nice."
""
""
"A bit too harsh, and the skunky/lemony hop character is offputting."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is a good beer. Pilsners aren't really my thing, but this is decent. Condor recommended and approved, give it a shot, especially if this is your style."
"Ideal place for this beer: On a river in the NW, swimming w/ your buddy Vlad. Vlad thinks the body is quite heavy for a pils, but he likes the musk & the crisp finish."
""
"I love this Pils. Hard to find in NC but worth it when you do. Crisp and full bodied. Not your basic boring Pilsner .... At 6.2% this pils has it all"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"

"Pours a clear medium light gold with a nice cap of foamy white head that has solid retention and leaves some very nice sticky lacing. The aroma is good as well, with nice biscuit and noble hops. The taste, unfortunately, doesn't match the robust aroma, with same the qualities but a lacking in volume. The body isn't too heavy and has a nice little bit of carbonation on the finish. If the flavor were dialed up a little more this would be a knock-out, easy drinking and flavorful."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of my favorite Pils.  Lots of spicy hop zest with a biscuit malt flavors which works well. Crisp and refreshing."
"My least favorite beer from Lagunitas"
""
""
""
"I don't know if my palate has been permanently soured by the excess of B-M-C youth, but this really just tasted like a macro in which the brewer paid attention to flavor instead of marketing. This would not be my first alcohol injury: I cannot appreciate fine and very expensive tequilas either, for reasons you can pretty well figure out."

"Very good pils had better."

"A good refreshing beer."
"Avg pils taste, moderate bitter, avg. beer"

"It's yucky And really gross"
""
""
""
""
"Very refreshing! This is one of my favorite session beers."
"Nothing bad going on really but also not much going on at all, somewhat impressive for 6.2%. Neither the malts or the hops are intriguing enough to bring the beer from decent to good."

"Golden carbination poured into right glassware leaving fluff of foam. Soggy cereal scent seems too overpowering. Tastes of malt hoppy pilsner was not too appealing at first. Temerature was not low enough. Overall not my favorite choice for pilsner."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pale golden color under a thick, fluffy white head.  Aroma has a quality warm Pils malt character topped with spicy hops, floral, grass, and crackers.  Flavor is similar, leaning towards the malty side, though there is a nice leafy Saaz hoppiness and a bit of lager yeast.  Medium-light bodied and crisp.  This is always a pretty good bet for a solid drinkin' beer.  They nail the malt character pretty well, though I wish the spicy hop was a little more potent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very decent Pils. A tiny bit on the malty side but good bitterness and nice smooth finish. Not as aggresive as some of the other offerings from this brewer but still well made and will not disappoint. Seems to me it would make a good hot weather beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tried every craft brewed pilsner I could find this summer and the Lagunitas pils was the winner."
""

"An excellent beer.  The price is high but so is the quality.  One of the best Pilsner lagers.  Pairs well with steak or chicken."
""
"PILS pours a golden color with a big lacing head.  There is a very balcned but bold hoppy and malty aroma.  The taste is same, strong big crisp malts, a strong hoppy flavor.  Nice strong flavor, good body.  Overall its a very good strong pils."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good stab at the style, just needs a hair more bitterness and hop flavor, maybe a bit more attenuation. ABV is a bit high at 6%. (3)"

"bitter and sharp and delicious and now on tap at your local cafeteria"
""
""
""
""
"right now, second only to mamas lil yella in the craft pilsner scene. thoroughly ejoyed!"
""
""

"Overall: Does well to convert the BMC crowd.  Not overly grassy and astringent with the Saaz as to turn them off."

"Okay, this beer is good but a little rough around the edges. First, the head is great, long lasting and sticky. Shows great lacing on the glass. The pilsner glass is filled top to bottom with the residual from the head. Aroma is decent. Getting a lot of hops up front, malts are non-existent. Nice golden hue. The taste is a little rough. If you like a lot of bitterness from your pils, you cant go wrong with this. I prefer a smoother pils for my palate. If they toned down the bitterness, i would have scored this beer higher. Not much to knock on this beer. A decent take on a Czech pils. At this price there are better options. Another point for this beer is the alcohol content, 6%. Does not take too many of these to get trashed. This beer is the party animal of the pilsner world. It says F U to the rest, i'm doing things my way. Its the rebellious child you cant control. I would definitely get again if i want a pils that's hardcore and to the point. Nothing hidden on this one. Good pils!"

"Trust Lagunitas to nail the Pilsner style. Doughy, bready malts with an all to dominate Pilsner malt aroma. The flavor is fuller than most in this style with a grainy, malty texture, and great dry Pilsner malt taste. The feel is very crisp and Light but it has that fullness than you don't find in many lagers. Lagunitas keeps doing right!"

"BOD 111/14. Clear golden pour with exceptional head, lacing and retention. Nice nose of slightly sweet biscuit over hops that have notes of spice and tropical. Light medium body that manages to be almost slick in texture. While it appears to be well carbonated (bubbles), it fails to effervesce on the finish in a lively fashion, hence it is normal carbonation level. The flavor profile has some complexity and is well balanced, unfortunately it doesn't scream saaz hops. It begins with a slightly sweet spice that flows into mild bitterness. The middle has a tropical rind like citric note. The finish is biscuit with a low level lingering bitterness with notes of spice. Very good, but not quite outstanding."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a beer that should be rated higher than it is, if it wasn't for the overwhelming sweetness of the malt. Aside from that, the beer is pretty good. And is something I'd recommend for those looking to get into craft lagers."
""
""
""
""

"Pours a bright pale gold in color with a good 2-finger white foamy head that lasts a good while. Lots of lacing is seen, some in rings even. A good amount of bubbles streaming up from the bottle of the glass. The aroma is mostly of malt and yeast. Much more going on with the taste as it is hard to pin point besides the malt and yeast. Starts out sweet then ends with a slight bitter finish. Not to hoppy though. Crisp and full-bodied. Overall, not a bad brew at all!"
""
"Bright pale gold in the glass with a frothy head of large bubbles. The smell is very malty and a bit yeasty for not at all the bright clean aromas that I'd expect from a pils. Giving it another sniff reveals a bit of grassy hop but nothing all that distinct or punchy. I have no idea what's going on in the taste of this one. Very malty with a lot of caramels and biscuit flavors overall a bit sweet with only a touch of bitterness from a bland hoppiness that barely serves. I find that I'm having a hard time getting over how sweet this beer is, however, the sweetness does fade in the finish which is rounded out by some bitterness that lingers for a few seconds. Generally this beer is a little slick and probably not carbonated enough for the style although it could just be weighed down by everything else going on in there. Overall its ok, but I can't say that I'd recommend it."

"Aroma was hard for me to pick up. Grass notes prevalent, but really couldn't get anything else. It does smell fresh though, which is good. Taste is crisp and clean. Light and smooth. Easy to drink and all around enjoyable. Had this after a long hot day and it just hit the spot. This is a simple, straightforward, and well-executed pilsner."

"Clean, crisp, wet, crackery malts, Noble hops, to the bitter and dry side, but not overly. Aside from the DMS, very close to style. Diacetyl is not evident, but low levels are part of the style. Easy drinking, and thirst quenching."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very drinkable beer. Sessionable, even with the ABV."

"Props to them for brewing us a decent lager, but I can think of 10 pilseners I like better."

"Very smooth but with plenty of flavor. Nice."

"Very nice balance. Subtle Sweet malt. Gentle Euro hop bite."
""
""
"Straw yellow in color with excellent clarity. Poured with a short, fizzy white foam that quickly reduced to a wispy cap. Floral hop and grassy aromas with biscuity malt notes beneath. Delicate lager feel up front with a tangy, incredibly, crisp, dry feel through the middle. Floral hop and bready malt flavors with a tangy, crisp, earthy herbal hop bite. Finished cleanly, crisply and desert dry with bready malt and herbal hop notes. Easy drinking, refreshing, and crisp with a super dry finish."

"12 oz bottle. Pours hazy golden with tall, long lasting, fluffy white head and nice lacing. Aroma is of citrusy, piney hops and biscuit malt. Body is medium and crisp. Herbal hops, pale malt and some cooked vegetables fill the mouth. Finish is long and dry. OK brew."

"I really loved this beer a year ago when I was first embarking on my journey of love of craft beers. I'm very curious to see if I like it as much now that I have experienced so many other great offerings. The pour is quite handsome and classic to the style, a pale golden color with a thick and lasting white head and nice lacing. The aroma is sweet and spicy with Belgian yeast and biscuit malts with hints of pepper and vanilla. There is also a slightly hoppy aroma but not the west coast hops I've come to expect from Lagunitas but instead the classic noble hops of the Olde World. It sips very light and clean, quite refreshing on the palate. This could definitely be enjoyed after a long days work or on a hot summer's day. The flavor screams Europe with a bit more hop bite than one expects from a Czech style pilsner. There is a lot of sweet, funky Belgian yeast as well as biscuit malts and hints of spice and hops. It is definitely light and refreshing on the palate. This isn't as good as I remember it being from before I got into craft beer but still a very nice offering and spin on a classic style. That being said, it is one of my least favorite offerings from one of my favorite breweries."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - It's my least favorite Lagunitas and they're my favorite brewery. It's not horrible but not what I was expecting from them. Not that I'm huge Pilsner fan anyway, but there are definitely better options, even from California."

"O: I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. The 6.2 ABV goes seemingly unaccounted for as it is very smooth and lacks any strong hops or otherwise alcohol-masking flavors. The flavors that are present are not subtle but still balanced and approachable. I would certainly have this again and again."
"overall: Back in the day before tasting the explosion of rich brews, this woulda been a primo. dug it but unlikely to seek this out too often."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Tons of effervescence, great head, and pervasive lacing. Nose is bready with citrus and woody notes. Bread, accentuated with a light hop bite. Overall, this is a fair quaff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - The flavors aren't bad, but don't stand out in any way. The mouthfeel is incredibly uncomfortable, to the point where I'm beginning to wonder if there was something wrong with the keg? I checked other reviews to see of others had the same experience, and hopefully this was a limited problem. Would try again, but I'd take most any pilsner over this regardless of carbonation issues."
""
""
""
"O: Overall this is a nice beer, certainly emblematic of the style. It's a nice palate cleansing brew that refreshes."

"A very well done Czech pilsner. Delicate flavors that can either be enjoyed slowly and appreciated, or drank without having to put a lot of thought in it."

"I enjoyed the cute little blurb about ales vs. lagers on the label. Lagunitas strays away from ale territory and does a classic lager style here and like damn near everything they do the result is top tier ... The essential elements of the style are there but so are some unique touches, including assertive hopping as per the brewer's trademark and ample fruity, yeasty character that is often missing from many mainstream commercial pilseners. Pours a classic pils yellow honey amber hue with ample white foam ... Phenomenal head retention and left a boatload of lacing all the way down my Oktoberfest glass. Aroma is noble hops forward, classic Czech hop herb and spice notes, along with some dried fruit like currants or raisins, a slight caramel sweetness, sulfur like a struck match but not overpowering or unpleasant. Good old lager yeast. All of these elements carry over into the flavor, which is fortunate. Cracker and bread crust serve as the backbone with some grassy green fruitiness that recalls lime rind and lemon grass, a hint of red grape, honey sweetness, and creamy tea. Starts sweetish but finish is dry and I get minerals and copper. Pleasing aftertaste and smooth body with moderate carbonation that does not mask the subtle top notes but instead carries them forward. A grain husk sort of astringency reveals itself but does not become dominant. Strictly speaking the flavors should be better integrated but at the end of the day this is a great beer. You could do much worse than call me a Lagunitas fanboy ... When they do something poorly I will call them on it. Till then, prost! (or the Czech equivalent)"
""
"Normal Pilsner colour of golden wheat. Good foam and good lacing. The smell is very bready/yeasty. You could taste the yeast and there was some hops as well. The hops overpowered the rest of the taste. It was not bad, but I've tasted better Pilsners."
""
"This beer pours nicely with the sweet notes of grains on the nose. This carries through to the taste, where the malt shines through and the undertones of hops manage to balance the beer. Even though it's a Czech Pilsner, I would like to see the beer balanced in the way of the European hops over the malty sweetness. Overall it's a nice balanced sessional beer."

"Golden straw color with barely any head whatsoever. Slight ring leaves ok lacing. The smell is bready and yeasty with light hints of sweet light fruits, maybe grape or pear. Taste is a good mix of bread, roasted malts, yeast and sweet fruits. Mouthfeel is light with good carbonation and a slight drying effect. This was ok to me. I doubt I'll ever have it again, but it wasn't bad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall- Just a little more than the mediocre. Doesn't deviate from the style but seems a little thin. Worth a try if you prefer “lighter” beers that have a bit of alcohol in them."

"overall. good. doesn't wow but its always nice to find a quality lager/ pilsner even if it isn't the most memorable of beers."
""
"Poured a dark pale gold with two finger head that died quick and left some lace patches. Beer has a slightly sweet aroma but mostly some pils/cracker like malts and faint citric hops. Smooth, light bodied, mild sweetness and a good pils malt base that has a crisp, dry edge to it. This crispness is noticeable in the mild bite of the aftertaste. Good balance. Overall, just a simple yet enjoyable pils."
""
""
""
""
"o - solid czech pils and one i would go to again."
""
""
""
""
"-Overall: This is a fine pilsner. It's true to the style, but it's uniquely balanced unlike many that are too malty and fizzy. Lagunitas makes exceptional products, and I am becoming a returning customer."
""
""
""
"Clear afternoon sunlight color with white frothy head that stays around. Smells of spicy hops, thick brush, wood chips, mint, and evergreen. Tastes of spicy hop varietal, cereal, vague mint leaves, dry with a smooth bitterness towards the finish and a lingering cereal note. Light in body with medium carbonation. Refreshingly dry and a laudable take of the Czech Pilsener style."

"D - This is much more than the sum of its parts... This is a terrific all around beer that doesn't really wow you in a particular facet... I could easily keep this stocked in the beer fridge at all times without hesitation... An excellent offering from Lagunitas and something that I will surely (don't call me Shirley) will return to time and time again... This isn't a seasonal offering, but this is perfect for the spring and summer seasons..."
""
"Flavors of bread, grain, and some citrus from the hops, with the nose offering much of the same. This is a pretty basic pilsner, with good hop flavor but not much balance or much going on that makes this one interesting and memorable. It's a bit on the heavy side, and the dryness gets away from it on the finish. Carbonation is fairly low. Overall, this a well respected beer that is pretty solid but seems to be somewhat overrated."
""
""
""
""
"O - A decent pils. The taste itself is good, it's just a bit on the light side. A refreshing beer with decent flavor. Might buy again, but won't neccessarily look for it. Again, decent pilsener, but there are better examples of this style."
""
""
"Overall worth a try not bad but wouldn't be my go to pilsener."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
"Overall – Fairly easy drinking and rather refreshing, but nothing too out of the ordinary for a pils."

""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O- This is not what I expected. The beer doesn't seem to fit the dry, hoppy Pils profile. Not a bad beer, just not a Pils. The lack of a hop presence is sorely lacking."

"Lagunitas has yet to disappoint. Love their distinctive old timey stubby bottles too. I have another fine Little Sumpin Sumpin Ale to review soon. When I had one in May I was not yet writing reviews on BA. I am also looking forward to Maximus and Censored. Oh and Undercover Investigation Shutdown Ale is another lovely one I want to review here which I also had before BA, and which suddenly seems to be hard to find on local shelves"
"Overall a nice Pilsner"

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I've had trouble getting into Czech pilsners, but there have been some takes on the style that I've liked...this not being one of them. Certainly the weakest beer in Lagunitas's lineup."
""
""
"O: While this is pretty good, Lagunitas didn't fully nail this one. The drinkability is top notch, but in other aspects (balance, finesse, subtlety), I think the mark was missed. I'd definitely give this a second chance on tap, though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A solid very malt forward take on the Pilsener style. Kind of surprising from Lagunitas but good tasting."
"Great Czech Pils and a lager to stock the fridge with, for sure. It took waiting this long and enjoying this lone bottle from a mix-six to finally realize that."
"Pours clear and gold with two fingers of heavy foam that fell off quickly to some soapy lacing. Good clarity and has traditional pilsner bubbles up bombing from the bottom of the glass. The nose is dank hay, grassy hops a little sour and earthy and some cracker malt. The malt stands up in the glass robust but a little heavy with the clean taste of grain alongside the hops bitterness. Body is thin like a traditional pils and it leaves dry, bitter and herbal. It wasn’t tremendous or unique but it is a nice fat pils."

"This beer pours up an extremely clear pale gold with a small one finger head, some retention, and bits of spotty lacing. I didn't get ANYTHING from the nose. It is as close to odorless as can be. Taste is fairly refreshing. The first impression is a sweet malt with a lot of citrus note leading seamlessly into a dry easy finish. Nothing renarkable about the mouthfeel. I'm thinking this might make a perfect summer beer when you just want something refreshing without all the big hops and bitterness."

"O- I'm glad I tried this beer, I'm still exploring different pilsners, so this was on my list. I'd buy it again, but I'm still searching for the pilsner that will be my ""goto""."

"Right now I am going through a phase of trying authentic czech style pilsners, and this pilsner stays very true to its style. It has a much deeper golden color, then a Bohemian or Vienna style lager. The spice notes are quiet to come through but once you taste them, your happy they have used some high quality Saaz hops."

"This is a Czech Style Pilsner that is smooth and crisp and very drinkable. It has a light hint of hoppyness/spiciness without being too strong. I think the yeast mellows it out. When poured it is mostly clear and produced a lightly carbonated head. It's not as rich in flavor as other Lagunitas varieties, but that's what I like about it. It has more of the traditional German lager experience than the American beers that are supposedly based on German style lagers, with none of the burnt aftertaste of the imports. And best of all, it's brewed in the heart of Napa Valley in one of the last American-owned breweries."

"more of a sturdy pils than most, which i of course appreciate. this pours clear radiant yellow color, maybe a copper hue to it, but just barely. the head is frothy and rich and lasting, although only about an inch tall. the nose is grassy, distinctly Czech on the hop front, and light pizza dough malt like a good pilsener should have. nice crisp taste, with more body than most and more alcohol than most too, although you cant really taste it. the grains are nice and fresh, slightly toasted maybe, and the noble hops are spot on, summery and only moderately bitter. awesome carbonation, really thirst quenching. the finish is super clean, down easy, especially when ice cold. this is a good springtime drinker, not freakishly interesting, but it is really tasty. my dad would adore this, im impressed by its quality but not particularly moved by it. also, like the wilco tango, this is one of the few lagunitas beers where the yeast strain doesn't detract from the overall effort. hey, that's 2 in a row!"
""
""
""
"Overall: I like my pilsner's and lagers in general to be a little more crisp and refreshing than this one. If I'm going the lager rout I'm choosing Victory Prima Pils or Stoudt's Munich Gold. It's a well crafted beer but I probably won't be buying this again."
""
"Still liking this one, it's such a different tasting pils that I have to give credit to it. One that anyone whom likes slightly more hopped up styles should try. And to think that Lagunitas used to be one of my least favorite breweries. It's amazing how important retrying is."
"Overall this is a good solid drinking Pils. It is the right color for a pils and packs a nice combination of malts and hops. It lacks the grassy, gritty, grainy aftertaste of many pilsners which you can consider a plus or minus based on your personal preference. I could see myself knocking back a few of these on a hot summer day."

" The taste is gentle with light malt sweetness and mild spice from the hops with some soapiness in the background and light yeast taste with gently toasted grain flavor and dry finish. Overall a decent pils, but I would probably take or leave it, just an ordinary lager for the most part."
""
""
""
" It's hard to know how to score a lager. The label is right: lagers are just so different from the beers I normally drink. It's hard to fathom that they are both beer!"

"O- very strange and a little off-putting. there are much better choices on the market than this."
""
""
"O - Overall, It was decent, But no my style of beer."
""
""
"Beautiful and drinkable - not my favorite lagunitas, but a great option for a pils if you are sick of Scrimshaw (me)"
""
""
"O - Not bad, but I'm not a fan of Pilsner's in general, so not going to seek this out anytime soon. It really doesnt have any hop presence at all either, kinda disappointing on that end."
"I like this pilsner. It's solid and does a fine job of matching the style except it's a bit weak in the hop aroma. But, taste, to me, is the key, and this beer is very enjoyable."
"Color is a crystal clear gold. The generous head has great retention, and leaves a fair amount of lacing behind. Scents are bread and lemon, but are a bit weak. The taste is mainly biscuit/cracker, with hints of grass and citrus. High carbonation and a slight peppery flavor give it quite a sharp bite. There is a slight bitter metallic taste to it as well, though not overpowering. I think it could benefit from a strong hop profile, similar to Victory's Prima Pils. Solidly good, but not spectacular."

"Lagunitas Pils Czech Style Pilsner ---3.5/5"

"I know I may be in the minority here. But, I have had Czech Style Pilsners in Europe and this was not anything like them. I could have gotten a bad batch, but this beer was just plain awful! It was more malt than hops and had a thickness that does not typify a Czech Pilsner to me. It was not clean and pretty low carbonation. The smell was sweet and did not have that nice sharpness that typify a Pilsner. I had a friend concur just to make sure, neither of us had had this one before but it was not remotely a good tasting beer. I rarely do this but I could not get through this one it tasted so bad. It was like a really cheaply made grain dominant beer with a large amount of malt. If they were trying to make a Czech style Pilsner, this is not one. If I can talk myself into trying this one again I will give it another chance. But, this particular lot was really bad."
""
""
"O: an OK beer, clean finish with little flavor, some hop flavor"
""
""
"O: This is a really good Czech Pilsener. Wasn't expecting much given the BA score, but I was pleasantly surprised as soon as I tasted it."
""
""
""
"It's not an incredible beer, but it's a good example of Laguntias trying to do a Czech pilsner. Quite drinkable, but it does lack some rounded flavors and leaves a taste that isn't exactly right. Recommended for casual drinking."

"i got this lagunitas pils after trying the ""sucks"" which i really liked. the pils isnt as good but it is still a worthy beer. the color is a cloudy golden. it smells of barley with a sweet caramel mix. the taste is smooth and sweet with a crisp lightness. not as bold and flavorful as gthe ""sucks"" but its a different style- this is a good pils but if i had to choose id go for the ""sucks"" every time. also, on another note- this beer is very drinkable.... if you want something you can drink a few of you wont be disappointed with this beer."
"Overall- i think this pils will please a lot of modern beer drinkers its hop forward is a little more boozy than most, its pretty in the glass. Traditionalists beware. I think I could have put a lot of this away in my college days when my drinking priorities were different. Bravo"
""
""

"Not a bad attempt from Lagunitas to take on this style, and definitely full of flavor and crowd-pleasing aspects for sure. I would probably get more of these to give to people that like lighter recipes with an alcohol kick masked underneath. Worth a shot for Lagunitas enthusiasts."
"Overall: almost a very good beer. the taste needs a little more balance instead of everything being jumbled together and hard to pick apart."
"I rated this beer 5/5 on Untappd the first time I had it. Not sure when that was, but I am giving it the same rating again today. It looks boring in the glass, but the Saaz hops really make this a powerful and delicious brew. The founder of the brewing company thinks this is the best beer they make. He might be right! Drink this fresh, drink this cold, and enjoy! Bottoms up, people."

"It pours a nice, clear gold. The head is white a fluffy, almost mallow-like. The lacing is practically non-existent. Lots of grassy malt aromas and bread dominate the nose with a touch citrusy hops. Relatively low carbonation and a light mouthfeel. The hops show some more in the flavor, but malt is the highlight of this one. The finish does have some nice bitterness to it. Hmmm. It fails to ""wow"" me, but I'm far from dissapointed."
"Oh it's OK, but not their best effort. As far as a Czech pils is concerned, this one is a little high on the abv and low on the citrus flavour. It poured a nice, pale yellow colour with a hint of malt and light hop aroma. I drank it and felt like it just wasn't on-par with the other brews from these guys, which you should all be aware, are some of the best craft brews on the market today. I would probably pair this one with a nice summer salad or some old cheddar to increase its character. It is one heck of a lot better than any macro, but it's still not the best Czech pils I've had."

"Pale golden/straw colored beer with a thick white head. Aroma is quite grainy and cerealish with a soft herbal hoppiness. A bit floral and lightly noble in character. Flavor is quite non-descript though. Pale malt, soft bitterness and a light floral character. As a pale lager it works, but it’s one of Lagunitas’ weaker brews."

"Flavor starts off sweet pale malts, grassy and spicy hops, a little hint of fruitiness, crisp-bitter finish. Body is light-medium, well carbonated."

"12 ounce bottle into pilsener glass, bottled 6/18/2012. Pours fairly crystal clear golden amber color with a nice 1-2 finger dense white head with great retention; that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some decent spotty lacing on the glass, with a good amount of carbonation streaming up retaining the head. Aromas of honey, biscuit, herbal, floral, pepper, pear, lemon, and light earthiness. Nice aromas with good balance and decent strength. Taste of pear, pepper, biscuit, herbal, floral, lemon, cracker, grass, and light earth. Good amount of spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, biscuit, pepper, herbal, cracker, and earth on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance of flavors; with no cloying flavors at all. Nicely clean finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a nice crisp and smooth mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice pilsner. Nice amounts of flavor with good balance; and very smooth to drink. Really crisp and enjoyable."

"O: A descent take on the pilsner style although overall this brew falls short. A refreshing drink for a warm day."
""

"Cheers!"

"Taste: There is a little bit of sweetness that fades into a bitterness that actually has a really nice floral type finish. I was pleasantly surprised that I actually liked the floral aspect."
"A great take on a Czech-style pilsner. Bone dry with a nice sharp acidity on the mouthfeel, refreshing. Saaz hops are the star here and are forward on the pallet. Pleasantly bitter and crisp with little to no malt aftertaste. A fine beer for a hot, sunny summer day."
""
""
""
"Surprising for the style. Poured a wonderful head with decent carbonation. Caramel tones and spice throughout the entire flavor profile with a fuller body than expected. Not much in the way of the remeniscent typical ""bitey"" czech pils hops (namely Saaz), but very different, but pleasant. Overall I really enjoyed it, but I was expecting a slightly thinner body and less caramel/spice."
""
""
"A solid pilsener from Lagunitas. Nice bright golden body and a basic pilsener aroma. It's actually more medium-bodied than I've come to expect from the style and is slightly higher in alcohol (though it's not noticeably different as a result). There is a slight spice to it and a nice hop bitterness with a solid grainy malt finish. Easy to drink, but not quite a session pils."
"o - as a beer, solid and enjoyable. as a pilsener, maybe off base a little bit. i suspect that this has been sitting around the store i purchased from for quite a while. even if it isn't certifiably fresh, it's still a good beer."
"This Czech-style pilsner pours a solid clear golden color with thin foam. There’s a crisp hop aroma with a pleasing biscuit toasted malt aroma undertone. It’s crisp and refreshing with hints of sweetness rounding it out while still remaining decidedly light and (especially surprisingly for Lagunitas) toned down. I’ve had hoppier, grassier pilsners. Pleasing, smooth, and overall well-rounded."

"Bottle: Poured a clear bright golden color pils with a large foamy head with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma consists of light floral hops with dry notes and a lightly sweet malt base. Taste is a mix between some dry hoppy notes with sweet malt base with light cereal notes. Body is quite with a somewhat oily texture and some good carbonation. Interesting though a bit too sweet for my taste and maybe even drier hoppy notes would have been preferable. I also don’t’ get the high ABV on such a sessionable beer."

"Pours a crystal clear pale golden color with a decent sized bone white head that exudes remarkable staying power. Smells of spicy grassy hops with a honey and pilsener maltiness to balance it out. Sweet grainy and honey with just enough spice and grass flavor to provide some balance. Medium body with a spirited level of carbonation and a spicy almost tart mouthfeel. Decent pilsner, but its not up there with the hallmarks of the style. I'd like to see a richer maltiness to play against the aggressive (for the style) use of hops in this brew."

"12 ounce short bottle, poured into a pilsner glass. With the pilsner style, which is typically light in color, it's easy to see if the glass you are using has been properly cleaned. And I'm a bit ashamed to admit that my glass doesn't pass the test. That's my fault, not the brewer's. The beer pours a nearly brilliant light gold, with wave upon wave of bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. Most Pilsner style beers are really light in color but this one is darker than those that I’m used. I got sort of aggro with my pour but alas I don't get an real sort of head. I do however, manage to over-pour and spill down the sides of my glass. Bummer. I like a nice frothy head (one you can float a bottle cap on as Jim Koch is fond of saying) with my pilsner beer. Initial aroma is of … well hold on a sec as I’ve managed to give my nose a bath. This review is just going swimmingly. I primarily get some light candy corn malt sweetness, with some flowery hibiscus like hop character in the background. On the aroma side of things the hop character is really muted, especially for a beer that’s done in the Czech Pilsner style. The hops in the first taste are both in the front and rear; malt flows through the middle. There’s a nice bitterness but it’s very mild and low key. Not surprisingly, mouthfeel is light and refreshing, with ample carbonation. I get a little bit of carbonic bite with this beer, but it’s not unpleasant, and not surprising given the carbonation levels. The carbonation sweeps in quickly, ridding your mouth of the beer before you have a chance to ponder what else it may hold. I think that’s a good thing, as the beer has quite a bit of residual sweetness, and without the carbonation levels this could end up cloying. Sweetness may also be coming from the alcohol, as at 6.2% this is bordering on a 1.5x Pilsner … that may be also why I’m getting some sweetness out of it. Kudos for keeping the phenolics out of this one. Instead it goes down quick and easy. Lawnmower beer seems like too lazy a descriptor, so I’m left searching for something else. Lavender hops yield to candy corn sweetness, before both are quickly evaporated in a wave of carbonation that leaves a lingering, slightly sulfuric, afterfinish. I’d like a bit more hops in this one, especially in the nose, as they are there but they play a supporting role to the sweet malt profile. Not a badly done beer, but there are other pilsners out there that I prefer."
""
""
""
""
"O - A great beer that is maybe my new favorite pils, or perhaps tied with noble pils."

"For a 6+% pilsner, it is pretty smooth. Grains are about as light as possible and the hops take on a bitter, refreshing tone. Little touch of lager yeast plays nicely with the hop flavors. On the dry side, it is one of those beers that is bold on a fresh palate, but gets lost after a couple flavorful ales. It's different, thats for sure...and well worth a try. I will buy another sixer as this one disappeared from my fridge with the quickness...especially knowing I might have to wait another 3 years before it shows up around here again."
""
""
""
"- It is nice to have a relatively 'normal' beer from Lagunitas. This is certainly a tad more bitter than most pilsners, and also has a steeper ABV. But they did it well by getting the bitterness up there to not make such a sweet beer (which I feel they are guilty of often). Solid offering."

"This was a good pils, but it wasn't anything too spectacular to me. It has a pretty good body aroma, but nothing out of the ordinary. The mouthfeel was kinda empty to me. It could probably use a tiny bit more base malt. It was just kinda bland. Other than that, it would make for a great hot day beer. Looking forward to trying it again this summer!"

"Pours cloudy amber orange color with a slightly off-white head. There are some wheat, coriander, and citrus scents in the mix. Rather lighter in volume and fruity. The sweet flavors of citrus and wheat are the most noticeable. Slightly dry after taste that finishes a little chalky. I was expecting a little more being a Lagunitas product, but this still was decent and would make for a great summer drinking beer."

"O: Great example of the style. I'm not a huge fan of Pils because I haven't had the proper examples of the style, but I could drink this all the time."

"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a clear yellow-orange amber with a thin medium white head without retension, bu leaving a bit of lacing. Light aroma of grain and light malt. Taste is grainy with light malt but finishing with a mild hops presence that lingers as a herbal almost floral hop taste. Light to medium mouthfeel. Overall pretty understated, but I really like the finish on this one and would be happy to have it again. An average, decent Pilsner redeemed by the hop finish."
""
""
"O: Refreshing but it could be crisper and needs more carbonation zing. It has a nice creamy finish but the finish can have a slight metallic taste. It does have a pretty color. This beer is great with Ramen."

"I've had this before and it was much better. Unfortunately for this review, I'm drinking this bottle, which is an exception the usual. Nevertheless, this was served at a good temperature, had a small off white head that shortly disappeard, and no lace. Color is a very slightly hazy gold with some tiny bubble trails. Aroma is malt, bananas, bread dough. Flavor is fairly dry, some carbonic tang, a little hop. Body is ok and carbonation is a little light, which for a pils, for me, is a major hit. Finish is like flavor and of average length. Meh."

"Overall: Its a solid American-made pils. It won't blow your mind, but I certainly wouldn't mind having a case of this during the warmer months."
"Would I drink this again, yes, I drink it a lot, but I'm conflicted to review this as a standalone beer, I would probably give it a B+, but reviewing as a pilsner, like I said it didn’t quite hit that crisp part of a pilsner I'm used to looking for."
"O: Not bad but didn't wow me in any way. Worth a try, especially if you're a fan of the style."
"12 oz bottle. Golden in color. Aroma of flowery hops and somewhat like all Lagunitas brews, sweet malt. In the taste, noble, czech hops with a spicy note and short livid bitterness. Really sweet base beer, lots of malt and alcohol making for a rather big ""pilsner"". Tastes like most Lagunitas products, sweet malt, alcohol and a good amount of hops. Not the cleanest example of the style, a bit boozy and flimsy. It is a decent brew, however, and worth trying."
"If Lagunitas's product were offered as a 'Lager based upon a Czech pilsner,' the taste, mouthfeel, and overall ratings could be substantially higher."
"visit my website at selfhatinghipster.com for more beer reviews, music, books and more"
"Overall an okay beer (and quite flavorful for a pils), but the hops leave too much bitterness in my mouth for this to be a truly sessionable drink. Would drink again, but won't seek it out."
"A great pilsner. Good flavor, crisp and refreshing."
"Pours a clean orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, Czech hops and somewhat malty. In the taste, hops stand out, want to be a pils, but this beers' soul is an ale, I can taste it. A hop bite and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry hop in the aftertaste. Drinks more like an ale, and I dig it!"
"TGIF....starting the weekend off with a Lagunitas Czech Pils....and it is goood! The appearnace is a clear golden brilliance with good carbonation and white froathy head. The smell includes malt and grain common of this style....for me pils dont blow me away re smell. The taste is very well balanced with good noble hops, malt, and grain. Even thought the ABV is higher than normal the beer is quite smooth. Definitely a session beer!"
"All in all, pretty average. Not offensive, but not top of style by any means."
"Goes down easily. My summer lager of choice."
"i'll probably re-review if i see it on-tap, but at this point i cannot recommend it."
"O - Fitting with lighter beer categories. Not unique in characteristics and aroma. Lacking in complexity."
"O- A good balanced pilsner. At 6.2% it might not be a the session beer it tastes like, but a really pleasing pilsner."
"Overall a decent beer, not overly true to style in any way, but ok nonetheless. Not something i'd get all excited about if Lagunitas had regular Australian distribution though."
"O - I like the beer quite a bit, but it misses the mark in a few places; perhaps I am being too harsh"
"A well balanced and tasty pilsner packed full of flavour."
"Overall: This is a nice pilsner. Average overall. Fairly high alcohol content."
"Pilsners tasted here and there all sort of taste the same - clean, crisp, refreshing, and maybe even a bite of hard water. Drink them parallel, though, and you’ll find a world of difference where there used to be uniformity. Stacked up against other pilsners, the Lagunitas Pils stands apart, rocking the competition and expertly representing the style. Lagunitas’ Pils distinguishes itself right away with its darker color, amber leeching into the golden color other pilsners donned. Freshly ground corn and pilsner malt fill the aroma, with the notable absence of sulfur or any kind of spoiling from sun or microbe. Carbonation bumps and dances along the tongue, while slight touches of corn sweetness and a mellow and light maltiness provide some real depth of flavor. This is an excellent pils, and my new go-to West Coast summer drinking lager."
"O: Refreshing enough and really easy to drink. Pretty standard all around."
"Will have to pick up some more of this again and re-review, as I may have just had a bad bottle?"
"A very well thought out and and put together beer. Another great beer from the folks at Lagunitas. These guys are quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries."
" A much better experience this time around!"
"PILS pours a yellow burnt golden color with just a whisp of white bubbles on top that leads to nothing resulting in dead looking beer, no stick. Smell is of saaz hops and a earthy appeal, fresh cut grass and biscuit bites. A big malt base. This comes off more like a sub standard ESB rather than PILS. The light crispness of a true PILS is not found here. The sazz hops bring out some grassy flavor over baked biscuit from the malt, and by god Im even tasting some corn extract even though I know Lagunitas does not pull that crap. The feel is where this beer loses me. Much more mally with a bigger sweeter body than a light crisp pils. The carb is pretty dead as well. I don't think I will be coming back to this one."
"This beer tastes a lot like Colt45 except with a bunch of hops added. Seriously. Not what I was expecting. It pours a much richer copper hue than you'd find in a Pils, but the look does not suggest Malt Liquor. The nose is heavy with a grainy, husky sweetness; the same can be said of the taste. There is also a good deal of alcohol taste and some black peppery notes on the finish. The feel is not crisp. Overall I dislike this beer quite a bit. After half aglass, I feel like this tastes more like a Euro Strong Lager than Malt Liquor, but still, isn't ESL the AML of Europe?"
"The mouthfeel is a little heavy for the style and carbonation is moderate. Overall it was a decent beer but not an outstanding version of the style."
"O- I should not have been surprised by the outcome of this beer. Seems typical Lagunitas. High ABV, high hops, and sweet malt."
"Overall this is a decent pilsner, but I am not super impressed. Perhaps I have drank way too many of the PA pilsners and all others have a hard time living up to that benchmark, but I find that while there is nothing wrong with this beer, there was nothing that would make me reach for it instead of one of my go to examples of the style."
"O - Overall, a slightly sweeter take on the style, offering up some unique flavours. The higher ABV is nicely hidden on this one and makes it a bit more rich than a traditional pilsener. I prefer the Euro offerings over this one, but certainly worth a try."
"Great hot day beer. I would continue to have this beer around."
"Pours a crystal clear light orange-yellow with a 1 inch white head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Small spots and blotches of lace dot the glass on the drink down. Smell is of sweet grain/malt and honey. Taste is of grain/malt and honey with the beginning and end of each sip with a bitter hop flavor coming through in the middle. Mild hop bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good czech pilsner and another great value and beer from Lagunitas."
"Pours a clear golden straw color with a small white head. Aroma does a decent impersonation of the Bohemian style, with a grainy, crackery malt profile and some grassy, almost metallic hops. Flavor is a little sweet for a pilsener. Hoppy on the front of the tongue but then it's got this honey/caramel note midpalate before a seltzery finish. It tastes pretty good but it's too sweet to be a refreshing beer. Nice mild bitterness tinged with grass. Not a bad beer but it's not going to supplant Trumer or Reality Czeck for my pils fix."
"Overall, this is a flavorful, refreshing lager that is not quite a true pilsner from the flavor profile to the higher ABV."
"O: This is my go to lager. Affordable, easily obtainable, and wonderful. Great beer to have when warm outside."
"Overall: this is okay but calling it a Czech Pilsener seems misleading. It tastes like an American pale lager, so don't buy this thinking you're getting an authentic Czech Pils. Cheers!"
"This is not a bad lager, but a pilsner? Initial pour revealed a very pretty deep golden hue, but head was disappointing and faded to nothing double-quick. Pleasing but faint smell of sweet grains with a whiff of alcohol is the first clue that the pilsner moniker is a stretch - where are the hops? Tastes like a good, hearty all-malt American lager, but again the aggressive hop spiciness of a classic pilsner is conspicuous by its absence. Like I said - this is a perfectly fine lager, perhaps a bit unexciting but solid and satisfying nonetheless. Just forget that it's called a pilsner and you'll find it far easier to appreciate."
"Overall a very good American version of the style. A perfect beer for a hot summer night."
"It pours a rich amber color that is topped off with a nice foam head that quickly disperses after a few sips. The aroma is full of citrus notes that are sutle but noticeable right before you take a sip. The beer hits your tongue with a creamy texture that comes on sweet and leaves your taste buds with a slight tart that punctuates the toffee notes infused. This beer is especially comforting on a warm summer evening right before the sun goes down."
"O - started slow but finished strong, this hints all the notes of a classic czech pilsner, well worth a purchase"
"Overall - a very pleasant and crisp beer that brings a solid all around flavor."
"This is not a good example of a Czech style pils. Far too sweet, and the hops aren't snappy enough for me. Maybe it's an old bottle, I can never tell if it's not a calendar date. So that's on me. Otherwise, the brown bottle can't save this one, may I please have an Urquell?"
"Overall - a good one and done sampling. Tolerable, slightly refreshing but nothing worthy of return buys if other Pilsner options are available."
"This is a pretty solid and falvorful summer beer for ale lovers."
"Overall a nice interpretation of the style. A little stronger in ABV than most Czech pils, but it is masked nicely."
"After one I'm done. It's a pretty good lager but I wish it was more like a pilsner, give it a touch more hops and less malt and we might be headed somewhere. Good starter beer for people getting into craft."
"Overall: I think the alcohol may be too high on this one, as it is not as dry or crisp as desired in a great Pils. Still has a nice flavor profile, even if it is a little too malty. I guess this is too far outside of Lagunitas comfort zone of hoppy, strong American ales. It's alright, I still love you."
"Bright amber with fine carbonation and a large head, but the rest of the beer isn't nearly as impressive. Some citrus in the nose, the taste has floral hops, a bit of grass, and too much sweetness in the malt profile overall. The mouthfeel is dry, but lacks the ""crispness"" I associate with the style. Nothing about this beer really stood out and I think there's better pilsners around."
"Over all if you ask me four another I would say no thank you and most lagunitas are great but from me not into a lager style I normally not into but still one of the better of the pilsners"
"O: good beer, I would buy it again but it doesn't out shine any of the local czech pils."
"It was served to me on tap with a golden yellow tone and a decent enough head that fizzles in short order. The aroma is malty up fronmt with a biscuit-like and grainy scent as well. It came in with a moderate body and the taste also had a nice, pleasing malty pils attitude with a thin hop bitterness. Overall fairly well balanced."
"An overall good crisp drinker. At 6.2% abv. a worthy try for warmer weather, that is if I don't grab the last bottle."
"Overall an ok pils. There are some others out there that are just as easy to get I would rather have though."
"(12oz bottle). Pours clear golden color with thin white head. Decent carbonation but no lacing. Aroma has florals, grass, and some light fruit. Taste has a sweet malt backbone with some hop bitterness. Medium bodied with a slicky/sticky texture and fizzy on the tongue. Finish is lightly bitter. Not a bad beer at all!"
"A good West Coast Czech Pils."
"Pours clear golden with a thin white head. Not much retention and no laceing.Aroma is of bready malts. Body is light and very carbonated. Taste is of biscut,sweet malts, and maybe a bit of honey. Touch of hops in the finish. Worth a try,but I liked the Sierra Nevada Summerfest better."
"O – Not really into this one."
"O - Not a bad representation of the style, but, nothing out of the ordinary unfortunately."
"12oz. bottle served in my SA Noble Pils glass. No dating indicated on the bottle. Pours a translucent orange-gold with a bubbly, 1.5 inch bright white head. Head eventually settles into a solid 1/8th inch cap. Some lacing, but weak legs. Nose starts out quite malty sweet for the style with a light, noble hops presence coming out somewhere in the mix. Taste consistent with nose - there's definitely some sweetness in the flavor reminiscent of corn or adjuncts. The finish suggests a kiss of Hallertauer hops and a faint metallic quality. Mouthfeel is light-medium, perhaps a little heavy for the style, but not unpleasantly so. Carbonation is lively and pleasant. Consistency is slightly oily. A decent brew, albeit a bit more full-bodied than I anticipated and not as clean finishing. That being said, it's still quite quaffable."
"i didn't know that the abv was so high. its pours gold clear with some very very light carbonation coming up. after about 2 minutes no head what so ever. nose is pilsner apple notes. taste is some what mineral hops dry with a hint of sweet. hint of saaz and straw. tastes better with salty meat. it doesn't have a husky quality which gives it some subtle characteristics. this is a really hard style and its just beginning of something fantastic. i can't figure if this is really made with lager yeast judging by the abv. seems like a pilsner hop ale almost."
"Not a particularly complex beer, but a rich enough lager with bold enough flavors that cooperate well and keep things engaging. This is a nice beer when I want to ""take an evening off"" from blasting my palate with big, bold beers. Sometimes you just want something simple and straightforward, but not crappy. This is a good choice, although there are others."
"D: Pretty high for me, I would enjoy a few of these on a hot summer day."
"Overall: A good Czech pilsner, especially in a limited domestic pilsner landscape."
"M: Creamy, low carbonation"
"This is a strange pils. It's awfully sweet and the mouthfeel is just plain off. Still, I don't hate it. I just don't particularly like it. An odd beer, and frankly not one that I'd be likely to come back to."
"Not a bad representation of the style. Not sure if it's something that I'd go back to, but it was nice to try."
"O - A solid pilsner with a bight. Nothing spectacular, but nothing wrong with this beer at all. A good representation from the USA. Would definitely have again."
"Overall this is a tasty czech pils. Don't know if I'd ever go back for more of this, but nice to see americans attempting the style."
"Well the appearance is pretty standard for a pilsner, super see through, yellow, and LOTS of carbonation, man oh man there is a lot. The head is totally white in color and is about a finger and a half in width, it looks pretty creamy and frothy which is nice, and it is hanging around for a decent amount of time. Nothing special, average look for a pilsner. Not much to talk about on the smell, smells like a pretty generic lager, has a malt smell and a malt sweetness on the smell, some light hop notes, not much else. Smells pretty standard, but by no means too impressive, it smells a little refreshing and probably tasty though (the head is still here though, impressed with that). Wow, well the taste is a lot more than I was expecting from the smell. I mean all the flavors are what I thought they would be, but just a lot more of them. I wasn't getting too much of an aroma really from this beer, so I didn't think the taste would be all that much, but it actually has quite a bit of flavor. The hops are more noticeable than I thought they would be, and the overall flavor, complexity and mouthfeel are better than I thought they would be. The mouthfeel is bigger than I was expecting, not a huge mouthfeel by any means, but not wimpy either, and the drinkability is pretty good as well. I don't know if I can give this a 4 for taste, just because it isn't that great, but let it be know that I am very close to giving it a 4, let's say like 3.9, haha. Overall, it's a lot more than I expected, still not the best beer ever, and not the best pilsner ever, but not a bad offering, good beer!"
"Clean and nice, possibly borderline too sweet - for me."
"Picked up a six pack of this. Poured into a pint glass. Had a nice golden hue to the appearance with a slight head that dissipated quickly. Along with the malt smelled slightly floral. The taste was clean, crisp and I picked up a bit of the floral note that I got from the smell. Overall it's pretty solid. I've been on a pilsner kick and this hit the spot."
" was what Id expect in a nice Pils. Not a great beer but a good one!"
"A heavy carbonated pale orange with an average white head. The nose is spicy and a little skunky. The taste is true to style. The mouthfeel is dry but very drinkable. Over 6%, on tap, beach in the background. This is not my favorite style, but I'm thirsty and this goes down pretty well."
"Drinkability -- Not bad at all. Clean, quenching. Solid, but doesn't stand out at all."
"M & D - great aftertaste of a czech pils. Malt sweetness that is pleasant. Definitely going to have this one again."
"Pours golden yellow with a nice large fluffy white head. Head falls to a full blanket. Smells bready maybe a touch of banana and light hop note. Sweet light malt up front, Some grassiness and light crisp hops on the back end. Body is light/medium and rather creamy. Pretty smooth, nice carbonation. Overall a nice easy drinking pils, not as crisp as an actual Czech pilsner but approachable for sure."
"Drink- It was balanced but a bit malty and to close to a euro lager for me."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Smooth and crisp. Easily drinkable and I enjoyed tasting all the different floral notes. Refreshing and easily drinkable."
"Light body and mildly drinkable. The tangy sweetness cloys slightly bringing down the drinkability."
"Taste-Lightly toasted malt, nice hop bite,very clean and crisp. Certainly much more flavor and character than a ""macro"" pilsner. A nice match with spicy appetizers."
"D: a nice, refreshing pilsner. I would get this again."
"Lagunitas Pils is a standby beer if you are too drunk to really taste another beer for real. It has some basic characteristics that make it easy to drink, like other pilsners. Its not offensive, unless it warms up and then there is some funk to it that I am not a fan of. However, out of a tap when its nice and cold, i like drinking it. Goes well with most food, not sweets though. I guess if you are going to go for a Pilsner, its better to support a small indie brewery than to just order from the corporate beer makers eh?"
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer is a very bright, yellow/straw gold with a thick, hearty white head that clings to the glass as it slowly disappears. Toasty and cereal type aromas on the nose, with a little bit of sweet malt undertones. The beer is slightly sour on the mid-tongue, and there is a toasted grain flavor on top of the malty backbone. The beer is very light and crisp, and has a slightly sour aftertaste. The sour taste lingers quite a bit, and the finish just gets dragged out a bit. The finish seems a little odd compared to the body and aftertaste of the beer. Decent, but definitely not my cup of tea."
"D: It's decent, but there are other pilseners I prefer more, even if this one did go down easily. I'll definitely pick this one up again when I'm looking for something light and refreshing... maybe then I will be more confident in my ability to identify a fresh bottle."
"not as light and crisp as most. not my favorite pilsner, but drinkable nonetheless"
"D: This definitely takes more inspiration from the Czechs than the Germans, with a more malt forward taste, fuller body, and emphasis on caramel via decoction mashing. This is a very good beer overall, but pales in comparison to the greats in the pils arena"
"I was skeptical when I saw ""6.2% ABV"" next to ""Czech Pilsner", and it turns out I was right to be. While I enjoyed the beer very much, I would rather it be lighter. I've had lighter bodied, lower ABV beers with just as much (and similar) noble hop and pale malt flavor. Lagunitas PILS is a good beer, and a good price for a 6 pack of quality craft beer, but it could definitely be better."
"Mouthfeel is really good, as this one is very crisp, clean, and refreshing, without being too thin. Drinkability gets high marks for the same reason. Held up to my initial thoughts of it back in the day, which were that this was a very tasty brew. Thanks PILS!"
"Drinkability: Oh ho - this is a dangerous one. Despite the slightly higher ABV, I'm not noticing it until the entire glass is done. I think I've found a new favorite pilsner. While it's nothing pretty too look at, it is interesting enough as a pilsner I keep wanting another sip, and when it's gone, I really want another one. I could see this going very well with a lot of different foods. A very good beer."
"Drinkability: A superior pilsner and one I'd certainly have again without hesitation. Czech-style pilsners have a special place in my heart and this one is definitely the best American interpretation of the style I've had. It also makes me more interested in trying some of Lagunitas' other offerings. Way to go Lagunitas on this one!"
"D: Decent drinkability. A nice thirst quencher and a great summer beer. A little less hoppy than some but heads and shoulders above the Sam Adams product IMHO. I would drink this regularly at the right price."
"Easy to drink pils that drinks heavier than most pils I've encountered."
"A nice example of this style. I would gladly drink another."
"I'd put the drinkability at average but would rather have something else or try something new before having this."
"Very off-kilter interpretation of this style. The beer was very good looking, poured into a Blue Moon glass. Incredibly sweet, the aroma and taste is very malty and has a strong honey-like quality to it. Not a bad beer by any means but it certainly is different for a Czech pils. Strong on all fronts."
"Drinkability: This is a very drinkable beer. The ABV is not too high so multiple pint could be downed and it is one that could be used to introduce BMC drinkers to craft beer."
"D: Crisp, refreshing, and pretty good."
"D: very sessionable, but not my favorite Lagunitas, nor my favorite pilsner. You could do much worse, but this is not my standard pilsner."
"D: A drinkable but unremarkable beer. Light, crisp and easy to drink, but not a pilsner worth seeking out."
"D - Great drinkability. Great flavor, session-level booze, and free of harsh flavors beating up on your palate."
"D - This is a nice Czech Pils and is very sessionable."
"a nice spicy and bitter aftertaste on the tongue. medium carbonation. overall good pilsner."
"Slightly sweet for the style maybe...and lacking the purity of the best examples (such as Moonlight's), this is still a decent lager when you are in the mood for one."
"Looks pretty, like a light beer but with character and crystal clear. I can really taste some hops which I found unusual for a pilsner, but I also really appreciate. Has a light fruity quality in there somewhere too. Solid beer with character. Feels like a lot of care was put into this beer."
"D: The slightly lower carbonation really hurts the drinkability. The flavor didn't really blow me away. The abv is also slightly higher than I was hoping for, due to the lack of complex flavors and given the style I was hoping for something really consumable."
"I love Lagunitas, but this beer did not hit the mark. The mineral character is so overt that I find it somewhat unbearable. I would most liken it to an overly salty saltine cracker."
"D: Decent drinkability, but certainly wouldn't grab one with the expectations of drinking it per style. Good for 2 or 3 but seems like it will fill you up much quckier and wouldn't be as sharp and neat on a hot summer day like finer examples for an all day quencher."
"Very drinkable; had a few of these while watching college football. Very pleasant afternoon."
"Pours a medium deep golden with a smaller head than expected. Foam quickly subsides, leavibg a rather thin layer, but also a pleasing amount of lacing. Smell is a bit of a departure from what one normally expexts of a pils. Hops are present, but they are quite subdued, and definitely take a back seat to a significant maltiness. Taste is also dominated by a buttery / vanilla maltiness. While not unpleasant. I certainly wouldn't call it characteristic of a classic pils. Mouthfeel is pleasantly full, with a fair amount of carbonation, but again, less than should be expected of the style. Overall, this is a fairly pleasant beer, but points are deducted for significant wandering from the basics of a pils."
"This pilsner was recommended to me from my roommate and I can see why he was praising it. Very smooth and light. Im currently drinking this after dinner and this is the perfect scenario. This beer isnt too bitter nor too fruity/sweet which is perfect. I recommend this to anyone wanting a good pilsner."
"D - This is a pretty drinkable beer. It goes down very smooth. It's not my favorite Lagunitas beer, but I would probably pick this one up again."
"Overall I feel as though this beer really doesn't have an identity. It's not crisp enough to stand as a traditional pilsner and the hops (while I'm glad it's not completely overhopped) are too much for a traditional pilsner but not enough to turn it into a very drinkable beer. A decent beverage but nothing worth seeking out."
"this beer was preferred from an employee at one of my routine beer stores, it was great, highly recommended"
"Overall: Solid beer overall. Not the best in style, but it's worth a try. Another solid offering from Lagunitas."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into my Ommegang Goblet. Very fluffy off-white 3 fingers of head. Good retention, GREAT lacing. Great lookin beer. Smells like Pilsner. What can I say? A little like skunk weed and lemon rind. A smell I love. Tastes a bit funky tho. The malt is a little overpowering for the style. A little too sweet. Good Crispness and bitterness on the finish. VERY drinkable. Could probably knock out a 6 pack if I cared to. Solid effort."
"drinkable, but i could find much better pilsners out there for cheaper. i will most likely avoid this in the future."
"A cracking American example of a Czech style. If breweries can hit the button so well stylistically, that's when I can genuinely believe they know precisely what they're doing. As great as it is to produce a 12% Double Dry Hopped Oak Aged Imperial Wild Ale, it's the subtle styles where brewers can really show their craft and finesse. Good job on this one."
"Rather drinkable, but more like a cream ale than a pilsner. Would grab a six of it the next time I play cards."
"pours a pale gold with very minimal head retention. smell is classic euro-lager smell, with a touch of lemony zest and some graininess. flavor has a good bit of sweet backbone, and a tiny alcohol bite of some sort. medium body. overall fairly drinkable, but not as easy to put away as many other craft pils."
"Overall this is a unique and flavorful lager with a nice mild hoppy flavor. It is worth getting."
"Lagunitas Pils is crystal clear golden lager with a thin white head that fades to film and leaves decent lacing on the glass. It has a very fruity aroma. It also smells spicy and grassy. There is abundant Pilsner malt in the nose. It has a smooth, soft medium body with a crisp finish. It tastes spicy and fruity, but not sweet. There's a thick backbone of pilsner malt and a lightly bitter aftertaste. Wow. This is a really darn good Pilsner. (Good)"
"Drink well my friends"
"Not bad at all, though a little rough around the edges for a lager; without a doubt, still quite tasty."
"D) Very drinkable. Not as refreshing as a Urquell, but a good beer."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a standard pint glass a crisp orange with a thin diminishing head. Aroma was mild sweet malts and Earthy hops. The taste is a mild balance of sweet hops and mildly bitter lingering hops. The beer is quite smooth, crisp and refreshing. This is certainly an enjoyable pilsner, one I could surely see ordering again."
"Poured into pint glass. Pours clear and a light golden. Nice, creamy white head with great retention and massive amounts of lacing, a very nice looking beer. Smell was of grass, some dry malt, a just a little tiny bit of lemon. Taste was maltier than expected. A biscuity malt with a slight sweetness to it led to some straw and grassy hops. It wasnt bad but something just seemed a little off and not like many other pilsners. Slightly oily feeling left behind with a light mouthfeel, but again a little fuller than others of this style. Overall a good beer, maybe just a little malty than I was hoping for but no serious complaints."
"M/D: This beer is alright, I really expected more. It goes down decent, but the taste is really bad. Buy Pilsner Urquell instead. At least you pay for the rubbish import flavor."
"D: This is a decent pilsner, but nothing exceptional. Certainly an easy drinker and refreshing, but nothing I would seek out again."
"Pours a dark gold with a beautiful thick white head. Aroma is clean and slightly hoppy, sweet. Taste is a superb example of the style, a clean and technically excellent brew with just slightly more malt than a traditional pils and more hops, but hops are mildly aromatic--as fits a true Czech style pils. Moutfeel is well-balanced, just slightly on the heavier side for a pilsner. The drinkability of this is through the roof and exactly the riff on pilsner that I would expect from Lagunitas. In summary, this is one of my absolute favorite domestic pilsners and I am a pilsner nut--frankly this is one of my favorite everyday beers. Thank God for Lagunitas."
"Know what, I think this might be the first Lagunitas beer I wasn't a big fan of. Well, at least they have quite a few other great beers. ANd to think, the dryness of my mouth and thirst should have allowed this to have a much higher quenchable rate and taste, but oh well."
"Not a bad Czech Pils, however, the hops come across as fairly disappointing - the expected fresh grassiness fails to materialize. Not as tight or crisp as something that alludes to the Bohemian style should be."
"T- Some caramel in there. It's malty. Kind of like a lager. It really doesn't come close to being a Czech style Pils, in my opinion."
"D- Great, could knock back quite a few of these."
"I enjoy this one. It's not as bitter and robust as say, the Victor Pilsner. However, I think I like this one better."
"Pours a light golden color with a thin lacy foam. Aroma has a lot of maltiness with hint of hops. Has a sweet bread taste with a bitter hop finish. Not as balanced as I would have liked. For my tastes, it could have used a little more hop spice or perhaps a little less sweetness. But overall, very enjoyable and very quaffable. The malty sweetness pairs well with fruits and dishes prepared with tomato sauce."
"Instead, I'd rate this as one of the better American Czech-style pilsners I've had this year. The color is darker than most, bordering on amber. Tons of bubbles float lazily to form a puffy head that is about as loose as any I've seen. There's a good malty tone to the aroma but also a competing team of lemons and dried fruity things running just slightly to the rear. Very smooth body despite all those bubbles, and a clean, malty taste with just enough bitterness at the back to do the job in the hot weather, but nothing more. Unlike other Lagunitas brews, I did not feel like my mouth had been etched by acid after the first sip, nor did I feel like I was having menopausal hot flashes after finishing the bottle. Well worth a six."
"Had this a few years ago & swore that I reviewed it on BA, I don't remember it being so damn drinkable..."
"This is an ideal pilsner for a beer-drinker who appreciates a hoppy, complex beer. And it may just surprise and educate the pilsner drinker who hasn't explored much further."
"Drinkability: A solid example of the style. Not the best one out there, but this is true to form."
"Notes: A solid Czech pilsner all the way around to be enjoyed anytime of year. Cheers."
"Pours from the bottle a nice dark golden color, with a nice rocky white head. Very crisp on the nose, with some grassy notes, a little cereal and a kiss of hop. On the palate, more of the same with some sweetness competing with the grassy hops. A nice refreshing summer pils, one I'd been away from far too long."
"D: This is quite easy to drink, just like a good pils should be. I've had this one several times before and it never disappoints."
"D: The beer is crisp, refreshing and easy to drink."
"M&D: light to medoum mouth, drying. Can do about 5 or 6 and not skip a bit. Does have a slightly more abv than a session. Otherwise it would be perfect for a summer weekend bbq."
"D: Great taste, a solid brew that does the style justice. Another great one from Lagunitas."
"I had my doubts about anyone making a czech pils and I think this doesn't have the softness you get from actual pilsners from the Czech republic. It didn't have it but it was very good. Light color but a bit more bitter, more like a German pilsner."
"D: This doesn't do it for me. Over all it's pretty weak and bland."
"D- Not a badly balanced beer, but the hop presence just didn't remind me of what a good Czech Pils should be."
"Once the bitterness mellows out, it is a fairly decent pils. However, it isn't really much better than the regular pils imports, and unfortunately costs me more. Probably won't be picking this up again locally."
"Drinkability: highly drinkable and refreshing in my book. I'm tired of the phrase ""lawnmower beer", but this is definitely a good washing-my-car beer, or perhaps reading-on-the-patio beer."
"Easy easy to drink.. Very sessionable.."
"Reminded me in many ways of the lagers from Chyně, which while being well made and popular with many back in Prague, simply aren't my thing because of the hefty dose of diacetyl."
"tasty example of the style - could drink this all night"
"Drinkability: A little strong -- wouldn't want more than about 2 in a night."
"O Light colored beers are very difficult to make well because there is nowhere to hide errors. If you get a chance to try a good one, don't miss the opportunity. This is one of those beers. Highly recommend."
"Drinkability - Not a bad pilsner. Relatively easy to drink."
"D: crushed a bottle in no time. Excellent example of a pilsner, lots of bitter hopping (rivals their IPA), drinkable session lager."
"D- Great after a hot day working in the yard. Smooth and refreshing. Well balanced, but underwhelming. I actually do like this beer, but I will probably try some other similar beers before picking this up again because it lacks anything very distinctive about it (other than being made by a great company)."
"A nice pis from the west coast. Not the best, but the only craft one I can find here and it is pretty good. A bit too much bitterness in the aftertatste, but, nevertheless, a good beer."
"D - Good session beer for the warm weather months and for those getting there feet wet on the craft beer scene."
"D: Goes down really smoothly. Astringence hinders the drinkability a little - even after several swigs I'm puckering after every one. Not bad at all for the style though."
"Mouthfeel is medium-light with an airy amount of carbonation."
"A good drink, but not exceptional. Not sure I'd get it again."
"Drink: Nice flavor and not very filling."
"D - This is one of my first pilseners, so it is hard to say how it fares against standards in the style. But I really like it and will drink it again."
"Drinkability? A good drinking brew for me and one I'll enjoy when the warmer temps come my way."
"Overall, quite a nice pilsner, but lacked any quality that made it special. Very enjoyable and perfect for a summer day, but would have liked a bit more hop flavor and bitterness."
"Value: Lagunitas brews are worth the dough."
"Light malt, light bitter grain husk, some grassiness, and a long bitter dry finish. Very clean, distinct flavors. The bitterness is just that -- no pine, no citric rind, just bitter. Ok, but makes this one a bit harder to drink. Lighter mouthfeel and good carbonation, but not enough to get past the overwhelming bitterness. Overall, not something that I could knock back, beer after beer. One, yes; two, probably. Three? No chance. A very decent beer, but not quite my cup of tea/beer."
"Light mouthfeel and cleansing carbonation make it a very refreshing beer."
"D - Easy going and enjoyable beer."
"Very drinkable. Pretty solid pilsner overall. I've had better, but this is a good one."
"Overall a very good beer. It is meant to be a multiple beer, good with food or on its own, and sessionable. I think that Lagunitas achieves this, and would recommend it."
"The color is a darkish gold, nice aroma, lacing and carbonation are good. Rich pilsener flavor, grain taste and a bit of fruit (raisin?) and the crisp, dry finish associated with the style. Hops are clean and crisp, and very well done. This is medium-light, thoroughly decent thirst quencher. Would be good on a hot day, at the beach, tossing a frisbee, etc."
"Mouthfeel is on the light side of medium with light carbonation and a dry finish. Great drinkability and though I would prefer a ABV closer to four than five the 5.3% this beer carries is within the range of a sessionable beer."
"Drink is decent. I don't know maybe I am a little spoiled with Pilsners from PA but this left me a little disappointed"
"Drinkability is maybe too high? This is a solid pilsner that invites you to drink a lot of it."
"Poured a clear golden yellow with good carbonation and a small white head. Nose is mainly just biscuity malts and grains. Taste was crisp, bready, grains and a slight sweetness. It had a slight twang or bite on the end. Very mild beer all around. Body was about medium and well carbonated. Decent brew overall but nothing special."
"D - It drinks a little too quick for the amount of bitterness but overall all pretty easy to drink"
"drinkability: it was an alright beer. a decent pils. reminded me of my days in prague."
"Drinkability: Quite good. This is a nice, light beer that goes with the great comfort foods while providing more flavor to compliment them. It's also quite good on its own. Worth getting."
"D-Very drinkable but,not at it's price point for me. I believe that the best pilsners remain European."
"Body and drinkabilty were both where you would expect them to be. Overall, I'd say this beer meets expectations. It's a nice, clean, refreshing beer that's certainly worth your time."
"very drinkable, I would have another of these"
"Got this in a growler and shared with a friend. Was very smooth and easy to drink. Poured a light yellow with only a one finger head that did not last. Taste was like a belgin pilsner not much hop taste but good never the less. Have had better pilsners but have had worse. not a bad choice if you like pilsners."
"Cheers!"
"Notes: refreshing, easy-drinking, well rounded brew. makes one wonder why our american versions had to be made even lighter. could drink this all night."
"Overall impression: A refreshing and enjoyable pilsner."
"Drinkable and refreshing but you can get that in a cheaper lager beer."
"D- Definitely an easy drinker. Nothing special here but a good, sessionable pilsner."
"D -- Drinkability is good, I just wish there was a little more Pils malt character pushing through the hoppiness."
"It might be sacrilegious to say this, but this Czech-style pilsner is better than actual Czech pilsners. It aromas are light yet bursting with freshness: grassiness, honeycomb. Pours a clear light gold with a small white head. Taste is well balanced. Refreshing; highly sessionable."
"D - It's drinkable, but there are better examples of styles."
"D : Of course, its pretty decent"
"D - Refreshing and easy to drink. I could easily drink a few of these with brats or burgers or just on their own."
"Honestly, this is not that much better that a Labatt's or But; it's a little smoother and nicer flavor, but it hardly taste's like anything."
"Taste of bread followed up by some slight bitterness, which eventually fades into a slight sour note that idles on the tongue. Overall, a pretty straight forward brew that is both highly drinkable and refreshingly crisp."
"I've been hitting the hop bombs lately, so this was a refreshing change. I've only had the macro pilsners and was never a fan, but this has made me appreciate what a nicely crafted pilsner can be like."
"Moderate body for Pils, rather rich and chewy and grainy on the tongue. Touch of fruit and notable cereal grains. Nice full feel for the style, though notably fuller than typical and with a nose that lacks the typical European hop notes."
"If I was running a 10K sponsored by a beer company, I'd want a beer like this. I could see it going over well as a beer to 'convert' die-hard Miller/Coors/Bud drinkers who like the style, as well."
"mid body. adequate carbonation. good beer. i like the spicyness. i may try this again in warm weather grilling up some brats."
"Drinkability: Not really to style, but enjoyable enough to drink, if you don't mind a ""sweet"" pilsner"
"A very good Pilsner, and goes great on a hot day. Recommended."
"This is a beer I could drink all day, a little too high ABV to be session (aren't most these days?), but it certainly feels like one. Especially nice seeing its still summer."
"This is a very easy drinking pils. No huge hop punch, but just enough to satisfy. A good take on the style."
"Drinkability: Not a beauty or aroma queen, but the flavor grows on you and turns out to be highly drinkable. Crisp and nice when served cold with a hoppy flavor and low ABV makes it sessionable. Not perfect and a bit flawed, but a solid beer none the less. I need to get a better grasp on this style before I can make too many judgements. Still on the american craft brew front, Sierra nevadas summer fest may be slightly less flavorful but a better all rounder making it more enjoyable."
"D: I have heard a lot of people saying this beer is great. They must not have had some of the iconic pilsners out there. This isn't a terrible beer, but it isn't a good pilsner. I paid $8.99 for a six pack of this. It is not worth it. Pick up some Prima Pils for that price. You can get a better pilsners cheaper (see Sierra Nevada Summerfest). I'm gonna stick with Lagunita's Ales."
"A small frothy white head settled on a relatively clear golden. Not much retention and almost no lacing. Aromas are honey and bready malt up front with grassy hops and earthiness to boot. A crisp, light-bodied brew introduces grassy hops that I expect from the style, the bitterness of which Lingers in the back. The malts are really in your face, and a little too buttery for me. Refreshing, but a bit unbalanced for my tastes and not what I want from a Czech pils."
"The mouth is crisp and bubbly. Very refreshing. Flavor is very bready finishing slightly tart. Fair amount of bitterness in this one. I like it alot. Recommend."
"Clear golden bronze color with good head retention. A constant stream of bubbles rush to the top of the glass. Earthy barley aroma. Mildly sweet smell. A little more sour grassy flavor followed by a bitter aftertaste that I didn't expect from this style of beer. Good carbonation and body. Decent beer but I think I'd rather have a Pilsner Urquell if I were to choose this style of beer."
"Taste is smooth, very well rounded. Nice feel on the palate with a good malt presence."
"Nice body, nice carbonation. Not my style, but a nice easy drinker that seems fairly legit."
"A decent Pilsner but falls short of others I have had form overseas."
"small creamy white hide rides on top of a nice clear bubbly golden body. Sweet malt with a hint of floral hop on the nose. Slight acidic twang leads on the nice malt taste, nice little bitter hop back bone on top of that. Somewhat creamy but overall wet mouthfeel. Would be a very nice beer to sit outside on a hot day with."
"This is a fairly drinkable Czech Pils, but nothing really stands out."
"D - A good level of drinkability. Character is complex enough to keep me interested and alcohol is low enough to keep me from getting sick."
"4.5 definitely works for me. maybe not particularly ""interesting"" but hey this is a pilsner, and this one is beautifully balanced--the sessioning potential is through the roof. will seek out again."
"Drinkability- pretty drinkable, I enjoyed it. I would definitely drink it again."
"Pale golden colored clear body, lively carbonation, and small but stable head; a classic look that's replicated a million times over, but there is a reason why it is considered a classic look. The smell was maltier than others with some sweet corn, and only a vague hint of the hops. The taste was good and mild, but not as clean as I would have preferred. A tiny bit vegetal and a touch of sourness evident. Hops were lightly utilized. On the other hand much more substantial on the palette than the norm with a lingering sweet aftertaste. Well made and enjoyable, but not fully style compliant."
"Drinkability is very good, not my favorite style but this one ain't too bad."
"drinkability is so so since the body is heavy but i want something light crisp refreshing"
"Drinkability is very good."
"D: Rather dull beer. Not near as crisp as many Pils around."
"pours a crisp clear yellow color with a clean white head that leaves a nice ring til finish.. the smell is crisp with faint pine and faint hops aromas a wet grass smell is present..the taste is crisp and carbonated its clean and has small malt grain and hop taste to it.. this is a refreshing crisp pils/lager that is great for the summer your quintessential lawnmower beer its quite drinkable..ill recommend it but wouldn't go out of my way to find it"
"D - All summer long! Great for picnics, casual gatherings, etc. Incredibly refreshing."
"D-Good and easy to drink, but characteristics don't quite match style guidelines. There is very little bitterness to speak of, and this brew would benefit from a bit more hops."
"Pours a clear, golden/yellow color. 3/4 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of pale malt, yeast cleanliness, and a slight bread aroma. Fits the style of a Czech Pilsner. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of yeast cleanliness, pale malt, and a slight breadiness. Overall, a smooth brew with a decent body. I could definitely drink a few of these on a hot summer day."
"Excellent summer brew and a great example of the style featuring some great characteristics."
"Notes: Pilseners are likely my least favorite style (I find them kind of boring) but this one is nicely done with a bit of that sweetness to it while keeping the typical pilsener."
"Gonna have to have more of this. A step shy of the Prague beers, but very good nonetheless"
"One of the better pilsners I've had, I may revisit this one in the future."
"D - what decent pilsner isn't highly drinkable?"
"The beer pours a solid gold color with decent head retention and lacing. The nose is fairly attractive, consisting of honey and bread dough. The beer actually tastes better then it smells, consistig of a faintly sweet package of hoppy bitterness and honey. The beer has a nice crispness on the palate that is attractive, and gives the beer something of thirst quenching mouthfeel. Otherwise, this beer is medium bodied at most, and actually comes across as fairly light (which is pretty much expected with this beers abv.). Drinkability is pretty good, though I wish this beer had a bit more flavor. Still, this is a nice enough pilsner style beer, and is especially good on a warm day."
"enjoyable, although a touch on the sweet side to be overly sessionable. a bit full and thick for a czech pils. not necessarily a downfall, but it certainly hampers drinkability a touch. If in the mood for a pisner and this one was around, I wouldn't turn it down. not outstanding, but certainly enjoyable."
"Drinkabilty: This style is obviously all about drinkability. Would work great on a hot day as a session beer. Loses points for the aftertaste though, even though it's fairly faint."
"Whenever I see a new one I like to try it. When I saw Lagunitas, I was excited to try a California style. It has a nice dark golden color and is refreshingly crisp. I find this to be a nice overall beer, to be enjoyed as a session beer."
"Overall, not bad - an american take on a pils.."
"12 oz. bottle with no freshness date. It has a bright gold body, with medium carbonation, and two fingers of semi-fluffy, white head that leaves light lacing. In the nose, it's sweetish with a touch of hops. Fairly clean flavor, with light toasted malts, perhaps some caramel, a light citrus note, and spicy/earthy, fairly bitter Saaz on top of a lightish, dry body. Simple, but a tasty American interpretation that makes for a nice session beer."
"Well, I would say more ""American"" style than Czech. This brew does have the general looks of a pils but lack a couple of key characteristics elsewhere. Most notable is the lack of noble hops in the nose and in the taste...give me some prominent sazz damn it. Malt character is also more in line with an MGD than with one of the finer Czech pils. Overall this is relatively good beer that's very drinkable but just not up snuff. Perhaps it's the water in California."
"Poured it into my tulip with a nice golden yellow color and nice foamy white head. I have a weak nose, but not picking up anything in the aroma department at all except for the slightest floral character. The taste is where this guy shines with a crisp, biscuity malt and a great floral, herbal hop bit. Really great sipping beer even with all that complexity. I'd have another right now."
"Overall impression: Wow! A fantastic American interpretation. I'm not a big fan of Lagunitas but this pretty much knocks the cover off the ball. What a treat to have a Pilsner like this that isn't imported. Well done."
"Drinkability is a strong point and will probably have me coming back for a few more six packs throughout the summer. A solid offering from Lagunitas."
"Bottle Pours a clear pale yellow with a big white head. The head lasts well. Has some subtle aromas of sweet malts mixed with light hops and some corn. Has a decent carbination and a fairly decent mouthfeel. Has a light body. The flavor is okay. Has a slick texture and is fairly easy drinking."
"Ok for what it is, but I prefer almost any other Lagunitas beer to this style."
"This was a okay light bodied brew, probably best suited for the summer. This would have to be served very cold for me to enjoy."
"D: Could be good on a summer day, but is only average for the style."
"Thin cream white head which dissipates relatively rapidly, no lacing. More of an orange glow to it, yellows out around the rims, not deeply hued, light enough to see the sluggish bubbles rising within the glass. Bready nose of sourdough and baguette, mixed sour white citrus, tea leaves and meadow grassiness, doesn't push itself on you. Medium-bodied with a hefty does of carbonation to keep it churning around the mouth, active palate presence. More sour than bitter with rye, sourdough bread notes and lemony bite. Pine and dried flower petals there, it takes awhile for the malts to smooth things out. Still, a fairly herbaceous beer which has a refreshing, cleansing side but, at the same time, leaves that sourness as its final impression, along with a scratchy tingle on the tongue."
"Overall a good pils."
"Overall: Highly Recommended."
"Don't drink and review."
"Refereshing and thirst-quenching..."
"D= Very drinkable and enjoyable pilsner here. I could have a few of these in a sitting for sure."
"Other comments: A pretty tasty lager/pilsner, but I personally prefer a bit more balancing bitterness in a pils."
"biscuity malt with a tiny bit of floral hops. The taste starts off with a mix of sweet malt and well-balanced hops that quickly fades away to just a bit of sweetness. The mouthfeel is a bit watery, but very crisp thanks to the carbonation. This is a nice little beer that I could drink for hours at a time, not the best version of the style but certainly one worth grabbing occasionally."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink pilsner, goes down smooth. The ""hidden"" hops make it more enjoyable than your standard pilsner."
"12 oz. bottle. Gold pour, ample white head. Pine, citrus aromas. Expected pine citrus flavors with a little biscuit and surprising sweetness. Sweetness lingers a little bit. Could use some more hop presence, but not a bad pilsener at all. One of the few I don't mind from Lagunitas."
"Notes: After reading what I just wrote, one would think I didn't like this beer. I actually thought it was pretty decent, just not what I was hoping for. I guess I've come to expect a home run every time out of my favorite breweries, however unrealistic."
"D - Solid Czech Pils that is classic and true to style. I find that pils drink much better on tap, and this one is no exception."
"I'd easily pass on this brew every time."
"If it wasn't for the unpleasant similarities with Coors Light, this would be very drinkable, as it is very thin and refreshing."
"Round and filling in the mouth. The best thing is the drinkability, very refreshing and balanced, could have it all day. Best I've had, other than New Glarus' try which is great too."
"D- It's a pretty decent drinker, slightly heartier than some other examples of the style. Pilseners can be a difficult style to ""woo"" somebody with. This one was nice, but didn't do anything to separate itself from the pack."
"Drinkability is great. Very good beer, and a nice change from Prima Pils for me. This is my second beer from Lagunitas after Imperial Red Ale, and so far so good."
"Poured a crisp, clear, golden color with small white head that stayed around, but did not leave much lacing around the glass. Aroma was a bit floral, but I also detected a scent of grass, the aroma was, however, dominated by the Saaz hops. Flavor was good and a bit hoppier than I had anticipated. Mouthfeel was great and drinkability was sky high. I really enjoyed this and I typically dont get that excited about pilseners."
"This beer has a nice hazy brass colored body. It had a great two and a half fingers of white head but there was not much for lace. It smells of crisp hops and there are some fruity esters with a mild aroma of grass. It is fruitier than most pilsners but it is refreshing. The aftertaste is crisp and herbal. It has a very thin but slick mouthfeel. It is a great beer one of the better American pils I have had."
"I am a hophead, but this is a bit heavy on hops for a pils. That being said, I would drink the hell out of this beer."
"Summary: 4.5/5. I was very impressed with this beer and its ability to live up to my horribly biased pilsner standards! I may have focused on it's shortcomings, but that is only because they are fewer than its accolades and this is a review, not a novel. Simply put...Lagunitas nailed the Pilsner style but it doesn't create the same ""POW...right in the kisser!"" effect that the 5/5 Pilsner Urquell does."
"5/3/4/3/12 (2.7/5)"
"D - I was using a Pilsner Urquel as my baseline and with that, I was a bit disappointed. This is a good beer and easy enough to drink but it's no threat to the Czechs."
"Drinkability: I could definitely sip on this one a lot. The extra hops really brings it over the top for me as far as a drinkable pilsner."
"Great session beer for those seeking respite from hop bombs."
"Sweet and bready flavors greet the tongue, moving into a more defined malty sweetness. The finish is a pretty spot on. There's a nice citrus-tinged, spicy hop finish with a good lingering bitterness. Crisp, nicely carbonated and light-bodied."
"All told, this is a solid pils from a brewery that makes their cake on ales. Not great, but absolutely respectable."
"D: Not a lot of flavor and balance isn't quitte right. That said. goes down smooth and easy to drink."
"this is better and more drinkable than most pilsners I have had lately. surprising beer from lagunitas, I didn't expect a whole lot considering how similar a lot of their beers taste (not bad just similar)."
"Ever since having the New Glarus Unplugged Bohemian Pils last week, I have craving some thirst quenching lagers. This one held its own and satisfies my urge for a clean and flavorful session beer. Brilliant golden and clear body with heavy carbonation and thin, but slightly sticky, layer of head. The aroma is filled with a doughy maltiness that is paired with oak and noble hops. Nice and resinous, but controlled hop presence. The taste is sharp and malty on the front and dried out substantially on the swallow. The touch a crystal malt seems to add great depth to this medium bodied lager. Not sure if they put this beer on oak, but it surely has wonderful barrel qualities. This is so easy to drink and a great example of a lager done right. It is so easy to get lost in the hype and trends of big beers (guilty myself), but somethings, nothing is better than a cold, clean pils. This one is definitely suiting for crowd pleasing."
"Not among my favorite pilsners. But pretty good."
"In essence the beer does have characteristics of a czech pils, bit it is poorly executed."
"The carbonation is a bit heavy for my taste. This isn't the sort of thing I'll be partaking much of."
"Taste is decent at first, being both sweet and slightly bitter, with light toasted grain and hops that have mostly a faint pine-lemon pulp taste. Thus far, it's ok, but even so nothing special or particularly interesting and is a bit bland. It gets worse and ends up very bland yuet roughly bitter with little actual flavour or character except a faint hint of old, almost tasteless lemon rind rubbed briefly with pine needles. The feel, at first soft and smooth becomes rough, dry and unpleasant, leaving an unpleasant, vague aftertaste."
"single from Whole Foods Reston...been sitting there almost since I moved up, figured it was time"
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy white head, with some sticky lacing to follow. The nose is malty, with some hops, and spicy. The taste is slightly sweet, malty/hoppy, with some nice spice notes. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a true to style brew from the L. Always nice to get a L brew, very afforable and tasty."
"D - Very drinkable, would go with just about anything and is just a very refreshing tasty beer in general."
"As a fan of Pilsners in general I was disappointed by this beer. I found that the taste was sweet almost like a macro rather than rich like say Staroprahmen. The complexity too was missing like spiciness and a muskiness and there was relatively low hop bitterness as well. The mouthfeel and drinkability were fine. Overall not interesting or compelling."
"Worth a try, good california shot at ze pilsener. Drink this with the hostess snowballs that come out around st. patricks day, they're green."
"D- good pilsner, can Lagunitas make a bad beer? if so i haven't found it yet."
"D: Overall, not a bad example of a pilsener. It didn't rock my world, but still, a well done beer."
"D- Same as above, easy to drink."
"Notes: Plain and simple, a decent brew.Good for the last call,easy to chug and session worthy."
"Pours a golden, yellow color with a real nice thick white head head. Nice nice lacing too. Aroma is pleasant: citrus fruits, grainy and grassy. I get a nice little lemon zing in the flavor followed by grassy bitter hops. Clean and refreshing. Solid brew."
"D ~ Not my favorite style to begin with but most certainly worth the time. After all ~ it was FREE!"
"Poured into a tall Pilsner glass, yellowish-gold with a slight haze, foamy white head that disapates to consistent thin topping. Lots of bubbles and a little lacing left on the glass. Smells of grain, corn, muffins. Taste of corn, biscuits, straw, and grains, some hop bitterness on the finish. Decent body! Clean a crisp with a slightly dry finish. Very drinkable."
"Smells great when opened, but I personally don't care for the sharp, bitter taste. I made a cheese sandwich to neutralize it a bit - for me, this would be something I'd have to drink with a heavy meal."
"Very good example of the pilsner style...refreshing coming from the land of ho-bomb ales. This one is full of character and a must for those who are fans of a good pils."
"This is probably one of my top five non-german brews, and certainly top ten overall. I would give a detailed description, but it would be a waste of time, this beer hits the mark in all catagories:Smell,drinkability,taste,mouthfeel, everything! My recommendation, buy it, you wont regret it."
"Poured a dark golden yellow with a creamy, nice head that developed a nice laciness. Aroma was good, a nice floral aroma of hops with a hint of malts. The first taste was offensive, very bitter and metallic. I am glad I tried to finish because it actually was good, nice balance of hops. The texture was good, on the light side. This beer is very smooth, and could be a session beer."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle. The beer was extremely clear, pale yellow colored, adequate head. The smell is sort of malty but not too strong, no Czech hops aromas come through. The taste is nice, slightly sweet, mostly malty and a little grassy, again no major impact from any hops that I can tell. Very drinkable as a lager but I guess I expected more hops out of the flavor, as it's called a Czech pilsner."
"Not too bad. It's a little more bitter than I usually like, but I typically don't have the pilsner styles too often. Relative to other pilsners I've had, this is one of the more bitter ones. It's not a bad beer, but I typically perfer more flavor variation; it seems to lack balance with anything else."
"Pours a clear straw color, smallish white head leaves behind patchy lacing. Nice sweet, earthy/grainy aroma, cut with some pretty pungent floral hops. More sweet graininess in the taste, some crisp bitter hops, slight butter taste. Mouthfeel is crisp, maybe a little on the thin side, but pretty damn snappy and refreshing. I like this. An easy-drinker for sure, great compliment to lots of different meals, and really tasty."
"Had on tap at the Moan and Dove. The drink had some patchy lacing with a generally dark amber appearance. A thin but balanced aroma of malts and hops. Just wish it was stronger. The taste was a medium-level bitterness that was really dry. Carbonation was crisp, giving it that dry aftertaste. Overall, not bad."
"D: Not very flavorful, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, there isn't very much to this beer even considering that this is a style that doesn't get too complex."
"Somewhat sticky finish; okay drinkability."
"As a well-executed craft/microbrew lager, this is head and shoulders above most of what's out there. While I'll have no trouble finishing this one, though, I'm in no hurry for another as Pilsener is just not a style I grok. However, there's just no comparison between this and a mass produced lager (BMC, Heineken, PBR, etc...): Lagunitas wins the flavor derby by a mile."
"D: Very good beer. Quite worthy of a revisit."
"A great summer time beer. The flavors are quite subdued, but in a good way. This would be perfect for the cookout in the back yard."
"D: Very very drinkable in the hot summers of Atlanta. (Actual residents do not call it ""Hotlanta."") Appears to be no ABV but I think by American standards this could be a session beer. Do not send me beer mail about it being too high in alcohol to be a session beer. I cannot help it if you cannot hold your liquor."
"Overall- A good light summer beer. Easy to drink but the flavor is too subdued."
"Rating a beer like this is kinda like the Olympic judges rate a figure skater. They pro-rate the scale based on the complexity of the routine. That's kinda what I do with Pilsners; even a very good score may only come in at a B+ or so, where it may get a solid A if it were a style that exhibited more complexity."
"Overall, a great anytime beer, especially in the summer. I feel I am more partial to this pilsner than others is because of the intensity of the hops which i didn't quite expect, especially from a pilsner style."
"Not what I expected out of a pilsner, but still a good beer nevertheless. I gotta give em' props for getting that much toastiness into a pale beer."
"pours a clear, pale golden-yellow w/ a thin white head which dissipates quickly leaving a decent lacing down my pilsn glass ; not a strong smell, steely grain and some floral/""skunk"" notes ; rich malty palate well balanced w/ a decent hop flavor, a bit metallic and fruitish in the finish ; a light bodied yet creamy brew, a bit on the sweet side for a pils, tho, good co2 may play a part in that ; a very drinkable beer, i'm glad i got a six of this one..."
"D - Very drinkable pilsner; enjoying; would like to find this one on tap sometime"
""
"Pleasant enough but this brewery could do much better."
"This is what a lager should be. A smooth pour with little head. That classic none watered down lager smell. In my opinion one of the best tasting and fully drinkable lagers around. The Carbination is just right as well IMO hard to find a fault with this one..."
"I have heard some funny stories about this brewery with the words growroom and shutdown. This was a prime example of a classic Czech Pils. Naturally I enjoyed this beer in my favorite grand pilsener glass well chilled. I poured a sunny, rich yellow color with a nice white head. It had the nice spicy hop smell with some sweeter malt undertones. The taste was well balanced as well with spicy bitter hops up front and a mildy sweet malt finish that was easy on the palate. Nice brew."
"D - good drinkability and representation of the style. A nice lager with good refreshing qualities."
"Drinkability is very good, this is a very well made Pils, super smooth and refreshing, with a satisfyingly full flavor that doesn't tire or overwhelm. Really impressed to see Lagunitas exercised some restraint here ."
"This pilsner was quite flavorful yet not overwhelming. Frankly, I was surprised at how true to the style Lagunitas kept this beer. My recommendation would be to serve it as a refreshing apertif or pair it with oysters, crab cakes or other lighter seafare."
"Overall, I thought this was really nice, though I have to be honest, it reminded me more of a pale ale then anything else, but still it was very nicely done and I really enjoyed it. I would be glad to try another one of these any day."
"D - Easy drinkability. It is a nice beer overall, but the citrus hop notes and slight fruitiness are a bit off stylistically for a beer that is explicitly labeled a czech style pilsner."
"pours a clear golden color with a small white head that quickly fades and no lace to speak of. weak spice aromas in the nose. tight bubbled pepper and slightly spice taste not your average tasting pils. light to medium body tight bubbled carbonation. pass on this one."
"d - The taste was just terrible. I think I got a bad one. I may review it again, but this was a drain pour :("
"Pours light golden and bubbly with a smallish white head. Smell is apple juice sweetened malt with some light yeastiness. Very nice nose for a pilsner. Taste is bubbly, crisp, and nicely tart malt. Nice bitter and carbonated crispness in the finish, and just what I want in the mouthfeel for a pilsner. As pilsners go, this is very nice, and a solid beer all around."
"Although others have rated this Pilsner rather low, I find it to be a rather unique Pils. It pours a deep golden color with a big white head that sticks around for most of the drink. Its nose is mild, but notes of floral hops poke through. Its taste is crisp, dry, and sweet. Different than other pilsners, which is great, but mild in flavor and featuring undertones of bitter citrus. Mouthfeel is great, crisp and carbonated. Try this pilsner, it's different than most, and a nice change from the usual lager."
"As a self-professed pilsner nut, I'm a bit disappointed by this one. The lifeless appearance, subdued aroma and mild flavor pull the score of this one down."
"D: A good pilsner, but not overly flavorful. Understated, which is not usually the route Lagunitas beers tend to go. A better aroma would have helped this beer all the way through."
"The beer poured a clear amber with a thin, white head into a pint glass. A slight whiff of hops in the aroma. The taste was that classic pilsner profile: Vienna and pilsner malt flavor, lightly hopped, with a crisp, pleasant finish. Good carbonation and lacing. Not really a beer for this time of year, but still an excellent example of a classic Czech pilsner (i.e. Pilsner Urquell)."
"I'm not sure if I got an old bottle or what, but this beer disappointed me. I read the reviews before I bought it and thought it would be a good one to try, but didn't hit the mark with me."
"D- This would make a great session beer. It isn't my favorite American pilsener, but it ranks pretty well."
"This was a great beer. I'm normally not a big fan of pilsners but this one was rather nice. It poured a nice golden, straw color with a nice white head and had great lacing. The aroma was floral hops and a nice malty sweetness. The taste was fresh and clean. Had a nice dry bitterness balanced with a sweetness as well. The mouthfeel was medium body with medium carbonation. Overall drinkablity was great. I felt like I could drink these all day. Too bad this brewery isn't available in LA."
"Overall a great pils I'm happy to have come across. Dry, snappy, clean and crisp with a body that carries everything along in an orderly fashion. I'd be happy to find this on tap and drink many pints on a regular basis. Good stuff!"
"Interesting."
"Beer has great body, and is damn drinkable."
"its about a slightly above average fizzy yellow water drink would be easily drinkable, but for the price and comparability i would rather have something else"
"Drinkability - towards the end the bitterness has almost a cumulative effect and is wearing on me a little. I like a little cleaner finish on a pils, though this is a fine brew."
"Overall this is a very good Pils, and one I would especially recommend to hop fans. It's not a hop bomb or extreme, but just a good example of a well-crafted beer."
"Chicago"
"I don't know where the low ratings are coming from on this brew, it is everything expected from a West Coast ""Czech style"" pilsner... very balanced and a perfect summer session. I will try this again sometime up against the benchmark pilsner, while it may not be perfect... it is still pretty damned good given how hard it is to brew a good pils."
"D: The abv strikes me as low. That, combined with the nice hop flavor, makes this a good drink, one of Lagunitas' best."
"Beer poured a golden color with a thin white head. Nose is malty and pleasantly accentuated by floral hops. Taste is very nicely balanced with a nice peppery light hop finish. Mouthfeel is full bodied for the style, very satisfying. Overall drinkability is good. I really appreciate a well made beer in the Czech Pils style and Lagunitas has a put together a very nice representation."
"Drinkability- Very, but would NOT buy again. This beer is too costly and not near as drinkable as a Pilsner should be."
"A nice west coast made version of Urquell. Not quite as good as fresh pilser in Prague though."
"Drinkability: could put two or three away rather easily for a middle of the road pilsner, but would appreciate more crispness at finish."
"Looks about like average beer-remarkably unremarkable . Smells nice and understated-refreshing in the nose. Good balance in this one with a clean bitterness that lingers. Nice effervescent mouthfeel. A good, solid session pils...good with spicy foods."
"This is a world-class pils. Defining for the style and full of flavor, yet oh-so-easy to drink. I love this brew. Highly recommended. I will be buying much more!"
"Drinkability: This is a pretty easy drinker for most people. I think that some might find the upfront hop presence to be a bit much."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer had a very nice white head with very nice lacing qualities. It was nicly displayed. The smell was bready and yeasty. The beer was nice and refreshing tasting with a pretty golden color. It was a tad sweet but overbering, a really good summer brew. I will buy again."
"Pours with perfect clarity and fluffy soapy white head. Nose is spicy hops. Taste is medium carbonation with some hop flavour. Malts are are nicy done. Finishes clean initially, but an aftertaste shows up that is metaillic aspirin like. That really hurts drinkability. Not a bad thirst quencher."
"What's not to like here? There's no skunkiness like macro pilseners. There's no dingy aroma of ""cooked corn"" here. It's just a Czech Pils, much like the folks of the Czech Republic would have intended."
"I love this interpretation of a Czech Pilsner from Lagunitas. So easy to drink and enjoy. Time for another six."
"Bright gold color. Aromas not pronounced but mostly malty fruits. Flavor is good but in my opinion not very well balanced. It leans too much to the bitter hops, which is fine for an American pilsner but this claims to be a Czech style pilsner. The malts should be more pronounced. Still, a pretty good beer and quite drinkable."
"Overall an outstanding example of the style. The very balanced malt and hops make it a pleasure to drink. Glad to finally see Lagunitas is Michigan."
"*Lots of flavor, but just too fizzy"
"The body is light but the sweetness of the beer limits the crisp and dryness of the beer. Very easy to drink and enjoyable but more of an American style pilsner then Czech I would say."
"Another good Lagunitas offering. Keep them coming."
"Drinkability- This is a delicious beer, Appropriate on a hot summer day, or anytime you need your thirst quenched. Makes me want to brew up 10 gallons of the stuff right now."
"Drinkability: Not as easy to drink as most pilsners I've had, but not terrible."
"Lagunitas Pils ""Czech Style Pilsner"" pours a light amber with a thin white head from a brown twelve ounce twist off bottle. The aroma is mild and malty. There is a very light body and active carbonation. There is a touch of malt and what seems like a nice bitter hop finish, but not much else. Not bad, worth a try."
"D: A slightly above average pils for me, easy to drink, but nothing really special about it to make me crave another one."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a golden yellow color with a white head that quickly turns into a thin white lace around the edge of the glass. The aroma is faint grassy malt. The taste is sweet malt with a nice little bite from the saaz hops. Overall, this is a pretty good pils that is recommended for a nice brew on a hot day."
"Good cut stab at a lager, but the $9 a sixer may limit its appeal  however a beer to sit down for a sixer session."
"You can't drink strong ales all the time, so why don't more breweries come up with more of these?"
"Acquired at The Bier Stein, Eugene, OR. It pours out a golden-orange color with a thick bubbly white head. It's very effervescent and clear. The smell is distinctly yeasty with some fruity hops; the taste is surprisingly nice and refreshing, with a complex blend of fruity hops to the palate and isn't dominated by a yeast taste that's prevalent in the smell. I'm not normally a pilsner drinker, but this would be great one to have cold on a hot summer day."
"D: Just you're run of the mill 8-9 dollar pilsner here, solid offerning but nothing that blows my mind. I like the Schell better."
"-Oelergud"
"Pours a dark golden. approaching amber- a little darker than most czech style pilsners. Good hhead that sticks around as a cap and leaves very good lacing. The nose is mostly malty and with quite tangy yeast more than it exhibits any real hop presence. It's there at the end as some earthy hops, but not predominant. Taste is hoppier, but still dominated by a tangy yeastiness. Sharp floral and earthy hops, then the tanginess and a finish of a decent bitterness. Malt is more subdued here, but it doesn't seem greatly balanced and seems a little tangy for the style. Mouthfeel is pretty substantial for a pisner, and the finish is more tannic than crisp. A decent pilsner, but not anything to write home about. There are better out there, and this one just doesn't refresh as I like a pilsner to do. Bigger and bolder than most pilsners is okay, but balance that with some more crispness and cut the yeastiness."
"Drinkability: A fine, drinkable lil' pils. Czech it out!"
"A nice yellow-gold color with a thick head. Very active carbonation. Aroma was not real strong, a little lemon sweetness. First taste was pretty light and crisp but there is a spice quality that builds and you sense more of the alcohol after a couple of mouthfuls. Finish is not quite so clean as I would like in this style, a slight hoppiness here. A more bitter finish. But it is decent. Would be a good mix-in with some of the more classic pils."
"Fairly crisp although the finish has a slight resin-like quality. Still, smooth with a good body and a nice enough taste. Overall it's a pretty darn drinkable brew even if it's not the first thing I reach for at my local."
"Drinkability - It's okay. The spiciness and heavy body make this very uncharacterisitic of te style. A Czeck Pils should be very crisp clean and refreshing."
"I have been brainwashed into believing that the only true pils comes from the Czech Republic itself, where their water lead to a unique and suitable product. Having said that, this interpretation of the style is interesting if not surprising heavy. Heavy in carbonation and bloatedness mostly. Saaz hops, malt aroma, enoz saltz composition. Light colour with some cloudiness."
"Pretty clear gold, hay color. Good sized head able to form but doesn't stay too long. Some lacing left towards the top of the glass. The smell is just light malt, I was expecting some hops to be showcased but nothing really. The taste is of mainly bready, cracker type malt, the hops are very subtle. Sweet, slightly tart, and the mouthfeel is definitely light and smooth. Not harshly overcarbonated like I've come to expect from some lagers or pilsners in the past. It doesn't pack the most flavor but it goes down really well."
"D - This is, admittedly, not my cup of tea. That said, this is a really good example of the style that leans towards the spicy saaz hop side of the fence. A damn good brew."
"An OK beerIm sure it has its boosters statesideIm probably going to pass on purchasing another."
"Tastes nice and crisp upfront, a slight hop kick and an extremely bitter finish. Very understated upfront but the bitterness at the end makes this one a little difficult to finish. Needless to say I had a second one. Still a very good beer with a kick, not boring at all."
"Bottle. This was a surprise for me. I am not sure what I expected but the beautiful color (sort of a gold with a hint of orange), big white head, and gentle hop and malt odors get you off to a good start. Easy going down, with no bad tastes at any point. Very easy to drink. This is a very good pilsner in my opinion."
"This beer aint bad but nothing I would buy again.Im glad I only have a 6 pack of it and not a full case.I would recommend it but I wouldnt have it any time soon."
"Not a great style example and not a great beer."
"An above average example of the style. Not the up and down malt-to-hop explosion of Victory's, but close."
"This brew poured a very clear straw honey color with a medium head. Lacing was a medium to minimal, while carbonation was very high throughout. Smell is very weak of citrus and a bit of banana. Nothing very powerful at all in terms of odor. Taste is very bready with a bit of lemon and butter. Mouthfeel is very clean and crisp. Would love to have this on a warm summer day. Balance is a bit off because of the extreme carbonation, but drinkability is definitely there because it's so light and refreshing. For sure a session brew."
"Drinkable? Sure. Forgettable? Sure. Not too bad, but misses too much of what I look for in a pils."
"A solidly average beer."
"Not the most amazing of beers, but overall it's still a good beer."
"Carbonation is minimal. A little heavier in mouth feel than water, but not much."
"I got a biscuity taste with a leaning more towards the sweet malt side of ripened fruit. Not overpoweing, but present.This one was crisp on the tongue and nevertheless refreshing."
"D: Nope. Not enough of that pils flavor to even be passable in my book."
"A tasty brew. I find most pilsner to be rather lifeless. However, this one is full flavored with an interesting character. Excellent bready malt and floral hops. Flavors are balanced and unified. A great Czech pils that I will return to again. Recommended."
"The beer pours a gold color with a 1/2"" white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a malty scent that boasts of pale and Munich malts along with a slight hoppy aroma. The malt aroma is a bit much for a Czech pils which are usually a bit lighter in character. The taste is decent also. It has a rich, pale malt flavor that goes down easy, but not as easy as it should. It is a full bodied beer, when most are traditionally low bodied and a bit hoppier in the flavor and aroma. This is a good drinking beer, but it's a bit out of style."
"Pours a bright golden orange, with brilliant clarity. Fizzy two finger head settles to a cap of rocky foam showing good retention, and leaves weak spotty lacing. The malt owns the aroma of Pilsener malt and dextrin; some German hop tones in the background. Flash of sweet lager malt followed by a sharp Pilsener mate bite, and finally a very faint toasted nut/buiscuity flavor. Semi-drying aftertaste, the spicy and floral Saaz hop is in effect here, both in flavor and bitterness. It balances the malt, but falls short of grabbing your attention the way a true Czech/Bohemian Pils should. Light-ish mouthfeel with high-medium carbonation, seems to draw some depth and texture from the full malt profile. Finishes clean, with only mild residual malt and fading noble hop character. A great drinker, but could be disapointing if you were looking for a classic Pils. This would be outstanding if the hops were as rich as the malt."
"This beer pours a hazy gold with a thin head. Not as much carbonation I would expect, but I'm not overly familar with the style. Aroma is slightly grainy with a twinge of hops. Kind of like a macro lager but with noticeable hops. Taste is a nice light maltiness followed by nicely balenced hop bitterness and flavor. The hops are slightly citrusy and herbal. This is definitely a solid drinkable beer, great for a party or to introduce to non-BAs."
"Eric"
"Overall a very easy to drink and tasty Pils, maybe the best I have ever had."
"I was hoping for a nice crisp pils as I have respect for Lagunitas and while this beer was good, it wasn't nice a crisp. The malt profile was bland sweetness at first that warmed up to bready pilsner malt. There was also just a hint of grassy hops. Sure its inoffensive and tastier than your average macro pils, but this is nothing to rejoice over."
"Pours a bright golden color with decent carbonation and a very small, creamy white head that diminishes quickly. Nice, crisp aroma of spicy saaz hops, light pilsner malt, and a touch of Euro yeast. Palate is a little heavier on the malt than most pilsners, indicating maybe a heavy use of carapils malt. Assertive, spicy hop profile smacks of saaz and other noble hops. Body is somewhere between creamy and foamy, depending on how careful you are with your sipping. A nice, easy-drinking pilsner."
"Another homerun Lagunitas!!!"
"Fairly drinkable, but Id probably choose something else."
"Drink again? Hell no. I look to pilsners for refreshment, but this was so far from hitting the mark it's not even funny."
"Not bad, but not classic. Not a must have, but not one to turn down either."
"Poured a golden honey color with a one finger head, which went away rather quick, no lacing. There was a noticable hop and light malt smell. The hop bite hits right away followed by a sweet malt flavor, then finishes with a dry hop taste that lingers. This pilsner is a touch maltier than others that I have tried. As a pilsner it has initial drinkability but the bitter dry aftertaste would limit me to only a couple. Not one of my favorite pils."
"Drinkability was decent because the beer tastes good but this in no way represents anything close to a Pilsner."
"The one drawback  and it's hardly the brewer's fault  is that $18.99 CDN is lot to pay for a six-pack. Otherwise, I could see drinking this often."
"Pours a sturdy and strong head with great retention. Lots of fast moving amid fast bubbles. A pretty amber color for a czexh pils, I like it. It's different. The most hoppy smelling czech pils I've smelled yet. I like. Still leaves room for the grass of the pils. The taste is still hoppy. But mixed very well with the crystal malts required fro a true pils. I really like the lack of skunk like flavors. A great Cali take on a Bohemian classic."
"Not a bad U.S. pils, and would make an ideal warm weather beer. Maybe drinking it will make me forget it's below freezing outside."
"Nice apple juice golden in colour, no head forms. A little musty in appearence. Aroma offers a fair (not distasteful but certianly far from favourable) malty character, with some biscuity dimension. Body is dense as result of good amount of malt used. Fairly good presence, carbonation on the high side. After my lager tour in Eastern Europe (through Poland and the Czech Republic) I'm fairly fine with saying this is one of the better North American drafts at this pilsner style. Tastefull enough. Lack of hops but with a small snap of bitterness on the finish. Stays clean, makes for good drinking. Fine enough. Thanks Harry!"
"D- a very drinkable beer, nice, light, refreshing, a good session beer"
"Gold color , clear  frothy thick white head nose is grains, grassy , cereal, hopps , malts , and slight cat urine , very clean - taste of grainy , grassy , sweet ???? , hint of coco , hops , and malts  dry slight bitter mouth feel  skunky , cereal , bitter , grass , sweet red fruit aftertaste"
"On atap at the Pizza Plant on Main,poureda ligh sprtizy golden with a thinner white head seemed pretty heavily carbonated from the pour,muted aromas I picked up some toasty grain with some light residual sweetness.Decent sturdy flavors leaning on the malty side lightly sweet and grainy a light herbal sharpness in the finish but it doesnt really stand out.A nice quaffing pils pretty basic the light herbal finish makes it better than the standard lager beer but I wouldnt say its a premium Czech style by any means."
"Overall, this one was a bit more hoppy than what I was expecting, although it's been a while since I've had a Czech Pilsner, so who knows. Anyway, besides that, there's not much that stands out about this one, to me at least. Solid, but nothing spectacular - it's just a normal Pils, and sometimes there's nothing wrong with that."
"This is a nice refreshing pils."
"It's fairly flavorful and fairly enjoyable, but it's nothing special. While it has a couple of bright spots, it's also think like an old sock too. Thankfully it does taste better than an old sock, however. Simply, the sparseness weighs against it. So when all is said and done, I guess I'd have to say...it's fair."
"Drinkability: See previous two categories. If you're like me, you probably became disassociated with pilsners when you discovered the quality and complexity of most microbrewed beers. Me too. Problem is it's about 4,500 degrees in the shade in Southern California right now, and the hearty ales I cling to during the fall and winter months just ain't cuttin' it. Hefeweizens taste great, but are too filling & gaseous. If you feel what I'm talking about here, than I think this beer will get to you. I'm going to get another..."
"D: Hell yeah -- very drinkable. Nice flavors all around."
"Overall a decent drinkable pils. Glad I tried it, but there are many better versions out there."
"This beer pours a reddish gold color with a large white head. A nice looking ""hardy"" beer for a pilsner. The smell is a nice mixture of floral, malt and ""bisquity"" yeast. The taste is a little thin with malt and floral flavors. The m/f is light with the malt and hop bitterness not mixing well at all. There is a very metalic taste to this beer that's not pleasing. A beer that started out well finishes poorly. I don't think I'd buy this again."
"D- very tasty with a gorgeous mouthfeel, highly enjoyable. I'll be looking forward to this again."
"Pours a dark gold hazey and inviting leaving a spotchy white head that quickly disappears but one swirl quickly brings it back. The aroma is fruity, hop spiciness, that is very clean and brisk. The taste starts crisp with a hop bitter twang that finishes with a honey malt backbone for balance. This is a refreshing brew...I will def visit this offering again."
"Overall impression: Nicely balanced, very drinkable - I wish more American brewers put out Pilsners of this caliber."
"This is a great transitional beer for Bud/Miller drinkers. I've got people who don't even like beer drinking this stuff!"
"D- This beer is mostly about the big bitter flavor with little depth in the hops and not much malt flavor to balance it out."
"All in all a pretty good beer and a very nice pilsner. Another good beer from Lagunitas."
"It's golden. It smells like a very tasty pilsner, not a regular pilsner. It tastes like a very hoppy malty pilsner, which isn't really what a pilsner shoots for but it's pretty decent. It feels great in the mouth and is pretty easy to drink and enjoyable to imbibe. Overall this is a pilsner worth a try but isn't really all that special compared to some others out there."
"Overall a good pils and a decent beer."
"Drink up. This is one of a few non-macro Pilsners I've had, and I now I'm really starting to see what it's supposed to be."
"Tasting notes --breaddy and biscuitty --nice malt upfront very pleasant hop finish -pleasantly carbonated --good mouthfeel--this is an excellent pilsner."
"Very, VERY drinkable....this one goes as nice as SNPA for drinking all day long."
"Clear gold with a bronze hue topped by a fluffy white head. Decent retention, a bit of lacing. Crackery, fresh grain aroma with spicy saaz and a bit of fruity hops. Medium bodied, malty flavour with moderate bitterness and quite a lot of spicy hop character. Light dryness with a bit of spicy tingle in the finish. Crisp and refreshing, with moderate carbonation. Pretty good, about what I expect from Lagunitas. It's got a nice hop depth to it as well."
"D - Good ""hot day"" drinker if you don't mind the over the top hops."
" Enjoyable, but there are many other domestic pilsners that I prefer over the Lagunitas Pilsner."
"The bright yellow body pours crystal clear, with an explosive head that mellows to somewhat more than a rim after a couple minutes. Smells crisp and floral, with hints of lemon and a slight metallic tinge. The taste is solidly malty, crisp yet full, and the Saaz hoppage is right on the money. Slight floral taste with a clean, stiff bitterness to round out the sip. There's something about the malt character, though, that's just a touch off -- a bit of toasty, New Belgium character that I wouldn't expect in a pils. Still, that's very slight and aside from that this is a great, drinkable beer."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is light bodied. The beer has ample carbonation. The beer is a very easy to drink. I enjoyed this beer from start to finish."
"Bright,somewhat hazy with a solid, fluffy white head on top. Low aroma-more or less says ""beer"". Very non descript. Mellow, sweet malt flavor. Nice slight touch of bitterness. Has the delicate softness in the flavor you will find in a classic pils. Decent enough mouthfeel. Good beer-I would try again."
"Pours a clear gold color, thin off-white head, lots of active carbonation bubbles, no lacing. Nose is a nice simple bready malt with some slight grassiness. Taste starts out with a fruity malt,mainly apple, and then rather abrubtly ends with a strong grassy bitterness. Medium bodied with a moderate/high carbonation. Overall, this is a decent pils, but nothing special."
"Golden yellow, effervescent, creamy one finger head. Smells alive and hoppy, resinous. Taste is maltier than expected, husky, but dead ends quickly into a rather herbal hop flavor with a sourish, odd, and longlasting aftertaste. The more I drank, the less I wanted to. The aftertaste was hard to get rid of, and haunted me for a few hours afterward. I tend to like a good pilsener, but this didn't do it for me, to say the least."
"This darkish yellow pilsner pour with a nice, white head. The aroma is redolent of grasses and wildflowers. The taste is clean and refreshing, with some sweet malt notes coming out on the tip of the tongue and Saaz bitterness on the back. Overall, the taste was clean but not terribly interesting. I'm not a huge fan of pilsners, but I've had a few that manage to be true to the style, clean and refreshing, but also interesting. Sadly, this beer isn't in that mold. Outside of a smooth and crisp mouthfeel, there's not a heck of a lot to recommend this. There's nothing at all to NOT recommend it either; it's a fine beer. Just not terribly interesting."
"Hazy dark orange, I might have let some of the sediment make it through, with a medium head, ultimately leaving a ring and some broken islands of bubbles. Smell is bready malt, bakery sweet, but no hop presence. Mild, clean malt hit at the beginning turning soon to a crispy bitterness. A little rough in the finish, but nothing overpowering. Light bodied, but not crispy enough to be memorable. Easy to drink, nothing to refuse. Try it if you like the style."
"A bold beer. If you like in your face brews, this will be a nice choice. If your looking for a pilsner that is floral, flavorful but delicate, seek out Pilsner Urquell or Brooklyn's Pilsner."
"A really nice Pilsner, and another great introductory brew. I would personally serve it at ten or so degrees above fridge temp, where the flavors seem to be more subtle, which ups the drinkability pretty darn high."
"A nice drinkable lager but not quite the light refreshing Pils I'd hoped for."
"Extremely drinkable beer. Tasty and mild mannered with a go shot of hop bitterness, recommended."
"Overall, an above average pils (not my favorite style). It's much more bitter than I'd expect."
"I picked up hoppy/saaz, even slightly floral, right off the bat. malts were subdued and more of a filler. light fruitiness mostly orange. perfect carbonation. tasted the yeast I've come to expect in this style but this was lighter in that department and more of a hopped up spicyness that was enjoyable and easy on the palate. Crisp mouthfeel that finishes moderately dry. Not the thirst quencher nor the session beer that one might expect this has some characteristics that make it more compatible with a meal than a session. A very respectable offering from Lagunitas."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"I've really been digging this style recently. I've definately come to appreciate the refreshing crispness of a nice zesty pilsner, and this one didn't disappoint. Pours a clear and bubbly blonde with some straw coloring and a pinky of white head floating atop. Smells of nice mellow Czech malts and a dusty hop smell. Taste is more pronounced than in the smell and does not let you down. I love the way pilsners are hopped - spicy, dusty, floral, herbal... just downright zesty. This one also had a nice pine characteristic which I think must be a west coast twist on the style. Very interesting, but not overdone. Very subtle. Lightly sweet grainy malts back up the hops perfectly, excellent balance. Smooth, crisp, mouthfeel. Again, excellent. And I find pilsners to be super drinkable, especially in hot weather, so drink em while you can!"
"By the way I reviewed this beer as a particular style, It seems that pilsners tend to get rated lower due to their lack of complexity or their closeness in relation to macros. Even in the world of Pilsners Czech style is a bit different from everything else out there."
"Crisp; perhaps thats the best way to describe this pils. Nice gold color suitably carbonated but it produces a poor head. Excellent grainy malt flavor but balanced very well for an American pilsner. Kudos for Laguntas for making a solid pils in California!"
"Taste was malty and hoppy again, a bit bitter. Tastier than expected after the smell. A little bit of breadyness in there, and orange, which sort of fits, and sort of doesn't. Good, but not extraordinary. Mouthfeel is okay, and pretty darned drinkable. Light, refreshing, goes down easy. I'll have to try this guy again in the bottle, see what it's like there."
"Remind me to pick up a six pack."
"This pils poured a clear, golden color with creamy, white foam that persisted a while and left some lace. There was a good carbonation from the bottom of the glass. The smell was bready malty with light noble hops. The taste was bready malty with moderate hoppiness. The mouthfeel was smooth and dry and crisp with medium body and good carbonation. This was a decent pils, but on the mild side."
"put this up there near dortmunder gold as one of the best lagers kicked out by craft brewers."
"poured a hazed light gold with a puffy white cap. Delicate aroma ; gainy, light sweetness but without the floral skunk of the CZ pilsens. Wow, peppery-bittering blast with subtantial malts and tangy citrus hops...malty bitter but not what I would call dry. Nice twist on the style...this is a pilsner for ale heads that live for hop alpha oils..actually it has more ale traits than Pilsner but who cares..it works."
"Golden color clouded with chill haze. Thin white head that is maintained by the vigorous carbonation. Nice lacing on the glass for the full beer. Smell is grassy with mild citrus note. The most noticable tastes were the malt sweetness up front and the hops bitterness on the backend. Light body and smooth finish. An easy drinking summer brew. Nothing stands out but no noticable flaws either."
"This one pours out pretty increduously, making that fizzy pouring sound you always hear in the commercials. A nice fluffy head forms atop the golden straw colored body. The smell is clean, with a touch of grain and a buttery character. Good, crisp aroma. Taste starts sweet, with that grain taste that was noted in the nose. A bit of hops kicks in, imparting a spiciness to this one that is reminiscent of thyme or oregano. Buttery flavor underlies all this, giving it a sweetness that is pleasurable but seems out of place, but I've read it's not uncommon. The carbonation is pretty low after the initial pour. Light bodied and smooth, very clean and refreshing."
"This is a good full bodied pils that is crisp clean and very easy to drink. The one thing it lacks is the real saaz hops off the nose. I must say that I prefer their ales but after tasting so many lagers locally that are only a better alternative to a macro lager, the fact that this beer has taste is appreciated."
"Pours a rich gold color that is brilliantly clear. A cascade of carbonation bubbles rises up through this beer and holds aloft a frothy, rocky head that is initially four fingers thick. As I pour this beer I get a hint of aromatic lemon & herb scents. As I go in for a deeper sniff I get notes of grass, a bit of hay and sweet grain as well as the afore mentioned lemon and herbal notes. The taste is lightly sweet up front and fairly spritzy throughout from the ample carbonation. The hops play a strong role here, they bring a spicy herbal note that blends in a hint of lemon pepper, a dash of hay, and . This is a nice example of a Pils, it is refreshing and simple. There is a bit of malt sweetness here, that keeps this beer from being dry, that balances well with the hops."
"Drinkability- Ehhh, I've had better pils along the way. No need to try this one again."
"This pils poured a golden yellow in color with a lovely beady peach-tinted head. I found the nose quite invigorating, a smell of fresh malt. Immediately I notice a very good balance in the mouthfeel and it is certainly juicy. There are some corn flavors there but they are subtle. Mostly the purposeful floral accent serves as a welcome dulling effect. The finish keeps balanced and quenching. It leaves a little bit of a peachy and a kind of light rosey essence. Really wonderful. This is a great social brew and very well done for the style. Cheers!"
"Pours a white, two finger-head that goes slowly leaving a decent lace. Clear amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is slightly hoppy. Starts with more malts than hops but sweetness fades to a slight bitter finish. $1.60 for a 12oz from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Edit: 3 days later try again...and it's tastes really good. I dunno this is more of a drink at a bbq out of the bottle than think about too hard type of beer. Also i'm pretty sure these are skunked bottles."
"Finally a Pils that I like! This gem poured a little darker than most pils with a very faint orange tint to it. The head was nice and frothy and settled into a nice pillow of foam for the rest of the session. The smell is actually pretty malty sweet, with a hint of carmel malt and light grassy undertones. The taste blew me away! It had a nice dry saaz and citrus bite in the beginning along with a nice malt sweetnes in the bakground that lends a little bit of thickness to the body, and a nice flavorful finnish that left me wanting another drink. This is the session Pils for me! A must try!"
"Not my choice for a pils!"
"Lagunitas Pils is a strange one. It drinks like a cross between an amber and a pils with some off-putting diacetyl thrown in for bad measure. This beer isn't horrible, but it needs a complete overhaul (read: recipe change) before I'll give it another chance."
"Had three of these the other night at 'bones. I thought it was very good, especially for an American take on the style. Pour when served was the color of golden yellow sunshine, I enjoyed the snow white head on top. It left many, many rings in my glass as I drank it down. The low aroma was a bit appley/citrusy. Clean, crisp initially, it had some grainyness in the finish, but only a touch. Very smooth, great session beer."
"A fine pilsner is the palette cleanser of the beer world. You can drink one after almost any other beer, and uncover all of the subtleties it has to offer, and move on to the next style to do the same. The Lagunitas offering pours a bright gold, clear with a thick white head refilled by champagne bubbles. The nose is a crisp hop citrus backed by a mild caramel from the malt. The taste is a refreshing hop citrus. Hints of grapefruit accented nicely by subtle hop flower. There is just a hint of malt on the finish. Smooth mouth feel, very drinkable."
"Most likely the lightest beer Ive had from Lagunitas. Still decent never the less. Had a very thin head on the pour with a lot of small carbonation bubbles. Very easy to drink, something you might suggest to a not so experimental beer drinker. The cez style gave it an easy to drink golden flavor. There are hints of wheat with an over all refreshing taste to it. Not a beer a would drink at warmer temperatures, keep this one cold. I think the pilsner category limits the things they could have done. Nothing out of the ordinary but still a good lightly hand crafted beer."
"Clear and honey golden with tons of carbination seen rising up to the thick cap of heavy egg-shell foam. The rich milkshakey head left a ton of lacing, but reduced down to a good capping. Very nice aroma with surprising strength to it, can catch it from a few feet away, very malty and sweet. Nicely pronounced flavors, good bite of peppery hops and caramelly malts. Good bitterness left in your mouth. Crisp and sharp flavors. The carbination feels good, it is just enough, I thought it would be too much from all I could see going on, but it was just right. Very drinkable pils, great session with good flavors and feel to it."
"Bottle. Tinny, rusty flavour, bit of saaz and grainy malts, not much else though, short finish. I really wasn't a fan of Lagunitas, perhaps their beers are better on tap, i don't know, but all the bottled version i had while in the US were a little underwhelming. Dissapointing."
"Mouthfeel was medium with a creamy texture, if anything, it might of been too creamy. I would of liked to see the hops really stand out in this brew, but just didn't come through. Decent, but not worthy of being in regular rotation."
"This has to be one of the most enjoyable pilsners I've ever had, stacked like a brick house, but dressed stylishly all the same, no tube top or hot pants necessary to sell this uptown girl. A well bred lager, actually worth the hefty import price tag I shelled out for. I'll be back for more, and will bring flowers and chocolates."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1"" white head over the clear golden brew. Foamy head lasts, and exhibits very nice lacing. Aroma is lightly of pale malts and crisp hops. Taste is upfront sweet pale malt, which then switches abruptly to a nice hops flavor. Mouthfeel and drinkability are excellent. Wonderful example of the style."
"Suprised to find this uncommon one on tap at a BBQ spot in NYC, Blue Smoke. Poured cloudy, medium straw in color, white 1/2 inch tiny bubble head, and displaying well developed fine lacing. Nose of powdered sugar, and bread. This is light to medium bodied hoppy, crisp and refreshing Pilsner. Palate cleansing lager, which went well with the BBQ. Not much of a finish, sort of petered out to wateryness. Servicable sessioner."
"A bit on the sweetish side, for my taste in pilsner beer. I'd prefer something a bit hoppier, but the softness of the mouthfeel is spot on for a czech version. I'm guessing this is hopped with something besides saaz, because I'm picking up some strong floral notes, perhaps a bit of citrus. Perhaps one of the north american saaz crosses? Who knows. Either way, it's nice stuff. I'd like to try this on tap sometime. I imagine it would be a good session."
"Mildly crisp mouthfeel at the start and finish, where other pils are more crisp than this. This was also a little heavier in body than other pils. Overall a slightly above average brew."
"Not sure if I've ever had a non-macro pils, but I do remember not liking macro pils. But this is pretty good and may alter my thoughts on pils. The beer poured into the glass a tawny yellow in color, with mild carbonation. A head formed on top about to finger-widths deep, that quickly dissipated. After each sip a thin lace would form, but the disappear before the next sip. The aroma is bitter, which comes thorugh with a nice bitter and sour hoppy flavor. There was not much else with the beer's flavor. Really it would make a great thirst quenching drink. The only negative was that the hops were pungent enough that when I burped I was kind of taken back by own breath."
"This poured out a hazy golden yellow with about a half-inch of white foam head floating on top. Some lace was left around the glass as this was consumed. Aroma was mainly just biscuity malts. Taste was crisp with bready type malts and a slight sweetness. Very mild beer all around. Body was about medium and well carbonated. Decent brew overall but nothing special."
"The taste was much like the smell sweet with a very clean taste. Crisp in the end with a bite of bitterness. Very impressed for a pils!"
"Very well crafted example of a German pilsener by a good, California brewery. Nice balance, and enjoyable drinkability."
"This is a fine pilsner. Pours a golden yellow with orangish hue. Head is very impressive, coats of lacing cover the glass. The smell is strong of thick malts, slight grain detected, a refreshing cascade pine hops detected as well. So unlike the pilsners that most are used to, this one uses a great blend of hops that really stand out, the smooth crisp sweet caramel malt is impressive, hints of grain. Medium bodied and very good. A great beer for sessions or those football games."
"12 ounce bottle. A tasty beverage, but the corn aroma detracts."
"This is a very drinkable session beer at 5.5% alcohol. I emailed the company and asked. They said they didn't like advertising the ABV because they ""don't want it to be seen as a strength claim."" Whatever that means."
"The smell is a bit hoppy, which isn't bad for a change. The taste is of the same, but a little acidic as well. It doesn't sit very well on my tongue, but it's still reasonably drinkable."
"Clear, golden orange. Medium, off-white head, a bit dirty looking and weakly carbonated for a pilsener. Stong wheatiness to the nose, with some brad notes and floral hints. Flavor starts a bit acidic and becomes very dry in the aftertaste. wheat takes a step back in the flavor, allowing the hoppiness to come right out. Bold hops, but overall thin taste, and not very traditional for a pilsener. I know Lagunitas likes to go off the beaten path, but this time I think they just went askew."
"I found this to be a pretty tasty pilsner that went down fine. It just didn't quite hit the mark in terms of the style. It's taste profile seemed to be leaning too much in favor of malty sweetness, sacrificing the hoppy notes I've come to associate with the style. It also wasn't as dry and crisp as most other pilsners I've sampled. While it's a good beer, I'm not sure it fits the style."
"Appears a glowing orange golden hue with a magnificant sized white head leaving very fine lace behind great looking brew. Aromatics are malty with some Saaz backing the nice malt characater up some grassy notes very nice with some bready yeast tones hanging around as well from the bottle conditioning. Taste, upfront bready with a great finishing zesty peppery hops but a smooth vanilla like malt character ties everything together. Mouthfeel is light to medium in body decent carbonation and one very drinkable beer to boot, tasty and refreshing a winning combonation every time."
"Light gold color, medium foamy head. Aroma is malty and a little hoppy. A full-bodied pilsner. Malty and somewhat hoppy. Touch of sweetness at the start that gives way to a fairly strong hop bitterness. Good flavor throughout. Well balanced. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is smooth and dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Comments: Rather enjoyed this and would happily have it again."
"Lagunitas may be coming in to its own. I do not regularily drink pilsners but this one is very good. If only the macros could understand this beer we would not bash them so much. I will definately try more of thier beers soon."
"Again, far too thick and sweet...nice try, but you missed."
"A most wonderful beer to drink..best from this brewery I have tasted..unsusal for a west coast brewer to do great lager"
"Poured from a short 12 ounce bottle, it a crystal clear yellowish gold with a big foamy white head. The head dimishes but leaves a thin layer on top of the glass all the way down. The Saaz hops are immediately noticeable, along with slight grainy aroma. The taste is nice, with a bit of hop bite and grassy flavors mixing well. The mouthfeel is what I'd expect in a Pilsener. As for drinkability, it's 100 damn degrees today, and this stuff goes down like water. This would be a good beer to lure macro drinkers to something better."
"Nose is sweet and corny with a large blazing hop aroma. The flavor of the beer is honey malty with a hop bitterness accentuated by a mineral character to the water."
"Slighly hazy dark gold color, a shade up from many. Fairly big head but flat on top and greatly diminished at 40 seconds. Simple but complete laces. Hoppy aroma, unmistakable Saaz qualities. The body was quite a bit bigger than I expected with a fleshy melon and caramel malt start and mid mouth impression. Hops bitter well and this brew is solidly balanced, though it swaps personalities and ends with some pine even in the aftertaste. Not a very light and crisp example of a Pils, more guts than style points on this one."
"A very nice Pilsener. This is a very crisp, clean tasting brew with a nicely balanced level of hops. The presentation is what's expected from a regional with clever naming and descriptions of the bottle contents. Poured a very golden color with a thick white head that had good retention. This is a robust Czech style with the emphasis on body rather than heavy hopping. A very enjoyable beer all round."
"From Hollingshead Deli in Orange, CA. I just can't get into these Bohemian/Czech Pilseners. Pours a hazy light orange color with a medium white head. Thin lacing and the head disappeared rather quickly. Aroma is mostly hops with a tiny bit of fruit. Flavor is mildly hoppy with a little malt backbone and a somewhat sour finish. Also has a very carbonated feel, but manages to not be very crisp at the same time."
"This pours a bright golden, like you'd expect a pilsner, with a nice amount of head and decent retension. The smell is definately pilsner, with a hint of skunk (you know, the saaz through light glass smell). The malt profile is sweet and subtle. I'll have to remember this come summertime."
"Pretty decent brew from Lagunitas. Poured a medium straw, head retention was decent and lacing was above average. Malty smell highlighted by Saaz hops. Good smooth taste with decent hop bite.I really like the flavor of the Saaz. A very refreshing and drinkable beer. Could become a warm weather staple."
"Highly chill hazed golden orange in appearance. A clingy off-white head that barely skims the surface, but laces effectively. Fresh hop leaf aroma. Floral and spicy in nature. Almost full body. Not quite. Spicy and bitter taste. Doesn't taste like a good pilsner or dortmuder to me. There's actually a lingering bitter aftertaste that is tannin like and not pleasant. This is a below average beer. Along with their Imperial Stout, the only subpar brews I've had from Lagunitas."
"A big Thumbs Up to Lagunitas on this one. Na Zdravi!"
"Clear gold the color on the pour, the head, is a brilliant white, frothy, substantial, the lace nice sheets upon the glass. Nose is malt, lightly sweet, clean and fresh. The start is malt, somewhat sweet, the top is light, and the finish is eminently dry, perfectly acidic, and superbly hopped. A good session beer ""No Doubt", drinkable and ranks as one of a few ""Pilsners/Lagers", I deem acceptable to maintain a permanent place in my ""Stable"" of beers."
"Clear dark straw / light gold hue topped by a well retained, dense lace leaving head.  The pungent, grassy, (dry - hopped?) Saaz hop nose is ensued by sweet, hay - like grain notes.  Assertively hopped and quite malty-- it's not nearly as dry as other examples of the style.  Sharp, grassy hop flavor. Moderate to full - bodied for a Pils, w/ a somewhat viscous mouthfeel.  Finishes w/ a quickly fading bitterness.  Almost a good pilsner, but malt nuances were overshadowed by the slightly rough bitterness.  Tasty, but definitely not a subtle pilsner.  What else can you expect from Lagunitas?"
"A luscious pale gold in color, the head is frothy, big, some-what rocky, white in color. On the nose the aroma of hops, slight citric. On the palate the flavors are crisp with a delicate malty sweetness, good hop character, fruitiness, and balanced well. Overall a a fairly interesting Pilsner."
