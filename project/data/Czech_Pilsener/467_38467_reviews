"Pours a clear, gold color.  1/4 inch head of a white color.  Decent retention and slight lacing.  Smells of strong pale malt, hint of sweet malt, hint of hop, slight wheat, and slight yeast.  Fits the style of a Czech Pilsner.  Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level.  Tastes of pale malt, slight wheat, hint of hop, and a hint of yeast.  Overall, decent appearance, good aroma, and decent body."

"Pale  golden color. White head. Very nice aroma. Better than some pale ales. Not much hops, as expected. Easy drinking taste. Malts, with light hops present. This is a pleasant, well done pilsener, and is faithful to the style, but, personally, I prefer a stronger taste (which is why I don't often buy pils). Refreshing to drink. Matches up well against the classic European pilseners. I recommend it to those who are looking for an American pilsener."

"O - at 4.5%, this is a good but not great session beer. I could have a few of these, but it wouldn't be the most exciting session."

"Overall – It’s a pretty good Pilsener with a decent flavor, feel and look. Worth a try, but nothing to go out of your way for."

"D - Basically just a simple craft pils. All around, it's insanely drinkable and mild, but also lacks depth and complexity. That being said, this style doesn't typically boast the most complex beers anyways. Some reviews on here imply a lack of hop flavor in this brew, but I certainly taste enough to qualify this as a Czech pilsener. A tasty and refreshing lawnmower beer at worst."
"Final Thoughts: I'm not sure this beer deserves the status of being a year-round brew by Summit. It does the job but definitely doesn't leave me wanting more. However, this beer is never out of place at a summer picnic or backyard barbecue."
""
""
""
""
"This isn't a Czech Urquell, but it's pretty damn close. I think it's a good summer beer. Like most Summit beers this baby goes down smooth. I listened to some great ambient music by Erik Wollo ""Imaginary Landscapes"" which should be considered a classic."
""
""
"This wouldn't be a bad choice on a hot summer's day."

"O -- I find this closer to a German Pils than Czech, though the hops are light. This is a highly refreshing and drinkable beer, but the lacking malt character and low hop character in the flavor, plus the off characters, keep my marks low."
""
"Pilsener pours a typical golden color, with a nice size lasting head, and plenty of carbonation bubbles. The smell while not strong did have skunk like qualities. The taste was pleasant, rather light, had a nice mellow straw like flavor, a few hops, and was actually a bit sweet, but the aftertaste isn't that great. While easy to drink, that aftertaste would stop me from getting more. Overall a pretty nice pils, nothing spectacular but has some good qualities."

"Overall - It's a beer that you'd drink when you're fishing with your buddies over the weekend. It's not an awful beer, but there are much better Pilsner brews out there."
"Overall, a pretty average pilsner that suffers from lack of peppy Saaz hop flavors and a lackluster nose. Honestly, I'd take Beck's or Bitburgur over this any day, but for $10 for the 12-bottle variety pack, it's hard to complain. I would buy the variety pack from Summit again and happily drink these, but can't really see myself purchasing just this."
"I shared this beer with a friend who only drinks macro beers, and he was apprehensive the summit pils would have way too much flavor. After tasting the pils, he agreed he'd still rather drink his corona or bud lite, but was quick to admit that there wasn't a great deal more flavor in the summit pils than what he normally enjoys in BMC. Sadly, I would have to agree with that assessment."
"Notes: Light and crisp, yet has enough flavor to make up for it. Creamy mouthfeel makes this Pils quite easy to knock back. Not my favorite brew Summit has to offer, but a solid effort nonetheless."
"Overall: Pretty standard, not a ton going on here."
"Drinkability: A tasty brew. Nothing too complex or pretentious Straightforward and flavorful drinking."
"Not a bad beer but nothing special either."
"For me, to be a top-tier pilsner, it needs to have the crisp hop bite. Summit Pilsener does not have this, as it is more malt driven. Having said that, I enjoyed this overall...and would gladly have again in the future."
"The final beer at Bliss today, one that wasn't really part of the tasting (you gotta love these guys, right?). It pours a clear pale straw topped by a finger of fluffy white foam. The nose comprises light lemon rind, wheat, grass, and flowers. The taste brings in more of the same, but this sameness is then invaded by a rather unexpected horde of corn. The floral hop notes helped to stem the tide a bit, but ultimately their effort was in vain. The body is quite light, with a light moderate carbonation and a crisp finish. Overall, a pretty nice pils, but the corny-ness didn't set well with me. Frankly, I was surprised to see this classified as a Czech pils, considering the lack of hoppy bitterness. I'd probably drink one o' these again, but it wouldn't be my first choice."
"Overall: A very solid take on a Pilsener from Summit. Sweetness and hop bitterness is well balanced."
"O: Another solid offering from Summit. The brewery is one of my favorites for their other offerings, but while solid, this one doesn't compare with others in same catagory. Pilsner Urquell and SANP have my vote there. Hard to find myself drinking this one on a regular basis because of this."
"I find this to be a really good pilsner. Great complexity in the flavor, while maintaining that refreshing crispness and dryness. Dang, this is good. Very refreshing, and ideal for the sweltering Minnesota summer."
"Of the three, my order of preference is 1) Pilsner Urquel, 2) Czechvar, and 3) Summit “Bohemian Style” Pilsner. The Summit and Czechvar are so close that it comes down to a matter of preferences. If you want a little more of the Bohemian malt flavor and Saaz hops, then go with the Czechvar. Taste wise, I think the Czechvar wins, but if appearance is more important to you, go with the Summit. If you want a cleaner tasting lawn mower beer, the Summit is great cold."
"Drinkability: Probably one of my least favorite of the Summit line. It's not a bad beer at all, but it's pretty unremarkable for the Pils style. I like the local August Schell's Pils much better."
"Beer is thin and watery with a grainy aftertaste and a biting minor bitterness with a mild aftertaste. The beer is pretty disappointing, a below average pilsner."
"Pours a sparkling golden color with a good fizzy white head that leaves some sparse, spotty lacing on the way down. The nose carries a lot of grain and some bread. Along with that are some light floral and herbal hops. The grain takes over the flavor as well, barely even leaving room for the slight amount of bready malt. Some mild herbal and floral hops in the background. Light body with fizzy carbonation and a bit of dry bitterness in the finish. Not bad, but quite average. Needs more noble hops and/or less graininess."
"Overall, this beer would be a ton times better if it didn't have so much skunk flavor. It was fine otherwise. Very easy drinking on a hot summer day."
"D- was average not great so many other pils to choose from that this one gets lost as a choice for me..it drinkable"
"Summit Pilsener was golden in color with good clarity. It had a white head with good retention and lacing. The smell was noble hops and some grain. The taste was light malt, grain, and hops. It had a dry, lightly bitter finish. The mouthfeel was good with a medium body and medium carbonation. The drinkability was good. This is a decent pilsener and worth a shot."
"By far, Summit's weakest beer. Not terrible, but not all that enjoyable nor is it a very good representation of the style."
"This is not my style at all, but I think this is a very solid pilsner. Easy enough to drink and actually has a pretty good hop dose for the style as well."
"The feel was very silky and smooth. The carbonation didn't bother it any, as it was very mild. Not watery by any stretch, but very easy to drink. The finish was extraordinarily clean."
"Overall just ok. It was left in my fridge so I figured I'd give it a shot. Not my favorite Summit but not bad."
"Good drinkability as well, a nice example of the style."
"D-I'm noticing a trend with Summit's Lagers: they tend to be on the low end of the carbonation spectrum. Normally I don't find this to be a problem with beers in general (I actually prefer it most of the time), but with these lagers it comes across as a something I really miss. That coupled with the complete lack of bitterness for me make this beer a miss."
"Notes: Not a bad beer that is fairly refreshing. Fairly hoppy and spicy and less malty than some others in the style. Pretty tasty on a hot day if you want a cheaper beer. Nothing outstanding, but good."
"Pours a pale/medium golden, with a nice big head of foam, that slowly fades, leaving significant lacing. Nice aroma, if a little faint, featurning hops and malt in fairly equal proportion. Taste is a bit less bold than I would have hoped for, with moderate hops flavor in the fore, but not much maltiness at all. Decent mouth feel, that could have used a bit more carbonation, but was still decent. Overall, a nice, drinkable lager, that would be especially good for hot weather."
"D - This is a worthy offering for the style, though I have had better. Makes for a tasty drink on a hot summers day, and I would never turn one down if offered."
"D - Another good brew from Summit, lighter bodied brew that I would drink more than a couple of. I recommend this brew"
"M/D: Lighter body. Higher carbonation that has some tingle. Drinkability is good, very easy to drink. Its definitely a refreshing beer. A gateway beer for a non craft drinker?"
"Overall this is a fantastic representation fo the style. Consumed on a hot day, been wroking outside all day and needed somthing to freshen up with...well here it is."
"D - The mineral addition going on is a lot to try and handle in this beer. It needs some toning down then everything might fall into place better."
"A very sessionable beer indeed."
"Just...OK..."
"Not the best Pilsner in the world, but certainly better and more flavorful than what most of this world call's beer."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Slow pour left no head, there was some lacing after the first few sips. The color is a pure yellow wheat color. The smell reminded me of that too, like wheat fields in late summer/early fall. Nice and comforting. This is something my grandfather, a non experimenting guy, would've drank. It's not bad, it's just that it has a traditional pilsner taste to it....a ""beer"" taste if you will. There was some bitterness on the tongue, but nothing to write home about. It has a light mouthfeel which would would lead to pretty high drinkability, although after a couple I'd want something with more taste."
"Nothing extraordinary here, but certainly nothing bad. This beer has pleasant flavors and is highly drinkable. A dangerous combination indeed."
"Lacks a bit of Saaz sass, but a good crossover beer."
"Overall impression: Nice drinkable beer - not sure this belongs in the autumn variety pack though. Seems to be a much better fit for summer."
"D: This is a pretty decent Pils. Its lightness makes it an easy drinker on a warm day. I'm glad I picked it up."
"Ah, much more lupulin goodness in the flavor. Strikes a nice balance between some husky graininess and a fairly intense, grassy hop bitterness. There are a few rough edges to the beer, but all in all, this is a well crafted and very tasty pilsner. I like it! Crisp, clean and refreshing. Well done Summit."
"D - A decent beer, but I tend to like my pilsner a bit more crisp and dry. I'd have it again, but probably not two in the same sitting."
"This lacks a bit of finesse to call it a classic example, but it works."
"D - This is a nice representation of the Czech pils style. Well done and easy drinking."
"D-I had a higher expectations for this one coming from Summit. Not one of my favorites from them. Just not enough balance and too much dry hop bitterness."
"D: A solid if unspectacular pilsner from a consistently good brewery"
"I think this is the same beer as the old Summit Grand, at least I can't tell the difference between them. Nice grassy pilsner, and a good thirst quencher."
"D: great session beer, can just keep on doing it. I also give it points for appealing to the masses, particularly BMC drinkers."
"Into a pint glass, pours a light golden color with a small white head, not much lacing. The aroma has plenty of grains, some light citrus and grassy hops, pretty nice but not too strong. The taste is very nice, lots of grains and wheat, some nice grassy hops and light citrus, maybe a little coriander and bit of pepper. The mouth is medium, feels light and airy with good carbonation and a smooth mouthfeel. Very, very easy to drink, this case went by fast. Fairly simple, yet complex enough to still be interesting after you've had a few, and light enough so as not to weight one down."
"Glad to see a well-made pils from an American craft brewery. Might not be ""perfect", but it is very good. Well-balanced, easy-to-drink, refreshingly dry (made me want another), as it should be!"
"One of the better American versions I've had. Definitely a decent option when considering a pilsener."
"D-Quite good. As I said, overall simply a good-tasting beer, and quite easy to drink. Thumbs up."
"D= very high. Ill be sure to seek it out again for a hot summer day to session on."
"Drinkability: Pretty good Czech Pilsner. I have certainly had better Pils, but in terms of all pale lagers (which I consider substitutes for one another), this is well above average."
"Presntation: Packaged in a short twelve-ounce brown glass bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Mouthfeel is thin and crisp, carbonation is active."
"Drinkability: Quite easy to drink, however the carbonation may become a factor after several..."
"Ultimately a pretty nice beer that neither stands out or falls into blandness either. On par with most American attempts, but German and Czech versions fare better because of better maltiness, attenuation, dryness, and less sweetness. Fresher hop varieties would improve as well."
"Drinkability - Despite the name, this is not quite a euro Pilsener. Summit beers are great, but they need to rethink this. More malt and less hops would be an improvement."
"D - Not much on the nose but then again there isn't always much with this style. I'd gladly have this again, its a decent pilsner."
"Mouthfeel is fine, appropriately carbonated. I'd just like some more spicy noble hops, please. At least Summit seems to have the head down in most all of their beers."
"D- This is an ok pilsner. Sessionable, yes, but honestly, dang near comparable to Miller Lite."
"Pale and clear lemon yellow body. The head is white and airy and wispy. Lace is delicately left in spiderweb like patterns. Nice bready malt aroma. Slight hoppy spiciness noted on the nose as well. Cracker like pils malt base on the palate. Hops impart a very slight noble like characteristic of spice. Just a little peppery. Good enough mouthfeel with the appropriate carbonation level. Body is light-medium to medium. While this is serviceable, I prefer their Grand over this."
"Pours clear and yellow with a flourish of white foam that settles to a thin layer, leaving some lace. Attractive. Smells very grassy.; almost skunky (odd for a brown bottle). Good hop spice character up front; herbal and pleasant. Malt profile is fairly simply, slightly toasted character. Feels smooth and not overly carbonated. Bitterness is present, but not aggressive or too tame. Very drinkable except for the odd skunkiness. I'm reviewing the bottle, but I recently had this on tap at The Muddy Pig in St. Paul and it was a little better. My wife thinks she detects adjunct (corn), but the brewery's web site says no...could be DMS?"
"Appearance is a brilliant pale gold with a long-lingering white head. Aroma has faint noble hops notes mixed in with some cracker hiding in there. Taste is a lovely dance between hop and pilsner malt but the finish is clean with a touch of carbonic bite on the tip of your tongue. Medium mouthfeel carries this beer and the clean finish leaves your thirsting for more. I could drink about 7 or 18 more of these. Yum!"
"Mouthfeel was nice as it was smooth, creamy and even a bit chewy for the style, I could sit down with a twelver of these any day~especially in the summer."
"drinkability is great. this is a solid pils with all the ingredients to make a great one. the hops are fresh, and the malts are not grainy or stale, which seems to be the case more often than not with these light lagers. cheers!"
"Pours a rich golden hue, nice finger of foam on the top. It's not overly gassy, so the bubbles are steady but not overly plentiful. It has a nice fruity, almost wine-like aroma, somewhat flowery and quite agreeable. The taste is pretty full for a light colored beer, with plenty of malts on the front and back ends, with a mild hops bite through the middle. It has a pretty thick mouthfeel as well, as there is sufficient carbonation to give it a thick, expanding feel as you take a swig. Overall, this is a very good beer in the style, especially for an American take, and with warmer weather ahead, this will be a staple in my fridge this summer."
"Final Thought: A nice pils from the Twin Cities, but a Victory Prima Pils can be had for about the same price, in addition to being shipped from about the same distance aways."
"The low ABV and light body helps drinkability but I would have liked more hops in this beer. Just bump it up a little bit and you would have a solid Pilsner, otherwise it is average at best."
"overall, this was a very good brew but i dont think that im going to buy it again"
"D - Drinkability is good. It does tend to disappear quick. Light body and low alcohol make it a brew that I could drink several of."
"This beer pours a clear golden straw color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into sparse lacing. The aroma is of a faint bready malt with an even fainter noble hop spiciness. The taste is of like the aroma. The mouthfeel is light bodied with a lot of carbonation. Ovearll, this beer tastes a lot more like a macro lager than Czech Pinsener. I will not drink this again."
"Overall Impression: Pils aren't normally my cup of tea, but I like this one. Maybe because it's off style. Website lists Horizon, Vanguard, and Saaz hops. I'm thinking this is closer to a Classic American Pilsner given the hops and mineral quality. Still, a rock solid beer worth a taste."
"When poured it is golden in color with a thick two to three finger white head. It almost looks like a typical pils, but something is different about this one. Right off the bat you can smell the grain coming through with little hints of hops and a little bit of fruit. In my first sip I caught the lemons and grains bursting through, but after a few more I picked up on a little bit of honey and hops. It is very crisp and refreshing on the palate. A good session beer, but a little to carbonated to drink too many."
"Overall pretty much your classic Americanized pilsner here, with the extra added hops and loads of carbonation. Not the best thing I have ever had but more then decent and I would have no issue at all in ordering up this one again, it was just a good solid call."
"A fine and enjoyable beer, though not in the category of Urquell, by my way of thinking/tasting."
"The taste was very good, I think it deviated slightly from the style however and I couldn't give it a 5. It just didn't have the stale hop finish that I have come to know and love."
"D-I'm having a hard time keeping this in my glass....bought a sixer tonight and 3 are gone while I write this....flavorful....drinkable....enjoyable...I think Summit is one of the most underrated breweries in the country. Sure there are some that are better but this group does not get enough credit...I enjoyed this."
"Drinks very easy, not the best example of the style out their, but no slouch either. Great bang for the buck"
"Overall I really enjoy this pilsner. It is very drinkable and would make a nice thirst quencher on a hot day. This would be a good cross-over beer for macro lager drinkers. I will definitely buy this one again."
"I could go for a bit more flavor but that really doesn't take away from the fact that this is one highly drinkable brew."
" ~ I can certainly see myself bellying up in a tavern and putting a few Grands away. I'd too let my friends know they should give it a try."
"A good drinker, hot day, with a burger or if your with the macro crowd, its good to pull out a stub-like bottle."
"EDIT: Was just informed that this is the same as Summit Grand. They just recently chanaged the name."
"Drinkability is great, I'll be having a lot of this on hot summer days."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Well its a fizzy yellow beer...extremely light in body. Alright for what it is. Easy to drink, but I won't be buying this again. Not something that is really all that great. Not bad, but nothing spectacular. I'm pretty neutral towards this one."
"D: Eh."
"Well, being a pilsner, I didn't expect much as this is not one of my favorite styles. I've had great pilsners however, very dry and refereshing. This one just missed all the cues for me. However, it wasn't bad. It poured with some head that went quick and left a small fizzy carb. Had the smell of wheat, very small scent, other than a odd sweetness. Mouth was an average beer, pilsner, with very little bitterness. Taste was an average American attempt at this beer style, it was sweeter rather than dry, the lack of adjunct flavors was a plus and there was a lingering ""stale"" aftertaste, something with the light malt and water that made this plain and simple. Drinkability is, well, it's not. I got this in a sampler and would not get it again. Average pilsner, a style where you need to taste exceptional for me to like it, but there are worse choices out there."
"Pours brilliant golden-straw in color, with a rocky white head of average duration. Noble hops, pale malt, and a bit of metallic tang on the nose. Sharp, sweet, and a bit tangy on the first sip, pale malts on the second. Mild hop bitterness lingers for a short while, but it's a very mild bitterness overall. The feel of this is light and very easy drinking, sessionable or ""quaffable"". There's a moment three quarters of the way through the palate where this verges on sweet dominating bitter, but it's about then that the nice dry finish kicks in and the overall impression is one of very good balance. I've had the Grand many times now and it's always impressed me more as a Czech pale lager than as a Czech/bohemian pilsener, and while I realize that's splitting some hairs, the American All-Malt Lager it's stylistically pegged at here seems overall favorable, that is, if all American all-malt lagers could strike the same balance that this one does. One of these days I'll make note of the characteristics on draft and re-review. This would be an excellent golf/camping/hiking beer if it were in a can . . ."
"Originally reviewed September 24, 2005. Poured from a bottle on the Beer Train. Clear deep golden, with white head. Distant malt aroma. Smooth. Even, yet slightly sour, over sumptuous wheat and malt. Not bad. Finishes a hint dry. Probably not bad for the style, but nothing to get overly excited about."
"Simple, but tasty beer. Tastes of biscuity malts with a kiss of hops. I see this is no longer listed as a czech or german pilsner, and I could go either way on weither it tastes more american or european. Hops are grasy, malts are grainy in a good way. Great lighter beer thats affordable, I usually go through a case over the summer."
"Well worth a try and a solid effort from the brewer."
"There is no head on this beer, it simply pours a nice golden color. Very pleasant taste, clean and malty. The aroma is all malt with a faint hops in the back ground. It has a full mouthfeel, mostly from the carbonation. I think this would be a great lawnmower beer, just a happy little refresher that'll keep you cool and quench your thirst on a summer day."
"Dnot a bad pilsner here, would work for the summer."
"Poured a perfectly clear golden color with modest white puffy head. Some lacing as the beer was slowly consumed. Smell is bread-like and slightly sweet. Taste has a slight maltiness, but also a somewhat metallic taste. Finishes with more of the metallic mouthfeel.. An OK beer, once you get past the metallic taste."
"This is a definatly enjoyable lager, a Minnesota best for sure. Well maybe not the best but still pretty good. It pours a nice golden hue with a well developed head and some mild lacing. Predominatly it smells of malts and fruits all on the sweet side. This beer provides a smooth taste and easy drinkablility. The beers sweet undertones give this beer a nice and rather unique finish. Give this one a try for sure."
"Poured a very pail yellow color into a standard pint glass with a slight white head that didn't linger for very long. I got a slightly sweet malt aroma from this one. Not much really to speak of in terms of complex taste. Pretty comparable to macro pilsners out there. Very light in body so maybe this would be a good summer beer or a beer to start someone out in drinking non-macro beers."
"Tasted: 01/18/06"
"Moderate straw color. Sweet malt aroma with the barest whiff of phenols. Indeed very Bohemian, with sweetish light malt flavor. Some reserved grassy and grape flavors. I'd have like just a bit more bite to clean it up at the finish. ""Grand"" oversells - how about ""Pretty Good?"""
"Appearance: Filtered golden straw hue bright white large head forms nicely in my conical v-shaped pilsner glass with each sip leaves thick clinging patches of lace, very nice. Aroma: Saaz and grassy citrus tones for this Bohemian style pils has a mineral note along with biscuit malts breadiness nice touch of hops here. Taste: Crisp flavor definitely a solid all around pils strong hop leafy flavor solid bitterness lightly toasted 2 row and bready pilsner malts, it mixes well here. Mouthfeel: Lighter body healthy carbonation crisp is a good word for the overall feel. Drinkability: I'd seriously pick up a case if going to a friend's house to watch a game or a party to convert Bud/Miller/Coors fanatics."
"Drinkability: A pretty decent beer. It isn't my favorite from Summit, but it beats the pants off a lot of similar beers - especially when it is the same price as macrobrews at sporting events."
"Considering Summit's reputation in the Twin Cities, I guess I kind of had my hopes up for this brew. By the end of the beer, however, I was enjoying it more than I was at first. For the style, this is good selection in my opinion."
"I upped flavor to a 3.5 as it started tasting better as the beer warmed up."
"An ""about average"" product from a quite remarkable brewery. I was surprised, and a little let down. I can drink a few of these, and not feel like I've had anything really memorable. And I love lots of their other products - specifically their pale ale and their porter. On the other hand, ""about average"" from Summit is still far better than the best from lots of other breweries!"
"Brilliant golden yellow with a dreary accumulation of fizz on top. Soft floral and mineral aromas are typical of chewy pale malt and reminiscent of various French farmhouse ales; I mention that only because I've been drinking boatloads of Castelain and 3 Monts lately. The comparison helps my opinion of this drink. There is very little in the way of minty, citric or resiny hops aromas, only a doughy, cracked kernel aroma and faint grass perfumes. On the palate bitter iron flavors pin down a very promising cereal and honey allure. Fine carbonation seems perfectly natural. In the end tiring, raw, tar flavored bitterness blocks any invitation to drink a sequence."
"Summit Grand is good, solid beer. It's a jack-of-all-trades brew that would go well with all manner of foods, yet could be enjoyed solo as long as one wasn't looking for anything even remotely special. It might not stand up to intense scrutiny, but what the hell, sometimes you just want to down a few, and it's more than adequate for that."
"I'm not a pilsner fan, but of the few I have tried, this is the first that doesn't bore me to tears. I'm not going to buy myself more, but if somebody handed it to me, I'd accept."
"Another in a line of stellar brews by Summit. Pours a nice golden hue and has a decent white head. It has a very malty aroma that is clean and very much Pilsener. The hops are hidden in the aroma, but definitely show themselves on the first sip, backing up a very heavy(for the style)body that is so malty that it is almost Marzen-like. This is a damn fine Pilsener and one that is worth a spot in anyone's refrigerator."
"Drinkability: Plenty good, but I just can't shake the sweetness. This is probably due in part to the fact I had this one sandwhiched between their IPA, followed by the Extra Pale Ale. A different beer, but still worthwhile."
"Clear, medium golden-yellow body with an excited, foamy, white head. Laces the glass politely. On the nose, light, crisp, honeyish malts contrasting with salty, spicy, and lightly Saaz-ish hops. Not bad. Taste follows along similar lines. The malt is light, grainy, faintly sweet, and most noticeable near the finish. Tart, lemon zest hops up front, and spicier, more herbal hop flavor in the finish. Plenty of carbonation and a dry finish make this a rather refreshing beer. I like it even more on draft."
"Overall, not a bad pils. Even though it's not my favorite style (it's one of my least favorites actually), I'd try this one again."
"A large Na Zdravi to BigHuge for shipping this Eastern style brew West."
"A fine pilsener, certainly one of the better American attempts. Summit brews some great stuff and this doesn't disappoint, though it's not quite what I'm looking for in an ideal Pils."
"Strikingly bright gold with a dense, frothy latte-like head. A torrent of carbonation steadily rises for quite a while. Quite clean in both aroma and flavor -- very little in the way of ""extra"" sweetness. Nose could be a bit crisper and is a bit washed out with flowery plants and malt. Mild grainy malt flavor. Malt is very tame -- but the hop presence is not terribly assertive, and there is no lingering hop flavor. Much more dominated by the malt than I might expect, though that's not to say that it's devoid of hop flavor. A mild, tingly spicy hop flavor enters the picture briefly toward the end. A very clean, drinkable brew."
"Lasting eggshell tinted head. Clear yellow-gold in color. A light lemony-citrus nose with grassy hay background. Malty backbone beneath a more than adequate hoppy bitterness. Husky graininess. Smooth yet dryish finish with residual bitterness. A nice session lager. Thanks CRJM for the bottle."
"High on the drinkability scale due to refreshing quality, not much in the way of superior flavor though."
"This beer poured a clear, light amber-yellow color with good bubbling action, and creamy, white foam that clung to the inside of the glass to coat. The smell was lightly malty with some grain and bread and a hint of hoppiness. The taste was mildly malty with good hoppiness, including a touch of floral hops and a hint of hop ""soapiness"". There were notes of grain in the taste as well. Overall the flavor was a bit thin. The mouthfeel was crisp with medium-light body and good carbonation, and a lingering hoppy aftertaste. This was a decent lager and was easy to drink."
"while not overpowering in terms of flavor, Grand is extremely drinkable. It's just hard to go very long between drinks. Light on the tongue, easy on the stomach, and leaves that subtle doughy taste in your mouth that is just perfect. an outstanding session beer and a very good pilsner."
"This is an above average beer for this type."
"Purchased a 12 ounce single for $1.50 in Omaha."
"Nice looking beer. Gold in color, with lots of carbonation visible. Nice amount of pure white head. Tastes very hoppy, with no hint of skunk at all. This is a pretty decent pilsener, much better than macros. I have come around about Summit, they make some pretty good beers."
"Medium gold color. Small white foamy head. Aroma is fruity and sweet. A medium bodied German Pilsner. Light malts are fruity and sweet. Hops are spicy and its fairly hoppy for a pilsner. Good balance. Lots of flavor. Mouthfeel is clean and crisp. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"This beer had a medium sized white head with fine-small bubbles that fully dissipated.The beer's body was clear with carbonation present.The hue was golden and the lacing was fair.The nose was malty and hoppy and the flavor was chewey, bitter, tangy, tart from start to finish with a lingering aftertaste.The mouthfeel of this beer was tingly, fairly smooth and medium bodied."
"Cheers to Budgood1 for the sample."
"Pours a clear golden color with a very small thin white head. The aroma consists of crisp hop notes with light grain that make your mouth water. The taste mimics the smell with a sweet tone and the crispness is even stronger. The hops are a hint of light black pepper that tapers into a dry bitterness. This is a light bodied brew that finishes slightly sticky to the tongue despite the dryness of the hops. All in all, this is a nice refreshing brew. Thanks to budgood1 for this! Cheers!"
"Fulgent, crystalline light golden hue. Persistent porcelain white head leaves fleecy lace. Soft, staple bready sweet malt accompanied by lightly floral hops with an herbaceous tinge in aroma. Clean, facile, pilsner malt sweetness is perceived incipiently and lingers until partially offset by perhaps overly gentle hop bitterness. Malt presence becomes doughy mid palate, and is contrasted by a subtle, grassy hop late. Crisp, brisk, pleasantly dextrinous, somewhat functional mouthfeel. Finishes brusquely and simple, with a brief snap of maltose and dry cracker. Summit Grand is strikingly clean and almost immaculate in overall flavor profile. Although devoid of flaw, it displays no true outstanding character. It treads between a dry German and maltier Bohemian pils in overall character. Definitely a fine brew for quick, effortless quaffing. Thanks to Felonioumonk for sending this my way!"
"12 oz bottle. Poured a hazy golden yellow, which cleared some as it warmed.Very little head, some fine lacing on the glass. Aroma of hops and malt. Taste is hoppy and slightly sweet. Weak carbonation, gives it a semi fizzy tingle on the tongue. Not a bad beer, but a little on the bland side. I keep waiting for something more that just isn't there. Still it would make a good lawnmower beer on a hot day, not filling but refreshing."
"The dry, bittersweet finish makes you feel like you should have another."
"I just got back from a days worth of landscaping in the hot sun. This was an excellent remedy for my hot self. A light, crisp beer, its a nice gold color with a bubbly white head, with lacing all the way down to the bottom. Its a bohemian style pislner, which means nada to me but some of you may know the difference or lack of one. The moral of the story is that its a pretty nice beer, goes good with summer weather."
"Pours to a clear golden color with a white head. Leaves a decent amount of lacing when sipped down. The aroma is of crisp hops and sweet malts. It has a nice crisp hop flavor and a clean malt flavor. It is a smooth, easy drinking beer. Not over the top in the malts or hops. A very clean beer."
"The prototypical lager/pilsner pour, an unblurred gold color, the head the archetypal bright white, frothy in texture, the lace a nice covering sheet upon the glass. Nose the quintessential malt, clean and fresh, crisp and quite satisfying as noses go. Start is typical malt, lightly sweet, the top middling in feel, finish purposeful in its acidity, the hops applicatory to the style, a nice thirst quencher and a fine session beer for those lucky enough to have access to this beer."
"Lively and hoppy palate, short, but pleasant finish. Crisp, snappy, and perfectly balanced. Everything is in proper order, and if I had nothing heartier at hand, this would easily be a lager of choice. Very tasty, with a touch of underlying sweetness. A perfectly put-together pils."
"Dark golden hue, a bit hazey, with a good, fluffy head. Smells lightly of malt with a bit of hop presence, very soft on the nose. Taste is a smooth offering of malty goodness, lightly put together with a paled hop bite. Could be a bit more bolder and bodied for this style, but was pretty good non the less. Has a good clean and smooth feel, a little light with a wierd, dry hop finish thats hard to nail down. Not bad, could be better good be alot worse."
"summit grand pours out a clear, dark golden colour. active carbonation produces larger than normal bubbles. a thin but thick head reduces down to a wispy lace. this bohemian style pilsener remains true to it's style with a light, grassy saazs hop aroma. pale malts shine through, too. taste is fairly malty, with enough body to produce a fairly full mouthfeel. a bit of soapiness and snappy hop crispness of the saaz variety add some nice flavor and character to this beer. while nothing ground breaking for a pilsnener, it's a nice rendition of the style. although filling, it's pretty refreshing and pleasing."
"The taste has all the hallmarks of a malty Czech-style pilsner, not easy to brew unless you can match the extremely soft water of Pilsen. This beer is smooth and malty, but with a very slight Saaz hop bite in the finish. Bur it is also rather bland. The beer is a decent domestic version of the Czech classic, but is missing a few things to make is special. I prefer Summit's ales...."
"Clear golden color with a small, short-lived head (only after a hard pour).  The aroma had a very high hops profile, as a pilsner should, with a slightly sweet malt aftersmell.  The flavor was also high in the hops department and again, not enough malt to balance.  As it warms, the maltiness starts to come through.  The high carbonation and long lasting flavor give it an excellent mouthfeel.  It is refreshing, but just an average pilsner."
"Suprising it comes from Summit."
"Thin head, about a 1/4 of an inch.  Very clear deep yellow.  Practically no smell, just a touch of bread to the nose.  Nice balance of malt and a definite hop zip.  A touch of a nutmeg flavor.  Light-bodied, pleasant taste, but a real quick finish in the flavor.  I'm sure this Pilsner helps Summit's sales and it is refreshing.  Won't lure me away from the Extra Pale, though."
"Wonderful mixed aroma with qualities of malt behind the wonderful Saaz hops.  Good frothy and creamy head that leaves rings as it is consummed.  Yellow-gold color that is clear shows a steady stream of bubbles throughout.   Mixed flavors with noticeable steady malt in front through the back, and finishes with a fairly long and dry finish that may be too much for some.  Mouthfeel is just right in medium area.  This is a really nice beer.  Not too rich so could serve well as a session beer."
