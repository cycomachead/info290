Taste is a more vibrant version of the the nose: pilsner malt, cracker/biscuit with lemony & grassy hops with bitterness & dryness developing in the mid-sip & intensifying through the finish & aftertaste where it lingers as a heavy & bitterness & astringency.

This is my third brew from this wonderful brewery and I must say they are quickly becoming one of my favorites. In terms of pilsners, Pilsener Urquell has always been the benchmark brew for me, and this one satisfies the cream corn and hopiness of the former while adding a decisively American fresh hop characteristic all of it's own to balance out the mix. I would not hesitate to seek this one out whenever I'm in the need of a good pilsener, and I will now pay close attention to what this brewery releases. Cheers!","kflorence","Jun 15, 2014"

3.82,-1,3.75,4.25,3.75,3.25,3.75,"The beer pours a pale yellow with a huge head of egg-shell white bubbles. The head mellows to a rocky terrain and sits approximately a finger’s width above the glass. As the head fades, it leaves fluffy, string-clouds of lacing. In body, the beer is clean and clear, except for a slight haze that clouds the other side of the glass. Constant streams of tiny bubbles can also be seen feeding the aggressive head of the beer. On the nose, the beer smells superbly hoppy, moving from fresh cut grass (hence the name) to juicy citrus, lemon peel, and even a ghost of herbal mint. On the tongue, the beer tastes decidedly bitter up front with a nice, mellowing, bready sweetness moving in with the middle and finish of the sip, though not balancing out the beer. The bitters taste decidedly grassy, with only hints of citrus coming through. Acidity is light in the mouth, but does give the beer a faint pop, as well. In flavor, the beer begins as bitter, fresh cut grass and pine, this moves into brief grapefruit before the crackery malt flavors start to balance out the sip. The finish is of bitter grass, grapefruit pith, and just a touch of salinity. In the mouth, the beer feels on the heavy side of light in body, with a smooth and creamy carbonation, definite effervescence, and a mouthfeel that is crisp, smooth, and slightly prickly. The mouth is left dry and astringent once the beer has left. Overall, this is an aggressively bitter beer, which I both appreciate and wish for a little less of. They captured the flavor of fresh cut grass rather well, but the astringency is a little too high, and the pilsner malt character is a little too light for my taste in the style. This is a good hoppy pilsner that should appease many a hophead, but as far as the style goes, it is a bit unbalanced.","Maxwell","Mar 15, 2014"

2.22,-42.5,4,2,2,3,2,"I assume this is what they were aiming for though, with a name like "Fresh Cut." Hop heads who want a hop-forward low abv beer that's crisper than an IPA will love it. Pilsner fans will not.","AlcahueteJ","Oct 06, 2013"

3.79,-1.8,3.75,4,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Simply put, delicious! There is a smooth light malt to back up a grassy, slightly skunky hop and yeast aroma. Frothy white head that fades to a nice sticky lace that lasts and lasts. Clean bitterness, a little bit of spice in there. Completely and utterly drinkable and refreshing on a cool sunny summer day.","thezach","Sep 12, 2013"
