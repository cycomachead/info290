"On tap.  Great palate cleanser or finish to a heavy meal.  If you like Ginger you will like this.  Some times you need a Pilsner style with bold flavors."
""
"Had on tap. Pretty excellent balance of pumpkin and ginger considering pumpkin is a light flavor and ginger can be so powerful."

"I got the cap off and poured for each of us, producing a finger of yellowish head with good retention. Color was a slightly hazy light-yellow (SRM = 2). Nose was redolent with ginger! It should have read ""... Brewed with Ginger and Pumpkin", instead. Mouthfeel was light, not thin, but very effervescent. The taste was almost completely ginger. Finish was super-dry with the ginger flavor actually ramping up in intensity at the extreme finish. Wow! This would be fantastic with sushi and as a palate cleanser, it was a welcome change of pace. However, I would recommend against an entire bomber to oneself (which I did not do, BTW)."

"poured into a glass, it has a hazy gold color body with a very little head. The smell is ginger. The taste is up front ginger and some spiceyness from the ginger. I wish the pumpkin would come through more. The mouthfeel is smooth and overall if you like ginger, you will like this beer. It is a good pilsner."

"If you don't like ginger don't drink this beer. If you do like ginger give it a shot and ignore the ginger haters giving this beer bad reviews. I wish the pumpkin flavor came through a little more strongly but all-in-all it was an enjoyable beer with a strong ginger flavor."

"o - Overall I wasn't a big fan of this one at all. The ginger and spices dominate, and there isn't much else to it. Wouldn't seek it out again."
"Served in a 16 oz pilsner glass at Pourhouse, Westmont, NJ"

"O: simplistic and a bit overpowering on the ginger, but not a bad beer."
""

"O- I really don't like ginger. That kinda ruins the whole beer for me. Sorry Elysian."

"It seems this is under-appreciated. It's flavors and essence steer a wide path from traditional beer flavors, but a slow and ponderous sip will still yield healthy notes of honey-sweet malts and earthy hops. Obviously, if you don't like ginger, forget about it, but if you like an occasional mule or ginger beer, you could do a lot worse."
""
"O: The ginger is almost overpowering in this brew - I wish it was a little more subtle and the pumpkin was slightly more pronounced. Interesting, enjoyable but not necessarily something I would have with any regularity."
"O: This beer has lots of ginger flavors and seems like it would be and interesting choice to pair with sushi."

"Ginger bomb to the absolute max. I enjoy this flavor but it is very unbalanced and over the top."

"O: Sorry to say but it was my least favorite out of the pumpkin series and the root ginger character was way too potent for me to enjoy."
"Pours a hazy pale yellow with a white head. In the aroma, a small dryness, but not much there. In the taste, A small spice and small dryness, which hides the basic pils tastes. A spice like bite and a watery and lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry spice in the aftertaste. Thin, watery, and a bit strange, not a fan of this one."
""
"Overall: not really much of a pumpkin beer as one would expect. Ginger is a bit overpowering here. Not bad but it didn't hit the mark for me."
"Good thing I don't hate ginger, because this is like a liquid ode to gender. It's very interesting, but it really takes like an experiment."
"If you ever wanted to know what ginger does to a beer, this is it. Missed the pumpkin and that was said."
""
"Overall: I thought it was a bit misleading to call this a pumpkin beer. I would have just called it a ginger beer and left it at that. Not bad, but not as advertised."

"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a slightly hazy light golden amber. One finger white head with decent retention and nice lacing. Aroma dominated by ginger (smells like fresh crystallized ginger) with light grassy hops and sweet malt. Flavor starts as a hoppy pilsner, lightly grassy with sweet malt and spicy hops, finishing pleasantly spicy ginger and hops. Very nice flavor progression and well balanced. Surprisingly strong flavors for a low ABV beer. On the light side of medium bodied. I really enjoyed this, but would have liked a bit more pumpkin flavor. Quite ginger forward, which I liked."
""
"A good beer but too much of a one drink pony to be great. You will need to like ginger to like this beer."
""
"Fuller bodied than expected with peppery ginger spice up front followed by earthy, grassy hops, sweet malt, pumpkin, and biscuit. The spicy ginger and floral hop flavors go really well together, providing a refreshing and unique take on the style. Underneath, there is a sweet caramel malt backbone with some biscuit, autumnal spice and sweet pumpkin. Similarly to the aroma, the pumpkin flavor is subtle but comes more to the forefront as it warms. Complex and full bodied yet refreshing and and easy to drink. This unique take on the style could have been a disaster but I'm pretty impressed with this beer."

"GOOD, NOT MUST HAVE!"

"A really interesting and enjoyable pils. Decent lagery pils character plus the very interesting and potent ginger makes it kind of a treat. The hints of pumpkin round it out nicely, although it could stand just a bit more pumpkin. Otherwise, bonus points for uniqueness and I could see myself sessioning this easily."
""
"Served in an Elysian/CTH Pumpkin Smash pumpkin snifter (painstakingly acquired for me by the lovely MsRif). Poured a cloudy copper-orange color with a frothy head that receded to a thick ringlet, then further to a thin ringlet. Aroma of pumpkin, ginger, and pils malts. A bit odd on the palate, a big blast of ginger and something vaguely phenolic up front, biscuity pils malts, a dash of pumpkin, Good & Plenties and melted Gummi Bears. Kind of acrid in the finish. Light-medium body, decent overall, but nothing I'd want to have again. Not bad for a pilsner though."
""
"The body was a bit fuller than typical, but was nicely smooth and had just a bit of a lingering taste. Drinkability was pretty good, the lack of pumpkin flavors was a positive for me. Overall, this was a pretty nice little brew, it's certainly worth your time if you see it."
""
"I got mostly nutmeg and squash at first but the ginger really emerged as the beer warmed, to the point of being a little too dominant. Nice overall, though."
""
""
"On the palate I really taste the fresh ginger (yum!) and a hint of pumpkin. There is some spice, but it's muted. I was hoping for a gingerbread spice kind of thing... but it's really a lot of ginger."
"Overall a tasty and light pumpkin lager."
"6/4/7/4/14 (3.5/5)"
"D: This was very unique and very drinkable. Great idea for the Halloween season and hopefully I'll grab a couple more pints of this before its gone for the season."
"I had this at the 2007 pumpkin festival at Elysian. This is a pumpkin beer, but I've listed it as a Czech pilsner rather than as a pumpkin ale because it is most decidedly not an ale- and the division between lager and ale seems to take precedence over spicing. The brewery lists it as a ginger pumpkin pilsner. Brewed with pale, Munich, and Cara-hells malts; bittered with US Northern Brewer and finished with Czech Saaz hops. Pumpkin was added to the mash and kettle and chopped fresh ginger was added to te end of the boil. Starting gravity was 15.1 degrees plato. It poured blonde with lots of effervescence and a good head. The smell has a light nuttiness and light ginger aroma. The taste is a weird blend of traditional pilsner crsip flralness and pumpkin with some medicinal bitterness from the ginger on the finish. Not entirely successful. Mouthfeel is slippery and a bit soapy, also missing the mark. It's not like it is a drain pour or anything, but it just didn't really work. Interesting experiment and I applaud them for that, but I don't think I'd have it again- but I'm glad I got to try it once."
