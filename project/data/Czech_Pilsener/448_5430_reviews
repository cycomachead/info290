"cheap and drinkable but a little boring, I suppose the style rarely excites me"
""
"Overall: not a bad pilsner but not my favourite. An easy-drinking beer but nothing really special. Decent price for AU$62 for a case of 20 x 500mL."

"Final Thoughts: At first looking at the can, I thought this was a doppelbock. Probably becuase of the goat logo and the long name in the background. I guess that's not really relevant, but I think they should try to work on making their beer a bit more like one, IE killing the dryness and giving more of a malt presence."

"O - Traditional mass produced euro export pilsener. Nothing mind blowing, easy drinking and reasonably flavourful. I probably wouldn't buy it again but it's worth a try and certainly a reasonable option in a pinch."
"Taste is good, not spectacular but the good mouthfeel makes this a good beer on a warm day! Next!"
"I'd tried this before and it's now like night and day when compared to this one. A lot sweeter and easier to drink without the skunk flavours, this one was a very nice lager that I would have again."

"Pours a clean yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, faint lager like notes, but almost nothing. In the taste, dry lager tones, but almost skunky, which is weird cause it's in a can. A small bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dryness to a clean aftertaste. Domestic lager like, faint tastes and smells, eh!"

"O: I hope the style gets better than Kozel. I didn't enjoy this one."

"O- Typical Czech Pilsener, light and refreshing."

"Overall, this is an average Czech pilsner that carries its most basic characteristics and doesn't strive to improve on them. With the abundance of pilsners readily available to me, this seems easy to pass up."
"Chances are if you've ever had a beer then you've tried a Czech inspired pilsner. Their clean complexion, quenching light body and zesty hop profile converted an entire planet of beer drinkers onto lagers. It's too bad that so many macro breweries (apparently Czech ones included) have bastardized the style and exposed so many to such poor renditions."
"I loved in Czech for 6 months and I would have to say this was one of my favorites. Most of Americans didn't like it as much and opted for the less pungent Gambrinus. Great example of a fine Pilsner. I tried back in the US and I would have to say it's not the same. But, still a great beer."
"Drinkability is just OK. The strange looking goat / rooster creature on the label seems quite proud of it but I'm not sure you will be."
"D- Not enough hops, too bland, but i think im right in saying the creamy texture in the finish is supposed to be there, so that makes up slightly for it. Nevertheless, better pilseners out there! Next!"
"I think this is a fairly tasty and accurate example of of simple style."
"D - Not the most interesting beer but a good one nonetheless. Pretty good value too at $2.99AUS for a 500ml bottle"
"I tried this beer after purchasing at my local LCBO store. It poured a somwehat cloudy gold colour, not translucent. The aroma was strong and malty with some grainy tones. It is slightly thick on the tongue with very little carbonation. The taste is slightly malty with a toasty aftertaste. This is another Czech beer I would have no problem trying again."
"Drinkability- An easy drinking beer."
"Medium bitterness and body. Finishes crisply, and not cloying. Quite refreshing, but nothing remarkable."
"A good example of an underrated style. There might me a lot of more complex ones, but a Czech Pilsener should be straightforward."
"Not much of a pilsner. Sweet with a lot of foam, Ok mouthfeel but on the light side. A bit of bitter grassy hops. Drinkable because its not offensive, but only got me through as nothing else worth drinking.Nothing in aroma past the malt for me. A macro version of a Czech beer."
"Pleasnat and drinkable especially as the days become longer and warmer"
"Can: Poured a yellowish color pilsner with a big white foamy head with good retention. Aroma of what seems like corn and adjunct is quite surprising since I didnt though Czech brewery were using those ingredient. Taste is also bland with very little malt and no hops at all. Overall, I was quite disappointed with this one and was expecting closer to Pilsner Urquell then this."
"Smooth beer, tasty and refreshing. Not an outstanding Pilsner but definatly respectable."
"Taste is crisp, hoppy, with good floral hops that comes to play with a great ceralic flavour and taste."
"Originally reviewed February 19, 2005. 12 Oz Bottle. Appealing golden-tan pour. Coarse carbonation, uneven lacing. Fresh cotton and malt aroma. Supple lager, great fresh malt, nicely balanced and swirled with hops. Light citrus and complex grain finish. Sweet, yet a little dry. Sustains on the palate. Very drinkable and smooth!"
"Great beer from a great brewery. A must in Eastern Europe! Bottled version close, but no cigar..."
"Drinkabilitynothing greatwhats the point of the yeast in this one? Its just like diluted sugar water."
"This is a good beer."
"Brilliantly clear, deep gold colour with a fluffy, bright white head. Some lace and decent retention. Sweet, malty aroma with a mild hit of floral/spicy hops. Mild, yet solid bitterness. Clean malt provides a mild sweetness and counterpoint for floral hops. Malt finishes short, leaving the hop bitterness and flavour to linger. Quite nice actually. Moderately high carbonation that adds to a creamy texture once it settles a bit. Light body, but never thin. A very enjoyable pilsner. I'll probably be picking this one up again when the lager craving hits."
"M&D: refreshing on the mouthfeel and quite clean, with a well-balanced body overall and a semi-bitter aftertaste arousing more thirst sip by sip. An above-average, solid Czech Pilsner full of body yet also feather-light as a thirst-quencher."
"Hops in the aftertaste, but the previous sweetness is prevalent."
"Drinkability/Overall: Nice overall balance of flavours. Malty, hoppy, sweet, dry. Could use some more hops. For the price however, you cant go wrong."
"D: Nothing harsh, but nothing exciting either."
"Medium gold in colour with lots of carbonation. Good aromas of honey-like malt, and both grassy and floral hops. That floral note is especially nice. The flavor is a bit of a letdown after the aroma, with more corse grassy notes entering the lightly malted mix, but the bitterness is at a good level for this style of beer. Overall, a fairly good pilsner."
"The drinkability is better than the taste, smooth and crisp, a beer that can be downed in a session with ease. The lack of flavour present in the mouthfeel is somewhat disappointing."
"strong malt presence in the taste as well. nice, but could use some bitterness to balance it out. very smooth."
"I gotta say, I like this Pilsener. It pours a deep orangey gold with a small ivory head that leaves swathes of nice lace. The aroma is a balance of biscuit malts and Czech noble hops. The taste begins with a hoppy punch and some great malt flavors that build in the middle to take precedence and then recede in the finish. The aftertaste is bitter and grassy, very pleasant. The mouthfeel is medium and lightly carbonated for a lager. A great beer by any respect. The Czechs definitely know their beer."
"If you're looking for a nice pilsner to drink, give Kozel Premium a try."
"Good session beer. I really like the hint of sweetness up front."
"I think if you're going to go for a euro-pils, might as well make it Kozel. it ranks right up there with Urquell and Czechvar for sure. Very drinkable."
"Very pale and clear, but with a deep hint of red-gold. Malty, certainly, but a very honeyish malt flavour, as opposed to the fuller Budvar maltiness, that comes from the very pale malts. Has that characteristic Czech trick of vanishing down your throat before you even realize it. Leaves behind a slowly creeping, rich, floral bitterness."
"Appearance: Golden orange hue with a white bubbly head nicely formed leaves evenly spread rings of lacing. Aroma: Nice grassy, peppery Saaz hops are detectable but mild and soothing, semi-sweet malts are there to balance great blend here reserved but fresh smelling brew. Taste: Middle of the road on my spectrum but still a tasty Czech beer that I'm glad I had the opportunity to sample, lemongrass tone to it with a decent hop bite of bitterness nothing spectacular but fends well against other Euro lagers. Mouthfeel: Thin to light in body does lack a bit of carbonation for the style but a smooth cohesive tone. Drinkability: Pretty nice overall, not a gold winner but all and all refreshing...aaahhh."
"The pour a translucent gold color with the head portly in size and the texture semi-creamy, bright white in color as it dissipates a fine sheet of lace left to seal off the glass. The malt, nose somewhat sweet and a citrus like crispness, start nicely malted and sweet with the top fair to middling in its feel. Finish has a light acidity with the hops moderate in their spiciness, drinkable but just another average lager."
"Pours a clear standard gold under a two fingered head that fades fast. There's lots of barley in the nose - really a lot. The mouth is light and prickly. Lots of malt in the opening taste, and a nice flowery hop finish. Perfectly drinkable, there is nothing spectacular about this beer at all."
"as i write this its a stinking hot day out there, and this beer is going down a treat. nothing too complex, the characters of the beer are all in the right places it makes for a quite enjoyable beer that doesnt demand too much of the drinker. one that can enter the rotation every so often and make a nice addition."
"Easy drinking beer, with clean flavours and is a steal at only a couple of bucks for a 500 mL bottle."
"Head disappeared almost immediately after pouring. Clear pale gold colour with a steady, rapid stream of bubbles making their way to the top of the beer. Smells of straw, honey and mild hops. A little to fizzy to my mouth. It tastes of honey, mild hops. Tasty. I'd have another."
"I hate neck foils. This bottle has a neck foil. Dammit, why? Anyways, this was a mediocre pilzner. Bought at the LCBO not really knowing what the style was(didn't say on the bottle). Poured typical pilzner style, that pale yellow gold. Knew right away it was a pilzner. Pathetic head that disipated too film. Bittersweet smell with little hops, some honey, and barley malt. Hey, this tastes alright. Not as bad as I was expecting from the look and smell. Well balanced sweet and bitterness, with a honey aftertaste. Not perfectly balanced, but a fine attempt was made. Slick mouthfeel and left my throat a little dry. Very drinkable. I'm glad it comes in 500mL bottles, because 341mL would be a tease for more."
"this beer is very tasty, especially for a lager/pils, doesn't have the pungency of the pilsener Urquell, and tends to be a bit more malty than PU aswell, nice bitterness (not too bitter), lovely smooth drinkability, and at $3 ($1.50 US) per 500ml bottle its pretty good value aswell, great drop for a quiet one at home or for a big night. Make sure its fresh though."
"A very nice pale lager, impressive as to all aspects of this offering with one exception....Colour is medium gold...very nice head and aroma is crisp & clean....body is medium and taste is hoppy and pleasant...I love it, well I like it a lot....But...please get rid of that neck foil."
"Smooth enough."
"Not a lot of aromatic hops in my example. Bold style."
"A truly good, authentic Pilsner, bordering on great. This is the type of Pilsner Beck's or Labatts (and most North American brewers) wished they could produce. They can't, this brew took time. Brew time and cellar time. The quality of ingredients and process are there for the palate to enjoy on this Pilsner. Soft barley and malt tastes balanced with those heavenly saaz bitters. A great example of Czech pilsen style lagers. This one has a distinguishing quality though. It has everything required of a good Pilsner, flowery hopping evident to the nose and palate, sharp crisp start, tart/malty/grassy in the mouth  dry finish except, this one has no lingering ""tinny"" taste to the tongue from the saaz hops....probably not pasteurized. I liked this Pilsner very much and that takes something for this fanatical ""Pils head"".  The only draw back is the price. $2.85 per 500mil bottle. I was surprised this beer was so fresh tasting, date code was near expired and it sat unrefrigerated on the LCBO (our state liquor monopoly) shelf.  A must try if you like Pilsners."
"500mL bottle.  an excellent brew, it has a beautiful full golden colour.  pours with a light 2 to 3 finger head, which dissipates fairly quickly to a thin covering layer. The taste is fairly sweet at first, with some nice (very) subtle bitter notes.  The kicker and what makes this beer is the sweet honey aftertaste.  It lingers long and well to a very nice effect.  Very smooth with a slightly syrupy feel, this is definitely drinkable."
