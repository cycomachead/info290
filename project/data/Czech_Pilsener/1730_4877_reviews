"Overall: 3.25 - A solid, refreshing beverage."
""
"Nice head and golden color. Nice crisp taste with smooth finish. Really good Pilsner."
""
""
"Pours a light golden color color with a nice head. Smells sweet and floral like. Taste is just like it smells except with a slight bitterness and goes down pretty smooth. Overall one off the best Czech Pilsener I've had."
""
""
""
"Good European import, not overly filling but nice and crisp"
""
""
""
""

"Overall: an okay pilsener but certainly not the best I have ever had. I'll definitely take another option for the AU$52 a case mark."
""
""
"A good clean Pale Lager, with a nice decent aroma."
""
"A mild tasting, low body, clear looking and clean pilsner. Some bready characteristics and light hops flavor. Not ordinarily something that I would have on a regular basis. However, being that I was at a European style tavern run by and patronized by people from various parts of the former Yugoslavia, the mood was perfect. Furthermore, the spicy sausage I ate with it was the perfect counterpoint."

"Decent enough beer."
"Not bad for a pilsener, but I probably should have tried it in on a sunny May or June afternoon, instead of a rainy October evening."
"O: This is a pretty standard mass produced pilsner. It seems to be designed less to impress the drinker and more to sell."

"Pretty good beer if you're looking for something on the lighter side."

"The nose does show some Saaz hop character, as well as a light doughy malt backdrop. It's all so slight, though, and could stand to be a little stronger. It falters even more on the palate, where the hops mostly show up as a clean bitterness. The malt becomes more toasty than it promised at first. They do get some things right, it's definitely a clean beer and nothing becomes annoying or cloying, but there is just a lack of complexity that ultimately dooms it to also-ran status. It's really only about toasty malt and lingering bitterness in the finish, and that gets too monotonous by the end of the bottle."
"Drinks a lot like the nose smells. Fruit rot, lagery grains, corn syrup, backend bitterness, and a generic sweet/stale carry-through. Has a note of light green apple and faint caraway. Some fusel and mintiness. The body has a decent shape, but it's not a game-changer. Carbonated averagely. Better than your average Euro Lager, but that's not saying too much. Especially, because it's listed as a Czech Pils."
"Bad, a gas station lager."

"I tried a beer from Croatia, Karlovačko. It was horrible, really. I'm not sure how it was possible to make a beer that was simultaneously too bitter AND too sweet. It was so bad I could only stand 3 sips before I donated to a local tree in the park."

"Karlovačko has a very thick, foamy, white head, a clear, bubbly, golden-straw appearance, and some splotchy lacing left behind. The aroma is sweet, biscuit, barley malt and a touch of hop oil, and the flavor is the same, with pleasant, grassy hops to round it out. Mouthfeel is light and watery, and Karlovačko finishes crisp, clean, refreshing, and dry. Overall, this is a delicious beer. RJT"
"Just above average in it's style and class: a country tick, no more and no less."

"O: Another standard Euro Lager in an ocean of lagers."
""
""
""

""

""

""

"O - A tasty lager, easily sessioned with no real aftertaste that leave you wondering if you've even drank a beer."
"Aside from not having any head, this is a great beer. The taste was an almost perfect balance of bitter and sweet."
""
"overall - my first Croatian beer, but nothing special."
"skunk, cereal grains, a very classic light beer smell and as many have said, it smells a lot like Heineken. very, very flavorless. there's some cereal grains going on, but not much else. thankfully there wasn't any of the skunk flavor detected in the nose. the finish was dry and again, very flavorless. i didn't get any of the yeasty and spicy notes that others have spoken of. high carbonation. Not that good"
""
""
""
"O: Karlovačko is a beer that is very mellow. There are no strong tastes. There are no strong aromas. This beer is smooth. This beer is very easy to drink. People who enjoy light beers should try Karlovačko."
""
""

"Seems pretty substandard, even by Euro Pale Lager measures. I can't bring myself to rate this as a Czech Pilsener. Why don't we have a European Adjunct category? However, it has quite a beautiful label, if you like old-timey eastern European graphics. From the 500 ml bottle bought at BevMo, so I get what I deserve."
""
"There's probably a reason this can of Karlovacko has ""EXPORT ONLY"" printed across its label: Croatians know better than to waste their money on it. Actually, in truth, the opposite is probably true. If I've taken anything away from this plain, adjunct-ridden lager it's that nationalism can delude people of anything, in particular that their beer is somehow superior. Croatians are free to enjoy this (if they can) but I'll pass."

"just another balkan region light lager/pils beer. this one pours a decent looking honey color with a one inch white head. aromatically its similar to a lot of the other beers on offer here in sarajevo, bready malts balanced by faint bittering hops in the finish. this one is distinct only because of a hint of floral sweetness that comes in and out of the nose. flavor is quite palatable, none of the metallic tainted aftertaste of its peers, but the sweetness here is out of place, it makes the beer more filling than it should be. its also usually a bit skunky in bottled form. the mouthfeel is okay, less than medium body and normal carbonation. i feel like a lot of these euro lager type reviews sound the same, which is a frustrating reflection of the reality that is standardized brews. still waiting for something distinct over here, and karlovacko definitely isnt that, but its drinkable enough and cheap enough to be on regular rotation for me this summer."
"Final Grade: 3.29, a forgettable C+. Karlovacko isn't bad for what it is - a run-of-the-mill pale Euro lager. Better than Ozujsko, and better than many of the more widely-distributed EPLs, but if a genuine pilsener is your bag then this isn't something I can seriously recommend. If you need a highly drinkable, fairly enjoyable lager to drink with salty/greasy food or on a hot patio, this is definitely a worthy selection, though."

"O: After getting over the initial shock of the smell when opening the bottle, I think this a decent beer. The beer is easy to drink and has a pleasant flavor and appearance."
"O: This beer is rather easy to drink but could use a bit more flavors of bready malts and floral hops."

"Out of a bomber this beer was a clear golden color with one finger of eggshell-white head. The retention as a skim was not bad and it left spotty lacing. The aroma was a faint blend of dry grains and sweet malt. The flavors were very generic and though I’ve seen this beer billed as a Czech Pilsner in truth I think it’s just an average Euro Pale Lager. The flavors were mostly corn, dry grains, sweet malt and a touch of bread. The mouthfeel was average, the body medium/light and the carbonation moderate."
""
"Overall – When will I learn to stop buying these run of the mill euro-beers. I keep hoping that one day I'm going to find a diamond in the rough, but it never happens. I made it through the can, but I won't buy this one again."

"O - Pedestrian macro."
"O- Better than your average Euro pale lager, but there is nothing really that interesting about it."
"Picked up a 500ml bottle for about $2 at the Best Yet grocery in Astoria. After the initial skunk aroma wafts away (thanks green bottle), I'm left a with a plan, slightly sweet lager with a vague hint of herbal hops and toasted barley. Sure it's bland, but there's nothing offensive here. Probably a decent beer when fresh."

"This beer pours a clear, fizzy yellow color with creamy, white foam that persists and then leaves lacing on the glass. There is a fine stream of bubbles from the bottom of the glass. The smell is lightly malty with aromatic hops and a bit of sweetness. The taste has some nice, mild bitterness up front followed by some light malt sweetness. Kind of a one-dimensional flavor, but OK. The mouthfeel is crisp and dry overall with medium-light body. Some mild hop bitterness lingers in the finish. Overall a drinkable pilsner lager."
"O: Not my style of beer."
"Overall, an average pilsner-style beer to quench a thirst and forget about it."
"O: First Croatian experience, I'm pleased. A little nervous for the taste after the smell, but it pulled through."
"Overall, this is a great brew, full of unexpected flavors and charm. If this is the fare that Croatia has to offer, then this is one reviewer who will be making a point to swing by the next time he goes across the pond."
"Pours a clear yellow-gold with a 2 inch white head that settles to a thin cap. Jagged rings of lace slowly dissolve into random spots of lace around the glass. When I first opened this beer, I got a huge whiff of skunk. Upon pouring into a glass, the only smells I get are of grains and some grass or hay notes. Taste is very much the same with grain and grass/hay flavors. There is a slightly herbal bitterness on the palate after each sip. The mouthfeel on this beer is a bit flat with a low level of carbonation. Overall, this is a pretty average beer from Croatia and my first from the country. I probably wouldn’t get this one again in the future."
"This one pours a watery bright gold with a one finger head. It smells of old stale pale malts. No crispness, a severe lack of anything hop related. It's blase. The taste is infinitely boring. It doesn't feature any complexity. It's old pale malts and that's it. It's somewhat stale and is very watery. It just isn't good in any aspect and doesn't feature anything new or refreshing. Noble Pils kills this beer in a head to head. It isn't worth the $3."
"Overall: Reminds me a bit of Tyskie Gronie with Bud Light's dryness and Golden Pheasant's sweetness."
"D-The skunky nose and unpleasant taste make this one I won't try again. Don't bottle beer in GREEN BOTTLES!"
"Overall: An OK beer, but I wouldn't go searching for it. It could refresh you on a summer's day."
"Had this beer from the bottle and on tap while on vacation in Croatia; Decent drinkability, over-all an average"
"D: Ok, nothing to get excited about. Definitely not toilet water, but not the best pilsner. I could easily drink this on a hot summer day, nice import, but there are much better imports and pilseners than this one."
"D: Solid, average and down the middle."
"Karlovacko was pale gold in color with good clarity. It had a white head with decent retention and lacing. The smell was noble hops and light malt. The taste was light malt with a little noble hop flavor. The finish was short and dry. The mouthfeel was average with a light body and plenty of carbonation. Drinkability was average. This was a pretty basic Pilsener that was crisp, refreshing, and boring. There are far better Pilseners out there"
"D/N - Not too high. A decent beer though. Worth a try, just don't expect to much. Honestly I was kind of disappointed in this one."
"Once the unpleasantness of the skunk in the aroma diminishes, the beer settles down to something drinkable. Its not the best Czech style pilsener to wet my lips, but I sat back and enjoyed it for what it was."
"D: Okay beer, would rather have a zatec in the same category of beer."
"Poured from a green 500 ml bottle. Pale golden color with pure white head which dissipates quickly without any lacing. Smell is the fairly standard mild skunk smell from most Euro lagers from a green bottle. Taste... isn't half bad. Average, but I don't feel the need to have another one."
"D: One is good enough for me. Not a big fan in general. But it is always nice to try the same lager from other countries."
"Short herbaceous green pepper/green peppercorn finish. Not bad just a very short profile."
"I poured into a pint glass to three fingers of white head. It is pale yellow in color. The smell is like the grass after a rain. I also sense a little yeast in there. The taste is crisp and refreshing. It is better than I remember. It is a really drinkable beer if your into this style. I just am turned off by the green bottle. I can't get over my prejudice."
"Pours a pale golden with a decent head that quickly subsides, leaving the thinnest layer of foam. Very little lacing to speak of. Aroma has grainy notes up front, with some hops and vanilla in the background. Taste is alright, with a bit more tartness than I expected, but also a disappointing lack of hops presence characteristic of the style. Mouthfeel is okay, with decent carbonation, though the body is perhaps a bit watery. Overall, not a bad brew, but not really my idea of a true Czech pilsener. As a previous reviewer stated, this beer is more reminiscent of a standard Euro pale lager."
"To me this is not a Czech Pilsener, at least not a good one. More an unexciting euro pale lager."
"Summary: nice beer, closely tracks Urquell and the other Czech pilsners but slightly lighter and less flavorful. Not a bad beer but not the cream of the class."
"I don't think this is an amazing beer but it's not expensive for a European beer, and it is easy to drink. And the bottle is so cool you might just need to buy it!"
"Overall, Karlovacko is a pleasant beer, worth the price. There is nothing particularly special about it, but, at the same time, one can't help but look forward to drinking a few bottles of it with some good food."
"Good for washing down some polish sausage or for a game of checkers on the patio in hot weather."
"Pours a bright golden color with a large, fizzy head that dissipates quickly. Slight hop aroma. Smooth mouth-feel, a bit over-carbonated, with clean malt and slightly predominant hops."
"Liquid brass sits in my glass. (Let's hear some snapping from the peanut gallery for my poetry slap. Yeah, I said it.) The only reason I can distinguish between this brew and, say, a French horn, besides the clear sonic advantage favoring the latter, is the stiff quaff of white foam before me. Once this is dissipated, a steady stream of bubbly goodness rises from the base. A deep sniff makes me question why I even continue sampling the pilsners and AALs of the world, as they all seem to smell the same to me: some corn syrup, some toasted rice, and a bit of wheat. Nothing offensive, nothing impressive. The tastes are also very similar (though the pilses are indeed distinguishable from the AALs), with a firm backbone of wheaty rice propping up a vaguely bitter body. What makes me less derisive toward this particular brew is the lack of a sharp tinniness that tends to pervade other pilsners. Still nothing Earth-shattering, but definitely not as negative as the rest of its ilk. Though that bubbly jet stream continues to rise like one of those bubble walls we all used to marvel at while visited Sharper Image as children, the carbonation is not overtly active, not overly fizzy, allowing the fairly light body glide sleekly over the tongue and down the gullet. Though it has not converted me into a smiling clear lager drinker, it has shown me that I oughtn't necessarily judge every one as boring before I try it, and that Croatia is coming along in terms of beer production."
"Clear, lightish golden pour with a big fluffy white head after a pretty aggressive pour out of out of a 500ml brown bottle. I get no skunk in the aroma, but there is a wet grass/straw scent that is most prominent. There's a floral hint that I'd attribute to the hops, but I can't really sense a hop presence. You can, however, taste the hops. It's subtle, peppery, and grassy. This is clean and refreshing. I've always enjoyed this beer and it doesn't disappoint again."
"Not much to say here, this is just another mediocre Euro Lager. It pours clear, bright, yellow gold. Carbonation is a bit light. There's a touch of hops in the aroma and finish but nothing to write home about. The malt is relatively clean but bland. It's just too similar to too many other lagers to merit much discussion."
"Drinkability: overall, not too bad. I think I'd prefer it outdoors in hotter climes or times, but it does OK even in the winter."
"Poured from a green 16.9 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is a bit on the skunky side. Taste is of malts, slightly sweet and finishing a bit bitter. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has decent drinkability. Overall this makes for a pretty good choice."
"bought a pint single at surdyks..it poured a dark yellow color with an ok head and lacing not your typical pils color the smell was hops and sweet floral smells i also detect a slght earthy smell from this one..the taste was not as crisp and floral as i like euro-pils to be it had slight peat taste to it..overall its not a bad pils but ill choose budvar or golden pheasant over this one when the beer taste bud want an easy drinking euro-pils"
"Cheers John."
"Overall, I'd rate this about a 1.9 despite my above response."
"I poured most of a 500 ml Karlovacko pilsener into a pint glass. It was a very clear yellow and had a fragile one finger white head. I couldn't get much out of the aroma, not even your typical pils smells. This beer tasted sweet but had little other flavor, rather bland. It was light bodied and had adequate carbonation. In terms of drinkability, it would be a good session beer. Not bad, but summed up in one word, bland. Oh well, I was the one who wanted to try a Croatian beer."
"Overall: A good Czech Pils, but not the best example."
"D - good lager, quenching. Some interesting notes which you could either like or dislike, but probably not in between."
"The finish is what I like about the beer. It is on the dry side but leaves a slighty malty finish."
"Pours pale golden, fizzy, and with a healthy head. In the nose, it's grainy and with a whiff of adjuncts. Tastes very light, grainy, and perhaps a bit corny. Very light hops. Not terrible, but not all that exciting. The mouthfeel is lightly grainy and soft. Overall this is okay in a pinch. If I were in the Balkans, I'd probably be fairly pleased to find this at a restaurant rather than some other terrible Euro-lager."
"D: The first beer I had from the Balkans, but the Czechs make far better Czech Pilsener than the boys from Croatia. But this is not a bad beer, it just got some stiff competition in the style."
"This is worth trying and a pretty good offering."
"D: Lacking in head retention, this beer delivers every else. Not a bad brew and within all style guidelines."
"D: A real nice suprise on the cheap out of Croatia. Went real nicely after a hour of shooting hoops."
"D - not good. definitely a drain pour."
"D- I just wasn't overly impressed with this beer. While not bad, so many of the key components (aroma, flavor) were just a bit ""off."""
"This beer pours a very light yellow, very clear with a bit of white head. The aroma reminds me very much of Heineken, very much, a bit of skunk, which was a turn off. The flavor wasn't at all bad, no skunk. There is some bready/grainy notes along with a bit of hop flavor and enough hop bitterness to keep the beer from being cloying. The body is medium-light and carbonation medium-high. Overall an easy drinking beer with a bit of flavor, worth a try if you see it."
"No, this is not a very good Czech Pilsner, and not a good beer. Possibly miscategorized. Stick with Golden Pheasant or Pilsner Urquell or Staropramen for a Czech Pils. If I didn't hate to waste beer so much, I would have given up and dumped it halfway through. Below average across the board. It doesn't kill me to drink Euro macros, but this might be the least worthy I've had. I'd have to be in Croatia to think about trying this again."
"D- High drinkability. Good session pilsner. Could drink these all night. Over all a solid pilsner."
"Nikki"
"Pours a golden yellow and very clear. Has a thin white head that disappears quickly into a thin collar and thinner laciness. Aroma is barley and malt and has a sweetness in the background. Taste is sweet with a strong barley presence, mild fruit taste. Decent body but thin texture. Good for a lager, not what I expected coming from Europe. Decent overall flavor, that would be good to have a couple around the house. Not my first choice for a session beer."
"D - If there wasn't the weird metallic flavor this beer wouldn't really be all that bad taste starts decent but finishes bad maybe fresh it would be better"
"The green bottle! Never been a fan of anything produced in a green bottle. Clear, golden pilsner with carbonated head that dissipates to nothing. Cleans the pallet. Smooth with hints of alcohol. I find the drinkability higher than what I originally thought."
"I was thinking that this isn't a bad standard-ish EPL. As a pils, it's lacking, but still not bad. I'll say it lands between the styles. In any case, it has a bit of character, though it's a bit too sweetish and bland overall. Nothing special, but inoffensive."
"D - This is a decent enough example of a Czech style pilsner, but really falls more into a 'macro-Euro lager' category. The hops aren't as 'bright' as perhaps I would like and this might be a function of age. However, there is no oxidation noted if it is well aged which is a credit to the brewers. This is probably really good fresher and closer to the source."
"I suppose the beer-of-the-month club ran out of worthwhile things to import."
"Picked this up at the local beer store for $2.60 500ml bottle. A light golden color,stark white head that quickly fades.Lots of carbonation. Aroma of mild hops and maybe some faint apple notes.Flavor of mild bitter hops and a tiny caramel note. I really liked this,for a pale lager it was very good,did not have that odd baby puke aroma that some pale lagers have. Very drinkable"
"Raw grainy pale malt nose with a certainly mild sweetness. Smells like a refreshing Pils. The taste is mildly sweet and cereal grain like, husky and hully. Light hop bitterness to the very clean finish...overall a bit on the bland side. Light-medium body with no mention of alcohol. Easy to drink, above average at best."
"Pours a pale orange color with yellow highlights. Decent white head that recedes quickly leaving some average lacing. Not bad for the appearance. Aroma of some grainy, husky malts, and decent herbal hop aroma. Not skunky in the least. Flavor is where things go downhill. A bit watered down, some husky pale malts, light sweetness, and a below average hop flavor for a Czech style pilsener. No aftertaste whatsoever, finish is incredibly clean. There a slight bite at the end, but the flavor is just lacking. Medium bodied, which is surprising since it tastes so light, and very drinkable. This stuff goes down so easy, it's almost sad that it has no flavor. I bought a single bottle of this because I've never had a beer from Croatia. I probably won't be revisiting this any time soon but it was worth the shot."
"Light-medium in body with fine, crisp carbonation. Perfectly refreshing flavors and mouthfeel to compliment a sunny afternoon."
"Drinkability is pretty good on a warm sunny day. The bottle has a ""best before"" date also."
"Overall, this is a very good lawnmower beer if you're looking for something with a little more malt flavor and complexity than the average pils. The lack of hop balance is made up for by the high carbonation, lending this one a good overall impression on the palate."
"Not a bad beer, but there's just so many others out there which are far better."
"D: Average drinkability, a nice start is hindered by a lack of aroma, but fairs better with the finish. Uneventful at times but still one that can be mindlessly put back on a Sunday afternoon."
"Well since I needed a beer from Croatia I decided to grab a sixer! Truth be told I had been considering purchasing this for a while and finally decided to since pickings were slim at the grocery store. Aroma is faint and consists primarily of nothing, not offensive but far from appealing. Pours a straw golden into my glass with a quickly diminishing head and some sticky lacing. The mouthfeel is solid, slightly creamy with a good finish and pleasant aftertaste. The flavor is also solid, nothing spectacular. In a sense it is typical euro lager that is slightly more mellow than say Grolsch or Heinekin. I enjoy the taste, but overall par at best."
"B'ham UK"
"Medium gold, white head with little retention, very little lacing early. Smell is grassy. Taste is clean. Grain, cracker-like. Bitter spice on the finish. Medium body, dry texture, moderate carbonation. Pretty much a typical European-style pilsner... without the stink. Not bad I guess, but then again I don't really care for this style and probably won't have it again."
"D - A super-session beer for the great spring weather! I could totally see dropping a few of these down the gullet at a backyard summer BBQ...I'll bet it's great with brats since it would compliment the greasy and heavy fatty flavors with a crisp freshness."
"D: A six pack a day will keep Dr. Blues away doooodes."
"It's reasonably easy to drink, and reasonably unoffensive. It's not a great beer though, and I'd be loath to call it an above average pils-style lager. Don't count on winning too many more medals, guys."
"D: It was a decent and easy to drink Pilsener that would make a great session brew."
"D - A pretty standard Mediterranean lager apropo to the climate. Its a good poolside beer."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and fairly clean and the drinkability is fine - a few of these would be fine if this is all you can find. Not a beer I would buy again or seek out."
"While camping in Croatia, not many beers other than Karlovacko where available in the nearby shops. It's nothing special, but it's surely better than nothing. After a hot day of climbing and sun, it was nice to crack a few of these and feel refreshedwhile watching the sun drop on the horizon. Definitely not a great beer, but perfect for it's situation."
"This beer pours a clear straw-gold color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes quickly into sparse lacing. The aroma has a faint hint of biscuity malt, but mostly it is of nothing. The taste is has little more of the biscuity malt than the aroma with the addition of some very mild noble hops. The mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is a decent beer at best. It's not so bad that I can't finish one bottle, but it isn't good enough to rink again."
"I found this one a typical central European lager with a Czech twist."
"Pours a clear gold that holds almost no head after a few seconds. Nose is slightly cereal sweet. Bitter acrid tone to it. Slight fruity tone to it. Man. This tastes...funny. I want to say it almost tastes like apple juice beer. Which is interesting on the first sip. Then the whole flavor profile just jumps off the edge of the cliff. Turns bitter and metallic and has no good quality to it really. Feel is standard with minimal carbonation. I doubt I am going to get through this whole thing. So bland. So...just...so...not that worth drinking. Oh well. Add another country to the list."
"D - A basic, uncomplex lager. Nothing to get excited about but a few of these would go down without a problem."
"Again, if this is a Pilsner, then it is all wrong. But if that is a misprint, it is still not a very good beer, but drinkable."
"Pours a clear solid gold under a short-lived one finger white head that left exactly one spot of lace before disappearing quickly. The nose is reasonably strong of grain, perhaps corn but not at all unpleasant. The mouth is fairly chewy and reasonably well carbonated. A decent, solid taste with plenty of bready grain but not much on the hops side. I suppose this would be OK as a quaffer on a hot summer day. It'll do."
"D - An average pils flavor, nothing to write home about. Basic drinkability, not bad, but not great. I would drink this again, but probably not seek it out."
"Pours a clear golden. One finger head, but not much retention,or lacing. Aroma is of faint yeast,and malts. Weak at best. Body is thin, and watery with some carbionation. Taste is sweet,and bready with a honey edge that is not unpleasent. Not my favorite style,but if it's yours,give it a try."
"Served up at the Beachwood Ballroom in Cleveland, OH. Pale gold with a white head that disappears right away. Aroma is faintly skunky, containing noble hops. Grainy with some citrus. Flavor is pretty on par with your typical Euro lager, pale, dull, and light. This one is perhaps a touch hoppier then the average. Light, crisp, and fairly clean body. Drinkable but not exciting. Still, this is from Croatia, ancestral home of one of my great grandfathers and current home to my ex-commissar cousin so this beer gets a bonus for that."
"try it."
"Eye catching gold in color, but the head is lackluster. This is a pretty standard pilsner. Sort of sweet, broken by the hops and hay flavors. Good crisp feel on the tongue. Drinkablilty is okay, as it sometimes tasted rusty. Worth sampling once or twice; I already have."
"Lite aroma of steamed veggies, along with a barely discernable note of the Euro yeast skunk. Soft malts along with a nice hop hit at the finish. Crisp and dry, I could drink several at a session. Glad I tried it, not bad and made up for an otherwise boring evening."
"This bottle came from a brew of the month club and is a bit old, but no sediment. Just saw online today that the brewery may be temporarily closed for possible improper hazzardous waste disposal. Anyway - this poured with a nice head that promptly settled down. No lace. Nice golden amber color. Aroma of grain, grass, light malt, mild spice and some hop. Flavor is distictly sweet. Decent body. Short finish. Drinkable beer."
"D: This brew has it going on. Never had a Czech Pilsner before and if this is any indication of the style...then I'll be seeking out more of these."
"Pours light golden straw with perfect clarity. A fizzy three-finger head slowly gives way to a rocky soap bubble cap that holds fairly well and leaves some spotty lacing. Pilsener malt and some toasty biscuit aromas, background noble hops and a faint fruit scent. The Pilsener malt flavor is sweet at first, with subtle layers of toasted nut and light caramel flavors. This gives way to the more typical sharp pils taste. A very mild Saaz or tettnanger flavor and lacking bitterness are found in the aftertaste-but at least its not skunked. Lighter body with some decoction-esque malty texture and medium light carbonation make a slightly crisp and mellow mouthfeel. Finishes with traces of spicy german hops and a kiss of toasted Pils sweetness. Honestly, I found this to be an enjoyable beer -albiet lackluster example of the style. I bought it for the novelty of being Croastian beer- but I would be disappointed if I were expecting an authentic Czech PIls. On the other hand- its very affordable, highly drinkable, and could easily be passed off as a really great Macro. An ideal choice for introducing craft beer to non-enthusiasts."
"As far as drinkability is concerned, this is up there in score simply because it very easy to drink. I doubt that anyone would be offended by the taste/feel of this beer unless they were expecting something more. A good example of the classic pilsner style. Would definitely not pass up a bottle of this were I offered one."
"Drink:"
"D: Very easy to session, not at all offensive. Nothing special either. Easy drinking...Easy forgettin'."
"Notes: I've had better in the style but this is at least in the same ballpark as some of the better ones I've had. I could session this with ease. Hits all the marks, Solid. This was part of a ""beers around the world"" pack I recieved from a friend. I was pleasantly surprised w/ this offering."
"D: Not a bad beer for what it is. It lacked a lot of features I find undesirable in other eastern European pilsners. I'd drink it again."
"Taste is fairly malt dominatted for a pilsner, but fairly inoffensive. Unfortunately, the texture is limp and lifeless, with little crispness or hop bite in the aftertaste. Far too watery to be satisfying, and too impotent to be refreshing. This beer is inconsistent and not really worth your time unless you just want to try a Croatian beer, like I did. One is enough."
"Seeing as it has a substantial corn component it probably has more charcter than expected"
"Its no wonder the glass was so small, one can only take so much of this swill at once."
"I am Croatian and this beverage is drank more than water in my family. Trying to hide my biast, this is an average Pilsner at best. I believe it was recently purchased by a larger brewer (maybe Heiniken) and this is a good thing because this beer was easily spoiled in the past. The pasteurization must have improved because rarely is a spoiled one found now. The overall taste has a bit of bitter crispness to it, but generally bland. Overall this is a great lawnmower or summertime beer when your looking to throw some back and not worry about how many you drank"
"Mouthfeel is moderate, not thin, not rich. But with the flavor, I just could not finish this one."
"This was a decent beer. Pretty simple and straight forward. While it is certainly drinkable, it is also in my opinion somewhat forgetable. Nothing really stood out while drinking this beer. Certainly a bit better than the american alternatives, but still nothing to get excited about."
"Fairly nice looking clear yellowy pour with a 1 finger white head that doesn't last too long. Faint scent of honey in the nose. That honey scent is a much stronger honey flavor on the tongue. It might be a bit too sweet for some, but I liked it just fine. Not a huge mouthfeel though. Pretty darn drinkable if you like honey, which I do. This would be a great dessert after a lunch of fish and chips by the beach on a sunny day."
"11.15oz. bottle. This pours a clear golden color. Mine had minimal head, even though there was moderate carbonation. The aroma is actually pretty decent. There is a bit of a pleasant malt sweetness to the beer. The taste is not as good as the aroma. It is a bit thin, with a mild malt flavor. It doesnt taste light, however. Definitely lacking in the hops department. I suppose this would be good if I were in Croatia, but I wouldnt go out of my way to buy one here, except to add another country to the list."
"Pretty much a run of the mill pilsener. Not enough malt spine and the hops lacks some bite, both of which would make this better. All-in-all it's not bad, but nothing to write home about either."
"Karlovacko pours a light orange color with a fluffy white head from a brown 500 ml bottle. Smells better than I expected, but much like a typical macro lager. Taste is malty, and also metallic. Not much to recommend it. You would be better off spending your money elsewhere."
"12oz bottle poured out a golden, yellow color. Lots of bubbles and very little head. It smelled a bit like corn and a little like hops. The corn flavor came through while drinking it, but there was no real overpowering flavor. The mouthfeel was good. It was pretty light so I'd say it is very drinkable."
"Mouth: It enters sweet and a bit chewy and follows with a bitter swallow. I like the high carbonation (do I see a trend here) but there's absolutely no depth to the flavor. The beer is completely gone from the mouth no more than 5 seconds after being swallowed - except for a nasty metallic aftertaste that doesn't seem like it should be coming from a bottle."
"Overall not one i like at all. wasnt even an average lager, muchless a pils. Pass this on up."
"But the metaalic did affect the mouthfeel of this brew. The carbonation was not up to par for my pilsners. Not as crisp or refreshing."
"Clear gold, fluffy white head that dissipates quickly, leaving behind a smattering of lace. Grainy malt aroma with a bit of floral/spicy hops. Mild bitterness, balanced to the sweet side, with a hint of floral and citrus hops. Not much of a finish. Light bodied and dry. Thirst quenching and average."
"Ho hum euro lager from a part of the country formerly known as Yugoslavia. Pours pale straw with a short-lived white head. Little discernable aroma apart from some adjunct graininess and a faint floral note or two. Taste is not very pronounced. Not offensive just light and sweet. Little body and no finish to speak of. Might do well if served on a hot day as a quencher before you drink something nicer."
"This looks like your average european lager, bright yellow. Smell is alright, some hops, no skunk, which is a bonus. Taste is surprisingly good, clean and refreshing, Not overly sweet, and not overly bitter. This is well carbonated but overdone which makes the mouthfeel pretty unoffensive. This beer is a great Macro-Alternative and makes for a good BBQ beer for sure."
"Prehaps this beer tastes better on tap in Croatia, but the kind imported was only a bit different from dollar beers such as Carling."
"The pour is pale gold with a head that starts out appropriately large, but disappears altogether. The nose is grassy hops, muted as they might be. This straddles the fence between a European-macro lager and a Czech pilsner. It's got crisp, grassy saaz hops, a bit of malt, and a hint of herbs- there's just not much of any of it. The mouthfeel is average, so is drinkability. This stuff is a little bit better then a novelty beer from an exotic eastern European country although it's nothing exciting."
"Everything about this beer is on the light side....Nothing wrong with this beer, but certainly nothing exciting about it, either. Very easy to drink, but so is water."
"A gift from a freind of mine who hails from Kosovo,pours a medium clear golden with a thinner white head on top.Pretty highly carbonated,aroas are quite sweet and very fruity wich suprised me quite a bit but its pleasant.A little thin in body not quite watery but thin,nothing really stands out flavor wise except for a fruity finish it just seems to go down with not much flavor till a burst of fruit hits in the finish and aftertaste.Well Iam glad I got a chance to try this Croatian brew that goes down easly but with no frills."
"Drinkability: So many beers are like this, why pick this one? Maybe if you want to check Croatia off of your ""Countries of Beer Origin"" list."
"This is an enjoyable and well made beer. $1.49 at Sams liquors in Downers Grove."
"selection of beer of the month club. Poured a pale yellow color with bountious white head. Smell is a bit crisp with a not pleasant sweetness. Taste is very light with crisp malts. Finish is dry and refreshing. Nothing extraordinary. Average beer at best."
"Pretty tasty, solid Czech pilsner. Probably be better fresh, but what am I going to do?"
"(11.15 oz. / 330 ml)"
"One addendum: The label on my bottle says 5.4% ABV."
"Basically a crisp, easy going down pilsner. No aftertaste or bitterness. Nothing outstanding about it, one could have a few no problem."
"Not quite as crisp as other Czech Pilseners I've had, but overall, this was a pleasant and easy to drink beer. Malt had a touch of grassy flavor, with some light grape in the background. A bit light on the hops, but enough to carry through. Finish was on the sweet side."
"Refreshing and very drinkable. should be a good summer cooler."
"Overall, this finished up on a strong note. While nothing earth-shattering, Karlovaċko had a decent flavor and was an interesting find."
"The body is light and lifeless, completing the picture of an uninspired and an uninspiring beer. I feel an acute attack of extreme boredom threatening to overtake me and may not have the strength to finish this review. This is lousy beer, plain and simple. I still think Karlovacko vs. Godzilla would make a great creature feature."
"Being Croatian, I grew up with this beer. A staple at all Croatian soccer games and post game celebrations. Hoppy flavour, with just the right malt undertones. The appearance is nothing to gawk at, but you will be rewarded upon finishing a bottle of this pilsener. Perfectly balanced beer that could be made better by removing some of the carbonation. Otherwise, it is a must try and enjoy."
"Number six in the 10 new bland commie lagers at the LCBO. This ones pour is a little more on the gold side of pale straw but the same crystal clear fizzy cap vanishing character as most of em. Vague light malt sweetness and some spice and medicinal grassy hops. Same fizzy bland watery mouth feel and mild malt/hop mix....5 of these type of fizzy vapid commercial Slavic lagers is all I can take..quick a porter so I can confirm I still have taste buds!!"
"I would pass on this beer again. There is really nothing that distinguishes it from other international macro lagers."
"This beer seemed rather lifeless and ordinary to me. There are quite a few good beers to be found in Eastern Europe, but this isn't one of the better ones."
"Bottle: Poured a golden yellow beer with a nice white bubbly head with average retention. Aroma is quite weak but some malt can be detected. Taste is quite not enough crisp with some malt that can be detected and some very light bitterness at the end. Overall, I would classified this as a better then average lager without any skunk taste from the bottle which is a major accomplishment."
"This brew is a fairly dark golden color, with a bubbly white head topping it off. Clean malt scent, touch of hops. Grainy malt taste, some bitter hops rounding out the back. This is a pretty dry drink. This certainly isnt the worst beer, but it is pretty standard for the category."
"Ok this beer pretty well sucks as Red Cap tastes better and I didn't exactly laud that brew. I expected some semblance of taste and was given a vacuum that sucked all flavour out this beer. For sweet jesus aren't all Eastern European beers at least supposed to taste like something. Those poor Croatians are subjected to this poor excuse for a lager."
"Not bad, drinkable on a hot summer afternoon. Mine said draught. Perhaps I should list it as a new beer as the bottle is different. Unoffensive though not creamy. Mild bitterness.. Citrus floral, there's hops in there. Golden yellow with nice white foam. A bit sweet, and fruity. Neutral, fine with lunch. I''ve had worse pils"
"A bulbous creamy white head sits atop a light golden pils with Little carbonation. Mose is mostly gas. malt lingers in the background. taste holds not much flavor. Bailey perceivable malt . This would be a great lawn-mower beer. mouth is smooth, but a little watery."
"I had this one in Croatia after a day at the beach and it hit the spot for that moment. Just enough flavor to make it refreshing on a hot august day. There were mild hops and malt. The glass was laced nicely at the end and the color was a beautiful golden that refracted the sun nicely if you held it up right. It was a good pilsner. Certainly better than most of the beers passing themselves off as pilsners in America. I also found it very drinkable later that evening as I enjoyed several more."
"Drinkability: great, I felt like drinking more, I will purchase this one again"
"Very drinkable, I will buy this again."
"A pretty good pilsner beer. Interesting with the herbal hop flavor. I just recently saw this in my neck of the woods, and I'll certainly get it again. A great beer for damp summer heat."
"The quintessential lager translucent golden yellow on the pour with the head large and spumescent, the color a bright white and the residual lace a sealing sheet to obscure the glass. Nose is citrus crisp, malt sweet, clean and pleasant with the start cloyingly sweet, modest malt profile and the top cadaverous. Finish is meekly acidic, the hops sparse and lacking any real bite, dry aftertaste."
"Pale golden in color, thin white head in the straight-sided pint glass. Spicy hop aroma with a decent malt backup; rather lackluster. Mineral content in the finish, yet very clean like a Czech pils. The hops seem to be the best part of this beer. I'm just someone that can appreciate an good eastern European hop. This one delivers if you're looking for a German/Czech lager meld."
"Better than I was expecting. Though certainly not a Pilsner Urquell/Czechvar, this doesn't completely disappoint, and this is one I'd possibly have again."
"My first beer from Croatia and it was very mediocre. Poured a golden yellow color with a medium sized head that quickly disappeared. The aroma was bitter with some strong grassy notes. The flavor was average. This pilsner is crisp but unrefreshing. It has a sharp bitterness and slightly thicker-body on the tongue. The bitterness last long into the aftertaste."
"This is not a pampered beer. This is one that has been working 60 hour weeks in a factory since it was 6 years old. A factory where the lunch room is a mess and the employees grumble out loud in a foreign language. Gritty, greasy, factotum lager."
"Well. It comes in a nice big bottle so there's lots of it to drink if that's your objkective. Otherwise I'd give it a pass."
"a pleasant surprise here. certainly nota geat beer, but much more drinkable than i suspected after numerous euro-lagers and pilsners the past couple of days. pours a nice golden colour with a strong head that dissolves into a lasting lace. no skunkiness here, largely thanks to the choice of a brown bottle over a green one, most likely. smells of grain and malt and the taste is just that. a bit watery but not corona-esque watery. a pleasantly smooth brew that has a bit less carbonation than a standard pilsner. again, not spectacular, but certainly drinkable."
"Okay the folks over in Croatia need to pay attention to what the folks over Poland or Czech. are doing because this brew leaves much to be desired. Poured as I expected a light straw color with a massive amount of carbonation. Smell is pungent, grassy and earthy. Taste is watery, muddy, when combined with the pungent nose you get with each sip makes for a truly unpleasant drinking experience."
"Came in a brown 500ml bottle with best before date stamped on back label. Is an average clear straw hue, big white head upon pour that recedes to a thin ring. Smells of very light malt and metal. Metallic flavour is most predominant as well, a bit of graininess, it's pretty dry though, aftertaste of iron. The mouthfeel is rather watery. Actually my mouth tastes like I just sucked on some loose change. I'll be passing on this stuff next time."
"The taste started out a bit hoppy, became sweet, but finished a bit dry with just a hint of herbal bitterness. Creamy and smooth mouthfeel. Not a bad effort on this beer, but it seems atypical for a pilsener style lager because of the lack of clarity."
"Not bad at all. Not great, but definitely Above Average and worth trying."
"16.9 oz. brown bottle. It pours a crystal-clear, bright yellow-gold body with a foamy bright-white head that holds OK before dropping to a thin collar that leaves some thin lace. Standard sized bubbles rise steadily towards the surface. The nose expresses a clean and sweetly grainy maltiness that's backed by mild floral and spicy hops. The body is distinctly medium with a crisp carbonation. The flavor mirrors the aroma with a grainy maltiness that's lightly sweet but well infused with gentle floral and spicy hop flavor; and backed by a firm bitterness. Overall, a pretty average European lager (although it's clean and un-skunked!)."
"Clear yellow in color, with a proud, fluffy, white head. Unfortunately, the aroma department yields up nothing. Dry, slightly vegetal, nothing else. Body is light, texture has some small graininess in it, and a truly cloying sweetness pervades the lasting finish. Ultimately, a lack of flavor and overwhelming blandness is the hallmark of this lager. I'm still searching for the great beer of Croatia...sigh..."
"Poured a light golden color with a perfectly white head that settled into a thin lace. It did have a touch of skunk at first, but after letting set for a minute it faded and the beer had no real aroma. Maybe it was just the bottle I had, but the beer felt very flat in my mouth. It was also difficult to decern specific flavors in this beer, it just seemed very sweet. The only way I can describe it is a sweeter tasting Budweiser. I was not impressed at all."
"This pours with a fluffy white head over pale straw colored liquid. Nose is slightly skunked, with some light malt aromas. Taste is slightly metallic, a bit hoppy and light. Finishes pleasant and clean, an unassuming lager."
"a croatian pilsener.  i had mine in a dark 330 ml bottle.  very clear, very pale yellow in color. a minimal head with a touch of lace.  had a hard time picking up anything in the aroma....maybe a tad of mustiness and just a touch of hops.  nice smooth mouthfeel....tastes pretty neutral...clean and refreshing with a tongue tingling hop bite in the end.  dry finish.  easy drinking.  i'd call it croatian budweiser for lack of any other apt descriptions."
"Karlovacko:  A Croatian Pilsener, in a dark brown 500 ml bottle.  It is pure white head (that sticks and leaves very nice lace), over an absolutely clear, pale yellow beer. Clean aroma of light hops. This beer simply tastes like a non-skunked euro-lager, with a strange sour/dryness in the finish that is not unpleasant.  Also had a relatively creamy mouth feel for a Pilsner.  Very easy to drink.  Not bad."
