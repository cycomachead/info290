2.75,-21.7,3,3,2.5,2.5,3,"This brew looked like most pilsners do, it had the typical yellow color white a head. it was light bodied and nicely carbonated. The flavor was a little odd though, to me it had a sour flavor similar to a Flemish red. In my opinion I don't believe that I'd ever seek this out again. I just wasn't a huge fan.","Knapp85","Apr 03, 2011"
3.82,8.8,3,3.5,4,3,4.5,"Medium bodied with a very light honey color. Pretty tasty pilsner. Again, kind of watery. Subtle and balanced hops and another easy drinker.","cosmicevan","Nov 21, 2010"
2.21,-37,2.5,1.5,2.5,2,2.5,"D- I apologize in advance to my friends at Lancaster, but this is not a good beer. Barely any flavor, no scent at all, and it looks ugly too. If you're going to the brewpub, avoid this at all costs...unless you're a domestic light drinker and are afraid of beer with flavor","bigfnjoe","Mar 24, 2010"
1.76,-49.9,2.5,1.5,2,1.5,1.5,"The hops are slightly spicy and the beer unfiltered. White pepper and overly light body set back the roundness and crispness of the beer. A touch sour and heavily carbonated. Very dry and oily. Unfiltered.","TLove","Nov 23, 2009"

3.41,-2.8,3.5,2.5,3.5,3,4.5,"This beer is a bright clear yellow color with a thin head and no real lacing to speak of. It had no smell that were strong enough for me to pick up on other then hops/citrus. It tasted much the same as its smell with a wonderful hop bite to it. This was a good clean Pilsner.","rafjr00","Jan 02, 2008"
3.41,-2.8,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D- This is a decent and drinkable summer lager. Crisp and refreshing for hot days. Easy to session and drink a lot of. Not something I will run out and buy again but something I can easily drink.","PittBeerGirl","Aug 06, 2007"
3.53,0.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A nice beer, but no Czech Pilsener. There's a relatively big citrus hops taste that's far too American. It comes across similar to Brooklyn Pilsner. The citrus has more specific sweet grapefruit undertones with pale grains lingering in the back. For the style the malt was too mild and the hops too American, but style aside, its not a bad beer.","tempest","Jul 08, 2007"
3.07,-12.5,2.5,3,3,3,3.5,"Pours a hazy light amber with a big foamy head. Must be unfiltered because there are lots of yeast particles floating around which I had to let settle. Color and lack of clarity are off for a pilsner. Good head retention during that settling time. Smell is big on the hops. Taste is also a bit hoppier than expected, with a bit of sweetness and also a bit yeasty. Relatively crisp but also somewhat slick on the tongue...again, odd for a pilsner. Overall this beer is pretty tasty, but it's weird. Not what I was expecting in a pilsner, and so as a pilsner it's very mediocre.","number1bum","Jan 30, 2007"
3.28,-6.6,4,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Looks pretty good, and the nose is respectable with a little biscuity hop presence. The flavor has potential, but is ultimately too watery and dull.

3.3,-6,3,3,3,4,4,"The beer is light on the palate with a soft fruity, almost caramel like sweetness to it. The finish has a dry, toasted biscuit note to it that intermingles with an herbal hop bitterness. The herbal hop note shines from beginning to end, it is perhaps the most noticeable flavor here, and provides a nice foil for the uncharacteristic caramel sweet malt notes. This is certainly an interesting take on a Pilsner, more of an Amber ale even. It is pretty tasty though and quite quaffable; on a purely hedonistic scale this beer is pretty good, but it is a far cry from a Pilsner.","Gueuzedude","Feb 18, 2006"
3.8,8.3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"presented as a deep golden color beverage with impressive white puffy head. Smell was mainly of sweetish hops, and while not overly enjoyable, was acceptable. Taste is pleasant and a nice maltiness brings a nice slighty hoppy taste to the mouth. Finish is somewhat disappointingn but a slight hoppiness gin=ves some salvation. All things considered, not a bad beer.","tgbljb","Feb 02, 2006"

3.85,9.7,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours unusually dark for a pilsner. Pours a hazy light copper colour with a pretty nice white fluffy head. Smell has a bit of spice and floral hoppy snap to it. Taste has just a touch of malty sweetness at the forefront before it is jerked back like a bungi cord by the hops. The beer finishes crisp and clean as it should. Mouthfeel is sharp with nice fine carbonation that keeps the beer fresh on the palate. Drinkability is also good. These went down really well on a hot day.","TinusTime","Aug 06, 2005"
4.05,15.4,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours a clear dark copper/amber color. The head is thick, almost a dirty white and there is a lot of lacing. There is quite a bit of sediment on the bottom of the glass. The scent is somewhat metallic, somewhat sweet maltiness, and a grassy hops. The flavor is hops, and they are spicy. The grassy spicy hops flavors comes through kicking. There is a slight flavor of sweet malts, maybe some dark fruits. Overall very smooth, very interesting blend of malts and hops. Nice pilsner.","robertp1024","Jul 22, 2005"
4.03,14.8,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a hazy orange with a finger of rocky white head and a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is is a subdued grass, hay, and floral hops.

This is a pretty nice easy drinking pilsner.","cubedbee","Jul 19, 2005"
3.2,-8.8,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,4,"Mouthfeel is medium but heavier than a pilsner should be. This is a good beer but I have to bring the numbers down a little because I think they missed the style.","assurbanipaul","Jul 17, 2005"
4.07,16,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"From a 12 ounce bottle that was purchased at the brewpub. Pours a burnt-golden color with a fair amount of haze. An initially thick white head quickly falls, but never completely disappears. The lace is decent. Crisp, floral, spicy, sharp hop aroma. Just a little soft sweetness is present in the foretaste, followed quickly by a poignant, snappy hop flavor. The spicy hop character completes the taste, which finishes clean and abrupt. Medium to light in body, low carbonation for the style. Tasty and drinkable.","Suds","Jun 19, 2005"
4.23,20.5,4.5,4,4,4,5,"Served up a case to a mixed crowd on Mother's Day. At party's end this bottle was the last in the cooler. I'd say that makes for a good crossover beer.

It is easy to drink, not too heavy, and not too grainy and ""bready"" tasting, which is what bothers me about a lot of pils. Overall, a crisp, light, nicely crafted brew from Lancaster.","Fish113d","May 01, 2005"
3.69,5.1,4,2.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Drinkability and Overall: This is an excellent pilsener from and excellent brewery.

4.04,15.1,5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Notes: Though not quite a five star quality in every way, this would definitely be a solid session brew. Drinking this makes me imagine myself out on the Grady White, bobbing around, doing my best to catch all the flounder at the Jersey shore.","Dithyramb","Jan 21, 2005"
3.28,-6.6,3.5,3,3,3.5,4,"12 ounce bottle. If you told me this was an English Bitter I could have believed it. Not a bad drinking beer, but a bit off style for a Pils.

Roasted grain is what I first smelled, though after a while I believe it smelled like hay. There was some roasted scent, malt and a bit of spice notes sprinkled about over the hay. The flavor was a bit sweet with malts while have a roasted grain character to it as well. There were a good amount of hops balancing it out and lending a nice bitterness to it as well. Mouthfeel was about average with no notable aspects standing out or detracting from this brew. With a pretty good flavor this was definitely an easy drinking brew I could put down a few of if I was in the mood for a pilsner.","meathookjones","Aug 19, 2004"

3.47,-1.1,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a hazed golden pils color with a white head and a few surprise chunks (I mean chunks) of protein coagulation. Bready and husky malt aroma. Pretty clean taste but somewhat flawed for some reason; predominantly malty and husky, with minimal hops other than a small bite. Pretty good but not my favorite style of pilsener.","crookedhalo","Jul 28, 2004"
3.69,5.1,4.5,3,4,3,4,"This arrived with a great head in evidence! There was also a good bit of effervesence in a brew that was a beautiful golden-yellow color. It had a light grassy, grain-like smell, but it was so weak as to almost be imperceptible. There was a very light mouthfeel, but an extremely dry, crisp finish. There was decent head retention throughout and the ""Belgian lace"" that was left behind was beautiful.","woodychandler","Jul 28, 2004"
3.6,2.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured a slightly cloudy golden color with a creamy white head of foam topping the brew off. The aroma has a good balance of fruity sweet hops and musty malt. The taste is fruity with sweet malts that combines with a pleasant bitterness. Some floral sweetness and caramel spiciness comes through. The beer is medium bodied and pretty well blended. Not as crisp and tasty as other Pilsners. This is actually more like a Golden fest beer. More sweeter than I expected, but fine nevertheless.","pezoids","Jul 15, 2004"
3.97,13.1,3.5,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a gold color with a thin white lace head. The aroma is good. It boasts of pale malts and some damn fine smelling hops. The taste is good as well. It is pale and grainy, with a nice hop flavor. It has no real malt complexity, but it still goes down easy with a smooth finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This beer drinks well. It's a fine golden ale with nice hop characteristics.","WesWes","Apr 26, 2004"
2.97,-15.4,2.5,3,3,3,3,"Notes: Certainly not the pilsner I was expecting  is this flawed or was it intentional? Cloudy with a stuggling crispness  this beer does nothing for me. Not horrible but not a beer Id go back to.","Jason","Apr 05, 2004"

3.59,2.3,3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a hazy darker gold color, with a spotty surface head. No lacing at all through the drink. The aroma was nice as malt and hay / grass were quite noticeable. The flavor followed the aroma as malt, hay, and reasonable bitterness hit the tastebuds. The mouthfeel was smooth and somewhat thick for a pilsner. The carbonation was very light and there was no crispness. The malt rode the tongue for several seconds after swallowing. Not overly exciting, but better than average.","Gavage","Mar 06, 2004"

4.18,19.1,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a fluffy bright white head. Clear, deep yellow liquid...a shade or so darker than the usual Pils. Nose is zesty maltiness with grassy and lightly herbal hop notes, nice and clean. The taste is crisp and hoppy right out of the gate. Substantial maltiness gives this great body and mouthfeel. More grassy/citrusy hoppiness appears mid-line, finishes on a slightly metallic hop note. A great example of an American pilsner, reccomended!","beerluvr","Feb 22, 2004"
4.03,14.8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Drinkability&Notes: After taking about 15 minutes to pour (the head on this thing is insane, it has all the staying power of beaten egg whites), this beer presents a nicely smooth drinking experience.

3.92,11.7,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"This pilsner poured a cloudy golden-colored appearance with a decent frothy head. Rather slow but steady carbonation rose to the top of the glass, and there was some spotty lacing on the glass at the end. The smell was characteristically pilsner, with strong Saaz hops, floral notes, and a subdued malty presence. The taste was very bitter with grassy elements, mellow, but crisp and sharp at the same time. It finished with a somewhat bread-like doughy taste. The feel was prickly on the tongue, paving the way for the bitterness of the taste. Lancaster Brewing has some good stuff, and this pilsner is a fine example. Crisp and refreshingly bitter, I really enjoyed this beer. Very drinkable and recommended.","SchmichaelJ","Oct 11, 2003"
4.3,22.5,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This is a sophisticated, nuanced, soft and spicy pilsner. A pilsner to be envied by brewers in Plzen, and to be tasted by those who only have been taken in by the advertised True Pilsner of Miller Brewing. The pour is the first clue that your are about to taste a fresh, American pilsner, not one that has spent weeks on a ship in who knows what condition. The aroma is soft and enticing with a wisp of grass and straw and a subtle floral note, no doubt from the three types of hops in the brew. The taste is mouthfilling with a superb balance between the slight toastiness of the ample malt and the above mentioned sophistication of the hopping process. Spicy pepper from the Saaz and a mellow bitterness from the German hops gives a refreshing, crisp note to the mid palate. Finishes with some mouth coating maltiness, then a final residual, floral bitterness. Well done.","QXSTER1","Sep 08, 2003"
3.92,11.7,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Appearance: Pours with a vigorous volcanically flowing white head with chunks of yeast floating in a suspension from this bottled conditioned beauty, no born on date so something tells me this one could be a little aged, but either way this one held up nicely with a magnificant golden hue sporting huge patches of silky lacing round my conical shaped pilsner glass. Did I mention how amazing the retention of this pillow like mountainous head appears after quite a challenging pour? Aroma: Delicate light malt sweetness with an in your face amount of Saaz hops coming through not a bad pils at all, very welcoming on a warm day would like to seek this one out on draft. Taste: A bready yet grassy character makes for a crisp refreshing pilsner beer with more than a sufficient balance of hops in the bitterness department, semi-simple yet a style and beer here to be enjoyed by all beer lovers. Mouthfeel: Lighter bodied beer with a decent amount of jet stream of carbonation, perfect fullness in the humid summer days I've been living in. Drinkability: A wonderful session brew not to challenging (except for the pouring), but to the taste buds a great escape of simple enjoyment in a botlle. I could easily put away a sixer without thinking about it, very nice brew.","WVbeergeek","Sep 01, 2003"
3.96,12.8,4,3,4.5,4,4,"I was after Christian to make a Pils from the day Lancaster Malt Brewing opened. I mean when the brewer's name is Heim and it's in Lancaster, PA; you'd think it was a no brainer. Well, it was about three years before they rolled this beer out and it has become my favorite of the year round items they make. It's a little on the toasty side but with a very nice malt/hops tension. It's actually the hoppiest beer they make (it wasn't called Lancaster MALT for nothin') which suits me fine. It would probably look better in a pilsner glass and when I take the occaisional jug home, that's what I use. Gold Star is one of the reasons east central Penna is the pilsner capital of the New World.","BeerIsland","May 02, 2003"
3.92,11.7,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"5.5% abv. Lancaster Brewing's flagship lager pours a clear, deep golden body that releases tiny, slow moving bubbles upward towards it's frothy white head. It's retention is limited, but it maintains a thin creamy surface covering throughout most of the glass and leaves some spotty lace. The nose expresses bright floral and grassy hops as well as some background maltiness. The body is on the light side, but it's enhanced by a very fine carbonation that gently caresses the tongue before sliding across the palate. An unimposing, lightly grainy malt acts as a base for loads of fresh, floral and spicy hop flavor and a bold bitterness at 33 IBU's. Well-balanced and quite impressive in its bitterness level! They're obviously not trying for a cross-over beer with this one - it's clearly within the range of the North German style. It finishes with some hop flavor upfront, followed by a dollop of lightly sweet grainy malt, and then some more swirling hop flavors amongst a bone-dry bitterness. Exceptionally clean and very well done. Quaffable!","NeroFiddled","Mar 24, 2003"
