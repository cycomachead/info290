3.88,8.4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 5/29/2014. Pours slightly hazy golden straw color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon, orange zest, cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, orange zest, cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, grass, pepper, pine, and herbal earthiness. Good amount of earthy herbal/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, orange zest, cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, grass, pepper, pine, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and balance of pale malt and earthy hop flavors; with a great crisp malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Very clean in flavor as well with minimal yeast ester presence. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Czech pilsener style. All around good robustness and balance of pale malt and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 16, 2014"

The nose was slightly sweet with a cotton candy-like scent. Interesting. Mouthfeel was medium and there was no sweetness on the tongue. This was super dry, like the Zephyr winds blowing across the Sahara desert! Whew. Breathtakingly dry, literally. I was NOT expecting that. Described on the label as ""Our Bohemian Pilsner", it did not lack for Saaz hops either on the tongue or on the finish. I was left gasping for air. More please, sir and pass the pitcher of water while you are at it. I may need to rehydrate after this one.","woodychandler","May 07, 2010"

Bear in mind that I scored its appearance relative to that of other pilsners. Lightly sweet aromas, reminiscent of a bin of ripe lemons. The taste is too sweet up front for my liking and I'm grateful for the lingering bitter finish that eventually balances it out. Overall, this beer is not a bad choice and would make a welcome companion out in the sunshine.","droomyster","Jul 23, 2009"
3.31,-7.5,4,3,3,3.5,4,"Apart from the diacetyl, which hopefully is a single batch error, this is a pretty decent Czech-style pils. The malt is at the right level, bitterness is at the right level, and the hop flavors are at the right level. A little bit more hops in the nose would be nice, but OK. It's nicely balanced, and there's enough character to keep it interesting beyond one. Nice.","NeroFiddled","Jul 19, 2009"

3.65,2,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"An okay pilsner, and I prefer the ones with a little lighter and crisper malt flavor. The hops have a perfume-like in the aroma, and biting in the flavor, which I think is the better half of the beer. The malts need a little work.","BeerSox","Jun 25, 2009"
