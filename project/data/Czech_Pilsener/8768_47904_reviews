"It is medium in body with a modest level of carbonation. It has a crisp bitterness at times and is enjoyable but it could be even more enjoyable if some of the residual sugar was stripped away. Unique and worth trying if you get the chance."

"Overall, it's semi-sweet in a body that straddles the line between light and medium all the way. Crisp and bright, it moves gently into a semi-dry finish."

"Very enjoyable beer that tasted better poured than from the can. The pilsner malt flavor wasn't over bearing or too strong as is the case with most pilsners. It was a well balanced beer. There was little to no hop aroma or flavor. It was very light in color and taste."
"Yes, yet another can courtesy of the creator of the canquest, woodychandler. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of grains, malts, a touch of sweetness. Taste is crisp, malts, grains, a touch of bitterness at the finish, easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is an easy drinking, refreshing beer."

"A nice, loud Crack! revealed a brimful CAN, so in salute to the brewers, I utilized an inverted Glug. The pseudo-cascade was brilliant, finally settling into two fingers of dense, foamy, bone-white head with great retention. Color was like liquid sunshine with a slight haziness (SRM = 4 to 5), perfect for a rainy spring afternoon. The three gold stooges, Croesus, Mammon and Midas seemed to agree as they all showed up for a taste, but I was having none of it. It had a nicely controlled spicy nose, just enough to tickle my sinuses and get my mouth watering, but not enough to be too much of a good thing. Mouthfeel was medium and the Saaz hops really interacted well with the yeast and the malt knew enough to stand pat, creating the king of Pilsner that I really dig. Too many AALs under the bridge and GER Pilsners tend to be too sweet for my liking. Finish was dry, slightly spicy, slightly grassy and definitely refreshing. This would be ideal on a hot, humid summer's day."

"Poured to a nice, full head with good retention and lacing. Head was white and fairly dense. appearance was a light, straw color with a slight haze. Aroma had some fruit and yeasty notes. Tastes light with some mild grass and grain notes. Mild aftertaste with a medium mouth feel."

"It's better then thier brown lager, I'll say that."

"12oz can. Pours a clear golden straw color with virtually no head. Minimal lacing. The aroma is sweet malts with some sour notes. Some floral hops with hints of hay. The taste is a nice mix of malts and cereal. Slightly sour with some toasted malts toward the end. Some floral hop bitterness. Light and crisp mouthfeel. Overall, decent Pilsner."

"Still a decent drinking pilsner."

"O- Not a bad pilsner, I'm not crazy about the citrus aspect but the malt flavors are very nice."

"Golden clear color with a two inch head and some lace on the glass. The smell is mostly a citrusy grassy aroma, with a faint cereal grain. The taste has that nice grassy, lemony, doughy characteristic found in a summery pils. The finish has a nice hoppy bite followed by a clean crisp maltiness. Great option for the summer time, refreshing and easy-drinking."
""
"O- Very refreshing pilsner that displays the taste profile I look for. The grassy and lemony flavors are both in full effect and excellent"

"O: Took a shot on a brewery I had never heard of, and it paid off. It isn't mind blowing, but definitely a solid beer that I could drink all the time."
""
"O: This beer becomes a lot more drinkable as it warms up and bready malts dominate more of the flavor and are accompanied by sweetness."
"O- where has this been all my life one of the best I've had this summer. Great choice for those not yet into crafts, really tasty and a great American pilsner"
"Cheers!!!"
"A solid beer with some good dextrins holding it up. Will be drinking much more of this until the playoffs draw to a close."
"From a growler fill from Brazen Head. Pours a light straw color with small sized head. Smells slightly floral with a bit of banana action. Very light body with lingering carmel-ish sweetness. Hops not really assertive enough on this one for my liking, and the resulting is a fairly tired beer. Not the best Kelso style around."
"Only tastes from now on in the BeerQuest. Only tastes."
"Drinkability: A solid pilsner- a faithful interpretation of the style."
"D: Defintily a drinkable beer. Nothing to say WOW about but refreshing and tasty."
"Like the scent, it had a limited taste. It had some maltiness to it, but not that nice biting sourness that I like from a Czech Pils. Lacks a bitterness to it. Very...meh."
"D: I liked this beer quite a lot. Very nice example of the style. Boring but great."
"D: Perfectly boring for a daily drinker. I need a sunny day for this."
"Tastes of roasted malt, yeast, light grains and some very faint hops. Very light and crisp, with mild flavor and good lacing. A middle of the road to above average pilsner that fits in the pilsner category well. Easy to drink, just a bit boring as far as flavor goes for my liking."
"hop bitterness overpowers any spicy notes that this beer has. Overall i would say too much bittering in this beer, it ruins any real hop character that a good vzech pils needs. Decent body."
"Not a bad example at all, and worth a look if you come across it."
"I had never heard of this brewery before but I really enjoyed the beer when I had it. A very good crisp pilsner quality with a decent aroma and great flavor. Very refreshing; i think I drank it down in about two minutes. Would recommend this one if you can find it."
"Nicely drinkable beer, great with food. I'd like a bit more of a grassy hop character, a bit less spicy, but that's a relatively minor quibble."
