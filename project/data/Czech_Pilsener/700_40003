Nose was redolent with ginger! It should have read "... Brewed with Ginger and Pumpkin", instead. Mouthfeel was light, not thin, but very effervescent. The taste was almost completely ginger. Finish was super-dry with the ginger flavor actually ramping up in intensity at the extreme finish. Wow! This would be fantastic with sushi and as a palate cleanser, it was a welcome change of pace. However, I would recommend against an entire bomber to oneself (which I did not do, BTW).","woodychandler","Jun 18, 2014"

It's flavors and essence steer a wide path from traditional beer flavors, but a slow and ponderous sip will still yield healthy notes of honey-sweet malts and earthy hops.

Aroma dominated by ginger (smells like fresh crystallized ginger) with light grassy hops and sweet malt. Flavor starts as a hoppy pilsner, lightly grassy with sweet malt and spicy hops, finishing pleasantly spicy ginger and hops. Very nice flavor progression and well balanced. Surprisingly strong flavors for a low ABV beer. On the light side of medium bodied. I really enjoyed this, but would have liked a bit more pumpkin flavor. Quite ginger forward, which I liked.","LiquidAmber","Oct 20, 2012"

3.93,24.8,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Fuller bodied than expected with peppery ginger spice up front followed by earthy, grassy hops, sweet malt, pumpkin, and biscuit. The spicy ginger and floral hop flavors go really well together, providing a refreshing and unique take on the style. Underneath, there is a sweet caramel malt backbone with some biscuit, autumnal spice and sweet pumpkin. Similarly to the aroma, the pumpkin flavor is subtle but comes more to the forefront as it warms. Complex and full bodied yet refreshing and and easy to drink. This unique take on the style could have been a disaster but I'm pretty impressed with this beer.","corby112","Oct 15, 2012"

A bit odd on the palate, a big blast of ginger and something vaguely phenolic up front, biscuity pils malts, a dash of pumpkin, Good & Plenties and melted Gummi Bears. Kind of acrid in the finish.

3.03,-3.8,4,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,"I had this at the 2007 pumpkin festival at Elysian. This is a pumpkin beer, but I've listed it as a Czech pilsner rather than as a pumpkin ale because it is most decidedly not an ale- and the division between lager and ale seems to take precedence over spicing. The brewery lists it as a ginger pumpkin pilsner. Brewed with pale, Munich, and Cara-hells malts; bittered with US Northern Brewer and finished with Czech Saaz hops. Pumpkin was added to the mash and kettle and chopped fresh ginger was added to te end of the boil. Starting gravity was 15.1 degrees plato. It poured blonde with lots of effervescence and a good head. The smell has a light nuttiness and light ginger aroma. The taste is a weird blend of traditional pilsner crsip flralness and pumpkin with some medicinal bitterness from the ginger on the finish. Not entirely successful. Mouthfeel is slippery and a bit soapy, also missing the mark. It's not like it is a drain pour or anything, but it just didn't really work. Interesting experiment and I applaud them for that, but I don't think I'd have it again- but I'm glad I got to try it once.","Georgiabeer","0"
