Mild, yet solid bitterness. Clean malt provides a mild sweetness and counterpoint for floral hops. Malt finishes short, leaving the hop bitterness and flavour to linger. Quite nice actually. Moderately high carbonation that adds to a creamy texture once it settles a bit. Light body, but never thin. A very enjoyable pilsner.

The taste begins with a hoppy punch and some great malt flavors that build in the middle to take precedence and then recede in the finish. The aftertaste is bitter and grassy, very pleasant.

Malty, certainly, but a very honeyish malt flavour, as opposed to the fuller Budvar maltiness, that comes from the very pale malts. Has that characteristic Czech trick of vanishing down your throat before you even realize it. Leaves behind a slowly creeping, rich, floral bitterness.","stoutman","Dec 16, 2003"

Taste: Middle of the road on my spectrum but still a tasty Czech beer that I'm glad I had the opportunity to sample, lemongrass tone to it with a decent hop bite of bitterness nothing spectacular but fends well against other Euro lagers. Mouthfeel: Thin to light in body does lack a bit of carbonation for the style but a smooth cohesive tone.

Pathetic head that disipated too film. Bittersweet smell with little hops, some honey, and barley malt. Hey, this tastes alright. Not as bad as I was expecting from the look and smell. Well balanced sweet and bitterness, with a honey aftertaste. Not perfectly balanced, but a fine attempt was made. Slick mouthfeel and left my throat a little dry. Very drinkable.

They can't, this brew took time. Brew time and cellar time. The quality of ingredients and process are there for the palate to enjoy on this Pilsner. Soft barley and malt tastes balanced with those heavenly saaz bitters. A great example of Czech pilsen style lagers. This one has a distinguishing quality though. It has everything required of a good Pilsner, flowery hopping evident to the nose and palate, sharp crisp start, tart/malty/grassy in the mouth  dry finish except, this one has no lingering ""tinny"" taste to the tongue from the saaz hops....probably not pasteurized. I liked this Pilsner very much and that takes something for this fanatical ""Pils head"".  The only draw back is the price. $2.85 per 500mil bottle. I was surprised this beer was so fresh tasting, date code was near expired and it sat unrefrigerated on the LCBO (our state liquor monopoly) shelf.

The taste is fairly sweet at first, with some nice (very) subtle bitter notes.  The kicker and what makes this beer is the sweet honey aftertaste.  It lingers long and well to a very nice effect.  Very smooth with a slightly syrupy feel, this is definitely drinkable.","the42ndtourist","0"
