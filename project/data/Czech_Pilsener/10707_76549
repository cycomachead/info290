I tried a few different Josephsbraus since you can make your own six-pack at Trader Joe's. I didn't care for a couple of the others, so my expectations were probably pretty low. Not sure if I'll buy it again, but I would certainly grab one from a cooler at a barbecue or picnic.","Prefabu","Mar 13, 2015"

It's got lots of Noble hop bitterness and the tartness I expect, but it's lacking enough Pils malt flavors to make it keep it from being a one note wonder. It's definitely a ""a celebration of noble hops."" Yet it's not much more than, though. On the back label on the bottle it says it's 32 IBUs, which is again what it tastes like, which is a now what most German Pils' are. Again, it's not bad, but not up to the standards of the beer I've been drinking from Franken and from other Bayernbiere. A 3.5 of 5.","boddhitree","Apr 19, 2014"

A little bit of a vegetal character before a finish of toasted malt and grassy bitterness. Light body with moderate carbonation. This beer is a little messy, moving from flavor to flavor without any real transitions. There are much better pilsner options out there. This is largely average at best.","ColForbinBC","May 02, 2013"

Also, there just seemed to be too much astringency which made the bitterness sharp. The astringency can be avoided by making sure your ph does not get too high when sparging.

3.43,4.3,3.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"T: Very smooth bready malts upfront with a trace of grassy and resinous hops in the back. A faint but lingering hop bitterness on the finish. To be honest, this beer was close, but didn't quite have the style down. The malts are there but the hops don't shine enough to give it that refreshing bite that good czech pilsners have. Still not a bad beer though and maybe my favorite of the josephs brau offerings.","notchucknorris","0"
