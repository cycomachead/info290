"2/13/15 - Bottle - Good Shiner offering, my favorite from this brewer to date. Light, crisp beer has a good taste, hops were noticeable but not very strong, taste was good and had character compared to other shiner offerings. Nice light offering, and would definitely order again."
"Crystal clear golden in color. Minimal head dissapating quickly and minimal lacing. Aroma is very light with malt, toast and a touch of citrus coming through. Taste is very light with bready and earthiness being the dominant flavors. Carbonation is nice and mouthfeel is good. This beer, being a pilsner, is still lacking the flavor and balance that I would have expected......."

"O - not a great example of a Czech style pilsner, but it's ok. I wouldn't get this again."

"Clear bronze color, small lining of head around the glass, nose of malt and nuttiness, smooth and light mouthfeel with a taste of lots of grain."

"O pretty enjoyable shiner brew fitting for the summer heat. Had in Alaskan Shaker pint at Metzlers in Denton paired with german potatoe salad."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a translucent straw color with a good size head, but that dissipates quickly. Smells of a nice sweet grain profile, not that atypical of pilsner, but stronger than many adjuncts. Tastes of sweet grain, nice profile. Beer is light bodied, very drinkable, carbonated correctly. Overall, an above average beer."

"Overall a pretty decent pils."
"O: It's alright. The weak flavor holds it back more than anything. To be fair, though, I like my Czech pilsners hopped to fuck and back, so I can't hold it against this brew too much. Don't think I'd buy it again (if it appeared in a 6-pack), though."

"It's got a nice, warm light amber color, but no lasting head and very little lacing. Malty, yeasty nose with very little hint of hops. The malty sweetness is prominent on the tongue. There is some mild citrus hop notes, but the hop bitterness is almost entirely in the finish, more than fine for the non-hop-heads among us. Not especially carbonated either, but sessionable and highly drinkable. Mildly recommended, although for the price I think I'd grab the more hop-forward Noble Pils from Sam Adams or the Summer Pils from one of Texas' other great breweries, St. Arnold's."

"Malty and quite dry pils. Dark malts, some light smoke and rye notes. Dry through the finish. Decent."

"Not the most flavorful pils but no off flavors. Again, easy drinking brew."

"Overall - good beer overall. for a pilsner it has quite a bit of flavor, one of the hoppier pils I've had. worth a try."

"Well made Czech Pilsner."

"Overall this is a great example of a great simple beer. If it were more readily available in my area, I would gladly replace this with any of your typical lagers or pilsners. Recommended!"
"I tasted a slight fruit with a good malt with a little bit of yeast residue. It is a fairly light beer. It is a great beer for a good hot summer lawn mowing day. Not bad for football season."
"This beer pours a clear, gold color with half-inch head and lasting lace. It's aroma is citrusy with hints of bread and hops. The flavor has notes of lemon and dough with some vanilla in the background. There is a mild bitterness that fades quickly. This has a light mouthfeel and is very sessionable and refreshing. Spoetzl Shiner 101 Czech Style Pilsner is a good beer. Recommended."
"Overall: I really like Pilsner Beers. This isn't quite as good as others I've had, like Urquell, but a nice tasty beer. Only available for a little longer as Spoetzel should have the Shiner 102 out any day. But if I find more, I would buy again."
"One day I'd love to sneak a good Pilsener into an ""American Adjunct"" drinking friend's glass when they ask for a pint fill of fizz...Just to rattle the cage a bit and see what happens...Perhaps I'd use a Shiner 101 for the experiment. Into a brandy glass this reveals a clear and yellow golden color under a blotchy thin head with a good lacing. Aroma is a light but bright one with the classic pilsener malt nose and those sharp metallic and hop notes. A sweet and bright, generously bodied malt feel quenches over the palate with an equally crisp and refreshing finish. It truly is ""simple and refined"" as the brewer states. A simple and refined display of Saaz hops. Prosit!"
"Average Pils."
"D: Easy Drinker. Not quite a Czech Pilsner but a good everyday beer. Beter than most lawnmower or BBQ beers."
"shiner - just got done kicking your ass on another beer - but THIS ONE I LIKE. 101, BOCK and BLACK should be your main focus. this is good like BUD should be - simple beer.. nice and cold. good flavor - tastes like beer. not watery. now stop trickin up your line up and concentrate on getting more hops and flavor into your main stays!"
"Drinkability: Very Drinkable, easy going down and not too bad on the budget."
"The mouthfeel is quite interesting. It's slightly heavier bodied than most pilsners of the type, and it's also very dry. It works though. It's also very drinkable. All in all, I'm glad I took a shot on the Shiner 101. This is the first beer of theirs I've had, and it makes me want to try more. There's nothing wrong with a brewery who focuses on drinkable lagers, in my book."
"D - very drinkable. This beer goes down well and I enjoyed it. I was surprised on how much I liked it. I expected worse."
"Overall, I have had better pils. This one just wasn't too hoppy. Somewhat drinkable, but more flavor would be nice."
"One of Shiner's better brews."
"D/O- Overall, not a bad pilsner...an easy drinker. If I were in the mood for a pils and this was the best beer I could find...well, I certainly have had worse days than that. Thanks Spoetzl."
"Drinkability is there esp cold. I'd like the chance to get six in the summer. A hot day try-out seems in order."
"All in all, though, this makes it easy drinking. Not filling or over powering. Good beer to start the Halloween party night."
"A passable Czech pilsener. Pretty nice."
"Not bad, but definitely falls short of a well made Czech Pilsner. It is refreshing if drunk cold on a hot day though."
"Overall, an average CP that seems to fit the Shiner mold lately of not really pushing it. Obviously available here in TX. Rotation - not really one of my goto styles and it didn't stand out so one is enough for me. [N;N]"
"* Note: when this beer is fresh it is much, much better. I was almost blown-away by the beer upon it's initial release, but over time it has really faded. Think on this when you buy those Pilseners imported from German and Czech Republik!"
"Moderate carbonation and a crisp, full mouthfeel. Good malty backbone with slight caramel sweetness and some mild lemon on the finish. Not overly complex, but drinkable and refreshing."
"A thick head with large bubbles which quickly folds under its own weight. Light and steady carbonation run vertical through the sweet golden pilsner body. Light scent of citrus and barley. Lightly sweet. A clean pils taste with, how to say it?, a bitter crispness to it. Well balanced. Classic. Nicely carbonated, with the bite quickly rolling over the tongue; a little hop bitterness at the end keeps it from being too smooth. An easy drink in this warm weather, but not my preferred thirst quenching beer."
"D - This is a nice attempt at a Czech Pils. Well done by Shiner."
"Summary: This is a good beer. I gave it a 7.7/10, or a C+. This is a very simple anniversary beer. There's no bells and whistles attached and no hidden tastes or smells. It looks like a medium pilsner, and tastes somewhere between a light and medium pilsner. I can't compare with other Czech-style pilsners, because this is the first I've ever had. I would drink this beer again."
"Notes: This is straight up one of the cleanest Czech Pilsners that I have tried. I like to see delicate Pilsners in dark brown bottles!!!"
"4.0 D: It's boring, but well crafted. I'd drink this again without complain, but only if there wasn't anything better."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice fizzy white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose malty, with some hop notes, and caramel. The taste is sweet, malty, slight hop note, and caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, a very tasty brew on a hot night."
"A medium to dark golden color is pored into the glass, with a slightly visible carbonation moving up the glass. A white, creamy half inch head forms and stays there as if saying, ""I am not going anywhere."" A bread fragrance comes in at first scent that is followed by a light grassy fragrance, finishing with a mild cabbage scent. Bread and biscuit dominate the taste right at the beginning, then it blends itself to the hop bitterness. The bitterness brings grassy and mild citrus flavors , that stay on the palate long after each taste is gone. A watery feel at the front with the cleansing sensation of carbonation coming through midway. The finish is dry and the palate is left with a strong, lingering arid feel. A solid Czech style pilsner, with a strong and appealing color. The aroma may not be as spicy as I would have expected, but the solid flavor and classic feel make up fot it in the end."
"If we were rating bottle lable design, this would get an A in my opinion."
"Most of the time I drink Shiner's brews straight from the bottle because IMO the experience between the bottle and glass is the same. However, I prefer this brew be poured in a glass. Pilsners are not usually my pint of brew, but this one was pretty darn good and refreshing - worth a try, and I'll probably have this again while in TX. At $2.50 a pint at Lizardo's, I'm down."
"Mine left some nice lacing behind and had a slight bitterness that was refreshing.I like this one much better than their Shiner Blonde. I wished they would make this one year round."
"D-This tastes like a Miller Lite. Which they may have been going for. I thought I was going to get an American presentation of a Czech Pilsner as described on the label! But this is just American Macro knockoff. Back to the drawing boards with this one."
"The aroma left a good deal to be desired--slight hint of malt but not much more. On every other count it was average--as another reviewer put it, it is a step up from a BMC offering but isn't up to snuff in comparison with other craft-brewed beers of the same style. Needs more malt to give the beer some character."
"Overall, this beer is on the fringe of being the everyday american lager that claims to be a pilsner, though the malts used are better, and there is a tad more hops(just a tad). Would be better if it were more bold. still drinkable, just not true to style."
"I would post more but this post is the same on my Facebook posts so i would not be as accurate as i initially posted my findings."
"Grabbed this one as part of a mixed sixer, probably because I enjoyed the smokehouse I had recently bought. If you compare this one to a BMC product, it is excellent. The light biscuity/hoppy aromas and flavors are far superior to the mass market versions. Compare it to a craft pilsner, and it fails. Whatever. It was only a buck and a half."
"A really nice Pils. Smelled of malts and grass, with a touch of hops. Pale orange colour, white head. The taste was very refreshing, very hoppy with a nice malt background. The only thing I would change would be to add more of a malt character to it. Overall a very nice summer lager."
"Pours a clear, straw/golden color. One inch head of a white color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells of sweet malt, pale malt, hops, and a hint of citrus. Fits the style of a Czech Pilsner. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of pale malt, slight sweet malt, hops, hint of citrus, and a hint of grain. Overall, a good pils; good body, blend, and aroma."
"Poured from 12 ounce bottle into a Unibroue tulip. White head, quickly dissipates, thin to zero lacing. Clear, bright beer, amber in color. Aroma is biscuity and slightly hoppy, slightly malty. Easy to drink, very smooth, easy drinking pilsner. Nice American version of the style."
"had it again about a week later and it was rather more bitter but still crisp. not as rubust of a feel though."
"This is very drinkable beer and capable of quenching a summer thirst."
"For what this beer is, it is very good. The appear is golden yellow with a head that shows up and fades after a while. Smells like grains, maybe light hops. The taste is excellent for what it is, toasty flavor with hops way in the background in the finish. Mouthfeel was clean, light and crisp. Drinkability is top notch. Excellent session beer."
"I think Spoetzl makes some decent lager beers,a bit modest but still pretty good.Poured into a Czech lager glass a lighter golden shade with a nice fluffy white head atop.Aromas were mainly mineral-like with a bit of toasty grain,flavors are light and crisp with some of that iron/mineral,a bit of sweetness,and a decent shot of spicy saaz in the finish.Its a good drinker and better than basic,great to drink while grillin out on a hot North Carolia day like today."
"Poured a clear golden yellow with a nice two fingered head leaving a nice lacing throughout the glass. Aromas of light grains and malts. Light on the palate with nice carbonation. Hints of a hoppy citrus finish. Good enough of a brew from the Lone Star State. Found it drinkable."
"Overall a pretty darn near perfect feeling and looking Czech Pils. I was hoping for a little more malt presence, but the hops seemed to be on par with the malt element. I paid $1.79 for a single from a store that really doesn't mark-up their singles at all. So, by my math this must be going for around $11 a sixer? If this is so, it's too much coin IMHO. I'd stock up on it if it were closer to $7.49 or something. Good pils nonetheless."
"This was an easy drinker and one I could have had the entire evening. Well done!"
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid milder beer that is worth pounding down for a long time."
"D: Nice little Pils, low in ABV, very drinkable... Not a bad little session beer."
"This pilsner comes out of the tap a clear, appetizing amber with a decent white head. Aroma is strong, fruity, yeasty and slightly malty. Fruity and somewhat malty flavor is rather pleasing, if not outstanding. Texture is very smooth and slightly fizzy."
"Congratulations to Shiner for 101 years of brewing... and counting. Czech-Style Pilsner isn't as good as Commemorator Doppelbock or Smokehaus, but it's one of their better efforts for sure. Bottom line: fire up the lawnmower."
"D - Good tasting brew, but I couldn't see buying a six pack."
"Pretty bland overall. For a light lager, not the worst thing ever. Though long gone are the days when Spoetzl actually put out a good flavorful lager to drink."
" ~ This is one of those beers that many around my neck of the woods will simply overlook as ""ordinary"". This is a beer that has some complex characteristics even though its ""only "" a pilsner. If you can find this brew, I suggest you take a gulp or two. It's worth a sampling."
"Poured into a pint glass I was looking forward to enjoying a great tasting Czech brew taking me back to my travels there where I learned that beer was more important than, well most things. The color was a nice straw yellow with a 1 finger white head that dissipated to nothing. There was a faint malt nose, but some bready yeast and light floral hops. The taste was clean and simple with nice barley and hop balance. Not a WOW brew though. Just plain and simple and maybe that is all they were going for. If so this one gets it, but I was expecting more from the style and in that it fell a bit short."
"D: Easy drinkable. Light, refreshing and goes down smooth."
"D- Easy to drink and very refreshing, quite a good summer drink"
"Pours a medium gold, with a significant head that slowly dissipates leaving a moderate foam layer. Not much lacing to speak of here. Smell features a pleasant, but understated hops character, as well as significant graininess. Taste is good, but there could be a bit more hops presence, as well as a bit more carbonation. Fairly decent mouthfeel, but again, there could be a bit more carbonation. A decent rendition of the style."
"Drinkability: Having lived in Slovakia for three months, I had many Czech pilsners. This is a faithful interpretation and a refreshing yet tasty summer beer."
"While this beer is pretty nice, it's probably just as well it isn't available in this market. It's a solid effort, but IMHO, it just doesn't compare to the excellent pilsners one can find from Victory, slyfox, troegs and stoudt in this part of the world."
"Overall, a nice pilsener, which can be a difficult style to do well. Saaz hops definitely help this one with overall flavor."
"Poured into a pilsner glass; it has a light golden copper color and is crystal clear. It has lots of carbonation that's flows to a semi thick (about one and a half fingers) white bubbly head that stuck around for a while. There is some good lacing in this beer! It has a good malt aroma mixed in with some wheat and other grains. It's light on the tongue, crisp and clean. I can taste some malt flavors some mild hops (very mild hops) and a slight bitter aftertaste. The hops flavor stands out a little more after it warms up a bit. Overall not a bad beer, and I'll be buying another pack sometime soon."
"Atmosphere is really solid. Great appearance, and a really nice combination of grain and spice in the nose. The flavor is an outstanding balance of components, all pure and pristine, with nothing really standing out of the others. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"Drinkability: this is a decent beer, not my favorite beer of this style, I would prefer more saaz flavor. I wonder if Texas water is too hard for a Pilz as well? Maybe that has something to do with the taste? I probably wouldn't get again."
"It's good but nothing special. Probably the best Shiner beer I've had."
"Overall, this is by no means the best from Spoetzl. I have had almost all Shiner beer available in Ohio, and I am a pretty big fan, but this one was a let down. The other thing that I can't help but get past, is that I think I am underrating this a bit because I had a Sam Adams Noble Pils the other week, and that was just by far my favorite Sam Adams and I am using that, unfortunately, as a basis for comparison on other Pilsners... I have a few more left in my 6-pack which I AM looking forward to drinking, but it may be awhile until I come back to Shiner for a Pils"
"Opinion: Well, overall I think that this is a pretty decent beer. It is a little closer to a Helles in style than a Pilsner from the overall balance, which I like but is going to cost it some points. I definitely don't get the Saaz up-side the head like some Czech style lagers are. I only have a single of this beer, but I wouldn't mind drinking more so I may pick some more up here pretty soon if the price is right. Either way, I would recommend giving this beer a shot. It is clean and well brewed."
"Poured into a pint glass, formed a 1/2"" white head above the clear golden brew. Head falls at reasonable pace, with average lacing. Aroma is balanced between sweet pale malt and earthy Saaz. Taste follows the nose, with a crsip close. Mouthfeel is quite smooth, and drinkability is very easy. Good stuff."
"D -- Very good drinkability. The flavors reflect a well-made brew, just not quite to style for what the label is advertising."
"Cheers."
"D: I didn't find anything all that special about this. Still, it's fairly well done and a fine session brew."
"D - Excellent. Very thirst quenching. Overall dry, crisp, and pleasant."
"Drinkability: Sufficiently sessionable, I suppose, but, for me, it just lacks that Saaz hop bite I'm looking for. On a side note, I'll say it is nice to see Shiner continuing the series beyond the Shiner 100 Commemorator."
"Finally. The search for a great session beer yields a good one. Too bad it's a seasonal. In fact, too bad it's a one-time brew. Gorgeous orange to pale amber in the glass with nice tan head that stayed briefly then laced the upper part of the pub glass. Fruity, somewhat light floral hops with an undercurrent of biscuity malt in the nose. Coupled with the surprisingly moderate mouthfeel and subtle carbonation, the nicely balanced flavor was incredibly satisfying and drinkable. Amazing beer. Nothing too complex, of course; but you could knock a few of these back and never get tired of it."
"Mouthfeel was medium in body with adequate carbonation."
"Not the best Pils out there, but engaging enough to drink 3 or 4 watching the game or hanging out at the lake. Not a huge Shiner fan, but they did a pretty good job on this one"
"non of these pils/lager types from Shiner are worth buying. all share the same characteristic crappy watered down soul and extreme boring nature. avoid."
"D- Not very interesting and pretty carbonated makes this not super drinkable and rather forgettable."
"Overall impression: Is this the most exciting beer out there? Not by a long shot. But it is a solid offering, highly drinkable with some nice pilsner flavors."
"Notes - This is probably the best Czech-style Pils I've had, though I admit my experience with the style is limited. I'm guessing it's because it's much fresher than the real Czech stuff we get over here. In particular, I like how the bready aftertaste balances the sharp hops so well."
"D - Smooth. Although it reminds me of the Frost and of the Kosch-style. Nothing spectacularly new here."
"D: Very drinkable beer. You can drink a ton of this on a hot summer day. I wasn't expecting much, but was pleasently surprised with this. With all the specialty and extreme beers on the market, I think it's rather refreshing that shiner has put out a well crafted pilsner."
"+ yea, it's another safe beer from Shiner. but as far as pilsners go, i can enjoy this one. this is what my craft fence sitting friends drink, and i've been having it a lot lately."
"D - Easy drinking. Seems lightly filling at times. No idea on the ABV, but as a pils it can't beat me up too bad."
"This one is an easy drinker and does a fine job of representing this style. Not as hoppy as the Lagunita's Pils and lacking the brightness and the buttery feel of the Urquell but holds its own and is supremely drinkable."
"RJT"
"D - Overall this is a pretty good beer not a style that I seek out but it has a decent taste thats light and refreshing worth trying sometime"
"Verdict: 101 is another pleasant, very Shiner-esque, though ultimately unmemorable pale lager from Shiner. 97 was so good that it's a shame to see yet another lackluster beer in this series. Guys, do us all a favor and be a little more daring next year--it paid off the last time."
"D - Yet another mediocre beer from the Spoetzl Brewery. It's okay, but I won't be seeking it out again."
"Taste is light malts with a touch more sweetness than I am used to in a Czech style pilsner. Hops are more detectable in the taste than the nose indicated, but still pretty lightly hopped. There is a light lagery sulfur flavor in there as well. While Shiner 101 is pretty true to style, it is a pretty uninspiring version. Yes, it is crisp and refreshing but it is not the cleanest pilsner and the flavors are slightly dull."
"Thanks Shiner."
"Shiner 101 exhibits a clear golden body with stark white foam, clean sweet pilsener malt, and an herbal, grassy, noble hop presence. All requisites for the style, the only problem is that each component lacks just a bit compared to the standards of the style. The head recedes quickly, the malt becomes a bit watery at the end, and the hops don't pop nearly enough, especially in the aroma. That said, 101 is still a pleasant beer to drink, and one that I would gladly consume again, especially on a warm afternoon."
"Can't wait to make a session of this once the thermometer warms up here in Houston. As another poster stated. This beer should replace the subpar hefeweizen as a year round brew."
"This is a Shiner beer I'd drink over and over again in the warmer months. I'd love for this to become a year-round beer (in place of the Hefe, if I had my way!)"
"This is very sessionable given that this is probably low in abv. But I won't go for this again. Glad I tried it though."
"D: Quite drinkable although I still prefer the Frost overall in comparing recent Shiner offerings. This brew was about what I would expect from a Shiner pilsener in that it is a little conservative."
"Minerals and grain husks hit the palate first, tasting slightly of sulfur and light Pilsner malt. The hops add a decent enough balance with notes of herbal grasses and a touch of bitter pine. Taste improves as the tongue adjusts to the carbonation level, as the light body goes down smooth but never suggests itself to be 'watery'. All in all, I found Shiner 101 to be a pretty decent Czech Pilsner. Nothing great, but, if anything--these guys are consistent. Happy One-hundred-and-first, Spoetzl."
"Shiner 101, is very straight forward, no frills type of beer. It's a great choice for just casual drinking, and would pair nicely with barbeque. While, not deviated far from your typical macro lager - it deviates with much more mouthfeel, which provides a nice creaminess. A bit, more flavor, and good drinkability."
"Pours golden yellow with a white head. The beer is very clear. The aroma is wheat, malt and some grassy hops. I also get a slight butteryness. The flavor is similar with a nice touch of bitterness from the grassy hops. The butter is there as well, taking away from the overall flavor. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation. An unremarkable beer, but one of the better ones from Shiner."
"Just picked this up at the local HEB plus off Anderson Mill. Pours with a golden color with a fluffy head. Completely transparent in body. Smells like every czech pilsner I have had, reminds me exactly of Pilsner Urquell. I enjoy the bitterness czech pilsners usually have. This beer was no different, and even had less of a bite than I thought it would. This was smooth from start to finish, I definitely enjoyed this beer."
