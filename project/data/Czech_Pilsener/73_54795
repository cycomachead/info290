Fits the style of a Czech Pilsner.  Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level.  Tastes of strong pale malt, sweet malt, hops, and slight yeast.

Not as mellow as a German pils, but in general a nice interpretation of the style and a very drinkable hoppy lager","Slatetank","Aug 27, 2014"

3.99,6.1,3.75,4,4,4,4,"This pours out a very light straw-gold color with an initial half-inch head. Nice flowery hop aroma, quite big. Definitely on the hoppy end of the style, the taste greets you with a high bitterness, and lots of noble hop flavor. Really, this feels more like a German than Czech pils. Malt is light, as is the body, with a very dry finish. This is a good quaffing pils. Very nice.","allengarvin","0"

Sweet bready malt and floral hop aromas with earthy grass, lemon zest and toasted malt notes. Medium bodied with assertive, tangy, crisp carbonation and a clean semi-dry finish. Bready, biscuity malt flavors up front followed by tangy, herbal hops through the middle.

The aroma is a light, but pleasant, offering some floral hops and a light biscuit note. The taste is good, but seems stuck deciding between going with a more noble-hop forward approach or a more bready malty path. It doesn't taste bad, but it's missing some of the depth either one of those aspects offers. It has a nice thinner weight to the body and a pleasant dry finish. It is a very good pilsner.","delta490","Jul 01, 2014"

Mouthfeel was not just soft, but also viscous and it sat on my tongue like a dollop of Saaz hops pudding. More please, Mom-Za! It tasted like somebody just emptied the lawnmower bag into the kettle and walked away. I am a huge fan of Czech-style pilsners, especially in comparison to their German-style counterparts and this was one of the best yet.

It seems to have weathered the past several months in storage and the trip back to New Mexico quite well as this is one of the better pilsners I've had. Although a little lacking in appearance, this beer pairs reasonably complex flavors with with a high level of drinkability. Although a bit steeply priced at $8.50 a six in Ohio, I could see myself getting this again.","Bockrules","Apr 09, 2013"

A generous white head was a sign of powerful carbonation, which was definitely evident in the mouthfeel. A grassy aroma was present, as expected for a pilsner. In the initial taste, one gets grass, sour hay, and a mildly tart grain taste. The mild sourness continues into the aftertaste, which moves in quickly because of the carbonation. I normally skip pilsners, and now I remember why. This is a pilsner, so it is Great Lakes' attempt at a beer for non-craft drinkers. For craft beer drinkers, it tastes a little more like a high end macro-brew.","JohnnyHopps","Jan 17, 2013"

Taste is off the charts with bold pilsner vibes, noble hops, some grass, slight florals and some pale malt in the end keeping things in check.

There are no distinguishable fruit/pine notes to the beer's hops, relatively nondistinct. With a vigorous swirl there is a slight cheesy butteriness and tomato that competes with the malt's sweetness. The taste is all pilsner with a crisp, light hoppiness followed by a semi-dry, lingering sweetness. Flavorful and drinkable summer beer, but the mouthfeel is a little off.

Head retention is good, and there's a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is grainy malt, along with some grassy and spicy hops. Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's also some slight floral hops noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's crisp and refreshing and very easy to drink.

The yeast profile is decidedly Czech, being more buttery and creamy than sulfuric. Palate is very nice, with floral and grassy hop flavors up front, followed by doughy, creamy, soft pils malt flavors. DMS and diacetyl are present at a low level, signature of Czech pilsner, giving the beer a softer character than the German counterpart. Finishes mildly bittersweet.

This beer had really good drinkability, it was very smooth and clean, I could drink a few of these on a nice summer day while grilling outside. What I liked most about this beer was the mouthfeel and the crisp and clean flavors, this beer also looked pretty good. What I liked least about this beer was the lack of hops, I was expecting a little more hop flavors and I think the finish should have an assertive bitterness. I would buy this beer again when looking for a clean and easy drinking Pilsener, but It's not my favorite in style, I do recommend giving this beer a try, especially if you don't want a lot of bitterness.

Very good and refreshing overall for a pils.","kbutler1","Jul 20, 2010"
2.84,-24.5,4.5,3,2.5,4.5,2,"Drinkability was low. Sure the light character of the beer and low abv make it an easy drinker, but, the flavor wound up being way too off-putting. My wife who ordered it didn't want to finish it and we had the bar tender exchange it for an Edmund Fitzgerald. Sorry Wright Pils, but you didn't make the cut.","Spider889","Jul 16, 2010"
3.5,-6.9,3,3,3.5,4,4,"Notes: A special treat to have this "giftshop exclusive" in bottles from Great Lakes. It was available on tap inside the brewery as well but I did not get the chance to enjoy it there. This is a solid American craft pilsener.","adamette","Jun 24, 2010"
4.27,13.6,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"D: A very pleasant, easy drinking pilsner from Great Lakes. It was certainly refreshing on a hot afternoon, and this is a welcome summer seasonal in my book.","Clydesdale","Jun 23, 2010"
4.42,17.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"If Great Lakes is looking for a new summer seasonal, they need look no further than The Wright Pils. This should be the blueprint for any U.S. craft brewer who wants to compete with the best that Germany and The Czech Republic have to offer. Thanks to my brother for giving up his only bottle so that I could do a review.","BuckeyeNation","Jun 21, 2010"
4.26,13.3,4,3,4.5,5,5,"Exceptional drinkability. Very, very tasty while still being light, crisp and refreshing. Can I have another?","kels","Jun 20, 2010"
4.12,9.6,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Overall, a very solid pils. One of the better pils I have had. Very drinkable and well to the style.","mothman","Jun 09, 2010"
4.32,14.9,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D: Drinks very easily and is pretty interesting for a pilsner.","pwoods","May 10, 2010"
3.97,5.6,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a straw-yellow with small, tight white head and very little lacing. Smells of grassy hops and almost like whole wheat bread. Lots of bready flavour to go with the grassy hop bitterness. Nice mouthfeel and a great drinker. Doesn't seem to be a lot going on with this, but it is a very well made pilsner. If this was available near me, I may buy it more.","kwjd","Mar 22, 2010"
3.91,4,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Thin beer with a slight aftertaste. Mild sweetness up front and not a lot of carbonation in the mouth. Overall I think its OK but not great. Second taste, quite drinkable. Some mild bitterness at the back but the aftertaste it gone. Again, a mild sweetness and a nice finish. I rather like this beer.","drabmuh","Mar 20, 2010"
3.85,2.4,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"For a regular pilsner, you aren't going to find many beers better than this. It has all the characteristics of a great pilsner plus some malt happiness thrown in there for good measure. However, it is a pilsner- and pilsners are middle of the road and made for your average beer drinker. The craft spirit is alive in The Wright Pils so let's hope this keeps them on the wright track. How about Imperial Black and Wright Pilsner? Just a suggestion....","mdotgunter","Beers"

4.1,9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Had this on-tap at the GLBC brewpub. Menu said it was 5.1% ABV. Served in a pint glass. Appearance is pale yellow, with a thin white head. Very good retention. Overall, very floral nose, with a little spike of hops. Great balanced flavor: honey sweet plus sweet and citrusy hops. VERY drinkable beer. Could easily down 2-3 of these in the spring or summer.","ndekke39","Mar 07, 2010"
3.9,3.7,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Drinkability - delicious and easily sessionable, though I will understand if those at the GL pub move on to other offerings after this. Much thanks is in order to Greg who brought me a sixer of these. He's not a BA (not even a beer drinker), but has the spirit of one and was nice enough to hook me up with these, and wouldn't even let me pay him! I should have asked for a growler of Rackhouse, huh? ;-)","brewdlyhooked13","Feb 14, 2010"
3.6,-4.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Overall, I can't say that a whole lot was going on with this beer but it was a pretty good representation for the style. If this is your type of beer I could easily see this being sessionable.","boatshoes","Feb 09, 2010"
3.95,5.1,4,4,4,3.5,4,"A bit full for the style, with lower carbonation. Pretty easy to drink. Enjoyable.","Bierguy5","Jan 28, 2010"
4.42,17.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Crisp Golden pilsner with a nice bouquet of Czech hop aroma. 5.1% ABV, 40 IBU. Crystal clear golden color, standard pilsner appearance. The aroma is very well crafted and hoppy, spicy saaz. Same with the taste, grassy style hops, a little hops bitterness in the aftertaste, excellent as a summer beer. Not sure why the six packs are a pub exclusive. I'd guess it would sell well in distribution.","TurdFurgison","Jan 01, 2010"

4.16,10.6,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,5,"Overall, I won't lie, pilseners aren't my favorite and I have had a lot of shitty ones. This one was done very well and had a lot of flavor...definitely unexpected. Another great beer from GLBC.","rhinos00","0"
