3.45,-5,3.75,3.75,3.25,3.25,3.5,"This one has grown on me. It is a typical Czech pilsner, I think the first bomber I got to this had been left too long somewhere, either on my own neglect or the store I purchased it. It pours a nice straightforward pilsner. The color is golden straw with a good bit of carbonation, which for this style is perfectly normal and something I look for. The smell is where it is truly at its best. It s great smelling beer, full of grainy aroma and character. The taste still doesn't fully do it for me. It is bitter and not necessarily in a good way. I expect the bitterness in an IPA and some ales, but this one should be more on the malt side of things. When I think of a pilsner I think of a beer that is highly sessionable, but I wouldn't do that with this one. Overall I do like it, but would choose another one to drink a few of. Overall, I do like this beer and think that it is fairly representative of the style. I would like for it to be a little less of that hairspray bitterness and more of the grainy goodness that comes through in the aroma.","humuloner22","Feb 01, 2014"
3.56,-1.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,"Poured on-tap and served in a shaker pint, the beer is a crystal clear, pale, honey-gold coloring with little to no head. Nose of floral hops highlight a subtle roast and bitterness throughout. Flavors are floral and peppery forward, with a heavy roast and bitter hops character at the end. Some richly sweet notes of honey ribbon throughout the palate, also. Smooth bodied, with a very clean aftertaste. The finish is very crisp and clean. An interesting twist on the pilsner, and tasty.","GarthDanielson","Jan 27, 2014"

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, and slight bitter hops. The flavor was of bitter malt, wheat, skunk, slight bitter hops, and subtle banana on the followthrough. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. The skunk aspect was a little surprising, but didn't kill the brew at all. All of the flavors worked really well together on this one, but it just wasn't awe-inspiring. Aroma was a little weak in intensity for my liking, but still decent.

The individual parts of the beer all are fine, but seem to add up to less than the sum, making the beer less smooth and drinkable than it should be.","WFU03","Oct 17, 2007"
4.13,13.8,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"The beer poured into the glass with a nice darker golden body underneath a white head that holds a nice film and laces well down the glass. The smell is spicy czech hops and sweet pilsner malt. The taste is also very hop forward balanced by the malts with a nice bitter profile. The mouthfeel is great for the style. Enough body but still light for drinkability. Overall, a very drinkable pilsner. Not a german style as listed on this site, but a nice czech style one.","MSchae1017","Jul 12, 2007"
3.44,-5.2,3.25,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"While its forgivable butter character provides a charming sense of fullness, the beer doesn't let that interfere with its refreshing and hop-forward finish. With elements of mint, leaf and stem stewing late, an aftertaste of honeysuckle reward the senses one last time.","BEERchitect","Apr 15, 2007"
4.02,10.7,3,3.5,4.5,4,4," Overall this was a really good pilsner, and totally away from what I was expecting. It was light enough to drink on a hot day or in large numbers, but at the same time had enough character, enough profile to carry its own weight even at night. This was a superb choice at the time, and a really good brew. I would definatly order this up again!","mikesgroove","Dec 13, 2006"

4,10.2,4,4,4,4,4,"6-4-08: snappy, crisp hop presence with clean pilsner malts, apparently much improved over my previously reviewed version, near the top of the NC pilsner heap","blackie","Jul 03, 2006"
3.42,-5.8,3.5,4,3,3.5,3.5,"Flavor was full of husks and grain flavors. Kind of like digging my teeth into an seven-grain bread that was flavored with alcohol. Slight hop bite that was more citrus than pine. Medium body. Perhaps a tad too much hops kind of threw this beer out of balance.","MuddyFeet","Feb 02, 2006"
3.08,-15.2,3,2.5,3,3,4,"This beer was a good lighter beer. The smell was macro like and the taste was too. But ice cold this sure hits the spot on a hot afternoon. I could drink this beer again. Average for the style. This could be a session beer with ease. I wish I had one right now.","Enola","Oct 20, 2005"
4.34,19.6,3.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Body is a hair below medium. with a very brisk and crisp mouthfeel, with some light minerality in the finish.","AlexJ","Jun 09, 2005"
3.25,-10.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,3,"The body is light which is good per style. There is a good backing but some lighter sense almost gives it a watered down taste. Truthfully I didnt notice but it was by other in my party. So overall it was a good American pilsner.","Oxymoron","Beers"
3.85,6.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured a little deeper golden color than alot of pilsners with a fluffy white head that took awhile to come down,aromas of lightly toasted grain and corn husk and very fresh.Nice and well rounded pils here a firm dry malt base holds up very nice to a lip smacking dry herbal hoppy finish very clean in the finish.A nice sturdy pilsner that is very food freindly to boot,I really enjoyed this one.","oberon","0"
