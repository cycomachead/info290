3.75,4.7,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a brilliant gold hue with a slight chill haze casted over, poured this one into my vintage Miller High life flute pils glass. Bright white cloudy head forms thick and leaves nice even scattered lacing. Aroma has a nice pale malt biscuit sweetness with clashing green/grassy herbal hops. I'm guessing Saaz here with an underlying nice fruitiness. A nice brisk bitterness from the fresh herbal noble hop profile, you really can't beat a nice Czech style pils a bit of caramelized sugar from the light toasted pilsener malts, not the most interesting beer but a satisfying one. This is probably consumed in massive quantities closer to where it's brewed at almost 3 dollars for one 11.2 oz bottle, I wound be having that same experience. Crisp dry herbal hop finish, with a nice rounded malt body. Again super refreshing with sturdy carbonation really drinks great, I wish I had a couple more bottles.","WVbeergeek","Oct 22, 2011"

It’s also Friday so people tend to get off work a bit earlier and wind down in time for the weekend. My family, a couple of friends and myself decided to meet up at Babylon Bar in the center of town. The bar’s owned by a family that operate a few Czech influenced restaurants and bars so naturally I felt inclined to order something Czech off the beer menu. Sitting in the sun in the outdoor section of the place I really wanted something mellow and easy and the pils was therefore the perfect match. A traditional and well crafted old-world pilsner from the heart of the Czech republic. Na zdraví!","TobiasGoth","Sep 05, 2011"

Aroma very typical for true euro pils... like standing outside a large brewery on a windy spring day after the rain. Flavor pretty complex for a pils, a little citrusy buckling under the weight of stern hops fading to the normal pleasant euro skunkiness.

3.53,-1.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A malty, metallic Bohemian pilsener, pouring a slightly tarnished brassy color with decent head, leaving stagnant pools of foam and minimal lacing. Strong malty aroma with elements of bread crust, cracker, and vague boiled vegetables. The beer goes down quite easily, with a generous sweetness from the malts balanced by typical pilsner hoppage: heavily herbal, a bit of grass, and maybe even a twinge of black licorice. A large gulp reveals a sharpness and slight sourness that is most likely the result of time and travel. Hops taste slightly stale but I am inclined to hold that against the importer, distributor, and vendor, rather than the brewery. Easily avoided by taking smaller sips and revelling in the malty qualities up front. Mouthfeel thin and refreshing; drinkability decent if not through the roof.","Thrasher","Jul 27, 2004"
3.24,-9.5,3,4,3,3,3,"A clear brew, pale straw in color with a yeasty, lagerish aroma and a scant white head. Delivers the goods but not in great quantity. The flavor is dry and reserved, the body is thin, the mouthfeel ordinary. A trickle of carbonation rises upwards and some yeast sediment sits below. This is a pleasant drinking beer but very modest in scope. Don't go out of your way for it.","RedDiamond","Mar 05, 2004"

Nose is thee quintessential lager nose, malt that is somewhat sweet, citrus crisp and clean, the prototypical lager start that is nicely malted and lightly sweet, top is fair to middling in feel. Finish is almost astringent in its carbonation with the hops apropos to the style and the aftertaste dry and lingering, in all honesty one of the better lagers I have sampled.","Gusler","Jan 08, 2004"
3.42,-4.5,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours clear gold under a one finger white head with some body but not much staying power. The nose features mild flowery hops. The mouth is crisp, light and prickly. The taste is almost all hops, a bit harsh, a bit metallic (thanks to the sugar, I suspect) and a bit flowery underneath it all. There's also some spiciness here somewhere, reminiscent of coriander. A very good bitter bite emerges in the aftertaste. OK, but a bit disappointing.","Globetrotter","Dec 23, 2003"

This is obviously not a Czech style pils, it is very malty, much more than is typical for the style. Initial sweetness leads to a toasty middle and a fairly understated aftertaste with hints of toffee.

The aroma is slightly bready, with pepper and lemon notes, and a malt character to it as well. The taste is rather sweet, with notes of lemon and pepper, almost to a point of sourness. Very unique. The finish is fairly crisp, with the citric tartness lingering behind. The mouthfeel is very full and satisfying, and supports the sweetness of the beer well. The drinkability suffers a little from the sweetness, a little from the tartness. This beer almost seems like a cross between a dortmunder lager and a weizen of some sort. While cetainly not one of my favorites, I'm glad I experienced this beer.","aaronh","Jan 02, 2003"
2.96,-17.3,4,3,2.5,3,3.5,"This brew pours a beautiful golden copper color with a thick and creamy white head that dissipates too quickly but leaves a nice lace.  Sweet maltiness dominates the aroma with a slightly husky grain aroma and very faint hops in the background.  The taste starts off with some sweet maltiness before the brief burst of hops in the middle.  The hops are then beaten out again by the malt for the finish of the brew.  There is a lingering sweet maltiness, almost sticky, along with a strange metallic flavor, almost like I was drinking this out of a can.  The brew has a decent body to it but the sticky sweet taste that is left in your mouth drops it down some as well as bringing the drinkability down some.  There is just too much overly sweet malt in this beer and not enough hops to balance it out.","Murph","Sep 22, 2002"
2.57,-28.2,4.5,2.5,2.5,3,2,"Clear golden hue w/ profuse threads of bubbles supporting the persistant and thick head.  Dense and ornate lace is left. Sweet, grainy malt in aroma, w/ a trace of cooked cabbage.  The overall flavor profile is quite sweet, due to the meager hop bitterness.  The malt character lacks depth, and consists ofresidual sweetness and light breadiness, but not much else is there.  A mildly grassy hop flavor eeks in, but is lost amongst the malt sweetness.  Although moderately bodied and smooth in mouthfeel, the sweetness and lack of balance hurts the drinkability.  Finishes expectedly sweet.  Primator lacks the refined balance of a good Vienna.  It falls short of its attractive appearance.","marc77","Aug 25, 2002"

3.76,5,4,3,4,4,4,"Amber/caramel color with a nice, chunky head.  One of the most malty lagers I've come across.  Solid mouthfeel full of moderately sweet caramel/toffee malt.  Hops held back, but gave enough show to throw a little balance in, although the overall effect was unbalanced toward the malt side.  Nontheless, quite a smooth and easy-drinking beverage. Interesting to find a beer with a name ending in "-ator" that isn't a dupplebock.","Brent","Nov 16, 2001"
