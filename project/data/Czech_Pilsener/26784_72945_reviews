"Lagers are usually more mundane than this one. Like the mild bitterness at the finish."
""
"Sweet with a berry like presence. Again, pretty low hop which leads to a shorter aftertaste. The body is quite good although the carbonation is elevated. I'd say this falls short of the Czech pils goal."

"This is one of the first breweries I tried in the Atlanta area so I'm particularly loyal to this place. That being said, Long Day has been one of my favorite beers. It goes down easy and tastes great. Def better on tap but most beers are for that matter."

"Could certainly kill a six pack of these and be more than merry :)"

"2.88/5.00"
"I keep underestimating golden/pale lagers of various styles and keep being wrong. This was such an unexpected taste, and a good one. You go into it thinking pilsner, and expecting the tastes of Czech and Germany, but at the first sip you're getting American hops like in a pale ale. It's a real curveball. It was full flavored and delicious and made me want to keep taking another sip."
"Taste like there is some rancid bactericide that has been brewing in this can. Quite a disappointment to my dismay, compared to the overall positive reviews of this pilsner. Has a light mouth feel, a sour malty sweetness. I am just thankful this was given to me for free."

"O - sessionable beer that is very tasty but very easy to drink."

" Everything about this brew is subtle, gentle, smooth and refreshing. A great thirst quenching beer to have on one of those typically steaming hot, triple shower, sweaty ass Atlanta Georgia days that invoke wild fantasy's about moving to Reykjavik or some such place."
"I had two at the pool on a 90 degree day."

"O: one of a few Georgia brewed craft lagers, fairly average for the style"

"I heard that Red Hare micro brewery is going to sell their Gangway IPA in cans pretty soon as well."

"Overall this is a very good lager. Refreshing and easy to drink. As the first local beer in cans this one will be in my fridge for the rest of the summer."
""
""
"O - As the can says, it is very refreshing after a long day in the sun in the summer time. Excellent beer to take a 6 pack or 2 with you up to the lake on a hot summer day. Also great to find a local brewery getting into the canning movement..."

"Had this on draft quite a few times but never reviewed it... Was released in cans yesterday and I got one of the first 6 packs only 2 place in GA got it in yesterday :) Pours a clear golden color, foamy white head. Doesn't stick around a long time but what do you expect from a lager? Taste is slightly sweet, biscuit, some hop bitterness on the back of the tongue... could easily drink all I have in the fridge tonight if I didn't work tomorrow lol Just a great beer from a brewery right down the street from me. Overall great beer and if you live in the Marietta, GA area be sure to stop by for a tour there over the weekend."

"Bought a growler at Whole Foods recently. Hazy gold appearance with a decent but not over the top head. Good and fresh flavor. A step above the mass produced adjunct lagers for sure. Not in the top tier but a very drinkable lager for a hot day in Georgia. This Marietta brewery seems to know their climate, customers, and beer."

""
"Nice clean lager, real nice hoppiness. Aroma is average but the flavor is excellent for this style."

"Good first impression from Red Hare in Marietta; I was hoping to give their IPA a try, but they ran out at AY before I got there. A nice autumn lager with plenty of character. If you're introducing your BMC buds to craft beer, this would be a great way to bring them over to the dark side..."
"Comes out of the tap a hazy honey golden with a thin off-white head - but the latter may be an artifact of the pour. The bartenders at Summits like to make sure you get maximum beer. It is darker than most lagers I have sampled, a good sign. As it turns out, the head does leave some decent lacing. Malty, fruity aroma has apple and cherry notes and a hint of hops, unusual for a lager in my experience. Malty and surprisingly hoppy flavor has a fruity tone and subtle hop bitterness. Smooth, firm-bodied, fizzy, edgy texture leaves a malty and rather hoppy finish, somewhat more like an IPA than a lager. Iâ€™ve had plenty of lagers, and this is one of the best, if not the best!"
"Overall: This lager carries across more bitterness than, for me, is desired and has a conspicuous raw graininess throughout, leaving me without the crisp, refreshing, inviting lager I'm looking forward to after a long day."
