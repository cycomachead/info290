"Pilsner is my favourite kind of beer. But I also like heavier north American lagers, (like Creemore!) This is a pilsner from that perspective, and it's good! It has a good pilsner bite, but full of flavour. This is one of my favourite beers, anywhere."
"Poured from can. Cereal and hay aroma. Clear and golden with white head. Very light bitter taste. Light body, thin texture, lively carbonation, with an abrupt finish. Pretty average overall."

"Pours a brilliantly clear deep golden color with a good sized bubbly white head that lasts forever. Sweet grainy bready pilsner and faint spicy floral hops. Flavor follows the aroma quite well. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation. A bit sweet but easy enough to drink, I enjoyed this."

"Mouthfeel - Clean and crisp and exceptionally dry finish. Lot's of carbonation and light body."

"Overall - a well crafted Czech Pilsner that is worth repeating and stacks up well against some of the German and Czech representations of the style."

"O-not a bad brew, would have expected a bit more hops but still very clean and crisp"

"I like this. it's got more charecter than alot of pilsners that attempt to match the style, it has one factor that i really like..the fact that it isnt over foamy..some pilsner goes a bit overboard on the head..but this is subtle.its like a softer version of stiegl. but retaining all of it's best charectaristics.if available i'd say dont pass this one up if you are a fan of the style. and based on my other reviews its probably obvious im a pilsner jock. and this makes the grade..there are others who i prefer over it..but its definatly great. try one today. matches great with spicey foods."

"Thinking how much I liked the lager and the keller bier, I expected a little more out of the pils mostly more hops and a bigger flavour profile. Not a bad beer but nothing to make me put my can of Konig or Bitburger down. Still nice to find in a great new mixed pack."
""
"Light body, great carbonation, very refreshing."

"O - I'm glad that Creemore still brew beer their own way, even after they were bought out by Molson Coors. Creemore's Pilsner is a very close match to the authentic Czech pilsners and is leagues ahead of the macro lagers of the parent company. Without doubt, this is one of the best Canadian pilsners I've ever had."
""
""
"Overall: A very refreshing pils that has a bit of snap"
""
"Pale blonde colour, ring of white head, no lace to speak of really. Smell is malty, biscuit like with some of that Creemore yeastiness, fairly earthy notes that give way into some grassy and floral hops, quite clean overall. Taste is malty with a light graham cracker sweetness, earthy and dry hops, floral with a light but assertive bitterness with a yeastiness in the finish and aftertaste. Medium prickly carbonation, smooth creamy feel, medium body and like most Creemore beers has a good mouthfeel. Not bad but not the best for the style, could have another of these down the road."

"Creemore Springs Pilsner pours out of the can a dull golden color with some yellow shade towards the side. A inch of loose ecru colored foam came and went leaving nothing. Smell is pale pilsner malts, alot of them. Sweet smelling after some whiffs. Any hops have faded by now. Semi scent of extract. Taste is extract, corn, pale malt and sweet. Earthy hop taste that is old. Feel is a bit lackluster, I was expecting more carb from the can. Light bodied, yet not crisp enough to go down easily. I had one and now I am done."
"Overall- A nice refreshing pilsner from Creemore Springs. The mildness of the hops contributes to its easy drinkability."
""
"Pours a crystal clear golden yellow with a pretty white head that fades to a think film; some remnants of head. Nose is grassy and mildly floral. Some grainy bread, general sweetness and vague characteristics that remind me of their Kellerbier. Taste is sweet and grainy, some corn bread with some light hopping. Somewhat sweet finish. Light bitterness that remains for a short while. Carbonation is a tad low, with a bit of crispiness that I think could have been more pronounced with a better carbonation level. Medium body however. Certainly not difficult to finish by any stretch, but not something I'd actively seek out. Decent nonetheless."

"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavours and aromas. Great for a warm sunny day."
"really fresh tasting. a good summer refresher."
"O - has some of the crisp qualities of a classic pilsner along with some unique fruity and musty qualities, not the best example of the style but unique and drinkable enough to warrant a purchase"
"I've always been an 'occasional pilsener' guy, this not being one of my favourite styles, but I still appreciate a solid pils and this is one of the better examples I've had in recent memory. Clean-tasting, crisp, with all of the flavour notes you'd expect from a Czech-style pils. Not my favourite Creemore offering, but a worthy pick regardless, and likely a new brew to throw into the rotation if I'm in a pils mood."
"Very clean and crisp tasting. Dry finish. A thirst quencher--pair with spicy sausage or Indian fare"
"O/D - Fairly solid. Creemore never disapoints. They make to style lagers that are always easy to drink and make every sip enjoyable. A well put together pils."
"Drinkability - Easy to enjoy several of these in almost any season."
"Flavour is very clean, sweet malt and complex grassy hops, a touch of fruity lemon. Very little bitterness, but enough hops flavour to balance the sweet malt."
"Overall...you must try this one. Cheers!"
"I used to really like this beer, now not so much. It's a quality brew overall, but the other three from Creemore Springs are all better."
"Libation: This is a bigger beer than the 5.3% ABV would suggest. Flavorful and quite good, but there just doesn't seem to be enough balance of crispness and flavor to put it over the top."
"D: It's decent. There are a lot of better pilsners out there."
"Pours a pale yellow with bubbly white head that dissipates to a very small layer leaving spots of lacing on the glass. Smells of mild grassy hops with some bready malt. Flavour isn't very big, but it is clean. Carbonation is good. A nice enough pilsner, but there are better options in Ontario (ie. King and Mill Street). Nothing wrong with this beer though, it just doesn't quite do it for me."
"Drink - An above average beer that is worth a try. I'd be happy to drink this (or any other Creemore beer) again and again."
"Very refreshing beer and the mouthfeel is wonderful, nicely carbonated and very creamy. I like this better than their lager, but they are both great beers!"
"D- Quite drinkable. Fairly economic too. It'd be a great beer to share with friends, but I would choose something different if looking to impress somebody."
"Pours a clear golden yellow with a decent head that fades to lacing. Light grain aroma with a trace of lemon. Crisp, clean taste with a mild trace of lemon and a good bitter finish. Fairlt light body that is creamy and smooth. A very enjoyable beer that goes down easy. Good for kicking back after a long day."
"Crystal clear pale gold colour. A soapy white head fell quickly and didn't leave much behind on the glass. A thin collar did linger for a while, but disappeared quickly too. Mild aroma, sweet cereal and malts, grassy and spicy hops. Sturdy bitterness, mild citrus and grassy character. Sweet malts, a bit bready. Slightly minty in the finish. Medium bodied, average carbonation, off-dry, a little too soft in texture and lacking crispness. Decent overall, but not exciting enough to search for again. The Creemore Kellerbier was much more impressive."
"An okay pils, falling someplace between a German and Bohemian pils. I hate to say it but this is more crisp straight out of the can, although the appearance is nice enough to pour into a glass every time just for that. I like it, but it's a little rough around the edges."
"Pours a pale golden that is reminiscent of ripe & ready to be combined wheat. Head though is minimal, descends quickly and quite unimpressive with no lacing... The aroma of the beer is a lightly bready malt with some hop aroma. Enjoyable, though a little light for my liking. The body of the beer comes across well though. Balanced with light hop spiciness and a good crisp malt. An enjoyable quaff on a hot day. Later in the session a slight vegetal flavour lingers on the palate, which is off-putting. Interesting, though not a beer I would precipitate towards again..."
" this is a well rounded beer and I have no complaints worth mentioning, drink it if you get the chance"
"D - A tasty pilsener, but nothing overly memorable. Easily drinkable and non-offensive, but don't look to this one for any unique or stand-out flavours."
"I purchased this in an 8-pack of 473 mL cans, and I'd definitely do it again. Not a beer to show off to friends or treat yourself with, but definitely nice to share (and to have in your fridge). And it's perfect for the summer!"
"Creemore Springs Pilsner pours a light copper gold with a foamy head. The aroma is grainy, a bit of DMS. Some sweet pilsner malt pokes through, along with a hint of herbal hops. The flavor is more grainy pale malt, slightly tannic with some cooked corn. There is an assertive bitterness and some herbal lemony hop flavor that leads into a dry finish. I was expect this to be about as much of pilsner as Miller Lite, so I was happily surprised."
"Not bad, certainly quite drinkable, but my least favorite of the Creemore brews. Definitely needs to be more assertive. Still, I'll happily drink this one over other local lagers, but there's more robust examples of the Czech style to be had."
"D - Goes down pretty quick. Not my favourite Pilsner but it's still pretty good."
"Overall, an average pilsner but the poorest of Creemore's offerings in my opinion. If I could describe this beer in one word it would be lacking; lacking in smell, taste, and mouthfeel. This one might be a bit more enjoyable than some of the other Euro imports of the same style at the LCBO, but you don't have to look far for a better offering."
"I think its my favorite Beer of Creemore thus far. Nice work."
"A drinkable enough Canadian-made pilsener, sure, but our expectations are so abysmally low (thank you, Pil!) that we get all giddy about stuff like this, when it is hardly all that adherent to the real Bohemian style. Sigh, oh well, one period in and the score is 1-0 Canada. Woot on that account, at least."
"I'd drink it again. It was a nice warm sunny September day, with cicadas buzzing and all that, so it worked. I won't go looking for it, though."
"You won't find the world's best pilsner in Creemore, Ontario - that is a matter of fact. Whether you'll find a dreadfully mediocre, frankly underachieving pilsner or a commendable, higher-than-average one is a matter of opinion. My personal opinion would side with the former although I don't wish to give the impression this is a bad beer, not by any means. As unexceptional this is as a pilsner, it's by no means inferior for a conventional lager."
"This newest addition to the creemore lineup is by far the best. The pour releases an almost copper body, with a head that is frothy, and long lived. Good lace here as well. The aroma is chalk full of floral sazz and dripping with fresh hay and grass, with some good grainy rye notes. Czech sipcy hops fill the mouth with flavour, floral flavours follow. Fresh cut grass, greens, hay, a touch of lemon zest. Very crisp fizzy finish, lots of fresh hops, good bitterness in the finish. I'd say this is a fine classic example. Some of these ratings seem to be bashing the pilsner style instead of embracing a very well made one."
"With a billion (I counted) pilseners available to me at the LCBO I'm afraid this one is far down the list for me. As for what tradition this traditional pilsner is I can not say."
"Cheers."
"Between light and medium bodied with carbonation levels approaching moderate. I wouldn't say no if offered, but there's better pils to be had in Ontario."
"Final Thoughts: Well, it's certainly better then their urBock but still not as good as their lager. A decent beer to have with your buddies during poker night or if you were by the pool and didn't want to get smashed. A good beer, worth a shot but stick to buying individual cans, not a whole pack."
"I prefer the Creemore lager to this. The hop presence is there, but the heavy malt character takes something away."
"Poured a medium golden-yellow color with a larger sized white head. Aromas of graininess, wet grass, and I was getting some spiciness. Tastes of the same graininess and had a lighter sweetish finish."
"Overall: a solid natural and unfiltered pilsner. I honestly expected it to be a dud, as I was unimpressed with the brewery's bock. But this is some fine stuff. Well done, Creemore."
"Bottle- ours light golden, frothy head that goes quickly. Nose- bready malts and some hop spicyness. Taste- toasty bready malts, peppery saaz hops add a flowery finish. Finishes dry with mineral and herbal zing. Nice stuff actually and perfect on the deck quaffing."
"I tried this beer on March 12, 2008 after purchasing from one of the local LCBO outlets. The poured a translucent gold colour with a generous head that quickly disippates. The aroma was very malty with some slight hoppish hints. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with medium carbonation. The flavour was very grainy, with very little bitterness."
"Too sweet for me, actually ended drainpouring the last little bit as it was cloying and syrupy."
"Pours a nice traditional pilsner yellow, with a promising foamy head, which unfortunately quickly dies to a film. The aroma reminds me of lemon dish soap, but breaking is down further I might suggest it is a mix of lemon, grass and celery, which would be expected. Nonetheless, I don't find it particularly welcoming. The flavour is initially rich with this aroma, and the smooth texture helps to reinforce the idea of soapiness. Its not unpleasant, but again not something that I'm really looking for. Thankfully, after a while this settles down, and a sweet maltiness takes over for the rest of the ride. A nice level of floral hoppy bitterness lurks out the edges, helping to keep this pils nice and refreshing. No doubt I could drink another of these to quench my thirst on a hot day, but whether I would do so with so many other good brew available is unlikely."
"Can: Poured a golden yellow color pils with a nice foamy head with average retention and some minimal lacing. Aroma of medium sweet malt with some nice floral notes provided by the hops. Taste is also dominated by some notes of sweet malt with some nice hoppy floral notes. Very refreshing overall while respecting the style guideline."
"The descriptor on the can says their brewmaster visited Czechlosovakia to study and replicate the true Czech pilsners. Sorry to say he missed the mark. This one needs lots more hop character and depth to make a true Czech pils. Not recommended."
"After try a few Canadian beers from the can, I must admit I was ready to judge this one by its cover. I'd tried a supposed ""IPA"" that was really just a lager, with hardly any hops to be tasted, so when I read ""Pilsner"" on the side of this can I got worried before even taking the first sip. Therefore when I did try the first sip I was pleasantly surprised. It does taste like a pilsner! Unfortunately after a few more sips the cloying sweetness sets in and the lack of hops becomes more noticeable. Overall it's pretty average. I had a hard time finishing it and actually ended up throwing half of it away."
"D: Very approachable & balanced, but a little too much sweetness for me."
"A very clear, pale straw hue in the glass with a hint of amber but light coloured. I found the head a bit soapy at first with large bubbles that lingered, eventually left with a ring of froth around the glass and a few clear spots here and there. The carbonation was good with a bit of staying power. An aroma of freshly cut grass and a touch of balsa wood. Smooth and a touch foamy in the mouth with pronounced hops, dry. A touch of spice in the finish surprized me. Balanced bitterness; overall I'm impressed for this style of brew, but then again, I started out as a Pilsner drinker years ago so I may be embellishing a little."
"Taste is a well-balanced bitterness, grapefruit, and a drop of honey. Very drinkable and very surprising. I had pretty well assumed that this would be a bomb, considering the Molson purchase. I'm glad to see that it hasn't yet affected the output of the brewery. That said, it doesn't really go out of its way to justify being a special edition or whatever it is. It's just a pilsner."
"I'm not a pilsner fan, generally, but I grabbed a couple of tall cans of this from the LCBO just to try it out. For a pilsner, it's not bad! Nice, slightly darker-than-average colour with a solid white head (poured into a pilsner glass). Mild but pleasant malty aroma with a bit of a spritzy lemon/spice note to it. Taste is pleasantly hoppy but subtle, with very little of that pilsner funk/skunk/""beery"" taste that I dislike. Nice mouthfeel, although a little more carbonation than I usually like in a beer in general. Drinkable, and would be great to have a few of these outside, grilling chicken or something on a sunny day."
"The palate is sweet, malty with some a well balanced hop profile. Dry and bitter finish. A great take on a Czech Pilsener."
"Taste is a bit better, but that soapiness is still lingering a bit. Nice grassy, peppery hop profile though, and there's a slight nuttiness to the grainy malt that I like as well. Bitterness is clean and complimentary, not overwhelming. Body isn't too light or anything, and it slides down pretty easy. Dry finish. Carbonation is just right for the style. If it wasn't for that unpleasant soapy note in the aroma and in the taste, this would probably be above average for me, but as it stands, it's just another pilsner."
"Pours a deep gold color with a tight white head. Foam recedes, but never disappears leaving a thin cap and this stings of lace. Some malt aroma with just enough floral hops. Clean tasting brew, nice mix of malt and hop bitterness. Smooth mouthfeel, light yet creamy, dry finish. It is almost easier to describe what isn't there - no adjunct sweetness, no sour finish, no big carbonation bubbles for that bloated feeling. The more I drink the more I like. A very good beer, lots of flavor, without one aspect being overpowering."
"Pours a clear golden, one finger white head forms, settles down to a thin ring, leaves some decent lacing on the glass. Smell is sweet and grassy, citrus, cereal, sugar, bit of spicy hopping, not too bad. Taste is sweet and malty, very bready cereal character, citrus, bit of floral, grainy bitter finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation. Drinkable, pretty decent drink, has some nice character."
"Overall even if its not a traditional pilsner, its still right up there with some of my favorite pilsners. The big advantage this beer has is that it tastes so fresh. Recommended."
"This is in no way a traditional pilsner, only in a very broad sense. Good malty aroma. It was so-so lagerish up front, and decent bitterness on back like a maibock hits me. Drinkable with some creamy mouthfeel, and overall, probably because so fresh and new, a decent refreshing and positive surprise beer. I would send it as a hitchhiker, but not worth especially trading for. Dry aftertaste."
"D - I like this a lot, good flavour yet still refreshing."
"All in all, Creemore's Traditional Pilsner lacks the complexity of the other major Ontario pilsners. But its simplicity is also its strength - what is here is quite tasty, and I would take it over King Pilsner almost any day. Creemore's flagship lager has certainly gone downhill in the past year, but this is a nice reminder of the brewery's potential. If only they'd try their hands at a stout or even a wheat beer."
"The answer is this is fresher and even if it is deficient in several factors as a ""tradtional"" Czech pils, a fresh impersonator is better than a stale or over dated authentic import."
"Does it unseat King Pilsner as the scientifically validated best pilsner in Ontario (in my opinion)? I think it may."
