4.4,12.2,3.75,5,4.25,4.25,4.25,"O:  very nice.  Sharp corners on a true Old World style in that it isn't overly Americanized.  the sweetness is not full on bread malt, but the grassy hop bite is also restrained nicely, so it's really solid.  Live Oak is becoming world-craftbeer-wide famous for it's hefeweizen, but this pils is no slouch at all.  fantastic beer.","Premo88","Feb 08, 2015"

3.97,1.3,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Taste shows plenty of bitterness. Not an abundance of hop flavor and it does have a decent malt backing.

3.8,-3.1,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Overall: This is a great interpretation of a German style pils, in fact better than many of the German pils I’ve had in the past in Germany. It’s clean and refreshing and perfect for the summer. Easily in my top two for the style.","jamescain","Jun 09, 2011"
4.03,2.8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"The beer is light orange, with 1/2" head and lasting retention. The aroma is really nice, bringing a healthy dose of pils malt. The flavor is malt forward, and lacks the Noble hop presence of a beer like Prima Pils. I actually prefer less of a hop presence / finish in a pilsener. The carbonation level is spot on. The growler packaging job was superb, and this was fresh tasting and full of zesty carbonation. The finish was quite dry, which I rather liked. Overall, a solid example of the style. I am very glad to have tried this, and I would certainly enjoy having it again.","Huhzubendah","May 26, 2011"

3.68,-6.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Pours a clear gold color with a fizzy white head that leaves behind some average spotty lacing. The nose carries a heavy malt presence comprised of straw and grain. Also some light herbal and floral hops. The flavor is quite grainy and straw-like without much hop presence. There's also just a touch of sweetness. Light bitterness on a light body with average carbonation. Somewhat-dry finish. A solid beer, but a bit too grainy and not complex enough for my tastes. Would like to have seen a bit more noble hop character.","Thorpe429","May 24, 2011"

Solid bitterness from start to finish, mild cereal sweetness with plen more floral and spicy hop character. It had more body than I expected for a pils, a little more richness, but the texture was smooth and carbonation was soft, making for a very easy to drink beer. I quite enjoyed this beer and could see it becoming a staple if it was available in my area.","DrJay","May 21, 2011"
3.7,-5.6,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Clear gold body half finger white head full pour, multiple streams of lazy rising carbonation. Classic pilsener nose, quite floral, some breadiness and noble hops, not much sweetness. Taste mirrors nose, though once again not very sweet. Medium mouthfeel, clean, with little effervescence. Drinkable but hardly memorable. While it has a similar grade, not in the same league of Moonlight or Victory. Worth a try, however.","jdense","May 10, 2011"

Taste is pale sweet upfront, lots of spicy Saaz in the middle, which just keeps on keeping on through the close.

Smells like hop heaven with an abundance of floral notes. Made with mostly czech ingredients -- Hops from bohemia, barley from moravia -- this is as czech as you can get in Texas. Hop bitterness up front balances well with the bready finish, a very straightforward lager. This is my idea of a czech pilsner: slightly malty, very bitter.","pmcgill10","Dec 08, 2008"

Had a very thick lacing which stayed throughout the life of the drink. Tasted of big hops and spice with a perfect unmistakable pis crispness. Was really surprised at the hop bite on this one. Behind all of that there was some grain, yeasts, spice and grass. The lacing was thick throughout. There was a quick burst of bubbles on a shake, displaying the high carbonation of the beer. Excellent and tasty pils, and like no other I've had before.","stephens101","Nov 22, 2008"

Heavy, doughy, musty yeasty smelling It smells strongly of mushy yeast and dough which isn't my favorite as the style goes, but still okay. As far as the taste, it is a lightly bitter bite, with a smooth finish. I didn't find this refreshing like some pilsners but rather, gooey and thicker from the heavily yeasty smell present in the nose, and also somewhat present in the taste. If you like heavy yeast flavor this is a great pilsner for you. I still prefer Live Oak's other beers to this, I'd say.","JDV","Feb 06, 2008"

4.24,8.2,3,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Drinkability: Eminently drinkable - one of the better domestic pilsners I have tasted; not as big and bitter as Victory but easier to drink because of the floral elements","brentk56","May 14, 2007"
4.69,19.6,4,5,4.5,4.5,5,"This is my second favorite LO beer and probably one of my favorite Pilseners of all time (better than any bottled import I've tried; not as hoppy as a Victory Prima, but still a real craft beer). Can drink this stuff like it was made from water!","BeerZack","Apr 15, 2007"
4.55,16.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Hands down my favorite pilsner. While I am a fan of the "big beers," this is the pilsner with the most taste I've ever had. Has some that green bottle skunky taste like a true Czech pilsner but much more more fresh and tasty (only coming from a few miles away). Grassy, floral, some peppered grain, slightly hoppier than most, authentic ingredients...I could easily drink 2 pitchers of this in a night. Highly recommended to get a keg of. If you're ever in Austin or Texas, definitely try all of the Live Oaks. If only they bottled and had greater marketing and distribution...","MEsquandoles","Feb 08, 2007"
4.25,8.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"As I said above, this is a great Czech Pilsner. If you like a highly hopped brew with some good balance, this is your brew. One of my faves brewed right here in Austin!","AustinBeerLvr","Dec 27, 2006"
4.3,9.7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a pale golden amber color with a bright white head that has a nice retention. Nose is dominated by floral grassy hops but some fruity malt is detectable in the background. Taste mimics the aroma with spicy citrusy hops being the key players while kept in check by a solid malt backbone. A very hearty and thoroughly enjoyable Pils.","Morris729","Dec 12, 2006"

3.5,-10.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Live Oak Pilz is a very good beer, but not something that gets me really excited. I'm pretty sure this is my first Czech pilsener, so I can't compare to anything. Appearance is a nice golden color, maybe a little hazy. Head is an average one-finger. Smell is a mix of mild piney hops and citrus. Wasn't quite expecting the pineyness. Taste is much like the smell, starts with mild pine hops and ends with a lemony zing. Fairly complex, but not too exciting. I usually like beers a little more malty. Drinkability is pretty good, this seems like the kind of beer that gets better after you get used to it after a couple pints. By the way, Live Oak beers are only available on-tap in central Texas, and in a few places in Houston.","Gagnonsux","Jul 29, 2004"
4.13,5.4,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Notes: This is one tasty brew that will slap you silly (in a good way) when you expect the traditional style. If I had a way to get growlers of this and/or their hefe, it would be a staple in my fridge! Cheers!","BeerAngel","Mar 27, 2004"
4.1,4.6,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Overall Impression: A very solid brew. If I hadn’t been traveling I could see making a session of it. Very happy to see a Texas brewery putting out such a fine product. If you are in the area, do try a sample.","HardTarget","Feb 07, 2004"
4,2,4,4,4,4,4,"MJ brought along a of keg of this for his tasting at the 3-22-03 event. Sweet musty nose. Not much of a persistant head.. slight white ring of fine foam in the glass. Gold color to the brew in the glass. Upon first sample you really note the balenced bitterness. The bitterness is there but the malt spine really stands up to it. Smooth mouth with a medium body. Crisp, bitter hop finish to the taste and tongue. Quite drinkable. There is also a very slight smoke (oak?) finish to the beer as well. A nice pilzzzzzzz.","frank4sail","Apr 16, 2003"
