3.79,2.7,3.75,4,3.75,3.5,3.75,"I Pop!ped the cap and commenced a slow, steady pour so as to not rouse any lees that may have settled onto the punt during my bottle's stint in my reefer. Naturally, this did not allow for the formation of any head, so I again employed the bartender's trick and wound up with a finger of foamy, bone-white head that quickly fell, leaving some nice lacing in its wake. Color was Yellow (SRM = 4) with NE-quality clarity. Nose reminded me more of a German Pilsner with its biscuity malt presence alongside of the  hops. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium. The taste was definitely hop-forward with a grassy, lemony flavor accompanied by the biscuit maltiness to add up to something that reminded me of lemon biscotti. Mmmm. I had one of these on draft this past summer and I remember it being highly refreshing. I really enjoy crisp, clean Czech Pilsners on hot summer days and this really fit the bill that time. Finish was dry, clean and highly refreshing. Last pour: cloudy, malt more pronounced, still quite dry.","woodychandler","Feb 14, 2015"
4.67,26.6,5,4.75,4.5,4.75,4.75,"This is one of the very finest Czech style pilseners I've ever had.  It's an exceptional example of the style, up there with my other favorite pils (Mama's Little Yella, Lagunitas, Blue paddle, Summit).  I would buy cases and cases of this and have it as a staple in my fridge if it were available in my area.","Mitchster","Feb 08, 2015"

Some underlying fruitiness like strawberries. Clean Pilsner tastes with crisp bitter finish. Very clean tasting. Light and very drinkable. Nicely done beer. Not a standout in last summer's beer camp variety case, but a very well executed beer nonetheless.","jwhancher","Feb 01, 2015"

It seems very grainy at moments but then cuts back to citrus or grassy spices and is quite easy to drink with a lot of muted flavors that seem so interconnected that you can’t differentiate them. Easy to drink, it was light and crisp but not as hoppy as I expected yet still a real nice pilsner with above average flavor for the style.","CHickman","Jan 04, 2015"

Appearance was of a clear dark golden color, and was consumed directly from the bottle so lacing and finer details were lost upon me. Mouth feel was excellent and light with plenty of carbonation. The taste of this beer came with a nice bite up front from the generous hops, and faded quickly to a light sweet malty note that failed to linger long enough for my tastes.

Hops don't offer excessive bitterness, but they provide lots of floral flavor. Light bitterness and dryness in the finish. Mouthfeel is light and crisp. The carbonation is moderate. A great pilsner.

This is the needle in the haystack because it would blend perfect with some hay. Not the biggest nose here but those classic pilsner malts come through. After taking a sip, the flavor makes up for the mediocre nose. Crisp, clean pilsner just as it should be, lots of dry hops on the back end. Really tasty, I thoroughly enjoyed this one out of the Beer Camp, maybe the best of the lagers.

The beer smell is a bit sweet and hoppy. The sweet is more of a sweet and bready malt smell while the hop is a grassy and floral smell. The taste is similar to the smell. Floral notes with a sweet and bready backbone to take a little of the hop edge off. Other than that the beer is not overly complex and a little bit more hop forward than the average pilsner. The mouthfeel is crisp and light bodied but on the heavy side. The beer has biting carbonation but a little heavy when compared to the average pilsner. Overall ,the beer is decent. Firestone's original Pils is much better and just adding hops to something you already feels like they just phoned it in. I'm not saying it's bad but I'm saying that Firestone probably missed a good opportunity to get a little creative.","HattedClassic","Jul 26, 2014"

Pours fairly crystal clear golden straw color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of bright lemon zest, mango, white grape, pear, apple, cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of bright fruity/earthy hops, pale malt, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of bright lemon zest, mango, white grape, peach, pear, apple, cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, mango, white grape, pear, apple, cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity, robustness, and balance of bright fruity/earthy hops, pale malt, and yeast ester notes; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Czech pilsner style. Around good balance and robustness of bright fruity/earthy hops, pale malt, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink.

Flavor begins with biscuit malt and light floral hops, developing drier, crackery malt with more grassy and floral hops, finishing semi dry with a nice balance of biscuit and grassy, floral hop bitterness.

3.84,4.1,4,3.75,3.75,4,4,"Poured a beautiful cloudy rich golden yellow with two fingers of fluffy white head. A gorgeous looking pilsner. Scents of floral, jasmine, perfume-like hops, a faint touch of tropical fruit and a honey/graham cracker character from the Pils malt. A crisp, clean appealing aroma profile most similar to a German Pilsner, with a bit more fruit character than is common for the style. Flavor begins nicely bitter, with crisp floral hop flavors and a low, yet present, Pils malt sweetness and an extremely faint hint of citrus peel. The middle is dominated by floral hop flavors with a moderate bitterness level and a slight presence of Pils malt sweetness. Finish is dry with floral hop flavors most reminiscent of jasmine with some slight herbal hop character in the background. Aftertaste is floral hops with notes of jasmine with moderate bitterness and a slight hint of graininess. A good German Pilsner flavor, very much balanced towards floral hops with malt present, but not overwhelming at any point in the sip. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate-high carbonation and a crisp, drying mouthfeel. Easy to drink. Overall this is a good, easy drinking German Pilsner that brings a well rounded, reasonably dry floral flavor balanced against just enough Pils malt in the flavor combining with a nice aroma and mouthfeel. Not the most daring experiment, but quite good regardless.","Auraan","Beers"

It tastes pretty much just like the aroma, but with the addition of some tropical fruit and light piney hops.

Good looking beer. The aroma has lager sulfur, fruity hops, fresh pale grain and a little bit of that lager-y yeastiness. Hops are a nice mix of light stone fruit, tropical notes and grapes. Some mint in there, as well. That said, hops are more restrained than expected. The underlying pils seems solid. Relatively dry. Moderate bitterness, probably would seem stronger with a drier, crisper pils base. Fresh sugary malt. Good lager yeast flavor. Prickly carbonation recedes relatively quickly. Fair bit of hop oiliness for a pils, which kinda throws things off for me. I like this beer, but I think the thought was a bit better than the execution.

Its greatest asset is something that might not appeal to everyone: its bitterness. I think that what happened was SN used their ""Torpedo"" hop rocket using noble hops and the result was more straight-up hop bitterness than people are accustomed to. I like it; it reminds me of the highly rated Victory Prima Pils (without the metallic taste). Great beer for sessioning and would be excellent with food, especially a great, big, charbroiled bacon cheeseburger.","BeerDocT","Jul 15, 2014"

The aroma is floral with a bit of hay and hint of grape. The taste is dry with a bit of hay and some floral notes. There is also a little bit of grape and some earthiness present. The finish is dry with a slight bit of a mineral taste. Light body. Medium carbonation. A solid pilsner.","jethrodium","Jul 13, 2014"

4.16,12.7,4,4.25,4.25,4,4,"Pours a deep gold capped by a huge, fluffy bright white two and half finger head. Stone fruit, pomegranate, and mixed herbal notes on the nose. Opens with light passion fruit, husked grain, and light lemon zest. Lightly sweet malt combined with floral accents, edible orchids. Finishes clean with mixed fresh mild herbs and mild lime zest bitterness. Light bodied, high level of carbonation, crisp and slick mouthfeel. Really wonderful brew.

But with more intense hop flavors. A nice balance of a pils and IPA. I got the best tastes from a pils and from an IPA in this. It had a nice bitter taste, and truly refreshing.","Celtics17","Jul 06, 2014"
