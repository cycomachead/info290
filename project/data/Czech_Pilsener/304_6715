2.25,-37.5,,,,,,"Review based on the BJCP2008 (style 2B - Bohemian pilsner). Bottle 33 cl - Batch unknown. AROMA: mild sweet and grainy aroma with some DMS. no floral hop aromas. APPEARANCE: gold color and translucent. thin creamy white head with average retention. TASTE: mild sweet grainy flavour. medium-low bitterness with a medium-dry finish. PALATE: medium-thin body with medium carbonation. OVERALL: a bland bohemian pilsner. where are the Saaz hops? NOTE: the label says ""Czech Imported Lager"" wich we are inclined to believe this is a special batch without the hops. We have in memory that this beer is more hop intensive than this drinked example.","titvs","Dec 10, 2014"

Here in the good old US a beer that has been made for hundreds of years has to change the name to Czechvar because of corporate lawsuits. Anyway, this is a great beer. It has all the characteristics of a pilsner. A little malty, a slight bit of hoppiness, but its very grassy and a wonderful summer quaff. It is one of those beers you could session easily and very enjoyable on a warm summer evening, although its not really that way at the moment in these parts.

Spicy floral hops and sweet bready grainy pilsner malt with a hint of rich melanoidin make up the bulk of the aroma. The flavor is sharp with spicy hop flavor, balanced by a honey like sweetness wrapped into a brown bread. Medium body with a spirited level of carbonation and a slick bubbly mouthfeel.

Flavor is mild, with an upfront hit of lemon, a nice mellow hop bitterness, sweet pilsener malt and some light, grassy hop notes. Nice and mild, one note flavors and easy to drink.

No barrels and barrels of hops; no crazy combinations of toasted and roasted malts; no high ABV to mask off flavors. In every 10 Czech Pilseners, I may find one that is worth revisiting. Budjejovicky's Budvar is a slightly unique, well-balanced rendition of the genre that has made it onto my short list. I'll be revisiting this brew soon.","GMB","Dec 17, 2012"

I'm always nervous about beer in green bottles but I figured this was fresh and something new to taste. The beer pours with a clear golden color and about 1 finger of head that quickly settles. I think this beer has already suffered from light exposure as it has a mild case of the skunks going. I imagine it smells and taste much better from a tap than a bottle.

The Summit and Czechvar are so close that it comes down to a matter of preferences. If you want a little more of the Bohemian malt flavor and Saaz hops, then go with the Czechvar.

The pour was straw yellow with no head at all and dead carbonation. It was difficult to catch anything special in the aroma. Maybe a little hoppy thing. The body was thin.

It manages to stick around for a minute or two, but doesn't leave any lacing behind. The nose is subpar at best. It basically smells like sulfer and skunked beer. I think there's a faint bit of floral hoppiness in there as well, but it's so far in the background that it's barely perceptible. The flavor is a bit more polished, as sulfer and skunk sink back into minor supporting roles. There's a solid bready malt presence and herbal noble hop notes as well. The body is appropriately light and spry, and the carbonation is subtly bubbly.

A fairly uninteresting nose of basic graininess and only the slightest hint of floral spice (unfortunately in equal parts of skunk coming up) leads to a surprisingly fresh, light mouthfeel.

On the palate, the malts continue to dominate bringing a light bready flavor mingling with a lackluster amount of noble hops. Bitterness is just not up to par with its partner Pilsner Urquell giving it a somewhat murkier medium rich flavor. Not as crisp as you would want from a Czech pils.

The beer is a straw-golden color with a white head. The smell is typical of the style: bready pils malts with spicy saaz hops. The taste is similar to the smell. Overall though, the flavor is a bit on the weak side. It makes for any enjoyable, easy to drink beer, but I could use a bit more flavor. The mouthfeel is light and crisp, but not too thin.

Hops linger on the palate for quite a while, but not in an unpleasant way. Crisp and well-carbonated but not as bloating as most macro lagers.

It sits in the pils glass crystal-clear, gold, with an active body that is topped with a finger of whitish head which eventually reduces to almost nothing. Lots of noble hops in the nose (floral/green and spicy/skunky notes) with a touch of sweet malt. The first sip reveals a crisp body and medium bitterness backed by pale and lightly-toasted malts. But soon the hops take over and contribute an array of flavors - skunky, spicy/perfumy notes, pine?, lemon?, lime? - on top of a light/medium, crisp, drying body that leaves a medium finish. Overall a delicious pilsner which is well-worth trying; one that would make both a great session beer and an ideal one for converting your macro friends.","mmmbeer","Mar 19, 2007"

Nose is lightly hopped, grassy and citrusy with some light breadiness and full grains. Archetypal czech pils, with Saaz hops providing their distinctive character over the light lager. Taste is light and fruity, lemon and herbal hoppiness over a full and grainy malt bill. Light grassy notes and a touch of crackers and yeast rounds it out. Mouthfeel is nicely crisp and quite well carbonated, and drinkability is very good, though not much above expectations for the style. Very nice pilsner, drinkable and pleasant.

In fact the hops are much more prominent in the flavor than in the aroma; here the grassy, almost hay like hop character looms quite large in the flavor profile. There is a touch of herbal lemon character (sort of like lemon grass or maybe even lemon thyme), especially in the finish where a light tartness seems to magnify it a bit. Just a hint of diacetyl seems to round out the malt components; it seems to add a touch of toffee to the finish. The finish also has a nice solid bitter note to it that lingers a bit on the tongue. All in all this is a nice beer, while the aroma was not quite as fresh as I remembered, the flavor was still nicely tasty.","Gueuzedude","Jan 15, 2007"

It's interesting that this gets it low marks on this website often, because such clarity was rare and highly sought after in the nineteenth century when this beer was discovered by U.S. brewers. It has a foamy, crackly head with inconsistent bubble sizes (I'll count that against its appearance) and little retention and spotty lacing. The smell is grainy and actually had a distinct iced-tea aroma at warmer temperatures. The taste is of pale malts and very moderate sweetness reigned in slightly by noble Saaz hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is clean and bright with a medium length finish and not too much lingering taste.

Pilsener and pale malt sweetness take charge upfront, followd by a deeply floral and spicy saaz flavor, which gives way to an exsquisite balance. Aftertaste dries, and reveals a mild skunky off-flavor; though not totally inappropriate. Light in body, with a high carbonation, but not overly crisp.

There is a fruitiness that I've yet had in a pilsner. The body is just right for the style, a little heavier than most pilsners, but the added body seems to come from the amount of malt used.

Times have changed and the journey this fine brew takes to get to the west coast of the good 'ol USA takes its toll. I remember it being a brew that really knocked my socks off so to speak. Amazingly crisp and refreshing. Light but packed full of hoppy goodness. Now, (insert endless possibilities here) for whatever reason it seems to have lost that crispness that I loved about it. Hops are spicey but alot less lively than I recall. buttery at times. Its pretty good by all means just not one that I'll go out of my way for.

4.11,14.2,4.5,3.5,4,4,5,"Here it is, the beer Busch's flagship was named after. Can't believe its mostly famous for that reason, as this is a very good beer in its own right. Appearance is very light when it pours, but when you let it settle, it is a very clear amber rather than the bright yellow typical of American versions of this style. The head is bright white, rather small, and shortlived. Smell is ok but not very strong. Its clean and almost like ginger ale. The taste is something I've never quite experienced before. Its delicate, subtle, but still not boring. It starts out sweet, with a definate suggestion of lemon, then gets a little malty, and ends with a bitter hop bite that is a tiny bit metallic. Mouthfeel is fine. Is probably a bit thin, but every aspect of this beer fits together perfectly, so I won't complain and I doubt many other people do either. Drinkability is great. I had two and you could definately drink this all night. It would be hard to rate this beer too high. There are other beers I've enjoyed more (mostly cheaper and easier to find too), but within its style Budvar (Czechvar in America since after a very long legal battle Busch has successfully prevented the actual Budwieser from selling its product under its own name) is without a doubt the best beer I have ever had. I have never had a better or more enjoyable beer in the pilsner or ""pale lager"" category. Before Budvar, the pale lager I gave the best rating to was a light beer (Amstel Light). I was starting to wonder if this type of beer was worthwhile at all. Clearly if its done well enough, it is. This is a must try for anyone who's a fan of Pilsners or Pale Lagers (This means American Macro drinkers too). And this would be a great beer anytime you wanted to knock back a few of something pleasant and easy to drink. Even though Urquell is supposed to have done it first, I think this is the beer that defines pilsner. How good is this? I drink Amber/Red lager not pale lagers. When I drink lager I mostly prefer Americans to imports. And this is 8 Bucks for a sixpack vs about 5 for my favorite beer. But I'd still buy it again (though not every day). Come to think of it, the ability of the brewery to get this to market fresh is mind boggling. Its shipped from Central Europe, its in a green bottle, it can't be have that high a turnover, yet this is as fresh as anything I've had from New York or Pennsylvannia if not fresher. Bottom line: if you like pale lagers, try this at your next oppertunity. You won't be sorry. Especially if your pale lager of choice is Busch's ""Budwieser"". They don't just share a name, having tried the real thing, I think Busch did try to copy this beer. But their recipe is the mutant bastard spawn of this beer.","casualbeerman","Jan 07, 2006"
3.34,-7.2,3,4,3,3,3.5,"Gold in colour and strongly carbonated. Classic saaz hop, sulfur, and light malt aromas... with perhaps a slightly greater leaning towards the malt than other Bohemian pilsners that Ive tried.

This is a great pilsner any way you look at it. A bit more heavy bodied than some Czech and Euro pilsners. Color is like rich yellow gold -- not as pale as other lagers. Aroma is of dried berries and hay. This is a medium hopped lager (look into Pilsner Urquel for a hoppier czech pils) that is perhaps more balanced than most.

Flavor was straightforward and very quaffable; grain, malt, hops, herbs and minor sweetness blended well, with a hint of bitterness at the finish. Very nice.

The smell is of a subtle, yet rich smooth malt and mild saaz hops. The first taste repeats the aroma with a more pronounced hop and carb bite and tapers off into the pillowy malt zone. This is a medium bodied brew for this style and finishes slightly dry. This is an outstanding beer! These beers are way underated IMO as I see them as being no less complex than big beers.

I didn't detect the herb flavors that some have remarked about, but I only drank 2, so perhaps if I get the chance again I'll be able to scrutinize it a bit more.

This must have impaired the quality, exactly how much I can't tell. A couple of other raters had the same impression of the beer as I had, and they probably had a fresher can/bottle. Disappointment is the word, folks! Still, I'd like to sample this brew fresh on tap in the Czech Rep. before letting the axe fall. As it is, I have to say that Staropramen has a lot more going.

This brew is pretty crisp and clean with cereal-like grain and bitter Saaz taking the forefront but the light, sweet malt makes a brief appearance around mid-palate. Traditionally, Bohemian Pilseners are more substantial than their German counterparts but this one seems a tad light to me....like it could use just a little bit more malt.

You can really tell that it doesnt use rice and or corn. The mouthfeel is nice but borders on being a bit too fizzy and turning it into a belch machine.

A deepr malt presence was detected in the smell, but a sharper, somewhat citrus hop odor stood out. The crisp taste centered around a refined maltiness, and the aggressive hops provided a slightly bitter component. Very refreshing, Budvar serves as a model for the distinctly Czech pilsener taste. Mine would have tasted even better if it weren't for some residual metallic hint from the bottle cap. The mouthfeel had just the right consistency and carbonation for the medium body. Its easy drinking, and pleasant taste give this high drinkability.

It is as complicated as you'll let it be. Simplicity is often the hardest achievable goal to admire. A smooth pour, followed by a very delicate hop aroma. The deep but discernible malt flavors surface while lightly masked by the saaz flavors. A smooth mouthfeel remains behind while reminding you to taste again. This shall be my desire to one day come close to duplicating. Cheers to Budvar!","kennywoodbrew","Dec 30, 2002"

A honey coated biscuit mingles with steely hop through a draught and eventually funnels into a tart, tongue smacking pile of fresh leaves. A pleasing lace is left behind for entertainment as a glass is steadily drained. Weighty, but light, like concrete with wings. A class Pils enjoyable anytime.","inebrius","Dec 19, 2002"

4.35,20.8,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Apparently AB really has a tendency to do this. A little thing I learnt on the Heineken Brewery Tour in Amsterdam - The Clydesdale horses and Wagon logo was first used by Heineken in the 1700's about 100 years before AB existed. The reason is the larger horses were needed to actually pull the wagon and deliver the large wooden barrels of beer around the city. The Sr. Heineken’s widow actually drove the wagon that to this day with a team of horses sits in the stables in the 1st floor of the old Amstel Brewery just south of the red light district in Amsterdam","AtrumAnimus","Dec 10, 2002"

Some sweet butterscotch smells initially then fade. Decent grain, and malt smells. Very much a standard Pilsener smells. Sour oder emerges more toward the bottom. Taste is very evenly sour,then light malt taste, some saaz hop bite. Sour grainy, old beer finish. Wet grass taste, but not Medium carbonation, light bodied. Overall an easy to drink and refreshing beer. Among the better pilseners I have had.","StevieW","Nov 30, 2002"

Didn't notice any ill effects to the taste or aroma as a result of being in a green bottle either. Poured a clear medium golden color with a white foamy head which disappeared to practically nothing after a few minutes. Color seemed a bit darker that most Pilsners. Aroma consisted primarily of a pleasant malt scent with Saaz hops present also. Crisp, smooth intriguing mouthfeel. Excellent balance of flavor that has a bready malt finish. This is a great Pils and definitely one I would recommend.","Winter","Nov 29, 2002"

The lovely appearance of this beer epitomizes the modern interpretation of what a beer should look like.  Aroma is well balanced between the Saaz hops and the underlying malts.  Taste begins with a sweet maltiness which soon yields to the citrus and herbal flavors of the hops.  Finish is crisp, dry, and a touch bitter.  While I'm not really a fan of the Pilsner style, this is a remarkably fine beer, not to be missed.","Pegasus","Oct 02, 2002"

The first taste is slighty sweet and malty.  The beer has a crisp, sharp finish that was expected for the style.  It's not very highly hopped, and not as bitter as I expected.  Still, this is a very good beer.","Suds","Sep 27, 2002"

Lightly hopped for pilsner, & the beer is left skewed towards malt sweetness.  Saaz hop flavor makes its presence known & the overall flavor is grassy, sweet and lightly grainy.  Finshes w/ a light sugary sweetness on the tongue that fades quickly.  ""Czechvar"" is quite a decent and drinkable pilsner, but is unfortunately short on hop bitterness.  Better than Bud, absolutely.  An outstanding Pilsner, no.  I certainly wouldn't mind drinking several of these, however.","marc77","Jul 23, 2002"

This beer had an overwhelmingly strong odor and taste of spicy stewed tomatoes. It was too strong to drink. I know this is not normal for this beer from the other reviews of it I have read (and the style doesn't allow for many strong flavors), but it was only days past the Best By date and had been stored in a refrigerator. It should have still been good. There was also some floating particles in the beer which I also assume is not normal, Pilsners typically being filtered. I will come back and rerate, but I've been told by some fellow raters that I should take this beer into account for my rating.","aracauna","Jun 07, 2002"

4.43,23.1,4.5,4,4.5,4,5,"I've been watching and waiting for my local liquor warehouse to start carrying this brew, and they finally got 6 cases on May 10.  They were already down to 2 cases when I got there after work.  I obviously got a very fresh sample.  First observation:  this ain't a Pilsener, it's a Budweiser; i.e., it's from Budweis, not Pilsen.  Budweisers are maltier than Pilseners.  Anyway, this is an incredibly drinkable beer.  Pure light golden color, nice carbonation, medium-sized white head with decent retention for a lager.  Very, very balanced in the nose and the palate - definitely more malty than a Pilsener, but hops are still evident.  One criticism:  I wish they could have stuck with Budweiser Budvar's brown glass bottle instead of going to green a la Pilsener Urquell.  I know I got a fresh batch this time, but what about the future?  In sum, it's easy to see why this is a very popular beer on the worldwide scene - I could drink an awful lot of these in a sitting.","BKotch","May 12, 2002"

This is the Budweiser Budvar sold throughout the world, but not here.  Had an off-white thick head that quickly dissipated.  Thick sticky Belgian Lace.  Absolutely clear, with a light amber color.  Weak, inoffensive aroma.  Very nice hop dryness, with light malt aftertaste.  Comparing this to A-B Bud is a crying shame. I assume that this is how American lagers tasted before prohibition, and before the macros found adjuncts.  Good, solid beer.","jackndan","Apr 11, 2002"

3.95,9.7,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Of course, this is infinitely better than Anheuser-Busch's ""Budweiser."" That goes without saying. But is this superior to Pilsner Urquell? A bit more difficult to say. Fortunately, we don't have to choose. To my mouth, this is a little better; a bit sweeter, maltier, and fuller. I might prefer PU on a hot day since it has more of a zest. However, remember that Czechvar (the US name of Budweiser Budvar) is an extremely popular, international, mass-produced brews (as is PU). While it is one of the premier brews in the style, the satisfaction it provide is very basic. Most beer drinkers should love it. Beer connoisseurs may be looking for something more.","Thrasher","Mar 06, 2002"
