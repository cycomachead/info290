Taste is floral hops up front--I'd be curious to see their hopping mix--and sweet malts in the back. No particularly outstanding notes to mention, just a nice, approachable, delicously standard brew. Mouthfeel is buttery carbonated with a crisp finish, kind of a citrusy bitterness on the aftertaste. Two best uses for this one: give it to somebody transitioning from micro to macro, or to a visiting German friend who wants a little taste of home. Only complaint I have about this one is the price.","IPhantom","Dec 06, 2011"

Color was a deep golden yellow with NE-quality clarity. Unbidden, my uncle mentioned Croesus at Thanksgiving dinner unbeknownced that I routinely allude to him and his greed, especially for gold. Nose smelled of grassy Saaz hops and I knew that I was in for a good time. I love Czech Pilsners as my favorite style of Lager beer. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was of freshly mown grass near a field of barley. This could be especially nice in the summertime.

2.87,-15.3,3,3.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,"Enjoyed on tap at the Washington, DC location. Saaz hop bitterness, not quite, near metallic. Medium yellow, a caesar crown of white and lace. Medium mouthfeel. Off bitterness that makes it not all that drinkable.Under-average beer, but hey you need a pilsner in a standard lineup.","Sammy","Jul 02, 2008"
2.8,-17.4,3,3,2.5,3,3,"D- The nice subtle Kolsh flavors of sweet sulfur like licorice hints are overpowered by bitterness and start masking all the other flavors.","rhoadsrage","May 14, 2008"
3.5,3.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This somewhat non-descript European Lager is a fine and tasty beer that went very well with the grilled chicken salad, but pushing this beer into a better celebration of German noble hops would have given a crispness to the beer that suits more of the beer's nuances much better than the deliniation of Czech Pils.","BEERchitect","Apr 22, 2008"
3.08,-9.1,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"A seethru, pale gold body with some nice head. Like any pilsner, its taste relies on its hops and this beer is alright (think Pils Urquell basically). The hops are there with no real balance or mixing. A slick passing over the tongue with some hop backbite is how I would describe this beer, and not really seperated from other pils.","clayrock81","Mar 18, 2008"

3.8,12.1,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Fresh from the tap, pours an unclouded gold, bright white creamy head piles high on the body, lacing provides a tight skirt to cove the glass. Nose sweet with malt, citrus like in its crispness, start has a pleasing malt presence, the hops delectable with their spicy bitterness at the back, top is moderate in feel to the palate. Finish has the customary acidity, the hops understated but pleasingly spicy, quite dry aftertaste, a nice drinking beer, good session beer.","Gusler","Nov 04, 2007"
3.26,-3.8,4,3,3,3,4,"Drank a half-pint of this beer on tap at the 2007 North Market Microbrew Fest. The brewer himself was there, and this is what he recommended from their selection. Pours a clear, bright yellowish-gold with a fizzy white head. Pretty good retention. Taste and smell were clean and crisp, like a nice pilsener. Nothing remarkable. Balanced between a medium maltiness and a little hoppiness. Again, nothing stands out. Sharp mouthfeel, almost bitey. Overall, pretty easy to drink. When it's a little colder, it's nice and refreshing, but anyone looking for real complexity should look elsewhere.","ndekke39","Oct 02, 2007"

2.89,-14.7,3.5,2,3,4,3,"This was poured very nicely into a GB Becker, raising an off white two finger head, over a translucent, hazy bright gold body. The head falls quickly, though, to a glass ring. Neads longer head retention and better clarity. The nose is almost nothing to speak of, just a little malt. Not bad, just not there. Taste is a bit better, with nice edelhopfen cleanliness, but I feel that they didn't stick to just noble hops. It's pretty dry, not as balanced as it could be. I don't think the malts used are not up to snuff, either. Mouthfeel is just what I expect, though not sublime. A nice drinker, but missing some points, and thus average.","mjc410","Aug 24, 2006"
4.42,30.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"This presents a clear golden color, with maybe a hint of orange. Nice frothy white head sits on top and lingers for a while, leaving a few spots of lace. Not much aroma from the pale malt, however there is a good amount of floral, spicy, and a bit grassy hops. The malt character is slightly sweet and dry, plae, and goes well with the spicy, flowery hop flavor. very clean and crisp. The hop bitterness seems almost perfect in this. Czech lagers are best fresh, and this really shows why. Light body, with a refreshing amount of carbonation. Very solid.","Bierguy5","Jul 22, 2006"
3.78,11.5,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Golden copper color in the glass, big white head, some lacing down the glass. Smell is lagery clean, with a hint of hops. Taste is the big surprise here. More hops than I expected in a pilsener, more like APA levels here, but the rest of the beer is more subdued like you'd expect in the style. Light mouthfeel, finishes well on a dry, hoppy note. Drinkable.","hunteraw","Jul 06, 2006"
4.27,26,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Presented as a bright golden color with mioderate white puffy head. Smell is very spicy and hoppy. Taste is very enjoyable with a strong crispness and a nice hoppy bitterness, Very refreshing and thirst quenching. Nice mouhtfeel. Very flavorful. Nice surprising beer.","tgbljb","Jun 11, 2006"
3.7,9.1,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Brought to the table a lovely straw-color with a finger of bubbly head. Smelled of hops and spices - cloves, maybe? Hops and spices assault the tongue on light malty undertones, definetely saaz hops. Overly bitter aftertaste, takes away from the good inital impression. Good pilsner, but nothing special. Couldn't drink more than a couple, a little too hoppy and spicy for my likings in a pilsner, but overall above average.","PenguinBeerFan","Mar 18, 2006"
4.48,32.2,5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"I hed this at the Columbus OH location. Great beer. Not Czechvar, but close. Smooth and easy to drink. Very refreshing. I really enjoyed this. The hops (Saaz?) and malt are balanced just right for this style. I was told by the manager that this beer was going on tap year round, not just a seasonal.","zsk","Jan 12, 2006"
