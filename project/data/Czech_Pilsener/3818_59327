Compared to many of the Czech classics, this lager is sorely lacking. Everything about it is just a little off. Although it is not bad really, the aromas and flavors displayed by this beer are too simple and too straight-forward and the carbonation is far too forceful. There is not a lot of depth, complexity, or subtlety here and the whole package is a bit too unrefined for my liking. Again, it is not really that bad, but it does seem a bit dumbed down compared to the beers it tries to emulate.","mrfrancis","Beers"

3.68,8.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 1/2/2013. Pours slightly hazy golden straw color with a 1 finger dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings down the glass, with plenty of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, cracker, bread, floral, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt, hop, and yeast esters; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, cracker, bread, floral, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, cracker, bread, floral, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance of malt, hop, and yeast ester flavors; with a good bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a nice Czech pilsner. Good balance of malt, hop, and yeast flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jul 06, 2013"

The aroma is light, with noble hops and light malts. The taste has a light dose of noble hops over a light malt base. A wet dog sensation comes through halfway in - it's been a while since I've had a macro-styled beer so it's almost novel. The mouthfeel is light and crisp, and the drinkability is great. It's a pretty much pitch perfect take on the Euro Lager style, but more drinkable and flavorful. I like it.","shand","Feb 05, 2013"

Noble hops and not a whole lot else on the nose. Smell reminds me of big green bottle euro beers, and while it is a scent I personally don't mind, it still isn't really what I want or expect out of what should, by all accounts, be a fresh pils. Hop bitterness is there for taste and that's great, but what this beer really needs is to dry out on the finish; it is tasty but too sweet for what it is. It is fine through the mouthfeel in a sort of oh-hello-didn't-notice-you kind of way. It isn't thin or undercarbornated or viscous or anything, but it doesn't really perk up the tongue like some pilseners I've had. All in all, this is a tasty, drinkable, refreshing beer, but it does more to stand behind than in front of comparable brews. Not bad, but not great, has some flaws, but the overall balance keeps this as an average beer.

Pours a pale fizzy yellow hue with a large white head, fine even speckled lacing is left behind with eadh sip. A slight haze appears in the extremely pale yellow golden body, that fits well to the style. Label says it's brewed with two varieties of hops and two varieites of malts, so it's a pretty basic pilsner. Aroma has pale biscuit malt with upfront hints of herbal/herbaceous hop content. Citrus notes of lemon and lime also jump out within the hop profile. Flavors, come of crisp with ample bitterness upfront biscuit malt sweetness with more than enough hops thrown in to leave their mark finish nice and dry with citric herbal notes and a touch of Euro pils skunk character, but not bad compared to most of the green bottled versions out there. Mouthfeel is light bodied finishes dry and crisp with each sip, leaves a nice lingering bitterness but is balanced between sips as well. Not abrasive just a well made Southern Tier pilz, not like their original pilsner they used to bottle I used to love that beer. This one has an A with a circle around it a Craft Revolution!, and a Punk Rock Skull...did I mention the color scheme is black, gray, pink, white and pink.

Pilsner assertive with pilsner malt and minimal hop evasion. Very light earthy arraingement under the pilsner malt. Finishes very clean and the body is light. Carb is kinda lacking in this department, not as crisp as actual German styles. Clean tasting beer though, glad I found this fresh. Drinkable for one or two, but why would Southern Tier put this out as a seasonal in the dead of winter? It does stand out from everything else on the shelf this time of year, and Eurotrash will be able to avoid the rat race of 100 different pilsners on the shelf in summertime. Hopefully this sells.

3.82,12.7,3,3.5,4,3,4.5,"Took a tour of the brewery last saturday and this beer was served directly out of the fermenter. I was amazed at the clean,fresh, citrus flavor. I am a huge fan of the Imperial Stouts and my wife drinks Michelob Ultra, but, we both agreed this was a very nice beer to drink and we look forward to having it out on the market.","sniper061","Jul 15, 2011"
3.08,-9.1,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"Pours a clear light straw, small white head forms and recedes to nothing, no lace. Light aroma, grainy mostly with a hint of flowery noble hops. In the flavor, more grainy flavor, pale malt, very mild bitterness and almost no hop profile. Mouthfeel is good, crisp carbonation, a bit of a grainy bite. Overall, this is a very average pils.","Stinkypuss","Jul 09, 2011"

3.83,13,3.5,3,4,4,4.5,"Growler from Village Beer Merchant. Terrribly named, this was a great summer beer and kept its carbonation overnight, excellent drinakbility I was able to finish 80% of it myself and it went well with a weekend of meals. Generous retained head, a nice moderate bitterness. Smooth mouthfeel. Really good for what it is.","Sammy","Sep 12, 2010"
3.41,0.6,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a clean pale yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, just like the name, just like a Euro pils. In the taste, a small Saaz hop and a clean standard pils taste. A small bite and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry and clean aftertaste. A clean European pils, nothing exciting, but clean and fresh.","OWSLEY069","Sep 09, 2010"

3.46,2.1,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"The mouthfeel is light and carbonation is moderate. Drinkability is decent, it's an easy drinking lighter beer. It was consistent with the style, but not something that really stood out within the style. Overall a drinkable beer but nothing to it that really stands out. It served it's purpose on this hot day though.","billab914","Beers"

3.37,-0.6,4.5,2.5,3.5,4,3.5,"D: This one was just not quite there for me. It did get better as the pint went on but it was just a touch off. It was an easy drinker but the nose really did hurt it a little bit.","aerozeppl","0"
