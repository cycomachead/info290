"Pours a hazy deep straw producing 2 fingers of foamy, clumpy, somewhat lasting, white head that leaves webby sheets of  lace. Aroma is crisp & dry, pilsner malts, biscuit & cracker, lemon/orange & grassy hops. There is something in the aroma that is reminiscent of beaten egg whites/meringue. Taste is a more vibrant version of the the nose: pilsner malt, cracker/biscuit with lemony & grassy hops with bitterness & dryness developing in the mid-sip & intensifying through the finish & aftertaste where it lingers as a heavy & bitterness & astringency. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with moderate carbonation, dry, crisp, astringent & lightly prickly."

"Very good Beer. Just the right amount of Hops and citrus flavor. Slight pine needle scent but acceptable.. I really like this beer!"

"there are several widely available domestic pils I would choose over this, such as Victory."
""
"A solid Pils with just a bit of non-traditional hop hints outside of the normal Saaz barrage. Good but doesn't stack up with the greats in terms of lager yeast and hop bite."

"O - This was very enjoyable.  But I would have preferred a stronger malt presence to give it more body and balance."

"Overall: Decent pilsner. There are better crafty pilsners on the market - MOAT's comes to mind, as does Narragansett's Bohemian - but it has flavor and appropriate body. A good companion for tacos or pizza. Sneak this to your annoying Coors Light-swilling buddy and then make fun of them for drinking organic beer."

"Pours a clear golden body with a big white head with good retention and lacing. Aromas are big on freshly cut grass with heaps and heaps of fresh Meyer lemons. Flavors have an initial honey Graham cracker sweetness before the green grassy taste blended with lemon peel dominates the middle and the finish. I'd like a Pilsner that isn't shy about its taste. This is a wonderful summer beer."

"White bubbly head with a pale straw body that is hazy and very unfiltered looking.hop aroma is strong with citrus and grapefruit and some herbal notes. Taste is lightly bitter with crisp bite that fades to an ultra clean finish. Best beer from this brewey hands down."
""
""
"This is a very good beer.  It poured the hazy pale yellow with white head that is leaving some lace. The scent carries a gin like flare with touches of mild pine and hints of citrus.  The taste has a great Czech pils base with a neat pine/gin twang.  The mouthfeel is m3edium in body with good carbonation.  Overall I am really enjoying this beer."

"Pours a cloudy, straw gold...  very light, with a wispy head of about one finger of foam - leaves a few strands of lace.  Musty tropical fruit on the nose, as well as citrus and light malt sweetness.  Taste is pretty hoppy without much malt back-up; citrus rind; light resin; a touch chalky...  pretty bitter, actually.  Light mouthfeel and high carbonation - pilsnery.  Not a bad summer beer, I guess."

"O: really enjoyable; thirst quenching;"
"O – This is a very crisp, fresh-tasting beer, and I think an excellent example of a GERMAN-style pilsner, but highly Americanized. The bitterness is very assertive, and I think this would pair well with a lot of flavorful, richer, or spicy foods. No something I’d drink a lot of on its own, but I have no complaints."

"O-not a subtle pilsner, more of an over hopped blonde ale. Tastes good but not real accurate of the style"

"Overall: This was an extremely impressive pilsner style beer, and one that really shines in the hot summer weather. Very refreshing overall experience, along with a nice cloudy pale citrus colored appearance. I am very much a hoppy IPA guy, but this is a GREAT BEER, very impressed."

"O: Not your average pilsener. The hop profile is fantastic. Great session beer."
"O: Wow. This one blew me away a little bit. Was not expecting so much hop goodness here and was pleasantly surprised to find how well it worked since it makes itself quite known but finishes very balanced. This is my third brew from this wonderful brewery and I must say they are quickly becoming one of my favorites. In terms of pilsners, Pilsener Urquell has always been the benchmark brew for me, and this one satisfies the cream corn and hopiness of the former while adding a decisively American fresh hop characteristic all of it's own to balance out the mix. I would not hesitate to seek this one out whenever I'm in the need of a good pilsener, and I will now pay close attention to what this brewery releases. Cheers!"

"The flavor is far stronger than the smell indicates. Starts with a soft pale malt taste with no graininess. The hop comes on very strong and quickly. More neutral bitter than anything else. Borderline harsh, certainly too much for a pilsner. Full bodied for the style but not too rich. Good carbonation."

"i will buy this whenever i am in the area of the one store where i have seen it. at 8 bucks per six pack, its an absolute steal!"
"Now I just wish they'd package this in a 12 pack for $16 or so to save me buying a 6pk for $10 every time."

"O-I would consider this an India Pale Lager. I would also consider this a goddamn delicious beer. Peak's best by far. I will go hunting for this sneaky bastard very soon. The ease of a Pilsner with the hop bite of an IPA; sign me up for that any time."
"The color is a dull straw gold, semi-opaque, with a good foamy white head and some lacing. A bubble here and there. Very, very weed-like scent. Strong and lovely."

"The beer pours a pale yellow with a huge head of egg-shell white bubbles. The head mellows to a rocky terrain and sits approximately a finger’s width above the glass. As the head fades, it leaves fluffy, string-clouds of lacing. In body, the beer is clean and clear, except for a slight haze that clouds the other side of the glass. Constant streams of tiny bubbles can also be seen feeding the aggressive head of the beer. On the nose, the beer smells superbly hoppy, moving from fresh cut grass (hence the name) to juicy citrus, lemon peel, and even a ghost of herbal mint. On the tongue, the beer tastes decidedly bitter up front with a nice, mellowing, bready sweetness moving in with the middle and finish of the sip, though not balancing out the beer. The bitters taste decidedly grassy, with only hints of citrus coming through. Acidity is light in the mouth, but does give the beer a faint pop, as well. In flavor, the beer begins as bitter, fresh cut grass and pine, this moves into brief grapefruit before the crackery malt flavors start to balance out the sip. The finish is of bitter grass, grapefruit pith, and just a touch of salinity. In the mouth, the beer feels on the heavy side of light in body, with a smooth and creamy carbonation, definite effervescence, and a mouthfeel that is crisp, smooth, and slightly prickly. The mouth is left dry and astringent once the beer has left. Overall, this is an aggressively bitter beer, which I both appreciate and wish for a little less of. They captured the flavor of fresh cut grass rather well, but the astringency is a little too high, and the pilsner malt character is a little too light for my taste in the style. This is a good hoppy pilsner that should appease many a hophead, but as far as the style goes, it is a bit unbalanced."

"Overall, I really enjoy this spring release. More complex than some of the traditional offerings in this style, courtesy of the dry hop process. But in spite of that it remains true to the crisp and clean pilsner style. Highly recommended."

"O: This beer tasted a lot more like an ale than a lager and seemed like a hoppier version of an APA. It's not a bad choice if you like hops and want something that's lighter in body, but I found it unusual that it had lots of crispness for a lager, which seems unusual compared to some of the Imperial Pale Lagers that I've tried."

"Overall meh, nothing special, but then again I don't expect much from Peak Organic, so perhaps it's more on the ""good"" side for a beer from them, a big hop presence that starts nice, but gets too lemony and astringent, decent malt just wish there was more of it, but too much carbonation, and that lemon astringent character is too much."
""
"Overall a very well made and tasty pils."
"O - Very good pils, lots of fresh flavor like its name proceeds it to be."

"O: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, it’s a solid beer but there are better options in the style."
"I assume this is what they were aiming for though, with a name like ""Fresh Cut."" Hop heads who want a hop-forward low abv beer that's crisper than an IPA will love it. Pilsner fans will not."

"O: A nice, hoppy pilsner. Easy to drink and quite affordable. Give it a go if you're into the style or lagers in general"
"Simply put, delicious! There is a smooth light malt to back up a grassy, slightly skunky hop and yeast aroma. Frothy white head that fades to a nice sticky lace that lasts and lasts. Clean bitterness, a little bit of spice in there. Completely and utterly drinkable and refreshing on a cool sunny summer day."

"This is going to be my ""always have a sixer in the fridge"" beer for a long time."

"Overall: A delicious dry hopped pilsner. Tasty, chewy, and delicious. Only 3 weeks old and very fresh. Not traditional to dry hop a pilsner, but this one is here to stay folks."
