Light bodied with nice carbonation. A very light version of a pilsner lager with all the flavors dialed down.

The aroma is subtle but pleasant, with a characteristic musty noble hope character over a light, toasted bready sweetness. The flavor is likewise muted but mostly enjoyable, with a duller but still present hop profile and a more biscuity malt characteristic.

Pours light amber, with moderate carbonation and a half-inch off-white head that deposits a few threads of lacing. Floral hops and light malt (or perhaps corn) in the nose blend with traces of sulfur and diacetyl. Tastes toasted and biscuity, soft, sweet (corn?), with floral/spicy hops, mild bitterness, and some lagery yeast notes on top of a fairly carbonated, light body that has a medium finish. Not really a pilsner, but keep in mind the label doesn't declare it to be one. It does, however, call it Bohemian, but I feel this tastes less Czech and more like an American lager, perhaps even a pre-Prohibition one. A good amount of brews back then were moderately hopped, labeled Bohemian, and the use of corn would not have been out of place at all.

The taste holds notes of flowers, very light honey, watered-down caramel, wheat, and corn. There's a fake-feeling sweetness to everything. The body is light, with a light moderate carbonation and a wet feel.

The nose is clean and malty/grainy (just slightly toasty), with a hint of sweetness and some lightly spicy and leafy & floral hops sprinkled here and there. The same is pretty much true for the flavor, with the addition of a stiff bitterness to back the firm maltiness. It's well rounded, and very nicely balanced.

Some crackery malt flavor, it finishes dry and crisp with a slight hop bite. There was a little corn husk element too, and gassy carbonation.
