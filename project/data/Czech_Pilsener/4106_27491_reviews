"Overall- Nota bad beer but I have had better Czech beers"

"Review according to BJCP2008 guidelines (style 2B). Bottle 33cl - Batch unknown. AROMA: malt background with faint herbal hop aroma. APPEARANCE: golden yellow color and very clear. thin head with medium-low retention. TASTE: malty sweet balanced with some bitterness that does not linger. very faint hop flavours. finishes a bit dry. no esters. PALATE: medium-light body with medium carbonation. OVERALL: a sub-par czech pilsner. should have more hop character."
""
"Pours to a patchy but lasting head that laces generously. Dark golden color. Aroma is fresh sweet malts and honeylike floral and spicy hops: 100% Zatec (Saaz) according to label. Flavor comes in with a blend of sweet, clean malt and a spicy, tangy and crisp bitterness. Mouthfeel is light yet substantial. Overall, a very good Bohemian Pilsner."

"O - Nothing outstanding, but it's a good pilsener. One of the more unique pilsener's I've tried, considering the light fruity flavors. Light and crisp but plenty of flavor. Again, not outstanding, but a good pilsener."

"Poured this Czech style Pilsener from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This Pilsener poured a clear golden color, produced an average white head and featured below average retention and left very little lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted off fresh baked bread, and grassy hops. Medium in body, this Pilsener had a base of malted husky malted grain, touch of lemon citrus, white pepper and bitter hops. Decent example of a Czech Pilsener, I believe this to be pretty authentic. Prost!"

"O- this one is clean and drinkable, nothing special but not bad."
"Zatec comes up short when compared with other commercially available Czech Pilsners. But it is a delicious beer that I have bought before and will buy again."
"Nothing to write home about. More or less a session beer as far as I'm concerned. Better than American macros, but only by a bit. Not bad, merely average."
"Overall-Great sessionable beer for anytime. Great with any type of food. The Czech's know what they are doing."

"one of the classic czech pilseners. pours clear pale golden color with a one inch white head that is gone instantly. smells meadowy, floral and grassy, malt driven but balanced. flavor really features the czech malts, they are light and grainy, very pleasant in all seasons. some mild hops on the finish, which is very crisp and dry as can be. mouthfeel is good for what it is, obviously very light on the body, but still with plenty of flavor, excellent carbonation. overall this is a nicely balanced and very drinkable pils, exemplary of the czech style, and usually widely available at a reasonable price."
"Overall, this is what a beer should taste like. This is clean, refreshing, and to borrow a phrase from Amstel Light, ""it tastes like beer."" I wish this was available in 12 packs where i am, because I could session this every summer weekend. Highly impressed."

"O -- Overall, I think this is an old bottle. I certainly didn't have a gusher on the first one I tried a few years ago (I would have never been looking for it again) and the resiny hop character is not very smooth. No freshness dating to be found on the labels."
""
""
"I don't normally drink czech pilsners. This seems like a really good example of one. This is a far better option than Pilsner Urquel."
"overall - much better than expected, my first Czech Pilsener."
"While my score tends to say this isn't anything special, there are no issues either. I tend to think that with the lighter Czech beers I have yet to have a beer that blows the others away. I've had German pale beers that have, so I'm going to have to hunt for a Czech one...Kout perhaps?"
"Out of a bottle this Czech Pilsner was a clear, 24k gold color, just as it should be. The white was only a thin layer but the retention was good and the lacing in fishnets that lasted all the way down my glass. The aroma was of Saaz hops, crystal malt and a bit of sweet malt. The flavors were clean and crisp, though not overwhelming. I tasted the pleasant Pilsner malts, bready grains and some lemon grass and herbal notes from the Saaz hops. Nothing was big about this beer it was well-balanced. The mouthfeel was smooth but slick, the body medium and the carbonation light. Very pleasant albeit non-distinct."

"D: Very easy to drink with the low ABV and light body, but there just not much flavor here. Pretty bland."
"Overall, a pleasant pilsner. Very drinkable."
"Poured a 2"" white head. Clear straw yellow color with slowly lifting bubbles revealing a thick than lager average body. Very light malt smell. Taste too is quite light and although not dramatically different from BMCs it has more richness and is clearly an edge above. There's a decent pleasant bitter hops finish which lasts. Label says they've been brewing since 1004 and I see why they're still going strong."
"D - Very nicely done. One never knows what to expect with unknown beers from Europe, bit this one turned out to be a pleasant surprise. A rich malty aroma turns into a light, grainy flavor profile with more than enough hop character to keep it balanced. Very drinkable and a nice example of the style."
"PROSiT!"
"Poured into a becker a light golden with a thinner wispy white head,alot of tiny bubbles.Sharp herbal hops and metallic aromas,the big hops remind me somewhat of a northern German pilsner,its quite sharp.Flavors again are sharp with herbal hops,lightly toasted and grainy with that hard water/iron-like tinge to it as well.To me this lager is saaz hops on steroids,its almost to brask for my taste....and Iam a hophead!"
"Cheers!!!"
"I can't imagine this is what this is meant to taste like. Something must be wrong with the bottle. Neat cap for my collection, though."
"Overall - I could not enjoy this beer. The taste is fatally flawed by that off flavor."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and is also quite refreshing."
"This beer pours a clear golden color with a finger of white foamy head that leaves some lacing on the way down. The aroma is strong with caramel malt. The taste starts with the caramel sweetness and then becomes slightly bitter and then finishes with more malty sweetness. The mouthfeel is very smooth and crisp. Overall a great beer to have some sausage and kraut with."
"D: I wasn't too impressed by this pilsener. The off-tasting sourness didn't leave me wanting another."
"The palate opens with the complex flavor of pilsner malt - bread, a little dough, a little honey, all very raw and cereal-like. Hops are on the lower end of the spectrum, with a mild lemon and earthy character, rather delicate. Bitterness is medium-light, present mostly in the finish. While light in body, this has a fullness that I've come to expect from the better pilsners out there. However, this finish isn't all together, despite the modest bitterness, this beer does devolve into being a little watery. Carbonation is high, providing a nice, drying, scrubbing finish. While not the best beer of the style, this is still one that I could easily drink half a case of if presented with the opportunity."
"D: Best Czech lager I've had so far. Very drinkable. I would argue a win-win for anybody who enjoys lagers, and especially for a domestic macro drinker."
"D - A bit towards the malty side but fairly balanced and tasty. A nice surprise."
"Easy enough to drink, but lacking the crisp, crackery nature of the better versions of the style, this one would have to rank farther down the imported Bohemian pils chain in my town's finer booze emporiums. Kind of a disappointment, given exactly where this one comes from."
"The beer pours a hazy gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a sweet smelling pilsner malt scent along with a light hop nose and a somewhat dry, clean finish. The taste is decent as well. It has a light, clean tasting flavor that boasts of pilsner malts and not much else. Where are the hops here? It's dry with a bit of malt sweetness and a faint hop character. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an easy drinking beer. I would like some additional hop character, but it drinks well."
"Without a doubt, this is a good beer. For the US consumer, it's a slam dunk if you're looking for a refreshing, clean and tasty Pilsner. A hearty bowl of beef stew would make for a delicious pairing."
"Drinkability: There are better pilseners to be had, but this is worth a bottle or two for fanatics."
"Not a bad beer, but I had higher expectations. I wouldn't estimate this bottle to be at optimum freshness, but I have no way of knowing due to the lack of bottle dating. Much, much better than the ubiquitous puesdo-pilsners, but there are many better, and more affordable, options. Pils are delicate beers and overseas journeys don't do them any favors. I'd love to try this fresh in its native Czech Republic, but in the meantime I'll grab a Prima or Pikeland the next time I need a Pils fix."
"Appears a bright golden transparent straw color, forms a collar of white thick head, tight bubbled nice lacing. Aroma has pale biscuit malts, spicy Saaz hops green grassy herbal qualities...just a very nice smell here. Flavor equally pleasant and quaffable, brngs some glory back to the Czech lagers after the dumbing down of Pilsner Urquell. Nice toasted malts, blended into a biscuit/cracker flavor backed with spicy/herbal noble hops. It's no Victory Prima as far as aggressiveness in terms of bitterness but it's hoppy, definitely a well made Czech pils. Mouthfeel is crisp dry refreshing never falls flat extremely refreshing taste, this is liquid bread and it's light bodied lager. It now makes more since why the Czechs drink more beer per capita than any other nation, solid from beginning to end I hope to find myself a steady fresh supply of this currently served at Giant Eagle Market District in Robinson."
"M&D: clean, crisp, medium-minus bodied - all good, but pasteurisation has somehow taken away the real charm of a Czech lager that could be enjoyed more fully while being served unpasteurised in its homeland."
"The dry finish is of lightly buttered corn. Mouthfeel is light/ light-moderate (3 out of 10) thickness, slightly zingy carbonation. Taste is pretty unremarkable, I guess a bit of caramel and silage."
"A very good pilsner, i really enjoyed this, the exact flavors i expect out of a pils."
"Drinkability is good. Nothing too exciting, but it drinks easily enough."
"Cheers!"
"500ml from Capital Market,Salem Had a horrible pour, head went crazy but after it settled its a golden beer with a slightly off white ,tight bubbly head. Good pils aroma, spicy ,grassy hops with a huge bready malt backing Taste is similar to the nose, very good strong sweet cake maltiness at the start a touch of grassy hops in the end leaving a small bitter aftertaste. Palte is average for style maybe trails off a bit too much in the end.. Over all a pleasant enough pils..would love to taste fresh as i think this bottle was trashed."
"Pours a clear pale golden color with a large white head that quickly settled to a thin cap. Moderate amount of spotty lacing is left on the glass. It is missing the Saaz hop aroma that this style posesses. But it does not smell skunky either. I pick up a lot of bready malt and yeast. Not as hoppy, bitter, and dry as the better Czech Pilseners. Mostly malt flavor upfront with the hop flavor coming in at the finish. Bitterness is low as well. Nothing wrong with the flavor but just a bit ""meh"". Also it is not as crisp and clean as the better pilseners. Light bodied with spirited carbonation. An easy drinker with a low ABV would allow great consumption but I would prefer a different kind of pilsener."
"Na zdraví!"
"D- Good for a nice warm day, but not as good as other Czech Pilseners."
"I was hoping for a bit more crisp hops and a little less malty, sweet body. This is more of a balanced lager, reminiscent of some helles beers from Germany with a bit more saaz as opposed to hallertau or hersbrucker. That said, it still drinks very easy and the flavors are pretty good. Does not taste too old, but I am sure it would be better at the source. I am definitely glad to have tried it, but at 3 bucks a bottle, I cannot see myself getting this one very often."
"d - Very easy to drink with the low ABV and light body, but there isn't much to the smell and taste...just some like wheat and bready malts. Not bad but wouldn't really look to buy again."
"I could down these one after another, washing down a pizza or finishing off some wings. Anything an American lager can do, this can do better. I guess a century of brewing leads to perfection in the style."
"D - Drinkability is good. Goes down easy with no major flaws. A worthy pilsner."
"Overall very refreshing and held up well (this was sitting in the back of the beer fridge for several months before being sampled)."
"Zatec pours a pale yellow with a white head from a brown half liter bottle. The aroma is a bit spicy. The flavor is a bit spicy from hops, but definitely quite malty. This is a nice Czech pils that doesn't seem to be very widely available around here, too bad, I like it better than a lot of the other ones we get."
"This is quite a tasty beer that showcases the Zatec (Saaz hop growing reigon) very well."
"D: A classic Czech Pils in some respects, but sweeter than I would expect. (That said, this is perhaps closer to the standard than the skunky bottles of Pilsner Urquell we can get in the US.) There is, however, a spice note that calls too much attention to itself to make the overall drinkability exceptional. (The spice note does lessen as the beer warms, FWIW.)"
"Pours pale golden with a nice compact bright white head and plenty of carbonation. The head fades quickly but leave a nice protective layer that lasted as long as the beer did. Bready grassy sweet aroma with a bit of fruitiness. The taste is very refreshing with a nice spicy zing from the hops both up front and in the finish. Lots of grassy herbal notes and maybe a touch of citrus. Plenty of biscuity malt sweetness; this beer seems to be a bit light on bitterness for style. The finish is fairly dry with a good clean aftertaste. Light bodied and goes down easy. Not as in your face as a lot of other Pils, maybe a good gateway beer from BMC. This is a great thirst quenching beer and I could down quite a few."
"A fine pilsner with more flavor than most. Both bready malt and noble hop flavors shine in the flavor of this beer. The aroma is fairly nondescript, nothing bad but not much more than a fresh dinner roll malt note. The malt is a bit too simply sweet, but the hops cut right through the sugar. It's a surprisingly big flavor for the abv and style. A pleasant surprise."
"D: Very mild for this style. Zatec is extremely easy to drink, and very sessionable."
"The surprise favorite (by a long shot) of the weekend."
"To sum it up, all I can say is ehh, moderate, middle of the road, etc."
"I've been told there's record of Zatec paying taxes in 1004, so after a thousand years it only makes sense that they could brew a great lager"
"pour of a golden yellow color with not that much head on it. white head without lace. nose is very floral or lavender and pollen... sweet malt honey. palate is not crisp hoppy but is clean and a mild sweet. has that quality of musky straw but not coarse or alkaline. easier to drink that crechvar."
"A quiet Czech Pils that has more malt then most, but I liked it either way and is a solid sessionable brew that stands on its own over most, if not all, macro type lagers or Pils."
"Very average on all levels."
"i have a feeling this is an old bottle. the lack of a date or batch numbering scheme is almost never a good thing."
"Drinkability: highly drinkable, although I think the unbalanced maltiness would get to me after a little while."
"D: Pilsner. Crush it. Drink it all night. Not high enough in alcohol to get you in trouble unless you're a real jackass and tasty enough to drink with enjoyment."
"A bit light/thin/weak for my taste but very fresh and clean tasting."
"Poured into a mug a very nice clean/clear golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, slight hop, fruity. The taste is sweet, malty, slight hop notes, and some nice fruityness. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a very tasty brew, glad to have had a chance to try it."
"Serving type: bottle"
"When pouring this Czech beer, the foam was white with a hint of beigh, bubbly and stuck to the glass. Taste and smell - Had a typical pilsner, hoppy feel. The color was Light pils/ honey. Mouthfeel was light-bodied rich and smooth. Good drinkibility."
"Coppery golden with a soft and foamy pure white head that leaves fine lace on the glass. Smells of grassy, slightly menthol/mint hops with rich grain. Tastes rich and smooth with fresh bready malt and grassy saaz hops. Light bodied and refreshing with nice hop bittering in the finish. A great session beer and way underrated IMO."
"Many others offer greater delights in the fascinating world of Czech Pilsners"
"MF&D - the feel is slightly thicker and heavier than water, and the lack of carbonation makes the beer feel quite dull over all. I would preferably find another beer rather than have another one of these."
"Overall: It is a light beer that to me is kinda skunky. It is easy drinking. The mouthfeel is carbonation, with a sight bitterness at the end. The finish lingers in your mouth but for just a second. Not a great pilsner, just okay"
"Pours a clear darkish yellow color body, big foamy white head, lasting. Strong malty aroma, some balancing hops and dryness present too. Some fresh grain scents. Nutty malty taste, clean tasting. Somewhat grainy, nutty aftertaste. Crisp. Satisfying, and a decent amount of flavor. Very carbonated. Not too shabby. Less flavor as it warms."
"Moderately malty sweet on the palate. Hops rush in to dry things out. Decent balance. Very refreshing. Very drinkable."
"The aroma is like corn malt with some grassy hops. The appearance is pale gold with a foamy head. The flavor is like the aroma with latex. The palate is watery. Overall it's nothing I want again and everything is weak. Make sure you pass this one up."
"D: Surprisingly so. Dunno if they threw some vienna in there but i could go for a few more of these."
"My expectations where met."
"D- Light beer makes for superior drinkability"
"A 500 mL bottle of Zatec. The bottle claims ""Since 1004"". That's a a thousands plus years of experience and sets the bar pretty high for this beer. A clear golden brew with a modest head which quickly receded into nothingness. Decent aroma of grain, grass, and hops: standard pilsner. It opens up nicely as the beer warms. Crisp malt flavor complemented by grassy bitterness from the hops. The beer finishes quick, bitter and dry. This is a drinkable decent brew, but it doesn't live up to the expectations set by knowing the brewery has been in the business for more then a millennium."
"Drinks okay, my advice, let this get to ale temp before drinking. As it was it warmed up quite a bit prior to sampling. Otherwise, you got a a blah, Czech Pils here"
"The taste is light, and crisp, a bit dry and with great sweet-bitter balance, both being a little light but leaing toward the bitter side. It's very tingly, zesty, and lively, with a light herbal, cypressy hop quality before the crisp juniper-toasted bread/grain finish. It is very enjoyable, crisp and very clean, and if not too cold has plenty of malt and hop flavours and subtlety. However, this beer will seem unimpressively bland if drunk too cold. The feel and character are also a little thinner that I think they should be, with a faint wateriness that weakens it a bit."
"Notes: I am not a fan of Lagers. This beer certifies that for me. It is just fine but that is the point...it is just forgettable. Life is too short to drink such uninspiring beers."
"Drinkability- Not great, but not absolutely wretched."
"Pours a clear golden color, nice foam and lacing. Skunky aroma, a bit husky, and decent use of hops. Spicy hop flavor, grainy, husky, lots of cereal flavors. Crisp, fairly easy to drink, but not a fan of the flavor, so wouldn't want too many in a sitting. I've had much better Czech beers."
"overall, i got this because it was on sale, though i can see myself getting this occasionaly its very refreshing"
"Prost!"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Weak and flabby... the miniscule carbonation level never gets interesting, and it reinforces the poor qualities thus far in the tasting. Undrinkable."
"Notes: This is a good solid Czech pilsener. It was very refreshing and enjoyable."
"Honestly, one of the most enjoyable pilseners I've tried in a very very long time, beautiful. I shall be stocking up on many more of these, it's become the ideal session beer for this summer, especially after a long hot day of slinging metal around and welding."
"D: Decent drinkability, a nice flavor overall that was sweet, citrusy making for a moderately good drink."
"Drinkability: Very sessionable, but there are other pilsners I'd choose over this."
"Tasted on 5/14/08."
"D: Very drinkable. Drink away."
"Maybe a little too light, but very refreshing and helped quell my peppercorn pork tenderloin."
"all in all, one of my favorite pilseners ever. love this style.."
"It would be super interesting to taste this baby fresh in the Czech Republic."
"Not a great Czech pils, but passable. Maybe the more aggressive American versions have spoiled me a bit, but this could use just a tad more ""uumph"". Even though, it slides down with ease."
"d - This beer has crazy drinability. This is the first beer that I have had that is light in flavor yet doesn't come with adjuncts. Just pure refreshment. I'm just taking off for the fact that it's fairly expensive at my local store."
"from it also; not a good sign."
"D - A pretty average pilsner for the most part not that thats a bad thing just not anything really different about it could session"
"Prosit, MK"
"Pours nicely with a pretty clear gold tone and a smaller off white head. Nose is of roasted and cooked cereals. Mild sweet tone is also there. A bit, earthy also shall we say. Flavor is, eh...okay. Mild cereal character and a slim fruit aspect don't really hold out for long and it drops out fairly quickly. At least quicker than I would like it to. Still, it is okay enough I suppose. Feel is typical really and not too exciting. Overall this is an okay pilsener. But for the prie? I have to say no."
"Very solid. A little different, fuller than what I expect from the style. I'd buy this again when I'm looking for authentic pilsner beer. When your region is famous for its hops, it's tough to go wrong. It's a must to try this when the bottle is fresh. An old bottle won't do you any favors."
"The taste was pretty nice. Some sweet malt, bread, grain, that put together, placed it on the sweet side but there was some decent hop character to balance out the sweetness and made it pretty darned drinkable. It had a light mouthfeel and it finished fairly crisp and dry. I think this would make a very good beer to session on."
"Mouthfeel was medium/light in body with light carbonation. Smoother than expected for a Czech lager. I didn't sense the Saaz aromas of grainy texture I associate with Saaz hops (a favorite of mine). Maybe this bottle was a little old?"
"Drinkability: An OK pilsner but nothing particularly special; easy to knock back"
"Drinkability: Solid and tasty brew. Simple and satisfying."
"Opinion: This is a pretty darn good beer. I like the malt balance as well as how they have the hops playing such a big role in the aroma and then a supporting role in the whole flavor presentation. This beer definitely has more malt presence than I am used to for this style, and I like that. I think that since the guidelines for this style are broad enough to encompass this beer, I will score it pretty high based on that."
"Very drinkable and closer to the style than most American attempts."
"500 ml brown bottle pours a medium yellow body with an attractive white head. Plenty of patchy lacing left on the glass. Aroma is spicy hops and sweet grainy malts. Light body with a zesty carbonation. Taste features the hops which are spicy and a bit earthy. Grainy and bready malt becomes much too sweet. Hop bitterness returns to rescue the finish and make for a nice drinking pils."
"D: Incredibly drinkable, as far as Pilseners go, which I find to be quite quaffable anyway; I find the flavor profile stands out amongst others of its ilk. Nevertheless, I did enjoy this beer's rather unique composition for a style that was built on replication of perfection. To me, this one stands out, and is worthy of a taste from the seasoned beer veteran to the novice, as I think its characteristics will delight either one."
"darker than gold with a white head that didn't hold that well, but left some nice lace on the glass. nose wasn't as strong as i would have hoped for, but still had a nice malty hoppy thing going on. taste was a lot better than what the nose suggested. nice malt character with a hoppy finish. fuller body than expected as well. not too dry. soft and somewhat silky. really refreshing, and a pleasure to drink."
"pours with a respectable pils head. lacing is damn fine! .. smell is of a fresh picked hop and honey corn flakes ... refreshing drink, good amount of bitters .... Not bad, would love to try fresh on tap! Goes down smooth but there is something just a tad off about it that makes it a good beer and not a great one.."
"The beer decamps the 500ml bottle a clear golden amber with a two-fingered creamy white head, the head settles slowly, leaving a thick sheet to cover the glass. Nose has a dominate malt sweetness, citrus crisp, start has a pleasant malt profile, slight hop bite at the back, top moderate in feel. Finish has modest acidity, the hop delectably spicy, quite dry and a smooth drinking beer, cannot say Pilsners are my favorites, but a good ones like this is always a pleasure to sample."
"A very nice, interesting pils with a little more malt than most!"
"Gold/ honey color. Initial soft barley aroma on the pour that diminishes with subsequent smelling. Thin white creamy head that also diminishes fairly soon. Clean and mildly rich barley flavor with a minty hop finish. The mouth feel is medium bodied - soft. I like this beer and would buy it again, but I do not think it stands even with the Czech all-stars; however it is a cousin to them. Better than a lot of the Czech beer I explored just to find the cheapest beer deal in the Czech Republic."
"Still, a well made beer and worth a shot."
"Pours out a honey color with no bubble action and a thin head that dissipates into a thin ring. Smells of soft floral hops, honey, pale malt and has a graininess. Really disappointing flavor here as it tastes awfully similar to Heineken and its ilk. Really sweet maltiness with a overbearing graininess and faint hop character. Has a bit of a bitter edge to the finish, but overall this is pretty sweet. Mouthfeel is moderate with a relaxed bubbly sensation on the tongue. This is so-so. I was expecting more from a Czech lager, but got something that was quite blah."
"Zatecky Pivovar has a long, storied tradition of brewing. I'm a little skeptical of the 'since 1004' on the label since I've always thought that Brauwerei Weihenstephan is the world's oldest brewery, having started operations in 1040. In any case, Zatec is far from the best Czech pilsener on the planet and isn't worth a purchase as far as I'm concerned."
"really, but not a bad little pils. Worth a try."
"A really nice Czech Pilsener. Poured a crystal clear golden straw from a 500mL bottle. Two finger snow white head shrunk to a finger or finger and a half, but stayed put nonetheless. Streams of CO2 continuously traveled skyward throughout the drink. Smell was a bit grainy and of course, rather strong of lager yeast. Some Saaz detectable. Very average, I would say, neither being offensive nor particularly special. Taste was malty up front with definite Saaz presence on the back end. I felt this was a better than average Czech Pilsener with a nice mouthfeel and subtle, yet enjoyable flavour. I felt in the way Czechs, this was much better than Pilsener Urquell. A definite session lager if that's your thing. Not bad, all things considered."
"It is always a shame when a beer scores so well in appearance and smell but doesn't deliver in the taste department. This is an OK beer but just not a great one. I cold see tasting this again in Europe but there is no reason to get a six pack of this stuff."
"A below average Czech pils. No real flaws, except for blandness."
"D - Not great, but an average Czech Pils. Maybe a little over priced at $3 for a 1pint 0.9oz bottle."
"Great Czech beer in an amber bottle. Classic grainy bitter sweet profile. Bright (like the label says) lager. Nice head with plenty of lace. Very good carbonation. good bittersweet finish too. And a good session beer if this is your style. Clear yellow gold color. Extra clean character."
"Fairly dry, with an almost tartness, though not really. Biscuit like malt and a fresh grain character are accented by a hint of butterscotch. The beer is fairly well carbonated which provides an extra tingle on the tongue and a touch more palate cleansing character. Herbal hop notes evoke thoughts of lemon grass, hints of mint, fresh cut hay, and an almost green basil like thing. A touch of bitterness in the finish, as well as a touch of lemon-like tartness. This is on the dry side for a traditional Czech Pilsner, it seems to be lacking that malt fullness and even the diacetyl is a touch on the lower end. Still this is a decent beer, one which I would happily consume a few pints of."
"A potent, grainy-like scent, but it delivers a nice smooth flavor....not sharp like some pilsners can be, and no bitterness...fresh and easy going. A good summer beer."
"Very easy drinking, light carbonation, with a delicate body. No offensive qualities, clearly a fresh sample. Refreshing on a hot summer night..."
"Overall: A run-of-the-mill lager that does nothing to excite me. Not so bad for the style, but then again, it's not a style I'm into anyway."
"Pours with a dirty gold color and a head that never quite dissipates. Slight aroma of some salty bananas and cooked grains. There's relatively little Saaz character for a beer so named. On the palate, rather bland and inoffensive, with bitter hops kicking things off before things become a bit more rounded with pale malts. Nothing too deep or interesting. Mouthfeel is light, with medium carbonation, with yet again no distinguishing characteristics. Overall, this is a blah beer that has little to recommend it, but little to leave a drinker disgusted. It commits the cardinal sin of being nothing."
"Pleasant and drinkable beer, typical czech pils."
