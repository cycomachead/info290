3.28,-8.1,4,3.5,3,3,3.5,"The beer pours like crisp watery gold, and sits in the mug like light grapefruit juice and piss with a slight ambering. This beer is only slightly hazy and opaque due to it being unfiltered, and has a great torrent of bubbles rushing to the surface to replenish the head which is a pure white, eggshell made of nice little smooth bubbles that settle at about a fingers width and seem like their staying for a drink. The beer smells wet and spicy with a juicy linger of the almost-apple that I’ve come to associate with pilsners. The hops are nicely spicy though, with hints of fluffy, buttered biscuit pulling through in the back and edges of the glass. The beer tastes much like any other pilsner. There is the slightly-stale-bread taste of the malts that runs strongly through the sip and lingers in the mouth for awhile, and there are nice slight spices from the hops and fruity juicy feel reminiscent of apples as the beer initially crosses the tip of the tongue. Mouthfeel is quite tart with a little too much carbonation assaulting the tongue and leaving it tingling with a slight sheen of saliva and dry bread feel in the rest of the mouth. The beer is very crisp and watery, making it very drinkable, and it does not sit heavy in the stomach, but I suspect that the pilsner style is just not my favorite, as I am just not impressed with this beer. Overall I call this beer a meh.","Maxwell","Aug 18, 2012"

Thin covering of white film that leaves a slick coating along the glass. Aromas are light and effervescent, with a floral boquet along the top of a toasted cereal backbone. Flavors are light, with the toasty backbone and a slightly sour malt highlight, with a bitter, resiny hopping to clean it all up nicely. The aftertaste is minimal, with a hint of roast and char.

Fresh-cut crabgrass, wild herbal hop and a dusting of biscuity malt in the nose. Smooth, with a snap of crispness on the backside of the light body. Malt comes forth on the light side with a sticky, biscuity, almost husky flavor throughout. Hops are slightly oily with spicy, herbal undertones; bitterness balances. Biscuity, husky tone lingers. Finish lands dry. Some fine tuning and softening would do this lager great. Hard pressed to put back more than one.","BeerAdvocate","Jul 28, 2011"

After trying the ale and being totally underwhelmed by it, I was prepared for more of same from the pils but was happily surprised. This was not the hop-heavy swipe that I expected but instead was quite tasty and balanced. The aroma is a bit light, but it still emitted a good handful of flowers and a lemon peel or two. Light and flavorful, this is definitely a beer for the summer. I'm not one to drink beer and then operate machinery of any kind, especially the kind with whirring blades, but if I had to choose a lawnmower beer this would rate at the top of the safety list.","gfreed","Apr 20, 2011"
