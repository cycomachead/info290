"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is sweet, malty. Taste is malts, some sweetness, a bit of corn. Feels light in the mouth and overall, a refreshing but mediocre beer."
""
"Aroma is grains and corn. The flavor is grains/malts, corn, light fruit and mostly inoffensive."
"It was ok. Not the best."
"Six pack from 7-11 in the room at Embassy Suites in Grapevine, Texas."
"This stuff even looks cheap in the glass. The coarse bubbles peter out quickly. Sort of sweet and grainy. Not even refreshing, though if you were seriously sweating and gasping from thirst it would be welcome enough. But rated as a Czech Pilsener it's laughable. From the 12 oz bottle with the longest neck I have ever seen."

"Not a fan of pilsners, but it is what it is, not bad but not good either."

"I thought it tasted like egg yolk with a very weird taste and smell. I'll just finish my six pack and never buy this again."

"I had it in mexico, so I cant tell whether I was just on a mexico high, or it was so hot that this tasted better than it probably actually was"
""
"I enjoyed this Czech Pils,  I would grade it higher than most Mexican Imports. It compliments the majority of a Mexican Menu."

"I'm seriously surprised by this beer. Strong, crisp mouthfeel. No skunkyness that one might associate with a typical Mexican beer. In fact, this beer is totally atypical when compared to other Mexican brews. I'm a huge fan of sessionable pilsners and this one is distinctive and absolutely drinkable. A solid beer all around."

"Presentation: Packaged in a custom, enameled, twelve-ounce brown glass long-neck bottle, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."

"Color is a curious mix of light orange, gold, dark yellow and faint brown. No head though, even when pouring fast! The smell nose is oakiness, which is odd. A roasted butterscotch also in the mix. Like most mexican beers, a doughy yeast comes on strong after swirling. Medium-light sweet, medium-light bitter, medium-light sour taste. Lot’s of vanilla maltose, however its not overpowering. A sprinkle of nuttiness and a bit of pizza dough mouthfeel. Quenchable to the thirst."
""
"Overall, slighty better than your average mexican beer."

"Not impressed. Whatever this beer is, I don't think it's very good. Minimal flavor, and what's there isn't great."
""
"In general, this is simply an undercooked pilsner, not that I'm claiming it should be off the spectrum. It is much better tasting than its cousin Pacifico, but it showcases its alcohol proudly where quality beers are more subtle. Not a good beer, but slightly better than the competition (in terms of Mexican pale lagers, not genuine pilsners)."
"Overall - Ugh. Avoid if at all possible."
"O: Not the best Mexican beer, but better than many. Would drink this over Corona/Sol everday of the week."
"Perhaps I've been in Mexico too long and now see corn everywhere, but I am convinced this is an adjunct. Fine if one is looking for volume & ""cold", but certainly not ideal if looking for taste."
"This one will go down as a memory of life since i'll never ask for this one again."
"D: While easy to drink, it is not too enjoyable. I can see this being refreshing on a hot summer day. Nothing special about this beer."
"Note: I think this is only the second time in almost 2,000 reviews that I have five different ratings that none are the same. Bizarre . . ."
"If the world's beer drinkers wanted a better light-bodied, quenching and characterless beer for their patio and poolside drinking, I'd suggest Montejo rather than Grupo Modelo's more famous brand, Corona. For my palate, I find it much more agreeable and much closer to passing for a decent, commonplace beer rather than offensive, chemical-laden water."
"Tasted from a 40 oz bottle. Look: Pale yellow color, poor head of foam; Smell: Soft, dry malts and grain; Taste: Again dry malts and chayote with floral hops; Mouthfeel: Clean and crisp, slightly bitter with a subtly salty finish; Drinkability: I always hated this beer but the last time i drank it was good."
"D: Probably the best of the beers that I had on my trip to Playa Del Carmen, but that's not saying much. It's not a pilsner though, just a light adjunct lager."
""
"Taste: Perhaps a slight metallic taste to it. Has a little bit of a skunky and bitter finish."
"Had this in a small bar in Cozumel. Your typical thin bodied, somewhat grainy Mexican beer without much distinguishing nose or flaveor, and a slightly stale finish. But it was a hot day, the beer was cold, and I was on vacation, so nothing is too bad at that point. Besides, I have never seen this beer in the states, so I got to try something different."
"I prefer bock when it comes to Mexican beers (especially Indio) but Montejo is my favorite lager / pilsner they have south of the border. It's 6% alc. makes it harder as a session beer down here but it's so much better than Corona or even Dos Equis, hopefully they will start exporting it. Try it if you have a chance and enjoy!"
"But bottom line, I had to search out & reached for this quite a few more times than the solidly available Coronas."
"D: Very refreshing for those of you that have a palette for lime and salt add it to this beer its good for what ails you on a hot summer's day."
"As others have noted, I don't see any comparison between this and a pilsener. There just isn't that much there. It was a clear yellow with no head. Not much aroma, maybe a little graininess. A vague, sweet taste. Couldn't find any hops. Refreshing on a hot day, but that's about it."
"Pilsner my ass. For a pils, this is a big underperformer. Like Estrella, it hints at good pilsner qualities, but doesn't go all the way. It is most unoffensive and can wash down food on a hot day. I got mine as a 5 peso upgrade from water with a lunch in Cancun, and I guess it wasn't horrible for 5 pesos. Still, no hops or decent malt profile."
"A bit too fizzy, overly carbonate. Closer to an American macro in mouthfeel. Drinkable, and very enjoyable. Especially for a Mexican lager."
"Excellent for hot days, and with some Cochinita and Pan de Cazón."
"¡Salud!"
"This is a decent example of a malty pilsner. My bottle said 4.5% so maybe theres a new/different recipe. Way better than Corona and worth a try."
"A classic from the southeastern of my country, made originally for in memoriam of the founder of its city Merida Yucatan, Don Francisco de Montejo, with 45 years of rich history, this brand is one of the czech pilsner beers sold in my city, perfect for mexican and american food, serve in a pilsner glass."
"¡Salud!"
"This can be very confusing. If you try it like a Czech Pilsener it would be a common beer, but if you try it like a Lager it would get a better score. Unfotunately, beers here are almost all lagers, and if they are not, they are like adapted to lager fans. IT has a strong taste that tells you it is not a lager."
"Features a white head over clear straw yellow/golden liquid. Light, clean and lemony/grassy malt nose. Taste is a pleasant sharp, slightly metallic hop not and light maltiness, crisp and quite drinkable. Finishes clean, with a late hop ending, not too bad to enjoy actually."
"Consumed in October 2004 in Cancun, Mexico from a bottle. Pours with a nice head which quickly disappears. Maybe a bit of lave. Not much scent to the beer. Corn, maybe a bit of malt. Don't really smell any hops though. You can taste the malt and there are a few actual hops you can taste. Decent carbonation, but still a bit watery like all the rest of the beers in Mexico. Not horrible, but still barely decent. Fortunately I only have about three more I think to review and two of them are at least decent."
"This beer tasted better than it probably was. Why, because it was a beautiful tropical day and I was dying for some kind of beer. Standard straw color, minimal head retention, sparse lacing. Light crisp taste that reeks of corn adjunct. A decent choice for those wishing to avoid Corona."
"Not my first choice of Mexican beers but definately a step up from Corona and a few of the others. At least this beer feels like some creativity went in to making it."
