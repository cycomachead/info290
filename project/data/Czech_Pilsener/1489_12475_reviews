"This beer lacked flavor. It was light"
"I am neutral on this beer."

"Overall: there are better lager / pilsner beers available in this price range. I don't think I'll be bothering with this one again."

"Clear, golden color. Crisp, refreshing with just a slight hint of maltiness. Kind of your run-of-the-mill pilsner. A good beer for a hot summer day."
"nice pilsner."
"Very light to drink, not a bad initial impression, somewhat sweet and hoppy but finishes with notes of bitterness. Overall not bad, especially at 16.9 ounces, but not something I'd personally go running back to."
"I certainly don't expect an imported lager to have the same freshness as it does in its home country. That said, I was very surprise with what I got out of Krušovice Imperial. I'll be returning to this Czech beer, but I guarantee that it will be within seven years."

"This is a nice beer in its look and aroma. It is unfortunate that although it started well it finished rather harshly which really unbalanced the beer and sullied what was a very promising Czech Pilsner."
"Poured from a brown 16.9 oz. bottle. Has a rich golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is grassy, malty, some sweetness. Taste is crisp, grassy hops, some malts, a bit dry at the finish, not quite as flavorful as the smell would have indicated. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."

"Price Point - $2.50/16.9 oz bottle"
"Pours a clear golden orange with a foamy beige head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of intense skunk that eventually dissipates somewhat, malt, grain, and grass aromas. Taste is much the same with grain and grass flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is drinkable, but the initial skunk aroma coming from the bottle is quite potent and never quite goes away."
"O: Very good in every category except the one that truly counts; taste! Looks great, smells great, feels great, tastes...I don't know how to describe it. It's like an astringent plastic. Bad bottle, maybe? Everything else was so good."

"A decent representation of the style, but I imagine that this bottle being 6 months old has caused it to lose some of hop qualities."

"Krušovice doesn't break any new ground for the style yet is certainly quite drinkable and solid representation of the style."

"The beer poured clear, darker amber/golden color that produced a big, slightly off white head that faded quickly into thin cap. The beer gave off a nice lager aroma, sweet malt and yeast. The taste of the beer was malty sweet as well, but also had a syrup quality to it, which was very unexpected. This contributed to the lesser feel rating. With that said, the beer was still rather smooth. I really wanted to like this beer. Maybe it just didn't travel well or maybe it was old. I am willing to give this one another shot as I am really into the style."
"O: Not very tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, there are definitely other beers in the style that I would pick first."

"conclusion: full bodied brew with a 'earthy-crunchy' taste - lacks a bit of fruity notes (for my own taste)"
""

"Overall: Honestly I am impressed, poruing it into my glass i was just thinking ehh ""this is going to be okay"" and to my surprise ""YUM!"". For around two bucks a bottle at your local beer spot, you got yourself a winner. Salud!"

"Golden colour, clear, decent sized head, retained some lacing. Aroma was red cabbage and vanilla, this is what I always detect from Czech beers brewed with the Saaz hop. Taste was fairly malt forward, not much bitterness, notes of paint, slightly grainy finish. Well carbonated, smooth but would have prefered a lighter body. Easily to identify as a Czech Pils, lacking something through."
""
""
"This pours a clear golden yellow color with a fizzy white head. The scent is sweet and malty with little hints of citrus added. The taste is sweet and grainy. The texture is smooth and light but could use some improvement. It finishes a little chewy and chalky. This is an overall average Czech Pilsner."

"This is a pretty beer, but largely unremarkable! I was expected something refreshing! But, this is no Budweiser Budvar! Furthermore, I had heard this was better on tap! But, I won't be seeking this out."
"original review on: 08-26-2010"
"500ml bottle. Pokal glass. Enjoyed several times since 2005. Deep golden color. White, small size bubbled froth. Close & lasting crown. Lacing rings on sides. Sweet mildy malt aroma, sulphur hints. Gentle bitter upfront. Malty palate. Slightly peppery in the middle, subtle astringency. Dry hoppy finish.Light body, soft carbonation."

"O - Decent pilsner at a great price. Highly drinkable."

"O: Another refreshing pilsner. Better than some I've had (recently)."

"Overall: This beer brings back memories of Prague/Praha and my time spent in Banska Bystrica. Now wish I could go back this winter for some snowboarding and apres board. There were was much better across the pond and the scenery and the culture made it exceptionally better. Wish I could find this beer more often."

"A well balanced brew, perhaps a bit too smooth."
""
"The classic label design leads you to believe that they know what they're doing and the bottle has gold foil covering the neck, the 'kiss your pinched fingers' final touch that lets you know that these guys have a lot of pride in their product. The labels says this brewery has been at it since the 1500's so they've had plenty of time to tweak their recipe and get it just right. And I believe they've done just that."
"Brought a can of Krusovice Imperial home from a recent trip to Europe. The beer was golden cleal with foamy white head to start, which then faded. There was some initial lacing but eventually that ceased as well. The smell was malt and maybe a hint of some czech hops. The taste begins with a smooth malt taste that just stays throughout the whole taste. Mouthfeel was good had nice carbonation and was medium bodied....smooth. Overall was a good beer and would recommend it."
"O: I really enjoyed this beer and probably had about 24 of these during my trip. Definitely a worth beer to try out."
"O: Sweet and grainy. Not really my cup of tea."
"Notes: This one is very good and well rounded a good one to pick up. Cheers."
"Overall: Nice balanced pilsner, like the vanilla in the smell"
"This beer pours a dark golden color with a hefty cap of foam. The aroma is doughy malt with a touch of grassy hops. On the palate the flavor is sweet while still managing some husky grain. A little bitterness at the end. Smoother than some other beers that I have had from eastern Europe."
"I run a bar and I brought this beer in before ever having it. This was defintily one of the best czech pils I have ever had. Very crisp and clean with nice carbonation. If you want to taste a great beer definitly pick this one up. Was able to buy this bottle individualy for $1.25 a bottle and its worth every penny and more."
"Overall, this is a refreshing and inoffensive beer. Nothing that stands out, but that's what makes it drinkable."
"Overall: If Imperial ever meant something it was this light alcoholic beer that contains a ton of character and flavor. I would feel fine enjoying this beer with a nice heavy dinner in which I needed a full flavored beer to wash down my meal."
"Had this shortly after sampling Golden Pheasant, but this is a notch hoppier. The herbal lemon is a stronger and and it also has a more pleasant balance of malt to hops. The barley bring a toasty caramel while there's a hint of herbal licorice. The hoppy finish has a lemon juice and pepper character that's dry but satisfying."
"Pours a deep golden color, almost copper, with large, thick head. Aroma is pretty weak but mostly sweet malts with a little hay and grassy hoppiness evident. Taste is sweet up front, almost candy-like, followed up by a strong grassy hop flavor with a light but pleasant bitter finish. The palate is a strong point of this beer - light to medium bodied with a slighty oily texture, there is also a fine carbonation giving it a soft mouthfeel. A very good representative of the style."
"D: This is a very drinkable, light and refreshing pilsener, but it really offers nothing spectacular and comes off a bit dull."
"Future outlook: Don't know where this brew came from....nothing spectacular, but a pleasant, simple, easy drinking brew that would do well on a sweltering day. No matter, glad to have tried, but not compelling enough for seeking out."
"not bad for the price only 3$ here in Alberta worth a try for sure a decent representation of the style"
"Drinkability: I went into this with fairly low expectations and found myself pleasantly surprised. Flavorful and well balanced, while not my favorite style, this a solid beer."
"It may have helped trying this one on tap in Germany, but the bottle serving version is not far behind, as I tried a case worth of that serving type also."
"Poured a light gold with a 2"" head which settled down to usta trace. The taste was comparable to American Pilsner's but with just a little bit more of everything. There's a tiny bit of hops, some sweet malt, and the grains come across more like a rye with an aftertaste. Better than the masses, but just barely."
"Drinkability: light and tasty, it is quite drinkable; as a Pilsner should be."
"Drinkability- could drink quite a few of these in a sitting. Great in a bottle, but better on draft. I have only seen it on draft in the Czech Republic, but maybe some pub carries it here in the states."
"pours a clear, pale golden-yellow with a big (almost 3 fingers) puffy white head with moderate retention and decent lacing. nose is mild, mostly consisting of a grainy/malty aroma with some hops swirling about as well. more of the same in its flavor, with a decided but not overwhelming bitterness to it. crisp, light-bodied mouthfeel. could easily do a few of these. overall, nothing to go wild for, but a nice, unobtrusive pilsner... reviewing with style in mind."
"Overall-not a great beer, inoffensive at best. Once the novelty wears off there isn't much left."
"If this was what the typical BMC was, we'd be better off for it."
"Bottled on 04/15/2010. Pretty damn fresh for an European import. Pours a clear pale golden color with a solid one inch of dense head. The head has very good retention before settling to a thick cap. Heavy lacing is left on the glass. Pretty damn impressive looking for a pilsener. The aroma has more going for it than a Saaz hop smell. Definately pick up on a sweeter malt bill than others of the style. The hops also smell fresh rather than skunky. Definately benefits from being fresh. The flavor starts dry and bitter but finishes from a slightly sweet note. Plenty of hop flavor in this one. The Saaz are nicely featured. The body is light and crisp. Dry without some relief from a touch of sweet. I do not know what the other reviewers were drinking, but this is a fine example of a pils. Definatley will pick it up again."
"(D)- A good pilsener for the style. Normally, I do not reach for anything in this style, but this one is pretty good when considering the style it is. Crisp and refreshing. I could drink a few of these no problem."
"I'm surprised this beer got so many average to below average ratings on here, that just doesnt do justice to it. To be honest I tried it a few years back and wasnt too pleased with it at that time but I gave it another shot last week and was very impressed with how flavourful it was. Maybe they improved it lately or maybe I just had a fresh bottle? Anyways this time around this stuff was damn good. Plenty of hop flavour of the saaz variety I think and accompanied by a decent malty character as well. I dont remember it being this hoppy before. The level of bitterness is just right though- strong but not too overpowering. Full flavoured but drinkable. It produced a substantial head too that lingered til the last drop and had a full aroma of hops. Those Czechs know what they're doing when it comes to beer making I'll tell ya. Right up there with the Germans. I'll defintely be partaking in some more of this in the near future hehe. One of the best Euro lagers I've had in a while."
"High drinkability which flows down easy, but the flavor's so basic that it's almost too boring to drink all night. Not good, not bad, just a decent basic beer."
"Sinkability - This was a notch below blah."
"D: Eminently drinkable. It might not be boutique enough for beer snobs but it tastes like a Czech beer should. Complex enough to drink with meat dishes yet light enough for just sitting around on the couch watching a ball game. Might be my new staple."
"D: The beer is rather refreshing and easy to drink. I'm not sure if I would call it sessionable, because the taste was a bit bland and could not keep my interest for more than one."
"Refreshing enough but nothing mind blowing."
"Appearance pours a nice golden amber with a thick lasting head leaving a fair lace. Smell and taste of earthy grains, light honey and saaz hops. Mouthfeel has good body and carbonation. I've had better pilseners, but its not bad, just a little tinny for me."
"I like the ingredients label... Water, malt, hops. I bought the 1 Pint .9 ounce bottle for $2.49. It says Born by date (I think they mean born on date) was eight months ago. Nice clear golden straw yellow color with a massive head. As the head retreats it leaves its foam stuck to the side of the glass. Smells just as beer was intended to smell... Meaning, crisp sweet malty clean pure beer. Outstanding flavor. Sweet and malty at first followed by a mild aftertaste of bittering hops. The taste mimicks the aroma almost exactly. Slippery sweet film is left on the teeth. Slight creamy texture with the right carbonation. Very easy to drink. The Czechs do it right."
"Pours a lovely Golden straw color with a decent white head that has good retention. Lacing is somewhat poor, but the nice little bubbles trailing up my tall pilsener glass keep me entertained. It gives off the aroma of soft floral hops and bready malt. This is a very clean smelling brew. Taste is nicely balanced with soft herbal, sweetly grassy and flowery hop flavor mingling with white bread malt sweetness. Firm bitterness, but lacking some of the spice and zing of other Czech pils. The finish is dry and fairly clean with just enough sweetness. This is a light bodied and very quaffable beer. Not the best example of the style but quite tasty."
"Not bad for a $2 bottle of beer but not up to par with what I enjoy."
"D - The thick, rich malt character is excellent and the spicy hops are spot on as well, especially in the aroma. The balance of honey and smooth bitterness in the finish is exactly what one expects from a Czech pilsner. There is a little sulphur aroma from the yeast, which may be technically acceptable, but I would still prefer the beer without it. I'm sure that this beer has lost a little of its character during its long trip from central Europe to the shelves of my local beer store, but it is still in pretty good shape and I can't find too much to complain about here. This is a nice change of pace from the intense stouts and IPAs that I, like most BAs, often focus on."
"Overall, a decent brew, nothing spectacular, but it gets the job done. I'd recommend this as a step above Heineken or other Euro pale lagers. Would go very well in the cooler at your next summer barbecue. I'll be drinking this one again."
"Very drinkable czech pils."
"All in all, meh. I've had much better pilsners."
"A drinkable rather well balanced pilsner."
"The body was typical for the style, clean, smooth and crisp. Drinkability was very good, you would want to, and could have several of these brews easily. Overall, a solid example of the style. Worth trying if you see it."
"D- Nothing offensive. It taste like a macro beer. Meant to be swilled not enjoyed. Its easy to drink, just nothing special."
"This beer is very good!!! This beer really took me by surprise. It is light, as a good Pilsner. A real Staple in Pilsner beer, probably as good as Pilsner Urquell. I thought this beer was really good. It was very thin, but good. The taste was very good as well with hints of citrus and is semi bitter."
"D: A descent Czech Pilsener, it goes down smoothly, but there are better ones out there."
"Not really, putting this one to bed."
"Taste: Biscuit. Lemony and grassy hops leave you with an appropriate level of bitterness."
"Bottle sample thanks to Milos- A medium deep and clear gold with a fizzy bleached white cap. Nose of grassy hops, saaz, lemon, fruity pale malts. Tastes quite hoppy and grassy, a bit floral, lemon and biscuit follow. Very clean tasting with a pleasant bitterness that lingers. A good session beer. Thanks Milos!"
"Seemed better on tap in Prague. In my dining room it was just another beer for me to review and try as I did, no redeeming features came to its rescue, this is a bog standard pilsner!"
"Clean and sweet lager nose with some light grainy malts and a bit of breadiness. Notable noble hop nose, clean and grassy. Fairly dry in flavor and with a light hop bitterness that balances well with a moderate malt backbone. Solid feel and drink, nice example of the style that doesn't overwhelm."
"Pilseners are simple but amazing beers, this one is average I think in this category."
"d - the first few sips of this baby were truly impressive, but it mediocre'd out by the end. Nice but not challenging. No obvious flaws but not inspiring either."
"Bright amber in color with a bubbly head that audibly fizzes as it dissipates. A steady line of bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass adds appeal, too. The aroma is a tad fruity but mostly grainy; some grass as well. Nice taste-- lemons, grass and somewhat malty with a decent dose of hops at the back, but not really very bitter at all. Mild carbonation and a low ABV make this easy to drink. So does the price: about $2 a bottle! Worth gathering a few for the fridge."
"The beer pours a solid gold color with OK head retention and minimal lacing. I don't get a lot on the nose, just some light honey and pepper. Flavors on the palate generally replicate the nose, with the beer having a light hoppy bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel was light to medium bodied, but there was nothing watery about the beer. Drinkability was pretty good, and this low alcohol pilsner/lager was exactly what I was in the mood for on a warm, muggy day in Baltimore."
"Notes: Pleasant surprise, glad that I took the relative chance and had this one."
"Overall: finishes as it starts, rather predicatbly but not awfully, while avoiding the butt some pilsners in green bottles will peddle..."
"Very drinkable."
"light to medium body, smooth overall w faint resins in finish. crisp, not too fizzy carbonation, giving further body."
"Had it on tap on a hot day at a local Restaurant in Salem MA. At best I can say it was pretty average. It certainly wasn't the worst beer in the world I've ever had, but it wasn't that good either. It was a lot more Pale than I expected especially to use the term Imperial. It did not have a strong aroma, you could smell some hop notes to it. I was very disappointed with the overall flavor, again because they use the term Imperial. I found it very bland. Like I said it was a hot day and it was a cold beer so it was was refreshing enough for me to consider the mouth feel and drinkablility to be average."
"Not a bad tasting pilsener... it just wasn't very interesting."
"D: Not my cup of tea, but not too bad for a pils. PS. thanks mom for this surprise grab bag beer."
"It's a decent beer. Has strong metallic element similar to what I remember a Heineken tasting like, but much better. Would recommend trying out."
"D: A very pleasant surprise. Easily the best Czech pilsner I've ever had. In fact, I'd put it in the same league as the better German lagers."
"Decent beer. Poured with a medium sized white head that soon disappears and a tiny bit of lace. Color is a bright, very clear, yellow gold. Aromatics of hops, malt, a little spice and beer. Flavor's the same more bittersweet. Fully carbonated. Clean and refreshing. Ok body. Finish is good with a typical Czech pale lager. Definitely a session beer. Got this bottle at Sam's in Chi."
"This has a palate wetting quality and goes down smoothly. It's on par for the style, but I like my German Pils a bit better."
"Overall, a good and very refreshing Czech Pilsener. I enjoyed this beer a lot and certainly will drink more of it."
"mouthfeel/drinkability - light and crisp just what you want for this style"
"Clear golden colour, medium white head, some lacing, pretty average. Aroma is malty with some hops in the nose, grass, straw. Flavour is malty, but more hoppy than the aroma indicated, grass and straw and also some funky metallic notes that spoils it a bit. Mouthfeel is crisp with medium bubbles and the liquid isn't particularly sticky. All in all a decent pils that for its price is good value for money."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a perfectly clear, golden-yellow color with a one-finger, white soapy head. Looks just like a Pils should. The smell is a mix of gentle Saaz and slightly sweet, grainy malt. The flavor is similar with the sweet, grainy malt flavor coming to the forefront with a slightly bitter Saaz backbone. The mouthfeel is light in body with adequate yet not agressive carbonation. The finish is smooth but very slightly bitter. Overall a drinkable beer, better than your average BMC but nothing special."
"M&D: easy to drink as the fizziness comes quite ideal, neither artificially fizzy nor too harsh, but it is actually too light-bodied and lightly-flavoured for a 5%abv. Svetle Lezak. Very different from the draught version I tried in Southern Bohemia four years ago."
"Big half-liter bottle, ""born-by"" 17.12.2007, whatever the hell that means. Brewed with Czech malts, atec (Saaz) hops and spring water. It pours the standard, crystal-clear, bright gold pilsner color, with medium carbonation and three fingers of head that reduces to a thin cap, and leaves patches of lacing on the glass. Notes of skunky and spicy hops in the nose - nice, but not very pronounced. Spicy and herbal hops impart a sturdy bitterness, backed by a gentle grassy malt flavor that imparts a light sweetness. Just a touch of ethanol detectable. Light, dry body, with a nice, well-rounded finish. A delicious Czech pils (I almost did 4.5 for taste) that is very easy to drink. If you're into pilsners, this one is a must-try."
"Lightly sweet malts upfront, predominantly bready with some grainy hints. The finish is lightly grassy with a mild bitterness. Light-bodied, crisp and moderately carbonated."
"D - if I wanted to get drunk, this would be something to drink. it goes down easy, it's not filling, and it doesn't taste awful like other macro lagers."
"This is a nice session beer - but other than that it doesn't really offer anything. It's actually quite filling."
"Pours clear gold with a puffy white head. Stale aroma of straw, grass, and hops. Bready, sweet taste with some hops and metal. Grassy finish. Decent, but nothing special. It came as mo surprise when I found this was owned by Heineken. Somewhat reminiscent of their hop profile."
"Very drinkable, and much better than imported Pilsener Urquell."
"The most malty of the readily available ""light"" (color not taste) beers in Prague. I taste a lot of caramel. Good hop finish. Relatively rich for a pilsener-style beer, good carbonation."
"Not a bad beer, just somewhat boring."
"D - This is a nice easy to drink pilsener."
"D- I am a big fan of good Czech Pilsner beers. This one is very drinkable and one that I wouldn't mind having again."
"Overall this is a decent lager from the Czech Republic. Not bad at all but nothing special either. A decent novelty beer (The Czech Republic? Like, where's that???) to enjoy at cookouts perhaps."
"D - Might want to rethink the recipe."
"The beer is a golden color with a white head. The head faded pretty quickly for me. I could smell a light grassy/hoppy aroma. I couldn't pick up much of a malt flavor when I tasted it. The hops came out in the aftertaste, with a strong (but good) hoppy, grassy flavor. I felt like there was a bit of a creamy texture to the beer, which I didn't expect but found pleasing."
"pours up a slightly murky goldonian hue with a very mellovescent shine when held up to the Sun. also has a little yet long lasting white head. The nose consists of chobile, grains, some lighter fruits like peaches, and very similar of a smell to the African baobab fruit. Taste is of grains, slight floral hops, very remeniscant of my grandmama. the body was medium like that of an Egyptian belly dancer, low carbo, sweet finish, a very virtuous beer."
"Overall a slightly above-average pilsener, but it holds its own. Middle-of-the-road without being mediocre, definitely leaning more towards the malt side in the end."
"Poured from a 500 ml.bottle,golden yellow with foamy white head that turns to a decent collar and mild sticky lacing.Very fresh aroma with hops and grass coming through,a little peppery in there too.Taste is refreshing and clean with fresh grains and grass coming at you and a peppery bite to it and solid bitterness finishing it off,dry aftertaste at the very end and the pepper there too once again.Medium to full body with good amount of carbs in there,those bubbles seem endless,well worth a try,good brew,quite enjoyable to me."
"Taste is strong malty which makes the beer quite big, but doesn't interfere with the drinkability. The malt is grainy, a bit caramellized and has a bready, crusty taste. A clean bitterness, which is just a little bit soapy."
"D - I enjoyed this. Very light and easy to drink. Nothing too big or overpowering."
"Overall, it's not bad, i would have it again on ocasion, but I'm a bit dissapointed with it, because this brewery has much better choices."
"The taste is the typical Czech sharp hop from the Saaz variety, fairly dry malty graininess, with some bittering dry herbal tastes in the finish. There is a slight metallic and mustiness to the beer, especially on the back end; my guess is that the former is characteristic, the latter is due to the lack of freshness. Overall, I will try this beer again, albeit with a fresher label date, and see if my conclusions are borne out."
"Decent pilners, will probably quaff a few of these while in stock this July."
"Yellow with foamy bubbly white head. A bit beery aroma. Average drinkability, the mouthfeel is a tad grainy, dry and rough but one can get through it.I think those who expect this to be an imperial pilsner as opposed to a pilsner maybe a tad disapointed."
"Looked fantastic after the pour: a golden yellow-orange color with a big, white, fluffy head that bubbled down very slowly to a lace across the whole top of the beer. The smell was decent, a bit of grassy hops and a lot of bready malts. I was not much of a fan of the taste: up front is was the bready malts again, plus some other grainy tastes, which to me was kind of bland. There was some hoppiness at the end, but it was more of a small fizzle of taste rather than a compliment. It was somewhat sweet, but in a way that left the beer feeling a little too heavy and syrupy for me, despite the thin and well carbonated mouthfeel. All in all, I think there are a lot better Czech pilseners out there."
"D: this is a pretty darn good little czech pils. I'm loving the dryness of this one. It's very easy to drink and is highly refreshing. I can see myself having a lot of this beer this summer."
"The taste is surprisingly earthy, with toasty bread, caramel, leaves, a little pine, and a quite a bit of citrus, particularly lemon with a hint of grapefruit. After starting light, the bitterness soon increaseas to make a very nice balance of hops and malt."
"Golden color with a head that didnt last long and left no lacing. Smells of grain and bread with a very faint carmel smell. Taste starts smooth and has a very bitter and heavily carbonated end with some pine and citrus flavors. Over all it has a sour taste that I didnt enjoy."
"Had this while on tour in Atlanta, bought on base in a 20(?) ounce bottle. Poured it assuming I'd experience an imperial flavor, but was met with nothing more than ale style flavor and mouthfeel. A let down, and couldn't even finish the bottle it tasted so bad; switched to Stella after 1/4 of the bottle, and dumped it down the drain. Will never buy this again, but then again maybe some more refined palates find something redeemable in this swill."
"Overall a good and tasty pils. Good drinkability."
"Nice looking golden lager, white head that died quickly. Sweet aroma of the euro skunk, slides into the quaff along with the crisp lager malts. On the sweet side, but a decent brew, that finishes crisply - good hop balance. This would drink well in the summer heat, but the import price will probably keep it out of the DBF."
"D-great drinkability,this would go well with a meal(steak,pizza,ect.)simple brew with a lot of character"
"Prosit, MK"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- This beer is easy to drink no surprises here. If I am ever in that area of the world I don't know if I would try this particular beer but never say never."
"Drinkability is pretty good, I had a few of these tonight, they went well with Thai food, Red Curry Duck. Thanks to my Dad for splurging on the pricy case, and makes me proud of my Slovakian heritage."
"A pretty easy drinker, this is, one I could see enjoying a full pint of on a patio on a hot summer day, in Vaclavske Namesti (wishful thinking), or elsewhere (probably even more so). A decent, if a tad reserved version of the best Pilseners out there - even though it's got the look down pat."
"D-Not outstanding but serviceable. I prefer the Cerny to this but it is a refreshing Pils."
"An exceedingly drinkable pilsner. I will revisit this one again sometime."
"The beer upon the poor presents a clear gold with a modest creamy white head that fades quickly leaving a thin but complete sheet to cover the glass. Nose has a sweet malt aroma, crisp and clean, front is somewhat sweet with a decent malt presence, top is moderate in feel. Finish has a pedestrian acidity, the hops adequately spicy, dry and sweet until the end, a drinkable beer, and better than many, I have sampled."
"This beer was over a year old according to the born on date but still had a lot left. Lacing continued to impress and the total package was very well put together."
"Impressive Pilsener, moderately dark golden color with a modest head. The taste exudes hops with a decent bitter taste and the mouthfeel has good carbonation. Overall, the beer is smooth and hoppy, strong and bold in taste with a good finish. Worth grabbing a second, yet also works well in dialogue with a good smooth porter or stout. One I'd recommend without reservation."
"Pours a clean straw yellow color with a white head. Aromas os sweet malt and somewhat fruity, like green apples. In the taste, small fruitiness (green apples) that goes from sweet to dry. A smooth mouthfeel and a dry fruity aftertaste. Light on the palate and refreshing."
"Krusovice Imperial pours a dark golden yellow with a white head that laces nicely from a brown half liter bottle. The aroma is grassy. The flavor is grassy hops with a touch of hoppy spiciness in the forefront, a mild malt flavor toward the end provides a solid backbone. Not bad, I'm pleasantly surprised, I wasn't expecting much when I bought it, I thought it was going to be a Euro strong lager type of beer based on the imperial designation, but it's a decent Czech pils."
"D - I've partaken in this fantastic brew at a local Czech run bar and I still think it is worthwhile. I have had and will have again."
"Drinkability: Enjoyable enough Pilsner that I would have again"
"$1.99 at the San Luis Obispo BevMo!"
"Solid in a bottle, much better off the tap."
"Wouldn't buy it again, but wouldn't really avoid drinking it."
"The beer is quite nice. The best way to describe it is...wonderfully subdued. If your looking for a Pliny or Storm King, look elsewhere. If you just want a quality beer you can enjoy and like drinking, this is it."
"I wasn't a fan of this brewery's schwarzbier, and from what I've heard, their light lager is not to be bothered with. Thier ""Imperial"" turns out to be quite decent. For starters, the bottle I got was not stale, which is a frequent problem with European imports. Secondly, I'm sure it helps that I've just arrived home from cycling back from work on a warm summer day. Anyway, after having caught my breath, I can smell the grainy aroma with some spicy-herbal-grassy hops and a hint of corniness. About how I'd expect a Czech Pils to smell. The flavor is clean and malty with a brisk hoppy bite in the finish and a mildly tart yogurt-like tangy aftertaste. All in all, I've had better Czech Pilseners, but this one is drinkable, especially if you've gotten yourself all hot and thirsty first."
"I'll be having another soon i'm sure!"
"Overall, it's a classic bohemian pilsner. A little bit sharper than the average. Definitely a good example of a czech pilsner."
"Bottle poured into pint glass: Rich golden color with a fairly dense, foamy white head. Mildly sweet malt aromas balanced by a mildly flowery hop presence. Clean, pale malt palette with bread flavors and a slightly grassy finish. Begins with a soft, hoppy aroma which returns and mellows at the finish. Pleasantly watery mouthfeel - fuller, like tap water, rather than overly crisp filtered water. Very drinkable, though I only have one. For an inexpensive imported pilsener, this one is richer in flavor and aroma than Urquell, well-balanced, but without the crispness and subtle hop bite."
"I'm actually fairly impressed with this stuff. Not bad at all."
"D - Excellent, if a bit boring. I could drink a few more of these this spring. I'm not the biggest pils fan, but this is excellent."
"Drinkable, but not outstanding. Finish has more bitterness than the nose lead me to believe and really helps the flavor profile. Worth a try."
"Well, it's refreshing so could fit with the ""hot-day"" category...but there are so many of those...This fits in with the boring, though not bad, Euro lager category."
"16.9 oz. bottle- color of clear pale golde, with a light head  nose of straw , hay , and sweet  taste of yeasty , skunk , hay or dry straw and some mild hops - body medium , medium carbonation , and slighty acidic  aftertaste of straw , and mild hopps a generic beer"
"Effervescent and golden, a shade darker than most czech pilsners. The smell is typically czech in profile- crisp, with floral hops and subdued malt. The taste is crisp and rounded and very balanced. Soft rounded malt in the background. The mouthfeel is very soft, but with a nice level of carbonation. Very nice, if not world shaking."
"Poured a big, foamy, off-white head leaves a few thick strands of lace. Transparent golden colored beer holds a few streams of briskly rising bubbles. Pungent herbal and floral hops in the aroma with a touch of pale malt. Light pale malt based flavor with an overriding hop tea flavor throughout. Mouthfeel is light, and finishes almost airy. A decent Pils. One sip it's tastes ok and the next it's pretty good. I would say go for it."
"Nice mouthfeel, very good carbonation. Refreshing when served cold. Worth repeating, much better than some of the other pilseners from the regions."
"B""ham UK"
"D-I liked it but I wouldnt go out and buy it again.It taste just like any other pilsner but it refreshes.I reccomend."
"Drinkability: Let's never, ever speak of this again."
"OA: nothing intresting at all.. if you want a very unoffensive watery beer, go for this one.... did I say refreshing??"
"Mouthfeel was impressively raspy in texture. Medium carbonation present. Medium body. Pleasant all around."
"Probably a less than average beer per style. Partly due to the dangerously-near skunk aroma that eminates from the bottle and into the glass. Even with a typical pale straw color and abundance of carbonation, the beer lacks promise early and often. Flavors turn out sweet but quickly follow up with a grainy bite, lemony astringency, and a watery body. Hop flavor does, however, subsite into a grassy, earthy character, but never improves the beer to good levels. Not necessarily a bad beer, but does not deliver for me."
"D--Very good. I drank this after mowing my yard in the Florida heat and I'm very much craving one or two more. It's the perfect thing to quench your thirst on a hot day."
"It's well-balanced, well-brewed, and loaded with enough character to keep you from getting bored. Worth trying!"
"Well balanced drop. I think my bottle is nearing its best-by; I would like to try it nearer the source."
"Standard clear gold and a nice head. Smell is grassy-grain, metallic, with a vegetable-skunkiness to it. Taste is grainy, but fairly bland from what you would expect from the style. Below average in this crowded and poorly represented style. I think these beers need to be sampled fresh, closer to the brewery. Getting shipped across the Atlantic doesn't do much to improve this style, IMO."
"Initial aroma of lemons, and sweetness. Followed by a sweet, tart taste, but after its down, leaves an earthy, biscuity, very dry hop taste. The overall taste was also somewhat on the flat side due to the low carbonation. Not a horrible czech beer, but I'm sure there are better"
"This is a utilitarian Czech Pils, solid and worth trying, however not much stands out overall."
"I like Czech pilseners more than most do, so I have no problem with rating such a beer so highly. For its style, this is world class."
"A pale brother of noble Dark/Black is smartly packed (all this gold and medals on the label). Well, Royal Brewery, noblesse oblige, etc. The product itself is not a 'waanabee' by all existing standards - malty, with subtle yeasty-fruity aroma, a bit sweet for my liking but with well-expressed hops and even some tartness in the finish. Good Czech lager. Not the best, but by no means not the worst of them. Try it some day..."
"The aftertaste leaves a tingling sensation on the tongue , which makes this an enjoyable Summer thirst quencher"
"Overall - A very average beer... worth a try maybe once...."
"Krusovice Imperial, brewed by the very important sounding The Royal Brewery of Krusovice, is an okay Czech pils, all things considered. Even with a much needed nose job it wouldn't win any beauty contests. Besides, given all the bitterness, 'Miss Congeniality' is a long shot. It's still a worthwhile beer."
"In the aftertaste, again, after a good grassy hop, there is a comebacking of some maltiness."
"Notes: This is not American Macro Lager, this is Czech Pilsener"
"Drinkability: Drink it fast and furious on a summer day after an assload of yard work, and this would be perfect. That said, you can get a half-rack of Rainier for about $7, which is probably quite a bit cheaper than the plane ticket to Czechoslovakia. Although, if you're going to go there for this specific beer, then my admonitions about Rainier will fall on deaf ears."
"500 ml can, bought in Prague. Golden colour, large & thick head. Hoppy and fruity aroma, some flowers there too. Flavour is pleasantly balanced between the malts and hops - both elements are present and plentiful to a much greater degree than many other so called ""pilseners"". Nice."
"drinkability isnt bad, but the flavor dulls a bit as it warms."
"For 22 Krone a half liter it can not be beat while in Czech."
"Pours a slightly reddish clear gold under a white head that maintains some body for a little while before dissipating into a thin film across the top. A couple of spots of lace cling to the side. The nose is weak - there's some malt there, but really not much/enough. The mouth is nicely carbonated and even. The initial taste is malt, but the hops are there from the start, giving a nice flowery bite in the finish. The amazing thing, though, is the aftertaste, which kicks in a full 30 seconds after the liquid goes down. Smooth bitterness overwhelms the mouth from the throat up and forward. Wow! I could drink a lot of these!"
