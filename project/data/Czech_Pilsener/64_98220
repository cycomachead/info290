Grassy, heavy dough aroma and some spicy hop character but no fruit notes come through.  Taste differs on that end, opens with grass, hay and big dough pilsner quality.  Mid palate brings fruity pear and apple notes and a spicy lemony finish.  Well carbonated but creamy on the palate.  Overall this is an interesting change of pace.  The flavor delivers and I do like it as a change from big winter beers.  I'd probably revisit this one again.","HopBomb515","Mar 01, 2015"

3.41,-10,3.75,4,3,3.25,3.5,"I snagged a 4-pack of this at a Sunoco Craft Beer Exchange, and it's been a tale of two beers.  The first was poured at near room temp, and it did little to inspire. The second was chilled, and what a difference that made. Both beers poured with a mottled, white head that popped and fizzed away in short order. The more aggressive pour produced a towering foam crest that left beautiful lacing on my Modelo Especial pint glass. The appearance is consistent with a classic golden pilsener. Great clarity. Perhaps a touch more concentrated in color. More like the beer I recycle after a night of drinking-related dehydration. There's a bright, crisp, floral hop aroma with underlying white grape juice sweetness. A little bit of Apple Jacks cereal in the nose. The first impression is simply too sweet for my liking, but at a cooler temperature it's less pronounced. No discernible pear flavor, save the sugar. Unbalanced. The Saaz hops tend to dominate, competing only with a cloying sweetness. The cracker-like malt flavors get a little lost in a sea of refined sugar. The finish is mildly bitter, and leaves a somewhat muddled impression. The moderate mouthfeel and tame carbonation are a bit light. Not as spritzy or crisp as I had hoped. In the end, if you're not opposed to sugary libations, it's truly a non-offensive beer that does little to push the flavor envelope. A passable pilsener nonetheless. There's a marked difference between the warm and cool variations that I tried. At cooler temps it was much more refreshing and masked some of the imperfections. The warmer variety had me focused on all of the wrong things. The same can be said for any number of macro-lagers, so that can't be a good thing. Either way, I had hoped for more with the addition of pear and pear tea. Ultimately it's a crafty example of Saaz hops in an overly-sweetened Czech Pilsener.","JohnnyI","Jan 07, 2015"

Slightly hazy gold with a giant white head, retained well while waiting to come to temp. Aroma gave the pear early, not sure if that was power of suggestion and I was hunting for it or if that really is the initial nose. The biscuity malt came next with a slight tart edge, kind of lime, not hops. I could not find a date on the bottle to see if any aging had impacted aroma and flavor. The flavor was true to the aroma, with pronounced intensity. Orchard fruit forward with biscuity malt across the palate, with a tart lime-grass finish. If this is indicative of the pils genre, I look forward to trying many traditionals. I know this one had the pear thing built in, but I tried to gauge some sense of pils around it. My rookie status as a pils drinker may not have done that well.","MisterGone","Dec 22, 2014"

The flavor reveals quite a bit of fruitiness including pear and apple, but also lemon, which must be coming from the hops. Beneath that there's a stable base of Pilsner malt that's gently bread and a bit straw-like. The bitterness is solid, but only to the point of balancing the malt as the acidity of the pear juice is enough to put an edge on it, and both then follow into the lingering finish along with straw and residual lemon (as well as some tea-leaf). Perhaps that's the "piercing" nature that inspired the name, as I love the start but find the end a little raspy. Or is the "pierce" that shot of lemon that you get at the front? Regardless, it's unique and you really have to give it credit for that. Additionally, it's clearly well made (great appearance, great head retention and lacing, nicely balanced with a bit of a twist, appropriate mouthfeel).","NeroFiddled","Dec 05, 2014"

Taste is same as aroma with some herbal hops bitter notes. A medium crisp body on the palate, lively carbonation, goes down smooth. The finish has a sweet fruity pear like flavor, biscuit malt and herbal hops bitterness for balance. This brew is nicely balanced not too sweet not too hoppy, a just right combination. Overall a uniquely flavored but tasty session brew and refreshing. Try it.","Samp01","Sep 29, 2014"

The pear mimics the cool, fruity character of Noble hops, while complementing the sharper, peppery grassy hops. The hops and pear are well balanced in the aroma and flavor.

You can definitely taste the tea though, so if that sounds unappealing to you, avoid this one. Dogfish Head brings the quality I've come to expect from them to a kind of beer you might not expect them to attempt, and they pull it off very well. I'd say that the feel just barely keeps this beer from "outstanding" territory, but it's still one of the best pilsners I've ever had.","BrewMakeMeFeel","Mar 11, 2014"

4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured a nice cloudy golden color with a one finger white head that receded to a ring of white that left slight lacing down the glass. A very true to style and quite appealing pilsner look. Scents of lager yeast, pear, spicy hops and grainy malt. A good classic Czech pilsner scent, with the nice addition of pear from the pear juice. Flavor begins with a citrus-like sweetness, some pear and a bit of hop bitterness, moving into some bready malt and spicy, herbal hop flavors in the middle alongside some sweet citrus, finishing with herbal hops and grain with an aftertaste of herbal hops and grainy malt. A good, well-rounded pilsner flavor, with some sweetness added from the pear juice, but not enough to overpower the hops and malt. Balanced and refreshing, as a pilsner should be. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate carbonation and a juicy mouthfeel. True to style and very easy to drink. Overall this is a good take on a Czech pilsner, that while not incredibly unique for the style, does offer enough that is different to stand out somewhat. The pear juice adds a dimension of fruity sweetness that works well alongside the traditional pilsner flavors and makes this one quite nice to drink.","Auraan","Mar 07, 2014"

Nice soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big pear, apple, cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance of malt, hop, pear juice, and yeast ester notes; with great strength. Taste of big pear juice, apple, grape, cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Slight earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pear juice, apple, grape, cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, floral, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and robustness of pear juice, malt, hop, and yeast flavors; with a good malt/pear flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. A bit too much sweetness, but still has nice balance. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Czech pilsner style. All around good balance and robustness of pear, malt, hop, and yeast flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 16, 2014"

I could detect lots of carbon dioxide, and a faint int of fruit, but not much in the way of the hops. The taste was much better than the smell, as the hops were clearly present. The pear juice was initially masked under the malt, but the beer was certainly fruitier than a typical Pils. As the beer warmed up, the pear became much more noticeable. Very smooth lager flavor, and fading fruity and hoppy aftertaste. The body was thicker than typical, but still quenching. Carbonation had a bit of a sting to it.

I could see this being a great spring or summer review. It is clean going down and very refreshing.

Nice crackery grains and spicy with Pilsner hops. The fruit goes really well with the pilsner aromas. Taste is sweet, crackery, lemony, spicy. The pear is less noticeable however it is there.

The pear and tea additions were perfectly done, and the beer remains dry overall and true to its roots. This is a fantastic beer.

Mild filminess to the yellow gold colored liquid, light orange tint at the glass edges, the bubbles are few but fat and move at a decent clip, looks richer than your standard pilsner. The pear fruit comes through very clearly on the nose, trace amount of florality would seem sweet were it not for the sale and pepper, dark bread and black tea leaf notes, clean kind of herbaceousness, ends with an allusion to mixed white citrus and metal shavings, not tightly woven as a fabric but nice enough to sniff. Full-bodied, would suspect the juice gives it extra heft, pulls down into the palate, the carbonation is not weak per se but in no position to do much about anything. The pear there yet gets sucked back into the whole by its overall sourness and that earthy, metallic bite. Spicy, especially peppery, herbal but not “green,” tree bark and less breadiness and citrus than might be desired. It does stay as lively as possible through the finish, dry while not excessively so.

Definitely more pear in the flavor, but the quality Saaz-iness remains along with a decent fresh cereal grain note. Perhaps a little too much of that sweet, dry pear juice element getting in the way of the Pils qualities. Light, pretty crisp, some acidity.

Poured a crystal clear, light golden color, with a thin white head that fizzled out completely, leaving no lacing behind. Pretty blank aroma, thin crackery malts, grains, distant herbal hops. Very disappointingly simple taste of toasted grains, and bitter herbal hops. Absolutely no pear whatsoever, and if it was in there, the graininess totally overpowered it. If it were an old dusty bottle, I'd expect something like this, but this was right out of the tap from the source. Light body, light mouthfeel, lasting bitterness. Pretty unpleasant.

Again, the saaz hops really stand out with dry, sticky bitterness, earthy grass and pine needle flavor. This is countered by hints of bread, biscuit, apple and pear. The tea adds an odd metallic, medicinal note that lingers long after the finish. Pear flavor doesn't stand out much more than the ester-y notes of a traditional example of the style. I wasn't sure what to expect going in but this was a pretty tame experiment. Very similar to classic czech pils with plenty of grassy hop bitterness and a touch more light fruit sweetness than usual. The only element that negatively stands out is the astringent, herbal tea character. Unfortunately, this negatively affects the flavor and hurts drinkability. Still, this is an okay beer that's easy to drink.","corby112","Dec 24, 2013"

Aroma of pear juice, biscuit malt, light grassy hops. Flavor is sweet biscuit malt, pilsner hops with a light floral grassy character, light pear flavor, but not the sweetness expected from pear juice. Nice. Medium bodied. A very nice take on the pilsner style, capturing the aroma and taste of Sasz hops, but adding a light, but pleasant pear flavor. The fruit is handled deftly, making this a quite enjoyably drinking ale. Not strictly traditional, but good.","LiquidAmber","Dec 23, 2013"

I could not imagine any other variety here, its a perfect marriage. it has a little too much body for a pils, which I guess from the color, honey colored with a nice white head but a density unbecoming to the style. it works though, and gives the herbal pear/tea combination something to hold on to. worthy sauce for sure right here, the pear is subtle and not sweet at all, which makes great sense in a dryer and crisper style. I know the style gurus will have a field day bashing dogfish head for yet another "off centered ale", but this one really does work, and certainly doesn't warrant the criticism I can see it facing. really an innovative and well executed brew.","StonedTrippin","Dec 20, 2013"

I was ready either for a crisp, tight brilliant pilsener OR a "fruitified" pilsener (well, maybe that's what this is...). Seems DFH toned down the pear flavors so as to avoid creating a too-sweet pilsener, because it wasn't too sweet (which would have been a critical flaw), but it did take on a white wine-like sweetness over time (as it warmed). I had hoped it would be less "well-rounded" (as if that's a flaw), and something a little with a little more bite or zing. An interesting/atypical profile for the style. I think that fans of DFH's wine-hybrid beers would like this, but some hardcore pilsener fans might not find it crisp enough.

The smell is typical pilsner (bread notes from the malt as well as hops) along with a citrus note. The taste is, well, a mess, at least in the finish. It starts off quite good, with cracker/bread flavors from the malt and a good amount of hop presence too, but the pear just doesn't blend well. It seems to make the beer taste 'fresh" and it certainly is original, but the flavor doesn't work with anything here. Overall, this would be a much better beer without the pear, as the simple pilsner flavors seem to be in place without the fanciness.

While not on the level of the Victory Prima Pils, this was a great take on the style that doesn't get a lot of love in colder months of even when it comes to ratings. A mellow brew from Dogfish that was unlike anything else in their current lineup and worth a go for someone looking for a alternative to what's currently available this holiday season.","JerzDevl2000","Dec 13, 2013"

3.65,-3.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Strange, i don't usually like pears but there is this delicious bright fresh pear taste but there's also this hoppy bright bitterness as well. Can't tell if they go well together though. Starts with this delicious pear fruity flavors. Light to Medium bodied with brisk refreshing carbonation. leads to this earthy bitter citric rind hop flavor. The flavors dont really blend together well but they dont oppose eachother. Interesting yet strange, once your tongue gets acclimated to both flavors they seem to come together nicely. What's pulled apart at first comes together half way through, refreshing, semi-sweet yet with a clean crisp bitterness. Would i call it a czech pilsner? definitely not, the fruitiness of this beer makes it much different but it does have those qualities. I like it, a unique take on the "style" but not to be compared to others in the style.","jtierney89","Dec 12, 2013"

3.77,-0.5,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and a good example of Czech Pilsener with a slight twist to it that was light enough to not cover up the true flavors of the style and I thought that made for some nice balance. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, clean, crisp, not filling and the taste did a decent job at holding my attention, I could drink a couple of these without getting bored with it. What I liked the most about this beer was how true to style it was, besides the pear it was a pretty by the book Czech Pilsener. What I liked the least about this beer was that it was released this time of the year, I think a summer release would much better suit this beer. I don't know if I would buy this beer again since it's fairly pricey for a Czech Pilsener, but I'm sure I would buy at least a bottle or two if the weather was warm. I would recommend this beer to anybody who likes the style. All in all I enjoyed this beer, going into it I didn't know what to expect, Dogfish Head can be a little unpredictable sometimes but this turned out to be a good straight forward Czech Pilserner with a light pear aspect, It might be nice to have a little more pear flavor, but that might cover up some of those good Czech Pilsener flavors, so I think it was fine just the way it was. Good job Dogfish Head, this was a pretty solid and easy drinking beer, keep up the good work.","StoutHunter","Dec 09, 2013"

4.08,7.7,4,3.5,4.25,4.5,4.25,"Overall - I applaud Dogfish Head for making this pilsner. Its crisp and adventurous and very flavorful. Releasing in the early winter is fine and makes a nice departure from the heavy beers of norm this time of year. Its very hoppy and 6% is a little high so its not quite a summer lawnmower beer. I'd drink this one any time of year though. Nice job.","bubseymour","Dec 09, 2013"
4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"O- A very nice version of a style that I am a fan of and wish more American breweries worked as hard to nail this style as they do stouts and IPAs. The pear gives it that extra Dogfish Head quality of something different in there that really is not over done. Would like to catch this on-tap some time.","PaulyB83","Dec 08, 2013"

4.08,7.7,4.25,4.25,4,4,4,"Piercing Pils a beer I've wanted to try since I heard about the pear juice and pear tea additions. Pours a brilliant golden color with bright fluffy white head, I've been drinking DFH pils since the Prescription Pils, Golden Shower, Golden Era, and the latest My Antonia. I liked them all by the way, nice to see a 6% abv on a pils from them that has Saaz hops backing it all up. Aroma has an earthy herbal note, but not much in the way of actual pears. More Saaz, earthy, citrus, cut grass qualities with a nice bready malt back bone. Flavor has some pear essence, and more earthy herbal tea bitterness too bad most of the pear sweetness was fermented out here. As a whole it's a nice full bodied pils with easy drinkability, a bit off centered but much less so than some of their crazy adjuncts they usually put out there. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied with sturdy carbonation goes down great with every sip. Overall no complaints noted here, I'm a fan of this pils as well but don't expect it to re-invent the wheel.","WVbeergeek","Dec 07, 2013"

3.44,-9.2,4.5,3,3.5,4,3.25,"First, pilsners are not my go to style so take this review with a grain of salt and the knowledge that it may be more affected by my other tastes than it actually being true to style. First, it pours pretty much exactly like I would expect a perfect pilsner to: absolutely clear light golden with a fluffy white head that sticks to the glass, and perpetual effervescing bubbles rising from everywhere. Smell was pretty standard, a bit hoppier than most. Couldn't really pick out much pear odor. Taste has some pear sweetness up front, going to some bread and malt in the middle. Some faint spice and notes of tea left on the aftertaste. Feel is light, with crisp carbonation. Overall, for someone who doesnt' really like pilsners, this isn't bad. The hops and pear and subtle sweetness bring some good complexity. Definitely try if you are a fan of the style, and consider it if you're not!","Samuel906","Dec 04, 2013"
4.42,16.6,4.25,4.75,4.5,3.75,4.25,"Overall one of my favorite pilseners to date. Remove the pear from the equation and this would be an amazing bohemian pilsener. The pear however is another DFH unorthodox win. It ups the alcohol and complexity to deconstruct a classic while mostly holding true to its roots.","kami","Dec 04, 2013"
