"Been sitting on this one for a while.  Drank it straight out of the bottle but pour a little for color which was Amber.  Not much carbonation after the initial opening of the bottle.  Doesn't really taste like a typical Pilsner in bitterness.  Tasted more like an ipa with some yeast bready brown ale flavor."

"O: More American west coast than expected.  Dry on the finish, more of an APA than a pilsner in my opinion.  Bought in Chiang Mai, drank Nov 24, 2014."

"A solid American craft-style lager!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A lager apa? This would be a nice beer if not for the off flavors, for now I'm not sure what the lager part brings to the table - the only yeast driven flavors I get are off-flavored."
""
""
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied by good flavors and aromas."

"Do not understand the idea of ​​a bottom-fermented APA, but it’s also something that I like about this kind of cocky beer."
""
"Dark yellow-brown and barely translucent. Plenty of pleasant Hoppiness on the nose. Fruit, mostly, with a whiff of bitter resin. The taste isn't obviously lagery, but the malt base is certainly there. Smooth, crisp, and surprisingly bitter. It's accessible, drinkable, and enjoyable. Not a lot to criticisize other than my inevitable quibble with the malt base."
"Overall : a good beer in the style Pilsener."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very tasty, a big (maybe too big) plate of tasty bitter hops. Haven't had enough of Mikkellers yet, but i hope his brews don't rely solely on hops, risking to be too similar. I expect a bit more than that from such expensive beers."
"Overall - A superb brew and one that i wish i could get my hands on more easily... highly recommended.."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Wow. As someone who likes heavy beers like imperial stouts and double ipas, this blew me away. I never knew a pils could have this much flavor - the perfect amount of hops to balance the sweetness, but still lighter than a pale ale. Yum! I will definitely be trying to find a case of this..."
""
"Overall - Really nice beer that while retaining pilsener character also offers a crossover point with hopheads since the hops are quite prevalent here. A delicious beer that I would repurchase, but only once in a while given that even better beers (albeit in different styles) can be purchased for less."
""
""
""
"Overall: Goes down easy but still feels like a proper hop packed beer. Very well executed and interesting take on lager, i hope to see more like this in the future."
""
""
"This is a kick ass Pilsner. It has a unique hop profile with more emphasis on citrus than the average Pilsner. Very complex and quaffable, near perfect balance. A must try."
""
"mikkeller can really do no wrong, finally found one I haven't had ( I know, there are millions, but I am always in search of). this one is going by ""dream pils"" now. pours a darker than expected almost copper shade of gold, with an inch of thick white head. it smells almost funky, like mikkellers usual Belgian yeast groove, as well as lighter pilsener malts. the flavor doesn't have any of that yeast to it though, and is quite balanced between the hearty grain bill (for the style) and the hops, which are bitter and prickly. carbonation is great, body is bigger than the standard, and the finish is long and grassy. this isn't one of mikkellers way out there beers, but more of a regular drinker that's very well made. I wish it was in affordable sixers, but I say that about must stuff mikkeller makes. when will that be a reality?"
""
""
""
"M&O: refreshing, medium bodied, the flavour profile is rich and colourful, accentuating hops of course. A well-crafted, high-octave hoppy session lager ideal for any occasion, in my opinion."
""
"Excellent execution, balanced and flavorful. An improved Czech Pilsner slightly going towards an APA."
""
""
""
""
"O/D - A decent pils. Too dry though in the middle palate. Seemed to take away from the flavour. A nice pils otherwise and I could have a few."

""
"O: A delicious beer that is balanced quite nicely."
"Overall: just about a perfect pilsener, crisp and dry, with a little more hops than you might expect; fresh and pure tastes of mineral, grain, and pine give it a feel of truly coming from the land"
""
"Amber-blonde colour, 2 fingers of white head, lots of lace all the way down the glass. Smell is a mix of crisp crackery malt, citrus and an earthy floralness, hoppy with some lemon and melon/honey dew and a bit of peach. Taste starts of with a crisp malt before getting into dry earthy hop flavours, lemony citrus, fairly bitter. Med drying carbonation, lightly oily witha crisp medium body. A nice hoppy beer but seems to be fairly similar to most euro/danish IPA's I have come across."
"Overall, a good Pilsner that unfortunately didn't meet my expectations. It's got a good look with a great aroma but the feel of the beer threw the flavour off. A lawn cutting beer for sure but not one to form a judgement on Mikkeller."
""
""
""
""
"Overall underwhelming. This beer is not well balance and lacks a strong enticing aroma."
""
""
"Overall - Delicious. I would buy this again for a hot summer day. I would say it's underrated for the style."

"A decent enough beer, but a couple of disconnects; I'm thinking there's no way this is a pilsner and my bottle reads Canadian Dream at 5.5% not Danish Dream at 4.6%. Maybe a naming/reviewing template mix-up?"
"Mikkeller's Canadian(/American/Danish) Dream is nice but also forgettable, a reminder that beer, like anything else, can be a numbers game - brew every single recipe that comes to mind and inevitably a few will turn out extraordinary, more will flop, and most will end up somewhere in between. That broad, all-embracing median is exactly where I'd place this offering."
"A very pleasant surprise and a beer I'd highly recommend, albeit not to someone looking for a traditional Czech pilsener!"
"A highly enjoyable, unique take on the pilsner style. Not the bright, crisp and clean brew that made Bohemia famous, however, but still a satisfactorily bitter, flavorful brew."
"Overall – Kind of like an english IPA taste wise. This would probably work well as a session beer. Not terribly exciting, but a nice malty flavour and a good amount of hop bite. I probably won't buy more, but worth a try for sure."
""
""
""
"(4.0) D: This is very good and very easy-to-drink and yet still flavourful enough to savour. After making the entrance that it did – all is forgotten."
"Overall, not bad, but not really my cup of tea."
""
""
"M - Light to medium body. Moderate carbonation."
"O - A tasty brew, but it's more of an IPA than a pils. Maybe they hopped up the Canadian version because the ABV was re-stickered as 5.5%. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but as a pilsener it's not really the flavour profile I'm looking for. I like a sweet citrus note to complement the classic grassy pilsener hop profile, but the citrus hops completely dominate the profile. I'll be buying more, but not something I would recommend to someone who is looking for a pilsener."
"After 243 phantom reviews, this is my first leap into the world of text. Scary! Thanks for your understanding."

"Overall it's a good beer, not what I was expecting but I'm really glad to have tried it. I definitely might say this is a cross between an ipa and a pilsner."
"Overall: A great appearance and aroma, but a bit of a let down with the taste, which just too sharp and bitter. This might be a good beer to mature a bit, let the bitterness settle."
""
""
"D - Nice hoppy pilsner. Good overall balance."
""
""
"i am used to, but good none the less."
"any category. Good one, but claiming to be a Pilsner it's a complete failure."

"An unconventional take on the pilsner style - more of a hybrid between a pils and a hoppy pale ale. Unusual hop varieties in evidence. However, the result is decidedly tasty and goes down only too easily. A fantastic hop aroma and flavour with lots of light fruity notes - NZ varieties? Solid caramel backbone that keeps it's distance, though the yeast is a bit full on. Superb body - almost too thick for a lager. A well-crafted brew that is certainly worth trying - the only thing that would prevent me having it again is the excessive price."
"Very easy-drinking stuff."

"Pours a golden orange color with a nice white head. A pretty nice nose to this. Sweet malt and bread notes with a touch of biscuit. Nice floral hops, a hint of citrus peel, and a light yeastiness. The flavor is really crisp and refreshing. Good hop character with plenty of floral notes and a light bitterness. The malt flavors are there but not heavy and the yeast is present in the background."
""
""
"O: A very nice and refreshing beer. Perfect for a warm day during the summer."
""
""
"O - Impressive beer for only 4.6%. Tons of hops that bombard the palate over and over. More IPL then Pils, but it's good so who really cares, right? Def something to enjoy during the hot summer months."

"O - Good gutsy pilsner."
""
"Hazy copper with some orange and brown hues, big white head. Sticky lace and good retention. Nose is quite American for any type of pilsner, grapefruit, orange and some tropical notes and only perhaps a dash of Noble hopping, if it was even employed. Good malt character, caramel mostly, and not really typical of any pilsner at all. A bit of grainy character comes thorugh. More pilsner-like on the palate, dry grainy notes, and bread but still some caramel malt prevails. A bit grassy and herbal in terms of hopping, but some citrusy American hopping resides in the background. Medium mouthfeel, and higher medium carbonation. Decent, and a certain hybrid of a few styles."
""
""
"I won't be returning to this when my local brewery knocks out a far superior pils at half the cost! Drinkable - but the 2nd most disappointing Mikkeller beer after the wet hop keller bier for me."
""
""
""
""
"if this came in a 12$ 6er I'd be buying it daily, big flavors in something I could session, Mikkeller knows a secret, find a style on the edge of popularity and add a shitload of hops too it"
"B"
"Pours a two finger white head that fades very slowly to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Hazy amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Grapefruit nose and flavor is grapefruit hops, hints of caramel. This isn't a lager or a pilsner, it tastes like an IPA even with the low ABV. Label is Dream Pils. Expensive at $6.49 for a 330ml bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."
""
""
"O: This is a solid pale lager that will likely be welcomed by fans of hoppy lagers. While it is a unique and likable beer in its own right, Danish Dream is still a bit rough around the edges in the sense that the nose could use some more depth and the mouthfeel could stand to be smoother and more rounded. Still, this is a pretty decent little lager."
""
""
"O: Super easy to drink and very enjoyable - I could (and likely will) enjoy several of these in sitting. Definitely one of the better beers in the style."
"O: This beer is very crisp and refreshing. It would be a good beer to drink on a hot summer day."
""
""
""
"Lager?! Fucking eh! I don't think I've ever encountered a lager as (relatively) balls-out hoppy as this is. Not too big of a surprise, given the source, but all the same, this is a zesty, enjoyable tipple - a solid lager base, and the rest, you know."
""
""
"O - Not a bad beer, fairly hoppy for an APA, mostly toward the grapefruit and citrus end. Good Euro take an an APA."
""
"Definitely a unique take on the style. The hop and malt flavors and aromas are well balanced and play well off each other. Crisp and clean and very pleasant to drink. If the price tag wasn't what it was it'd be a nice beer to have a few of in one sitting."
"Yeah, a light, drinkable brew. Nice flavours but clean and crisp."
"D - If this beer weren't so damn expensive, it'd make a great summer session lager. Great American hop profile, full-flavor, nice texture - no real complaints here. I'm really glad we ordered a keg of this for Zwanze Day at West Lakeview Liquors."
"A good sessionable beer."
"Very decent brew. It's a mild style, but as usual, Mikkeller has loaded it with as much character as the style can possibly support."
"Very sessionable and enjoyable."
"If a lop-sided one-dimensional hop-centric APA became a lager, this is what it would be. While I enjoyed the good dose of hops this didn't strike me as any remarkable, especially for a Pils made with American hops, there is no harmony or cohesion."
"O: A very enjoyable beer. Far better than most of the style."
"Had this one on tap on the Bethlehem Speakeasy on 12-11-2009. When I read that this was a Pilsner I rolled my eyes and said to myself ""Oh great, another Pilsner"". I went with a friend of mine and I ordered a different beer from this one and my friend desided he'd try this one. I'm so glad he got it and let me try it, I immediately bought myself my own glass of it. This beer poured out as a golden orange color, slightly hazy with a nice foamy looking white head. Upon settling the head left a wonderful lacing down the glass. It looked incredible for a pilsner! The smell of the beer was strong with hops, some nice malts and even a little touch of fruity aromas were coming off this thing. The taste of the beer was just as impressive as the aroma. Every sip was just as good as the one before it, if not better. The mouthfeel was very smooth and had a crisp sharp finish. Overall this beer is without a doubt my favorite Pilsner. I can't imagine having one that tops this. I would love to have this beer again one day."
"Overall this was an easy-drinking, crisp, and low-ABV beer, something of which I'd like to have a lot more. Well worth a shot."
"Notes: A badass pilsner! Borderline IPA. Like a India Pale Lager."
"Good hoppy aroma. Murky golden coloured body with lots of white bubbly foam, that leaves levels of lace linings as it goes down. Average mouthfeel, a tad astringent. Very drinkable, god hoppy taste particularly for 4.6% a.b.v.Good bitterness, orange flavour. Above average carbonation."
"Bottle: Poured a light copper color pilsner with a nice big foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of crisp dry hops with light floral malt and subtle sweet undertones. Taste is quite dry with nice crisp dry hops finish with some light grassy floral notes with light sweet notes as well. Body is quite full for style with good carbonation. Very well brewed with nice hops presence though more grassy notes would have been even more beneficial."
"The smell was very positive, but the brew did not deliver as I had expected, might be better in a really warm surrounding. Tasted at a beer sampling at De Klomp, Linköping, Sweden."
"Tap, City Beer Store. A fine beer but not terribly exciting. This beer looks, smells and tastes a lot like a dry IPA. It drinks a bit bigger than the abv would suggest. The beer has a nice aroma that leans toward American hops - grapefruit rind and pine notes. There's also a touch of grassiness and some yeast in the nose. The flavor is dry and yeasty with light hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is light and quite good. It's a nice sessionable beer that costs a fairly outrageous price, at least this far from its home."
"Very drinkable. This is a really good pilsner/IPA hybrid that definitely falls more toward the IPA side."
"As it says in brackets up top this beer is called The American Dream on my bottle and have been looking forwards to trying it and gotta thank the boys at Cellarbrations Carlisle for again getting their hands on some new mikkeller brews as he has definately gotta be one of my favourite brewers who just continues to push the boundaries while still producing top quality beer anyways onto the beer,it pours a light copper/orange colour quite interesting for a pilsner with nice carbonation that leaves a frothy two finger head and clingy lacing everywhere very impressive looking,the aroma is very citrusy with passionfruit and tropical notes,it has a very easy light mouthfeel and just slides down so easy with beautiful tastes of tropical fruit and a passionfruity bitter finish but not overly bitter but in my eyes too bitter to be called a Pilsner let alone a Double Pilsner and would probaly lean towards calling it an American Pale Ale but netherless this beer is absolutely top quality no matter what style it comes under and right now im wishing i bought way more big thumbs up."
"For me this is a great beer. At just 4.6% it isn't particularly strong but there is lots of flavour. My only criticism is that the bitterness is probably just a touch high and could do with being toned down."
"The nose is all hops, big pine pungency with some citrus and a good deal of bitterness. Malt character is practically non-existent. The palate opens with a big, biting bitterness with pine and a little grapefruit. There's solid hop flavor too, but it's quite dominated by the bitterness. I also get a little more citrus and grapefruit than the nose would let on. Again, the malt is practically absent, there is no real sweetness or anything really, to hint at the presence of grain. Drying on the finish with a lingering resiny grapefruit and pine bitterness. Thoroughly enjoyable, it's something I'd love to try again. And it also has me intrigued in the 1000 IBU beer coming up!"
"This was an absolute treat to try."
"D- Quite possibly the perfect session beer. Fantastic aromatics and flavors, satisfying mouthfeel, and an incredibly tame level of ethanol. Incredibly drinkable and delicious!"
