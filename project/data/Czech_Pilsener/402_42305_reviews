"A lager with unusual attitude for the summer, thanks to hops and citrus."

"F: Clean finish. Really enjoyable. Great food beer. A bit fizzy."
"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 5/29/2014. Pours slightly hazy golden straw color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon, orange zest, cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, orange zest, cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, grass, pepper, pine, and herbal earthiness. Good amount of earthy herbal/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, orange zest, cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, grass, pepper, pine, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and balance of pale malt and earthy hop flavors; with a great crisp malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Very clean in flavor as well with minimal yeast ester presence. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Czech pilsener style. All around good robustness and balance of pale malt and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Average to slightly below average hoppier pilsner. The earthy hops do not seem to mesh well with the pilsner malt.  Decent beach beer, but I prefer others in the style."

"O: Nothing special, but wow is it easy to drink. I could easily drink a six pack, so something right was done here. Still, it's far from my favorite pilsner."

"On tap at McGillins this past weekend. Light golden straw color with a smallish bone white head. Sweet malty bready aroma with a hint of spicy hops. Light bready honey like sweet malty taste with a hint of tartness to it. Decent pilsner but not nearly as refined or as cleanly fermented as some classic examples."
"The resiny hop taste is quite prominent. A touch of the metallic and stony. An herbal sort of bitterness at the finish. This seems quite sharp and tangy with a lemon peel taste. Not as quaffable for a light beer, as you might like, though it has plenty of hops for those who like more bite. From the 12 oz bottle out of the cooler at Whole Foods in DC."

"Quite a bit of tangy tone to this one. Also a lot of ink to it as well. Hoppy spices are clogging things up as well. The whole combination makes it much more robust and intense than I would like for a lager. Doesnt seem to have any level of restraint at all. There is nothing refreshing about this beer."

"Not a bad beer but seems to lack flavor feels washed out."

"O. Don't sleep on Dominion. They are still producing some excellent brews and this is absolutely one of them. Great recommendation, Rhett, and a must-try pilsner for anyone living in a city that gets above 90 degrees in the summer."
""
"I think it'd be a come-down to say a good ""lawn mower beer", because it's got more depth and character than that. A great hot weather beer. Well done."
""
"O: There is a plethora of mediocre, forgettable and just plain bad pilsners out there, but this isn't one of them. It is well balanced, has enough body and flavor that I know I'm drinking a real beer. Definitely a worthwhile summer brew."
""
""
"Overal long story short, not too many complaints, but can't say I am excited about this one."
"This beer pours a clear gold with no head or lace. It's aroma is of citrus, dough, and grass. The flavor is grassy with lemon notes and a mildly bitter aftertaste in the finish. The mouthfeel is light. Old Dominion Beach House Golden Pilsner is a decent beer. Slightly recommended."

"Pours a lightly dulled gold color, little head. Scent is fairly weak and clean and gives notes of bread, grass and caramel. Taste leads with a unsatisfying combination of bread and grass, quite earthy and muddy, back has notes of the caramel, light herbal quality. Light to medium bodied, light in carbonation. Lacks the crisp, clean bite found in many pilsners, the malt and hop quality seems sub par."
"I picked this bottle up as a single sampler. It had a respectable appearance. Smell seemed a little off for a pilsner. Taste was not that good as it was metalic and bitey. All in all this wasn't one of the better pilsners I've had. Not very refreshing and noble hop flavors were not as pleasant as some of the other better crafted pilsners I've had."
"Overall: A bit surprised when I first opened this beer. I looked at it appearence wise thinking how this could be any good. But now I'm thorough surprised and did enjoy this summer time beer. Will try again soon. Cheers!"
"Overall: Ok pilsener but not in the class of Prima Pils due to the underwhelming hop characteristics of this beer."
"Could easily see having a nice session with this one or just drinking one on a hot day after cutting the lawn. Good stuff."
"This was an unexpected surprise. Well worth a try - in fact, this is one to definitely try out."
"Overall, this is a great brew. Its a great represenation of the style. I found this brew to be very refreshing and would surely session this during the summer months. Another great beer by Dominion."
"D. This is a pretty good beer, but pils is not something I would session. Its just to hard on my face. The bitterness is bitter, but not in the way I am looking for from a beer."
"Beach House knocks the hops out of pretty much any imported Czech Pilsner. Yeah, freshness helps, but a near perfect balance and the fact that it's brewed right to style make this one a winner all around."
"And the Leaving Falls Church uber-bender rolls forth. This abettor pours a clear pale straw topped by a fairly thick finger or so of white froth. The nose is nearly nonexistent...I think some flowers are getting through, but that's about it. The taste comprises wheat, corn, flowers, and a slight bit of tin. The body is very light, with a light carbonation and a crisp, dry finish. Overall, an average pils, really nothing especially good or bad here."
"Drinkability: The hops are surprisingly vivid but the beer needs more balance; not a bad stab at the style for a domestic pilsner"
"D: This was a very clean and crisp summer beer that was super easy to drink and fairly refreshing. Nothing exciting about it at all, but good to have on the beech or after mowing the lawn, etc."
"Drinkability: A great pilsner! This is a real pleasure to drink and goes perfect on a hot summer day. I'll definitely be having this one again in the near future."
"The finger + of thick, bone-white head sat atop the beer like puffy clouds on an afternoon in mid-spring. The color was a beautiful golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. The nose was slightly sweet with a cotton candy-like scent. Interesting. Mouthfeel was medium and there was no sweetness on the tongue. This was super dry, like the Zephyr winds blowing across the Sahara desert! Whew. Breathtakingly dry, literally. I was NOT expecting that. Described on the label as ""Our Bohemian Pilsner", it did not lack for Saaz hops either on the tongue or on the finish. I was left gasping for air. More please, sir and pass the pitcher of water while you are at it. I may need to rehydrate after this one."
"It has a semi-bitter taste that makes it taste like it's a bread, but that is due to the hops. It does go down easily and it's a beer that I will drink again."
"D = This one is a great beer to drink while bar-b-queueing, goes down easily."
"This pilsner pours a golden orange with a big ole frumpy white head that instantly grabbed my attention. Bear in mind that I scored its appearance relative to that of other pilsners. Lightly sweet aromas, reminiscent of a bin of ripe lemons. The taste is too sweet up front for my liking and I'm grateful for the lingering bitter finish that eventually balances it out. Overall, this beer is not a bad choice and would make a welcome companion out in the sunshine."
"Apart from the diacetyl, which hopefully is a single batch error, this is a pretty decent Czech-style pils. The malt is at the right level, bitterness is at the right level, and the hop flavors are at the right level. A little bit more hops in the nose would be nice, but OK. It's nicely balanced, and there's enough character to keep it interesting beyond one. Nice."
"D - A very good pilsner w/ fresh hoppy taste and a crisp/quaffable quality. I enjoyed this lager a lot, don't pass it up."
"D: I hope this is not a harbinger of the kind of beers the ""new"" Dominion lineup is going to consist of. Low flavor with ad gimmicks -- thankfully a low price, but maybe a case of ""you get what you pay for"" here."
"An okay pilsner, and I prefer the ones with a little lighter and crisper malt flavor. The hops have a perfume-like in the aroma, and biting in the flavor, which I think is the better half of the beer. The malts need a little work."
"Drinkability is high...pretty refreshing beer which tastes good. Worth having a couple."
"D: I'm pretty impressed with this pilsner - another well-brewed beer from Dominion. This stands up pretty well against Prima Pils - it's a notch below, to be sure, but it seems to be cut of the same cloth."
"Poured a medium yellow color with a small sized white head. Aromas of grains with some grassiness. Tastes of the same graininess, grassy, and verly light caramel. I found the body to be on the weaker and somewhat watery side. Some lacing left on the glass."
"D: Not sure of the alcohol content, but I do detect the alcohol, so I imagine it's at least about 5.5 or so... sure it could be found if someone looked hard enough. A pretty good beer, and something that would serve well as a sort of 'every day beer,' of sorts."
"Intense but drinkable, fresh yet balanced, beers like this one don't come along too often. That's why I was so disappointed when Dominion changed their Spring Brew style from the awesome double pilsner they used to have to that Belgian ale they currently brew for the spring season (though that one isn't bad). However, I think Dominion has more than made amends in my book with Beach House..."
"The drinkability is good as the whole of this brew is more enjoyable the is parts, Prosit, MK"
"Im gonna say pass on this beer."
"decent brew, nothing too special but with a name like ""beach house"" it fits the bill"
"am i really the first one to review this?? bottled on 4.7.08... they say they used perle, tettnanger and saaz, and it is quite a noble effort by dominion indeed. bright golden with a white head that holds on for a minute or two, and doesn't leave tons of lace, but looks pretty darn attractive. the beauty of fresh beer is here, so i reccommend getting in on this first batch while the getting is good. nice floral, grassy, herbal hop scent mixed with a hint of sourdoughyish bread that has a bit of sweetness in it. taste is similar. fairly well balanced, but a bit of pungent dryness comes out, and i'm having a hard time describing it, but it is pleasant and lemony, and kind of weird and medicinal as well. anyways... one of the best beers i've had by this brewery in a long time. a very easy, refreshing drink that i'll be having more of for sure."
