"I will just get straight to the point this is an average pilsner. A little better than some major companies like miller lite. I am not a fan of this beer. On a positive note this beer is smooth and crisp. Beer drinkers can enjoy this beer on a hot sunny day for something light and refreshing. This is my first czech style pilsner so take it for what its worth."

"Overall: a pretty good example of the style. I'm pleasantly surprised by it!"

"Nice to see what fresh, well made pilsner tastes like. Hop character is top notch, and it is a clean, easy drinking beer with no rough edges."
""
""
""
""

"The Verdict: Not bad. My descriptions may not sound exciting, but this is pretty much what a pils should be. Nothing above and beyond, but nothing to fuss about either. Just a good solid beer."

"O - Not a big pilsner drinker but I didn't mind this one. I don't have much to compare it to, but I wouldn't mind drinking it again. I probably wouldn't pick up a six pack of it, though. If you try it don't expect a world class beer, but its nothing bad."
"Overall- Great session beer, not tops in terms of pushing any limits on brewing. Staying classic while breaching new frontiers is a hard act to balance but Gordon Biersch is doing exactly that!"

"At the restaurant in Miami. Smell is much sweeter than I expected, with cloying funky sweetness on top of light malts. Flavor follows the aroma, with overly sweet flavor, almost like artificial sweetener in it, some hay and honey, bleh. Drinkable and light, but the sweetness makes it difficult to get it all down. Would not order again, but not a terrible beer if you happen to be eating there."

"Pours a very nice clean/clear golden yellow color, very nice carbonation, with a two-finger foamy white head, with some very nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, nice little hop note. The taste is mostly malty, with some hop notes. Medium body, the finish is slightly dry and bitter. Overall a nice brew for a hot day, but would not buy again."

"This is ok, but nothing special. Pretty average. Not soft enough in the mouthfeel or crisp enough."
""
""
"This beer pours up a light gold with a small head which has more staying power than the average porn star. Lacing is present. I really don't get much from the nose, maybe some grasses. Taste is mild but decent. It has a smooth lemony giving way to a mild bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel is nice with adequate carbonation. Not too shabby. Not world class, but very enjoyable!!!"
""
""
"""this is our most hoppy beer"" hahaha. okay. whatever. it isnt hoppy at all, but it tastes pretty good. the pour is clear and golden to yellow, with a gorgeous white head more than three inches high, foamy and lasting. more lacing and retention than usually seen from such a light beer. the nose is crisp as anything. sure to be satisfying in both winters coldest months and summers hottest. there is a lot of light pils malt, but its very fresh and seedy, from the field. the flavor is balanced, with some sort of goldings hops on the back end, but it isnt bitter, just sort of tames the sweetness of otherwise doughy malts. finish is super fast, dryer than it should be, but very very drinkable. the body is light, but not watery, and the carbonation is near spot on. bubbly enough but not laughably upbeat. this is much much much much better than i expected it to be when it was given to me by the head brewer of the syracus facility, who is a legend by the way. overall a nice americanized version of a central european classic. ill drink this again."

"This is a solid, tasty Pils. I would look for a stronger nuttiness and a little more malt in the flavor in an ideal world, but I could drink this all day."
"With it's taste that seems to be well balanced with nothing really taking over, I kind of enjoyed this beer that is well outside my dark beers and IPA's taste."
"Overall / Drinkability: Went well with a meal (crab cake sandwich) and drinkable enough I could see myself having another. Not a bad - not amazing, but not bad. Not the most flavorful pilsner, but much more flavor than others I've had."
"On tap at the Myrtle Beach location. Served in a pils glass. Was honey colored with a small white head. Smelled of pine and flowers and toast. Saaz hops are obvious when you take a sip. Bitter, spicey, maybe somewhere in there is some sweetness from malt, but I don't really detect any, just hops. Finishes very crisp and dry. Not a huge fan of czech pils, maybe is the saaz hops, but not a totally bad beer."
"It's okay. Then again, the San Jose locale also had an export lager that I tasted awhile back with a similar cooked cereal problem. I hope it's an isolated problem."

"O: Overall I thought this was an easy drinking, warm weather pilsner. Nothing earth shattering but a good summertime thirst quencher."
"O - I think this is a decent Pilsner. It's refreshing, no off flavors, and the price is perfect. Nothing outstanding about it but I'd pick it up again to toss back at parties. Worth a try. Cheers!"
""
"I had this at the brewpub in Tysons Corner with some delicious brunch in the early afternoon. It pours golden with a white head. The smell is malty and clear. It's a crisp brew, with some amount of hops, and a dry taste. I wasn't a fan of the mouthfeel, too dry."

"Overall - For a pilsner, this is damn good. Light enough to drink on a hot summer day, but full and flavorful enough to satisfy an ale aficionado such as myself."

"Overall: A nice Bohemian Pilsner. Best beer I've had here."
"Overall this is probably one of the better Pilsners I’ve had. It's nothing real exciting, but that’s to be expected with the style."
""
""
"Deep gold mostly clear a bit of chill haze. Clean malt bill in the nose, floral hops. Taste mirrors nose, pretty clean but a bit sweet. Mouthfeel well on light side of medium, dry finish. OK but pretty sweet for the style."
""
"Part of the mixed winter 12 pack. I enjoyed this Pils, it had the right amount of dryness to the finish combined with a hoppy nose and solid mouthfeel. Better than the lagers available in Maui (Kona,Maui Brewing)as it had more complexity. I can get this in BC and probably will pick some up for the Summer."

"O- Not my cup of tea, too light and lacking flavor."

"Pours crystalline yellow into a pilsener glass with an all too short lived cloudy white head. Smells appetizingly grassy, with a nice malty sweet backbone. Taste is floral hops up front--I'd be curious to see their hopping mix--and sweet malts in the back. No particularly outstanding notes to mention, just a nice, approachable, delicously standard brew. Mouthfeel is buttery carbonated with a crisp finish, kind of a citrusy bitterness on the aftertaste. Two best uses for this one: give it to somebody transitioning from micro to macro, or to a visiting German friend who wants a little taste of home. Only complaint I have about this one is the price."

"I went with an aggro pour, nearly inverting the bottle at one point, just to see what would happen. My glass filled rather quickly is what happened and once the swirling agitation settled, I had just over a finger of fluffy, eggshell white head with decent retention. Color was a deep golden yellow with NE-quality clarity. Unbidden, my uncle mentioned Croesus at Thanksgiving dinner unbeknownced that I routinely allude to him and his greed, especially for gold. Nose smelled of grassy Saaz hops and I knew that I was in for a good time. I love Czech Pilsners as my favorite style of Lager beer. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was of freshly mown grass near a field of barley. This could be especially nice in the summertime. It makes me wonder if their production facility has room for a CANning line as I would definitely drink this from a CAN in my cooler. Finish was dry, refreshing and a nice example of a tasty Pils."

"Overall I liked this beer with the caveats mentioned above."
"Overall Drinkability - Unrefreshing. Mostly bland and offers almost only off-characters in the profile. May be a bottle past its prime, because usually this brewery has gotten pretty good scores from me."
"Dr: Drinkable but simple and of limited quality. I wouldn't have it again, except maybe to have it on draught."
"o - Overall an average pilsener. Not much in the nose or the taste at all, but pretty easy to drink. Wouldn't seek it out again."
"O: Refreshing and easy drinking. Strikes a nice balance between the malt and the hops. Good beer for a warm evening, especially given the price."
"Had the Czech Pilsner at the G & B in Bolingbrook, IL last evening. The color was a clear golden with white head that laced slightly. The aroma was common of Czech Pilsners grain, hops, etc. The taste was powering with grain and hops....very smooth. The grain and malt was balanced nicely with hops and the beer came off the pallet clean. Overall not to bad...the mouthfeel was smooth and easy. good session beer"
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a rich golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of grains, just a touch of sweetness. Taste is crisp, grainy, some malts, a little bit bitter at the finish. Feels light in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."
"D - Overall I'm not very crazy about this beer; I would pass if I had another stab at this; probably not something to brag about, but wouldn't hurt to have if you invite guests over who aren't that familiar with craft brews"
"Poured a clear, straw-yellow with a fizzy white head. Aroma of pale/pils malts, hay, and light floral hops. Taste is light with subdued pils malts and an underlying metallic sensation, lightly hopped. Weak but balanced at least. Very light mouthfeel, somewhat unpleasant aftertaste. A drinkable beer for the unadventurous, but just not my style."
"Despite the serving temperature issue, this beer is still quite nice and enjoyable. It seems that the DC installation can brew a pretty good version of this beer as I am certainly enjoying this beer. I have a feeling that I would be enjoying this quite a bit more if it had been initially served at a cooler temperature (even if I am enjoying this beer anyway)."
"If you like mainstream commercial lagers, there's no way you won't enjoy this (if you're the type who sorts through reviews on Beer Advocate chances are you already know exactly how much you'll enjoy this). Bottom line: Gordon Biersch Czech Pilsner is far from the epitome of the style but it's better than many others on the market and, in a pinch, will do just fine."
"Notes: This is a solid pils. Light to moderate in body, with a crisp, dry finish. Not one of my favorite brews of this style, but very drinkable nonetheless. Definitely a good brew for a long Summer afternoon doing yard work."
" If it weren't for the the lingering malty flavor I would skip this brew. I find this interpritation to be similar to the true style but not enough to make me a full time GBCSP drinker."
"Overall, a fairly standard Czech Pils worthy to have as a stand by on a hot day."
"Served in pilsner glass this brew had a 2 finger clean white head with noticeable carbonation settling into a thin white cap. The aroma was doughy and had a nice what aroma with a slight hop presence. The taste was clean and crisp which is what I like and expect in a czech pilsner. The light body and clean malt taste was finished with a moderate hop flavor that was very delicious. This was a good example of the style and the better of the two brews I had at the location I visited."
"Overall: A good well constructed, fresh, affordable Pilsner style beer that may lack some balance but overall is satisfying."
"Fairly solid, classic soft malt bodied with just enough noble hops."
"D- Nothing impressive, can't say I would drink this again. Didn't even finish it."
"Drinkability- a sessionable beer but not tops for the stye."
"The store I bought this at appears to have kept it in the fridge the whole time. But how many people on the east coast have heard of Gordon Biersch? Aside from probably loss of spice in the hop profile, I'd like to believe I caught this on the tail end of its quality window. Pretty decent. Definitely tastes like a faithful take on a Bohemian pilsner."
"D - quite drinkable; session-worthy"
"D= session, probably good with most anything where Pils would work plus maybe with some roasted meats as well."
"Out comes a beautiful-looking Pilsner with a big head and a crystal-clear golden hue. Herbal, floral and spicy hops aroma meets the dried hay-like malt. The fluffy and crisp light-to-medium body contains delicate hopping with a long, drawn out floral flavor. The maltiness packs a lot of flavor with bread and grassy tones. The hop bit- terness shows some sharpness and spice to balance this brew. An excellent go at the style with a bit more body and less crispness than expected. Still so very drinkable."
"overall, if your at the restaurant, this beer wasn't bad, but again wasnt the bed Pilsner in the world, but was still a descent beer choice, worth a try"
"Very pale yellow clear colored beer. It has a pretty clumpy head with some decent lacing. Very few carbonation bubbles after about 1 minute past opening. It has a clear bready smell. It is very mild though and hard to pick up unless you are almost touching it. Taste is like most pilseners. Some more eccentric hops at work here, not just traditional pils hops. I'm having trouble picking it out. It's medium bodied with medium carbonation. I'd say it's a decent beer, but not the beer I'd order if I wanted a pils"
"i could drink these all summers day long"
"Sampled at Gordon Biersch restaurant in Dallas, TX. Pours deep-golden hue. Aroma is of hops with some malt in the background. Body is medium, crisp. Spicy hops dominate the palate with biscuit malt provide some balance. On the whole, it is nice Pilsener."
"Overall this is a nice Pilsner. It is nothing amazing but it is nice tasting and above average."
"D: Nothing complex here, nor do I think it was meant to be. I'm glad I ordered this one and I'd definitely get this again."
"Pours a bright clear gold with a medium sized head. Nice lacing on the surface. Smell is mild malt and a hint of herbal hops. Taste is light malt with fairly low sweetness. Some herbal and grassy noble hops. Clean and crisp. Medium bodied. Easily drinkable. A decent US made pils. Pleasant overall."
"Another 12 oz from the Fall Seasonal 12 pack Good looking true to style . Light golden, with a small pure white head. Aroma is also nice and to style bready maltiness, slight;y toasty Taste light toasted malts semi-sweet, slightly doughy..OK again to style OK on the palate..very drinkable. Better here, than the Oktoberfest..much better and a nice on this very muggy night."
"D- a nice authentic representation of this style, very drinkable"
"RJT"
"The mouthfeel is crisp and clean with light body and perfect carbonation. The finish, described above, is great. Just a smidge watery otherwise really great. This is a great example of the style and should be more appreciated by the BA community in general. It's the exact opposite of barrel aged, but somehow, when a brewery nails this style, it feels somehow innovative. A beer I would happily drink again and again."
"Appearance is light golden in color with a fluffy crisp head and loose lace. smell has has a loose Czech style with fairly clean grain and honey notes. Taste has a light honey sweet spicey graininess that finishes in a light bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a medium with good carbonation. Overall not to bad, just maybe a little rough around the edges."
"Pours a clear gold with a magnificent white head that stands tall and frumpy in the pilsner glass. Aromas of pilsner malt are mostly honeyish. Flavors are straightforward: honeyish pilsner malts with a leafy hoppiness that comes through on the midpalate and finish. Overall a beautiful beer to look at, whose taste is not bad at all."
"Not my favorite of their lineup, but passable."
"Don't drink and review."
"D - This is a nice representation of the Czech Pils. It is spicy and sessionable."
"Golden color...Medium cloudiness...More body than any other Czech Pils that I have loved before but decent amount of malty sweetness with ample lace around the glassware...Finishs with a hint of hop bitterness and a generous malt back...Pretty well balanced between the malt sweetness and the hop bitterness...But not what I am used to as being a Czech Pilsner"
"Drinkability: A solid pils with a strong hop presence. Would pair well with spicy foods."
"D - Their Czech Pilsner is pretty easily drinkable but there isn't much there. A decent offering that leans towards being pretty capable but just doesn't quite make it."
"d - a very nice summer session beer."
"Overall: Comes across very similar to Golden Export at first, but Czech Lager is definitely not as good."
"Same old song. The nose had a little more going, but overall another bland attempt."
"Medium body with light to medium carbonation. Crisp, dry finish. Overall, aroma was lacking but the taste was decent and it was extremely easy to drink a couple of these in succession. Really refreshing on a hot night."
"Hoppier and stiffer than some Bohemian Pilsners. Very nice."
"Buy Again? No."
"Pours a nice golden amber with a thick, white, fine-bubbled head. Aroma is strong, malty and slightly fruity. Flavor is malty and pleasant but a little watery. Texture is smooth and a bit thin - too bad. I do tend to discriminate against pilsners, but this one failed to impress me."
"Drinkability: enjoyable beer."
"Drinkability: Without that added zing of crispness, it made for a sub-par, hohum pilsner. Pity."
"Clean and golden colored. Not a lot of head or carbonation. Mild malty aroma. Malty flavor with a touch of hop bitterness. Has an almost ""straw"" like flavor to it. The hop bitterness tends to linger in the finish. Decent body-fairly dry and quenching. An ok beer overall. My first beer from Gordon Biersch-have wanted to try a brewpub of theirs for ages. I bet it would be an improvement on draft."
"Drinkability- ok I would drink it if there's nothing else but I won't seek it out."
"Overall: Not a bad drink, but perhaps not my favorite style. Also, this might be better described as a German-style pilsener and not Czech (Bohemian). From my understanding though, GB makes beers very well in the German style and have even imported many of their yeast strains from Germany."
"certainly will not seek out...but what's funny is as I have been writing this review it's already starting to taste better"
"This is a Bohemian-style Pilsner with a nice golden hue to it. It came across as medium bodied, and it was accented with a spicy hop character. Apparently the hops are imported from the Czech Republic. Usually I'm not a big fan of Czech hops, but this beer came across as pretty decent. It is certainly worth trying."
"Drinkability: Not the greatest example of the style, but very easy to drink; refreshing, too"
"Drinkability: perfect beer for hot and humid day in Myrtle Beach. Must try this one."
"Overall I hope this was just a bad batch but chances are I won't be visiting again anytime soon to see for myself."
"Eh, not my thing I guess. The beer didn't really have any kind of hop presence. Even the slightest bit more would've made a huge difference."
"The Gordon Biersch beer menu doesn't offer much excitement; in my opinion this is about the best you're going to get."
"D: I enjoyed this one immensely, probably helped by my strong need for a thirst-quenching beverage. It had pretty good flavor and didn't impart a buzz, which suited the bill perfectly. The flavor was a little weak though, so if I were drinking more than one, I'd probably move on to something else."
"Drinkability: May go well with a meal; has a decent flavor but not en masse"
"Not my favorite beer, or even in my top 500, but it is a decent Check Pilsner."
"Overall, nothing amazing. A good pilsner. It was priced well too at 6.96 a sixer. I may go back to this if I want a decent Czech Pilsner and don't want to pay for Pilsner Urquell or SN Summerfest."
"Czech Style Pilsner's a pretty decent beer from Gordon Biersch. I'm often disappointed in their beer, but this one isn't bad at all. It's a more than decent Czech Pilsner that doesn't deviate from the usual bells and whistles of the style. It's honestly a bit better than I expected. Obviously, I had pretty low expectations. Ultimately, it lacks a little in the depth department, but that's somewhat typical for the style. Not a bad beer. Worth checking out if you run across it."
"Beer poured golden with a decent white head that is hanging around. Nose is somewhat malty with no other distinguishable characteristics. Taste is pretty well balanced, biscuity malt backbone blends pretty nicely into a crisp hop finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, and fairly smooth. Drinkability is pretty good. This is a crisp clean refreshing beer that would pair well with mowing the lawn!"
"Shimmering gold color with a creamy white head. Aroma is light fruits with pale malts and spicy hops. Flavor is sweet malts (overly sweet for the style), some light but spicy hops, and a metallic, mealy, malt finish. Watery body with high carbonation. Pretty boring."
"For a light beer there is a lot going on here and this is a definite session beer. Bottle dated 01/12/09."
"What a nice find at GB when I was there for the Stickie Alt. This beer pours a medium gold color with a beautiful thick white head. Wonderful hop aroma, fresh cut grass? Medium body and taste that is crisp and clean with a light hint of malt and good hop bite. Beer finishes crisp and refreshing. Drinkability is good for this beer and it makes me want to have a few more. Very solid beer."
"D= An ok beer that suffers from being a bit too dry. Not terible though and certainly paired well with food."
"The third in the line from the 6x Sampler at the Rockville Restaurant. Bright yellow in the glass, with a very nice foamy head that laced the glass all the way down. Soft bubbles race up the sides. This one was the surprise of the bunch. Your typical imported Czech Pils is refreshing and drinkable, yes; but often accompanied by an annoying (I call it ""import lager cardboard"") aftertaste that makes the finished product less than perfect. My world-traveler kids have told me that even Stella Artois (on tap in country) is quite good; so I was pleased when I raised this one to my lips and found a very clean, refreshing (and fresh) taste. Extremely well balanced, clear malt flavor and a nice, fruity hops ""bite"" that is so well done that I found myself wishing I could have a whole glass of it. I am not necessarily a Czech Pilsner fan (nor a hops head), but this one really won me over. Would have been great with the food."
"Probably my favorite offering from the Virginia Beach Gordon Biersch, solid white head atop my glass of bright golden slight hazed czech style pils. Nose was packed ull of Saaz and herbal grassy lemon zest notes. Biscuit malts with subtle sweetness coming through. Flavors was all around solid not the best but well made and easy to consume, enought bitterness with the Saaz flowing the herbal hops and lemongras blend is great with the mild biscuit layers of sweetness I could drink this in session no problem, very smooth balanced brew that makes you appreciate a good lager. Mouthfeel is sturdy carbonatino but not overdone naturally produced and served from the serving tanks. Drinkability would have been more than a few half liters but I was able to make it back to the hotel room to watch the Penns and Red Wings battle it out with an amazing back and forth Penguins victory while drinking Sierra Nevada Summer another tasty pils."
"Overall- Good solid lager, clean and crisp. A good beer to start off the night with!"
"Enjoyed on tap at the Washington, DC location. Saaz hop bitterness, not quite, near metallic. Medium yellow, a caesar crown of white and lace. Medium mouthfeel. Off bitterness that makes it not all that drinkable.Under-average beer, but hey you need a pilsner in a standard lineup."
"D- The nice subtle Kolsh flavors of sweet sulfur like licorice hints are overpowered by bitterness and start masking all the other flavors."
"This somewhat non-descript European Lager is a fine and tasty beer that went very well with the grilled chicken salad, but pushing this beer into a better celebration of German noble hops would have given a crispness to the beer that suits more of the beer's nuances much better than the deliniation of Czech Pils."
"A seethru, pale gold body with some nice head. Like any pilsner, its taste relies on its hops and this beer is alright (think Pils Urquell basically). The hops are there with no real balance or mixing. A slick passing over the tongue with some hop backbite is how I would describe this beer, and not really seperated from other pils."
"D-I moved on after one."
"Overall: Nice tasting beer. One of the better beers I have ever consumed in an airport."
"Fresh from the tap, pours an unclouded gold, bright white creamy head piles high on the body, lacing provides a tight skirt to cove the glass. Nose sweet with malt, citrus like in its crispness, start has a pleasing malt presence, the hops delectable with their spicy bitterness at the back, top is moderate in feel to the palate. Finish has the customary acidity, the hops understated but pleasingly spicy, quite dry aftertaste, a nice drinking beer, good session beer."
"Drank a half-pint of this beer on tap at the 2007 North Market Microbrew Fest. The brewer himself was there, and this is what he recommended from their selection. Pours a clear, bright yellowish-gold with a fizzy white head. Pretty good retention. Taste and smell were clean and crisp, like a nice pilsener. Nothing remarkable. Balanced between a medium maltiness and a little hoppiness. Again, nothing stands out. Sharp mouthfeel, almost bitey. Overall, pretty easy to drink. When it's a little colder, it's nice and refreshing, but anyone looking for real complexity should look elsewhere."
"This beer had a pretty authentic euro-flavor, pretty light, but with a kick. Recommended."
"The mouth is a solid 3. The drinkabilty is decent. May be better on a very hot day. Not a bad cross-over beer."
"This was poured very nicely into a GB Becker, raising an off white two finger head, over a translucent, hazy bright gold body. The head falls quickly, though, to a glass ring. Neads longer head retention and better clarity. The nose is almost nothing to speak of, just a little malt. Not bad, just not there. Taste is a bit better, with nice edelhopfen cleanliness, but I feel that they didn't stick to just noble hops. It's pretty dry, not as balanced as it could be. I don't think the malts used are not up to snuff, either. Mouthfeel is just what I expect, though not sublime. A nice drinker, but missing some points, and thus average."
"This presents a clear golden color, with maybe a hint of orange. Nice frothy white head sits on top and lingers for a while, leaving a few spots of lace. Not much aroma from the pale malt, however there is a good amount of floral, spicy, and a bit grassy hops. The malt character is slightly sweet and dry, plae, and goes well with the spicy, flowery hop flavor. very clean and crisp. The hop bitterness seems almost perfect in this. Czech lagers are best fresh, and this really shows why. Light body, with a refreshing amount of carbonation. Very solid."
"Golden copper color in the glass, big white head, some lacing down the glass. Smell is lagery clean, with a hint of hops. Taste is the big surprise here. More hops than I expected in a pilsener, more like APA levels here, but the rest of the beer is more subdued like you'd expect in the style. Light mouthfeel, finishes well on a dry, hoppy note. Drinkable."
"Presented as a bright golden color with mioderate white puffy head. Smell is very spicy and hoppy. Taste is very enjoyable with a strong crispness and a nice hoppy bitterness, Very refreshing and thirst quenching. Nice mouhtfeel. Very flavorful. Nice surprising beer."
"Brought to the table a lovely straw-color with a finger of bubbly head. Smelled of hops and spices - cloves, maybe? Hops and spices assault the tongue on light malty undertones, definetely saaz hops. Overly bitter aftertaste, takes away from the good inital impression. Good pilsner, but nothing special. Couldn't drink more than a couple, a little too hoppy and spicy for my likings in a pilsner, but overall above average."
"I hed this at the Columbus OH location. Great beer. Not Czechvar, but close. Smooth and easy to drink. Very refreshing. I really enjoyed this. The hops (Saaz?) and malt are balanced just right for this style. I was told by the manager that this beer was going on tap year round, not just a seasonal."
"2004 GABF - Gold - Bohemian-Style Pilsener (Chattanooga, TN)"
"This is certainly superior to the mass-produced American ""pilsners"". Still, in the USA, I believe that Brooklyn and Saranac produce far superior versions."
"Comments  I have only rated one American effort at the Czech Pilsner higher than 3.0 overall (3.1) until now. Dont dismiss this one out-of-hand. Take it from a guy who has sucked down many a good European Pils  this is the real deal."
