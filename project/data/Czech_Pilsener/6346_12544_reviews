"A very to style interpretation, nothing especially stands out, it is clean with grassy and hay notes, easy and refreshing, but otherwise I don't think the hop notes are outstanding. A good pilsner but not an outstanding beer overall. Tasty and refreshing."
"Enjoy"
"Does not come close to a true Czech Pilsner but definitely drinkable."
""
"This is an extremely well-made pilsner. There is enough flavour for even this committed ale drinker. Much more flavour that most North American caft pils."
""
""
"No head. Medium amber in color. Barely any aroma, subtal bakery. Herbal with slight bitterness and dry finish."

"o: a flavour-packed pilsener that goes down really easily. the nose is a bit lacking but that won't stop me from having this a lot more in the future"

"Final Thoughts: All the beers I've tried from King have been excellent, and while this is probably the weakest link, it's still one of the best Pilsner's in Canada. If they fix the carbonation, and I'd say it is probably the best. I honestly feel bad that King doesn't appear as successful or widely distributed then it currently is. This one steps up to the plate where it really matters and I could drink this all day as a stand alone drinker or with spicy food because of it's cleansing crispness. Thumbs Up"

"Final Grade: 4.01, an excellent A-. King Brewery's Pilsner is a solid pale lager, and easily one of the best locally-made pilseners available in Ontario. The robust malt flavours are balanced nicely by the impressive noble hop bill, and the end result is a deliciously drinkable brew that is guaranteed to appeal to any fan of imported Euro pilseners. This brewery seems to focus mostly on brewing German-style lagers - a job they do damn well, I might add - but this Czech-style pilsner is probably my favourite of their three 'flagship' year-round offerings. I'll definitely be trying this again at some point in the future, and would encourage all pale lager enthusiasts to consider this one well worth seeking out."

"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."

"O: This pilsner has a great flavour with an appealing aroma. The crispness of it makes it a great beer to have when needing something to cut through cheese or strong flavours."
""
"Overall: An excellent post-mowing beer. Worthy of summer."

"Looks pretty spot on for a pils--crystal clear golden colour, thin white head with average retention/lacing. Sweet grains, grass, mineral water, and a faint hit of Saaz hops make appearances in the aroma department. Picking up some sweet bready malt up front with a tiny bit of grassy/spicy hop flavour. Mild bitterness with a crisp finish. Light and lively mouthfeel. This by no means blew me away but am glad I finally gave it a shot, would make for a fantastic quaff in the dead of summer."
"I actually like this, i could drink a few of these on a hot summer day with some BBQ ribs int he backyard for sure. Nice."

"O/D - Quite a solid Pils. Pushes the boundary a bit. Would have liked a tad more hop flavour, but otherwise it was really tasty. Highly drinkable. One Ontario can be proud of."
"overall a solid pilsner, pretty enjoyable."
"Taste - Bready and grainy with lots of spicy Czech hops. Hoppy but not really bitter. Finishes crisp and clean."
"Well done, King Brewery!"
"A simple yet nice pilsner. Good flavour despite the simplicity. Nicely tasty."
"O – Tasty for the style but a bit one dimensional and not overly mind blowing. I've had some more bold flavours on a pilsner, but certainly a worthy effort."
"This was a ice cold treat from the fridge on a hot day . Bready hoppy nose and a really well balanced lager that hits all the right notes for the style. Not overly hoppy but rather enough complexity to take beyond the craft take on macro lager that dominates BC. Better than Steamwhistle and one day hopefully available in BC by itself"
"Not a bad effort at all and one of the better Ontario-brewed pilsners I've had. Very nice as an ""ice cold on a hot day"" beer, but lost something when I tried it with a couple meals."
"Was interested in trying this as it has some interesting reviews and its average score places it near the top of the pilsener style but I'm here to knock it down a bit cause I just don't see it. Simple appearance, generally what I would expect from a macro. Smell is pretty muted, sweet bready malts, but not too much coming through. Flavour is subtle with that same malt character and a light citrusy saaz like hop character. Refreshing, in a simple way. Light weight feel on the palate. Overall, nothing I would seek out again. If it were a macro, I'd give it top scores in that vein."
"Overall- This one ranks right up there with some of the best of them, although I would have liked to see a bit more on the taste aspect, it’s very much dominated by the bready malts and not much of the other smells that you get really come through on the palate. Happy that I got to try this one because without the OCB 6-pack I probably would have overlooked this one and not even given it a try, but I could definitely see myself enjoying this one this summer while relaxing on the patio."
"Overall – I was pretty impressed with this beer. For an Ontario beer, it has a great pils taste that rivals some of its European counterparts. I’d buy this beer again and it will be perfect for the warmer weather."
"This is a terrific Czech pilsner, among the best I've seen in North America. Full of flavor, and a delight to drink. Shame that this beer isn't more readily available outside of the Toronto area. Shame!"
"d-oh pretty drinkable. I will def be buying this again."
"The beer is pale yellow color, almost golden. Nice white foamy head. The head is similar to a cloud. The aroma's intensity is medium. Cereal and malts. The taste is malty with a nice bitter finnish. A little bit thin in the mouth, feels almost like water. Very refreshing and well balanced. Quite easy to drink too. A nice beer on its own. I like it. Cheers Liam!"
"a great brew I've never knew existed and from my own backyard, thanks liamt07 for this one it's a winner"
"King Pilsner could better distinguish itself from other mediocre, mainstream lagers on the market by boasting about its specially imported Czech ingredients (namely, the hops) less on its packaging and more in its beer. On its own, this stands fine but in comparison with authentic Czech examples (and many American renditions) this falls a little short."
"This is incredibly drinkable, very clean and flavorful. I love me a good pilsner and this is one of the best out there."
"TRY THIS BEER. Seriously!"
"Overall, a great Czech pilsner. It sticks to tradition but really emphasizes and pronounces each characteristic while managing to keep itself well balanced and highly drinkable. This leaves me excited to try more of their offerings. Thumbs up. Another solid brew from Ontario."
"D: the standard by which other Ontario pilsners are evaluated, but I personally prefer more hops. Having said that, King's version is an accurate and respectable take on the style, and I'll happily buy this whenever I'm looking for a tasty, quaffable lager."
"Pours a straw-yellow colour with white head. The head did quickly dissipate with a very small amount of lacing. Smells strongly of grassy Saaz hops. Taste is quite Saaz forward with some bready malts. Very smooth. This is one of the best Ontario pilsners and I'm glad I always have access to it."
"Pours yellow and light golden colour, soapy white head rises and falls leaving an etched surface. Solid ring, some slippery lace, medium carbonation, bubbles a bit larger than I prefer. Grassy, skunky smell rings true to the Czech style, hoppy . Taste is sharp and crisp, nice bitterness, dry with huge malt aftertaste that lingers. Light to medium body, I've heard some say this might be the best Ontario brewed pilsner and I think you could make an argument that it's among them. Classic pilsner, nicely done, I'd drink this anytime."
"I guess ""Czech-style"" is appropriate, as it does have a number of the required attributes to justly call itself such, but there was just a little too much skunk, which can't be blamed on overseas bottle shipments/light struckedness, in this case."
"Libation: What can I say? It's a very good Pilsner in all respects. The expected Pils bitterness is very well balanced and tasty. The flavor is forward but doesn't overwhelm. I'll try to drink a few of these each time I'm in Ontario."
"This is a wonderful beer to drink on a hot day."
"Pours clear light yellow with white head. Smell - malts, spices, floral hops. Nice clean smell. Very good. Taste - bitter at first, than sweet honey notes, malty all the way through, finishes semi-dry. Very light, clean and refreshing. Great beer. Extremely drinkable."
"Volo Cask Days 2008. Extra hopped pilsner. Light yellow with some hop scent. Not characteristic hops come through on an average mouthfeel. Saaz hop presence. Worth trying, but I like the regular pilsner please. Quaffable. Hops is the taste, including the saaz and that's about it."
"Overall this is one of (if not) the best example of a Czech Pilsner in Ontario. You can tell that there is a dedicated brewmaster behind this."
"King describe their beer as super-premium, which is a heavy tag to wear, but they do it well. The brewers have managed to create a really authentic Czech pilsner, over 4,000 miles away from Pilsen. The dedication of importing the correct malt, hops and yeast from the Czech Republic allow this beer to stand proud beside other great brews. A very drinkable pils... of all the ones I have had so far my favourites come from Montreal and Nobleton, ON. Its a strange world."
"M/D - Light, smooth and easy drinking."
"This surprisingly is quite smooth if drank ice cold. as it warms the hops bring in an agressive bitterness that is not unpleasant, especially if you like bitter beers. Overall I'd say this is a very good attempt at the style."
"That said, it's certainly worth a try. And my mixed-feelings are perhaps more reflective of how I feel about pilsners in general than about King Pilsner in particular. A good interpretation of the style, however I grade it, and worth a try."
"Taste is a bit nutty, with a spicy pepperiness in the front. Light malt sweetness, apple-like, lots of grassy and floral notes, and a very forward bitterness that leaves you craving the next sip. Aftertaste is full of the spicy and floral Saaz flavour that I certainly crave from time to time. This is a well-balanced pilsner, very enjoyable, and has a lot of flavour going on. Mouthfeel is nice an soft but finishes good and dry thanks to the generous hop profile. Carbonation is mild and undistracting. A solid pilsner, one I'm thankful to have had, and one I'll seek out on tap when I'm in Southern Ontario again."
"This was an unfiltered sample on-tap at Volo in Toronto. This beer is very similar to the standard offering, but the hop character is much stronger and it's slightly hazy. The aroma is very floral with plenty of saaz hop goodness and the contribution of hops to the flavour is much stronger. Overall, I enjoyed this version more than the regular version... just a little more punchy with the hops and really nice balance. I'd drink this anytime."
"D: Quite good... summer thirst quencher."
"Pours a clear golden yellow, with a wonderful frothy white head fed by a steady stream of carbonation. A rather pretty looking beer. A nice grassy hop aroma with the Czech hops peeking through. Very nice grassy and moderately spicy hop bite upfront followed by a doughy malt backing. Nice mouthfeel, not too watery. A very solid pilsner. A nice solid pilsner. Perfect for a hot southern Ontario summer day."
"On tap at Volo, pours a clear light golden colour with a small head and little lace. Smells like sweet malts, little hop presence. But the taste is pretty good malt presence and pretty decent floral and bitter hoppiness for a pilsner, hops aren't magnificent but good for an Ontario pilsner. Pretty good mouthfeel, creamy and smooth, good carbonation and pretty good pilsner"
"Still probably the only Ontario Pilsner that approaches authentic Plzen taste profile."
"I find that pilsners can be very hit-and-miss, but this one is definitely a hit. Easily the best pilsner I've ever tried."
"This beer pours a light gold color with a tightly packed ivory head that quckly dissipates to form a foamy ring. Lots chunky patches of lace are left on the glass. The carbonation is quite active and the bubble are like pin pricks (a good sign I hear). The aroma is of grassy saaz hops, a grainyness and crackers. The taste is quite a lot hoppier that Urquell or Bitburger. Pine, eucalyptus, and saaz sea air hop flavors are very prominent. The malt background is very grainy with huskyness. The hops impart a fantastic bitterness that coats the mouth. The finish is very bitter. The mouthfeel is quite full bodied. Light carbonation seems to accentuate the hoppiness. This is one kick ass Pilsner thats full of raw hop flavors. My new favorite of the style."
"Drinkability: I could drink this all day, and I probably will as I have three more."
"Taste is a wallop of bitter that washes back into a nice finish with an aftertaste of bitter that lingers just long enough. It's nice to have a fresh pilsner. So often the imports are a gamble--will they or won't they be skunked...? So, a lovely brew that I think I'll be enjoying as long as I'm in Ontario."
"Drinkability: a very smooth and easy drinking beer. reminds me of Mill St Organic Lager....although it's been awhile since i've had that one. still, for a real pilsner have an Urquell, Czechvar or Kozel."
"Now I've had this on tap and from a bottle (both good quaffs) and have seen these folks at a couple of Oktoberfests and such. Just a quick note to acknowledge the good table they lay out when they're on the road. They dressed it up with hop vines, barley, beer books, beer wear and glasses. Interesting and well-presented and an indication of their enthusiasm I would imagine. All that and a decent beer too. Looking forward to visiting their brewery."
