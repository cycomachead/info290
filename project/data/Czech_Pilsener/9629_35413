Pours moderately hazy golden straw color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, grape, cracker, bread, floral, grass, herbal, light honey, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of malt, hop, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, bread, cracker, floral, grass, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, cracker, bread, floral, grass, light pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of malt, hop, and yeast ester flavors; with nice robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly creamy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish as expected of 5.2%. Overall this is a damn nice pilsner style! All around nice balance and robustness of malt, hop, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 17, 2013"

Very light body and palate with lingering bitterness. The bitterness is similar to that of a German or Scandinavian Pilsner, but the body and flavor is not. Not quite Kölsch-like, although the hops and bitterness are consistent with a Kölsch. Too low on hops and malt for a Czech Pilsner. Rings of delicate Belgian lace form.

3.72,4.8,3,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Clear as can be yellow. Decent carbonation. Has a hard time keeping any kind of head up. Small amount of yeast in the bottle- nice because the beer can continue lagering in storage. Smells like lager yeast, clean and faint. Impressive grainy pilsner flavors. Thin body and crisp finish. Has a distinct Chech Saaz character (I assume hop choice from grassy - peppery notes.) Mild bitterness, very refreshing. I usually don't drink excessively, but I gladly drink a bunch of these.","mlazzaro","Mar 08, 2012"

3.35,-5.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Pours out a golden yellow hue with a two finger thick white head that leaves minimal retention and lacing. I do get some grains, bread, some sweet malts in the aroma. The taste starts out with a slightly sweet taste followed by some grassy hops and citrus taste and some bitterness seems to be in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is smooth and slightly creamy, doesn't seem to be quite as crisp and clean as I thought it would be. A decent beer for what it is and worth a try.","DannyDan","Jan 26, 2012"

4.13,16.3,4.5,4,4.25,4,4,"Overall I thought that this was a pretty good Pilsener that was true to the style and it was pretty much everything that it should be. This beer had great drinkability, it went down very smooth and crisp, it was somewhat refreshing and would make a great beer to have with dinner, it was perfect with some fried walleye, this would make a good session beer, I don't think it would be that hard for me to take a out a six pack throughout the day. What I liked the most about this beer was pretty much everything, all the aspects of this beer seemed to be just what you would expect from a good Pilsener. What I liked least about this beer was hardly anything, but I did think it was a little hazy and could have been a little more clearer. I would for sure buy this beer again when looking for a good Pilsener, it's nice that this will be available year round. If you are a fan of Pilseners, then you need to give this beer a try, you won't be disappointed. I am glad that Short's decided to add this beer to the year round lineup, I thought that The Magician was a pretty average beer so I like the fact that they exchanged it for an above average Pilsener, it's a pretty good move in my opinion. So far this has to be my one of my favorite Pilseners, Short's really has some skills when it comes to this style and it makes for one tasty and easy drinking Pilsener that has earned a spot in my fridge.","StoutHunter","Jan 15, 2012"

These flavors dominate and almost need to be scaled back to make it more sessionable. Very similar to Trumer Pils (another favorite). I'll definitely try it again.","Phinner","Jan 09, 2012"

Refreshing sea air hops blow in and make an appetizing foil for the malt. Bitterness becomes peppier in the finish. Very refreshing and dry. Some lingering honey biscuit malt. Medium-bodied, with a smooth, creamy feel. Very drinkable and will be great in the summer!","alexgash","Jan 01, 2012"

This light and crisp pilsner, affordably priced at $7.99/six can really help bring in new non-tradtional craft beer drinkers into the mix. Hopefully after trying this, it becomes a ""gateway drug"" in order to be a little more adventureous and try new beers from Short's and other brewers.","BeRanger","Dec 28, 2011"

3.52,-0.8,3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5," light scent of grain that was the predominant player here no matter how you looked at it. Once you got past that it was easy to pick up a nice hint of banana in there as well as the tiniest bit of fresh grass like hop aroma. wheat and grain profile that was very well balance and very crisp and fresh. a tad musty, or maybe even bready in the flavor, however this was very crisp and had a nice balance to it. Up next were some more subtle fruity flavors, nice touch of banana in here to brighten it up a bit with something a bit tangy as well, maybe a hint of lemon,","mikesgroove","Apr 23, 2011"
