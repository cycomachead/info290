"Classic example of a Czech/Bohemian Pilsener. Beautiful in the glass, Noble Hop aroma for days, classic dry finish; an all around well-crafted brew"

"O: yet another solid installment in the pilsener family ... perhaps not my absolute favorite, but whereas some showcase more hops or more bite, this brew is a full-on fruity sweet version and would be a perfect gateway beer to the more bitter pilseners of the world. good brew!"
""
""
""
"O: This one is meh city. Not only is it not what I want from the style, the cardboard taste kills it even further. With Pilsner Urquell so readily available, I see absolutely no reason to return to this."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Easy to drink and refreshing though not overly complex or interesting. I'm not sure that I would go out of my way to find this one again but it goes pretty well with spicy foods."
""
"Overall not bad, nothing really ruined, a hint of sulfur note but not much if any, hops eventually kick in although not the same bright hops I remember from Czech Rep, but decent malt profile and lager notes, well rounded, little light on the malts and body though, but still just a step below most of the beers I had in Prague."

"light, refreshing. good summer beer. sweet smell complements and contrasts well the hop bitterness taste, really brings it out. not too watery, which is too often a problem with this style. i could finish a dozen fairly easily. i don't understand the appearance rating category. it looks like a beer, and short of having a thumb in it or something, makes it appear good to me."
""
"Drinkability: I wish it would have been a little grassier or skunkier, but it is tasty and refreshing."
"Overall: Not the best pilsener I've had, but not the worst. I remember Pilsener Urquell in Germany being better than this, since the fresher beer kept just the most subtle kiss of hops more forward in the flavor profile than this one."

"this is tolerable, i suppose, but after a couple plinys it's not cutting it. but to be fair, it's tolerable..."

"Pours a transparent straw color with a decent head of white foam. The aroma is very mild, smelling faintly of Saaz hops, vague sweetness, and some light skunk. Taste is almost nonexistent on the front end, consisting of carbonation and an indefinable something that's technically not nothing. Some honey-like sweetness emerges in the finish as you're still racking your brain to determine if you actually tasted anything at all. While the modicum of flavor that exists is not offensive, it's so mild that it's bordering on seltzer water. Even an American light macrobrew has bolder flavor than this. I'm an admitted skeptic of Pilsners to begin with, and this certainly does nothing to champion their cause."

"The fine print on the back of this beer's label identifies it as ""The Award Winning, Authentic Czech Beer."" Our postmodern world has taught aesthetes to be suspicious of claims of authenticity, for it is no indication of quality or aesthetic value. But I was surprised to read that this beer has won awards. Where? From whom? The bottle doesn't tell us this important bit of information..."

"The body is as light as expected but not boring, even veering toward medium almost, with a semi-dry feel as, rather than clashing, somehow a dryness mingles with the sweeter, maltier elements. It's consistently crisp and has a nice underlying smoothness as well."
"This poured a clean golden tan color with creamy foam. There was a honeyed sweet aroma on it, followed by a faded honeyed hop flavor with light bitterness. Not very tasty. Even going from ice cold serving temps to slightly warming a stale cereal malt flavor (“like bad Coors”) dominated. Pour or pass on this."
"O: A very nice and simple lager. I'd pick this up again for $2 per 500ml bottle. I'd love to have this with some kielbasa or stuffed cabbage with mustard, kraut and potatoes."
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is standard-issue for the style. If you're worrying that the body would be syrup-thick since the malts are so strong on the nose and tongue then fret not; it's still a thin-bodied beer. Overall, this is not a good pils. It is way, way too malt-forward, especially for a pilsner in the Czech tradition. What a weird beer."
""
""
"Overall - Not a bad beer for what it is, just not my favorite style, but I can't knock it."
""
"D - Very easy to drink."
"O- Excellent pilsner that I can only imagine would be better in Prague."
"Overall: Not a fan of the style but still ok"
"The brew pours a super-translucent golden hue and is capped with a modicum of white wispy head. The nose is herbal and a bit grassy, and has a mineral-metallic note underlying. There's also a soft powdery note in the aroma. The flavor is quite grainy and slightly sweet; it is mostly pleasant, but gets a bit of rankness on the finish. Feel-wise, it is lighter than medium and softly carbonated; pretty good overall. Though it is decent, it is definitely not a top-tier Czech Pils; I'd take, say, Staropromen over this any day of the week."
"O: A great Euro pilsener that somehow manages to beat out the local made ones despite coming from across the world, in who knows what kind of conditions."
"PRETTY GOOD, BUT NOT A MUST HAVE!"
"O: A bit disappointing. Missing is the hopiness of a true Czech pils. Your average German Pils has more. Fairly smooth but a bit more grassiness that there should be."
"Czech Rebel pours a dark golden color with a thin cap of foam above. The aroma is green apple and pale biscuit-like malt. Grainy pale malt greets the taste buds. A slight sweetness through the center as bitterness moves in. Finishes with a snap. This is a clean brew. Not bad, really."
"Dry finish. A decent summer offering."
"O: Nice flavor for the style. Would drink another."
"Final Notes: This beer is OK. Not great, not bad, but just okay. I won't be looking to buy it again."
"Loved the name if the beer. It made me wanna try it which is good for the brewery. But as I sat down to enjoy this brew I realized that I really can't get into pilasters too much. So I sat there trying to toss back a rather large bottle of beer for myself. Clear yellow and grassy and a fluffy head on this one."
"Rebel pours a pale amber color with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. At first I get a bit of bready malt in the aroma then some hop spicyness becomes apparent. Bready malt is most noticeable at first in the flavor, there is also a hint of caramel. There is a nice noble hop spice that is a bit muted while the beer is still cold. A nice sessionable pils."
"Easy to drink, could have more flavor though."
"Picked up a bottle at Euromart for a $2.25. The aroma is a bit simple with bready spice. The body seems just a little watery, but there's a great mixture of sweet bready barley with herbal, grassy lemon hop character. Despite being a little lighter than other Czech pilsners it's also very drinkable and still very flavorful."
"12 oz single.Clear golden coloured lager, nice quater inch white head. Subdued aroma, slightly grassy hop and some biscuit. A very balanced and weakish taste for a Bohemian Pils..there are certainlly hops..grassyand floral tastes and some malts..biscuit but its weak for some reason. The palate is boring but OK really..smooth. Not impressed at all one of the poorer pils from the Czech republic."
"DRINKABILITY: Nice, light, authentic Bohemian Pilsner. A decent value. I would try it again but won't go out of my way to find it."
"D: The beer isn't difficult to drink but the flavor isn't very interesting so I'm not sure if I will try it again."
"Drinkabiility- A good pilsner, didnt love it but didn't hate it. I would try it again but won't go out of my way to find it."
"D - Yes. This is a nice light beer. Would take a 6 pack out on a boating trip for sure."
"Finger and a half of cream white foam, the bubbles explode at such a fast rate you think Willy Wonka is behind it all, gone done to the surface like that, no lacing left behind. Light orange liquid, not pale, transparent with very mild visual distortion, a few scattered bubbles here and there. The nose has a nice liveliness to it, lots of all kinds of bread, like one big marble loaf in your nostrils, sweet golden honey accents, general maltiness then more salt 'n' pepper than herbaceousness, tame mixed white fruits, it seems like it aims to mix things together like a stew than let the elements stand apart. Medium-bodied, strong through the attack before relaxing and just letting it flow, unfold as it wants. Honey, molasses and caramel very obvious while displaying restraint when needed. The breadiness is more doughy than yeasty and had the crust cut off. A few corn notes. The carbonation somewhat lowgrade, not a deciding factor. More floral than fruity or citrusy. Hops bring tingle to the finish so it does end on an up note."
"Almost like a slightly under-carbonated soda pop with tinge of bitterness. Too sweet but so drinkable like soda because it kinda tastes like soda..."
"Drinkability: Not sure I care for the sweetness and wonder what is causing it but I certainly don't find the hop profile on this beer appealing, either"
"I was excited to try this Czech Pilsner, but that's where it ends. It's okay, though not worth a second purchase at $2.99 for a 12 ounce bottle."
"The Czech Rebel follows the tradition of the Czech Pilsener to a T."
"Taste is kinda weird, it's got a kind of mustiness to it. There is some maltiness to it but honestly it's not that great. Mouthfeel is light and smooth with a small hop bite. But theres just some weird off taste that I can't explain that's turning me off."
"Drinkability: Having enjoyed many Czech pilsners while living in Slovakia for three months, I consider myself somewhat an expert on the style. This one is a bit lacking compared to many, but isn't necessarily bad. Fairly average overall- I can't say it's not worth it, but there are others of the style I would try before this one. A real Czech pils shouldn't have the corn flavors, either, but luckily this one doesn't have overwhelming corn notes, preventing it from being terrible."
"Pours a light orangish amber, slight nose typical of a Czech pilsner, sweet hops and malty scent. The taste is very crisp and clean, lacks the depth of character in both hops and malts that some other Czech pilsners have, still, this is a solid example of the style and the kind of beer where you could have one, or two, or three, just about anywhere."
"An interesting pils, the corn flavor and aroma blew me away, maybe i havn't had a lot of Czech pilsners. Don't think there is any corn in there, maybe the yeast? Who knows, all in all, not too bad, but probably wouldn't try again."
"Overall, a decent czech pils but i've had better. I would like it better if there were more malt character, but more than anything more hop character would be nice. Comes to close to the adjunct category for me to honestly say it was worth eleven dollars."
"The only difference between this beer shown and mine is that mine has a gold label and is 4.8%ABV,it pours a nice golden hue with decent carbonation that leaves a two finger fast vanishing head and no lacing,it has a rather subtle aroma of grassy,herbal hops not much else gets thru,it has an average mouthfeel which doesnt have much body to it but is very sessionable with tastes of grassy herbal hops and some pale golden malts and by no means is this beer a brew that you would recommend to someone or remember but would buy a carton of for a party if cheap enough,its definately not my sort of brew that i enjoy drinking at home and wouldnt buy it again unless i had a party to go to."
"drinkability is good like most pils"
"A bit surprised by the lower ratings here. This offering alone shows me why Czech pilsners are renown the world over, and are drunken by the litre in their homeland."
"This is a fair beer for its style but the elements of age may be hurting it a bit. Not a good comparable to Pilsner Urquell."
"A bit better than the average pilsener. I noticed a lightly musty aroma late in the beer after it had warmed."
"Not bad for the style. Highly drinkable but likely too simplistic. I was hoping for more of a harsh hop bite. Absolutely worth a try."
"D--probably not, unless I crave a bitter, malty beer. Not what I'd reach for on a night out with friends or while lounging at home."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is very mild, some malts. Taste is crisp, slightly sweet, some malts and fruits, very flavorful. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and goes down with ease. Overall this is a high quality brew."
"D: This beer is enjoyable, and easy to drink, but there are others of this style that I would go for first."
"Definitely worth an additional purchase"
"Review relative to style. Pours pale golden color with beautiful large & creamy white head. Nose is light with a whiff of hops. Very light malt flavor with light balancing of hops. Extremely refreshing and drinkable, and far superior to U.S. comparables."
"Good looking dark golden clear bubbly body with a nice big head. Smell is floral and fruity with a dry biscuity backbone. Clean and balanced flavor. Some pine, lemony citrus cut nicely by a spicy hop bitterness and yesty fresh baked bread and sweet toffee like malts. Good sharp carbonation makes for a crisp and refreshing mouthfeel. Maybe just a little metalic skunky aftertaste comes out, but not bad. Overall very clean and skunk free. Probably the least skunk filled European lager I have ever had. Nice beer."
"Rather lackluster, this beer opens with a delicate grain character, very dry and cracker like with a mild husky flavor. Hop flavor is also quite restrained, there's a little earthy character. The finish is solid, a touch of bitterness appearing initially before a strange medicinal astringency appears. The sulfur character grows as it warms. Just a little thin and watery for my liking, the body could use a little more heft. Drying on the finish, this is an easy to drink beer, one that I'd like to try fresh."
"Ho hum pils. name Rebel is perhaps a bit melodramatic. In any case, a drinkable pils of no special attributes. Head is white and a bit of lace. Color is a clear yelllow. Aroma is crisp, yet slightly malty and hoppy, & beery. Flavor is about the same. Average body and carbonation. Ditto finish. Ok beer. If it had a different name, I'm sure I'd have a better opinion. Just me. sorry. Rebel YELL!"
"Overall the beer isn't bad, but I won't purchase it again."
"Pours a medium amber with white pillow head. Aroma is classic Czech pills, not overpowering, but a nice kiss. There is a hint of smokiness in the taste, malt sweetness, and finishes with a nice slight hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is luscious and drinkability is very high. Nice solid beer, an excellent Czech pils-though not one that is the typical yellow gold."
"Not a great beer, but i'd have this over alot of others."
"Crystal clear gold color with a creamy white head. Malty aroma with sweetish bready notes and a touch of grass. Flavor is sweet with toasty malts and a lightly floral hoppiness. Clean, somewhat watery finish. Some grassy and mineral notes. Super refreshing, pretty crisp."
"overall - A very underrated pilsener, in my opinion. It's got enough flavor to make it enjoyable to drink, but is light enough to warrant drinking the whole pint without ill effect. An admirable choice for a session brew."
"Pours golden-yellow with a white head that fades into a thin lace. Smells of clean grains, grassy (I guess) and a lot floral noble hop notes. Tastes mildy sweet. Pale malty flavors. Vaguely metalic and a lot of floral, aromatic hops. Noble hops (saaz I'm sure) dominate the palate. Slight bitterness keeps the beer refreshing throughout drinking it, along with the fairly high amount of carbonation, giving it a sharp ""nip"" when you swallow each gulp. Drinks easy. Not a bad pils, a fine standard example of the style."
"The also a a nice, characterful, yet light Czech character. It has a lot of lightly toasty bread, light fruitiness, with grass and herbs, light sweetness balancing a light, zesty bitterness. Although the sweetnes seems to just barely have the edge over the bitterness at first, beyond the finish the bitterness lingers lightly. It's light in body, but slightly oily, well-rounded in fel with lively, zesty frothiness, a very nice texture. Although straightforward and light, it has good flavour and light complexity and the character holds up very well, with great balance of the elements."
"Rebel is a very clear golden beer with a soft, dense white head that fades and leaves good lacing. The aroma is fruity, rather sweet, with perhaps a touch of funk. It smells pretty nice and actually reminds me of the way Bedele smells. It's pretty light bodied and a little papery, especially at the finish. The flavor is well balanced with a light, grassy bitterness, notes of lemon and pretzels, and a hint of sweet malt. It's better than most European Lagers I've had. It must be because of the brown bottle."
"Pours a darker yellow than other pilsners with one inch of white head that quickly settles. Moderate amount of lacing is left on the glass. Has a noble hop skunk aroma. A little sweet malt is also noted. The flavor is on the sweeter side of pils. Mild graininess and moderate amount of noble hop flavor. Nice texture and body to the beer. It is light bodied with carbonation that is not harsh. I prefer my pils to be on the drier side. If you like them a little sweet, this may be an option for you."
"Overall: The mouth feel is carbonated. The body of the beer is medium light and the finish is tad bit bitter. Okay for this beer to be a good Czech beer the Saaz Hops needs to be more pronounced. I think I got an aged bottle of beer. The beer is bland, uninteresting, and okay at best."
"this brew pours up a clear golden color with a decent white head. nice lacing. the nose is dough, pale malts, hint of honey. the taste is light sweet fruits, hints of honey again, a tid bit of yeast, sweet pale malts, decent hop backdrop, light to medium bodied, medium carbo. Once a rebel, always a rebel..."
"D - Overall an unoffensive beer but certainly not a great beer. I'll finish the bottle but won't buy again, although if it was given to me I wouldn't refuse it. It was $1.69 for a 16.9oz bottle so I figured I had nothing to lose."
"3.5/3.5/4/3.5/4"
"poured from a 16.9 oz brown bottle with no freshness date. a clear honey color with a thin head and thin sheet of lace. fresh grain aroma with a slightly sweet malt tea taste, some herbal and spice present and slight metallic note. mouthfeel light to medium carbonation a little flat. easy to drink would make a good session beer."
"Drinkability- Earthiness detracts from drinkability."
"D: One of the best Czech pils I've had from across the pond. Once poured and tasted, I had a craving for more. Got to go back and buy a 6-pack, as I only bought this lone single. Refreshing on this hot January night."
"I began a sushi-eating, beer drinking, presidential inauguration watching session with this beer the other day. Poured a clear gold with a small white head. More colorful than most pilseners. Aromas was faint but good: grassy hops and honeysweet malts. Lovely taste: perfectly balanced light malts with a grassy hop finish. Well-crafted, light body. Eminently drinkable and refreshing; an excellent way to kick off a session. A solidly made, flavorful pilsener."
"D: This beer has some decent attributes, and is certainly easy to drink, but it's just not that interesting in the taste department."
"D: Just an OK Czech Pils. Easily sessionable and would pick it over the run of the mill American Macro lager or Pils"
"Oh, I see it's only 4.4%, no wonder. Well, it sure wouldn't be a session brew for me."
"Nikki"
"Pours deep clear gold with a one-finger white head. Plentifully laced. Aroma is very floral hoppy for a Pils and not a trace of skunk. Must be a fresh one. Taste is full on Saaz type hops with just a hint of sweet malts. A bit of bread with just a touch of butter. Mouthfeel is about right and the drinkability is awesome thanks to the 4.4% abv. The Czechs make excellent beer! The label says ""since 1333"". That is an old brewery!"
"D- Chuggalugg. Definite session beer"
"my friend paul and i used to get these on queens blvd for 99 cents alot, a few years ago. no glass to pour into, just bottle. always impressed us, especially at the price. we used to pack a bag full with 16 or so and go to town. I don't know if he still drinks them-being in hell a and all. I stopped drinking them because I came across uniformaly skunky ones all the time. it was a good ride in the late 90's, but I awitched to ballantine ale after all the pepe le pew. none the less, it had a great price and great drinkability in its time. another friend, who is czech still swears by these, and brings a case to most bbqs. not that easy to find in the five boros anymore, but i think i will seek one out as i'm getting sentimental writing this thing."
"I poured this cheap looking beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer had a nice golden color and that was all that was nice. The smell was slightly sour and I thought the taste was sour or flat also. The head was nonexistant as was any lacing. Very poor quality beer and I will not buy again."
"This beer looks great, is crystal clear and has a decent head on top. Her nose is a bit timid, and could use some kick. Perhaps some additional Nobel or Saaz hops are in order. Flavor is OK but when in the same game as many great Czech Pilseners, you really have to be on your toes, and this beer fall a bit short. But, after a few more drinks I am getting into the beer more and I would say that It's worth a go. If you a fan of pilseners don't pay to much attention to ratings, just give it a go and decide for yourself."
"A very drinkable pilsner. Perfect for a hot day or with a light meal."
"D: Good drinkability, crisp, with a great grain palate and soft hopping that is perfectly fitted to style. An easy session and dare I say case worthy. Honestly this beer went down before I even realized it, was that smooth."
"Pours to a thick bubbly head that falls to a thin layer and leaves plenty of lace. Color is deep golden. Aroma is of sweet pilsner malt and a bit of spicy Czech hops and a little butter. Flavor is a nice balance of Saaz hop flavor and aroma and clean, light malt sweetness. finishes with a nice dry bitterness. Pretty good stuff. I appreciated the slight buttery (diacetyl) taste which is reminiscent of what Pilsner Urquell used to be."
"MF&D - Light, crisp and easy drinking."
"Light to medium bodied mouthfeel, no alcohol detectable, very refreshing stuff and a good depiction of the style..."
"Clean, clear pale golden yellow. Strawish, you might say. Small, yet persistent, eggshell white head. Nose of honey-tinged malts, powdered sugar, sourdough starter, big Saaz-y hops. A little skunkiness, but also very sea-air like. Smells good! Starts with lightly toasted biscuit malt. Some tangy hop flavor in there as well. Bready middle, with hints of cardboard, honey, and fruit (apples, pears). Skunky, funky hop bitterness increases toward a dryish finish. Not bad, but could do without the wet cardboard. Light-bodied, with a refreshing, sparkling feel. Might be better fresh."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. Poured a clear golden orange with a good bit of carb although the 1/2 inch white head disappeared as quick as it formed. Smelled like a typical lager with minimal hops coming through, nothing much to speak of there. The taste was decent though very faint. Slight hop bite with apple, pear type sweetness. Heavy on the carb but it suits this beer well. Light, crisp and easy drinking. Not overly flavorful but would definitely pair nice with some brats, onions and kraut. Throw in a hot summer day and this could make due."
"Half-liter bottle with no visible freshness date. There are visible protein clumps in the bottle, but there are almost none after the pour, though it does look unfiltered. The beer is solid gold, with low carbonation and three fingers of frothy white head that leaves a few rings of lace. In the nose it's mildly hoppy with a light dose of malts - not too aromatic, but pleasant. Tastes of nice noble hops and a bit of sweet malts. Grassy and spicy, with light lemon and pine, a little doughy, with a near medium bitterness on top of a light, dry body that has a lightish, hoppy finish. Not the best pilsner, but it's a very pleasing lager that is easy to session. Cheap and worth a try."
"On-spot for a classic pils overall. If the taste matched the aroma better - well, that would make for a better brew, but as it is its a classic refresher."
"Pours a clear amber with no head. Nose is like dirty grains. Flavor carries a slight body and then goes metallic on me real quick. I have a feeling this might be drain pour very soon. Feel has a nice bubble on it, but a thin liquid feel. Overall. Not very good. Wouldnt suggest it and not sure it is even worth trying. Pass."
"try."
"A rebel beer this isn't, just your average european lager."
"Nice golden brown color and plenty of carbonation. I used to buy this frequently because it was only 2 bucks for a 16.9 bottle. Of course with prices going up, it is no longer only 2 bucks. Anyways... It wasn't something that you would go out of your way for, but it did have some nice qualities that you would consider picking up a bottle or two along with a 6pk of something else."
"I had left Rebel alone after a couple of not-so-good bottles. After this one, I will definitely be drinking it again."
"No bad after taste, goes down easy. But after you are done, you just want to say, ok, what's next."
"Got this one at a beer tasting. No real head on a standard golden looking beer. Nose is fruit, some light spice. Flavor is mediocre, grain and malt. Mouthfeel is medium, standard for the type. Overall, a mediocre beer, not one I'd seek out by any means."
"Pours a very dark gold color, perfectly clear, with only a minimal dusting of head. Smells like a typical, but uninspired, pilsner -- a touch of tangy hops, but not enough to make things distinctive, alongside some insipid, sour malt smells. On the palate, good bitterness first off, framed by dry, bready malts at the mid-palate. The finish is nicely dry, but the aftertaste is quite unpleasant -- kind of a vegetal and acrid. Overall, an OK pilsner with some serious flaws, but nothing to shout about and nothing to purchase again."
"On the whole, this is a drinkable beer. Not spectacular but refreshing with a nice biting presence. Good for a warm summer day, and possibly quite sessionable due to the lower abv."
"For the price, it can't be beat. Get Budvar or Krusovice if you are not being cheap though."
"A little thin and weak, but easy to throw down at the end of the night or on a hot summer afternoon, and at 1.29 for a half litter, the price is right."
"Poured a clear copper color with a small white head that didn't leave much lacing. Has a sweet malt, bready smell to it, not much in the way of hops. Has a sweet malt flavor, almost caramel, followed by nice hop flavor. The hop is not as pronounced as Amercian pilsners but it adds to the drinkability. Has a light mouthfeel but not watery, no dryness to be detected. Not as zesty as I would have thought but it has a nice subtle hop flavor."
"A quite hoppy Pils with little malt balance. The appearanc eis golden with and nice hoppy nose and yes the hops do dominate this brew. As said before quite hoppy so not the best balance for this Pils. Smooth moutheel silky yet cleansing and astringent. The pucker at the end leave the drinkability a little lower than other Pils."
"Opinion: This is an OK beer. It has a bit of a harsh aftertaste for such a light beer. I don't really get any adjuncts here, but I suspect that the water in Pilsen has changed a bit since this style was created. It has a bitter edge like there was Gypsum used in this beer to make up for the Calcium. Bad choice if that was the case. I will drink this whole beer, but I won't be drinking it much more in the future"
"Overall a nice Czech Pils. I have passed this beer by so many times in the supermarket and am glad I finally tried it. A nice refreshing brew."
"this has become my summer goto beer. cheap and good."
"This is a beer I have been meaning to try for a while and Im glad I finally did. I havent tried a Czech beer that I havent liked yet but this was one of the best that Ive tried. Highly recommended if you dont mind a little skunk."
"Taste is average. Clean and crisp, with hops in the background. Nothing special that sets this apart. Still, it's a decent beer that fits in the style. Perhaps it got spoiled coming overseas."
"Decently drinkable and refreshing."
"Yeah, this a review from memory, but I used to buy this by the case, so trust me. I really can only tell you that to my taste buds, pilsner taste either bad, good or very good. Most taste bad, they reminde me of lawnmower beer, this one tastes good and occationally I've had an excellent pilsner, but only from tap. From a bottle, pilsner can only be so good and I think Rebel is as close to that limit as I've had."
"though it could use being turned up a notch."
"The taste is crisp and very bitter. I wish Miller and their ilk would spring for $1.19 on this bad boy and take some notes. This is how pilsners are done. A hoppy bitterness stays with the tastebuds long after the beer is gone. The quality water adds to the surprisingly smooth mouthfeel. If you like Czech pilsner like I do you can drink these all night..mint.."
"Very drinkable and highly underrated."
"This beer was not at all skunked. It poured a golden amber, and it left a thin white head. The taste was clean and pretty dry. I recommend this beer, but it's hard to make sure that it hasn't skunked. If you can find a fresh bottle, then you should give it a try. You'll be pleased."
"Pours a clear pale amber color with a foamy white head that settles into a thin lace. Nose is stale grains along with some mineral notes. Taste begins with a light caramel maltiness followed by some grassy and herbal hops towards the end leading to a rather crisp finish. A pretty average pilsner thats certainly enjoyable on a hot summer day, though better choices are not hard to find."
"Golden yellow with a sticky white head. Has good head retention. Smells like spicy saaz hops and grains. Has a meduim-light body with a little bit of carbonation that can be felt on the tounge. Taste clean with a spicy saaz hop up front and a grainy metallic finish. Rebel is true to the style and goes great with any heavy meal."
"Overall, a fine beer. I've got to take off a few points for the relatively minimal smell, but quite good."
"The bottle says that the brewery was founded in 1333, and I think I must have just tried one of their very first beers ever made, from around the same date. Atleast thats the way it tasted... Pure Skunk. The ridiculous amount of skunk flavor was so intense that it overwhelmed every aspect of the beer. I didnt pour it, so I cant say anything about the appearance, but all I could smell was putrid skunk, and all I could taste was bitter skunk. As soon as I took a sip my girlfriend said she could smell my skunk breath from the other side of the house. I'm not sure if this beer was really meant to be this way or if I just ran into an outrageously old bottle. I may try again just to see."
"Drinkability/notes: The heavy-handed use of hops spoiled my enjoyment of what would have otherwise been a pleasant beer. Czechvar is a much more pleasing example of the style."
"There are 3 inches of creamy white, bubbly fluffy head that leave crusty, sticky lacing. The beer is a very clear, rich gold. Big Saaz nose: spicy, almost cinnamon. Very nice. Starts crisp, fresh, fruity with some serious caramel through the faint, tingly middle. Finishes nicely bitter, dry, crackers. Some nice grain. Not bad at all. Some nice caramel and grain with temperature. I like it."
"Overall Impression: A good Pils. Clean, full, refreshing, its everything it should be. I feel like my scores are for the style more than the beer, this one is well made. Thanks to BA Pegasus for dropping one off for me to try, and to BA assurbanipaul for recommending it."
"As a Czech lager this suffers in comparison to its competition, but it's not without its merits; and to be fair, there is some stiff competition! It's crystal-clear, golden body is quite attractive; and it's frothy bright-white head holds a short lid fairly well but leaves only minor spotty lace about the glass. The nose is bold with a combination of grainy malt and some spicy, floral, and mildly grassy hops. The flavor delivers a nicely balanced combination of grainy malt and spicy, herbal, and floral hops. A solid bitterness permeates it, and leaves it dry in the finish with some lingering hops. There are better examples of the style available at the same price; but it remains an enjoyable pils in it's own right."
"An OK beer, but I don't think I'll ever have another."
"This brew is a pale straw gold color, with a white bubbly head topping it off. Sweet malt and spicy hops combine for the aroma. Sweet malt up front, clean grains, blended bitter hop backbone. Fairly creamy mouthfeel. Some sort of weird aftertaste takes off a couple points, but overall not bad."
"Mouthfeel is rather light with active carbonation, a very fresh bottle. Refreshing and easy to drink, this tastes like what I think an Urquell should taste like. Nice to see another pils selection in this area."
"One of the better Czech pilsners available in the US. Drier than Pilsner Urquell, with perhaps a touch more hops. Bohemiam pilsners aren't my favorite style, but every now and their their delicate subtlety is appealing."
"Light to medium bodied, I wouldn't bother trying it again."
"I have no major quarrels with the beer. It's look, smell, taste and feel is all there. Granted, it's nothing to sing about, but it doesn't dissapoint. Bottle is drained with ease."
"Deep dark golden yellow. Strong odor of cheap skunky beer, like bud. Very little head. Smell is overwhelming while the taste is barely there. Sharp bite on the mouthfeel. Starts out bitter; slightly sweet in the middle and on the very short finish. Not impressed yet somehow less bad than I expected."
"Great bitter hop overtones in the mouth and a medium body. Medium carbonation. As it warms, it develops a bizarre ginger ale taste, which I enjoyed. Aftertaste is weak and metallic, which makes it sound like it's strong and powerful--but really it's not that good."
"This beer is a very clear golden color. The white head did not last long at all. There is light hop aroma with a little malt also. This beer starts out very crisp then slightly malty with an odd finish. A pretty average easy drinking beer."
"The after its release from the 12-ounce green bottle sets in the glass a luminous gold with a mountainous bright white head that is frothy in texture and the lace a fine covering upon the glass. Nose is sweet malt, fresh and clean to the senses, start quite sweet, fair malt profile and the top thin. Finish is moderate in its acidity, the hops apropos to the style, drinkable but not anything special."
"Not a bad beer by any means. I'm not the biggest fan of pilsners, but this may just be one of the best beers you can drink while sitting alongside the pool. Comfortable and easy going."
"I had some high expections going in with this beer, but this has seriously let me down. Poured out a light golden color with a decent amount of carbonation. Looked nice actually. Smell wasn't that great. Some hops were detected but that was it. Taste was the same as smell. Some hop bite was noticable along with some metallic flavors which lasted into the aftertaste. I was really expecting more from this beer, perhaps it was a bad bottle, some skunkiness was in the aroma, but this was a let down for sure. Try it at your own risk."
"This is a session beer, of that there is no doubt!!!"
"I've heard so many good things about Czech beer, but Rebel is almost certainly not one that aficionados have in mind when praising the brewmasters from that country."
"Drinkability: It's a good, solid lager, but I think I'd grow bored with it in short order. Then again, I feel that way about most pilsners, so take that with a grain of salt."
"Drinkabilty: Good session beer. This is light enough in flavor to never overwhelm, but still a little boring sometimes."
"I happen to believe that a lager should be clear. That's part of its charm. This beer is unfiltered which detracts from its appeal. Many of the properties common to most Czech lagers are repeated here. The color, the aroma, taste -- been there, done that. This is not a bad beer, but the flavor is off a note and there are otherwise no special attributes to be found. This is a run-of-the-mill lager that fails to distinguish itself from a sea of more worthy contenders."
"**Pocket A's in one hand, Czeck Rebel Beer in the other**"
"Flavor is slight but complex-- dextrin, followed by a bright hoppy note and a mellow long slide toward bitterness as the sip leaves the tongue. Very drinkable, goes with anything, and the price is pretty good."
"Notes: Aside from the TOTAL LACK OF HEAD this is a wonderful beer I think I might even buy again. Was there soap in my glass or something? I'll give it another review when I drink it again. If you like a good, clean pilsner and dig your hops - this is a great one."
"This was my first taste of Czech beer, and if this one is any sign of there quality, I will probably keep my distance. I didn't expect this to blow me away, but I was hoping for a nice pilsner. First of all, I am not sure if I got a bad bottle, but this was VERY flat. There was literally no head what so ever. And it sure isn't hard to produce a head in a pilsner glass. Secondly, it just reminded me of something that you would buy in 30 packs at the grocery store for $8.99. I can't say that it was disgusting at all, but it had absolutely nothing special about it and what it did have in its body was even weak."
"The beer pours a pale golden color with a spotty lace head. The aroma is good . There is the presence of pale malts and Czech style aroma hops. The taste is decent, but not great. This is a very clean tasting beer. It's not at all complex in malt composition, but it goes down easy. The mouthfeel is good. It has just the right amount of carbonation and is low bodied. This is a good drinking beer."
"Served in a .5 liter Euro-style bottle, cool red lettering. Pours a beautiful gold, but the head sucks. Smells vaguely of hops, but nothing bold. Tastes hoppy and slightly bitter, but taste soon dissapates into nothing. Refreshing, but nothing outstanding, try it once at least."
"Not really all that impressed with this one. Pretty boring looking, mass produced appearence that some would call the color of ""real"" beer. See through pale golden with little head and almost no stick. The mouth feel is light and the flavors cloying, leaving a sticky sweet residue of skunk. Quite beer-less in flavor, more adjunct, metalic, bitter tinny tasting than anything. The finish is long and cloying so have food on hand to wash the flavors back."
"Poured nice clear yellow, head goes away quickly. Smell is hoppy and malty. Taste is like a lager. Roasted malt flavor. Pretty hoppy. Nice carbonation. I am not as fond of lagers as I used to be but this one is pretty good. Taste stays good as it warms up. That is more than I can say for most american lagers. This is reasonably priced for an import also-$6.79"
"Pours a straw color with a big head that goes very quickly,quite a bubbly brew.The smell was a little musty kinda awkword for a pilsner I think,thee is some slight bready aromas as well.The taste is a little blah,there is a little hop dryness in there with a weak sweetness to it.Drinkable but not overly flavorfull in my opinion."
"While not a top pilsner, this beer is not bad, certainly much better then mass produced beers in the U.S. Nothing special about it though, as it poured very clear, with not much aroma. Sort of a reserved grain like flavor, which blends with a slight bitter tone. Not much else for me to say, other then it was enjoyable, clean tasting, and could be consumed with ease."
"16.9 oz bottle. Poured a clear golden with no real head and no lacing. Aroma is faintly of hops and little else. Taste is a disappointment very little carbonation, weak and watery thin mouthfeel. Some hop bitterness in the finish but very little else. If I didn't know better I'd think this was just another macro beer!"
"Came in a 16.9oz brown bottle, no freshness stamp. Pours out a clear golden tone, big foamy head on it that lasted a while and eventually receded into a ring. Massive biscuity sweet malt nose to it, faint hops detected. Flavour of buttery malt, some floral hops and a metallic aftertaste that is then overcome by the hops again. It's crisp, I'll give it that. Very drinkable, no complaints here at all."
"The beer pours a fairly decent light golded color. It does have a bit of a fizzy head, however. Fairly decent hop aroma, although not very complex. There is a bit of maltiness and hop bitterness to the taste. Not up in the Budvar catagory, but overall a fairly decent quaff!"
"While not terrible, this has some critical flaws. There are many better bohemian pils."
"Ouch. Apple juice colored with a white, wet head that pops and fizzes like soda. Smell of bitter hop, pine, and skunk. Mouthfeel is slick, kinda watery. Head disappears quickly and laces not at all. Taste is mostly bitter, and skunky Bud-esque, right through to the aftertaste. Poured out half the bottle."
"It's very clear and golden. A ample 2 inch head of fluffy whiteness forms and lasts a few minutes. The aroma is surprisingly sweet, stronger than I expected. The flavor is very subtle though which I definitely expected. Slightly malty, and slightly hoppy in the finish. This is a very refreshing beer, a lot better than I thought it would be. I'll take this over any U.S. macro-lager any day!"
"This first thing that stood out for me was the smell. Strong and sweet grassy/oily aroma. The beer poured out perfectly clear and was bright and golden in color. spritzy head. The taste was decent, Good blending of hops and malts - a good bohemian pilsener."
"the package says it's brewed traditionally with open vat fermentation, locally-made malts, traditional saaz hops and long lagering time. i highly recommend this one."
"Pours a clear, light golden color with a decent head that fades to a thin layer pretty quickly. Slight musty malt aroma. A little grassy too. Metallic mineral taste with a bitter bite. The bitterness seems more from the mettalic character than hops. Mouthfeel is slightly thin, carbonation good. Not a bad deal at .99 a bottle, but I can't recommend this beer. Spend a little more for a better product."
"Clear, golden in color, with a white head. Large bubble of carbonation and a bit lacing are present. This brew has a semi-sweet, grainy aroma. The flavor again is of grain with a bit of sweetness in the start. The finish is abrupt and dry. The hop bitterness is minimal. I also detected a bit of a metallic flavor in this one. Overall it is a smooth, easy drinking beer; nothing extraordinary stands out."
"Big, foamy head, bright gold color. Dry, hoppy aroma. Distinct malt presence, slightly sour aftertaste. For a lager, fine, but not my cup o' tea, and certainly not in league with the Czech Rep's best pilseners. Not bad, but no better."
"A pretty nice little Bohemian Pils....nose is soft and sweet....very clean gold color with minimal head...taste is grainy...not a lot of hop bite, and tends to taste more like a lager to me........a good one though...it does have a slightly dry finish...creamy texture...easy drinking...thirst quenching...a good summer beer..."
"Can't say I enjoyed this one much at all. Maybe it is because I had my first Chimay Bleu to look forward to after this, but I had trouble gleaning anything positive out of this beer. This one was $1.19 as opposed to the Brou Czech which was $.99, but I enjoyed the Brou Czech more. Go figure. Sharp, sour flavor and aroma was weak. I am staying away from this one."
"A pretty average lager, but at 99cents for a 16.9 ounce bottle what do you expect?  This was very drinkable and light on the palate.  It poured a very light, almost clear, golden colour with a small head that dissipated rapidly.  This smelled and  tasted pretty average in my opinion, not that great for a czech lager beer, and no where near as good as the excellent Czechvar.  The mouthfeel was very watery on this beer, and the taste was pretty light.  Still it is quite a value, and it is a very drinkable beer.  Nice on a hot day!"
"""Obvious Turkish influence in this beer," I think to myself. My wife, reads my mind and asks, ""What does THAT mean?"" Images of Renaissance Mocha coffee traders from Beirut or Cairo selecting drier malt flavors in their beers. Hydrating beer. Good."
"99 cents for 1 pint 9 ounces? This is a steal compared to any American macro.  Refreshing, quirst-quenching, with a light hop, but decent malt presence.  Almost as faavorful as Czechvar.  I like this better than Pilsner Urquell."
"Real nice appearance in the glass. Calm, gold color. Steady carbonation. Starts real easy and ends with a hop aftertaste.  Good brew to swill and inexpensive too, which means you can swill plenty.  Unexpectedly good flavor from a cheap beer.  Goes well with a brat or two at a summer barby-Q."
"This Czech pils tastes, smells, and feels like a weaker version of its better-known cousins -- Pilsner Urquell and Bud/Czechvar. It has a nice golden color but the head is quite weak.  The aroma is saaz hops and malt, but toned down compared to the other Czech pils.  Likewise, the taste is smooth and malty with a nice balance of hop bitterness.  The mouthfeel is a bit slight for the style.  All in all Czech Rebel is a nice beer, but not quite up to par with the aforementioned beers from the Czech Republic."
"The beer pours a nice golden hue with a thin white head that has some retention.  The aroma is very nice.  As I'd imagine a Czech hop garden to smell like.  This has all the makings of a great Czech pilsner, but there is a slight soapy aftertaste.  It's not big and not real annoying, but it's there.  Otherwise, this tastes pretty damn good.  Some spicy saaz hop tones.  A good solid malt footing to work upon.  Floral notes.  Herbalness.  Really pretty damn nice."
"A darkish yellow sub amber color.  Carbonated, medium-sized bubbles, thin but persistent head.  Slight malt aroma, tad of skunk trace.  Very crisp flavor, retains crispness well.  Hop bite is more upfront. Pleasing aftertaste.  Classic Pilsner flavor profile, which leaves me with little to write.  Qaulity brew, refreshing, and certainly not complex."
"Very light bodied Czech Pilsner.  It is what the macro-brewers beer should taste like.  99 cents for a half of a liter (17 ounces), which is a great deal.  Highly recommended."
"Light gold, crystal clear.  Fizzy head that settles to a thin white cover over the beer.  Initially a skunky quality to aroma, then to a light malt.  Light malt flavor mixed with hop bitterness in middle and short dry finish. Thinner mouthfeel.   Enjoyable, but middle of the road beer for style and part of world.  Like the price."
"I really like this beer.  Not as deep as PU/Czechvar but there's no mistaking its bohemian heritage.  I always walk out of the package store with at least one $0.99/16.9oz bottle.  You simply can't beat that!"
"I didn't realize you could buy this here, luckily my wife is Czech so I have lots of opportunities to taste lots of Czech beers. This one is very good, not great but it compares favorably with others from CZ"
"Notes: Nice, light, authentic Bohemian Pilsner. Very refreshing."
