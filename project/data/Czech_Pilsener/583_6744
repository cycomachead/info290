Taste is also dominated by some grainy notes with a dry finish with light spicy finish. Body is about average with good carbonation. Not sure if I got a bad bottle here but this was not the most pleasant and I had hard time finishing a single bottle which is not what I was expecting considering the style.","Phyl21ca","Jan 09, 2014"

4.47,20.8,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured this German Pilsner from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. The pilsener poured a clear golden color, produced a average white head and it had good retention. Lacing was nice. The aroma of the pilsner had a nice malt base, notes of bread, and a surprisingly strong hop presence for a pilsner. One of the finest smelling pilsner's that this nose has come across. The taste of this beer is light in body, very crisp, excellent mouthfeel. There is a very strong malt base that lays the foundation to herbal notes, grain and hops. Possibly the best American brewed Pilsener that I have tried to this point- very well balanced, great session beer- Nice to see a craft brewer produce a decent Pilsner. Budweiser may be king in St.Louis...but "The King" doesn't have anything on this beer!","GossageBrewery","Aug 15, 2011"

Thick white foamy head that recedes to an 1/8th inch cap, virtually no lacing. I see a golden-yellow, crystal clear body with tiny bubbles slowly making their way to the surface. The nose is not forward at all. It takes some concentration from me to sniff up some subtle breadiness, and an herbal hop aroma. Flavorwise, Schlafly Pilsner is quite enjoyable for it's crisp, slightly sharp, yet balanced flavors. I find a slight grainy sweetness in the mid palate that works nicely with the sharpness that is probably contributed by the hops. I am left with a nice, quiet bitterness.

The flavor was pretty consistent with the nose as the grain dominated the flavor, but a subtle touch of hops carried throughout.

The palate is floral and herbal up front, with a nice smooth malt background, creating a very good balance in this beer. The flavors are subtle, but they are there ... unlike the "pilsner-esque" beers you find so often from the macro brewers. The taste is unchallenging, but full and smooth. The mouthfeel is light, carbonation active, and the beer finishes refreshingly dry - not overly bitter. This is a very, very drinkable pilsner. I think one of the better domestic examples of the German style. This beer has become one of my "staple" beers as of late. I try to keep it around at all times since it is so user-friendly and versatile. This is the kind of beer you grab when you just want a beer ... kind of a "table beer" if you will.

Man this is good; it's teeming with enormous grainy flavors, and the thick malty bread continues along with faint organic seasonings and spice all the way through the bottom of my glass.

I found the body to be light but not watery and it finished with a nice hoppy note. It also had a good amount of carbonation, but not excessive. My only criticisms of the beer would be what I have seen in some of the other reviews for this beer: that it could use a little more hops in the finish and just a tad more body. But, I tend to drink more ales than lagers. Great summer beer and it doesn't get that excessivly skunky taste you get with the imports that come in those damn green bottles. I live in St Louis and it surprises me that Schlafly doesn't market this beer more agressively in local supermarkets during the summer. I am always surprised at how many in the local area have their rasberry hefe and their american pale but not the pilsner.","beersgood","Aug 11, 2005"

At the apex the foam reached about two fingers in height. The head retention was excellent and the subsequent lacing was webby, clumpy and widespread. Overall, this beer looks fairly normal but there is nothing wrong with that. The nose really lacks in potency, it says something to the effect of, Im a Pils. There is a rounded breadiness and soft spicy, herbal hops with a kiss of lemon & lime. Saaz? It is a shame it is not more articulate. I cant call in inviting; lethargic is a more fitting description. The palate really isnt much better then the nose. Sure it is tasty but it is too weak. The best micro Pils Ive had was New Glarus Edel-Pils. There was some assertiveness to that beer, not so much with this one. Minimal bitterness, the hop flavors are herbal, rounded with kisses of spiciness. Too bad it is far to weak to be relevant. The malt offers itself in a bready, lightly toasty fashion. Again the flavors are too subtle to make a point. This is a facsimile of a good Pils. What a shame. This is a drinker, not a thinker. Give me this beer and a cold cut sandwich and Im good to go. About medium in body, moderately low carbonation, very fitting for the flavor profile. The mouthfeel is pleasant. It is easy to drink but its not tasty enough for me to really care.

Probably not..It's really more of a high quality American Lager...and at that it is very good...These are hard for me to rate because for the stye it may not be real good, but some American Pilsners blend into the Lager category rather easily...I'm putting these numbers down for an American Lager which I feel it best fits...and in that category it is really outstanding...a great every day beer...(As a Pilsner I would go 3.5/3.5/3/3.5/3)","ZAP","Jan 12, 2003"
