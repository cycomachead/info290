Poured a hazy golden color, produced an average head, nice retention, and it left a nice amount of lacing on the glass.The aroma consisted of fresh baked bread, and some slight notes of lemon citrus. Light in body, this Pilsener is quite refreshing and crisp. Very nice mouthfeel, plenty of malted grain some earthy hop qualities. Very nice session beer, would make for a great summer beer- a lot more flavor then a macro brewed lager.","GossageBrewery","Dec 13, 2012"

3,-10.7,3,3,3,3,3,"Purchased in a mixed 6 pack at Southern Market in Myrtle Beach. No dating on bottle and sampled 03-23-06. Slight hazy gold in color carrying a full white head that disipates very quickly. Nose seems to have a yeasty smell to it, some what out of place in a lager. Malt also present in nose. Flavor also seem s to carry on the yeasty tradition, then malt is brought out in muddy mouthfeel, lacks any crispness. Finish is short and along the style but leaves you wanting something else or possibly this a bit fresher.","jimbotrost","Jan 03, 2006"
3.55,5.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,"This beer is plenty drinkable, I could session with this beer. It is not the tastiest of its ilk but its solid. I like it. I sailed through my glass. Id rather drink a Helles or a Pils; to me All-Malt Lagers fall in the middle. This one wasnt crisp or hoppy enough for me yet it wasnt malty enough for me either. For what it is, this is a lovely, well-brewed beer. In fact, this might be the best of the style I have had, if not, it is top three for sure. Thank you timtheenchanta for the enjoyable South Carolina brew! Worth a try.","bditty187","Oct 23, 2005"
3.95,17.6,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"It pours a golden color with a frothy head that laces at first but then dissipates. It smells strongly of barley and tastes pretty much the same.

3.72,10.7,3,3.5,4,4,3.5,"It pours gold with a white head. The smell is a little light, but basically malt and hops with maybe a hint of alcohol. The taste is pretty well balanced between malt and hops and has a nice bit of flavor without being overpowering. Medium and somewhat dry in the mouth. A pretty decent beer to drink. If I'm ever in SC again I'll have another.","claytri","Oct 26, 2003"
3.83,14,3.5,3,4,3,5,"This is one refreshing beer. I think when I move back down to SC, this might become my new staple in the fridge. It's got a well balanced proportion of hops and malts, which are a little on the light side, but that aids the refreshingness of it. It's quite smooth and goes down nice and easy. The color was a semi-cloudy pale straw color with a fluffy white head. Tastes were of the light fruits persuasion mixed with a little bit of honey. I liked this one and I will definately drink more of this.","JISurfer","Oct 06, 2003"

3.85,14.6,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours out to a very clear yellow-gold with peach accents, forming a poofy white head with flocculent clumps. Retention is OK, and lacing is delicate. Carbonation is mild to moderate. Aroma is interesting...like sweet cornbread, husky pale malts, and soggy grains. Taste is also intriguing, with an odd twang of semisweet malt husks, butter, raw crystal malt, freshly cut hay, and catnip. Mouthfeel is somewhat bubbly and sharp, with a light body and toasty, semi-astringent finish. Tettnager or Hallertauer are evident in the mildly perfumy, yet distinctly noble, floral finish. Finishing bitterness is moderate, and the husks take on a subtle vanilla character towards the end. Dunlap hop sacks are evident throughout. Despite it's interesting character, I couldn't see myself drinking more than three of this peculiar brew.","Mitchster","May 21, 2003"
3.36,0,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Thanks to Msr. Kbub6f, I have in front of me my first Carolina beer. Even in my pre-BA days, Im not sure I ever had a Carolina beer. Is that a bad thing? This pale ale pours a textbook amber, with brilliant clarity and a really impressive, smooth, clingy, lacey head of less-than-white foam. A slight acetaldehyde-ish apple aroma under-rode a decidedly fresh malt aroma. A good dose of caramel maltiness (crystal I believe) instantly filled my mouth, followed by the same, slight appley flavor, then a long, bitter-but-not-very-hoppy finish. The fresh crystal malt flavor crept back into the tail, allowing the hopless bitterness to subside a bit. Passing half the bottle over my tongue eventually allowed some murky, non-descript hop flavor to edge along side the mild bitterness. While I liked the nutty, almost cracker-like maltiness, I didnt particularly care for the faint sour apple flavor and I was ambivalent about the bitterness sans hoppiness. The sourness was reminiscent of Bass and the bitterness harkened McNeils beers. The nutty crystal malt flavor conjured images of most American pale ales brewed in the English style. All told, this was a fine beer, but nothing exciting.","TXHops","May 13, 2003"
3.68,9.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Solid pale yellow in color with a thin white head that faded fast and leaves tiny strings of lace. Smell is of citrusy lightness, short, bright, crisp, fresh, and pretty soft. Taste is mildly crisp, light, with a crispy sharp sweet bitterness. Mellows out to a hollowness in the finish. Hops are a bit citrusy and lightly balanced in with the malts which lend to be a bit breadish and grainy. Feel is a lighter-medium body with a slight sharpness and lightly textures but smoothing. Not a bad brew, could use some added boldness and more flavor but still pretty enjoyable and drinkable.","tavernjef","Apr 15, 2003"

3.38,0.6,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Palmetto is one of those small local breweries whose beers I tend to enjoy. Had this at one of the many seafood restaurants that dot Charleston and thoroughly enjoyed it. It went very well with my dish although the waitress had recommended Palmetto Pale Ale. A good full-bodied brew with a nice sense of hops in both the smell and taste to balance the malts. Crisp. clean taste with a nearly dry finish.","AtLagerHeads","Beers"
3.26,-3,4,3,3,3,4,"A very average beer, but good on a hot day, I am sure. Not much taste, either from the malt or the hops. Nothing poorly done or sloppy, just not much to be gained from this, either when it is first opened or as it warms. Still better than an American Macro, but just not as good as the better American Lagers, like a Stoudt's Gold or a Great Lakes Dortmunder.","beernbbq","0"
