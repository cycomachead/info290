"Overall- I did not care for this beer at all, in fact i haven't found a Palmetto product that I am very fond of.  There are many Lagers out there that are better than this including the BMCs."
"Pretty average lager...not their best beer, but easy to drink and better than a bud light."

"O: A well-built traditional beer. I bet others will knock it for not being extreme enough, but to me this is a very good example of an American interpretation of an old-world pilsner."

"O- Not sure if this one is incorrectly listed as a Czech pilsner, but it tastes like a slightly heavy euro lager. Drinkability is decent, but the aroma and taste leave a lot to be desired."

"Poured this Czech Pilsener from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a hazy golden color, produced an average head, nice retention, and it left a nice amount of lacing on the glass.The aroma consisted of fresh baked bread, and some slight notes of lemon citrus. Light in body, this Pilsener is quite refreshing and crisp. Very nice mouthfeel, plenty of malted grain some earthy hop qualities. Very nice session beer, would make for a great summer beer- a lot more flavor then a macro brewed lager."

"D - Very good, lots of malt and hop character as well as a smooth lager finish. Almost like a pale ale and really quite good for what it is."

"O: This is better than a typical macro lager but nothing to write home about."
"D: This beer is quite sessionable and well-suited for drinking on a hot summer day."
"It would have been fairly drinkable on a hot day, if I was thirsty, but the taste was something I didn't care to re-experience."
"Drinkability is good. Its unlike what I usually drink so I could drink more than one."
"Drinkability: A bit too sweet for my palate, but certainly an acceptable brew"
"Drinkability: Not awful, but not anything special, either. Almost like a beer pong beer, really, though not cheap enough for that."
"Don't drink and review."
"A decent, simple brew."
"i was on vacation and i really wanted to like this one, but it's like the water they brewed it with was laden with things i really don't want to be consuming (or they used an odd yeast or i dunno what)."
"d: drinks easily, enjoyable in the heat"
"Even though this is an uneven beer, it's still somewhat drinkable. It had a more complex taste than I was expecting. Not bad."
"Light bodied, nicely carbonated, and highly drinkable."
"Good beer for sure."
"Overall a very quality session beer from palmetto. I could drink this as a regular. Very easy and very smooth. Nothing to spectacular or unique, just a quality lager that was brewed for that purpose."
"D - I could see this being a tangy summer party lager as a nice choice in a cooler with a few other ales. The drinkability for this to me goes up with the heat index and BBQ factor."
"I would certainly go for this out of a freezing cooler on a hot day in South Carolina."
"This beer had good drinkability. It would be a good choice as a nice beer you can have a few of without feeling really full."
"Poured a clear golden color with a nice head that fell slowly. Smells a bit of a sweet grain and malt aroma. Taste very well balanced some sweet malt flavors and a little grassy hop bite. This beer went down smooth and fast a good beer to have a few of."
"Thanks again to oldirtysurfer for sharing these beers with me."
"This would be a good camping beer. The beer is light with a thin head. The smell is like a mass produced beer with a sweeter ending. The taste is also like mass produced beer but without the harsh corn bite. The mouthfeel is smooth. I could drink this beer again. A sessionable beer."
"A very drinkable BBQ beer."
"This is a pretty good brew but have not had many of this style."
"Purchased in a mixed 6 pack at Southern Market in Myrtle Beach. No dating on bottle and sampled 03-23-06. Slight hazy gold in color carrying a full white head that disipates very quickly. Nose seems to have a yeasty smell to it, some what out of place in a lager. Malt also present in nose. Flavor also seem s to carry on the yeasty tradition, then malt is brought out in muddy mouthfeel, lacks any crispness. Finish is short and along the style but leaves you wanting something else or possibly this a bit fresher."
"This beer is plenty drinkable, I could session with this beer. It is not the tastiest of its ilk but its solid. I like it. I sailed through my glass. Id rather drink a Helles or a Pils; to me All-Malt Lagers fall in the middle. This one wasnt crisp or hoppy enough for me yet it wasnt malty enough for me either. For what it is, this is a lovely, well-brewed beer. In fact, this might be the best of the style I have had, if not, it is top three for sure. Thank you timtheenchanta for the enjoyable South Carolina brew! Worth a try."
"It pours a golden color with a frothy head that laces at first but then dissipates. It smells strongly of barley and tastes pretty much the same. The malts are balanced nicely with hops. It has a good body to it with even carbonation. It is a good beer for easy drinking without dipping into bud-miller-coors."
"I don't like Palmetto Lager nearly as much as I like Palmetto Porter, but that's probably the style difference talking. This is an uncomplicated, uncluttered, ultimately uninteresting lager whose quality I can, nevertheless, appreciate. Bottom line: it's a good, regional, 'wash down a burger' kind of brew that deserves some measure of respect. Thanks to WOLFGANG for the bottle."
"drinkability was very smooth"
"The last of the trifecta of Palmetto beers tried,poured a nice light golden with a pretty big frothy-like head,aromas are pretty grainy with a light citrusy fruitiness but pretty muted.Very refreshing lager with some nice qualities to it some definant graininess and a touch of iron finishing with a just a light amount of bitterness.A smooth easy ""sociable"" lager great for get togethers,maybe something to give a macro swill drinker so they can taste a true lager beer.Well done."
"This is a drinkable brew. Wish it was available when I was at school in Charleston."
"12 ounce bottle. More like an ale thatn a lager, but very easy drinking. They probably used 6-row malt on this beer."
"It pours gold with a white head. The smell is a little light, but basically malt and hops with maybe a hint of alcohol. The taste is pretty well balanced between malt and hops and has a nice bit of flavor without being overpowering. Medium and somewhat dry in the mouth. A pretty decent beer to drink. If I'm ever in SC again I'll have another."
"This is one refreshing beer. I think when I move back down to SC, this might become my new staple in the fridge. It's got a well balanced proportion of hops and malts, which are a little on the light side, but that aids the refreshingness of it. It's quite smooth and goes down nice and easy. The color was a semi-cloudy pale straw color with a fluffy white head. Tastes were of the light fruits persuasion mixed with a little bit of honey. I liked this one and I will definately drink more of this."
"Drinkability: For a lager, not bad. I wasn't overly impressed, though. I should say I'm not much of a fan of this style of lager."
"Dinning...yeah, ok...with fish. I hate fish."
"Thanks to AKSmokedPorter for this one."
"Big thanks to AKSmokedPorter for searching some SC beers out and hauling this up to Ohio!"
"Pours out to a very clear yellow-gold with peach accents, forming a poofy white head with flocculent clumps. Retention is OK, and lacing is delicate. Carbonation is mild to moderate. Aroma is interesting...like sweet cornbread, husky pale malts, and soggy grains. Taste is also intriguing, with an odd twang of semisweet malt husks, butter, raw crystal malt, freshly cut hay, and catnip. Mouthfeel is somewhat bubbly and sharp, with a light body and toasty, semi-astringent finish. Tettnager or Hallertauer are evident in the mildly perfumy, yet distinctly noble, floral finish. Finishing bitterness is moderate, and the husks take on a subtle vanilla character towards the end. Dunlap hop sacks are evident throughout. Despite it's interesting character, I couldn't see myself drinking more than three of this peculiar brew."
"Thanks to Msr. Kbub6f, I have in front of me my first Carolina beer. Even in my pre-BA days, Im not sure I ever had a Carolina beer. Is that a bad thing? This pale ale pours a textbook amber, with brilliant clarity and a really impressive, smooth, clingy, lacey head of less-than-white foam. A slight acetaldehyde-ish apple aroma under-rode a decidedly fresh malt aroma. A good dose of caramel maltiness (crystal I believe) instantly filled my mouth, followed by the same, slight appley flavor, then a long, bitter-but-not-very-hoppy finish. The fresh crystal malt flavor crept back into the tail, allowing the hopless bitterness to subside a bit. Passing half the bottle over my tongue eventually allowed some murky, non-descript hop flavor to edge along side the mild bitterness. While I liked the nutty, almost cracker-like maltiness, I didnt particularly care for the faint sour apple flavor and I was ambivalent about the bitterness sans hoppiness. The sourness was reminiscent of Bass and the bitterness harkened McNeils beers. The nutty crystal malt flavor conjured images of most American pale ales brewed in the English style. All told, this was a fine beer, but nothing exciting."
"Solid pale yellow in color with a thin white head that faded fast and leaves tiny strings of lace. Smell is of citrusy lightness, short, bright, crisp, fresh, and pretty soft. Taste is mildly crisp, light, with a crispy sharp sweet bitterness. Mellows out to a hollowness in the finish. Hops are a bit citrusy and lightly balanced in with the malts which lend to be a bit breadish and grainy. Feel is a lighter-medium body with a slight sharpness and lightly textures but smoothing. Not a bad brew, could use some added boldness and more flavor but still pretty enjoyable and drinkable."
"A quality American Lager and well above the mass produced swill. A great session beer for summer. One of Palmetto's better brews."
"Palmetto is one of those small local breweries whose beers I tend to enjoy. Had this at one of the many seafood restaurants that dot Charleston and thoroughly enjoyed it. It went very well with my dish although the waitress had recommended Palmetto Pale Ale. A good full-bodied brew with a nice sense of hops in both the smell and taste to balance the malts. Crisp. clean taste with a nearly dry finish."
"A very average beer, but good on a hot day, I am sure. Not much taste, either from the malt or the hops. Nothing poorly done or sloppy, just not much to be gained from this, either when it is first opened or as it warms. Still better than an American Macro, but just not as good as the better American Lagers, like a Stoudt's Gold or a Great Lakes Dortmunder."
