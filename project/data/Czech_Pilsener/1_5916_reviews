"Awesome beer"
"Overall- Not a very good beer.  Not a huge pilsner fan but I suspect this isn't a great one."

"Doesn't impress in any way, but has a certain balance that makes you want more. A maltier option to Pilsner Urquell from the same brewery."

"A decent Czech pilsener although certainly not the best the country has to offer. It was enjoyable without proving anything too special, coming through with a mellow and well-balanced taste that made it quite an easy beer to drink."

"By far not the worst beer I've had this past week, but not one I would ever choose if in Europe or North America."

"Brought a 330ml can home from recent trip to Europe. A big foamy head rose to the top of my class, the color was a clear copper. The smell was definate saaz hops. Clean, crisp taste. Slight sweetness gave way to a bitter after taste. Normal czech beer carbonation. As it tastes so natural you could drink a few of these. Nice czech pils, no suprises but thats not a bad thing."

"Overall: Would drink this if I didn't have any much choice. But not drinking it again for the sake of drinking it any time soon."
"O: I sure have widened my beer taste over the year, but a great Czech Pils is never wrong. This is still one of my favourites - it doesn't get much better for this kind of money. I'll drink this on its own, or with meats, sausages, or a sturdy sandwich."
"Half litre bottle. Poured into HB flute. Big foamy head from half the bottle but it went fast. Bronze, copper colour. Nutty smell, definate saaz hops in there as well. Clean, crisp taste. Some mushroom and parmesan cheese. Slight sweetness gave way to a bitter after taste. Normal czech beer carbonation. As it tastes so natural you could drink a few of these. Nice czech pils, no suprises but thats not a bad thing."
"Clear dark golden colour with thick foamy white head. Malty nose. Aroma is sweet soft malts with fruits. Flavor is soft malt and hops. Dry long-lasting hoppy finish. Medium carbonation. A typical easy to drink Czech Pilsener and a very good one at that, but a few notches below Pilsner Urquell."
"D - pretty drinkable, however, with its watery taste, not interested in this one.. moreover it is HGB"
"D- over all I like this beer and I feel that it is pretty drinkable, goes down nice and easy."
"D: The beer goes down rather smoothly and is quite sessionable. I could easily drink several of these in one sitting."
"A rather neutral and clean lager. Does not intrude the palate or food. Decent."
"D: Good beer with lower reputation than it deserves in Czech Republic. Definitely one of my favourites pilsners. Good for hot summer time."
"D: A Czech that you probably won't buy more than once - I will not buy it again. Nothing wrong with it, but there are so many others that are better."
"This is the best Czech beer that I have tried while in Czech Republic. There are actually several versions available in the stores such as Regular, Premium and Excellent. I am not sure what kind is typically on tap but it has the Czech Pilsner taste without the skunkyness like Pilner Urquell."
"I would obviously prefered to have stayed out, but at least I've reviewed a beer while in Prague, even if it is from notes made while in a hotel room listening to the wife snore and wheeeze."
"D= Very High. I like this beer a lot. Maybe because I'm czech by heritage but I actually really enjoyed the taste. Very nice."
"Drinkability: Pretty good. Nothing too special. Something I would try again but nothing I would go out of my way to find."
"I loved in Czech for 6 months and I would have to say this was one of my favorites. Great example of a fine Pilsner. It's mush lighter than the other Czech beers and Aerican seem to shose this over others. I can not find it anywhere in the US. I'm sure if it was here it would sell very well. Althogh I do like it, there are better czech selections there."
"Taste is malty with decoction caramel and Maillard products in the taste. The yeast adds a light fruity taste. Strangely enough I pick up hints of custard pudding. Bitterness is medium and drinkability is good."
"Ah the halcyon days of Gambrinus are long gone. Gone is the refreshingly crisp taste, gone is the buzz whenever passing a Gambrinus bar, gone is the soul of this once excellent beer. I have been living in the Czech Republic for nigh on ten years and once upon a time a Gambac would come with a great frothy head that clung to your nose, and further beers would be on the way before the first was finished. The last Gambrinus I had though was weak, watery and hardly worth the effort. Such are sad stories written."
"Review translated from french 4-15-2008."
"D- Did a taste test with this an Urquell in a Praha pub, and couldnt tell them apart. Just not a fan of any Bohemian lagers i have found, but the dark stuff is a different story."
"You can get it in 500 ml can, along with your hot dog for a happy meal."
"This beer goes down easy enough and full of taste for a long session."
"Anyway, this is a typical Czech brew. It's light in color, with a nice head (i had it on tap as well). A bit darker than Budweiser and Urquell. Taste was a bit less sweeter than those other two. Had some crispness to it. This was one of the better beers I had over there, and since I'm not a pilsner kind of guy, I drank this one a lot."
"Like others have commented, a popular beer in the Czech Republic due to good taste and ease of drinking. I'm sure that it helps that it's also significantly cheaper than Pilsner Urquell both in the bottle and on tap. Worth a try but not necessarily worth making a huge effort to seek out. If you come to the Czech Republic, you'll probably drink it."
"This is what you should hand a Bud drinker to show him there is a better way!!!"
"Poured with huge head, crystal clear body. Great lacing. Clean mouthfeel, epitamy of easy drinking. Not much at all in terms of arom, oh well. Some light hop bitterness and sterm malt profile stays unobtrusive to the smooth, gentle mouthfeel. Would be very interesting on cask. I, personally, would prefer to big brother Pilsner Urquell. A good true Czech pilsner, far above anything you'd find domestically here in Ontario."
"Enormous head,lighter yellow colour, bit of lace in glass. Agressive carbonation. Some bitterness but otherwise low in taste and in body. Malted away. Drying finish. Satisfying lawnmower beverage. Nothing off just bland, and not fresh from brewery. Passable aroma. Thanks to Jan Biegaman."
"D = Drinkable. But a little too malty for my liking."
"drank a ton of this in prague. had a blast. this beer is a lot more drinkable than budweiser (budvar). it is a really a great beer. you can drink twelve of these at a bar and not mind a bit. a must have. it is a simple pilsner, but with a few twists that make it what it is. not hoppy, no frills, just good beer. brought me back to pilsners."
"Drinkable, if there isn't anything else. But in this case, water is better."
"You have to be 18 (US citizen: 21) to visit Gambrinus' website. Couldn't find anything harmful there, though. I have a soft spot for thirst quenching Czechs which probably makes me overrate this beer a little. It pours with a finger of foam and has a nice, golden color. There is a strong bread aroma (which I also like), some hops and a little sourness. The taste is dry, malty and bready with some saltiness. In my opinion it's better than average but not in the premier league."
"The carbonation is very strong, it is almost sharp."
"It pours a rocky and foamy white beerhead, settling rather fast to a thin layer of medium bubbles... golden/light honeyish colour; medium-rich carbonation. The nose is very softly malty with light, lime-like fruity hops and soda-biscuit and dough's softly sour note. On the palate, again a lot of soft malts arrive in full force, with a light, delicate hop flavour at the back--no particular bitterness detected in the finish, while chewy, bready flavour is more noticeable towards the very end. It's basically a thin-bodied, mild-flavoured pilsner, with a bit of watery mouthfeel in the end. Straight-forward and much more boring than Pilsner Urquell, albeit very thirst quenching especially when served on tap."
"This is a very good, well-made Euro-Pils and is very refreshing. I was surprised by this one. I would gladly drink it again."
"Draft, St. Petersburg, Russia. A bit more substance after all the Russian lagers IÂ’ve been swilling. Good fluffy head that leaves a little lace. Golden pilsener color. A bit of extra sweetness, but the European hop profile makes a valiant effort to balance it.Still, a great pilsner beer smell I could pick up from two feet away made a good first impression on me."
"Pours a darkish clear gold under a firm two finger white head that fades fairly quickly to thick patchy film and leaves some spots of lace. Sweet grainy malt nose with a twinge of metal-fruit hops. Very highly carbonated and fairly light in the mouth. Open features a good strong malt backbone, slightly sweet and a bit bready. On top of this superstructure the crisp hoppiness quickly establishes itself, building in intensity until the smooth bitter finish. The bite lingers well into the aftertaste. Yup, it's good."
"Decent with a meal, But I wouldn't drink it if I had other beers around."
"Its yellow and fizzy just like miller lite and offers no real flavor. Like the reviewers before me said 'its just empty'. Flavor is grainy and nothing like other Bohemian pilsners I had. Mouthfeel is watery and seems overcarbonated."
"More complexity would add to it, but its drinkability and smooth bite let it be an excellent accompaniment to bread-based meals. Slightly above average, but unfortunately touted as spectacular."
"I'm drinking this brew all the time in Prague, this major brew I prefer immensely to Pilsner Urquell. Came in a soccer ball themed can. Pours with good head, but dissolves quickly over time. Beer itself is a quite spectacular golden. Taste is a typical pilsner - smooth, but not much flavor except for slight hoppyness with the carbonation, and very little aftertaste. A good standard pilsner."
"I spent a good deal of time searching for this one when I came back to the states and was extremely disappointed to discover that I couldn't get it here. I'd love to drink another one of these, I'd even choose it over a better beer just to sample it again. Guess I'll have to go back to Prague."
"Good beer. Tried this when i was in Prague. I'm not VERY enthusiastic with this beer and the reason perhaps is that i compare it with Pilsner Urquell and the U Fleku beer i had when i was in Prague. Definitely not the best Czech Republic has to offer"
