"Pours a hazy, straw color.  1/3 inch head of a white color.  Great retention and great lacing.  Smells of strong pale malt, slight sweet malt, hint of hop, and a hint of yeast.  Fits the style of a Czech Pilsner.  Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level.  Tastes of strong pale malt, sweet malt, hops, and slight yeast.  Overall, good appearance, simple but good aroma, good feel and body as well."

"Final score: 3.74"

"Sweetness came through right away, some grassiness as well. Slightly sour note in the back of the mouth, but that didn't hang around. clean, crisp, not harse at all. Seems to hold up very well."
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a bright yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is grassy, malts, grains. Taste is smooth, malty, grains, grassy hops at the finish providing a mild bitterness. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a refreshing and highly sessionable beer."
"Pours a crystal clear pale golden with a medium white head. Aroma and taste is sweet fruity notes, yeast, grains, some malt. Palate is a light to medium body, crisp clean refreshing mouth feel. The finish is sweet malt, fruity mild citrus, yeast and bread with a mild hops on the end for balance. This is good refreshing mild brew for a hot summer day."

"O: Overall pretty enjoyable. Clean, crisp, refreshing and enjoyable.  Not the greatest pils in the world, but pretty darn good."

" The taste is pretty decent with spiciness of the Czech hops with light herbal taste and gentle malt backing up the hops with slight toastiness - the yeast is the core of the taste with european influence which is heavy on the mineral with a bit of musty and dry flavor and light grassy herbal hops surround the malt with bitter flavor yet more spicy almost peppery in taste indicating saaz to me which fits the style. Not as mellow as a German pils, but in general a nice interpretation of the style and a very drinkable hoppy lager"

"I can't account for other reviews that are not stellar; other than to think that those reviewers do not like pilsners.   After almost 50 years of beer drinking, I think I can say that the current trend of overly hopped ales will pass, and good pilsners (which is harder to make- you can't cover things up with more hops) will  become more appreciated."

"Overall: I didn't emphasize on this beer too much because its not too interesting, but for a pilsner it's solid. Its bittersweet and crisp. I feel like they do lagers much better, but this is not at all bad. I think I've enjoyed just about every beer by Great Lakes. Cheers!"

"This pours out a very light straw-gold color with an initial half-inch head. Nice flowery hop aroma, quite big. Definitely on the hoppy end of the style, the taste greets you with a high bitterness, and lots of noble hop flavor. Really, this feels more like a German than Czech pils. Malt is light, as is the body, with a very dry finish. This is a good quaffing pils. Very nice."
""
"Overall: I was expecting more from this one. Happy to get my hands on it either way (although I had to go across the border to DC)."
""
""
"O: Pleasantly surprised as this is my first Great Lakes product. I would definitely return to this at the price of $16/12."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A truly outstanding czech pils from an American brewery. The hops really shine here but a creamy malt profile and crisp yeast notes are so well done. This is a great pils that is a no brainer as a summer seasonal."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Golden yellow in color with perfect clarity. Poured with a short, dense, white foam that quickly reduced to a wispy cap. Sweet bready malt and floral hop aromas with earthy grass, lemon zest and toasted malt notes. Medium bodied with assertive, tangy, crisp carbonation and a clean semi-dry finish. Bready, biscuity malt flavors up front followed by tangy, herbal hops through the middle. Hop bitterness gradually intensifies from the middle to the end as this finished semi-dry with lingering hop bitterness and biscuity notes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- simple but well crafted, showcases the noble hops"
""
""
""
"While I like the body of this beer, the traditional lightness serves the style well. This is a little more robust, though it has the crispness and it is clean."

"Poured a clear gold with a short-lived fizzy white head. A little hangs on, though, and leaves behind some lacing. The aroma is a light, but pleasant, offering some floral hops and a light biscuit note. The taste is good, but seems stuck deciding between going with a more noble-hop forward approach or a more bready malty path. It doesn't taste bad, but it's missing some of the depth either one of those aspects offers. It has a nice thinner weight to the body and a pleasant dry finish. It is a very good pilsner."

" Mouthfeel gets a high performance 4.25 . Dry, yes; entirely literal, no. I mean, this would make my worries melt away on a humid- as-all- fuck 85+ degree day in the Ohio summers. This brew makes me all the more proud of my ancestral heritage. You bet your bottom dollar I will buy this brew again."

"Overall/Comments: Another really solid brew by GLBC that was well done and well put together. I really enjoyed this beer and how refreshing and sessionable it was. June Seasonal Release. Classified as a Czech Pilsner @ 5.3%. Consumed 6/30/2013."
""
""
""
""
"This is a well-made, true-to-style Czech-style pils! Very drinkable!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Crisp, complex malt combined with spicy Saaz hops. Bitterness level is perfect. .Perhaps a slight increase to malt used to provide a little more balanced finish."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes of corn mostly, crisp enough to enjoy, finishes with mild hops and fizzy bubbles. Taste isn't entirely too complex, in fact, it kind of reminds me of a light macrobrew. Frankly, it is a rather simple beer."

""

""
""
""
""
"D - Easy drink; could have quite a few of these during the summer; fantastic pilsener taste"
""
"For as average as this set up it finished strongly and may be my new session beer."
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, it's not a bad pilsener. Good crisp taste, just not outstanding. There are many better pilseners, but I say this beer is worth a try, although I probably won't buy it again."
""
"Poured a light gold color and had a small white head with little messy lacing. Aroma has strong malts, earthy tones, and light hop notes. Flavor is mostly caramel and amber malts. Very crisp and clean with a light and bubbly mouthfeel. Pretty good overall."
""
""
"My aggro pour netted me two big foamy fingers of fluffy, bone-white head with good retention. Color was a sunshine-yellow with NE-quality clarity. SRM = 3 to 4. Nose was redolent with fresh mown grass and fresh cut hay. it must be towards the end of summer! Mouthfeel was not just soft, but also viscous and it sat on my tongue like a dollop of Saaz hops pudding. More please, Mom-Za! It tasted like somebody just emptied the lawnmower bag into the kettle and walked away. I am a huge fan of Czech-style pilsners, especially in comparison to their German-style counterparts and this was one of the best yet. Finish was dry and refreshing, perfect on a hot, humid late-August day."
""
""
""
"Nice carbonation, light bodied, easy to drink, very drying in the finish. Overall, I must say I'm never let down when I buy a GL product, this one is no different. I got this at the great price of 9.99 a sixer. A really good session beer especially when the temps are rising."
""
"A fine example of a style not so easy to find well done in the US."
""
""
"Another example of how Great Lakes built their outstanding reputation: a terrific interpretation of a classic style."
""
""
""
"O: This is going to be my new fridge staple during this time of year."
""
""
""
"The smell I know. The taste I don't. The smell is enjoyable in its familiarity, and the taste is really a lighter version of it. It is quite dry. I probably wouldn't get it again."
""
""
"Overall – A rather nice crisp and easy drinking yet nicely hopped pilsner."
""
""
"Overall: exactly what I have come to expect from a majority of the Great Lakes beers. Nice and well done. A go to in the style"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Here's a good example of a pilsener that can easily be enjoyed in the summer. It is rather bitter with a nice balance of malt and hops with grain and floral flavors with a very faint citrus element. It goes down very easy without being thin. The smell and taste are fresh and refreshing. Moderate carbonation with dryness on the finish. This is one of the best pilseners I've had."
"Overall this is an above average Pilsener, very refreshing to enjoy on a nice summer eve."
""
"Slightly big feel for a lager. Kinda' uninspiring."
""

"Clear golden color head of white foam. Pils nose. Standard beer scent. Clean crisp taste. Rock solid all around. Smooth with lemon close. Full body and flavor. Great beer. Really liked this pils. 4 350 425 425 4"

"O- crisp and pure pils done right tasty and hits the spot"
""
"Great Lakes The Wright Pils ---3.5/5"
"O-The main knock is that it should be consumed cold. But one of the better pils out there."
"O: 4 a refreshing beer with plenty of flavor. Excellent beer for a hot day."

"Great Pilsner. The taste is full of hops and settles nicely. 5.3% ABV and 159 calories are a nice combination. Got to support Cleveland for introducing this nice blend. Full hops with a dry present finish. This is a great combination in relation to cost, calories, and taste."

"12oz bottle: pours a clear pale golden with a stringy-lacing white head. Has a lightly sweet and slightly grainy malty nose with some spicy noble hops. Starts with a mild pale malty sweetness with assertive earthy and peppery noble hop flavor and bitter balance before a drier clean finish. True to style and very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a satisfying and robust pilsner that's also gentle and abundant. It's expansive and the aftertaste lingers almost dry with the cracker and sweetness left on the tongue as the bitter echos at the back of the throat. It's practically weightless and crisp. Great Lakes has done it again with a robust pilsener that you can easily drink all day."
""
""
""
""
"My overall thoughts of this beer are that it's an ""Okay"" offering from Great Lakes. It seems to be an attempt to get some business from people that usually buy AB or Coors. The thing about it is that if that was their idea behind this beer, it's a pretty big failure. The taste is radically different from a Bud. This would be too bitter for a person that drinks BMC all the time."
""
""
""
""
"Overall it is a very nice refreshing summertime drink. It's not the best Great Lakes has to offer but it is a very nice drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall Drinkability: Pretty eh for Great Lakes."
"Overall a good summer beer that would be hard to dislike for anyone who likes beer. Wont be anyones favorite but hey, it's a pils!"

"Glad I picked up this czech pilsner when I was in Ohio last summer. It seems to have weathered the past several months in storage and the trip back to New Mexico quite well as this is one of the better pilsners I've had. Although a little lacking in appearance, this beer pairs reasonably complex flavors with with a high level of drinkability. Although a bit steeply priced at $8.50 a six in Ohio, I could see myself getting this again."

"Overall: I really like this beer. Has a great all round offering."

"Poured from the bottle into a pilsner glass, the beer was urine sample yellow. Normally, colors this bright are reserved for kids' drinks. A generous white head was a sign of powerful carbonation, which was definitely evident in the mouthfeel. A grassy aroma was present, as expected for a pilsner. In the initial taste, one gets grass, sour hay, and a mildly tart grain taste. The mild sourness continues into the aftertaste, which moves in quickly because of the carbonation. I normally skip pilsners, and now I remember why. This is a pilsner, so it is Great Lakes' attempt at a beer for non-craft drinkers. For craft beer drinkers, it tastes a little more like a high end macro-brew."
""
""
"A decent take. Crisp and clean. Wouldn't be hard to knock back a few of these on a casual hangout. Worth drinking, but not the best out there."
""
"On tap at the Great Lakes location in the Cleveland airport. Pours a clear straw color. Crisp and clean but without quite enough hop bite. Dry and drinkable."
""
"Overall - definitely not my favorite lager, but I would say its in my upper half."
"Real strong grassy nose in this. Earthy and mildly inky flavor on this, but overall fairly smooth, even though there is a noticeable bitter tone. Fairly easy to drink. If it were up to me, I'd probably tone it down and smooth it out a bit. Still a nice beer though."
"Overall, a refreshing beer, more citrus character than anticipated, and less cracker flavor. More bitter than most."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a very easy to drink beer and a good representation of the style - enjoyable flavors but a little too strong to be a session beer."
""
"O- Good but not great. I won't actively seek this one in the future, but Great Lakes yet again put out a solid brew."
""
""
""
"Great Lakes clearly knows how to brew a lager - this being another excellent rendition of its style...very clean and refreshing beer with no lack of flavor."
""
""
"O-No surprise here....another top notch lager from GL...not as hop forward as Prima Pils or Noble Pils but a nice drinker and a rock solid Pils"
""
""
"Overall: It should be no surprise that Great Lakes makes a tasty and refreshing pils like the Wright Pils. Enjoy."
"Anyone else feel this beer is just an addict's rallying cry? (""Bring me the right pills!"") Anyway, this stuff pours a clear straw topped by a finger of soapy white foam. The nose comprises funky wheat, flowers, sharp grass, and minerals. The taste takes out the funk and drives home the flowery/grassy nature of the hops, providing a nicely bitter wash without overdoing it. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a crisp finish. Overall, a very nice pils, one of the better American examples I've had in recent memory."
"Good pilsner, not my favorite, but I could definitely go for another sometime."
""
"Good smooth taste; basic beer flavor with little aftertaste. A little bitter and watery as compared to a Belgium beer (Stella Artois). I enjoy a more creamy consistency with a smoother flavor and a more flowery aftertaste. Most people would enjoy this beer; however, it doesn't have much memorable qualities."
""
"A really nice light pilsener. I'd get this in the summertime to share with friends."
""
""
""
"Pours straw colored, almost light gold with nice fluffy white head. Great carbonation. Smells bready like white bread. Crisp with light floral hop notes. Very clean & crisp tasting with nice even bitterness to balance out the light pilsner malt sweetness. Light and very drinkable. Overall, a very nice beer. Another excellent offering from Great Lakes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied with a crisp, spicy hop bite that lingers over the sweeter notes and pale malts into a slightly dry finish. The hop character is really nice with the perfect amount of dry bitterness that doesn't overpower the other notes. Earthy and slightly funky with a sticky, grassy feel giving off subtle pine and straw flavor. This is countered by sweet light fruit notes, especially apple and pear as well as some bread, biscuit and pilsner malt. Well balanced, refreshing and easy to drink. Doesn't look or smell all that great but it's a pretty nice beer."
""
""
"Poured into my pils glass a light yellow with fluffy white head and lots of bubbles floating upward. Smells a bit earth like with grass and grain aromas. Taste is crisp, slightly thin at first then has a bit of a dry finish with some grassy hop flavors. Overall I find this pils to be super drinkable and a solid example of the style."
"Beer is medium to medium-light in body, with mid-level carbonation that foams the beer slightly across the palate. Closes dryly, with long-lingering noble hop bitterness."
"12oz bottle, pours a pale golden color with a tall foamy, white head. Good head retention with a little lacing. Aromas are grassy, floral noble hop, pilsner malt. Tastes are appropriately sharp and crisp, grassy, biscuity, finishes clean and dry. Body is thin with moderate to high carbonation. Overall, good example of the style, but I probably wouldn't get it again."
""
"Overall another great beer from Great Lakes. Stands up to a few of the well known pilseners out there. I need to try this fresher. Very true to the style, an easy drinker anyone can enjoy."
"A good beer but really a little boring. There's nothing to grab you and reel you in."
"O: pretty good take on a Czech pilsner. Perfect on a hot day or for sessioning with friends. A nicely balanced beer that you could use to introduce novice beer drinkers to."
"a better than average pils. pours crystal clear blond color with a rising white head that has okay retention. smells more hoppy than most of these, with some citrus hops notes on top of the stamdard pilsener malts. flavor is very crisp and dry, very summery. the hops are there for sure, which makes this one more appealing to me. mouthfeel is nice, more medium than light on the body, with fine carbonation. the finish is a little bitter, but its very quick. easy drinking and refreshing. nice brew."
"Pours a clean deep yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, somewhat malty and a small hop presence. In the taste, a small hop, but again malty for a pils. A small hop bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry saaz hop in the aftertaste. Fresh and malty, nice presence of hops, enjoyable."
"Overall: A very solid American take on a Pilsner. Nice grassy hop presence to balance the sweetness. Nice to have this more widely available as a seasonal."
"O-light, crisp, and clean. Great representation of the style"
"O: This beer is very easy to drink and is a good representation of the style."
"Poured into a pilsner a light golden with a thinner frothy white head that sticks well,quite sprtitzy in its looks.Aromas have a bit of leafy hops but more toasty malt,a tinge of iron comes into play as well.Flavors of what a pilsner should be,toasty with a shot of leafy/spicy hops in the finish,I like the toast most of all.A great pilsner with real flavor,it's toasted with a shot of noble hops."
"A pretty average pilsner. Nothing too distinct about it. Enjoyed my pour."
""
"The Wright Pilsner glides into the glass with a yellowish golden look in color and nothing in terms of bubbles. I poured this hard and only managed some bubbles around the side of the glass that die off, no lace. Smell is pretty bright with fresh German style hops, Noble I presume. Some perfume and some pale malt, standard pilsner scents, but bold and pungent. Taste is off the charts with bold pilsner vibes, noble hops, some grass, slight florals and some pale malt in the end keeping things in check. Very crisp on the mouth, while the look suggests no carbonation, the feel is far from dead. Light bodied refreshing and goes down easy. I knew this would be a hit, Great Lakes always does German beer wright."
"Pours a clear yellow gold with a thin white head. Just a bit of retention, and some nice lace. Aroma is of grainy malts, with a hint of floral,grassy hops. Body is light with some carbonation. Taste is malty up front with a refreshing finish. Nice version of this style."
"HIGHLY recommended!!!"
""
"Overall – A good beer, but I was expecting more of a noble hop presence. Still very drinkable and worth trying, just a little boring."
""
"The taste isn't overpowering but is clear and strong. Bread and earthy notes color the malt but the hops assert themselves nicely as well. The crispness of the texture hits the style to a tee. Finish is crisp and clean with a full, hoppy, aftertaste. One of the best Czech pilsners I've ever had."
"This is an expertly brewed pils, and I would highly recommend you try it. Right up there with Avery, Victory, and Lagunitas as my favorite pils. I'd much rather drink these ultra-fresh pils from these brewers than skunky Urquell or hop extract Bitburger."
"O - Good all around pilsner that by know means will blow your mind, but will give you an enjoyable brew to drink on a warm sunny day. Great Lakes BC do a lot of great brews, but it's not all about the ales with them as they pay tribute and respect to old fashioned lagers and they do it in a high quality manner. This isn't quite as good as a few of their other lagers, but it's still a damn fine choice and offers a quality pilsner. I guarantee it's better than any other pilsner you'll find on the shelf around the same time of year. It's a brew to try for certain."
""
""
""
"12 ounce bottle, poured in a pilsener glass, the beer pours a clear gold color with a half inch white head. Head retention is good, and there's a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is grainy malt, along with some grassy and spicy hops. Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's also some slight floral hops noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's crisp and refreshing and very easy to drink. I'd certainly buy this again."
""
""
"Overall: I hate to give such a ""low"" score to one of my favorite breweries, but that aftertaste messes up what should be a nice, refreshing beer. Also, I see very little reason to have this when GLBC offers up the much better Dortmunder Gold year round."
"Solid all around. Hops profile seemed more German-influenced than Czech, but, when it comes to lagers in this part of the spectrum, I can't claim to have the greatest ability for discernment. Clean start, with lively carbonation. A touch of grain toward the middle, with a restrained slightly herbal hoppyness to the finish."
"Not bad, malt character lacks a little, even for a bo pils."
""
"brewers who do it right."
"Overall this is pretty well balanced pils. The various flavors can all be tasted seperately and do not run together. Good for a session on a hot summer day."
"Appearance is pale gold with white head that retains nicely and leaves a thick layer of lacing. Nose is full of fresh Czech hops which provide a grassy green aroma. This is paired with sturdy cereal grains, stone wheat, and a slight hint of caramel. Taste is rather bitter with bready grain all over. The finish is dry and bitter earthy flavors. Mouthfeel is crisp, light, and well carbonated. Overall, this is another well crafted lager from Great Lakes with a firm hop presence."
""
"I love this brewery and just how they make simple good honest beer. This beer is wonderful."
"O - The Wright Pils is a damn fine beer over all, but when it comes to a Czech pilsner, this one is flying a different pattern. It's got the nose of a classic Czech, but it just doesn't follow through with moderately bold noble hops and the soft floral, spice, and bitterness they impart. Quite refreshing and drinkable regardless."
""
""
"This is pretty straight forward. Nothing flashy, but very well executed. Traditional. Pilsener fans should enjoy. Quaffable stuff here."
""
""
""
""
"This beer pours a golden straw yellow with a little white head that stays all the way down. Not much on the nose, some grainyness and lager yeast. The taste is very grainy, crisp, some wheat and hay. There is also a slight fruitiness from whatever hop they used. This beer has a nice feel to it and goes down clean, smooth and easy. A beer for any beer drinker. A solid Pilsner, and much like everything else great lakes does, it wont disappoint."
"This is a disappointing offering from a solid brewery. It's grainy and warm which is something I would expect from an adjunct offering. There are many better selections for this style."
"O- For me this has become my go to beer this summer. Hard to put down and hard to only have one. Nice job!"

"12 ounce bottle into pilsener glass, best by 8/29/2012. Pours a fairly crystal clear golden straw color with a nice 1-2 finger dense white head with very good retention; that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some good spotty lacing clings to the glass, with a good amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of lemon, apple, herbal, grass, bread, floral, and light pepper. Very nice and pleasant aromas with good balance. Taste of lemon, biscuit, pear, floral, pepper, bready grain, and herbal spiciness. Light spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, pear, bread, floral, pepper, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a bit. Very nice balance of flavors with a good amount of flavor as well. Medium carbonation and body; with a very nice crisp and clean mouthfeel.. Alcohol is well hidden with almost no warming noticed at all. Overall this is an excellent pilsner. Good flavor robustness and balance; and extremely easy to drink. Highly enjoyable and spot on to style."
"The draft had a little bit hoppier feel to it, the bottled a little darker somehow, but very similar. Overall, this is what I would call robundant - especially for the style - it feels full bodied and more authentic than the real thing."
"Real good pils, nice flavor balance, easy going, refreshing. One of the better pils I've ever had."
"Overall: 4.5/5"
""
"D: i could drink a lot of this stuff. a pretty tasty czech style pils. clean and well lagered."
""
""
"O: A fine representation of a Czech pils, but not my favorite beer."
"Overall This is a very good pilz. Perhaps a bit on the maltier side compared to its German counterparts. I like the freshness dates Great Lakes is using so you know you are getting something thats not ancient. Unlike some overseas pilz that come in green bottles with no freshness dates at all."
""
""
""
"In nearly any other style, the combinations of corn sulfur and butter would be an immediate detractor regarless of how slight the tastes are. But the union in this beer gives added fullness both in flavor and texture. Perhaps this doesn't work for every pilsner, unless it's The Wright Pils ;-)"
"The beer pours an outstandingly vibrant looking straw yellow. There is no haze or sediment. A half inch a pure white head crowns the beer and loosely laces down the sides while drinking. There is ample, visible carbonation as well. The nose is slightly bitter and grainy. There are no distinguishable fruit/pine notes to the beer's hops, relatively nondistinct. With a vigorous swirl there is a slight cheesy butteriness and tomato that competes with the malt's sweetness. The taste is all pilsner with a crisp, light hoppiness followed by a semi-dry, lingering sweetness. Flavorful and drinkable summer beer, but the mouthfeel is a little off. A little more citrus/lemon in the back end would really make this beer something special for me. Overall this is a great bar beer... something you could drink a few of."
"Bottle from the Village Beer Merchant. A not true Czech pils. Consistent with many I have had in that realm, it has a bit of cheesy aroma. Slightly cloudy body. Middling mouthfeel. So-so drinkability, with some bitterness and lemony. Suitable carbonation. Dry finish."
""
"Pours a clear straw golden color with a retentive fluffy white pillowy head and ample clumps of lace. Miley sweet aroma of bread malt, noble hops, grass and lemon. Grainy and biscuit flavor gives way to a light lemon and earth dryness and a mild floral hop bitterness in the finish. Light diacetyl mid palate adds a pleasant smoothness to the well carbonated, soft medium body. Nothing too bold but no complaints, another lovely lager from GLBC."

"MOREY’S BOTTOM LINE: Honestly, I was expecting more hops. This is a good pilsner for sure, but Great Lakes usually isn’t shy when it comes to bitterness and flavor. A nice and refreshing beer for summer drinking though. I’m partial to hoppy pilsners myself, but if you’re not quite ready for Prima Pils, then this would be a good first step up from Macro Beers."
"Overall if I am in the market for a Pils I will buy this again. Great summer beer."

"o - I don't have much experience with czech pilseners, but this seems to represent the style well. goes down easy and enjoyable, though not a beer i would buy often."
"I always enjoy a fresh pilsner on a hot summer day, and this one is no exception. There were ""off"" flavors that kept this one from the very top of list."
"The mouthfeel is light with carbonation being about average for the style. Overall it was a pretty solid version of the style. It's light, refreshing, easy drinking and well balanced. Nice beer for a hot day."
"Clean and refreshing upfront with a bitter hop punch in the back heightened by good carbonation. Chewy malt bread qualities come out towards the end along with an herb bitterness that all but hides the subtle sweet caramel notes. Finishes dry."

"12 ounce bottle, surprisingly there wasn't a best by date printed on the label of any of the bottles in the 6 pack I just bought. But since this just came out in bottles recently, I can't imagine it's very old at all. Served in a pilsener glass, the beer pours a clear gold color with a half inch white head. Head retention is good, and there's a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is grainy malt, along with some grassy and spicy hops. Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's also some slight floral hops noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's crisp and refreshing and very easy to drink. I think this is a good overall brew, at just $8.99 a 6 pack I'd certainly buy this again."

"Overall, while this beer is far from being groundbreaking, it is an excellent example of the style. A wonderful thirst quencher and a great summertime brew that I wish more breweries would make. Another great beer from Great Lakes."
"Overall - I found this to be an outstanding pilsner brew. Great Lakes shows again their ability to brew an incredibly diverse portfolio. Superb."
"M- Light bodied, decent carbonation."
"O. One of the best pilsners available, what a great choice to make this a new seasonal and available outside of the brewery. Those preferring hoppier pils may not be as impressed with this one, as the hops add a nice sweetness and spiciness but do not take center stage. This beer is all about balance and lightness, and it has these in spades. Great Lakes truly is a champion at lagering, and the Wright Pils stands proudly with Eliot Ness and Dortmunder as a great lager."
"Pours a clear pale gold topped by a big frothy white head. The nose is remarkably fragrant, very floral and doughy with a touch of cooked corn and citrus zest. The yeast profile is decidedly Czech, being more buttery and creamy than sulfuric. Palate is very nice, with floral and grassy hop flavors up front, followed by doughy, creamy, soft pils malt flavors. DMS and diacetyl are present at a low level, signature of Czech pilsner, giving the beer a softer character than the German counterpart. Finishes mildly bittersweet. This beer is hard to put down - Great Lakes continues to impress me with their lagers."
""
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability - Light on the palate and easily sessionable. Freshness really matters for this brew. In the end, it is nothing particularly special from GLBC, or to to style in general."
"Overall - Excellent pils for sure. Sweet, flavorful, easy to drink and low alcohol make this a summertime winner. Very glad this is now avaible outside the cleveland area. A welcomed addition to the strong lineup. One of the better pils out there."
"Overall I thought that this was a good beer and a little above average example of a Czech Pilsener, the aroma was a little odd, but after that the clean and crisp flavors that I expected shined through. This beer had really good drinkability, it was very smooth and clean, I could drink a few of these on a nice summer day while grilling outside. What I liked most about this beer was the mouthfeel and the crisp and clean flavors, this beer also looked pretty good. What I liked least about this beer was the lack of hops, I was expecting a little more hop flavors and I think the finish should have an assertive bitterness. I would buy this beer again when looking for a clean and easy drinking Pilsener, but It's not my favorite in style, I do recommend giving this beer a try, especially if you don't want a lot of bitterness. I thought this was a solid beer from a solid brewing company, GLBC hardly disappoints, keep up the good work guys."
""
"Overall: Very good summer beer I hope to be able to try this one on tap. I think Harris Grill is serving it tomorrow night I am going to try and be there."
"Taste-Biscuit, cracker,subtle floral hop note comes and hangs around to the finish. Very easy-drinking and refreshing. A fine summer offering."
"Overall / Drinkability: For what it lacks in aroma, it makes up for in taste and drinkability. I could easily have another of these and it went quite well with a meal (fish + potato cakes) as well. A good Czech pilsner."
""
"O: A very good beer. When compared to Great Lakes reigning lager king, their Dortmunder Gold, it falters a bit. But on it's own, this is top notch American brewed, Czech-style Pilsner. Yet again, Great Lakes flexes their lagering muscles. One I had at the brewery in January and loved - I'm stoked to finally have plenty of this chilling in my fridge. Big thumbs up."
"Pours a sparkling straw gold color under a pure-white, frothy head. Drippy sheets of lace, but no head towards the end of the glass. Clean aromas of spicy, grassy hops, hay, and cracker-like grain. Softly sweet cereal malt flavor with a bitter grassy/herbal hop finish. Crisp and snappy in the mouth...light bodied and refreshing. I think the malt could be a bit richer to counteract the hops, but a nice take on the style that I'll revisit this summer I'm sure."
"Pours a crystal clear and clean straw golden yellow, with a 1 finger white fluffy head that forms a thin lace. Smells of sweet grain, a tinge of floral hop like character coming through on the end, nothing exciting. Boiled grains and sweet sugary lemons on the tongue. A sweet bready malt base leaves a tad tart with a slightly bitter and dry finish. Light bodied moderate carbonation, sweet dry and a bitter finish. Overall; this beer is far from exciting (not unlike all pilsners), just a pretty standard pils."
""
""
"Easy to drink with a good amount of carbonation and background bitterness. Dry finish with just a touch of grape character left on the tongue."
"**Edit** Two months later, there isn't any sulfur, and there is a low level of diacetyl that lends a mild fruitiness. This beer is better, upping my overall score to 4.0"
"Overall: As a fan of Great Lakes, I'll say that this isn't their best, but it certainly has a lot to offer die-hard Great Lakes drinkers."
"I'm not much of a fan of pilsners, but this beer could make me one. It is very drinkable and refreshing and extremely well-balanced. I think all it really needs are a few more bubbles. I bought a single of this and I think I'll go back to the bottle shop for a six-pack. Heck, I might even drink one out of a pilsner. Cheers!"
"Looking at the grain bill from GL and I'm pretty surprised to see that there is no Pils malt listed at all. A little odd for a style originating from the malt itself."

"Mineral water bitterness up front, along with some grainy flavors. Herbal hops blend with peppery and lemony notes. Lightly toasted bready malt, with a hint of nuttiness. Slight honey note as well. Sea air noble hop wallop as the finish nears. Dry, crisp and refreshing, with latent lemon pepper hop bitterness. Moderate body with a crisp, lively feel. A delicious and very quaffable summer seasonal that I would drink year-round if it was available!"
""
""
"O- Overall I was not impressed and I was truly excited to try this one too. There is a graininess to all the GL lagers that is odd to me. I'll stick to Victory for my lagers or the Germans. Sad because I love Great Lakes for most other things."
""
""
"O: This is a great pilsener. In my opinion, it ranks up there with Sunshine Pils and Prima Pils. Nice work by Great Lakes. I'd grab a case of this every summer if they start to make it more regularly."
""
"Great Lakes spin on a Czech Pils. Light in color and flavor. Smell is a bit light, but the floral hops do come out a bit. The taste has hints of Great Lakes malt backbone, but not that much. Honestly, its just very light in every way. Flashes of floral hops do show up in the taste, but its nothing all that fancy. Not my favorite GL seasonal."
"O- A confusing beer. The aroma is way off, the taste is pretty good. I'll enjoy this beer, but not sure I would buy more. I was expecting more from GL, who makes an excellent everything... almost."
""
"I poured this beer into a pint glass, it has a nice golden color body with a small fizzy head. The smell is earthy and lemon to it. The taste has a nice balance of the biscuity malts and the hops. The mouth feel is really good and easy to drink. Overall this is a great beer from a great brewery."

"Long time anticipating a bottle of this stuff. Thanks to my cousin Joe, I landed 3 bottles in my dedicated beer fridge. Pours a beautiful pale golden slightly hazed color with a bright white head forming thick, leaves behind even layered speckled lacing. Perfect grassy pils in every way aromatics end up with a hint of lemon citrus notes and herbal earthy noble hops kicking. Flavor is light biscuit pale malt bready complex for how light and drinkable this beer is. More nice hop interplay with the malts bringing out a dry finish in each sip, nice perfect crisp Czech style pils. I can't wait til this is distributed as the summer seasonal this year it will simply be my staple this summer, lawnmower beer good drinkable and super refreshing. Mine is served a bit cold but it's perfect refreshing pilsener that I'm ready to get more of. This was on tap at the brewpub and sold to go from the gift shop."

"Overall....great beer. Too bad it's only in the Gift shop and at the pub!"
"Poured out bright yellow and crystal clear. A lot of carbonation leaving a big two finger head that drops down to a thin layer. Nose is sweet pilsner malt and earthy, herbal hops. The flavor pops out better than the nose. Big, light and malty, tangy sweetness upfront but then a big biscuit flavor builds from the middle getting stronger at the finish. The end also brings out a touch of herbal hops that stands out against the malt but isn't overwhelming. Light body that is crisp and clean the whole way through. If I had better access to this beer I could see myself drinking a lot of it."
"Pours a light hazy straw color with a thin head which gives way to some lace. The aroma is of grass and straw with hints of bread. The aroma is inviting. The taste follows suit with a bready backbone followed by a grassy and earthy slight hop bite and a hint of spiciness. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated and easy to drink. Overall it is a solid pilsner. There is a nice mild overall flavor with a nice aroma."
"Overall: a standard Czech Pils, very drinkable and fit for this August day. Would prefer a bit more hop flavor but still very tasty."
"Great Lakes Brewing should do everyone a favor and makes this available during the spring and summer on a widespread basis. Limiting sales to the gift shop is a mistake. The Wright Pils is nothing short of a fantastic representation a Czech Pilsener, and it should be much more available. I’m blown away. I was not expecting this. If you live outside the Cleveland area, do yourself a favor and trade for it."
"I'm glad to have picked this up. I find good pilsners generally to be too similar to one another, and this one, frankly, is no exception. They are good, you enjoy them, but at the end of the day, it is difficult to distinguish one good pilsner from another. Perhaps this one's claim to fame is a slightly more hop-bitter finish than your typical pilsner. I bet this, like the Holy Moses, would be better on tap."
"O- This is a great rep of the style. The style while not my favorite showcases this as a nice summer drinker. While not my first choice in beers this is light, crisp, and refreshing."
"The only thing I don't understand is why this beer is bottled but not distributed."
"Overall: Refreshing and flavorful and though the sweetness is a surprise it is a nice complement to the profile"
"D= A fantastically session-able beer that tastes good enough to want to... One of the better Czech pilsners I have had from the U.S."
"D- This stuff goes down easier than water, and it feels so light on the palette--not because of a lack of flavor, but because the finish is done so well. Really could drink a 6-pack without trying. A high-quality pilsner."
"M-very light and crisp."
"D - I preferred this on tap, as I do most beers. But it is still the most enjoyable beer that I have had in this style. Very refreshing."
"A pils that's defined by it's best characteristic - one could drink these by the six-pack without complaint. Good, solid beer."
"There's enough funny stuff about the finish of this beer to make me happy to be done after one. But it's perfectly drinkable."
"Smooth, a touch sweet, floral, and a tiny bitter bite on the finish. This offering needs to find wider distribution. I live in a market that gets all of the GL bottled offerings but haven't seen this one before. I'd low to be able to get this in bottles. It would be the perfect gateway baby step for a BMC drinker looking to get into craft whole providing enough interest to appeal to a seasoned beer geek."
"The beer pours a clear yellow color with a white head. The aroma is pilsener malt with a lot of grassy hops. The flavor is grassy hops and lighter malts with some low bitterness. The beer is very drinkable. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice American-made pilsener."
"Taste was ok. Not much flavor to it. Easy to drink. Nothing seemed special about this one. It disappointed me because I usually look forward to a GL."
"D - eh. veggies and corn is strong here, also a bit sweet which mostly hides a pleasantly subtle hop bite. refreshing and thirst quenching, though not too appealing on the palate."
"Drinkability: This is a one and done for me. I recommend this to those seeking a classic pilsner with mildly hoppy and citrus finish."
"Bottle. Grabbed this on a recent visit to the brewery and brew pub. Pours a clean golden yellow with a white head. No a whole lot of aroma going on except for some slight hops and grapefruit notes. Clean and crisp flavor. Some citrus notes. Has a nice lingering bitterness to it. Very good and refreshing overall for a pils."
"Drinkability was low. Sure the light character of the beer and low abv make it an easy drinker, but, the flavor wound up being way too off-putting. My wife who ordered it didn't want to finish it and we had the bar tender exchange it for an Edmund Fitzgerald. Sorry Wright Pils, but you didn't make the cut."
"Notes: A special treat to have this ""giftshop exclusive"" in bottles from Great Lakes. It was available on tap inside the brewery as well but I did not get the chance to enjoy it there. This is a solid American craft pilsener."
"D: A very pleasant, easy drinking pilsner from Great Lakes. It was certainly refreshing on a hot afternoon, and this is a welcome summer seasonal in my book."
"If Great Lakes is looking for a new summer seasonal, they need look no further than The Wright Pils. This should be the blueprint for any U.S. craft brewer who wants to compete with the best that Germany and The Czech Republic have to offer. Thanks to my brother for giving up his only bottle so that I could do a review."
"Exceptional drinkability. Very, very tasty while still being light, crisp and refreshing. Can I have another?"
"Overall, a very solid pils. One of the better pils I have had. Very drinkable and well to the style."
"D: Drinks very easily and is pretty interesting for a pilsner."
"Pours a straw-yellow with small, tight white head and very little lacing. Smells of grassy hops and almost like whole wheat bread. Lots of bready flavour to go with the grassy hop bitterness. Nice mouthfeel and a great drinker. Doesn't seem to be a lot going on with this, but it is a very well made pilsner. If this was available near me, I may buy it more."
"Thin beer with a slight aftertaste. Mild sweetness up front and not a lot of carbonation in the mouth. Overall I think its OK but not great. Second taste, quite drinkable. Some mild bitterness at the back but the aftertaste it gone. Again, a mild sweetness and a nice finish. I rather like this beer."
"For a regular pilsner, you aren't going to find many beers better than this. It has all the characteristics of a great pilsner plus some malt happiness thrown in there for good measure. However, it is a pilsner- and pilsners are middle of the road and made for your average beer drinker. The craft spirit is alive in The Wright Pils so let's hope this keeps them on the wright track. How about Imperial Black and Wright Pilsner? Just a suggestion...."
"The drinkability is 100%. Each sip leaves you wanting another. This is what a pilsner should be."
"Good mouthfeel; highly drinkable."
"Had this on-tap at the GLBC brewpub. Menu said it was 5.1% ABV. Served in a pint glass. Appearance is pale yellow, with a thin white head. Very good retention. Overall, very floral nose, with a little spike of hops. Great balanced flavor: honey sweet plus sweet and citrusy hops. VERY drinkable beer. Could easily down 2-3 of these in the spring or summer."
"Drinkability - delicious and easily sessionable, though I will understand if those at the GL pub move on to other offerings after this. Much thanks is in order to Greg who brought me a sixer of these. He's not a BA (not even a beer drinker), but has the spirit of one and was nice enough to hook me up with these, and wouldn't even let me pay him! I should have asked for a growler of Rackhouse, huh? ;-)"
"Overall, I can't say that a whole lot was going on with this beer but it was a pretty good representation for the style. If this is your type of beer I could easily see this being sessionable."
"A bit full for the style, with lower carbonation. Pretty easy to drink. Enjoyable."
"Crisp Golden pilsner with a nice bouquet of Czech hop aroma. 5.1% ABV, 40 IBU. Crystal clear golden color, standard pilsner appearance. The aroma is very well crafted and hoppy, spicy saaz. Same with the taste, grassy style hops, a little hops bitterness in the aftertaste, excellent as a summer beer. Not sure why the six packs are a pub exclusive. I'd guess it would sell well in distribution."
"D- Very easy to drink and a good example of the style."
"Eric"
"D-It really is a very easy drinking beer. I went over to the gift shop to try and pick up a six pack of this, but they didn't have them yet. Easily one of my favorite examples of a pilsener."
"Overall, I won't lie, pilseners aren't my favorite and I have had a lot of shitty ones. This one was done very well and had a lot of flavor...definitely unexpected. Another great beer from GLBC."
