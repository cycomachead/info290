"Clean, pale gold beer pours from the glass, leaving a thin, off-white head that is well-retained. Pils malt lends typical aromas of bread and dough, with hints of grain and grass noticeable, and a decent amount of spicy hops as well. Bready flavors are met with grain and barley. The malt sweetness is tamed by the grassy and spicy hops in the finish. Light bodied, this pilsener is also moderately carbonated."

"Aroma: citrusy Saaz hops work with bright, alluring malts--smells straight out of Eastern Europe... Appearance: swiftly effervescent, light golden body that rushes up the flute to stimulate a webbing three-finger white head... Palate: medium-bodied, slightly oily at the throat but substantial enough to be a lager... Taste: flavorful, zesty hops that awaken the tongue; refreshingly smooth, with the slightest hint of corn or hay; some banana and clove as well... Overall: pleasant, softly buffering pilsner--definitely a seasonal that I will seek out in its season..."

"Taste-Pilsner malt, bready, crisp and smooth. Very faint hop bite. More Saaz would have been more better, in my opinion. That being said, this brew is easily sessionable and would please the masses at a summer cookout."

"This is a nice pilsner that showed obvious signs of good quality. It always cracks me up when the Miller Lite commercials refer to their beer as a pilsner."

"This beer poured out as a clear pale yellow color with a fluffy white head on top. The smell of the beer was grainy with some soft grassy notes on the nose. The taste of the beer was decent, it had some light earthy flavors mixed with a bit of sweet grain with the lager yeast finishing up. The mouthfeel was thin but had a decent carbonation to it. Overall, Not the best Pilsner out there but I found it to be a good beer to start a night with and move on from there."

"Not bad, not great. Decent Pils, fairly refreshing, but lacking the clean, crisp character of the best of the style."
"O- Overall not a bad pilsener. Pretty nice aftertaste. Slightly above average."
"Taste starts with pale malt sweetness, lemony in the middle, with a medium crisp bitter close. Saaz is here, but muted. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, and drinkability is alright as well. Comes off kind of dumbed down, was hoping for a bit more depth in the flavors."
""
""
""
"D - It's not a terrible pils, but it suffers from simplicity and fair quality. Not one I'll have again."
"Overall-a very nice pilsner, doesn’t try to do too much but remains balanced and refreshing. A winner."
""
""
""
"This is a pretty good beer. It's brewed to style so nothing exceptional here, but it's smooth and balanced. The slight sweetness is really the only drawback."
""
""
""
"Appearance is beautiful, golden yellow with a full white frothy head, that lasts a decent amount of time. Laces nicely. Scent of citrusy hops. Mouthfeel is clean and crisp, no aftertaste lingering. This reminds me of my grandfather's beers. Tastes of hops and lemon zest! I'm going to get another one!"

"O: I've had realy good Czech style pilsners in my life so I know what the pinnacle is. This isn't that, but this is clearly above average especially in an American pils. Well made, great price, possibly the best Saranac I've had, haven't had one in a while."
"Overall, very solid beer near the other east coast pilsners but missing something."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An average to slightly above average example of the style. Nothing to write home about."
"a pretty standard czech style pils. lighter and a little more hoppy than its german counterpart. saranac does a decent job with this one, apparently adding some noble hop varieties for flavor. pours a standard golden color and has a small white head. smells more oppy than most. saaz hops? a mellow malty body and vibrant carbonation make this fairly drinkable, if unexciting. hoppy enough to go in their winter mixer. not bad, not great"
""
""
"Pours a deep golden color with a decent white head that dissipates slowly leaving minimal lace. Smells of bready grain with a hint of butterscotch and earthy spicy grassy hops. Taste is a little sweet and lacking enough hops. Sweet bready almost honey like malt with a smidgen of spicy hops. Medium body with a crisp level of carbonation and a sweet almost sticky mouthfeel. Decent flavorful beer, but not quite a bohemian pilsner."
""

"nice mouthfeel, crisp with a little spice. easy drinking beer good alternative to macros if you want something good thats not too intense."
"O- nothing groundbreaking, I prefer more hops in my pils, but this is a solid session beer non the less."
"Although I would have wanted a crisper hop bite up front it still has enough of earthy floral bitterness until the sweetness from the Pilsener malt seems to come in out of nowhere and really balance it. This is my favorite thing about this beer even with it being a general straight forward offering. The fruitiness builds from the yeast strain and from some of the hops although the hops give more of an earthy Noble hop taste more than anything. While not quite as good as the Prima Pils or Dogfish Heads My Antonia I still like this one better than European Pilseners."
"Bright sunny fall day and looking for refreshment... This is a pretty decent, highly carbonated (to a fault) easy drinker. Light tan color, white head that disappeared quickly. Clean finish, fairly hopped but the carbonation is a bit much. Reminds me a bit of a higher priced, but no better, pbr. That's not a knock, I like pbr."
"Bummer, I like skunky, wasn't in the taste either. Rather plain, high carbonation excentuated the hopping and a prickly feeling, but substantive taste profile was lacking. Light mineral and grain mouthfeel. Bitterness is up. Whats the deal, they can't hop an ipa or pale to save their life, but here, they get it right, almost to the point of being on the high end, but I guess I shouldn't complain, just pointing out a weird phenomenon."
"Overall a light and refreshng beer, just seems a little too light, makes it a bit watery. Not too bad though!"
"very light golden pour with loads of carbonation and a little head of white that seems to stick on top for just the slighest bit of time. aroma is light biscuit, hints of grain, touches of light banana an spice. taste is about the same but seems to be just a touch off for me. not the way it is supposed to work for sure. light finish leaves almost no aftertaste and it is over before it began."
"O- Not a fan. I am not a Saranac fan and I'm very touchy when it comes to pilsners (and even more so I don't have an extreme amount of familiarity with Czech pils, so that makes it harder) but this beer was not what I wanted. It wasn't refreshing, it wasn't flavorful, it didn't have a good aroma... Decent to look at, but thats about it. Took me a very long time to finish and I ended up dumping the last two gulps down the drain because it just wasn't worth waiting around for another half hour to finish..."
"D- Very drinkable. Refreshing with just enough flavor."
"D- An easy drinking beer that has enough flavor to be decent, but it tastes somewhat uninspired."
"This is a light bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation that is prickly on the tongue. It finishes crisp but leaves an uncharacteristic off flavor inside the mouth taste like minerals and suflur which is not enjoyable. The sub 5% abv allows it to be easy drinking but I couldn't finish the glass let alone go for another. Perhaps if this was served mouth numbingly cold I might have enjoyed it a bit more. I would not try this one again."
"Decent beer. Not the greatest Czech pilsner, but also not the worst."
"While this brew might be clean and lager-like it does not resemble the pilseners I have had over the years ... decent but one bottle was more than enough."
"No lingering aftertaste. This beer is ""ok""."
"However, this was really great (in my minds eye this is what an old world beer would taste like). After taste was oily at begining but quickly righted itself for a great rich bready pilsner with a bit of caraway smell. Not a fan of dry finishes, but it really works and I wouldn't want this too sweet anyway. Carbination goes from sharp to creamy. I actually think its better that Pilsen Urquel. I have a feeling this would be awesome with Brats and hope this becomes an annual offering."
"Drinkability is pretty good. Crisp, flavorful (for a Pils) and looking good. Would work fine as a session beer or lawnmower beer. This is what ""Tripple Hops"" beer should taste like."
"D - I wouldn't say that this is a ""world class"" pils, but it's pretty darn good. This is the second beer in a row from Saranac that I was pleasantly surprised by. A large amount of flavor with a reasonable ABV. If you're a pils fan, give this a go."
"Real beer lovers would love any beer meeting the standard of any beer style. Exceeding is not necessary, but a treat."
"Light yellow hue, as clear as a consommé (you can read the letters on a dime at the bottom of the glass), with a thin, very white head. Nose is crisp and dry with distinct Saaz notes (bit of lemon peel, and hint of spice), but on the faint side. Medium-thin body, thick for the style, with a moderate carbonation. Mild, sweet, dry, bready malt, weak hop character. Dry finish, slight hop bitterness emerging, but mostly bread. Very easygoing but somewhat boring."
"A perfectly drinkable pilsener."
"Pours a clean, straw yellow with a white head. In the aroma, dry malt and saaz hops. In the taste, dry malt and a small hop presence, but quite malty for a pils. A small bite and medium to light bodied mouthfeel, with a dry malty aftertaste. OK, decent pils, but nothing too exciting."
"D: Was hoping for more, did get better as it warmed up."
"A nice easy drinker to start off the 1/1/11. I've really become smitten with the Saaz hop and the pilsner style lately, and this one surely did not disappoint."
"Definitely take your time with this one, warming helps just about every aspect of the beer (except for the smell which got worse.)"
"First sip is... refreshing. Nice crisp finish with a detectable spicy hop bitterness. Malt sweetness is present but mild. There is a bit of a bite on the end. There is a little bit of fruity flavor in the middle that isn't quite appropriate for the style - but that is a relatively minor criticism. Overall a very nice beer."
"Good summer lawnmower beer."
"D - This is a true Pilsner. Highly drinkable. Great session beer."
"D- This one was ok but it really lacked in flavor and aroma."
"This was a very unique beer from an American Craftbrewer Saranac. It as a wonderful appearance for a pilsner with a 2 finger head and nice retention. It surprisingly tastes very much like a German/Czech pilsner and if I were given a blind taste test would have not guessed it as American. With that said the taste left somewhat bland and could use some bolder flavoring."
"for me this is a middle of the road beer"
"D: Easy to drink for sure, but nothing special."
"The flavor is a disappointment but the feel and drinkability is spot on. I would never seek this beer out but I have no issues drinking it."
"All in all, my favorite offering in this formidable winter variety pack."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: Not undrinkable, not a beer I'd be happy to return to, unless someone had it as a lawnmower brew and offered me one."
"Slainte."
"D - Extremely drinkable beer. Super smooth and crisp. Could use a bit more flavor and punch, but it is also far from empty. The flavor profile is really nice and balanced overall, especially the hops."
"D-Not overly drinkable in winter. Summer it would be fine but I really am curious why it is in a winter pack."
"High drinkability, but personally I wouldn't buy a six pack of this. Glad its part of the Saranac mix, but not worth picking out at a beer distributor."
"12oz bottle purchased as part of their winter season 12pk at Shaw's. Pours a straw-yellow crystal-clear body with nearly an inch of off-white head. Smells bready with hints of butter and cooked vegetable. Tastes sweet and bready with a decent butter presence and hints of cooked vegetable toward the finish. Light bodied with moderate carbonation. An easy drinker for sure. Could afford to be cleaned up a little but for the most part pleasant and to style. Solid."
"Light, golden straw color with a moderate white head that fades quickly, leaving a thin whispy layering on top of the brew. I notice some veg-all aromas at first, then citrus, sweet malty notes, some grassy hints in there as well. Bitter, lemon zest taste with some floral notes, slight citrus, and lightly sweet with a tart finish. Nice light body with some intense carbonation, high drinkability overall."
"Sharp and crisp up front with dryness throughout. A higher carbonation level and a thinner body, even for the style. Overall, I would say, I'm not a fan of this rendition. Not generally characteristic of Saranac, I'd venture to say."
"The light body and high-ish carbonation that makes many Saranac ales dissapointing actually works with their lagers. Bohemian Pilsner is true to the style. Nice noble hops, great balance. Not sure why its in the winter pack, but I'm glad I got to try it."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some grains. Taste is crisp, grains are present, a touch of hops, not bad but nothing special. Feels light in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a fairly average beer."
"Poured into a Sam Adams Summer Ale glass, color is straw yellow, 1-finger head disappears into nothing quickly, and there is no lacing whatsoever. Okay so, this beer should be consumed immediately after removing from the fridge, as any warmth contributes to terrible skunk. No aroma -- just light malts. Taste is clean, light malts, no hops, and not a total palate killer, but should be consumed while ICE cold. The only difference between this beer and a Milwaukee's Best Light is that this won't sting your mouth as much. That's it though."
"D - Goes down easy. Very clean and smooth. One of the high points for a rather average beer."
"12oz bottle and the final beer I've reviewed from the 12 Beers of Winter pack. Pours a clear straw yellow with minimal head. No lacing. Aromas of malt and grains. Taste is more of the same of the malts and grains. This beer is drinkable but doesn't have much else going for it. Probably the least flavorful of the lot. Tastes slightly better than your average Pilsenser."
"D- saranac has a decent pilsner here that has good flavor and is drinkable. it's acceptable as a part of this mixer... Just not the best in the pack"
"D: it is a very smooth drinking brew but, as with most pilsners, there just isnt enough flavor for me to want to drink more"
"D. I might think about finishing the other one in the sampler pack but then again I might not."
"3.0 D: Saranac can't help but make boring, easily quaffable brews."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink but just an average example of the style"
"Not equal to the top PA pilsners, but overall a pleasant surprise."
"D - Pilseners are not a style that I generally like but I got this in a mix pack and gave it a try and was very surprised with it very easy to drink with a good taste a very good beer at a good value worth trying"
"Pours a faint yellow like straw. The taste is clean with a little hint of hops. Nothing over the top. There is also a hint of a floral taste with a little honey. The smell is slightly floral. The mouthfeel is crisp. Overall a mediocre beer. Is decent for a pilsner compared to marco's but not as good as other micros."
"Very quaffable, and certainly a nice, well-crafted example of the original pale lager. Slight overuse of hops or perhaps a bit too many minerals in the brewing water send out a touch too much bitterness, but aside from that it is a decidedly well-balanced and refreshing Bohemian-style Pilsner."
"D: A decent pilsner. I'm glad I tried it, but I don't see myself ever seeking this one out. Why does Saranac put this in their winter sampler?"
"Drinks easy, not a bad take on the style"
"Drinkability: Can't be more than 5% abv, which is what drags this one up to a 4.0. It's not great - it's not even really good - but it's not bad, and it's smooth, inoffensive, light and crisp, and on the whole pretty easygoing. I wouldn't mind having this one at a BBQ or at any plain' ol' summer day, outside event."
"A decent beer."
"Drinkability is not very good. It just didn't seem to measure up to some of the other good European pilseners I've had."
"Drinkability: Decent beer. Not what you'd expect in a winter brew mix pack, but a change is good. Not my favorite pilsner, but not a bad beer by any means."
"D - Crisp, but the sour flavor takes away from the drinkability. I got this in a mixed pack, but would not buy this one on its own."
"Steve"
"D: I can't really say that this is a good beer, but it is certainly drinkable. This would be good for one of those nights where you want a decent, consistent beer without having your tongue assaulted by a barrage of strong and unique flavors."
"D: Not very flavorful, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, it's not a bad beer but there really isn't enough to it that would make me want to drink it again."
"This is a refreshing brew and a nice traditional take on the style. True to style. More expected in the summer pack, but nice to have a ""refresher"" in the winter to change things up!"
"Pours a nice clean and clear golden color with just a bit of head and minimal lacing. Crisp and malty scent, if a little skunky. Decent taste, crisp and clean, but little in the way of esters, spice, or anything else besides malt. Goes down fine, although there's quite a bit of carbonation. It would've been an excellent macro lager, but is just a passable pils."
"D: Pretty solid. No alcohol taste, which is nice. Goes down easy."
"Taste - A very nice balance of malts and grains, almost honey-like without the color. Mild overall. A decent Pilsner and probably onje of the better choices from the Saranac Winter mixed 12-pack. Liked this one a lot."
"The aroma is malty with noticeable grassy hops. The appearance is pale gold with an average foamy head that leaves lace in the glass. The flavor is like the aroma which means its simple but effective and tastes good. The palate is just right. This is a good example of the style and has no funk or negative qualities whatsoever."
"Poured this into a 12oz ""pint"" glass and formed a 1/2"" head that disipated quickly leaving very light lacing around the edges to the bottom of the glass. The color is straw yellow with a good amount of carbonation. The smell is very soft with flowery hops and sweet yeasty bread. The flavor is also soft, almost buttery in feel with sweet notes in front and at the side of the palate and a soft bitterness that lingers for a bit in the not-too-dry finish. There's a citrus note also in the finish that I didn't detect earlier. I think I prefer this Czech style pils over the German styles and their more aggressive hop rates so I'll have to rate this pretty high on the drinkability scale; in fact I think I'll have another right now."
"Pours a clear golden with a thin white head. Not much in the way of retention, but a nice lacing. Lots of bubbles. Aroma is of grassy hops. Body is light with a lot of carbonation. Taste is malty up front with a bit of hops in the finish. Not my favorite style of beer, but not a bad representation."
"Not a world-class pilsner, but not bad either. Should be added as a regular in the summer pack."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- A quick, fleeting moderate carbonation rises and falls in seconds... the swallow comes and goes without much to talk about. As far as drinkability is concerned, I am floored at the similarities here to Budweiser. Unless you're perfectly happy with a *very* simple, safe example of this style that does not showcase the ingredients effectively, look elsewhere."
"D - Looks good and smells good, but falls flat in all other areas... An honest attempt at the style and far from drain pour, but not a brew I would seek out in the future, too many other quality Czech Pilsners to choose from..."
"D - This is actually a pretty good representation of the Czech pils style. Easy drinking and light is seems like it should be in their summer pack not the winter pack."
"D - As with most beers of this style, very drinkable."
"D: Not too heavy for more than one, but not flavorful enough to even want to finish your first."
"12 ounce bottle, part of Saranac's ""12 Beers of Winter"" sampler. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours a clear straw gold color with a half inch white head. Head retention and lacing are both average. It smells like bready malt and a tiny bit of grassy hops. To me it smells more like a macro lager than a traditional pilsner, but the aroma is clean and not offensive at all. The taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like bready malt, grain and a little bit of grassy hops. It does finish nice and crisp. Mouthfeel/body is light with good carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's pretty easy to drink and it wouldn't be hard to have a few of these. This isn't a bad beer, but if I was in the mood for a pilsner I would pick something else. However, it is worth a try."
"As far as pilsners go, this is a great example. It might not be the best looking, but definitely something that stands up."
"D: A nice mouthfeel and taste combination, but the maltiness could have been a bit more robust in the taste. Overall, still a good beer and I would recommend that they include it in their summer offerings as opposed to the winter mixer as this beer is a much better summer beer."
"Probably the most surprising and tasty brew out of the Saranac winter variety this year. Unfortunately, Matt Brewing will likely never produce it again or omit it from the variety next year."
"A clean and refreshing beer with a biscuity pilsner malt profile. Just a mini hop snap on the finish. The mouthfeel is pretty soft. Quite drinkable overall."
"D - This is a nice Czech-style pilsner, but I think the hop emphasis probably puts it closer to its German cousin. Nonetheless, it is a tasty beer and worth a try - very sessionable."
"pours a clear pale gold color w/ a thick pillowy white head that quickly settles leaving little lacing in my pilsen glass ; not much of a smell, hints of steely grain and some grassy hops ; taste is a bit thin as well, starts out well w/ a crisp hop bite combined a bready malt backing then quickly petering out, finishes well however ; slightly dry and light bodied brew, plenty of carbonation leaves a creamy feeling on the tongue ; a quaffable brew for sure, not a stand out pilsner, but not a bad on either..."
"MF&D - Thin bodied and pretty easy drinking. Not nearly enough flavor to want another."
"Good mouth feel. A bit thin, but all pilseners are. People who like the style will love this effort. As with all pilseners, drinkability is the strength of this brew."
"(rated Nov 28, 2008)"
"M/D - light bodied beer, very easy drinking although my bottle seemed slightly overcarbonated"
"Longneck from the 12 beers of winter pack served into an oversized Pilsner glass. Brilliant light golden in the glass with an airy white head that is dropping at a pretty good rate. Fairly active carbonation rising up - quarter inch of head holding on with a bit of stick. Aroma of spicy hop, grass, light grain, corn. Quick smack of spicy bitterness to start and following through mid-palate. Finishes off with a subtle smooth grainy close. Medium in body with a fairly smooth carbonation. A great drinking and tasting lager to mix in with some of the more typical heavy and dark beers of winter. Crisp and clean with a noticible noble hop quality. A surprising addition to the winter 12, but a crafty move on Saranac's part I think."
"Definitely one of the best efforts I've seen from Saranac and pretty tasty regardless of the season."
"It pours a golden clear with a inch and half head that disipates very quickly to nothing.Almost no carbonation.Smells very dank ( I am not to good yet with the ingredient's yet). A very sweet taste goes down very smooth. I got this in a holiday pack and I wouldn't buy this if sold on it's own."
"Pours a super transparent golden orange hue with a medium size head that vanishes quickly and leaves only a thin net of foam only small clusters of slow rising carbonation attempt to support the head. Something is off with the nose, way too much malt sweetness going on, as well as a subtle herbal/grassy hop character which, in actuality, should the focus. Too large in body to rival the drinkability of its true Czech brethren, sweet caramel malt, corn husk, and only a subtle burst of bitterness on the finish. Overall, im disappointed, i guess i expected a more crisp and lively interpretation of the style."
"D - My favorite Pilsner so far! The label was right, this beer does indeed beg to have another taste and I'm quite upset that i've gone through both the Bohemian Pilseners in my winter sampler. Two for Two so far Saranac, very impressed."
"3.3/5"
"I feel the same of this beer."
"My previous Pilsener experience being concerned with Miller Lite had blacklisted this style for me. It's back on the list baby!"
"Medium bodied, nicely carbonated, a real nice mouthfeel. I could drink a few of these for sure."
"Quite drinkable to me, as any well crafted pilsener is."
"Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of a medium body, crisp and smooth. I really enjoy how hoppy this beer is, and I could easily drink quite a few. Very sessionable and solid beer here."
"Drinkability is good. It's easy to drink and having a few in a row doesn't bring out the alcohol."
"Out of a mixed twelve pack this beer was a straw gold color that displayed perfect clarity. The head was two fingers thick, off-white, displayed mediocre retention and left some bands of lacing. The aroma was very dry, grainy and 'bright,' bursting with pilsner malt and floral hops to the point of being perfume-like. The first flavors that hit me were clean pilsner malt with hints of biscuit and a semi-sweetness similar to an apple. Hints of lemon and yeast. Good mouthfeel, light bodied and very dry as per the style. A great American example of a Czech Pilsener and quite refreshing."
"Drinkability: Highly drinkable and generally enjoyable."
"Pours a dark yellow color with a nice white head that fades fast but leaves lacing. The smell is light of some malt and hops, with some yeasty notes. The taste follows suit some light hop and malt flavor with the yeast notes following in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is nice, light, and smooth. Nice carbonation, good balance in flavor, not powerful, but gets the job done. This is an easy drinker, a good pilsner, an enjoyable beer."
"D: Not too bad, especially for a saranac pilsener. I find their beers normally have a distinct aroma and flavor but it isn't present in this light beer."
"Drinkability: What can I say? I grew up loving Pilsners and this one is a perfect stab at the style. You can tell the hops in this have been carefully selected, and the refreshing, yet drinkable finish of this makes this an excellent beer. Should it be included in a Winter Seasonal Pack? NO. But this is still a good brew and a good stab at Pilsner styling from Saranac."
"It is very similar to the Saranac Kolsch with a firmer bitterness."
"This brew is new to the Saranac Christmas mix. The brew poured to a light yellow color with a fair sized white head that broke down quite quickly. Light grain notes come through giving that seem to give a slight toasted aroma mixed with Saaz hops. The flavors are very clean, the malts come out very nicely and give a nice toasted feel to the flavor. Also the break at the end of the hops, while very subtle is very good. Seems to have just the right amount of carbonation. I think what is nice about this Pilsner is that when compared to the imports that I have has, this seems so fresh. This would be a good brew to include in the summer pack and/or just have this one in 6/12 packs like the pale ale, etc. as I would get this brew for the summer months, very refreshing!"
"had both from the winter 12 mixer dont think I'd search it out again but I'm not much for Pilseners anyway"
"Tastes a lot like most Bohemian Pilsners/Czech Pilsners I've had. Pours dark yellow with good clarity and head. I feel like I should be drinking about a liter of this out of a stein in order to get the full experience of this but it's not bad in a pint glass. I never know what really makes for the ""rich"" flavor unique to bohemian pilsners It tastes like a mixture of corn and diacetyl. Not unpleasant but I feel like a lot of beer people would think it is a flaw, even if it's part of the style. Still tasty nonetheless. Bit of a soapy mouthfeel, with a lot of grainyness in the nose. Not bad, I get a little sick of that super rich taste after a bit though."
"Appears a pale straw colored golden hue with a bright white head, forms thick and dwindles slowly leaving thin speckled lacing all around my glass. Mild sweetness with biscuit pilsner malt and lemongrass light zesty hop spice character flowing together. Flavors have a crisp sweetness with ample bitterness, very solid mix of malt and hops. Not an over the top Czech pils, but if this sold in sixpacks it would be really popular. More zesty hops with light lemongrass citrus hop qualities and balancing light toasted malts. Mouthfeel is light bodied, with refreshingly crisp carbonation. Drinkability is solid all around easy going hoppy pils, very enjoyable."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a solid pilsner malt scent along with a light Czech hop aroma. It's crisp and refreshing. The taste is good as well. It has an easy drinking pilsner malt flavor that goes down quick and finishes clean with a bit of Saaz hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a pretty well brewed pilsner. It tastey and easy drinking."
"Overall a tasty and very easy to drink pils."
"D - Near perfect drinkability. The balance in this beer is nearly flawless. Good stuff."
"This is an above average, highly drinkable beer for sure.. why is it in a winter seasonal? I have no idea, but that's besides the fact. Definitely tastes like a Bitburger AKA straight out of Europe kinda pilsener, so it's nice and tart and easy to drink. Goes down smooth and easy with a nice sparking gold color. Great beer.. but they should include this in the summer sampler in the future."
"This is my first review. And it's fitting that the beer should be Saranac, because my heart has a fondness for this brewery that cannot be surpassed. Especially when it comes to the annual winter variety pack. Each of the new offerings in the 08 edition is worthy of honorable mention - don't miss the Vanilla Stout and India Brown - but the Bohemian Pilsner warrants singular praise. This beer is exactly what I might have hoped for but not necessarily what I was expecting, and you know what I mean if you have followed Saranac through its various iterations. The appearance is pleasingly golden, more European than American. And the semi-sweet maltiness is well balanced with hops, evident in both taste and aroma. I have to say, if given the choice between this beer and a well known import version of the same, I'm choosing Saranac two out of three times. And if that isn't a glowing review of a Saranac offering..."
"All in all a tasty, albeit highly hopped example of the style. I could definitely see myself buying sixers of this if it were available in that package."
"This beer poured a corn yellow with a single-finger head that lasted a little while. The smell pretty tight with some grains, and malts. The taste starts off with some sweet malt that is quickly cut by some very nonaggressive malts that leads to a very clean and crisp finish. The carbonation and lightness of the beer makes for a very clean and crisp mouthfeel. Coincidentally, this also makes the beer very drinkable, moreso than most Saranac offerings."
"D. Fairly drinkable and light. Not a bad beer by any means. Pairs well with assorted sushi and other fish."
"Nice beer although not entirely memorable."
"Pours a clear yellow color with a thin white head that disappears before you can get started. Smells of metallic and bad yeast. Just a very off smell. Tastes stale spiced water with a sour aftertaste. Its just not a good beer. Tastes like a miller or coors light but worse. Stay away."
"It actually feels pretty good: creamy and fizzy. But overall, this is a very weak offering. A slightly better lager with some okay hops. I should probably evaluate it at face value, because if this was made by Pabst I'm thinking I would probably be singing its praises. But for Saranac, it's disappointing."
"D: Easy drinker that has the taste that is very true to style just a tad to heavy to be as refreshing as others."
"The beer is mild, crisp, medium-bodied and very refreshing. A nicely drinkable brew."
"Pours a crystal clear light gold hue with a egg white one finger head that falls to a thin layer of fluffy clouds. Some thin lace remains on the sides of the glass with hundreds of tiny bubbles racing to the top. Bready malt and saaz hops in the nose with a touch of toasted grains. Candy sugar and faint grassy hops in the aroma as well. Very crisp smelling pils. Crisp noble hops up front on the tongue with a sweet biscuity flavor to follow. Lightly toasted grains and a floral hops midway with a clean finish of pale malts with a dusting of pepper. Light to medium body with a creamy smooth feel. A lively carbonation to an extremely drinkable lager. Pleasant surprise from Saranac for sure, one of their better offerings I've had as of late. A unique style to put in a winter seasonal mix 12-pack, but I'm not complaining. The first out of six is a winner, hopefully the rest follow suit. Cheers to Saranac, keep up the good work!"
"D: Wow -- by far Saranac's best offering. I have sample over 15 of their beers over the last few years, and this one surpasses them all (which isn't always saying much). It presents a classic pilsener with generous malting and straightforward but bold Saaz hopping -- a really excellent pils. Saranac needs to make this available year-round. It stands up to Victory Prima Pils and Clipper City Small Craft Warning for overall quality."
"A decent pilsener that I consider to be highly drinkable. Not too sweet and the emphasis on hops is a big help. I enjoy it."
"Notes: This is a new brew for Saranac and a new addition to there Winter mixed 12 pack."
