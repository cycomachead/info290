"Overall, a fine and refreshing pilsner that goes down great. A ""yellow"" beer with lots of flavor."
"Overall: well done pilsener, very much to style."
""
""

"Pils pours a golden color with not much of a head. There is a nice crisp aroma with small hints of floral hops. The taste is very crisp and rich, with some noticeable hop flavors that leaves just a hint of bitterness. Good body, and very nice strong flavors. Overall its a nice strong pils, with a nice noticeable hop and bitterness."

"Schell's Pils is just plain wonderful. Need I say more? Dozens of small craft breweries pine for being as successful as Schell's. Summit has made it. Sierra Nevada has made it. Sam Adams has made, and hundreds more. When it is all said and done, good ""old"" Schell's, right in our backyard has been one to succeed !"

"It's a yellow beer with a solid sheet of fine, bone white foam that seems unrelenting. Smells like grain, hints of corn, some sweetness, some metal. Flavor is what I would consider pretty hoppy for the style; sharp musty hops with some hints of resin and metal alongside a nice crisp malt undertow. Medium bodied with moderate carb and a nice dry finish. Nice beer."

"O Good pilsener. Although not a staple of the style, I like the hit of hops. Clean and refreshing. Any fan of the style will dig Schell's Pils."

"This is actually a really damn good pilsner. It's a bit more aggressive in the hopping than I am used to, but like any good Midwestern lager, it is still delicately balanced and refined. It is effervescent yet silky across the tongue, too!"
""
""
""
"O- A very enjoyable pilsner. Not my favorite style but this was one of the better examples I've tasted. Clean and crisp without sacrificing flavor. Hint of malt sweetness balanced by earthy noble hop character."
""
"Thanks to fLax for this one!"
""
""
""
"O: Great drinkability. A great german pilsner in my book. Schell's really knows how to brew their lagers."
""
""
"Decent as far as beers go, pretty damn good considering the style."
""
""
"Overall: A pretty good American take on a Pilsner. Good balance of bready sweetness and spicy hops."
"Final Thoughts: I actually thought this beer was pretty average for a pilsener. It was much tastier when I had it on-tap a few months ago though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this beer like their others is well crafted and distributed pretty well. Stacks up next to the better ones."

"Pours a straw yellow color with a white head; head dissipates slowly. Very clear as expected with evident carbonation. Pleasant grassy hop aroma, not a lot of maltiness on the nose. Flavor is very good, with more hop bitterness than expected. Good balance and a nice dry finish. Mouthfeel is great for the style: carbonation is perfect, appropriate viscosity, leaves a very nice flavor in the mouth. Overall this is a pretty great domestic pils. Very drinkable, free of off flavors. I would definitely get this one again."
"D/O: This Bavarian-style pilsner is a rare flower bomb. Although it isn't a beer that seems likely to shock, it manages to catch the palate completely off-guard with the emphasis it places upon floral tincture. The quality is nothing like the airy and dilute floral of Cascade hops, yet it stops short of tasting artificial. It is hard to predict how such a beer would be received by drinkers."

"All around, this is a relatively easy drinking beer at somewhat of a premium price for what you get."
"Straw yellow color with a touch of gold, but the appearance is about the only thing average about this beer. Smells clean and fresh with light lemony hops and rich biscuity notes. Tastes exceptionally good. My favorite US produced Pils is generally Trumer Pils, and I give Schell's a better score. Trumer seems a bit thin and weak in comparison. This is rich with great grain flavors, lemony biscuit flavors, minty, with (what should be if it's not...) an award winning clean dry hops finish which is why I like Pilsner beer so much in the first place. The 5.0 score goes to the mouthfeel: just incredible carbonation; spiky at first and expanding until it thins on the swallow. Perfect weight for this style, not too thin or thick. I can't see any lover of great Pilsner beer not going absolutely crazy for this beer."
""
"Overall - Not a favorite of mine, a little too bitter. But it's still good and very refreshing."
""
"O- Alright, it is decent but nothing too great."
""
""
"Translucent pale straw color, one finger short lived head with large amounts of lacing, a bit under-carbonated but medium bodied, smells of faint citrus hopping over a sweeter pilsener malt. Tastes of much the same, but more lemoney than citric in hopping, not as much spiciness as a typical pilsener, a bit sweeter than the typical pilsener as well...but none of these issues are really dealbreakers in severity."
"Overall: A very delicious pilsner with a refreshingly light body that is perfect for an afternoon on the boat or would make a very nice session beer."
"O- Eh, it's drinkable enough, but the flavor profile doesn't fit my idea of a top notch pilsner."
"D – Very drinkable brew, another good brew from Schell’s. A nice summer sipper with a clean and fresh taste. Very easy to have more than one of these. I recommend this brew."
"O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a very solid beer worth pounding down for a long time."
"""Schell's Pils"" says the bottle. Clear, pale yellow, with a bumpy head that dissipates into a thin bubbly islands. Smells of cereal grains and noble hops hit me on the first pour, which kind of got me excited about drinking this beer, but as I dig into it, I have trouble finding that floral-cracker connection again. Not a ton going on in the glass. I could tell this is a bit high abv for the style. Not that I am a stickler for such guidelines, but the higher abv does nothing for the beer other than to mask the delicate pilsner malt. I can taste the hops just fine, a nice clean bitterness to go with the warm alcohol. I still get some floral notes from the post-sip lingerings. Not a bad drinker overall."
"Overall: Clean and easy drinking, if not outstanding in any significant way."
"O - I was not expecting much out of this one, but for a pilsener it's pretty good. Thanks, Schell's!"
"Poured to a nice slightly offwhite head in color. Beer itself was golden yellow in color. The two fingered head didnt hang around very long. Just around the edges. Left some lacing at first then that dissapated. light in smell, just of lemon or citrus. Had a slight bitter aftertaste. The bitter aftertaste seemed to hang in the mouth for a little while. Also notes of lemon or citrus. Felt good in the mouth. Carbonation was right. I didnt care for the bitter aftertaste. Maybe if this brew was ice cold some of the bitterness would go away and bring out the citrus. I only had one bottle to try."
"D/O- I remember this being better the last time I had it which must have been a few years ago. Still, a quality example of the style and if I lived in Minnesota (or anywhere distributed) it would be a go-to lower ABV summer beer."
"D: This may be my summer drinker, I am thinking. At least the one to have around the house."
"Drinkability: A nice no frills pils. Very true to the style. I can dig it."
"The pour was decent. Very clear golden straw in color with lots of carbonation bubbling up to the surface. A big head of white quickly faded but was replaced by a broken crown that clung to the sides of the glass. Aroma is light grain and hay, a touch of light piney hops as it warms, but nothing really bowling me over here. As you take a sip, it is very clean, very crisp, but does not have a terribly great depth of flavor. Light grain note, light bittering hops in the finish, but the flavor is fleeting and leaves the mouth dry and looking for a sip of something else very quickly. Most likely the reason this one went by soo quickly."
"This is a bright looking offering with a best by date on the neck of 031311. Appears a brilliant golden hue straw colored really with a bright white eggshell like head. Forms fine speckled lacing down the sides of my glass. Aroma has a bit of sulfur going on with, lemongrss/herbal and a bready pale malt breadiness with hints of mineral water. Flavor citric/lemongrass hops actually not bad at all, not strictly German style but it's got a craft brewing approach. Harsh bitterness is a bit lingering, compared to a classic clean pils. Mouthfeel is light bodied effervescent sturdy carbonation, I talked about the finish. Drinkability overall is pretty solid a nice example of a pils, just not as good as the PA versions."
"D: Okay but not worth seeking out (unless you really love pilsners...)"
"D: There isn't much special about this beer, but it is very drinkable and there is really nothing negative or offensive about it. Considering the delivery of quality Schell's offers for the price, I wouldn't mind keeping some of this in my cooler."
"- Definite drinkability, a solid beer choice."
"Notes: This pils is light in body, yet very flavorful. A rock solid brew from the folks at Schell's, as it has superb drinkability. The definition of a session beer."
"Grassy hops are showcased nicely and get a little bit floral on the finish. Malts are very light and pretty much only add a mildly sweet backdrop and a surprisingly creamy body. Lots of hop flavor and lots of bitterness make this finish very crisp. Not the smoothest pilsner out there, even a little rough around the edges...but pretty enjoyable and a good offering from Schell's."
"Not a lot going on, but the bitterness is surprisingly prominant. A nice session beer find, doesn't hurt that is was the cheapest craft beer in the shop."
"Pours a pale golden with a decent head that shows moderate retention, and leaves minimal lacing. Decent, but very subdued aroma: the hops that are detactable lend a nice, citrus/berry and pine presence. Taste is also a bit subdued, but it is pleasantly hoppy, with just a hint of malt to be found. Mouthfeel is smooth, but unexpectedly undercarbonated. All in all, a decent and drinkable beer, though not outstanding in any respect."
"pours a golden yellow color with a nice white ring and lacing on side of glass looks good ..smell is floral hops with grassy and grain and malt smells ..taste is crisp with a hops and malts nicely balanced..this is not the best pils out there but its still very good crisp clean and refreshing"
"Overall, the beer is one of the better American attempts at the Pils style."
"Not bad. Fairly drinkable."
"Schell's makes good beer especially when it comes to lagers. The deer brand, mai bock and octoberfest are prime examples of this. But the Pilsner is hands down the best. The balance of hop and malt is nearly perfect, few so called pilsners can come close to pilsner urquell the original, and Schells Pilsner is the best american example. Best drank when poured into a pilsner glass to appreciate the color and head that never fades away. Well worth the 11.49 a 12'er it has been at St. Anthony for the last year."
"An Ok to goodish Pils that's simple with a touch of German complexity. A definate drinker for the warmer/hotter day of Spring/Summer that screams outdoor activity refreshment."
"Crisp, clean, light bodied, and properly carbonated. This is a Pilsner the way it is meant to be. Very drinkable, and my favorite Pilsner on the market so far."
"IMO, this was not a remarkable beer except for one thing - the salt taste that I got made this beer for me. The was the sixth beer from a Schell's sampler that I have tried, and I have been impressed by the sampler. In fact, I have already returned to the store to buy 2 more sixers of the stout."
"Drinkability: Great thirst quencher. Over the years, this beer has become better balanced and more smooth."
"A nicely-made pils - certainly ""sessionable"" - This is what the macro ""pilseners"" should be!"
"Not as clean as I would prefer my pils - but nothing really wrong with this beer."
"Pretty good beer overall. Reminds me a little of Grain Belt."
"D - It's just a touch too bitter for me but is a good, flavorful pilsner that's also fairly drinkable. Not my favorite style but one of the better versions of it certainly."
"Was invited to the beer bus tour of the August Schell brewery in New Ulm but had to work. Decided to buy the sampler pack and take my own mini tour. This is #1 of 6 styles (going to drink them in order from least to most anticipated) and I'm now really looking forward to the rest of them."
"D= Extremely drinkable. This is a hell of a session beer and makes me wish I could get it regularly. If I could, this would be my lawnmower, baseball game tailgating beer of choice."
"This is a very drinkable beer, I could drink quite a few of these bad boys and love every sip."
"I liked it."
"Pours a nice golden straw color with nice head and nice bubbles, with a bit of decent lacing. Great scent, a deeply sweet malty aroma with a hint of pepper. Excellent taste, refreshing and crisp, a great malty sweet beer with a nice slight pepper finish (nice noble hops). Goes down wonderfully smooth. A great lawnmower beer, or any time beer really."
"this is the 3rd beer out of the schell sampler i have tried and so far they are 2 of 3 - i would buy this one again"
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Highly carbonated and light bodied."
"D-An easy-drinking, full-flavored pilsner. Accessible and smooth, though not amazing. However, I bet this one would be an amazing post-lawnmowing beer :D"
"D: A basic but good German pilsener."
"Great hot weather beer. As easy to drink as any of this style. Easier to drink with each sip."
"D: This is an excellent session beer. It's fairly restrained in the flavor department, but I found myself enjoying it."
"Conclusion: Not a bad pilsener, but nothing stand-outish at the same time."
"Gives me something to look forward to after the 8 hour trip back to Iowa next time."
"Schell's pils was my introduction to the style a few summers ago, and after returning to it, I think I prefer its balance and understated flavors to some of the hoppy pilsners floating around."
"Drinkablity - Very drinkable. I've done many sessions with this beer over the years, and it's always one of my favorite Schell's beers."
"The August Schell line is really impressing me more, their beers got me into better beer back in the mid 80s."
"Drinkability is high. The flavor profile isn't quite there for me, and niether is the look. It's alright, but definitely not my favorite."
"Clear golden yellow with a nice two finger head and good lacing. Aroma is grainy and sweet, light floral hops. Flavor is a bit sweet for a pilsner, lots of grainy malts, slightly floral with hints of honey and herbal hops. Bitterness is there but nothing crazy. Pretty well balanced actually. Crisp and refreshing, lots of carbonation. A good take on a pilsner and another solid offering from Schell's."
"A pleasant, lighter beer. Good for a hot day and even as a stepping stone beer. Quite nice all around."
"D: Allowing it to settle for a minute changed my perception and this is definitely a session beer I can drink"
"D: Take the metallic aftertaste away, and this is a SOLID Pils. I understand the reasons there could be a metallic aftertaste, but, this is too much. Drank half, poured half."
"D= High. This is my new fav from this brewery. Great beer"
"Taste: Maltiness up front followed by bitterness. It's a really overlooked style and I wasn't expecting much from this one, but it ended up being a really solid beer."
"Very drinkable, but so are most Pils. I most likely won't be seeking this out again, but it's still an average beer."
"Overal: This beer is okay and I might buy it again in the summertime, maybe this isn't quite my style?"
"Overall, this is one solid Pilsner. It is very easy to drink! I think Schells hit the prime spot here! I definitely would recommend this!"
"HV"
"Could dry a few on nice hot day!"
"The taste is bread, toasted grain, pine, lemon, and a hint of nuts. It has a firm malty body with enough sweetness and character to carry the definite hoppy flavour and bitterness to it. It is lively, engaging, with nice complexity, zesty, crisp, and highly enjoyable overall."
"Pours slightly hazed, amber yellow color, decent sized white foam. The head shrinks quickly down to a floating film, leaves thin string line of lace. Slightly grainy smell, mild hops. The flavour is actually quite nice. Toasted malt character, slightly sweet, and a bit of spice in the finish. The body is full (for the style), good carbonation level. A pretty good beer all around, well made with no faults. This is the taste I am looking for in a pilsner."
"D: It is a fine session beer for this style. It has low ABV, is light bodied and the flavors are well balanced. However, it is not a remarkable beer."
"Best Pils I've had yet."
"Appearance is crystal-clear straw yellow with a tight white head. Good lacing. Aroma is that familiar biscuit and cereal grain pils malt with lots of pretty noble hops. Flavor much the same with medium hop bitterness. Finish is a bit dry for the style, almost tastes a bit over-attenuated, but very crisp and refreshing. An excellent example of a pilsener. Be sure to enjoy on a hot summer day in mass quantities."
"Mouthfeel was medium density. Somewhat zesty in the mouth."
"Drinkability: Quite good, especially on a hot summer day (which it is here in Chi-town). This beer used to be a bit hoppier - thus perhaps finishing a bit drier - as I try and remember it from over a decade ago, but I gotta hand to the folks in New Ulm: this is still a nicely made, German pilsener. It tastes more of a Bavarian-style pils (tending sweet) versus a Lower Saxony-kind of pils (tending dry). Whatever, this is nice stuff."
"Drinkability is decent on this beer. Smooth, balanced, and refreshing. I doubt I will seek this beer out, but I wouldn't opt for water if this was offered either. Worth a try."
"D- I remembered this being better than it is. The finish seems really off, and there isn't quite as much hop presence as I was expecting."
"Mouthfeel: I thought this had good carbonation, with an excellent balance for a someone like my folks who drink the BMC stuff. Not as crisp of a finish as I'd like for a pils, but still very drinkable."
"Tasted on 3/31/08."
"Drinkability: A bit light, an easy drinking beer. Sessionable, yes, but I tend to like my session beers around 5% ABV or less (at least when I am planning on consuming 6 or more or drinking all day). Still this is a good beer, that if the price were right ($6 or less) I would pick up again. Good for BMC drinker."
"Extremely drinkable and refreshing. An affordable beer that should be given a try."
"For a good step up from macros this beer hits the spot. Only $6.99 a six (or $5.99 if you find it on sale) it is an inexpensive stepping stone beer. A well made pilsner that won't scare people away."
"D - I don't care for this one. This is nothing at all like the style should be, and the lemonade flavors are off putting for me. Way to sour and tart for sessioning. This is more like a shitty wheat beer than a German Pils."
"D: A decent sessioner, this pils is a pleasant drink from Schell's."
"D= very. Try it if you can."
"Drinkability: Schell well well, what have we here? A light (even for a) pilsner, that's what."
"This pours a ""regular"" beer color. Yellow with a nice medium head. The smell is hoppy and a hair grainy. The taste is the winner here. This reminds me of the beer I had in northern Germany. Excellent blend of hops, lemon and malt. Very enjoyable. The joy lasts to the last sip. Good beer."
"Poured an attractive yellow/golden color with a nice white head that dissipated fairly quickly. Aroma is not real strong, with a hint of hops. Taste of hops; smooth, clean and crisp. Lacing on glass is nice. I thought this was a very enjoyable quencher and the drinkability of this one is very high. I enjoyed"
"it is hard to get too excited about most pilsners but this one is really quite good. attractive blonde in the glass, but more complex taste and aroma than might be expected from the appearance. light floral hop notes in the nose and on the palate, where it is mixed with a nice roasted malt top note. not much of a head. very drinkable with pleasant mouthfeel. i'd buy more of this."
"Nothing at all wrong with it, I only wish it was just a touch less sweet."
"session breer."
"Mouthfeel is well-carbonated and more syrupy than expected. Had it been thinner, this could've been a terrible experience. As it is, it's simply a run-of-the-mill offering. There are many better German pilsners out there, but there are some enjoyable characteristics in the flavor and especially the mouthfeel that helped avoid total disaster."
"Schell Pilsner was a pale golden color and a little hazy. The white head was medium in size with good retention and left some lacing behind. The aroma was light malt with a little citrus. The taste was malt upfront followed by a nice hop flavor and bitterness. The finish was dry with some hops and bitterness lingering. It was medium-light in body with good carbonation. Drinkability was good. It's a crisp and refreshing lager that I enjoy on occasion."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a 1/4"" white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has an all malt aroma that boasts of pale and Munich malts . The taste is decent. It has a dry pale malt flavor with some Munich in there as well. It has a bitter hop bite that really turns me off. It has a nice malty taste, but the finish is unfavorable. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a decent pilsner, but not my favorite for sure."
"D - A pretty nice pilsner representation. Nothing special but it makes a descent session brew."
"Overall: Good example of a German pils, but nothing exceptional. If you're in the mood for a pils and this is available, I'd recommend it, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."
"Poured into a pilsner a light straw yellow with a large blooming bone white head that held great retention, nice and spritzey looking.Very grainy aromas like wet grain and mineral at first unappetizing but it grew on me after a bit.Quite dry and toasty malt tilted flavors quite grainy lightly sweet doughy finish with a decent herbal smack of hops in the finish.Somewhat basic but with a little character the herbal finish was its saving grace in my opinion."
"Drinkability: Admittedly, the light lagers are not my normal cup of tea, I lean towards very malty beers. Hwoever, this is great. Refreshing enough for a hot summer's day, yet complex enough to have year round. Big fan. I continue to be impressed by this brewery."
"D: I was quite impressed by this beer as it was not like I expected. I've had this beer before, but now I can say I truly took the time to appreciate this beer. I can't give this one fives yet because I need to have some more pilsners, this one turned me onto them again and I'm glad. I'd try this again in the future and share it with some friends next time."
"overall this is a very enjoyable pils that is very refreshing"
"D: Not exactly a muscular pilsner like Prima Pils, but the soft malt flavor is absolutely delicious."
"Very crisp mouthfeel and refreshing, medium-bodied with good carbonation. Good local example of a pils, that I'd more than likely try again."
"Overall Impression: Easy drinking Pilsner. Big thanks to Chad for bringing some Schell beers back from Minnesota for us!"
"The aroma is of the typical pilsner/europe lager. A mild cabbagy smell, with the more predominant mettalic smell. To me, this tasted alot like a Pilsner Urquell. Quite fizzy on the tongue, with a dry bitter taste and finishes very chalky. Maintains a slight citrus tang on the way down. The aftertaste lasts forever."
"This beer started out like a traditional BMC type beer, but actually ended on a better note. Poured to a light golden color with little carbonation, head or lacing. Aroma was very grainy and not real pleasant. Surprisingly, the taste was somewhat fruit and floral, with a good lingering after-taste. While not a great beer, this would make a good session beer."
"Overall a very nice session beer - tasty and drinkable. Thanks to bulldogsturge."
"D - This is a lot better than I thought it would be. One of my new favorites from Schell."
"Measured pour into a antique 7 oz pilsener glass produces a white, fairly rocky head of medium duration. Lacing is minimal. Color is a pale golden/straw, and clear to brilliant. Nose is straightforward, dominated by pale and pilsener malts, dry, and fairly non-expressive. Dry and crisp from the outset, with a mildly fruity middle and a bitter/astringent finish. Malty yet anything but sweet, as theres a great balance here thanks to ample hop bitterness. Not sour, but has notes of a sour fruit (rhubarb) in addition to very minor hints of green apple or crap apple. Mouthfeel is rather full but not heavy, and it is certainly not full-bodied but moderate. Drinks lighter than 5.5%, seems about 4.5%, so it might be worth keeping in mind while sessioning this - it's quite sessionable! I know that the recipe was tweaked about a year back, supposedly to yield a drier rendition of a Pils, and in this respect I think theyve succeeded without sacrificing any of the brews original character or drinkability. Some honey notes in the aromatics, and some great malt character overall, along with a notable degree of lingering bitterness. Sampled from a fresh bottle, just over a month old."
"Pours a four finger, chunky white head that fades to a thin layer leaving a little lace. Ugly pale amber color. Light carbonation and light-medium bodied. Slight malt and hop nose. Starts balanced maybe a little hoppiness, middle sweetness, clean finish. $1.29 for a 12oz bottle from John's Grocery Iowa City, IA."
"It's a very tasty American pils, good example."
"Drinks okay, but nothing to get excited about to be sure"
"PH"
"Golden, slightly cloudy appearance. A bit of a grainy smell, but not bad. It has a pilsner-y sweet flavor that finishes well with a balanced, hoppy finish. Not a weak bodied beer like american domestics, the mouthfeel is actually a bit tangy. This is a solid pilsner, but nothing to write home about, a good session beer."
"The body is light with good carbonation. A drier finish would be nice. Overall a nice 6 to pick up. Just need a marker to spell shell right."
"Decent stab at a pilsner. Yellow body with white head, could use a little better retention. Grainy, but clean smell, lacks personality or depth. Slightly fruity with a sweet malt taste. Slight off-flavor, maybe from adjunct or age. Small bite at the end, with a little lingering bitterness. At least the conbonation feels right. Easy drinking and can wash down food."
"As another reviewer noted, the descriptive copy on Schell's bottles could use some work- quite weak."
"Floaties aside, I was really surprised by this beer. Its extremely solid and particularly well done. The fruit elements made this one really enjoyable and the mouth feel was particularly solid making this beer an easily affordable complete package."
"Starting a new review after admiring and going back to this fine beer many times in the past few years. The body may be hazy when chilled, but I don't believe that detracts too much from the overall experience. What I admire most about this beer is balance. Sure, it is a German Pilsener, a style not known for huge hops, but this beer has a hop profile well defined, impressive, and very complementary to the slightly sweet malt. A little fruity tasting, but crisp, refreshing, and one of the best bottled beers in Minnesota. My favorite of the style, hands down."
"Da fine pilsner, something that would be great in the summer, either by the pool or after yard work. Very easy to drink and enjoy."
"Mouthfeel is mid-viscosity, syrupy, and carbonated."
"Editing: Well, I waited until a warm autumn day and sampled a bottle at the Schell's Brewery. It was damn near perfect. I'm guessing that the beer they serve there is at the perfect maturation stage ane well cared for - the sterling hops were just amazingly fresh, and the malt was crisp with a light sweet distinct graininess. I could have sipped this beer all day."
"This pilsner pours a light golden to dark straw color with a minimal amount of foam. I think I can detect a faint flowery, hoppy aroma. The sweet malt flavor is up front with a sort of bubble gum-fruity middle and a light bitterness in the finish. I first tried this beer about a dozen years ago and I remember it as a spicier (hoppy) pilsner. This is still a decent pilsner, but its doesn't seem as magical as I remmeber it being. Perhaps my palate has changed, but maybe the beer has changed, too. It's still a pretty refreshing pilsner and worth trying, but as a German pilsner it comes up a bit short."
"Pale, hazy color of golden ice clouds carrying a snow-white head which clings to the glass as it slowly recedes (leaving a web-like lace long after the entire beer is gone). Bready, floral aroma. Mouthfeel is substantial, and helps define the sharp, tangy bite; hoppy and crisp like the springy pep of fresh salad greens. Sort of a gluey finish to an otherwise grand experience."
"Poors a beatiful golden color in the glass. A tad of a head which leaves nice sticky lacing down the inside of the glass. Sweet malty aroma with a bit of grain also present. Taste is slightly sweet with a little hoppiness present as well. Nicely carbonated. This is a very drinkable beer. In my humble opinion, one of the best American Pilsners on the market."
"A bit overcarbonated, but adds to the summery niche this beer should fill."
"This is another example of why Schell is possibly one of the best major brewers going today. Another style, done the right way. Poured out to a slightly cloudy golden color with medium low carbonation. Nice head, came down to about 1/8 of an inch. No lacing noted in the glass. Odors of citrus and hops are well balanced. Taste is direct and straightforward. Hops, malt, some citrus acidity, and a good smooth bitterness. Finished crisp with some minor malt aftertaste. High drinkability. If this was readily available, i'd keep some on hand. Recommended."
"Pours a cloudy pale straw color with no head. Last time I checked pilsners weren't supposed to be cloudy. I have a felling this might foreshadow whats to come. The aroma is exacly like that of every other Schell product. Thin and vaguely sweet. The taste is as thin as the smell. It is much too sweet for a pilsner. The mouthfeel lacks any sort of crispness. Overall, beer is a big disappointment. For a brewery that prides itself on its German heritage, I would think that making a quality pilsner would be a must. I guess not."
"D- This is a very nice session beer. It has lots of good qualities but the slight fruitiness in the finish is a little different. Good hops in this Pils."
"Reviewing this simultaneously with Lakefront's Klisch Pilsner. This is a perfectly average beer. It looks, smells, and tastes exactly like stereotypical beer. Pale gold, malty, smooth, refreshing, utterly lacking any distinguishing characteristics. Klisch is much better. Thanks to sopor for sending me a couple bottles of this."
"This beer is hazy gold with lots of carbonation and a medium-sized, white, foamy, most-diminishing head. The smell is that of citrus, malts, butter, grass and grain. The taste is more malty than expected, but still nicely balanced. Theres a nice mild initial bitterness that gives way to the malt sweetness before switching back to a dry bitterness on the finish. It has a thin-medium body, watery texture, and lively carbonation. This one was very nicely done. Nothing spectacular here, but a good well-rounded pilsner."
"A unique beer that's certainly worth a try. Moderate body and carbonation make for a great session beer, too."
"A friend happened to bring over a sampler pack of Schell. I made the mistake of trying this beer. It pours a swill gold color and has a thin head. It had weird aromas that one might expect from a adjunct lager. That sickly corn smell. I did not expect that from a so-called German Pilsener. The flavor was even worse IMHO... It reminds me more of a can of beast that a glass of Pilsener."
"Very fine pilsner, super easy to enjoy. A big thanks to Tastytaste for the beer to help celebrate my 22nd b-day and 1 year anniversary on Beeradvocate!"
"Mouthfeel is light and clean, nice rounded body, no off-flavors. Above-average for the style, a very good pils. Thanks to TastyTaste for inroducing me to this one."
"Drinkability and Overall: While not my favorite, this is an excellent example of a pilsener. Crisp, refreshing and smooth. The drinkability would be better, but the aftertaste is hurting it a little. I had this a long time ago on my road to ""better beer," and I think I appreciate it much more now. Got 5 more Schell beers to try, and I hope they're all as nice as this."
"Drinkability is pretty good on this beer."
"Drinkability and overall: Nicely done. This is my favorite offering from Schell so far. They must use this recipe for some of their other styles. Their other styles have hints of this taste in it, I just couldn't put my finger on it. I'd recommend trying this one."
"All in all, not a bad pils (it's not my favorite style), but it IS quite drinkable, which is always a plus. I'd drink it again, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."
"Thanks again to FMonk for the chance to try this Minnesota Pilsner!"
"I was surprised to find out I hadn't rated this...quality Pilsner...slightly better than average...certainly not in the same league as Prima-Pils...and I'd take New Glarus edel-Pils over this but it is a nice beer none-the-less....good summer beer.."
"Schell Pilsner is pretty good beer all things considered. It has more flavor and more personality than many domestic versions and that makes it okay in my book. I probably won't seek it out again, but this bottle was enjoyable."
"Yellow pour with dishsoap head that sizzles out. Interesting bubbles. Some clean malt hops and faint citrus so you could get through it. Unusual afterburn, but at least it did not taste like dishsoap. Reasonable floral honey smell. One to try for pils fans. Cheers to feloniousmonk for the sample."
"note: warms well. I suggest drinking this barely cool."
"I had this draft at the brewery last year, but this bottle leaves a better impression on me. Thin, transitory head. Darker than style, almost coppery. The malt is even a little toasty. There's a firm hop bitterness, just a little bit peppery. A very fine American pilsener. Can be slammed as a lawnmower beer or sipped slowly to enjoy its complexity. Previously named ""Schell Pils."""
"Slightly hazy orange body, smallish white head topping it off. Smell is primarily citrusy, sweet. Highly carbonated, citrus also hits the tounge first. Sweet malt, well balanced. Very refreshing drink. A good pils, also different than the pilsners ive had lately. I would recommend it."
"The prototypical pilsner liquid gold color on the pour with a behemothic size white head that is bubbly in texture and after decomposition a sealing curtain of lace is formed. Nose is the archetypal crisp, clean and malt dominated with a sweet front laden with malt and a light to moderate top. The quintessential pilsner finish that is brisk in its acidity, the hops apropos to the style, pleasingly dry aftertaste, and a perfect partner to the Fire Brick Lager on a hot and sunny afternoon in the desert."
"This beer is just your typical pilsener. Nothing special about it but it is quite nice in it's own right. Buttery diacetyl hits the tastebuds first. Nice easy going mixture of hops and grains provide a smoothness in the beer. Unfortunately, it wasn't too crisp, likely from the lack of carbonation. A slightly above average pilsener."
"Pours crystal clear with a golden tint and lots of bubbling action racing towards a small white head. The aroma consists of a light grain and a crisp hop note smell pretty nice. The taste is quite faint with an earthy grain and light hopping taper into a lightly sweetened musty taste. This beer is quite crisp coming mostly from the carbonation and finishes quietly sweet. In this Texas heat, this drink went down very nicely! Cheers!"
"Cheers to Budgood1 for the sample."
"Full bodied pilsner. Smooth taste with just a hint of hops and fruit. Cloudiness in glass shows its character. This is a pilsner which is similar in style to a weiss. A very delightful blend of hops and wheat. Quick fading head. Overall, a very pleasing beer."
"Pours a very nice golden yellow with a fair amount of head. Aroma is very nicely balanced with enough malt to back up the strong (for a pilsner) hops. More flavor than most pilsners, but very well balanced. I was really surprised at how good this beer is."
"For quite some time, this has been the Minnesota standard for local pilseners, and that reputation is warranted. A terrific lager, indeed."
"Thanks feloniousmonk of the bottle!"
"A nice golden color with a thin, ever clinging head, some slight carbonation is present. Aroma of wheat and somewhat of clean and grassy, quite pleasant. An initial onslaught of wheat and a bit grainy taste with an end of nice hops, which seem to be noticed in the background throughout. A smooth and clean taste and mouthfeel throughout, high on the drinkability scale. Considered a staple, a 4 Season Beer, awesome pilsner."
"Pours out with next to no head. Color is bright golden. Slight aroma of grains. This is a solid pilsner. Refreshing and quite the thirst quencher. There is actually a nice, slight bitterness to it that suggest the hops are in there. This would be a good BBQ or pizza quaffer."
"As others have said, this is an excellent American Pils.  But it is not my favorite style, and the Czech pils are much better.  It poured a clear dark golden with little to no head.  The aroma was very nicely hopped with a slight malt presence.  The flavor was nicely hopped as well, and clean.  The mouthfeel was above average, nothing great, but not bad either.  I had to give it high drinkability.  Refreshing and light."
"A quick drinking american pils with rewards for those who stop to think."
"Pilseners are not my favorite style but I couldn't find much wrong with this. This was much richer than I thought a Pils could be. Nice balance of hops and malt, and it was tangy enough to hold my interest much longer than a typical Pils. Not bad at all."
"This beer poured a light golden color and formed a nice bubbly white head that formed a small amount of lace when it subsided.  It had a medium amount of carbonation going on.  The aroma was of hops, grain and a hint of lemon.  The flavor was of hops, some bread aspects and a little citrus.  The finish had a slightly doughy aspect to it brought on by the grain and it was a touch astrigent."
"TASTEE. Naturally krausend for a smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Full of rounded hop flavors and aromas with a perfect malt sweetness underneath. Very light and crisp."
"Bright and clear gold-yellow, very little head to speak of -- mostly rim clinging bubbles and skim in the middle of the Pilsner glass.  Barest hint of a hoppy aroma.  Better than expected malt flavors, a ""catch"" of sweetness mid tongue.  Hops are noticed later as a definite slight bittering in the back of the mouth, especially after a few sips.  Not super crisp as some of the style are, but a good brew and very refreshing."
"lovely golden slightly hazy color that leaves a healthy head which soon dissapates but sticks and stays the whole way down the glass. a moderate grainy aroma with muted hops... there is a lot of malt body to this pilsener with a nicely balanced slightly metallic hop finish.  to me it is highly drinkable and enjoyable. it certainly blurs the line between lager and pils in a way i haven't experienced yet."
"This is such a good beer. Starting from the wonderful, almost flowery aroma, nice and foamy head (that does decrease too quickly) and dark gold, yet crystal clear color. I really like the balance of dryness and malt smoothness in the flavor, and that it's there from front to back, then leaving a gradually fading dry finish. The mouthfeel may be too much for some, I describe it as a rich beer, but its of no bother to me. A good beer for virtually anytime, as well as a nice beer to start novices into the world of interesting beers."
"Notes: This beer is shooting for the old world American pilsner style, if you have wondered what beer tasted like before Prohibition this gives and excellent glance at what the style might have been. A great beer to have around all year long. Clean and balanced, just the way it should be."
"Very robust for a pilsner, almost like a pale ale.  Moderate hops with lots of body, almost chewy."
