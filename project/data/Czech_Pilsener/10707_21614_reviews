"Flavor has a touch of bitterness and a light ""grain"" finish. Forgettable but not offensive. Pairs well with popcorn."
""
"Like if a pilsner and a czech lager had a baby. I like them both, but I don't like their baby."
""
""
"This was a surprisingly good beer for the price I paid. I had a good head was very drinkable. I will now have to try out more of the TJ's beers."

"used this one for cooking beer cheese soup, decided I'd pour it in a glass and give it a try to make sure it was worthy to cook with. appearance was great with a nice fluffy 3/4 inch white head, golden in color with lots of bubbles, taste is clean and refreshing, not to sweet like a lot of lagers has a slightly dry after tastes, I'd buy this again if I were ever in the mood for a pilsner."

"O: TJ's Bohemian Lager is a really enjoyable beer and throws serious doubt into my plans to start homebrewing lagers when this can be purchased at 5.99 a sixer."

"For the taste I get the same biscuit and malt characters up front along with the butter but there is a more vibrant clean, crisp hop finale that gives it a new lease on life."

"O: Nothing to write home about. Strictly average. Still, for 6 bucks a sixer you can do worse."

"Good enough."

"You can see what style Budweiser is trying to emulate in a beer like this. Clean, light , golden yellow with a great head. Quaffable but not a lot of complex flavors. Nice, pleasant and a beer that I would drink again but would not go out of my way to stock up the fridge."

"The powers-that-be at beeradvocate.com might do well to reconsider how they have classified this beer. I'd say that it is a Munich Helles Lager, not a Czech Pilsener. One can easily be misled by the words ""crisp"" and ""refreshing," which appear prominently on the bottle, and which are typically the differentia specifica of Pilseners. I wouldn't use either of these words to characterize JB's Bohemian Lager. That said, I'd gladly drink another bottle. This beer was too sweet, but tasty nonetheless."

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a light to medium golden amber with a half finger white head with decent retention and lacing. Very light aroma of biscuit malt and slightly spicy, grassy hops. Flavor is mild, slightly sweet biscuit malt and very light grassy hops with hints of the background crackery malt in the finish. Light bodied with nice carbonation. A very light version of a pilsner lager with all the flavors dialed down. Pleasant and actually quite nice with lunch, but pretty much what you'd expect for a decently made cheap domestic German lager style. Nice for the price but approaching mass market beers in tameness."

"O: There is nothing ""wrong"" with this beer, give it to an unassuming, not-picky beer drinking on a summer evening and they won't even pause to think twice, however as far as a craft pilsener goes it doesn't taste like anything. Again, no off flavors stand out (other than the purposely added skunk), but there is just nothing here."
""
"Taste is not half bad, mostly grainy with a little biscuit. Light hopping is there, but only if you look hard for it. Malts are a little sweet, this one really drinks more like a helles lager as opposed to a Czech pilsner. Mouthfeel is average for the style and goes down super easy. For the price this is pretty hard to beat, cheaper than a sixer of Bud - yes please, all day."
"Kind of a generic taste may slightly resemble a Czech Pilsner. Sort of a generic version. Maybe a good one to introduce your Bud Light buddies to something different."
"notes: like the Josephs Brau Vienna this is a style perfect beer without flaws that is very easy to drink. At the price this could become a Summer staple."

"color is like goldenrod wit ha large bubbly head. the nose is sweet with distinct honey notes. very enticing. the taste begins with the same honey-like malt then a slight grassy and citrus rind hop edge with a semi-dry finish. smooth and pleasant, perhaps a bit sweet. i think very nice for the style, except again perhaps too tame on hop presence to balance sweetness."

"O: It's not a good beer, but it IS at least very drinkable, basically because it's beer-flavored carbonated water. A decent enough lawnmower beer, I suppose - given its price, it could be an adequate BMC substitute for those who have a Trader Joe's near them. Personally, I wouldn't care if I never had this again."
"O: Not really anything special but certainly a decent beer considering the very reasonable price. Easy to drink and sessionable but not one that I am likely to buy again."
"I bought this six-pack expecting a cheap lager, but I was pleasantly surprised with its flavor and depth. It certainly makes a decent first impression, with a slightly hazy, bright golden yellow color and a thin but persistent eggshell-white head. The aroma is subtle but pleasant, with a characteristic musty noble hope character over a light, toasted bready sweetness. The flavor is likewise muted but mostly enjoyable, with a duller but still present hop profile and a more biscuity malt characteristic. The texture is somehow both a bit watery/thin and also too resinous. Overall, though, although a bit dull, this beer is reasonably satisfying and drinkable."
"O: This beer is easy to drink but seems to have an off taste compared to others in the style."

"Overall: this one is easy to drink. The flavor jumps around a little but still fairly flavorful for a czech pilsener."
"Poured this Czech Pilsener from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. It poured a hazy golden color, produced a thin white head, poor retention and only small amounts of lacing left behind. The aroma was nice full of biscuit and malted grain. Medium in body, this Pilsener has a base of biscuit malted grain, some herbal notes and it finishes dry. Overall, it is an average Czech Pils but nothing makes it stand out. Prost!"
""
""
"Mouthfeel is medium, with a bit of wateriness around the edges. Carbonation is present, but beer comes across as feeling creamy due to it, rather than crisp, as I would normally want a Czech pilsner to be. Finish is semi-dry, as could be expected due to the apparent malt domination of this pilsner."
"Pours a slightly hazy light orange with a 1 inch foamy bone colored head that settles to a small cap. Broken rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt/grain, slight honey, and a grape juice fruity aroma. Taste is of malt/grain, slight corn, and the fruity flavor. There is a very mild bitterness that quickly fades after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer. Nothing too offensive but not worth getting again."
""
""
"O: I think this is a good solid example of the style. Not the best, not the worst. Taste and aroma get more complex as the beer approaches room temperature. Sessionable to be sure."

"Slight warm tone to the basic lager taste. It does have a nice hint of hops that gives a slight zing to the aftertaste. Color is a touch more to the amber than straight golden, as with the flavor. Carbonation is a little coarse where a real Pilsener would be creamier. Not too much going on but there is nothing wrong with this beer. The touch of hops redeems it a little after each sip."
"One-dimensional, over-malted, and uninteresting."
"Three fingers of head that dwindles kinda quickly. Some bits of lace here and there. Hints of grassy hops in the nose, sugary euro pale maltiness. Flavor is not really what I would call a Czech pilsener, but this beer is quite a bit better than I imagined it would be. A nice refreshing beer with a bit of a dry finish. Trader Joe's brews are well worth the 5.30 price."
"Clear deep gold with a short, bright white cap that faded to a collar but really stuck around afte that. Clumpy, spotty lacing. Smells like cooked corn with a little malt thrown in, maybe a little overdone popcorn. Low bitterness wit more cooked corn, popcorn, and slight grassiness. Low to medium bodied with lowish carbonation, on the dry side wit a bit of spiciness in the finish. I'm not impressed by my first Trader Joe's beer, mainly due to the corn character running through it."
"* I love Trader Joes as a rule and recommend checking them out.*"
"I'm glad I didn't have to buy an entire 6-pack in order to try this beer."
"I was hoping that this would be a rip-off of something like Pilsner Urquell, but instead it looks Trader Joe's tried to rip-off the taste of Michelob Ultra. That's not good."
"Morey's Bottom Line: Not the worst Pils that I've had, but the lack of crispness coupled with the overdone sweetness makes this not worth spending money on. I'd drink it again, but it would have to be given to me (and this was)."
"pours golden yellow with quick dissipating white head. Pretty much no smell on this one. Not too sweet and a hint of some maltiness. A strong apple flavor that almost gives it a apple juice flavor. Light and drinkable . overall an ok beer but I probably wouldn't buy it again."
"T: Again, not much going on here. The taste is slightly sweet upfront with grains and some pale malts. A slight bit of breadiness on the finish, but really not much at all. Watery mouthfeel."
"Overall: A pretty tasty version of a pilsener that tastes like a light version of a hefeweizen."
"Trader Joe's beer is surprisingly good, all things considered. Bohemian Lager, while not one of their best, isn't a bad choice for warm weather cookouts. Beats the hell out of what you're likely to see in the vast majority of backyards this summer."
"golden yellow with a quick one finger head that fades pretty quickly to a couple of clumps on the surface. Dont smell much, some bitter from the hops, light malt smell. Tastes dry bitter, corn and some sweet flavors roll around. Nice hop zing that sits around on the back of my toungue and roof of my mouth. Mouthfeel is full with good carbonation that fades in the mouth but picks back up in my stomach. Its ok. Wont be chomping at the bit to get another sixer but its drinkable. At the same price as any other big american beer label it is a value for the taste."
"D: Metallic finish and 'clumps' make it a ""no"" for me."
"Not a bad beer at all. I wouldn't mind drinking more of these. This is pretty reasonably priced too."
"12 oz. bottle with a batch code on the back, contract-brewed by Gordon Biersch with pilsner malt, lager yeast and 18 IBUs. Pours light amber, with moderate carbonation and a half-inch off-white head that deposits a few threads of lacing. Floral hops and light malt (or perhaps corn) in the nose blend with traces of sulfur and diacetyl. Tastes toasted and biscuity, soft, sweet (corn?), with floral/spicy hops, mild bitterness, and some lagery yeast notes on top of a fairly carbonated, light body that has a medium finish. Not really a pilsner, but keep in mind the label doesn't declare it to be one. It does, however, call it Bohemian, but I feel this tastes less Czech and more like an American lager, perhaps even a pre-Prohibition one. A good amount of brews back then were moderately hopped, labeled Bohemian, and the use of corn would not have been out of place at all. So let's go with that - this is a good example of a pre-Prohibition American lager."
"overall it was not really a repeatable beer at all."
"Drinkability - Overall a decent beer. Not great, but it beets most other beers I can purchase for $5.99 / sixer."
"12 oz bottle. Poured a golden yellow with a thin, short lived head. Lively carbonation. Aroma of herbal hops and biscuit malt. Light to medium body. Flavor of mild herbal hops balanced by biscuit malt with some citrusy notes. Finish is long and slightly bitter. Not bad for the price, but should be much more hops for the style."
"The pour results in a clear pale straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises very light florals. ...That's it. I made sure my nose is still working (whatever fabric softener I use smells nice...), and still nothing much here. Okay. The taste holds notes of flowers, very light honey, watered-down caramel, wheat, and corn. There's a fake-feeling sweetness to everything. The body is light, with a light moderate carbonation and a wet feel. Overall, an okay pils at best, just a bit to sweet and artificial (if that makes sense) for my tastes."
"I didn't understand the negative reviews of this beer until I had it. I usually think of a much brighter, hoppier beer when I think of pilsner but this was really not much different from a mexican beer. The vienna lager, which IS a mexican beer is more interesting. I'll enjoy it with Chinese, etc., but it is not what I'd consider a good pilsner."
"This beer pours with a fairly deep golden color. A very wet and frothy looking head recedes quite fast. Heavy notes of honey and pear in the aroma give way to a hint of peach. Super crisp and clean taste with no hop presence. The honey notes come crawling back for the very end of the finish. Overall, not a bad beer for the price."
"Like a stranger saying 'hi' as you pass eachother on the street, it's pleasant and refreshing but don't expect a long conversation from this one."
"Taste, straight forward, not bad, not adventurous. Prickly carbonation in place of hops, kinda true to style. Just doesn't taste like a whole lot, for better and for worse. This is the purgatory between BMC and craft brew. Hook this up for a friend who is looking to get initiated into something beyond diet beer."
"I enjoyed the beer overall, but would have liked to have seen more hop presence."
"Overall: See drinkability."
"Medium-high carbonation. This is decent. I probably wouldn't buy this again, but considering the price I have no regrets."
"To start: not a great tasting beer. Its very comparable in flavor to Natural Ice, Bud Ice, and other ~6% alcohol cheap beers. However, it costs $3.69 a six pack. In Manhattan. For reference, a six pack of bud light will run you about $7. If I knew about this in college it would have been all I drank. Its good to have laying around for bigger parties and guests who aren't really into craft beer; the trader joes branding makes people think of it being healthy and quirky, but honestly this just isn't a beer you should be drinking for fun."
"Actually pretty drinkable, but like a bit more hop bite in my pils."
"The mouth is pretty good and to style. It is a bit slick without a lot of gassiness. I think this is simple yet well made lager and one that would pair easily with most nonspicy foods."
"One and done son. And it's a pilsner? Damn. Whoever took that picture of the bottle on top of that beige carpet could have just taken a picture of the beige carpet and I'd completely understand."
"This is a fairly average to below average pilsner. It is a bit light on the hops and malt for my taste for the style."
"D: A pretty average effort. But this is considerably better than BMC at the same price."
"Flat mouthfeel. I've been very disappointed by these trader Joe beers."
"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a clear dark gold color with a fizzy white head that doesn't last or leave lacing. Aroma is minerals, toasted malt, and earthy hops. Tastes like that crappy cereal with no sugar on it that your mom bought when you were a kid. Grains, pale malt, vaguely sweet, astringent. Thin bodied, but the astringency kills any refreshment one might have gotten. Not a good beer."
"Nothing outstanding here, but drinkable nonetheless."
"D: Pretty plain pilsner nothing that is a must have. ABV is good and is not a bad session beer.... price is low. Not the best TJ's I've had."
"D: A more or less uninteresting, but still slightly better than average beer. However, the flavors were clean and there were no noticeable flaws to distract from the light flavors."
"Drinkability- Just your average pils. Happy to have tried it though."
"D- overall not a bad lager. really good thirst quencher for these summer nashville evenings. would buy again for the price point"
"Drinkability I have to give it a 4 of 5 because it went down fast and went very well with a pork BBQ meal. I definitely could have picked up another if I didn't have to get back to work."
"Not sure why TJ's & Gordon Biersch label this a Bohemian/Czech Pilsner, it always seemed more in line with a German Pils -- even a Helles."
"D- easy to finish and a good alternative to the american macro lager. at this price, its similar in cost. not one of the better beers from here."
"Drinkability: decent beer. once again, Trader Joes does it again with a quality beer for the price."
"For the price you certainly can't complain, and for the most part all of the Trader Joe's beers are top notch! This one pours a clear, deep-golden body beneath a frothy head of white that holds really well and leaves some very nice 'broken' walls of lace about the glass. The nose is clean and malty/grainy (just slightly toasty), with a hint of sweetness and some lightly spicy and leafy & floral hops sprinkled here and there. The same is pretty much true for the flavor, with the addition of a stiff bitterness to back the firm maltiness. It's well rounded, and very nicely balanced. Overall, I found it remarkably drinkable, and quite enjoyable."
"Poured into a stange glass. A half inch of white foam resulted, with a golden yellow body. There were visible carbonation trails rising rapidly through it, and a feeble skim of foam was left after a few minutes. Slightly skunky noble hop aroma, herbal and grassy but pretty toned down. Some crackery malt flavor, it finishes dry and crisp with a slight hop bite. There was a little corn husk element too, and gassy carbonation. Sort of average, but not bad if it's free or cheap (this single was $1). A nonintellectual cookout brew."
"Overall, I could easily drink this, but the only reason I wouldn't get it again is because there are much better beers available in this category."
"More of a Bavarian Helles than a Pils. Easy to get along with but nothing special by any means."
"D- I'm not too impressed by this beer as a Czech Pilsner, I think there are better examples out there. This might be a nice way to push a BMC drinker into branching out, but the amount of buttery diactetyl in this beer bothers me."
"I don't really go out of my way for Lagers, I'll review them for my own understanding of the style. This is drinkable."
"Drinkability: Meh. A relatively true to style beer, but nothing exceptional. As with most of Trader Joe's beers, this one is solidly in the middle of the road."
"Pours a clear golden color with little head. What little head there was quickly dissipated and there was no lacing. Smells of a clean lager with some stale grass. A sharp sour taste that doesn't get lighter. A crisp mouth feel that again tastes of grass. Though, this is better than there Vienna style lager it is still not worth recommending."
"Drinkability: Yes, folks, this of course isn't the best version of the style, but it was pretty easy for me to drink it, and by the time I came to review it the glass was almost gone. Not bad to try, but nothing I'd seek at out again."
"Ironically, my wife, who does not like Czech pilsners normally (and who prefers mostly better macro lagers and strong Belgian golden ales) likes this. She normally finds my beers too bitter, yet found this fine, whereas I found the bitterness in this beer to be too much and too rough. I know for me, though, that absolute bitterness is not what matters but bitterness relative to the rest of the beer and here the bitterness was all alone with no other flavours, sweetness, etc., to carry it."
"Drinkable? Barely. I'll drink another, and keep alive the hope that maybe the first bottle was old or mistreated, and the rest maybe are better.."
"D> Refreshing, and really easy to drink. And really cheap."
"D - Quite good I think. Very rich, malt-centered brew that remains very drinkable."
"D-I was surprised how decent this one was; more so after reading some o' the other reviews that really bash it. There was nothing major wrong with this beer, even if some of its character may be overly subtle. The pairing with the curry created a contrast that brought out the best in this beer."
"Drinkability: Not bad a good hot day beer especially for the price."
"Least preferred of the 4 styles in my mix-o-six."
"D: Easy drinking here. Nothing objectionable and the ABV is low enough for a session. Recommended."
"A nice light to medium body with some crisp bitterness. Very refreshing and dry. I really enjoyed this, and lagers, as a style, are abysmally ranked on BA compared to other styles. I think this is a damn fine drinker and for the low price of $5 and change...it's damn good and definitly worth the price."
"Goes down easy. So does water. Pretty bad representation of this style."
"Drinkability: A pilsner specifically bred to be tame and docile. What a shame. But considering the price, I suppose you're paying for what you get (not much)."
"Good for hot weather fast drinking."
"More of a Helles lager if you ask me. Very simple, meant more for refreshment than anything else. Far from terrible though...I'll get it again in the summer or whenever I feel like a decent, cheap drinkin' beer."
"Thinnish body with bubbly mouthfeel and average drinkability. Glad I just got a single."
"Nothing special, so I won't buy it again."
"The drinkability of this beer is pretty good, as well. However, just remember, this is much more like an ale than a lager."
"Overall really lacks the bite and hop flavor of a Bohemian Pilsner. Pilsner Urquell it is not, and honestly a bit disappointing. Most of the Trader Joes (Gordon Biersch) beers are damn good for the price."
"While this is by no means a great beer, it's pretty good for a cheap lager. A big cut above the macros and -- in a crappy economy like this -- not a bad thing to keep around as a quencher while watching a game or barbequing. Basically a really good lawnmower beer. And is that really a bad thing? I certainly don't think so."
"($5.49 / 6-pack)"
"Mouthfeel was maybe a bit thin. Smooth in the mouth but rough pils texture in the swallow."
"Drinks very easy & this a nice american take on the style, especially for $5 a sixer!"
"Drinkability- As a Czech Pilsner, not great. But pretty drinkable if you ignore style. One of the better Trader Joe beers. The mouthfeel, taste and aroma really complement each other."
"The hop presense is there, if a bit neutered, but its the moutheel that really lets this brew down. Too watery, despite all the bubbles. The aftertaste is metallic and lifeless. Bitterness shouldn't mean hurting the tongue but this one does. This is about what you pay for and little else. I'll have a Budvar, please."
"bottled 1/05/07"
"Clean golden yellow with a puffy, glass-crawling, cloud-white head. Nose is honeyish malt, light butter, grains, and sea-air-ish hops. Spicy bitterness up front. Mild biscuit malt and honey. A little cardboard for good measure. Moderately strong hop bite; peppery and bitter. Overall, a little too cardboardy, but not bad. Light-bodied, with gentle, but obvious carbonation. For the price, a good beer."
"Pours a clear golden straw hue, with a fizzy two finger head. Low retention and minimal lacing. Pilsener and pale malt nose, with a background noble hop aroma. Pale grain taste and mild sweetness upfront, followed by the signature sharp pilsener character common to the style. Dry aftertaste, a balanced spicy Saaz and floral Hallertau hop flavor with a subdued bitterness. Light in body with high carbonation and crisp mouthfeel from slightly tannic malt and drying hops. Finishes husky and dry with moderate german hop flavor lingering. A solid Czech Pils with good drinkability and respectable depth of flavor."
"Drinkability: Won't knock your socks off, but for the affordable price, try it."
"This seems like it would be a very good food beer, especially with spicier foods. While not a superlative beer, for the price I would absolutely buy this again, especially if planning an Indian or Mexican meal."
"If this were really cheap, maybe there could be some justification, but I personally would not choose to drink this again. Too lifeless and flavorless. Blah."
"A strong and clear pilsner yellow. Very par but good with good bubbling to make for lack of lacing. Plenty of baseball field smells liek dirt and fresh cut grass, The grass feel doesn't lose steam after each sip. but then some lagery crystal malts hit the old tongue stickler. I was surprised by the slight nuances of special flavor compared to other pilsners I've had. Very clean lokk and refreshing taste at the end of the day."
"After a wave of tough reviewing, amazingly this trader joe's offering breaks the bad streak. It's nothing that's going to get the crowd buzzing, or even make you go WOW. This is what it is...a crisp, refreshing, light, don't think about just enjoy it type of brew. Simple and drinkable."
"Flavor starts with hay, weeds, and light ditch flowers. A nice walk through a field in the middle of summer. But then there comes this seltzer water and slight metal in the middle, just about ruining everything, but it's saved at the very end by a nice light kiss of pilsner hops."
"Smell is pretty mild compared to Budvar or Urquell but some saaz hop aroma is noticable along with a slightly malty base. Light mouthfeel with very light carbonation, taste is fairly typical of this style but missing some of the kick of true Czech flavor, a bit weak in both malt and hop flavor. Even though there are better alternative this one rates high on drinkabilty and the price is awesome at $4.99 6pack. I always pick up a 6 pack when I go the TJ's, a good session brew."
"Taste is clean, crisp and grainy. Neutral flavors like grains, wheat and oats. Mini imported hop snap on the finish. Nice drinkability level with this Pilsner. I drank this beer rather quickly. Very reasonable price for this beer as well."
"D- Pretty pedestrian for a Czech Pils. Not half bad, you get what you pay for @ $5.29 a six-pack. If I was shopping at Trader Joe's I'd get it again ... but I would not go to TJ just for this beer."
"Didn't really care for this brew. Something was just ""off"". Poured out to a decent yellow golden color with a short lived foamy head. Minor notes of lace with medium carbonation. Aroma was very odd, like roasted grain and kitchen cleaner. Flavor was unfortunately along the same lines; grain, weak malt and hops, with a watery overtone was the general feeling I got from this brew. Minor complexity and major disappointment. Mouthfeel was mild, almost to the point of weak. I don't think I'd have this again, as it was not indiciative of the style or any good beer I know."
"Poured form a 12oz bottle into a pilsner flute, good clear golden color  typical of a Czech-style pilsner. Rocky white head that dissipated a bit too fast. Nose is grainy, dominated by malts but some delicate hop banana-like notes. Taste is decent, of good sourdough, but week. Gives the mouth a metallic feel and is slightly parching. Nonetheless, good value and an option for mass consumption by an audience accustomed to bottom-fermenters."
"This is a pretty bland offering , its not horrible by anymeans ,but I cant see me drinking this again."
"Mouthfeel is nice, highly drinkable average, cheap craft beer."
"Pours a full gold color. This beer is brilliantly clear and has a thin pale head. The aroma is a mix of clean grain and spicy, perhaps herbal hops. I get notes grass, and sweet malt. The beer is fairly dry up front, it then moves to a surprisingly bracing bitterness, but then finishes with a less than inspiring note that is thin and somewhat reminiscent of a cheap lager. Overall this beer just does not have enough going on. It is clean and crisp, but is lacking any depth of flavor."
"The taste of butter hits you like a sledge. A light, sweet brew that felt like a buttery chardonnay, coating my mouth like I had introduced a spoonful of Blue Bonnet. I like a good chardonnay, but not when I'm expecting a beer. I had a hard time getting through this beer and can't see me willingly buying this one again."
"A basic drinkable Pilsner, nothing to go out of your way to get. It exists as an OK beer that doesn't cost too much."
"Overall: A classic 3.0. Satisfactory, I most certainly was not expecting anything to WoW me here, so I am neither disappointed, nor impressed. Moreover, I finished this with a thought so feel. I only picked up the two bottles as part of a mixed six-pack of the four new TJ brews. As ever, it is well priced and as such I think that this would make a really good party or BBQ beer for those guests that you wish to weed off the big three with something differentbut beyond that it has limited appeal I feel."
"Strike 1 for this brew. Not really worth drinking in my opinion. Not completely offensive, but I'd rather spend the extra buck and get a good lager at TJs. Good thing this was just a single."
"Overall, this was a pretty in-offensive beer. On the back label it stated that Bohemian Lager weighed in with 18 IBU's, explaining the serious lack of any bittering. Still, certain elements made this rather appealing. The feel was nice and made it easy to quaff. I really wasn't expecting a whole lot here. At least I wasn't turned off and disappointed."
