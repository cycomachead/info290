"A clear light yellow with a dense, white head with nice retention and lacing, this looks solid. The nose is excellent. Soft, supple and firm hops, lemony and mildly earthy work very well with a clean, honey and bready malt character. Medium light in body with soft malty fullness, this beer is clean, crispy carbonation. Long bready finish with some hop bitterness And excellent lemony hop flavor. Wonderful pillowy palate. Highly recommended."

"O - Not really impressed with this beer. After reading some of the other reviews I feel like I wasn't even drinking the same thing."

"O: Exceptionally tasty and balance pilsner. It has a nice sweet grainy and melony character that balances out the dry, bitter and crisp pilsner character that you normally expect. Drinkability is EXCEPTIONAL as a result. This may be the best czech pilsner I've ever had. Nearly perfect."
""
""
""
"Overall: Above average pilsner. Could be a bit more dry and less sweetness."
""
""
""
""
""

"Far more hoppy in the taste than in the smell. Grainy start but it fades rapidly to the bittering hop. The body is not quite as light as most pilsners. Long, bitter aftertaste. Refreshing."

"O: A solid czech pils with plenty of pilsner taste from the malts. The hops round everything out nicely, and provide some balance. Definitely worth the $4 price tag"

"O - Excellent pilsner - or course since so many of us have BMC to thank for our intro to pilsner style beers, this beer benefits from the poor comparison. Regardless, I'm a big fan of all Berkshire products and I would definitely try this one again especially during the warm summer months."
"Overall, an excellent Pilsner, especially good on a hot day after a bike ride."

"O- overall a solid offering from BBC. On a hot summer day it would be excellent. Very refreshing."
"O: This is a very enjoyable, very easy to drink, refreshing beer which is great for the spring/summer. Almost sessionable (just a touch too high an ABV to be really sessionable for me). Definitely would get this one again."

"Appearance is straw yellow with one finger of a white head. This Czech Pils has an aroma with biscuit, malt, some sugar. A fairly basic smell, but a little better than average. Tipping it back and I taste malts, some hops, quite a bit of bread. The mouthfeel here is great, very low-key and crisp. It has perfect carbonation and finishes very clean. Over the years, I grab a bomber from these guys once in a blue moon. And this was a good choice and it went very well with the spicy food that I had for dinner alongside it."

"Overall – It had a decent flavor and aroma, but was nothing too special. It was rather simple and lacked much complexity. Good for a easier drinking brew, but nothing to really go out of your way for."
"A close to excellent American made Bohemian pilsner. Definitely will pick this up again."

"On cask at 2 Brothers. Pours a murky light orangey brown with very little head. No lacing. Light aroma of grass and honey. Some sweet malty grain aroma. Taste is sweet honey and malts with some grass notes. Crisp with a nice mouthfeel from the cask. Very drinkable. Most Pilseners are a bit boring to me but this one does have some nice complex flavors. Overall, glad I got to try it on cask. May have to try buying a bomber next time i see it."
"Poured on-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a slightly hazed, pale, yellow gold coloring with a thin, dense, foamy white head. Floral nose, both effervescent and slightly tangy, with a touch of buttery sweetness in the background. Flavors are light, with a roastiness that comes in strong around the mid-palate. Buttery and toasted grain backbone with some slight sour notes throughout, all of which overpowers the floral flavors trying to break through. Roasty aftertaste on a light, round body. The carbonation fights to make it crisp, but falls just short. Sparse lacing left along the glass as you drink. The beer has a roasty and smooth finish. Easy enough to drink."

"O: Goes down easy, tasty, not too filling, mild kick, nice representation. The granny apple flavoring took me by surprise, in a pleasant way."

"O/D-This smelled on par with Prima Pils by Victory. However, it fell a bit short for me. Nevertheless, this was a tightly crafted Pils and I would choose it over most from outside of the U.S. It displays the American take on a Pilsener."

"This was decent. It’s wasn’t quite as good as I remembered it being on draft at the brewery a couple of years ago, as this kind of got a little overly loose with the sweetness in spots but things did tighten up a bit the more I worked it and I was overall pleased with it by the end. A worthy pick-up if you see it."

"Nicely done."
"Probably one of the better session beers I've sampled in quite some time."
"Overall, this is by far my favorite pilsner to date and I think its a homerun for its style. Incredibly easy to drink and refreshing and more than a bargain at four dollars a bomber."
"O: Great example of the style. Berkshire's brews have been hit or miss for me. I know I can at least count on their pilsner."
"The beer pours a deep gold hazy color with some very nice lacing left on the glass with a nice ring of head, looks very nice. The smell is hardly there, but I do get the twist of Saaz hops and some nice wheaty bready and certainly grainy malts, a clean overall smell just not very strong. The taste is very well balanced and goes clean over the palate with nice fruity notes and excellent tasty semi sweet malts and fresh grains, and a lemon twist of hops and maybe a little bit of dates at the end, though its abruptly cut off with a dry finish. A classic clean and sudsy feel, pretty nice overall and easy to drink. A nice beer I'd get again, great to have while watching football!"
"D - A very solid representation of the style but rather unremarkable at the same time... Steady and quite average... I would never turn a shot at this one down in the future, but this is far from the top tier of the style in my humble opinion..."
"Nice refreshing beer that goes down nice and smooth. Nice beer after cutting your lawn."
"O - Easily one of the best pilsners I've tried. Incredibly flavorful, as well as dry and refreshing."
"O: a decent pilsner, though nothing amazing"
"Overall: What a beautiful summer beer this is. Walking into a small pizza joint to get out of the heat on a 90+ degree Summer day, and ending up with this in my glass is very satisfying. Great beer, and as perfectly seasonal as food or drink can be."
"Poured a 2.5"" white head. Hazy straw yellow color. The flavor profile is typical BMC all the way too me, just a little stronger and smoother, and I kind of wonder if that isn't more to the credit of it being a fresher and constantly refrigerated version of a pilsner. Yes, I enjoyed it and would repeat, but as far as the build of the beer goes I'd still just call it a little above average."
"Overall, not a dislike for me, but I do prefer other brewers of this style."
"O - Overall I was quite impressed with this offering from Berkshire Brewing Company. Always good.to support local, and with beers like this they make it very easy."
"O: A nice, balanced pilsener with an authentic Czech feel to it. Saaz hops are the subtle star of the show and bready, earthy, milled floor malts add enough substance to keep it a nice hot weather brew. Not a ton of interest on a normal basis, but BBC did a fine job here."
"Pours light amber - darker than a typical pils. White foamy, leaving a full layer. Pils-y smell but mild. Cleab malty flavor. Subtle hop. Some citrus. Clean finish. A little sweet, if anything. A good beer, not great."
"At 5%, I believe this is the lowest it gets from BBC in terms of ABV. This makes it very drinkable and very sessionable, however at this price point ($5/22oz.) it's not likely that I'll enjoy more than one at a time. If this ends up on tap at a local bar, I imagine it'll be one of the better values available. Give it a try if you see it on the shelf"
"This was not a bad brew, but something I juts really didnt like"
"BBC, you make a fine brew. Truly."
"O - Perfect. Summer. Beer. This might just be my new favorite summer seasonal. Its so simple, crisp, clean and refreshing. 22 oz of summer! Another winner from BBC."
"Overall, this is one of Berkshire's finest offerings. Expertly crafted and I have to say, better than Prima Pils in my opinion. Less hops, but better crafted overall. Great beer to sit in a lawnchair and admire your freshly manicured lawn!"
"Though Berkshire specializes in English-style ales, they make great lagers when they put their minds to it."
"Drinks well, could probably be a bit more hoppy for a pilsner. Solid, like most of BBC"
"O - Berkshire has again balanced a beer between strict representation to style and its own siganture. A great seasonal.Seek it out and enjoy"
"bbc czech pills is a nice golden czech style pills,with flaverfull soft malts.This beer is easy to drink and very refreshing.The mouthfull is probally its best aspect of this beer.HAS A nice subtle bitterness from the hops,highly recomened to try this one."
"Often pilsners are overlooked by beer geeks because they're not ""big"" and exciting. This pilsner shows craft and deserves attention."
"22oz. bottle served in a pilsener glass. Best by 01/04/2011 indicated on the bottle. Pours a translucent orange gold with copious tiny bubbles effervescing from the base of the glass to the underside of the cap. Head is one inch, bright white and latte-like. Nose is citrusy with grains and a kiss of Saaz hops. Taste consistent with nose - cereal grains are expressed and there is also a touch of sweetness in the mix. Finishes with a combination of lemony citrus and a mild hops bittering. Mouthfeel is light bodied and lively with a crisp finish. An extremely pleasant and drinkable Czech Pilsener. Having had both the bottle and draft version, I have to say that I found the bottle to be the more preferable of the two."
"Pours a two finger white head that fades quickly to a thin leaving some lace. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Almost clear pale yellow/amber color. Nose is grassy hops. Flavor is sweet grass with light bitterness. Good pilsner. Their site puts the ABV at 5.5%. $4.50 for a 22oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA."
"Bottle, thanks Cody. Pours a clear light orange with a small white head. Largely blank nose with some light grains and hops, certainly nothing off-putting though. Flavor is good, though I'm a sucker for this style. Very good balance between malt and hops, this comes off as fresh and bright, with a short, crisp finish. Super nice flavor here. Not as grassy as many Czech pils, but the balance and profile is superb. A lot of people will pass this one over as it's not super exciting, but it's quite well crafted."
"A very Berkshire brew - it's not outstanding but really solid, traditional, and good example of style. I like it and hopefully I'll see it on taps around Boston soon as Steel Rail and Coffehaus seem to dominate."
"D - Overall a pretty good American example of this style. While not up to the best Czech and German versions, and not even the best US version, it is quite tasty and a good summer thirst quencher. Think the rest of this is gonna go well with the burger that is just finishing on the grill."
"Taste starts with pale sweetness, cuts with a sharp lemonness, then crisp Saaz comes on strong at the close. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is very nice. Yet another good brew from BBC."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, very good representation of style, this is a very good sessionable beer to drink for a long time."
"Drinkability - Complex, balanced, and very drinkable. I really enjoyed this beer and think that it is a great addition to the Berkshire seasonal lineup!"
"The aroma has hints of the grassy, spicy hops and just a slight hint of the sweet malt. Upon first sip, you're hit with those hops. As it lingers in your mouth, you get the nice sweeter malt flavors. It's really hard to describe their flavor as they don't hang around too long before the flavor turns back to the hops and leaves a nice dryness. It's really hard to stop drinking this one. The carbonation in this beer, though relatively effervescent in the glass, is more mild in the mouth, though you can feel it tingle a bit on your tongue. It helps this beer go down easy, keeping it refreshing. While it may not be huge in-your-face flavor, it's just the perfect amount of flavor with a nice dry finish. This is exactly the kind of beer needed on such a beautiful day. I see myself buying more of this beer in the future. It's another excellent beer from a great brewery."
"Plenty drinkable. Low ABV helps for sure, but it's just good stuff. Drink it cold, drink it slow or suck em down. However you want to do this is a good pils. Tastes like a good pils should. If there were beers that could completely displace adjuncts given the exposure, stuff like this would do the job."
"drinkability is great on this one..could drink em all day long.. :)"
"F: Finishes very clean and crisp, just as it should. A slight lingering sticky feel takes away from it a bit. Some lingering toasty malts and lager flavors, as well as that dry lager yeast like straw slight saison etc flavor is there just a tad. A slight bitterness in there too and the slightest memory of the noble hops, as well as a mild grassy hop taste. Mostly dry but that slight sticky sweetness sticks, perhaps the only flaw."
"Overall, the bomber went away fast. Try this if you like the style. I hope this becomes a year-rounder. You guys at BBC had me at negative many years ago, but have brewed your way back into my favor. Drink this."
"Well I think I have found my new favorite summer brew !"
"Glad that BBC is sticking to their guns and brewing great beers to style, this is no exception, phenomenal!"
"As a regular fan of BBC brews, I was not surprised by the overall tone of their take on a German style: subtle where other American breweries are harsh; understated where others are hamhanded. A quickly-disappearing cottonball head let loose with waves of hops and oranges and a distinct cloud of malt sweetness. More of same in the taste, with some grassy flavors that rounded things out nicely. No overhopped sting at the end, no syrupy suffocation from the malt at the beginning. It could have been a wee bit drier in the finish, but that's a quibble. This was also slightly undercarbonated for my taste, but still hit the spot on a hot evening. Worth seeking out while it's available."
"Clear gold with a fluffy white cap. Good head retention, lots of sticky lacing clung to the glass. Very hoppy aroma, floral and slightly fruity, lemon zest, with a little bit of spiciness. Slight sulfur character as well. Hiding behind the hops is a delicate maltiness that's easy to miss at first. Bitterness was present throughout, balanced rather than being up front and bracing. I was expecting a little more of a bitterness kick from the hops, but it ended up working with this beer and there was certainly a lot of hop flavour jammed in here - floral for the most part, with a fruity and spicy finish. Clean maltiness provided a bit of sweetness. Dry and medium bodied, average carbonation, crisp. Quite good. Much better than most lagers being churned out by otherwise respectable craft breweries in the US (other than several in PA) and a solid pils. I enjoyed it and will be picking up a few more of these in the near future."
"cheers"
"D- This one goes down extremely easy,like water only much more delicious. It makes me glad that I have 5 gallons of it on tap. Still, I don't think this is going to last me very long."
"Overall it wasn't a bad pilsener and definitely worth a try if you see it on tap as BBC doesn't do many lagers."
