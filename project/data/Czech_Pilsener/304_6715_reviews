"had this and pilsner urquell in prague and I thought pilsner urquell was much better. this was a decent substitute though"
""
"A pretty average beer; in my opinion not much better than the American Budweiser"
""
""
""
"This beer was so good that a certain American Brewer stole its name. It is light, clean and crisp with light grain flavors. Straw gold, effervescent with a crisp hop accent."

"Review based on the BJCP2008 (style 2B - Bohemian pilsner). Bottle 33 cl - Batch unknown. AROMA: mild sweet and grainy aroma with some DMS. no floral hop aromas. APPEARANCE: gold color and translucent. thin creamy white head with average retention. TASTE: mild sweet grainy flavour. medium-low bitterness with a medium-dry finish. PALATE: medium-thin body with medium carbonation. OVERALL: a bland bohemian pilsner. where are the Saaz hops? NOTE: the label says ""Czech Imported Lager"" wich we are inclined to believe this is a special batch without the hops. We have in memory that this beer is more hop intensive than this drinked example."

"It's really cool to finally be able to try this one."

"This is a lot better than I remember it tasting a few years ago in the US. I do enjoy this quite a bit. The funkiness is by no means overwhelming but it is not a world class beer. Better than any american adjunct lager that I can think of, and with substantially more aromatics and character. I would definitely recommend this as a beer for beer's sake, nothing more."
""
""
""
""
""
"I don't have any notes from when I tried this beer but I do remember it being a good example of a pilsesner. I can recommend for anyone who enjoys them."

"Tasty and refreshing, albeit rather simple on the whole. There are at least no unwelcome aspects."
""
"Final Thoughts: All in all a good Pilsner, and the kind of beer that strikes me as the perfect ""End of the work day"" beer. Make no mistake though, there's nothing incredible about this beer, it's just a well made, simple Pilsner for quenching your thirst and easing your mind."
"Its a good lager, but it is one with a mass produced, retail quality. I would not turn it down, nor would I purposely go looking for it."

"It sure would be nice to have a fresh version of this beer. My sample is fair enough but one has no idea how it has traveled let alone when it was brewed and bottled. Still, it retains a noble hops smell and taste and actually leaves a slight warm bread grain flavor which is quite tasty. Drinkable and preferable to an American Budweiser."
"Poured from can.  Aroma is grassy hay.  Very clear golden color with white head.  Light bitter taste.  Light bodied, with lively carbonation, and a dry finish.  Overall a nice crisp lager."

"The fact that this beer (and style) are so neglected in the U.S. is really a shame. While I must admit that I drink ales almost exclusively, this is one of my favorite lagers. I have had it on tap in Prague and throughout Europe; in the can and the bottle. While drinking it at its source was better, this is still a crisply refreshing but spicy and complex classic out of the bottle or can. I strongly disagree with most of the reviews here."
""
""
"This is THE Czech pilsner! I first had this beer in Europe where they called it Budweiser. Here in the good old US a beer that has been made for hundreds of years has to change the name to Czechvar because of corporate lawsuits. Anyway, this is a great beer. It has all the characteristics of a pilsner. A little malty, a slight bit of hoppiness, but its very grassy and a wonderful summer quaff. It is one of those beers you could session easily and very enjoyable on a warm summer evening, although its not really that way at the moment in these parts. Do yourself a favor and try this beer, its a true classic."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a fine quaffable pilsner. Apparently over-hyped, perhaps owing to its name conflict with the fizzy American swill, but leaving all that aside it's still a quite nice pale lager in its own right."

"Overall: solid beer, represents the style well. Prefer Czech pils to German as they showcase the hops much better IMHO, Czechvar is a good example of this. My only dislike is that it went flat fast. Maybe I was just drinking too slow (I know that's what you were thinking)."
""
""
""
"My mark out of one hundred would be 77."
""
""
""
"O: Kind of disappointing but still easy to drink, but nothing much to recommend it easier. DOesn't hold a candle to Pilsner Urquell."
"Overall - In my mind a good but not great pilsner. Definitely not preferred to Pilsner Urquell, but a satisfying beer that hits the spot in any situation."
""
""
""
"O: Overall a good beer. I'd say this is a great selection for hot weather days and would also be great for washing down a meal."

"There's nothing especially unique about this beer, but it's just a very well made pilsener that's worlds better than American Budweiser."
""
""
"O: good lager, but like its compatriot Urquell, not really living up to it's name"
""
"O: This is not a style I've really explored and I was all set for a one dimentional Pilsner but instead I'm very pleasantly surprised."
""
""
""
""
"11 months before BBD"
"Overall: I remember this beer as Budvar when I was in Slovakia and the Czech Republic. Bottle says Czechvar, but it is still the same beer. A very traditional pilsner beer."

"Pours a crystal clear medium golden color with a smallish white head that quickly dissipates to a bubbly ring on top. Skunk hits my nose as soon as I wrangle the cap off the top of this and mostly dissipates as my beer opens up. Spicy floral hops and sweet bready grainy pilsner malt with a hint of rich melanoidin make up the bulk of the aroma. The flavor is sharp with spicy hop flavor, balanced by a honey like sweetness wrapped into a brown bread. Medium body with a spirited level of carbonation and a slick bubbly mouthfeel. Once the mercaptan left I really enjoyed this lager!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Give me a pitcher of this, and I'll be set...for about 15 minutes. Thank cripes this comes in cans too, because green bottles. In the right mood and setting, I'd drink this over BCBS even."

"I would buy it again, but it is not my favorite."
"This is an ok beer. While it beats its American counterpart under the same name. It's just not a great European beer. If I was at a Pub, I cant imagine myself ordering it. I wouldn't turn it down if it was offered to me but it wouldn't be a choice of mine. The taste is really lacking and the smell if average. Reminds me of PBR, which I happen to like, but this beer costs European price so It's just an ok beer to me."
""
""
"Clear, pale straw colour with a bubbly, fast-receding head. Aroma of honey and strongly of fresh hops. Balanced flavour. Begins malty and sweet, fairly lowly carbonated for a pilsner, finishes with a soft bitterness. Slight metallic and honey notes, touch of caramel. Very clean and dry finish. Light body ."
""
""
""
""
"Overall quite nice, completely different beer from the American one with the same name, although I already knew that. Very flavorful and tasty, refreshing. A lot like most of the Czech Pilsners I found in Prague."
"O - Overall I enjoyed this beer, nice Czech notes, quite pleasant and drinkable, much better than our American named counterpart."
"It's semi-sweetness wins over my sweet tooth and this is the Czech Pilsner beer to beat in my eyes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Light but in a good way. It still retains a nice flavor and is devoid of any off-flavors that people often associate with lighter, mass-produced styles. Very clean and drinkable. Appearance was way off for me though, freshly cleaned glass too."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a pretty straw yellow with a thin ring of foam that quickly dissipated. About par for a pilsener. Scents of lemon and grass, with a noticeable sour, skunked scent. About what I expect from a pilsener. It would be a bit better if it didn't have the skunk. Flavor is mild, with an upfront hit of lemon, a nice mellow hop bitterness, sweet pilsener malt and some light, grassy hop notes. Nice and mild, one note flavors and easy to drink. It tastes like a good pilsener should. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate carbonation. Par for the course. A very good Czech pilsener, a bit stronger a showing than Pilsener Urquell and nice for hot weather."
""
""
""
""
""
"Though lagers are not my favourite style, this one is one of my preferred Czech lagers/pilseners. Moreover, it's available at an attractive price, which makes it a fine everyday beer."

"Pours out a light golden color and the body is crystal clear with medium carbonation and a light white head. The head quickly thins out into a layer of fine lacing and several small islands of bubbles. Light hops and malts are the mainstay of its aroma, there is a slight skunkiness to the smell; this had me concerned, but there is no sign of it being skunked in the taste. It’s light bodied, crisp and mildly bitter as you swallow. The hops are more prevalent in the taste; the malts take a back seat. This is a semi-dry beer sand the taste gets a little more flavorful as it warms up, some mild fruits do come through along with some lemon and grapefruit zest."

"This was much fresher than the last one I had tasted, this makes a whole lots of difference for Pilsners. This one was not metallic. I found this very well balanced and pleasant; it is a pity that the “fake” Budweiser is not as good as this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a true Pilsner beer second only to Pilsner Urquell tasted at the brewery. I really enjoy drinking this beer when I can. Too Bad it is not reeally available in America because of the trademark problem. American Budweiser has ruined the reputation of this brewery and its wonderful beer. I am looking forward to the time I can visit Budvar and taste this beer at the brewery. This beer is truely one of the best beers in its class in the world. When in Germany or the Czech Republic be sure to try one of these and you too will be a fan."
""
""
""
""
"Not a bad beer, decent for the price I guess. Have never seen this in my area, so bought a 16 oz can when I travelled to Ottawa. Nothing out of this world, but it's ok. Didn't have the bad aftertaste that so many mid-level beers seem to have nowadays. Pretty smooth going down, decent flavor."
""
""
"O - One of the best Pilseners."
"Pours clear deep golden beer, sparkling, with 1-finger off-white head. Distinctive sweet honey and floral smell. Clear sweet malty taste with tones of manure and nice herbal bitter finish on the other hand. Well-balanced, medium-bodied classic czech pilsener. A legend of the style."

"Not bad for what it is. It doesn't foam up much, it has a lovely gold color. It's neither sour nor sweet. Acceptable but not remarkable. Better than an American pale lager, but that's a low bar. If you serve this to idiots they will think it's really fancy."
""
"I just wish I could get it in cans, it's only sold in green bottles around here."
""
""
""
""
"Clearly a distinct pilsner. Nice, deep golden color. Smells floral and citrusy, nothing special there. Taste is what sets this beer apart from most other European pilsners/lagers: malty sweetness counterbalanced by citrusy hoppiness finishes with pleasant lingering bitterness. All these characteristics are more pronounced than in most of the other eastern European or German pilsners. Very smooth and drinkable. Admittedly, I had some better craft pilsners, but this is one of the better macro ones and surely one of the better brews available in Sarajevo."
""
"This is what a pilsner should taste like. Its approachable easy drinking but also bold and flavorful that could stand on it's own against any hoppy ale."
""
"Malt forward, bready, biscuit, cracker, slight toasted. Hop bitterness is moderate, mainly herbal-spicy. Crisp-dry finish. Body is light, creamy, crisp, refreshing, nice carbonation."

"I love this. Worth the money and much, much better than you-know-what."
""

"Overall good beer. Surprising, to be honest. Was expecting a light-macro lager. That's not what I got."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: tons of drinkability. even with my complaints, still found this a pleasant easy drinking lager. cool to have ""budvar"" in the states."
"Had many of these on the trains between cities, and was very surprised at the good taste. One two three and more and more. Try it if your lucky enough to see it. Refreshing clean and very enjoyable for social drinking. Quite common in the area and cheap. Czech beer in my opinion is some of the finest brew in the world.Even if its brewed by ""bud""."
"Overall a very good session lager. I would love it if this became more readily available at a low price here in the Netherlands. Luckily those big German beerhalls right across the border sell this stuff for the same price as our supermarkets sell Heineken."

"Pilsener is perhaps the most difficult genre to brew well, for the brewer has nothing to hide behind. No barrels and barrels of hops; no crazy combinations of toasted and roasted malts; no high ABV to mask off flavors. In every 10 Czech Pilseners, I may find one that is worth revisiting. Budjejovicky's Budvar is a slightly unique, well-balanced rendition of the genre that has made it onto my short list. I'll be revisiting this brew soon."

"Nothing to write home about, but certainly a step up from most random Euro-cans you find on shelves here in Ontario."
"I am editing my review. Purchased at a grocery store for 1 euro in Salzburg, so provided this doesn't poison me there is value for the money. Drinking out of a can so no opinion on color or head. Expiry date that says good for another 10 months so that is good. I did spend a euro. The smell is faintly yeasty and grassy but nothing overwhelming. The taste was underwhelming. Faint hoppiness, but overall it seems to taste like a mass produced beer like....dare I say. Nothing offensive about this one. If it was hot out and this was cold it be nice. I was disappointed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. Has a good deal of flavor. A bit too malty but a very solid lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, an enjoyable brew that I'm sure has not suffered the curse of the green bottle. I still prefer the new packaged Pilsner Urquell though."

"What a czech pilsner is about for me. On the bigger side of a czech pilsner, but it was so utterly drinkable. This is just one of those beers that I can keep on drinking til the cows come home."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a becker a very light golden with a nice looking fluffy white head atop.Aromas were grainy and lightly toasted,not much hop presence.A sturdy fuller feel with toasted grain flavors and mild sweetness.A classic Czech lager with pretty much no frills but it's better than most if not all American macro wanna be Czech lagers out there."
"Edited: The more of these I have, the more I enjoy them."

"But if you like this type of beer then buy it and drink when the Czechs hit the soccer pitch this week for the fight in the European Cup Football Games this month."

"Overall- I love it, for lack of better terms. I had a pesto tomato pizza with this beer. I like this beer much better than the ubiquitous Pilsner Urquell. I recommend this beer. It is my favorite international pilsner."
""
""
"Overall - not a bad brew at all for the type."
"Great tasting, poor appearance though."
""
""
""
"Not much else to say about this beer. I never could recognize complexity in this style the way I do in barleywines or stouts. It is refreshing and a nice pour on a warm afternoon. It is comparable to Pilsner Urquell (and perhaps a bit superior these days)."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a shaker glass from a 16 ounce bottle. This beer appears a quite clear golden straw color with a half inch, quickly dissipating white head. The smell is dominated by a sweet maltiness with a nice hop aroma. This is a very crisp and clean tasting beer. I suppose that there is some bitterness in the middle of the palate. The beer is quite drinkable, it reminds me of a lovely summer evening. In general, I prefer bolder beers, but then again, I'm American."
""
""
""
"Review from 7/2011 notes. Poured into a He'brew small shaker pint. Pours a pale gold-yellow amber. One finger head quickly dissipates, no lacing. Decent continual carbonation. Light aroma of wheat, sweet malt, very faint spiciness and hops. Taste starts adequately,with light sweet malt, very light hops, finishes abruptly with a faint memory of malt and very light hops. Not memorable or worth trying again."
""
""
""
"Sweet malt with a slight diacetyl note which is covered up in waves of Saaz spice. Lovely yeast profile with hints of sulphur. Sometimes I forget how many I've had, each one leads to another so easily."
""
""
""
""
"M. Light bodied without getting too watery in texture, highly carbonated."
""
""
"O - Nowhere near as good as my memory of the tap version, but was still very good. Had read lots of stories about skunked samples, but this one seemed nice."
""
""
""
"O: Ultimately, this beer is fair to middlin’ for its weight class. I wouldn’t actively seek it out, but wouldn’t turn it down if offered. Good with anything salty. Cheers."
""
""
""
""
"im okay with this one, but it doesnt pump me up. pours a pretty average yellow clear colow tih no head. smells like a czech malt whatever beer. taste has a touch of sweetness and dustyn old malty thing going on, but i am uninspired here. mouthfeel is light as can be and minimally bubbled. in think it was more lively from the bottle, but this is very average. as far as czech pilsners go, urquell is still supreme. drinkable to the nines, but bored to tears..."
""
""
""
"Overall this is a pretty nice beer and one of my favorite Czech Pilseners. Would be an awesome thirst quencher on a hot day."
"I went to the store to buy some Konig only to discover they were out of stock. I paid $7.99 for a six pack of Czechvar with a sell by date of 10-10-12. I'm always nervous about beer in green bottles but I figured this was fresh and something new to taste. The beer pours with a clear golden color and about 1 finger of head that quickly settles. I think this beer has already suffered from light exposure as it has a mild case of the skunks going. I imagine it smells and taste much better from a tap than a bottle. The taste and mouthfeel are decent for the style but the aftertaste is bitter and smelly. I won't buy it again."
"I am sad, so sad that the times I've had it on the bottle the beer was skunked, it did not taste the same way than in Prague, that's why overall this beer does not deserve a 4.0."
"O- Sure not the most complex or flavourful beer out there but still an highly drinkable, perfectly balanced and absolutety flawless one. A classic in it's sheer simplicity"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very clean taste and smell was simple. White head of two fingers in height with moderate lacing. Didn't detect any hopping but did sense the pine after taste. A good beer and a would try again but would not go out of my way to do so."
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste was pilsner-style hoppy and dry with a distinctly skunky taste. I can never be sure if that's from improper storage or just a lame beer. But I'll alter my review if my next bottle is not skunky. This was pretty lame. No better than American lager."

"330ml bottle, poured into Leffe chalice. Golden colour, head was small and faded fast, no lacing, clear. Aroma was Parmesan chesse and red cabbage, which to me suggested the use of Saaz hops. Tasted grass and earth, finish was slightly earthy and bitter. Less carbonated than I expected, texture slightly thick, smooth. Passable as a Czech Pils but could have been more interesting."
"RJT"
"Pours a light gold that is as clear as purified water. Very lightly carbonated. Nice thinnish white head. Smell is bitter and a bit like citrus sitting on top of the malt. First taste is sweet and upfront, and gets bitter at the end. A good beer, The mouthfeel is a light body beer with decent carbonation. Overall this is better than American Budweiser and would be ok to session."

"O - The beer has surprised me qua taste. You can totally not compare it with the American version. This is much nicer."
"O-good beer that seems to be well balanced. its definitely less harsh than many european lagers. this is much better than the macros of europe. its nice, crisp, and clean. less hoppy than many other pilsners that i've had, but still fun to drink"
"O: During my beer tour I only had this, Prima Pils and Lagunitas Pils. This pulled out ahead, which I wasn't expecting."
"Overall, this is a nice refreshing lager that is a well-rounded representative of the style. Maybe, it will be in my fridge, but it is doubtful."
"Food match: Goes with steak (well done) and beer-battered fries, or for the vegetarian option a lentil burger and fries would work just as well - nothing too challenging in the flavour department."
"I'd love to try it from the source someday."
"Overall - An excellent sampling of a Pilsner. Will definitely go back to this one again."
"In finishing, I'll say that I really did enjoy this beer, but not because I thought it was interesting or made me grow as a beer drinker, rather that I'm a sucker for seltzer water, so the light, refreshingness of this guy, mixed with its bubblyness, contented me."
"Not sure how old this is. Overall less than expected. The low carbonation and finish was a let down. I would love to try this on tap in Prague."
"Overall, this is a pretty good Czech pilsner, but It kind of lacks any distinguishing qualities. It's really refreshing though, and I'd consider getting it again."
"Final Grade: 3.58, a B."
"Overall: Kind of disappointed with this beer. I didn’t feel like I was drinking a good quality European beer. Will try this one again in the future just to make sure I didn’t get a bad apple."
"Overall, a decent pilsener, but not all that great, even then"
"Pours a clear golden yellow with a 1 inch fizzy white head that fades to nothing. Random thin broken rings of lace form here and there on the glass. Smell is of grains, grass, and a funky sun-dried lemon aroma. Taste is of grains and grassy/herbal flavors. There is a distinct metallic taste in this one too. Mouthfeel is a tad flat feeling with an almost slightly thick mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer pretty much all the way around. I didn't enjoy this one too much but I am glad I picked one up to try the Budweiser from Europe."
"Mouthfeel is probably the best aspect of this beer. Lively and highlights the flavours of the brew. All in all, a great pils, but not something to search too hard for. Prefer Urquell."
"I can find this for under 8 euro an 8 pack in the grocery store here in Italy. Because of the lack of appropriate choices, this is a gold standard of awesomeness for the price-point. A real pilsner is hard to come by here, so Budvar is greatly appreciated."
"I can't say whether or not I'll ever buy this again, as there are other pilsners that pack a little more punch flavour-wise, but those looking for a nice, smooth refreshing summer beer that goes down easy but still tastes like beer, definitely give it a shot."
"O - Great example of a classic style, one that I never have a problem going back too"
"Overall: Easy to drink, more malty than average"
"Of the three, my order of preference is 1) Pilsner Urquel, 2) Czechvar, and 3) Summit “Bohemian Style” Pilsner. The Summit and Czechvar are so close that it comes down to a matter of preferences. If you want a little more of the Bohemian malt flavor and Saaz hops, then go with the Czechvar. Taste wise, I think the Czechvar wins, but if appearance is more important to you, go with the Summit. If you want a cleaner tasting lawn mower beer, the Summit is great cold."
"Could use a bit more carbonation."
"This pours a light golden color very clear with a large foamy white head, when it goes away there is no lacing, you do get a constant stream of bubbles from the beer. The smell is crisp and nice, a little floral hops, sweet bread malt and grassy undertones. The mouth feel is as expected light and crisp with tingly carbonation. The taste is good, it has some malty notes up front with a little bitterness on the way down, although its also a little watery for my taste. Overall a decent beer very crisp and refreshing so its probably go for a hot summer day, but its too watery for my tastes. (There are several other beers I prefer over this in this style)."
"Taste - Sweet pilsner malt, a touch of bitterness, and herbal noble hops. A touch on the wwtery side, but good."
"First off, much better than the ""king of beers"" - its no contest. Nice looking beer poured from a bottle into a glass. Quick foam that disappears rather quickly, but leaves a nice lace. Smell is crisp. Taste has a hint of hops sweetness. Feels much better than average in the mouth and goes down nice and easy. Overall a disappointment - this is I feel this beer is over-hyped. Would gladly have again if given the chance. Fact is there a many better beers offered from the region."
"I have to go with the consensus; this really is a nice pilsener."
"From the green bottle dated 03.14.12. Sampled on June 9, 2011. Yes it is too bad it came in a green botle because that inevitable skunkiness reared its ugly head (or ugly nostril) as soon as I popped the foil covered cap. The pour was straw yellow with no head at all and dead carbonation. It was difficult to catch anything special in the aroma. Maybe a little hoppy thing. The body was thin. There were bits of malts and hops in the taste but my particular bottle was skunked to the max. So it was hard to give it a fair rating."
"Had to try it, I had heard about the Czech Budweiser and when I came across this I picked one up. Even though I was curious I figured I knew what the outcome would be. It's a generic looking Pilsner with a yellow body, white head, not much lacing if any really. The smell is a of some malts, grains, grass and other earthy aromas. The taste followed through with some of the aromas but also has a decent hop bitterness in the aftertaste. All in all, still nothing to rave about."
"This has got to be good canned, hopefully eliminating all skunking issues."
"Budvar/Czechvar pours an absolute pristine goldenrod, it's like looking through yellow tinted glass. There's about a finger of clean white foam topping the beer. It manages to stick around for a minute or two, but doesn't leave any lacing behind. The nose is subpar at best. It basically smells like sulfer and skunked beer. I think there's a faint bit of floral hoppiness in there as well, but it's so far in the background that it's barely perceptible. The flavor is a bit more polished, as sulfer and skunk sink back into minor supporting roles. There's a solid bready malt presence and herbal noble hop notes as well. The body is appropriately light and spry, and the carbonation is subtly bubbly. I'm still not a big fan of pilseners in general, and especially ones produced on a macro scale, but this is one of the more tolerable ones I've tried"
"O - Drinkable, smooth and flavorful this is a great summer starter."
"O -- Overall a very good drinker. I think I actually like the hop balance better in the Budvar than in Urquell these days. The Budvar allows a good flavor of malts through to the palate."
"best pilsner Ive had, if you see it get it, id have 2 or 3 more right now."
"A decent, well rounded lager. The flavour is uncomplicated but refreshing, and the mouthfeel is good. Not the greatest beer in the world, but one that I'm happy to drink repeatedly."
"O: Decent enough. Goes down fast."
"Overall: A good introductory lager. Solid formula. Excellent appearance and taste, crisp and clean. You can't go wrong with this beer."
"D-Very highly drinkable... I enjoy the carbonation level on this one and appreciate it compared to other Czech-style pils."
"O: Fantastic beer. Top of my list for pilsners."
"The mouthfeel is OK."
"Budweiser...really did a good job on this one...my opinion great beer... however the presentation of the can gets an average due to the simplicity of such a complex beer...but all that is shadowed by the taste and the feel it leaves in the mouth which is simply put exemplary!!!"
"Overall-What's not to love. Nothing off. Light and refreshing. Great for hot weather and a perfect accompaniment for just about any food. If only all lagers could be this tasty."
"Between Urquell and Czechvar, I believe that Pilsner Urquell gets my vote. Tastes like a tad more hops and that appeals to me."
"overall this is an OK beer. If you want a lawnmower beer but with a bit more taste and complexity i would much rather drink this then a coors or bud or any other macro beer for that matter. Not the best pilsner but not a bad one either."
"http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"D- Very, I'd have another anyday."
"It's a pretty decent, if not average beer. Interesting. Worth checking out, but not likely to be a session beer."
"Interesting how much a difference 2 years makes?"
"I really enjoyed the original Budweiser, I have been wanting to try it for awhile."
"Poured from 330 ml bottle into my pilsner glass. Approx 1 inch of fluffy white head dissipated quickly with little or no lacing. Clear rich golden nectar. Truly the world's finest budweiser. The skunky malty smell tugs at my nose hairs. It is the finest of pilseners as far as I am concerned and epitomizes the style. Nice mouthfeel. Light to medium bodied with minimal carbonation. Drinkability is-well I could session three or four with no problem."
"I hope my view isn't skewed after so many strong Imperial Stouts and hopped up IPAs. I've had some Czech Pilsners that I like in the past, this just isn't one of them."
"Taste, refreshing, zesty almost lemon like resonance. Very light lemon, don't want you to think its anywhere near substantial. Prickly carbonation. Not much else to taste, tastes like adjunct beer. I'd tell someone to just get the king of beers budweiser, its cheaper, and not substantially different than what you get here."
"Had it in a bottle, I've had it a bunch while in Europe, a nice reminder how great beer was over there. I really love the aftertaste on the beer."
"D: i was surprised that this may be a bud product as it was not very good in any aspect"
"D: Not a big fan of this one, sorta upset this was an incogneito beer."
"Taste is much approved. A simple bready malt feel and faint wet crisp mouthfeel. This could be a little more sharp and crisp I think but I'll take it. Tonic water taste and bread. Clean finishing, really easy drinking, inexpensive as well to boot. Those three things make for very high drinkability."
"D: well besides the smell, this brew is crisp and refreshing. I oughta try this one out of a can. The green bottle really ruins things."
"Well, what can I say...this was horrid and depressing. You got flavor only when you attacked the beer in its initial pour, which is great if you chugged it in that first go. Overall, disappointment but what do I expect from the big name brewer."
"taste is a lot better then it smells. It has a lemon zing, but a bitter brisk. Very crisp drinking style typical of most lagers."
"d- okay, this is a one and done. tried this from a friend and wouldn't seek this one out again. very average."
"Pours a light gold that is as clear as purified water. Very lightly carbonated. Nice thinnish white head. Smell is bitter and a bit like citrus sitting on top of the malt. First taste is sweet and upfront, and gets bitter at the end. A good beer, The Beerhunter was correct in saying this is what 'Budweiser' is and would taste like if only the mega-American brewer would focus on quality over quantity. This one would session quite well in the summer with some mild food."
"Pours a golden-tan body with small head and little retention thereof. Smells crisp and malty, slightly metallic. Tastes very crisp, clean, almost a lighter Pilsener Urquell. Not too hoppy, but enough of a bite to give you a slightly spicy impression. Its a nice light beer, nothing too special, but quite enjoyable nevertheless."
"This is a beer I would buy if I wanted quality and quantity at the same time."
"Overall: How in the hell can A.B. say they have the same recipe? This lager is crisp, flavorful, and drinkable. A perfect companion for my sausage and sauerkraut lunch on a mild Czech summer day. This will probably be the brew by which I will judge all other pilsners."
"Not a bad lager, just rather average in the end."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and is quite sessionable. I could drink these all day long."
"Good enough though for sloshing back a grilled cheese sandwich, a burger and fries, or any other plain-Jane repast."
"Drinkable...that is what this style is all about."
"Several bottles. The fresher the better. Clear light golden, thin white head. Nice wholesome grains, light soft sweetness on the nose. Clean and crisp in the mouth. As a good pilsner should be this one ends clean and a tiny bit grassy. Tight, soft, snappy, and one of my favorite go-to pilsners."
"D- Very enjoyable beer. More bitter than I was expecting so it was a surprise, but all in all a very good Czech pills."
"If I could find it all the time, I would have this in my refrigerator 24/7. A delicious, delicious beer."
"I think this is my new benchmark for what a czech pils ought to be."
"Drinkability: I'm in no hurry to have another, but I'm not going to spit it out like most American macrolagers."
"Go buy some of Argentina's Favorite Beer and leave this on the shelf."
"D A quafable beer. It is nice to have a pilsner that doesn't taste like water. Good all malt pilsner. 3.5 "
"Overall a pleasant drinking experience."
"Mouthfeel is good. Soft but with a refreshing amount of carbonation. Drinkability is just ok. It's goes down easy enough but I'm not interested enough to have another."
"D-Very session-able, nothing uninviting here"
"A godo refreshing, but not too dry beer."
"Great Drinkability and something I would buy again."
"Mouthfeel: it is light, refreshing and crisp. It leaves a smouth finish that invite another mouthful. It is so crisp that regular beer drinkers would love, and beer lovers can dig into."
"Taste is delectable. It's easily one of the most drinkable beers I've ever had, it's creamy and sweet with a nice hop bite. Mouthfeel is a bit chewy and thick but still very crisp."
"Deep gold in colour, brilliant clarity. Poorly retained white fluffy head, no lace. Grassy and faintly floral aroma. Very restrained scent. Clean pils malt flavour, grassy/spicy hops, hint of lemon, soft bitterness, crisp finish. Light bodied with spritzy carbonation. This classic Czech pils is pretty good, but I prefer Pilsner Urquell."
"Drink - just an average beer in my books, not something I'd seek out again."
"T: With bitter taste beginning to end, with a long finish and most bitter"
"D-good but really lacks character and depth. Refreshing, nothing off in the flavor department, but I think there are better choices out there."
"Pours a straw-yellow with thin white head. Not too much in way of head retention or lacing. Smell is grassy hops and grainy malt. Flavour has a little bit of the grassy hop bitterness, with a sweet malt. Nothing too exciting about this, but it is pleasant to drink. A little bit prickly carbonation, but still quite drinkable on a warm day."
"Clear yellow in color with a thin white head. Smells of sulphur and light malt. Taste is sweet maltiness up front, with a sulphur euro lager middle, and a earthy grassy finish. Lower bitterness levels than I expected. Mouthfeel is average, average carbonation. Good drinkability, light and refreshing. Slightly above average Czech pils."
"Probably the best of budweiser's offerings I've ever had. I'm a little miffed at the price but the beer isn't bad at all. If it were priced more reasonably I'd buy it more often. It does leave me wanting another purely for the quality of the beer tho."
"D: This can be enjoyed in all seasons as it provides a thirst quenching aspect to it."
"Chechvar has a decent drinkability. I prefer Pilsner Urquell to this but it's still a tasty lager."
"Pours a nice crisp pale yellow with a white head that has average retention. The aroma is one dominated by sweet corn with a touch of sweet corn beneath it. The beer's flavours are dominated by a lingering vegetal funk, a spicy bitterness and the corn. Great carbonation for the style, feels very crisp. A good drink, hampered by some odd lingering funk."
"drinkability - light, crisp, flavorful, overall enjoyable"
"Slainte."
"Everytime I have an imported Czech pilsner it's like looking at a dirty magazine with all the good bits blacked out - you know it could be good if you could just see it in all it's glory. This is still 6 months away from it's best before which is fresher than most Urquells we get. But it's on it's downward spiral. A fairly uninteresting nose of basic graininess and only the slightest hint of floral spice (unfortunately in equal parts of skunk coming up) leads to a surprisingly fresh, light mouthfeel. Overall it's quite pleasant and I'd take this over the dodgy Pilsner Urquells I spot in most bottle shops, but I think fresh on tap, in it's homeland this baby would just sing!"
"This beer is prettier on draft, I'll tell you that. Mostly there are head issues here; it's short and short-lived, a mess of fizz where there should be a cap of foam. The aroma is lovely and fruity-sweet, full of honey, Italian bitters, ripe pear, and orange blossom. Softly effervescent and nicely balanced on the palate, with restrained lemony and slightly leafy bitterness bouncing off a cushion of sweetly soured grain. Complex it ain't, but drinkable it certainly is."
"M, D- Light, drinkable, refreshing, but without distinct character."
"Mouthfeel has a nice degree of carbonation to it giving the beer a crisp quality. Drinkability is fine as this beer goes down quite easily. Nice thirst quencher and probably a nice complement to lighter foods, but not the most complex and flavorful pilsner I have had."
"Good Czech pilsener to start, and being in a can doesn't hurt it."
"D: A well made pils for sure, but no where near as good as Urquel. Nonetheless, give this one a shot."
"D: One of the best Czech Pilseners I've ever had."
"Bottle serving"
"A pleasantly refreshing beer which I have enjoyed many, many times - the joys of spending ten years living in the Czech Republic. Budvar is by far the best of the mass produced beers the Czech have to offer, and is up there with the best of the micro brewers as well."
"D- A very easy to drink beer with a nice hoppy pilsner flavor."
"50cl can: Picked this up in a food store in France: This one poured a clear, vivid golden color. There was a bit of a white head on it, but it didn't linger at all. Grassy aroma with some faint malts in the background. Some malts to the taste, with a grassiness to the taste. Slightly lighter body. Just a touch bitter. A very tasty and easy to drink beer."
"D - Super drinkable, could easily down a good amount in a session, this beer is light but loaded with flavor, a very good lager, excellent for a summer barbecue and one I would definitely have again"
"Light amber color but still a nose Pilsener, however noted by the lime but also very pleasant mild mile. The palate does not disappoint and offers several flavors, and a presence and a creamy finish slightly malty mid-way between the bitter and the sweet and spicy lemon zest which are present. Easy to drink and pleasant taste."
"This is really quite good, and I don't think I'm giving more than a tenth of a point or so for being a ""non-craptastic Budweiser"""
"O: Solid, refreshing and down the middle."
"This beer isn't terrible, nor is it great, though I'd wouldn't refuse another. The perceived sourness overpowering the hop/grain flavors are too much for me to session this. The similarities to Beck's I found interesting considering that it's probably been at least 7-8 years since I had a Beck's. I'm sure it's better over in its homeland(?)"
"D-exceedingly drinkable, could carry for a full-on session, one of the great Bohemian pilsners"
"If you're looking for a slightly less bitter pilsener with still enough hops to let you know it is a pilsener, this is the beer for you."
"D: Goes down ok, not filling, an ok representation of the style. I've had some really good Czech pilsners that I would opt for over this."
"Another green bottle from overseas, another beer that's a bit of a skunkaroo."
"Drinkability - This is an authentic, but basic example of the style. Its pretty good I guess overall, but the style has better options in my opinion."
"The beer has a light golden color with a good head and carbonation. The aroma was light with a hint of sweetness. The taste was clean and refreshing. It went down smooth with an easy finish. This is very drinkable as I had a number of these while relaxing to the music."
"D- Very drinkable... much moreso than the Budweiser we get here in the States!"
"Refreshing and crisp, though somewhat mediocre for the style, but better than many Euro lagers; I'd love to try this in the can for comparison..."
"D- I really enjoyed this beer. Tastes great and I could easily down a few of these. This is a great kind of beer for gulping down with your food."
"O: Very good drinkability. Not as good as Urquell, but still a classic Czech Pilsener"
"Chechvar has a decent drinkability. I prefer Pilsner Urquell to this but it's still a tasty lager."
"Very drinkable. Very tasty. A definite recommendation for the Budvar/Czechvar if you are looking for a pretty good Czech pilsner that you can find most anywhere."
"Taste strikes a pretty even balance between floral, herbaceous hops and the light, barely sweet malt. Finish is crisp and clean with a nice spicy hop bite. Deliciously smooth, but I cant help but think this is a shell of it's fresher self with the green bottles and long journey across the pond. Good beer and the quality is evident, but I would really like to try this fresh from the source."
"As with most pilsners, this one is extremely quaffable. I am usually reluctant to purchase imports in green bottles, but I was impressed with this one."
"Could drink this fairly endlessly. It goes down easy, would be nice on a hot day for sure. Happy to drink it again, but I won't be scrambling to find it."
"Poured into beer mug. The beer appears to be a golden color with white head and very little retention. There is a very skunky smell to this beer that I can't get over. The taste is very malty with a small bit of hoppiness. Mouthfeel is light and carbonation is crisp. Overall, the green bottle just KILLS its drinkability."
"Notes - Good mouthfeel, which for me is just a good level of carbonation."
"Drinkability: Quite a tasty beer and defied my expectations of it, based on similar beers in the style. I don't know that I would be drinking it all night long, but it sure beats the mass-produced American lager that misappropriated its namesake."
"Note: I occasionally find the USA bottled version ""Czechvar"" around my area and I do drink it. It's a bit different to me, or at least I think it is. I think anything tastes better in its native region, but that could be psychological. ;)"
"D - Despite some imperfections, this is a decent beer. I wouldn't chose it over Pilsner Urquell, much less some of the better American craft pilsners, but definitely worth drinking if offered."
"Very nice and drinkable. I wish the american Bud was this good!"
"Otherwise it's very average. The smell is lemony, the taste is caramel and lemon with a grain finish, the hops are present but not doing much, so it's a bit too sweet overall, it's creamy and drinkable but not complex in the least."
"Drinkablity: I can easily drink a six pack of this in one night. It pairs well with light fare like lime chicken and sandwiches"
"No pleasant."
"I must say, after drinking primarily Munich Helles the last month, I lean a bit more in the favor of the Helles for it's higher level of malty-mineral complexity, but this is really a decent brew. I will buy this again"
"D- This would be an excellent beer in the spring or summertime. Very refreshing. Personally, I would chose something like a witber over Czech Pilsners on a warm day, but this would do great as an alternative nonetheless."
"This is certainly an easy drinking pilsener, but I'd hesitate to put it in the same class as Urquell. The green bottle certainly raises a concern for freshness, but even with what I believe is a reasonably fresh sample, it seems to lack the vibrancy and finesse of the other brew. Side-by-side this seems more work-a-day, but that doesn't stop it from being a refreshing option when the sun is blazing down."
"Been wanting to try this beer for years, I guess like everyone I was intrigued by the Anheuser-Busch controversy. Plus, I really like European lagers. I personally think Urquell is a beautiful beer (the only other Czech beer I've had). This also is a pretty dam fine lager. Probably not as good as Urquell, but still pretty good. If you're a fan of Euro lagers like I am, you will like this one."
"Very drinkable, good session beer."
"I didn't mind this at all. Moderately flavored with a crisp and thirst quenching nature about it, I could down a couple of these in a sitting no problem."
"Still not my favorite, but a nice, easy drinking pilsner. Usually fairly cheap at the LCBO, I say go for it!"
"Overall: Not as clean as pilsner urquell. Has more of a bite and grassy taste. Freshness presumably not an issue."
"NOTES: BBCSD-0910-Sean, BJCP-Bohemian Pilsener"
"For a Pilsner, this really is the icing. The original and what most others are held against in comparison purposes. Aroma is of malt and hop. Pours a clear golden colour with a thin white head. Taste is great. Malt and hop in the taste with a little bitter aftertaste is just wonderful. This brings be back to Prague where I downed quite a number of these pints. Hopefully will get back there again, this time to visit the brewery."
"500ml green bottle at The Only on King in London, ON. Pours a dark golden hue with a thin ring of bubbly white head. Some speckles of lacing cling to the pokal. Smell and taste are sweet and wheaty pils malt, fresh cereal grains, grassy Saaz hops, and lemon. More wheaty-grainy flavours in the semi-dry aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium, crisp and refreshing with lots of peppery bite from the hops. Not much to this one: just a lovely, well-crafted pils. I could drink this by the gallon."
"Easy drinking , with a slightly thin , watery mouth feel. a good beer. Good over all balance."
"D: A little tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, it seems like just a slight upgrade from a typical fizzy yellow beer but overall it's not a bad beer."
"Taste: Slight sweetness that fades quickly into a nice hoppy bitterness. Very nice pilsner flavor."
"I could do a couple bottles of this stuff, it's not heavy. Very quenching and would be a good patio quaff. Leaves me wanting more."
"D: not bad, i like that i can actually taste some hops in this beer"
"As for drinkability, it's fine. It'd be easy to put a couple of these down if they were handy."
"D-4.0"
"I could drink quite a few of these, but it's just nothing special. When I need a pils fix, I'll stick with the German options."
"Drinkability: Exceedingly refreshing Czech Pils with a much better than expected malt body. Could have used a touch more bitterness for balance, but that is a very minor complaint. Until I retry Pilsner Urquell, this is my favorite Czech Pilsner. Edit: this is definitely better than Pilsner Urquell."
"A I was a little confused by this one, not the beer but all the names attached too it. It's good too know all the people who order a Budweiser overseas might drink a decent beer unexpectedly ."
"I think I'm going to go back and purchase it."
"D: An outstanding session lager. Leagues ahead of that other Budweiser."
"Overall, a very good example of the style. I would very much like to try these near the source, I suspect it would be excellent."
"D - Drinkable but only one per evening."
"Drinkability: Worth a try. Fairly tasty, easily drinkable -- it's a nice little beer."
"Quite drinkable!"
"If only American Budweiser was as good as this..."
"Drinkability - I wouldn't want another from this batch but I'll give it a second shot soon."
"Overall - By far, my favorite Czech Pilsener. Now if only the American Budweiser was like this. I'd be drinking it all the time. A great, and inexpensive beer."
"This beer was poured into a pint glass. When first pouring the beer out the amount of foam that it gave off was a good inch and a half. The aroma is a skunky aroma that greets the nose. The coloration of the beer is that of a yellowed brown. The taste of the beer has the skunky taste but also has tones of a hoppiness. Overall a decent beer for the summer months."
"D: I could see having a few of these, I suppose, but if I had to choose, I'd take the Pilsner Urquell. I got tired of smelling the Skunkiness in the Czechvar every time I had a sip. The Pilsner Urquell, by comparison, was less skunky to begin with, and lost the smell after a while. It also had that slightly sweet component of taste which balanced the hoppiness nicely."
"Drinkability: like a good pilsner, this rates pretty high on the drinkability scale, though I might get tired of the skunk smell each time I open a bottle."
"Yeah, it's a good enough beer and I'll bet it really shines when fresh but it's not something I see myself rushing back to drink again."
"D - While this beer isn't terrible, it certainly doesn't warrant mass consumption and I certainly won't be getting it again but it's refreshing for the time-being and drinkable at lease."
"I liked it - reminds me of my time spent working (and drinking!) in EMEA."
"If you have friends that claim to not care what they're drinking, hand them one of these. They will see the light."
"The nose wasn't strong but, clean like the taste. The most prominent taste was that of hops and a less prominent taste of malt and floral flavor. It wasn't bitter at all, it's one of those beers that make you want to take another sip. Also, it was more on the thin side but, not completely. I would recommend this beer. I didn't have another one because, I wanted to try Mack, a Norwegian beer which is brewed in the northern-most brewery in the world."
"Pours a light golden color with one inch of white head that quickly settles to a thin cap. Spotty lacing is left on the glass. Has a strong, unmistakable aroma of Saaz hops. Spicy and herbal in quality. The hops bring it in the flavor as well with a potent herbal component. The malt really does not play a part in the flavor. Bitterness is high for a typical pilsener. Finishes extremely dry. I like my pilseners dry and hoppy so I really enjoyed this one. Could use a little balance from the malt. Light body with abundant carbonation. Could tone down the carbonation a little. Extremely drinkable with one likes Saaz hops. I could see myself enjoying these by the .5 liter mugs on a hot day."
"I feel like the alcohol percentage was higher, I dont normally get loopy after a half pint of 5% beer, and I ate at the same time, maybe dehydrated."
"Pint at Three Good Things in El Segundo tonight for four dollars, was in the mood for a beer and this was about as interesting as their selection got, color is a light golden yellow, creamy one inch white head, not much retention, no lacing, aroma is very weak and has some skunkiness, yeast, light grain, grass, and maybe some citrus, taste starts off light with some grain, watered down in the middle, finish is yeasty and grainy, pretty crisp at first but not once it warms, chewier by the end but this is meant to be a refreshing pilsner and it does not really achieve that, slightly chewy and watery mouthfeel, thin bodied, way too much carbonation, taste does not last, goes down easy and does even seem five percent, light and not much to it, drinkability is good but flavor suffers as a result, little better than the standard Budweiser and also different in many ways, although I do see many similarities as well, would not drink again, not recommended"
"D - This beer feels light, crisp, and refreshing. Definitely sessionable."
"I poured into a pint glass to a short lived white head. It is golden yellow and clear. I immediately got a skunk beer smell, even worse than Heineken. I do get a sweet smell after I get over the awful skunk smell. The taste is worse than the smell. I taste metal and I think there is actually a hint of skunk ass. I have never tried skunk ass, but this has to be a close equivalent. I was offered two of these and I am definately glad I only took one. I'm sure its better in the Czech Republic, so they may as well keep it there."
"I ordered a bottle in a us bar, amsterdam ale house, and although it wasn't as good as the belgian original, it was actually very good."
"This seems like a beer that is a victim of extended ""shelf aging"" in a green bottle. Blech."
"You guys are all posers. Don't you know there is a Budvar 10 and a Budvar 12, and furthermore the Budvar that earned the reputation is the 10? The 10 and 12 are like night and day. Go to the Czech Republic and have a Budvar 10 on draft. All we get in the states is the Budvar 12, which is nothing more than a glorified Becks, and all these geeks love to talk about the Budvar's superiority over A-B when they have never even had the Budvar that is the cause of the whole brewhaha. HA HA indeed! Get out of your mom's basement and travel!!!"
" A very clean flavor from a simple pils is really all i ask. This one has a wheat and corn in the malt flavor with gentle fruits for more depth. This one is a nice 'with-dinner' beer. the feel is crispy and fresh until the end. and since it's from a green Imported bottle, that's a really good thing."
"Been wondering about this for a while. Pale golden color. High amounts of carbonation. Noble hops aroma (slightly flowery) and flavor are definitely noticeable, but not dominate. Pale malt flavors provides a little sweetness. Drinks easy, but not too memorable."
"cannot complain about this beer, wish a 30 pack was as cheap as american budwesier"
"Poured from a green bottle into a weizen glass. Has a rich gold/brown color with a small head. There is a slightly hopy aroma. This beer has a rich pilsener flavor with a somewhat bitter aftertaste. Feels good in the mouth and goes down fairly well. Overall a pretty good beer."
"Czechvar's okay. It's not good by any means, but I've had worse. It doesn't vary from the bells and whistles you'd normally find in the style. It's far from a looker and the nose is underpowered and very average. Those aspects need some work. Otherwise, it's above average, but doesn't dazzle in any respect. It's probably worth a try, but I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it. It's far from a memorable experience."
"4 still good for a lunchtime brew, accompanied by a sandwich. i expected more from this one, though."
"Very solid without being special."
"pours a beautiful golden summer color with a minimal head a great ring and decent lacing..the smell is floral hops some citrus and sweet malt.. ahh the original Budweiser what a great lager and summertime brew i like this lager it drinks/looks like a wheat but drinks like the true pilsner it is the taste is floral noble hops with a nice sweet malt finish its a surprisingly well balanced lager and its a great summer brew easy to drink flavorful..i keep it in the fridge all summer long great to have between stouts and ipas. this is a classic lager highly recommended for summer its really good and i am not a lager fan at all"
"pour is pure golden in color with a white head. looks like a classic. nose is minty earth, straw and honey. a palate of bitter and an aftertaste mild of pollen and consistent protein/hair. not very extreme in flavor. not a lot of character. wouldn't have as my pilsner of choice."
"D: Would be easy to quaff several of these in a session, a good every day beer to drink, if a pilsener is what you looking for. Crisp and clean."
"Overall: Despite its unremarkable appearance this is a very good lager with a surprising amount of complexity and very good balance of flavors"
"Overall, it's a really nicely balanced, readily accessible beer. Each of its characteristics are fine-tuned and distinct, unlike some other beers where the components can become muddled. Very drinkable!"
"In a blind taste test, I would recognize this over to the other budweiser. Its fairly drinkable but nothing too special."
"The smell and taste are very clean and crisp, as a good pils should be. There are some light grassy notes, some mild hop bittering...definitely more evident in the smell than in the taste. Other than that, it is a pretty mild brew...the mouthfeel is good, definitely a solid replacement for a macro lager. Very good drinking beer, it goes down smooth and easy. If only they could have grabbed the name before AB's grubby hands got ahold of it, who knows what would have happened."
"Decent mouthfeel, kind of watery but this is a very refreshing lager, like many others but still way better than any macro, very drinkable!"
"Takes me right back to Prague every time. A sweet refreshing crisp czech lager. Don't know if I'd go outta my way to pick this guy up, but always a great memory."
"While the aroma is pleasant, the flavor is much less appreciated back home in the land of ales and spectacular beers."
"Deliciously drinkable."
"Comes out of the tap a fairly average clear amber, but it does have a nice, fine-bubbled white head. Aroma is rather weak, malty, and not promising. Flavor is wan but palatable, malty with a good hint of citrus. Texture is smooth and fairly tingly. I am just not a big fan of pilsners."
"12oz green bottle from McKinnon's in Salem, NH. Pours a translucent golden yellow with a thin film of white head. Smells slightly sweet and biscuity. Tastes malty sweet with some biscuit, caramel, and a fair bit of herbal hops. Clean finish as expected. Light in body and carbonation, and easy-drinking. A solid example of the style."
"Pours a golden yellow colored body, with a big frothy head, very lasting. Has a very malty aroma, some graininess, and also some nuts. Has a somewhat dusty, and grainy taste, with a mineral watery palate. Refreshing."
"Drinkability: Not a bad beer. Not quite a good one. Almost good. A little above average I think, but only by a hair."
"This is oh so very drinkable, the combination of sadly fading memories and the present veritable reality ramming the point home, as this half-litre bottle disappeared quite readily. Protest the stupification of the beer world, in terms of quality and marketing, and partake of this anytime you can. I surely will."
"Pretty much everything great about a Czech beer. High drinkable, very refreshing and very crisp. Finishes slightly hoppy/bitter, but not so much that you don't want to have another. You can smell and taste the hops but they are balanced nicely by the maltiness of this beer. I prefer it to Urquel, but you can't go wrong with either. Nice change of pace beer for a back year barbecue."
"I honestly don't get the hype as in my opinion, this is honestly mediocre at best and quite possibly crap. It tastes more like adjuncts than anything from BMC."
"Czech Pils are highly underrated. I like Urquell a bit better but this is a damn solid and tasty beer that I would take over many."
"Drinkability: A pretty solid beer and one of the best representatives of the Czech Pilsner style."
"Czechs have great pride and heritage in their beer. Beer in the Czech Republic is a matter of culture, national identity and history, and as result of the high quality of its pilsners, the entire world has followed suit in embedding yellow, filtered lagers as mainstream, national drinks of their own. Anheuser-Busch may claim their Budweiser is the 'King of Beers' but Budejovicky Budvar was at one point the 'Beer of Kings' - literally speaking."
"D- Tastier that BMC."
"Overall, a good flavorful lawnmower beer. I mean, it is what it is, but it is better than your average american macro, or green bottle import. No pilsner urquell, but still, a good summer slammer."
"Overall a very well made pilsner. Certainly a great beer to have with a hearty meat dish, or just with friends"
"Not nearly as crisp as I would hope and although it's not bad by any stretch, there are just so many superior options that I wouldn't go out of my way to try it again."
"This beer has a velvety soft and smooth mouthfeel and is eminently drinkable with a refined taste you expect from a good lager. Very enjoyable."
"Crisp and light on the fizz. Very easy to drink."
"I poured from a 12 ounce Czechvar bottle into my SA pint glass. It pours a clear gold with a medium white head. It has abit of a grassy/ spicy aroma, nothing to get excited about. The taste has a pleasant spicy bitterness to it. The finish is crisp, clean and dry. Czechvar is light bodied with good carbonation. A very sessionable pilsner."
"Overall, this is a fine, fine beer from the Czech Republic. If one goes into this tasting know that one will get the butter of a strong diacetyl content, it's perfectly fine. If not, their surprise, I guess. Overall, this is a very nice beer, worthy of the Budweiser name, whether the courts say so or not. I enjoyed it, and provided you know about diacetyl, I expect you will too. Good stuff, and highly recommended."
"Crisp, refreshing, and very drinkable. I like."
"Overall very nice and I bet it would be even better if it were a whole lot fresher."
"D - Very drinkable, a good summer afternoon lazing in the backyard kind of beer. Recommended."
"Mouthfeel is very tight and carbonation is near spot on. Very drinkable and perfect for summer!"
"D Goes down smooth, a light beer, would be a good summer drink. I've had similar beers that didn't cost as much. Not bad, just another attempt by BW to make another dollar."
"I poured this into a pint glass and it had virtually no head. It left no lacing to mention either. It smells slightly skunky with a touch of hops, but nothing overpowering. This beer does not have much flavor. It is bitter with a slightly grassy finish. There is not much aftertaste. The mouthfeel is thin and slightly carbonated. Overall, this beer was better than I expected it to be. It is a crisp and refreshing beer. I am not a big fan of this style, but I enjoyed this sample and could even see myself drinking this again."
"Mouth can feel the typical bitterness of this style,and this starting from the first sip. The carbonation is ideal,one of the best results in my opinion."
"This ""Premium Czech Lager"" (which is actually a Pilsner relabeled for the US market) was a straw gold color out of a bottle. The head was white, short-lived and left scattered lacing down my glass. The aroma was very grainy, dry, and classical as one would expect from a Euro-Pilsner. The flavors started with a hint of sweetness that was then followed by a huge, nothing-but-dry graininess. But there was nothing to it more than that! Admittedly, I thought it tasted exactly as a Czech Pilsner should and the acidity was right on but there was no depth. The finish, however, was quite crisp. The mouthfeel was good, the carbonation medium and the body medium too."
"A nice refreshing pilsener. This beer hits all the right notes, even if it never quite astounds the palate. Recommended."
"D - Drinkable as cold water."
"This another one im glad I got my hands on it. Anyway pours out that beautiful deep golden yellow, with no head and no lacing. Looks real nice. Smell is very fresh for a green bottle, you can really smell the hops in this one. That pretty much dominates the smell, which i really like! Taste is TOP NOTCH! I would of given this a 5 but, its not. It has one minor flaw, it goes down smooth, with perfect carbonation, finishes very dry and the lingering hop bitterness, that is just very satisfying. My only complaint, is that it is a tad watery on the finish. Its like, hops, water, hoppy aftertaste. Its a very minor thing, but its there, so it gets docked .5, because its not perfect. Mouthfeel is also top notch, nice and light with good carbonation. This is a great drinker, i could drink this all night, and it pairs nicely with spicy food and a nice steak. If your a fan of Uruquell you will defiantly enjoy this one! This is the second best czech pils in my mind. cheers."
"Drink is pretty good lager i'd drink it if i lived in Czech."
"Each sip asks for another of this tasty beverage."
"This one is much better than the American lager of the same name. It's a nice once-in-a-while brew."
"I'm always looking for a good pilsner to offset the zeitgeist of big brews, and I'm adding this one to the list."
"Not too heavy of an alcohol taste. Good flavor and good balance. Not too much of an atmosphere, however, but does have a great color to its credit. I am not a big pilsner fan personally, but this is a really good representative for this style. Overall, very good quaff."
"Mouthfeel is thin, highly carbonated and refreshing. This is a great hot weather beer and would be preferred over BMC."
"There is no reason I wouldn't try this again, but I'd prefer another serving type if possible, particularly on tap."
"The original Bud is much better than the ""Great American Lager"". Crisp and hearty with a nice little hoppy kick on the finish. This beer will see more time in my fridge."
"D- It's a really good drinker. I could put more than a couple back in a single sitting."
"Overall, this is a tasty if not slightly bitter. I noted that it worked well with a duck lunch later in my trip to Prague."
"Overall: As sampled, a mediocre Euro lager and nothing more. Hardly up to the ""B" average of BA. Perhaps my sample was light struck; it was well within the freshness date. As sampled, I wouldn't try another."
"This beer poured a light straw gold color. The smell was of a strong hops. Taste was filled with crisp hop bitterness, hints of sweet malt. Mouthfeel was good, and the drinkability was very good. Overall this was a nice crisp and refreshing pils. Not a wowing beer, but a decent beer that I will probably go to again when I'm in the mood for a nice easy drinker."
"D - Didn't grab me. To bitter and not enough flavor to be enjoyable"
"D - It really drinks pretty well. The smell was awful, but it tasted quite good."
"Final comment: A good prototypical Czech Pilsener and highly recommended for those wanting to try out lagers other than the ubiquitous American macro-lagers. Will be trying again, hopefully with less skunkiness."
"Hard to figure that, but I would rather this beer be more consistant, and certainly on the good end."
"Not much taste or mouthfeel to speak of, undrinkably dry, metallic and bitter. Feels thin and light. Over-hyped. I did not finish it."
"I loved in Czech for 6 months and I would have to say this was one of my favorites. Most of Americans didn't like it as much and opted for the less pungent Gambrinus. Great example of a fine Pilsner. I tried back in the US and I would have to say it's not the same. But, still a great beer."
"Correction -- it's not exactly ""by"" budweiser as in anheuser-busch. Thanks to tai4ji2x"
"Not bad stuff here. It is a bit raw, but I kinda like that about it."
"D: Very drinkable; this can be a good session beer. Nothing about it is unplesant, but I'd like to have a bit more flavor."
"I was a bit disappointing by this brew. It pours great and has a good two fingers of head in my pilsener glass. The color is a crystal clear yellow reminiscent of American lagers. The nose is to fair, good use more Saaz hops, but does have a pleasant aroma with a balance between malt and hops, which isn't necessarily a good thing for this style. The taste is OK but lacks that signature taste of a great Czech Pilsener. Also the background holds a bit a metallic taste that is not pleasing, albeit slight. Overall this isn't anything special but OK nonetheless."
"D: Pilsner. Taste good enough to slam without all that heaviness."
"This is a pretty good beer, but I have plenty of pilsners that I would rate higher."
"I've been wanting to sample this one for a long time. It turned up at the Meijer's on the way home from work, so of course I bought it. I'm drinking it at room temp. in a pilsner glass. It surprises me how well it tastes. I was expecting something a little more euro lager-ish. The hops was the first thing I noticed, but as I work on finishing my first, I'm surprised by how sweet and maltly it now tastes. Which is surprising considering that there is ZERO head retention or lacing. Sure, I'd drink it again, as long as your buying. Cheers!"
"Beer pours pale and quite average. Aroma is immediately skunky, like Heineken but without the kick. Taste is metallic, bright and grassy but the skunk is almost overpowering. The mouthfeel is tolerable at best, kind of a thinly veiled lager if you will. Drinkability is better than expected given the mild aftertaste even considering the ""skunkiness"" of this beer. Not recommended."
"D- I could drink these all day long and the only the intoxication would stop me"
"I purchased this alongside its American counterpart, and having sampled both for comparison, the original Czech brew is far, far superior to its rice-laden Anheuser-Busch competition. It's nothing remarkable in and of itself, but it's certainly a good brew for quaffing."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours golden yellow color with a small white head. Aroma was a hint of citrus with some light malt, a touch of skunk. Flavor was nice, a little bitter. Light body, very crisp, could probably drink a ton of these. Good beer, not my favorite style though."
"Overall, its a decent Pils/lager"
"A good example of a pilsner."
"D: Drinkable fair enough, but just not one of those beers I would go out my for."
"Drinkability: Incredibly drinkable, and a great beer. I could drink this beer all night. It does not kill the pallet and is very balanced and smooth."
"A brew that you could drink all night...nothing too heavy, just a good simple brew.."
"The aroma is grassy, a bit grainy, and has all the characteristics of the noble hops. There might be a bit of citrus lime in the nose as well. The taste is just crisp dryness, husky like grain, some grassiness, with a salty dryness in the finish. The is a really enjoyble and refreshing beer. There might be a tad bit of tart lime in the backbone lurking about, but the noble hops and the crisp graininess are the most prominent characteristics that nicely balance each other out. This is a light bodied, slightly watery beer, that does have a bit of chewyness in the finish and into the aftertaste. L'Chaim."
"Crisp and mostly clean on the finish. A little light on carbonation for the style. Very drinkable."
"-Oelergud"
"D: Nice session beer. Perfect for a hot summer day. Leagues above the American Budweiser."
"Green bottle labeled Czechvar. Pours a golden color with a hint of amber and a fluffy head. Malty aroma with a hint of skunkiness that doesn't show in the flavor. Taste is malty, just a hint of sweetness and some light caramel overtones. Nicely balanced and a smooth drinking lager. Easy to put a few of these back with some spicy jerk chicken or when just relaxing. Pretty decent beer though nothing earth shattering. I'd buy it again."
"Overall - Not recommended."
"Overall this one was a pretty good beer I had the American version Czechvar. This happens to be my dads favorite beer, He absolutley loves it, we poured this into a couple of Budvar mugs he got back in the 1970's and had a couple a sat around and talked over all a pretty satisfying beer. not bad]"
"Had a few bottles of this last week at Lir on Boylston Street, as this is one of the few non-standard beers they offer there. Poured into a pint glass and formed a large head that disappeared quickly. Bright yellow color and plenty of noticeable carbonation. Smell and taste were average, but that's the point. This is a smooth drinking, light pilsener that's great to just sit and enjoy on a summer's night after work. Nothing mind blowing, but just a solid beer. One of the better imported pilseners available on the US market."
""
"D- Easy to drink if this your thing. I think I'll pass on this one the next time its around."
"d: pretty weak overall; i wouldn't have it again"
"D- very refreshing, would be excellent in session."
"pours a clear pale golden-yellow with a thin white cap which subsides quick and leaves a little lacing in my pilsner glass ; not a strong smell, some grassy hops and hints of cereal grains ; a good hop bite initially followed by herbal hop flavor and some steely grains, a clean crisp finish ; a dry, light body with a good level of co2 ; a pretty good beer, very drinkable..."
"Poured a bottle into my Miller Lite pint glass. This beer pours a straw yellow with a big carbonation that leads to a big, white frothy head that leaves absolutely no lacing at all. This beer has a slightly funky aroma, but once you get put the green bottle funk aside, it has a slightly clovy aroma with just a bit of pepper. The taste is mildly sweet (also green bottle funk), with just a bit spice at the finish. The mouthfeel is crisp and clean with a bit of a dry finish. It is a very easy drinking beer, but seriously please ship brown bottles or cans to Missouri."
"This is a very good pilsner. Definitely much better than its American namesake."
"Very refreshing and preferable to the famous U.S. beer that stole this name."
"A far cry above the American namesake."
"Not world class, but a god beer if you are drinking many on a hot summer day."
"The taste is full-bodied with a lot of sweet malty grain and lightly toasted bread with a hint of honey. A prominent flowery, herbal hop bitterness, with a hint of lemon, then comes to the fore, becoming more pronounced in the finish, an excellent marriage of fruit, herb, and toasted grain. Incredibly smooth, drinkable, it also has a fairly oily body with a lively zestiness at the same time. It is simply a wodnerful, characterful, full-bodied lager."
"Aromas of slight sweet piney spices, along with the sugary base malt, and some toasted notes compromise the aroma of this beer.Slight alcohol on the finish. The taste is of bready, sugary sweet malts that almost lend a slght sweet corn pop note, but it isnt corn . That is the only way I can describe it. The mouthfeel is nice and soft. Lightly carbonated up front. The bitterness comes in the middle, and finishes slightly dry. All in all, a very easily enjoyable session beer."
"D: I could go all night i love the Slovakian girls."
"D - This is one of those beers that I'll drink if someone gives it to me but I'm not going to go out of my way to buy this beer"
"This one is easy to put down and was surprised how it actually quenched my thirst on Easter (given as a gift). I doubt I would seek this out again but it would be pretty tastey on a hot & humid day."
"A very nice session beer, it would be great in hot summer days."
"D: Compared to its American cousin this was a pleasure to consume. I'm not much of a pilxener fan but this one would be a nice hot summer session beer while fishing or cooking over a hot barbeque."
"D: Yep, but it doesn't taste that great."
"Drinkability : a good beer refreshing Czech Pilsener style"
"Somewhat variable quality, although more consistent that Pilsner Urquell. At its best this is a lovely beer and one of the worlds great lagers. Don't drink it ice cold of you'll miss out on much of the malty richness and spicy hops flavour."
"I couldnt even finish a bottle. luckily my friend found this import to be a delicacy so he reimbursed me for the garbage 6 pack that is supposedly beer"
"A pretty good example of the style, plus its just fun to let people know that this is the REAL Budweiser."
"It has all the qualities that I like about lagers, and even has some smooth flavors and a clean finish. It's noticeably sweeter than most macros, and very smooth and enjoyable. I'll certainly buy this again."
"D - Could have one or two of these. But the skunk always turns me off."
"Actually had this beer in the US as ""Czechvar"". According to Michael Jackson, this was actually the original Budweiser (which I don't care for). However, this original Czech version is not as grainy or strong tasting as Bud, but is tempered with the flavor of some of the lighter Europeans like Urquell. Pilsnar is not my favorite style, but this is not a bad beer, especially served cold."
"Pours a perfectly clear light straw, glowing yellow color with huge fluffy white head and okay tracing. Aroma is lots of pils malt, slight toast and a bit of bright citrus and spice from Saaz hops. A small amount of diacetyl is noted, but overall quite clean. On the palate, the malts continue to dominate bringing a light bready flavor mingling with a lackluster amount of noble hops. Bitterness is just not up to par with its partner Pilsner Urquell giving it a somewhat murkier medium rich flavor. Not as crisp as you would want from a Czech pils. Overall, a rich lager, one that is quite the quaffer, but I would certainly choose Urquell over this brew for its forceful hop flavor."
"D- This is a nice clean pilsener, very drinkable. I could probably drink a case though without being too drunk."
"The ""real"" Budweiser. I was somewhat apprehensive about trying this one. I worried that perhaps the ratings might be artificially inflated to give some love to a product that has stood in direct conflict to Anheuser-Bush in the past, but I was pleasantly surprised. The beer is a straw-golden color with a white head. The smell is typical of the style: bready pils malts with spicy saaz hops. The taste is similar to the smell. Overall though, the flavor is a bit on the weak side. It makes for any enjoyable, easy to drink beer, but I could use a bit more flavor. The mouthfeel is light and crisp, but not too thin. Overall, this is a nice beer that I would drink again."
"D-This is an excellent Bohemian Pils....I enjoy the maltier take on this one...I much prefer it over Pilsner Urquel..."
"Always wanted to try this because of the whole name thing. Obviously the Czech's take on Budweiser leaves a lot to be envied."
"A nice clear golden color with a modest head that disappeared fairly quickly. The aroma has some sweetness from the lightly toasted hops with a mixture of spiciness. The flavor is bread and biscuit but clean and crisp. The mouthfeel is smooth and meduim bodied. The beer finishes dry and quick. Overall a refreshing lager that I could drink all night."
""
"It doesn't linger at all in your mouth, very drying. Definitely one you want sip after sip of when drinking."
"This is easily one of the best macro lagers available. Highly drinkable and easily recommended. The real bud!"
"Overall an average pils."
"I was surprised about how good this beer is, guess my preconcieved ideas of the name Budweiser got in the way."
"Clear yellow with modest head. Aroma of noble hops and a nice bitter lager taste. Somehow, Bohemian lagers taste more bitter to me than Double IPAs even though they have far fewer IBUs. This is great with pub food and, if you are a fan of the style, you could drink them one after another."
"Overall a very refreshing Czech pilsner."
"I could drink these all night."
"Is my memory deceiving me?"
"I picked this one up on a whim and in this case, there's something to be said for doing one's homework. This isn't necessarily a bad beer - it even has a somewhat refreshing quality to it - but it is incredibly average. At least with horrible beers there's something to make fun of. One area of note: the smell is kind of terrible."
"Solid beer, I'll bet it would rank a couple of 5's if I could have gotten a really fresh sample."
"bière de belle couleur dorée plus foncée que la moyenne, la mousse avait totalement disparue après 5 secondes. nez malté sur fond de houblon, la bouche est amère (bonne présence de houblon) elle est très longue en bouche, et surtout très agréable."
"Drinkability: This is a good brew that goes down very easy."
"I could drink these all day, and may damn well drink them all weekend."
"Drinkability- Now the drinkibility here is what the Anhauser-Busch interpretation is not. Actually drinkable. I could drink this on a hot summer day or even a cold winter night like right now. A fine step away from pilsners I have reviewed in the recent past."
"Nevertheless this beer is one that can be enjoyed when one is not in the mood for the heavier constitutions of stouts or ales. This beer will come to mind during summer months..."
"D: I really enjoyed this beer. It's crisp, grassy flavour makes it highly refreshing and the spicy finish makes it truly fit in with the classic czech pilsener style. I could easily put a few of these down in a day. As a matter of fact, I think I'll have another..."
"pours a clear golden color with a two finger white head that fades almost immediately to the beer with no lace at all. aromas of faint hops. bready malt with a slight metallic hop finish. light crisp dry mouthfeel and good carbonation. something new to try but i don't think i'll buy again have had much better."
"Overall--I'm disappointed. I first tried it in 1995 in M*A*S*H (More Alcohol Served Here) in Tel Aviv in my first transcendental beer experience. This may be that this was just a contrast to the awful Israeli and imported (Amstel) beers I had been drinking around then, as well as the forgettable and unsubtle Australian beers (Toohey's Old, New; Foster's Ice...ugh) of my first few years of uni."
"D - Very good. Nice beer. Very easy to drink."
"I was underwhelmed here. It was clean and there were some hops at the end taste, but it was too similar to a Euro pale lager. The malt was very clean and a bit sweet with only a bit of actual grain character. The hops weren't even noticable at first. I will at least say this paired nicely with my roasted pork and sauerkraut."
"MF: The one thing that was not wrong with this beer is its mouthfeel...crisp, clean, with a decent wheat aftertaste Due to the taste/smell, one is plenty...Looking at other reviews, I mostly likely picked up a bad bottle somehow...It was a waste of $1.61"
"A classic in my opinion, a world-famous beer to be tried by all."
"Taste is bitter and hoppy with the Saaz hops being raw and pretty bold. I would almost say this is a German hoppiness, but that would not be very respectfull towards the inventors of pilsner. The malt is very much a pils malt and it can just barely shine through the hop layer that is covering almost all taste. Body is medium and almost full for a pils, though it is not sweet. One of the best pilsner out there!"
"Smooth, was the first adjective I came up with on the first sip. I'd take this over american Budweiser any day (I know that's not saying a whole hell of a lot). Ever so slighlty creamy mouthfeel, with a tad of hop bite in the finish. Balanced, refreshing, and easily sessionable. I'll bet this one is most excellent on tap in the Czech Republic."
"glass."
"12 oz bottle with a best-before date 8 months in future. Bright clear copper-gold pour with a quickly fading head. Clean lightly malty-aroma, without the graininess found in some pils. Hops are faint in the nose. Taste is simple but pleasant, with lightly bready malt, moderate bitterness, and a clean finish. Lacks the hoppiness of the best pils, but no other flaws."
"Too heavy to be a thirst-quencher, not heavy enough to be interesting."
"This beer is very easy to drink and is a very good session beer,i highly enjoyed it and do reccomend it.I myself will buy this one again,especially great for a hot summer day."
"Overall, a decent czech pils. I guess you can say this is one of the style defining beers, but i overall prefer some american alterations of the style. With that being said, this is still a good beer, a touch boring imho, but the body and flavor is enough to make it enjoyable."
"Poured a clear golden color with white head that dissipated rather quickly. Malty aroma that is not very dominant. Taste is malty also, with a bit of sweetness to it. This is not my preferred style and I did not find it that enticing. If I never had another I wouldnt feel like I was missing anything. Smooth, good mouthfeel."
"I've heard about this beer for a while. Overall very good, but the big drawback was a little skunk taste probably from the green bottle. I wish I could have had this when I was near the brewery, but I was too young and grandpa was to strict for that. I wish it was a little easier to find. Growing up in the Milwaukee area and living in St. Louis for a while, I am accustomed to lagers. I would rate this right up there with the Millers and Buds. I will drink this again but it was very expensive to have more than one."
"Drinkability however was outstanding. This beer was exceptionally smooth, well-balanced and light yet still packed with flavor."
"Drinkability: Again, compare this to an American light macro - light, easy going, but with a bit more alcohol in it. Fantastic on a hot day, and extremely sessionable."
"12oz green bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a golden yellow color with a white head. The aroma is sweet grassy malt with some spicy hops. The taste much like the aroma features a nice malt base with a spicy hop finish. Mouthfeel is light and well carbonated. Drinkability is very high and would make a perfect session beer. Overall, this is a highly drinkable brew that is very good. One of the best lagers in the world in my opinion. Recommended."
"Drinkability: One of my favorite lagers and I will glady buy more"
"D: This beer is pretty drinkable, despite being from one of the evil macrobrewery (duh, duh, duh!) I would definitely give this beer another go, especially if I need to cool down and relax. Easy drinking, smooth taste, and refreshing finish makes it a decent brew."
"Pours that typical golden pilsner color with a nice soapy white head. The smell is of spicy pepper hop and cracker malt; you can sense how dry this brew will be. The taste is much like the smell, cracker malt and spicy nobel hops, peppery, hint of lemon, more tart than dry. The feel is light and crisp, slightly dry and finishes a bit astringent. Though on the dry side, it is pretty well balanced for a pils. A protypical Bohemian pils, one that hits the style on the head."
"Overall, a drinkable, pleasant tasting beer, but may be vulnerable to light / expiry date problems."
"Drinkability: Smooth, crisp, with a classic Czech Pils flavor with a perfect ABV make this beer exceptionally drinkable. Served on-tap, this beer is exceptionally fresh and delicious. Much better than its close Czech Rival Pilsener Urquell. A benchmark for pilsener beer."
"As with most pilsners this is not a terribly complex beer but, a tasty, easy drinking one. I had this at a Czech restaurant while visiting relatives in Iowa. I like a good Bohemian pils every so often. I wish I could get this where I live."
"to try this on tap one day."
"This is ultra clean tasting lager, but a little powdery at the end. Kind of a lemony taste is the best way for me to put it, not bitter at all."
"Bought this on draught at the Bull & Caslte in Christchurch, Dublin. A clear traffic-signal yellow with a white head that thinned out but never went away completely. Very mild hops aroma over a distinctly bready malt. A fine malt flavor without getting sweet, the hops took a step back from where they stood in the aroma. Though more substantial than the copycat in the states, this was still a very mild and sessionable brew. I did not give it higher marks for drinkability though, as I did not find the flavor to be enough to make me want to drink it over other beers that are quite sessionable in their own right."
"Rather refreshing and clean. My bottle says 'original Czechvar, Premium Czech Lager, so I hope its the right one. (nowhere does it say Budweiser)"
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: This beer is light bodied on the palate with just the right about of carbonation, very refreshing to drink. This brew also has a very smooth body. This beer is easy to drink and one could drink it all night. This is a beer I can see myself coming back to, though I think I'll explore the style a bit more before doing so. The ""Original Budweiser"" is something you don't want to miss out on."
"D: Excellent, a easy drinking pils, with a nice hoppy aftertaste. This is how a pils should be, dry with robust hoppiness and refreshing. A very tasty brew. This beer beats the Hell out of its American namesake. A Bud that I can be proud to say I drink."
" There is an oily feel to the mouth which adds weight and depth to the beer."
"And to think I'm not a chronic lager drinker?"
"D: Super easy to drink like most lagers. I think this is my favorite pilsner to date."
"Nice clear golden color with a big frothy white head. Slightly hoppy, clean aroma. Taste is much sharper and crisper than the American copy. Little hoppiness, with very little aftertaste. Enjoyable beer on a hot summer day, definitely a step up from the macro pilseners that I'm used to drinking."
"I tried this beer on June 26, 2007 after purchasing from my local LCBO store. It poured a beautiful golden translucent colour. The aroma was a nice grainy aroma that screamed 'drink me!' It is smooth and crisp on the tongue with small hints of carbonation. The favour is crisp and clean with hints of grain. I will definitely try this again."
"Smell: Smells like what it is, lagery, with grassy slightly skunky hop aromas. Flavor is of the same model, with some graininess thrown in. Mouthfeel is light, carbonation good. For all the controversy surrounding this beer, I was expecting something a little better. Not even a great czech pilsner."
"A perfectly clear golden-colored Pils with ample but short-lived head. Pretty nice looking stuff. The nose is very grassy and organic. A bit simple and one-dimensional, but not unpleasant. Pretty dry taste, a bit bready with a slightly muddled hop presence at the end. Not as clean as I was expecting. Hops linger on the palate for quite a while, but not in an unpleasant way. Crisp and well-carbonated but not as bloating as most macro lagers. In all it's a nice Pils, better than most but not good enough to make it stand out from the crowd."
"Drinkability: Excellent. The American ""Bud"" is dreck, but this Bud I could, on occasion, drink without complaint through the night."
"OK, it's better then the AB bud made in St. Louis, but that's not exactly a high bar, IMO. I doubt I will order this beer again."
"Perfect beer for sessioning after a 12-hour workday and just relaxing, which is precisely what I'm going to do right now."
"I found this beer to be very crisp, refreshing and pleasant from the first sip to the last drop. It is a flavorful beer with good old fashioned beer taste, the way I remember beer tasting when I was young and stealing drinks from Dad's beer. It has enough flavor, color, and drinkability to enjoy beer after beer and would certainly make a fine session beer most anytime of the year. I would recommend this beer, and it is sad that the American version is soooo very far from being like this beer."
"Nice beer. Good flavor. Worth drinking."
"D - I don't know if I could session this. It's really good, but wow is it thick! For some reason, the thickness and lighter pils flavors don't seem to go together in my mind. Thick is good for a big black ale, but I like my pilseners a little more on the crisp side."
"As pilsners/lagers go this is definitely superior, however this style is just not my beer of choice these days. Would definitely take this over the standard UK mass produced lagers any day."
"D - Very drinkable as proven when I was in Prague last year. Oh...the memories...anyway, very drinkable."
"Very well made and balanced. Easy to drink quite a few of these. Again very clean and smooth. Good easy drinking pils."
"Please refresh your day with this excellent selection."
"Overall it is a balanced, refreshing and tasteful lager. I simply liked it and probably will have another one."
"12 oz. bottle- color of pale yellow , with a thick but thin white head  crisp nose of straw , hay , hint of metal , and mild hops  taste of straw , hay , corn , hint of metal , and mild hops - body is dry , light , and with low carbonation  aftertaste of bitter skunkyness , mild citrus zest , and mild hops"
"(I agree with some other reviewers that it tastes like the flavor is on ""mute""- and its not because I drank it too cold)"
"Rumor on the street is AB is going to gobble this one up. Oh well. This one poured with a nice little white head and some lace. Mildly hoppy bitter beery aroma. Good yellow gold color. Very nice pilsner qualities. Think I pick up a little corn in there though. Definitely a session beer. Crisp, clean, bittersweet. Finishes the same way."
"D- You could slam 30 of these. But it would be a sad waste of a wonderful beer."
"Beer poured golden with a frothy head, that went away after a little while. The Beer comes in a 12oz green bottle(Czechvar) and possibly due to this had a very slight ""skunky"" aroma. It has a pleasant taste however with everything in moderation. A little bitter, hops, sweetness, spice. All of these are some what muted since this is a crisp lager style. It very drinkable and has a nice enough flavor. I would not rate this as the worlds best lager as the label suggests, but its worth trying and is good regardless."
"Pours a deep gold color with lots of fluffy white head that hangs around a while and laces the glass. The aroma is a little floral and fairly yeasty, also a bit lightstruck, damn green bottles. The taste is of a little malty sweetness, and lots of hoppy bitterness. Mouthfeel is pretty heavy, not real creamy or fizzy, just heavy. Overall, it's pretty drinkable. I'm not really a fan of czech lagers, but I enjoyed it. Nice bitterness, but not so much that it overpowers everything."
"Very refreshing.... a good summer session beer."
"The body is light enough to make this quite drinkable."
"Overall, a seemingly disappointing beer that actually has a mighty fine taste."
"12 oz. green bottle, brewed with Moravian barley and Saaz hops; best before 11/2007. It sits in the pils glass crystal-clear, gold, with an active body that is topped with a finger of whitish head which eventually reduces to almost nothing. Lots of noble hops in the nose (floral/green and spicy/skunky notes) with a touch of sweet malt. The first sip reveals a crisp body and medium bitterness backed by pale and lightly-toasted malts. But soon the hops take over and contribute an array of flavors - skunky, spicy/perfumy notes, pine?, lemon?, lime? - on top of a light/medium, crisp, drying body that leaves a medium finish. Overall a delicious pilsner which is well-worth trying; one that would make both a great session beer and an ideal one for converting your macro friends."
"Refreshing, crisp feel in the mouth. Carbonation seems to fade a bit fast, though. Very enjoyable beer, overall."
"Flavor of herbs, not as bitter as Urquell, but a very good bitterness, grains. Mouth feel is crispy and carbonated and a bit grassy. This is the real deal budweiser folks."
"Very nice lager, can't ask for much more. As refreshing as they come."
"Pours a medium-light yellow, very clear, and with a moderate pure-white head that dissipates reasonably quickly, leaving a small ring and some lacing. Nose is lightly hopped, grassy and citrusy with some light breadiness and full grains. Archetypal czech pils, with Saaz hops providing their distinctive character over the light lager. Taste is light and fruity, lemon and herbal hoppiness over a full and grainy malt bill. Light grassy notes and a touch of crackers and yeast rounds it out. Mouthfeel is nicely crisp and quite well carbonated, and drinkability is very good, though not much above expectations for the style. Very nice pilsner, drinkable and pleasant. If Budweiser always tasted like this I might understand its popularity."
"The taste started with a nice bitter blast from the hops that yielded to some yeasty, malty taste before the bitterness returned for a dry, puckering finish. The medium body and lively carbonation suited the style."
"Pours out a brassy golden body with scant bubbles and a tiny head that fizzles out almost instantly. In the nose I get a little toasted bread, apples, mild sulphur, and spicy, grassy hop. Flavor is extremely bready with a good finishing dryness and spicy hops. Aftertaste is a bit toasty and nutty. Mouthfeel isn't at all weak and has a good presence, both in body and carbonation. This here is a great drinker."
"With the considerable exception of the horrible smell that greeted me when I opened this supposedly-fresh bottle, I thought this was a pretty good beer."
"The Czechvar premium Czech lager pours clear and pale gold with a respectable white head. There is initially a mild floral hop aroma that latter becomes grassy as the beer warms. The taste is definitely maltier than what I've come to expect from the pilsner-style. It tastes a little bready on the palate, then finishes slightly bitter and a bit metallic. Overall a decent beer, but not one I would choose over other cleaner, crisper variants of this style."
"Slightly darker than usual golden color with a touch of loose head. Clean, crisp scent with graininess and a bit more malt hints than most Czech pilsners. Strong crystal malt flavor with late hop bite and a firm finish. Mouthfeel has enough carbonation to carry the taste. This is a top flight pilsner and as easy drinking as they come for a major national brewery."
"Overall, I was pleasantly suprised. A very good session beer. Tasty and goes down very easily. Nice beer for the style."
"The beer is quite a bit drier than I was expecting from the nose and has a nice solid bitterness to it that starts as a nice hop bite in the beginning. In fact the hops are much more prominent in the flavor than in the aroma; here the grassy, almost hay like hop character looms quite large in the flavor profile. There is a touch of herbal lemon character (sort of like lemon grass or maybe even lemon thyme), especially in the finish where a light tartness seems to magnify it a bit. Just a hint of diacetyl seems to round out the malt components; it seems to add a touch of toffee to the finish. The finish also has a nice solid bitter note to it that lingers a bit on the tongue. All in all this is a nice beer, while the aroma was not quite as fresh as I remembered, the flavor was still nicely tasty."
"Seerved in a pilsner glass, the beer pours a light golden color with a very small and thin white head. It smells grainy, and also like grass, apple and some malt. It tastes like grain, malt and some grassy hops. The mouthfeel is light, but smooth and crisp. It's easy to drink. Overall, it's just an average beer IMO. I'd drink it again if someone gave it to me, but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it."
"D: It's the balance that makes this beer delicious and refreshing. I'm not a pils guy but this really was deep and balanced enough for me to enjoy it. I'm just not a pils guy though. Not such a fan of those Saaz hops..."
"First of all I paid twice the price of American Bud for a 6 pack of this beer and I should've stuck with the red white and blue version. I was told by several friends that I have to try this beer and for me it was a big let down. I'm not trying to discourage anyone from trying this beer, but if you're expecting a terrific beer I don't think this stuff will live up to your expectations as it didn't live up to mine. thanks for reading this review."
"Notes: This beer is fairly light in body but so well balanced that it expresses some real weight on the palate. I am not typically a light lager drinker but this is one I enjoy."
"This Bud's for you! (But what is it with the Czechs and the Germans putting good beer in green glass???)"
"I guess all 4's is a good thing and this a the only ""Bud"" in the land. This golden colored hoppy yet malty Pils will certainly make anyone forget about the other Bud..The mouthfeel is smooth, with soothing notes and nice malt balance. The beer is quite drinkable and the nose is hoppy with floral hints. This beer IMO is a notch above Pils Urqell but as said before it's all subjective and this is very true to style."
"Delicate musty hop aroma is quite inviting. Swarms of bubbles rise through the clear golden beer feeding the dense white head that sits above. Clean and dry mouthfeel. Lightly sweet pale malt up front with some herbal/grassy hop flavor. Finishes with a light pungent bite from the hops. After taking a few mouthfuls of beer the flavors are not as noticeable; making for a deceptively easy drinking beer."
"pours out of the bottle and into a tall pilsner glass a perfectly clear golden hue. big thick head and some wisps of lace. a nice pale malt aroma accentuated by some classic saaz hops. a light malty flavour is quickly follwed by lots of grassy and sassy hop flavours...all finished with a good dose of bitterness that lingers on the tongue. medium body and a spritzy, carbonated mouthfeel that picks up the bittering hops quite well. good drinkability. overall probably an average czech pils...but it's nice to finally taste the original ""budweiser"". and it does have more taste..."
"This is not the best beer in Czech. It was a little rougher going down than what I expected. It is must to try just because it is the orginal Budweiser. All in all it is not a bad beer. I would not judge other beers from Czech by try this particular beer. I just found that a lot of the local brews were better when compared to this popular Czech brand."
"This is the pilsner that set the world standard at the Weltausstellung 1873 Wien; the world exposition of 1873 in Vienna. The beer is a beautiful, extremely clear golden color. It's interesting that this gets it low marks on this website often, because such clarity was rare and highly sought after in the nineteenth century when this beer was discovered by U.S. brewers. It has a foamy, crackly head with inconsistent bubble sizes (I'll count that against its appearance) and little retention and spotty lacing. The smell is grainy and actually had a distinct iced-tea aroma at warmer temperatures. The taste is of pale malts and very moderate sweetness reigned in slightly by noble Saaz hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is clean and bright with a medium length finish and not too much lingering taste. This is a very drinkable beer and should especially be appreciated in terms of the style's impact on brewing in the United States toward the last quarter of the nineteenth century."
"Overall: Good stuff. An excellent representation of a true pilsner style beer."
"Pours a golden yellow with decent carbonation and a nice head that dissipates quickly. Smells and tastes so very well balanced with a smooth finish that leaves one wanting for more. So highly drinkable that after a one bottle sample yesterday, I departed for a case purchase. This is a definite session beer, the one to have when you're having more than one."
"Pours a crystalline straw hue, with a fizzy two and a half finger head. Lacks much retention with an absence of lace. Very aromatic on the pour, the nose exhibits rich pale malt and both floral saaz aroma as well as the classic light-struck scent. Pilsener and pale malt sweetness take charge upfront, followd by a deeply floral and spicy saaz flavor, which gives way to an exsquisite balance. Aftertaste dries, and reveals a mild skunky off-flavor; though not totally inappropriate. Light in body, with a high carbonation, but not overly crisp. The mouthfeel is satisfying yet does not cloy or let imperfection linger like some other Czech pils. Outstanding drinkability, and a sure bet for world class Bohemian Pilsener."
"D- like most pilsners, a very drinkable brew, I'm still fairly new to pilsners, when I first got into good beer I tended to look down on most bottom fermented beverages, but this one (as far as czech pilsners go) is my new favorite for the style, a very good beer"
"D: This isnt bad. It remises me of my dad (and every time he would se a Budweiser commercial he would yell at the TV. and say thats not the original) o the good times needless to say the beer is slightly overrated in but fun anyways"
"Pours a crystal clear dark golden with a thin white head that I hard time making big. It never completely goes away though. Smell was grassy and earthy, with a lot of earthy hops, not too fresh smelling. Taste was quite bitter with some good grainy malt and nuts, not much finish though, just a whisper of Saaz (finally). Mouthfeel was quite soft but a little more watery than expected. This is a good beer, but I've had much better Pilseners."
"Beer is a little nutty, dry straw flavorings, also a mild fruitiness to it, not all that spicy, not overly dry. Quite palatable, I could drink this all the time; I am sure those in the Czech Republic do."
"This is a good example of the Czech pils style."
"Drinkability: The lighter styles of lager get much less respect then they deserve. This won't hit you over the head with flavor, but it is tremendously quaffable and refreshing."
"This is a nice easy to drink, yet flavorful beer. Could easily make a session out of it and while I wouldn't personally rate it exceptional in anything, it's consistently good across the board. It's hard to ask for much else."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle with a best before 08/2007 date. Poured a clear bubbly gold with an inch head. Malty aroma and malty tast. Bitter and dry, very pleasing. Medium bodied and bubbly. A very drinkable beer."
"Pours a perfectly clear, bright amber gold, with a bone white head that kicks up sizably. Aromas of dusty sea air, just-baked bread, and sweetly rising bread dough. Very clean and zesty. On the palate, a flash of zesty bitterness up front followed by sweet malts in the mid-palate. Clean, bone-dry finish. Very clear, salient flavors, with little to get in the way of pure malt and hops notes. Excellent."
"A fine beer and very easy to drink. Not my favorite pils but I thought it was very good."
"Czechvar is a Great Beer. All hail the true Budweiser."
"Overall impression: I've had better, but not many. This is definitely a good standard to measure other pils against. Much better than the bastardized American brand that has stolen the name."
"Mouthfeel was difficult to describe because I found it to be smooth and raspy in the same swallow. Not boring. Nice Czech pils. Easy to return to again and again."
"Czechvar pours a clear golden hue, with frothy foam settling to form a medium head. Smell is average, mild hops and funkiness. Taste is smooth, clean and refreshing. A dry, dusty bubblegum flavor makes an appearance. Hops are present, but not dominant. Pale malt gives it a medium body with nice mouthfeel. Easily sessionable, but not particularly unique. It's worth a try if you are into Czech Pilsners..."
"Poured this into a pilsner glass. Nice deep golden hue with a medium head and medium carbonation. The aroma is slightly fruity and saaz hops. There are hints of the malt and maybe (umalted wheat?), but I'm not sure. The flavor is pure lager delight; malty sweet, not overpowering and crisp hop taste. There is a fruitiness that I've yet had in a pilsner. The body is just right for the style, a little heavier than most pilsners, but the added body seems to come from the amount of malt used. I would say that I would take this before almost any other Czech lager to date."
"Overall - A pretty good pilsener - nothing spectacular but worth a try..."
"M&D: quite clean, but lacks a crisp texture crucial to this beer... a slightly clashing, doughy and rusty mouthfeel of malt-sourness linger in the very end. Quaffable enough and much better than the bottled version that I tried 9 months ago, but nowhere nearly as good as what I tried in Ceske Budejovice, the beer's home town. I'm SURE it's not due to ""psychological effects"". Even being a filtered and perhaps pasteurised beer dispensed with CO2, the beer I had on tap in Budejovice was better in terms of body and texture, alas I didn't take any notes whilest there... giving me another excuse to re-visit the Pilsner-land soon!!"
"Crystal clear yellow body with a white head. The smell was pretty crisp it had a nice floral hops aroma and that was about it. The taste of the beer was like the aroma at first. Then something happened. I started to get a soapy taste from it. I'm all for different tastes but I couldn't like that. The feel of the beer was rather water and thin with a nice dry finish. It was a nice beer and refreshing for a hot summer day."
"Because of the green glass and delicate nature of the beer, you really have to have this brought back from the homeland to enjoy it properly. I've had a few bottles of the US Czechvar, and extended travel doesn't suit this one. A great, classic beer. What most bottles of beer want to be. Timeless stuff. It's certainly no flavor bomb, but what it lacks in complexity it makes up in subtlety and refinement. This is what pilsner beer is all about."
"Very drinkable. If you're looking for a good pils, try this one."
"Hop flavour hits upfront followed by a light yet rich and complex malt profile again including a faint hint of caramel. Malt and hops well in balance, bitterness is present but smooth. Good body and a clean finish, an excellent beer and a premier example of the style."
"It's been awhile since I've had an Urquell for comparison, but this is mighty tasty! Been waiting to try this since the store got it in again. Pours a beautiful golden color with a surprisingly small, short lived head. I shall pour more aggressively next time! The smell is what a lager should smell like. Hoppy, floral, and slightly sweet. This is awesome, then again, this IS my favorite style of beer...The taste is no let down either. Refreshing, hoppy (not hophead hoppy though), and smooth. Reminiscent of an IPA almost. Hoppy aftertaste. The mouthfeel is sorta watery, then again, this is a lager, but it is very smooth and the carbonation is just right. 4's across the board, but thats because thats what I gave my fav the Urquell! The drinkability is great. Not too harsh, and not too macro-lager like. A very well done bier. Cheers to the Czech's!"
"This is super smooth. A very enjoyable pilsner. I might grab a couple of sixers of this for those times when I feel like something light or for macro drinking friends. Seems like a perfect lawnmower beer. I think I prefer the Victory Prima Pils, but I'll drink some more of this."
"Well I am happy to say that I am drinking the original Budejovicky/Budwar/Budweiser. I am not drinking the imported Czechvar. It has a nice caramel color to it, it just looks refreshing. It doesn't have much of a smell, and the taste is fairly simple as well, but with a nice roundness to the body, and a fairly clean finish. You get hops in the after taste, which lingers a little. It's an experience to have had it, but I don't see myself dieing to try it again."
"A healthy pour yields a nice barely off white 1 inch head that falls quickly down to a ring. The liquid is dark yellow, and perfectly transparent. Nose is rich and earthy, smells of grain and noble hops (Saaz?). Taste is of initial hoppy bitterness, with a sweet middle, leading to a dry, unique aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium-thin, and quite right for the style. I've never tasted a Pils quite like this - and I like it! Eminently drinkable!"
"Ive had this beer quite a lot, and it remains a personal favorite. The bottle comes in a nice green color, covered at the top in a lovely golden foil. The appearance is similar to most Czech Pilsners. It has a nice golden color with a large white head with moderate lacing. The hoppy smell is a bit better than most Pilsners. The taste, drinkability, and mouthfeel is very good. It is a bit expensive, but worth the price. Overall, a good Czech Pilsner which is far better than most pilsners."
"D - Quite drinkable, even though I'm not a lager fan. When American macros fashioned themselves after this it seems they forgot to retain what flavor the original had."
"The original Budweiser. A great Czech Pilsner. Although not my favorite one, this is [relatively] widely available. Definitely something that everyone should try. I'll continue to get this from time to time as I've been doing for a while."
"Taste is smooth bready maltiness upfront with a fairly pronounced hop finish. Pleasant quenching mouthfeel. Tastes like it would be pretty versatile for matching with foods. Quite drinkable."
"Wanting to try this for a while. Light golden straw with a foam head that fades fast. Smells of light spicy hopping and pale bready malts. Great taste, slightly bready, macro like, but flavorful. Strong aftertaste, with full on carbonation. Appealing. A common theme among pilsners I've tasted of late - slightly unfresh tasting and a little bit of alcohol? Maybe this is the yeast... Mouthfeel is light but not too watery, carbonation is full on. Drinkability is good and I could recommend this to macro drinkers. A lovable pilsner is a special thing, but hard to find. Glad I tried it though."
"This is what B-M-C should aspire to. A nice, light refereshing beer that starts out with a large white head, an aroma and an actual taste!!! The head fades slowly into a covering over the top of the glass. There is some lacing as well. The color is a slightly deeper ""lager yellow"". The aroma and taste is very mildly hops. The taste is strong enough to get your attention with slight hops bitterness. The finish is dry. Mouthfeel is what I would expect from a lager or pilsner. Drinkability is good. I held off from using it as a lawnmower beer today so I could enjoy it. This beer is highly sessionable, would be good with food or for mass quantities. A nicely balanced, well made beer. I will add this to my list for summer."
"D- pretty drinkable"
"Czechvar pours a golden yellow with a fluffy white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. A mild hoppy aroma is present. Taste has some grain and some grass flavors. Definitely hoppy as well. Definitely different from the American namesake. Worth a try, if for no other reason, it's the original Budweiser."
"One of the best lagers in the world, a true classic. Looks great, has a fine aroma and delicious taste. Nice on the tap, too, but outside Czech Republic is available mostly in the bottled form. The only problem is that BB beers from the same town of Ceske Budejovice are even better. Heartily recommended!"
"Pours a nice gold colour with a head that vanishes to nothing in seconds. It has a nice crisp edge to the mouthfeel.it has a nice present malt taste that is almost smoky but it tastes very clean. This is a pleasant surprise and a great beer for on a hot summer evening. If i had known it was this nice I would have bought two."
"Insanely drinkable. I am thoroughly enjoying drinking this one in a huge biergarten in Austria. This beauty blows its American counterpart out of the water."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is light bodied. The carbonation contributes to a good beer drinking experience. This is a very drinkable and enjoyable beer."
"(it must be noted, that, my review of this beer is a bit skewed given the sentimentality of my tastings. i haven't found this beer anywhere anytime since, and most likely, upon another tasting, would have different perspectives influencing my review.)_"
"Pours a dull Blonde/Gold color with a nice frothy white head and plenty of sticky lace. The distinctive Saaz Euro-hop aroma awakens the senses upon pouring. The Light/Medium sweet biscuity malt compliments the crisp spicy and somewhat metallic hop bitterness. Clean and dry finish(maybe a bit too dry). This is a nice, easy-drinking brew. Well done!"
"The beer empties from the 12-ounce green bottle a clear light gold color with a modest semi-creamy bright white head that disappears leaving a thin coating of lace to conceal the glass. Nose is sweet malt, crisp and clean, start is sweet with a fair to middling grain presence, the top light in feel to the palate. Finish is moderate in its acidity, the hops standard for the style, quite dry linger aftertaste, a nice clean refreshing beer."
"Light to medium in body with an ABV of 5%, you could drink this stuff all day long, if you like this style. Nice break from the heavyweight brews I normally consume...cheers!"
"I prefer to think of it as Budvar, the original Budweiser Beer if you havent tried the real deal yet, you must. An archetypal Bohemian Pilsner, Czechvar is what it must be called in the US cmon AB, your beer doesnt come from Budweis."
"Solid drinkability level too. An excellent warm weather session type of beer. A very solid Czech Pilsner."
"Opinion: This is a really good beer, and I am happy that I got a fresh example that hasn't been sitting in the sunlight for days. There is a pretty significant hoppiness, but this compliments the malt complexity. It is nice to drink a beer that looks lighter yet has depth in the malt. I would definitely recommend this beer, and I will be drinking it again I'm sure."
"Poured golden with a fluffy inch plus of head. Smells slightly grainy along with a smidge of citrus hops. Taste starts slightly bitter/citrus hops and is followed by mellow malt. The mouth is gently carbonated. Very drinkable. A night spent drinking this on tap would be fine for me. A nice session beer."
"Taste is nice clean cracker malt with slight earthy, sulphur, bitter hoppyness. Awesome example of original Bohemian style. Awesomely crisp with a nice malty flavor. Very drinkable, wish they came in 12 packs."
"Poured a nice gold color with a quick fading head. Smells like your typical pilsner and does resemble the American version. Taste is similar but quite a bit fuller with hints of hops and a malty finish. Very smooth and quite good for a pilsner. I am by no means a fan of pilsners but this is the best one I have had to date. Very well balanced and easy to drink. I can certainly see why this beer was ""mimicked"" here in America."
"I had this on tap a few times when I was in Prague last spring. I've had it on can and bottle too but it's actually a lot better on tap. It looks real nice with its golden yellow color and a thick but quickly fading head. Smells like a normal pils, malty and a little metallic. The taste it quite sweet but with a good hop-flavor to balance it. Bigger body than the average pils, probably the sweetness. Very drinkable. This is my favourite among the Czech pilseners so far."
"Mouthfeel is very coating and smooth. Nice big body, quite superior to macro 'pilsners'. Bit of a hop kick upfront, well balanced middle, and slightly malty aftertaste. Mild fruity notes."
"This beer poured a nice golden yellow with two fingers of white head. There was a lot of a carbonation too, nice looking beer. It smells kind of tangy and hoppy, a bit of sweetness too. Good crisp, clean taste, a bit sweet but not overly so, the hops are present too. Good mouthfeel, not too much carbonation, and its quite smooth. This is a very drinkable beer, apart from the fact that you can't get it here (mine was a real bottle my parents brought back from Europe, not the Czechvar sold here)."
"D - Not bad. A big step above most of the crappy euro-pils/lager crowd."
"Mouthfeel- Light, clean, crisp, and ummm refreshing. This is the beer of the Czech proliteriat and any real true beer aficionado."
"This is a good looking Pilsner, pale gold, lots of carbonation, classic for the style. I had a couple of these, I've never seen it in Manitoba before. Smell is all noble hops and bready malts. Very clean looking and tasting, pretty well balanced brew. Good bite in the mouth and goes down pretty smooth. This isn't very exciting, but it sticks to the style very well, and makes for a good session beer."
"Tastey, but not transcendental. Like that really hot girl at the bar who looks amazing 'til she opens her mouth. Ahhh well, we can't all be perfect."
"Pours like an average pils, yellow, fizzy and quick subsiding head with almost no lacing. Smells a little metallic with skunky undertones. Taste is clean, with hints of grain and a subtle hops bitterness, not excessive. quite nice overall. Mouthfeel is good, the aftertaste is minimal. Very drinkable. Overall not a bad example of a Czech Pilsener. Quite Refreshing."
"1 pint 9 oz. Czechvar bottle received from Zorro in BCG BIF. A best by date of 11/2006 is printed on the reverse label."
"The non-skunked taste was a nice mild malt, citrus, grass and hops. Nice summer brew, or easy sipping."
"D - Pretty good. I always wondered whether this beer was a good beer, or simply better than A-B's Budweiser. I appears to fall somewhere between the two. All things considered, a rather enjoyable brew, certainly good to session and good with foods."
"Crisp flavor. Lots of grain and sweet with near zero hop bitterness."
"This is a good, clean, Czech pilsner. I am a little surprised by the sweetness, but the spicy hop character is there, and makes this a very quaffable brew. I would definitely have this again."
"Verdict- A fine middle-of-the-road pilsner. The malt character sets it apart from other mainstream European lagers."
"This beer was one of my first attempts at something other than the big three. While stationed in western Germany near the Luxembourg border this brew could be found rather easily on tap or in bottles. Cheap as well which is nice for an E-4. Alot of my friends thought it odd that I drank this regularly at bbq's and whatnot...absolutely loved it. Times have changed and the journey this fine brew takes to get to the west coast of the good 'ol USA takes its toll. I remember it being a brew that really knocked my socks off so to speak. Amazingly crisp and refreshing. Light but packed full of hoppy goodness. Now, (insert endless possibilities here) for whatever reason it seems to have lost that crispness that I loved about it. Hops are spicey but alot less lively than I recall. buttery at times. Its pretty good by all means just not one that I'll go out of my way for. When I'm in europe I'd love to try this again but for now the journey is too long to get to my doorstep for such a delicate brew."
"i think this is my favorite of the Czech lagers i've tried so far."
"Definitely worth a try, especially on a warm summer day."
"So, here are the secrets: (1) only buy closed cases, or, if buying less than a case, from a closed case, as it gets light struck easily; (2) the cases, but not the six packs or bottles have a best before date - the beer is as described above during the last three months preceeding the best before date and about one month after - too early and it's a bit coarse, too late and the hops don't properly balance it; (3) only buy from retailers who care about their stock and have not kept it somewhere warm; and (4) don't buy it in the summer, unless you know your distributor and retailer keep things at the proper temperature as it heat damages easily. A PITA? Yep, but well worth the effort in my book, and much cheaper than a trip to the Czech Republic (no matter how lovely that would be . . .)."
"Here it is, the beer Busch's flagship was named after. Can't believe its mostly famous for that reason, as this is a very good beer in its own right. Appearance is very light when it pours, but when you let it settle, it is a very clear amber rather than the bright yellow typical of American versions of this style. The head is bright white, rather small, and shortlived. Smell is ok but not very strong. Its clean and almost like ginger ale. The taste is something I've never quite experienced before. Its delicate, subtle, but still not boring. It starts out sweet, with a definate suggestion of lemon, then gets a little malty, and ends with a bitter hop bite that is a tiny bit metallic. Mouthfeel is fine. Is probably a bit thin, but every aspect of this beer fits together perfectly, so I won't complain and I doubt many other people do either. Drinkability is great. I had two and you could definately drink this all night. It would be hard to rate this beer too high. There are other beers I've enjoyed more (mostly cheaper and easier to find too), but within its style Budvar (Czechvar in America since after a very long legal battle Busch has successfully prevented the actual Budwieser from selling its product under its own name) is without a doubt the best beer I have ever had. I have never had a better or more enjoyable beer in the pilsner or ""pale lager"" category. Before Budvar, the pale lager I gave the best rating to was a light beer (Amstel Light). I was starting to wonder if this type of beer was worthwhile at all. Clearly if its done well enough, it is. This is a must try for anyone who's a fan of Pilsners or Pale Lagers (This means American Macro drinkers too). And this would be a great beer anytime you wanted to knock back a few of something pleasant and easy to drink. Even though Urquell is supposed to have done it first, I think this is the beer that defines pilsner. How good is this? I drink Amber/Red lager not pale lagers. When I drink lager I mostly prefer Americans to imports. And this is 8 Bucks for a sixpack vs about 5 for my favorite beer. But I'd still buy it again (though not every day). Come to think of it, the ability of the brewery to get this to market fresh is mind boggling. Its shipped from Central Europe, its in a green bottle, it can't be have that high a turnover, yet this is as fresh as anything I've had from New York or Pennsylvannia if not fresher. Bottom line: if you like pale lagers, try this at your next oppertunity. You won't be sorry. Especially if your pale lager of choice is Busch's ""Budwieser"". They don't just share a name, having tried the real thing, I think Busch did try to copy this beer. But their recipe is the mutant bastard spawn of this beer."
"Gold in colour and strongly carbonated. Classic saaz hop, sulfur, and light malt aromas... with perhaps a slightly greater leaning towards the malt than other Bohemian pilsners that Ive tried. Flavor wise, the pilsner malt is quite strong upfront, but the hops take over big time on the back end with lots of grassy flavors and coarse bitterness. Not quite as polished as a non-skunked Urquell, but still pretty good."
"First of all, drank ton of this in Prague last year but I am reviewing based on today's tasting (which of course is not nearly as fresh as from the source). This is a great pilsner any way you look at it. A bit more heavy bodied than some Czech and Euro pilsners. Color is like rich yellow gold -- not as pale as other lagers. Aroma is of dried berries and hay. This is a medium hopped lager (look into Pilsner Urquel for a hoppier czech pils) that is perhaps more balanced than most. However, there is an evident spicy hop bite in every sip."
"Easy drinking, but like many lagers, I find it a bit too fizzy. Still, a good, refreshing lager and easily superior to the A-B Bud."
"Very drinkable. A great beer for any time of the year and a nice one to explore pilsners with."
"A must for anyone who wants to find out what macro ninny is supposed to taste like."
"This is a solid AVERAGE brew. Yes I said average. There are better of the style out there."
"Bottle: Poured a golden color pils with a huge foamy head with limited retention. Aroma of grass and floral malt. Taste also include the grass and floral malt and as well as crisp hops thought I was expecting more hops. Body is fuller then expected. Very enjoyable though it seems I could feel that the bottle had travelled a couple thousand miles."
"Light spicy hops and a sweet, but not overly so malt base. Light, crisp and refreshing, but still tasty. The one bottle I picked up certainly wasn't enough. Everything american macros profess to be but aren't."
"Pours a heavy gold color with a big head that quickly fades. Smells doughy for a lager and has a startling citrus sensation (not smell) in the nose. What strikes me about this beer is that its malty and has a touch of hops, a combination I would normally expect from an ale. The flavors run together well and finish with a nice citrus transition. The mouth feels is nothing special with ample body and a light carbonation. Over all, its a solid beer."
"AB can only dream of producing something this good. Poured out to a nice golden yellow color with a 1/4 inch of head and minor notes of lace in the glass. Medium high level of carbonation. Aroma was light yet complex, with odors of hops, cooked grain and a touch of sweetness toward the end. Flavor was straightforward and very quaffable; grain, malt, hops, herbs and minor sweetness blended well, with a hint of bitterness at the finish. Very nice. Mouthfeel was accented by good carbonation, but remained tame and light. A good level of drinkability. This is the true Budweiser. Recommended."
"Nice beer this Czechvar Premium Chech Lager, it might even catch on here in the States..."
"$2.99 for a 1pt 9oz bottle at OUAV."
"D: Very drinkable."
"Drinkability: There is no way that BMC drinker could say no to this. Superior to any macro. A very well done beer, one I would recommend, but... I purchased this bottle to give it a try. I have seen this in a lot of places recently (even grocery stores, so word is getting out) the only thing that to me is a drawback is the price. The cheapest I have ever seen this is $8.37 for a warm 6-pack when it first came out. I usually see it in the $9-10 range, which for me is too pricey. Still, a very good beer, I may get another single someday and I'd recommend it."
"A good one  better than Pilsner Urquel my book  but more expensive and harder to get. Crystal clear deep gold pour, fast dying head. A hint of euro skunk in the aroma, but that also quickly dissipated. Sweet, rich and malty flavor  well blanced with the hops. Crisp and tangy, well carbonated. Yep, a good pilsner only had a bomber but could have drunk a few more!"
"Review made from notes."
"I would drink a couple of these in a push, but not if there was a choice."
"A most enjoyable brew and definantly my new Pils of choice. This bad boy poured a nice copper color with a decent white head that faded quickly and did not leave much lace. The smell was quite fruity and malty with hardley any hint of hops. The taste was very fresh and smoothe with a very light airy maltiness to it and a great light hop flavor to round it out. The beer was very drinkable and would be a excelent warm weather brew. Try this one for sure!"
"I wish AB would make something that could be a pimple on the ass of this beer!"
"Drinkability: It's OK, but I prefer a pilsner with a bit more of a hops presence"
"Czeckvar is light-bodied with a clean dry finish. It is well carbonated. The drinkability is decent, but there is just not much to this beer."
"Mouthfeel is also light."
"On tap, though, the taste was a a completely different story. The malt was allowed to shine through while the hops balanced off and cleaned up the experience by leaving the kind of crisp aftertaste that you want on a hot day of touring. It was a sensual pleasure."
"This beer pours a clear straw color with a white head that fizzled away after a minute or two. The aroma was good. Very floral nose on this one. The taste was crisp with with some sweetness. It has some skunk to it but not in a bad ""my beer is skunky"" kind of way. It could be the nose playing some silly tricks on my taste buds. The mouthfeel is pretty lacking. Light body with low carbonation. It's an average drinking beer. Not bad but it didn't knock my socks off."
"Remember when you're drinking it from a bottle, it's not at its very best, and if you're buying it in the States it's already come a long way and is probably not that fresh."
"Really an alluring golden color, very concentrated, like apple cider. Smells faintly sweet and a little like a botanical garden. Taste is very crisp and refreshing, but rather unbalanced, tending toward the sweet. Yet another very beer that's very easy to drink, but without any outstanding characteristics. Well, that may be a slight overstatement. It does have an oddly-shaped bottle out of which I have yet to master the pour--glug, glug, glug."
"Budweiser's grand daddy. Looks light straw in color with high carbonation and a lofty head that clings to the glass. Smells lightly vegetable like and mildly hoppy, contributing sour notes. Tastes sweet corn like, mildly malty, mildly grassy and a bit yeasty. Light bodied and easy drinking. Creamy, yet cut by the carbonation. Fresh tasting and crisp."
"Pours a nice clear gold, lots of tight white head forms, laces well on the glass. Smells crisp, malts and mild skunkiness. Taste is sweet and malty, mild bitterness and a dry finish. Finish is spicy as well. Mild skunkiness, medium bodied and with tight carbonation, a better than average beer for a hot day."
"This is easily one of the best European pilsners I've ever had. I wouldn't exactly call it a must-drink beer, but it's worth a shot."
"D-This is a very light yet smooth beer. It was mostly a single hop flavor and I would like to see a little more complexity in either hops or malt. This beer is not that interesting but could be a ""thirst-quencher"""
"This beer is very drinkable for the first half of the pint. The flavor decayed much quicker than I liked and makes me think this beer could overstay it's welcome very quick. Probably would have been better had I a real Pils glass..."
"this is definitely a proto-type pils. very true to style (this one helped define the style) and a must try for historical reasons. pours a 1.5 finger tight foamy head but dissipates quickly. not as much lacing as expected. light yellow and very clear. smell a light sweet malt in background along with grainy aroma. taste starts with a hint of sweet and quickly goes dry and spicy which dominates the aftertaste as well. real good pilsner. i would definitely choose this one over a lone star but there are plenty of bocks, dopplebocks, and ales that i would reach for first."
"Poured into my over-sized pilsner glass, fits perfectly. The body is light gold with a feathery yet substantial head. The head has good retention that leaves some sudsy patches on the glass. Smell: Lemon zest and sourdough, some green apple hints -- simple and sturdy (full). Taste: Opens with a zesty prick of hops; the middle is a slighty sour green apple, with a finish of taut hop bitterness backed by a mellow buttery malt sweetness. Not much happening, really. Decent. The taste doesn't hold up the promise of the nose. Mouthfeel: A little thin, but nothing to complain about. Well carbonated."
"Nearly perfect mouthfeel and body mixing with the flavors with a supreme creamyness and light corn-edged sweetness along with slight bready tones. Very nice drinker here. I quite liked it. Clean, simple, delicate, and accommodating. Serve at a warmer temp and not ice cold. Much, much, better that way."
"Overall: A bit malty for me, it's a good pilsner, but I can never see myself picking this one up over other better examples of the style."
"Had a cold 500 ml bottle of this on a hot Tuscan afternoon, sitting on the patio, overlooking the Chianti hillsides. Bright, clear, sparkling golden body with a small, tight, white head. Honey biscuit malt aromas and fresh barley backed by zesty, spicy hops. Taste is clean, lightly sweetened malts with a touch of cooked veggies. Spicy, tasty hops come in and provide thirst-quenching bitterness. Finish is long and clean. LIght bodied with refreshing, sparkling carbonation."
"Much better than the Urquell, anyway. Just nothing that I'm going to seek out to buy again."
"This is a tough one... I am not a big fan of pilseners. BUT I have to review it based on style, not on personal preferences. Tough to make yourself do that. On that basis, it was a pretty decent pilsener."
"Not overly carbonated. Pretty much your standard average beer."
"Pours a light copper color with a tiny creamy white head. Ample carbonation. Smells sweet, with a faint herbal hop presence. Taste is faint and a little toward the sweet side. Still, it is fairly well balance with some herbal hop taste. The aftertaste is sweet. The taste would be good if it weren't so faint. The mouthfeel is light with nice carbonation. This beer is very easy to drink with its light flavor and body. Overall, I believe most American macro drinkers would believe this to be the woulds gratest beer, because the flavor is far better than the Bud they drink. I, on the other hand, know pilsners can taste a lot better than this one does."
"A good pilsner, and, without looking, I'd guess it's the best of what I've reviewed. I don't think you have to be a fan of the style to enjoy this beer. It's good. Try some."
"The flavor has a light hop hit at the front with a gentle butter diacetyl. The hop taste fades, walking a gentle balance with the malt. The slick and effervescent mouthfeel makes the beer go down quite smoothly."
"well, a pretty darn good czech pils. just missing that bit of spiciness which could have added more depth? perhaps?"
"Fairly skunky presence at first, of course I should attribute that to the bottle date of 9-03 on it. A bit of a cidery twang and a high diactely taste. It was great to finally find this but I attribute most of the faults with the age and probable improper storage methods before I found it. Looking forward to finding a better vintage to give this a better shot."
"12 ounce, brown bottle, comes with best before dating. Pours very light almond and clear. Nose is moderatly grassy with a wiff of cabbadge. White head, minimal lacing left on the glass. Light bodied, minimal flavor also observed. Grassy lager, not much going on here, need more hoppy bite/crispness. Middle of the road macro/lager."
"The mouthfeel was a bit lacking, but it is one of the 'cleanest' styles of beer out there. While it may be perfect for the style, I tend to like something a little more full bodied or at least containing a tiny bit of miscellaneous sedimentary shit. That being said, this would make an excellent session brew for the masses. If you are ever planning on hosting a huge party and you want an easily accessible brew for the masses while at the same time providing a conversational piece to satisfy your inner BA about how scandalous it is that budvar must be called czechvar in the US... this would be your beer. Hell, try it anyway. It's one pils that is totally worth your while. Next mission: try the Pilsener-Urquell (sp?)."
"I paid $4.99 for a 6-pack"
"This drink is quite consumable even when a year past its best before date - no souring of the malt. I typically prefer the golden beers in the warmer months, so I'm hoping to get another shot at this beer in the near future."
"Came in Half Liter can, direct from the Czech Repubic(via my friend). Poured yellow, with a fluffy white foam head. Smell was pretty much clean, but not unpleasent. The taste was smooth and malty, with grain protruding. Felt good in mouth, and was exceptionally refreshing. Top notch beer."
"Another decent pils! I've been on a pils roll as of recent. Light yellow pour with huge bubbles that leave good webs of lacing. Sweet malt scents as well as tastes. Very crisp and somewhat dry, but overall a decent pils. Excellent thirst quencher."
"Where's the lawnmower when you need it? Great for slaking a thirst."
"""Enjoy your fright."""
"I've never had a Czech lager before, and the difference between it and American macro lagers is very evident. This is a great example of what a real pilsener is, and how much it has been corrupted by megabreweries throughout the world."
"Taste: Not very malty, but the herbal hop finish has just enough bite to make you come back for more. Light mouthfeel, but still refreshing and enjoyable, when you're in a lager mood, which happens to me from time to time."
"Yeah. Nice. Quite enjoyable. I could drink a fair few of these happily."
"Comments - I stronly suspect I got a beer that was not fresh. I am also not a big pilsner fan, but the particular beer I got was disappointing."
"Had this at a beer tasting recently. Pours a slightly golden color with a small head that dies off quickly and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma has a grainy character with a slight hoppiness. The flavor is very smooth with some slight caramel malts and a bitterness from the hops. I'm thinking Saaz. Has a very nice body and drinkability is really good."
"This beer is the ultimate session lager, its rich yet soft and understated. Its more malt accented than Pilsner Urquell, with a more delicate hop character. It exceeded my expectations, I cant believe I didnt try this earlier."
"The smell was fairly weak but still appealing. The taste is somewhat light but not without flavor. Spicey hops take the finish after a few good notes from light malts. It feels good in the mouth and it is very drinkable."
"note: I came back and upped this beer's scores due to my appreciation of what they brought to the style, a style which I have been unimpressed with so far."
"Taste is simply outstanding. Simple and straightfoward mild mixture of malt and hops. Nothing complicated or complex about it, but very tasty and refreshing."
"Overall: A very nice and refreshing lager. The aftertaste is just a little too sweet."
"This bottle is marked ""Budweiser"" and comes from a friend of mine's wife who works at the UN. At $14 a case of 24, quite a good deal for them! Clean, crisp taste. Very carbonated, but a lot better than American Bud. Good white head, sort of yellow in color. Decent hoppy flavor, but lots of malt flavors as well. The more I drink of these, the more I like them."
"From a tall, skinny bottle with gold foil, it pours a nice yellow-gold. The head is bubbly white but doesn't last long. Just the smell of a decent Czech Pilsener is an instant reminder of how badly the big breweries around the world have butchered the style. Are those hops? The taste is crisp and hop bitterness just tags the tongue. Mouthfeel is in line with most pilseners, and it's quite a quaffer."
" Way better than the beer that hijacked this brewerys name."
"Other comments: This and PU are definitely the most supreme of the Czech Pilseners (barring any strictly local ones that the rest of us can't try). Budvar uses brown bottles (at least in Europe), so that's definitely a plus over PU."
"It is possible I've just got a bad bottle, but beyond the initial smell (which went away) it didn't act like a skunked beer. I just couldn't get into it. Maybe I'll try it again someday and see if I can get along with it better."
"A very mild pils with a soft mouthfeel and easy drinkability. Not really standout but not bad either. Thank to Jeni for bringing this over from the Czech Republic."
"This one pours a very transparent pale golden yellow color without much head that falls to not even cover the beer. There is a steady stream of bubbles coming up from the bottom of this one. The nose is light and sweet malts, without much hop to speak of. I would have liked a hint of bitter in there. The flavor is sweet to start, with a bit of a hop finish. I would still like a bit more hop on this one. This beer is fairly thin without much substance to it, but that is expected. I could see drinking a few of these on a summer day. Its good but just not my style. Lagers and I don't get along well."
"Pours a light golden color protected by a 2 finger white head that disapates fairly quickly leaving only a small ring around the glass. Aroma is faint but has a little bit of spiciness. No malt reaches the nose. Taste is very clean and has a nice saaz kick. A really nice balanced finish. Mouthfeel isn't overly thin. A pretty decent Pils overall. I'd definetely buy again, but there are better options out there."
"Drinkability  This isnt bad. It is so difficult to find a good, widely-available Czech Pilsner that Ill give this a cautious recommendation."
"Not merely ""golden," this is a rich, earthy maize color with a nice, frothy head that sticks to the glass. It's immediately obvious that this is a heartier version than American consumers are used to. As expected, there's little to speak of for aroma -- plant-like Euro-hop aroma, malty sweetness. Fairly big bodied brew for the style. Lemongrass herbal tea. Bready and thick feeling. A sweet but crisp malt beverage -- plain and simple. Clean, crisp, refreshing. Nice hop bite at the end. An old school pilsner's pilsner."
"12 oz. green bottle. Pours a typical golden pils color with a white head, leaving minimal lacing behind. Lighter grassy, botanical hoppy notes, and faintly malty. Smells clean and unobtrusive. Taste is rather neutral, there's enough maltiness and hoppiness to counterbalance each other, resulting in a brew that's enjoyable to drink, without taxation of the senses. I do recall liking this beer more out of the half liter brown bottles, though. It's shining point is its crispness, palatability and ease in enjoyment."
"A good lager from the Czech Republic that is worth trying. Although pilseners aren't my favorite style, I really like a nice easy to drink beer on a warm day."
"I really enjoyed this beer. Golden yellow in colour and as clear as it needs to be. Crisp maltiness with just the right amount of hoppiness makes this a great pilsener to drink just about any time. I see myself buying a lot of this in the near future."
"Budweiser is actually trying to say people might confuse this with their beer? I highly doubt it!"
"IMHO: A good representation of the style. Somewhat one-dimensional. Refreshing cold, but lost it?s appeal as it warmed."
"There is nothing wrong with Czechvar and it is certainly better than many mainstream American lagers. If you're looking for a nice lager Czechvar is a good choice."
"So Czechvar is the *real* Budweiser, huh? It's pretty decent beer, all things considered. It's clean, refreshing and quaffable. In other words, everything the American Budweiser isn't. I'd have to classify this one as a pleasant surprise."
"ng"
"Had this on tap at Chauncey Smith, in draft, in fall of 2009. It was better in smell, taste, mouthfeel, and that is the basis of my rating."
"Not too shabby. Personally I never really find too much to say about Pilsners but this one actually has some character to it. Nice malty taste and golden color. The head quickly disappeared but on a hot day, it really didn't matter. As far as Czech Pilsners go, I really think this is one of the better ones."
"It pours a pale straw color and is crystal clear with a big, fluffy head. I am drinking a Budwesier yet there is no corn in the aroma instead it has a gentle graininess and some delicate flowery hops. The light body has some sweet grain. I can't believe the fresh hoppiness of Bud. Wait, wrong Bud....this is a great change of pace to the American macro. It has a nice bitter finish and is quite refreshing. Definitely great when had fresh as opposed to an imported bottle."
"Nice, classic pilsner"
"Clear golden yellow with a thin white head that mostly disappeared rather quickly, but left bits of lace on the glass. Strong aroma of noble hops, quite crisp. Medium bodied with fairly high carbonation. Hop bitterness shines through from beginning to end, with some spiciness at the finish. Smooth and well-balanced with a nice finish."
"Luminous clear medium gold color, pale head settles to a skim in 40 seconds, streams of upcharging bubbles. Laces in small strings. Good aroma, flour-like and dry with a dry hop sense -- a little nose prickle. Medium carbonation, lightish mouthfeel with a husky and barely nutty malt impression. Tight in profile, good transition from grain hulls to bitter pepper-like hops which are this beer's best feature. Rounds out with a reduced sense of what's happening mid mouth, overall a decently delicate close. Pretty good beer, nice balance and a drinkable quality. The malts seemed slightly on the stale side throughout the glass."
"Overall I am glad I tried this beer, its easy to drink, and flavorful , though its quite pricey for what it is in my opinion, but a good beer either way."
"Clean and crisp, very refreshing. Glad I bought a few of these. Tastes more like a good pils than a lager, but what's the difference anyway? A nice summer brew to quench your thirst with a flavorful and well balanced, European classic."
"pours clear and golden, lets out a grainy lightly hopped nose. crisp in the mouth with lively carbonation, full flavored, lightly sweet with a spicy hop zest. ive been waiting to try the ""real"" bud for awhile, no let downs as this is a real lager, it goes great with anything and its a solid brew for sure."
"I was excited to see this at the little kiosk. Seeing the bottle, I knew I had to try the original Bud. Pours a crisp, autumn gold. Bit of a leaf colour, perhaps an oak tree in October. One and a half finger head, leaving slights amount of lace on the glass. Alot of carbonated bubbles rising to the top. Smells light. Bit of bittering & citrus hop, malt, bread, sweet. Simple. Tastes pretty good. Their is a light sweetness at first, which coats the tongue. At the midway point, a bit of a citrus bite. Aftertaste is pleasantly bitter. Crisp, carbonated mouthfeel. Refreshing, though it does cause for a bit of gas. Good, drinkable, thirst quenching lager that's good simple enough to enjoy like a session beer, but has enough pieces to be analyzed occasionally."
"Average appearance with lager like behavior. Aroma is floral and grassy and sweet...good malt backbone. Taste is initially tangy and green with a building sweetness that almost goes too far before mellowing out into a fruity twist at the finish. Little to no bite from the hops but plenty of flavor. Mouthfeel is refreshing and spot-on for the style. Drinkability is huge."
"D&N: This beer seems more hype than anything. Flavors and aromas are thin and weak. Not anything impressive."
"Medium-sized, coarse, foamy, white head on top of clear, full gold beer. Tonsa carbo. Nice. Huge schpoonck in the nose: also nice. Like old-time beer. A sourish front gives way to a fruity middle. Sweetens in the finish with corn and toast. Turns suddenly quite bitter. I like this. It's quite fruity and toasty-grainsy. Plenty of taste."
"Pours a clear golden with a 1/2 inch head... has excellent head retention. Aroma of sweet malt and a touch of noble hops. Flavor begins sweet, with some bread and cracker notes, then finishes with just enough bitterness to add some balance. Mouthfeel is clean and crisp, with medium carbonation. This a very good session / lawnmower beer, subtle and tasty. That being said, it might be a tad overhyped."
"Indeed, in the mouth the beer is thick and creamy. Taste is strong on caramel with fresh apple aftertaste on the palate. Like a buttery cider--or a caramel-covered apple. Little hops to speak of, clean finish. Damn enjoyable beer to drink!"
"If pilsner is your thing, this is where its at. My lawnmower beer of choice."
"Not as good as reputation holds, but still a servicable brew. Doesn't warm particularly well. Malty version of style."
"12oz. bottle poured into a pilsener glass. It pours a light golden color with three fingers of head. There is lots of chunky lacing left on the glass. The smell is very grassy, with a little bit of malts and hops present. The taste is a little malty at first, with some sweetness to it. A grassy hop bite rounds out the finish, creating beautiful balance. The taste is fairly thick for a pilsener, and sooo crisp and smooth. The drinkability is fantasic, better than almost any other beer, even for the style. This is the lager upon which all other lagers should be judged. I wish all lagers were this good!"
"Drinkability: This is a great session beer. I would be hard pressed to grow tired of this one."
"If you walk from the Muzeum metro stop down Václavské street in Prague, you'll notice two huge brewery logos on one of the buildings on the right: Pilsner Urquell and Budweiser, the two titans of Czech brewing. Busweiser is probably more famous among the beer community for its fight with AB in the U.S., which is fairly ridiculous. While the brewery deserves support, it's a shame that this beer is so average. Even straight from the source, a mediocre to average pilsner, not really worth tracking down. If you're in the Czech Republic, try Pilsner Urquell on tap instead."
"A very pale yellow golden color; the head is foamy and fades into a very thin collar, or more exactly, it disappears. The smell is grainy, malty, almost roasted. The taste was very enjoyable, grainy and malty with a thin caramel aspect, slightly iodated, with citrus and floral hops. Malts and hops are harmoniously combined. The mouthfeel is very round, with a long lasting hoppy finish. In comparison with Pilsner Urquell, I find Budvar much better and much more drinkable."
"Not a holy grail; while it towers over generic Euro lagers its rather unappealing with its admission price. But money I spend with pleasure knowing i'm giving money to the David to American Budweiser's Goliath."
"People always say this beer is exactly like Pilsner Urquell. Having had both, I gotta question that statement. They are similar in that they are both pilsners both from the Czech Republic. That's where they end. I prefer PU over this, but will drink this with a 2nd thought. Clean and spicy, slightly thin and creamy mouthfeel. The smell's good. looks great, and tastes pretty good. I recommend it."
"Smells of light hops and tastes malty and hoppy (if those are even really words). Very gentle mouthfeel and so easy to drink it almost drinks itself. What a lager should taste like."
"The taste is beautifully balanced with just the right finish which makes me want another bottle. I've had drier lagers and breadier tasting lagers but this must be considered an archetype for all Pilsners along with Urquell."
"Damn you Bud, Czechzar is TRUE!"
"Pours a clear golden color of a new brass instrument with a modest white sudsy type head that thins down to a layer and then finally to a white halo around where the beer kisses the air and the glass. The smell is of a subtle, yet rich smooth malt and mild saaz hops. The first taste repeats the aroma with a more pronounced hop and carb bite and tapers off into the pillowy malt zone. This is a medium bodied brew for this style and finishes slightly dry. This is an outstanding beer! These beers are way underated IMO as I see them as being no less complex than big beers. They are just sleepers that aren't given their deserved credit. Here's to you...this Buds for you, the real Budweiser!"
"This is a world class Bohemian lager. Excellent malt, great bitterness, Saaz on the nose. Clear medium yellow. Mild lager-esque aroma of lemons and spices. Thin in the mouth, very mild with good carbonation with some nice subtle grain and citrus flavors. Very much like Pilsner Urquell but nowhere as easily available."
"This is the best slightly marred beer I've had in a while. Yes, that is quite a caveat. If it wasn't for the skunkiness, this would be a very fine beer."
"I got a case of this stuff from a wine shop that was getting rid of their beer for $14.99 At that price, I nearly bathed in the stuff. Very easy to drink."
"Pretty tasty beer, smooth and easy to drink."
"Question: Czechvar only promotes this beer as a Bohemian lager, not as a pilsener. Is a Bohemian lager automatically considered a pilsener even if it's not labeled or promoted as such by the brewer?"
"Comments - I have also had this in Germany while stationed there a few years ago while in the military and was very happy to see it finally come stateside albeit with a new name. Same great taste, same easy to drink beer that I remember. One not to be missed if you get the chance to try it."
"Czechvar was a pleasant, well balanced pils that was good at mid-afternoon after a few hours of yardwork. Not a remarkable beer but definitely not the worst pils I've had roll across my tongue."
"Poured very gold and very clear with a puffy white/off white head. The smell was slightly malty/grainy with citrus/hop notes. The taste was indicative of the smell. Slightly sweet malt, but well balanced with the citrus/hops. Also some grain and alcohol flavors lingering in the background. I didn't detect the herb flavors that some have remarked about, but I only drank 2, so perhaps if I get the chance again I'll be able to scrutinize it a bit more. Mouthfeel was excellent, crisp and dry. Drinkability was good also, In my opinion helped along by the crispness. Worth trying, and maybe even worth the hype."
"I wonder just how good this is sampled at the source? There has to be some quality loss from traveling to the other side of the world where I sampled it."
"But its lucky and malt flavourful variation of the crap you generally draw from get-your-arse-drunk-cheap lagers was a satisfying experience which invited for another few bottles to be ordered. Sweet but bitter, well carbon-balanced, Its worth a try among the ever worse family of ""lagers""."
"This is a highly drinkable beer. I'd keep it on hand if I could find it around here."
"Czechvar certainly is the darling of the beer geek for standing up to the ""evil empire", and certainly on its own, it's a far superior beer. A nicely hopped, adjunct free, and certainly a beer I will have in the future."
"Pours a light copper and a not so long lasting head with little to no lacing. The smell was so faint and light I almost couldnt detect it. The best I could say is that it had a slight maltiness. The taste was very watery. No bitterness at all and a very slight malt taste. This beer almost tastes like an american lager ..ie not much taste."
"This is one of the best lagers I have had."
"Czechvar is less hoppy and a bit more malty than Pilsner Urquell, and it is probably an easier drinking beverage. If comparing to Anheuser-Busch's Bud, there is simply no comparison. A classic brew in every sense of the word."
"Oooh, looks like my first taste of this classic brew is from a slightly skunked bottle. Still, it has a great spicy hop nose and a very decent head. I almost got kind of an orangey hop taste. Even with this sample, I can tell its simply more of a beer taste. Ill hope to try this again soon and re-review it."
"I first tasted this beer at a beer tasting festival in State College, PA and was impressed. So I waited a little while and picked up a couple of bottles to further check it out. I am still impressed with this style. It pours golden with a nice thick head. My palate is still unrefined but I like the taste and feel of this beer. I will put this brew on my ""to buy often"": list."
"This is a beer that I should drink on poker night. I don't have enough appreciation for this style, but I should. Good Beer."
"All in all a solid brew, not fantastic but much better than it's american ilk."
"Overall Impression: Light, clean refreshing lager. A good thirst quencher and a nice light session beer. While it’s possible to drink a few more, it’s lacking a bit in terms of memorable character that would make you crave another. Bland is too harsh of a term, mild is closer. Would choose this over any American Macro, but it’s down on my shopping list of micros."
"Original rating: I had this beer from a can in Norway, 4,5% ABV. The expiry date was 6 days ago, i.e. the production date was 1 year earlier, and the beer had not been stored cool at my retailer's. This must have impaired the quality, exactly how much I can't tell. A couple of other raters had the same impression of the beer as I had, and they probably had a fresher can/bottle. Disappointment is the word, folks! Still, I'd like to sample this brew fresh on tap in the Czech Rep. before letting the axe fall. As it is, I have to say that Staropramen has a lot more going. (If anyone would be in doubt: Even outdated and more or less skunked, this 'Budweiser' has a lot more flavour than its American namesake.)"
"The pure crystal clear golden body initally gets a huge cream colored head, but this heads shrinks back rapidly and leaves but little lace on the glass. The nose when the bottle is opened gives brief hints of skunkiness, but this quickly passes to be replaced by a very distinct smell of honey. The malty flavor is reminiscent of Urquell, but does not have nearly as much Saaz hops to it. I fairly light body seems a bit thin, but the drinkability here is just fine."
"Cheers to Morris729 for sending one out to me!"
"Poured a dark gold large head with a rich malt hop aroma that you usually associate with European lagers. The taste was a nice blend of malt and hop It reminded me of when I went to Europe and drank the wonderful German lagers and realized that this was the way beer was meant to taste. I prefer this to Urquell"
"Damn didn't check the date before buying it, best before12/2002 that is probably well past this beers prime, appears deep golden filtered with a nice frothy white head leaves speckled lace as it dwindles doesn't look bad nothing in the appearance says it's old. Let's check aromatics, seems stale but the hop presence of mild Saaz are still there along with a grainy sweetness not too complex and best of all it doesn't smell completely off or rotten. Tastes like a crisp Czech lager to me a hint of fruitiness and some bready yeast notes that I never recalled being there before nice crisp Saaz hops in the finish just a bit mild in flavor. Mouthfeel is light to medium in body decent carbonation better than yellow and fizzy right. Drinkability is very good for this summer session Czech lager from Budejovice, seems a bit still but not bad very drinkable even after almost a year past it's prime."
"Mouthfeel was quenching and extremely easy to drink."
"Best Before: 04/2004"
"Clear and transparent golden hue, a very thin and non-active head. Great lacing, and a ton of carbonation. A rather jumpy hoppy aroma, strong and offensive. Up front, some spicy notes, seems to be medium bodied, grassy and a bit slick; Saaz hop detection throughout the body. A rich and very smooth brew, some bready notes towards the finish, very tasty and enjoyable."
"Can't get this beer in Australia so I had a friend bring some back from the U.K. . After all the hype i was ready to be very dissapointed, but instead I was very pleasantly surprised. A truly nice pilsner, worthy of praise. I was however a bit dissapointed in the lack of saaz aroma in comparason to Urquel."
"Notes: Beyond the spiciness, was fairly underwhelmed."
"It does stand up to the cold quite well and is a good post lawn mowing beer that is clearly superior to it's domestic counterpart. About four years ago I had a chance to try a six pack froma friend in the Czech embassy in DC and I would say that it is quite similar to my original tasting back then and not diluted by the new commercialization."
"Nowadays, Budvar is a pleasant lager, but I would no longer buy a case or more. I wondered if the dismantled Iron curtain allowed the Saaz hops to be sold abroad more easily, or maybe fighting the copyright battles with the ""king of Beers"" affected the brewing of Budvar too much."
"Clear shimmering gold. White average head with average retention. Aroma is a bouquet of peppery floral hops. The hops stand out against firm malt frame. Creamy mouth feel. I could drink these all night. Actually, I did that last night. My six pack was gone in 90 minutes."
"It pours a medium gold with a white head that maintains just a wisp of itself. Nice Saaz hops aroma in the nose with a bit of green fruit and grassy grain, and faint creamy malt. This brew is pretty crisp and clean with cereal-like grain and bitter Saaz taking the forefront but the light, sweet malt makes a brief appearance around mid-palate. Traditionally, Bohemian Pilseners are more substantial than their German counterparts but this one seems a tad light to me....like it could use just a little bit more malt. Even so, this is a solid brew good for summer quaffing."
"Im sure we all know the story behind the beer so i will not go into it.. The beer pours a nice deep straw with a nice crisp white head. The smell is malty with hints of citrus and jasmine? The taste is nice and full. Crisp and malty with just enough dryness to keep it solidly planted. You can really tell that it doesnt use rice and or corn. The mouthfeel is nice but borders on being a bit too fizzy and turning it into a belch machine. Not my favourite style of beer, but i could drink a few of these at a sitting. I good solid beer and I actually prefer it over Pilsner Urquell and other Czech beers i have had."
"The color of this fine Czech pilsener was clear golden, with a bright white, foamy head. The retention was disappointingly average, however. A deepr malt presence was detected in the smell, but a sharper, somewhat citrus hop odor stood out. The crisp taste centered around a refined maltiness, and the aggressive hops provided a slightly bitter component. Very refreshing, Budvar serves as a model for the distinctly Czech pilsener taste. Mine would have tasted even better if it weren't for some residual metallic hint from the bottle cap. The mouthfeel had just the right consistency and carbonation for the medium body. Its easy drinking, and pleasant taste give this high drinkability. I now appreciate my friend's stories of long nights (and eventful get-togethers at the Budweiser Brewery) with this very good beer."
"Medium gold color, medium head. Slightly malty and fairly hoppy. Clean and light, this Czech ""Budweiser"" has the lightness and crispness of ""Bud", but it has a lot more flavor. More hoppy than maltly. Nice crisp sharp hoppy flavor. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and crisp. Aftertaste is dry and slightly bitter. Nice tasty lager."
"Clear pale yellow-golden in color with a decent white fluffy head that leaves a nice lacing in the glass, fresh grassy hop aromas, nice clean light bready and spicy flavors, light bodied with a crisp mouthfeel, finishes dry and crisp with plenty of carbonation, a decent example of the style."
"This brew poured a medium head of fine white bubbles and a transparent light orange colored body with carbonation rising up the sides on the mug. It has a mild hop aroma with the flavor of a lager and its head left little lacing. The taste of this beer is not bad and not great. I could taste notes of chewy hops and some acidic bitterness in its finish."
"Wow, a clean Lager. The nose is crisp and a little malty, so is the taste. A clean summer brew if i ever saw one. It is almost like i've stumbled into an alternate universe where things are so strange that Bud is appealing."
"When poured into my glass, this beer had a quick dissolving head and there was no lacing on the sides of my glass. The carbonation could be seen rising to the top with this beer. The hue was gold. It had a fruity sweet aroma. There was an aftertaste with this beer."
"The body has a refreshing carbonation and is rich without detracting from the refreshing nature. I could drink this one all day long."
"Pale gold or yellow in color with a small amount of creamy white head. Got a skunked bottled but was still able to get a sicy hop aroma out of it. Nice substantial mouthfeel though still on the light side. Quite malty with a nice sweetness coming through the spicy hops. Quite nice and probably easily a 4 if you get a good bottle."
"This may be a good ""conversion"" beer for the macro beer drinkers out there. It has a better, more crisp flavor than American Bud and does not leave any chemical tastes behind."
"Pours a light gold color with a white frothy head. The smell is lightly malty and hoppy. The taste is very rich in malt, but without hops to balance it out. I was expecting more, but was disappointed. Still, not a bad brew, very tasty and light on the palate."
"This is a nice Czech lager/pils..not the best I far prefered Starobrno and even Radegast."
"I wish I bought a 500ml bottle instead of the 12 oz. bottle. :)"
"Overall a very pleasant easy drinking beer, not challenging but fairly tasty. This would be an excellent summer beer."
"The best before date stamped on the back label gave lots of time to work with. Pours out a vibrant gold hue with a moderate head of foam. Nose seems a little complex, small amount of sweet malt, definite presence of hops, and an undeniable appearance of cirtus and herbs. Flavour is similarly complex, everything in small increments dancing around, except for the bitter hop finish which is very apparent. Malt is sweet, and there are lemon and coppery layers in there as well. Drinkability would have been rated higher, but the hops seemed to overpower all the other surprising little naunces before I could pick them out and enjoy them. Otherwise a mighty fine beer for a good session."
"Drinkability: While I doubt that few beers can live up to the hype that this one gets, this is a good standard lager. It's not something I could buy on a regular basis, but it meets the 'lawnmower beer' criteria perfectly."
"Notes: A distinguished lager – clean, refreshing, and crisp. It also has something that it’s North American bottom-fermented cousins seem to be lacking…. flavour!"
"Very smooth and easy to drink. Beer goes great with all but the most spicey foods. This is a great pilsner to use a yardstick to measure all others. I don't think that many surpass it!!"
"Golden in color with a loose and airy head. The taste pervaded my nose like few others. I'm not a huge fan of pilsners but this one fits the role pretty well."
"Nice pilsner beer. Frothy head that stays. Nice spicy Saaz hop aroma is evident. Fizzy, yellow with lighter body than Pilsner Urquell (and no butteriness--which can no longer be found in PU, either) . This brew is drier and less malty than PU. Dry finish with a spicy hop flavor lingering in the aftertaste. A very clean, slick, ""lagery"" beer. Pretty good stuff."
"this is a great pilsener beer. no skunkiness at all in my 6-pack, despite the green bottles. this is a highly drinkable beer. i could drink a lot of these, especially on a hot day. great saaz hops taste gives it nice flavor. not malty, but exotic hops taste is really really good. pours a beautiful golden color. i highly recommend this for anyone who wants to try an authentic czech pilsener. even macro-swill drinkers will like it."
"Notes: This is clearly a different beer compared to our Czechvar, if not ingredients than something in the packaging? I’d say it is better but not by much. A very clean and spicy pils."
"Appearance: Pours a clear and bright golden color. Decent carbonation. The head is white colored and leaves a thin lace around the glass. On the nose there is a herbal aroma, noble hops, and a grassy aroma. Medium body and a smooth and slightly tingly mouthfeel. On the palate the flavors consist of hops, lime, grassy, nice bitterness, crisp dryness, peppery, grainy and herbal. Emm, a most excellent pilsner. Interesting and full flavored...overall a tasty brew"
"This poured with a fluffy white head that settled post-haste. Wonderful brilliant gold in the Pilsner glass. A light touch of skunkiness noted when first poured gives way to a mild malt sweetness and a subtle grassy character. Taste is a soft maltiness that morphs into a very pleasing laid back hop bitterness, gentle carbonation pleases the palate quite nicely. Finishes up mild and delicate, malt and hop coming together in perfect harmony...I really like this one, dare I say moreso than the once-great-but seems-to-have-slipped-in-the-character-dept. P. Urquell. I'll bet this is fantastic on draught. Now if they'd only send their ""Bud Super Strong Lager"" here!"
"One of my new favorite pilsners."
"Pours a pale golden straw color with a large foamy white head that dissipates into a heavy lace. Nose is fresh malts and grains with some strong herbal notes. Not skunky at all despite being in a green bottle. Taste is sweet malts up front followed by some light citrus and herbal notes. Spicy and bitter hops come through in the finish, which is crisp and dry. A very nice pilsner!"
"Typical golden lager color, white head thinnined out but lasted pretty well, very little lacing. Malty, bready and slightly sweetish taste. Saaz hops are nice and subtle, fairly smooth brew. Decent drinkable brew when in the mood for a lager. This type of beer really does not do much for me anymore and I always end up wishing I had an ale."
"Golden colored pils with normal head for this type of beer. It doesn't smell particulary much and the taste is very neutral. Not that it's a bad thing that it doesnt taste much. I think that's the best with this beer, it tastes really good and clean. This is an easy drinkable beer for everyone."
"Pours a clear golden color with a pure white head that fades right away to a thin layer fed by the carbonation. Malty aroma, toasted bread smell too. Taste is clean, slightly sweet, with a little hop bite. Pretty well balanced. Seems a little dry by mid-glass, but still very refreshing. Average mouthfeel with decent carbonation for the style. Leaves a very slight aftertaste, but overall pretty drinkable."
"taste = sweet, hoppy but not TOO hoppy. More delicate if poured in comparion to Pilsner Urquell, a delicious Pilsner beer. Smooth mouthfeel, light body. Close to perfection for my taste buds, I've really enjoyed my first taste of this. More, please!"
"This is a very nice beer. It seems very much the epitomy of the style and rightly deserves to be the standard that other pilsners are measured against. If I was in the Czech Republic, I'd drink this all the time. But since I'm in the USA, I'll buy one of many equally good, locally produced pilsners."
"Pours a gold colour topped by a poor head. Average carbonation and no lace on the glass as you drink this beer. Regular pilsener aroma and taste. ABV is 5.0% and goes down quite easily especially with food (probably the only advantage). It was the first Czech lager i had and i got the wrong impression for Czech beers"
"As a brewer with a particular appreciation for decoction brewed Czech malt and (zaatec saaz hops) this is the perfect pilsner. More delicate than Urquell and smoother than a good day. There is no end to the easy pleasure that this brew brings. In my estimation, nobody would dislike this beer. It is as complicated as you'll let it be. Simplicity is often the hardest achievable goal to admire. A smooth pour, followed by a very delicate hop aroma. The deep but discernible malt flavors surface while lightly masked by the saaz flavors. A smooth mouthfeel remains behind while reminding you to taste again. This shall be my desire to one day come close to duplicating. Cheers to Budvar!"
"Nose of cider mill donuts, green beans and pond edges. A honey coated biscuit mingles with steely hop through a draught and eventually funnels into a tart, tongue smacking pile of fresh leaves. A pleasing lace is left behind for entertainment as a glass is steadily drained. Weighty, but light, like concrete with wings. A class Pils enjoyable anytime."
"Better than average...appearance is a mid-light golden hue with a nice crown that lingered around disapating to a nice thick lace and glass ring....taste is just OK plus.....mild malty finish with slight after taste of the hops...I liked it....I think.....Yup, I did...."
"It poured a nice medium golden color with very little foam. The taste was nice and smooth with just a hint of bitterness in the finish. I would buy this beer over Bud, anytime. This lager is my second favorite beer, that is for a lager so far."
"Apparently AB really has a tendency to do this. A little thing I learnt on the Heineken Brewery Tour in Amsterdam - The Clydesdale horses and Wagon logo was first used by Heineken in the 1700's about 100 years before AB existed. The reason is the larger horses were needed to actually pull the wagon and deliver the large wooden barrels of beer around the city. The Sr. Heineken’s widow actually drove the wagon that to this day with a team of horses sits in the stables in the 1st floor of the old Amstel Brewery just south of the red light district in Amsterdam"
"Crystal clear yellow color. Darker than most pils. Fizzy, almost bubbly creamy head, then it evaporated. Thin covering stayed with the beer. Some sweet butterscotch smells initially then fade. Decent grain, and malt smells. Very much a standard Pilsener smells. Sour oder emerges more toward the bottom. Taste is very evenly sour,then light malt taste, some saaz hop bite. Sour grainy, old beer finish. Wet grass taste, but not Medium carbonation, light bodied. Overall an easy to drink and refreshing beer. Among the better pilseners I have had."
"Green bottle had a gold foil label covering cap and part of the neck. Expiration date was 07/2003. Didn't notice any ill effects to the taste or aroma as a result of being in a green bottle either. Poured a clear medium golden color with a white foamy head which disappeared to practically nothing after a few minutes. Color seemed a bit darker that most Pilsners. Aroma consisted primarily of a pleasant malt scent with Saaz hops present also. Crisp, smooth intriguing mouthfeel. Excellent balance of flavor that has a bready malt finish. This is a great Pils and definitely one I would recommend."
"A pretty excellent czech lager!  Beautiful golden colour and a nice head on this puppy!  A great beer to just drink, it is great on it's own and also complements most foods quite well.  This beer has a nice mouthfeel and aroma and it tastes just like a lager should.  Perhaps one of the most drinkable beers that I have ever encountered!  Not as good as the hype suggest, but damn good none the less!"
"A quaffer, to be certain."
"In conclusion, this is a well balance beer that stays with you from start to finish...the way it should be!"
"I like this beer and at this price a case or two will replace the domestic pils in my varanda fridge next cottage season."
"Unfortunately this is not how I remember the beer in Germany and Prague. I am trying to correct for atmospheric/sentimental influences, but over there it was absolutely perfect. Here, it is butterscotch yellow and giving of evenly toasted and fresh sweet grain aromas together with rocky water and moss notes. The flavors are pure and develop into polished bran, sour wood and aluminum. Perhaps my samples are compromised."
"Excited to see this beer on-tap, and although it was clean and refreshing and went well with my brat and luke-warm German potato salad ... I was disappointed overall. A beer that, in my opinion, doesn't live up to the mega-hype created by the beer community."
"So Budweiser made a halfway decent beer. Well Adam Sandler occasionally makes a halfway decent movie too. That doesn't make it a good movie, just a good Adam Sandler movie. Anyway, no one could argue that this is far better than a Bud, but so what, so are 99% of the other beers on the market. Standing by itself. this beer is average. Slightly darker than a standard Pils with an off-white thin head. Vaguely bitter. Mild malt finish. Really nothing spectacular."
"Pours a nice medium golden color with a moderate snow-white head and lively carbonation, lace leaves irregular rings on the glass walls.  The lovely appearance of this beer epitomizes the modern interpretation of what a beer should look like.  Aroma is well balanced between the Saaz hops and the underlying malts.  Taste begins with a sweet maltiness which soon yields to the citrus and herbal flavors of the hops.  Finish is crisp, dry, and a touch bitter.  While I'm not really a fan of the Pilsner style, this is a remarkably fine beer, not to be missed."
"The first thing to say is that this is a strikingly pretty beer.  A big, soft head floats on top of crystal clear, golden liquid.  There's a pleasant musty, german hop nose.  The first taste is slighty sweet and malty.  The beer has a crisp, sharp finish that was expected for the style.  It's not very highly hopped, and not as bitter as I expected.  Still, this is a very good beer."
"Crystal - clear golden hue, w/ a moderate head that leaves a loose lace.  Grassy Saaz hop nose w/ hints of sweet, bready grain.  Lightly hopped for pilsner, & the beer is left skewed towards malt sweetness.  Saaz hop flavor makes its presence known & the overall flavor is grassy, sweet and lightly grainy.  Finshes w/ a light sugary sweetness on the tongue that fades quickly.  ""Czechvar"" is quite a decent and drinkable pilsner, but is unfortunately short on hop bitterness.  Better than Bud, absolutely.  An outstanding Pilsner, no.  I certainly wouldn't mind drinking several of these, however."
"Rich dark golden color with smooth white head.  Saaz hops aroma evident immediately. Taste is smooth and rich, with maltiness becoming more pronounced as it warms.  Hops bitterness is much more subdued than Pilsner Urquell, which makes Czechvar a bit more mellow and easier to drink.  I love this beer.  Look for the brown single bottles if you are worried of green-bottle skunk!"
"BB is just a ""perfect"" beer."
"Medium amber in color with rich long lasting head. Smells somewhat floral.  Taste is biting with a full citrus like bitterness, but a strong semi-sweet malt backbone saves the day.  Finishes dry and very satisfying.  Not the type of beer I would drink one after another, but definately beats the American Budweiser."
"Have you ever canned tomatoes? If you have, you should be familiar with the smell and flavor tomatoes have when cooked. This beer had an overwhelmingly strong odor and taste of spicy stewed tomatoes. It was too strong to drink. I know this is not normal for this beer from the other reviews of it I have read (and the style doesn't allow for many strong flavors), but it was only days past the Best By date and had been stored in a refrigerator. It should have still been good. There was also some floating particles in the beer which I also assume is not normal, Pilsners typically being filtered. I will come back and rerate, but I've been told by some fellow raters that I should take this beer into account for my rating."
"crisp clean nose. Vey pale yellow crystal clear look.  Not a huge head on the pour, but a lasting little pale white head and lace.  Fine lively little bubbles fill the brew.  A slight smoke malt nose with a slight sweetness.  Lively mouth with great body for a lager.  Original taste has a slight bitterness followed by a slightly sweet finish which is crisp.  I like this beer and feel it is a great and true example of the style. Tis the roots of  the lager tree...."
"Yellow-orange color, thick bubbly head. Grass and hay on the nose. I can taste the hops a bit more than malt. Crisp and refreshing but nothing special."
"Golden-yellow body, big white rocky head, small little bubbles rising from bottom to surface. Looks photogenic. Lot of hay, little bit of hop in nose.  Good balance of malt, then hops, in taste. A good beer to have on hand for those who won't try micros.  They ask for a Bud, give them a Bud. Love the slogan ""it is what you think it is."""
"I've been watching and waiting for my local liquor warehouse to start carrying this brew, and they finally got 6 cases on May 10.  They were already down to 2 cases when I got there after work.  I obviously got a very fresh sample.  First observation:  this ain't a Pilsener, it's a Budweiser; i.e., it's from Budweis, not Pilsen.  Budweisers are maltier than Pilseners.  Anyway, this is an incredibly drinkable beer.  Pure light golden color, nice carbonation, medium-sized white head with decent retention for a lager.  Very, very balanced in the nose and the palate - definitely more malty than a Pilsener, but hops are still evident.  One criticism:  I wish they could have stuck with Budweiser Budvar's brown glass bottle instead of going to green a la Pilsener Urquell.  I know I got a fresh batch this time, but what about the future?  In sum, it's easy to see why this is a very popular beer on the worldwide scene - I could drink an awful lot of these in a sitting."
"Czechvar, from the Czech Republic.  I bought it in a (you guessed it) half liter brown bottle, with a small gold foil cap.  The bottle says 5% a.b.v.  This is the Budweiser Budvar sold throughout the world, but not here.  Had an off-white thick head that quickly dissipated.  Thick sticky Belgian Lace.  Absolutely clear, with a light amber color.  Weak, inoffensive aroma.  Very nice hop dryness, with light malt aftertaste.  Comparing this to A-B Bud is a crying shame. I assume that this is how American lagers tasted before prohibition, and before the macros found adjuncts.  Good, solid beer."
"Well I guess I got a bad bottle, or this beer is vastly overrated.  A dry metallic aftertaste.  Medium hops and carbonation.  Maybe it was the green bottle, I got it for my collection and I'm glad I only bought one."
"Of course, this is infinitely better than Anheuser-Busch's ""Budweiser."" That goes without saying. But is this superior to Pilsner Urquell? A bit more difficult to say. Fortunately, we don't have to choose. To my mouth, this is a little better; a bit sweeter, maltier, and fuller. I might prefer PU on a hot day since it has more of a zest. However, remember that Czechvar (the US name of Budweiser Budvar) is an extremely popular, international, mass-produced brews (as is PU). While it is one of the premier brews in the style, the satisfaction it provide is very basic. Most beer drinkers should love it. Beer connoisseurs may be looking for something more."
"I was a bit disappointed when I tasted this. I think my expectations were too high. Very drinkable and great color, but I think that Pilsner Urquell is better."
"This is a very refreshing beer.  Pours out slightly darker than its American counterart, with decent lacing on the glass.  Malt and hops are both present, with a nice twang (not bitter) of hops on the finish.  A very nice Pils. I like this better than Pilsner Urquell and its not expensive either."
"God, I wish Bud had this much or any flavor.  Had this in San Fran over Christmas vacation, looking at my notes - good color, golden - slightly hoppy with a nice finish, this as a good summer beer.  Can't wait to try another - as good as Pilsner Urguell in bottle."
"Elegant and slightly malty czeck pils, with nice bitterness to finish, not as good as Urquell, but still damn nice."
"I agree that this beer may have been over hyped but that does not change the fact that it is a great Czech lager. It has the complex malt you expect along with the herbal/citrisy hop. I'm not much of a lager nut but I would definately put this one in my beer buying rotation. The other two would be Okocim Zagtoba and Altenmuster."
"My sample was a little skunky at first, but that dissipated after pouring. Nicely malted, but not too sweet, followed by a prickly hop finish. Thankfully nothing like the Bud we know of today that AB stole from Budvar."
"Malty at first.  Rich flavor that insantly burts in your mouth.  Mellows at the end, but overall is very enjoyble."
"One of my favorites from the Czech Republic. Almost all Czech beers are fair superior to what we call beer in the U.S."
