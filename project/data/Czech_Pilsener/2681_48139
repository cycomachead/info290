4.03,12.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Poured a clear golden yellow body with a foamy white head that slowly receded. A good, classic Pilsner appearance. Scents of lager yeast, grainy malt, Pilsner malt, soft malt sweetness and medium-light floral hops. Overall impression is of a simple, classic Pilsner, a balance of sweet, yeasty and hoppy. Very nice. Flavor begins lightly dry with notes of floral, earthy hops, grainy malt and softly sweet malt. Middle continues flavors of hops, picking up a bit more Pilsner malt sweetness. Finish is medium-dry with notes of grainy malt, softly sweet Pilsner malt and medium-high herbal and floral hop flavors. Aftertaste is dank herbal and floral hops and grainy malt. Overall impression of flavor is of a dry Pilsner that has a soft underlying sweetness to keep it balanced, but that is still grained and hoppier than it is sweet. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with high carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a classic Pilsner, refreshing and easy to drink. Overall this is a pretty good Pilsner. It is hoppy and fairly dry in aroma and flavor with a nice refreshing mouthfeel. A good example of what the style can be when done properly.","Auraan","Dec 27, 2014"

I had a friend who drinks American ""pilsners"" and he felt it was way too hoppy, but to me it was just right. I felt it had a nice balance of hops and bready malitiness. Crisp and well flavored for the style. When I catch it on sale I will purchase it again. My only complaint is that similar quality breweries have similar beers for better prices. Nevertheless, its a solid pils.","humuloner22","Oct 01, 2014"

Indeed, its yella ... a sparkling yet slightly cloudy light lemon drop hue with a rather gorgeous creamy white head of approximately two fingers height. Aroma is freshly hulled grains and fragrant noble hops all the way ... White bread, breakfast cereal, fresh cut hay, a tinge of tarragon and lavender. Great Saaz nose. Fresh, moderately sweet, and inviting. Palate is assertive, almost bold, with sweet grains and spicy hops in equal measure. An almost plain donut-like malt sweetness lurks underneath a slight grain husk note, clover-like floral hops, vanilla, bread from a cranked up toaster, and a hint of butter. The sweetness evokes cornbread as well. The vaguest whiff of orange citrus. Classic Czech profile on the nose, hybrid Czech/CAP (classic American pils) on the palate. Thin to moderate body I suppose, highly carbonated. The husk note could be considered a rough edge but I don't mind too much right at this point. One of those beers that translates super well at the right moment ... Which must be now as I type this review.","CalgaryFMC","Sep 19, 2014"

It was crisp and clear, with about a 4 finger head that dissipated in about 5 minutes with a good amount of glass lacing. The smell is what I expect in a pilsner: crisp lemon and a bit of bready-ness. The taste follows the smell: lemon with a bit of bready-ness at the end. It's easy to drink and would be a perfect session beer at a BBQ (or with this turkey sub that I have). I'd buy it again to introduce people to craft beers.","nreed","Jul 19, 2014"

Nose is fairly nondescript, with hints of baked bread and some vague hoppiness. Taste is a nice malt/hop balance--I'm not a fan of the trend toward heavily hopped lagers--with some hop finish (maybe Saaz?). Mouthfeel is solid, mildly unctuous. Given the 5.3 abv and reasonable price, it would make a nice session lager. Not a classic, but I'd happily drink it again.","jps0869","Jul 08, 2014"

Nice soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, pear, cracker, bread, pepper, floral, grass, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt, hop, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, pear, bread, cracker, floral, grass, light pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, bread, cracker, floral, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a bit. Nice balance of malt, hop, and yeast flavors; with good robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a nice pilsner style. Good balance of hop, malt, and yeast flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 06, 2013"

This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, clean, and not filling, but the flavors didn't really hold my attention, I wouldn't want another one right now, but I could see this being a decent lawn mower beer in the summer. What I liked the most about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was really good, it worked well with this beer, and it was pretty true to style. What I liked the least about this beer was the lack of balance and hop character, more hops flavors and bitterness would really help this beer out and make it truer to style. I don't think I would buy this again, this might be nice to have a couple on the disc golf course, but at that point I would probably be better off saving some money and drinking an AAL instead, I can't say I really recommend this beer, but if I had a friend who wasn't that in to craft beer, I would offer him one of these. All in all this beer was a little bit of a let down, it just didn't have the bitterness and balance that I look for in the style. So far this is my least favorite beer from Oskar Blues, I just wasn't a fan of this, but I'm still hopeful that they make a beer that I will really enjoy, better luck next time guys.","StoutHunter","Mar 26, 2013"

Like I've said, it's like a well made domestic beer. Keep in mind I'm two beers deep, but I'm really trying to focus on this beer and look at it as un-buzzed as possible... I really do think it's a very solid beer. And the fact that it comes from a can? Forget about it. Mama's Little Yella Pils HAS to be (keep in mind this is my first craft can) my favorite canned beer. Even if I happen to stumble upon a bigger, better, and bolder craft beer in a can (regardless of style), I seriously feel like I'll be coming to this beer again and again to be my go-to summer beer. It's just wonderfully flavorful (while still being light), easy drinking, and tasty. Definitely try it out.","Alextricity","Mar 11, 2013"

While hop qualities seem to vary widely among American-brewed Bohemian pilsners, the best seem to have invested in them a rock-solid foundation of light malts that are delicate and frequently honeyed. Such is not the case here; undercooked flour blankets the palate early. The too-heavy texture does nothing to elevate its qualities. Hops show up, but do not define the sensory profile as much as in some others of the style, such as Green Flash Fizzy Yellow Beer or Sam Adams Noble Pils.","beagle75","Jul 29, 2012"

Mama's pours a clean, yellow straw color, and is capped with one-inch of white foam which leaves a sticky lace around the glass. Aromas of sweet maltiness, and spicy Saaz hops dominate the nose, and some spice and grass hints are noticeable as well. Rich malt flavors blend well with a somewhat restrained sweetness, excellent level of balance achieved here, with notes of spice lingering in the back of the mouth. This brew features a medium body and medium amount of carbonation, both of which help lead to the amazing crispness. Although they did win the Silver at the GABF, we like to think of this as a Gold Metal Winner.","phishsihq","Apr 15, 2012"

Overall, this is a pretty good pilsner that is refreshing and easy to drink.","UCLABrewN84","Mar 18, 2012"

It has a pretty typical pilsener nose: lighter malts, some grassy and earthy hops. It also has a nice taste. Medium-light bodied, just enough of a grassy/earthy hop bite to it. A good Pils!","Boto","Mar 09, 2012"
3.83,7.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"First American craft in a can, and a very good one. Mama's Little Yella Pils is indeed yellow, with slight amber overtones. Plenty of head and carbonation. Lacing sticks to the side of the glass like a bullldog. Nice grassy malt aroma, almost the floral characteristics of an ale. I really like the taste and feel of this - it is a pleasure to drink. It's got the spiciness of the hops with the mouthfeel of great malt. Fits squarely in the great tradition of German and Czech beer - maybe a little hoppier, but really not too much. I'm looking forward to more Oskar Blues brews after this one.","angusdegraosta","Mar 04, 2012"

It faintly smells of bready malts but also some grainy tones layered underneath with a tiny twist of citrus.

3.7,3.6,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"A clear pale gold color with a decent foamy white cap and very good lacing. The aroma is a really solid, almost peppery wheat cereal/bread idea. Very apetizing if you like a pilsner at all. The flavor brings out more of the same. The head is near milky in it’s texture and taste and then the wheat goodness breaks through. It’s medium-light bodied with plenty of fine carbonation to tickle the palate for a fresh, effervescent feel but it maintains a certain creaminess that seems a bit different for the style. However, after the initial pleasure, I start to get a somewhat apricot tartness that leaves a slightly vinegar-like idea at the back of my tongue. But those are vague nuances. It generally holds a solid sunshine wheat flavor, classic liquid bread and an easy drinker.","Durge","Sep 24, 2011"

2.58,-27.7,3,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,"Oskar Blues’ trailblazing move to can craft beer has paid off handsomely as rival brewers emulate their model. The cans are certainly a convenience - the highlight of my most recent backpacking trip was dredging several six-packs of Oskar Blues from a nearby lake and enjoying them near a fire. However, my love affair with Oskar Blues is not with their love for aluminum, but the care they put into their beer. Dale’s Pale Ale, Ten Fidy and Old Chub have all been favorites, and more recently I’ve become enamored with the Gubna. However, while excellence is a trend in all these brews, there are places in Oskar Blues’ line-up where I find myself a little disappointed. Their ‘Mama’s Little Yella Pils’ is one of these. It took me a long time to develop a fondness for pilsners, but when I did I was hooked. Despite my conversion, Oskar Blues’ take on the pilsner is less than addicting. It features a clear, crisp pilsner taste, with a mineral aftertaste, but the flavor seems light, and uncharacteristically bland. Dale’s and Old Chub are special and unique, particular to Oskar Blues, and singularly great. The pils fades into obscurity, muddled by its own lack of flavors. It’s a pilsner, sure, and drinkable, sure, but not memorable.","GarrettB","Aug 24, 2011"

The hopping is appropriate - floral and lightly grassy - more sharp than spicy, but light all the same. What's also registering light is some lemon peel or orange flavors via the hops, enhancing/accenting the sweetness of what's a more-than-traditional malt-forward taste. Cereal grain qualities to the malt and dextrins seem to be pumped up a bit more than needed, albeit consistent with their other ""lighter"" beers. It wants to flow more clean and smooth, but just enough sticky sugar gets left behind to render it un-refreshing. I'd deem it a worthy effort either way.","Bouleboubier","Feb 25, 2011"

It was a nice, bright cloudy golden yellow with lots of visible carbonation and carried a great thick, creamy head with good retention, but after that it just went downhill like the Troublette. Under my nose, it came across medicinally sweet but with a faint and bitter powdered sugar corn/banana bread malt tint. Oh yeah, there was some yeast in there, too. Weird, I know. The mouthfeel was definitely on the thicker side, with a lighter flavor - basically all sweet cornbread malt - than the nose. I really wish I had more to end on, but that's about as good as it's going to get for tonight.

More grain comes through in the taste, followed by light caramel, and even some grape flavor. Mouthfeel is light and crisp, showing immense drinkability.

The aroma here is sweet and syrupy at first. The taste is akin to the Coors I used to drink 30 years ago in college, dry and bitter and, frankly, skanky. However, perseverance is its own reward in so many things, including beer drinking. Let this beer warm up a bit (not necessarily intuitive with a Pilsner) and it gets better. The sweetness lessens and the bitter edge mellows. The malt steps forward and puts a fist into the face of the top-heavy hops, lending balance that was initially lacking. By the time I got to the bottom of the glass I might have ordered another had my dinner date not arrived. Still, approach with caution. Have a taste before you commit to a glass or a can.","gfreed","Jun 06, 2010"

Its a nice straw gold, with a little cloudiness; snow white, sudsy head that manages the slightest retention and leaves some sheets of lace. Aroma is sweet and a little musty - maybe some grain and grassiness in there, too. Taste is of wheat / bread crust with some honey in the finish - hoppiness is about perfect (minimal, yet noticeable... balanced). Despite what you'd think by looking at it, the mouthfeel is creeping up into medium territory, and it leaves a touch of stickiness on the palate. Drinkability is exceptional - this is my go-to beach beer... glad I finally got around to rating it.","jpro","Jun 06, 2010"

Anyway, this guy pours a clear golden straw, leaning toward the pale sector, with a thick and healthy white froth on top. A strong and thick bit o' lacing will be formed soon. A firm distinction of bitter hops comes through in the nose, along with an aluminum-style metallic scent. I think there might be some cooked corn in there as well, but I can't be sure. The bitterness is definitely there on the tongue, with a strong stony feel to it. The aluminum returns, too, but luckily it's toned itself down for this austere occasion (meeting me is an event, dammit!). That vague sense of corniness is there again, rounding out the usual simple flavor profile of these pilseners. The body is light, as it should be, with active carbonation and a dry, crisp finish.

It's certainly better, but having had a really great pilsener (Moonlight Reality Czeck), I can at least say that the style can be done better. This beer is too sweet, lacks hop aroma and flavor and fails to justify its relatively high price tag. On the other hand, there is no sour mash off-flavor that marks the vast majority of macro lagers as being of inferior quality. Also, my score would probably shoot up significantly if the hops were increased. My biggest problem is that the simple, sugary malt flavor isn't counterbalanced properly and just makes me think of the taste of pale malt extract. I love when American craft breweries take on lager styles, but lagers seem to need a whole lot of tinkering to achieve a perfect balance of flavors. So, I hope Oskar Blues keeps at it and just makes some adjustments.","popery","Jul 21, 2009"

Apparently anticipation didn't take hold until tonight, when I saw it behind several other beers in the refrigerator. The beer is clear and golden colored, and despite foam spurting out when I popped the cap, there was a very thin head in the pint glass. The smell is subdued, very neutral in that both malt and hops are detected but seem turned to about 2 on the aroma-dial. The taste is surprisingly good compared with the nose, sweet pale malts primarily but with saaz hops providing a comfortable level of bitterness. It tastes European, this is high praise. Strongly carbonated, so much so it tickles when swallowed. Definitely a good backyard beer or baseball beer, easy for summertime overall.","TurdFurgison","Jul 17, 2009"

The taste is more on the malty side with a big toasty, lightly carmely bit, and balancing hops in the background. It isn't as crisp as one might expect from a pilsener, but it works nonetheless.

Very weak and non pronounced, take a page from Sly Fox if your going to can a pils do it right. This is no Czech or German pils it seems like an American macro. Flavor is just a blend of mild sweetness some cooked veggie with stale hop character barely has any bitterness just focuses on the yellow fizzy beer flavors. It does nothing to set itself apart, I love their other canned offernigs but this one strikes out. Mouthfeel is light and mildly fizzy in the carbonation department, not much to speak about.

Drinks easy; light enough in body to to have 4 or 5 and flavorful enough to want another after you're done. Not too much bitterness but enough to clean up the mild sweetness and the pale malty flavors. Had this straight from the can yesterday at an outdoor concert and it was almost as good that way.

Nor did they leave a lasting lace. the aromas are of noble earthy noble hops, come horse blanket musty-ness and hay/straw. The perfect grain flavor comes through on the first sip along with the background of hops. there has to be some carapils malt in this, it's rather sweet. The mouth feel lends perfectly to the style of this beer. It's light, brightly carbonated, and sharp bubbles. Smooth soft feel, when the carbonation settles in your mouth.

Basically tastes like a non-adjuncty lager. Very neutral flavor, probably great for tailgating. Light to moderate body with less than crisp carbonation, finishes quite neutral. Drinks outstandingly easy, no strong or odd flavors to hold any sort of beer drinker back. This is a very boring and bland pils, not much flavor at all.

Loose bubbles that sort of cling from the start, but clear out kind of quickly. Maybe I should've poured more vigorously. The smell is immediately of powdery sweet malts, with a good charge of earthy, herbal hops. Very little else, perfectly clean and straighforward. Both smell and taste are what I'd expect, better than average, but I don't know what outstanding would entail for the style. The taste is pretty impressive. The malt backbone is really flavorful for the simplicity. I would guess there was some decoction involved (melanoidin flavor?), and pilsener malt has a nice flavor in itself. The hops are pleasant, herbal, spicy, kind of a mint flavor, then there's the leafy, earthy notes. It's very cdrisp, finishes dry after the initial sweetness. There is a lasting flavor that sort of cling to the inside of your mouth. The carbonation is quite sharp, which holds me back, but it also puts this about in line with the style.

Plenty of spotty lace and froth left behind. Grass and light fruit in the nose. This one displays a bit of the expected pils crispness and grassy goodness.

Smells similar to a miller or budweiser. Taste is sweet malt at first followed by a slight fruity hop flavor and then the flavors abruptly stop and give way to a lingering bitterness. I would say that the malt flavor is a little bit more up front than a normal pilsner and the hop flavor is actually detectable pushing it a notch above all the other pilsners out there.

They are spicy and herbal in quality. Just a litle lemon as well. On the drier side as well which I prefer. Light body with lively carbonation that cuts short of being harsh.

Mild nose - grainy and perhaps a hint of lemon. Clean taste. Some residual cereal grains with again, a suggestion of citric acid; finishes fairly clean.

Light sweetness. Very easy to drink and carbonated just right. I could have a lot of this beer. While there's not much to say about it, it's just a clean well made beer. I would get it again, but I've never seen it before so we'll see if it continues to show up around town.","kleffman","Jan 29, 2009"
3.27,-8.4,3,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Had this on tap very recently at the Brick Store Pub. Is this a new batch or a stored keg? I have no idea, but it tasted perfectly fresh. That said, this wasn't the most impressive Pilsner I've ever had, but it was decent. Poured pale yellow with a fizzy white head that faded away to nothing. Smelled grainy and fresh and with a bit of cereal grain sweetness. The taste is light and grainy with little hop presence. Soft and a bit grainy in the mouth, but nice enough. Pretty easy to drink, but lacks interest.","Georgiabeer","Jan 20, 2009"
3.5,-2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The appearance of the beer was a good wheat color with a yellowish white foam. The aroma of the beer was that of a typical pilsner in that it has the aromas of the wheat and coliander. But nothing that really stuck out. The taste of it followed suit but tones of cloves could be picked up. Overall this beer is a good pilsner to have just not too overly impressed with it as it is a ""typical pilsner"".","Tolnik","Jan 11, 2009"
3.58,0.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall this was a pretty solid take on the style, but the flavors just don't have enough to them. They kind of sneak up instead of asserting themselves. Still, not a bad beer, and I'm always open to anything Oskar Blues puts out.","glid02","Nov 22, 2008"
3.18,-10.9,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability: Woefully average, really. It's acceptable, sure, but there's just not an overly expressive character and it comes off just like any other plain old pilsner.","ChainGangGuy","Nov 19, 2008"
3.78,5.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"On tap at Oskar blues in Lyons. Clear yellow, white head. Smells decent, tastes good and earthy like many pilsners I have had. Very easy to drink and a good companion for their wings. This would be a good candidate for a can to mow lawns, barbecue or take hiking.","ArrogantB","Oct 13, 2008"
