"Overall an interesting brew.  This is not a bad spin of the pilsner style - would do again."
""
""
"Slightly sweeter and more lemony than expected from a Pilsner."
""

""
"Not great, a little bitter--no floral hints"
""
""
""
"Not a fan of the pear with the pilsen malt.  On my tongue it gives an off taste when combined."
"F: Light, slightly metallic like all Delaware beers.  (must be the refineries)."
""
""
""
"There's a solid pilsner behind the tart pear flavor, but the pear really dragged the whole thing down. The peach was overbearing instead of accentuating, cloying and artificial tasting."
"Poured into Pilsner glass. Finger of head. Very light clear yellow. Smell is sharp a little pear and hops and yeast. High carbonation maybe too much. Very harsh and bubbly going down. Tart bitter pear. I did not like the tartness and was too much carbonation made my stomach and chest feel bloated and bubbly."
""
"Tart and bitter pils. A lot different from everything else I've had from Dogfish head."
"Di loves this beer.  Gave it at 4.75"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Clear and golden yellow. Lighter carbonation and heavier body than other pils I’ve tried, which is interesting. Enjoyable pils, solid american representation of the style."
""
""
""
"This was really good. Tart and pear like. The hops were really good. There was an interesting soapy taste to it, but that wasn't the turn off that it would sound like it would be."
"Honey color with a medium white head, malt and yeast aromas, taste of malt with a biscuit aftertaste, nice clean finish with mild carbonation.  Overall a nice pilsner."
""
""
""
""
""
"I expected more pear flavor in this one. I think the caramel undertones overpowered the pear. Nice color & aroma. I'll give this one another try to win me over."
""
""
""
"Deep golden color with a thick white foamy head that hangs on and leaves sheets of lacing all over the glass.  Aromas are very adjunct like to me.  Grassy, heavy dough aroma and some spicy hop character but no fruit notes come through.  Taste differs on that end, opens with grass, hay and big dough pilsner quality.  Mid palate brings fruity pear and apple notes and a spicy lemony finish.  Well carbonated but creamy on the palate.  Overall this is an interesting change of pace.  The flavor delivers and I do like it as a change from big winter beers.  I'd probably revisit this one again."
""
"I really didn't like this beer. It was probably the pear that made it so bad. It presented to me as something gone wrong. It looked beautiful but smelled and tasted bad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Decent retention and lace, fruity and caramelly scent. Bittering hops shine through with fruity tones, deep caramel undertones with a dry finish. Somewhat drinkable even with the ABV."
""
""
"To be transparent, had to look up what a ""Czech style Pilsner was"". This was my first. This one holds true to definition: golden, high foaminess & lighter flavor. I was a little worried about the pear flavor but the pear is subtle. Slightly tart, but virtually no aftertaste. Very smooth. Good but not overly flavored"
""
""
"O - This is a pretty decent version of a pils, and I find it a bit spiky, so the name fits.  I wonder if more pear flavor or nose would tip this into fruit beer territory, but as it stands the pear is backgrounded by the punchy hops."
"Very good beer. Can't wait to have one in the spring. And summer. I didn't find this ""piercing", but I did find it tasty. Very tasty! Go get some!"
""
"Color was a little darker than most pilsners. Looked flat as there was almost no head and didn't appear to be much carbonation. Little carbonation was confirmed with the first few sips, but it didn't taste flat. Tasted more tropical than most pilsners. Went down smooth. Not what I was expecting, but I enjoyed it."
""
"A pleasant surprise, glad I was able to find this seasonal draft."
"Disappointed with this beer From dogfish"
""
"Drinkin this at Black Sheep Lodge"
"I think I must have gotten a bad bottle. This was just awful. Starts off skunky, and finished with a overpowering metallic and bitter (not hoppy, but acrid) taste. I wanted to like this, but that finish will haunt me for a long time."
"Perfect summer beer. Crisp and refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very good for a pilsner.  I tried it at the Columbus Winter Beer Fest, and didnt realize it was brewed with pear juice until looking online afterwards.  That explains why it seemed a bit different than a normal pilsner I was expecting at the time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Golden and crisp with a little bite making it a more interesting and drinkable beer. A little more bitters than a traditional Pilsner."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This a decent Pilsner beer"
"No bad. Taste like a lager with pear in it."
""
""
""
"Overall - An oddity, but frankly one that works quite well. A unique take on a style that's steeped in singular-minded approaches, Piercing Pils is proof positive that old dogs can learn new tricks, particularly when it's learning new tricks from a Dogfish! In honesty I didn't expect much from this one, and even in the first few sips I thought it was just decent, but it grew on me as the layers began to unfold. This is one pilsner you won't mind warming to room temp. Prost, DFH!"
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a huge fan of the pilsner style but have to give credit for an interesting idea, well-executed."
"Best tasting Pilsner I've ever had.  Outstanding."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An excellent, somewhat different , Pils. Very rich head, dry hoppy aroma with floral, good carbonation, and a light gold color. The taste is both dry and refreshing leaving a good slightly bitter after taste. Somehow, someway, this works as a Pilsner. There is no doubt its crafted with love. I bought it while in one of my ""slightly different"" moods and when you get a little bored with the $14 a 12 pack Lagers try a 4 back of this and just hang out and enjoy."

"Great beer.  By far my favorite pils."

"This poured (12oz) a relatively clear, golden hue into my tulip... minimal head present. Aromas were a bit funky/dank (at first), note of yeast as well... and also some pear coming through, especially as it warmed in the glass. Pear presence and interesting, slightly spicy hop profile on the tongue. Nice and balanced, as well as unique flavors. The mouthfeel was light to medium and some of the notes (like the spicy one) really stuck around for a bit. This was a unique and really enjoyable take on a simple style."
"A very solid pilsner, that I would definitely drink again."
"12 oz bottle.  Pours pale golden with tall, long lasting, fluffy, white head and nice lacing.  Aroma is of grassy hops and biscuit malt.  Body is medium and slightly crisp.  Herbal hops, pale malt and sweet fruit fill the mouth.  Finish is medium lasting, herbal. Nice brew."
""
""
"Disappointed once again by this style of beer. I cannot give a truly good opinion because I just am not a fan of pilseners. For me they lack depth and character with smell and taste. Sorry Dogfish Head love you guys, nothing personal, just not a fan of the style."
"Overall, very drinkable beer. Nothing overly complex or worth over analyzing.however, beer is extremely drinkable... I would say that it's like the craft beer version of a light beer (even at the 6 percent ABV). I would pair this with a poached pear with a caramel drizzle and vanilla bean ice cream.Gets an 88/100 from me."
""
"Hazy, oxidized, metallic aftertaste, sweet, malt driven beer..."
""
""
"Hazy copper yellow. Some malt sweetness and barley on the aroma. There is something very wrong with the aftertaste. Muddled copper or metallic flavor and almost a skunky finish (makes no sense considering it's on tap): stay away."
""
"The pear juice dominates the drink making it overly sweet."
""
""
""
"Stale, unpleasant nose, followed by an overwhelmingly sweet body: pear juice with a truckload of sugar added."
""
"I snagged a 4-pack of this at a Sunoco Craft Beer Exchange, and it's been a tale of two beers.  The first was poured at near room temp, and it did little to inspire. The second was chilled, and what a difference that made. Both beers poured with a mottled, white head that popped and fizzed away in short order. The more aggressive pour produced a towering foam crest that left beautiful lacing on my Modelo Especial pint glass. The appearance is consistent with a classic golden pilsener. Great clarity. Perhaps a touch more concentrated in color. More like the beer I recycle after a night of drinking-related dehydration. There's a bright, crisp, floral hop aroma with underlying white grape juice sweetness. A little bit of Apple Jacks cereal in the nose. The first impression is simply too sweet for my liking, but at a cooler temperature it's less pronounced. No discernible pear flavor, save the sugar. Unbalanced. The Saaz hops tend to dominate, competing only with a cloying sweetness. The cracker-like malt flavors get a little lost in a sea of refined sugar. The finish is mildly bitter, and leaves a somewhat muddled impression. The moderate mouthfeel and tame carbonation are a bit light. Not as spritzy or crisp as I had hoped. In the end, if you're not opposed to sugary libations, it's truly a non-offensive beer that does little to push the flavor envelope. A passable pilsener nonetheless. There's a marked difference between the warm and cool variations that I tried. At cooler temps it was much more refreshing and masked some of the imperfections. The warmer variety had me focused on all of the wrong things. The same can be said for any number of macro-lagers, so that can't be a good thing. Either way, I had hoped for more with the addition of pear and pear tea. Ultimately it's a crafty example of Saaz hops in an overly-sweetened Czech Pilsener."
""
""
""
"The taste is musty and soapy, a little wet grass with pear.  Unfortunately, everything kind of runs together and it is hard to break out the individual tastes. The finish is crisp, cracker like and kind of dry. A little bitter as well, like making you purse your lips bitter."
""
""
""
""
"Flavor is clean and dry with a cracker-like breadiness characteristic of the style. Some fruitiness that isn't characteristic, maybe the pear juice at work. Slick texture, very fine carbonation. Nothing really flashy here as DFH beers go but still pretty tasty. An interesting take on what, to me, can be a bland style."
""
""
""
""
""
"Just not greatly executed, not a great Pils, not a lot of fruit, not a great beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Slightly hazy, yellow in color with an average sized white head that fades away quickly. Floral hops with a touch of spice and faint pear in the aroma. Kind of dull flavor and the pear makes for a bit of an odd combination but it works. Lots of fizzy carbonation resulting in a crisp, clean finish. Overall, a clean, easy drinking beer but misses the mark with a lot of the pilsner qualities that I enjoy."
"Uneventful. Watery with light carb. Low head retention. Hardly any pear. Probably one of the most dissapointing dfh beers I've had, and I mostly love their beer."
""
"I always feel like I'm taking a risk when I  buy a Dogfish Head beer. This sounded promising but ends up missing the mark for me. It doesn't have the crispness that I expect from a good pilsner and has an odd bitterness to the aftertaste, perhaps that's due to the pear, it doesn't seem like hop bitterness. All in all it's an okay beer but I won't be buying it again."
"I have rated this one highly. It is certainly different from most pilsners and I could see how some purists might rate it more strictly according to the style. However, I choose to rate it highly because it's so damn delicious!"
""
"Overall: probably the most subtle experimental beer out there. it could easily be mistaken for a standard pilsner but the pear juice just adds a barely there twang on the style. a solid beer"
"Very enjoyable."
""
""
""
"Good Pilsner refreshing and clean with notes of pear"
""
""
""

"O - This was far more mild than anticipated and I didn't get the pear taste as advertised; however the pear seems to offset any bitterness; this was an easy drinking and enjoyable pils"
"Not bad for a Pilsner."
""
""
""
"Solid beer. Pear blends in nicely"
""
"Smooth and enjoyable. A well-made pils with a touch of pear. It's like having a great beer while eating a ripe pear. Nicely done!"
"12 into tulip. Caveat: this is my first pils since I had an Urquell back in the mid 80's as a teenager. Slightly hazy gold with a giant white head, retained well while waiting to come to temp. Aroma gave the pear early, not sure if that was power of suggestion and I was hunting for it or if that really is the initial nose. The biscuity malt came next with a slight tart edge, kind of lime, not hops. I could not find a date on the bottle to see if any aging had impacted aroma and flavor. The flavor was true to the aroma, with pronounced intensity. Orchard fruit forward with biscuity malt across the palate, with a tart lime-grass finish. If this is indicative of the pils genre, I look forward to trying many traditionals. I know this one had the pear thing built in, but I tried to gauge some sense of pils around it. My rookie status as a pils drinker may not have done that well."

"Dogfish head never fails to ease"
""
"Overall:  Another miss for me from Dogfish - they run about 50/50 with me; always interested to see what they come up with and though I am a big fan of several of their beers, this is not one of them; I really would have preferred to see the hops stand up better relative to the malt and the adjuncts here"
"O: an interesting take; not as crisp as I would expect from a Bohemian Pils ; none of the bitterness I would expect either;"
"   Overall a 4.25 for Piercing Pils - Dogfish Head Brewery. i would probably pick this up again."
"Piercing Pils brewed by Dogfish Head Brewery, with an ABV of 6.00% This brew pours out a  golden amber color with a nice white head.  This is  an filtered brew, you can see right though it. The smell is rich with malts and grains. You also pick up on some hops , and mild sweetness in the smell.  Now for the tastes, it is rich with flavor. You pick up on a mild sweetness with some spices.  There is a lot going on in this brew.  The mouthfeel is nice and clean, and refreshing.  There is nothing overpowering in this brew.  Piercing Pils has a nice balance to it. Overall I'm giving Piercing Pils,  a 4 out of 5. I would buy this brew again. Dogfish Head Brewery, did a nice job with this brew."
""
"I tend to enjoy pilseners, but this one left a bad taste in my mouth. Maybe it was the pear juice."
"A little skunky. It was tart"
""
""
"Smooth great flavor clean tasty and very drinkable ..summer time feeling"
""
""
""

"Overall- A great beer from DFH. Excellent drinkabilty. Although a seasonal this one would great anytime of year if it were available. Pick it up if you can find it."

"Well I was hoping this one would be a pear bomb. I love pears but didn't really pick up much of it. I picked up a 4pk so I may need to update once I get another taste. But for now, it is a solid fruit beer but could use some more pear."
""
""
""
"It starts quite floral in the nose, backed by grassiness. The flavor reveals quite a bit of fruitiness including pear and apple, but also lemon, which must be coming from the hops. Beneath that there's a stable base of Pilsner malt that's gently bread and a bit straw-like. The bitterness is solid, but only to the point of balancing the malt as the acidity of the pear juice is enough to put an edge on it, and both then follow into the lingering finish along with straw and residual lemon (as well as some tea-leaf). Perhaps that's the ""piercing"" nature that inspired the name, as I love the start but find the end a little raspy. Or is the ""pierce"" that shot of lemon that you get at the front? Regardless, it's unique and you really have to give it credit for that. Additionally, it's clearly well made (great appearance, great head retention and lacing, nicely balanced with a bit of a twist, appropriate mouthfeel)."

"Better than I expected. Beer is amber and mostly clear, white head medium and large bubbles, nice lacing. Aroma is fruity, pears obviously. An easy drinker, unoffensive, nice fruitiness pairs with the yeast well. I'd have it again maybe."
""
""
"Overall: Good brew. The pilsner and pear notes seems like a natural pair right after this first sip and you wonder how no ones come up with it till now. The pilsner body somewhat gets destroyed by what I'm guessing is the addition of the pear tea but it's tasty so I don't mind."

"12oz bottle. Pours a clear golden yellow with a medium lasting white head, some lacing. Aroma is sweet fruity pear notes, biscuit malt and some herbal hops. Taste is same as aroma with some herbal hops bitter notes. A medium crisp body on the palate, lively carbonation, goes down smooth. The finish has a sweet fruity pear like flavor, biscuit malt and herbal hops bitterness for balance. This brew is nicely balanced not too sweet not too hoppy, a just right combination. Overall a uniquely flavored but tasty session brew and refreshing. Try it."

"This cloudy amber brew has a fairly good head and a surpisingly smooth and full feel.  Fruity, although the specific contribution from pears is a bit subtle. A little more bitter and tart than sweet."
"nice yellow-gold color with a nice white head. smell is sweet with some citrus and bread. The taste has some sweet, some hops and is crisp and clean with plenty of carbonation. The flavor is bold and leaves you with a satisfied feeling after drinking"

"Pours a cloudy, golden color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of sweet malt, pale malt, yeast, hint of floral, hint of citrus, and a hint of hop. Fits the style of a Czech Pilsner. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with a high carbonation level. Tastes of pale malt, slight sweet malt, yeast, hint of hops, hint of citrus, and a hint of floral. Overall, good aroma, body, blend, and appearance. Refreshingly crisp and strong in flavor."

"Overall: Picked up a four pack in Wiscoland. Didn't look that closely at the packaging so was not aware that it was pear-infused. It doesn't distract too much from the beer, the pear flavor is there but not overwhelming. An interesting beer."

"O- A really interesting, tasty beer. Digging it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is surprising! There's definitely a pilsner foundation here, but the addition of pear tea and pear juice adds an entirely new dimension. It's a subtle fruit infusion, but wow does this really work well! Wonderful and flavorful, this is one I'll definitely revisit."
""
"O - It's not you're everyday pilsner but that's to be expected with how it was brewed. I like it though, it's refreshing but has a lot more flavour characteristics than your average pilsner."
"Doesn't remind me too much of a Czech Pils, but still quite good. Pear is subdued, which I like. A bit more bitter than traditional. Very good drinking beer. Clean, enough body to stand up to the crispness, without overdoing it. Finish is very nice. Great summer beer, but also good anytime, I suppose."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a solid pilsner with some fruitiness to it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I really enjoyed this beer. I was most impressed by the characteristics brought in by the tea, but the balance was well worth remembering as well. I loved the subtle grapefruit and earthy hop presence that popped in and out. Probably as complex as a lighter beer can get. I've never been much of a Pilsener man, but if I ever get the urge, this is what I'm buying."
""
""
"O - I like this take on a classic Pilsener. The pear juice adds a nice juiciness. Very crisp and refreshing."
""
"Overall: A pretty good twist on a Pilsener. Good grainy malt notes with a very nice juicy kick from the added pear."

"Pours a cloudy peach juice color with a smallish white head that dissipates almost instantly. Aromas of green apple and pear with some sweet bready pilsner malt and a heaping helping of spicy saaz. The flavor is a bit of sweet honey like malt with a solid shot of fruity pomme and some nice spicy hop flavor and a moderate level of bitterness to counter. Medium body and a moderate level of carbonation with a sweet slick mouthfeel. I almost didn't pick up this bottle at the store and now I glad I did. Its a nice pils with a twist."
"Overall: one of the better Pilsners I've had. Though I find myself wanting more pear flavor."
""
""
"O) A tasty pilsener. I think this is my second one..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a clear gold with a tall white head and thick lacing as I drink the glass down. Usually I stay far, far away from lighter lager with fruit, but this is a cool beer. The pear mimics the cool, fruity character of Noble hops, while complementing the sharper, peppery grassy hops. The hops and pear are well balanced in the aroma and flavor. The finish has a little edge, but it's not super dry like many hopped up American-made pilsners."
""
""
""
"Overall: Not a pale ale. Not a bad beer, but not as described."
""
""
"Sometimes they hit the target, and sometimes they hit the target intended for the other person. Mediocre is what it is to me."

"Poured into glass for drinking."

"Low B-"
""
"Definitely worth trying and probably one of the better new DFH offerings I have had in quite some time. The pear juice and tea are not overdone and lend a nice fruity, slight tart flavor over a solid Pilsner base."
""
"A nice looking beer, unfortunately not tasting as good as would be expected by the appearance. The pear juice makes it sweeter but doesn’t make it better. Despite the hype associated with this pils, it’s nothing special, somewhat below average, IMHO. It’s a shame because I was really looking forward to this beer. Just because you can add something to a beer, it doesn’t mean you should."
""
""
""
""
""
"I've had many DFH beers that were good, but none that made me long for their distribution the way this beer has. I really wish this was available to me so I could make it my beer for the next six months. Outstanding."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a white, three-finger head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Clear straw color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Pear and some malt nose, flavor is nearly sweet pear, some background hops. $2.65 for a 12oz bottle from Bert's Better Beers Hooksett NH."
""
""
""
"Overall: I'm not usually a fan of pilsner, but this is a great one. The flavor profile is complex, not dominated by the tea and pear flavors. You can definitely taste the tea though, so if that sounds unappealing to you, avoid this one. Dogfish Head brings the quality I've come to expect from them to a kind of beer you might not expect them to attempt, and they pull it off very well. I'd say that the feel just barely keeps this beer from ""outstanding"" territory, but it's still one of the best pilsners I've ever had."

"Poured a nice cloudy golden color with a one finger white head that receded to a ring of white that left slight lacing down the glass. A very true to style and quite appealing pilsner look. Scents of lager yeast, pear, spicy hops and grainy malt. A good classic Czech pilsner scent, with the nice addition of pear from the pear juice. Flavor begins with a citrus-like sweetness, some pear and a bit of hop bitterness, moving into some bready malt and spicy, herbal hop flavors in the middle alongside some sweet citrus, finishing with herbal hops and grain with an aftertaste of herbal hops and grainy malt. A good, well-rounded pilsner flavor, with some sweetness added from the pear juice, but not enough to overpower the hops and malt. Balanced and refreshing, as a pilsner should be. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate carbonation and a juicy mouthfeel. True to style and very easy to drink. Overall this is a good take on a Czech pilsner, that while not incredibly unique for the style, does offer enough that is different to stand out somewhat. The pear juice adds a dimension of fruity sweetness that works well alongside the traditional pilsner flavors and makes this one quite nice to drink."

"Pours a clear amber. The pear juice, if that is what I am getting, adds an interesting light touch to the beer. Normally I am not too interested in some of the odd stuff Dogfish does. But this works out quite well. Could probably use a lighter overall pilsner character on this, but it works."
""
""
""
"Overall: Very refreshing brew. It lacked complexity in flavor, especially with the hops. It is easy to drink... would be great on a warm afternoon."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a tasty quaffable pilsner."
"o: Very well made, I'm diggin it."
""
""
"Overall this is a pretty solid pils, but nothing is spectacular about it. If you are trying DFH for the first time, stick with one of their IPAs. This is the ""safest"" offering I have had from them and it fits what IMO is an unexciting albeit traditional style to begin with."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pale golden with nice clarity. Good head with ample lacing. Bright and fresh floral, fruity, grass aroma. Solid bready malt balanced by a citric, grassy hop. Hint of pear. Light to medium body. Solid carbonation. Crisp finish. Good planner and slightly different. A little sweet for my taste but still solid."
""
""
"Deep golden hued with excellent clarity and vibrant carbonation. A miniscule layer of carbonation caps off most of the top of the glass. I smell pears and some subtle Saaz hops. I know that's not shocking considering this beer. Mouth is moderately carbonated and you get a bitterness from the hops that also helps to prickle the tongue. This is straightforward with the bitterness of the hops mingling with the sweetness of the pear flavor. I think the carbonation might need some dialing back, but it's a good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"I finally got some pils glasses for valentine's day and wanted to put them to use. Poured the beer and sucked the remaining beer from the bottle and thought I hope it taste better in the glass. From the bottle taste like skunked beer but from the bottle tasted like an excellent pilsner should. Love the beer and my new glasses. Great lacing. Goes down smooth and has many fruity and flowering tastes. Great session beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Apple juice colored, without much of a head. This is my first pilsner. Has a distinct aroma, somewhat skunky. Hoppy, carbonated, with a little bit of sweet fruit and that same distinct taste as the aroma. Overall not bad, but not quite as flavorful as I would hope."

"The beer is golden hued and clear with a small white head. The aroma is grain, alcohol, pear, apple, sweetness. The flavor is simply disappointing. A sweet, corny mess. Another gimmicky, weird beer from Dogfish Head. How about making a quality beer instead of some whacky, one of a kind mess with unusual ingredients? Unique does not equal good. Lacking the qualities that make a pils beer refreshing, quaffable. No thank you."
"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 2013B 1033. Pours moderately hazy golden straw color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big pear, apple, cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance of malt, hop, pear juice, and yeast ester notes; with great strength. Taste of big pear juice, apple, grape, cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Slight earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pear juice, apple, grape, cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, floral, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and robustness of pear juice, malt, hop, and yeast flavors; with a good malt/pear flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. A bit too much sweetness, but still has nice balance. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Czech pilsner style. All around good balance and robustness of pear, malt, hop, and yeast flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Classic Pilsner pour, bubbly, clear, pale, and with a thin head. The looks were nice, but the smell was pretty weak. I could detect lots of carbon dioxide, and a faint int of fruit, but not much in the way of the hops. The taste was much better than the smell, as the hops were clearly present. The pear juice was initially masked under the malt, but the beer was certainly fruitier than a typical Pils. As the beer warmed up, the pear became much more noticeable. Very smooth lager flavor, and fading fruity and hoppy aftertaste. The body was thicker than typical, but still quenching. Carbonation had a bit of a sting to it. The beer became much better when the pear actually manifested itself."
"Was a little nervous upon first whiff but where it matters more to me in taste outweighed that. Haven't had many pilsners so not sure what the pear did to this one. It definitely overtakes the pils malts up front. I'll have this again but probably won't keep these stocked in the fridge."
"O-As it warms it definitely improves. Still an odd choice for a winter seasonal."
"Poured from 355 ml bottle into a Liefmans Goudenband glass (my preferred all purpose beer tasting glass). Tasted on 2/14/14"

"The taste is much like the aroma with a toasted grain and barley flavor and a lemon or citrus zestiness. Clean, dryish finish."
"Pours a bright gold with a head about one inch thick that lasts for a bit. This has a wonderful pilsner - hop smell as soon as you crack the cap. Leaves pretty heavy lacing. The biggest disappointment about this brew to me is that I got no pear notes in the flavor at all. I will say it has a sweet finish to it yet is extremely crisp. I could see this being a great spring or summer review. It is clean going down and very refreshing. Over all a great pilsner, but I just wish the pear notes were clearer."

"O: Glad to see DFH putting out a lager, especially a quirky pilsner like this one. It is a great one for house parties and seems to fit right in. This would seem to be a great beer to get people off macros since it is a lager and by DFH, however it is a seasonal."

"12oz bottle. Pours a semi hazy burnt yellow with an inch of head. Good amount of lacing. The aroma is sweet and sour. Grassy with some pear and herbal and floral hops. The taste is bready with some light pear flavor. Grassy and herbal hop flavors. Light sour green apple as well. Good deal of malts. Sour bread and pear at the finish. The pear flavor seems to be a nice compliment to this style without being too noticeable. Mouthfeel is light and crisp. Pretty refreshing beer. If they ever canned this one it would be a great beach beer. Overall, pretty good twist on the style."

"O- While not my favorite style of beer, this is a good representation of a pilsner. It may be on the sweet side though. I have come to enjoy Dogfish Head brews and this is no exception. I like the creativity and thought they put into their work. A pilsner for sure but like no other. Try it if you have a taste for pilsners, you won't be disappointed."

"Fantastic cakey white head floating over a clean gold beer. Many rising carbonation bubbles mainly along the center of my glass. Aroma is clean pilsner with a little something extra. I don't eat pears that frequently however I do recognize it in the smell. Also fleshy golden apples come to mind. Nice crackery grains and spicy with Pilsner hops. The fruit goes really well with the pilsner aromas. Taste is sweet, crackery, lemony, spicy. The pear is less noticeable however it is there. A nice pilsner overall. Good old forgotten pear is solidly integrated."
"O: Definitely an interesting brew with a nice combination of herbal/floral hops, green tea, and classic pilsener flavors + aromas. No single aspect overwhelms and everything seems in balance but not a beer that I could see myself drinking with any regularity."
""
""
"This is not a fruit beer by any means: it's a Pilsener-plus. That extra sweet/sour element fills a place on the palate that I didn't even know was missing, lightly sharpening the familiar grassy foreground. A little pear is great in a sandwich or salad -- and marvelous in this beer."
"Picked this up looking for a good pils and this did not disappoint. The beer pours a hazy gold color with a two finer head that lingers and leaves a good amount of lacing. The smell is of pear, tea, hops, and some malt. The taste mirrors this with the pear and tea flavors up front and finishes with a nice crisp bitterness. The mouth feel of this beer is medium bodied with just the right amount of carbonation. Over all a really good pils and I would most definitely drink this one again."

"12 ounce bottle, stamp on bottle says bottled on 2013B 1221. Served in a pilsener glass, the beer pours a hazy gold color with an inch white head that stayed around for a very long time. There's also a lot of lacing. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like pears, spicy and floral hops, and some bready malt. I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but there's some white grape and green tea flavors noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's crisp and easy to drink. I think this would be a really good spring/summer beer. I like this and would certainly buy it again. $8.99 a 4-pack."

"The taste is closer to the norm but it is still quite earthy on the tongue. The bitterness is not soft, but I expected that given the name. Smooth body but with an elevated carbonated level. The aftertaste is bitter with a bit of sourness."

"O: The thing to really love about this beer is that it never strays from its identity. It is a pilsner first and foremost. The pear and tea flavors are subtle and supporting, while the base beer, an artfully crafted Czech Pilsner, remains in control. The pear and tea additions were perfectly done, and the beer remains dry overall and true to its roots. This is a fantastic beer. I have to say though, I'd much rather see it in a summer seasonal role rather than a winter one."

"O/D-Not as bad as I thought it would be. I don't enjoy pears all too much. This slightly exceeded my expectations. Still wouldn't buy it again and glad I only copped a single. This should not be in a four pack by the way."
""
""
""
""
""
"I tried this at a tasting and liked it enough to buy a bottle for review. The up-close inspection did not disappoint. I'd like this beer to be a little lighter in color and I'd definitely like it to have a denser, better sustained bloom, but the nice meld of flowery saaz hop flavors and tart, fruity pears is quite distinct. I must admit, I'm not a big fan of Czech Pilsners (I prefer American IPAs). However, I could definitely see myself throwing back a few of these on a hot summer day."
""
"Overall: this is a very easy to drink beer. The flavors are upfront and the fruity component adds some depth. Nice to have a flavorful, non hop-centric beer with a reasonable ABV."
""
""
""
"Crests above two fingers then settles into a nice moderately thick level, good foam density, some surface dimpling, off white to eggshell color, the lacing is wispy but sticks with strength. Mild filminess to the yellow gold colored liquid, light orange tint at the glass edges, the bubbles are few but fat and move at a decent clip, looks richer than your standard pilsner. The pear fruit comes through very clearly on the nose, trace amount of florality would seem sweet were it not for the sale and pepper, dark bread and black tea leaf notes, clean kind of herbaceousness, ends with an allusion to mixed white citrus and metal shavings, not tightly woven as a fabric but nice enough to sniff. Full-bodied, would suspect the juice gives it extra heft, pulls down into the palate, the carbonation is not weak per se but in no position to do much about anything. The pear there yet gets sucked back into the whole by its overall sourness and that earthy, metallic bite. Spicy, especially peppery, herbal but not “green,” tree bark and less breadiness and citrus than might be desired. It does stay as lively as possible through the finish, dry while not excessively so. Some floral lift at the very end. An experiment worth putting into action."
""
""
""
"Surprisingly the pear adds a layer of depth and appreciated sweetness to a pilsner that remains crisp and dry. The bitterness is rather pronounced. I am pleasantly surprised by this beer, shows that DFH can add fruit to a beer and make its presence felt without it being bogged down and cloying."
""
""
"O- Great pils. The pear is hardly noticeable. It just sweetens it a bit."
""
""
"O- I hope this remains on the shelves for summer. I would drink this regularly. unfortunately there seems to be a dearth of American craft breweries producing pilsners. and while I can understand that due to the mass produced stuff from InBev and the like, it's great to see Dogfish ride against the current and say, ""watch this!"" thanks for redeeming the pilsner!"

Highly quaffable... Highly recommended... A fantastic job by DFH..."

"Pretty clear yellow color topped with a delightfully dense, lumpy white head. Plentiful lacing patterns the glass. Fresh grassy and straw-like Saaz hop aroma under a light pear tea sweetness...quite nice and snappy. Definitely more pear in the flavor, but the quality Saaz-iness remains along with a decent fresh cereal grain note. Perhaps a little too much of that sweet, dry pear juice element getting in the way of the Pils qualities. Light, pretty crisp, some acidity. I enjoyed this, but I can't help but feel this is a really nice Czech Pils with some unnecessary fruit added."

"this pilsner is a great twist on the traditional pils. the color is the typical clear golden. the smell is hoppy and earthy. the bitter taste is the story with this one, the addition of the pear really pairs well with the pilsner flavor. i will definitely be buying this one again- especially since its a seasonal. ill be sad when it goes away."

"O: Overall a very enjoyable beer, I am torn between wanting more of the pear character, or being happy with the fruit not overpowering the brew. I like the choice of hops, and this beer seems to show off the style well."
"I have no strong love for pilsners, but when done right, I have no problem drinking one, and the prospect of a pear pils intrigued me. Poured a crystal clear, light golden color, with a thin white head that fizzled out completely, leaving no lacing behind. Pretty blank aroma, thin crackery malts, grains, distant herbal hops. Very disappointingly simple taste of toasted grains, and bitter herbal hops. Absolutely no pear whatsoever, and if it was in there, the graininess totally overpowered it. If it were an old dusty bottle, I'd expect something like this, but this was right out of the tap from the source. Light body, light mouthfeel, lasting bitterness. Pretty unpleasant. Really glad I only got a sampler of this one."
""
"O- Big letdown. No pear and only above average for a pilsner. I even poured the beer into a previously used glass to make sure it's the beer and not the glass that tastes like soap."

""

""

""
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a snifter, golden yellow, thin head. the aroma is bready, fresh grass, highlights the Saab hops. Taste follows the nose. I really do do not pick up the pear juice or pear tea. The body is light and easy to drink. A good pilsner, at 9 bucks a 4 pack it is a bit pricey in my IMO."

"Overall, this is a very unique and tasty beer. Uses could include a refreshing drink with lunch and giving nightmares to european beer purists."

"Overall this is quite enjoyable. The perry/pear softens the pilsner bite at the beginning of the taste then allows it to nip you in the finish. Possibly this beer will launch a new beer style, it works just that well."

"Overall I should have no problem finishing the four pack but will not seek it again. Not the biggest fan of the style but this was quite good. Love trying dogfish's experimental brews."
"Overall an enjoyable enough beer. I am glad I tried it because it was a little different. I will revisit again, but it was not a beer I have to have."
""
""
""
"A very nice flavorful pils. Balanced and goes down easy. The fruit addition is a nice touch which gives it a little sweetness without masking a very good pilsner base. Definitely worth trying."
""
""
""
"O-a very difficult beer to hate. it's crisp and smooth, so easy to drink. it has such a high quality flavor, that really makes me want to go out and find more. it definitely tastes like a DFH beer, but it stays simple enough to remind you of a true european pilsner. the more i drink it, the more i like it."

"On the lighter end of medium body with a blast of bitter, grassy hops that lingers over the pale malt, light fruit notes and subtle herbal tea presence into a dry finish. Again, the saaz hops really stand out with dry, sticky bitterness, earthy grass and pine needle flavor. This is countered by hints of bread, biscuit, apple and pear. The tea adds an odd metallic, medicinal note that lingers long after the finish. Pear flavor doesn't stand out much more than the ester-y notes of a traditional example of the style. I wasn't sure what to expect going in but this was a pretty tame experiment. Very similar to classic czech pils with plenty of grassy hop bitterness and a touch more light fruit sweetness than usual. The only element that negatively stands out is the astringent, herbal tea character. Unfortunately, this negatively affects the flavor and hurts drinkability. Still, this is an okay beer that's easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A good beer and quite good but I can't see myself buying a case."
"Overall: This definitely isn't as sweet as I'd been lead to believe by reading about it. It's just a heavier, slightly sweeter Pilsner. Definitely still great for sessioning, I could see having a bunch of these around for a game with my buddies, and still being able to function(somewhat) after imbibing."
"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a clear golden amber with a half finger, white head with good retention and light lacing. Aroma of pear juice, biscuit malt, light grassy hops. Flavor is sweet biscuit malt, pilsner hops with a light floral grassy character, light pear flavor, but not the sweetness expected from pear juice. Nice. Medium bodied. A very nice take on the pilsner style, capturing the aroma and taste of Sasz hops, but adding a light, but pleasant pear flavor. The fruit is handled deftly, making this a quite enjoyably drinking ale. Not strictly traditional, but good."
"o - overall, a pretty cool take on a pilsner. would love to dial back the sweetness and the pear a bit since it becomes a bit much as i really dig into the beer making it less of a sessionable brew that i'd have several of in a night (which is the main reason i'd drink a pilsner). definitely worth checking out and a welcome addition to the dfh catalog."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy honey orange with a foamy beige head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, grass, and slight fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with sweet fruit and grass flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a crisp and refreshing flavor, but I am not getting any distinct pear qualities in the aroma or flavor."
""
""
"O: A nicely balance beer where the fruit and tea additions compliment the quality base beer style instead of overwhelming it as is often the case."
""
""
""
"A great beer, but I think it would have almost been better without the pears, because I can't tell what it adds A very good pilsner nonetheless."
""
"This is actually a pretty good representation of the Czech Pils style...with some added pear pulp of course."
"Overall: Another good one from Dogfish Head. The pear additions compliment the typical pilsner flavors nicely. Worth a try even if you're not a big pilsner fan."
""
"Overall - Rather smooth and easy drinking, safe beer from dfh. Would have liked a little more saaz hop flavor but in all, pretty well balanced and a fine drink."
"12oz. bottle served in a small schooner. Pours a translucent honey-gold with a head that quickly dissipates into a thin band around the shoulders and a soapy slick across the surface. Some spots of lacing revealed during the tasting, but exhibiting weak adhesion. Nose expresses biscuity malts, a light, sour mash quality and under-ripe pear. Taste follows nose. Mouthfeel is light and lively with a kiss of acidity. Overall, lacking the cleanliness of a traditional Czech Pils, but an interesting take on the style, nonetheless."

"I think DFH knocked one out of the park with this one. I am usually not a huge pilsner fan (although I generally like them) this has the pils characteristics I really like, and I think the addition of pear juice and tea is just the right amount to ass something new and different without being too much."
"A unique and delightful pilsner. The initial sip may have you thinking you're drinking a tasteless, almost watery adjunct lager, but then the building rush of pear and malt pairings along with the excellent hop bitterness quickly dispels any misgivings. Deceptively light in character yet strongly fulfilling with each drink."
"This is a very successful beer, and it should not be thought of as a fruit beer - the enhancements are subtle and tastefully done."

"excellent four pack release from dogfish head. pear juice, pear tea, and saaz hops, a nice combination in a pils. don't crucify me for this, but I have always thought the basic euro pilsener was missing something. not stylistically or anything, but from a flavor standpoint they bored me for the most part. this one doesn't. its also the first pear beer ive had that isn't perfumed to high heaven rendering it unpalatable after a few sips. this is clean and light and bright and fun and balanced and everything you could want in a neo-Czech style. the saaz hops are also the perfect companion to this, they are so fresh and potent, yet classic at the same time. I could not imagine any other variety here, its a perfect marriage. it has a little too much body for a pils, which I guess from the color, honey colored with a nice white head but a density unbecoming to the style. it works though, and gives the herbal pear/tea combination something to hold on to. worthy sauce for sure right here, the pear is subtle and not sweet at all, which makes great sense in a dryer and crisper style. I know the style gurus will have a field day bashing dogfish head for yet another ""off centered ale", but this one really does work, and certainly doesn't warrant the criticism I can see it facing. really an innovative and well executed brew."
""
"O: Glad to see DFH putting out a lager, especially a quirky pilsner like this one. It is a great one for house parties and seems to fit right in. This would seem to be a great beer to get people off macros since it is a lager and by DFH, however it is a seasonal."

"O: I expected a pear pilsener, instead I got a beer that is not quite fruity nor a typical pilsener - reminded me a little of some of DFH's wine/beer work. I was ready either for a crisp, tight brilliant pilsener OR a ""fruitified"" pilsener (well, maybe that's what this is...). Seems DFH toned down the pear flavors so as to avoid creating a too-sweet pilsener, because it wasn't too sweet (which would have been a critical flaw), but it did take on a white wine-like sweetness over time (as it warmed). I had hoped it would be less ""well-rounded"" (as if that's a flaw), and something a little with a little more bite or zing. An interesting/atypical profile for the style. I think that fans of DFH's wine-hybrid beers would like this, but some hardcore pilsener fans might not find it crisp enough. I won't return to it, but I definitely recommend it."
"They should definitely put this beer in 6 packs and make it year round as one of their lighter easier drinking beers to turn even more people on to better beer."
"As for pilsners it's one of the better domestic made ones, but surprisingly pretty basic tasting if strangely muted for all the crazy sensations I would expect from a Dogfish beer. How about that, an exotic DF beer with obscure ingredients that just comes out about normal? Who knew but there you have it, but I prefer a traditional pils than this, but this is a good offering."
""
"Overall: as usual, an interesting take from Dfh. Glad I tried it. Probably won't be a staple."

"Piercing Pils is a fantastic beer... for the 4th of July. As a seasonal, they're about a half calendar off. In order to suit the winter season better,the brewers should strive for a ""spiced"" pear character, not just banal pears."

"When i poured this beer it had a cloudy gold color body with a small head. The aroma has a lemon and malt smell. The taste has a citrus hop upfront followed by the malty bread. Then on the finish the sweetness of the pear comes through slightly. The mouth feel is nice and overall a good prisoner. Let it warm up a little bit to get some pear."
""
"Decent base beer, and the nuances are fairly subtle. I like the crackery malt character, but I'm not a fan of the tea notes."

"This beer is definitely piercing on the tongue, with an assertive crispness. It's nice for a pils, and it doesn't fall of. It's also not a cover for lack of depth in the feel. It still has some smoothness and a few layers to get through in its light to medium body."

"Overall: A nice and refreshing beer. The pilsner base is tasty. The pear comes through at the end and as it warms so that this is different enough from other pilsners. I would buy this year round as it is one of the better DFH beers I have had in some time."
"Dogfish generally can do no wrong. Until now. This pours a typical pilsner color with a large head that drops quickly but also leaves some sticky lacing. The smell is typical pilsner (bread notes from the malt as well as hops) along with a citrus note. The taste is, well, a mess, at least in the finish. It starts off quite good, with cracker/bread flavors from the malt and a good amount of hop presence too, but the pear just doesn't blend well. It seems to make the beer taste 'fresh"" and it certainly is original, but the flavor doesn't work with anything here. Overall, this would be a much better beer without the pear, as the simple pilsner flavors seem to be in place without the fanciness. At around $10.00/4 pack, I'm glad I tried it only because it's a Dogfish brew, but I'll never look for it again."
"Overall: It's pears, it's pils, it's okay. At least it's a nice change of pace from the typical wintertime fare."

"O - Nice unique take on the pils that is def worth a shot."

"Mellow gold body with floaty milky head on top. Aroma of saaz, light pear, and fresh springtime bloom. Tastes of pear, floral notes, some more mouth-puckering light fruits, and vague honey sweetness and booze in the back. Light bodied with light carbonation. Looks great, smells good, tastes is sweet but unfulfilling."
""
"The taste is more Czech-style that fruit-style, which is good, but I personally miss the dryer bite I expect later in the taste. It is replaced by what I pick up a little more clearly as pear, which does conflict with the bitter hops a bit to produce what to me was an off-taste, although it was brief as the fruit taste took over fairly quickly."
"Alcohol? It's here but I never felt it and I'm sure that if I had all 4 bottles in a sitting, I would notice the booze kicking in a bit. While not a session beer, this may as well be since it's so easygoing that more than one could be downed in a sitting. While not on the level of the Victory Prima Pils, this was a great take on the style that doesn't get a lot of love in colder months of even when it comes to ratings. A mellow brew from Dogfish that was unlike anything else in their current lineup and worth a go for someone looking for a alternative to what's currently available this holiday season."

"The feel is very clean and crisp despite being a medium bodied beer. Overall, I think that Dogfish has a winner in this pilsner. I certainly enjoyed this beer and recommending getting it if they want something light."
"Strange, i don't usually like pears but there is this delicious bright fresh pear taste but there's also this hoppy bright bitterness as well. Can't tell if they go well together though. Starts with this delicious pear fruity flavors. Light to Medium bodied with brisk refreshing carbonation. leads to this earthy bitter citric rind hop flavor. The flavors dont really blend together well but they dont oppose eachother. Interesting yet strange, once your tongue gets acclimated to both flavors they seem to come together nicely. What's pulled apart at first comes together half way through, refreshing, semi-sweet yet with a clean crisp bitterness. Would i call it a czech pilsner? definitely not, the fruitiness of this beer makes it much different but it does have those qualities. I like it, a unique take on the ""style"" but not to be compared to others in the style."

"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and a good example of Czech Pilsener with a slight twist to it that was light enough to not cover up the true flavors of the style and I thought that made for some nice balance. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, clean, crisp, not filling and the taste did a decent job at holding my attention, I could drink a couple of these without getting bored with it. What I liked the most about this beer was how true to style it was, besides the pear it was a pretty by the book Czech Pilsener. What I liked the least about this beer was that it was released this time of the year, I think a summer release would much better suit this beer. I don't know if I would buy this beer again since it's fairly pricey for a Czech Pilsener, but I'm sure I would buy at least a bottle or two if the weather was warm. I would recommend this beer to anybody who likes the style. All in all I enjoyed this beer, going into it I didn't know what to expect, Dogfish Head can be a little unpredictable sometimes but this turned out to be a good straight forward Czech Pilserner with a light pear aspect, It might be nice to have a little more pear flavor, but that might cover up some of those good Czech Pilsener flavors, so I think it was fine just the way it was. Good job Dogfish Head, this was a pretty solid and easy drinking beer, keep up the good work."
"Overall, good interesting pils."
"Overall - I applaud Dogfish Head for making this pilsner. Its crisp and adventurous and very flavorful. Releasing in the early winter is fine and makes a nice departure from the heavy beers of norm this time of year. Its very hoppy and 6% is a little high so its not quite a summer lawnmower beer. I'd drink this one any time of year though. Nice job."
"O- A very nice version of a style that I am a fan of and wish more American breweries worked as hard to nail this style as they do stouts and IPAs. The pear gives it that extra Dogfish Head quality of something different in there that really is not over done. Would like to catch this on-tap some time."

"Piercing Pils a beer I've wanted to try since I heard about the pear juice and pear tea additions. Pours a brilliant golden color with bright fluffy white head, I've been drinking DFH pils since the Prescription Pils, Golden Shower, Golden Era, and the latest My Antonia. I liked them all by the way, nice to see a 6% abv on a pils from them that has Saaz hops backing it all up. Aroma has an earthy herbal note, but not much in the way of actual pears. More Saaz, earthy, citrus, cut grass qualities with a nice bready malt back bone. Flavor has some pear essence, and more earthy herbal tea bitterness too bad most of the pear sweetness was fermented out here. As a whole it's a nice full bodied pils with easy drinkability, a bit off centered but much less so than some of their crazy adjuncts they usually put out there. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied with sturdy carbonation goes down great with every sip. Overall no complaints noted here, I'm a fan of this pils as well but don't expect it to re-invent the wheel."

"O: A nice complex pilsner. The pear (both juice and tea) really adds a nice dimension to a good pilsner base. Extremely easy to drink and quite quaffable. Good value at under $9 for a 4-pack. Recommended if you like a good pils"

"Overall: Definitely a refreshing beer. The pear is subtle but makes this beer interesting and doesn't detract in my opinion. Well picked combination of flavors that work together for a nice, mild, crisp beer."

"First, pilsners are not my go to style so take this review with a grain of salt and the knowledge that it may be more affected by my other tastes than it actually being true to style. First, it pours pretty much exactly like I would expect a perfect pilsner to: absolutely clear light golden with a fluffy white head that sticks to the glass, and perpetual effervescing bubbles rising from everywhere. Smell was pretty standard, a bit hoppier than most. Couldn't really pick out much pear odor. Taste has some pear sweetness up front, going to some bread and malt in the middle. Some faint spice and notes of tea left on the aftertaste. Feel is light, with crisp carbonation. Overall, for someone who doesnt' really like pilsners, this isn't bad. The hops and pear and subtle sweetness bring some good complexity. Definitely try if you are a fan of the style, and consider it if you're not!"
"Overall one of my favorite pilseners to date. Remove the pear from the equation and this would be an amazing bohemian pilsener. The pear however is another DFH unorthodox win. It ups the alcohol and complexity to deconstruct a classic while mostly holding true to its roots."

"Pear taste is mild but has a sweet essence up front with a nice mix of pear and pilsner malt with subtle hops and herbal floral qualities adding dimension to the perry component. with mild fruit taste and tangy yeast with mostly dry and hop flavored finish. Overall this was an excellent hybrid of styles. I am a fan of pear and was pleased to try this, I probably could have enjoyed several but there were 13 other great beers to try -nice mellow sweetness and hop freshness"
