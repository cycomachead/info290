"Not my favorite from Great Divide, and not my favorite Pilsner. Still a beer that I would drink every now and then."

"Pours clear pale golden straw yellow producing 2 fingers of clumpy, variously bubbled, somewhat lasting, white head that diminishes to islands of dense foam & patchy lacing. Aroma classic pilsner, crisp & dry, clean bready grain, lemon,  grassy hops. Taste is  grain/pale malt, cracker/biscuit,  lemony, grassy noble hops, peppery finish with a heavy & lingering bitterness. Dry, clean & very drinkable. Very pleasant, but an overly bitter example of the style. But what the hell, I crave the bitterness of Noble (Saaz) hops & don't care."

"The taste is good with plenty of herbal and spiced elements from the hops with mild bready yeast and malt support with light fruity and earthy accent, almost woody hop taste as it finishers with a peppery quality which is somewhat dry . This is a very decent Czech style pilsner-very drinkable lager w/ excellent hop flavor -recommended."

"A really good pilsner, possibly one of my favorites in this style.  Very thirst-quenching and very easy to drink either on its own or with food."

"Beer #2 on a great divide sampler night. Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has bright yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some malts, sweetness. Taste is smooth and refreshing. Malts, grains, grassy hops at the finish. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a good session beer."

"O:  At 5.4% abv a tad strong for a pils but quite drinkable. Maybe not a repurchase but pretty interesting and good."

"o: its an alright pilsner. its got quite a bitter bite which makes it real crisp against the grains in here. its smooth and easy to drink. not my favorite pilsner, but still worth picking up for an afternoon on the porch"

"The Nomad is a solid offering from Great Divide. The beer poured a clear crisp yellow with thin white head that is leaving a spotty lace. The scent has some grain and biscuit flare. The taste is slightly sharp and grain and alcohol definitely present. The mouthfeel is lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall the beer is solid and worth a try for those that enjoy pilsners."

""
""
""
"Overall – Seems like a pretty bang on example of the style. I wouldn't mind a little more hop bite, but solid nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It's great for the style. It's better than some Pilsners made in CZ. I would recommend this for anyone wishing to try a Pilsner for the first time. Very easy to drink."
""
"O - After passing over it a few times, I'm glad that i finally picked one up."
""
""
""
""
"O: it is a fine tasting, refreshing lager easily beyond your BMC. It's a little sweeter and more complex, but I think it's missing that transition to bitter and/or dry."
""
""
""
"O- a really tasty pilsner"
"A none-too shabby go at the Czech Pilsener - they nailed the crispness, in malt and in hops - but the flavours seem too muddled and indistinct to have it run with the Bohemian greats - be they Old Word or not."
""
""
"A Czech Pils all the same, but aside from a confusing aromatic experience, one can get in-tune with this Great Divide seasonal. A strange choice for a colder season brew, but it has its charm if you have the patience to discover it for yourself."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I'm on the pils/lager stint until GABF, and was looking longingly at a few hoppy brews I had in the fridge. This satisfied my longing. But at the same time, it just seems a bit overly hoppy for a traditional pils. But on the same hand it is a good American twist. I could see grabbing a six pack of this and having a few around the fire on a muggy night during a camp out. It was good. Just prepare for quite a hoppy pils."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a tasty pils."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a pretty solid pilsner, but it's nothing spectacular. Would definitely like it to be a bit more crisp and refreshing for hot summer days, but otherwise it's pretty good. Not worth the price at $2.50 a single though."
""
"O - A very good pilsner, one of the better light pilsners I have come across. Probably great on a hot summer day."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I really, really enjoy this beer. Nicely balanced, and light enough to have a few but not so light it leaves you wanting more. I would totally get this again."
""
""
""
"O: a great beer - I'm not a pilsener drinker regularly, but a beer like this is the kind that makes you appreciate a style. Real bright and crisp, with the grains accentuated nicely by the hops. I toned down some of my scores out of deference to my lack of experience with the style, because I was ready to assign some pretty glowing values. I can certainly say this: No reason not to grab some if you see 'em on the shelf."
""
""
""
"O: A good attempt at a style that is very tough to perfect. It's very drinkable, but not quite as elegant and refined as it needs to be to go toe to toe with the best in the category."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a very tasty brew. If I could get this in Georgia, this would probably be one of my go to pils. This might be the best Great Divide beer that I have had to date."
""
"O: Easy to drink and just on the cusp of being sessionable, I enjoyed it and it was interesting with the slightly more hoppy flavors and enough complexity."
""
"I know when I think pilsner, I think the desert. Anyway, this stuff pours a clear sunset straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises flowers, grass, very light white grape skin, and some light biscuit. The taste brings in more of the same, with heavier flowers and a touch of sulfur in the background and in the finish. Reminds me almost of a Burton-ish character. The body straddles the line between hefty light and light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a solid pils, not the best the States have put forth, but a nice one regardless."
""
"O: A fairly run-of-the-mill Czech pilsner -- solid but nothing special."
""
""
""
""
"O- Nothing spectacular, but a nice pilsner that works really well in the spring. Enjoyable. I really liked the spiciness to it"
""
""
""
"O-nice, light, and refreshing. pretty solid brew for the style"
"O: I liked this beer because it wasn't bland or boring and imparted lots of complex aromas and flavors from the hops. It is rather easy to drink."
"So far, one of my favorite American versions of a pilsner. A really wonderful job."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fresh lager is a good thing, and being just 2 months from being bottled, you can tell it tastes fresh. It's not BIG in flavor like Titan IPA, this is a relaxed, easy to approach pilsner. A netural cracker and floral note hit first. Dry cracker and a little grass midway, finished with an herbal and pleasant bitterness. It's light bodied with a pleasant crisp body...gulp, I'm done! That'll hydrate me :-)"
"I like."
""
"Overall: A pretty solid Pilsener. Its what you expect from the style. Solid balance."
""
""
"It is extremely easy to drink and typical of the style meant to be a session beer. This would be great to pound at a party or on the deck over the summer, and what it lacks in the flavor that you’d expect from Great Divide it makes up with drinkability. I enjoyed it, but would not go out of my way to buy a 6 pack of it. I will grab one if it's in the cooler though..."
""
"D- It's alright. I would not recommend it as a pilsner though, there are many better versions. Typically I find you can't go wrong with Great Divide. In this case, I would recommend against this brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"All in all this is still quite good, and I would be proud to have brewed it. However my experience of Great Divide has never been anything less than stellar, so I was hoping for a world class pils. This doesn't strike me as world class (which would be a feat indeed), but it is altogether worthy of the glass of any beer advocate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was very disappointing. It was far too sweet and showed many flaws. The mouthfeel was thin and coupled with the poor flavor it greatly brought down the drinkability. I definitely won't be picking this up again."
"Overall: Tastes more like a standard Euro pale lager than a specifically Bohemian pilsner. Could use a breadier malt body. Decent, not great."
"A prominent off-white head results from a furious of bubbles. Retention is excellent. Color is a pure and clear yellow-orange. Smells of dry hay , crisp and sharp, but with a little must where some water leaked through the barn roof. Subtle light fruits are smelled in the distance. Tastes of fruit and straw with a grainy backbone. Smooth with just enough bitterness to balance well. Dry and light bodied. What we have here is a good, standard lager."
""
"O - A mineral and chalk taste is not my favorite, so this is a bit of a drawback for me. Other elements of the beer are good. It's a good representation of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This brew is a pretty simple example of the style. Flavors are not terribly complicated or intense and the whole package was a little rough-hewn, but this was not a bad session-type beer (I say session type because the ABV is above 5%). A few more hops would have helped balance the cracker/biscuit malts in this brew, but if you're looking for an easy-drinking pils to quaff during the game, this is not a bad option."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Decent flavor, above average regards, just lacks the grainy pilsner character, more like a american blonde body, needs that more disticnt grainy feel and taste. Decent drinkability, tart lemon nature."
""
""
"Retried it in Boston on tap. This time, closer to style but there's more skunkiness to the smell."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D/O: This beer presents sensory qualities in heaps; some good and a few questionable. Its pilsner core is solidly constructed around light malt qualities that do not disappoint. It appears to be a better version of a Bavarian pilsner, with a hops edge that seems a little blunted. Still, it is one of Great Divide's better stylistic examples, aside from basic Yeti."
"Overall: Not great, but still fine, quaffable, and reasonably balanced."
"Fans of Sons of Anarchy may remember that being a nomad is not the way to go in that subculture, but a Pilsener on a hot summer's day may be just the ticket! Color me wandering, but not lost. I lost no time in popping the cap and getting it into a glass. Soon, I had two-plus fingers of solid, bone-white head with good retention that resembled the top of a vanilla ice cream cone. Color was an ever-so-slightly-hazy pale lemon-yellow. Nose was crisp with the Saaz hops front and center in evidence. Now this was what I was looking for! Mouthfeel was soft, not an overabundance of carbonation in the mouth and the taste was a good commingling of the grassiness of the hops with the counterbalance of the malt. Finish was semi-dry, refreshing and very welcomed in the humidity of the day."
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, this was bottled in January. This pours s clear straw color with s large white head. The smells are of grass hops, bread hops. The feel is medium. The taste is okay, a little earthy hop bite and clean malts to wash it down."
"Slightly hazy, golden straw colored body with a white head, minimal lace. Smell is cut hay, earth, biscuits. Taste is crackers, slight lemon, floral, wet, refreshing. Medium well crafted body with complimentary level of carbonation. Very, very nicely balanced, tasty brew. Would be easy and enjoyable to knock back several of these."
""
"The beer pours a very clear straw color with a white head. The aroma is heavy on the pilsner malt with some grass and biscuit notes thrown in. The flavor is similar, with a ton of classic pilsner malt taste. There is also a little bit of grass and earth and a low to medium amount of bitterness. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
"Medium bodied with a crisp, dry hop bite that provides some nice earthy bitterness which lingers over the earthy notes, sweet light fruit and pale malts.  Hints of pine, hay and straw followed by sweet apple and pear, bread and biscuity malt.  Really well balanced, refreshing and extremely quaffable."
""
""
"Pours a hazy pale golden hue which leaves a two finger head and lacing here and there,the smell is what you want in a nice pils with aromas of grassy herbal hops,freshly cut grass,honey malts and citrus leaves,the mouthfeel is just over light bodied and very sessionable with tastes identical to smell with hints of herbal grassy hops,lemongrass,honey,lavender and finished with a floral zestiness and overall i like this one of the better Pilsners ive tasted in ages and would be the perfect companion to a nice seafood dinner cheers."
""
""
""
""
""
"Crisp, refreshing, and well carbonated, cleansing palate through and through. Hoppy, earthy, and crackley. Lightly toasted malt, and unmalted barley flavor. This beer is one of the best czech pilsners I've ever had. Will buy again and recommend!"
""
""
"Nothing really jumps out and says drink more of this beer, so I think I'll have to pass on buying any more of it."
"Poured a clear straw color with a thinner but well sustained bone white head atop,a big shot of herbal/leafy hops really comes out during the pour,mild bready notes undereath.The palate doesn't have quite the assertive hoppiness with some grassy and lighter herbal notes,a firm bready malt base is nice.This is a very well made pilsner,I like the hoppy nose and firm bready malt flavors.Kind of an odd winter seasonal because this is something I would wanna drink while grilling or just hanging around outside."
""
""
""
"Overall, really enjoyed this one and recommend if you can get it. Could see this going down nice and refreshing on a hot Texas summer day. Available here in Texas. Rotation - 6xer or 2 during the summer and maybe occasional single in the WTH mix six. [O;Y]"
""
"D: drinks really clean and refreshing. a nice stab at the bohemian pils style here."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, very refreshing and enjoyable, I'd easy have another."
"This is a really nice and refreshing pilsener. A little cleaner than some of the other samples of the style, but it is a very refreshing beer. This could be a great gateway beer for your lager loving friends and family. It's straightforward, but done quite well."
""
""
"Beer is medium to light in body, a little sweet and grain on the finish, a mild bitterness and hop presence, It is OK but not great, I do enjoy it though. I may have it again."
"Nomad is a pretty decent Czech Pilsner. The only slight change I’d suggest is to tone down the spiciness a little. It is quite intense and seems to mask or overpower some of the other flavors (pilsner malt, yeast, and hops primarily). It would probably be a little more enjoyable if those other elements were given more room to shine. Still a pretty good beer though. Worth checking out."
""
""
""
"O: Nothing overly groundbreaking here, but still a simple, enjoyable pilsner."
"Overall, not a bad summer beer. But there is a bitterness in there that sticks to you after a few beers. Not a great session brew."
""
"Not real exciting to look at... pours a clear gold with a finger of white head if you force it. Beading is decent. Nose is pretty clean. Some soft, sweet malts. Sort of a stale hop presence. The taste is pretty much all malt with some abstractly bitter hops. Light caramel, some cereal... hops catch up in the end with some herbal Earl Gray. Not too bad. Easy to drink. Quite unexciting though."
""
"Fresh hoppiness up front with light malts, roasted almonds, herbal hops flavor (leafy), and a smooth back end."
"On the palate, it's overhopped for the style, lending a prominent bitterness, earthy and lemony with some zest with not enough of a hop flavor. The mid-palate has the malt profile, not as doughy as the nose would suggest. The overhopped nature doesn't help either. A touch of sweetness, mildly corn-like, right before the strong, bitter finish. Light in body with crisp carbonation, this is quite refreshing on the palate. The flaws of the nose aren't as apparent on the palate, with the metallic character not quite noticeable. Not quite true to style (too crisp, too hopped) this is still quite enjoyable, I can see myself drinking this again."
"Decent pils with good flavor,attractive set up with the malt bill though hop presence could be tightened up some. Not sure what that metallic taste is on the finish but it does fade rather quickly."
""
"Overall this is a really really good Pils. For this being 3+ months old the hop bite is still excellent for the style. I will have to find this for the first of the season tailgate when it is 105 degrees!"
""
"Time to try GD's Nomad Pils. Poured from bottle dated 1/6/2012 to a flute the beer pours a crystal clear straw yellow with a nice 2 finger white bubbly head, good retention and lacing. Looks inviting. The nose is a blend of pilsner malt, earthy hops, and a bit floral. The flavor builds on the nose for a nice flavor: pilsner malt base from which the earthy hops lay a mild bitterness, lemon and honey sweetness provide a hint of sweetness to balance. Very nice. Finishes with a mild bitterness and lingering lemon sweetness. Better than anticipated. Lighter end of medium bodied with good carbonation. Overall, this was a treat if a surpise. Not my favorite style though this is a beer I could drink a lot of from brewery that I think could do better. This is a step in the right direction! Recommended."
"Overall - a very fulfilling pilsner to me. Loved this one quite much."
"A nice aggressive pilsner with just a slightly rough edge to it. Plenty bitter with grass, citrus pith, and lemon zest hop flavors that hit the palate dead on. Malt is lean, letting the hops shine. Properly dry, which is critical. Another good effort by Great Divide."
"C+"
"Great pils! I hope I can find this fresher, but this 2 month+ old pils is damn tasty& easy to session on..."
"O - Very enjoyable. If you dig earthy and natural tasting beers then this is a good choice."
"D ~ I think this is a very well executed Pils that, while being a tad ""green," is very balanced. Supreme American flair, but with a focused Idea in mind"
""
"Overall nicely done but not perfected, could use some drying on the finish, the hops get a bit overly on the finish but not too much, a nice perception of soft and complex decoction like makes, and nice toasty cracked straw pilsner malts. Tasty and drinkable."
""
""
"O- Very good pilsner. Light, smooth and perfect beer for spring/summer."
"Overall a really nice hoppy pilsner that would make a great summer sipper. Makes me wonder why it came out in January but oh well. The weather is warm enough today to enjoy this beer."
"D - I had no problem drinking the 12oz bottle. It's a solidly made Czech Pilsener but not something of which I'd purchase a whole six-pack. Still, might make a nice palate cleanser at the bar, or be a good beer to have around for a craft n00b - my dad would probably like this."
"Unseasonably warm in Chicago? Why not do something uncharacteristic and buy a pilsner! Very pale yellow pour with a quite fluffy white head. Smells of grassy grains with a bit of the herbal hop to come. It finishes dry, if not exactly crisp, and starts with that grain sweetness and a very fresh hop presence. A fairly respectable pilsner, although I'm not sure if I'll remember it."
"12oz bottle, pours pale golden yellow with a nice fluffy white head that holds good retention and leaves all kinds of sticky lacing down the entire glass. Aromas are pilsner malt, grassy, and citrusy. Tastes are pilsner malt, grainy, lemon grass, herbal hop, and slightly nutty. Mouth-feel is creamy and smooth with a fairly sharp hop bite on the finish, but still goes down smooth and clean; easy to drink. Overall, nice take on the style. Better than expected."
"O: Fantastic Pilsner! Easily drinkable and refreshing with a perfect hop bite.. A great summer beer that would please anyone."
""
""
"Overall worth a second look but really not my first choice. These guys get props since even the best brewery can overlook a good pilsner."
""
"O - This is a nice bitter pils. No surprise that Great Divide did a good job on this one."
"Light to medium feel, lower carbonation, earthy hops at first with a grassy, floral character. Crisp and dry, very clean. Showcases the noble hop very well, lending a light earthy bitterness of summer weeds without sacrificing the drinkability. Exceedingly dry and not sweet tasting at all. Overall a great balanced euro pilsner, one i'll pick up a six of next time I see it."
"Picked up a single at Euro Market in Queens. It poured clear gold with a white head. The aroma and flavor both hold a strong, but not overpowering herbal, spicy hops character. With the pale, toasted barley, there's almost a dry oak taste. It's a bit hoppier than more pilsners from Bohemia, but it's not as hoppy as a number of American versions, such as Victory's Prima Pils or Avery's Joe. I'm sorry to hear this is a seasonal. I'd love to have a few pints on a hot day, but I'll take it on this unseasonably warm March day."
""
""
"Pours a clear light yellow with a 1 inch foamy white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Thin foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt/grain, grassy/herbal notes, and a hint of skunk. Taste is of toasty malt/grain and big earthy, grassy, and herbal flavors. There is a somewhat assertive level of bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good pilsner but the skunky aroma I am getting is not too pleasant."
""
"Notes: A solid drinkable Pilsner for any time of year. Cheers."
"This was definitely a decent take on a Czech Pils, with a crisp spicy bite that leaves an impression and this overall being clean and smooth feeling on the palate. I’d drink another."
"Overall, decent hops but very vegetal and sweet."
"Overall – not extremely interesting, but not dull and not bad-tasting either."
""
"Overall for a crisp pilsner sort of drinks real well with some dense body unlike most Czech Pils I've had. Sure I could have another."
"Pours a pale gold with good head and lacing. Aroma is grassy and grainy with a hint of corn, but not unpleasant. Taste is bitter spicy hops and grainy malt. Nice crisp mouthfeel typical of a good pilsener. Back before I discovered ales I would've loved this beer - very good for the style."
"Pours a slightly hazed golden hue with a bright white head forming thick, even bands of lacing left behind. I love a good pils, I hope this holds up the bottle mentions a full 5 weeks of lagering which hopefully brings some good results. Aroma earthy herbal citrus notes with a mild grassiness amongst a pale malt breadiness that just works. You may call it one dimensional but I think it's great. Flavor has adequate bitterness, fresh green hops a bit of sulfur/skunkiness going on but it's muted nicely an citrus lemony herbal grassiness. Pale malts provided a toasted biscuit sweetness that really works, finishes dry with each sip. Mouthfeel is crisp clean unadulterated good drinking lager, lighter bodied with sturdy carbonation. Overall a great American brewed version of a pils, I'm not used to see great ones coming out of Colorado or anywhere out west really. I'm spoiled living near PA where there seems to be a neverending supply of tasty lagers."
""
"I can buy the real thing for less though, so I won't bother with this one again."
""
"Pours out a hazy golden color with a large head. Aroma is nice, noble hops and pilsner malts. Well-done, but nothing special. That also carries over to the taste, this is just a well-done Czech Pils with maybe just a little more hops than normal. Clean and citrusy. The mouthfeel is nice, it's got a bit of substance at first, but it's nicely drying at the end. The drinkability is very good. Overall, it's a good pilsner, a great option if you're in the mood for the style."
"O- Yeah, it’s crisp and refined like a pilsner should be, but lacks the flavor needed to make drinking it feel worthwhile. I’m beginning to think I just may not like Saaz hops because Nomad was brewed with them exclusively and it's the usual hop variety used to make Czech pilsners; a style which I rarely enjoy. At least I'm learning."
""
"The appearance of this beer is the only thing that's not impressive. Its a nice, crisp, and flavorful Czech style pilsner that will be awesome once the weather gets a bit warmer."
"O: There we have it: Great Divide = Great Beer. European styles can be hard to emulate, and even harder to make memorable; but these guys, fortunately, definitely know how to do it. And though this is my least favorite Great Divide Euro-style beer so far, I’d buy a sixer of this in a heartbeat."
""
"Overall, this stuff is great for a light but flavorful drink. Clean and well made in the Great Divide style. It would be interesting to taste it with a Victory or some other domestic Pils. The Nomad is quite rich with flavors. Label says bottled January 24 2012."
""
"The flavor is very similar to the nose, with a seriously pronounced grassy/herbal/vegetal taste: lots of flowers, grass, dandelion, etc. Spicy yeast and doughy malt also add a bit of backbone to this very crisp lager. The hop profile is definitely on the bitter side, which adds a bit of 'snap' to the beer, but can be a bit too assertive for some drinkers."
""
""
"drinkability: this is one of the best pilsners Ive had and I lived in Prague. This was a homerun"
""
"This is a very mild Czech Pilsner, missing much of the saaz hops I've had in other Czech Pilsners. Still, it is a pleasant brew and worth a try."
"Nice, went well with some aged cheddar"
"This one started off promising but I didn't quite enjoy the balance of flavors. Solid brew but I could have used a little more hops to balance."
""
"A well done pilsener, fairly subtle flavors, but easy drinking and enjoyable."
"O: I am a bit spoiled to have so many fresh pilsners available (Prima and the Braumeister pils series, Pikeland, etc) so this one just can't hang with them. All said though, it wasn't half bad."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is quite a good attempt at a Czech pilsner with a nice balance between hops and malts with a clean finish."
"Overall a solid pilsener. I just wish more breweries brewed these lighter lager styles to encourage some real competition of flavor between brewers."
"Very rustic tone to this beer yet it stays clean, the malt lashes out at the palate and the hops follow. I'd love to see this beer with some more late hop additions, regardless ... I dig this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Great pils here! Totally drinkable, aside from the $10/6-pack price tag, and a really enjoyable lager."
"Smooth and clean and balanced perfectly. This is a well made beer and it tastes like it."
"O: An interesting pils, I enjoyed it, it's always cool to see a new one from Great Divide."
"O: This glide down very smooth, isn't too sweet, and has lots of flavor. Good stuff!"
""
"Overall: the flavor has a nice bite to it which is good but detracts from the mouthfeel. I prefer the taste over mouthfeel so I like this one."
""
"Pours a clear straw with two fingers of white foam, settles to a thin layer leaving a reasonable sheet of delicate lace down the glass. Smell: grainy, lightly toasted, semi-sweet, notes of grass and metal. Taste: wholewheat bread, spicy, grassy, lemon note. Well hopped. Crisp upfront but with a creamy feel mid sip. Finishes somewhat drying, spicy and lemony."
"Another very well done american take on a european pilsner."
"Great Divide Nomad Pilsner: Time to take a break from the intense signature Imperial Russian Stouts and Double IPA’s? The Great Divide Nomad Pilsner would be a good choice. In a glass, the Nomad has a sparkling sunlight color and brilliant white head. The fruity aromas get more intense and bready as you get deeper into this brew. The flavors are very balanced. Neither the malt sweetness nor the bitterness of the hops are overpowering or out of place. Not many brewers can create a pilsner with this amount of elegance."
"D - It's high quality and highly drinkable, and tastes extremely fresh. I'd have it again, especially on draught, but not one I'd go out of my way for."
"Very good pilsner. Absolutely amazing and well crafted."
"Overall, this is a nice beer, but I've had better. It lacks the light feel I expect from this style and the metallic finish could stand a little help."
""
""
""
"Overall: this beer has quite a few good points, and I guess the corn character isn't a total dealbreaker. Not bad."
"Taste is crisp and malty, with some balanced hops at the finish. Definitely not an extravagant brew from Great Divide, but definitely a well-done and enjoyable session pilsner. No problems here."
"Nice call, good retreat from the normal winter release. Will enjoy again."
"To style, Nomad is exactly as light as it should be and shows off some depth. It's plenty crisp and even has some smoothness. It's on the next level if not for just a bit of slickness."
""
"I am not much of a pilsener fan but for whatever reason I have had a craving to give this beer a shot lately. Pours yellow with a white head, that is being consistently fed by the bubbles that keep moving to the surface. An impressive amount of lacing on the sides. Right off the gate I get a quick lager aroma which is quickly paired with some sweetness from the malt and some earthiness from the hops. Surprisingly pleased by the aroma. The flavor is mixture of sweet and bitter. The sweetness comes in first and just before it takes over the hops come in and provide some bitterness. Lively mouth feel from the carbonation and a nice thicker body for a pilsner than I am used to, another pleasant surprise. Overall, this beer is pretty good. That said, it's not nearly enough to convert me over to allowing the pilsener into my drinking routine. But certainly glad I tried it."

"3.5 D: Really nice nose and taste, but it's a touch too sweet to drink more than a couple of these."
"Morey's Bottom Line: Because I'm a big fan of hops, I still prefer Prima, but this is right up there with Stoudt's Pils. I really hope that this beer is available around Erie this summer. I would have made this a spring/summer seasonal, but I also couldn't resist picking up this fresh bottle."
"Pale yellow with a little bit of chill haze and a pure white head. Spicy, Saaz-y aroma...flowery and biscuity with a subtle, but noticeable corn element. Pretty tasty and drinkable; they have the crisp, refreshing quality down. Dry, snappy noble hop flavor over a mild pale malt base. I wish the malts came through more, as they are pretty much buried under the grassy hops. Not bad at all though as an easy-drinker, and a pretty good stab at the style. Light and crisp. I could pound a couple more of these..."

"Overall, this is an above-average pilsner. If but this beer were popular and served everywhere instead of industrial lagers."
"O - As described, it is well balanced. Good pilsener, i really enjoy the finish."
"Overall impression: Solid drinkable pilsner - definitely could drink a few of these in a row."
"O- Overall a decent and well made, albeit unremarkable pilsner."
"Taste-Bread malt, spicy Saaz hop bite, crisp with a slight floral essence. A very nice Czech Pilsner. Good match for a mound of spicy nachos or a Hungarian hot dog."

"O/D-This is a tasty little Pilsener. Prim and proper. Too bad a 6-pack is nearly $12.50. In my opinion the price is far too high, especially for a pretty standard Pilsener. Worth a try, but not great at the price point I find this beer."
"Solid American made pilsener with pretty nice hop use."
"Very solid easy drinker. Would be a nice summer beer. Def worth a try."
"Notes: Moderate in body, with a very clean mouthfeel. I was surprised by the massive hop bill in this one. It's a good beer, however, It reminds me more of a German pilsener than Czech. Nonetheless, very drinkable, although there are better options out there."

"O: I like this beer, right up there with Lagunitas Pils and Victory Prima Pils in my mind and those are my go-to pilseners."

"Overall a solid, above-average pilsener, but probably not one I'll be buying on a regular basis. On a taste/dollar scale, not too far above the PBR-types."
"O- an average pils that i wont be buying again so many others that are way better than this one"
"new one from great divide. pours a very standard pilsner looking straw pale yellow with a fine 1 inch white head. smells quite malty and earthy for a pilsner. flavor agrees. this is a slightly bigger beer than most traditional czech pilsners. im picking up grassy and even rye notes in the flavor. mouthfeel is crisp and clean, with good carbonation and a light (but not too light) body. decent beer for the drinkers of lighter beers"
"Good new brew from GD. Should give Samurai a run for its money in sales."
"I bought a sixer because I am trying to broaden my palate when it comes to lagers and pils seems to be a style I like. I don;t really have a frame of reference in regards to Czech or German pils so I can't say which one this is more like. It was bright yellow, fizzy (the horrors), and looked good. Aroma was a bit of minerals and smelled decent. Flavor was crisp, mineral, nice lager flavor. I really need to buy more lagers so I can describe the flavors better, they seem so much more subtle than ales."
""
"Overall: Tastes like a Czech Pils, but feels more like a German one. Interesting take overall, but a wee bit harsh."
""
"A solid beer and one I was a bit taken back by. GD's previous lagers have been hit or miss, but this one definitely falls in the ""hit"" category."
