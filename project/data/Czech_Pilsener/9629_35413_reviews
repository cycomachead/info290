"This is a crystal clear awesome looking Pilsener. Could have a little bit more gas but the color is excellent. Taste is very clear and light could deserve a little bit more hops. It belongs definitely to the premier league of Pilsener i had in the US."

"Pilsners are always a bit of a gamble and I never know what to expect: some offer a blissful balance of wholesome malt and zestful hops, while others have a maltiness so feeble and plain that you can hardly taste the grain. This one is closer to the former and is a simple but well structured example of the style; a real joy to drink."
"When I poured this, it has golden color body with very little head. The smell is grassy and grainey. The taste is dull, I get some wheat flavor and a grassy undertone, no hops present. The moutheel is kinda watery and overall it doesn't impress me at all. ."
"O-This is pretty middle-of-the-road effort. The grain flavor is somewhat off and the butter notes do not do much for me. The vaguely bitter, soapy finish does not compensate for the funky, buttery grain flavors up front, and the feel was inviting at first, but about halfway through the glass, it became sore of annoying. Meh."

"Overall, a bit of a mess with DMS and diacetyl."
"O: Not your run of the mil Czech Pilz, its got some interesting flavors I can't pin point but its enjoyable. The hop flavor is excellent."

"haven't had anything from shorts in a long time, got this single for less than a buck fifty. good buy. it pours almost perfectly clear and really pale yellow with excellent carbonation visible. inch of white head doesn't last long. nose of lovely and bready ale yeast as well as more hops than most American pilsener types. the flavor is really good, smooth and a little sweet, still hoppy, but moved by pilsener malts. refreshing and interesting for the style, something sweet like a cream ale towards the finish, and a bit of body too. its bright and in a genre where the yeast is usually not heard from, I appreciate its forward position in this beer. cleaner finish even though its sweet, and an expansive body mature beyond its light malt youth. overall a very enjoyable brew, one of the better from shorts. its down easy, and while not totally unique, its a nice reinvention of the style in a way that's more pleasurable to me then even some of the most authentic Czech pilseners."

"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 5/6/2013. Pours moderately hazy golden straw color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, grape, cracker, bread, floral, grass, herbal, light honey, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of malt, hop, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, bread, cracker, floral, grass, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, cracker, bread, floral, grass, light pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of malt, hop, and yeast ester flavors; with nice robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly creamy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish as expected of 5.2%. Overall this is a damn nice pilsner style! All around nice balance and robustness of malt, hop, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"This pours a light golden yellow with thin foaming. It has a muted aroma that doesn’t really develop. However, the flavor comes across with a light lemony biscuit with some sodium bicarbonate notes. Noticeable minerality leads to a dull, effervescent finish. Didn’t live up to expectations."

"Pours a very bright golden-yellow. Looks thin for a Pilsner? Totally white 1-inch, creamy, head forms. Nose is low on malt and hops, and suggests cut grass. Very light body and palate with lingering bitterness. The bitterness is similar to that of a German or Scandinavian Pilsner, but the body and flavor is not. Not quite Kölsch-like, although the hops and bitterness are consistent with a Kölsch. Too low on hops and malt for a Czech Pilsner. Rings of delicate Belgian lace form. I am not excited and will not be seeking this beer again."

"O - I enjoyed this and it is not a style I have had much of. Only Budvar and Urquel, many years ago, when I visited Prague."
""
"The feel is both creamy and crisp in a light body. It's good, though a little slick in the mouth."

"o: I was sorry when this was gone. Perhaps closer to a light IPA than pilsener, but definitely a quality summer brew."

"Overall a pilsener that provides a nice flavor profile."

"overall: I wasn't expecting a ton out of Short's on this style, but i was pleasantly surprised. i found a very light and still pretty tasty beer"
""
""
"Well this one tasted much better than it smelled, mostly because it smelled almost like an empty glass. Refreshing overall, though the musky hops could lend a hand to a head-scratching astringency it seems. Good to wash a meal down with, which is pretty much all I was looking for. Just wish it had something to offer my nostrils - they felt left out."
""
""
"This is the perfect balance and really one of the best versions of the style I've tried.The relatively low rating on here puzzles me."

"Pours a bubbly bright straw yellow with a snow white head. Smell is sweet, malt and yeast with some earthy smells. Taste isn't sweet as the smell would suggest, taste starts bitter with malty tones. The bitter tastes like it came from hops. No yeast flavors some earthy ones are there. A medium light body, very smooth, great carbonation. A nice beer, good balance, bitter without huge hop flavor, tasty beer"

"Above average, but the lack of hops was a let down and made this a bit boring. Highly drinkable, and better than most macro brews, this is like a craft beer training bra and worth unsnapping."
"Will not buy again. The last few Shorts beers I have had have been a let down."
""
""
"O: I like this. I enjoy a pint, but I probably won't actually buy 6. Maybe for a party. tasty, but too bitter."
"A really good pilsner. Nice and balanced with good crispness on both the smell and taste."
""
"Taste/feel: As expected, mild. Drinks a lot like a light beer. The biggest thing about this beer that I don't care for is that instant it hits the tongue. It feels like carbonated water, and that's really it. But once the taste comes out, it's not too bad. There's a decent bit of hops and even some spices in there. A very mild aroma and taste, but that's what's expected with this style. It gets better as you get to the bottom of the glass, but still a pretty ordinary beer -- would make a GREAT beer for Summer."

"Pours a light yellow, hazy color, and inviting. Smell is muted and not very distinct, but it smells like this is beer. Tastes is very good, light, not heavy on the palate, actively, refreshingly carbonation, and then bitter enough to know that hops are there, and then dry and fruity, almost lemony, with some sour-ish notes that make it feel a bit like a hoppier farm ale or saison. Overall I like this a lot for a pilsner, which usually isn't in the fridge. I could see getting a six or a bottle of these from time to time. Nice offering"
""
"Pouts filtered yellow with a nice head. Nose is lots of grain malts with slight grass presence. Taste is the same - lots of grainyalts throughout and ends with a slight grass bitterness. Pretty solid take on the pilsner, might be the most true to style I have from America. Although this is a pretty short review, the sentence prior to this one sums up my feelings on this beer...not über complex, but delicious and true to style."
"O - Not a bad intro to Short's, but not what I was expecting...a decent Pils, but nothing overwhelming"
"Overall, decent but lacks that pilsner hop flavor."
""
"O: A decent offering from Short's. Session potential."
"Pours a bubbly yellow, not much aroma wise. Taste is thin, not the best mouthfeel. Usually I like a nice crisp pils, but this one wasn't doing it for me... just something about the taste seemed off and a bit astringent. A pretty average beer, nothing worth going out of your way for but wouldn't turn down a free one!"
""
"As far as style goes, I think it's a great American pilsner. If we're comparing this to a traditional pilsner I think this falls a bit short plus in my opinion it veers too closely to a saison. Nevertheless I could see myself enjoying many of these on a warm summer day."
""
"O: A nice, simple, no-frills pilsner. A very basic and simple group of flavors with a light body. Togther these things combine for an easy drinking beer. This is a good beer to serve cold on a hot day."
"This was quite tasty and would have again for sure."
""

"Overall, this is a refreshing, dry beer with tame flavors."
""
""
""
"Lightly hazy pale straw yellow, couple fingers of soapy white head. Light retention, solid lace. Lots of grass and cereals on the nose, herbal, grainy and perhaps a bit of Noble hops. About the same on the palate, grainy crackery malt, light spicy hops but mostly grass and grains. A kiss of citrus as well. Fairly light body, and medium high carbonation. A nice, fairly crisp pilsner and with lawnmower beer potential."
""
""
""
""
"M- Light and refreshing, ample carbonation."
""
"A good summer beer, if only it were summer. Highly polished, shiny colors; perfumey aroma and a buzz-saw bite with enough bubbles to inflate a balloon (after you burp them back up, that is...). A decent American pils, this is no Victory Prima but it will do as a sub."
"Decent pils overall, ok as a Czech version. Very drinkable and worth a try if you are a fan of the style."
""
"Overall, I'm super-impressed. I don't drink a heck of a lot of pilseners, but this stands up to the few (literally) Czech ones that I've had. Good stuff, of course very sessionable."
""
""
"Overall a nice and drinkable pilsner. I enjoy pilsners that have a hop bite at the end. Keeps you wanting more and pairs well with foods and a hot summer day."
""
"Overall it was really to plan and close to the style for a repeat offering but I chock it up to a pleasant drinking experience."
"O/D-A solid Pilsener. Won't blow you away but it doesn't have much to complain about. It's no Victory Prima Pils, but it will go down easy enough."
"Clear as can be yellow. Decent carbonation. Has a hard time keeping any kind of head up. Small amount of yeast in the bottle- nice because the beer can continue lagering in storage. Smells like lager yeast, clean and faint. Impressive grainy pilsner flavors. Thin body and crisp finish. Has a distinct Chech Saaz character (I assume hop choice from grassy - peppery notes.) Mild bitterness, very refreshing. I usually don't drink excessively, but I gladly drink a bunch of these."
"M: Light to medium."
""
"O - A very nice light pilsner. I would have preferred a bit more hops but I still appreciate this one for what it is. I could easily drink a bottle or two of this no problem."
""
"O: A halfway decent attempt at a pilsner. I'm not sure what the herbal bitterness in the aftertaste is but it sort of kills the drinkability. Up front it's a nice crisp lemony pilsner and then it dies. Odd, and a shame because I liked it at first."
"I give a Schlitz for this, though lager-style beers are not this brewery’s forte."
"Lighter medium body, decent carbonation, drinks super easy and plenty refreshing on the senses. This is a pretty nice pils that I'd definitely drink again - I also enjoyed the addition of corn to the brew."
"O- This is pretty tasty for the style. Will make for an excellent session beer on a hot summer day."
"Pours a nice light gold with sufficient white head. Smell, while not overpowering, was of light bready grains. Tastes starts with mild malt bill and finishes clean with some hop bitterness. A nice crisp pilsner. Nicely priced so I could see this having a regular spot in my fridge this summer."
"Pours out a golden yellow hue with a two finger thick white head that leaves minimal retention and lacing. I do get some grains, bread, some sweet malts in the aroma. The taste starts out with a slightly sweet taste followed by some grassy hops and citrus taste and some bitterness seems to be in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is smooth and slightly creamy, doesn't seem to be quite as crisp and clean as I thought it would be. A decent beer for what it is and worth a try."
"D - OK drinkable once you get accustomed to that slightly strange non pilsner flavor. I afraid that this beer is going in my reject beer stash."
"Really refreshing and easy to drink, this beer represents a nice pilsner, but is lacking some body or a bit more flavor to be one of the better around. I'd get it again to be sure, and I'm glad I got to try it."
""
"o: This beer was just to bitter to make it a clean, refreshing pilsner. I can taste a little malt upfront, but then the bitterness of the hops overwhelms all other taste sensations."
"Overall I thought that this was a pretty good Pilsener that was true to the style and it was pretty much everything that it should be. This beer had great drinkability, it went down very smooth and crisp, it was somewhat refreshing and would make a great beer to have with dinner, it was perfect with some fried walleye, this would make a good session beer, I don't think it would be that hard for me to take a out a six pack throughout the day. What I liked the most about this beer was pretty much everything, all the aspects of this beer seemed to be just what you would expect from a good Pilsener. What I liked least about this beer was hardly anything, but I did think it was a little hazy and could have been a little more clearer. I would for sure buy this beer again when looking for a good Pilsener, it's nice that this will be available year round. If you are a fan of Pilseners, then you need to give this beer a try, you won't be disappointed. I am glad that Short's decided to add this beer to the year round lineup, I thought that The Magician was a pretty average beer so I like the fact that they exchanged it for an above average Pilsener, it's a pretty good move in my opinion. So far this has to be my one of my favorite Pilseners, Short's really has some skills when it comes to this style and it makes for one tasty and easy drinking Pilsener that has earned a spot in my fridge."

"Very nice warm, bready pilsner. Not too many craft pilsners are able (or attempt) to create the level of bread flavors that this beer generates. These flavors dominate and almost need to be scaled back to make it more sessionable. Very similar to Trumer Pils (another favorite). I'll definitely try it again."
"O: Not impressed but very drinkable. Expected a bit more."
""
"Lightly toasted bread malts up front. Becomes lightly sweet, with notes of clover honey and sweetbread. Refreshing sea air hops blow in and make an appetizing foil for the malt. Bitterness becomes peppier in the finish. Very refreshing and dry. Some lingering honey biscuit malt. Medium-bodied, with a smooth, creamy feel. Very drinkable and will be great in the summer!"
"O - Enjoyable pilsner. I would have this again."
"This may become my go-to beer for easy drinking."
"O - I think this was a fantastic move by Short's to make this a 'flagship' year-end beer. This light and crisp pilsner, affordably priced at $7.99/six can really help bring in new non-tradtional craft beer drinkers into the mix. Hopefully after trying this, it becomes a ""gateway drug"" in order to be a little more adventureous and try new beers from Short's and other brewers."
""
"This is a pale yellow color, extremely fizzy and well carbonated. Smells are cereal grains and light hops, maybe a light white grape smell. Taste is crisp and very well balanced, finishing with a decent bite from the hops. This is light and very drinkable, which I'm sure is exactly what it is intended to be."

" light scent of grain that was the predominant player here no matter how you looked at it. Once you got past that it was easy to pick up a nice hint of banana in there as well as the tiniest bit of fresh grass like hop aroma. wheat and grain profile that was very well balance and very crisp and fresh. a tad musty, or maybe even bready in the flavor, however this was very crisp and had a nice balance to it. Up next were some more subtle fruity flavors, nice touch of banana in here to brighten it up a bit with something a bit tangy as well, maybe a hint of lemon,"
"Overall: I think this would be a nice cookout beer if you just want to sip something you don't need to think about too much. I would say it was alright, but I probably won't have another."
"Mouthfeel was great. Very light bodied. I could definately drink quite a few of these. Overall a pretty good beer experience."
"While not within style, this is nonetheless a very enjoyable brew and is recommended."
"Reviewed on 6/29/2010. On tap at Shorts. The beer pours a cloudy bright yellow, almost neon yellow, with a white head. Aroma of grainy malt, sweet fruits, bitter and sweaty hops. Flavor of wheaty, grainy, dry malt with a crisp hoppy finish. Nice pilsener."
"D- Easy to drink. Not a real high ABV but a very tasty beer."
"Enjoyed at the brewpub. Perle hops, santiem hops. Dry hopped. Yellow looks like ginger ale, and lacey. Medium mouthfeel. Served very cold, that's intentional. Very drinkable, alight bitterness and minerals, different than the Czech pils I have been having."
"not a typical czech pils. borders on german. on their website, short's just says ""true american pilsner style beer"". fair enough - and truer than miller lite can ever hope to be."
"This is maybe my third craft pilsner ever, so I'm definitely not an expert on the style, but this one might be my least favorite. It's not a bad beer at all, just didn't really have the crispness I was looking for."
"Very drinkable. It has that crisp clean taste that leaves you wanting a little bit more. I could have probably finished the entire pitcher with not a second thought."
"I had this on tap at Slows in Detroit this week. The beer was clear and golden/straw colored, maybe a little hazy, with a very thin head. The smell was more malty than hoppy, actually a little bready and clean. The taste was likewise malty, no real hops flavors picked up except a touch of bitterness. Medium body, this is easy to gulp, crisp and refreshing, not as hoppy as I'd like though."
"Drinkability: The floral finish on this beer makes it eminently quaffable; when combined with the bitter character, it makes the beer sublime"
