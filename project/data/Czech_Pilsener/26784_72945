Doesn't stick around a long time but what do you expect from a lager? Taste is slightly sweet, biscuit, some hop bitterness on the back of the tongue... could easily drink all I have in the fridge tonight if I didn't work tomorrow lol Just a great beer from a brewery right down the street from me.

A nice autumn lager with plenty of character. If you're introducing your BMC buds to craft beer, this would be a great way to bring them over to the dark side...","Groucho75","Sep 19, 2011"
4.2,22.1,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Comes out of the tap a hazy honey golden with a thin off-white head - but the latter may be an artifact of the pour. The bartenders at Summits like to make sure you get maximum beer. It is darker than most lagers I have sampled, a good sign. As it turns out, the head does leave some decent lacing. Malty, fruity aroma has apple and cherry notes and a hint of hops, unusual for a lager in my experience. Malty and surprisingly hoppy flavor has a fruity tone and subtle hop bitterness. Smooth, firm-bodied, fizzy, edgy texture leaves a malty and rather hoppy finish, somewhat more like an IPA than a lager. I’ve had plenty of lagers, and this is one of the best, if not the best!","Cyberkedi","Beers"
2.63,-23.5,3,2.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,"Overall: This lager carries across more bitterness than, for me, is desired and has a conspicuous raw graininess throughout, leaving me without the crisp, refreshing, inviting lager I'm looking forward to after a long day.","ChainGangGuy","0"
